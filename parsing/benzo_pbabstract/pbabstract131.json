    "1": "Patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing acute manic or mixed episodes who completed either of two 3-week, double-blind trials with asenapine 5 or 10 mg twice daily, olanzapine 5 to 20 mg once daily, or placebo were eligible for this 9-week, double-blind extension study. Patients receiving active medication in the 3-week trials continued the same regimen; those who had received placebo were blindly switched to asenapine but were assessed for safety outcomes only. The primary efficacy measure was the change from baseline to day 84 on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score in the per-protocol population. Results on the primary efficacy outcome were used to determine the noninferiority of asenapine versus olanzapine.", 
    "2": "A total of 504 patients (placebo/asenapine, n = 94; asenapine, n = 181; olanzapine, n = 229) were enrolled in the extension study. At day 84, the mean (SD) change from baseline in YMRS total score was -24.4 (8.7) for asenapine and -23.9 (7.9) for olanzapine. Prespecified statistical analysis for noninferiority indicated no significant difference between asenapine and olanzapine. The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar across treatment groups (77% placebo/asenapine, 77% asenapine, 78% olanzapine). Clinically significant weight gain occurred in 10%, 19%, and 31% of the placebo/asenapine, asenapine, and olanzapine groups, respectively.",

DLT occurred 1 of 6 pts in cohort 1 (thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia), 2 of 10 pts in cohort 2 (febrile neutropenia, hyponatremia, hyperbilirubinema; febrile neutropenia), and 2 of 3 pts in cohort 3 (febrile neutropenia, hypokalemia; febrile neutropenia). 1 pt in cohort 2 died prior to completion of cycle 1 likely from disease progression. Most common grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (7), leukopenia (5). Febrile neutropenia occurred in 4 patients (21%). No objective responses were seen. Two patients (breast and lung) had prolonged stable disease for 25 and 20 cycles respectively.",

Our study shows that using midazolam is a very simple technique which gives excellent analgesia and no other analgesia was required. No monitoring was needed, there was a very low incidence of complications and it did not require any technical expertise.", 
    "12": "Olanzapine was licensed in the USA by the Food and Drug Administration in 2003 for the prevention of relapse in patients with bipolar disorder when the acute manic episode had responded to treatment with olanzapine. However, olanzapine is commonly used in clinical practice for preventing relapse in patients with bipolar disorder even when acute response has not been demonstrated. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the effectiveness and acceptability of olanzapine in preventing recurrent mood episodes in bipolar disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled up to July 2008 were accessed. Only randomised controlled trials comparing olanzapine with placebo or other active drugs for long-term treatment were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data. Authors were contacted to provide additional data. Of the five trials included in this review, four were conducted by Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of olanzapine. Olanzapine was more effective than placebo at preventing manic relapse, but there was no difference between olanzapine (alone or in combination with lithium or valproate) and placebo (alone or in combination with lithium or valproate) in terms of relapse into any mood episode, as defined as primary outcome by authors in each of the primary studies. We conclude that olanzapine may prevent further manic episodes only in patients who have responded to olanzapine in an acute manic or mixed episode and who have not previously had a satisfactory response to lithium or valproate.", 
    "13": "Helicobacter pylori infection causes severe dysplasia manifested as gastrointestinal intraepithelial neoplasia (GIN) after 28 weeks post-H. pylori infection (WPI) in cancer-prone, hypergastrinemic male INS-GAS mice. We examined the efficacy of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac (400 ppm in drinking water) alone, the CCK2/gastrin receptor antagonist YM022 (45 mg/kg/wk) alone, and sulindac or YM022 combined with H. pylori eradication therapy to prevent H. pylori-associated gastric cancer in male INS-GAS mice. Treatments started at 22 WPI, and mice were euthanized at 28 WPI. In uninfected mice, all treatments significantly delayed development of spontaneous GIN (P < 0.05). In H. pylori-infected mice, sulindac alone or YM022 alone had no protective effect on H. pylori-associated GIN. Importantly, sulindac exacerbated the severity of H. pylori-associated gastritis despite decreased gastric prostaglandin E(2) levels. However, sulindac combined with H. pylori antimicrobial eradication reduced the incidence of GIN (P < 0.05), whereas YM022 combined with antimicrobial eradication did not reduce GIN. In infected mice, sulindac or YM022 treatment did not alter gastric expression of the proinflammatory cytokines Ifn-gamma and Tnf-alpha and mucosal cell proliferation. Sulindac or YM022 combined with antimicrobial eradication down-regulated mRNA levels of Ifn-gamma and Tnf-alpha and mucosal cell proliferation (P < 0.05). We conclude that sulindac enhances H. pylori gastritis and may promote inflammation-mediated gastric carcinogenesis. The combination of sulindac and antimicrobial H. pylori eradication was beneficial for reducing proinflammatory cytokine mRNA in the stomach and preventing progression from severe dysplasia to gastric cancer in H. pylori-infected INS-GAS mice.", 
    "14": "Preoperative anxiety can increase postoperative pain and is therefore important to avoid. Different approaches have already been tested for preoperative anxiolysis. Gabapentinoids might be a useful alternative to benzodiazepines. Pregabalin is used for treating generalized anxiety disorders and shows a favourable pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration; however, its anxiolytic effect preoperatively in healthy outpatients is still unclear. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial the anxiolytic effect of pregabalin in 40 outpatients undergoing standardised general anaesthesia and postoperative pain therapy for minor orthopaedic surgery was analysed. Patients received preoperatively either 300 mg pregabalin or placebo orally. The primary outcome was anxiety before anaesthesia induction, the secondary outcome the postoperative pain, both assessed using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100. Without any side effects pregabalin reduced preoperative anxiety compared with the control group (23 \u00b1 10 vs. 38 \u00b1 17; p = 0.003). Pain scores did not differ between groups; however, need of piritramide in the postanaesthesia care unit was reduced to half by pregabalin compared with the control group. A single preoperative dose of 300 mg pregabalin reduces anxiety in patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery without any side effects like dizziness or persisting sedation resulting in a prolonged stay in the postanaesthesia care unit.", 
    "15": "Previous studies in our laboratory showed that cannabinoid CB1 receptor knockout mice (CB1-/-) presented increased anxiety-like behaviours that did not respond to the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines. These results suggest that the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines may involve the participation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of alprazolam and the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 on behavioural assays (light-dark box test, neurological severity score and step-down inhibitory avoidance test) and on the functional activity of the CB1 receptor (WIN-55,212-stimulated [(35)S] guanosine triphosphate (GTP) gamma binding autoradiography).The administration of alprazolam (40 microg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)) decreased anxiety-like behaviours in the light-dark box test and significantly reduced WIN-55,212-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgamma binding autoradiography in the amygdala and in the CA1 field of the hippocampus, but was without effects on CA2, CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. The administration of AM251 (3 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked the anxiolytic action of alprazolam (40 microg/kg, i.p.), significantly reduced the sedative (ataxia, neurological severity score in the 0.5 cm bar) and the amnesic actions (short time term memory (1 h after electric shock)) of alprazolam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.).Taken together, these findings revealed that cannabinoid CB1 receptor plays a pivotal role in the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines. Furthermore, these results suggest that blockade of cannabinoid CB1 receptors may be useful in the treatment of patients with problems related to the consumption of benzodiazepines. Further clinical trials are needed to test this hypothesis.", 
    "16": "The aim of this study was to examine the effect of rapid tryptophan depletion (RTD) combined with a panicogenic challenge in patients with panic disorder who had responded to treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We hypothesised that RTD (compared with the control drink) would result in an increase in anxiety symptoms when provoked by a panicogenic challenge with the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil.", 
    "17": "Nine patients with panic disorder who had responded to CBT received a tryptophan-free amino acid drink on one occasion and a control drink on the other in a double-blind crossover design. In addition, they received flumazenil and placebo infusions on each day.", 
    "18": "Our hypothesis regarding the effects of RTD was supported by findings of a significant interaction between RTD and flumazenil on measures from visual analogues scales (total) and the Spielberger State Anxiety inventory. A somewhat unexpected finding was that in this group of CBT responders, the panicogenic effect of flumazenil was not completely blocked by treatment. This meant that although four of the nine subjects (44%) reported a panicogenic effect of flumazenil on the RTD day, this was not significantly different from the rate of panic attacks in response to flumazenil on the control day.", 
    "19": "We suggest that the partial return of symptoms in response to flumazenil reflects a vulnerability to RTD in this group of panic disorder patients who had responded to treatment with CBT.", 
    "20": "An association between zolpidem administration and sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) has been suggested. The authors observed zolpidem-induced SRED in restless legs syndrome (RLS). With the review of previous reports, we identified a common occurrence of RLS in zolpidem-induced SRED.", 
    "21": "Brugada syndrome is a genetic disorder associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death that has typical electrocardiographic (ECG) patterns. Recently, there have been reports of Brugada ECG patterns seen in critically ill patients who received propofol,(1) and this pattern was associated with a very high imminent mortality. We report a case in which a critically ill patient developed a Brugada ECG pattern following high-dose propofol infusion. Once the ECG pattern was recognized, the propofol was discontinued and the ECG pattern resolved, and the patient was discharged home with no arrhythmic sequelae.", 
    "22": "Neuropeptide S (NPS) is a recently discovered neurotransmitter that binds to its cognate G-protein coupled receptor, NPSR. Previous studies have shown that central administration of this peptide induces anxiolytic-like effects, promotes arousal and inhibits feeding in the same dose range. In the present study, we sought to investigate further the unique physiopharmacological profile of the NPS system by characterizing its effects on palatable food consumption in rats and comparing it with the effect of the classical anxiolytic benzodiazepine midazolam. The results demonstrated that midazolam (5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) increases palatable food consumption, while intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of NPS markedly reduces it. The anorectic effect of NPS (0.1-1.0 nmol per rat, ICV) was prevented by ICV pretreatment with the NPSR antagonist [D-Cys(tBU)(5)]NPS (20.0-60.0 nmol per rat). Pretreatment with the nonselective corticotrophin-releasing factor receptor (CRF) antagonist alpha-helical CRF 9-41 (6.25 and 12.5 nmol per rat) completely reversed the hypophagic action of CRF (0.4 nmol per rat, ICV) but did not prevent the anorectic effect of ICV NPS (1.0 nmol per rat). Brain site-specific microinjection experiments revealed that NPS markedly inhibits palatable food intake if administered into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN). A similar but smaller and shorter lasting reduction of feeding was observed following intra-lateral hypothalamus administration, whereas no effect was observed following injection into the central amygdala. The present study demonstrates that NPS evokes a potent inhibition of palatable food consumption and that the PVN is an important site of action for its effect.", 
    "23": "An epidemic of scopolamine poisonings occurred in Oslo in 2008 among users of illicit drugs, caused by fake Rohypnol pills. The clinical features, diagnostic process, and handling of the epidemic are presented.", 
    "24": "Suspected cases of scopolamine poisoning were extracted by reviewing registration forms from an ongoing prospective clinical study of acute poisonings in Oslo. Medical records of extracted contacts were examined and cases included according to specified clinical criteria.", 
    "25": "Forty-four cases of probable scopolamine poisoning were registered. Main clinical features were mydriasis, visual hallucinations, plucking behavior, agitation, and coma. No clinical diagnosis of anticholinergic syndrome was made prior to forensic analysis of the tablets, the most frequent diagnosis up to this point being unspecified drug-induced psychosis. Later in the epidemic, scopolamine poisoning became the dominating diagnosis. Ten patients were admitted to psychiatric hospitals, the rest recovered in medical units, or left health care against medical advice.", 
    "26": "Scopolamine poisonings are rare, but the resulting anticholinergic syndrome is well described. The syndrome was not recognized until the forensic analysis result strikingly changed how the patients were diagnosed and handled. A unique aspect of this epidemic was the intoxicating agent being scopolamine-containing tablets looking like Rohypnol, sold and used under the impression of being the latter.", 
    "27": "Recognizing the anticholinergic syndrome is important to provide proper treatment. Forensic analysis was the key to correct diagnosis in this outbreak, demonstrating its importance in verifying an epidemic of poisoning by fake drugs.", 
    "28": "Inhibition of gamma-secretase cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a prime target for the development of therapeutics for treating Alzheimer's disease; however, complete inhibition of this activity would also impair the processing of many other proteins, including the APP homologues, amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP) 1 and 2. To prevent unwanted side effects, therapeutically useful gamma-secretase inhibitors should specifically target APP processing while sparing cleavage of other gamma-substrates. Thus, since APLP1 and APLP2 are more similar to APP than any of the other known gamma-secretase substrates and have important physiological roles in their own right, we reasoned that comparison of the effect of gamma-secretase inhibitors on APLP processing should provide a sensitive indicator of the selectivity of putative inhibitors. To address this issue, we have optimized microsome and cell culture assays to monitor the gamma-secretase proteolysis of APP and APLPs. Production of the gamma-secretase-generated intracellular domain (ICD) occurs more rapidly from APLP1 than from either APLP2 or APP, suggesting that APLP1 is a better gamma-substrate and that substrate recognition is not restricted to the highly conserved amino acid sequences surrounding the epsilon-site. As expected, the well-characterized gamma-secretase modulator, fenofibrate, did not inhibit ICD release, whereas a related compound, FT-9, inhibited gamma-secretase both in microsomes and in whole cells. Importantly, FT-9 displayed a preferential effect, inhibiting cleavage of APP much more effectively than cleavage of APLP1. These findings suggest that selective inhibitors can be developed and that screening of compounds against APP and APLPs should assist in this process.",

Data for the comparisons of ziprasidone with amisulpride, clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone were available. Ziprasidone was a less acceptable treatment than olanzapine (leaving the studies early for any reason: 5 RCTs, n=1937, RR 1.26 CI 1.18 to 1.35, NNH 7 CI 5 to 10) and risperidone (3 RCTs, n=1029, RR 1.11 CI 1.02 to 1.20, NNH 14 CI 8 to 50), but not than the other second generation antipsychotic drugs.

Based on limited data there were no significant differences in tolerability between ziprasidone and amisulpride or clozapine. Ziprasidone produced less weight gain than olanzapine (5 RCTs, n=1659, MD -3.82 CI -4.69 to -2.96), quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=754, RR 0.45 CI 0.28 to 0.74) or risperidone (3 RCTs, n=1063, RR 0.49 CI 0.33 to 0.74). It was associated with less cholesterol increase than olanzapine, quetiapine and risperidone. Conversely ziprasidone produced slightly more extrapyramidal side-effects than olanzapine (4 RCTs, n=1732, RR 1.43 CI 1.03 to 1.99, NNH not estimable) and more prolactin increase than quetiapine (2 RCTs, n=754, MD 4.77 CI 1.37 to 8.16), but less movement disorders (2 RCTs, n=822, RR 0.70 CI 0.51 to 0.97, NNT not estimable) and less prolactin increase (2 RCTs, n=767, MD -21.97 CI -27.34 to -16.60) than risperidone.",

    "50": "A Case is presented of a 23-year-old woman with progressive onset of paranoid psychosis and catatonia, who was ultimately found to have both vitamin B12 deficiency and a family history of bipolar disorder. The patient was initially diagnosed with schizophrenia and treated with the antipsychotic medication ziprasidone. Her condition rapidly worsened to a state consistent with either neuroleptic malignant syndrome or malignant catatonia. Work-up then revealed vitamin B12 deficiency and a family history of bipolar disorder. Her symptoms improved rapidly but partially with benzodiazepines and electrocon-vulsive therapy, and completely with addition of valproic acid, vitamin B12 replacement, and re-introduction of antipsychotic medication in the form of olanzapine. The authors discuss the differential diagnosis of catatonia as reflecting a high likelihood of underlying mood disorder; the evaluation and management of malignant catatonia and malignant neuroleptic syndrome; and the role of vitamin B12 deficiency in precipitating psychotic symptoms. The case also illustrates the problems of diagnosing and managing a multifactorial disorder with psychiatric, general medical, and perhaps iatrogenic components.", 
    "51": "Atypical antipsychotics are known to be associated with electroencephalogram abnormalities. Olanzapine can lower seizure threshold and induce epileptiform discharges.

We report the case of a 25-year-old man with a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia with obsessive-compulsive disorder of 8 years' duration who developed new-onset generalized tonic-clonic seizure with exposure to olanzapine. Electroencephalogram showed epileptiform discharges; results of computed tomographic scan and metabolic investigations were normal. His antipsychotic was changed to haloperidol, and the patient showed a significant improvement in psychotic symptoms with no recurrence of seizures and did not require anticonvulsant therapy. Olanzapine has a profile similar to that of clozapine and shares its seizure-inducing potential. Typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol might be a safer option for such patients.",

Their deliveries were monitored over a 9-month period. After a descriptive analysis, a clustering method illustrated by a factorial analysis was used to identify different subgroups of clonazepam consumers. An increase of 82% in participants who had a delivery of clonazepam between 2001 and 2006 was observed. Using the clustering method, this study identified some deviant participants. This group comprises a higher proportion of males, benzodiazepine users, and buprenorphine users. The number of deliveries by different prescribers and pharmacies are higher. The proportion of deviant participants increased between 2001 and 2006 (from 0.86 to 1.38%).

As part of the national Research Outcome Study in Ireland Evaluating drug treatment effectiveness (ROSIE, see www.nuim.ie/rosie) comprehensive drug and alcohol data on 404 opiate users were collected. This study recruited and followed up at 1 and 3 years a prospective cohort of 404 users entering a new treatment episode. Descriptive and inferential statistics were computed and logistic modelling was used to identify key factors effecting outcomes. The cohort represented 8.2% of all new treatments. Follow-up interview rate at 3 years was 88%. Analysis revealed that those who abstained from alcohol use at 3 years were less likely to be using heroin at 3 years than non-abstainers. In addition, those who abstained from alcohol use at 3 years were also less likely to be using methadone, benzodiazepines and cocaine at 3 years than alcohol users. Outcomes for medium and heavy drinkers were found not to be as good as alcohol abstainers. Finally males tended to reduce the frequency and level of alcohol usage after entering treatment more than females. Results demonstrate to clinicians that an alcohol strategy is a key component of opiate treatment planning and a comprehensive and regular assessment of the client's alcohol and drug use profile is essential if treatment interventions are to have maximum impact on outcomes.", 
    "54": "Pain management during burn dressing changes is a critical part of treatment in acute burn injuries. Although several treatment options have been suggested, it is still a challenge in a clinical setting. This study is aimed at finding out an ideal analgesic, sedative and/or anxiolytic combination that would minimise the unwanted effects of ketamine. A total of 24 patients, with burns up to 20-50% of total body surface area (TBSA), were included in the study and randomly divided into three groups. In group I, 2 mg kg(-1) ketamine was administered. In group II, 1 mg kg(-1) tramadol was administered and 30 min later, 1 microg kg(-1) dexmedetomidine and 2 mg kg(-1) ketamine was administered. In group III, 1 mg kg(-1) tramadol was applied and 30 min later, 0.05 mg kg(-1) midazolam and 2 mg kg(-1) ketamine was administered. The evaluation was performed with cardiopulmonary monitoring, sedation and visual analogue pain scores and overall patient satisfaction. Any adverse effects of ketamine were recorded. The results showed that group II had better outcomes with respect to pain management during dressing changes. As a conclusion, the use of the combination of ketamine, tramadol and dexmedetomidine was found to be a good treatment option for the prevention of the procedural pain suffered by adult patients during dressing changes.", 
    "55": "Death has occurred when there is irreversible loss of integration of the organism as a whole, and brain death is said to be a criterion for death. In the present case, a 10-month-old boy was found submerged in a bathtub and was given cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 37 minutes. He had received therapeutic dosing of phenobarbital and midazolam up to 5 hours prior to a brain death examination. He fulfilled all criteria for brain death according to Canadian Neurological Determination of Death Forum recommendations on an examination 42 hours after the drowning event, but started breathing another 15 hours later. Eleven previously published cases of purported reversal of findings of brain death are discussed here, including two infants who fulfilled all criteria for brain death for more than 24 hours. Recommendations for brain death determination may require revision for infants, to more clearly define a time interval between examinations and to incorporate consideration of confounding sedative drug effects. Together with previous reports, the present case calls into question the assumption that brain death as currently diagnosed is irreversible, and therefore equivalent to death of the patient.", 
    "56": "Hitherto, little is known about the specific functional contributions of extrathalamic arousal systems to the regulation of wakefulness in humans. Here, we describe a 42-year-old woman with treatment resistant tremulous cervical dystonia who underwent microelectrode-guided stereotactic implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes in the internal segment of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) under general anaesthesia. Acute unilateral DBS of circumscribed sites within the subpallidal fibre-field with 130 Hz caused a transient state of wakefulness with an increased responsiveness to external stimuli but without detectable signs of conscious awareness. The extent of behavioural arousal could be titrated as a function of stimulus intensity. At lower stimulation intensities, bilateral eye opening occurred in response to verbal commands or tactile stimulation. At suprathreshold intensities, the patient's eyes remained open and conjugated throughout the stimulation period. The arousal effect ceased abruptly when DBS was discontinued. Behavioural arousal was accompanied by global cortical EEG activation in the gamma-frequency range (40-120 Hz) and by autonomic activation as evidenced by increased heart rate. The observed effect was reproducible in both hemispheres and topographically restricted to 6 out of 15 tested sites in the fibre-field between the GPi and the posterior aspect of the basal nucleus of Meynert. We conclude that the stimulated neural substrate in the subpallidal basal forebrain is involved in the premotor control of lid and eye position and the control of the activation state of the human neocortex. It may thus be important for the induction and maintenance of anaesthesia-induced unconsciousness in humans. It is suggested that subpallidal DBS released a downstream arousal circuit from anaesthesia-related inhibitory modulation either by direct excitation of an arousal nucleus or by inhibition of a sleep-promoting centre in the basal forebrain.", 
    "57": "Status epilepticus (SE) still results in significant mortality and morbidity. Whereas mortality depends mainly on the age of the patient as well as etiology, morbidity often results from a myriad of complications that occur during prolonged admission to an intensive care environment. Although SE is a clinical diagnosis in most cases (convulsant), its treatment requires support by continuous electroencephalographic recording to ensure cessation of potential nonconvulsive elements of SE. Treatment must be initiated as early as possible and consists of benzodiazepine administration and supportive measures for the airway and circulation. These initial interventions are followed by effective intravenous antiepileptic drugs. If the SE becomes refractory, more complex intensive care interventions, such as induction of barbiturate coma, need to be pursued. Data regarding the role of more recently available antiepileptic drugs in treating SE also are discussed in this review.",

Patients prescribed a benzodiazepine during hospitalization were defined as positive.", 
    "60": "Of the total sample, 19.9% were allocated to the benzodiazepine (+) group. Female sex and older age were significant factors associated with benzodiazepine prescription. The median number of bed days was 13, and the likelihood of BDZ significantly increased with the number of bed days, even after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and ICD-10 diagnosis. For example, when the analysis was limited to patients with 50 bed days or longer, the percentage of BDZ (32.7%) was equivalent to that of a report from France.", 
    "61": "Irrespective of department or disease, patients prescribed benzodiazepine during their hospital stay tended to have a higher number of bed days in the hospital. The difference in the prevalence of BDZ between this study and previous Western studies might be attributed to the relatively short length of hospital stay in this study. Because BDZs are often reported to be prescribed to hospitalized patients without appropriate documentation for the indications for use, it is important to monitor the rational for prescriptions of benzodiazepine carefully, for both clinical and economical reasons.", 
    "62": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common neurological sensory-motor disorder that is characterized by intense restlessness and unpleasant creeping sensations deep inside the lower legs. Symptoms appear when the legs are at rest and are worst in the evening and at night. They force patients to keep moving their legs, and often to get out of bed and wander about. Periodic limb movements (PLMS) are also common during sleep amongst those suffering from RLS, and sleep efficiency is severely reduced. There are idiopathic as well as symptomatic forms of RLS, the latter being associated with e.g. pregnancy, iron deficiency and chronic renal failure. A family history of RLS is very common and pedigrees in these cases suggest an autosomal-dominant transmission with high penetrance. Genetic investigations have been performed in order to identify genes associated with RLS. Several loci have been found (on chromosomes 12q, 14q, 9p, 2q, 20p and 16p). Pathophysiology of RLS remains incompletely understood. However, advanced brain imaging studies and positive results of dopaminergic treatment suggest that RLS may be generated by dopamine dysfunction locally within the central nervous system. At present, there is a wide range of treatment options including levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs and iron supplements.", 
    "63": "Rectal diazepam is established as a standard rescue or emergency treatment for seizure or status epilepticus; however, the rectal route of administration has not been universally accepted. To determine if an alternative route of administration of a benzodiazepine was equally effective, we compared a novel midazolam HCl concentrated nasal spray (MDZ-n) with diazepam rectal solution (DZP-r) in the treatment of prolonged seizures in a residential epilepsy center. In 21 adult patients with medically refractory epilepsy, 124 seizure-exacerbations were treated by their caregivers, alternatively with 10 mg DZP-r and 10 mg concentrated MDZ-n, two or three treatments with each medication for each patient. No difference was demonstrated in efficacy or time to effect between the two drugs. Common treatment emerging adverse effects were drowsiness for both drugs in more than 50% of the administrations, and short-lasting local irritation after 29% of MDZ-n. No severe adverse events occurred. The nasal spray was preferred to the rectal solution by 16 of 21 caregivers and patients conjointly. MDZ-n was equal to DZP-r with respect to efficacy and side effects in the suppression of seizure exacerbations. The majority of patients and caregivers preferred the nasal spray over the rectal formulation.",

Patients who failed to meet remission criteria were eligible for randomization in the next treatment phase. Phase 1 was a 6-week lead-in with open-label sertraline flexibly dosed to 100 mg (or escitalopram equivalent) to prospectively define treatment refractoriness (lack of remission). Phase 2 was a 6-week double-blind RCT of (1) increased-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) versus (2) continued SSRI plus placebo. Phase 3 was a 12-week RCT of added cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to \"medication optimization\" with SSRI plus clonazepam. Primary endpoints were remission and change in Panic Disorder Severity Scale (PDSS) score in the intent-to-treat sample in each phase.",

In phase 2, increasing the SSRI dose did not result in greater improvement or remission rates (placebo 15% [n = 2] vs increased dose 9% [n = 1]: Fisher exact test P = NS). In phase 3, remission was minimal (medication optimization = 11% [n = 1]; CBT = 10% [n = 1]), with a lack of group difference in PDSS score reduction (t(17) = 0.51, P > .60) consistent with a small effect size (d = 0.24).", 
    "68": "Although power was limited and larger studies are needed, we failed to find evidence for greater benefit of increased SSRI dose versus continuation of current dose for panic disorder symptomatic after 6 weeks at moderate dose. Further, augmentation with CBT or medication optimization with clonazepam augmentation in nonremitted panic after 12 weeks of an SSRI did not differ, suggesting that both are reasonable next-step options. However, low overall remission rates in this comorbid refractory population suggest that better predictors of response to specific treatments over time and additional interventions are needed.",

At baseline and every treatment month thereafter, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin-related metabolic measures, and prolactin were assessed, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed during baseline and months 1, 2, and 5 of treatment. Weight was assessed monthly, and waist and hip measures were taken at baseline and month 5.

There were no overall drug treatment differences in fasting glucose or glycohemoglobin or 2-hour glucose levels in OGTT and no differences between the two drug groups at the 5-month time point. There were no consistent drug treatment differences in the number of patients who developed borderline or diabetic glucose levels. Olanzapine-treated patients showed a significantly greater increase than risperidone-treated patients in a fasting measure of insulin resistance (P = .041), and olanzapine patients showed greater decreases in insulin sensitivity during OGTT (P = .023) compared to risperidone-treated patients. Olanzapine-treated patients had a significantly greater increase in 1-hour glucose and insulin levels during OGTT in subsequent months compared to baseline and greater increase in glucose and insulin area under the curve over time than the risperdone-treated patients. Prolactin levels decreased in olanzapine patients and increased in risperidone patients (P values approximately .02). There were no significant drug treatment differences in C-peptide levels or 2 indices proposed as measures of insulin secretion or beta-cell function (homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function [HOMA-B], BIGTT-acute insulin response surrogate measure [BIGTT-AIR]). Changes in insulin resistance over time were not strongly related to changes in BMI or waist circumference during study drug treatment.", 
    "73": "The increase in insulin levels during olanzapine treatment may compensate for the increase in insulin resistance and serve to reduce fasting and postprandial glucose levels. This may contribute to the lack of differences between olanzapine and risperidone in indices of diabetic or prediabetic glucose levels or glycohemoglobin. How many years this compensatory mechanism will persist needs further investigation. Periodic OGTT tests measuring glucose and insulin levels would be helpful in assessing the status of beta-cell insulin reserve in patients treated with olanzapine and other second-generation antipsychotics and assessing an individual patient's risk for conversion to type 2 diabetes.",

    "83": "Drugs that are clinically effective against generalized anxiety disorder preferentially alter rodent risk assessment behavior, whereas drugs that are clinically effective against panic disorder preferentially alter rodent flight behavior. The theoretical principle of \"defensive direction\" explains the pattern of associations between emotion and defensive behavior in terms of the differing functional demands arising from cautious approach to threat (anxiety) versus departure from threat (fear), offering the prospect that clinically important emotions may be explained using a single rubric of defense. We used a within-subjects, placebo-controlled, design to test this theory, measuring the effects of citalopram and lorazepam on the defensive behavior of 30 healthy adult male humans. We indexed human defensive behavior with a translation of an active avoidance task used to measure rodent defense and found that lorazepam significantly reduced the intensity of defensive behavior during approach to threat (hypothetically anxiety-related) but not departure from threat (hypothetically fear-related). Contrary to prediction, citalopram did not affect either form of defensive reaction. Since lorazepam is a drug with well established anxiety reducing properties, these data support the hypothesis that anxiety is an emotion elicited by threat stimuli that require approach. These data also contribute to the validation of a novel human analog of an established experimental model of rodent fear and anxiety.",

    "88": "Absence of 5-HT(1A)R signaling during early stages of brain maturation predisposes an organism to affective dysfunction later in life. Because early-life treatment with WAY-100,635 in Swiss-Webster mice reduced diazepam sensitivity and increased GABA(A)R alpha subunit levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, our data suggest a putative link between early-life disruption of the serotonergic system and the emergence of increased anxiety and decreased benzodiazepine responsivity at adult age. Moreover, early-life 5-HT(1A) receptor functionality appears to be essential for the development of normal GABA(A)R functionality.

Perfluorooctanesulfonyl protected 4-hydroxy benzaldehydes were used as the limiting agent for Ugi four-component reactions to form condensed products. Postcondensation reactions of the Ugi products generated 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione ring skeleton. Microwave-assisted Suzuki coupling reactions removed the fluorous tag and introduced biaryl functionality to the benzodiazepine ring. The library scaffold has four points of substitution diversities.

We used sparse routine therapeutic drug monitoring data (n=200) from 129 adults with epilepsy to develop a population PK model of VPA, and determine the factors that influence its clearance (CL/F). Patients were on mono VPA therapy, or were concomitantly treated with carbamazepine, phenobarbital, topiramate (TPR), lamotrigine or benzodiazepines. A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination was used to fit the concentration-time VPA data. Estimates generated by NONMEM indicated that VPA CL/F was influenced by the patients' body weight (increases with the 0.556 exponent), VPA daily dose (if it is greater than 1000 mg/day, CL/F increases by 43%), and co-therapy with TPR (lowering CL/F for 23%). The interindividual variability in VPA CL/F was modeled with exponentional error model. The estimated coefficient of variation was 31.9%, while the residual variability was 23.8% for the proportional and 13.2mg/l for the additive component. The model was validated in a separate set of 24 patients, and the predictive performance was evaluated, that indicated unbias and acceptable precision. This study confirms the interaction of VPA with TPR, which is presumably dependent on VPA dose.",

Some of them are targets of benzodiazepines that are widely used in clinical practice for their sedative/hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant effects. In order to rationally separate these different drug actions, we need to understand the interaction of such compounds with the benzodiazepine-binding pocket. With this aim, we mutated residues located in the benzodiazepine-binding site individually to cysteine. These mutated receptors were combined with benzodiazepine site ligands carrying a cysteine reactive group in a defined position. Proximal apposition of reaction partners will lead to a covalent reaction. We describe here such proximity-accelerated chemical coupling reactions of alpha(1)S205C and alpha(1)T206C with a diazepam derivative modified at the C-3 position with a reactive isothiocyanate group (-NCS). We also provide new data that identify alpha(1)H101C and alpha(1)N102C as exclusive sites of the reaction of a diazepam derivative where the -Cl atom is replaced by a -NCS group. Based on these observations we propose a relative positioning of diazepam within the benzodiazepine-binding site of alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) receptors.",

Midazolam 1'- and 4-hydroxylation (MDZ1'H and MDZ4H) were used to determine CYP3A activities in hepatic microsomes obtained from cats (n=4). The results showed that, all the examined drugs inhibited the reactions in a noncompetitive manner. The inhibitory constants (Ki) of KTZ were 2.80 +/- 0.70 and 115 +/- 28 microM for MDZ1'H and MDZ4H, respectively. Those of CIM were 3.13 and 3.27 mM and of ERY were 3.14 and 6.41 mM for MDZ1'H and MDZ4H, respectively. Mechanism-based inhibition was also examined in this study. KTZ significantly reduced MDZ reactions in a time-dependent manner; while CIM and ERY did not. Also, the effects of KTZ and CIM on the pharmacokinetics of quinidine (QUN) were studied. KTZ or CIM (10 mg/kg/day, for one week) was given orally to cats (n=5). QUN (2 mg/kg, i. v.) was injected 2 hr after the last dose of KTZ or CIM. The analysis of the obtained pharmacokinetic parameters showed that, KTZ significantly reduced total body clearance of QUN by 35%, while CIM did not. These results suggest that, KTZ inhibits CYP3A activities (both in vitro and in vivo), but CIM does not. In clinical practice, therefore, KTZ may result in inhibition based drug-drug interaction with CYP3A substrates in cat patients, whereas CIM and ERY are unlikely to lead to interaction involving CYP3A substrates.",

Separate groups of Balb/c mice were used for each dose of the drugs. Both drugs increased the number of crossings on the platform, indicating increased motor activity, and the effects were dose-dependent. Diazepam also significantly increased the number and duration of entries onto the slopes indicating an anxiolytic effect, whereas none of the saline or amphetamine-treated mice adventured onto the slopes. Amphetamine and diazepam produced an inverted U-shaped dose-response effect on different parameters of the test and demonstrate that the drug concentration which elicited a peak in mean number of entries is different from the drug concentration which elicited a peak in mean duration of entries.

Rats received one of 5 treatments: CocE 1 min after saline; CocE 1 min after a lethal i.p. dose of cocaine; saline 1 min after a lethal i.p. dose of cocaine; CocE immediately after observing a cocaine-induced convulsion; and CocE 1 min after observing a cocaine-induced convulsion. Measures were taken of ECG, blood pressure, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI). The specificity of CocE against cocaine was determined by evaluating its actions against the cocaine analogue, WIN-35,065-2, which lacks an ester attack point for CocE. In addition, CocE's effects were compared with those of midazolam, a benzodiazepine often used to manage cocaine overdose. Whereas CocE alone had negligible cardiovascular effects, it blocked or reversed cocaine-induced QRS complex widening, increased QTc interval, ST elevation, bradycardia, and hypertension. When administered 1 min after cocaine, CocE inhibited myocardial damage; however, administered 1 min after a cocaine-induced convulsion (approximately 40s before cocaine-induced death), CocE did not block cTnI release, but did restore cardiac function. Midazolam blocked convulsions, but exhibited inadequate protection against cocaine-induced cardiotoxicity. The majority of rats given cocaine plus midazolam died. CocE did not prevent the lethal cardiovascular effects of WIN-35,065-2. In all likelihood, CocE rapidly and specifically reduced the body burden of cocaine and inhibited or reversed the cardiovascular consequences of high-dose cocaine. These results support CocE as a potential therapeutic avenue in cocaine overdose.",

This study was designed to examine the accuracy of in vitro-derived parameters for the prediction of inhibition of CYP3A by erythromycin (ERY). Chronically cannulated rats were used to estimate the reduction in in vivo and in vitro intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) of midazolam (MDZ) after single and multiple doses of ERY; in vitro recovery of CL(int) was determined at 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after discontinuation of ERY. Enzyme inhibition parameters (k(inact), K(I), and K(i)) of ERY were estimated in vitro by using untreated rat liver microsomes. In vivo enzyme kinetic analysis indicated that single and multiple doses of ERY (150 mg/kg i.v. infusion over 4 h) reduced MDZ CL(int) by reversible and irreversible mechanisms, respectively. CYP3A inactivation after multiple doses of ERY treatment reflected metabolic intermediate complex formation without a significant change in hepatic CYP3A2 mRNA. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model of the interaction between ERY and MDZ predicted a 2.6-fold decrease in CYP3A activity after repeated ERY treatment using in vitro-estimated enzyme inhibition parameters and in vivo degradation half-life of the enzyme (20 + or - 6 h). The observed -fold decreases were 2.3-fold and 2.1-fold for the in vitro-estimated CYP3A activity and the in vivo CL(int), respectively. This study demonstrates that in vivo DDIs are predictable from in vitro data when the appropriate model and parameter estimates are available.",

While many of the CATIE design and implementation decisions are excellent and serve as models for future research, other decisions resulted in a study with a large study group but inadequate power. Multiple treatment interventions, unbalanced randomization within and across clinical sites, and multiple secondary outcomes are among the issues that require even more serious consideration in future large multisite clinical trials. Moreover, it is crucial to clarify whether the intent of a study is to establish superiority of some treatments or to establish equivalence, for the appropriate designs and analyses differ in these situations. If the study is designed, as was CATIE, to demonstrate some treatments' superiority, statistically nonsignificant results should not be misinterpreted as evidence of \"equivalence.\" For establishing either superiority or equivalence, future treatment comparisons might better be designed with fewer sites, more subjects per site, fewer treatments, and fewer outcomes, in order to have the power for definitively establishing superiority or equivalence at a lower cost.",

Self-injection of TPA123 (0.0032-0.1 mg/kg) and TPA023 (0.0032-0.32 mg/kg) was compared with lorazepam (0.01-0.32 mg/kg) in baboons. TPA123 and lorazepam maintained self-injection higher than vehicle at two or more doses in each baboon; peak rate of self-injection of lorazepam was higher than TPA123. Self-injected lorazepam and TPA123 also increased rates of concurrently occurring food-maintained behavior. After the availability of self-administered TPA123 doses ended, an effect consistent with a mild benzodiazepine-like withdrawal syndrome occurred. In contrast with lorazepam and TPA123, TPA023 did not maintain self-administration. Positron emission tomography studies showed that TPA023 produced a dose-dependent inhibition in the binding of [(11)C]flumazenil to the benzodiazepine binding site in the baboon, which was essentially complete (i.e., 100% occupancy) at the highest TPA023 dose (0.32 mg/kg). In a physical dependence study, TPA023 (32 mg/kg/24 h) was delivered as a continuous intragastric drip. Neither flumazenil at 14 days nor stopping TPA023 after 30 to 31 days resulted in the marked withdrawal syndrome characteristic of benzodiazepines in baboons. In the context of other data, elimination of efficacy at the alpha(1) subtype of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor is not sufficient to eliminate abuse liability but may do so when coupled with reduced alpha(2/3) subtype efficacy.",

However, the mechanism whereby these drugs affect the neuronal pathways regulating energy balance has yet to be fully elucidated. The present study was conducted to investigate the respective and interaction effects of olanzapine and agonism of the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) receptor (MCHR1) on body weight, food intake, adiposity and expressions of genes liable of being involved in the anabolic action of AAPDs and MCH agonism. MCH is a hypothalamic neuropeptide, which exerts stimulating effects on food intake and body weight gain. Male Wistar rats received olanzapine (1 mg/kg of rat/day per os) and/or an intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of a MCHR1 agonist (30 microg/rat/day) during 13 days. Food intake and body weight were recorded daily, whereas adipose tissue depots were weighed at day 13. At the end of the experiment, we also measured brain levels of the messengers RNAs (mRNAs) encoding for MCH, MCHR1, neuropeptides-Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) using in situ hybridization. The 13-day treatments combining olanzapine and the MCHR1 agonist exerted additive effects in enhancing food intake and adiposity. Consistently, each treatment differently affected brain expression of genes influencing energy balance. While the MCHR1 agonist treatment increased NPY mRNA expression in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus, olanzapine treatment specifically increased MCHR1 mRNA expression in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh). AAPDs and MCH agonism exert additive effects on energy balance and selective effects on the brain expression of energy balance-related genes.", 
    "165": "Albumin dialysis with the molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) or single pass albumin dialysis (SPAD) uses human serum albumin (HSA) as an addendum of the dialysate fluid. The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the impact of the dialysate albumin concentration on removal efficacy. Heparinized human plasma (3 L/test) was spiked with creatinine (1000 mg/L), unconjugated bilirubin (100 mg/L), chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (100 mg/L), and diazepam (3 mg/L). The MARS albumin circuit was primed with different amounts of HSA (150, 100, 60, and 40 g). The plasma, albumin, and dialysate flow rates were 200, 200, and 40 mL/min, respectively. Clearances were calculated based on repeated sampling during the experiments, which lasted 480 min. The effective HSA concentrations in the dialysate were 175, 115, 77, and 46 g/L, respectively. They decreased over treatment time to 147, 99, 63, and 41 g/L, respectively, due to surface adsorption. The plasma-HSA concentration remained unchanged over time in all experiments (average 39 g/L). The creatinine clearance was not impacted by dialysate HSA concentration. For the albumin-bound markers a clear correlation between HSA-concentration and clearance was demonstrated with the highest clearances for the 100 and 150 g HSA experiments. The 100 g HSA setup appeared to be the one with best cost-benefit ratio, resulting in clearances (after 1 h of treatment) of 31 mL/min creatinine, 0.3 mL/min unconjugated bilirubin, 11 mL/min CDCA, and 35 mL/min diazepam. Low albumin concentrations, such as in SPAD, result in low clearance rates for albumin-bound substances. The optimal clearances in these experiments were reached with a priming dose of 100 g HSA.",

The term means substances helping comitting a rape such as GHB (gamma hydroxybutyric acid), ketamine, flunitrazepam and other benzodiazepines derivatives, MDMA (\"ecstasy\"), marihuana, amphetamine. The substances are often joined with alcohol. The victims are usually young women, and not all the cases are recorded by the police or physicians, because the victims often do not remember details of the event. The toxicological analysis of blood or urine would be helpful to explain the circumstances of the case and to prove using \"Date Rape Drug\". The samples for toxicological determinations should be collected as soon as possible (24 to 72 hours after admission). Preventing violence with \"Date Rape Drugs\" include wide education by media, police, teachers and parents. The purpose of the research was to check the level of knowledge about \"Date Rape Drugs\". The consciousness of risk behavior when the kind of substances is used and the ways of preventing the risk of being a sexual victim were checked. Material for the research were the results of questionnaire prepared by The Department of Medicine Sociology Collegium Medicum Jagiellonian University in Krakow, carried out on 740 students. Most of respondents (77%) were women. The age of respondents was between 19-36 years (mean 21.41; SD - 1.29). The results of the research showed, that respondents didn't have completed knowledge about \"Date Rape Drugs\". They did not know the ways of recognizing and preventing the risk of being given this kind of substances. The main source of information about \"Date Rape Drugs\" were internet and colleagues. There is a need to start education about \"Date Rape Drugs\" by serious institutions such as the police and schools in Poland. This is the best way to prevent young people against a risk of being given \"Date Rape Drugs\" and being a victim of sexual crimes.", 
    "176": "The central processing of peripheral nociceptive messages is highly controlled by the activity of local inhibitory networks in the spinal cord and supraspinal centers. Recently, it has been shown that endogenous 3alpha-reduced neurosteroids (3alphaNS) exert a significant spinal antinociception by potentiating GABA(A) receptor function. Because endogenous 3alphaNS can be produced in many relay structures of the nociceptive system, we tested the potential analgesic efficacy of promoting the production of neurosteroids by using etifoxine (ETX, 50mg/kg i.p.). This prescribed non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic was shown previously to stimulate neurosteroidogenesis in its early step after binding to the mitochondrial translocator protein complex (TSPO). Using an animal model of generalized neuropathic pain resulting from a 2-week treatment with the antitumoral agent vincristine sulfate (VCR, 0.1mg/kg i.p.), we show that injections of ETX (50mg/kg i.p.) given every day reduced the VCR-induced mechanical and thermal pain symptoms but also prevented their appearance, if used in prophylaxia 1 week before VCR. Both the curative and preventive effects of ETX on pain symptoms were mediated by the production of 3alphaNS as demonstrated in animals treated with the enzymatic inhibitor provera (6-medroxyprogesterone acetate; 20mg/kg s.c.). Altogether, this study shows for the first time that promoting 3alphaNS could be a possible therapeutic strategy to treat neuropathic pain symptoms. Since ETX is already available as an anxiolytic, its use in humans, provided that its analgesic properties are confirmed, could be rapidly considered.", 
    "177": "Previous behavioral studies have shown that neuropeptides intrinsic to the amygdala formation can alter fear and anxiety states. We have previously shown that the anxiogenic neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) increases inhibitory neurotransmission in basolateral amygdala. We have since observed that CCK induces synchronized rhythmic activity composed of compound postsynaptic potentials (cPSPs). We have now further characterized these cPSPs by inducing cPSPs routinely in 5 mM extracellular K(+). CCK facilitated cPSP occurrence in a dose dependent manner in brain slices from both young and mature rats. The cPSPs were attenuated by glutamate receptor antagonists (NBQX or DL-AP5) or low concentrations of GABA(A) receptor antagonists (bicuculline methiodide (BMI), SR95531, or picrotoxin), but not by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist, CGP52432. Low concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10 nM) also attenuated the cPSPs. The Na-K-2Cl cotransporter blocker, bumetanide (1 or 10 microM) also blocked the cPSPs. The anxiogenic neuropeptide corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) facilitated cPSPs while anxiolytic neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y (NPY) and somatostatin) attenuated cPSPs. The benzodiazepine agonist diazepam dose-dependently modulated cPSPs. Mefloquine facilitated cPSPs within 10 min of application. We hypothesize that cPSPs are generated by positive feedback between a subset of interneurons and a subset of glutamatergic projection neurons.",

According to autopsy reports, all patients died from excited delirium syndrome induced by cocaine use. Excited delirium is a state of mental and physiological hyperarousal commonly associated with the use of cocaine. Patients suffering from excited delirium can be extremely hostile and violent. If a physical struggle arises with police or medical personnel, the episode can end in death due to adrenergic overstimulation. Patients in acute excited states should be regarded as a medical emergency with a serious mortality risk, and should be transferred to the hospital rather than the police station. Medical and police staff should aim to reduce confrontation. When patients are too agitated to cooperate, benzodiazepines should be used for sedation of the patient. Beta blockers and antipsychotic medication should not be administered, as these medications can exacerbate the fatal cardiac effects seen in excited delirium.",

The present study suggests that strict structural properties of the amides are essential for affinity.

Retrospective case/noncase analyses using Australia's spontaneous Adverse Drug Reaction System (ADRS) database containing 150 475 reports determined crude and adjusted reporting odds ratios (RORs) for NPAEs for 23 drugs with various reported in vitro AA. Covariates were age (treated as a dichotomous variable [> or =65 years]), gender, and concomitant use of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and drugs with recognized inherent anticholinergic properties (anticholinergic drugs). The interaction effect between these covariates and each drug exposure category was examined. Age (> or =65 years) has a significant association with greater odds relative to younger age for reporting NPAEs. Drugs with reported significant AA in vitro were not always associated with RORs greater than 1 for reporting NPAEs, highlighting a dissonance between the in vitro AA index and ADRS observations. Significant interactions were observed between age (> or =65 years) and exposure to cimetidine, anticholinergic drugs, antipsychotics, and tricyclic antidepressants in modifying odds for reporting NPAEs, reinforcing the need for cautious use and monitoring of drugs with AA in older people.",

Estrogen (E(2)), progesterone (P(4)), and its metabolite, 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP), in particular, have received much attention for exerting these effects. Typically, it is thought that E(2) precipitates seizures, and progestogens, such as P(4) and 3alpha,5alpha-THP, attenuate seizures. However, E(2) may also have antiseizure effects, perhaps in part through its enhancement of the formation of 3alpha,5alpha-THP, which has GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor agonist-like actions. To test this hypothesis, male and female, castrated or ovariectomized, wild-type and 5alpha-reductase knockout mice were implanted with Silastic capsules of E(2) or vehicle and then administered pentylenetetrazol (85 mg/kg, ip). Wild-type, but not 5alpha-reductase knockout, mice administered E(2) had significantly longer latencies to myoclonus and increased levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the hippocampus.

To clarify the matter, a study is currently underway, regarding the drug metabolism in rats. In order to obtain a more complete and significant set of data, the main diazepam metabolites have also been considered, namely: nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam. A feasible and reliable HPLC method has been developed for the simultaneous determination of these compounds in plasma and brain tissue of rats. The method has been applied to \"normal\" rats and to genetic rat models of depression in order to estimate drug metabolism in different breeds. Analyte separation was achieved on a C8 reversed phase column using an acidic phosphate buffer/acetonitrile mixture as the mobile phase. The detection wavelength was 238 nm. An original sample pre-treatment, based on solid-phase extraction (SPE) was developed in order to eliminate endogenous interference, using only 250 microL of matrix (brain homogenate or plasma) for a complete analysis. The method has been validated with good results in terms of precision, extraction yield, sensitivity, selectivity and accuracy on both matrices and has been successfully applied to samples from some rats subjected to the preliminary study.

    "196": "The Translocator Protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a ubiquitous drug- and cholesterol-binding protein that is up regulated in several types of cancer cells. TSPO drug ligands (e.g., diazepam) induce or inhibit tumor cell proliferation, depending on the dose and tissue origin. We have previously shown that TSPO is expressed in Ehrlich tumor cells and that diazepam increases proliferation of these cells in vitro. Here, we investigated the in vivo effects of diazepam on Ehrlich tumor growth and the role of TSPO in mediating this process. Oral administration of diazepam to mice (3.0mg/kg/day for 7 days) produced plasma and ascitic fluid drug concentrations of 83.83 and 54.12 nM, respectively. Diazepam increased Ehrlich tumor growth, likely due to its ability to increase tumor cell proliferation and Reactive Oxygen Species production. Radioligand binding assays and nucleotide sequencing revealed that Ehrlich tumor cell TSPO had the same pharmacological and biochemical properties as TSPO described in other tumor cells. The estimated K(d) for PK 11195 in Ehrlich tumor cells was 0.44 nM and 8.70 nM (low and high binding site, respectively). Structurally diverse TSPO drug ligands with exclusive affinity for TSPO (i.e., 4-chlordiazepam, Ro5-4864, and isoquinoline-carboxamide PK 11195) also increased Ehrlich tumor growth. However, clonazepam, a GABA(A)-specific ligand with no affinity for TSPO, failed to do so. Taken together, these data suggest that diazepam induces in vivo Ehrlich tumor growth in a TSPO-dependent manner.",

Single-point calculations at the MP2/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level were performed for the more accurate energy prediction. The solvent effect was taken into account by carrying out single-point calculations using the PCM methodology.

Further addition of another hydrazine molecule to the azomethyne bond and cyclization with pyrazole ring formation occur, and then the diazepine ring-opening and the removal of hydrazine molecule proceed. Finally, imine-enamine tautomerization leads to 5-N-(2-aminophenyl-1-amino)-3-phenylpyrazole as a main product that is in agreement with the experimental observation. The cyclization step is a rate-determining step of this reaction.", 
    "199": "To compare the effect of 7 antipsychotic drugs on the life quality of schizophrenia patients including chlorpromazine, sulpiride, clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole.", 
    "200": "A total of 1,227 stable schizophrenic patients within 5 years onset who took 1 of the 7 study medications as maintenance treatment were followed up for 1 year at 10 China sites. Patients were evaluated by the short form-36 health survey (SF-36) at the baseline and at the end of 1 year.", 
    "201": "The life quality was improved obviously at the end of the follow-up. There was significant difference in body pain, vitality, and mental health (P<0.05) among these antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "202": "All 7 antipsychotic drugs can improve the life quality of schizophrenia patients. Atypical antipsychotic drugs, especially olazapine and quetiapine, are superior to typical antipsychotic drugs in improving life quality.", 
    "203": "The GABA(A) receptor alpha2/alpha3 subtype-selective compound 7-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-(2-ethyl-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3-ylmethoxy)-3-(2-fluorophenyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-b]pyridazine (TPA023; also known as MK-0777) is a triazolopyridazine that has similar, subnanomolar affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site of alpha1-, alpha2-, alpha3-, and alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors and has partial agonist efficacy at the alpha2 and alpha3 but not the alpha1 or alpha5 subtypes. The purpose of the present study was to define the relationship between plasma TPA023 concentrations and benzodiazepine binding site occupancy across species measured using various methods. Thus, occupancy was measured using either in vivo [(3)H]flumazenil binding or [(11)C]flumazenil small-animal positron emission tomography (microPET) in rats, [(123)I]iomazenil gamma-scintigraphy in rhesus monkeys, and [(11)C]flumazenil PET in baboons and humans. For each study, plasma-occupancy curves were derived, and the plasma concentration of TPA023 required to produce 50% occupancy (EC(50)) was calculated. The EC(50) values for rats, rhesus monkeys, and baboons were all similar and ranged from 19 to 30 ng/ml, although in humans, the EC(50) was slightly lower at 9 ng/ml. In humans, a single 2-mg dose of TPA023 produced in the region of 50 to 60% occupancy in the absence of overt sedative-like effects. Considering that nonselective full agonists are associated with sedation at occupancies of less than 30%, these data emphasize the relatively nonsedating nature of TPA023.", 
    "204": "Treatment with olanzapine (atypical antipsychotic drug) is frequently associated with various metabolic anomalies, including obesity, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. Recent data suggest that olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), which dissolve instantaneously in the mouth, might cause less weight gain than olanzapine standard oral tablets (OST).", 
    "205": "Ten healthy men received olanzapine ODT (10 mg o.d., 8 days), olanzapine OST (10 mg o.d., 8 days), or no intervention in a randomized crossover design. At breakfast and dinner, blood samples were taken for measurement of pancreatic polypeptide, peptide YY, glucagon-like peptide-1, total glucagon, total ghrelin, and cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations.", 
    "206": "With the exception of pre- and postprandial concentration of ghrelin at dinner and preprandial CCK concentrations at breakfast, which were all slightly increased (respectively P=0.048, P=0.034 and P=0.042), olanzapine did not affect gut hormone concentrations. Thus, olanzapine ODT and OST had similar effects on gut hormone secretion.", 
    "207": "Short-term treatment with olanzapine does not have major impact on the plasma concentration of gut hormones we measured in healthy men. Moreover, despite pharmacological difference, gut hormone concentrations are similar during treatment with olanzapine ODT and OST. The capacity of olanzapine to induce weight gain and diabetes is unlikely to be caused by modulation of the secretion of gut hormones measured here. We cannot exclude the possibility that olanzapine's impact on other gut hormones, to impair insulin sensitivity and stimulate weight gain, exists.", 
    "208": "Increasing evidence suggests that 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia. This paper investigated 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression and binding density in female rats treated with aripiprazole (2.25 mg/kg/day), olanzapine (1.5 mg/kg/day), haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg/day) or vehicle (control) orally three times/day for 1 or 12 weeks. Animals were sacrificed 48 h after the last administration. Aripiprazole significantly increased 5-HT1A receptor binding density by 33% in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and by 21% in the medial posterodorsal nuclei of posterior amygdala (MeP) compared to the control group after 1 week of treatment. Olanzapine significantly decreased 5-HT1A receptor binding density by 17-22% in Layers I-IV of the cingulate cortex after 1 week of treatment. Neither of these antipsychotic drugs affected 5-HT1A receptor binding density after 12 weeks drug treatment. As expected, haloperidol treatment did not have any significant effect on 5-HT1A binding density after 1 or 12 weeks of treatment. 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression was not altered by antipsychotic treatment in any brain region. The results indicate that aripiprazole and olanzapine have differential effects on 5-HT1A receptor expression, which may contribute to their distinct profiles in improving negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. Aripiprazole and olanzapine may produce adaptation and desensitization of 5-HT1A receptor expression after long term treatment.", 
    "209": "This 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial used simultaneous depression and mania criteria to compare a single mood stabilizer, divalproex, with and without adjunctive olanzapine in patients with bipolar I disorder experiencing acute mixed episodes.", 
    "210": "Two hundred two adults, aged 18 to 60 years, who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for bipolar disorder with a current mixed episode and had been taking divalproex for >or=14 days at levels of 75 to 125 microg/mL with inadequate efficacy (21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS-21] and Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] scores >or=16) were randomly assigned to olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d versus placebo augmentation. HDRS-21, YMRS, Clinical Global Impressions for Bipolar Disorder (CGI-BP), hospitalizations, concomitant medications, and adverse events were assessed. Comparisons included changes in both HDRS-21 and YMRS (primary outcome measure), time to partial response and time to response, CGI-BP improvement, hospitalizations, and safety (secondary outcome measures). The study was conducted from December 2006 to February 2008.", 
    "211": "Mean (SD) baseline HDRS-21 and YMRS scores were 22.2 (4.5) and 20.9 (4.4), respectively, with 59% female and 51% white subjects. Mean +/- SE score changes from baseline across the 6-week treatment period for adjunctive olanzapine (n = 100) versus adjunctive placebo (n = 101) arms, respectively, were -9.37 +/- 0.55 versus -7.69 +/- 0.54, P = .022, on the HDRS-21 and -10.15 +/- 0.44 versus -7.68 +/- 0.44 P < .001, on the YMRS. Mean +/- SE score changes from baseline to last observation carried forward for CGI-BP measures were -1.34 +/- 0.11 for adjunctive olanzapine versus -1.06 +/- 0.11 for adjunctive placebo, P = .056. Time to partial response (>or=25% HDRS-21 and YMRS decreases, median 7 versus 14 days) and time to response (>or=50% HDRS-21 and YMRS decreases, median 25 versus 49 days) were significantly shorter with adjunctive olanzapine. Increases in weight (total and >or=7%) and fasting blood glucose were significantly greater with adjunctive olanzapine.",

    "214": "Zolpidem is an imidazopiridine with hypnotic properties. Compared to benzodiazepines, zolpidem has a mechanism of action that is thought to reduce the risk of dependence or abuse. However, in the past 10 years, several cases of zolpidem abuse, dependence and withdrawal reactions have been described in the litterature. Here, we describe a case of dependence and withdrawal seizure.", 
    "215": "To provide a rational basis for reconceptualizing catatonia in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition), we briefly review historical sources, the psychopathology of catatonia, and the relevance of catatonic schizophrenia in contemporary practice and research. In contrast to Kahlbaum, Kraepelin and others (Jaspers, Kleist, and Schneider) recognized the prevalence of motor symptoms in diverse psychiatric disorders but concluded that the unique pattern and persistence of certain psychomotor phenomena defined a \"catatonic\" subtype of schizophrenia, based on intensive long-term studies. The enduring controversy and confusion that ensued underscores the fact that the main problem with catatonia is not just its place in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but rather its lack of conceptual clarity. There still are no accepted principles on what makes a symptom catatonic and no consensus on which signs and symptoms constitute a catatonic syndrome. The resulting heterogeneity is reflected in treatment studies that show that stuporous catatonia in any acute disorder responds to benzodiazepines or electroconvulsive therapy, whereas catatonia in the context of chronic schizophrenia is phenomenologically different and less responsive to either modality. Although psychomotor phenomena are an intrinsic feature of acute and especially chronic schizophrenia, they are insufficiently recognized in practice and research but may have significant implications for treatment outcome and neurobiological studies. While devising a separate category of catatonia as a nonspecific syndrome has heuristic value, it may be equally if not more important to re-examine the psychopathological basis for defining psychomotor symptoms as catatonic and to re-establish psychomotor phenomena as a fundamental symptom dimension or criterion for both psychotic and mood disorders."
