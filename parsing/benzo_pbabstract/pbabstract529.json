    "0": "Experiments were made on rats using step-through passive avoidance method to study the effect of the benzodiazepine medazepam (Mz) on the retention of the memory traces during tests on the 3rd hour, 24th hour and 7th day after training, as well as the influencing of this effect by the nootropic agents meclofenoxate (Mf), aniracetam (Anc) and Euclidan (Eucl.). All substances tested (Mz in a dose of 5 mg/kg weight, Mf - 100 mg/kg, Anc and Eucl - 50 mg/kg), applied both independently and in combination, were administered orally for six days prior to the training. Mz was found to impair the retention of the memory traces in all three tests. Meclofenoxate totally eliminated the memory-impairing effect of Mz. A marked antiamnestic effect of both Anc and Eucl was observed in similar experiments with scopolamine-induced (2 mg/kg i.p.) amnesia. Bearing in mind the results of other behavioural and biochemical studies, including radioligand tests, an attempt is made to justify the idea that the basic mechanism of the amnestic action of Mz is connected with the cerebral cholinergic neurotransmission. The results of the experiments using Opto-Varimex and Automex equipment for testing the effects of Mz, Mf, Anc and Eucl, and of the combination of Mz with the nootropic agents studied, on the spontaneous motor activity of the experimental rats, lead to the most general conclusion that Mz impedes the development of habituation, considered as a specific type of learning and memory process. To one degree or another, Mf, Anc and Eucl cancel this effect of Mz.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The nature of inhibitors of [3H]-diazepam (D) specific binding (SB) was studied in 2 fractions of acidic extract from bovine brain cortex. Preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), mass spectrometry, UV and IR techniques identified hypoxanthine and inosine as inhibitors of SB D. These substances may participate in the neuronal activity control which is in part mediated by the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "2": "A comprehensive comparative approach was used to assess the effectiveness of the psychophysiological indices as predictors of the effect of tranquilizing therapy with benzodiazepine drugs in neurotic patients. The study resulted in selection of several psychophysiological characteristics most relevant to the prognosis of individual responses to the tranquilizers irrespective of the particular neurosis form. The characteristics are recommended for the routine medical use. Indices of the sensorimotor activity and visual analyzer functional lability are among these.", 
    "3": "Self-sustained after-discharges (SSADs) induced by electric stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex in rats exhibited under control conditions a significant progressive prolongation with repeated stimulations. Clonazepam not only blocked this increase in duration but it suppressed and/or abolished SSADs in a dose-dependent manner. Clorazepate in the lowest dose used (10 mg/kg) did not change SSADs. The two higher doses (25 and 50 mg/kg) blocked the prolongation of the 4th SSAD, i.e. this effect had a relatively long latency.", 
    "4": "This study reports a double-blind evaluation of a new formulation of lormetazepam for sublingual administration, given as a premedicant in 48 female patients undergoing minor gynecological procedures. Both patient's and nurse's assessments for anxiety and sedation were recorded at different times. Anxiolysis and sedation were present 30 minutes after administration of the drug as reported by the patient with a peak effect at 45 minutes. Nurses reported significant differences in sedation only, but already present at 30 minutes after premedication. The memory test showed no persistent effect of the benzodiazepine one day after surgery.", 
    "5": "Rats were trained to discriminate phencyclidine (PCP) from saline at doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg, using a two-lever food reinforced operant technique. +/- N-allylnormetazocine (+/- SKF 10047), +5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[A,D]cyclohepten-5,10-imine MK 801), 3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl) propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) and ifenprodil, which have been shown to antagonise the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), were tested for their ability to give rise to PCP-appropriate responding. In rats trained at both doses of PCP, +/- SKF 10047 (2-12 mg/kg) and MK 801 (0.0125-0.2 mg/kg) produced dose-related responding on the lever associated with PCP injection. The relative potency of these two compounds was the same in the two groups of animals, but their absolute potencies to produce a PCP-like discriminative stimulus were dependent on the training dose of PCP. In contrast, neither the competitive NMDA antagonist CPP (4-20 mg/kg) nor the non-competitive antagonist ifenprodil (2-12 mg/kg) produced PCP-appropriate responding and ifenprodil (4 mg/kg) neither potentiated nor antagonised PCP. These findings are discussed in the light of the hypothesis that the behavioural effects of PCP are mediated via a reduction of neurotransmission at the NMDA-subtype of glutamate receptors.", 
    "6": "Previously we observed that prolactin (PRL) is secreted in response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in normal women during the periovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle. Because sedative drugs affect the neurotransmitters involved in the regulation of PRL secretion, we investigated PRL responsiveness to GnRH in pre- and postmenopausal female subjects during prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines (six-60 months). In both pre-and postmenopausal patients who were not on benzodiazepine treatment, GnRH infusion (0.2 micrograms/min for 3 hr) was ineffective in eliciting a PRL response. In six premenopausal women treated with benzodiazepines, basal PRL concentrations were not influenced by the drug in four subjects (range 4.0-15.7 ng/ml) and were slightly elevated in two subjects (23 and 30 ng/ml). In six treated postmenopausal women, basal PRL concentrations were in the normal range (7.5-11.0 ng/ml). GnRH infusion induced a progressive increase in PRL concentrations which reached a peak at 120 min in the premenopausal subjects (mean % SEM increase: 64 +/- 30.5%) and at 60-90 min in the postmenopausal subjects (mean % increase: 110.6 +/- 34.7%). A saline infusion, performed on a separate day during benzodiazepine treatment as a control, did not influence PRL.", 
    "7": "Neural-network pattern classifiers were used to study the effects of long half-life flurazepam (30 mg) and quazepam (15 mg), and short half-life triazolam (0.5 mg) on non-REM sleep. We measured the magnitude of effect, time course, and EEG spectral signature of the three benzodiazepines as a function of third-of-night. Of the three benzodiazepines studied, flurazepam had the largest effect and quazepam had the most stable time course. The effects of triazolam were similar to those of quazepam. These EEG differences may prove to be more clinically useful markers than the usual measurement of plasma levels, and may be used to guide the therapy of sleep disorders.", 
    "8": "Studies were made of the effect of 19-day administration of diazepam (1 mg.kg-1, i.p.) and medazepam (5 mg.kg-1, i.p.) on the level of biogenic monoamines in different rat brain areas: cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and hypothalamus. The noradrenaline (NA), dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels were determined. After chronic treatment with diazepam no alterations in the NA content in the cortex, striatum and hypothalamus were found. Medazepam increased the NA level in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus without changing it in the hypothalamus. Repeated administration of diazepam or medazepam led to an increase in the DA level in the striatum. Both benzodiazepines provoked a significant increase in the hippocampal 5-HT level, which could be attributed to the antianxiety effect of these drugs.", 
    "9": "1. 2-oxo-quazepam (2oxoquaz) is a novel benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic containing a trifluoethyl substituent on the ring nitrogen at position 1, which, unlike other BZDs, distinguishes two populations of BZD binding sites. In the present study we characterized the binding of 3H-2oxoquaz to human brain membrane preparations. 2. Self and cross displacement curves for 3H-FNT and 3H-2oxoquaz binding in different brain areas indicate that 2oxoquaz binds with different affinities to two populations of binding sites in the human brain. 3. Competition studies of 3H-2oxoquaz (2 nM) and 3H-FNT (0.5 nM) binding with a series of unlabelled ligands indicate that compounds which preferentially bind to Type I sites are more potent at displacing 3H-2oxoquaz than 3H-FNT from cerebral cortex membrane preparations. 4. The binding of 3H-2oxoquaz is stimulated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and pentobarbital in a concentration-dependent manner. 5. The results suggest that in the human brain 3H-2oxoquaz binds with high affinity to a subpopulation of BZD recognition sites (Type I sites) which are functionally linked to the GABA receptor and the chloride ionophore.", 
    "10": "Barbiturates have been reported to augment benzodiazepine receptor affinity in vitro, but their effects in vivo are uncertain. We determined benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo by specific uptake of [3H]Ro15-1788 after barbiturate administration. Pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) increased receptor binding in cerebral cortex and cerebellum at 30 min after injection, with a peak effect occurring at 1 h after dosage, and a return to control levels at 2 h. Specific binding was increased at 1 h after pentobarbital administration in a dose-dependent fashion (7.5-90 mg/kg). Pentobarbital at doses up to 30 mg/kg failed to alter nonspecific binding, but at doses of 60 mg/kg increases in nonspecific binding were observed. The increases in specific binding observed after barbiturate administration were most likely due to a change in apparent receptor affinity, as determined by administration of varying doses of clonazepam to pentobarbital-treated (30 mg/kg) animals. The order of potency of a series of barbiturates in augmenting benzodiazepine receptor binding in cerebral cortex and cerebellum in vivo was: secobarbital greater than pentobarbital greater than amobarbital greater than phenobarbital greater than barbital. The same relative rank order of potency exists for the anesthetic/hypnotic activity of these barbiturates. These data suggest that barbiturates increase the apparent affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in vivo; unlike their in vitro actions, these alterations can be detected with a receptor antagonist.", 
    "11": "The Stress Clinic at the Maudsley Hospital investigates anxiety due to stress and its pharmacological treatment. Nine stress areas are investigated and their relative severities estimated: social habits, social relationships, life events, psychiatric morbidity, sexual stresses, sleep, stress in old age, menstrual stresses and stress and the heart. From the results a Stress Profile can be constructed for each patient to compare the importance of these different stresses and this can also be used as a measure of change in response to treatment. The benzodiazepine (BZD) anxiolytics can be divided into two groups according to duration of action, medium (8-12 h) and long (30-100 h). Short-acting BZD drugs are particularly useful for situational anxiety, when treatment can be interrupted over night and at weekends. To overcome problems of dependence, withdrawal effects, and daytime side-effects, new non-BZD anxiolytics have been developed: buspirone, alpidem and suriclone. These may be particularly useful for long-term treatment of anxiety. Another alternative is the use of adrenergic beta-blocking drugs of which propranolol and betaxolol have been used in the Clinic, because of their relatively high concentration in the brain when taken orally. Anxiety accompanying coronary heart disease and hypertension can be controlled with anxiolytic drugs and other illnesses with an anxiety component are: sexual disorders, menstrual disorders, asthma, gastro-intestinal conditions, dermatological conditions and chronic illnesses such as malignancy and AIDS. Lack of sleep is a subtle form of stress exerting an adverse effect in almost every illness known to man. BZD hypnotics can be divided into four groups: ultra-short-acting (3-4 h), short-acting (5-6 h), medium-acting (7-8 h) and long-acting (9-12 h). Depending on the nature of the insomnia, ultra-short-acting and short-acting BZD are particularly convenient with minimal disadvantages. Nevertheless, new non-BZD hypnotics are also being developed, i.e. zolpidem and zopiclone. These drugs are relatively short-acting and of equivalent potency to the BZD without problems of dependence etc. Anxiety, as either cause or effect, accompanies many medical illnesses and the use of anti-anxiety drugs as concomitant therapy can both reduce morbidity and improve prognosis.", 
    "12": "Antero- and retrograde amnesia are observed as side effects of most types of benzodiazepines. They have rarely been investigated with respect to physical and personality factors, or to prior experiences, present expectations, and emotional states of the subjects, all of which are well known to modify drug response. By reviewing research on benzodiazepine-induced changes of memory in preoperative, anxious, and depressed patients as well as in healthy subjects, it is demonstrated that differences in benzodiazepine-induced amnesic effects may depend on: 1. subject variables like predrug level of anxiety, depressive symptomatology, memory capacity, experiences with benzodiazepine-type drugs, and expectations of treatment outcome, and secondary factors like social environment and treatment setting 2. interactions between these subject variables and type of schedule (times of acquisition, treatment, and testing), type of learning material, and dose of drug. 3. the extent of benzodiazepine-induced changes in anxiety or depression, cortical and emotional arousal (alertness and activity) as well as physiological effects of benzodiazepines Special emphasis should be placed on the investigation of drug-induced changes of covariation between psychological measures which may provide valuable information for differential prediction and on mechanisms of drug action.", 
    "13": "There is evidence to suggest that the rate of information processing, as measured by the critical flicker fusion threshold (CFFT), is slower following some benzodiazepines than others. Changes in CFFT brought about by benzodiazepine administration are usually, but not always, correlated with changes in other measures of cognitive performance and memory. However, the drug-induced changes in information processing and memory cannot be fully explained by simple postulates regarding alterations in the overall level of CNS arousal. Results from a series of studies of the effect of benzodiazepines on measures of CFFT and memory will be reviewed and the utility of CFFT in evaluating the amnesic or mnemonic potential of CNS-active drugs will be assessed.", 
    "14": "In order to study the time course of amnesic effects of the benzodiazepine hypnotic lormetazepam, and their reversal by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, a combined visual and auditory memory test was developed, which was designed to allow repeated assessments. Immediate recall as well as delayed free recall and recognition (1 h after drug) were investigated before and after intravenous lormetazepam (0.02 mg/kg) followed 15 min later by intravenous Ro 15-1788 (0.03 mg/kg) or placebo. A third group received placebo followed by Ro 15-1788. Results are based on ten subjects per treatment group and are compared with an age-matched control population (n = 20) without treatment. Immediate and delayed recall as well as recognition in both visual and auditory tests were impaired abruptly after intravenous lormetazepam. These effects were reversed instantaneously after Ro 15-1788, which had no marked effect on these parameters when given alone. Ratings by visual analog scales (1 h after drug administration) indicated concomitant sedation and impaired concentration after lormetazepam, which was attenuated by Ro 15-1788. By itself, Ro 15-1788 had no effect on these measures. Interestingly, the performance in delayed free recall of the visual memory test was significantly enhanced in the lormetazepam group prior to administration. Our results suggest that impaired acquisition of new information after lormetazepam is benzodiazepine receptor mediated and may be associated with a drug-induced enhancement of retrieval of information acquired before lormetazepam administration.", 
    "15": "The development of a mouse passive avoidance test as a model for amnesia produced by benzodiazepines is described. The model appropriately classifies the amnesic potential of a wide range of psychoactive drugs as validated by clinical findings. Control experiments indicate that the effect is best described as anterograde amnesia resulting from a failure of consolidation. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists had almost no effect on benzodiazepine-induced amnesia, whereas the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 completely and specifically reversed it. This clinically confirmed finding suggests that benzodiazepine-induced amnesia is mediated through the benzodiazepine-receptor. However, in vivo inhibition of benzodiazepine binding does not correlate well with amnesia in the mouse, and some benzodiazepine-receptor agonists with potent CNS effects in other in vitro models do not produce amnesia. Additional work is needed to clarify what aspects of benzodiazepine receptor occupancy mediate amnesia.", 
    "16": "In a pharmacopsychological study, memory impairments after single oral doses of benzodiazepines or placebo were investigated in 40 healthy men aged 20-40 years. The study was designed as a double-blind and placebo-controlled trial. Four independent groups of 10 subjects randomly received either 1 mg lormetazepam, 2 mg lormetazepam, 2 mg flunitrazepam, or placebo. The tests consisted of word lists, picture tests, and syllable pairs (consonant-vowel-consonant trigrams). Tests were performed before drug ingestion, and 1, 2, 3, and 5 h after application. Different test versions were used on each occasion. The target variables were immediate recall (after presentation and a 10-s distraction task) and delayed recall and recognition (after 30 min). Recognition was also tested after 24 h for all five versions. A distinction must be made between anterograde amnesic effects and retrograde amnesic effects. The greatest anterograde memory impairments were observed after 2 mg flunitrazepam (p less than 0.05). Lormetazepam 2 mg produced less marked impairments than flunitrazepam. Results after 1 mg lormetazepam did not differ from those after placebo. Performance in the memory tests was better under benzodiazepines than under placebo as regards material learned before drug ingestion, i.e. the benzodiazepines had not negative retrograde amnestic effects, but rather \"promnesic\" effects. The results suggest that the extent of the benzodiazepines' amnesic effects--both negative (anterograde) and positive (retrograde)--depends on the dosage and type of substance.", 
    "17": "A review was made of the literature exploring the psychopharmacology of lormetazepam. Results from studies show that there can be a general hangover the morning following nocturnal doses of 2 mg. Findings from more recent work have shown that the 1.5 mg dose can disrupt retrieval of information from short-term memory. Lormetazepam 1 mg has no residual sedative effects. A daytime psychopharmacodynamic study showed lormetazepam 1-2 mg to have no disruptive effects 5 h after drug intake.", 
    "18": "Anaesthetic practice is the only clinical context in which amnesia is a valued property of benzodiazepine drugs, since decreased recall considerably enhances patient tolerance and acceptance or surgical and diagnostic procedures. Research on the amnesic effects of diazepam, midazolam, lorazepam and flunitrazepam, administered via oral, i.v. or i.m. routes to patients undergoing surgical or diagnostic procedures is reviewed. The degree of anterograde amnesia is a function of the drug, the route of administration and the population of patients being assessed. Retrograde amnesia has not been conclusively demonstrated. Amnesia is more profound for cutaneous-tactile and auditory than for visual stimuli, but actual surgical events, or emotionally laden material, are more likely to be recalled than artificial stimuli. Evidence that the benzodiazepines prevent affective and cognitive processing under general anaesthesia and decrease traumatic postoperative recall of intra-operative events is reviewed. The explanatory value of modern theories of memory for research on benzodiazepine-induced amnesia, and the research potential of the surgical setting are outlined. The development of non-sedative anxiolytics and specific benzodiazepine antagonists provides the tools for assessing the contribution of sedative and anxiolytic properties of drugs to their amnesic effects.", 
    "19": "The benzodiazepines (BZs), represented by diazepam, are the class of drugs used most frequently to treat clinical anxiety disorders. Since it is known that acute BZ intake impairs memory function, the effects of BZs on memory were evaluated in chronic users of BZ medications. In addition, the acute effects of diazepam were compared with those of the non-BZ anxiolytic buspirone on memory function in anxious subjects. Memory function was evaluated by a free verbal recall procedure where subjects recalled a list of 16 noncategorized nouns immediately after the word list was read (immediate recall) and again 20 min later (delayed recall). When the chronic BZ users were tested for free verbal recall during their first visit, 4-14 h after their last dose, they did not differ in immediate or delayed recall from an age- and sex-matched group of unmedicated anxious subjects. At a subsequent visit, the acute effects of BZ medications were studied 60-90 min after the subjects took their usual dose. Although acute BZ administration did not alter immediate recall, delayed recall was significantly impaired in the chronic BZ users. Thus, complete tolerance does not develop to the acute memory-impairing effects of BZs after long-term use. Acute administration of the anxiolytic drugs diazepam (5 mg) or buspirone (5 or 10 mg) did not alter immediate recall in another group of unmedicated anxious subjects. Diazepam selectively impaired delayed recall of the word list when compared with placebo. In contrast, neither dose of buspirone altered delayed recall. To the extent that such effects on verbal recall tests are reflected in a patient's daily activities, the failure of buspirone to adversely affect memory function could contribute to its usefulness as an alternative antianxiety therapy.", 
    "20": "The effects of benzodiazepines on learning and memory are examined in the various clinical situations in which these drugs are used. Alterations in performance arising from the conditions for which benzodiazepines are prescribed are also considered. Current evidence indicates that, in anxious patients, as in normal volunteers, benzodiazepines impair the acquisition of new information (episodic memory). Although some tolerance may develop to these impairments, deficits are observed even after patients have been taking their medication chronically. Like amnesic patients, benzodiazepine-treated subjects may be unaware of their impaired ability to learn. The effects of the impairments on behavioral psychotherapies are considered.", 
    "21": "Evidence supporting the efficacy of beta blockers in anxiety is reviewed. Propranolol and oxprenolol are the most clearly established in efficacy. A placebo-controlled trial is described, in which propranolol and atenolol were both effective in the symptomatic treatment of generalized anxiety in patients who had been referred by their family doctors for specialist treatment. If initial psychological treatment for chronic anxiety is ineffective, and a drug is considered necessary, then a beta blocker or an antidepressant should be considered as first choice in preference to a benzodiazepine.", 
    "22": "Forty four subjects were treated for benzodiazepine dependence. The withdrawal programme lasted for 10 weeks and included regular group support sessions. Patients were also treated with either propranolol, placebo or \"no pill\" under double blind conditions. Twenty three patients complied with the full treatment regimen and completed the trial. The outcome of treatment was moderately successful, with 8 out of the 23 patients stopping their tranquilizers and a further 11 achieving a reduction of 50% or more of their original benzodiazepine dose. Tranquilizer dependence is a difficult condition to treat, but preliminary results suggest that propranolol is helpful in reducing the symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "23": "Clinical case reports, clinical series, and a small number of controlled studies provide evidence that many commonly prescribed psychiatric drugs may have untoward effects on sexual function. Both heterocyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors appear to be associated with ejaculatory impairment. Erectile dysfunction and retarded ejaculation have been associated with neuroleptics. Several benzodiazepines have been reported to interfere with ejaculation. This information has clear significance for the prescribing physician.", 
    "24": "The effects of the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist RO 15-1788 (3 mg/kg) on the anxiolytic properties of ethanol in mice confronted with a light/dark choice procedure and with the staircase test were investigated. RO 15-1788 reversed the effects of ethanol on some of the behavioural parameters without eliciting intrinsic effects when given alone. These data closely resemble those we previously obtained with several BZD receptor inverse agonists such as RO 15-3505, RO 15-4513 or beta-CCM. Since anxiogenic-like properties of low doses of RO 15-1788 have been identified by other authors, it is suggested that the antagonistic action of this drug against some of the behavioural effects of ethanol could be due to its being a partial BZD inverse agonist.", 
    "25": "The effects of lormetazepam (0.03 mg/kg IV) a benzodiazepine (BZ) derivative in combination with ZK 93 426 (0.04 mg/kg IV) a beta-carboline, benzodiazepine receptor antagonist were evaluated in humans. Independently, the effects of ZK 93 426 on its own were investigated. A psychometric test battery to evaluate sedation (visual analog scales (VAS), anxiolysis (state-trait-anxiety inventory scale (STAIG X1) and cognitive functions [logical reasoning test (LR), letter detection test (LD)] was applied before and several hours after initiation of treatment. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), which measures day time sleepiness, was also applied. Vigilosomnograms analysed from standard EEG recordings were evaluated shortly before and for 1 h after treatment. Treatment started with an intravenous injection of either lormetazepam (LMZ) or placebo (PLA), which was followed 30 min later by administration of either ZK 93 426 or placebo; thus four treatment groups were created (PLA + PLA, LMZ + PLA, LMZ + ZK 93 426 and PLA + ZK 93 426). ZK 93 426 antagonized the sedative and hypnotic effect of LMZ as estimated by MSLT and vigilosomnograms, respectively. Impairment of cognitive functions (LR and LD) induced by LMZ was also antagonized by ZK 93 426. ZK 93 426 had no effect on the changes in the time estimation seen in the LMZ group. Furthermore, ZK 93 426 on its own increased vigilance (alertness) as measured by the vigilosomnogram. A competitive antagonism at the benzodiazepine binding site between ZK 93 426 and LMZ is suggested by their combination effects; the intrinsic activity of ZK 93 426 seems to be due to its weak partial inverse agonist component.", 
    "26": "In male Tuck AHA rats, restraint stress had no effect on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the frontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and hippocampus, but produced a significant increase in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the amygdala after 120 and 180 min, and in the hypothalamus after 180 min. This apparent increase in turnover was not paralleled by a concomitant increase in the rate of 5-HT synthesis, as determined by measuring the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) following inhibition of amino acid decarboxylase with m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015). 5-HTP accumulation was, however, increased in the frontal cortex after 180 min. In naive rats, buspirone (0.1-2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in 5-HTP accumulation in all four brain regions, while chlordiazepoxide, in doses up to 10 mg/kg (s.c.) had no effect. The increase in 5-HT synthesis in the frontal cortex following 180 min restraint stress was inhibited by pretreatment with buspirone, when administered at 2.5 mg/kg (s.c.) 30 min prior to the stress period, but not by chlordiazepoxide at 10 mg/kg (s.c.).", 
    "27": "We have examined factors that alter the effect of diazepam (DZ) on plasma corticosterone (CS) in rats. DZ had a biphasic effect on plasma CS levels: CS decreased with doses below 5 mg/kg and increased with higher doses. Peak response occurred 90 minutes post injection in both sexes. Plasma DZ levels were significantly higher in females than in males and peak at 10 and 30 minutes post injection in males and females, respectively. There was also a sex difference in the pattern of DZ metabolites. An acute stressor (30 minutes of immobilization) did not affect plasma CS levels in rats injected with a 5 mg/kg dose of DZ. Prenatally stressed animals did not differ in basal CS levels or in their response to 5 mg/kg of DZ compared to prenatally non-stressed animals. These two groups of animals also did not differ in plasma levels of DZ or of its metabolites. By contrast, the 5 mg/kg dose of DZ had no effect on plasma testosterone levels in control animals, but increased it in prenatally stressed animals. Furthermore, compared to non-stressed controls, prenatally stressed animals had lower baseline plasma testosterone levels. These results indicate that the effect of DZ on plasma CS is influenced by endogenous as well as exogenous factors and that these effects vary with the particular biochemical parameter under examination.", 
    "28": "The effect of several benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam, Ro 5-4864, Ro 15-1788) and two pineal gland indoleamines (N-acetylserotonin, melatonin) on the spontaneous proliferation of mouse spleen lymphocytes was estimated in vitro by the 3 H-thymidine uptake assay. It was found that diazepam and Ro 5-4864 (a selective peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand) produced the concentration-dependent inhibition of 3 H-thymidine incorporation into the DNA of these cells. Ro 15-1788, a specific central-type receptor ligand, evoked a slight inhibitory effect in a high concentration (10(-4) M), whereas clonazepam did not produce any significant inhibition. When Ro 5-4864 was tested in combination with diazepam, the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation did not exceed the effect of diazepam given alone. Ro 15-1788 was unable to reverse the inhibitory action of diazepam in the same experimental conditions. Melatonin and its precursor N-acetylserotonin tested in the concentration range of 10(-4)-10(-8) M had no significant influence on the spleen lymphocyte DNA replication in our assay system. These data suggest that diazepam inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation is mediated by peripheral-type sites. Additionally, the fact that melatonin and N-acetylserotonin were unable to affect 3 h-thymidine incorporation argues against any benzodiazepine receptor mediated effect of pineal indoleamines on a cellular proliferation.", 
    "29": "The goal of this study was to focus on the adoption process for a specific new drug upon its introduction to the marketplace. The reception of temazepam by doctors was investigated in interviews with 124 specialists and general practitioners. Their response to this new drug at different stages of the adoption process was related to contact with drug information sources and to characteristics of the doctor and practice. Within about 13 months after its release, 71% were familiar with temazepam, 48% had prescribed it, and 27% now preferred it to the alternatives. Contact with the detailman regarding this drug was the most consistent predictor of favourable reception. Results suggest that the adoption of the new drug was related to commercial forces rather than to a doctor's professional involvements.",

The maximal number of M1 binding sites did not differ between age groups. 3. The dissociation constant of M1 binding was higher in old rats than in young rats. 4. The binding of 3H-L-nicotine did not differ between age groups. 5. The number of postsynaptic muscarinic receptors may be preserved, but the conformation of these receptors in the rat hippocampus may be altered during aging.",

Benzodiazepine has blocked the increase in oxygen consumption of warm acclimated rats on exposure to cold. 3. After cold acclimation, the benzodiazepine did not affect the increase in oxygen consumption. 4. Benzodiazepine caused a slight hypothermia when injected chronically, but did not affect rectal temperature over a short period of time.", 
    "32": "The different steps of ciliogenesis occurring in quail oviduct were compared to the ciliogenesis pattern described in other metazoan species. Centrioles are generated according to pathways that are found within the same cell: the centriolar and the acentriolar pathways. In the acentriolar pathway, centrioles are generated in the Golgi area, without contact with the preexisting centrioles of the centrosomes, and they migrate toward the apical membrane. The control of this polarized migration was studied by means of several drugs (colchicine, nocodazol, taxol, cytochalasin D, benzodiazepines) and immunocytochemistry. It was suggested that an actin-myosin system was involved in the migration of centrioles, whereas labile microtubules were not necessary. Basal bodies must dock with plasma membrane or cytoplasmic vesicles for the initiation of axonemal microtubule polymerization. This signal is necessary even in the presence of taxol.", 
    "33": "Benzodiazepine overdose is the most common of admission to the Toxicological Unit of the University of Florence. The aim of this study has been to evaluate the efficiency of Ro 15-1788 in benzodiazepine and mixed drug overdoses. The administration of Ro 15-1788 was followed by a quick reversal of central nervous system depression and was more effective in benzodiazepine overdoses than in mixed drug overdoses. The dose was titrated individually and the range 2-10 mg was effective according to the conditions of the patient. In some cases, the comatose state relapsed; further administration of Ro 15-1788 again promptly reversed the condition. On awakening, two patients displayed anxiety and restlessness.", 
    "34": "The efficacy and safety of the newly available benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788, Anexate) was prospectively evaluated in the treatment of 34 intoxicated patients. Twenty-three patients had attempted suicide with various drugs, and 11 suffered iatrogenic BDZ overdose. Following 0.2 mg i.v. flumazenil (Flu) injection, 22 patients intoxicated mainly with BDZ (11 iatrogenic and 11 intentional) regained full consciousness within two minutes, enabling even extubation of two. Eight patients required repeated boluses or continuous infusion of Flu to maintain alertness. Five patients with mixed drug intoxication awakened only briefly and relapsed into unconsciousness. In spite of Flu doses of up to 20 mg, no effect on consciousness was observed in 7 patients, intoxicated mainly with non-BDZ drugs. No significant side effects were noted attributable to Flu which has proved to be a safe and effective drug. It may be employed to achieve complete reversal of pure BDZ overdose, or for 'unmasking' the relative action of BDZ in mixed drug overdose. The danger of complications from drug overdose may thus be lessened, obviating the need for invasive interventions such as mechanical ventilation and invasive hemodynamic monitoring, at the same time decreasing risk and expense.", 
    "35": "Flumazenil (Flu) (Ro 15-1788, Anexate) is a newly synthetized specific benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist which was recently introduced for clinical study. The drug was intravenously injected, in titrated doses, to patients undergoing diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in order to reverse the sedative effects of BZDs. A total of 63 patients undergoing hand surgery under i.v. regional block, lower abdominal surgery under epidural anesthesia, cardiac catheterization, intracardiac catheter ablation, cardioversion, gastroscopy and bronchoscopy were studied. Flu in a dose ranging from 0.1 to 0.42 mg effectively reversed BZD-induced sedation in all patients 1-2 min following i.v. injection. Patients were fully awake and oriented yet calm and in good mood. Flu was well tolerated even in the high risk cardiac patients, with no significant changes in vital signs nor any sign of local irritation at the site of Flu injection. No significant resedation was observed. Thus Flu was very useful in reversing BZD-induced sedation or unconsciousness in a variety of clinical situations.", 
    "36": "The pharmacokinetics of a new 10 mg sublingual tablet formulation of temazepam and those of a currently marketed 10 mg oral capsule formulation were evaluated in a group of ten healthy volunteers. No significant differences were observed between the two formulations with respect to any of the pharmacokinetic parameters assessed. Lethargy and somnolence were reported on both capsule and tablet by several subjects at a time which corresponded with the maximum concentration of drug in plasma. The data indicate that the sublingual tablet and orally administered capsule have a similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile.", 
    "37": "In a double blind study including 18 patients in whom a benzodiazepine intoxication was suspected, the first specific benzodiazepine antagonist was compared to placebo. There was a highly significant effect on consciousness, all patients given antagonist awaked, usually within minutes. No adverse effects were observed. In 2 patients the clinical condition deteriorated 1 to 2 hrs after the antagonist was given. This might endanger intoxicated patients withdrawing from medical attention.", 
    "38": "In order to establish the current status of benzodiazepine prescribing and also to assess patients' attitudes towards the use of these drugs, we interviewed 450 consecutive patients in 16 community pharmacies about their use of benzodiazepines. Prescribing rates increased ten-fold from the age of 20 to 70 years and were higher in women than in men. The average dose used in the elderly seemed excessive and the choice of hypnotic often inappropriate. The median duration of benzodiazepine use was 2.5 years (range 0-25) and 66% of the patients had been taking benzodiazepines for one year or more. Most of the patients (97%) found the drugs effective in the treatment of anxiety or insomnia. Twenty-two percent took a lower dose than prescribed and 7.5% a higher dose. These data suggest that benzodiazepines are prescribed for excessively long periods and that greater caution is needed in prescribing benzodiazepines for older patients.", 
    "39": "Benzodiazepines are medications used to treat many of the most frequent and disturbing symptoms seen in medical practice, including anxiety, insomnia, muscle spasms, some forms of epilepsy, and other illnesses. The World Health Organization (WHO) has determined benzodiazepines to be \"essential drugs\" that should be available in all countries for medical purposes. As benzodiazepines were recognized as generally safe and effective drugs, their medical use increased but so did problems of abuse outside medical practice. This report focuses specifically on the nonmedical use, or abuse, of benzodiazepines for purposes, durations, or at dosage levels not intended by the prescribing physician or in ways outside medical guidelines. The principal contribution of this report to the resolution of the controversy about the use of benzodiazepines is to draw a sharp distinction between the medical use of these drugs and their nonmedical use, which this report labels \"abuse.\" Problems which exist with the medical use of benzodiazepines, such as their use by patients who are better treated with other medications (or without medication) and the problems of withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of medically prescribed benzodiazepines, are not addressed because these are problems of routine, legitimate medical practice. On the other hand, aspects of medical practice which affect nonmedical use of benzodiazepines are extensively dealt with in this report including the diversion of legitimately prescribed benzodiazepines into the illicit drug market and the prescribing of benzodiazepines for drug abusers. Extensive animal and human research has shown that benzodiazepines are \"reinforcing\" drugs in the sense that animals and humans will maintain behavior on which delivery of the drug is dependent. Animal studies of self-administration of potentially abused drugs show that benzodiazepines are less powerful reinforcers than intermediate half-life barbiturates (such as secobarbital) and psychomotor stimulants (such as amphetamine and cocaine). A substantial body of human research has shown that benzodiazepines are moderately \"liked\" for their reinforcing effects by drug abusers and alcoholic subjects but that both anxious people and normal (non-drug abusing, non-anxious) human subjects prefer placebo to benzodiazepines, demonstrating that these substances are usually not liked by people who are not drug abusers or alcoholics. Among drug abusers, benzodiazepines are preferred less than either intermediate half-life barbiturates or stimulants. This difference between the response of substance abusers and normal and anxious research subjects supports the fundamental distinction", 
    "40": "The available evidence concerning sexual side effects of psychiatric drugs suggests that inhibited female orgasm may be associated with the use of hetereocyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines, and neuroleptics. Possible mechanisms of action including anticholinergic, alpha adrenergic blockade, and serotonergic effects are discussed.", 
    "41": "1. It has been long suggested that central 5HT-mediated systems may be involved in modulation of anxiety and in the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines. However, recent evidence has questioned this hypothesis, particularly with respect to the mode of action of benzodiazepines. 2. Development of 5HT agonists and antagonists selective for different 5HT receptor sub-types (5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2, 5HT3) has opened a new avenue for investigation of the potential role of 5HT in anxiety. 3. Buspirone is clinically active in the treatment of anxiety and it, and other anxiolytic candidates, gepirone and isapirone, may act as agonists (or perhaps partial agonists) on 5HT1A receptors. 4. The prototype 5HT1A agonist 8OH-DPAT may also have potential anxiolytic effects. 5HT1A agonists may act to suppress the activity of 5HT neurones as a major part of their action. 5. Although there is some supporting evidence, there is no clear indication of anxiolytic activity with agonists with some selectivity for 5HT1B sites (RU24969, mCPP, TMPP). 6. A selective 5HT2 antagonist, ritanserin, has anxiolytic effects in clinical studies but, like the 5HT1A agonists, does not show a similar profile to benzodiazepines in models of anxiety. 7. This raises the question of clinical predictivity of the various models used. 8. A recently developed 5HT3 antagonist, GR38032F, has been claimed to possess potential anxiolytic activity but its mode of action in this respect requires further elucidation.", 
    "42": "The aim of this double-blind crossover trial was to compare the objective and subjective effects of flupentixol and lorazepam on human performance, and to reveal possible interactions between flupentixol and diazepam. Twelve healthy students received at 1-week intervals oral single doses of flupentixol 1 mg, flupentixol 2 mg, lorazepam 2.5 mg, placebo, and diazepam 15 mg alone and with flupentixol 1 mg. After the baseline measurements, the drugs were given in capsule form, and the tests were repeated 1.5, 3 and 4.5 h later. Diazepam was given at 1.5 h, to time its peak effect to coincide with that of lorazepam. Drug effects were measured objectively (two tracking tests, digit substitution, letter cancellation, flicker fusion, Maddox wing, tapping, memory) and subjectively (visual analogue scales, questionnaire). Blood samples were taken after each test time. Flupentixol 1 mg did not differ from placebo objectively or subjectively. Flupentixol 2 mg proved nearly inert objectively and on visual analogue scales. Lorazepam impaired objectively measured test performance, the clearest effects occurring at 3 and 4.5 h. It also impaired subjectively assessed performance. Diazepam impaired objective performance less than lorazepam, its effects peaking at 1.5 h after intake. Diazepam caused subjective drowsiness, clumsiness, mental slowness etc. as much as or more than lorazepam. The combination of 1 mg flupentixol and diazepam modified performance as much as diazepam alone. After the administration of 1 mg flupentixol, plasma concentrations were undetectable and levels after 2 mg were hardly detectable. Concentrations of lorazepam exceeded those of diazepam in direct bioassay, but they were much lower when bioassayed after solvent extraction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "43": "Exifone is a novel compound proposed for treating cognitive decline associated with age and shows corrective effects in animal models of memory dysfunction. The present experiments examined the antagonism by exifone of the amnesias induced in mice in a passive avoidance test by four benzodiazepines: bromazepam, diazepam, lorazepam and triazolam. Subsequent experiments investigated the specificity of exifone's antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced amnesia by examining its interaction with the effects of the benzodiazepines in the staircase test (anxiolytic/sedative activity) and the electroshock test (anticonvulsant activity). The results indicated that exifone clearly antagonised the amnesias induced by the four benzodiazepines, but was without intrinsic effects in the staircase or electroshock test and did not antagonise the effects of the benzodiazepines in these two tests. These results suggest that exifone might be useful for decreasing the amnesias induced by commonly used benzodiazepines without affecting their anxiolytic or anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "44": "The effects of clonidine on the antianxiety and sedation of benzodiazepines (BZD) were assessed respectively in rats trained in a two-lever diazepam cue discrimination procedure and in single-lever fixed-ratio (FR) water-reinforced performance. Clonidine (10-60 micrograms/kg) significantly shifted to the left the dose-effect curves of diazepam in the discrimination paradigm. This treatment also shifted generalization dose-effect curves of the diazepam cue to chlordiazepoxide and CL 218,872 to the left in the drug discrimination procedure. The diazepam cue was antagonized in a dose-related manner by Ro 15-1788, but not by bicuculline. Clonidine also potentiated the rate-decreasing effects of diazepam on the FR schedule when the dose of diazepam was increased to 0.3 mg/kg, but not the milder rate-decreasing effect of CL 218,872 until the dose of CL 218,872 was increased to 10 mg/kg. The potentiating effects of clonidine on the stimulus control and depression of diazepam were antagonized by yohimbine. Yohimbine (1.0 mg/kg) also significantly shifted the dose-effect curve of diazepam cue to the right. Bicuculline (3 mg/kg) completely antagonized the rate-decreasing effect of diazepam (1 mg/kg), but significantly potentiated the rate-suppressant effect of clonidine (10 micrograms/kg). These results suggest that the central noradrenaline (NA) system may be involved not only in the antianxiety, but also the sadative action of BZD. The nature of NA involvement in relation to the different subtypes of BZD receptors requires further exploration.", 
    "45": "More than 3.5 million patients suffer from anxiety in the United States of America alone. While our knowledge of the basic biological mechanisms of anxiety is very poor, we have a good understanding of the mechanism of action of various anxiolytic drugs at the molecular level. Their mechanism of action often relates to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA and it might be speculated that GABA has a role in anxiety. Future research will concentrate on designing better anxiolytic drugs, based for example on the discovery of partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and also on GABA uptake inhibitors as enhancers of GABAergic function. Furthermore, scientific studies will focus on a search for putative biological defects related to anxiety, such as defects in the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor chloride channel complex.", 
    "46": "Anxiety disorders are common conditions, often chronic, occurring in the general population with a prevalence of about 3%. Long-term use of tranquilizers varies from 0.5% of the total adult population in Sweden and 1.3% in Denmark to 3.1% in Great Britain and 5% in France. This use is tending to become more and more long-term. Long-term efficacy of benzodiazepine medication has not been established. Adverse effects include psychomotor and cognitive impairment, especially in the elderly; some, but not all, effects show tolerance. Some impairment can be demonstrated even after years of use. Rebound and withdrawal reactions after long-term use are common. Practical guidelines to minimize long-term use are suggested.", 
    "47": "The effects of flumazenil and physostigmine were studied in adult surgical patients recovering from midazolam-alfentanil anaesthesia. Thirty-two patients were anaesthetized with midazolam (0.2 mg kg-1 and 0.36-0.66 mg kg-1 h-1 by infusion) and alfentanil (0.15 mg kg-1 and 0.03-0.15 mg kg-1 h-1 by infusion), vecuronium, 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen, intubated and ventilated. The midazolam and alfentanil infusions were stopped at the end of surgery. Residual neuromuscular blockade and ventilatory depression were antagonized and the patients were extubated. In the recovery room, patients received either flumazenil 1 mg or physostigmine 2 mg i.v. over 10 min in a randomized, double-blind way. Before and up to 2 h after injection, patients were asked to perform two psychomotor tests. The degree of sedation and orientation in time and space were also determined. Seventeen patients received flumazenil and 15 patients received physostigmine. Before injection all patients were heavily sedated. After flumazenil, patients were fully awake within 6-7 min but sedation recurred 10-20 min later. After physostigmine, the degree of sedation did not change. The difference in the degree of sedation was significant until 30 min after injection. The time-course of test scores and orientation were similar to that of sedation. No serious side-effects or haemodynamic changes were observed after flumazenil. After physostigmine, seven patients had an increase in heart rate to 140 beats min-1 and blood pressure decreased in three patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Local anaesthetic systemic toxicity is a rare but often dramatic complication of regional anaesthesia. Convulsions often follow warning signs, easily recognized when looked for; but they may occur from the first. They are rapidly followed by hypoxia and hypercapnia which greatly enhance the risk of severe cardiac depression, mainly with bupivacaine or etidocaine. Thiopentone is able to stop convulsions quickly, but may further depress the cardiovascular system. Diazepam has been shown to be effective in the treatment of local anaesthetic-induced convulsions. It gives less myocardial depression, but is much slower in effect. Midazolam, a new short-acting benzodiazepine, should be the best choice. Should tracheal intubation become necessary, suxamethonium can be used. Indeed, the principal use of these drugs is to make ventilation easier, so as to restore rapidly correct oxygenation. Severe cardiac depression, often leading to cardiac arrest, may occur from the first or after the appearance of convulsions. It generally follows a regional block carried out with bupivacaine. A few antiarrhythmic drugs have been used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, either in experimental studies (lidocaine, bretylium) or after clinical accidents (lidocaine). Their efficacy and innocuity have to be proved before they can be proposed to treat these accidents. Bradycardia only needs treatment with atropine when it causes severe haemodynamic disturbances. When cardiac arrest occurs, cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be carried out; its mainstays are: oxygen, sodium bicarbonate, adrenaline, calcium and perhaps glucagon. This must be continued for a long time, as late successes have been published.", 
    "49": "Screening procedures for the detection of toxicologically relevant substances have become of ever-increasing importance due to the rapid development of new substances. Identification methods must be simple, sensitive, and practicable. This article describes standardized chromatographical (corrected Rcf values, retention indices) and immunological methods (enzyme-multiplied immunoassay technique, fluorescent polarization immunoassay) with special regard to the screening of some newer benzodiazepines, a class of substances that is still expanding. Some of these new compounds may be integrated in well-known screening procedures (via aminobenzophenones and detection by the Bratton-Marshall reagent); others require special concepts for detection. The problems are indicated and discussed, including the use of high-pressure-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry; recommendations are given.",

The characteristics of the patients are described. 2. 72% of patients accepted for benzodiazepine withdrawal had a history of previous psychiatric contact. They also had significantly higher scores on S.T.A.I. than control groups of non-psychotic psychiatric out-patients indicating a considerable psychiatric morbidity prior to withdrawal. 3. 12 patients were treated with psychological group therapy using anxiety management techniques. The outcome of this pilot study showed that 50% of subjects were able to discontinue their benzodiazepines despite previous failures. 4. Patients found learning to cope with symptoms, sharing problems with others and learning to change thoughts the most useful components of the anxiety management package during withdrawal.", 
    "51": "1. Evidence is presented which indicates that the central actions of the benzodiazepines cannot be fully accounted for by assuming an action only at the GABAA-Cl- channel supramolecular complex. 2. The hypothesis is presented, together with supporting evidence, that inhibition of adenosine uptake can account for many of the actions of the benzodiazepines. 3. New findings showing that Ro 15-1788 and Ro 5-4864 have both potentiative and antagonistic interactions with adenosine are discussed. 4. The proconvulsant beta-carbolines are shown to be adenosine antagonists. 5. The concept that benzodiazepine action may involve several mechanisms is presented.", 
    "52": "Both the real and sham intake of a 5% sucrose solution were increased by midazolam (3 mg/kg IP), a benzodiazepine agonist. In contrast, both the real and sham intakes of a 20% sucrose solution were reduced by Ro15-3505 (a benzodiazepine antagonist with weak inverse agonist properties) and by FG 7142 (a beta-carboline inverse agonist). These data demonstrate that drugs acting at benzodiazepine receptors can bi-directionally alter ingestional responses, probably by modulation of the oropharyngeal control of consumption.", 
    "53": "The anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, trimethadione, valproic acid and ethosuximide at pharmacologically relevant concentrations inhibit [3H]diazepam binding to astrocytes in primary cultures but have much less effect on a corresponding preparation of neurons. Phenytoin as well as pentobarbital (which is not used chronically as an anticonvulsant) are equipotent in the two cell types. The convulsants picrotoxinin and pentylenetetrazol, the convulsant benzodiazepine RO 5-3663 and the two convulsant barbiturates DMBB and CHEB similarly inhibit diazepam binding to astrocytes but have little effect on neurons. On the basis of these findings it is suggested that these convulsants and anticonvulsants owe at least part of their effect to an interaction with the astrocytic benzodiazepine receptor, perhaps by interference with a calcium channel.", 
    "54": "Two cases of severe tetanus admitted to ITU with muscle rigidity and convulsions and needed mechanical ventilation had a continuous infusion of vecuronium as muscle relaxant. The cardiovascular changes of the two patients are described. It is concluded that vecuronium because of its minimal cardiovascular effects is the relaxant of choice in the management of severe tetanus.",

There is a wide range of possible medicaments and combinations of these from among which the authors investigated combinations of the short-action opiates fentanyl and alfentanyl and midazolam, a benzodiazepine, short-action as well. These were tested for their effects on several circulatory parameters, intracranial pressure, wake-up behaviour, and selected hormonal parameters of mechanically ventilated patients. Both analgosedation schemes yielded best results, when compared to other combinations also continuously administered through perfusion. Individually adapted synchronisation of the patients to respirator and therapeutic concept proved to be practicable at any time, in spite of that fixed combination of analgetic with sedative.", 
    "56": "The review describes benzodiazepine receptor in CNS of mammalians. There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors--\"central\" and \"peripheral\" with different pharmacological properties.

    "57": "Benzodiazepines produce discriminative stimuli that are stereospecific and antagonized by specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. The potency of these stimuli correlate with the ability of these compounds to bind to the benzodiazepine receptor complex. These data indicate that benzodiazepine stimuli are transduced via the benzodiazepine receptor. The underlying basis of these stimuli is unclear. Results with novel compounds that produce preclinical anxiolytic effects without the sedation and muscle relaxation of the classical benzodiazepines suggest that muscle relaxation may contribute to these stimuli. A direct comparison of discriminative stimuli established on a classical benzodiazepine agonist with the stimuli established on a partial benzodiazepine agonist supports the possibility that the classical benzodiazepine cue is mediated by a muscle relaxant effect, while the partial agonist cue is related to the anxioselectivity of the compound.", 
    "58": "In the first set of experiments rats were trained to discriminate a dose of 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide from saline. The chlordiazepoxide cue was antagonized by flumazepil (Ro 15-1788) and by CGS 8216, and generalized to a variety of anxiolytic and sedative drugs including the benzodiazepine receptor ligands zopiclone, suriclone, CL 218,872, CGS 9896, and ZK 91296. The novel imidazopyridine hypnotic, zolpidem, which also displaces benzodiazepines from their binding sites, failed to produce high levels of responding on the chlordiazepoxide-associated level except at a dose which greatly reduced rates of lever pressing. In further experiments rats were trained to discriminate a dose of 2 mg/kg zolpidem from saline. This dose produced reductions in response rates but an attempt to establish a lower dose of zolpidem as a discriminative stimulus was largely unsuccessful. Zolpidem-appropriate responding was produced by pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, triazolam, CL 218,872, clorazepate, lorazepam, quazepam, and zopiclone but only at doses which reduced response rates. The zolpidem cue was antagonized by flumazepil, CGS 9896, and ZK 91296. While the discriminative stimulus produced by chlordiazepoxide may be related to its anxiolytic action, the zolpidem stimulus is probably more closely associated with sedation. It was also tentatively concluded that the stimulus properties of chlordiazepoxide and zolpidem are produced by activity at different subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors.",

The naturally occurring change in latency of the digastric reflex from long (40-70 msec) to short (15-35 msec) in the first week of life was studied in rabbits using drugs known to affect GABAergic and glycinergic transmission. 2. Usually the long or the short latency reflex response appeared alone but after strychnine both appeared together. 3. The long latency responses were favoured by the GABA blockers bicuculline and picrotoxin; periodically rhythmic activity was also elicited. 4.

At resting state (nondepolarized) such an effect manifested as a reduction of 14C-choline uptake in a short term (1 min) uptake experiment. 3. At depolarized state, or under conditions where synaptosomes are subjected to osmotic, aging and other stress conditions, deltamethrin caused stimulation of 14C-choline uptake, resulting in elevation of the levels of total radiocarbons in synaptosomes. 4. Such changes are accompanied with changes in overall phosphorylation activities in synaptosomes.", 
    "61": "The effects of ACTH4-10 and ACTH1-24 on L-[3H]glutamate (Glu) binding sites and GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin receptor complexes in vitro were investigated. ACTH4-10 and ACTH1-24 inhibited [3H] Glu and [3H] muscimol binding concentration-dependently, while [3H] flunitrazepam (FNP) and [35S] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding were not affected. These ACTH fragments also inhibited GABA-stimulated [3H] FNP binding. These results suggest that ACTH and its fragments may act as anticonvulsants by antagonizing glutamate binding, their interaction with GABA-A sites may relate to the other central nervous effects of ACTH than the anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "62": "1. Using [3H]antidepressants, high affinity binding sites associated with the neuronal transporter for serotonin, noradrenaline, dopamine and adrenaline have been identified. 2. The association of high affinity [3H]imipramine binding with the serotonin transporter in brain and platelets is well established. Although the exact relationship between the [3H]imipramine recognition site and the serotonin transporter remains to be elucidated, it appears that the [3H]imipramine labelled component of the serotonin transporter represents a novel receptor that functions to modulate serotonin uptake. 3. Most data available to date support the hypothesis that [3H]imipramine binding to platelet represents a biological marker in depression. The majority of studies indicate that the Bmax of platelet [3H]imipramine binding is lower in depressed, untreated patients than in the control population and that this finding is relatively specific to depression. 4. Among the [3H]antidepressant binding sites associated with the other monoaminergic transporters, the recent identification of [3H]desipramine binding to the neuronal transporter for adrenaline offers novel perspectives. Thus, given the high affinity for [3H]desipramine binding to the adrenaline transporter in the frog heart for not only desipramine but also imipramine and the atypical antidepressants mianserin and iprindol, it is possible that an interaction with the adrenaline transporter is of significance to the clinical effects of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "63": "A double-blind controlled trial was carried out in 50 patients with anxiety neuroses to compare the effectiveness of metaclazepam, a recently developed benzodiazepine with anxiolytic activity, and bromazepam. Patients were allocated at random to receive treatment for 13 days with either 15 mg metaclazepam or 4 mg bromazepam per day, in 2 divided doses. The patients' anxiety status was assessed on entry and after 7 and 13 days of treatment by the physician, using the Hamilton multi-factorial rating scale, and by the patients, using a self-assessment rating scale. Both drugs produced a highly significant reduction in mean total scores, improvement being evident by the Day 7 assessment. Correlation between scores on the two scales was significant at all time points. Metaclazepam, however, was rated as producing a significantly greater improvement from baseline than with bromazepam on the self-rating scale.",

    "65": "Muscarinic, slow postsynaptic potentials (s-epsp and s-ipsp) in the rabbit superior cervical ganglia were shown to be differentially depressed by a novel cardioselective M2-type antagonist AF-DX 116: it antagonized the s-ipsp with IC50 value of 1.5 X 10(-7) M, which is 16-fold more potent in depressing the s-ipsp than the s-epsp. A hyperpolarizing component in the biphasic potential changes induced by a muscarinic agonist, methacholine, was selectively eliminated by this antagonist. AF-DX 116 was thus shown to be an useful tool for discriminating the M2-type muscarinic responses from those of M1-type in the nervous system.",

The (-)-isomer of each of the above drugs was more potent than the (+)-form in inhibiting the binding of [3H]MeTRH to brain membranes, whereas the (+/-)-forms had activity intermediate between (-)- and (+)-forms. The order of activity of kappa-ligands was tifluadom greater than MR 2266 greater than ketocyclazocine. It is concluded that kappa-opiate drugs inhibit the binding of [3H]MeTRH to brain membranes in a stereoselective manner with tifluadom being the most potent drug.", 
    "67": "The presence of an imidazole moiety in the chemical structure of denzimol and nafimidone suggested that these new anticonvulsants might interfere with cytochrome P450-mediated mixed function monooxygenase activities. We therefore investigated their ability to bind reversibly to rat liver cytochrome P450. Both drugs displayed a type II spectra. The Ks values of binding were 6.66 and 7.00 mM, respectively, for denzimol and nafimidone. In other in-vitro studies the IC50 of the inhibition caused by denzimol and nafimidone was determined on carbamazepine (CBZ) epoxidation and diazepam C3-hydroxylation and N1-dealkylation. The IC50 values for CBZ epoxidation were 4.46 x 10(-7) and 2.95 x 10(-7) M, respectively, in the presence of denzimol and nafimidone. The IC50 values for diazepam C3-hydroxylation were 1.44 x 10(-6) and 1.00 x 10(-6) M, respectively, and those for N1-dealkylation 6.66 x 10(-7) and 5.95 x 10(-7) M. The inhibition of CBZ metabolism was also investigated ex-vivo and in-vivo after single oral doses (15 and/or 60 mg kg-1) of denzimol or nafimidone. Inhibition of CBZ-10,11-epoxidation by the two drugs was time- and dose-dependent. Further studies in-vivo showed that denzimol and nafimidone prolong pentobarbitone sleeping times indicating that both drugs bind to rat liver microsomes and are potent inhibitors in the rat of mixed function monooxygense activities both in-vitro and in-vivo.", 
    "68": "We have reviewed the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines employed as adjuncts to cancer treatment. These agents have been used primarily for alleviating or attenuating situational anxiety, insomnia, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and anticipatory nausea and vomiting. Situational anxiety not corrected by psychosocial support, symptom control, or time may be successfully treated with benzodiazepines. Procedure-related anxiety, for example, that related to bone marrow biopsy, venipuncture, intrathecal therapy, and the insertion of subclavian and femoral catheters, is a serious problem that may be alleviated by the use of benzodiazepines. Insomnia not caused by a depression serious enough to warrant treatment with a tricyclic antidepressant also may be successfully treated with benzodiazepines. Many clinicians have found benzodiazepines to be useful adjuncts to a cancer chemotherapy regimen because of their anxiolytic, sedative, and amnesic properties and also because of their suspected antiemetic properties when these drugs are used in conjunction with known antiemetic agents. The ability of lorazepam to induce antegrade amnesia has proved particularly useful in alleviating anticipatory nausea and vomiting connected with repeated courses of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Furthermore, since benzodiazepines are relatively safe drugs, their continued and probably expanded uses as cancer therapy adjuncts can be anticipated.", 
    "69": "1. After 30 years of psychopharmacological therapy we are able to identify some aspects which can be referred to a \"collateral behavioural effect\". The apparent rarity of this depends on the facility of confusing behavioural modifications (often sine materia), with patological ones (normally of a physical nature). 2. Memory, learning, the ability of evoking, problems regarding reality, paradoxical reactions, \"makefobic\" behaviour, passivity and social and behavioural withdrawal, form part of the Human Behavioural Pharmacotoxicology. 3. This ought to deserve greater attention on the part both of research workers and health authorities.", 
    "70": "The antagonistic effects of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist beta-CCM (1 mg/kg) and of the partial inverse agonist RO 15-3505 (3 mg/kg) on the anxiolytic properties of ethanol (1 g/kg) in mice confronted with a light/dark choice procedure and with the staircase test were investigated. Both drugs reversed the effects of ethanol on some of the behavioral parameters, but beta-CCM alone elicited anxiogenic intrinsic effects. RO 15-3505 induced seizures in mice treated with a subconvulsant dose of pentylenetetrazole, the most efficient doses being 3 and 6 mg/kg. These data indicate that beta-CCM and RO 15-3505 can reverse some of the anxiolytic effects of ethanol, acting probably to oppose GABA function via the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "71": "Six healthy, fasting volunteers were given single doses of chlordesmethyldiazepam by 1 mg i.v., or as drops or tablets. Chlordesmethyldiazepam and its metabolite, lorazepam, in multiple plasma samples and in urine collected for 120 h after each dose were determined by electron-capture GLC. Mean kinetic variables for intravenous chlordesmethyldiazepam were: volume of distribution, 1.71 l.kg-1; elimination half-life, 113 h; total clearance, 0.21 ml.min-1.kg-1; cumulative excretion of lorazepam glucuronide 24.2% of the dose. Following a lag time of 15.5 min (tablets) and 4.2 min (drops), which were significantly different, the absorption of oral chlordesmethyldiazepam was a first order process, with apparent absorption half-life values averaging 1.5 h (tablets) and 1.1 h (drops). Bioavailability was 77% for tablets and 79% for drops."
