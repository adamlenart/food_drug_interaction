    "0": "Bromocriptine (2-Br-alpha-ergocryptine), a partial ergoline derivative, is a dopamine agonist which has been used successfully in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly and Parkinson's disease. The main targets for the action of the drug are the hypothalamic, hypophyseal pathway and the striatum. These regions contain different populations of neurons which interact with each other in a complex way. In order to check the mechanism of these interactions in rats, we administered different neuroactive drugs together with bromocriptine. After a single intraperitoneal injection, bromocriptine concentration in the striatum was 13.1 +/- 2.9 ng/mg protein, and in the hypothalamus 13.9 +/- 0.8 ng/mg protein. The largest increase in the bromocriptine content in the striatum was found after the concomitant administration of naloxone, an opiate receptor blocker (21.2 +/- 2.5 ng/mg protein). The largest increase of the bromocriptine content in the hypothalamus was found after the concomitant injection of methysergide, a serotonin receptor blocker (27.8 +/- 2.6 ng/mg protein). Amantadine, diazepam and haloperidol caused the largest decrease in the two regions. The mechanism of interaction and therapeutic implication of these findings are discussed.", 
    "1": "Saccadic eye movements and the subjective assessments of the volunteers were used in the determination of the residual effects of a single evening dose of flunitrazepam 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg or placebo. Sleep inducing and maintaining effects were subjectively assessed, too. Flunitrazepam at all three dose levels possessed sleep inducing and increasing effects (n = 9), but in the number of nocturnal awakenings and sedation in the morning (10 hrs after drug intake), no significant differences between placebo and the active medications were reported. However, saccadic eye movement recording could differentiate the residual effects produced by placebo or the active medication. No correlation was detected between the serum levels (radioreceptor assay) and saccadic eye movement recordings.", 
    "2": "The effect of lorazepam and methylphenidate on the ERPs and power spectral analysis was studied. Lorazepam caused prolonged latency and decreased amplitude of N200 and P300. This result suggests that lorazepam affects the neural processing of cognitive function. The drowsiness induced by lorazepam correlated inversely with alpha frequency power, but had no direct correlation with fast activity. On the contrary, when methylphenidate was given, there was no change in ERPs. There was an increase in percent alpha frequency correlated with the alertness of the subjects. An analysis of variance involving the factors of drug and time of rating showed that subjects showed a significant (p less than 0.0001) decrease in alertness over time while receiving lorazepam, and a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in alertness over time while receiving methylphenidate.", 
    "3": "Different dosing regimens with diazepam were evaluated in male Fischer 344 rats for their ability to enhance the metabolism of several inhalation anesthetics. In vitro metabolism was assessed by the rate of microsomal anesthetic defluorination as measured by the appearance of inorganic fluoride ion (i.e., defluorinase activity). Single daily doses of diazepam, 40 mg/kg, were delivered by gavage for either 7 or 14 days; more continuous dosing was achieved by administration of diazepam at 0.03% or 0.10% in food pellets. Hepatic microsomes isolated from treated rats showed significant dose-related elevations in methoxyflurane defluorinase activity, but not in enflurane or isoflurane defluorinase activities. The microsomal content of cytochromes P-450 and b5 and the NADPH-cytochrome-c-reductase activity was not significantly different among treated and untreated groups. Para-nitroanisole O-demethylase activity expressed per nmole cytochrome P-450 increased in the diazepam-treated groups. Extrapolation of these animal data to humans suggests that surgical patients treated chronically with diazepam are probably not at increased risk for inorganic fluoride-induced nephrotoxicity due to increased metabolism of the fluorinated inhalation anesthetics.", 
    "4": "The effects of cimetidine and ranitidine on plasma levels of amitriptyline and chlordiazepoxide were examined in a biphasic study with 12 young male volunteers. During the first phase all subjects received a fixed combination of 2 X amitriptyline (25 mg) and chlordiazepoxide (10 mg) daily for one week. After the last dose blood samples were drawn up to 72 hours in order to detect plasma levels of the drugs and their main metabolites. Following a wash-out-period of 7 days two groups of 6 subjects, each were formed in a randomized order. In addition to the mentioned medication 3 X 200 mg plus 1 X 400 mg of cimetidine daily or 2 X 150 mg of ranitidine daily were administered for one week. After discontinuation of amitriptyline/chlordiazepoxide the medication with H2-blockers was kept and blood samples were collected again for plasma analysis. Plasma level detections were carried out employing HPLC. The change of the area under the plasma level-time curve (AUC), total clearance and terminal half-life served as parameters indicating interaction. Under treatment with cimetidine plasma levels of amitriptyline and chlordiazepoxide were significantly (5%) increased, whereas such effects could not be observed with ranitidine. Due to these interactions under the conditions of coadministration of H2-blockers and amitriptyline and/or chlordiazepoxide the use of ranitidine is recommended.", 
    "5": "Chronic administration of benzodiazepines is known to increase food intake in numerous species. But this effect has been studied only after a unique daily injection and over a short part of the 24 hr cycle. In the present study, during 28 days, drugs were administered to rats receiving ordinary chow or a highly palatable diet (cafeteria diet): diazepam (DZ) (2.5 mg/kg IP) twice a day, or brotizolam (BR) (1 mg/kg IP), a longer acting compound, once a day. In the chow fed rats, DZ and BR provoked a post injection hyperphagia throughout the study, followed by a compensatory hypophagia resulting in 24 hr food intakes not different from those of controls; conversely neither body weight nor weight of fat pads were increased. The cafeteria diet provoked hyperphagia and overweight. DZ did not induce any supplementary hyperphagia. BR provoked a post injection hyperphagia, also compensated in time, resulting again in 24 hr food intakes, body weight gains and weight of fat pads not increased compared to those of cafeteria controls. Thus in the rat, benzodiazepine treatment increases food intake, but only acutely, and does not provoke any trend toward obesity.", 
    "6": "Rats were tested for tail-flick responses and then immediately subjected to footshock for 30 sec. This procedure induced analgesia, i.e. prolonged the latency of the tail-flick response, which was maximal immediately after the shock and decayed to normal levels within 2 hr. No analgesia occurred if either the analgesia test before the shock or the shock itself was omitted. The dependence of the analgesia on the association between the test before the shock plus the shock, suggests that this was a form of avoidance learning. The effects of drugs injected immediately after the shock were determined on latency of the tail-flick response, measured 2 hr later. Drugs known to improve memory, including physostigmine, pramiracetam and the muscarinic agonists, oxotremorine and RS 86, selectively induced analgesia in rats subjected to test before the shock plus the shock, thereby supporting a hypothesis of avoidance learning. Neostigmine and atropine methyl nitrate had no effect, indicating that the effects were mediated centrally. The learning effects were distinguishable from analgesia induced by drugs, since morphine increased analgesia regardless of the presence or absence of the test before shock or the shock. Also, naloxone, which had no effect per se, blocked analgesia induced by morphine but enhanced physostigmine-induced analgesia. Neither chlordiazepoxide nor D-amphetamine produced any changes in the latency of the tail-flick responses indicating that neither anxiolytic/muscle relaxant nor stimulant actions were involved.", 
    "7": "Acute administration of N6(L-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (L-PIA; 0.01-0.178 mg/kg, s.c.), N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA; 0.01-0.178 mg/kg, s.c.), 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA; 0.32-0.56 mg/kg, s.c.), N6-cycloheptyladenosine (CHPA; 0.032-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.), N6-phenyladenosine (PA; 0.1-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.), N6(D-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (D-PIA; 0.32-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and N6-benzyladenosine (BA; 1.0-17.8 mg/kg, s.c.) produced dose-related decreases in responding under a fixed-ratio (FR) schedule of food reinforcement. Dose-effect curves were determined by administering cumulative doses (s.c.) during periods that preceded the sequential components of the schedule. Neither 2-chloroadenine arabinoside (2-CAB) nor 2',5'-dideoxyadenosine (2',5'-DDA) altered fixed-ratio responding at the doses studied (0.1-3.2 and 1.0 and 3.2, respectively). Caffeine (0.32 and 3.2 mg/kg) antagonized the behavioral effects of L-PIA in a dose-related, surmountable manner. Daily administration of L-PIA (0.1 mg/kg) resulted in the development of tolerance to the effects of L-PIA decreasing rate and cross-tolerance to other analogs of adenosine (CHA, BA, D-PIA). No cross-tolerance was produced to caffeine, levorphanol or chlordiazepoxide. The activity and order of potency of the analogs of adenosine tested were consistent with the effects of agonists at A1 adenosine receptors. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the behavioral effects of N6- and 2-chlorine-substituted analogs of adenosine probably act through similar CNS mechanism(s).", 
    "8": "In genetically-photosensitive epileptic chickens, the anti-parasitic agent ivermectin, at 1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg, decreased or prevented seizures induced by intermittent photic stimulation without any side-effects on the central nervous system. The latency and duration of this anti-convulsant effect was dose-dependent. When combined with diazepam, ivermectin prolonged the anti-convulsant action of diazepam.", 
    "9": "Fifty patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks with treated with clonazepam, a high potency benzodiazepine. The authors report on the outcome of these patients after an average follow-up interval of 1 year, suggesting that clonazepam is a safe, effective, and easy to administer medication in a relatively treatment-refractory population of nondepressed patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.", 
    "10": "The effect of erythromycin on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam was studied in 16 normal male volunteers. Triazolam in 0.5-mg doses was administered alone and after 3 days of receiving erythromycin (333 mg tid) in a randomized complete crossover design. Plasma samples were collected for 24 hours post doses and analyzed for triazolam by electron-capture gas chromatography. Erythromycin administration resulted in a 52% decrease in triazolam clearance, significantly higher triazolam concentrations at the majority of sampling times, significantly longer triazolam half-lives of elimination (5.9 vs. 3.6 hours), and a 30% decrease in the triazolam apparent volume of distribution. No differences were observed in the times of peak triazolam concentration occurrence. In accordance with previously reported drug interactions involving macrolide antibiotics, erythromycin appears to significantly inhibit the metabolism of triazolam.", 
    "11": "Alprazolam kinetics following a single 1.0-mg oral dose of alprazolam were compared between seven dialysis-dependent patients with chronic renal failure and seven healthy controls matched for age, sex, and weight. There were no significant differences between patients and controls in alprazolam half-life (11.5 vs. 11.3 hours) or clearance of total drug (1.14 vs. 1.26 ml/min/kg). However, alprazolam free fraction was increased in renal failure patients (35.7% vs. 31.9% unbound, p less than 0.005). Free clearance of alprazolam averaged 23% lower in patients (3.2 vs. 4.1 ml/min/kg), but the difference was not significant. Renal insufficiency has a quantitatively small influence on alprazolam pharmacokinetics.", 
    "12": "The authors conducted a prospective study in 90 patients undergoing upper endoscopic examination under sedation to determine whether there was any beneficial effect in anesthetizing the pharynx with topical anesthesia. These patients were divided into three groups of 30 patients. Group A received 39 ml of viscous lidocaine gargle (2%) diluted with 15 ml of tap water. Group B received the placebo. Group C received neither viscous lidocaine nor placebo. All patients received intravenous meperidine and diazepam titrated to produce adequate sedation for upper endoscopy. It was demonstrated that the undesirable effects of upper endoscopy, that is, gagging, sore throat, and dysphagia, did not differ significantly in any of the three study groups as evaluated by either the patients or the endoscopist. Only two patients complained that the procedure was mildly unpleasant. The authors conclude that the practice of anesthetizing the pharynx in patients receiving sedation for upper endoscopy should be abandoned since anesthesia of the pharynx is not exempt from morbidity and mortality as well as being time-consuming and expensive.", 
    "13": "Midazolam was given, by infusion, for the sedation of 10 children receiving intensive care after cardiac surgery. Plasma concentrations greater than 250 ng ml-1 were required for adequate sedation. Midazolam did not cumulate in eight of the 10 children, and these patients excreted the drug in a fashion similar to that by adults. However, midazolam did accumulate in two children, one with profound hepatic disturbance. In one of these patients recovery was slow following cessation of the infusion.", 
    "14": "Lorazepam (Ativan) and Fentanyl (Sublimaze) given in small doses during surgery not only achieve excellent intraoperative sedation and patient cooperation, but also significantly reduce recall and recognition of events during the surgery for as long as 3 hours after the surgery. Included is a series of 814 patients in whom this protocol was used between 1981 and 1984 with a 94 percent patient postoperative follow-up. With this protocol there have been no known complications, and patient reactions have been unanimously favorable.", 
    "15": "The kinetics of specific [35S]-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding was studied in rat brain synaptosomal membrane preparations. The effects of a representative depressant barbiturate, R-(-)-N-(1)-Me-5-Phe-5-Pr-barbituric acid [R(-)MPPB, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were biphasic on TBPS binding, but the enhancements of binding by low concentrations of R(-)MPPB or GABA disappeared when binding equilibrium was reached. The slope factors of TBPS displacement and the IC50 values of R(-)MPPB and GABA decreased when TBPS binding approached equilibrium. Up to 70 min, binding in the presence of 300 microM R(-)MPPB exceeded, then remained below, the level of the control. R(-)MPPB decreased the apparent association half-life of TBPS binding from 41.5 min to 11.9 min. The GABA agonist, muscimol, in the concentration range of 20 and 200 nM, progressively accelerated the rate of TBPS dissociation. This effect was completely reversed by 20 microM bicuculline methochloride. GABA antagonists, bicuculline methochloride (20 microM) and R 5135 (20 nM), alone decelerated the rate of TBPS dissociation. Dissociation of TBPS was also initiated by dilution in the presence of various salts. Replacement of Cl- by Br- ions (0.5 molar) accelerated the rate of dissociation, whereas replacement of K+ by Na+ ions had no effect. This indicates the role of Eccles anions, not of cations, in TBPS binding and the possible involvement of the chloride inophore. A kinetic model is discussed for the allosteric modulation of TBPS binding by various GABAergic agents. Interconvertible populations of TBPS sites are proposed with rapid and slow kinetics. Model calculations involving modulation in the same direction of the on and off rates of binding can reproduce observed phenomena. The model predicts that GABA agonists, barbiturate and pyrazolopyridine depressants, as well as 1,4-benzodiazepine agonists, would allosterically increase the proportion of a rapid kinetic population of TBPS sites. In contrast, the model predicts that a decrease in the contribution of the rapid phase might be brought about by GABA antagonists and beta-carboline inverse agonists. The slow and rapid kinetic populations of TBPS sites might represent the closed and open states of the chloride ionophores, respectively.", 
    "16": "Seventeen analogues of the selective, competitive cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist asperlicin 1 were prepared. These compounds were tested as inhibitors of the binding of [125I]CCK to rat pancreas and guinea pig brain receptors. Compounds 4, 7, and 8 were more potent than asperlicin on the pancreatic CCK receptor. One analogue, 17, displayed potency equivalent to asperlicin on the pancreas CCK receptor and showed a marked improvement in aqueous solubility, thereby facilitating the use of this class of CCK antagonists in physiological and pharmacological studies.", 
    "17": "Three agitated, confused, elderly patients with organic brain syndromes were successfully treated with low-dose clonazepam. Plausible mechanisms of action include its influence on serotonin levels and seizure threshold.", 
    "18": "Five healthy elderly volunteers aged 64 to 67 years and 12 healthy young subjects aged 23 to 44 years received single 30 mg oral doses of oxazepam in two different dosage forms (two 15 mg tablets or one 30 mg capsule) on two occasions in a random crossover sequence, with at least 1 week elapsing between trials. In both age groups, rate of oxazepam absorption of the capsule form of the drug was significantly slower than that of the tablets. Peak plasma concentrations were lower and were delayed longer with the capsule form; however, the relative extent of oxazepam absorption did not differ between preparations in either age group. Clinical self-ratings in the elderly group, based on visual analog scales, were consistent with the delayed onset of sedative effects that is associated with the capsule form of administration. Kinetic comparisons in the two groups indicated a significantly prolonged oxazepam elimination half-life with the tablet (p less than .001) and with the capsule (p less than .06) and a trend (p less than .08) toward reduced oxazepam clearance in the elderly. The delayed absorption of oxazepam from the capsule was found in both the young and elderly groups.", 
    "19": "A novel model of status epilepticus based on the kindling model of epilepsy is described. The model involves the administration of a small dose of pilocarpine (20 mg/kg) to rats that have been previously kindled. Stimulation of these pretreated rats produces seizures which continue uninterrupted for approximately 4 h before spontaneous termination. The electroencephalographic discharge pattern showed characteristic changes in polarity and amplitude throughout the duration of status epilepticus. Behaviorally, the animals showed motor seizures which varied between stages I through IV, with evidence of extensive bilateral hemispheric involvement through much of the seizure episode. Animals that had been partially kindled to stage II seizures did not develop status epilepticus after stimulation when pretreated with pilocarpine, indicating that prior kindling is integral to the development of status epilepticus in this model. Administration of scopolamine was ineffective in terminating the condition when it had begun, suggesting that cholinergic stimulation is necessary for the initiation, but not the maintenance, of status epilepticus. This model holds promise for the study of status epilepticus because the condition develops in a seizure-prone (kindled) rat, and the seizures are self-sustaining, without the presence of exogenous chemicals or neurotoxins.", 
    "20": "We observed 37 patients (mean age at onset, 48.5 years; range, 13 to 84 years) with segmental myoclonus (18 branchial, 19 spinal). Etiologies for branchial myoclonus included brain-stem demyelination, cerebrovascular disease, Meige's syndrome, cerebral arteritis secondary to bacterial meningitis, central nervous system Whipple's disease, acute cervicomedullary trauma, and cerebellar degeneration. Spinal myoclonus was associated with laminectomy, remote effect of cancer, spinal cord injury, post-operative pseudomeningocele, laparotomy, thoracic sympathectomy, poliomyelitis, herpes myelitis, lumbosacral radiculopathy, spinal extradural block, and myelopathy due to demyelination, electrical injury, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and cervical spondylosis. The latency between the predisposing condition and the onset of myoclonus ranged from immediate to 33 years (mean, 2.9 years). In six patients, the myoclonus was the presenting symptom of a serious underlying disease. Treatment with clonazepam, tetrabenazine hydrochloride, or other medications provides a satisfactory control in most patients.", 
    "21": "Seven neonatal patients with severe seizures unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsant therapy were treated with lorazepam. Immediate cessation of seizure activity occurred in all patients within five minutes. Although seizures recurred in two infants eight hours later, frequency and severity diminished. There were no apparent significant side effects attributed to the medication.", 
    "22": "Neothramycin (NTM), an anthramycin-group anticancer antibiotic, was used in the treatment of superficial carcinoma of the bladder. NTM was instilled into the bladder in the following dosages. Ten mg NTM in 20 ml of sterile distilled water was given first, and increased to 40 mg in 20 ml. This procedure was performed every second week to twice a day. Recently, in 2 patients, the treatment has been combined with 20 mg NTM intravenous administration. In 4 of the 11 patients (36%) the tumors disappeared completely, while in 6 patients (55%) there was partial disappearance of more than 50% and in one patient (9%) there was no effect. Three of the patients had irritable bladder symptom (temporarily). NTM was concluded to be effective for superficial carcinoma of the bladder.", 
    "23": "Aminophylline in a low dose has been shown to reverse diazepam sedation. The present investigation was performed as a double-blind study to compare the effects of aminophylline and enprofylline on deep diazepam sedation after surgery. Enprofylline is a xanthine derivative with anti-asthmatic effect but, in contrast to aminophylline, enprofylline has very weak adenosine antagonistic properties. A comparison should make it possible to evaluate if adenosine is involved in the observed effects. Twenty male patients undergoing transurethral surgery in spinal anaesthesia were given diazepam during surgery to maintain a state of deep sedation. Postoperatively aminophylline or enprofylline was given from coded ampoules in equipotent anti-asthmatic doses (4.5 or 1.5 mg/kg). The degree of sedation was assessed prior to and after the injections. A difference between the groups was obvious. Patients given aminophylline showed rapid reversal of sedation, persisting throughout the 2-h observation period. Following enprofylline, a markedly slower reversal of sedation was observed. It is likely that aminophylline antagonises diazepam sedation by blocking adenosine receptors. Some clinical implications are outlined.", 
    "24": "The most common sign of febrile diseases is anorexia, which develops at a time when adequate caloric and micronutrient availability may be critical. In order to study the relationship of fever and anorexia, feed intake in dwarf goats was studied under conditions of fever and antipyresis. Furthermore, experiments were done to establish whether a feed intake stimulant would override the anorexia during febrile conditions. Infection with Ehrlichia phagocytophila and i.v. injection of Escherichia coli endotoxin (0(111) B4, 0.1 microgram/kg body weight) both resulted in increased rectal temperatures and significant reductions in feed intake. Administration of the antipyretic drug flurbiprofen (1 mg/kg) to febrile animals inhibited the temperature responses, but food intake was still suppressed. Diazepam (0.06 mg/kg), a feed intake stimulant, did not override the anorexia associated with fever. Blocking the febrile response of E. coli LPS-injected goats with flurbiprofen plus diazepam or with flurbiprofen plus naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) did not antagonise their reduced feed intake either. The effects of these drugs and of endotoxin on rumen motility adds an interesting aspect to their activities in the CNS, since the CNS has been shown to regulate various aspects of forestomach motility, which in turn could alter feeding behaviour. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the suppression of feed intake might depend on the release of interleukin-1.", 
    "25": "In a controlled randomized study, 21 patients who received a combination of ketamine and flunitrazepam with relaxation and N2O/O2-ventilation were compared with 20 patients who received neuroleptic analgesia (NLA) for intra-abdominal surgery. The two groups of patients were comparable with respect to age, sex, type of surgery, time of operation and coexistent diseases. The dosage of ketamine chosen was a total of 0.92 mg/kg per hour. For maintenance of anaesthesia, only 0.5 mg/kg per hour was used. In combination with 0.7-1.0 mg flunitrazepam and N2O/O2 ventilation, this low dose of ketamine was satisfactory. Electroencephalographic and electromyographic recordings demonstrated and adequate level of anaesthesia. The determination of serum free fatty acid levels showed a well-balanced in stress. Occasional elevations of blood pressure--which also were seen in the NLA-group--were not overcome by increasing the ketamine dosage. A brief addition of enflurane or isoflurane was more effective. The immediate postoperative onset of spontaneous respiration without complications and with normal CO2 levels was remarkable. The method was well accepted by the anaesthetist responsible and the nursing personnel.", 
    "26": "The sedation of 50 children aged 6 months to 9 years who had undergone open heart surgery was studied. During artificial ventilation a midazolam infusion was used in conjunction with the administration of morphine (and tubocurarine). Sedation for patients breathing spontaneously with positive airway pressure was continued with midazolam alone. The duration of the midazolam infusion (2-6 micrograms kg-1 min-1) ranged from 12 to 197 h. Forty-seven of the children were sedated uneventfully; the remaining three children needed small doses of other sedative agents. In 10 of the children, blood samples were taken for serum midazolam assay and a short Synacthen test was performed. There was no clinical evidence of accumulation of midazolam, but midazolam concentrations were so variable that no conclusions could be drawn. All patients in whom they were measured (n = 10) had high basal cortisol concentrations, but displayed normal responses to Synacthen.", 
    "27": "Anxiety is the fifth most common clinical diagnosis in the primary care setting. Panic disorder, a severe episodic form of anxiety, has been found to occur in approximately 6% of primary care patients. These patients often selectively focus on one of the frightening autonomic symptoms and are frequently misdiagnosed. The three most common presentations of panic disorder in the medical setting are cardiac symptoms (chest pain, tachycardia), neurologic symptoms (headache, dizziness/vertigo, syncope), and gastrointestinal symptoms, especially epigastric distress. The presentation of cardiac symptoms by patients with panic disorder is especially likely to lead to expensive and potentially iatrogenic medical testing. Hypertension and peptic ulcer are the most commonly associated medical diagnoses in patients with panic disorder. Major depression, alcohol abuse, simple phobias, and posttraumatic stress disorder are the most frequently associated psychiatric diagnoses. Psychopharmacologic treatment of panic disorder has been demonstrated to be highly effective in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Effective psychopharmacologic agents include the tricyclic antidepressants (notably imipramine and desipramine), the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (phenelzine), and the high-potency benzodiazepines (alprazolam).", 
    "28": "Two benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam, 0.25 mg, with a short elimination t1/2, and quazepam, 15 mg, with a long t1/2, were evaluated in 22-night sleep laboratory studies. Quazepam improved sleep significantly during both short- and intermediate-term use. Daytime sleepiness, which decreased with continued use, was the side effect most often associated with quazepam dosing. In contrast, triazolam dosing did not significantly improve any of the major sleep efficiency parameters, and there was a rapid development of tolerance for the drug's slight initial effectiveness. In addition, there were a number of behavioral side effects including amnesia, confusion, and disinhibition. Withdrawal of triazolam was associated with sleep and mood disturbances (rebound insomnia and rebound anxiety), whereas quazepam exerted carryover effectiveness. Thus the data in this study show that the 0.25 mg dose of triazolam, which is being prescribed increasingly, has a profile of side effects that is similar to that of the 0.5 mg dose.", 
    "29": "cDNA clones corresponding to the polypeptide that has been shown to be an endogenous diazepam binding inhibitor and may act as a physiological ligand for the benzodiazepine/beta-carboline receptor have been isolated from bacteriophage lambda recombinant libraries from rat hypothalamus, total brain, and liver. The clones contain an open reading frame corresponding to 87 amino acids. A signal sequence is not present. In addition to high levels of mRNA in various brain regions, RNA blot analysis reveals an abundance of diazepam binding inhibitor mRNA in many peripheral organs (e.g., testes, kidney, liver, and heart) that are known to be rich in peripheral benzodiazepine recognition sites. The size of the mRNA in all tissue examined is approximately 0.7 kilobase. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA suggests the presence of about six genes in the rat, some of which may be pseudogenes.", 
    "30": "A case illustrating the potential for hypertensive crisis in the ambulatory dental patient under treatment with monoamine oxidase inhibitors is presented. It is somewhat unique in that it appears to contradict much of the literature, which states that circulating, endogenous catecholamines are not expected to be a factor in initiating this potentially severe complication. Since this patient had not taken any food or drink prior to the appointment, it may be conjectured that endogenous catecholamines released as a result of stress and dental pain initiated the crisis.", 
    "31": "In a double-blind randomised study, 100 women who underwent induced abortion under midazolam anaesthesia were given the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 or placebo after termination of anaesthesia. Recovery was assessed by means of a modified Steward coma scale. Following incremental doses of Ro 15-1788, 56% of the patients were fully awake within 3 minutes and 92% after 5 minutes, which was significant compared to the placebo group. The median duration of amnesia was 91 minutes after Ro 15-1788 compared to 121 minutes in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). The median dose of Ro 15-1788 was 0.4 mg. A slight positive correlation between total dose of Ro 15-1788 and total amount of midazolam was found. Nausea and/or vomiting were found to be more frequent in the Ro 15-1788 group, but otherwise we found no differences between groups with regard to either side effects or cardiorespiratory function. Ro 15-1788 is evidently an effective antagonist to the sedation induced by midazolam.", 
    "32": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and sodium valproate (VPA) were studied in rats trained to asymptotic performance on two tests of spatial behaviour, the 8-arm radial maze and the 8-choice arena. The task in the 8-arm maze was to locate a single food pellet at the end of each arm. Both CDP and VPA caused an increase in errors, an increase in performance time, and the utilization of a non-spatial response strategy. The task in the 8-choice arena was to locate a single water bottle from an octagonal array of eight otherwise empty bottles. For one group the goal bottle remained in the same place from trial to trial; for a second group the position of the goal bottle was cued by a black card over the nozzle; for the third group the goal bottle was uncued and moved randomly from trial to trial. VPA had no effect on performance, but CDP impaired performance in all three groups. These patterns of effects suggest that VPA may specifically disrupt working memory, but that the impairment of spatial performance by CDP probably results from a non-specific perceptual or attentional deficit.", 
    "33": "In a randomized cross-over study on sedation in outpatient oral surgery, intravenous and rectal administration of diazepam were compared. The mean dose for intravenous diazepam was 0.22 mg X kg-1 (range 0.15-0.38) and for rectal diazepam 0.58 mg X kg-1 (range 0.50-0.71). The determining factors for the patients' preference for sedation method, apprehension, effect produced by the sedative, recovery from sedation and the postoperative course were studied. The patients preferred the session in which they experienced stronger effect, regardless of the route of administration. Patient preference for sedation method did not differ when optimal dose regimens were used, and a preset dose of 10 mg rectal diazepam did not produce the desired effect. Apprehension was significantly higher prior to and during the first operation than the second operation, and all patients recovered from sedation within 2 1/2 hours after the administration.", 
    "34": "Results of a previous study indicated that the opioid effects of methadone were enhanced by the concurrent administration of diazepam in methadone-maintained subjects. To determine whether a pharmacokinetic interaction might account for this methadone-diazepam interaction, the plasma levels of methadone, diazepam and diazepam metabolites were determined in blood samples collected during that study. Five adult male patients on methadone maintenance (50-60 mg/day) were administrated single doses of placebo, diazepam (20 and 40 mg), methadone (100%, 150% and 200% of the maintenance dose), and four diazepam-methadone dose combinations (20 and 40 mg diazepam in combination with 100% and 150% of the maintenance dose). The results showed that the concurrent administration of methadone and diazepam did not significantly change the time-course or areas under the plasma concentration-time curve of methadone, diazepam or N-desmethyl-diazepam compared to the levels following the administration of either drug alone. Thus, plasma drug level analysis does not indicate a pharmacokinetic interaction between diazepam and methadone.", 
    "35": "During clinical pharmacology studies with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 the pharmacokinetic characteristics of high intravenous doses (20 and 40 mg) and of an oral dose (200 mg) were examined in six healthy male volunteers. Ro 15-1788 was rapidly and extensively distributed in the body with an apparent volume of distribution Vss of 1.06 l kg-1. Elimination occurred rapidly by hepatic metabolism and the high plasma clearance of 1.14 l min-1 resulted in a short elimination half-life of less than 1 h. No difference in the disposition parameters calculated from the data after the 20 and 40 mg doses was observed reflecting a dose-proportionality in the areas under plasma concentration-time curves and unchanged distribution characteristics. Because the blood/plasma distribution coefficient is close to unity the disposition parameters obtained from plasma concentrations are similar to the corresponding parameters with reference to blood. Following oral administration of 200 mg the drug is rapidly absorbed. Peak levels were reached after 20-90 min and were close to or even higher than the values after the 40 mg intravenous dose at the same time point. Due to the high hepatic extraction ratio the fraction reaching the systemic circulation unchanged was reduced to approximately 16% during the absorption step.", 
    "36": "CGS 8216, a pyrazoloquinolinone benzodiazepine receptor ligand, was administered alone and concomitantly with diazepam in order to assess its agonist and diazepam-antagonist properties on several behaviors in rodents. In mice, CGS 8216 (i.p.) potentiated the convulsant effects of pentylenetetrazole. Moreover, doses of 1.0 to 10 mg/kg of CGS 8216 produced dose-related antagonism of the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam. In rats, CGS 8216 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) was without effect on the Rotarod, but produced dose-related, nonparallel shifts to the right in the diazepam dose-effect curve. Also in rats, behavior was maintained under a multiple schedule where in one component every 20th response resulted in water presentation (unpunished component) and in a second component every 20th response resulted in both footshock and water presentation (punished component). CGS 8216 produced dose-related decreases in response rates in both components, but was approximately 10-fold more potent in decreasing rates of punished responding. These effects were blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (30 mg/kg i.p.). Increasing doses of diazepam (0.1-10 mg/kg p.o.) first increased and then decreased rates of punished responding but only decreased rates of unpunished responding. CGS 8216 produced a dose-related antagonism of the rate-increasing, but had little effect on the rate-decreasing, effects of diazepam. In another group of rats, behavior was maintained under a multiple fixed interval 5-min fixed ratio 20-response schedule of water presentation. CGS 8216 produced a dose-related decrease in response rates in both components, but these effects were not blocked by Ro 15-1788 (30 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "37": "WSP (withdrawal seizure-prone) mice exhibit approximately 10-fold more severe withdrawal convulsions than WSR (withdrawal seizure-resistant) mice after identical chronic ethanol exposure. Although WSP and WSR mice do not differ in threshold for seizures elicited by electroconvulsive shock (ECS), WSR mice are more sensitive to ethanol-induced elevation of ECS seizure thresholds. The current experiments demonstrated that WSR mice showed more ECS-induced seizure threshold elevation than WSP mice when tested after the administration of C1-C5 straight-chain alcohols. Whereas the brain concentrations of the C1 and C2 alcohols did not differ between the lines, WSP mice tended to have higher brain concentrations than WSR mice of the C3-C5 alcohols, even though they exhibited the smaller behavioral response in all cases. Thus, the difference between WSP and WSR mice was one of neurosensitivity and could not be attributed to pharmacokinetic differences. The WSR line was also more sensitive to ethchlorvynol, methyprylon, barbital, phenobarbital, pentobarbital, diazepam, valproic acid and phenytoin in this test. Examining loss of righting reflex (RR), we found that WSP and WSR mice did not differ in ED50, latency to lose RR or duration of loss of RR. Thus, the genetic anticonvulsant sensitivity difference is not simply a genetic difference in sensitivity to central nervous system depression between the lines. In summary, WSR mice were more sensitive to the anticonvulsant effects of a variety of compounds than WSP mice, suggesting that some genes influence both ethanol withdrawal seizures and ethanol's anticonvulsant effects.", 
    "38": "A 39-year-old man with schizoaffective disorder experienced somnambulism only when taking a combination of lithium carbonate, chlorpromazine, triazolam, and benztropine. This was confirmed in the sleep laboratory. The sleepwalking occurred during Stage 2 sleep; the sleep record showed a marked paucity of REM sleep. The patient's brother had had one episode of somnambulism, also following exposure to a substance affecting the CNS. A role for CNS-active medications in triggering some pathologic sleep phenomena in predisposed individuals is hypothesized. Medications with central anticholinergic activity may be particularly important.", 
    "39": "The binding of different drugs were investigated on benzodiazepines and GABA receptors using P2 fraction or 0.05% Triton X-100 treated membrane preparation (TX-100 P) obtained from rat's CNS. Bicuculline and picrotoxin have the ability to modulate the specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding to its receptor present in P2 fraction; this modulation decreases for bicuculline and disappears for picrotoxin when a TX-100 P was used. Bicuculline at the opposite of picrotoxin displaces 3H-GABA binding on TX-100 P. The beta-CCE binds to the brain benzodiazepines receptor with a high affinity (IC50 = 8.5 nM on TX-100 P) and does not inhibit the binding of 3H-GABA on TX-100 P. On the contrary, other related carbolines such as harmine, harmaline, harmane and harmalol have a much lower ability to inhibit flunitrazepam binding (IC50 between 28 and 130 microM with TX-100 P) and can also inhibit 3H-GABA binding (IC50 between 75 and 186 microM with TX-100 P). But the inhibition of 3H-GABA binding by those related carbolines can't be reversed by a benzodiazepine like flunitrazepam or a benzodiazepine antagonist like Ro 15-1788.", 
    "40": "We have prepared and purified an endogenous protein (brain neuropeptide) by extraction with 0.025 N acetic acid and precipitation with a saturated ammonium sulfate solution followed by column chromatography. This protein was isolated and partially purified (approx. 500 times). When added to Triton X-100 treated synaptic membrane preparation obtained from rat CNS, this modulates specific high affinity GABA binding site without affecting low affinity site. This protein was called GABA-modulin (GM). GM like bicuculline (competitive GABA antagonist) modulates the affinity of benzodiazepine receptor ligands. But the effect of bicuculline is more important than that of GM. Bicuculline increases or decreases respectively the binding of 3H-beta-CCM or 3H-flunitrazepam by approximately 60%. In the same conditions, at a concentration of 12 micrograms/ml GM increases or decreases respectively the binding of 3H-beta-CCM or 3H-flunitrazepam by approximately 35% and no more modulation was obtained even the concentration of GM was increased. Bicuculline and GM doesn't modify the specific binding of 3H-Ro 15-1788 to the BZD receptor. It is concluded that GM exhibit a lower ability than bicuculline to modulate the binding of the BZD receptor ligands because GM interacts only with the GABA high affinity binding site without affecting the low affinity binding site. These observations suggest that the two GABA binding sites probably interact with the BZD receptor.", 
    "41": "The affinities of typical and atypical benzodiazepines (BZs) for 3H-flunitrazepam (FLU) and 3H-Ro 5-4864, \"peripheral\" BZ, binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS) were compared. Each dissociation constant (Kd) value of the 3H-FLU binding sites in the cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus and spinal cord showed the similar results, although the binding maximum (Bmax) for the cortex and cerebellum yielded the largest value and the smallest Bmax appeared in the spinal cord. In contrast, Bmax for 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding sites were about three-fold higher in the spinal cord than in the cerebellum. Among the drugs tested, brotizolam demonstrated the highest affinity for 3H-FLU binding sites in the four regions. Typical and atypical BZs did not normally show different affinities for the two BZ receptor subtypes, except for CL 218,872 and Ro 5-4864. A series of compounds including Ro 5-4864, PK 11195, diazepam and brotizolam had high affinity for the 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding sites in the cerebellum and spinal cord. Other BZs did not show affinity for \"peripheral\" BZ binding sites in the CNS. In conclusion, brotizolam (or atypical BZ) had the binding affinity to both \"central\" and \"peripheral\" BZ receptors, like diazepam (a typical BZ).", 
    "42": "The effects of flunitrazepam on passive avoidance behaviour were investigated in DBA/2 mice. In a first set of experiments retention performance impairment was observed in mice injected with the drug immediately but not 120 min after training. In a second set of experiments, immobilization stress enhanced, while familiarization with the apparatus decreased, the effects of flunitrazepam, suggesting involvement of emotional factors. All the effects observed were antagonized by naltrexone, showing involvement of opioid receptors.", 
    "43": "Ethanol has been shown to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic transmission. In this study an examination was made of the effect of chronic treatment with ethanol and its withdrawal at 24 h on the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to brain regions in rat. Rats were rendered tolerant to, and dependent on, ethanol by an intragastric intubation method. The affinity (KD) or the binding capacity (Bmax) of [3H]flunitrazepam or [35S]TBPS was not altered by chronic treatment with ethanol or during withdrawal from ethanol. Neither the enhancing effect of GABA on the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam nor its inhibitory effect on the binding of [35S]TBPS were affected by chronic treatment with ethanol or its withdrawal at 24 h. These results suggest that the sensitivity of benzodiazepine and picrotoxin sites on the oligomeric GABA receptor complex is not affected during tolerance to, or withdrawal from ethanol. It is suggested that the effects of ethanol on GABAergic transmission may be produced at the level of coupled chloride ion channels.", 
    "44": "Apomorphine-induced stereotypic behavior was investigated in rats treated with diazepam or haloperidol and with the combination of both drugs in a one day trial or subchronically. The drugs were administered via the drinking water. Diazepam dose-dependently reduced apomorphine stereotypies after the subchronic (6 days) but not after the acute treatment. Haloperidol suppressed apomorphine-induced stereotypic behavior dose-dependently after acute as well as after subchronic administration apparently without the development of tolerance. This discrepancy to other studies may be explained by the concomitant increase in maximum number of D2-receptors in the striatum. The apomorphine antagonistic effect of haloperidol was attenuated when the neuroleptic was administered subchronically in combination with the benzodiazepine. This finding was unexpected since both drugs reduced apomorphine-induced stereotypic behavior when administered alone. The further increase in maximum number of D2-receptors due to combined treatment with low doses of diazepam, suggesting a sort of \"over adaptation\", possibly explains the haloperidol-antagonistic action of diazepam in the behavioral experiments. Binding studies on dopamine (D1), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2) and benzodiazepine receptors revealed that modification of the apomorphine-induced stereotypies by the combined treatment with haloperidol and diazepam cannot be explained by interactions of the drugs at the level of the D1, 5-HT2 or benzodiazepine-receptors.", 
    "45": "Prenatal development of the GABAergic system in the rat brain has been studied using an antiserum to GABA-glutaraldehyde-hemocyanin conjugates, specific for GABAergic neurons. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system has been found to differentiate very early relative to other transmitter-identified neurons, such that by embryonic day 13 a well developed fiber network exists in the brainstem, mesencephalon and diencephalon, including a large projection in the posterior commissure and adjacent areas on the surface of the mesencephalon and tectum. Although no cell bodies are visible at this time, it appears that these fibers originate from the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. GABAergic cell bodies begin to appear on embryonic day 14 in the lateral cortical anlage. By embryonic day 16, they are also visible in the basal forebrain and in all regions of cortex where they are located in three zones: in layer I, below the cortical plate, and in the intermediate zone. Also contained in the outer part of layer I is a dense fiber plexus which stains intensely for GABA. These fibers may be part of the first contingent of cortical afferents to invade the telencephalic vesicle, an event which is thought to be a stimulus for the beginning of neuronal differentiation in this region. By E18, two bands of immunoreactivity are visible in layer I, which probably contain both cell bodies and fibers. The trajectories taken by growing GABAergic fibers in the brainstem, mesencephalon and diencephalon at embryonic day 13 and at subsequent stages of development are coincident with regions of both monoaminergic and peptidergic differentiation and appear to correspond to recently reported patterns of benzodiazepine receptors which appear slightly later. The early differentiation of the GABAergic system could indicate a trophic role for GABA in early brain development, possibly involving receptors for this neurotransmitter or related substances.", 
    "46": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) is a protein that displaces ligands bound to the beta-carboline/benzodiazepine recognition site, an allosteric modulatory site of the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex. An incomplete rat cDNA clone coding for DBI was isolated. This rat sequence was utilized to identify a cDNA clone that encoded the entire 104 residues of human DBI. This sequence was engineered for expression in E. coli, and recombinant DBI exhibits identical biochemical and antigenic characteristics of natural human DBI. DBI is encoded by a multigene family of at least five members, but a single gene appears to account for the majority of DBI expression. DBI is expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Expression is found in central nervous system tissues and appears to extend to peripheral tissues rich in the peripheral type of high-affinity benzodiazepine recognition sites. The role of these sites and DBI in adrenal gland, testis, and kidney remains to be determined.",

    "48": "Using 11C-labeled Ro15-1788 and positron emission tomography, studies of benzodiazepine binding sites in the human brain were performed on four normal volunteers. Rapid and high accumulation of 11C activity was observed in the brain after i.v. injection of [11C]Ro15-1788, the maximum of which was within 12 min. Initial distribution of 11C activity in the brain was similar to the distribution of the normal cerebral blood flow. Ten minutes after injection, however, a high uptake of 11C activity was observed in the cerebral cortex and moderate uptake was seen in the cerebellar cortex, the basal ganglia, and the thalamus. The accumulation of 11C activity was low in the brain stem. This distribution of 11C activity was approximately parallel to the known distribution of benzodiazepine receptors. Saturation experiments were performed on four volunteers with oral administration of 0.3-1.8 mg/kg of cold Ro15-1788 prior to injection. Initial distribution of 11C activity following injection peaked within 2 min and then the accumulation of 11C activity decreased rapidly and remarkably throughout the brain. The results indicated that [11C] Ro15-1788 associates and dissociates to specific and nonspecific binding sites rapidly and has a high ratio of specific receptor binding to nonspecific binding in vivo. Carbon-11 Ro15-1788 is a suitable radioligand for the study of benzodiazepine receptors in vivo in humans.", 
    "49": "The distribution and transmembrane topology of benzodiazepine receptors were investigated in situ using intact and saponin-treated neurons of brain cell cultures. Reversible ligand binding and photoaffinity labeling, using 3H-flunitrazepam as a probe, were employed in conjunction with trypsin-induced exhaustive proteolysis and competition binding using a novel benzodiazepine (Ro7-0213) that contains a quaternary ammonium moiety bearing a full positive charge. About 80% of the benzodiazepine receptors, with apparent subunit molecular weights of 48,000 and 51,000, are located in the surface membrane and contain one or more trypsin-sensitive sites exposed at the extracellular surface. The ligand recognition sites of the surface receptors are orientated toward the extracellular space and are sensitive to both competition by Ro7-0213 and trypsin attack. Approximately 20% of the receptors are intracellular or sequestered and are insensitive to both trypsin and competition by Ro7-0213 in intact cells. Strikingly, all of the 3H-flunitrazepam photolabeled sites inaccessible to competition by Ro7-0213 are also resistant to extracellular trypsin, but are sensitive to trypsin and Ro7-0213 in saponin-treated cells. This result provides strong evidence for protected receptors. Surface receptors are differentially sensitive to trypsin-induced inactivation such that 57% (of total) are inactivated, while 24% (of total) are cleaved but, surprisingly, retain the capacity to bind 3H-flunitrazepam. The observation that the ability of the receptor fragment to bind ligand is unaltered demonstrates that the integrity of the benzodiazepine binding site is not contingent upon the presence of about half of the intact polypeptide chain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Octylglucopyranoside (OCTG) was three times more efficient than 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS) in solubilizing the benzodiazepine (BDZ)/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex from rat cerebellar synaptic membranes. OCTG-solubilized receptor preparations had ligand binding characteristics that were significantly different from those of the CHAPS-solubilized receptors. The inclusion of phospholipids in the solubilization media improved the binding characteristics of both soluble receptor preparations and appeared absolutely necessary for the maintenance of chloride facilitation of flunitrazepam (FNZ) binding to OCTG-solubilized receptors. FNZ and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate bound to OCTG-solubilized preparations with equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.2 nM and 1.6 nM, respectively, and chloride (150 mM) and GABA (100 microM) + chloride facilitated the binding of FNZ by 15% and 55%, respectively; these ligand binding characteristics are similar to those of membrane-located BDZ receptors. Cartazolate, a pyrazolopyridine that facilitated the binding of FNZ to membrane-located and CHAPS-solubilized receptors, did not facilitate FNZ binding to OCTG-solubilized receptors. These results are discussed in terms of an interaction between the membrane lipid phosphatidylserine (PS) and cartazolate; PS appears to have the capacity to inhibit the effects of cartazolate on FNZ binding. Storage of the soluble receptor preparations for 24 h at 4 degrees C resulted in the loss of several characteristic BDZ receptor binding properties. Incorporation of the OCTG-solubilized receptor complex into liposomes prevented these losses but this procedure did not protect the CHAPS-solubilized receptors. We conclude that OCTG may have some advantages over CHAPS as the detergent of choice for the solubilization and reconstitution in liposomes of a functional BDZ/GABA receptor-chloride ionophore complex.", 
    "51": "Phenobarbital (PB) was administered to pregnant mice during days 9-21 of gestation. Forebrain and cerebellar [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FLU) binding was assayed in the offspring at birth and at 21 days of age. Prenatal treatment produced a decrease in the number (Bmax) of [3H]FLU receptors in both the forebrain and cerebellum at birth. A small decrease in the [3H]FLU dissociation constant (KD) values in the forebrain was also detected at birth, but no changes were seen in the [3H]FLU KD values in the cerebellum. No changes were observed in forebrain and cerebellar [3H]FLU Bmax or KD values at 21 days of age, indicating that the effects of prenatal exposure to PB on [3H]FLU binding are eliminated during the postnatal development of the forebrain and cerebellum. The receptor affinity for the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872, which distinguishes the type I and type II benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors, was not altered by prenatal PB treatment. The coupling of the BDZ receptor to the gamma-aminobutyric acid and pentobarbital binding sites was unaffected by exposure to PB in utero.", 
    "52": "The effects of 10 days of D-thyroxine (T4) treatment on central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in the brain and on peripheral-type BZ binding sites in the heart, kidney, and testis of rats were studied. The experimental hyperthyroidism resulted in an increase in the density of cortical central BZ receptors, without any alteration of the affinity of the receptors to [3H]flunitrazepam. The increase in cortical central BZ receptors was also accompanied by the up-regulation of peripheral BZ binding sites in the heart, kidney, and testis. The affinity of the peripheral BZ binding sites for the ligand [3H]PK 11195 was not affected by T4 treatment in any of these three organs. The increase in the density of brain cortical central BZ receptors was less prominent than the increase in the peripheral BZ binding sites. The modulatory effect of T4 treatment on central and peripheral BZ receptors might be attributed to the direct interaction of the thyroid hormone at these sites or might reflect a physiological compensatory adaptation mechanism to thyrotoxicosis associated with hypermetabolism, anxiety, and stress.", 
    "53": "Intrahippocampal injection of quinolinic acid (QUIN) in rats caused an epileptic-like syndrome reminiscent of human temporal lobe epilepsy. By electroencephalographic (EEG) analysis, the authors assessed whether QUIN seizures were responsive to anticonvulsants effective in the treatment of the human disease. Anticonvulsants used in clinical practice to control partial seizures, such as carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin, sodium phenobarbital, sodium valproate and diazepam, prevented QUIN-induced EEG seizures, whereas ethosuximide, which is specifically used to control absence attacks, and chlorpromazine, a sedative with no anticonvulsant properties, were ineffective. QUIN seizures showed particular sensitivity to carbamazepine (5 mg/kg) but were resistant to diphenylhydantoin unless a relatively high dose was used (100 mg/kg). None of the effective anticonvulsants completely suppressed EEG paroxysmal events like spikes and fast activity. Animals injected with QUIN displayed chewing, sniffing and rearing; no clear correlation was found between the ability of drugs to prevent QUIN-induced EEG seizures and effects on stereotypies, suggesting that these behavioral signs are not sensitive measures of anticonvulsant activity in this model. The anticonvulsants that protected animals from QUIN seizures did not prevent nerve cell degeneration induced by the excitotoxin, thus indicating that nerve cell death can occur even in the absence of sustained seizure activity. The data show that, in this animal model of epilepsy, the EEG seizure activity is specifically sensitive to anticonvulsants effective in partial epilepsy, thus suggesting that it could be used to test potential new drugs for this human disorder.", 
    "54": "The pharmacological treatment of epilepsy has not gone through remarkable changes in recent years. Treatment is based on few first choice drugs, the mechanism of action of which we do not yet know exactly. These include: phenobarbital, primidone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, ethosuximide, clonazepam. Choice of drug is determined by the kind of seizures presented by the patient, while successful treatment is determined by the kind of epilepsy. The present trend is the use of first line drugs in monotherapy, fixing individually the dosage according to the plasma levels. The results obtained with the GABA-agonists (progabide, gamma-vinyl GABA) and with some of the calcium-antagonists (flunarizine) seem promising.", 
    "55": "Anxiety and insomnia are prevalent conditions in the elderly, and anxiolytics and hypnotic drugs are commonly used. Pharmacokinetic variables--absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination--are all altered to a greater or lesser extent. As a general rule, the elderly are more sensitive to psychotropic drug actions than younger patients. This is particularly so in the over 80s. The elderly tend to suffer from physical conditions which may cause insomnia and anxiety, and medication for those physical complaints may interact with psychotropic medication. In the treatment of insomnia, short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferable to long-acting compounds which tend to accumulate and produce confusional states and ataxia. Similarly, the benefit/risk ratio for anxiolytics is least in the elderly. Compounds of intermediate half-life and no active metabolites, such as oxazepam, are preferable. Anxiety syndromes occurring in other contexts, e.g. dementia may be better treated with low doses of antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "56": "Flumezapine, 7-fluoro-2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno[2,3- b] [1,5]benzodiazepine, antagonized the increases in serum corticosterone concentration caused by a serotonin agonist, quipazine, and by a dopamine agonist, pergolide, in rats. Flumezapine did not alter the elevation of serum corticosterone by a kappa opioid agonist, bremazocine. Flumezapine resembled but was more potent than clozapine and zotepine in blocking these effects of quipazine and pergolide, differing from spiperone and fluphenazine which were selective antagonists of pergolide and from metergoline and mianserin which were selective antagonists of quipazine. All of the antagonists had high affinity for 5HT2 receptors as measured by radioligand-binding in vitro. Spiperone, fluphenazine, zotepine and flumezapine had high affinity for dopamine D2 receptors as measured by radioligand-binding in vitro. The potency of the compounds in antagonizing the pergolide-induced elevation of serum corticosterone concentration matched their affinity for D2 receptors in vitro. There was poor correlation between the potency of the compounds in antagonizing the quipazine-induced elevation of serum corticosterone concentration and their affinity for 5HT2 receptors in vitro, possibly indicating that the receptor mediating the effect of quipazine is not identical to or exclusively the 5HT2 receptor. The results suggest that flumezapine is a potent blocker of dopamine D2 and of some serotonin receptors.", 
    "57": "EMG, HR and SCR were continuously recorded during two Standardized Dental Examinations (SDE) of 15 dental phobics. Following the first SDE, the patients were assigned to two treatment groups, one receiving systematic desensitization followed by two separate amalgam restorations and one premedicated with Valium for the two restorations. The dentist rated the patients' behavior on a 5-point scale. Corah's Dental Anxiety Scale (DAS) was used prior to the first SDE and following the second SDE. The second SDE was conducted on a separate occasion following the second restoration. No significant correlations were found between any of the physiological measures and either the dentist's ratings or the second DAS or DAS change scores. Significant differences found between the two treatment groups on the dentist's ratings, second DAS, and change scores were not reflected by the physiological measures.", 
    "58": "Studies from 1973 to 1985 of the effects of benzodiazepines on memory are summarised and reviewed. Anterograde amnesia appears a common effect of all benzodiazepines although its onset and duration vary with the particular benzodiazepine, its dose and route of administration. Memory impairments increase with task difficulty. There is some evidence that partial tolerance to amnesic effects develops with repeated doses of diazepam, but research with other benzodiazepines is inconclusive. Amnesia is in part a by-product of the sedative action of benzodiazepines, although these drugs may also have a specific effect of disrupting the consolidation of information in long-term memory. State-dependent effects are partial and relatively small. Methodological problems are discussed and attention is drawn to the lack of repeated dose studies, of studies with patient populations and with anxious volunteers.", 
    "59": "Study on specific binding of ligands of various nervous cell membrane neuromediator receptors revealed that brain-specific proteins S100 modulated in a dose-dependent fashion the level of specific binding. Proteins S100 (but not BSA or blood gamma-globulins) changed the Kd values of the ligand-receptor complexes and the number of binding sites. The effects of proteins S100 were specifically blocked by antibodies to S100. Proteins S100 influenced the functions of acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and GABA receptors but not of opiate, imipramine, histamine and benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "60": "To evaluate the effectiveness of somatostatin versus combined cimetidine and pirenzepine in the treatment of upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding of peptic origin, a multicentre controlled, prospective, randomized and double blind trial has been undertaken in 60 subjects. Strict selection criteria were followed. All subjects were diagnosed by endoscopy during the first 18 h after admission. Endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage were also evaluated. Sixty-five per cent of the subjects presented with severe upper GI bleeding (blood pressure less than or equal to 100 mmHg, pulse rate greater than or equal to 110, haematocrit less than or equal to 30 per cent), and in 71.6 per cent stigmata were found. Thirty patients (Group 1) received a somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h continuously during 120 h) and 30 patients (Group 2) received cimetidine (200 mg IV every 4 h for 5 days) and pirenzepine (10 mg IV every 8 h for 5 days). Both groups were homogeneous for sex, age, backgrounds, bleeding source, grade of bleeding (moderate or severe) and presence or not of stigmata. Bleeding stopped in 27 subjects of Group 1 (90 per cent and in 20 subjects of Group 2 (66.67 per cent) (P less than 0.05, chi 2 test). The time until the bleeding stopped was significantly shorter in patients of group 1 (3.44 +/- 0.53 h) than in patients of group 2 (8.12 +/- 1.94 h) (P less than 0.05, Mann-Whitney U test). The number of blood units required for Group 1 (2.26 +/- 0.35) was significantly lower than the one required for Group 2 (3.90 +/- 0.51) (P less than 0.005, Wilcoxon test). Significant differences were not observed between the two groups regarding cross-over subjects, re-bleeding, surgery (P = 0.0635, Fisher's exact test) and hospital stay. The mortality of the trial was 5 per cent. There was no toxicity during somatostatin, cimetidine or pirenzepine infusion. In conclusion, somatostatin was more effective than cimetidine plus pirenzepine in the control of severe upper GI bleeding of peptic origin, with a lower interval time to stop bleeding and reduced transfusion requirements.", 
    "61": "Graded dose of the histamine H1 antagonists tripelennamine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg), promethazine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg), diphenhydramine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) and chlorpheniramine (0.3-1.7 mg/kg) increased rates of nonsuppressed responding under a second-order schedule of food presentation to a maximum beyond which responding was increased less or decreased. In contrast, the H2 antagonist, cimetidine, had no effect or decreased responding at the highest doses studied (56.0-100.0 mg/kg). Intermediate doses of tripelennamine, diphenhydramine and promethazine also increased rates of food-maintained responding that were suppressed by electric shock. Maximal increases in rates of suppressed responding were comparable to those produced by effective doses of chlordiazepoxide (3.0-10.0 mg/kg). Under identical conditions, clozapine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) increased responding to a lesser extent, and d-amphetamine (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) and cimetidine (3.0-100.0 mg/kg) either did not increase or, at the highest doses, only decreased rates of suppressed responding. Doses of tripelennamine and diphenhydramine that increased rates of nonsuppressed and suppressed responding also maintained self-administration in cocaine-trained squirrel monkeys under a second-order schedule of i.v. injection. Rates and patterns of responding maintained by tripelennamine and diphenhydramine were comparable to those maintained by cocaine and d-amphetamine under identical conditions. The results show that histamine H1 antagonists can have pronounced rate-increasing effects on nonsuppressed and suppressed behavior, and that they can serve as reinforcers in monkeys. These effects occur at doses that probably are greater than those required to saturate H1 sites of action in central nervous system and may not be mediated solely through histaminic mechanisms.", 
    "62": "A procedure for the detection of a change in EEG background activity is introduced. Here the time path of the relative power in the alpha band is modelled by fitting two lines, each corresponding to a different level of background activity. The jumping point between these two lines is estimated and serves as an indicator of drug effects.", 
    "63": "Chemical modification of brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChr) with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) has been employed to investigate mAChr-subtype distribution and mediation of the inositide response. 3H-Pirenzepine and 3H-oxotremorine-M were used to autoradiographically localize the M1- and M2-AChr subtypes, respectively, in brain slices. M1- and M2-AChr distribution were observed to be distinct from each other. The presence of 1 mM NEM selectively reduced the labeling of M2-, but not of M1-AChr. These data support the notion that NEM converts the high-affinity M2-AChr to a lower affinity state, without affecting the affinity of the M1-AChr. Also, regional analysis indicated that the M1- and M2-AChr subtypes were not interconvertible by NEM. NEM at 30 microM enhanced the carbamylcholine stimulated labeling of phosphatidic acid from 32Pi in nerve endings from rat forebrain, suggesting that the low affinity M2-AChr may mediate at least a part of the inositide response to cholinergic stimulation.", 
    "64": "Synaptosomal membranes were prepared from frozen rat cortices irradiated by 10 MeV electrons and the enhancement of [3H]diazepam and [3H]muscimol binding by pentobarbital (PB) and (+)-etomidate was studied. The target sizes of the corresponding parts of the receptor complex were estimated from the decrease in the enhancement as a function of irradiation dose. Different radiation inactivation constants suggest different regulatory units for the enhancement by PB and (+)-etomidate. Target sizes for PB and (+)-etomidate enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding were 127 +/- 14 and 360 + 124 kDa, respectively.", 
    "65": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administrations of an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) derived from the polypeptide, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), on offensive and defensive aggression were examined in male mice. During the initial period after administration (1-5 min) ODN inhibited social and agonistic behavior. At 30 min after treatment, ODN increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the incidence of and intensity of offensive aggression in dominant resident mice. ODN also increased the number of bites required to obtain defeat in subordinate mice during aggressive interactions, as well as reducing subsequent defeat-induced analgesia. These changes in offensive and defensive aggressive behavior that were induced by ODN were reduced by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. These results suggest that ODN has significant modulatory effects on aggression.", 
    "66": "The effects of the putative 'anxiogenic' compound beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) were studied on non-suppressed and suppressed responding of rhesus monkeys. Responding was maintained under a fixed-interval 2 min schedule of food presentation (non-suppressed responding) and a fixed-interval 2 min schedule of food presentation where each 10th response produced a 3-5 mA footshock (suppressed responding). Rates of suppressed responding were 60-90% lower than those for non-suppressed responding. beta-CCE reliably decreased non-suppressed responding over the range of 0.03-0.3 mg/kg (ED50 approximately 0.04 mg/kg) while consistent decreases in suppressed responding were not obtained in all animals until doses of 1-3 mg/kg (ED50 approximately 2 mg/kg) were given. Doses of beta-CCE greater than 0.01 mg/kg slightly increased blood pressure, moderately increased heart rate and greatly increased plasma ACTH levels for both types of response. In contrast, diazepam increased suppressed responding without affecting non-suppressed responding at low doses (0.3-1 mg/kg), while higher doses were required to decrease suppressed responding. Diazepam had little effect on blood pressure or mean heart rate. Ro 15-1788 (1 mg/kg) blocked the rate-decreasing effects of beta-CCE on non-suppressed responding, suggesting the decrease is mediated via a benzodiazepine recognition site. These results show that under conditions where relatively low doses of diazepam have an anxiolytic effect (i.e. selectively increase rates of suppressed responding), relatively low doses of beta-CCE selectively decrease non-suppressed responding, questioning current notions of how to define an anxiogenic drug effect.", 
    "67": "Adult male and female offspring of rats injected daily with 10 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide during their pregnancy exhibited a facilitated acquisition of a two-way active avoidance response. Benzodiazepine receptor assays carried out on cortex and cerebral samples taken from experimental and control female rats showed a significant decrease in the density of benzodiazepine receptors, without changes in receptor affinity.", 
    "68": "We report the effects of kindling with the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, FG 7142 on adrenoceptor binding in mouse cerebral cortex. Twelve once-daily injections of FG 7142 caused a statistically significant increase in the density of both alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptor binding sites, seven days after the last injection. Despite the marked effects of FG 7142 on adrenoceptors, there were no changes in either alpha 2- or beta-adrenoceptor binding after prolonged treatment with the benzodiazepine, flurazepam.", 
    "69": "Catecholestrogen (CE) binding to guinea-pig hypothalamic membranes was assessed by using [3H]2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) as a ligand. Binding was maximal at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, and after 10 min incubations. A high affinity binding site with dissociation constant (KD) = 0.20 +/- 0.02 nM and site concentration (Bmax) = 38 +/- 2 fmol/mg protein, and a low affinity binding site with KD = 235 +/- 10 nM and Bmax = 4.2 +/- 1.0 pmol/mg protein (n = 7) were detected. The order of affinity (Ki, microM) for displacement of 10 nM [3H]2-OHE1 from hypothalamic binding sites was 2-OHE1 (0.8), 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) (1.0), epinephrine (5.9), norepinephrine (NE) (7.7), dopamine (270), estradiol, estrone, propranolol, phentolamine, domperidone (greater than 10 000). NE inhibition of 2-OHE1 binding was non-competitive, Only 0.5 mM 2-OHE2 depressed in a non-competitive way the hypothalamic beta-adrenoceptor binding (measured by using [3H]dihydroalprenolol) without affecting alpha-adrenoceptor binding (measured by using [3H]dihydroergocryptine). Both 2-OHE2 and 2-OHE1 impaired NE-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in hypothalamic membranes with EC50 of about 5 and 10 microM, respectively. CE decreased [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid binding by hypothalamic membranes with Ki = 8 microM (2-OHE2) and 50 microM (2-OHE1). The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the same membrane preparation was not affected by CE. These results support the existence of significant CE binding and effects in guinea-pig hypothalamic membranes.", 
    "70": "Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons in chloral hydrate anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Buspirone, a clinically effective non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, caused inhibition of firing of these neurons when given by intravenous (ED50 = 0.011 mg/kg, i.v.), intraperitoneal (ED50 = 0.088 mg/kg, i.p.), and intragastric (effective dose = 1.0-20.0 mg/kg, i.g.) injection. Buspirone also inhibited these cells when it was administered to the outside of recorded neurons by microiontophoresis (effective currents = 2-15 nA). Iontophoretically applied buspirone did not potentiate nor block the effects of iontophoretically applied GABA. Systemic administration of two putative buspirone metabolites (1,2-pyrimidinyl piperazine and 5-hydroxy buspirone) in relatively high doses had a weak effect and no effect, respectively, on dorsal raphe neuronal firing. It is concluded that buspirone potently and directly inhibits the firing of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons in the rat. Since buspirone inhibits the firing of serotonergic dorsal raphe neurons and binds to 5-HT1A receptors, the present study supports the notion that central serotonergic systems may be involved in the therapeutic effects of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "71": "Certain pharmacological properties of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), a benzodiazepine receptor ligand, have been investigated in chicks. Although beta-CCM has been established previously as an \"inverse agonist\" of benzodiazepine receptors in rodents, having effects opposite to those of benzodiazepines in a variety of tests, in chicks this compound had a different pharmacological profile. Firstly, in contrast to the overt convulsant action of beta-CCM in other species, beta-CCM (0.05-40 mg/kg) did not produce convulsions by itself in chicks, but it was only proconvulsant. Secondly and most surprisingly, beta-CCM, like diazepam, produced in chicks a sedation which could be blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788. Thus it appears that beta-CCM can function both as an agonist and as an inverse agonist in this animal.", 
    "72": "Muscarinic receptors in bovine adrenal medullary microsomes were characterized by radioligand binding assay, using l-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), a muscarinic antagonist. Specific [3H]QNB binding to microsomes was rapid, reversible, saturable and of high affinity. Saturation experiments revealed a single class of binding sites for the radioligand with a maximum number of binding sites and an apparent dissociation constant of 162.6 fmoles/mg protein and 40.3 pM respectively. According to computer-assisted nonlinear regression analysis, however, drug/[3H]QNB competition curves indicated the presence of at least two affinity sites for muscarinic agonists (acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, oxotremorine), with a high (K1) and a low (K2) affinity (e.g. K1 = 664.8 nM and K2 = 36.5 microM for acetylcholine). The two affinity sites for acetylcholine showed only minimal regulation by magnesium and guanosine 5'-triphosphate. Furthermore, the presence of two affinity sites was suggested for the antagonists pirenzepine and gallamine, but not for atropine and pilocarpine. The K1 and K2 values for pirenzepine were 23.7 and 429 nM, respectively, with 54.5% of total sites having a high affinity. These results indicate that at least two distinct subtypes of muscarinic receptors exist in the bovine adrenal medulla and that they are distinguished by their relative binding affinity for muscarinic agonists and antagonists. The receptors are predominantly composed of the affinity state termed M1, as described for the receptors of sympathetic ganglia.", 
    "73": "Using the righting reflex as the critical level, sleep was measured in Swiss albino mice at a dose of 35 mg/kg diazepam, i.p. Sleep times varied markedly from zero to 120 min with a mean +/- s.d. of 44 +/- 37 (N = 202). The distribution is skewed to the left with a coefficient of skewness of 0.33 +/- 0.17. The sleep times of the two sexes, when analyzed separately, showed similar range, mean and s.d., except that the distribution tended to be more clearly bimodal in males than in females. These animals also exhibited marked variations in their response to either ethanol (4 g/kg) or pentobarbital (45 mg/kg). The diazepam sleep time failed to correlate with the ethanol sleep time. Significant correlation, however, was obtained between diazepam and pentobarbital sleep times. On further analysis with least-squares fit to a straight line, the data yielded a line with a slope of 0.16; thus despite the correlation reaching a significant level, there is no significant difference in the pentobarbital sleep times between mice that have the longest or the shortest diazepam sleep times. By monitoring the plasma and brain levels of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam in mice at awakening, it was found that the variations in sleep time cannot be explained by individual differences in drug disposition. The phenomenon is discussed in terms of individual variations in diazepam sensitivity and the possibility of development of tolerance to diazepam almost immediately after diazepam administration.", 
    "74": "A protein termed endozepine (EP) which inhibits the binding of benzodiazepines to synaptosomal membranes (Ki approximately 5 microM) has been purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from bovine and human brain using acidic ethanol/chloroform extraction, Bio-Sil TSK-250 gel permeation chromatography, and reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatographies. Bovine and human EP are single-chain polypeptides and have molecular weights of approximately 10,000. Both proteins are very hydrophilic and contain an abundance of lysine, glutamic, and aspartic residues. Antisera prepared against bovine EP have been used to develop a sensitive radioimmunoassay for the detection of EP in tissue and body fluids. EP immunoreactivity is widely distributed in mammalian tissues, body fluids, and various cell lines. Substantial variation in the concentrations of EP is observed in different regions of the brain.", 
    "75": "5'-Deoxy-5-iodotubercidin was previously reported to cause potent muscle relaxation and hypothermia when injected i.p. into mice. In normotensive rats, i.v. injection reduced blood pressure and heart rate. 5-Iodotubercidin possessed the same in vivo activities whereas tubercidin was pharmacologically almost inactive. None of these compounds interacted significantly with Al adenosine receptors, as determined by their ability to displace 3H-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine or 3H-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine bound to rat brain membranes. Furthermore these compounds were much weaker than adenosine as agonists of adenosine-stimulated adenylate cyclase in guinea-pig brain slices (A2 receptors). A previous report showed that 5'-deoxy-5-iodotubercidin and 5-iodotubercidin were very potent inhibitors of adenosine kinase from rat or guinea-pig brain and were potent inhibitors of 3H-adenosine uptake into brain slices; relative to the halogenated derivatives, tubercidin was quite weak as an inhibitor of adenosine kinase and of adenosine uptake. We therefore propose that a significant part of the in vivo activity of the two halogenated tubercidin analogues may not be due to a direct agonist action at A1 and/or A2 adenosine sites (as proposed for a number of other metabolically-stable analogues of adenosine) but may result from an inhibition of reuptake of endogenously-released adenosine; the increased extracellular levels of adenosine resulting from this action could then interact directly with membrane receptors. Consistent with this, low concentrations of 5'-deoxy-5-iodotubercidin were shown to significantly potentiate the effects of exogenous adenosine on blood pressure and heart rate in anaesthetized rats and on adenosine-stimulated cAMP generation in guinea-pig brain slices. None of these compounds interacted with central benzodiazepine receptors. The cardiovascular and behavioural effects of 5'-deoxy-5-iodotubercidin and 5-iodotubercidin were blocked by theophylline; results from the cardiovascular studies suggest there may be different adenosine receptors in heart and blood vessels.", 
    "76": "To evaluate side effects and patients' assessment of fiberoptic bronchoscopy under local anesthesia, 122 consecutive patients answered questions from an outside interviewer (an experienced psychiatrist) and not from the endoscopists themselves. The effect of premedication with midazolam (5 mg i.m.) and hydrocodonum (15 mg i.m.) was compared in a randomized study. In a multiple choice questionnaire 68% of all patients indicated considerable fear in the days before bronchoscopy. They were more afraid of the possible diagnosis of cancer (23%) than of dyspnea or asphyxiation (14%). Coughing is considered the worst side effect of bronchoscopy by 25% of patients (36% of the endoscopists) followed by dyspnea during insertion of the scope (21%) and discomfort during local anesthesia. Although the patients premedicated with midazolam are more sedated (p = 0.025 by physicians' assessment vs. p = 0.11 in patients' view), they cough more (p = 0.001 vs. p = 0.22) and usually tolerate the examination less well (p = 0.009 vs. p = 0.08) than patients premedicated with hydrocodonum. 42% of patients premedicated with midazolam had anterograde amnesia. Although they did not remember all the unpleasant side effects, only 77% said they would repeat the procedure with the same premedication, compared with 90% of patients premedicated with hydrocodonum (p = 0.08). Before and two hours after premedication the reaction times had not changed (optical sign, Wiener reaction device) and were identical in the two patient groups. At that time 37% of the patients premedicated with midazolam and 27% of those premedicated with hydrocodonum were still sleepy and could not be regarded as fit for any form of travel.", 
    "77": "The [3H]dopamine release induced from superfused rat neostriatal slices by 15 mM K+ was enhanced and that of [14C]acetylcholine was inhibited by oxotremorine in a concentration-dependent manner with a similar EC50 value (0.1 microM). Pirenzepine antagonized the modulatory effects of 1 microM oxotremorine on the release of both neurotransmitters with the same EC50 value (0.3 microM), whereas gallamine up to a concentration of 30 microM antagonized the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine on [14C]acetylcholine release only (EC50: 3 microM). These data strongly suggest that, although these functionally different populations of muscarine receptors cannot be regarded as being pharmacologically different (i.e. as M-1 and M-2 receptors, respectively), autoreceptors may still be selectively modified by drugs such as gallamine possibly acting on binding sites adjacent to the conventional muscarine receptor recognition site."
