    "0": "The immunoassay screening of benzodiazepines in urine is one of the most important methods of drug analysis in clinical and forensic laboratories. We experienced an unusual case of poisoning wherein the result of Triage DOA immunoassay screening was negative, although Depas (etizolam) was detected in the blood of the victim who had been suspected to prescribe Depas by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Depas has been widely used for the treatment of anxiety in Japan. Three immunoassay screening devices (AccuSign BZO, Monitect-3, and Fastect II) were evaluated for their specificity for etizolam, its 2 major metabolites M-III and M-VI, and other metabolites of benzodiazepines in urine. With AccuSign BZO, etizolam, M-III, and M-VI could be detected at concentrations of 1,000 ng/mL in urine; however, they could not be detected even at concentrations of 25,000 ng/mL with the other kits. In the case of etizolam poisoning, the result of AccuSign BZO was positive; however, Triage DOA, which is mainly used for the detection of drugs in urine at intensive care units (ICUs) or forensic laboratories, showed negative result for benzodiazepines. The concentrations of etizolam and its metabolites in urine were measured by the established high-performance liquid chromatographic method. The concentrations of M-III and M-V were 700 and 1,600 ng/mL, respectively. AccuSign BZO demonstrated higher specificity-than the other screening kits for the detection of etizolam and its metabolites in urine. Therefore, the types of drugs detected would be increased by combining Triage DOA with AccuSign BZO in ICUs or forensic laboratories.", 
    "1": "Fearful patients are in emergency situation often inattentive, unable to concentrate, agitated or even aroused. They show reduced perception and restricted willingness to cooperate. In severe conditions these patients are strongly tending towards more hazardous behavior: refusal of necessary therapy, break out or even high suicidal risk. Within disaster situations (mass accidents, fires) fearful patients with their agitated and persuasive behavior can influence other victims and with that trigger a situation of mass panic that has to be avoided at any cost. Therefore these patients must be swiftly identified and separated from the event. A diligent diagnosis process including physical-neurological examination is necessary. The recommended treatment within the emergency situation consists of a close continuous personal contact through assuring and encouraging conversations. A sense of security should be created by explaining the planned therapeutic interventions in simple, easy-to-follow and understandable words. If this necessary psycho-therapeutic intervention can not be applied a short term psychopharmacological treatment is required preferably with Benzodiazepines. Still a longterm specific therapy is highly advised, since these disturbances, if left untreated, will lead to a chronic manifestation and with that to considerable psychosocial impairments.",

Prescribed opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines issued to women 3 months prior to, during, and 3 months after pregnancies were identified. The study population consisted of 194,937 singleton pregnancies beginning in March 2004 or later and ending before January 2009.", 
    "4": "About 6% of the women were dispensed opioid analgesics before, during, or after pregnancy. Almost all these women received weak opioids (99%) with short-acting codeine in combination with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as the most frequently dispensed drug. The dispensing of codeine was reduced from 24/1,000 women before pregnancy to 10/1,000 in the last trimester, increasing to 17/1,000 during the breastfeeding period. Most women were dispensed codeine once, and treatment was of short duration (about 1\u00a0week). A small group of women (n\u2009=\u2009271) were dispensed opioids in all trimesters. Increasing benzodiazepine use was observed as the number of opioid prescriptions increased.",

    "6": "In the era of personalized medical practice, understanding the genetic basis of patient-specific adverse drug reaction (ADR) is a major challenge. Clozapine provides effective treatments for schizophrenia but its usage is limited because of life-threatening agranulocytosis. A recent high impact study showed the necessity of moving clozapine to a first line drug, thus identifying the biomarkers for drug-induced agranulocytosis has become important. Here we report a methodology termed as antithesis chemical-protein interactome (CPI), which utilizes the docking method to mimic the differences in the drug-protein interactions across a panel of human proteins. Using this method, we identified HSPA1A, a known susceptibility gene for CIA, to be the off-target of clozapine. Furthermore, the mRNA expression of HSPA1A-related genes (off-target associated systems) was also found to be differentially expressed in clozapine treated leukemia cell line. Apart from identifying the CIA causal genes we identified several novel candidate genes which could be responsible for agranulocytosis. Proteins related to reactive oxygen clearance system, such as oxidoreductases and glutathione metabolite enzymes, were significantly enriched in the antithesis CPI. This methodology conducted a multi-dimensional analysis of drugs' perturbation to the biological system, investigating both the off-targets and the associated off-systems to explore the molecular basis of an adverse event or the new uses for old drugs.", 
    "7": "The cytotoxic farnesyl transferase inhibitor BMS-214662 has been shown to potently induce mitochondrial apoptosis in primitive CD34+ chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) stem/progenitor cells. Here, to enhance the BMS-214662 apoptotic effect, we further targeted the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, downstream of BCR-ABL, by treating CD34+ CML stem/progenitor cells with a highly selective adenosine triphosphate (ATP) non-competitive MEK inhibitor, PD184352. PD184352 increased the apoptotic effect of BMS-214662 in a CML blast crisis cell line, K562, and in primary chronic phase CD34+ CML cells. Compared with BMS-214662, after combination treatment we observed inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, increased Annexin-V levels, caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and potentiated mitochondrial damage, associated with decreased levels of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein MCL-1. Inhibition of K-RAS function by a dominant-negative mutant resulted in CML cell death and this process was further enhanced by the addition of BMS-214662 and PD184352. Together, these findings suggest that the addition of a MEK inhibitor improves the ability of BMS-214662 to selectively target CML stem/progenitor cells, notoriously insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment and presumed to be responsible for the persistence and relapse of the disease.", 
    "8": "A triazolam-imprinted silica microsphere was prepared by combining a surface molecular-imprinting technique with the sol-gel process. The results illustrate that the triazolam-imprinted silica microspheres provided using \u03b3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and phenyltrimethoxysilane as monomers exhibited higher selectivity than those provided from \u03b3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and methyltriethoxysilane. In addition, the optimum affinity occurred when the molar ratio of \u03b3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, phenyltrimethoxysilane, and the template molecule was 4.2:4.7:0.6. Retention factor (k) and imprinting factor (IF) of triazolam on the imprinted and non-imprinted silica microsphere columns were characterized using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with different mobile phases including methanol, acetonitrile, and water solutions. The molecular selectivity of the imprinted silica microspheres was also evaluated for triazolam and its analogue compounds in various mobile phases. The better results indicated that k and IF of triazolam on the imprinted silica microsphere column were 2.1 and 35, respectively, when using methanol/water (1/1, v/v) as the mobile phase. Finally, the imprinted silica was applied as a sorbent in solid-phase extraction (SPE), to selectively extract triazolam and its metabolite, \u03b1-hydroxytriazolam, from human urine samples. The limits of detection (LOD) for triazolam and \u03b1-hydroxytriazolam in urine samples were 30 \u00b1 0.21 ng mL(-1) and 33 \u00b1 0.26 ng mL(-1), respectively.",

One of the main challenges in treating PAP is the difficulty involved in identifying pain mechanism(s), which pertains to both residual limb pain (RLP) and phantom limb pain (PLP). In this study, sympathetic blocks were performed on 17 major limb amputees refractory to treatment, including 2 placebo-controlled blocks done for bilateral amputations. One hour postinjection, mean RLP scores at rest declined from 5.2 (SD 2.8) to 2.8 (SD 2.6) (P = .0002), and PLP decreased from 5.3 (SD 3.1) to 2.3 (SD 2.1) (P = .0009). By 1 week, mean pain scores for RLP and PLP were 4.3 (SD 2.9) and 4.2 (SD 3.0), respectively. Overall, 8 of 16 (50%) patients experienced \u226550% reduction in RLP 1-hour postinjection, with the beneficial effects being maintained at 1 and 8 weeks in 4 and 1 patient(s), respectively. For PLP, 8 of 15 (53%) patients obtained \u226550% decrease in pain 1-hour postblock, with these numbers decreasing to 2 patients at both 1 and 8 weeks. In the 2 bilateral amputees who received controlled injections, mean PLP and RLP at rest scores went from 4.0 and 3.3 to 4.0 and 2.5 1-hour postblock, respectively, on the placebo side. On the treatment side, mean PLP and RLP scores decreased from 7.5 and 6.5, respectively, to 0.",

    "20": "A prominent media publicity cluster during 2007-2008 in Australia linked the common hypnotic zolpidem to adverse drug reaction reports of parasomnias, amnesia, hallucinations and suicidality. The collection of adverse drug reaction data through spontaneous reporting systems is a mainstay of drug safety monitoring, but a stimulated reporting event such as this often renders such data uninterpretable. As such, we aimed to investigate whether these associations were present before the media cluster and then to quantify the effect of stimulated reporting on those four specific outcomes. Using disproportionality analyses we compared zolpidem to all other drugs in the database, and then separately to each of all hypnotics, then all benzodiazepines, and then temazepam alone, and did so in every year from 2001 to 2008. Year-by-year analyses of Reporting odds ratios for zolpidem exposure and adverse events of interest, adjusted for a number of covariates, revealed an association between zolpidem exposure and parasomnias, amnesia and hallucination both before and after the cluster of media publicity beginning in early 2007. The odds ratios increased significantly after the media publicity for only parasomnias and amnesia. Suicidality was increased in some analyses, but limited data make this outcome difficult to interpret. We conclude that zolpidem adverse drug reaction reports have higher odds for parasomnia, amnesia, hallucination and perhaps suicidality compared to either all other drugs or hypnotics, even before the media publicity cluster. However, the extant literature and the limitations of these spontaneously reported adverse drug reaction data do not allow us to conclude that these events are related causally to zolpidem.",

Since then there have been several seizures of MDPV by police and customs and it has been connected to many crimes of different types. In this study the incidence and impact of the use of MDPV in drivers suspected of being under the influence of drugs (DUID) in Finland was assessed. Since autumn 2009, blood samples from drivers suspected of DUID in Finland have been analysed for the presence of MDPV. A new LC-MS/MS method for the determination of MDPV in serum was established. In order to assess the impact of MDPV on driving performance, drug and alcohol findings of positive MDPV cases were compared with data from the clinical examination carried out while the suspect was under arrest. In a period of one year there were 259 positive MDPV cases from apprehended drivers (5.7% of all confirmed DUID cases). In 80% of the cases in which MDPV was found, amphetamine was also present. Benzodiazepines were also frequently found together with MDPV, which was to be expected since in Finland, in our experience, stimulants are very often used together with benzodiazepines. In most cases it remained unclear whether the observed psycho-physical achievement deficiency was induced by MDPV because the concentrations of other drugs, especially other stimulants, were often high. However, in some subjects, MDPV, or MDPV in combination with other substances was the most probable cause of the impairment. The concentrations of MDPV varied from 0.016mg/L to over 8.000mg/L. Little is known about the pharmacology of MDPV. However, based on our findings it is clear that MDPV has a serious impact on traffic safety in Finland.", 
    "34": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), formally identified and described by Ekbom in the 1940s, is a common clinical disorder, characterized by an overwhelming urge to move the legs, often accompanied by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations. This impulse can also be present in the upper limbs or other parts of the body. Well recognized in the adult population, the symptoms associated with this condition have commonly been reported to originate in childhood. However, identifying prospectively children suffering from RLS is still a challenging issue. Iron deficiency has been recognized as a feature frequently associated with RLS. Some authors also make a connection with the deficiency, RLS and other common problems encountered in children, such as attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD). Linkage to different chromosomal loci has been achieved in recent genetic studies of large kindred, as well as identification of specific genes. Therapeutic considerations in children range from providing sound sleep hygiene to intervening pharmacologically. In that regard, use of iron supplements, dopaminergic stimulation, anticonvulsants, opiates, and benzodiazepines will be assessed along with newer options, such as rotigotine and gabapentin enacarbil. Considerations specific to childhood do apply, as no pharmacological therapy for restless legs syndrome have been approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) in individuals of the pediatric age group.", 
    "35": "Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition, and due to ongoing demand from patients suffering with this condition, new pharmacological treatments are actively being sought. As our neurophysiological understanding of insomnia grows, so too do the available treatment options. A significant advance in the treatment of insomnia came with the development of the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications, zolpidem, zaleplon and eszopiclone. These medications have shorter durations of action than many traditional benzodiazepines and may be associated with less risk of tolerance and abuse. They have also been demonstrated to be helpful in cases in which insomnia is comorbid with depression or anxiety, leading to beneficial effects not only with sleep but also with mood and anxiety symptoms. Melatonin, a naturally-occurring substance intimately involved in the regulation of the circadian rhythm, has also been explored as a hypnotic. Little data to date support its use; however, there is evidence that ramelteon, a melatonin agonist, may be helpful for sleep initiation difficulties. Tri-cyclic antidepressants have long been used for insomnia, but use has been limited by unwanted anticholinergic side effects. Low-dose doxepin, at doses of 3 and 6mg, has been demonstrated to have the unique property among its class of being free of anticholinergic effects at those doses. In addition, it seems to have particular efficacy for sleep maintenance insomnia, exhibiting the most robust effects in the latter third of the night. The hypocretin/orexin system has been identified as a possible target. Almorexant, a hypocretin/orexin antagonist displayed evidence of efficacy during Phase III clinical trials but these trials were recently discontinued due to its side effect profile. Another hypocretin/orexin antagonist with a different mechanism of action, MK-4035, is presently in clinical trials. Serotonin antagonists and inverse agonists have been investigated; however, a recent trial with APD125 was discontinued due to lack of efficacy. Sodium oxybate has been used off-label for insomnia by some providers, although data supporting its use are limited. While the sleep-promoting effects of GABA(A) (nonbenzodiazepines and benzodiazepines) enhancement is well-established, newer research examining other mechanisms of action suggest that agents which modulate the histaminergic, serotonergic, melontonergic, and hypocretin/orexin and perhaps GABA-B systems show promise.",

The clustering method identified two subgroups. One of them was characterized by a higher number of dispensings, different prescribers and pharmacies and a greater total dispensed quantity, suggesting a deviant behaviour and, thus, possible abuse and diversion of methylphenidate. These subjects were older (aged 35.4\u2009\u00b1\u200911.3 years) and were more frequently patients receiving benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics and maintenance opioid treatment.

    "45": "This method was able to assess the magnitude of methylphenidate abuse liability and to follow its evolution. The decrease in methylphenidate abuse and diversion seen between 2007 and 2008 can be explained by the enactment in April 2008 of specific regulations for prescription drugs (such as methylphenidate) that are deemed by the French government to have the potential for misuse; these regulations require the establishment of a 'contract of care' between the GHIS, prescriber and patient.",

For these experiments, short- or long-duration clicker stimuli were paired with footshock. Acoustic startle amplitude was later measured in the absence of the clicker, or within seconds (phasic fear) or minutes (sustained fear) of its onset. Before testing, rats received a single injection of vehicle, the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, the 5HT(1A) agonist and dopamine D2 antagonist buspirone, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine, or a 3-week treatment with either vehicle or fluoxetine. Chlordiazepoxide blocked sustained, but not phasic startle increases. Acute buspirone, which is not anxiolytic in human beings, did not affect sustained startle increases, but did disrupt phasic increases. Chronic fluoxetine blocked sustained startle increases and unreliably reduced phasic increases; acute fluoxetine affected neither. The results indicate that phasic and sustained fear responses can be pharmacologically dissociated, further validating this distinction, and suggest that sustained startle increases may be especially useful as anxiety models and anxiolytic screens.", 
    "51": "Physiological ketosis is a hallmark of metabolism in suckling infants. However, little is known on the impact of physiological ketosis on brain excitability. We addressed this question in suckling rats in vivo. 16-channel extracellular field potential recordings were performed from somatosensory barrel cortex at postnatal days 5-9 non-anaesthetized rat pups. Seizures were induced by the volatile convulsant agent flurothyl. One hour after blockade of physiological ketogenesis using combined administration of beta-oxidation inhibitors mercaptoacetate, insulin and glucose to prevent hypoglycemia, we found no significant change in the flurothyl-induced electrographic seizures. However, build-up of seizures during two repetitive flurothyl applications was strongly aggravated in the animals with blocked ketogenesis. The effect of ketogenesis inhibitors was reversed by exogenous beta-hydroxybutyrate. Diazepam exerted anticonvulsive action both under physiological ketosis and after blockade of ketogenesis, and bumetanide had no significant anticonvulsive effects in both conditions. Thus, physiological ketosis reduces excitability in the immature brain and elimination of physiological ketosis results in elimination of this anticonvulsant effect. Our study raises concern that the changes in diet, and pharmacological manipulations such as glucose infusion, and pathologies such as hyperinsulinism which break natural ketosis, may be a potential risk factor for epileptogenesis in nursing infants.", 
    "52": "Dravet syndrome (DS) is one of the most pharmacoresistant epilepsy syndromes. Valproate is used as a first-line agent to prevent the recurrence of febrile seizures and oral/nasal/rectal benzodiazepine is used for any long-lasting seizures, but these agents are most often insufficient. Lamotrigine, carbamazepine, and high doses of intravenous phenobarbital should be avoided because they may worsen seizures. Topiramate, levetiracetam, bromide, and the ketogenic diet may provide substantial efficacy as adjunctive therapy/procedure. Stiripentol is the only compound that proved its efficacy in DS through two independent randomized placebo-controlled trials, when combined with valproate and clobazam. Their dose has to be decreased to minimize the side effects (mostly loss of appetite) resulting from pharmacokinetic interactions of stiripentol powerfully inhibiting cytochromes P450. Stiripentol acts as a \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic agent, mainly via the \u03b13 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. Stiripentol (Diacomit) was approved as an orphan drug in 2007 in Europe for adjunctive therapy in DS. Up to now, >500 children have been safely treated, and recent experiment in Japan confirmed stiripentol benefit in DS children with comedications other than valproate and clobazam. Because early status epilepticus is likely to negatively impact cognitive outcome, we recommend the introduction of stiripentol as soon as the diagnosis of DS is clinically confirmed. Topiramate and the ketogenic diet are alternatives in pharmacoresistant cases.", 
    "53": "Epidemiological investigations show that up to 30% of schizophrenic patients suffer from obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) associated with negative impact on the general prognosis.

As the primary endpoint, we evaluated OCS severity (Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale).", 
    "55": "OCS were significantly more prevalent and severe in group I, in which OCS severity correlated with dosage of clozapine and duration of treatment. Pronounced cognitive deficits in group I were found in visuospatial perception and visual memory (Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised block design, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test), impulse inhibition (go/no-go test), higher perseveration scores (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) and reduced set-shift abilities (Trail Making Test Part B, Set-shift Task). These cognitive domains correlated with OCS severity.", 
    "56": "OCS in schizophrenia are associated with antiserotonergic SGA treatment, but longitudinal studies have to prove causality.

    "61": "The cochlear lateral wall generates the endocochlear potential (EP), which creates a driving force for the hair cell transduction current and is essential for normal hearing. Blood flow at the cochlear lateral wall is critically important for maintaining the EP. The vulnerability of the EP to hypoxia suggests that the blood flow in the cochlear lateral wall is dynamically and precisely regulated to meet the changing metabolic needs of the cochlear lateral wall. It has been reported that ATP, an important extracellular signaling molecule, plays an essential role in regulating cochlear blood flow. However, the cellular mechanism underlying ATP-induced regional blood flow changes has not been investigated. In the current study, we demonstrate that 1) the P2X4 receptor is expressed in endothelial cells (ECs) of spiral ligament (SL) capillaries. 2) ATP elicits a characteristic current through P2X4 on ECs in a dose-dependent manner (EC(50) = 0.16 mM). The ATP current has a reversal potential at \u223c0 mV; is inhibited by 5-(3-bromophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-2H-benzofuro[3,2-e]-1,4-diazepin-2-one (5-BDBD), LaCl(3), pyridoxal phosphate-6-azo(benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid) tetrasodium salt hydrate (PPADS), and extracellular acidosis; and is less sensitive to \u03b1,\u03b2-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate (\u03b1,\u03b2-MeATP) and 2'- and 3'-O-(4-benzoyl-benzoyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (BzATP). 3) ATP elicits a transient increase of intracellular Ca(2+) in ECs. 4) In accordance with the above in vitro findings, perilymphatic ATP (1 mM) caused dilation in SL capillaries in vivo by 11.5%. N(\u03c9)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (l-NAME), a nonselective inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, or 5-BDBD, the specific P2X4 inhibitor, significantly blocked the dilation. These findings support our hypothesis that extracellular ATP regulates cochlear lateral blood flow through P2X4 activation in ECs.", 
    "62": "Visual hallucinations have a differential diagnosis, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric in nature. Described first by Lhermitte, peduncular hallucinosis is an uncommon etiology of visual hallucinations (VH). Typically, the offending lesion is vascular in origin and occurs at the level of the midbrain, thalamus, or rostral brainstem. Interestingly, the origin of the VH in our patient's case could have been either/both from an ischemic insult at the midbrain or compression of the brainstem due to aneurism. While evidence for treatment is scarce, we present a posited case of peduncular hallucinosis treated successfully with olanzapine.", 
    "63": "In recent years, several pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have examined ways to prevent or treat weight gain in people receiving second-generation antipsychotics. While there has been some success, in general, results have not been compelling. Atomoxetine is a selective norepinepherine reuptake inhibitor found to be associated with appetite suppression. Therefore, we examined whether atomoxetine may be of benefit for those who have gained weight on either clozapine or olanzapine.", 
    "64": "The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. All participants received the same psychosocial platform: a structured support and exercise group. People with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, on olanzapine or clozapine, who had gained at least 7% of their pre-clozapine or pre-olanzapine weight were eligible for a 24-week, randomized, parallel group, double-blind comparison of adjunctive atomoxetine or placebo.", 
    "65": "Thirty-seven participants (20 atomoxetine, 17 placebo) were randomized and 26 participants (14 atomoxetine, 12 placebo; 70.2%) completed the study.

Both treatment groups showed modest, not significant, trends in weight loss, averaging about 2 kg. Gender or baseline antipsychotic treatment did not modify treatment effects on weight. Secondary outcomes included neuropsychological assessments, symptom assessments (BPRS, SANS) and safety assessments. Of these, only the group difference in Gordon distractibility test scores was statistically significant and favored treatment with atomoxetine.",

    "67": "Based on electrophysiological, neurochemical, genetic and neuropharmacological approaches, it is currently accepted that serotonin (5-HT) functions predominantly to promote wakefulness (W) and to inhibit REM (rapid eye movement) sleep (REMS). Yet, under certain circumstances the neurotransmitter contributes to the increase in sleep propensity. Most of the serotonergic innervation of the cerebral cortex, amygdala, basal forebrain (BFB), thalamus, preoptic and hypothalamic areas, raphe nuclei, locus coeruleus and pontine reticular formation comes from the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The 5-HT receptors can be classified into at least seven classes, designated 5-HT(1-7). The 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor subtypes are linked to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and their activation evokes a membrane hyperpolarization. The actions of the 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptor subtypes are mediated by the activation of phospholipase C, with a resulting depolarization of the host cell. The 5-HT(3) receptor directly activates a 5-HT-gated cation channel which leads to the depolarization of monoaminergic, aminoacidergic and cholinergic cells. The primary signal transduction pathway of 5-HT(6) and 5-HT(7) receptors is the stimulation of adenylate cyclase which results in the depolarization of the follower neurons. Mutant mice that do not express 5-HT(1A) or 5-HT(1B) receptor exhibit greater amounts of REMS than their wild-type counterparts, which could be related to the absence of a postsynaptic inhibitory effect on REM-on neurons of the laterodorsal and pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (LDT/PPT). 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor knock-out mice show a significant increase of W and a reduction of slow wave sleep (SWS) which has been ascribed to the increase of catecholaminergic neurotransmission involving mainly the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Sleep variables have been characterized, in addition, in 5-HT(7) receptor knock-out mice; the mutants spend less time in REMS that their wild-type counterparts. Direct infusion of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan into the DRN significantly enhances REMS in the rat. In contrast, microinjection of the 5-HT(1B) (CP-94253), 5-HT(2A/2C) (DOI), 5-HT(3) (m-chlorophenylbiguanide) and 5-HT(7) (LP-44) receptor agonists into the DRN induces a significant reduction of REMS. Systemic injection of full agonists at postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) (8-OH-DPAT, flesinoxan), 5-HT(1B) (CGS 12066B, CP-94235), 5-HT(2C) (RO 60-0175), 5-HT(2A/2C) (DOI, DOM), 5-HT(3) (m-chlorophenylbiguanide) and 5-HT(7) (LP-211) receptors increases W and reduces SWS and REMS. Of note, systemic administration of the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor antagonists ritanserin, ketanserin, ICI-170,809 or sertindole at the beginning of the light period has been shown to induce a significant increase of SWS and a reduction of REMS in the rat. Wakefulness was also diminished in most of these studies. Similar effects have been described following the injection of the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists volinanserin and pruvanserin and of the 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist nelotanserin in rodents. In addition, the effects of these compounds have been studied on the sleep electroencephalogram of subjects with normal sleep. Their administration was followed by an increase of SWS and, in most instances, a reduction of REMS. The administration of ritanserin to poor sleepers, patients with chronic primary insomnia and psychiatric patients with a generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder caused a significant increase in SWS. The 5-HT(2A) receptor inverse agonist APD-125 induced also an increase of SWS in patients with chronic primary insomnia. It is known that during the administration of benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotics to patients with insomnia there is a further reduction of SWS and REMS, whereas both variables tend to remain decreased during the use of non-BZD derivatives (zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone, zaleplon). Thus, the association of 5-HT(2A) antagonists or 5-HT(2A) inverse agonists with BZD and non-BZD hypnotics could be a valid alternative to normalize SWS in patients with primary or comorbid insomnia.", 
    "68": "Subacute encephalopathy with seizures in chronic alcoholism (SESA) was first described in 1981 by Niedermeyer who reported alcoholic patients presenting with confusion, seizures and focal neurological deficits and is quite distinct from patients presenting with typical alcohol withdrawal seizures. EEG often reveals periodic discharges and spikes, but SESA presenting with non-convulsive status epilepticus has rarely been described. We report a case of SESA with non-convulsive status epilepticus in a patient who was initially suspected of having a typical alcohol withdrawal seizure. A 61 year old woman with a history of chronic alcoholism was admitted at an outside hospital for confusion thought to be secondary to an alcohol withdrawal seizure. She had right hemiparesis and later developed right facial twitching that did not respond to intravenous fosphenytoin and levetiracetam. She was transferred for further management. Upon arrival, lorazepam and fosphenytoin were given and right face clonic movements resolved. However, continuous EEG monitoring revealed ongoing non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Following treatment with IV valproate and lacosamide, there was resolution of NCSE. SESA is likely an under recognized clinical syndrome that is quite distinct from typical alcohol withdrawal seizures and requires a different diagnostic and management approach. NCSE is likely to account for the encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits seen in patients presenting with the clinical syndrome of SESA. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion is warranted and continuous EEG monitoring is recommended for alcoholic patients with encephalopathy and focal neurological deficits.", 
    "69": "A series of new estradiol linked pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (E(2)-PBD) conjugates (3a-f, 4a-f and 5a-f) with different linker architectures including a triazole moiety have been designed and synthesized. All the 18 compounds have been evaluated for their anticancer activity and it is observed that some of the compounds particularly 4c-e and 5c,d exhibited significant anticancer activity. The detailed biological aspects relating to the cell cycle effects and tubulin depolymerization activity have been examined with a view to understand the mechanism of action of these conjugates. Among all these conjugates, one of the compound 5c could be considered as the most effective compound particularly against MCF-7 breast cancer cell line.",

A manual search of the reference lists of the identified articles and the authors' article files, book chapters, and recent reviews was conducted to identify additional publications. Five studies of note were selected for annotation and critique. From the literature search, this paper also generated a selected bibliography of manuscripts published in 2010 (excluding those previously published in the American Journal of Geriatric Pharmacotherapy or by one of the authors) that address various types of medication errors and ADEs in the elderly.", 
    "72": "Three studies focused on types of medication errors. One study examined underuse (due to prescribing) as a type of medication error. This before-and-after study from the Netherlands reported that those who received comprehensive geriatric assessments had a reduction in the rate of undertreatment of chronic conditions by over one third (from 32.9% to 22.3%, P < 0.05). A second study focused on reducing medication errors due to the prescribing of potentially inappropriate medications. This quasi-experimental study found that a computerized provider order entry clinical decision support system decreased the number of potentially inappropriate medications ordered for patients \u2265 65 years of age who were hospitalized (11.56 before to 9.94 orders per day after, P < 0.001). The third medication error study was a cross-sectional phone survey of managed-care elders, which found that more blacks than whites had low antihypertensive medication adherence as per a self-reported measure (18.4% vs 12.3%, respectively; P < 0.001). Moreover, blacks used more complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) than whites for the treatment of hypertension (30.5% vs 24.7%, respectively; P = 0.005). In multivariable analyses stratified by race, blacks who used CAM were more likely than those who did not to have low antihypertensive medication adherence (prevalence rate ratio = 1.56; 95% CI, 1.14-2.15; P = 0.006). The remaining two studies addressed some form of medication-related adverse patient events. A case-control study of Medicare Advantage patients revealed for the first time that the use of skeletal muscle relaxants was associated significantly with an increased fracture risk (adjusted odds ratio = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.15-1.72; P < 0.001). This increased risk was even more pronounced with the concomitant use of benzodiazepines. Finally, a randomized controlled trial across 16 centers in France used a 1-week educational intervention about high-risk medications and ADEs directed at rehabilitation health care teams. Results indicated that the rate of ADEs in the intervention group was lower than that in the usual care group (22% vs 36%, respectively, P = 0.004).",

    "74": "Mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (mBzR) is a type of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor that is located in the outer membrane of mitochondria. It is an 18-kDa protein that can form a multimeric complex with voltage-dependent anion channel (32 kDa) and adenine nucleotide translocator (30 kDa). mBzR is found in various species and abundantly distributed in peripheral tissues, including the cardiovascular system. The mitochondria are well known as the site of energy production, and the heart is the organ that highly requires this energy supply. In the past decades, it has been shown that mBzR plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial and heart functions. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that mBzR is associated with regulation of mitochondrial respiration, mitochondrial membrane potential, apoptosis, and reactive oxygen species production. Moreover, mBzR has been suggested to play a role in alteration of physiological effects in the heart such as contractility and heart rate. mBzR is involved in the pathologic condition such as ischemia/reperfusion injury, responses to stress, and changes in electrophysiological properties and arrhythmogenesis. In this review, evidence of the roles of mBzR in the heart under both physiological and pathologic conditions is presented. Clinical studies regarding the use of pharmacologic intervention involving mBzR in the heart are also discussed as a possible target for the treatment of electrical and mechanical dysfunction in the heart.", 
    "75": "Diazepam (DZ), a clinically important drug, reduces alertness and can interfere with complex cognitive processes. The effect of DZ on the behavioural and neural correlates of rule-guided response selection has not been directly investigated. We studied DZ effects, compared to placebo (PL), on performance and brain responses, using fMRI, during rule implementation, when arbitrary stimulus-specific rules were involved. BOLD activity was measured in eighteen healthy volunteers during rule-guided response selection with DZ or PL administered in two counterbalanced sessions. A 10mg dose of DZ was sufficient to increase reaction times and to reduce accuracy in a rule-guided task but not in a motor task containing the same stimuli. With PL, implementing arbitrary rules activated right anterior cingulate/middle frontal gyri. Under DZ more brain areas were recruited during the task compared to PL, especially occipito-parietal cortices, as well as the left temporal lobe. For the congruent trials rules, more activity was observed in the right retrosplenial cortex when participants had taken DZ. These findings indicate that DZ might disrupt the neural activity necessary to implement novel rules, supporting the notion that DZ influence on behaviour goes beyond perceptual and motor processes that can potentially compromise complex cognitive functions.", 
    "76": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), a lipid family comprised of omega-3 (n-3) and n-6 fatty acids, are a critical component of cellular membranes, and recent in vitro studies have found that antipsychotic medications up-regulate genes responsible for PUFA biosynthesis. To evaluate this effect in vivo, rats were treated with risperidone (1.5, 3, 6mg/kg/day), paliperidone (1.5, 3, 6mg/kg/day), olanzapine (2.5, 5, 10mg/kg/day), quetiapine (5, 10, 20mg/kg/day), haloperidol (1, 3mg/kg/day) or vehicle through their drinking water for 40day. Effects on liver Fads1, Fads2, Elovl2, and Elovl5 mRNA expression, plasma indices of n-3 (plasma 22:6/18:3 and 20:5/18:3 ratios) and n-6 (plasma 20:4/18:2 and 20:3/18:2 ratios) biosynthesis, and peripheral (erythrocyte, heart) and central (frontal cortex) membrane PUFA composition were determined. Only risperidone and its metabolite paliperidone significantly and selectively up-regulated liver delta-6 desaturase (Fads2) mRNA expression, and robustly increased plasma indices of n-3 and n-6 fatty acid biosynthesis. In risperidone- and paliperidone-treated rats, plasma indices of n-3 and n-6 fatty acid biosynthesis were all positively correlated with liver Fads2 mRNA expression, but not Fads1, Elovl2, or Elovl5 mRNA expression. All antipsychotics at specific doses increased erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) composition, and all except quetiapine increased arachidonic acid (AA, 20:4n-6) composition. Risperidone, paliperidone, and olanzapine increased heart DHA and AA composition, and no antipsychotic altered frontal cortex DHA or AA composition. These in vivo data demonstrate that augmentation of PUFA biosynthesis is not common to all antipsychotic medications, and that risperidone and paliperidone uniquely increase delta-6 desaturase (Fads2) mRNA expression and most robustly increase PUFA biosynthesis and peripheral membrane composition.",

The impact of delirium on patient care in this population may also be far-reaching: affecting not only quality of remaining life but the dying process experienced by patients, caregivers, and the medical team as well. As palliative care focuses on comfort and symptom management, the approach to assessment and subsequent treatment of delirium in palliative care patients may prove difficult for providers to navigate. This article summarizes the multifactorial nature, numerous predisposing medical risk factors, neuropsychiatric adverse effects of palliative medications, pharmacokinetic changes, and challenges complicating delirium assessment and provides a systematic framework for assessment. The benefits, risks, and patient-specific considerations for treatment selection are also discussed.", 
    "93": "Current pharmacological treatment of insomnia involves the use of sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs. Although benzodiazepines improve sleep, their multiple adverse effects hamper their application. Adverse effects include impairment of memory and cognitive functions, next-day hangover and dependence. Non-benzodiazepines are effective for initiating sleep but are not as effective as benzodiazepines for improving sleep quality or efficiency. Furthermore, their prolonged use produces adverse effects similar to those observed with benzodiazepines. Inasmuch as insomnia may be associated with decreased nocturnal melatonin, administration of melatonin is a strategy that has been increasingly used for treating insomnia. Melatonin can be effective for improving sleep quality without the adverse effects associated with hypnotic-sedatives. Ramelteon, a synthetic analog of melatonin which has a longer half life and a stronger affinity for MT1 and MT2 melatonergic receptors, has been reportedly effective for initiating and improving sleep in both adult and elderly insomniacs without showing hangover, dependence, or cognitive impairment. Insomnia is also a major complaint among patients suffering from depressive disorders and is often aggravated by conventional antidepressants especially the specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The novel antidepressant agomelatine, a dual action agent with affinity for melatonin MT1 and MT2 receptors and 5-HT2c antagonistic properties, constitutes a new approach to the treatment of major depressive disorders. Agomelatine ameliorates the symptoms of depression and improves the quality and efficiency of sleep. Taken together, the evidence indicates that MT1/MT2 receptor agonists like ramelteon or agomelatine may be valuable pharmacological tools for insomnia and for depression-associated insomnia.", 
    "94": "Sleep deprivation for 72 h caused anxiety like behavior, weight loss, impaired locomotor activity and oxidative damage as indicated by increase in lipid peroxidation, nitrite level and depletion of reduced glutathione and catalase activity in sleep deprived mice brain. Treatment with melatonin (5 and 10 mg/kg, ip) significantly improved locomotor activity, weight loss and antianxiety effect as compared to control (sleep deprived). Biochemically, melatonin treatment significantly restored depleted reduced glutathione, catalase activity, attenuated lipid peroxidation and nitrite level as compared to control (72 h sleep-deprived) animals. A combination of flumazenil (0.5 mg/kg, ip) and picrotoxin (0.5 mg/kg, ip) with lower dose of melatonin (5 mg/kg, ip) significantly antagonized the protective effect of melatonin. However, combination of muscimol (0.05 mg/kg, ip) with melatonin (5 mg/kg, ip) potentiated protective effect of melatonin as compared to their effect per se. The results suggest that melatonin may produce its protective effect by involving GABAergic system against sleep deprivation-induced anxiety like behavior and related oxidative damage.", 
    "95": "The macrolide antiobiotic erythromycin undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism and is commonly used as a probe for cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity. By means of a transporter screen, erythromycin was identified as a substrate for the transporter ABCC2 (MRP2) and its murine ortholog, Abcc2. Because these proteins are highly expressed on the biliary surface of hepatocytes, we hypothesized that impaired Abcc2 function may influence the rate of hepatobiliary excretion and thereby enhance erythromycin metabolism. Using Abcc2 knockout mice, we found that Abcc2 deficiency was associated with a significant increase in erythromycin metabolism, whereas murine Cyp3a protein expression and microsomal Cyp3a activity were not affected. Next, in a cohort of 108 human subjects, we observed that homozygosity for a common reduced-function variant in ABCC2 (rs717620) was also linked to an increase in erythromycin metabolism but was not correlated with the clearance of midazolam. These results suggest that impaired ABCC2 function can alter erythromycin metabolism, independent of changes in CYP3A4 activity.", 
    "96": "Interactions between neurosteroids and GABA receptors have attracted particular attention in the supraoptic nucleus (SON). Although GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R) mediate a sustained tonic inhibitory current (I(tonic)), as well as conventional phasic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs, I(phasic)) in the SON, whether the steroid modulation on I(tonic) is present in SON magnocelluar neurosecretory cells (MNCs) is unknown. Here, we addressed this question and gained insights into the potential molecular configuration of GABA(A) receptors mediating I(tonic) and conferring its neurosteroids sensitivity in SON MNCs. 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP) (1 \u03bcM), a relatively selective extrasynaptic GABA(A)R agonist, facilitated I(tonic) without affecting the main characteristics of IPSCs, while DS-2, a relatively selective modulator of GABA(A)R \u03b4-subunits, caused minimal changes in I(tonic) of SON MNCs. l-655,708, a relatively selective GABA(A)R \u03b1(5)-subunit inverse agonist, blocked \u223c35% of the total I(tonic) both under basal and elevated ambient GABA concentration (3 \u03bcM). Facilitation of I(tonic) by benzodiazepines further supported the role of GABA(A)R \u03b3(2)-subunit in I(tonic) of SON MNCs. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed much lesser expression of GABA(A)R \u03b4-subunit than the \u03b1(5) or \u03b3(2)-subunit in the SON. Allopregnanolone and 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone increased both I(tonic) and I(phasic) in SON MNCs, respectively, although more than 90% of the current increase was mediated by I(tonic) during the neurosteroid facilitation. Finally, l-655,708 attenuated the neurosteroid facilitation of I(tonic) but not of I(phasic). Altogether, our results suggest that I(tonic), mediated mainly by benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A)Rs containing \u03b1(5)-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3(2)-, and to a lesser extent, \u03b4-subunits, is a potential target of neurosteroid modulation in SON neurons.",

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of prescription patterns indicating persistent and/or problematic opioid use in a cohort of opioid-naive patients starting therapy with weak opioids. Data were drawn from the nationwide Norwegian Prescription Database. The study population was all new users of opioids receiving prescriptions of a weak opioid in 2005 for nonmalignant pain. This cohort was followed until December 2008. In order to be classified as having probable problematic opioid use, patients had to meet all of the following criteria: received opioids at least once every year from 2005 to 2008 and in 2008; (1) were dispensed more than 365 defined daily doses (DDDs) of opioids; (2) received opioid prescriptions from more than 3 doctors; and (3) were dispensed more than 100 DDDs of benzodiazepines. There were 245,006 persons who were new users of weak opioids in 2005 (216,902 codeine, 26,326 tramadol, 1778 dextropropoxyphene). There were 17,252 (7% of new users) who received a prescription for opioids at least once each of the 3 following years. Of these subjects, 686 patients were dispensed more than 365 DDDs of opioids in 2008 and are probably persistent users. There were 191 subjects who met our criteria for probable problematic opioid use. In a cohort of new opioid users who started treatment with weak opioids, only 0.3% and 0.08% developed prescription patterns indicating persistent opioid use and problematic opioid use, respectively.",

    "105": "Antimicrobials are the most frequently implicated class of drugs in drug-induced seizure, with \u03b2-lactams being the class of antimicrobials most often implicated. The seizure-inducing potential of the carbapenem subclass may be directly related to their \u03b2-lactam ring structure. Data on individual carbapenems and seizure activity are scarce. To evaluate the available evidence on the association between carbapenem agents and seizure activity, we conducted a literature search of the MEDLINE (1966-May 2010), EMBASE (1974-May 2010), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-May 2010) databases. Reference citations from the retrieved articles were also reviewed. Mechanistically, seizure propensity of the \u03b2-lactams is related to their binding to \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. There are numerous reports of seizure activity associated with imipenem-cilastatin, with seizure rates ranging from 3-33%. For meropenem, doripenem, and ertapenem, the seizure rate for each agent is reported as less than 1%. However, as their use increases and expands into new patient populations, the rate of seizures with these agents may increase. High-dose therapy, especially in patients with renal dysfunction, preexisting central nervous system abnormalities, or a seizure history increases the likelihood of seizure activity. Although specific studies have not been conducted, data indicate that carbapenem-associated seizure is best managed with benzodiazepines, followed by other agents that enhance GABA transmission. Due to the drug interaction between carbapenems and valproic acid, resulting in clinically significant declines in valproic acid serum concentrations, the combination should be avoided whenever possible. Clinicians should be vigilant regarding the possibility of carbapenem-induced seizures when selecting and dosing antimicrobial therapy.", 
    "106": "In the literature, there are some data which indicate that benzodiazepines and other chemical compounds with the same mechanism of action (Diazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Lorazepam, Zopiclone, etc.) also have other effects. We investigated the effects of experimental chronic inflammation under the administration of some tranquilizers and hypnotics on peripheral algesia induced in rats by \"writhing test\". Chronic inflammation was induced by \"cotton wool granuloma\" technique. The \"writhing test\" consisted in intraperitoneal injection of an irritant agent (acetic acid 0.0025%, 0.4 mL). The animal reacts with a characteristic stretching behavior called writhing. A writhe is indicated by stretching of the abdomen with simultaneous stretching of at least one hind limb. Then, the animals were placed individually into glass beakers and 5 minutes were allowed to elapse. The rats were then observed for a period of 10 minutes and the number of writhes is recorded for each animal. Three drugs were administered by gastric probe: Alprazolam 1 mg/kg, Zolpidem 10 mg/kg and Zopiclone 10 mg/kg. Alprazolam is a triazolobenzodiazepine derivative used as a tranquilizer. Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine with marked sedative-hypnotic effect and it has the same mechanism of action like benzodiazepines. Zopiclone is a cyclopyrrolone with sedative-hypnotic effect used as hypnotic and acts like benzodiazepines. After that, the animals were sacrificed and the weight of cotton wool granuloma was determined. In the same time, the histopatological aspect of granulomatous inflammation was studied. It was found that experimental proliferative inflammation under the action of these drugs was accompanied by a peripheral analgesic activity in \"writhing test\". The mechanisms of these effects are not fully elucidated. Some explanations are: they act as agonists or antagonists on algesia and inflammation mediators and they have a stimulating effect on peripheral \u03c93-benzodiazepine receptors (\"peripheral-type\" receptors).",

Side-effects, especially those severe or those manifested through dramatic clinical presentations such as panic attacks, make the treatment far more difficult and shake patients' trust in both the treatment and the treating physician. This case report deals with a patient experiencing a moderately severe depressive episode, who responded to duloxetine treatment administered in the initial dose of 30 mg per day with as many as three panic attacks in two days. Upon duloxetine withdrawal, these panic attacks ceased as well. The patient continued tianeptine and alprazolam treatment during which no significant side-effects had been seen, so that she gradually recovered. Some of the available literature sources have suggested the possibility of duloxetine administration to the end of generalised anxiety disorder and panic attack treatment. However, they are outnumbered by the contributions reporting about duloxetine-related anxiety, aggressiveness and panic attacks.

We will present the case of a 50 year old patient, treated on two occasions for psychotic depression. During the second hospitalization it is possible that antipsychotic treatment combined with an antidepressant caused akathisia or there were symptoms of agitated depression and akathisia present at the same time, which is very difficult to determine in everyday clinical practice. We can conclude that in this case, as in many others, akathisia as a possible adverse effect of psychopharmacs was very hard to identify.

The choice of antipsychotics is an important treatment factor, since their side-effects often influence patients' compliance with treatment. Severe side-effects may cause the patients to reject such treatment, the latter being their right.

We identified six residues whose mutation altered BZD maximal potentiation of I(GABA) (BZD efficacy) without altering BZD binding apparent affinity, three residues whose mutation altered binding but had no effect on BZD efficacy, and four residues whose mutation affected both binding and efficacy. Moreover, depending on the BZD ligand, the effects of some mutations were different, indicating that the structural mechanisms underlying the ability of BZD ligands with divergent structures to potentiate I(GABA) are distinct.",

    "131": "In the present article, we summarize the preclinical pharmacology of 4-{(R)-(3-aminophenyl)[4-(4-fluorobenzyl)-piperazin-1-yl]methyl}-N,N-diethylbenzamide (AZD2327), a highly potent and selective agonist of the \u03b4-opioid receptor. AZD2327 binds with sub-nanomolar affinity to the human opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.49 and 0.75 nM at the C27 and F27 isoforms, respectively) and is highly selective (>1000-fold) over the human \u03bc- and \u03ba-opioid receptor subtypes as well as >130 other receptors and channels. In functional assays, AZD2327 shows full agonism at human \u03b4-opioid receptors ([(35)S]GTP\u03b3 EC(50) = 24 and 9.2 nM at C27 and F27 isoforms, respectively) and also at the rat and mouse \u03b4-opioid receptors. AZD2327 is active in a wide range of models predictive of anxiolytic activity, including a modified Geller-Seifter conflict test and social interaction test, as well as in antidepressant models, including learned helplessness. In animals implanted with microdialysis probes and then given an acute stressor by pairing electric shock delivery with a flashing light, there is an increase in norepinephrine release into the prefrontal cortex associated with this acute anxiety state. Both the benzodiazepine anxiolytic standard diazepam and AZD2327 blocked this norepinephrine release equally well, and there was no evidence of tolerance to these effects of AZD2327. Overall, these data support the role of the \u03b4-opioid receptor in the regulation of mood, and data suggest that AZD2327 may possess unique antidepressant and anxiolytic activities that could make a novel contribution to the pharmacotherapy of psychiatric disorders.",

    "136": "Brain diseases and their treatment may help or hurt creativity in ways that shape quality of life. Increased creative drive is associated with bipolar disorder, depression, psychosis, temporal lobe epilepsy, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease treatments, and autism. Creativity depends on goal-driven approach motivation from midbrain dopaminergic systems. Fear-driven avoidance motivation is of less aid to creativity. When serotonin and norepinephrine lower motivation and flexible behaviour, they can inhibit creativity. Hemispheric lateralization and frontotemporal connections must interact to create new ideas and conceptual schemes. The right brain and temporal lobe contribute skill in novelty detection, while the left brain and frontal lobe foster approach motivation and more easily generate new patterns of action from the novel perceptions. Genes and phenotypes that increase plasticity and creativity in tolerant environments with relaxed selection pressure may confer risk in rigorous environments. Few papers substantively address this important but fraught topic. Antidepressants (ADs) that inhibit fear-driven motivation, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sometimes inhibit goal-oriented motivation as well. ADs that boost goal-directed motivation, such as bupropion, may remediate this effect. Benzodiazepines and alcohol may be counterproductive. Although dopaminergic agonists sometimes stimulate creativity, their doing so may inappropriately disinhibit behaviour. Dopamine antagonists may suppress creative motivation; lithium and anticonvulsant mood stabilizers may do so less. Physical exercise and REM sleep may help creativity. Art therapy and psychotherapy are not well studied. Preserving creative motivation can help creativity and other aspects of well-being in all patients, not just artists or researchers.", 
    "137": "Mapping of multiple receptors of neurotransmitters provides insight into the spatial distribution of neurotransmission-relevant molecules in the cerebral cortex. During development, lack of reelin leads to impaired migration, disturbed lamination of the hippocampus and inverted neocortical layering. In the adult, reelin may regulate synaptic plasticity by modulating neurotransmitter receptor function. Using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography, different receptors, in particular, the binding site densities and laminar distribution of various glutamate, GABA, muscarinic and nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin, dopamine and adenosine receptors, were analyzed in cortical and subcortical structures of reeler and wild-type brains. Differential changes in the laminar distribution, maximum binding capacity (B (max)) and regional density of neurotransmitter receptors were found in the reeler brain. A decrease of whole brain B (max) was found for adenosine A(1) and GABA(A) receptors. In the forebrain, several binding sites were differentially up- or down-regulated (kainate, A(1), benzodiazepine, 5-HT(1), M(2), \u03b1(1) and \u03b1(2)). In the hippocampus, a significant decrease of GABA(B), 5-HT(1) and A'\u2081 receptors were observed. The density of M(2) receptors increased, while other receptors remained unchanged. In the neocortex, some receptors demonstrated an obviously inverted laminar distribution (AMPA, kainate, NMDA, GABA(B), 5-HT(1), M(1), M(3), nAch), while the distribution of others (A(1), GABA(A), benzodiazepine, 5-HT(2), muscarinic M(2), adrenergic \u03b1(1), \u03b1(2)) seemed to be less affected. Thus, the laminar receptor distribution is modulated by the developmental impairment and suggests and reflects partially the laminar inversion in reeler mice.", 
    "138": "Rifampin and carbamazepine have been recommended in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration draft drug interaction guidance as CYP3A4 inducers for clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. To optimize the dose regimens of these inducers for use in DDI studies, their effect at various doses and dosing durations on the area under the curve (AUC) of multiple probe substrates was simulated using a population-based simulator. A similar assessment of the inducer phenobarbital was also conducted. CYP3A4 induction by all three inducers was previously determined in hepatocytes, and the results were incorporated into simulations. The pharmacokinetics of the three inducers and their associated CYP3A4 drug interactions were predicted and compared with in vivo observations. The predicted C(max) and AUC of all the inducers and substrates correlated closely with those observed clinically. The predicted magnitudes of the DDIs caused by CYP3A4 induction were also in good agreement with the observed clinical results. Comparison of the maximal CYP3A4 induction potential among the three inducers indicated that rifampin is the most potent inducer and is the best choice for clinical CYP3A4 induction DDI studies. Moreover, a near-maximal CYP3A4 DDI was predicted to result from administration of rifampin for approximately 7 days at 450 to 600 mg q.d. or 200 to 300 mg b.i.d. These results suggest optimal dose regimens for clinical trials that maximize the probability of detecting a DDI caused by CYP3A4 induction. The simulation strategy provides the means to predict the induction profiles of compounds in development.", 
    "139": "We screened the major bioactive flavones isolated from Scutellaria baicalensis (baicalin, baicalein and oroxylin A) for their convulsion related activities. In electrogenic response score system and the pentylenetetrazole seizure model, baicalein but not oroxylin A and baicalin exhibited anticonvulsant effects. In vitro studies also revealed that baicalein induced intracellular Cl(-) influx, whereas oroxylin A blocked muscimol- and baicalein-induced intracellular Cl(-) influx. The anticonvulsant effect of baicalein was inhibited by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine(BZD) receptor antagonist. Therefore, anticonvulsive effect of baicalein was mediated by the BZD binding site of GABA(A) receptor. The 5, 7-dihydroxyl group is present in the structure of the three flavones. It is postulated that this group played a key role in inducing convulsion-related activities.", 
    "140": "After injury GABA(A) receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) mediate robust analgesia in animals via putative restoration of post-synaptic GABA(A)-\u03b12 and -\u03b13 receptor function within the spinal cord. GABA can also act at GABA(A) receptors localized on primary afferent neurones to inhibit presynaptic neurotransmitter release and produce analgesia via a process called primary afferent depolarization (PAD). Some forms of injury might sufficiently enhance PAD to shift it into a net excitatory process. Thus, negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) might also possess analgesic activity. We\u00a0have compared compounds capable of either positively or negatively modulating GABA(A) receptors in\u00a0rat models associated with injury-induced central sensitization. The subtype-selective PAMs NS11394 (1-10\u00a0mg/kg) and TPA023 (3-30\u00a0mg/kg) attenuated formalin-induced nocifensive behaviours. Similarly, both compounds reversed hindpaw mechanical hypersensitivity and weight bearing deficits in carrageenan-inflamed and nerve-injured rats. The non-selective PAM diazepam (1-5\u00a0mg/kg) was ineffective in all models. Surprisingly, both the non-selective NAM FG-7142 (3-30\u00a0mg/kg) and the \u03b15-selective NAM \u03b15IA-II (10-60\u00a0mg/kg) also attenuated formalin-induced nocifensive behaviours. In carrageenan-inflamed rats \u03b15IA-II reversed mechanical hypersensitivity and weight bearing deficits whilst FG-7142 only attenuated weight bearing deficits. This picture was essentially reversed in nerve-injured rats for these two NAMs. With the exception of NS11394, all compounds attenuated exploratory motility behaviour in rats, either as a consequence of sedative or anxiogenic-like side-effects. These data indicate that the preferred selectivity and activity profiles for mediating analgesia upon activation of GABA(A) receptors might be more complex than previously anticipated, and is worthy of further exploration.", 
    "141": "In the past decades considerable evidence has emerged that so-called neuroactive steroids do not only act as transcriptional factors in the regulation of gene expression but may also alter neuronal excitability through interactions with specific neurotransmitter receptors such as the GABA(A) receptor. In particular, 3\u03b1-reduced neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone or allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone have been shown to act as positive allosteric modulators of the GABA(A) receptor and to play an important role in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety. During depression, the concentrations of 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-tetrahydroprogesterone and 3\u03b1,5\u03b2-tetrahydroprogesterone are decreased, while the levels of 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-tetrahydroprogesterone, a stereoisomer of 3\u03b1,5\u03b1-tetrahydroprogesterone, which may act as an antagonist for GABAergic steroids, are increased. Antidepressant drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or mirtazapine apparently have an impact on key enzymes of neurosteroidogenesis and have been shown to normalize the disequilibrium of neuroactive steroids in depression by increasing 3\u03b1-reduced pregnane steroids and decreasing 3\u03b2,5\u03b1-tetrahydroprogesterone. Moreover, 3\u03b1-reduced neuroactive steroids have been demonstrated to possess antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects both in animal and human studies for themselves. In addition, the translacator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), previously called peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is the key element of the mitochondrial import machinery supplying the substrate cholesterol to the first steroidogenic enzyme (P450scc), which transforms cholesterol into pregnenolone, the precursor of all neurosteroids. TSPO ligands increase neurosteroidogenesis and are a target of novel anxiolytic drugs producing anxiolytic effects without causing the side effects normally associated with conventional benzodiazepines such as sedation or tolerance.

    "142": "Cell membranes isolated from nervous tissue can be easily injected into Xenopus oocytes, thereby effectively \"microtransplanting\" functional neurotransmitter receptors. This technique therefore allows a direct functional characterization of the original membrane receptor/ion channel proteins and the associated molecules while still embedded in their natural lipid environment. Cell membranes will contain components from different types of cells, i.e. neurons and glial cells, expressing their own receptors, with possibly different properties. To study the receptor properties of a single cell type, we injected oocytes with membranes isolated only from glia (gliosomes) of adult mouse neocortex and we focused our work on GABA(A) receptors incorporated in the oocyte cell membrane. We found that GABA(A)-activated currents allowed a good biophysical and pharmacological characterization of glial GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, the microtransplantation of gliosomes into oocytes can represent a good model to study the electrical and pharmacological properties of adult glial cells under different physiological and pathological conditions. Moreover, since gliosomes can be isolated from frozen tissues, this approach can be extended to post-mortem human tissues.", 
    "143": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the respiratory effects of buprenorphine, butorphanol, midazolam, and their combinations in healthy conscious rabbits. Six adult female New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized briefly with isoflurane by mask to allow placement of a catheter into the central ear artery. After a 60-min recovery period, a baseline arterial sample was obtained. Animals then were injected intramuscularly with either 0.9% NaCl (1 mL), buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg), butorphanol (0.3 mg/kg), midazolam (2 mg/kg), buprenorphine + midazolam (0.03 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg), or butorphanol + midazolam (0.3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg). Arterial blood gases were evaluated at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, and 360 min after drug administration. All drug treatments caused significant decreases in respiratory rate, compared with saline. Buprenorphine and the combinations of midazolam-butorphanol and midazolam-buprenorphine resulted in statistically significant decreases in pO(2). No significant changes in pCO(2) pressure were recorded for any treatment. Increases in blood pH were associated with administration of butorphanol, midazolam, and the combinations of midazolam-butorphanol and midazolam-buprenorphine. In light of these results, buprenorphine and the combinations of midazolam-buprenorphine and midazolam-butorphanol result in statistically significant hypoxemia in rabbits that breathe room air. The degree of hypoxemia is of questionable clinical importance in these healthy subjects. Hypoxemia resulting from these drug combinations may be amplified in rabbits with underlying pulmonary or systemic disease.",

Triazolam-d4 was used as the internal standard (IS). This analysis was carried out on a Thermo(\u00ae) C(18) column, and the mobile phase was composed of acetonitrile/H(2)O/formic acid (35:65:0.2, v/v/v). Detection was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem MS using positive ion mode electrospray ionization, and quantification was performed by multiple reaction monitoring mode. The MS-MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 343.1 \u2192 308.3, 359.0 \u2192 331.0, 359.0 \u2192 111.2, and 347.0 \u2192 312.0 for triazolam, \u03b1-OHTRZ, 4-OHTRZ, and triazolam-d(4), respectively. The lower limits of quantification of the analytical method were 0.5 ng/mL for triazolam, 5 ng/mL for \u03b1-OHTRZ, and 0.5 ng/mL for 4-OHTRZ. The within- and between-run precisions were less than 15%, and accuracy was -12.33% to 9.76%. The method was proved to be accurate and specific, and it was applied to a urinary excretion study of triazolam in healthy Chinese volunteers.",

This study was designed to examine whether CCK may improve the atrophy of the pancreas in rats on TPN treatment. Forty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into orally fed and TPN groups and were infused with CCK at a dose of 5 \u03bcg/kg/h or the CCK-receptor antagonist devazepide at a dose of 200 \u03bcg/kg/h for 10 days. Infusion of CCK caused hypercholecystokininemia (hyperCCKemia) and decreased the atrophy of the pancreas resulting from TPN. The hyperplastic response to CCK in orally fed rats was decreased in the rats given TPN. Devazepide did not influence the pancreatic variables. This study further confirmed that CCK stimulates the exocrine pancreas and decreases the atrophy of the exocrine pancreas resulting from TPN. Our present findings suggest that the trophic effect of CCK on the exocrine pancreas declines in TPN.",

TdP with a long QT interval (corrected QT = 0.591 seconds) was observed on an electrocardiogram (ECG) taken in the emergency department. The patient's drug history revealed olanzapine as the suspicious agent. Even after the medication was stopped, however, the QT interval remained within an abnormal range and multiple episodes of TdP and related seizure-like symptoms were found via ECG monitoring. A permanent pacemaker was thus implanted, and the ventricular rate was set at over 80 beats/min. There was no recurrence of tachyarrhythmia or other symptoms.",

Second, the sensitivity of predicted in vivo variability to changes in variability for physiological parameters (e.g. liver weight, haematocrit, CYP3A abundance). Finally, reported estimates of variability in hepatic CYP3A4 abundance (coefficient of variation (CV) 95%) were refined by separating experimental from interindividual variability using a repeat measurement protocol in 52 human liver samples. Using in vitro metabolic data, predicted clearances were within 2-fold of observed for triazolam and midazolam. Clearance of alprazolam was overpredicted by 2.0- to 3.7-fold. Use of in vivo CL(int) values improved prediction of intravenous clearance to within 2-fold of observed for all drugs. Initially, the variability in clearance was overestimated for all drugs (by 1.8- to 3.6-fold).

PGB binds to voltage-dependent calcium channels, leading to upregulation of GABA inhibitory activity and reduction in the release of various neurotransmitters. Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines attenuate amygdala, insula, and medial prefrontal cortex activation during anticipation and emotional processing in healthy controls. The aim of this study was to examine whether acute PGB administration would attenuate activation in these regions during emotional anticipation.

Linear mixed model analysis revealed that PGB was associated with (1) decreases in left amygdala and anterior insula activation and (2) increases in anterior cingulate (ACC) activation, during anticipation of positive and negative stimuli. There was also a region of the anterior amygdala in which PGB dose was associated with increased activation during anticipation of negative and decreased activation during anticipation of positive stimuli. Attenuation of amygdala and insula activation during anticipatory or emotional processing may represent a common regional brain mechanism for anxiolytics across drug classes. PGB induced increases in ACC activation could be a unique effect related to top-down modulation of affective processing. These results provide further support for the viability of using pharmaco-fMRI to determine the anxiolytic potential of pharmacologic agents.",

The procedure was performed under intravenous midazolam anesthesia and fluoroscopic and echocardiographic (transesophageal) control. First, the perimembranous ventricular septal defect was closed using a 9-mm Amplatzer membranous septal occluder, then the secundum atrial septal defect was closed using an 11-mm Amplatzer atrial septal occluder. No procedure-related complication occurred and the patient was discharged the next day on clopidogrel treatment.", 
    "165": "Core pathologies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) are aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) and tau, and the latter is also characteristic of diverse neurodegenerative tauopathies. These amyloid lesions provoke microglial activation, and recent neuroimaging technologies have enabled visualization of this response in living brains using radioligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor also known as the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Here, we elucidated contributions of A\u03b2 and tau deposits to in vivo TSPO signals in pursuit of mechanistic and diagnostic significance of TSPO imaging in AD and other tauopathies. A new antibody to human TSPO revealed induction of TSPO-positive microgliosis by tau fibrils in tauopathy brains. Emergence of TSPO signals before occurrence of brain atrophy and thioflavin-S-positive tau amyloidosis was also demonstrated in living mice transgenic for mutant tau by positron emission tomography (PET) with two classes of TSPO radioligands, [(11)C]AC-5216 and [(18)F]fluoroethoxy-DAA1106. Meanwhile, only modest TSPO elevation was observed in aged mice modeling A\u03b2 plaque deposition, despite the notably enhanced in vivo binding of amyloid radiotracer, [(11)C]Pittsburgh Compound-B, to plaques. In these animals, [(11)C]AC-5216 yielded better TSPO contrasts than [(18)F]fluoroethoxy-DAA1106, supporting the possibility of capturing early neurotoxicity with high-performance TSPO probes. Furthermore, an additional line of mice modeling intraneuronal A\u03b2 accumulation displayed elevated TSPO signals following noticeable neuronal loss, unlike TSPO upregulation heralding massive neuronal death in tauopathy model mice. Our data corroborate the utility of TSPO-PET imaging as a biomarker for tau-triggered toxicity, and as a complement to amyloid scans for diagnostic assessment of tauopathies with and without A\u03b2 pathologies.", 
    "166": "In bipolar disorder (BD), little is known about how deficits in neurocognitive functions such as decision-making are related to phase of illness. We predicted that manic, depressed, and euthymic bipolar patients (BPs) would display impaired decision-making, and we tested whether clinical characteristics could predict patients' decision-making performance.",

The relationship between predictor variables and decision-making was assessed by one-step multivariate analysis. The main outcome measures were overall decision-making ability on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and an index of sensitivity to punishment frequency.",

However, like HCs, BPs preferred decks that yielded infrequent penalties over those yielding frequent penalties. In multivariate analysis, decision-making impairment was significantly (p < .001) predicted by low level of education, high depressive scores, family history of BD, use of benzodiazepines, and nonuse of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants.",

In a follow-up study, data on psychotropic use was collected from all nursing homes a year after the final RedUSe measure. Mean daily doses for each home were calculated by converting antipsychotic and benzodiazepine doses to chlorpromazine and diazepam equivalents, respectively. To determine the long-term impact of the project, 6-month and initial baseline data were compared to the 18-month follow-up data.", 
    "172": "1578 residents were audited for the follow-up measure. In the 18 months since the RedUSe project was instigated, benzodiazepine prevalence fell by 25% in intervention nursing homes. Similarly, the mean daily diazepam equivalence in these homes had fallen by 24%. In contrast, after a significant reduction during the RedUSe trial, antipsychotic prevalence returned to baseline levels in intervention nursing homes, with mean chlorpromazine equivalence remaining relatively constant with time. There was a delayed reduction in benzodiazepine and antipsychotic use in the control homes.",

The percentage of patients who showed body movement in the DEX group was significantly lower than those in the PF and MDZ groups, and the mean dose of additional MDZ in the DEX group was significantly smaller than that in the MDZ group. The rate of effective sedation was significantly higher in the DEX group compared with the MDZ or PF group. The mean length of ESD in the DEX group was 65 min, which was significantly shorter than in the other two groups. No DEX-sedated patient developed major surgical complications.",

    "178": "In 1950, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was discovered in the brain and in 1967 it was recognized as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. The discovery of the benzodiazepines Librium\u00ae (launched in 1960) and Valium\u00ae by Sternbach initiated huge research activities resulting in 50 marketed drugs. In 1975, Haefely found that GABA is involved in the actions of benzodiazepines. The baclofen-sensitive, bicuculline-insensitive GABA(B) receptor was discovered by Bowery in 1980, and the baclofen-insensitive, bicuculline-insensitive GABA(C) receptor by Johnston in 1984. Barnard & Seeburg reported the cloning of the GABA(A) receptor in 1987, Cutting the GABA(C) receptor in 1991 and Bettler the GABA(B1a) and GABA(B1b) receptors in 1997. Six groups cloned the GABA(B2) receptor in 1998/1999 showing that the GABA(B) receptor functions as a heterodimer with GABA(B1b)/GABA(B2) mediating postsynaptic inhibition and GABA(B1a)/GABA(B2) mediating presynaptic inhibition. M\u00f6hler and McKernan dissected the pharmacology of the benzodiazepine-receptor subtypes. Antagonists and positive allosteric modulators of GABA(B) receptors were discovered in 1987 and 2001, respectively. GABA transporter inhibitor, tiagabine, was launched in 1996, a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor, vigabatrin, in 1998 and a glutamic acid decarboxylase activator, pregabalin, in 2004. Most recently, brain-penetrating GABA(C)-receptor antagonists were reported in 2009.",

Twenty and twenty-six subjects were administered olanzapine film-coated tablet or orodispersible tablet of test and reference formulations in an open-label, randomised, fasting, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study. Blood samples were taken before and within 240 h after drug administration. Plasma concentrations were determined by LC/MS/MS. Log-transformed AUC and Cmax values were tested for bioequivalence based on the ratios of the geometric means (test/reference). tmax was analysed nonparametrically. The 90% confidence intervals of the geometric mean values for the test/reference ratios for AUC(0-t) and Cmax were within the bioequivalence acceptance range of 80-125%. It may be therefore concluded that the test formulations of olanzapine 10 mg film-coated tablet and orodispersible tablet are bioequivalent to the reference products and can be prescribed interchangeably.", 
    "180": "Mimosa pudica (Linn.) (M. pudica L.) is a plant used in some countries to treat anxiety and depression. In the present study we investigated the effects of an aqueous extract of M. pudica L. on mouse anxiety-like behaviour using the elevated T maze, and on regulation of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neuronal activity using an in-vitro mouse brain slice preparation. Acute treatment with M. pudica L. extract had an anxiolytic effect on behaviour in the elevated T maze, specifically on inhibitory avoidance behaviour. Acute application of the extract alone had no effect on the activity of DRN 5-HT neurones. However, when co-applied with the GABA(A) receptor agonist THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol), the extract enhanced the inhibitory effect of the THIP on DRN 5-HT neurones. These observed effects of M. pudica L. on both behaviour and GABA modulation of 5-HT neuronal activity are similar to the effects of diazepam, the established anxiolytic and positive modulator of the GABA(A) receptor. This study suggests that the aqueous extract of M. pudica L. contains a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptor function and provides impetus for further investigation of the neuropharmacologically active constituents of the extract.",

All patients were referred and admitted in the Toxicology Clinic of \"Sf. Ioan\" Emergency Clinic Hospital Iasi, Romania. Between 2003 and 2009, 811 cases of acute drug poisonings were recorded, counting for 28.43% from the total number of poisonings. The majority of these poisonings resulted in mild (51.94%) and medium (28.35%) clinical forms, while 19.71% were coma situations. In all, 63.51% of patients originated from urban areas, 39.94% were unemployed and the patients were predominantly women (66.46%). A high percentage (97.27%) were suicide attempts, using only one type of drug (65.88%) and the 21-30 years group (29.8%) records the highest incidence, for both women and men. The most frequently involved drugs were benzodiazepines 13.69%, anticonvulsive drugs 8.63%, barbiturates 8.51% and cardiovascular drugs 5.92%. Drugs combinations were recorded in 32.92% of cases and 1.2% were combinations between drugs and other substances. Mortality was the outcome in 0.3% of the total registered number of acute drug poisonings.

    "182": "Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimers are synthetic sequence-selective DNA minor-groove cross-linking agents that possess two electrophilic imine moieties (or their equivalent) capable of forming covalent aminal linkages with guanine C2-NH(2) functionalities. The PBD dimer SJG-136, which has a C8-O-(CH(2))(3)-O-C8'' central linker joining the two PBD moieties, is currently undergoing phase II clinical trials and current research is focused on developing analogues of SJG-136 with different linker lengths and substitution patterns. Using a reversed-phase ion pair HPLC/MS method to evaluate interaction with oligonucleotides of varying length and sequence, we recently reported (JACS, 2009, 131, 13\u2009756) that SJG-136 can form three different types of adducts: inter- and intrastrand cross-linked adducts, and mono-alkylated adducts. These studies have now been extended to include PBD dimers with a longer central linker (C8-O-(CH(2))(5)-O-C8'), demonstrating that the type and distribution of adducts appear to depend on (i) the length of the C8/C8'-linker connecting the two PBD units, (ii) the positioning of the two reactive guanine bases on the same or opposite strands, and (iii) their separation (i.e. the number of base pairs, usually ATs, between them). Based on these data, a set of rules are emerging that can be used to predict the DNA-interaction behaviour of a PBD dimer of particular C8-C8' linker length towards a given DNA sequence. These observations suggest that it may be possible to design PBD dimers to target specific DNA sequences.",
