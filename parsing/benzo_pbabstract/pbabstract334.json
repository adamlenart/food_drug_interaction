A double-blind, independent group design was used to compare placebo with alprazolam (32 volunteers in each group). After random assignment, all subjects received placebo for 3 days (D) followed by 14 days of treatment with either alprazolam or placebo. Subjects completed a battery of tests at D0, D3, D7, D10, and D14. D3 performance was poorer in the alprazolam group except for CFF values (ascending values and total values), and the only significant improvement was in total reaction time on the CRT test. However, a significant improvement in performance (except in recognition reaction time) was shown at D7, D10, and D14 in the alprazolam group compared with the control group results. This study shows that repeated low doses of alprazolam produce small improvements in some aspects of psychomotor and cognitive functions. Training effect, tolerance effect, anxiolytic effect, and changes in receptor function and/or number are discussed to explain the performance improvement.", 
    "1": "The purpose of the present study is to compare the injection pain of propofol with that of benzodiazepines when used for intravenous sedation. In addition, we evaluated the efficacy of coadministering a small dose of 1% lidocaine (20 mg) to reduce the pain accompanying propofol injection. Intravenous propofol, diazepam, midazolam, or flunitrazepam were administered on separate occasions to volunteers and outpatients. The degree of injection pain was evaluated by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) ruler. The efficacy of premixed lidocaine with propofol was also compared among the patients. The venous pain of propofol was significantly more intense than that of the three other drugs (P < 0.05). The injection pain of diazepam was more intense than that of midazolam (P < 0.05). Many patients reported no pain when propofol was coadministered with lidocaine. The addition of a small dose (20 mg) of lidocaine reduced the VAS pain score to comparable levels observed for benzodiazepines. Because injection pain might affect the patients' comfort during sedation, the addition of lidocaine to the propofol injection is deemed useful for intravenous sedation.", 
    "2": "The safety and efficacy of an oral sedation technique for children having minor oral surgical procedures under local anesthesia were studied. One hundred healthy children between the ages of 2 and 7 yr received either a combination of midazolam (0.35 mg/kg) and ketamine (5 mg/kg) (Group A), or a combination of trimeprazine (3 mg/kg) and methadone (0.2 mg/kg) (Group B) 30 min preoperatively. Hemodynamic parameters, adverse reactions, postoperative recovery, and behavior were evaluated. More children were asleep, but rousable to verbal commands, 30 min after drug administration in Group A (40%) than in Group B (8%). Immediately before the dental procedure, 46% of children in Group A were asleep in contrast to 8% of children in group B. Significantly more children in Group A were awake, coughing, crying, and moving purposefully 30 and 60 min after admission to the recovery room. Two children (4%) in Group A vomited. Ten (20%) children in Group A hallucinated compared to none in Group B. The surgeon rated the procedure as good or very good in 94% of children in Group A compared to 78% in Group B. Our results show that the combination of midazolam and ketamine, administered orally, is a safe, effective, and practical approach to managing children for minor oral surgical procedures under local anesthesia.", 
    "3": "1. Pharmacological treatments are effective as part of a treatment plan that includes substantial education, psychological therapy and social support. This paper reviews recent literature on animal models of and treatment for alcohol abuse under seven categories: agents to block craving or reduce alcohol intake, agents to induce aversion to alcohol, agents to treat acute alcohol withdrawal, agents to treat protracted alcohol withdrawal, agents to diminish drinking by treating associated psychiatric pathology, agents to decrease drinking by treating associated drug abuse, and agents to induce sobriety in intoxicated individuals. 2. The benzodiazepines provide safe and effective treatment for detoxification, although current research focuses on finding drugs with a smaller likelihood of dependence. As yet, there are no drugs that effectively reverse the intoxicating effects of alcohol. 3. Currently, only two major groups of drugs that are relatively safe have shown any effect at reducing alcohol consumption: aversives such as disulfiram, and opioid antagonists such as naltrexone. 4. Finally, it is important to customize therapy for each patient rather than putting everyone through a standard treatment plan, especially in regards to the use of antidepressant or antipsychotic medications. Tailoring the program to the patient's needs dramatically improves the outcome of therapy and reduces the risk of adverse effects.", 
    "4": "Recent studies concerning management of soman-induced seizures are reviewed. While drugs classically used against epilepsy in hospital appear ineffective against soman, muscarinic receptor blockers are shown to be able to prevent or stop seizures within the first 5 min after their onset. Benzodiazepine could also be considered as an emergency treatment useful during the first 10 min of seizure. Comparatively NMDA antagonists appear to be able to terminate soman-induced seizures even if the treatment is delayed after 40 min of epileptic activity. Drugs with both antimuscarinic and anti-NMDA properties may represent the most adequate pharmacological treatment to treat soman intoxication. However, the results obtained until now with these drugs must be completed in relation with their possible efficacy after i.m. administration. Propositions for future studies are reviewed.", 
    "5": "Psychosis induced by the standard drugs for treating idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) occurs, in the long term, in approximately 5-8% of patients. Until the development of atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment of this psychosis was extremely limited and unsatisfactory. Clozapine has been reported to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for this problem. Clozapine, however, is a difficult drug to use as a result of the monitoring system mandated by the Food and Drug Administration because of the potential for agranulocytosis. Treatment with risperidone has been shown to be poorly-tolerated. This article reports on the authors' open label experience with the newest atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, and the switching of stable patients from clozapine to olanzapine. Nine of twelve subjects were unable to make the transition because of worsened parkinsonism. Most subjects preferred taking clozapine, despite the onerous monitoring procedure.", 
    "6": "We are reporting on a patient with a schizoaffective disorder (ICD 10:F25.1), whose catatonic symptoms deteriorated while receiving high-potency neuroleptic drugs in combination with anticholinergic medication. Initially there was a \"catatonic dilemma\", i.e. it was not possible to differentiate between the morbigenous and pharmacogenic (malignant neuroleptic syndrome) etiology of the catatonic symptoms. Catatonic symptoms were successfully treated with a combination of lorazepam and clozapine. The severe catatonic syndrome was found to be a neuroleptic-induced deterioration of a primary morbogenous catatonic syndrome. Thus, this case also suggests that the malignant neuroleptic syndrome and neuroleptic non-responsive catatonia may not be two different disease entities but that catatonia under neuroleptic medication is caused by the interaction of individual disposition, morbigenous and pharmacogenic factors.", 
    "7": "Long-term treatment of patients with chronic schizophrenias requires integration of many therapeutic approaches, co-operation of several professions, and regard for the views of patients and relatives. This review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, cognitive resp. psychological treatments, social resp. milieu therapy, rehabilitation, interventions based on the concept of Expressed Emotions (EE), psychoeducation and work with relatives. Continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration. Indications for adding on antidepressants, lithium, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed, as well as treatment of negative symptoms, depression and management of treatment-resistant symptoms. Psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient. In the context of a stable long-term relationship, the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action. Effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited. The best results are achieved by social skills training. Social therapy, which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient, is of paramount importance. Improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long-term social rehabilitation. Interventions based on the EE concept are highly effective, but are rarely used. Programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective. The functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained, the integrative role of case-management is stressed.", 
    "8": "The effect of FK480, a cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) selective receptor antagonist, on spontaneously developed chronic pancreatitis was examined in WBN/Kob rats. Animals at age 18 weeks (18w-Control) already had the histologic appearance of chronic pancreatitis as indicated by inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic degeneration with interstitial edema. Rats treated with vehicle from 18 to 26 weeks of age (26w-Control) showed further development of pancreatitis as characterized by more extensive appearance of inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrotic changes, with the pancreatic weight significantly decreased. Serum amylase levels of 26w-Control animals were slightly decreased compared with those of 18w-Control animals, although the difference was not statistically significant. When rats were treated orally with 1, 10, and 100 microg/kg FK480 from 18 to 26 weeks of age, the decrease in serum amylase levels recovered dose dependently compared with 26w-Control, and the level in animals treated with 100 microg/kg FK480 was almost the same as that in 18w-Control rats. Histologic examinations revealed that the appearance of the pancreas of animals treated with FK480 was slightly improved with respect to inflammatory cell infiltration and edematous changes at the highest dose examined, although the difference was not statistically significant. Although blockade of the CCK-A receptor could be considered to exacerbate chronic pancreatitis due to possible inhibition of the trophic action of CCK, our results suggest that CCK-A receptor antagonists may not be detrimental to chronic pancreatitis.", 
    "9": "The effects of a new benzodiazepine-derivative, cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, TS-941, on experimental acute pancreatitis were studied in rats. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis was induced by an infusion of a mixture of trypsin and taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Edematous pancreatitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 40 microg/kg body weight of cerulein at 0 and 1 h after the start of the experiment. TS-941 (3 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously immediately and 3 h after the induction of pancreatitis. In trypsin-taurocholate-induced pancreatitis, TS-941, with or without the synthetic trypsin inhibitor ONO-3403, had no beneficial effects on the survival rate, pancreatic wet weight, and serum pancreatic enzymes. In cerulein-induced pancreatitis, the treatment with TS-941 significantly reduced the increases of pancreatic wet weight and serum amylase and lipase. Plasma trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) significantly rose 1 h after the first injection of cerulein. TS-941 inhibited the liberation of TAP in cerulein-induced pancreatitis. These results show that TS-941 is effective for prevention of cerulein-induced edematous pancreatitis. ONO-3403 has beneficial effects on trypsin-taurocholate-induced hemorrhagic pancreatitis, but the combination of TS-941 and ONO-3403 has no additive effect.", 
    "10": "A 53-year-old Caucasian male victim of suicide was suspected of overdose with sertraline and alprazolam after death-scene investigation. The concentration of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was determined by a gas chromatograph with mass selective detection. The concentration of alprazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. The sertraline concentration was reported at 1.0 mg/L in peripheral blood, which is greater than previously reported in other postmortem cases in which death was attributed to a multiple drug overdose. The N-desmethylsertraline concentration was reported at 0.2 mg/L in peripheral blood, which is far less than in other postmortem cases and suggests acute intoxication in this case. The alprazolam concentration was reported at 33 microg/L in heart blood, which is within the therapeutic range. The cause of death was multiple drug intoxication following acute use of sertraline, the manner of death was suicide, and the mechanism of death is an unexplained drug interaction and/or toxicity.", 
    "11": "The Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC) program is used by police agencies to identify drivers impaired because of drug use and to determine the class(es) of drug causing the impairment. The primary goal of this study was to determine the validity of the DEC evaluation in predicting whether research volunteers were administered alprazolam, d-amphetamine, codeine, or marijuana. A secondary goal was to determine the accuracy of Drug Recognition Examiners (DREs) in detecting if subjects were dosed with these drugs. Community volunteers (n = 48) were administered alprazolam (0, 1, 2 mg), d-amphetamine (0, 12.5, 25 mg), codeine (0, 60, 120 mg), or marijuana (0, 3.58% THC) in a double-blind, randomized, between-subject design. A single drug dose or placebo was administered at each experimental session, and blood samples were obtained before and after dosing. With the exception of marijuana, plasma drug concentration was at or near maximum during the DEC evaluation. The ability of the DEC evaluation to predict the intake of alprazolam, d-amphetamine, codeine, or marijuana was optimal when using 2-7 variables from the evaluation. DREs' decisions of impairment were consistent with the administration of any active drug in 76% of cases, and their drug class decisions were consistent with toxicology in 32% of cases, according to standards of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. These findings suggest that the DEC evaluation can be used to predict accurately acute administration of alprazolam, d-amphetamine, codeine, and marijuana and that predictions of drug use may be improved by focusing on a subset of variables.", 
    "12": "Presented are findings from a multisite laboratory evaluation comparing on-site urinalysis drug-test results to results from Syva EMIT immunoassay and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Three laboratories participated in the NHTSA-funded project. Specimens were tested for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cocaine, cannabinoids, and opiates. Each laboratory selected 20 urines that tested positive for a single drug/drug class and 20 that tested negative to challenge the on-site drug-testing devices. Qualitative and quantitative GC-MS confirmations were performed to ensure that all positive samples contained the target drug(s)/metabolite(s) and that all negative samples did not contain the target analytes. EZ-SCREEN, ONTRAK, and TRIAGE on-site test kits were selected for evaluation. On-site false-positive results, in which GC-MS-verified negative urine samples gave positive on-site results, were rare. Two such errors were recorded with both EZ-SCREEN and TRIAGE. Cross-reactivity from samples containing GC-MS-verified high concentrations of alternate drugs was also rare. One cross-reactive error was recorded while testing for cocaine with EZ-SCREEN, a second while testing for benzodiazepines with ONTRAK, and a third while testing for cocaine with ONTRAK. The EZ-SCREEN kit did not appear to adhere to a cutoff concentration as demonstrated by the number of samples that contained low concentrations of the target drugs that tested positive with this device. A significant finding of this study was that comparing on-site test device results with those of EMIT for samples with drug concentrations near the reporting cutoff was very complex. It required a thorough knowledge of the performance of each device, EMIT, and GC-MS. It also required an investigation of each discrepant result-a consideration not taken in many previous evaluations of on-site testing devices. Compared with current federal guidelines for workplace urinalysis testing, more donor samples would screen positive for cannabinoids and cocaine by the on-site devices than by EMIT immunoassay. However, fewer would be reported as positive because most contained GC-MS-determined drug concentrations lower than the federal confirmation and reporting limits.", 
    "13": "This paper reports a series of 20 fatalities involving a high-dose, sublingual buprenorphine (BUP) formulation recently marketed in France for the substitutive therapy of opiate addicts. The files were recorded over a 16-month period from five different urban areas in France. All subjects but one were male, aged 14-48 (mean 26.6). BUP and its primary metabolite norbuprenorphine (norBUP) were assayed in postmortem fluids and viscerae by HPLC-MS. Blood levels for BUP and norBUP ranged from 1.1 to 29.0 ng/mL (mean 8.4 ng/mL) and 0.2 to 12.6 ng/mL (mean 2.6 ng/mL), respectively, that is, within or slightly over the therapeutic range. BUP exhibited extensive tissue distribution, with average postmortem concentrations of 6.0, 35.0, 45.5, and 80.0 ng/g in the myocardium, kidney, brain, and liver, respectively. In blood, as in viscerae, norBUP levels were generally lower than BUP. The highest concentrations were found in the bile for both BUP (range 575-72,650 ng/mL) and norBUP (range 41-30,000 ng/mL). Therefore, bile may represent a sample of choice for postmortem screening. BUP was identified in 9 of the 11 hair samples assayed at concentrations ranging from 6 to 597 ng/g (mean 137 ng/g), whereas norBUP was never detected. Intravenous injection of crushed tablets, a concomitant intake of psychotropics (especially benzodiazepines), and the high dosage of the BUP formulation available in France appear to be the major risk factors for such fatalities.",

Alprazolam 1 mg/mL, chloroquine phosphate 15 mg/mL, cisapride 1 mg/mL, enalapril maleate 1 mg/mL, and hydralazine hydrochloride 4 mg/mL were each prepared in a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet and Ora-Plus (Paddock Laboratories), a 1:1 mixture of Ora-Sweet SF and Ora-Plus, and cherry syrup and placed in 120-mL amber clear polyethylene terephthalate bottles. Three bottles of each liquid were stored at 5 degrees C and three at 25 degrees C, all in the dark. Samples were taken initially and at various times up to 60 days for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography and assessment of appearance and odor; pH was measured. A mean of at least 91% of the initial drug concentration was retained for 60 days in the alprazolam, chloroquine phosphate, cisapride, and enalapril maleate liquids. The hydralazine hydrochloride liquids retained more than 90% of the initial concentration for only one day at 5 degrees C when prepared with Ora-Sweet-Ora-Plus and two days when prepared with Ora-Sweet SF-Ora-Plus and for less than a day in these preparations at 25 degrees C and in cherry syrup at 5 and 25 degrees C. No substantial changes in the appearance, odor, or pH of any liquid were observed. Alprazolam 1 mg/mL, chloroquine phosphate 15 mg/mL, cisapride 1 mg/mL, and enalapril maleate 1 mg/mL were stable in three extemporaneously compounded oral liquids for 60 days at 5 and 25 degrees C; hydralazine hydrochloride 4 mg/mL was stable at 5 degrees C for one day in Ora-Sweet-Ora Plus and for two days in Ora-Sweet SF-Ora-Plus.", 
    "24": "It was shown previously that low-Mg2+-induced epileptiform activity in rat entorhinal cortex slices changes with time from a pattern of serial seizure-like events (SLEs) to a state of continuously recurring epileptiform activity. Valproic acid blocked the early SLEs but not the late activity. It was proposed that the late activity is a model for pharmacoresistant status epilepticus since it was also refractory to phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and midazolam. In the present study, it is demonstrated that phenytoin (50 microM, n=6), phenobarbital (150 microM, n=7), and midazolam (50 microM, n=5) were able to block the early SLEs but not the late activity at the same concentrations. Carbamazepine (50 microM) reduced the duration of the SLEs from 21 +/-5 s to 4+/-3 s (P<0.01), the interictal interval from 123+/-27 s to 27+/-19 s (P<0.01), the SLE-associated rise of [K+]o from 7.7+/-0.5 mM to 5.7+/-0.8 mM (n=4, P<0.05), and the spread of the SLE between entorhinal cortex and neocortex from 4.0+/-0.6 s to 0.8+/-0.1 s (n=4, P<0.05). Lower concentrations of phenytoin (5 and 10 microM, n=5), carbamazepine (10 microM, n =6), and phenobarbital (50 microM, n = 4) had no effect. In conclusion, the hypothesis is supported that low-Mg2+-induced epileptiform activity in rat entorhinal cortex is an in vitro model for the transition from pharmacosensitive to pharmacoresistant status epilepticus.",

Intraoperative anesthesia was maintained with N2O-O2-isoflurane combined with thoracic epidural anesthesia (1st operation) or N2O-O2-sevoflurane (2nd-4th operation). Asthmatic attack, which AGA accompanies frequently, did not occur during these anesthetic managements. The steroid therapy, which is a fundamental means to control the allergic syndrome, might suppress asthma. However, asthmatic attack and systemic vasculitis should be kept in mind in anesthetic management of AGA.", 
    "27": "SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) using iomazenil (IMZ) as a ligand for benzodiazepine receptors has recently been developed. Feasibility of the technique for detecting neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex was evaluated in 17 patients with cerebral infarction, specifically, patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) thrombosis (n = 6), middle cerebral artery (MCA) thrombosis (n = 5) and embolism (n = 6). IMZ SPECT was performed 5 to 17 days after stroke. Following the injection of 123I-IMZ 167 or 222 MBq intravenously, images were obtained at 15 minutes (early image) and 180 minutes (late image). In 11 cases, 99mTc-HM-PAO (hexamethyl-propylamine oxime) SPECT was also performed to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF). MRI was performed in all cases to elucidate areas of infarct. Early images from IMZ SPECT correlated well with those from HM-PAO, suggesting that early scans using IMZ SPECT reflect mainly CBF. In late images from IMZ SPECT, observed lesions were consistent with infarcted areas on MRI in most cases. However, in 3 cases of ICA thrombosis, 1 case of MCA thrombosis and 1 case of embolism, late IMZ SPECT imaging showed that the affected area was wider than apparent infarcts on MRI, indicating that the cerebral cortex, which was intact on MRI, was also involved. In these patients, clinical signs of cortical involvement were observed as well. These results suggest that moderately reduced CBF may affect cortical neurons without inducing apparent infarct, and such damage can be detected with IMZ SPECT.",

The dose-dependent neurotoxic effect of AMPA was evaluated by the decrease in the activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), due to degeneration of cholinergic neurons. An injection of 25 mg/kg GYKI 52466 30 min prior to the striatal application of 50 nmol AMPA, followed by repeated application of GYKI 52466 (10 times 5 mg/kg at 10 min intervals, reaching a final dose of 75 mg/kg) was able to prevent neuronal damage monitored by ChAT activity. Conversely, co-injection of GYKI 52466 (50 and 75 mg/kg) with AMPA (50 and 100 nmol) did not elicit any significant protection against the neuronal loss as measured by the ChAT enzyme activity. Therefore, one dose of agonist decreasing ChAT activity by about 40% (50 nmol) was tested on [3H]girisopam binding sites and on the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acid protein. The lesions were measured on methylene blue-stained serial sections with a computer assisted image analysis program (NIH Image 1.60). As a result of the AMPA treatment [3H]girisopam binding sites became depleted, and the immunoreactivity of glial fibrillary acid protein increased and on the site of the injection in the striatum a lesion developed. In the presence of AMPA (50 nmol) administered intrastriatally, GYKI 52466 (75 mg/kg i.p.) was able to make the radioactive signal of [3H]girisopam reappear. The volume of AMPA induced neuronal damage in the striatum and the extent of gliosis was reduced. These data provide evidence for the neuroprotective effect of GYKI 52466, and suggest a potential therapeutic value in some neurological disorders.", 
    "36": "The present study investigated dream recall frequency and dream content of patients with insomnia in comparison to healthy controls. Patients' dream recall frequency was elevated, due mainly to their heightened frequency of nocturnal awakenings. Dream content seems to reflect waking life stressors found in these patients, i.e. dream emotions were more negative and dreams were characterized by themes of depression, 'negatives' in self-description and health themes. Patients taking antidepressants showed lower dream recall frequency than patients without any medication; benzodiazepine intake, however, did not affect dream recall frequency. Both drug groups reported more positively toned dreams than drug-free patients. It is suggested that future studies should use more dreams per subject in order to reduce error variance of the dream content measures and more detailed measures of waking life stress.",

Psychotropic drugs may have positive effects on personality disorders that show a close-relationship to Axis I disorders (e.g., schizotypal personality disorder--schizophrenia simplex; avoidant personality disorder--generalized social phobia; borderline personality disorder--affective disorders, etc.). In addition, psychotropic drugs may influence certain psychopathological symptom clusters (e.g., cognitive-perceptual organization, impulsivity/aggressivity, affective instability, anxiety/inhibition) present in various disorders. Psychotropic drugs may also be indicated when psychiatric comorbidity exists. The results of clinical pharmacological studies are reviewed with reference to cluster A, B, and C personality disorders. Some guidelines can be drawn from these trials. Clinically, the use of psychotropic drugs in symptomatic crises should be considered, especially when a secondary psychiatric comorbidity exists. Pharmacotherapy is well indicated for personality disorders closely associated with Axis I disorders. Usually pharmacotherapy is short term, although in some cases long-term treatment may be promising. However, pharmacotherapy must always refer to a supportive therapeutic interaction between physician and patient.",

Haemodynamic stress can contribute to myocardial ischaemia; therefore, this study was designed to observe prospectively the cardiorespiratory changes during UGIE using either midazolam or propofol for conscious sedation. Thirty-four patients, aged 50 years and older, ASA physical status I-III, scheduled for elective UGIE with sedation, were studied. Oxygen saturation, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure and Holter ECG were recorded continuously starting 15 min before sedation until 15 min after the endoscopy. In addition, plasma catecholamine concentrations were determined. The results of this study are consistent with previous reports that cardiopulmonary events may occur during endoscopy, with or without sedation. Both midazolam and propofol sedation may provide some protection against haemodynamic stress in response to insertion and manipulation of the endoscope, but sedation can also contribute to the occurrence of hypoxaemia.",

Nevertheless, limited clinical data are available to evaluate the effect of severe head injury on pharmacokinetics. The disruption of the blood-brain barrier secondary to trauma and/or subsequent hyperosmolar therapy can be expected to result in higher than expected brain drug concentrations. Aggressive dietary protein supplementation may result in increased oxidative drug metabolism. These effects may counterbalance inhibitory influences on drug metabolism secondary to cytokine release during the acute phase response. Alterations in protein binding can also be anticipated with the hypoalbuminaemia and increases in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein typically observed in these patients. Based on studies in other patient populations, moderate hypothermia, a treatment strategy in patients with head injury, can decrease drug metabolism. The pharmacokinetics of the following drugs in patients with severe head injury have been studied: phenytoin, pentobarbital (pentobarbitone), thiopental (thiopentone), tirilazad, and the agents used as marker substrates, antipyrine, lorazepam and indocynanine green (ICG). Several studies have documented increase in metabolism over time with phenytoin, pentobarbital, thiopental, antipyrine and lorazepam. Increases in tirilazad clearance were also observed but attributed to concurrent phenytoin therapy. No changes in the pharmacokinetics of ICG were apparent following head injury. With the frequent use of potent inhibitors of drug metabolism (e.g., cimetidine, ciprofloxacin) the potential for drug interaction is high in patients with severe head injury. Additional pharmacokinetic investigations are recommended to optimise pharmacological outcomes in patients with severe head injury.", 
    "40": "To assess the effect of itraconazole, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alprazolam, the study was conducted in a double-blind randomized crossover manner with two phases of treatment with itraconazole-placebo or placebo-itraconazole. Ten healthy male subjects receiving itraconazole 200 mg/day or matched placebo orally for 6 days took an oral 0.8 mg dose of alprazolam on day 4 of each treatment phase. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 h after alprazolam dosing, together with the assessment of psychomotor function by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Visual Analog Scale and Udvalg for kliniske unders\u00f8gelser side effect rating scale. Itraconazole significantly (P < 0.01) increased the area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to infinity (252 +/- 47 versus 671 +/- 205 ng h/ml), decreased the apparent oral clearance (0.89 +/- 0.21 versus 0.35+/-0.10 ml/min per kg) and prolonged the elimination half-life (15.7 +/- 4.1 versus 40.3 +/- 13.5 h) of alprazolam. The test performed during itraconazole treatment showed significantly depressed psychomotor function. It is suggested that itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, increases plasma concentration of alprazolam via its inhibitory effects on alprazolam metabolism. Thus, this study supports previous studies suggesting that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme catalyzing the metabolism of alprazolam. Enhanced side effects of alprazolam by itraconazole coadministration were probably reflected by these pharmacokinetic changes.", 
    "41": "As many as half of all schizophrenic patients have abused alcohol or illicit drugs. This study determines the extent of substance abuse in a treatment-resistant population and assesses the response of this population to olanzapine treatment. Sixty patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia were included in an open 7-week trial of up to 25 mg/day of olanzapine. A history of substance abuse was present in 23 (38%) of the patients. At baseline evaluation, patients with a history of substance abuse had lower CGI scores and less negative symptomatology while having a higher rate of tardive dyskinesia. The overall group improved significantly over time. There were no differences in response between the substance-abusing (SA) and non-substance-abusing (NSA) patients as measured by the total BPRS, GGI and SANS ratings. The NSA group had significantly greater improvement in negative symptoms as measured by the BPRS negative symptom factor. Sixty-nine per cent (16/23) of the SA group and 60% (22/37) of the NSA were considered olanzapine responders by a priori criteria (p = NS). Extrapyramidal symptoms declined significantly in the overall group, but did not significantly differ between the SA and NSA groups. Treatment-refractory patients with prior substance abuse had a comparable outcome on olanzapine therapy to those with no history of abuse, as well as no increase in adverse effects. This suggests that olanzapine may be of benefit to SA patients who have a greater tendency for antipsychotic side effects and tardive dyskinesia.", 
    "42": "The effects of short-term use of a small dose of dexamethasone on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the CYP3A4 substrate, triazolam, were examined. In a randomized, double-blind cross-over study with two phases, ten healthy volunteers were given either 1.5 mg dexamethasone or placebo once a day for 4 days. On the 5th day, 0.5 mg triazolam was administered orally. Plasma triazolam concentrations and effects of triazolam were measured for 10 hr. Dexamethasone did not have statistically significant effects on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam. The mean total area under the plasma triazolam concentration-time curve was, however, 19% smaller during the dexamethasone phase than during the placebo phase (11.4 +/- 5.7 ng ml-1 hr versus 14.1 +/- 8.8 ng ml-1 hr (mean +/- S.D.); P = 0.09). The four psychomotor tests employed did not show significant differences in the effects of triazolam between the phases. Although dexamethasone had only small effects on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of triazolam in the present study, higher doses or prolonged use of dexamethasone might cause a more pronounced induction of CYP3A4. Further studies on the effects of dexamethasone on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates in man are needed.", 
    "43": "The authors studied the content of norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and their metabolites in the hypothalamus and striatum of BALB/c mice after injection of tranquilizers phenazepam (0.05 mg/kg) and hydazepam (1 mg/kg). The drugs differed in their effect on the monoamine content in the brain structures under study, which was evidence of the difference in the mechanisms of their action.", 
    "44": "The work discusses the neurochemical correlates of rat brain dopamin-synaptic activity after injection of 0.5 mg/kg rudotel (medazepam) as compared with intact animals. The parameters of functioning of D2-receptors in [3H]-dopamine binding, the content of catecholamines and their metabolites (high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection) were studied in the dopaminergic system in different brain areas (the striatum, frontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and accumbence).", 
    "45": "In clinical practice, patients are encountered who are partial responders or nonresponders to clozapine. There are others who are unable to tolerate a high dosage of clozapine. In the two cases presented, we propose an alternative strategy using olanzapine in combination with clozapine in treatment-refractory patients. Olanzapine was found to be helpful in these patients, however, controlled studies are needed.", 
    "46": "Progress in drug therapy, endoscopic hemostasis and interventional radiology reduced the number of surgical operation for gastrointestinal bleeding. In the upper gastrointestinal bleeding, histamine H2-blockers reduced the number of operation. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) were as effective as H2-blockers, or more effective than H2-blockers. Intragastric pH was raised to over 6 and was maintained in high level with the therapies using intravenous PPI injection. Oral administration of PPI also raised gastric pH to over 6 on the next day of the treatment, and then succeeded to treat bleeding. More effective and reliable therapies using PPIs are needed for rapid raising of intragastric pH and maintaining it in high level to treat upper gastrointestinal bleeding.", 
    "47": "Since chlordiazepoxide was introduced in 1961, the benzodiazepines have had many important roles in the pharmacotherapy of various disorders. This drug class for the central nervous system has been considered one of the safest in use for 35 years, especially when the benzodiazepines are compared with the barbiturates they often replaced. The objective of this article is to provide an update on the availability and distribution of benzodiazepines around the world and to discuss their most common clinical applications. Adverse effects of benzodiazepines, observed after long-term therapeutic use and after overdoses, are also presented. Triazolam is discussed because this benzodiazepine was removed from the market by regulatory authorities in the United Kingdom in 1991. Benzodiazepines will continue to have an important role in clinical medicine. Their clinical use, however, should be monitored more closely because of the greater awareness of their adverse effects after long-term use and because of the potential for misuse and abuse.", 
    "48": "Perioperative haemodynamic changes leading to severe circulatory problems during open-heart surgery still represent dreaded complications. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between the use of applied anaesthetic agents and alterations of the contact phase of the intrinsic blood-clotting system, as changes within the kallikrein-kinin system can lead to a fall in blood pressure. In a randomized study, parameters of the kallikrein-kinin system, coagulation and fibrinolysis were determined for 36 patients with aortocoronary bypass operations. The patients had been given either midazolam/fentanyl or propofol/alfentanil to maintain anaesthesia. Perioperative blood pressure values were registered at seven fixed points. The measured values of the factor XIIa-like activity and the kallikrein-like activity suggested a higher activation of the contact phase, when propofol/alfentanil was given. From the start of the extracorporeal circulation (ECC) to the end of the operation, the kallikrein-like activities in the propofol/alfentanil group were significantly higher than those of the midazolam/fentanyl group. Also, the results of the kallikrein inhibition capacity and the indicators of fibrinolysis (t-PA and D-dimers) indicate a stronger activation of the contact phase--at least at the beginning of recirculation--and as a result of it, a stronger fibrinolysis within the propofol/alfentanil group. In addition, the hypotensive side-effects differed significantly between the two groups. Patients receiving propofol/alfentanil needed the triple amount of antihypotonicum to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure above 75 mmHg. With the results of this study, a correlation between the application of propofol/alfentanil, contact phase activation, with activation of the kallikrein-kinin-bradykinin system and the observed hypotension, can be presumed.", 
    "49": "Chronic haloperidol treatment typically produces late-onset, purposeless oral chewing movements in laboratory rats with a prevalence of 40 to 60%. Chronic clozapine does not produce these movements. Based on the phenomenologic and pharmacologic similarities between these rat chewing movements and human tardive dyskinesia (TD), the animal movements are often used as a model of tardive dyskinesia (TD). Here we report results of the association of oral chewing movements in rats with chronic administration of two new antipsychotic drugs, olanzapine and sertindole. Because each of these antipsychotic drugs has a very low incidence of acute Parkinsonism in human studies, they are candidates for showing a low tardive dyskinesia risk. Neither new drug produced a significant incidence of haloperidol-like chewing in rats, nor did movement ratings after their chronic administration differ from placebo; whereas, haloperidol produced a 60% prevalence of purposeless chewing and a prevalence significantly increased from placebo. This low rate of oral dyskinesias in rats is consistent with several of the preclinical characteristics of the drugs and correlates with their low acute motor side effects in clinical trials. We propose, although have not yet tested in humans, that these animal results will predict low TD liability of these drugs.", 
    "50": "Specific phobia is an anxiety disorder that does not respond to benzodiazepines. The elevated plus-maze test of anxiety is sensitive to benzodiazepines on trial 1, but during the first 5-min trial the nature of the anxiety generated changes to a specific fear of heights, and, as a result, on trial 2 the rats no longer respond to benzodiazepines. However, rats that received reversible bilateral lesions of the basolateral amygdala (by lidocaine injection) immediately after trial 1 responded with an anxiolytic response to chlordiazepoxide when tested 48 h later on trial 2. Those that received vehicle injections after trial 1 showed the usual lack of response to chlordiazepoxide on trial 2. Thus, the basolateral amygdala plays a crucial role in the consolidation of information that leads to the formation of a specific phobia and subsequent insensitivity to benzodiazepines.", 
    "51": "Two Wistar rat lines, selectively bred for high-anxiety-related behavior (HAB) and low-anxiety-related behavior (LAB) in the elevated plus-maze test, were tested for the susceptibility of their behavioral characteristics to anxiolytic treatment and for their endocrine and physiological reactivity to different stressors. Injection of 1 mg/kg diazepam failed to affect line differences in coping strategy but resulted in a marked (20-fold) decrease in plus-maze anxiety in HAB rats; whereas, the anxiolytic effect was less pronounced in LAB animals. Biotelemetrical measurements revealed that HAB and LAB rats do not significantly differ in their baseline body temperature, locomotor activity, food and water intake, or in stress-induced alterations of the diurnal rhythms in these parameters. However, line differences were found in acute changes in body temperature and locomotor activity following stress exposure, LAB rats responding with a greater, albeit shorter, increase in body temperature and activity than HAB animals. Basal ACTH and corticosterone plasma levels as well as pituitary reactivity to intravenously administered CRH (40 ng/kg) were similar in both lines, although, especially in response to plus-maze exposure, HAB rats tended toward higher ACTH secretion than LAB rats. These data confirm that animals with high or low basal levels of anxiety may be a promising model for studying the mechanisms of action of anxiolytic substances. Nevertheless, the endocrine findings support the notion that the reactivity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical system and anxiety-related behavior can be regulated independently.", 
    "52": "We report a case of a 43-year old woman with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who exhibited atypical absence seizures, atonic seizures and generalized toniclonic seizures which were not controlled by antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment. Because of this, felbamate (FBM) (1800 mg per day) was progressively added to the pre-existent therapy. The patient underwent a 24-hour-video-EEG monitoring before and after 4 months of FBM therapy. Analysis of the video-EEG signal recorded during wakefulness revealed the presence of ictal activity represented by repetitive, bilateral, slow spike and wave bursts underlying atypical absence seizures; the ictal activity occurring during non-REM sleep was characterized by runs of bilateral, rapid, high-voltage spikes followed by slow spike and wave complexes corresponding to brief tonic seizures. FBM therapy induced disappearance of the EEG ictal slow, spike and wave complexes leaving rather unaffected the runs of spikes. Computerized analysis of both the EEG background activity and the sleep structure displayed a better organization of the global cerebral rhythms under FBM treatment. Our findings suggest a selective effect of FBM on the ictal atypical spike and wave pattern. The differential effect of FBM on ictal patterns may be a reflection of a different action on the excitatory and inhibitory systems.", 
    "53": "1. Exposure to a combined forced swimming-confinement stress resulted in a decrease in insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II) mRNA levels in the whole brain (without the cerebellum) and in the isolated brain areas of the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum. 2. In an effort to elucidate the neurotransmitter systems involved in this stress-induced decrease, animals were injected prior to exposure to the stress, with either propranolol, diazepam, or MK-801. 3. Administration of diazepam or MK-801 did not affect the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA in any of the three brain areas examined. 4. Administration of propranolol prior to the exposure to the stress inhibited the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA in the cerebellum. Propranolol had no such effect in the cerebral cortex or the hippocampus. 5. Our results suggest that in the cerebellum, the stress-induced decrease in IGF-II mRNA is mediated by beta 2-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "54": "Preliminary data suggest that decreased serum iron levels predict the progression of catatonia to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). This study examines the predictive value of low serum iron in this NMS conversion and explores other potential significance of serum iron in catatonia.", 
    "55": "Fifty patients with catatonia were prospectively identified at two psychiatric intensive care units during a 3-year period [incidence of 5% (39/716) and 13% (11/86) respectively]. Serum iron was measured in 39 episodes. Seventeen episodes (44%) showed low serum iron levels. A retrospective chart review of patients identified was conducted, comparing those with low and normal serum iron levels.", 
    "56": "Low serum iron levels were associated with malignant catatonia, excited catatonia, and poor responses to benzodiazepines. There were 7 episodes of malignant catatonia. All had low serum iron. Neuroleptic were used in 5 of them, and all 5 evolved into NMS. No such NMS conversion was noted in those with normal serum iron or in nonmalignant catatonia with low serum iron. Seven episodes (with low serum iron) failing benzodiazepine therapy responded subsequently to lithium-neuroleptic combination therapy.", 
    "57": "Malignant catatonia, associated with low serum iron, is at high risk of evolving into NMS. Low serum iron in nonmalignant catatonia does not predict this NMS conversion. Excited catatonia as a catatonic subtype (associated with low serum iron and unfavorable benzodiazepine responses) deserves more research attention. There appears to be a possible connection between treatment resistance to benzodiazepines, favorable responses to lithium-neuroleptic combination, and low serum iron.", 
    "58": "This paper presents our experience with patients admitted for poisoning to the adult medical intensive care unit (MICU), Tan Tock Seng Hospital, from 1 January 1993 to 31 December 1995. Case records of 50 consecutive patients admitted to the MICU for management of poisoning were retrospectively analysed for epidemiologic data and intensive care interventions. There were equal proportions of male and female patients. The majority (76%) were in the economically productive age group of 21 to 60 years old. Most patients (24 out of 50) stayed for 1 day only. The most common drugs involved were organophosphates and carbamates (16 occurrences), benzodiazepines (12 occurrences), tricyclic antidepressants (12 occurrences), and phenothiazines (8 occurrences). About a third involved multiple-agent poisoning; this was significantly more common in males. Fifty-eight per cent of patients had suicidal intent. There were 4 deaths (8%) during this period; 3 of these were due to poisoning by organophosphates and carbamates. Seventeen patients were ventilated, 2 underwent peritoneal dialysis, and 1 underwent forced diuresis.", 
    "59": "It is becoming increasingly evident that GAD is a chronic condition with repeated acute-on-chronic episodes. Treatment in the short term relies on the benzodiazepines, which are rapid in action, providing substantial symptomatic relief with a low incidence of side-effects and low toxicity in overdose. The risk of more serious unwanted effects in the long term, including some risk of physical dependence, has led to a move towards alternative treatments both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic. Antidepressants are being used on a long-term basis, but data are sparse to confirm their efficacy in GAD. Anxiety management and cognitive-behavioural techniques are rivalling pharmacotherapy in popularity. None the less, research seeking optimal ways of combining therapies remains an urgent priority.", 
    "60": "The treatment of anxiety has evolved through various phases. Currently, there is a growing recognition that anxiety disorders are frequently chronic and/or recurrent. There is also less optimism than a decade ago that benzodiazepines will be replaced by alternative agents that are not active at the benzodiazepine receptor. Consequently, the understanding and management of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal continue to be of some clinical importance. This article briefly reviews the withdrawal syndrome and the pharmacological and patient variables that contribute to it. It then summarizes the various approaches to managing benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal.", 
    "61": "A benzodiazepine binding assay directed separation led to the identification of 3 flavones baicalein (1), oroxylin A (2), and skullcapflavone II (3) from the water extract of Scutellaria baicalensis root. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 interacted with the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors with a Ki value of 13.1, 14.6 and 0.36 micromol/L, respectively.", 
    "62": "The influence of kavapyrones from Piper methysticum Forst. on the GABAA receptor was demonstrated using radioreceptor assays. Both the dienolide yangonin and the genuine enolide enantiomers (+)-kavain, (+)-dihydrokavain, (+)-methysticin, and (+)-dihydromethysticin enhanced the specific binding of [3H]bicuculline methochloride ([3H]BMC). The kavapyrones have been investigated at assay concentrations between 100 microM and 10 nM. (+)-Kavain, (+)-methysticin and (+)-dihydromethysticin showed maximal enhancements of 18% to 28% at a concentration of 0.1 microM, whereas a 100-fold concentration of (+)-dihydrokavain revealed a similar modulatory activity of 22%. In the presence of 1 microM yangonin an increase of about 21% of the specific [3H]BMC binding was observed. Desmethoxyyangonin did not alter the binding behavior of the GABAA-receptor. A structure comparison of desmethoxyyangonin and yangonin indicated that the aromatic methoxy group was of particular importance for the modulatory activity. In contrast, the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring did not influence the modulatory activity of the enolides in a decisive manner. A structure comparison of desmethoxyyangonin and (+)-kavain revealed that an angular lactone ring was an important structure requirement. Both the enolides and the dienolides did not inhibit the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepan. Thus, the influence on the GABAA receptor was not based upon an interaction of these kavapyrones with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "63": "We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 66 patients treated for generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus at the Ege University neurological intensive care unit from 1988 to 1997. Seventy-two per cent of the study group had a pre-existing seizure disorder, and antiepileptic drug withdrawal was the most prominent cause of status epilepticus. The other causes included drug toxicity, central nervous system infection, cerebrovascular disease, tumour and trauma. Seventy-three per cent of all patients responded to the first-line therapy (diazepam and/or phenytoin), and the remainder were considered to have refractory status epilepticus and required pentobarbital anaesthesia. Overall case fatality was 21%, but death could be attributed directly to status epilepticus and/or treatment complication in 10% of the study group. Major determinants of fatal outcomes were: increasing age, longer duration of status epilepticus before initiation of therapy and central nervous system infection as a causal factor.", 
    "64": "The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) dose-dependently (3.0-30.0 mg/kg) displayed anxiolytic activity, as measured by an increase in open arm exploration time in the elevated plus-maze (EPM), following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration in rats. Acute administration of 7-NI at 30.0 mg/kg significantly (P < 0.05) increased open arm exploration time by 176% compared to vehicle control, similar to the benzodiazepine diazepam at 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg (+ 191 and + 200%, respectively). However, 39 h following subchronic 5-day administration of diazepam twice daily (bid) at 3.0 mg/kg, diazepam was devoid of anxiolytic activity at 1.0 mg/kg, as measured by no difference in open arm exploration time compared to vehicle control, while the 3.0 mg/kg dose still produced a significant (P < 0.05) 175% increase in open arm exploration time. In contrast, following subchronic administration of 7-NI (30.0 mg/kg, bid), a significant (P < 0.01) enhancement in open arm exploration time was observed at 30.0 mg/kg (+ 665% compared to control). Therefore, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by 7-NI resulted in anxiolysis similar to diazepam following acute administration in the EPM. However, following subchronic administration, unlike diazepam which showed an attenuation of anxiolytic activity, 7-NI displayed enhanced anxiolytic efficacy and was devoid of tolerance.", 
    "65": "We have studied the properties of GABA responses in oligodendrocyte-type 2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor cells derived from primary cultures of the neonatal rat brain. In whole cell voltage clamp recordings, rapid application of 1-10 mM GABA elicited current responses in > 85% of the cells examined. The dose-response relationship pooled from nine progenitor cells was best fit by a logistic function of EC50=113 microM and Hill coefficient=0.9. In contrast to the rate of current deactivation, the rate of current activation exhibited marked concentration-dependence. Pharmacologically, GABA, muscimol and ZAPA ((Z)-3[(aminiiminomethyl)thio]prop-2-enoic acid sulphate) produced responses with ligand-specific kinetics, whereas glycine and the GABA(C) receptor agonist CACA were without effect; bicuculline methochloride acted as a competitive antagonist. Neither the amplitude nor the kinetics of currents produced by 100 microM GABA were affected by the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (1 microM). Similarly the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist DMCM (1 microM) was also without effect. GABA-activated currents reversed polarity within 2 mV of the calculated Cl- equilibrium potential. With brief agonist pulses deactivation was monoexponential, however, unlike neurones the rate of deactivation was voltage-independent. Desensitisation of responses to 10 mM GABA was bi-exponential and accelerated at depolarised membrane potentials. Increasing the amount of GABA(A) receptor desensitisation (by increasing the duration of the agonist exposure) consistently produced a slowing of deactivation.", 
    "66": "We report a case a carbamazepine (CBZ) intoxication with negative myoclonus that occurred 4 weeks after clobazam (CLB) had been added to a stable regimen of CBZ and topiramate (TPM). Both CBZ and CBZ-epoxide (CBZ-E) blood levels were elevated, and the symptoms resolved quickly when CBZ dosage was reduced and CLB discontinued. CLB was reintroduced a year later with the patient's consent, and the time course of the interaction was studied: CBZ and CBZ-E levels increased slowly over 12 days. The interaction is thus probably related to the progressive increase in Nor-CLB.", 
    "67": "The effects of acute food deprivation and acute cold exposure on 24-hr urinary isatin excretion in rats and a mechanism responsible for changes in urinary isatin excretion during stress were investigated. This is the first study to demonstrate by HPLC that urinary isatin excretion is increased by stress. Both types of stress induced a marked increase in urinary isatin excretion during the 24 hr following the initiation of stress. Dexamethasone administration prevented the increase in urinary isatin excretion induced by both of the different types of stress. Furthermore, administration of either the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam or the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine prevented the increase in urinary isatin excretion induced by acute food deprivation, whereas the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamate proved ineffective. These observations suggest that during stress, activated catecholamine-synthesizing cells and corticotropin-releasing factor cells, both of which play central roles in stress responses, may be involved in total isatin production. Isatin may serve as an endogenously generated marker for some types of stress.", 
    "68": "In this study, we evaluated the effect of several ligands active at the central-type and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) (clonazepam, diazepam, PK11195 and Ro5-4864) on the growth and differentiation of B16 melanoma cells. All tested BzR ligands were able to suppress proliferation of the cells at the micromolar range and in a concentration-dependent manner. However, agents selectively active at the peripheral-type BzR (PK11195 and Ro5-4864) exhibited more potent antiproliferative activity. In addition, the BzR ligands were demonstrated to affect the cell cycle by reducing the percent of cells in the S phase and increasing the percent in the G2/M phase. BzR ligands induced cellular phenotypic alterations, which have been previously shown to be associated with melanoma cell differentiation. These alterations included: marked morphological changes, enhancement of melanogenesis, lipid accumulation and increase in the activity of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. All BzR ligands induced a marked reduction in the concentration of UTP and most of them did the same in GTP and CTP, while ATP levels were not significantly altered. In summary, BzR ligands (clonazepam, diazepam, PK11195 and Ro5-4864) were found to exert antitumor effects in B16 melanoma cells. These findings encourage further studies of a possible therapeutic potential of BzR ligands in treatment of melanoma.", 
    "69": "Delirium is an organic psychiatric syndrome characterized by fluctuating consciousness and impaired cognitive functioning. Eleven delirious patients were treated with olanzapine (dosage mean +/- standard deviation [SD]: 8.2 +/- 3.4 mg qhs), and 11 delirious control patients were treated with haloperidol (dosage mean +/- SD: 5.1 +/- 3.5 mg qhs). Peak response time was similar in both groups. Five of the 11 olanzapine patients showed significant improvement (> 50% score reduction) on the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS) and no patients had side effects, whereas 6 of the 11 control subjects showed improvement on the DRS and 5 had extrapyramidal symptoms or excessive sedation. Olanzapine may be a useful alternative to haloperidol in the treatment of delirium in hospitalized patients.", 
    "70": "Successful treatment of seizure disorders in small animals requires proper patient assessment, understanding the principles of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, designing a strategy for pharmacotherapy, and plans for emergency treatment. Several levels of assessment are needed in managing an epileptic patient to include the diagnosis, effectiveness of therapy, and health-related quality of life assessments. Three levels of diagnosis are important in determining the appropriate AED therapy: 1) confirmation that an epileptic seizure has occurred, and if so, the seizure type(s) manifested; 2) diagnosis of the seizure etiology; and 3) determination of an epileptic syndrome. Monotherapy is the initial goal of treating any cat or dog with epilepsy to reduce possible drug-drug interactions and adverse effects. Unfortunately, many of the AEDs useful in people cannot be prescribed to small animals either due to inappropriate pharmacokinetics (too rapid of an elimination), and potential hepatotoxicity. Thus, the most commonly used AEDs in veterinary medicine are from the same mechanistic category, that of enhancing inhibition of the brain. Antiepileptic drugs can be classified into three broad mechanistic categories: 1) enhancement of inhibitory processes via facilitated action of gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA); 2) reduction of excitatory transmission; and 3) modulation of membrane cation conductance. Pharmacotherapy strategies should be designed based on the decision when to start treatment, choice of the appropriate AED, and proper AED monitoring and adjustment. Information is presented for the current AEDs of choice, phenobarbital and bromide. Additional guidelines are provided for administration of newer AEDs, felbamate and gabapentin. All owners should be aware that emergency therapy may be necessary if recurrent or severe seizures occur in their pet. A rapid, reliable protocol is presented for the emergency management of seizuring cats and dogs in the hospital and at home. Home treatment with per rectal administration of diazepam in the dog has proven to be an effective means of reducing seizure frequency and owner anxiety. Treating each animal as an individual, applying the philosophy that seizure prevention is better than intervention, and consulting specialists to help formulate or revise treatment plans will lead to improved success in treating seizure disorders in the cat and dog.", 
    "71": "Male Swiss mice were tested 24 h after training in a one-trial step-through inhibitory avoidance task. Low subeffective doses of d-(+)-glucose (10 mg/kg, ip), but not its stereoisomer l-(-)-glucose (30 mg/kg,ip), administered immediately after training, and AF-DX 116 (0.3 mg/kg,ip), a presynaptic muscarinic receptor antagonist, given 10 min after training, interact to improve retention. Insulin (8 IU/kg, ip) impaired retention when injected immediately after training, and the effects were reversed, in a dose-related manner, by AF-DX 116 (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg, ip) administered 10 min following insulin. Since AF-DX 116 possibly blocks autoreceptors mediating the inhibition of acetylcholine release from cholinergic nerve terminals, the present data support the view that changes in the central nervous system glucose availability, subsequent to modification of circulating glucose levels, influence the activity of central cholinergic mechanisms involved in memory storage of an inhibitory avoidance response in mice.", 
    "72": "Two types of receptors for gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) have been identified in the gastrointestinal tract and in the central nervous system: CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptors. Here we report evidence for the expression of CCK(B) receptors in the guinea-pig kidney. Specific binding sites for [125I]gastrin were detected in sections of the guinea-pig kidney: Binding was saturable, pH-, temperature- and time-dependent, and specific for gastrin-related peptides. The potencies for inhibition of binding of [125I]gastrin were CCK-8 > gastrin 17-I > CCK(B) receptor antagonist L-365,260 > des(SO3)CCK-8 > CCK(A) receptor antagonist L-364,718. Autoradiography demonstrated specific [125I]gastrin binding to medullary collecting ducts and to a much lesser extent to glomeruli, but not over other structures. CCK(B) receptor cDNA fragments were amplified by RT-PCR from total kidney, isolated tubuli and from tissues known to express CCK(B) receptors such as stomach and brain. The kidney might therefore be a previously unidentified site of action for gastrin and cholecystokinin-related peptides.", 
    "73": "We studied the effect of pirenzepine on gastric secretion kinetics in rats in a hypochlorhydric state induced by lansoprazole, a proton pump inhibitor. Pirenzepine was administered intramuscularly at a dosage of 20 mg/kg twice daily; and lansorprazole, subcutaneously at 50 mg/kg once daily, both every day for 4 weeks. After the 4-week treatment, serum gastrin and plasma somatostatin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. In addition, gastrin cells, somatostatin cells, and enterochromaffin-like cells were immunostained and counted. Serum gastrin levels were elevated, and gastrin and enterochromaffin-like cell numbers increased in the group on lansoprazole alone, compared with these values in the control group (which received distilled water). In the group on the lansoprazole and pirenzepine combination, serum gastrin levels decreased, and gastrin and enterochromaffin-like cell numbers were significantly decreased, compared with the respective variables in the group on lansoprazole alone, while the number of somatostatin cells increased in the group on the combination. Plasma somatostatin levels did not vary significantly in any group. It was thus demonstrated that pirenzepine corrects the abnormal gastric secretion kinetics resulting from treatment with lansoprazole alone, such as hypergastrinemia and gastrin and enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia.",

The various adverse effects of antipsychotic drugs as well as their assessment and management are reviewed.", 
    "76": "Simple techniques for assessing adverse effects such as extrapyrimidal symptoms (EPS) are described. In some cases, adverse effects can be managed by dosage reduction and/or the use of adjunctive therapies such as antiparkinsonian agents and benzodiazepines. However, in some patients dose reduction carries the risk of symptom reemergence, while the commonly used adjunctive medications are associated with adverse effects of their own.", 
    "77": "Treatment-related side effects often require a reduction in dosage or a change in medication. Proper management can help encourage patient compliance and improve the outcome of antipsychotic treatment. The availability of the newer atypical antipsychotics offers another alternative, because they are associated with a much lower incidence of antipsychotic-induced side effects.",

    "79": "A Medline literature search was performed for the period January 1980 to September 1997 of randomized, double-blind comparison studies between anxiolytics and antidepressants in the acute treatment of adult patients with either MDD or GAD.", 
    "80": "Alprazolam, at doses double those generally recommended for anxiety disorders, appears to be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) in the acute treatment of mild to moderate MDD. Alprazolam was also found to have a more rapid onset of action than to TCAs, particularly for the improvement of anxiety, somatization, and insomnia. Two azapirones (buspirone and gepirone) also have demonstrated a modest acute antidepressant effect in preliminary studies, albeit only in a depressed outpatient sample with considerable anxiety at baseline. Finally, various antidepressant drugs (imipramine, trazodone, paroxetine) were shown to have, at the least, comparable efficacy to benzodiazepines (BZDs) in the acute treatment of GAD.", 
    "81": "The nonspecificity of treatment response suggests that GAD and MDD are 1) different expressions of a similar disorder with a common neurobiological substrate, 2) discrete diagnostic entities that respond to independent pharmacological effects of the same drugs, or 3) a combination of the two (heterogeneity hypothesis). The most relevant clinical finding is the efficacy of antidepressants in the acute treatment of GAD.", 
    "82": "Propriospinal myoclonus is a subtype of spinal myoclonus characterized by axial flexion or extension jerks, arrhythmic and prolonged muscle bursts with a pattern of activation consistent with a slow conduction within the propriospinal pathways. We describe a new idiopathic case of flexion propriospinal myoclonus occurring upon relaxation and drowsiness. This syndrome is to be added to the spectrum of movement disorders occurring during drowsiness.", 
    "83": "Orthostatic tremor is an unusual kind of potentially disabiling tremor appearing immediately when standing. Clinical examination is normal in primary form except for wide base standing and unsteadiness which disappear when walking. Arm tremor resembling essential tremor is found present in one third of cases. Electrophysiological exploration is necessary for diagnosis and shows a regular rapid tremor (frequency around 16 Hz). We present 10 new cases, 3 men and 7 women, 37 to 74 years old. Unsteadiness when standing was the predominant complaint in 9 cases, the other first described pains in the lower limbs. All had visible or palpable tremor predominant in thighs. Four patients had postural arm tremor, one had neurogen syndrome in the lower limbs corresponding to toxic polyneuropathy which developed after tremor. Electromyographic study found high frequency (13-17.3 Hz) rhythmic discharge in weight-bearing muscles. Orthostatic tremor cannot be considered as a clinical variant of postural essential tremor. Its pathophysiology is unknown but the efficacy of clonazepam, primidone or barbiturates suggests the impairment of the gabaergic system.", 
    "84": "Pharmacological modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors can provide important information on the types of subunits composing these receptors. In recombinant studies, zinc more potently inhibits alphabeta subunits compared with the alphabetagamma combination, whereas modulation by nanomolar concentrations of the benzodiazepine type 1-selective agonist zolpidem is conferred by the alpha1betagamma2 subunit combination. We examined four properties of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) from identified necortical pyramidal cells in rat brain slices: decay time constant, peak amplitude, rate of rise, and interevent interval. Exposure to 50 microM zinc reduced the decay time constant, peak amplitude, and rate of rise with no effect on interevent interval. Zolpidem enhanced mIPSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Both 20 and 100 nM zolpidem increased the decay time constants of mIPSCs. In some cells, both peak amplitude and rate of rise were also enhanced. All cells treated with zinc were also responsive to zolpidem. These results show that neocortical pyramidal cells have a population of GABAA receptors sensitive to both zinc and zolpidem.", 
    "85": "Increased number of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) have been found in some tumors outside the liver. The present study was to verify whether the PBR system is altered in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The levels of endogenous benzodiazepine-like compounds (BZDs), measured by radioreceptor binding technique after HPLC purification and the endogenous ligand for PBRs, termed diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), measured by radioimmunoassay utilizing a specific antibody for human DBI, were studied in the blood of 15 normal subjects, 12 liver cirrhosis and 10 patients with HCC. The levels of BZDs in serum were increased hundred fold in liver cirrhosis patients and slightly elevated in HCC patients. DBI was found to be increased in HCC patients. The binding recognition sites for PBRs (Bmax) were increased 4 to 7 fold in HCC tissue in comparison with that found in non-tumoral liver tissue (NTLT). On the contrary the concentrations of DBI were found to be significantly decreased in HCC tissue in comparison with the respective NTLT. These results seem to suggest an implication of PBRs and of their putative endogenous ligands in the metabolism of these neoplastic cells and possibly in their proliferation. The up-regulation of PBRs found in HCC tissue seems to indicate an increased functional activity of these receptors and opens up the possibility of new pharmacological and diagnostic approaches while the changes in the circulating endogenous ligands for the above receptors might be envisaged as early markers of tumorigenesis in liver cirrhosis.", 
    "86": "The benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam did not affect immobilization-elicited hyperglycemia, although a high dose increased blood glucose levels in normal mice. The serotonergic anxiolytic tandospirone reduced immobilization-induced hyperglycemia dose-dependently. Hyperglycemia elicited by immobilization stress was completely prevented by adrenalectomy but not by pretreatment with the corticosterone synthesis inhibitor dexamethasone. These results suggest that the effects of two anxiolytics, diazepam and tandospirone, on immobilization stress-induced hyperglycemia are quite different, although both drugs reduce anxiety. Furthermore, our results indicate that immobilization stress-elevated hyperglycemia is closely related to adrenaline release from the adrenal gland and that tandospirone may inhibit stress-induced hyperglycemia by modifying this mechanism.", 
    "87": "Antisecretory effect of intravenous quamatel (Q) and gastrocepin (G) was studied in 59 patients with duodenal ulcer. Mean maximal pH and delta-pH in antral portion of the stomach and its body were similar for Q and G, but pH responded to Q administration faster. The antisecretory effect of Q was more pronounced in males and young patients and was inversely proportional to initial acidity.", 
    "88": "Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of (+/-) pentazocine (10, 30 & 50 mg/kg), a Sigma opioid agonist, resulted in a dose dependent anticonvulsant action against maximal electroshock seizures in mice. This anticonvulsant effect of pentazocine was not antagonized by both the doses of naloxone (1 and 10 mg/kg) suggesting thereby that its anticonvulsant action is probably mediated by Sigma opiate binding sites. Its anticonvulsant effect was potentiated by both the anticonvulsant drugs viz. diazepam and diphenylhydantoin. Morphine, mu opioid agonist, on the other hand, failed to protect the animals against maximal electroshock seizures when it was given in doses of 10-40 mg/kg body wt.", 
    "89": "Behavioral modifications induced by psychotropic drugs result primarily from their pharmacological properties. According to classification of psychotropic drugs, sedative compounds contrast with psychostimulating medications. Behavioural effects of psychotropic drugs depend on dosing, subject's status (patient or healthy volunteer), acute or chronic administration, and environment. Some psychotropic compounds, particularly sedative drugs, decrease the level of mental alertness and cognitive functioning. But those deleterious effects tend to disappear during the course of a repeated administration. Some psychotropic drugs, especially benzodiazepines, induce a tolerance effect, eventually a psychic or a physiological dependence state evidenced by withdrawal reactions. Such similar dependence processes have been reported with other psychotropic drugs. Forensic problems have been attributed to some psychotropic compounds, like benzodiazepines: paradoxical aggressive reactions, psychomotor automatism. Psychotropic drugs usually can confer a positive effect on behaviour owing to their therapeutic action by the way of improving the illness and consequently the life of patients in the cases of depression, anxiety or schizophrenia.", 
    "90": "Despite unavoidable subjectivity, it would appear that the use of antidepressive, anxiolytic and hypnotic agents has increased over the past years, although consumption of benzodiazepines appears to have stabilized recently. It is generally accepted that there has been a trend to medicalization of mainly social problems. The following factors have been considered: type of the person's request, with an often dominant role related to assisted behavior; medical responses, frequently marked by a preferential if not exclusive reliance on the chemical compound; financial limitations on national medical expenses, quite probably an indirect cause of changing status and role of medicine distorting the therapeutic relationships; marketing phenomena involving major economic challenges. Faced with this conflictual situation, we must try to maintain the physician's freedom to practice for patient benefit.",

    "93": "The need to sedate terminally ill patients for uncontrolled symptoms has been previously documented in a few reports. A retrospective consecutive chart review was undertaken at a hospice in Cape Town, South Africa, to develop an understanding of the local experience and assess the potential for improved patient management. Twenty-three of seventy-six (30%) patients received sedating therapies: twenty patients for delirium, two patients for delirium and dyspnea, and one patient for dyspnea alone. Fourteen patients were sedated with a continuous subcutaneous infusion of midazolam, seven patients with intermittent doses of benzodiazepines, and two patients with chlorpromazine and lorazepam. The mean midazolam dose was 29 mg per day (median 30 mg; range 15-60 mg per day). Patients were sedated on average 2.5 days before death (median 1 day; range 4 hours-12 days). The mean equivalent daily dose of parenteral morphine in the last week of life showed a significantly higher mean for the sedated group, as compared to the nonsedated group. There was minimal investigation of reversible causes for delirium, none of the patients underwent an opioid rotation, and the opioid dose was seldom decreased. None of the patients received parenteral hydration. The prevalence for the use of sedating treatment is consistent with the range of other literature reports. Nevertheless, the wide disparity in the reported prevalence of these problems, and the ethical concerns raised by the relative frequency of this sedative approach, cannot be ignored.", 
    "94": "In a dark-light chamber in mice, kynurenic acid (KYNA, 200 mg/kg, i.p.), an endogenous neuroactive metabolite of tryptophan, attenuated the most stable effect of anxiogens in this model of anxiety--a decrease in the rate of leanings-out of the dark compartment --induced by caffeine, pentylenetetrazole and yohimbine, but not by beta-phenylethylamine (PEA). KYNA by itself did not alter behavior of mice in the chamber, in contrast to what has been observed in an elevated plus-maze, another model of anxiety, where KYNA had an anxiolytic pharmacological profile.", 
    "95": "There are no controlled studies to determine whether propofol given after the onset of lidocaine-induced seizures (posttreatment) stops lidocaine-induced seizures. In this study, we determined whether posttreatment with propofol abolishes lidocaine-induced epileptiform electroencephalogram (EEG) activity as effectively as does midazolam, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics during lidocaine-induced epileptiform EEG activity and its treatment. EEG activity and CSF dynamics were determined in two groups of anesthetized rabbits at each of four experimental conditions: baseline, lidocaine-induced epileptiform activity, treatment with midazolam (n = 6) or propofol (n = 6), and return to baseline. The analog EEG signal was converted into a set of digital parameters using aperiodic analysis, and CSF dynamics were determined using ventriculocistemal perfusion. Propofol (3.8 +/- 1.3 mg/kg) stopped epileptiform activity, as did midazolam (2.0 +/- 1.7 mg/kg). The rates of CSF formation or reabsorption and resistances to CSF reabsorption or flow at the arachnoid villi did not differ among conditions or between groups. Our results indicate that propofol and midazolam both terminate epileptiform activity without changing CSF dynamics.",

    "97": "Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine that purportedly binds selectively to certain GABA(A) receptor subtypes, is the most commonly prescribed hypnotic. The present article critically reviewed the extant experimental literature to determine whether the behavioral pharmacologic profile of zolpidem also differs from that of benzodiazepines. Specific topics that are reviewed include: 1) reinforcing effects and abuse potential, 2) discriminative-stimulus effects, 3) subject-rated drug effects, 4) performance-impairing effects, 5) tolerance-producing effects, and 6) physiological dependence-producing effects. Studies that employed both nonhumans and humans are reviewed. Based on the available literature, the most parsimonious conclusion is that despite its unique neuropharmacological profile, the behavioral effects of zolpidem are generally similar to those of benzodiazepines. However, it is important to note the dearth of perspective, experimental studies that directly compared zolpidem and a benzodiazepine. Because of the clinical relevance and paucity of published studies, future research should focus explicitly on assessing the reinforcing effects, abuse potential, performance-impairing effects, tolerance-producing effects, and dependence-producing effects of zolpidem relative to a benzodiazepine. Important issues such as the selection of an appropriate comparison drug and subject population, and the doses tested needed to be considered in these future studies.", 
    "98": "6-Bromo-3'-nitroflavone is a synthetic flavone derivative that selectively recognizes benzodiazepine receptors and has potent anxiolytic-like effects. Here, we describe in detail its pharmacological characterization. When i.p. injected in mice, 6-bromo-3'-nitroflavone (0.01-0.3 mg/kg) had an anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test. This effect was blocked by the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil. In addition, it exhibited anxiolytic-like actions when given orally (1 mg/kg). 6-Bromo-3'-nitroflavone did not exhibit myorelaxant effects (up to 30 mg/kg, i.p.). Unlike diazepam, this flavonoid produced no anterograde amnesia in a one-trial inhibitory avoidance learning. On the other hand, 6-bromo-3'-nitroflavone possessed mild anticonvulsant activity (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) and provoked sedative-depressant actions only at doses 100-1000 times higher than those producing anxiolytic-like effects. 6-Bromo-3'-nitroflavone (0.1-1 mM) produced a lower potentiation of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)-stimulated 36Cl- influx (126-138%) in comparison to diazepam (0.1 mM: 166%) in cerebral cortical membrane vesicles. Taken together, these findings suggest that 6-bromo-3'-nitroflavone has anxiolytic-like action possibly behaving as a partial agonist of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "99": "The anticonvulsant effects of some novel 2,3-benzodiazepines acting as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid/kainate (AMPA/KA) antagonists were evaluated in genetically epilepsy prone rats. The ED50 values against clonic and tonic seizures (in micromol/kg) revealed that the rank order of anticonvulsant activity was: GYKI 52466 > 2,3BZ-2 > 2,3 MBZ-2 > NBQX. Maximal anticonvulsant protection was observed 15-45 min after the i.p. administration of NBQX and GYKI 52466, 30-90 min after the i.p. administration of 2,3BZ-2, and 45-120 min after the i.p. administration of 2,3MBZ-2. The time course of plasma levels of rats treated with GYKI 52466 showed that peak plasma concentration was observed 15 min after i.p. administration, 2,3BZ-2 revealed that peak plasma concentration was achieved 45 min after i.p. administration, whereas following 2,3MBZ-2 administered i.p., two curves were detected; one is referred to the parent compound and the other to its demethylate metabolite that corresponds to 2,3BZ-2. The therapeutic index (ratio of TD50 values for impaired rotarod performance and ED50 values for anticonvulsant activity) revealed that NBQX and GYKI 52466 were slighly more toxic than 2,3BZ-2 and 2,3MBZ-2. The present data suggest that 2,3-benzodiazepines acting at AMPA/kainate receptors play an important role in the generation and/or propagation of the audiogenic seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone rats.", 
    "100": "The primary aim of the current experiments was to develop methods that engender vocalizations associated with positive social situations comprising affiliative behavior and feeding that could be quantified under controlled laboratory conditions and were sensitive to anxiolytic drugs. Classical conditioning procedures were used to elicit vocalizations during presentation of stimulus lights (i.e., CS condition) previously paired with either preferred foods (e.g., grapes, peanuts, bananas) or standard foods (e.g., monkey chow) as well as during presentation of both food types (i.e., UCS condition). When compared to the period before stimulus light presentation (i.e., Pre-CS condition), the rate, duration and number of elemental units of food-related \"twitter\" vocalizations were increased during the CS conditions regardless of food type. Monkeys spent significantly more time oriented toward the food box during the light stimulus that preceded preferred food than for the light stimulus that preceded standard food. However, twitter vocalizations were higher for standard food regardless of the stimulus conditions (i.e., Pre-CS, CS and UCS). Administration of the benzodiazepine full agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 1-10 mg/kg), the partial agonist bretazenil (BRZ, 1-10 mg/kg), the antagonist flumazenil (FLZ, 1-10 mg/kg) and ethyl alcohol (EtOH, 0.1-1.0 g/kg) differentially altered vocalizations. Although CDP and BRZ increased feeding of standard food, twitters were reduced across stimulus conditions. CDP and BRZ did not alter other social contact calls (i.e., \"peeps\"). FLZ also reduced twitters without altering peeps, but did not increase feeding. In contrast, EtOH did not increase feeding or peeps, but did increase food-related twitters. These results indicate that there is a dissociation between food-related behaviors, such as food consumption and orientation towards the food source, and vocal behaviors associated with group communication during feeding.", 
    "101": "The present study used a three-choice operant drug discrimination procedure to determine if NMDA-mediated discriminative stimulus effects could be separated from other stimulus effects of 2.0 g/kg ethanol. Adult male Long-Evans rats (n = 7) were trained to discriminate dizocilpine (0.17 mg/kg; i.g.) from ethanol (2.0 g/kg; i.g.) from water (4.7 ml; i.g.) using food reinforcement. Substitution tests were conducted following administration of the GABA(A) positive modulators allopregnanolone (5.6-30.0 mg/kg; i.p.), diazepam (0.3-10.0 mg/kg; i.p.) and pentobarbital (1.0-21.0 mg/kg; i.p.), the non-competitive NMDA antagonist phencyclidine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg; i.p.), the 5-HT1 agonists TFMPP (0.3-5.6 mg/kg; i.p.) and RU 24969 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg; i.p.), and isopropanol (0.10-1.25 g/kg; i.p.). Allopregnanolone, diazepam and pentobarbital substituted completely (>80%) for ethanol. Isopropanol partially (77%) substituted for ethanol. Phencyclidine substituted completely for dizocilpine. RU 24969 and TFMPP did not completely substitute for either training drug, although RU 24969 partially (62%) substituted for ethanol. Successful training of this three-choice discrimination indicates that the discriminative stimulus effects of 0.17 mg/kg dizocilpine were separable from those of 2.0 g/kg ethanol. The finding that attenuation of NMDA-mediated effects of ethanol occurred without altering significantly GABA(A)- and 5-HT1-mediated effects suggests that the NMDA component may be independent of other discriminative stimulus effects of 2.0 g/kg ethanol.", 
    "102": "Buprenorphine has been an important advance in care for drug abusers, but the toxic risk may be fatal. We report here two original series of buprenorphine poisoning in opiate abusers on substitution therapy.", 
    "103": "The first series included 20 males and 9 females, aged 20-35 years (mean = 27.5) with non-fatal poisoning. The second series included 20 subjects (19 males, 1 female) aged 14-48 years (mean = 26.6) with a fatal outcome. All subjects were opiate addicts taking high-dosage sublingual buprenorphine formulation as substitution therapy.", 
    "104": "Blood concentrations of buprenorphine were found in all cases to remain at a low level (1.0-2.3 ng/ml, m = 1.4 ng/ml, and 1.1-29.0 ng/ml, m = 8.4 ng/ml in non-fatal and fatal cases respectively). Almost all cases involved concomitant intake of psychotropic medications, especially benzodiazepines (18 non-fatal and 17 fatal cases).", 
    "105": "These observations confirm previously reported data on the danger of buprenorphine-benzodiazepine combinations. Intravenous injection of crushed tablets also appears to be a risk factor (8 deaths and 10 non-fatal poisonings). This series highlights the need for improvement in the recently developed French program for substitution therapy with high-dosage buprenorphine in heroin addicts.", 
    "106": "As a maintenance agent for opioid dependency, buprenorphine offers advantages such as a lower level of dependence and minimal withdrawal symptoms, due to its partial agonist properties at the micro-opioid receptor. Previous studies have shown 8 mg sublingual buprenorphine to be equivalent to 60 mg oral methadone in terms of retention rate and opioid-negative urine levels. In a 24-week, ongoing European study, 34 opioid-dependent subjects were assessed; 16 receiving buprenorphine and 18 methadone. A free dosing schedule was used with no upper limit for methadone dosing but with a maximum buprenorphine dose of 8 mg. Screening prior to the study excluded subjects with polysubstance dependence, somatic disease and/or HIV infection. Primary outcome measures were abstinence from other drugs, for which subjects provided weekly urine samples for analysis of opioids, cocaine and benzodiazepines, and retention in treatment. Patients in the buprenorphine group provided a greater proportion of negative urine samples, in particular cocaine-negative samples, compared with the methadone group, although this was not statistically significant. Retention in the buprenorphine group was significantly lower than in the methadone group, suggesting that the 8 mg buprenorphine limit may have biased the results in favour of methadone, and that this dose may have been too low for those subjects with high levels of dependence. However, buprenorphine is clearly effective in the more motivated subjects and further investigation in this subgroup is recommended.", 
    "107": "No specific therapy exists for hepatitis delta virus (HDV), which can cause severe liver disease. Molecular genetic studies have implicated the prenylation site of large delta antigen as a critical determinant of HDV particle assembly. We have established a cell culture model which produces HDV-like particles, and we show that delta antigen prenylation can be pharmacologically inhibited by the prenylation inhibitor BZA-5B. Furthermore, BZA-5B specifically abolishes particle production in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that the use of such a prenylation inhibitor-based antiviral therapy may be feasible and identify a novel class of potential antiviral agents.", 
    "108": "The concept that polyamines may represent a universal template in the receptor recognition process is embodied in the design of new selective muscarinic ligands. Tetraamines 4-7 and 16-20 and diamine diamides 8-15 were synthesized, and their pharmacological profiles at muscarinic receptor subtypes were assessed by functional experiments in isolated guinea pig left atrium (M2) and ileum (M3) and by binding assays in rat cortex (M1), heart (M2), submaxillary gland (M3), and NG 108-15 cells (M4). It has been confirmed that appropriate substituents on the terminal nitrogens of a tetraamine template can tune both affinity and selectivity for muscarinic receptors. The novel tetraamine C-tripitramine (17) was able to discriminate significantly M1 and M2 receptors versus the other subtypes, and in addition it was 100-fold more lipophilic than the lead compound tripitramine. Compound 14 (tripinamide), in which the tetraamine backbone was transformed into a diamine diamide one, retained high affinity for muscarinic subtypes, displaying a binding affinity profile (M2 > M1 > M4 > M3) qualitatively similar to that of tripitramine. Both these ligands, owing to their improved lipophilicity relative to tripitramine and methoctramine, could serve as tools in investigating cholinergic functions in the central nervous system. Furthermore, notwithstanding the fact that the highest affinity was always associated with muscarinic M2 receptors, for the first time polyamines were shown to display high pA2 values also toward muscarinic M3 receptors.", 
    "109": "Affinities of a series of substituted imidazobenzodiazepines at recombinant alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2, alpha5beta3gamma2, and alpha6beta3gamma2 GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor subtypes are reported. Many of these ligands displayed high affinities (low-nanomolar to subnanomolar scale) at all five receptor subtypes. Furthermore, a number of imidazobenzodiazepines exhibited relatively good selectivity at the alpha5-containing receptor isoform. For example, ligand 27 (RY-023) demonstrated a 55-fold higher selectivity at alpha5beta3gamma2 isoforms in comparison to other receptor subtypes. The affinity ratio of alpha1 (the most prevalent subtype in the brain) to alpha5 of this series of ligands ranged from 60- to 75-fold for the most selective ligands. Studies of quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) by means of comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) were carried out. As a result, examination of CoMFA models for all five receptor subtypes demonstrated their predictability for affinities of imidazobenzodiazepines at the five receptor subtypes. Regions of molecular fields which would favor or disfavor the binding affinity of a ligand at a specific receptor subtype were examined via CoMFA for alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha5, and alpha6 subtypes. A CoMFA regression analysis was applied to predict the ratio of Ki alpha1/Ki alpha5, an index for the selectivity of a ligand at the alpha5 subtype. All of the CoMFA models offered good cross-validated correlations for the ligands in the test set as well as the ratios of Ki alpha1/Ki alpha5, which demonstrated their potential for prediction.", 
    "110": "A method for determination of the atypical neuroleptic drug olanzapine in serum was developed. After a single-step liquid-liquid extraction, the compound was separated from other constituents on a normal-phase silica gel column using a buffer-methanol mobile phase and measured by UV absorption at 270 nm. Addition of 0.25% ascorbic acid to serum protects olanzapine against oxidation during extraction and stabilizes the easily oxidised compound during storage. Inter-day variation was <8% at serum levels found in olanzapine treated patients. Analytical interference from coadministered psychoactive drugs and their metabolites were studied. Only risperidone, also a relatively newly developed antipsychotic drug, interfered, but the most commonly used antidepressants and traditional antipsychotics and their metabolites did not interfere.", 
    "111": "Because selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) require 2-4 weeks to reach efficacy, the authors determined whether clonazepam augmentation of fluoxetine is superior to fluoxetine alone at the beginning of treatment for major depression.", 
    "112": "Eighty adult outpatients with major depression who were rated as \"moderately ill\" or \"markedly ill\" on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity underwent 8 weeks of double-blind, randomized treatment with fluoxetine, 20 mg/day for all patients initially and 40 mg/day if needed after 6 weeks. One-half of these patients received clonazepam, 0.5 mg h.s. adjusted to two tablets by day 10 if needed, and the remainder received placebo, likewise adjusted. Clonazepam/placebo was gradually discontinued during days 21-33. Efficacy was evaluated by means of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, and a patient rating of global improvement.", 
    "113": "The patients taking clonazepam improved significantly more during the first 3 weeks of treatment according to ratings on the Hamilton scale (> or =50% improvement) and the clinician- and patient-rated global improvement measures (\"much\" or \"very much\" improved). Analysis of variance confirmed a significant effect of clonazepam for average Hamilton depression scores. No serious adverse events were found in either treatment group. Taper effects appeared modest and transitory.", 
    "114": "Clonazepam augmentation of fluoxetine was superior to fluoxetine alone in the first 3 weeks of treatment. This strategy may reduce suffering during early SSRI treatment, may partially suppress SSRI side effects, may increase compliance, and could possibly reduce the risk of suicide.", 
    "115": "A 72-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for evaluation of chest pain. Coronary angiography showed a left coronary artery-left ventricle fistula. An acetylcholine provocation test induced vasoconstriction of the right but not the left coronary artery. Her chest pain was not relieved by combined therapy with isosorbide dinitrate, diltiazem and nicorandil. Because of the coronary spasm, beta-blockers could not be used. However, her chest pain was relieved after the administration of a minor tranquilizer. Thus, the patient's chest pain was unlikely to be associated with either the fistula or the coronary spasm.", 
    "116": "We examined the anticonvulsant properties of dipotassium clorazepate (DC) against hippocampal kindled seizures in rats. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to kindling 1 week after the implantation of electrodes. After five stage 5 seizures were induced, the generalized convulsion triggering threshold (GST) was determined. Dipotassium clorazepate was administered intraperitoneally in rats that showed two stable stage 5 seizures induced at the GST current intensity. Dipotassium clorazepate at doses of 1 mg/kg or more produced an anticonvulsant effect, but did not readily suppress limbic seizures. Dipotassium clorazepate did not completely suppress after-discharges (AD) even at the highest dose, which was 5 mg/kg. Moreover, raised stimulus intensity failed to affect its efficacy as an anticonvulsant. The results of the present study suggest that DC has a modest anticonvulsant potency. It is reasonable to assume that its anticonvulsant efficacy is primarily due to attenuation of AD propagation rather than the raising of the seizure triggering threshold at the kindling focus.", 
    "117": "Atypical antipsychotics have become the treatment of choice for patients experiencing a first episode of schizophrenia. In addition, they are often prescribed for conditions such as bipolar disorder and dementia. While clinical trials have not yet established the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotics for these uses, a number of reports offer preliminary evidence that the atypical antipsychotics may be beneficial for affective disorders, substance abuse disorder, senile dementia, and pathologic aggression. Atypical agents may be particularly effective and tolerable in elderly patients who are especially susceptible to the adverse effects of conventional antipsychotic medication. Lower dosages are more necessary for the elderly than for younger adults. Current evidence suggests that clozapine is the most effective atypical antipsychotic for neuroleptic-resistant patients. Risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine may also be effective in a subset of these patients."
