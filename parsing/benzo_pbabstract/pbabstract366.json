    "1": "To investigate the effects of the selective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol (THIP) on sleep, vehicle or 2 or 4 mg kg-1 of THIP were randomly administered i.p. to 8 rats at light onset. EEG and EMG were recorded during the first 6 hours after injection. THIP 4 mg kg-1 transiently evoked bursts of absence epilepsy-like EEG hypersynchronization. It significantly promoted non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and elevated delta activity within non-REM sleep. This was accompanied by an increase in both the rise rate and maximal level of delta activity within the non-REM sleep episodes. The effects of THIP on sleep resemble those reported earlier for the GABAA agonist muscimol and are dissimilar from those induced by benzodiazepine-agonistic modulators of GABAA receptors. These data indicate that agonists and agonistic modulators of GABAA receptors affect sleep differentially.", 
    "2": "We have studied a possible role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in regulating adrenal medullary function. Caerulein (10(-10)-10(-7) M), a CCK receptor agonist, increased formation of inositol phosphates in primary cultured bovine adrenal medullary (BAM) chromaffin cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of caerulein was antagonized by devazepide, a selective CCKA-receptor antagonist, but not by L-365.260, a selective CCKB-receptor antagonist. These results suggest that BAM cells possess functional CCK receptors of the CCKA-subtype. Stimulation of these receptors with caerulein activates a signal transduction pathway via phospholipase C. CCK may regulate catecholamine release in BAM cells.", 
    "3": "In order to investigate the role of the 5-HT1A receptors of the amygdala in modulating anxiety, rats were implanted with bilateral cannulae aimed at the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala complex and infused with either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) or the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (50-200 ng) and tested in two animal models of anxiety. In the elevated plus-maze test, no significant effects were detected in this dose range. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT caused an overall reduction in levels of social investigation, thus indicating anxiogenic actions in the social interaction test. At 50 ng, 8-OH-DPAT had a selective action on anxiety, while at 200 ng there was a concomitant reduction in locomotor activity and, in some animals, signs of the 5-HT1A syndrome. Evidence that the anxiogenic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (50 ng) was due to activation of 5-HT1A receptors came from the finding that (-)-tertatolol, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, reversed this effect at a dose (1.5 micrograms) which was silent when given alone. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, midazolam (1 and 2 micrograms) was bilaterally administered into the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala and evoked clear-cut anxiolytic effects in the social interaction test. These data indicate that the agonist activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala may produce anxiogenic effects, while agonist activation of BDZ receptors in the same areas evokes anxiolytic effects. Our results from the social interaction test are similar to those previously reported from tests of anxiety using punished paradigms, but contrast with those found in the elevated plus-maze. Thus, it is concluded that either the two tests have different sensitivities to midazolam and 8-OH-DPAT or more intriguingly, the tests are evoking fundamentally different states of anxiety, with that evoked by the plus-maze being mediated via brain areas or receptors different from those studied here.", 
    "4": "Unlike older monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which irreversibly and non-selectively bind monoamine oxidase (MAO), moclobemide is a reversible and selective inhibitor of the MAO-A isozyme. Moclobemide only weakly potentiates the pressor response induced by tyramine or other indirectly acting sympathomimetics; therefore, there is no need to avoid dietary tyramine or over-the-counter decongestants with moclobemide as there is with older MAO inhibitors. Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have confirmed the efficacy of moclobemide in the treatment of depressive disorders. Moclobemide has been shown to have similar efficacy to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and nonselective, irreversible MAO inhibitors. Long term follow-up studies of 6 to 12 months' duration have demonstrated that the antidepressant efficacy of moclobemide is maintained. Moclobemide, given alone or in combination with another antidepressant, has shown some efficacy in patients with refractory depression; however, comparative trials are required to confirm these findings. Data are also available to show clinical efficacy of moclobemide in the management of social phobia. Comparative studies have established that moclobemide is better tolerated at therapeutic dosages and has less toxicity in overdose than TCAs and nonselective, irreversible MAO inhibitors. Moclobemide lacks the anticholinergic, sedative and cardiovascular effects associated with many of the older antidepressants. Compared with SSRIs, moclobemide has a similar overall tolerability, although it tends to cause fewer gastrointestinal effects than the SSRIs and has not been reported to interfere with sexual function. In summary, recent data which confirm and extend its comparative therapeutic efficacy and low potential for adverse effects have established moclobemide as an effective treatment in depressive disorders. The drug is also effective in patients with a primary diagnosis of social phobia. Its lack of adverse anticholinergic, cardiovascular, cognitive and psychomotor effects makes moclobemide a particularly useful option in the elderly or patients with cardiac disease.", 
    "5": "The in vitro binding of moclobemide to monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A is weak but >167-fold more selective than for the MAO-B isozyme. However, its ex vivo activity against -A is more pronounced, perhaps indicating the existence of an as yet unidentified, more active metabolite. The ex vivo binding of moclobemide to MAO-A was demonstrated to be reversible, with recovery of enzyme activity within 16 hours. This is in contrast to older MAO inhibitors, which nonselectively and irreversibly bind to both MAO-A and MAO-B isozymes. The effects of moclobemide on monoamine metabolism and/or activity of monoaminergic neurons have been indirectly demonstrated in humans by reductions in plasma levels of the catecholamine metabolites homovanillic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. In vitro, moclobemide has no appreciable affinity for muscarinic, dopaminergic, seroto-nergic, adrenergic, H1-histaminergic, benzodiazepine or opioid receptors. In oral tyramine pressor tests moclobemide enhanced the hypertensive re-sponse to oral tyramine approximately 8- and 16-fold less than tranylcypromine and phenelzine, respectively. In addition, the pressor response induced by tyramine returned to baseline within 3 days of discontinuing moclobemide, whereas baseline sensitivity did not return until 4 and 8 weeks after discontinuing tranyl-cypromine and phenelzine, respectively. In contrast to other antidepressants, moclobemide has minimal effect on REM sleep and is reported to have no effect on, or to improve, sleep continuity in depressed patients. Unlike tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), moclobemide has no reported effect on cognitive or psychomotor function.", 
    "6": "After single-dose oral administration, moclobemide is almost completely absorbed; however, oral bioavailability ranges from 44 to 69% because of substantial first-pass metabolism. After multiple doses, moclobemide is associated with increased bioavailability (>80%), possibly due to saturation of first-pass metabolism. Moclobemide is approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins and the volume of distribution ranges from 76 to 134L. Moclobemide is rapidly and extensively metabolised to at least 19 different metabolites, two of which have moderate MAO-A inhibitory activity. The elimination half-life of moclobemide is approximately 1 to 2 hours and the drug is primarily excreted renally as metabolites. Age and renal function are reported to have no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of moclobemide; however, elimination is impaired in patients with hepatic dysfunction.", 
    "7": "Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses in patients with depressive disorders have confirmed that moclobemide generally has similar efficacy to TCAs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the MAO inhibitor tranylcypromine and maprotiline. Although results from a meta-analysis indicate that moclobemide is as effective as clomipramine, this was not the case in patients with severe depression when dosages of moclobemide of 400 mg/day or less were used. Data from meta-analyses also indicate that moclobemide has similar efficacy to TCAs when patients are classified according to severity of disease or when symptom clusters (psychic, somatic, retardation, agitation) of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) are examined separately. In studies comparing moclobemide 300 to 600 mg/day with fluoxetine 20 to 40 mg/day, the percentage of patients who responded to treatment (\u226550% reduction in HDRS scores or either a \u226550% reduction in HDRS score or a final HDRS score <10) was similar (range 47 to 72% and 48 to 77%, respectively). One study reported that moclobemide and fluoxetine were associated with similar improvements in quality-of-life parameters after treatment for up to 12 weeks. Long term follow-up studies have reported that moclobemide retains its antidepressant efficacy over treatment periods of up to 12 months. In elderly patients, moclobemide was generally at least as effective as comparator antidepressants and more effective than placebo. The use of moclobemide in patients with depression that is refractory to standard therapy is primarily limited to noncomparative studies. Preliminary data indicate that combination of moclobemide with a TCA or SSRI may be effective in these patients (although the coadministration of moclobemide with antidepressants with serotonergic properties should be undertaken only with great caution). Moclobemide has been shown to be effective in the management of social phobia. Comparative 16-week data indicate moclobemide (approximately 580 mg/day) to be as effective as phenelzine (approximately 70 mg/day) in this disorder. In a subsequent study, moclobemide 600 mg/day was associated with significant global improvement relative to placebo on the Liebowitz Social Phobia Scale and on all subscales of the Clinical Impression of Change for social phobia after 12 weeks. Long-term data are also available from a nonblind trial to show clinical efficacy of moclobemide 600 to 750 mg/day over a 2-year period.", 
    "8": "Based on pooled data from clinical trials involving over 1600 patients, the frequency of the most common adverse effects did not significantly differ between moclobemide and placebo. Only dizziness, nausea and insomnia/sleep disturbance were reported more frequently in moclobemide-treated patients than placebo recipients. Moclobemide generally lacks the adverse effects associated with antidepressant drugs which bind to muscarinic (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, urinary retention), \u03b11-adrenergic (hypotension) and histaminergic (sedation) receptors. In comparative trials with TCAs, moclobemide was associated with a lower frequency of adverse effects, primarily related to a lower propensity to produce anticholinergic and sedative effects. Moclobemide had a similar overall tolerability to SSRIs. However, SSRIs tended to cause more gastrointestinal adverse effects than moclobemide. Moclobemide has a relatively low frequency of adverse effects during long term treatment and is reported to be as well tolerated in the elderly as in younger patients. In cases of overdose when moclobemide was the sole ingestant, most symptoms have been relatively mild and reversible. However, several fatal cases of serotonin syndrome have been reported after multidrug overdose involving moclobemide in combination with clomipramine, citalopram or fluoxetine.", 
    "9": "Although moclobemide has been combined with serotonin reuptake inhibitors in clinical trials without evidence of the serotonin syndrome, there have been isolated case reports of this occurring when moclobemide was combined with clomipramine or fluoxetine at therapeutic dosages. Thus, these drugs should be used together only with great caution. Similarly, pethidine (meperidine) or dextro-methorphan (both of which have serotonergic properties) should be avoided in patients receiving moclobemide. Moclobemide has no reported interaction with directly acting sympathomimetic agents. Data indicate that the drug may be used with caution in combination with low dosages of indirectly acting sympathomimetics. The elimination of moclobemide is significantly reduced when it is coadministered with cimetidine.", 
    "10": "Moclobemide may be initiated at full therapeutic dosages of 300 to 450 mg/day. The maximum recommended dosage is 600 mg/day. Dietary restrictions are not required but consumption of large amounts of tyramine-rich food should be avoided. Washout periods when switching between moclobemide and other antidepressants are not required. Dosage adjustments are not needed in patients with renal dysfunction; however, moclobemide dosages should be reduced by one-third to one-half in patients with hepatic dysfunction.", 
    "11": "In this first part of a review on recent insights into the structure and function of the \u03b3-aminobuty rie acid type A - benzodiazepine receptor system, the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor and the different types of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors known at this moment are dicussed. GABAA- and BDZ receptors are coupled in a supramolecular GABAA-BDZ-ionophore receptor complex, each consisting of five acidic glycoprotein molecules called subunits. These subunits can be classified into five groups: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03c3 and \u03c1. Present evidence indicates the existence of multiple subtypes of these subunits. Multiple GABAA-BDZ receptors exist in the brain that show differential distribution and developmental patterns. These receptors differ from their subunit composition. The final functional properties of the receptor are determined by the different subunits constituting this receptor. Heterogeneity among \u03b1- subunits may determine the diversity of BDZ pharmacology in different regions of the nervous system.", 
    "12": "We examined the effects of midazolam and flumazenil on cardiac function and metabolism in the isolated rat heart-lung preparation. Wistar rats were divided into five groups (each group:n=8) as follows: (1) control (saline); (2) flumazenil (1.3\u00d710(-5)M); (3) flumazenil (10(-4)M); (4) midazolam (60\u03bcg\u00b7ml(-1)); and (5) midazolam (60\u03bcg\u00b7ml(-1)) and flumazenil (1.3\u00d710(-5)M). Systolic blood pressure and calculated left ventricular dP/dt maximum in the midazolam or midazolam conbined with flumazenil groups increased significantly in comparison with those in the control group. Heart rate in the midazolam group was lower than that in the control group. However, in the flumazenil group, there were no effects on the hemodynamics. There were no significant differences in the myocardial tissue concentration of ATP, lactate, and glycogen in all groups. In this study, midazolam decreased heart rate; however, flumazenil had no effect on the heart, nor did it antagonize the cardiac effects of midazolam. These results suggest that flumazenil has no effect on the peripheraltype benzodiazepine receptor of the myocardium.", 
    "13": "The retention mechanism of a weak polar solute, a series of 10 benzodiazepines in reversed phase liquid chromatography, was investigated over a wide range of mobile phase compositions. The values of enthalpy (\u0394H\u00b0) and entropy (\u0394S\u00b0) of transfer from the mobile to the stationary phases were determined. The method studied each factor (water fraction \u03a6 in the acetonitrile (ACN)/water mixture and column temperature) controlling the retention mechanism. The changes in \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 as a function of the water fraction \u03a6 in the ACN/water mixture were examined. These variations are explained using the organization of organic modifier (ACN) in clusters in the ACN/water mixture. A change in the retention mechanism thus indicated when the ACN/water mixture was used instead of the hydrogen-bonded mobile phase such as CH(3)OH/water. Enthalpy-entropy compensation revealed that the retention mechanism was independent of the water fraction \u03a6 but showed that differences between the molecular structures of the benzodiazepines contributed more significantly to changes in the retention process in the CH(3)OH/water mixture than in the ACN/water mixture.", 
    "14": "To obtain more information about anecdotal reports of injection of methadone syrup and benzodiazepine drugs among injecting drug users, interviews were conducted with 32 subjects as part of a larger study into drug use patterns of clients in methadone maintenance treatment. Subjects were asked about frequency of injection of methadone and benzodiazepines, reasons for injection and methods of preparation for injection. The study found that 78% had injected methadone and 25% had injected benzodiazepines at some time during their drug using careers. Service providers can play an important role in promoting harm minimization strategies, and utilizing behaviour modification techniques.", 
    "15": "A sample of 210 heroin users who had used benzodiazepines during the preceding 6 months were interviewed about their benzodiazepine use. Forty-one percent of the sample reported having used benzodiazepines more than once a week during the 6 months preceding interview. Forty-eight percent had injected benzodiazepines, with 17% having done so during the preceding 6 months. Eleven percent of the sample reported having experienced convulsions when attempting detoxification from benzodiazepines. The majority of subjects (86%) indicated that benzodiazepines are easy or very easy to obtain. Only a third of the sample reported obtaining benzodiazepines exclusively through a doctor in the last 6 months. Over a half of the sample indicated that they had given or sold benzodiazepines to someone during that time. Diazepam was considered by subjects to be the easiest benzodiazepine to procure. Doctors should avoid the prescription of benzodiazepines to injecting drug users, particularly the more readily injectable drug temazepam. Given the widespread use of benzodiazepines by injection, research needs to examine the harm associated with the parenteral use of these drugs.", 
    "16": "A prospective study evaluated and compared midazolam versus diazepam in the upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Patients were excluded if they had experienced any of the following: intolerance to benzodiazepines, pregnancy, alcohol or drug addiction, and weakness chronic disease. Seventy one patients were assigned to two groups: 36 received diazepam (0,15 Mg/Kg. intravenous) and 35 midazolam (0,07 mg/kg.). Patients in the two study group were similar in regard to demographic data (sex, age, and weight). Midazolam resulted in a marked improvement of conscious sedation and the anxiolysis as compared with the group receiving diazepam (p<0.001). Amnesia were significantly more frequent in the midazolam group (total 77,14% and partial 17,14%) compared with diazepam group (total 11,11% and partial 2,77%). The present study show that midazolam improves patient tolerance lo endoscopy compared with diazepam (p<0.001).The selection of patients is very important, no clinically adverse events related to cardiopulmonary changes ocurred in any group.",

    "18": "Having observed psychosis in the course of a severe panic attack, the authors prospectively identified four patients who experienced panic attacks with co-occurring psychosis. All met the DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder. Distinctive features of their clinical presentation, pharmacotherapy, and follow-up were recorded.", 
    "19": "Three patients had a history of panic disorder, and one had a history of generalized anxiety disorder. In all cases, psychosis (auditory hallucinations or delusions) originated in the course of a severe panic attack. Psychotic symptoms occurred only during panic attacks; however, these could occur up to 10 to 15 times a day. In all four patients, psychotic symptoms resolved after a brief time either spontaneously or with benzodiazepine/SSRI treatment. None of the patients required neuroleptic treatment.", 
    "20": "The cases suggest that psychosis may develop in the course of a severe panic attack in patients with panic disorder, as was reported previously for patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Distinguishing panic attacks with psychotic features from other psychotic disorders is clinically important since antipsychotic medication treatment for these psychotic symptoms is not indicated. Further research on the prevalence of psychotic symptoms in the anxiety disorders and the pathophysiology of this phenomenon is required to clarify the relationship between the anxiety disorders and psychosis.", 
    "21": "Most types of psychotropic drugs have been tried in the treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but have yielded limited results. Theory and retrospective research predict that early treatment may be more efficacious. Specifically, high-potency benzodiazepines have been recommended for the treatment of acute responses to trauma and for prevention of PTSD. This study prospectively evaluates the effect of early administration of benzodiazepines on the course of PTSD and PTSD symptoms.", 
    "22": "Thirteen trauma survivors (the benzodiazepine group) were treated within 6.7 +/- 5.8 days after the trauma (range, 2-18) with either clonazepam (N = 10, 2.7 +/- 0.8 mg/day) or alprazolam (N = 3, 2.5 mg/day). Thirteen other trauma survivors, pair-matched with subjects in the active treatment group for gender and symptom severity in the first week after the trauma, constitute the control group. Both groups were reevaluated 1 and 6 months after the trauma for PTSD symptoms (Horowitz Impact of Event Scale; Mississippi Rating Scale for Combat-Related PTSD-civilian trauma version), PTSD status (Clinician Administered PTSD Scale), state anxiety, depression, and resting heart rate.", 
    "23": "Subjects in the benzodiazepine group did not differ from controls in 1-month and 6-month PTSD and anxiety scores. Repeated measures ANOVA showed no group or group-by-time effect on psychometric measures.

Somatostatin immunoneutralization increased both the total amylase and volume of pancreatic secretion. Cholecystokinin-A receptor antagonism abolished the stimulatory effect of somatostatin immunoneutralization. We conclude that somatostatin tonically inhibits, pancreatic secretion in fasted rats via inhibition of the release or action of cholecystokinin.

The duration of the trial was 4 months with a 2 week run in period and 2 week washout period separating two treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The patients were followed up for 4 weeks at the completion of the trial. 48 patients completed the trial. There was no significant difference in the overall response rate based in terms of percentage reduction in headache frequency per week, however a significant decrease in headache index was observed during treatment with alprazolam as compared to placebo (P < 0.05). The mean analgesic intake per week was also significantly lower during treatment with alprazolam as compared to the run in period. Side effects were seen in 16.67% patients. In none of the patients was it significant enough to require withdrawal from the study.", 
    "28": "Comparative investigations in reception of NAD, benzodiazepines and GABA by synaptic membranes under a single and multiple administration of phenazepam and nicotinamide to animals as well as after withdrawal of long-term administration of these drugs have been carried out. The both drugs activate GABA-inhibiting system of synaptic membranes. Both the sections of specific binding of benzodiazepines and of NAD take part in realization of \"cancellation\" syndrome. Chronic administration of phenazepam and nicotinamide results in the change of coupling in GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. After the withdrawal of chronic administration of nicotinamide the function of GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex is normalized more quickly.", 
    "29": "GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in mammalian brain. They belong to a family of ligand-gated ion channels that also includes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, glycine receptors and 5HT(3) receptors. Each receptor in the family is believed to be a pentamer of homologous subunits that assemble to form a central transmembrane ion pore which, in the case of the GABA(A) receptor, is anion-selective. For almost twenty years, there has been tremendous interest in the structure and function of GABA(A) receptors, not only because of their importance in regulating brain excitability but also because these proteins are the specific targets for a wide variety of therapeutic agents including the anxiolytic benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Molecular cloning has revealed that GABA(A) receptors are heterogeneous, being formed by combinations of different isoforms of several subunit classes (alpha, beta, gamma, delta). The physiological and pharmacological properties of individual GABAA receptor subtypes appear to depend on their precise subunit complement. In this review, we focus on the application of modern techniques in molecular biology, particularly mutational analysis, to identify structural domains of these receptors that are important for ligand recognition and receptor function.", 
    "30": "The aim of O.P.P.I.D.U.M. is the survey of products used by drug addicts. A five year survey, based on regular pools, has provided interesting results. 1,283 patients (80 per cent men, about 27 years old, 1/4 employed) used 2,241 drugs. The most frequent was heroin, followed by benzodiazepines, cannabis and cocaine. Flunitrazepam was the most commonly misused product, taken by users who started consumption earlier, with a higher rate of unemployment and imprisonment. Cocaine was as often taken intravenously as by sniffing, and most often used before imprisonment. Ecstasy (M.D.M.A.) has appeared recently. Codeine taken alone was used by subjects older than the heroin users, more frequently employed and virtually never prison inmates: this suggests the existence of an unofficial detoxication and substitution process. Confidence of clinicians needs anonymity of the records and return of information. Such a campaign is about to be launched.", 
    "31": "Air Force radar controllers represent an excellent example of night shift workers, as they are obliged to demonstrate perfect alertness during working hours. We set out: a) to assess the quality of life in these shift workers; b) to identify those with shift work syndrome and c) to evaluate the possible effects of triazolam both on their quality of life and sleep. The results reveal an impairment of the quality of life in shift workers, independently of the presence of a circadian rhythm sleep disorder. Quality of life was more severely impaired in subjects with circadian rhythm sleep disorder. Hypnotic therapy brought about an improvement both in the sleep disorder and in the quality of life of subjects affected by shift work syndrome. Selective alertness tests failed to demonstrate any \"sedative carry-over\" in the treated patients.", 
    "32": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor system plays an important role in nociceptive signal modulation in the central nerve system. There is considerable evidence that NMDA receptor antagonists can abolish hypersensitivity of nociceptors in animal models. In this case report, we described a patient who suffered post-herpetic neuralgia with severe pain, allodynia, and hyperesthesia over right side T2 to T8 dermatomes. Treatment with conventional doses of non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), antidepressant, anticonvulsant and benzodiazepine failed to provide satisfactory pain relief. With the patient's consent, we administered subanalgesic doses of ketamine (10 mg), morphine (1 mg), and 6 ml bupivacaine (0.1%) through the thoracic epidural route. After the treatment, hyperalgesia and allodynia improved dramatically, and the receptive field also reduced. After four weeks' treatment, satisfactory pain relief was achieved with conventional analgesics treatment. The combination of relatively low doses of morphine, ketamine and bupivacaine epidurally provides effective pain relief in this case. The result strongly suggests a synergy from this combination that warrants a formal study of the dose-response relationship involved in this treatment and the mechanism by which this effect is achieved. This regimen provides a promising treatment for the neuropathic pain with limited side effects.",

    "34": "The puerperal period is a critical one in the life of a woman, due to the numerous changes which occur at biological and psychological levels and also at the level of relationships. Various disturbances of a psychiatric nature may emerge during this period which represents a \"risky\" phase from a psycho-pathological point of view. Among some of these disturbances, so-called \"puerperal psychoses\", there is an uncertain nosographic connection. According to some authors, these psychoses could be distinct nosographic events, while others prefer to include them in psychotic disturbances which have already been classified. From this point of view the puerperal period would be a stressful event. Risk factors would be a first birth, previous psychotic puerperal episodes, inherited serious psychiatric disturbances and caesarean section. The therapy used in the case of such disturbances must take into account many aspects and implications which don't exclusively concern the new mother but which also look significantly at the newborn baby, and the patient's family circumstances. All this implies the necessity for a close collaboration between specialists in different medical areas (psychiatry and obstetrics). Particular attention should be given to the type of disturbed relationship which can occur between the mother and the new born child. The analysis of our case has stimulated many reflections from a clinical, therapeutic and prognostic point of view, and as a result we tent to agree with published material on the subject.",

We measured the following parameters: sedation (modified Glasgow coma scale); anxiety (visual analogue scale); numerical and verbal memory (digit span and reproduction of previously presented words); concentration (Revisions test of Stender/Marschner). To identify depression of ventilation, pulse oximetry and nasal end-tidal PCO2 were monitored intraoperatively.", 
    "37": "After premedication with 3.75 mg midazolam, patients were significantly more sedated (P < 0.01) and systolic blood pressures were significantly reduced (P < 0.05); 30 min after midazolam premedication only concentration was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased. The results of the other cognitive functions did not differ. No differences in cognitive and physiological functions between and groups could be found 2 h after the operation (293 +/- min after premedication). Intraoperatively, there were no significant differences in end-tidal PCO2 and oxygenation between the groups. In both groups anxiety and blood pressure were significantly higher pre- than postoperatively.", 
    "38": "Oral administration of low-dose midazolam (0.049 +/- mg/kg) seems to be appropriate for premedication before ambulatory surgical procedures in elderly patients. In the interest of patient safety, standardised oral premedication with 3.75 mg midazolam may not be sufficient for some of the patients.", 
    "39": "The aim of this study was to describe the clinical characteristics and the polysomnographic findings of a sample of patients affected by sleep-related painful erections (SRPE). In a 6-y period 18 patients were diagnosed as having SRPE. The mean age at the onset of the disease was 39.8 +/- 11.6 y and the mean duration of SRPE was 5.4 +/- 3.5 y. According to ICSD criteria, about 60% of patients had a severe form of the disease. None of the patients met any DSM IV Axis-I and Axis-II diagnoses. Twelve patients complained of excessive daytime sleepiness. SRPE patients, compared to age-matched controls, showed a reduced sleep efficiency, an increased wake after sleep onset and a reduced percentage of REM sleep. This study confirms that in SRPE there are no clear predisposing factors, no familial pattern, but REM sleep fragmentation. Concerning the pharmacological treatment, in the history of patients, propranolol and paroxetine, but not amitriptiline and lorazepam, showed a temporary efficacy in some patients.", 
    "40": "Exposure of neutrophils to anaesthetic agents may alter their functional characteristics and in patients undergoing long-term sedation this may be clinically relevant. We have investigated the in vitro influence of propofol, thiopentone, methohexitone and midazolam on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced respiratory burst of neutrophils by the intracellular oxidative transformation of dihydrorhodamine-123 to the fluorescent dye rhodamine-123 via flow cytometry. We tested in vitro concentrations similar to sedating, anaesthetic, 10-fold sedating and 10-fold anaesthetic plasma concentrations. All drugs showed similar inhibition of respiratory burst at sedating concentrations (1-6%). At anaesthetic concentrations, propofol produced significantly higher mean inhibition (7.3%) compared with thiopentone (4.5%) and methohexitone (0.9%). At 10-fold anaesthetic concentrations inhibition of respiratory burst by propofol was almost complete (90.8%) and significantly higher than that by thiopentone (29.2%) and methohexitone (1.8%). Methohexitone and midazolam had only minimal effects at all concentrations. The effect of the solvent of propofol (10% Intralipid) was similar to that of propofol. Thus suppression of respiratory burst of neutrophils by propofol may be caused by this lipid carrier.", 
    "41": "Benzodiazepines, which may themselves have analgesic properties, display complex interactions with opioids. This study was designed to investigate the effects of midazolam on nociceptive neurotransmission in isolated neonatal rat spinal cord, and the interactions between midazolam and alfentanil. Slow ventral root potentials (sVRP) were recorded from a lumbar root of spinal cords isolated from 1-7-day-old rats and superfused at 27-28 degrees C. Midazolam (35 nmol litre-1 to 15 mumol litre-1) significantly (P < 0.05) depressed sVRP area in a concentration-dependent manner. Midazolam depression was antagonized by flumazenil, bicuculline and naloxone. Midazolam and alfentanil interacted synergistically, as determined by a combination index of less than 1. Midazolam blocked the rebound hyperexcitability observed when alfentanil was reversed by naloxone. The results of the study are relevant to benzodiazepine-opioid analgesia and to the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in mitigating the development of opioid tolerance and dependence.", 
    "42": "Patients undergoing cataract surgery using peribulbar block were allocated randomly to self-administer doses of either midazolam 0.1 mg or propofol 3.3 mg without a lock-out facility; in the control group the syringe was charged with saline, not as a placebo, but to \"blind\" the surgeon and the nurse observer. For midazolam and propofol, median doses were 2.54 (0.1-6.0) mg and 87.4 (0-145) mg, respectively. Patient-controlled sedation significantly reduced the level of anxiety, with median visual analogue anxiety scores in the midazolam, propofol and saline groups of 5 (0-38) mm, 5 (0-25) mm and 15 (0-92) mm, respectively (P < 0.05). Some patients did not administer the sedative when available while others in the saline group would have benefited from anxiolytic drugs. While both drugs prevented an increase in heart rate, only midazolam prevented an increase in arterial pressure during surgery.", 
    "43": "Muscarinic receptors are believed to play an important role in modulation of ciliary action in respiratory system. We studied the in vitro effect of methacholine, a beta-methyl ester of acetylcholine, on the ciliary beat frequency (CBF). Adenoid explants were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium Eagle (MEM). CBF was determined using microphotometry. Methacholine (10(-6) M) increased CBF a maximum of 10.34 +/- 0.42% (p < 0.001). The non-selective muscarinic antagonist atropine (10(-6) M) significantly inhibited the ciliostimulatory effects of methacholine (p < 0.001). To characterize the muscarinic receptor subtypes in nasal mucosa, the selective M1-, M2- and M3-muscarinic antagonists pirenzepine dihydrochloride (PZ), gallamine triethiodide (gallamine), and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) were used prior to addition of methacholine, PZ and 4-DAMP, at concentrations of 10(-6) to 10(-8) M, significantly inhibited the ciliostimulatory effects of methacholine (p < 0.0001). There was no significant inhibition of methacholine-induced ciliostimulation by gallamine (p > 0.3). Our study showed that ciliostimulation by methacholine in human upper airway mucosa involves M1- and M3- muscarinic receptor subtypes, but not the M2-receptor subtype. The identification of the muscarinic receptor subtypes and intracellular signalling mechanisms involved in CBF modulation will permit the selection appropriate of pharmacological agents for treating the cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis.", 
    "44": "Parametric images of intrasubject distribution of the central-type benzodiazepine receptor binding and ligand transport were determined from two SPECT images after an intravenous bolus injection of 123I-iomazenil in six healthy volunteers and five patients by using a table look-up procedure based on a 3-compartment, 2-parameter kinetic model. Individual arterial input functions were estimated by calibrating a standardized input function with the injected dose to avoid blood sampling. The parametric images without blood data provided the same information as those determined by using measured arterial input function. A simulation study suggested that this method gave relatively small error as long as true receptor binding and ligand transport did not differ from each other in a large extent. The present method may be practical in clinical settings.", 
    "45": "1. Using the cannula insertion method, muscarinic receptor subtypes were analysed in isolated, perfused canine lingual arteries preconstricted with phenylephrine. 2. Both acetylcholine and McN-A-343 induced a profound vasodilation in a dose-related manner. Acetylcholine-induced dilations were approximately 1000-times more potent than McN-A-343-induced dilation. 3. Acetylcholine-induced dilations were abolished after removal of the endothelium by intraluminal treatment with 1 mg saponin. 4. Acetylcholine-induced dilations were markedly inhibited by an M1/M3 receptor antagonist, 4-DAMP. Moreover, they were slightly, but significantly, inhibited by an M1 antagonist, pirenzepine, but never influenced by an M2 antagonist, AF-DX 116. Mc-N-A-343-induced vasodilations were inhibited by both 4-DAMP or pirenzepine. 5. These results suggest that there are abundant functional M3 and a few M1 receptors in the canine lingual artery that mediate vasodilation and that this vasodilation is dependent on the presence of an intact endothelium.", 
    "46": "This report describes work directed towards the development of a screening technique for cytochrome P450 3A activity which should be valid for a variety of drugs metabolized by this enzyme. A significant correlation (P < 0.01) was found between the ratio of the plasma concentration of nifedipine to that of its oxidized metabolite and the area under the time curve for the plasma concentration of midazolam. It is suggested that the nifedipine: metabolite ratio might have general predictive value for the metabolism of orally administered cytochrome P450 3A substrates.", 
    "47": "Thirty-four healthy, young-adult patients receiving intravenous midazolam for third-molar surgery had their respiratory parameters measured by respiratory inductive plethysmography. Tidal volume and minute volume showed significant changes during the initial 5-10 minutes of sedation, the changes being maximal during the first 5 minutes from the completion of injection of midazolam. The measurement of phase angle, an indicator of respiratory asynchrony, showed no significant change from normal, although a few patients showed some asynchrony of breathing, suggesting some amount of respiratory obstruction. A few patients showed a short period of apnoea and a small fall in the oxygen saturation. None of these changes caused any clinical concerns. It is suggested that the absence of stimulation after injection of midazolam, particularly in the initial few minutes, may contribute to the potential onset of respiratory problems.", 
    "48": "1. The behavioural and anticonvulsant effects of 10 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives were studied after intraperitoneal administration in DBA/2 mice, a strain genetically susceptible to sound-induced seizures. 2. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked by means of auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12-16 kHz) in animals placed singly under a perspex dome. The rank order of potency for anticonvulsant activity was alprazolam > clonazepam > flunitrazepam > diazepam > pinazepam > desmethyldiazepam > oxazepam > prazepam > halazepam > camazepam. 3. The impairment of locomotor performance following IP administration of the above reported derivatives was also evaluated by means of the rotarod test. 4. Hypothermic activity was observed after the highest doses of the benzodiazepines studied. 5. The potency of various 1,4-benzodiazepines as inhibitors of specific [3H] flumazenil binding to membranes from cerebellum or cortex was evaluated. In general, 1,4-benzodiazepines were active as anticonvulsants at micromolar range and inhibited [3H] flumazenil binding at nanomolar range. 6. The different degree of anticonvulsant activity and impairment of coordinated motor movements cannot be directly related to the benzodiazepine binding affinity or to the lipophilicity of the compounds studied.", 
    "49": "We compared analgesic effects of a lidocaine tape (Penles) and the eutectic mixture of lidocaine and tetracaine (LT ointment) during local infiltration before epidural block. Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to 3 groups. In groups 1 and 2, lidocaine tape was applied on the skin of the epidural puncture site 30-60 min before epidural block. In group 3, 1 g of LT ointment was applied on the same place 1-2 h before block. Additionally, patients in groups 2 and 3 were medicated intramuscularly with midazolam 5 mg. Although no significant difference in pain relief in 5 pin prick tests was observed among the three groups, there was a significantly greater decrease in the pain score during the infiltration of local anesthetics in groups 1 and 2, compared with group 3. There was no significant difference in the pain score between groups 1 and 2. We concluded that lidocaine tape is more useful than LT ointment in decreasing pain of local infiltration anesthesia, and midazolam did not exert any supplementary analgesic effect.",

A cross-sectional design was employed to study sleep problems, CVD, general health, psychosocial factors, and medication use. The subjects were participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, which included 5,201 adults, aged 65 and older, who were recruited from a random sample of Medicare enrollees in four U.S. communities. Study measures employed were sleep questions, echocardiography, carotid ultrasound, resting electrocardiogram, cognitive function, cardiopulmonary symptoms and diseases, depression, independent activities of daily living (IADLs), and benzodiazepine use. Thirty-three percent of the men and 19% of the women reported loud snoring, which was less frequent in those over age 75. Snoring was positively associated with younger age, marital status, and alcohol use in men, and obesity, diabetes, and arthritis in women. Snoring was not associated, however, with cardiovascular risk factors or clinical CVD in men or women. Observed apneas were reported much less frequently (13% of men and 4% women) than snoring, and they were associated with alcohol use, chronic bronchitis, and marital status in men. Observed apneas were associated with depression and diabetes in women. In both men and women, daytime sleepiness was associated with poor health, advanced age, and IADL limitations. The conclusions of the study were that loud snoring, observed apneas, and daytime sleepiness are not associated cross-sectionally with hypertension or prevalent CVD in elderly persons.",

Patients and interventionalists were blinded to the applied sedative. Both groups were similar with regard to American Society of Anesthesiology status, heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen pressure (pO2), arterial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2), and visual analogue scores for general condition, anxiety, and pain. During PTA, heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse oximetry (tpO2) were monitored continually. Every 30 minutes, an arterial blood gas analysis was performed.

    "62": "Rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (RCBD) is currently defined as the presence of at least four affective episodes per year. RCBD is often difficult to treat with standard therapies bipolar disorder (BD), thus dictating special treatment strategies. This is especially true for the treatment of RCBD with lithium, which has been described as insufficient to prevent the high-frequency episodes in up to 82% of cases. There are several other possibilities for the biological treatment of RCBD, including the mood-stabilizers carbamazepine (CBZ) and valproate, neuroleptics, antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, l-thyroxine, benzodiazepines. ECT, total sleep deprivation and several other less proven agents. The utility of these agents and treatment procedures in the acute and prophylactic treatment of RCBD is reviewed. Special emphasis is placed on the controversial discussion of the possible induction and worsening of RCBD by antidepressant treatment. Finally, a number of guidelines for the pharmacological management of RCBD are proposed.", 
    "63": "Cerebral evoked potentials (EPs) in response to painful stimuli have been recorded since the 1970s. Based on the apparent relationship of the response amplitude to intensity of stimulation, these potentials are conventionally interpreted as reflecting the sensory-discriminative aspects of pain. As such, pain-EPs provide an objective measure for sensation of pain. An alternative interpretation regards the pain-EP as comprised of at least two overlapping components, one pain-specific, the other, a P300 wave. In the case of pain, the P300 may reflect the degree of discomfort or unpleasantness, thus reflecting the emotional-motivational aspect. To establish the nature of the pain-EP, mini doses of a benzodiazepine, counterbalanced with placebo, were given to 6 normal volunteers. Benzodiazepines decrease anxiety, and so diminish the emotional response to pain, but they have no analgesic effect. In all subjects, pain perception was unchanged, while the EP wave was almost completely obliterated. We conclude that the pain-EP reflects the emotional-motivational response to pain rather than the sensory-discriminative. Thus, it provides a useful neurophysiological tool for studying the emotions associated with pain.", 
    "64": "Experiments were undertaken to compare the selectively bred, alcohol-preferring (P) and alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rat lines for differences in the locomotor activity (LMA) response to intracerebroventricular infusions of muscarinic- and nicotinic-cholinergic agents. Scopolamine, a nonselective muscarinic antagonist (40 to 120 micrograms/0.5 microliters), dose-dependently increased LMA in both P and NP rats (up to 90 to 100% above baseline; p < 0.05). On the other hand, pirenzepine, a selective M1 muscarinic antagonist (10 to 80 micrograms/0.5 microliters), decreased LMA in P and NP rats (as much as 35 to 40% below control values; p < 0.05). Mecamylamine, a nicotinic antagonist (20 to 80 micrograms/0.5 microliters), also decreased LMA in P and NP rats (as much as 30 to 40% below baseline; p < 0.05). The agonist nicotine (20 to 80 micrograms/0.5 microliters) dose-dependently decreased LMA in both P and NP rats (to a maximum of approximately 60 to 65% below control values; p < 0.05). Based on standardized z-scores, NP rats were more sensitive (p < 0.05) to the locomotor depressant effects of nicotine than P rats, whereas no differences were observed for standardized z-scores between the P and NP lines on the effects of scopolamine, pirenzepine, or mecamylamine on LMA. The results suggest that subtypes of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are involved in regulating LMA in a complex manner, with the M1 subtype possibly mediating behavioral activation, and that P and NP rats may possess innate differences in CNS nicotinic receptors regulating LMA.", 
    "65": "The effect of a decrease in the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) induced by sodium nitroprusside (SNP) on the tumor temperature during hyperthermia (HT), and on the cytotoxic effect of HT, was studied in the BT4An tumor transplanted to the hind limb of BD IX rats.

    "66": "In the tumor response experiments local waterbath HT at 44.0 degrees C was given for 60 min. Sodium nitroprusside was administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to lower the MAP to 60 or 80 mmHg during HT. In two other experiments the temperature at the base of the tumor during HT was measured before and during SNP infusion. In animals without tumor the temperature was measured subcutaneously on the foot during HT with or without SNP-induced hypotension.", 
    "67": "When SNP was given to lower the MAP to 60 mmHg during HT in MFF anesthetized animals, the median tumor growth time (TGT) was 70 days, compared to 14.5 days in the HT alone group. The corresponding figures were 127 and 12.1 days with pentobarbital anesthesia. In the HT + SNP group, more than 40% cure was observed in both experiments. No cures were seen in any of the other groups. Hyperthermia alone prolonged the TGT slightly, whereas SNP given alone had no effect, compared to controls. When the MAP was lowered to 80 mmHg by SNP infusion during HT (MFF anesthesia), the median TGT was 19.9 days, which was significantly longer than that in the HT alone group (10.9 days). In the MAP range from 60 to 120 mmHg, a nearly linear relationship between the MAP and the tumor temperature was found during HT in MFF anesthetized animals. With both anesthetics, the median temperature at the base of the tumor was about 0.8 degrees C higher during HT when the MAP was lowered to 60 mmHg by SNP. In animals without tumors, the temperature subcutaneously on the foot was 0.3 and 0.4 degrees C higher during SNP infusion in the MFF and pentobarbital group, respectively.", 
    "68": "We have developed a small animal model in inbred rats feasible for exploring the influence of a stable blood pressure reduction induced by SNP, on the effect of HT given alone or in combination with other treatment modalities to a transplantable tumor. The greatly increased cytotoxic effect of local waterbath HT in the present tumor response experiments is probably a consequence of increased tumor temperature during SNP infusion.", 
    "69": "The beta-carbolines have a high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor, where they demonstrate actions opposite to those of the benzodiazepines and elicit anxiogenic effects. We tested the acute cardiovascular effects of beta-carbolines in conscious unrestrained rats. Intravenous infusion of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCCE) or methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCCM) caused dose-related decreases in heart rate. Pretreatment with RO 15-1788 (10.0 mg/kg, i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, or atropine (1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) prevented the bradycardia elicited by BCCE (3.0 mg/kg, i.v.). In contrast, tetrahydro-beta-carboline (THBC; 3.0 mg/kg, i.v.) increased both heart rate and blood pressure significantly as compared with controls. However, larger doses of THBC failed to elicit further increases in heart rate or blood pressure. These experiments indicate that in conscious unrestrained rats, beta-carbolines given acutely do not routinely elicit the cardiovascular changes normally associated with stress or anxiety. We next extended our observations to rats given the beta-carboline noreleagnine, 2 mg/kg, or vehicle twice daily intraperitoneally for 4 weeks. The rats were fed either a high salt (8%) or a low salt (0.9%) diet. At 4 weeks, rats given noreleagnine and high salt had higher tail cuff pressures (146 +/- 4 vs. 134 +/- 4 mmHg) than those given noreleagnine and low salt. However, with direct arterial measurement, these differences disappeared. These data suggest that beta-carbolines do not provide a useful model for investigating the effects of chronic stress on cardiovascular function in rats.",

All women born in 1935 (a total of 1223 subjects) were invited to a health screening at the Preventive Medicine Section, Malm\u00f6 General Hospital; 69% agreed to participate. The screening included an extensive health questionnaire, and the responses to 33 items assessing social background, including immigrant status, use of BZD and analgesics, alcohol consumption (the revised Malm\u00f6-MAST), smoking and morbidity were analysed. A psychiatric symptoms scale including five of these items was constructed, yielding a Cronbach's alpha of 0.57. Present use of BZD hypnotics and/or tranquillizers was acknowledged by 6% of the women. BZD use at any time in the past or present was endorsed by 23%. Endorsement of > or = 3 revised Malm\u00f6-MAST items, indicating problem drinking, occurred in 3% of the participants; 16% were teetotallers and about 25% were regular weekend drinkers. BZD use was significantly more likely to occur in women with the following characteristics: early retirement, pain symptoms, longstanding use of analgesics, multiple psychiatric symptoms. Drinking patterns in relation to BZD use indicated that regular weekend drinkers were significantly less likely to be current and/or previous BZD users than problem drinkers and teetotallers. Logistic regression analyses indicated that use of BZDs was mainly predicted by endorsement of multiple psychiatric symptoms.", 
    "71": "Biotransformation of the imidazobenzodiazepine midazolam to its alpha-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy metabolites was studied in vitro using human liver microsomal preparations. Formation of alpha-hydroxy-midazolam was a high-affinity (Km = 3.3 mumol/L) Michaelis-Menten process coupled with substrate inhibition at high concentrations of midazolam. Formation of 4-hydroxy-midazolam had much lower apparent affinity (57 mumol/L), with minimal evidence of substrate inhibition. Based on comparison of Vmax/Km ratios for the two pathways, alpha-hydroxy-midazolam formation was estimated to account for 95% of net intrinsic clearance. Three azole antifungal agents were inhibitors of midazolam metabolism in vitro, with inhibition being largely consistent with a competitive mechanism. Mean competitive inhibition constants (Ki) versus alpha-hydroxy-midazolam formation were 0.0037 mumol/L for ketoconazole, 0.27 mumol/L for itraconazole, and 1.27 mumol/L for fluconazole. An in vitro-in vivo scaling model predicted inhibition of oral midazolam clearance due to coadministration of ketoconazole or itraconazole; the predicted inhibition was consistent with observed interactions in clinical pharmacokinetic studies. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant fluoxetine and its principal metabolite, norfluoxetine, also were inhibitors of both pathways of midazolam biotransformation, with norfluoxetine being a much more potent inhibitor than was fluoxetine itself. This finding is consistent with results of other in vitro studies and of clinical studies, indicating that fluoxetine, largely via its metabolite norfluoxetine, may impair clearance of P450-3A substrates.",

    "73": "The dependence liability of benzodiazepines in the context of their use as hypnotics (i.e. by insomnia patients as pre-sleep medications) is unresolved. A recent study found that insomniacs self administer capsules at bedtime at a high rate, with triazolam (0.25 mg) taken as often as placebo. This study sought to determine if differential self administration would develop when multiple capsules are available nightly. Eighteen men and women, age 21-45 years, with insomnia complaints (nine with objective sleep disturbance and nine without) were studied, 1 week with placebo and 1 week with triazolam (0.25 mg). The two conditions were administered double-blind and presented in a counter-balanced order with a week between conditions. In each condition, after 3 consecutive sampling nights of the available single capsule for that condition, subjects could self administer 0-3 capsules before bed on the 4 subsequent nights. Triazolam was self administered as many nights as placebo, but the number of placebo capsules self administered was twice that of triazolam capsules. The objective insomniacs self administered more capsules than the subjective insomniacs and neither group differentially choose triazolam over placebo. The number of triazolam capsules taken nightly was stable and the number of placebo capsules variable. It is concluded that insomniacs show no short-term escalation of triazolam dose, but do choose an increased and variable number of placebos, a pattern which is interpreted as being insomnia relief-seeking behavior.",

    "78": "During February-June 1992, in Pennsylvania, health workers collected urine specimens from 309 women attending an inner city hospital family planning clinic in Philadelphia so researchers could determine the prevalence of drug and alcohol use in this population and to identify the variables associated with a positive urine screen for drugs and/or alcohol. 48 (15.5%) tested positive for at least one drug metabolite or alcohol. Six (2%) tested positive for at least two substances. The most frequent substances included marijuana (9.4%) and cocaine (4.9%). Other prevalence rates were 1.3% for alcohol, 1% for benzodiazepines and opiates, and 0.3% for amphetamines. The logistic regression revealed that increasing age was the only variable that predicted women having a positive urine drug and/or alcohol screen (odds ratio [OR] = 1.09). Women older than 29 years old had the highest prevalence of recent drug or alcohol use (25.4%). Increased age and history of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) were predictors of use of drugs other than marijuana or alcohol alone (OR = 1.17 and 2.18, respectively). Overall condom use stood at only 24%. Women who screened positive for drugs other than marijuana and alcohol alone had the lowest rates of current condom use (5% vs. 29%) and the highest rate of a history of an STD (70% vs. 29%). These findings indicate a need for family planning providers to screen for drugs and alcohol and to take substance use histories to identify the population at risk. Thus they will be able to provide counseling and treatment referrals, when appropriate, for a population seeking preventive care that might otherwise not be identified.", 
    "79": "Midazolam (MDZ) is metabolized in human liver microsomes by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A subfamily to 1'-hydroxy (1'-OH) and 4-hydroxy (4-OH) metabolites. MDZ is metabolized in the rat primarily to 4-OH MDZ, 1'-OH MDZ, and 1',4-dihydroxy (1',4-diOH) MDZ. The kinetics of 4-OH and 1'-OH metabolite formation were determined using hepatic microsomes from control, Ro 23-7637 and dexamethasone-treated male rats. KM values for the major metabolite, 4-OH MDZ, were 24.5, 43.1, and 32.8 microM, and the corresponding Vmax values were 5.9, 28.9, and 13 nmol/mg/min for the control, DEX, and Ro 23-7637-treated animals, respectively KM values for 1'-hydroxylation of MDZ (the major metabolite) after incubation with human liver microsomes from three individuals were 5.57, 2.50, and 3.56 microM, and the corresponding Vmax values were 4.38, 0.49, and 0.19 nmol/mg/min, respectively. In parallel studies using cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 microsomes, the KM for 1'-OH formation was 1.56 microM, and the corresponding Vmax was 0.16 nmol/mg/min. MDZ was not metabolized by cDNA-expressed human CYP2D6, CYP2E1, or CYP1A2, thus confirming that these isoforms were not responsible for its biotransformation. The formation of 1',4-diOH metabolite in rat and 1'-OH formation in cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 microsomes showed a decrease in velocity at high substrate concentrations. Inhibition studies showed that MDZ hydroxylation was strongly inhibited by ketoconazole and Ro 23-7637 in rat, human, and cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 microsomes. alpha-Naphthoflavone stimulated 1'-OH metabolite formation in human and cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 microsomes at low concentration (10 microM). Naringenin, a flavonoid present in grapefruit juice, also inhibited MDZ metabolism in human liver microsomes. Immunoinhibition studies revealed that polyclonal anti-rat CYP3A2 antibody inhibited MDZ metabolism 80-90% in rat, human, and cDNA-expressed human CYP3A4 microsomes, thus suggesting that members of the CYP3A4 subfamily were involved in the metabolism.", 
    "80": "1. The effects of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists on the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase (AC) activity by various benzodiazepine (BZ) and indoleamine agonists in the rat striatum were investigated. 2. A biphasic inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC activity by the peripheral-type agonist, Ro5-4864, and a multiphasic inhibition by the non-selective BZ, diazepam, was observed. One phase of AC inhibition is consistent with a Gi-coupled receptor-mediated action, whereas the other phases appear to involve a direct effect on the enzyme itself. 3. While the central-type antagonist, flumazenil, had no effect on the ability of Ro5-4864 to inhibit AC activity, the peripheral-type receptor ligand, PK 11195, abolished the first phase of inhibition. 4. PK 11195 and pertussis toxin were found to block the inhibitory effect of various BZs and the indoleamines, melatonin and 2-iodomelatonin, on induced AC activity. 5. Saturation binding studies, conducted at 30 degrees C with [3H]-diazepam revealed a single binding site in the rat striatum (KD = 19.3 +/- 0.80 nM) which significantly decreased in affinity in the presence of GTP (KD = 30.5 +/- 2.6 nM; P < 0.05). No significant change in Bmax was observed. 6. These findings indicate the presence of Gi-coupled BZ receptors in the rat striatum. Thus, suppression of cyclic AMP production may contribute to the diverse neuropharmacological effects of BZs, melatonin and related drugs.", 
    "81": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, activates a variety of receptors in all areas of the CNS. Two major subtypes of GABA receptors are well known: (1) GABAA receptors are ligand-gated Cl- channels that consist of a heteromeric mixture of protein subunits forming a pentameric structure, and (2) GABAB receptors couple to Ca2+ and K+ channels via G proteins and second messengers. Here, Graham Johnston discusses evidence for a third major subclass of GABA receptors. GABAC receptors appear to be relatively simple ligand-gated Cl- channels with a distinctive pharmacology, in that they are not blocked by bicuculline and not modulated by barbiturates, benzodiazepines or neuroactive steroids. Compared with GABAA receptors, GABAC receptors are activated at lower concentrations of GABA and are less liable to desensitization. In addition, their channels open for a longer time. The pharmacology of these novel subtypes of GABA receptors may yield important therapeutic agents.", 
    "82": "We measured [125I] iomazenil binding, labeling the central-type benzodiazepine receptor in 37 discrete rat brain areas following single (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and repeated (7.5 mg/kg/day x 14 days, i.p.) treatment with phencyclidine (PCP), a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate(NMDA)-type glutamate receptor, using in vitro quantitative autoradiographic receptor binding assay. Both single and repeated PCP treatment produced heterogeneous changes in the rat brain in a similar manner, the magnitude of change in [125I] iomazenil binding being generally greater in the repeated treatment group than in the single treatment group. A significant increase in [125I] iomazenil binding was observed in the superficial layer (layer I-IV) of the parietal cortex in both of the PCP treatment groups and the CA1 of the hippocampus of the repeated PCP-treated group. There was a significant decrease in [125I] iomazenil binding in the piriform cortex of the repeated PCP-treated group. These results suggest that the blockade of NMDA receptor-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission by PCP produces the compensational alterations in the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist binding, and that the observed diversity may be due to dissimilar modes of organizations between glutamatergic and the GABA(gamma-aminobutyric acid)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "83": "The potency and specificity of five proposed cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonists, YM022, RP73870, L-740,093, L-365,260 and LY288513, were studied in rats and mice. Gastrin activates rat stomach histidine decarboxylase via cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptors. To examine cholecystokinin-B receptor-mediated effects of the five drugs, they were infused intravenously to fasted rats and the histidine decarboxylase activity in the oxyntic mucosa was determined. While YM022, RP73870, L-740,093 and L-365,260 failed to activate histidine decarboxylase, they dose-dependently antagonized the gastrin-induced histidine decarboxylase activation. LY288513 had no effect in the doses tested. The maximal inhibitory effect of L-365,260, L-740,093, RP73870 and YM022 on histidine decarboxylase, activated by the intravenous infusion of an ED50 does of gastrin (0.4 nmoles/kg/hr), was seen at doses of 3, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.1 mumoles/kg/hr, respectively; the corresponding ID50 values were 0.4, 0.02, 0.007 and 0.004 mumoles/kg/h. In a follow-up study, YM022 and RP73870 were found to produce a rightward shift of the gastrin dose-response curve, which is consistent with competitive inhibition. The effect of the five drugs on a cholecystokinin-A receptor-mediated response was examined by studying gastric emptying in mice. Cholecystokinin-8s, given by a subcutaneous bolus injection, dose-dependently inhibits gastric emptying. The specific cholecystokinin-A receptor antagonist devazepide (given intravenously as a bolus injection) antagonized the effect of cholecystokinin-8s in a dose-dependent manner, with an ID50 value of 28 nmoles/kg. None of the drugs inhibited the gastric emptying or prevented the cholecystokinin-8s-induced effect at the doses tested. The results indicate that YM022, RP73870, L-740,093 and L-365,260 act as cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonists in vivo, being without measurable agonistic activity. Furthermore, they do not interact with cholecystokinin-A receptors at te doses tested. Among the cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonists studied YM022 and RP73870 are superior, the rank order of potency being YM022 > or = RP73870 > L-740,093 > L-365,260.",

A basic contention is that it is useful to consider 2 broad classes of processes-automatic, associative, or sensory/perceptual processes on the one hand and intentional, strategic, or reflective processes on the other hand-as being separate.", 
    "86": "The functional mechanisms of the memory impairments associated with these conditions are beginning to be identified, and there is preliminary evidence that a deficit in an elementary computation may have dramatic consequences on highest cognitive functions. There is also evidence that certain memory impairments are linked to specific dysfunctional outcomes in everyday life. By showing that specific rate-limiting factors of cognitive performance can be identified and are amenable to cognitive interventions, existing data open the door for theoretically and empirically based cognitive remediation of mental disorders.", 
    "87": "The bulk of available evidence (albeit limited) makes the enterprise of cognitive psychopathology quite plausible and convincing.", 
    "88": "Abuse of drugs that potentiate GABAergic neurotransmission, namely benzodiazepines, is difficult to understand because this potentiation should elicit, among other effects, a decrease in activity within the mesolimbic system. Abuse of benzodiazepines is difficult to understand since the opposite, namely an increase in mesolimbic activity, has been implicated in drug abuse as well as in the rewarding effect of direct mesolimbic stimulation. In order to evaluate how the activity of the mesolimbic system depends on mesolimbic GABAergic influence, a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide, was unilaterally injected into the ventral tegmental area and its effect on self-stimulation thresholds derived from stimulations applied to the same area was evaluated. Microinjection of 15, 20 and 30 ng increased the stimulation threshold. This decrease in stimulation efficiency lasted no more than 15 min after which baseline levels were obtained. Such a decrease is paradoxical considering that the manipulation should have released the ventral tegmentum from a tonic inhibitory influence. The metabolic consequences of repeated injections of 30 ng bicuculline were furthermore evaluated by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry. The staining was found to be weak around the injection site and dense in the ipsilateral nucleus accumbens. Release of a tonic GABAergic inhibition added to some cytotoxic damage probably resulted in an increased metabolic activity of this system. The presently reported paradoxical response of the ventral tegmentum and mesolimbic system to a GABAergic challenge may account for the paradoxical relationship between some behavioral properties of the mesolimbic system and GABAergic drugs.", 
    "89": "Many bacterial expression systems have been developed to study the reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). This enzyme exists in the virions as a heterodimer of a 66 kDa (p66) subunit and a 51 kDa (p51) subunit, originating through proteolytic maturation of the p66 subunit. Most expression systems rely on the processing of p66 by bacterial proteases, this results in a p51 subunit with a non-authentic carboxy-terminus. In contrast, the expression system described produces an RT with an authentic carboxy-terminus. This was achieved by the co-expression of the two subunits of HIV-1 RT, which were each cloned on a different, compatible plasmid in Escherichia coli, and by the use of protease inhibitors during cell lysis. This approach enabled us not only to obtain virion-like RT, as verified by mass spectrometry, but also to monitor the effect of mutations in one or both subunits on the activity of RT and on its sensitivity towards RT inhibitors. The co-expression system described represents a useful method to produce HIV-1 RT, both authentic and mutated, in quantities that allow large-scale studies on the functional organisation of the RT-subunits and the sensitivity of the enzyme to RT inhibitors.", 
    "90": "The objective of this study was to determine the effects of ondansetron on the pharmacokinetics of temazepam and on pharmacodynamics relevant to its use as oral premedication. Twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 of each sex) were administered the following oral treatments in a randomised, double-blind crossover design: temazepam 20 mg plus placebo; or temazepam 20 mg plus ondansetron 8 mg. Blood samples were taken for plasma temazepam assay at intervals up to 32 h after administration. In addition, a brief battery of psychomotor tests was administered 1 h prior to dosing and 1 and 4 h after dosing. Analysis of the derived pharmacokinetic parameters showed no differences between the treatments described above. Analysis of data from the dynamic measures likewise showed no difference between the treatments. It was concluded that the co-administration of ondansetron did not influence the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamic actions of temazepam.", 
    "91": "The effect of a bolus and continuous infusion of midazolam on postoperative morphine consumption was assessed in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomly allocated trial of 50 patients undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy. Patients in the trial group received a bolus dose of midazolam 5 mg.70 kg-1 at induction followed by an infusion at a rate of 1 mg.70 kg-1.h-1 over the next 48 h. Morphine consumption in the midazolam group was significantly lower in the first 12 h postoperatively (p < 0.02) but there was no significant difference between the two groups thereafter. Patients in the midazolam treated group had lower pain scores over the first 24 h. Also, a significantly greater number of patients in the midazolam group required no antiemetic medication over the 48 h study period (p < 0.05). Assessment of sedation revealed no significant difference between groups. We conclude that low dose midazolam has a significant, but short-lived, morphine sparing effect.", 
    "92": "Recent studies exploring benzodiazepine memory effects have used the distinction between explicit and implicit tasks. There is now increasing evidence that implicit tasks can be \"contaminated\" by conscious uses of memory and that unconscious (automatic) use of memory can contaminate explicit tasks, leading to mistaken estimates of their respective influences on memory performance. The aim of the present double-blind, double-placebo study was to assess the memory effects of diazepam and lorazepam using a process-dissociation procedure in a stem-completion task, this procedure providing uncontaminated estimates of conscious and automatic memory processes. The memory task was administrated to 60 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to one of three parallel groups (placebo, diazepam 0.3 mg/kg, lorazepam 0.038 mg/kg). Lorazepam markedly reduced conscious as well as automatic influences of memory. Diazepam also reduced conscious uses of memory, albeit to a lesser extent than lorazepam, but did not decrease the influence of automatic memory. Secondary analyses showed that when the deleterious effect on conscious uses of memory was equated between a diazepam subgroup and the lorazepam group, only lorazepam impaired the automatic use of memory. This study strongly suggests a qualitative difference in the memory effects of the two benzodiazepines. It has some implications regarding the relationships between states of consciousness and memory processes.", 
    "93": "In vivo microdialysis was used to investigate the effects of an IP injection of diazepam or buspirone (each at 3 mg/kg) on spontaneous efflux of noradrenaline in rat frontal cortex, and on changes in efflux induced by naturalistic stress. After drug administration, rats either remained in their home cages or were transferred individually to a novel cage, 1 h later. The novel cage was brightly lit (1500 lux) and contained another, unfamiliar rat. After transfer to the novel cage, noradrenaline efflux was lower in diazepam-injected rats than in their vehicle-injected counterparts. However, in both cases, stress caused a significant increase in efflux and the net increase was not affected by diazepam. Similarly, buspirone, which increased spontaneous efflux of noradrenaline, did not affect the net increase in efflux during stress. Neither compound modified locomotor activity in the novel cage. This suggests that any changes in noradrenaline efflux are unrelated to drug effects on non-specific arousal. It is concluded that generically unrelated anxiolytic agents can have different effects on spontaneous efflux of noradrenaline but do not modify the noradrenergic response to naturalistic stimuli.", 
    "94": "Research on the effects of antidepressant/ antipanic drugs in animal models of anxiety has yielded equivocal results, even after chronic drug regimens. In contrast, we found that the antidepressant/antipanic drug phenelzine, given acutely, produced a clear anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze, a widely-used animal model of \"anxiety\" that is primarily sensitive to benzodiazepine-type anxiolytics (e.g., diazepam). Furthermore, the effective dose of phenelzine (15 mg/kg) administered to rats was associated with more than a 2- fold increase in whole brain levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), whereas an ineffective dose of phenelzine (5.1 mg/kg) did not significantly change GABA levels. The N-acetylated metabolite of phenelzine, N2-acetylphenelzine, produced neither an anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus-maze nor a significant change in whole-brain levels of GABA. However, both phenelzine and N2-acetylphenelzine potently inhibited monoamine oxidase, a mechanism commonly thought to be involved in the therapeutic effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as phenelzine in the treatment of depression in humans. These results suggest that the mechanism whereby phenelzine produces anxiolytic effects in the plus-maze model is unique to a facilitatory action on brain levels of GABA, in contrast to classical benzodiazepines, which produce anxiolytic effects by enhancing the affinity of the GABAA-receptor for GABA.", 
    "95": "A comparative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic investigation was carried out on the interaction between the hypnotic midazolam and 2 different macrolide-type antibiotics, clarithromycin and azithromycin. In an open randomized crossover study of 3 phases 12 healthy volunteers received either clarithromycin (250 mg twice a day for 5 days), azithromycin (500 mg once a day for 3 days) or no pretreatment. On the last day of antibiotic treatment they ingested 15 mg midazolam. Plasma samples were collected for midazolam analysis up to 24 h and pharmacodynamic performance measured by a series of tests up to 12 h. Pretreatment with clarithromycin caused large and statistically significant changes in both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of midazolam compared to control. For example, the AUC was increased from 248.84-888.75 hng/ml (factor of 3.57, p < 0.0001) and the mean duration of sleep increased from 135.4 min to 281.3 min (p < 0.05). No statistically significant effect was found with azithromycin in any test. It is concluded that a drug interaction exists between midazolam and clarithromycin which could be of clinical importance. No such effect is present with azithromycin.", 
    "96": "Benzodiazepine drugs may impair breathing during sleep, leading to the development of sleep-disordered breathing or, in subjects with sleep apnoea, an increase in the severity of pre-existing apnoeas. Flumazenil is a selective benzodiazepine-antagonist. We hypothesized that endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine receptors might contribute to the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) and that the intensity of OSAS could, therefore, be reduced by flumazenil. Ten male patients (mean age 55 yrs, mean body mass index 42.4 kg.m-2, mean apnoea index (AI) 53.5 and mean respiratory disturbance index (RDI) 74.2) were investigated. None of the patients had been treated for OSAS prior to the study. The study design was randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled and cross-over. On the first or second study night, patients were randomly assigned to receive i.v. flumazenil (2 mg) or placebo (0.9% NaCl) between 01:00 and 01:30 h. Comparing the polysomnographic results of the placebo night and the flumazenil night in all 10 patients, no significant differences were found regarding obstructive events or sleep architecture. Accordingly, the data concerning sleep-disordered breathing and sleep stages during the 30 min period prior to and the 30 min period following the administration of flumazenil did not differ. It is concluded that endogenous ligands of the benzodiazepine receptor play no role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, since respiratory and sleep data are not altered by flumazenil. Therefore, attempts to treat obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome with flumazenil do not seem to be warranted.", 
    "97": "Eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal mortality. The prevention of seizure activity in pre-eclampsia and recurrent seizures in eclamptic patients is an essential aspect of management. Many drugs with anticonvulsant properties have been used to treat patients with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate is a significantly better drug than either diazepam or phenytoin for preventing recurrent seizures in eclamptic patients. Magnesium sulfate has diverse cardiovascular and neurological effects and also alters calcium metabolism. Although the drug crosses the placenta and may affect the fetus, these effects are clinically small and fetal morbidity has been shown to be reduced in randomised studies comparing magnesium sulfate to either phenytoin or benzodiazepines. Dosage regimens of magnesium sulfate are empirical. Because adverse effects of this agent are related to toxicity, the establishment of greater efficacy by using higher dosage regimens needs to be tested against a greater risk of adverse effects. The most serious toxicity related to magnesium sulfate use is magnesium sulfate use is neuromuscular blockade that may result in respiratory arrest. Magnesium sulfate is now the drug choice for treating eclamptic patients. However, further studies are required to establish the role of this agent as a prophylactic agent in the prevention of eclampsia.",

Despite the widespread use of this drug, detailed pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic information is lacking, especially with respect to inhibition of seizure activity. TZ disposition has been described previously by methods with limited specificity, and the concentration-anticonvulsant effect relationship has not been characterized. The current studies were undertaken to examine TZ disposition with a specific HPLC method, and to evaluate the relationship between anticonvulsant effect and concentration in Sprague-Dawley rats. TZ pharmacokinetics were characterized after bolus or infusion administration; in a separate experiment, TZ pharmacodynamics were assessed with pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. The systemic disposition of TZ could be described with a two-compartment model; systemic clearance ranged from 2.45 to 5.30 L/h/ kg, steady-state volume of distribution ranged from 2.10 to 4.02 L/kg, and mean residence time ranged from 47 to 65 min. The concentration-effect relationship was well described by a simple Emax model: Emax, expressed as the ratio of post-TZ to pre-TZ threshold convulsant doses of pentylenetetrazol, was 9.9 +/- 0.7, and the EC50 values were 10.0 +/- 4.6 ng/mL and 34.8 +/- 9.0 ng/g in serum and whole brain tissue, respectively. Under single-dose conditions, TZ is a very potent anticonvulsant in the rat pentylenetetrazol seizure model.", 
    "103": "Although the incidence of anxiety disorders diminishes with age, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms among older patients is substantial. These symptoms, which include cognitive and somatic manifestations, are a source of diminished quality of life. The many potential sources of illness- and medication-induced anxiety must be excluded before instituting treatment. The general principles of antianxiety medication treatment in older patients include: (i) symptom relief with minimum sedation; (ii) improvement in sleep; (iii) freedom from autonomic and cognitive toxicities; and (iv) freedom from physical dependence and drug interactions. Older compounds such as the tricyclic antidepressants should be avoided, since more modern agents (e.g. benzodiazepines and buspirone) are well tolerated and effective. Modern antidepressants have also been used to reduce anxiety symptoms, although there is a potential for the opposite effect to occur. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors appear to be better suited to treating syndromes such as panic and obsessive-compulsive disorder, whereas nefazodone would be a better choice for generalised anxiety complicated by depression.",

For experiment 2, paired samples were collected in non-SST and SST and submitted by mail for therapeutic drug monitoring. The SST samples were either decanted from SST prior to shipment (group 1; n = 30) or mailed in SST with serum in contact with the silica gel (group 2; n = 57). Drug concentrations and drug elimination half-life were compared between groups. For both experiments, drugs were detected in samples, using polarized immunofluorescence.", 
    "116": "For experiment 1, the rate constant of drug disappearance for both drugs was greater in the 4-ml SST-A (P < 0.0001). This SST also caused the greatest percentage decrease (20% for phenobarbital and 35% for benzodiazepines) at 96 hours. Refrigeration reduced the mean decrease in phenobarbital at 96 hours to 11%. For experiment 2, phenobarbital concentration was lower for both SST, compared with non-SST (P < 0.0005). Phenobabital had decreased a mean 6.4 +/- 0.5% in group-1 and a mean 30.5 +/- 11.1% in group-2 (P < 0.0005) samples.",

    "119": "This study was designed to compare the renal effects of sedation with alphaxalone-alphadolone, etomidate, propofol, midazolam, fentanyl-fluanisone, and thiopental in rats. The sedative dose was defined as the highest dose that abolished the escape response without affecting the righting reflex. Female Wistar rats were chronically catheterized with a jugular vein catheter, and urine flow rate and renal clearances of inulin (glomerular filtration rate = GFR), sodium, and lithium (used as an index of proximal tubular function) were measured in the conscious, unrestrained state (n = 107 experiments). In a separate series (n = 70 experiments), the effect of sedative doses of each drug on the nociceptive threshold was tested with the tail-flick test. Responses in sedated animals were compared to responses in animals infused with the vehicle. Fentanyl-fluanisone and thiopental had hypoalgesic actions in sedating doses. Propofol, fentanyl-fluanisone, and thiopental reduced GFR by 20-30%. Urine flow rate was significantly decreased by propofol (-24%) and thiopental (-48%). Propofol and fentanyl-fluanisone reduced fractional lithium excretion by 9-13%. Only alphaxalone-alphadolone, etomidate, and midazolam produced sedation without affecting renal function in rats. Because midazolam produced the most consistent degree of sedation, we conclude that midazolam is the least confounding sedative agent for renal function studies in conscious rats.", 
    "120": "The functional integrity of Alzet osmotic minipumps was assessed using two organic solvents (50% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/50% (v/v) propylene glycol (PG) and 100% tetraglycol) which dissolve diazepam, an aqueous insoluble benzodiazepine. Both solvents showed a significant decrease in output rate over time: the decline with tetraglycol was, however, more marked and variable. Further, the DMSO/PG vehicle demonstrated a comparable decline in rate (1.45%) to that of the control vehicles saline and water (1.12%). DMSO/PG is therefore a suitable solvent for the chronic delivery of diazepam from osmotic minipumps.",

The time from injection of muscle relaxant(s) to ablation of T1 (clinical onset) and recovery of T1 to 25% of control height (clinical duration) was recorded. Intubating conditions 45 seconds after administration of muscle relaxants were assessed. There was no significant difference in clinical onset time between succinylcholine (mean +/- SD, 47.4 +/- 6.5 seconds) and the combination of mivacurium-rocuronium (51.2 +/- 13.4 seconds). Intubating conditions with mivacurium-rocuronium were comparable to those of succinylcholine. The clinical duration of rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg (38.9 +/- 12.3 minutes) was prolonged by the addition of mivacurium (49.0 +/- 9.6 minutes).",

The third patient had an initial threshold of 336 mC that increased to 840 mC at the end of the course of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and remained elevated during a second course of ECT. All three patients were elderly men with complicated medical histories and ongoing low-dose benzodiazepine use. Each patient had an excellent response to ECT delivered with a custom modified device, capable of delivering more than twice the charge of ECT devices presently commercially available in the United States.

    "135": "1. Acetylcholine (ACh) and the M1 agonists (McN-A-343 or PD142505) relaxed human isolated pulmonary arteries which were pre-contracted with noradrenaline (10 microM). In preparations where the endothelium had been removed ACh induced a contractile response whereas the M1 agonists (McN-A-343 or PD142505) had no effect. 2. ACh- and McN-A-343-induced relaxations were abolished after treatment of endothelium-intact preparations with the drug combination NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG: 0.1 mM) and indomethacin (1.7 microM). 3. The affinity (pKB value) for pirenzepine was higher in human pulmonary arteries when tissues were relaxed with McN-A-343 as compared with ACh (pKB values, 7.71 +/- 0.30 (n = 4) and 6.68 +/- 0.15 (n = 8), respectively). In addition, the affinity for pFHHSiD against McN-A-343- and ACh-induced relaxations was 6.86 +/- 0.13 (n = 3) and 7.35 +/- 0.11 (n = 9) respectively. 4. The low affinities for methoctramine in human isolated pulmonary arteries with the endothelium either intact or removed, suggested the lack of involvement of M2 and M4 receptors in the Ach responses. 5. Phenoxybenzamine (3 microM: 30 min) abolished both ACh contraction and relaxation in human pulmonary artery. The ACh contraction was present when the phenoxybenzamine treatment was preceded by incubation with pFHHSiD (2 microM) but not with pirenzepine (1 microM). In addition, the ACh relaxation was present when preparations were treated with either pFHHSiD (2 microM) or pirenzepine (1 microM), before exposure to phenoxybenzamine. 6. These results in human isolated pulmonary arteries support the notion that only M3 receptors, on smooth muscle, mediate the ACh-induced contraction whereas M3 and M1 receptors are involved in the endothelium-dependent ACh-induced relaxation.", 
    "136": "Despite a prolonged period of research with benzodiazepines, the central site(s) of action for the hyperphagic effects of these compounds remains to be determined. The aim of the present studies was to examine the effect of direct administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam into the IVth ventricle on ingestive behavior in nondeprived rats. In Experiment 1, microinjection of midazolam (3 and 30 micrograms/microliter) into the IVth ventricle was sufficient to increase consumption of a palatable mash. In Experiment 2, the hyperphagic effect was blocked by systemic administration of the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (20 mg/kg). The results indicate that a brainstem site of action may be important for the effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists on ingestive behavior.", 
    "137": "The development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam, clobazam, and diazepam were studied in genetically epilepsy-prone rats following intraperitoneal (IP) or oral administration. The anticonvulsant effects were evaluated on seizures evoked by means of auditory stimulation (109 dB, 12-16 kHz). All compounds showed 60 min after IP injection antiseizure activity with ED50 against clonus of 0.24 mumol kg-1 for clonazepam, 0.72 mumol kg-1 for diazepam, and 3.9 mumol kg-1 for clobazam. After 120 min of oral administration the ED50 against clonus of 2.37 mumol kg-1 for clonazepam, 15.8 mumol kg-1 for diazepam, and 30 mumol kg-1 for clobazam. The dose chosen for the chronic treatment were 2.5 mumol kg-1 for clonazepam, 15 mumol kg-1 for diazepam, and 30 mumol kg-1 for clobazam. The animals were treated three times daily for 4 or 6 weeks. Auditory stimulation was administered 60 min after drug IP injection on various days. During treatment, tolerance was observed as a loss of drug anticonvulsant effects. No changes of occurrence of audiogenic seizures was observed in rats treated with vehicle. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant activity developed most rapidly during clobazam treatment, less rapidly following diazepam treatment, and most slowly during clonazepam treatment. Sixty minutes after IP injection on various days of chronic treatment the motor impairment induced by these benzodiazepines was also studied by means of a rotarod apparatus. The tolerance to the motor impairment developed more rapidly than the anticonvulsant effects. The response to auditory stimulation to benzodiazepines was stopped 24 and 48 h after chronic treatment with these compounds, showing no residual drug effects and that rats were still tolerant. The genetically epilepsy-prone rats is a reliable and sensitive model for studying long-term effects of anticonvulsant drugs.", 
    "138": "We report two patients with subacute diffuse encephalopathy characterized by confusion, myoclonic encephalopathy, and mild akineto-rigid extrapyramidal signs in one case and by apathy, memory deficit, and partial complex seizures in the other. Hashimoto's thyroiditis with high titers of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies was diagnosed in both patients, who were unresponsive to anticonvulsant medication, but showed rapid neurological improvement following steroid treatment. On neuropsychological examination, predominant frontotemporal dysfunction was noted. Electroencephalographic activity was remarkable for its rhythmical delta activity, unresponsive to, or even paradoxically increased by, anticonvulsant treatment. On magnetic resonance imaging, atrophy with temporal predominance was found. These observations support the idea that this potentially treatable dementia and movement disorder should be classified as a separate clinical entity.", 
    "139": "Although chronic arterial hypertension is the leading cause of intracranial hemorrhage, an abrupt rise in systemic arterial pressure in normotensive people may sometimes induce a hemorrhagic stroke. Dental treatment is rarely associated with such an event. We report here on two middle-aged women, apparently healthy, who suffered from a fatal intracerebral hemorrhage following a dental treatment. On admission, high levels of arterial hypertension were found. It seems that trigeminal manipulation during dental treatment as well as increased serum levels of induced epinephrine mainly by stress and pain, and the small amounts absorbed from the site of local anesthesia might produce abrupt elevation of blood pressure, subsequent increase in cerebral blood flow and severe, even fatal intracerebral hemorrhage. The addition of catecholamines to local anesthetics should be considered. We recommend the use of benzodiazepin as a premedication drug to reduce stress during dental treatment.", 
    "140": "The present studies were designed to test the learning and memory capacities of transgenic mice with central overexpression of corticotropin-releasing factor in a forced alternation water T-maze task and in the Morris water maze. In T-maze testing, littermate control mice reached a criterion of 70% correct responses after five days of trials, while the performance of transgenic subjects was still random after the same training. In Morris maze testing, control subjects reached the submerged platform significantly faster (F(1.48) = 4.51, P < 0.05) after three days of trials, while the performance of transgenic mice was unimproved over the same period. The deficit in Morris maze performance in transgenic mice was reversed when the platform was visible above the surface of the water. Pre-test administration of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), before acquisition training also produced a significant (F(4.40) = 16.61, P < 0.001) and persistent improvement in Morris maze performance in transgenic mice when compared to vehicle-treated transgenic litter mates. Finally, there was no evidence of hippocampal cell loss in transgenic brains. The results suggest that corticotropin-releasing factor-overexpressing mice exhibit a profound learning deficit without sensory or motor-related impairments, and that memory plasticity can be restored by anxiolytic pre-treatment. Thus, constitutive overabundance of brain corticotropin-releasing factor may produce hyperemotionality that interferes with learned behaviors. Stress-related disorders characterized by co-morbid deficits in learning/memory may benefit from pharmacological normalization of brain corticotropin-releasing factor systems.", 
    "141": "To determine risk factors for ankle and foot fractures, data collected from 9704 women 65 years of age or older from four areas of the United States were analyzed. Self-reported baseline questionnaires covered areas such as lifestyle factors (physical activity, diet, and smoking habits) and functional impairment (history of fracture, falling, and other diseases). Bone mineral density (BMD) and performance on neuromuscular tests were also measured. During 5.9 years of follow-up, 191 women fractured an ankle and 204 women fractured a foot. Proportional hazard models were used to estimate relative risks. In multivariable models, factors associated with ankle fracture included one or more falls in the year prior to baseline (relative risk [RR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.1), greater vigorous physical activity (RR per 2 times/week, 1.2; CI 1.1-1.3), weight gain since age 25 (RR per 20% gain, 1.4; CI 1.2-1.5), self-reported osteoarthritis (RR 0.5; CI 0.3-0.8), a sister's history of hip fracture after age 50 (RR 1.7; CI 1.0-3.0), out of house < or = 1 per week (RR 3.0; CI 1.4-6.6), and low distal radius BMD (RR per -0.1 g/cm2, 1.2; CI 1.0-1.4). Factors associated with foot fracture included insulin-dependent diabetes (RR 2.9; CI 1.2-7.2), use of seizure medications (RR 2.3; CI 1.0-5.7) or of benzodiazepines (RR 1.5; CI 1.1-2.2), history of hyperthyroidism (RR 0.5; CI 0.3-1.0), poor far depth perception (RR 0.7; CI 0.5-1.0), and low distal radius BMD (RR per -0.1 g/cm2, 1.3; CI 1.1-1.5). Ankle and foot fractures have different profiles of risk factors that are largely independent of low bone mass.", 
    "142": "The gastrointestinal peptide, gastrin, tonically stimulates growth of human colon cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, and does so in a receptor-mediated fashion. This study defined the nature of gastrin binding in human colon cancer using [3H]L-365,260, a specific cholecystokinin B (CCK-B)/gastrin antagonist found to block gastrin's effects on growth. Following elucidation of optimal binding conditions (e.g., pH, time, and temperature) in log phase HT-29 human colon cancer cells, specific and saturable binding with a dissociation constant of 4.8 +/- 0.7 nM and a maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 320 +/- 120 fmol/mg protein, consistent with a single binding site, was recorded. Binding was localized to the membrane fraction. Exposure to gastrin or receptor antagonist decreased and increased, respectively, the Bmax. Competition experiments indicated that L-365,260 was 25- and 200-fold more effective at displacing radiolabeled L-365,260 than gastrin and cholecystokinin, respectively. In contrast to log phase cells, the Bmax was decreased by 67 to 76% in confluent and postconfluent cultures. Binding activity was observed in other cell lines examined, as well as in xenografts and colon cancers obtained at surgery. Binding in normal human colonic mucosa was 10-fold less than in colon cancer. These results provide the first comprehensive identification and characterization of a CCK-B/gastrin-like receptor in human colon cancer.",

Sufentanil or midazolam, respectively, also were infused. Systolic hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia, and bradycardia were assessed by measuring heart rate and blood pressure every minute during operation.

    "147": "Previously, we demonstrated that, in rats with chronic bile-pancreatic juice (BPJ) diversion, pancreatic enzyme secretion was increased after feeding animals a 25% casein fat-free diet. We determined whether cholecystokinin (CCK) or the cholinergic pathway is associated with the response of pancreatic secretion after protein ingestion in the diverted rats, using a potent CCK antagonist, MK-329 or FK-480, and a cholinergic blocker, atropine. Secretion rates of chymotrypsin and trypsin in the fasting state were very high 7 days after a BPJ diversion, and the hypersecretion of the proteases was markedly reduced with an injection of MK-329, FK-480, or atropine and was further reduced by combined injection of FK-480 and atropine. The lowered secretion of the proteases in CCK-antagonized rats was increased after oral feeding of a protein diet and after a duodenal instillation of some protein sources, especially hydrolysate of guanidinated casein (HGC). The CCK-independent increases by HGC instillation are completely depressed by atropine. In rats treated with only atropine, the lowered secretion tended to be increased by a duodenal instillation of HGC. Increases in secretion after an administration of the protein source in CCK-antagonized rats were not affected by bestatin, an inhibitor of brush-border peptidases. We conclude that the stimulatory effects of dietary protein on the pancreatic enzyme secretion partially do not depend on CCK in chronic BPJ-diverted rats and that the CCK-independent increase is atropine sensitive.",

    "152": "We reviewed the outcome (seizures and development) of 25 cases with West syndrome in which antiepileptic drugs (valproate sodium, clonazepam) or high doses of vitamin B6, instead of ACTH therapy, were administered for the initial treatment. Five of 9 cryptogenic cases (56%) and 4 of 16 symptomatic cases (25%) showed complete cessation of spasms. In cryptogenic cases, response to vitamin B6, valproate sodium or clonazepam was not predicted by clinical features (age of onset, seizure type, initial EEG finding or treatment lag). On the other hand, response to these drugs was correlated with some clinical findings in symptomatic cases; all infants with neurocutaneous syndrome (tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis type 1) had controlled infantile spasms, while none of patients with severe neonatal asphyxia or with prior other seizures responded. Twenty of 25 patients have been followed-up. The average age at follow-up was 5 years and 8 months. Prognosis of both cryptogenic and symptomatic \"responders\" was favorable; all had seizures controlled, and 50% had normal psychomotor development or only mild impairment (DQ > 70). Symptomatic \"nonresponders\" had the worst prognosis. Our results suggest that choice of drug in the initial treatment of West syndrome should be determined by clinical features (especially etiology).", 
    "153": "A sensitive and specific method was developed for the determination of alprazolam and its major metabolite alpha-hydroxyalprazolam in plasma. After the addition of deuterium-labeled internal standards, plasma samples were buffered to pH 9 with 1 ml of saturated sodium borate buffer, extracted with toluene-methylene chloride (7:3) and evaporated to dryness. The residues were treated with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide containing 1% of trimethylchlorosilane and analyzed on a Finnigan-MAT mass spectrometer operated in the negative-ion chemical ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Restek-200 capillary column using hydrogen as the carrier gas. The assay was linear from 0.25 to 50 ng ml-1 for both compounds. The intra-assay precision for alprazolam was 16.1% at 0.5 ng ml-1 and 4.6% at 50 ng ml-1 and that for alpha-hydroxyalprazolam was 15.8% at 0.5 ng ml-1 and 4.2% at 50 ng ml-1. The method was used to determine alprazolam and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam in human plasma samples collected after a single 2 mg oral does of alprazolam. A peak concentration of 32.9 ng ml-1 of alprazolam was detected at 1 h following the dose."
