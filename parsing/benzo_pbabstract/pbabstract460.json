At baseline, panic subjects scored higher than normal control subjects, who had been matched for age and sex, on avoidant, dependent, histrionic, and paranoid personality subscales. Improvement in panic symptoms after 3 years was associated with reductions in these same subscale scores. Examination of individual items that distinguished panic from normal subjects showed themes of dependency, lack of self-confidence, emotional instability, and sensitivity to criticism that reflected demoralization in the panic disorder subjects. To a large extent, the findings reveal nonspecific, state-dependent effects of panic and agoraphobic symptoms on the personality functioning and morale of patients with panic disorder.", 
    "1": "To assess the potential for encapsulated hepatocytes as a bioartificial liver support system, rabbit hepatocytes were encapsulated within multicomponent capsules using a complex coacervation technique, and cultured both on plates and in a perfusion reactor. The urea synthesis rate and antipyrine and diazepam degradation rates were evaluated in each system over a 10 day period, and compared with standard plate-cultured hepatocyte efficacy. Urea synthesis rates were significantly higher in the perfusion cultures than in either of the plate culture environments, whereas drug degradation rates were not significantly different in any of the systems.", 
    "2": "Pharmacologic control of refractory status epilepticus has been little-studied in experimental models. In this experiment, rats in status epilepticus induced by lithium and pilocarpine were treated with MK-801 alone, diazepam alone or MK-801 plus diazepam, with treatment begun at a time when this model of status is refractory to anticonvulsant drugs. EEG samples were digitized before and for two hours after treatment, and the digitized samples subjected to computerized frequency analysis. MK-801 plus diazepam halted all manifestations of status epilepticus. Although neither MK-801 alone nor diazepam alone stopped the ongoing electrographic status epilepticus, both drugs diminished motor seizures and total EEG power. MK-801 treatment prevented the progression of changes in EEG pattern which normally occurs in this model of status epilepticus, while diazepam did not. MK-801, with and without diazepam, allowed the rats to survive the episode of status epilepticus, but rats treated with MK-801 alone required several days to recover completely, while the MK-801 plus diazepam rats appeared normal the next day. MK-801 may be a useful agent for treatment of human refractory status epilepticus, because of its neuroprotective action as well as its ability to potentiate GABAergic drugs.", 
    "3": "The effects of diazepam on voltage-gated Ca channels were studied in PC12 pheochromocytoma cells using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. An inward current activated by a depolarizing voltage step to +10 mV from a holding potential of -60 mV in 10.8 mM Ba was larger than that activated in 10.8 mM Ca. The Ba current was completely blocked by a low concentration of Cd (30 microM) and was also sensitive to nicardipine (100 nM to 10 microM). Diazepam (1-100 microM) inhibited the Ba current in a concentration-dependent manner. Neither diazepam nor nicardipine affected the current-voltage relationship or the dependence on holding potentials of the Ba current. Both slightly accelerated the inactivation time course of the Ba current. When diazepam was applied to the cells in combination with nicardipine, the observed inhibition agreed with a value predicted assuming independent blockade by diazepam and by nicardipine. These results suggest that diazepam inhibits Ca channels in a manner similar to nicardipine, but that the binding sites for diazepam are different from those for nicardipine.", 
    "4": "Sixteen days of testosterone acetate (TA) treatment in male rats induced an increase in the densities of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in the adrenal and Cowper's glands and a decrease in PBR density in the testis. TA did not alter PBR density in the heart, cerebral cortex, or pituitary, or central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) density in the cerebral cortex or hypothalamus. The antiandrogenic agent cyproterone acetate induced a decrease in PBR density in the testis, adrenal, and pituitary, but did not affect PBR density in Cowper's glands, heart, or cerebral cortex, or CBR density in the cerebral cortex or hypothalamus. In all of the above organs, affinity values did not change following the treatment with both agents. The receptoral changes may be relevant to the physiological and neurobehavioral effects of the chronic exogenous androgenic and antiandrogenic treatment.", 
    "5": "Mice submitted to surgical stress induced by laparotomy and treated with chronic alprazolam (1 mg/kg) showed a reduction in stress-induced suppression of thymus and spleen cellularity, as well as in peripheral T lymphocyte population. The blastic response of spleen lymphoid cells was also assessed and found to partially supress the inhibitory effect of surgery.", 
    "6": "We investigated blocking effects of pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and atropine on the negative chronotropic and dromotropic responses to stimulation of the intracardiac vagus nerves in the anesthetized, open-chest dogs. Stimulation of the intracardiac vagus nerves to the sinoatrial nodal region (stimulation of the intracardiac parasympathetic nerves to the sinoatrial nodal region) or to the atrioventricular nodal region (stimulation of intracardiac nerves to the atriventricular region) selectively decreased heart rate or increased atrioventricular conduction time, respectively. Pirenzepine at lower doses (0.3-3 microgram/kg i.v.) attenuated the stimulation of the negative chronotropic response to the intracardiac parasympathetic nerves to the sinoatrial nodal region to 80% of the control response significantly but did not affect the negative dromotropic one. Similarly, higher doses (10-1000 micrograms/kg i.v.) of pirenzepine inhibited the chronotropic and dromotropic responses to each stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. AF-DX 116 (0.3-300 microgram/kg i.v.) inhibited the chronotropic and dromotropic responses to each stimulation in a similar dose-dependent manner. Atropine (1-30 microgram/kg i.v.) blocked the cardiac responses to each stimulation. However, the ID50 of atropine for the chronotropic response was less than that for the dromotropic one, although ID50s of pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 for the chronotropic and dromotropic responses were not different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "7": "Anxiety disorders are extremely common in modern society. The Epidemiologic Catchment Area (ECA) Study reported a 1-month prevalence for anxiety disorders of 7.3%, and a lifetime prevalence of 14.6%. Three anxiety disorders were emphasized: panic disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 1.6%, phobic disorders with a lifetime prevalence of 12.5%, and obsessive compulsive disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 2.5%. Data from the ECA survey indicated that all of these disorders are more common in women than in men. Familial proclivities toward anxiety have been reported. Panic attacks may be easily provoked by lactate infusions, CO2 inhalation, and other agents in individuals with a history of panic attacks. The physiologic relevance of these findings to the treatment of anxiety disorders in general and panic disorder in particular is discussed. Effective treatment for panic disorder can be achieved with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The advantages and disadvantages of each class are discussed. Recent data pointing to considerable morbidity for both panic attacks and panic disorder are also reviewed.", 
    "8": "Panic disorder is characterized by unexpected, unprovoked attacks of cognitive symptoms (e.g., dread, fear) and physical symptoms (e.g., palpitations, trembling, shortness of breath). It is the most common anxiety disorder seen in clinical practice. Pharmacotherapy has been shown to be effective in controlling symptoms of panic disorder, although potential disadvantages (e.g., adverse drug reactions, withdrawal syndrome, dependency) must be carefully assessed and balanced against the advantages. Current data indicate that for panic disorder, benzodiazepines prescribed for more than a 6-month period are as effective as other forms of pharmacotherapy, i.e., monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants. Generally, doses of benzodiazepines used for the treatment of panic are higher compared to those used for generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "9": "Findings from a four-city study of the beneficial and adverse effects of hypnotics are reported. The study employed a new volunteer call-in method for monitoring drug effects outside of the clinical setting. Respondents were recruited through newspaper advertisements. They were invited to complete a short telephone interview if, during the past 12 months, they (1) had significant trouble with insomnia or (2) had taken a medication to induce sleep. Comparison groups were flurazepam, temazepam, triazolam, and over-the-counter (OTC) sleep medications. An untreated insomnia group also was included. Results indicate that most users of prescription hypnotics attributed positive effects to their sleep medications and that adverse effects were infrequent. OTC hypnotics were less effective and more likely to produce negative effects. The untreated insomnia group was more symptomatic than any of the medication groups.", 
    "10": "The sedative/hypnotic benzodiazepines introduced worldwide in the early 1960s were acclaimed for their low chemical toxicity and safety in clinical use. A decade later, some researchers and clinicians found that while all the drugs had undoubted potency and efficacy as sleep inducers and maintainers, the trade-off in residual effects (e.g., excessive daytime tiredness, poor concentration, impaired psychomotor performance, lowered mental abilities) was cause for concern. These sequelae not only affected patients' safety and ability to perform daytime tasks, but were also counter-therapeutic; the daytime sleep that was produced interfered with the natural nocturnal sleep. In a recent study, the degree to which patient abilities were impaired was measured by a number of psychomotor tests. Benzodiazepines with a duration of clinical effect of less than 8 to 10 hours produced fewer, less frequent residual effects than those with a measurable activity in excess of the normal nocturnal sleep period.", 
    "11": "Insomnia and anxiety are frequently experienced not only by healthy persons, but in their more intense expressions, by patients suffering from a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (1990) lists 88 types of sleep disorders. Thirty-three of these are related to insomnia and belong to the categories of intrinsic sleep disorders, extrinsic sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep disorders, and sleep disorders associated with medical or psychiatric disorders. Benzodiazepines are frequently used for the treatment of insomnia. For optimal treatment of insomnia, exact diagnosis, correct understanding of the biology, and appropriate use of the drugs are essential.", 
    "12": "Effectiveness of alprazolam in daily dosages of 0.8-1.2 mg was studied in 28 patients who showed psychotic symptoms or autonomic imbalance symptoms after operation for breast cancer. Psychotic symptoms included depression, anxiety, tension, and restlessness, and symptoms of autonomic imbalance included sleep disorder, anorexia, and pains. All of these symptoms were improved at high ratios by alprazolam. The drug was very useful in 16 cases (57.1%), useful in 11 cases (39.3%), and slightly useful in one case (3.6%). The only adverse reaction reported was unsteady gait in one case.", 
    "13": "The M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine 6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one) was derivatized to explore points of attachment of functionalized side chains for the synthesis of receptor probes and ligands for affinity chromatography. The analogues prepared were evaluated in competitive binding assays versus [3H]-N-methylscopolamine at four muscarinic receptor subtypes (m1AChR-m4AChR) in membranes from rat heart tissue and transfected A9L cells. 9-(Hydroxymethyl)pirenzepine, 8-(methylthio)pirenzepine, and a series of 8-aminosulfonyl derivatives were synthesized. Several 5-substituted analogues of pirenzepine also were prepared. An alternate series of analogues substituted on the 4-position of the piperazine ring was prepared by reaction of 4-desmethylpirenzepine with various electrophiles. An N-chloroethyl analogue of pirenzepine was shown to form a reactive aziridine species in aqueous buffer yet failed to affinity label muscarinic receptors. Within a series of aminoalkyl analogues, the affinity increased as the length of the alkyl chain increased. Shorter chain analogues were generally much less potent than pirenzepine, and longer analogues (7-10 carbons) were roughly as potent as pirenzepine at m1 receptors, but were nonselective. Depending on the methylene chain length, acylation or alkyl substitution of the terminal amine also influenced the affinity at muscarinic receptors.", 
    "14": "Ketamine and midazolam can produce analgesia following intrathecal administration in rabbits. However, neurotoxicity studies are required before these agents can be considered safe for clinical use. The aim of this study was to evaluate by histologic and blood-brain barrier (BBB) studies whether ketamine or midazolam could be used as an alternative to local anesthetics or opioids to produce spinal analgesia. Forty white New Zealand rabbits were randomly assigned to four groups of 10. In the conscious animal, 0.3 ml 0.9% saline solution, 1% lidocaine, 1% ketamine, or 0.1% midazolam was intrathecally injected intracisternally using a modification of the technique of Yaksh et al. Light and fluorescence microscopy were performed on transverse spinal cord sections by a neuropathologist unaware of the administered agents. All spinal cord section slides were scored within four zones: upper cervical, lower cervical, median thoracic, and lumbar segments. Spinal cord homogeneous lesions with higher scores than those of lidocaine-treated animals were considered abnormal. The BBB study showed evidence of neurotoxicity for ketamine, whereas light microscopy indicated no significant differences in comparison with saline and lidocaine. Midazolam-treated rabbits showed significant changes in both BBB and light microscopy studies. In view of these results, the intrathecal use of midazolam should be avoided in humans. Lesions observed following ketamine suggest the need for further experimental studies of the solvent and different ketamine enantiomers to establish definitively the safety of intrathecal free ketamine in humans.", 
    "15": "Intravenously administered lorazepam (0.05 mg/kg), diazepam (0.25 mg/kg), and midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) were compared for sedation during oral surgery under local anesthesia. Sixty patients were randomly allocated into three groups in this double-blind, parallel study. The results from this trial show that all three drugs provide satisfactory sedation. Average mean arterial pressures, however, decreased significantly with midazolam and diazepam. Statistically significantly higher heart rates during the entire procedure were also found for lorazepam when compared with diazepam and midazolam. At the postblock stage, the midazolam group had respiratory rates that were significantly higher than those of the other two drug groups. Patients in the diazepam and midazolam groups took significantly longer to complete the pegboard test at the preblock stage than those in the lorzepam group. At 1, 1.5, and 2 hours after arrival in the recovery room, an inversion of groups took place, with the lorazepam group taking significantly longer for their tests than the other two groups. Significantly more improvement in anxiety levels was found at 10 minutes postdrug for the patients who had received diazepam and this tended to remain so on arrival in the recovery room. When compared with the other two groups, significantly more patients in the lorazepam group reported giddiness/dizziness and significantly more in the diazepam group reported pain on injection.", 
    "16": "Acute methadone detoxification was induced by the intravenous administration of naloxone during simultaneous intravenous sedation with midazolam, a fully reversible short-acting benzodiazepine, in seven patients addicted to opiates. Within hours the patients tolerated full doses of naltrexone. This technique enables patients to transfer easily, quickly, and safely from methadone to naltrexone maintenance.", 
    "17": "Safety and efficacy of two drug regimens used for sedation and analgesia during lower-extremity angiography were studied. Midazolam (loading dose 14.5 micrograms/kg; maintenance dose, 7.2 micrograms/kg) with or without fentanyl (loading dose, 0.725 micrograms/kg; maintenance dose, 0.362 micrograms/kg) was administered in a blind fashion as an IV bolus to 50 patients. Hemodynamic responses were monitored, and a standardized questionnaire was given to the patient before, immediately after, and 8-24 hr after the procedure. Physicians also were asked questions after the procedure. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were not significantly different before and 2 min after administration or between groups. A small but significant decrease in blood pressure occurred 2 min after the loading dose was given in both groups. Both drug regimens had statistically significant anxiolytic effects; however, anxiolytic effects were superior in the midazolam/fentanyl group (p less than .02). Patients rated the overall effectiveness of anesthesia with midazolam/fentanyl as superior (p less than .02). Analysis of physicians' judgments of the effectiveness of sedation and analgesia showed a statistically significant advantage for the midazolam/fentanyl group (p less than .01). We conclude that midazolam/fentanyl appears to be as safe as and more efficacious than midazolam alone for sedation and analgesia during lower-extremity angiography.", 
    "18": "Few studies of prescription-drug misuse have taken into account the numbers of prescriptions dispensed for specific drugs. Using data from the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) and the National Prescription Audit, we calculated indices of drug misuse for specific prescription drugs that are used mainly in outpatient settings and are either benzodiazepines, barbiturates, other sedative-hypnotics, analgesics, or CNS stimulants. In 1983-1985 the drugs associated with the highest numbers of DAWN medical examiner-reported drug-misuse deaths were codeine, diazepam, propoxyphene, phenobarbital, and secobarbital. However, the drugs with the highest indices of DAWN medical examiner-reported drug-misuse deaths/100,000 dispensed prescriptions were methamphetamine, methaqualone, amobarbital, secobarbital, and glutethimide. An index of fatality risk, calculated as 100 x DAWN medical examiner-reported drug-misuse deaths/DAWN emergency room-reported drug-misuse episodes, suggested that the risk of death from a glutethimide-associated drug-misuse episode had increased 92% from 1975-1979 to 1983-1983 and in 1983-1985 was the highest for the drugs studied. These indices might assist public health authorities attempting to design effective strategies to efficiently address the problem of prescription-drug misuse.", 
    "19": "The anxiolytic efficacy of tetrabamate was evaluated in a multicentric double-blind study versus lorazepam and placebo, in 269 patients with a generalized anxiety disorder according to DSM III-R criteria. The anxiolytic activity of tetrabamate (at 900 mg/day) was significantly superior than that of placebo from day 7 of treatment and equivalent to lorazepam efficacy (at 4.5 mg/day). In the tetrabamate group, 55.3% were considered as \"good responders\" (as defined by a HARS score reduction equal or superior to 50%), versus 51.3 and 32.9% respectively in the lorazepam and the placebo groups (chi-square = 9.63, p = 0.008). Sheehan's scales (parts 1 and 2), Norris visual analogue scales, CHESS 84, CHESS complement 82 for withdrawal evaluation, physician's overall evaluation of efficacy and tolerance, were also used to assess the clinical effects of tetrabamate. The data on these measures confirmed the anxiolytic efficacy of tetrabamate and showed some advantages in the tetrabamate group in comparison with the lorazepam group: a better global tolerance at the study end point (day 35), a greater efficacy on some anxiety somatic items and lesser frequency and severity of withdrawal symptoms during treatment tapering off.", 
    "20": "In order to assess the clinical usefulness of benzodiazepine brief therapy with planned tapering, prazepam as drops was administered to 40 psychiatric outpatients suffering from generalized anxiety disorder. After a one-week placebo period, the patients received prazepam 40 mg daily (i.e., 10 drops in the morning, 10 drops at noon and 20 drops in the evening) during 3 weeks, with the possibility to adjust the doses after one week. The doses were then tapered at 4 mg/d (i.e., 1 drop in the morning, 1 drop at noon and 2 drops in the evening) until complete suppression of the treatment. The assessments, performed before the placebo period, at inclusion, after 1 and 3 weeks of active treatment, and after 1 and 2 weeks of tapering, included the Hamilton anxiety scale, the Lader tranquillizer withdrawal rating scale, and the collection of side effects; moreover, the patients completed daily a visual analogue scale. Results showed a very marked anxiolytic effect of prazepam with an already very significant decrease in the scores on the various scales after 1 week of treatment when the daily dose was significantly reduced. Three quarters of the patients were able to take part in the tapering of prazepam doses without exhibiting any reappearance of anxious symptomatology, rebound anxiety, or withdrawal symptoms. The tolerance of the treatment was rated as good or very good in 91.9% of the patients. This study demonstrates the possibility of a brief anxiolytic treatment followed by tapering in a majority of patients with generalized anxiety disorders. For this strategy, the availability of a drop form represents an obvious advantage.", 
    "21": "Studies were undertaken to determine the effects of 7-day phenobarbital and phenytoin exposure on 14-day-old glial cell cultures of fetal murine cortex. Biochemical markers monitored were Ro5-4684-displaceable 3H-flunitrazepam binding, 3H-beta-alanine uptake, glutamine synthetase activity, and protein content. Phenobarbital concentrations were 30, 60, and 120 micrograms/ml and phenytoin concentrations 15, 30, 60 micrograms/ml. There were no discernible phase microscopic changes at any concentration of either drug. Phenobarbital produced no significant changes in the biochemical measures monitored. Exposure to phenytoin produced no biochemical changes at 15 micrograms/ml, but did produce significant changes at 30 and 60 micrograms/ml. There was an increase in Ro5-4684-displaceable 3H-flunitrazepam binding signifying increased binding or an increase in the number of binding sites and perhaps an increased population of glial cells although, the unchanged protein content suggests that the number of glial cells was not increased. There was a decrease with 30 and 60 micrograms/ml phenytoin of 3H-beta-alanine uptake suggesting interference with normal membrane transport of this compound. The latter effect may well mirror changes in GABA uptake in glial cells in the presence of phenytoin.", 
    "22": "Experimental studies performed on 97 alert rats and clinical studies in 930 cancer patients after extracavity surgery have demonstrated the advantage of the elaborated technique of total intravenous anesthesia of patients on spontaneous respiration with microdoses of diazepam, fentanyl, calypsol and droperidol over the current variants of inhalation and intravenous anesthesia with preserved spontaneous respiration. The technique elaborated is characterized by technical simplicity, efficacy, prompt postanesthetic rehabilitation of patients, safety for the personnel and economic benefits. The technique might be useful in mass injuries due to its minimum effect on the basic body functions and possibility of air breathing, with no special devices required.",

Flumazenil and an internal standard, midazolam, are isolated by a basic extraction. The final extract is separated on a 25-m BP-1 capillary column and drugs are detected by selected ion monitoring at m/z 229 and m/z 310 for flumazenil and the internal standard, respectively. The minimum detectable quantity is 1.0 ng/mL, for flumazenil in plasma. Coefficients of variation for within-run data were less than 6%.", 
    "25": "To help determine its mechanism of action, the convulsant benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864 was administered (15-20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally (IP) and electrophysiological and behavioral effects were compared; parallel studies were conducted with picrotoxin (PTX; 1 mg/kg). Both PTX and Ro 5-4864 produced myoclonic seizures, primarily between 15-40 min after administration; myoclonus was followed by more severe seizures after PTX. Both Ro 5-4864 and PTX produced a maximal increase in amplitude and decrease in threshold of the population spike (PS) evoked in the dentate gyrus (DG) by stimulation of the dorsal perforant path prior to peak seizure activity; start latency of the PS and initial slope and amplitude of the population slow wave (SW) were not changed. Amplitude of the PS was already increased by 5 min after administration of Ro 5-4864 and was maximally increased 1.8- to 3-fold, depending on stimulus intensity, usually by 10 min. Similarly, by 20 min after administration, PTX had also increased PS amplitude in the absence of an effect on PS latency or the SW. The increase in PS amplitude without concomitant changes in the SW suggests that Ro 5-4864 enhanced coupling between the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and firing of the postsynaptic neurons, i.e., it enhanced E-S coupling, as has also been suggested for PTX. The similarity in the effects of Ro 5-4864 and PTX suggests that antiGABAergic effects, perhaps along feedforward inhibitory pathways, are involved in both the seizures and enhanced E-S coupling.", 
    "26": "The parents of 17 children with a history of convulsions, were shown how to administer liquid diazepam through the rectum using a 1 mL insulin syringe, in order to alleviate a convulsion at home or any where ever this may occur. Eight of the children had suffered from repetitive and/or prolonged non-temperature related convulsions, four had epileptic status and five had suffered from simple fever related convulsions, complicated in four and in a convulsive status in 1; the number of fever-related convulsions ranged between 1 and 6 per child and those non temperature related ranged from one daily to once a month. The observation of the children was done in an 88 month period (between 1 and nine months per child, averaging 5.2 months). In seven of the children, it was required of the parents to administer rectal diazepam a total of 90 times (fluctuating between 2 and 25 doses per child), with no complications, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg was administered in those patients whose convulsions lasted over 5 minutes or more. In 75 occasions, the convulsion stopped within a period of 2 to 5 minutes, in 12 other times there was a need for repeated dosages and in 2 occasions, a third doses was needed. Only in one occasion was hospital management needed. Therefore, we conclude that the administration of rectal diazepam by parents--at home--is a useful and secure method to prevent prolonged convulsions and the epileptic status; it gives parents security and tranquility using an instrument which can be used in any circumstance therefore reducing anguish and the cost of hospital care.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "A questionnaire survey was mailed to all members of the Child Neurology Society in North America to determine current methods used by pediatric neurologists in the management of febrile seizures and the influence of public awareness of phenobarbital side-effects on practice. Responses were received from 574 of 869 deliverable questionnaires (66%). The mean number of febrile seizures treated by respondents was 42 +/- 58 (mean +/- S.D.), of which 22 +/- 36 were simple and 19 +/- 31 were complex. In the control of the acute, continuing febrile seizure, intravenous phenobarbital, lorazepam, and diazepam were equally preferred and phenytoin was used infrequently. For intermittent administration by parents, diazepam was prescribed by 20% for seizure prevention and by 31% for control of seizure recurrence. Long-term phenobarbital was prescribed by 89% for prevention of complex febrile seizures and by 43% for simple febrile seizures. Parental anxiety was a factor in the prescription of intermittent or long-term therapy by 67% of respondents.", 
    "28": "In a longitudinal study of 1230 people aged 13-18 years from the Greater Oslo Area, the past-year prevalence of anxiolytic or hypnotic use was 10%, which is higher than previously reported. The majority gave therapeutic reasons as a motive for using these drugs. However, most of the use was unprescribed. The parents, and especially the mother, were the most important suppliers. A minority gave intoxication as a motive for using these drugs. In this group, the suppliers were mainly peers and the illegal market. Neither the unprescribed nor the prescribed therapeutic use show any association with use of drugs such as alcohol and cannabis. There is, however, a strong association between the unprescribed use of benzodiazepines by young people and by their parents. This suggests a pattern of learning and role modelling, which must be regarded as problematic for public health policy. Those who use the drugs to become intoxicated have particularly poor mental health, and they use many other drugs as well. This group probably runs a special risk of developing more serious drug abuse.", 
    "29": "Perioperative antiarrhythmic therapy with lidocaine (bolus dosage 100 mg followed by infusion of 200 mg/h) was performed in 24 patients; 12 of them simultaneously received an intravenous injection of 10 mg midazolam with the bolus of lidocaine (group I: with midazolam; group II: without midazolam). Central venous blood samples were collected over a period of 1 h (1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min after the bolus) to evaluate unbound and total (protein-bound + unbound) plasma concentrations of lidocaine, thus calculating plasma protein binding. One minute after intravenous administration of lidocaine peak plasma concentrations occurred: in group I 5.38 +/- 1.99 micrograms/ml (mean +/- SD), in group II 5.25 +/- 1.90. Up to 60 min there was only a gradual decrease in plasma concentrations in both groups. There was no significant difference between the two groups (group I: mean free concentration 0.67-0.80 micrograms/ml; mean total concentration 4.84-5.38 micrograms/ml; mean plasma protein binding 83%-86%; group II: 0.69-0.89 micrograms/ml; 4.62-5.25 micrograms/ml; 82%-85%). We draw the conclusion that midazolam administration is safe in patients undergoing antiarrhythmic therapy or regional anesthesia with lidocaine.",

Thirty-day pretreatment with both Brahmighritham and benzdiazepam served to make the rats more insensitive to epileptogenic events.", 
    "32": "The efficacy and tolerability of Diazemuls versus conventional diazepam as endoscopic premedication was evaluated in a study with a cross-over design performed in 26 patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy. No statistically significant differences were found between the two forms of premedication with regard to degree of sedation, patient compliance or recovery of psychomotor function. With respect to short-term amnesic effects, efficacy and tolerability Diazemuls was comparable to the conventional formulation of diazepam. Diazemuls may therefore be proposed as an alternative premedication for endoscopy.", 
    "33": "All of the commonly used anticonvulsants drugs, except possibly primidone, are cleared from the human body mainly by metabolism. The metabolites of phenytoin, phenobarbital and ethosuximide have so far not been shown to possess significant pharmacological activity. However, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, derived from carbamazepine, has anticonvulsant activity comparable with that of its progenitor, while oxcarbazepine, a new anticonvulsant congener of carbamazepine, is essentially a prodrug for its 10-hydroxy derivative. Valproic acid forms numerous metabolites through a variety of pathways; 2-en valproic acid, a beta-oxidation derivative, probably contributes to its anticonvulsant action, though the extent of the contribution is uncertain. Another metabolite, 4-en-valproic acid, has been considered a possible hepatotoxin and teratogen. N-Methyl-phenobarbital and primidone, though both anticonvulsants in their own right, are metabolised to phenobarbital, which probably mediates much of their antiseizure effect. Primidone also yields the weaker anticonvulsant phenylethylmalonamide. The various benzodiazepine anticonvulsants form numerous metabolites, some of which possess both antiseizure and other forms of pharmacological activity. As yet, there is little understanding of how best to interpret simultaneous plasma concentration measurements of anticonvulsant drug and its active metabolite (or metabolites) in the clinical situation, and the possible roles of anticonvulsant metabolites in the idiosyncratic toxicity of these drugs remain largely unexplored.", 
    "34": "Diazepam given i.v. to goats at 0.2 mg/kg body wt suppressed transport-induced hypercortisolaemia, hyperglycaemia, tachypnoea and tachycardia. A rebound increase in cortisol concentrations, respiratory and heart rates was seen during the recovery period after sedation.", 
    "35": "In this new epidemiological investigation, it is first of all observed that the proportion of chemical toxicological investigations instituted by the police in the area served by the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of T\u00fcbingen, has not risen despite increases in the use or abuse of drugs and alcohol consumption although 80 per cent of those concerned are car and motorcycle drivers. On the other hand, is has been noticed in recent years that such investigations are instituted especially when the level of blood alcohol measured does not explain the actual condition of the person concerned. Just under 20 per cent of the affected persons denied consumption of a drug, and more than half admitted the use of a drug. Just under one fifth admitted using two drugs. The remainder used three and four agents. In about half of all cases, the statements were confirmed by the result of the chemical toxicological investigations. In contrast to an investigations of our own, the confirmation of the admissions does not correlate with the rising blood alcohol content. About 63 per cent of the 676 cases investigated had taken analgesics, beta blockers or calcium antagonists, hypnotics or sedatives, gastrointestinal agents and psychoactive agents. The percentage of active agents from the benzodiazepine group, which is subject to the Narcotics Law, is especially great. Finally, the blood and urinary levels of benzodiazepines and individual psychoactive agents measured as well as the pertinent blood and urinary alcohol values were compared with the constellations described in the medical examination and the divergences from the data obtained experimentally are discussed.", 
    "36": "A two-year-old, right-handed girl was admitted to our hospital with a history of partial seizures. The first seizure, conjugated eye movements and head turning to the right, occurred at the age of 24 months. Later, she suffered from several seizures daily at the age of 34 months. At the age of 35 months, she was admitted to our hospital. On admission her neurological examination was normal. EEG showed a left parietal spike focus. A computed tomographic scan showed a small hyperdense area in the left parietal lobe without contrast enhancement. She was treated with carbamazepine (CBZ : 6 mg/kg/day). When seizures occurred several times within an hour, intravenous or rectal administration of diazepam (DZP : 0.3 mg/kg/dose) was added. However, she complained of sleepiness. The seizures occurred more frequently than before, 50 to 80 times daily, and became secondarily generalized. We thought that the exacerbation of the seizures resulted from the somnolence caused by DZP and CBZ. Consequently, these drugs were discontinued, and phenytoin was begun. She has since been free of seizures for two years. Approximately one year after the discontinuance of DZP and CBZ, heterotopic gray matter and abnormal gyri involving the left parieto-temporal lobe were found by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is useful for detecting small heterotopic gray matter. To summarize this case, one should consider the possibility that excessive polytherapy induces seizures, particularly in patients with structural brain abnormalities such as heterotopic gray matter.", 
    "37": "The effects of 20-mg doses of the short-acting benzodiazepine, temazepam, on sleep, performance and pineal, adrenal and temperature rhythms were investigated in a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. Ten healthy males were studied 4 d prior to flying from Sydney to London via Tokyo and Anchorage (11 time zones). Temazepam or placebo were administered at 2300 hours (local time) during the flight and for 4 d after arrival. After a 7-d recreation break in London, the subjects returned to Sydney via Moscow and Tokyo and again took five doses of temazepam or placebo. During the 5 d following their arrival in London or Sydney, the subjects collected urine, had rectal temperature monitored, performed a battery of performance tests and filled out questionnaires. Temazepam significantly improved various subjective sleep characteristics, particularly on the first few nights. Performance (choice reaction time, critical flicker fusion threshold and pencil and paper tests) was not impaired by temazepam treatment. The pineal rhythm was assessed by urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin excretion rate determinations. The time of peak 6-sulphatoxymelatonin excretion (acrophase) occurred progressively later each day after arrival in London and Sydney, however the rate of adjustment of the rhythm was not affected by temazepam. Similarly, the urinary cortisol and temperature rhythms adjusted to the new environments by progressive delay with no drug effect being evident. Administration of temazepam clearly had a beneficial effect on sleep and alertness following transmeridian travel, without detrimental effects on performance. There was no evidence to suggest that temazepam altered the rates of entrainment of physiological rhythms to the new environments.", 
    "38": "The prolonged sedation of benzodiazepines may be inconvenient for the patient. Reversal of sedation, therefore, would be desirable. Accordingly, we assessed the efficacy of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in a placebo-controlled randomized trial including 40 adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under diazepam (Diazemuls) sedation. We found no significant differences between groups with regard to either performance (two tests) or duration (within 240 min) of sedation. There were no noticeable side effects.", 
    "39": "Quantitative evaluation of octadecaneuropeptide-like immunoreactivity (ODN-Li) was carried out in hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of group-reared or three month isolated male Wistar rats, whether muricidal or not. ODN-Li was lower in cortex and cerebellum of isolated animals, (mainly in muricidal) than of group-reared ones. A similar trend was apparent in the hippocampus. No significant differences were observed between muricidal and non-muricidal animals. The results are discussed in terms of the involvement of the endogenous ligands of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the integrations related to mood and behaviour.", 
    "40": "The relationship between self-reports of caffeine ingestion on two occasions and measured plasma concentrations of caffeine and its major metabolites was examined. A subject population [25 men and 25 women, age 20-45 years (mean: 28.7 yr)] that was enrolled in a benzodiazepine pharmacokinetic study underwent general medical screening on two occasions, each including detailed caffeine histories. Before beginning their scheduled study, plasma samples were obtained and evaluated by HPLC for caffeine, paraxanthine, theophylline, and theobromine. These values were compared with estimates of caffeine consumption in mg/day generated from both histories. There was no significant difference between plasma levels of caffeine, metabolites, or caffeine plus metabolites for categories corresponding to reports of low, intermediate or high caffeine use. A self-reported caffeine consumption of greater than 300 mg/day (high) did correlate, however, with a significant smoking history. The authors conclude that self-reports of caffeine ingestion do not accurately reflect acute exposure, and that if caffeine use is of importance in a given setting, reports should be confirmed by biochemical means.", 
    "41": "Serum concentration-time course profiles, serum protein binding, and disposition parameters of lorazepam (LRZ), a benzodiazepine with sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic, and anti-seizure properties, were studied as part of a systematic effort to define population-specific pharmacokinetic behavior in humans with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). Twenty-four healthy subjects (nine tetraplegic, six paraplegic, nine able-bodied) were given an IV bolus of 2.0 mg of LRZ. Noncompartmental estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters disclosed a 37% decrease in the total systemic clearance (CL) of LRZ in tetraplegic patients. Altered LRZ clearance was observed independently of significant changes in volume of distribution or serum protein binding. The early elimination of LRZ (0-10 hr) was characterized by wide fluctuations in serum concentration suggestive of impaired enterohepatic circulation and could be distinguished from LRZ elimination observed in able-bodied subjects. We conclude that decreased systemic CL and the altered terminal elimination profile of LRZ are attributable to the pathophysiology of SCI.", 
    "42": "Thirty-six patients with panic disorder underwent sodium lactate infusion before and after 8 weeks of treatment with alprazolam or placebo. With reinfusion, those patients panic-free with chronic alprazolam treatment displayed significantly decreased reactivity to lactate, as measured by subjective symptom ratings, duration of infusion before developing peak lactate-induced symptoms, and the proportion of patients experiencing lactate-induced anxiety or panic. Patients panic-free on placebo, as well as nonresponders to alprazolam treatment, displayed some, although less striking, decreases in reactivity to lactate with reinfusion. As a group, patients clinically unchanged with placebo treatment showed no systematic change in lactate response with reinfusion. Although the small numbers of patients in each treatment outcome group prohibit drawing definitive conclusions, these findings suggest that decreases in lactate-induced panic after successful alprazolam treatment of panic may result from a combination of changes in clinical state and direct effects of the medication.", 
    "43": "This study was designed to evaluate the effects of flumazenil in reversing sedation from midazolam and meperidine after oral surgical procedures. Of the 35 patients entered, efficacy was evaluated in 33 and safety in 34. Patients were tested for sedation, psychomotor skills, and memory during a 3-hour period and at a 24-hour follow-up. Flumazenil almost totally reversed the effects of sedation for approximately 2 hours, after which some loss of effect was observed. A number of central nervous system-related side effects were observed in the flumazenil group, but none of these was considered serious. One patient in the flumazenil group had an episode of hypotension that precluded further testing.", 
    "44": "The electroencephalographic (EEG) analog signal is complex and cannot easily be described by univariate variables. Clear visual changes in the EEG power spectrum can be present with little or no change in univariate variable values. A method that could produce a single value based on the total data available in the EEG power spectrum would be very useful in monitoring EEG changes. Neural network analysis is a technique that can take multiple inputs and produce a single output value using complicated processing patterns that require training to establish. We examined the usefulness of a series of neural network models to classify 63 EEG patterns against sedation level in 26 mechanically ventilated patients requiring midazolam for long-term sedation. During a stable period of sedation, a 4- to 60-minute period of EEG data was obtained concurrently with a sedation level from 1 (follows commands) to 7 (no or gag response to suctioning of the endotracheal tube). The EEG power spectrum was divided into equal frequency bands, and the log absolute powers in each of these bands were used as inputs for a series of neural network models. The output target was the sedation level associated with each set of EEG data. Networks were trained on a subset of EEG power/sedation score data pairs, and the ability to classify the remaining data pairs was tested. Using a t-test comparison with a random set of sedation levels, we found that trained neural network models classified EEG patterns against sedation level successfully (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "48": "Serial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were measured for 3 hours after a standard mixed meal.", 
    "49": "Acute pretreatment of normal male volunteers with pirenzepine produced a dose-related improvement in carbohydrate tolerance. Peak post-prandial plasma glucose levels were delayed and significantly reduced following 200 mg orally (6.5 +/- 0.1 mmol/l), but not following 100 mg (7.3 +/- 0.3), compared with placebo (7.6 +/- 0.3). Peak insulin levels were similarly delayed and reduced by the 200 mg dose only (36.5 +/- 6.1 mU/l, compared with 49.8 +/- 8.7). Suppression of nocturnal GH by 200 mg pirenzepine at night produced a small reduction in fasting plasma glucose (5.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/l, compared with 5.3 +/- 0.1, P less than 0.02) but did not improve subsequent breakfast carbohydrate tolerance. Peak plasma glucose in NIDDMs was reduced following pirenzepine (12.4 +/- 0.9 mmol/l) compared with placebo (14.3 +/- 1.0, P less than 0.01). This reduction was equally significant in obese and non-obese groups. Peak plasma insulin was also reduced by pirenzepine (22.4 +/- 3.9 mU/l) compared with placebo (42.4 +/- 5.3, P less than 0.01). Insulin suppression was quantitatively greater in obese than in non-obese patients.", 
    "50": "Improvement in carbohydrate tolerance after pirenzepine in normal subjects is dose related and largely independent of GH suppression. Cholinergic blockade can also improve meal carbohydrate tolerance with simultaneous reduction in plasma insulin concentrations in non-insulin dependent diabetics, particularly those with obesity.", 
    "51": "A critical evaluation of anaesthetic agents in the puerperium is difficult because systematic, relevant studies are still lacking. Current knowledge of the effects of different agents used in labour and caesarean section indicates that significant residual effects on the mother and newborn are limited. In the early puerperium, based on physiological and/or hormonal changes, the mother could be more sensitive to inhalational anaesthetic agents and local analgesics. To date there is no evidence that any anaesthetic agent is excreted in breast milk in clinically significant amounts when given as a single dose. The only exception is perhaps in the case of very premature neonates whose mothers have had multidrug therapy before labour. Even then the importance of breast milk should be carefully assessed against possible adverse drug effect. However, repeated administration of long-acting benzodiazepines and continuous epidural administration of pethidine (meperidine) can have adverse effects on the neonate. The essential conclusion of this review is that breast-feeding is best. The different anaesthetic agents are excreted in the milk in amounts so low that detrimental effects on the neonate should not be expected.", 
    "52": "Benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed drugs worldwide. This popularity is based not only on their efficacy but also on their remarkable safety. Pure benzodiazepine overdoses usually induce a mild to moderate central nervous system depression; deep coma requiring assisted ventilation is rare, and should prompt a search for other toxic substances. The severity of the CNS depression is influenced by the dose, the age of the patient and his or her clinical status prior to the ingestion, and the coingestion of other CNS depressants. In severe overdoses, benzodiazepines can occasionally induce cardiovascular and pulmonary toxicity, but deaths resulting from pure benzodiazepine overdoses are rare. Quantitative determinations of benzodiazepines are not useful in the clinical management of intoxicated patients since there is no correlation between serum concentrations and pharmacological and toxicological effects. Benzodiazepine overdoses occurring during pregnancy rarely induce serious morbidity in mothers or fetuses, although large doses administered near delivery can induce respiratory depression in neonates. The teratogenic potential of benzodiazepines remains controversial, but is probably small if it exists at all. There is clear evidence that the prolonged use of even therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines will lead to dependence. The risk of developing significant withdrawal symptoms is related to dosage and duration of treatment. Prevention of gastrointestinal absorption should be initiated in all intentional benzodiazepine overdoses. Forced diuresis and dialysis techniques are not indicated since they will not significantly accelerate the elimination of these agents. Intravenous administration of flumazenil, a pure benzodiazepine antagonist, effectively reverses benzodiazepine-induced CNS depression.", 
    "53": "In an effort to control prescription abuse of benzodiazepines, the New York State Department of Health (DOH) enacted a regulation requiring the use of triplicate prescriptions for these medications. DOH predicted that this regulation would reduce the overall abuse of benzodiazepines and eliminate widescale organized fraud and abuse without any negative impact or reduced availability to patients. Following implementation of the regulation, the authors reviewed all psychiatric emergency room cases and outpatient clinic walk-in evaluations over a 3-month period in an urban medical center and identified 59 cases in which the use of benzodiazepines was a significant presenting problem. Of these, 24 (41%) were judged to be directly related to the new triplicate regulation. In all but one of these cases the patient presented because of symptoms or concerns directly stemming from the refusal by a clinician to continue prescribing a benzodiazepine in a previously established pattern. Typically, abrupt discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment led to a withdrawal syndrome and/or the unmasking of a previously treated anxiety disorder. In attempting to redress what are essentially criminal substance abuse problems through the regulation of legitimate clinical practice, regulatory agencies may ultimately deprive patients of appropriate, legitimate, and efficacious treatments.",

The risks due to anaesthesia and surgery were considered to be very high because of the severe dysrhythmias and renal dysfunction. Anaesthesia was induced with fentanyl and midazolam and maintained with additional fentanyl, midazolam, and 60% nitrous oxide. Dobutamine, dopamine, lignocaine and a temporary pacemaker were used to control cardiovascular responses during surgery. Mild hypotension and tachycardia occurred, but neither circulatory failure nor other major complications were observed during and after the operation.", 
    "55": "Ralitoline (RLT) is a new thiazolidinone derivative with potent anticonvulsant activity in different seizure models. During Phase I studies, RLT was well tolerated in human volunteers and showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range tested (up to 150 mg). Since RLT will soon be entering clinical Phase II studies, we were interested in obtaining predictive data for effective plasma concentrations in patients. For this purpose, the anticonvulsant potency of RLT was determined in four seizure models in mice, and plasma levels were measured at time of peak drug effect. The four models were the threshold for maximal (tonic extension) electroshock seizures (MES), the threshold for clonic seizures determined by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), the traditional MES test with supramaximal (50 mA) stimulation, and generalized clonic seizures induced by s.c. administration of PTZ. Furthermore, median minimal \"neurotoxic\" doses (TD50s) were determined by the rotorod and chimney test for calculation of protective indices. All data obtained for RLT were compared with data obtained with standard antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, and diazepam. The onset of anticonvulsant action after i.p. injection of RLT was very rapid, and the peak drug effect was already obtained after 2 min. In the MES models, RLT was the most potent compound. \"Active\" plasma levels ranged from approximately 300 ng/ml in the MES threshold test to approximately 1,300 ng/ml in the MES test. RLT was also capable of increasing the PTZ threshold, whereas, possibly because of its short duration of action in mice, it was not very active in the s.c. PTZ seizure test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "56": "The quality of sedation and postoperative recovery have been assessed for intra-operative sedation provided by either patient-controlled sedation with propofol or a standard method using divided doses of midazolam and fentanyl, in 40 ASA 1 day surgery patients undergoing extraction of third molar teeth under local analgesia. Patient-controlled sedation with propofol produced sedation no deeper than full eyelid closure with prompt response to verbal command, but deeper levels were seen in three patients in the midazolam and fentanyl group. Patient satisfaction was higher in the patient-controlled sedation propofol group for both subjective intra-operative feelings (p less than 0.01) and willingness to have the procedure again in the same manner (p less than 0.05). Amnesia was more limited to intra-operative events (rather than extending into the postoperative period) in the patient-controlled sedation propofol group (p less than 0.05). Drug dose was correlated with duration of procedure and surgical difficulty in the patient-controlled sedation propofol group but not in the midazolam and fentanyl group. Postoperative testing included a new computerised test, the FAST index, which indicated a dose-dependent reduction in cognitive function in the midazolam and fentanyl group, which persisted until the time of discharge. Changes in cognitive function in the patient-controlled sedation propofol group in the same postoperative interval were significantly less and not related to propofol dose.", 
    "57": "Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory.", 
    "58": "The effect of orally administered ranitidine on the pharmacokinetic properties of orally and intravenously administered triazolam was determined. Twelve healthy males with a mean age of 35 years were enrolled in this four-way, randomized, crossover study. Each subject received a total of four treatments, each separated by one week. The treatments consisted of (1) one orally administered 0.25-mg triazolam tablet after treatment with ranitidine; (2) one orally administered 0.25-mg triazolam tablet, with no ranitidine pretreatment; (3) a 0.25-mg intravenous dose of triazolam after treatment with ranitidine; and (4) a 0.25-mg intravenous dose of triazolam, with no ranitidine pretreatment. Ranitidine pretreatment consisted of five 150-mg oral doses (as the hydrochloride salt) given every 12 hours; the last dose was given two hours before triazolam was administered. Blood samples were taken at intervals up to 12 hours after triazolam treatment. Serum triazolam concentrations were measured by modified high-performance liquid chromatography, and pharmacokinetic values were calculated. Pretreatment with ranitidine had no effect on the disposition of intravenously administered triazolam but significantly increased the area under the serum drug concentration-time curve of oral triazolam. Ranitidine pretreatment had no effect on triazolam's terminal elimination rate constant or on the time to reach maximum serum triazolam concentration. Ranitidine pretreatment increased the systemic availability of triazolam by increasing its absorption.", 
    "59": "Eighty normotensive female patients were studied in a randomized, double-blind investigation, in which orally administered clonidine 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg and 0.3 mg were compared with a standard benzodiazepine premedicant. Clonidine 0.2 mg produced a significant reduction in anxiety (P less than 0.05) compared with all the other groups, and a better quality of induction of anaesthesia when compared with temazepam 20 mg and clonidine 0.1 mg. The decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate with clonidine 0.3 mg were significant compared with the other treatment groups. Hypotension persisted into the postoperative period after premedication with clonidine 0.3 mg, and this dose is not recommended as a routine premedicant.", 
    "60": "The objectives of this study were to assess midazolam and propofol as sedative agents for outpatient gastrointestinal endoscopy, with particular reference to recovery profile, amnesic effects, and haemodynamic state and oxygenation during the procedure. Forty consecutive patients were allocated randomly to two groups. Patients in group I (n = 19) received midazolam 81 (SEM 32) micrograms kg-1; those in group II (n = 21) received propofol 950 (400) micrograms kg-1. Both agents were administered as single injections to similar end-points of sedation. Psychomotor function was assessed using the digit symbol substitution test (DSST). Amnesia was measured with a visual memory test and subjective questionnaire. Patients in group I had a lower DSST score than those in group II (P less than 0.01), indicating a hangover effect from midazolam. Amnesia was similar in the two groups up to the time of removal of the endoscope. More patients in group II remembered removal of the endoscope (P less than 0.001). Oxygen desaturation from baseline was similar in both groups (P less than 0.01). An increase in heart rate and decrease in mean arterial pressure were noted in both groups. Propofol provided more rapid recovery compared with midazolam, but was associated with pain on injection, a short amnesia span, and reduced patient acceptance.", 
    "61": "The systemic hemodynamic actions of isoflurane (a volatile anesthetic) and etomidate and midazolam (intravenous anesthetics) have been well documented. However, few studies have investigated the actions of these agents on central cardiovascular control sites. The present investigation examined the actions of these agents on the responses of systolic arterial pressure (SAP), heart rate, infrarenal aortic blood flow, and lower body vascular resistance to central nervous system pressor site stimulation in chronically instrumented cats. Male and female cats (n = 23) were chronically instrumented with bipolar stimulating electrodes in the regions of the ventrolateral hypothalamus (anterior, 10.0 mm; lateral, 2.5 mm; depth, -4.0 mm) and mesencephalic reticular formation (anterior, 2.0 mm; lateral, 2.0 mm; depth, -1.0 mm). Control experiments consisted of stimulation sequences at 1x, 2x, and 4x threshold current levels to elicit pressor responses. Stimulation of the hypothalamic site produced current-dependent increases in SAP (6-85 mm Hg), in heart rate (3-56 beats/min), and in infrarenal aortic blood flow (0-85 mL/min). Reticular formation site stimulation produced graded increases in SAP (6-129 mm Hg) only. Isoflurane (1.5%, 2.5%, and 3.0%), etomidate (3.0-mg/kg bolus and 0.4-mg.kg-1. h-1 infusion), and midazolam (7.5-mg/kg bolus and 0.2-mg.kg-1.h-1 infusion) were then administered in separate experimental groups. After a steady hemodynamic state was established with each agent, stimulation sequences were repeated. Isoflurane produced an attenuation of the responses of SAP (from 85.1 +/- 8.2 to 17.8 +/- 6.1 mm Hg at 1.5%, to 7.2 +/- 2.0 mm Hg at 2.5%, and to 4.7 +/- 2.0 mm Hg at 3%, all P less than 0.05), heart rate (from 41.1 +/- 13.0 to 12.5 +/- 2.7 beats/min at 2.5% and to 6.2 +/- 1.7 beats/min at 3%, all P less than 0.05), and of the infrarenal aortic blood flow (from 72.6 +/- 14.3 to 11.8 +/- 4.2 mL/min at 1.5%, to 10.2 +/- 5.6 mL/min at 2.5%, and to 3.2 +/- 1.5 mL/min at 3%, all P less than 0.05) to the highest level of hypothalamic site stimulation. Isoflurane similarly produced an attenuation of the SAP response (from 128.7 +/- 10.3 to 15.4 +/- 8.1 mm Hg at 1.5%, to 0.2 +/- 1.1 mm Hg at 2.5%, and to 0.3 +/- 0.5 mm Hg at 3.0%, all P less than 0.05) to the highest level of reticular formation site stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "62": "Clinical and metabolic responses to three types of premedication were studied in ASA physical status I patients given any one of the following: (a) 0.5 mg of atropine and 50 mg of meperidine given intramuscularly plus an oral placebo tablet (n = 14), (b) 10 mg of oral diazepam and an intramuscular placebo (2 mL NaCl, concentration = 0.9) (n = 14), or (c) oral and intramuscular placebo (n = 14). Based both on subjective estimates (tiredness, fear, anxiety, dryness of mouth) and, especially, on metabolic responses (energy expenditure, oxygen consumption), oral diazepam appears to be superior to the combination of an opiate (meperidine) plus an anticholinergic (atropine). Atropine plus meperidine significantly increased energy expenditure above predicted values (2061 +/- 365 vs 1714 +/- 361 kcal/24 h, P = 0.004), calculated using the Harris-Benedict equation, based on sex, weight, height, and age, as well as increased oxygen consumption above levels seen with diazepam premedication (160 +/- 29 vs 137 +/- 17 mL.min-1. m-2).

    "63": "Endocrine cells in the acid-secreting part of the avian stomach, the proventriculus, contain two forms of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) of 27 and 6 residues, respectively. We have examined the actions of exogenous GRP-27 and GRP-6 and endogenously released GRP in the control of pancreatic secretion in urethan-anesthetized turkeys. Chicken GRP-27 and the structurally related amphibian peptide bombesin were potent stimulants of fluid and protein output from the pancreas (at 6-100 pmol/kg, iv). GRP-6 had no significant effect at doses up to 1,000 times higher. A bombesin antagonist, (CH3)2-CHCO-[D-Ala24]GRP-20--26-NHCH3, inhibited the action of exogenous chicken GRP-27 but did not inhibit intravenous cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8). Distension of the proventriculus with a solution of peptone produced an increase in the flow of pancreatic juice and an increase in protein output, which was not reduced by atropine. The bombesin antagonist produced a reversible inhibition of this response. A CCK-gastrin antagonist, BOC-beta-Ala-Trp-Leu-Asp-O(CH2)2- phenyl(4F), which inhibited the action of exogenous CCK, had no effect on the pancreatic response to exogenous GRP-27 or to distension of the proventriculus with peptone. We suggest that protein-rich solutions in the proventriculus release GRP, which in turn acts directly on the pancreas to stimulate enzyme secretion.", 
    "64": "The object of this investigation was to illustrate patients understanding of the background for commencing and continuing or discontinuing, respectively, benzodiadiazepine medication with emphasis on attitudes, norms and values on which this medication is based. The quantitative research interview method was selected as the method employed here. Twenty-one patients participated. Ten of these continued medication. Nine patients had originally discontinued medication but had begun again for various reasons. Two patients had discontinued medication completely. Patients who employed benzodiazepines daily had only few trepidations about consumption of drugs while patients who only employed medication occasionally had a series of trepidations. Nevertheless, a considerable tendency to return to benzodiazepines under conditions of stress was observed. The justification for intake of benzodiazepines was frequently altered during the course of time. Considerable \"medicalization\" of non-medical problems was observed. The problems for which the patient was prescribed medication with benzodiazepines were frequently bio-psycho-social-extential problems. The majority of patients were, however, aware of this \"medicalization\". Benzodiazepines were not employed as euphoric agents.",

(5) A qualified nurse, trained in endoscopic techniques and adequately trained in resuscitation techniques, should monitor the patient's condition during procedures. (6) Before endoscopy, adverse risk factors should be identified. This may be aided by the use of a check list. (7) The dosage of all drugs should be kept to the minimum necessary. There is evidence that benzodiazepine/opioid mixtures are hazardous. (8) Specific antagonists for benzodiazepines and opioids exist and should be available in the event of emergency. (9) A cannula should be placed in a vein during endoscopy on 'at risk' patients. (10) Oxygen enriched air should be given to 'at risk' patients undergoing endoscopic procedures. (11) The endoscopist should ensure the well being and clinical observation of the patient undergoing endoscopy in conjunction with another individual. This individual should be a qualified nurse trained in endoscopic techniques or another medically qualified practitioner. (12) Monitoring techniques such as pulse oximetry are recommended. (13) Clinical monitoring of the patient must be continued into the recovery area. (14) Records of management and outcome should be collected and will provide data for appropriate audit.", 
    "66": "The influence of dosage time of midazolam on its pharmacokinetics and effects on the central nervous system were investigated in six healthy volunteers, with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. Each volunteer received single oral doses of 15 mg midazolam on four separate occasions: 8 AM, 2 PM, 8 PM, and 2 AM. An almost significant circadian variation was found in elimination half-life, shortest at 2 PM (1.26 +/- 0.47 hours, mean +/- SD) and longest at 2 AM (1.57 +/- 0.44 hours) (p = 0.05). Drug effects measured were alpha activity of the electroencepalograph and P100 latency of the visual-evoked response. The maximum drug effect (Emax) model described the concentration-effect relationship, extended with either a threshold drug concentration or a sigmoidicity parameter. A significant circadian variation was found in baseline alpha activity: highest at 8 AM (109% +/- 19% of the 24-hour mean) and lowest at 2 AM (80% +/- 12%). For alpha activity the drug concentration at half-maximum effect of both threshold Emax model and sigmoid Emax model showed lower values at 8 AM and 2 AM and higher values at 2 PM and 8 PM. However, these differences were either not significant (p = 0.10, threshold model) or on the verge of statistical significance (p = 0.05, sigmoid model). No circadian variation was found in the parameters describing the effect on the visual-evoked response. We conclude that the sensitivity of the central nervous system to midazolam, as reflected in alpha activity, possibly shows a circadian variation.", 
    "67": "Exposure to monomethylhydrazine (MMH), a common rocket propellant, can cause dose-related central nervous system (CNS) disturbances ranging from tremors to tonic-clonic convulsions to death. MMH inhibits gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis in the CNS. Diazepam (BZ) acts at the GABA receptor site, and it is also here that ivermectin (AVM) is pharmacologically active. Mice were injected with 30 mg/kg MMH. Groups of 12 mice each were then given varying doses of AVM (5, 10 and 15 mg/kg), or AVM + BZ combinations (5 mg/kg AVM with 5 mg/kg BZ, 10 mg/kg AVM with 5 mg/kg BZ). Time to first convulsion and time to death were recorded over the next 7 h and all groups were monitored over the next 7 days. Times to convulsion were not altered with AVM alone, but death was significantly prevented with AVM dosages. A treatment of 10 mg/kg AVM with 5 mg/kg BZ resulted in no seizures or deaths.", 
    "68": "We used data from the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy's computer-based management system to compare the rates of serious cardiorespiratory complications and death associated with the use of midazolam and diazepam. Data were analyzed from 21,011 procedures. Midazolam was used in 15,061 of these procedures, diazepam in 4,302, and neither in 1,648. We assessed benzodiazepine dose, concomitant drug administration, type of procedure, and selected patient characteristics in each of these three groups. No significant difference between these three groups were noted other than the fact that certain clinical centers tended to exclusively use midazolam, whereas others used both benzodiazepines. Reports of serious cardiorespiratory complications and death were uncommon, occurring in 5.4 and 0.3 per thousand procedures, respectively. Midazolam did not seem to place patients in this sample at greater risk for cardiorespiratory complications than diazepam. Concomitant use of narcotics and urgent and emergent procedures, however, did increase the risk of serious cardiorespiratory events.", 
    "69": "For a small subset of mentally handicapped individuals, the medical and dental setting can be so threatening that they react violently to health care providers. Deep sedation can be administered enterally using oral ketamine, 6-8 mg/kg, combined with glycopyrrolate mixed in simple syrup and preceded by a dose of an oral benzodiazepine and sodium citrate. A case utilizing this technique to sedate an extremely combative mentally handicapped female requiring dental treatment planning in an ambulatory surgical center is described. A review of this use of ketamine and caveats concerning its use are covered.", 
    "70": "The anticonvulsant profiles of two potent and orally active gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake inhibitors, 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-3-piperidine-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK&F 89976-A) and 1-(4,4-diphenyl-3-butenyl)-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridine-carboxylic acid hydrochloride (SK&F 100330-A), were determined with a battery of well-standardized tests in mice and rats and compared with the profiles of phenytoin (PHT), carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) when subjected to the same tests. ED50 values were calculated and compared with TD50 values for minimal motor impairment to provide protective indexes (PI = TD50/ED50). The anticonvulsant profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were similar and suggest that these compounds raise the threshold for seizure initiation rather than inhibit seizure spread. Like intraperitoneal (i.p.) PHT, CBZ, VPA, and CZP, SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A inhibited seizures in corneally kindled rats. The profiles of SK&F 89976-A and SK&F 100330-A were most similar to that of CZP and virtually opposite to that of PHT. Intraperitoneal SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures [subcutaneous (s.c.) PTZ] in mice but was ineffective against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 100330-A provided complete protection against picrotoxin-induced seizures (s.c. Pic) and against both clonus and forelimb tonic extension induced by NMDA N-methyl-D-aspartate [intracerebral ventricular (i.c.v.)-NMDA] in mice; however, SK&F 100330-A was ineffective against seizures induced by bicuculline (s.c. Bic) and strychnine (s.c. Strych) at doses slightly greater than its TD50. SK&F 89976-A was similar but provided partial protection against NMDA-induced clonus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "The effects of misoprostol and cimetidine on diazepam pharmacokinetics were evaluated in order to determine whether the kinetic variables for diazepam and nordiazepam alone differ with the repeated oral administration of misoprostol and cimetidine to healthy adult volunteers. The trial was conducted as an open crossover study in 12 normal subjects, divided into two groups with all subjects receiving both regimens. Total study duration was 5 weeks. An initial clinical assessment, including blood biochemistry and assessment of subject oxidation status was carried out on study day 1. On this day, subjects began taking diazepam (10 mg) orally for one week, with pharmacokinetic studies performed at day 8, when steady state levels of diazepam were reached. This was followed by one week with active drug, misoprostol to Group I and cimetidine to Group II, with pharmacokinetic studies performed at the end of a 1-week treatment. After a 2-week wash-out period, both groups took for one week, the alternate drug, i.e. cimetidine plus diazepam to Group I and misoprostol plus diazepam to Group II. On days 8, 15 and 36, subjects were admitted to the hospital for 12 h, during which time a clinical examination was carried out and blood samples were taken at time zero and at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 h post-dosing for the measurement of serum diazepam and nordiazepam. The main parameters measured and evaluated were diazepam and nordiazepam pharmacokinetics at steady state (days 8, 15 and 36). These were areas under the curve in the dose intervals (AUC0-24h), maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax), time to peak concentrations (Tmax), elimination half-life (t1/2), elimination constant (Kel), distribution volume (Vd), total body clearance (ClB) and clearance after oral administration (Cloral). The results demonstrated that plasma diazepam and nordiazepam concentrations had a significant increase after steady states have been reached with the simultaneous administration of 800 mg of cimetidine daily for one week. The simultaneous administration of 800 micrograms of misoprostol did not cause any significant change in diazepam and nordiazepam plasma levels after steady states had been reached. Comparing the pharmacokinetic parameters of Groups A and B as well as within groups on days 8, 15 and 36, a significant increase in plasma diazepam and nordiazepam levels was detected. This was due to a cimetidine-induced impairment in microsomal oxidation of diazepam and nordiazepam, which caused a decrease in total metabolic clearance and increased mean steady state plasma concentrations. A more prolonged half-life was observed for both groups taking cimetidine as well as an increase of mean maximum plasma concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "72": "In conscious, vagotomized, curarized, and artificially-ventilated rabbits, the efferent phrenic discharges were recorded. When scopolamine, atropine, pirenzepine or AF-DX 116 (11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H[2,3-6] [1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) was injected into the cerebello-medullary cistern, the frequency and voltage of phrenic discharges were decreased (P less than 0.05) by scopolamine (0.5 mg.kg-1) and pirenzepine (0.5 mg.kg-1), but were increased (P less than 0.01) by atropine (0.05 mg.kg-1) and AF-DX 116 (0.1 mg.kg-1). It is probable that scopolamine inhibits the respiratory center by blocking the M1 cholinergic receptors while atropine excites the respiratory center blocking the M2 cholinergic receptors.", 
    "73": "Medical emergencies in the dentist's office are a primary concern for dental surgeons. Since each individual therapist is personally responsible for the management of those eventualities, they must be properly trained to handle them. Prevention is still the most effective method for avoiding them, with clinical examination as the prime basis for their management. Some current factors that increase the possibility of office emergencies include: a raise in life expectancy rates, thus increasing the number of patients with chronic diseases; multiple and complex therapeutic regimes; patients under dialysis, immunosuppression, transplants, etc. Apart from proper training of the dental surgeon in managing medical emergencies, he must have adequate equipment for treating such events. This article aims to offer dentists a practical guide to emergency equipment, which must always be at his immediate disposal, as well as some practical guidelines for the use of drugs and some recommendations regarding the organization of such equipment.", 
    "74": "The excitatory amino acid antagonists, NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(F)quinoxaline) and GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine) that act on non-NMDA receptors, provide potent anticonvulsant protection against AMPA [RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)-induced seizures in Swiss mice and against sound-induced seizures in seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice. Maximal anticonvulsant protection is observed 5-30 min after the i.p. administration of NBQX and 5-15 min after the i.p. administration of GYKI 52466 in DBA/2 mice. The ED50 values for the protection against AMPA-induced seizures by NBQX (30 min, i.p.) and GYKI 52466 (15 min, i.p.) are 23.6 (11.6-48.0) and 18.5 (11.5-29.5) mumol/kg, respectively. The ED50 values at 15 min for the protection against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice are 31.3 (24.9-39.4) mumol/kg (NBQX, i.p.), 37.8 (21.2-67.4) mumol/kg (NBQX, i.v.) and 13.7 (11.5-16.5) mumol/kg (GYKI 52466, i.p.). In DBA/2 mice the therapeutic index (ratio of ED50 values for impaired rotarod performance and anticonvulsant action) is 6.6 for NBQX (15 and 30 min, i.p.) and 2.0 for GYKI 52466 (15 min, i.p.).", 
    "75": "Acute electrical stimulation of a specific area in the inferior collicular cortex produced bilateral collicular afterdischarge and symmetrical wild running seizures. However, generalized seizures induced by kindling the inferior collicular cortex did not alter the kindling rate in the contralateral side. Furthermore, after both sides of the inferior collicular cortex have been kindled unilateral electrolytic lesions did not alter the seizure initiation or generalization elicited from the contralateral side. Since GABAergic function has been implicated in inferior collicular seizures, potential seizure-induced changes were measured for the chloride channel ([35S]TBPS) and the benzodiazepine receptor ([3H]flunitrazepam). Prior kindling did not alter [35S]TBPS or [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the central nucleus or cortex of the inferior colliculus, the medial geniculate, or the deep prepiriform cortex. Thus, the permanent neural change that subserves seizure generalization from the inferior collicular cortex is unilateral, but this change is not reflected by altered binding characteristics of the GABAA receptor complex.", 
    "76": "There are a number of ways in which drugs might increase the risk of an elderly person falling. The most important of these are sedation, impaired balance and reaction time, hypotension and drug-induced Parkinson's disease. Demonstrating the association between drugs and falls has been difficult because of certain methodological problems. However, there is now strong evidence that the use of psychotropic drugs, with the possible exception of short-acting benzodiazepines and hypnotics, is associated with a clinically important increase in the risk of falling. This increased risk is present after controlling for confounding factors such as confusion and depression. The evidence linking other drug groups to an increased risk of falls is conflicting. Decreasing the risk of drug-induced falls requires both careful individual adjustment of therapy and also a public health programme to ensure safe drug prescribing for older people.", 
    "77": "The possibility of the inhibitory influence of one of the psychostimulators of sydnonimine derivatives OF 743 on stress--and ethanol-induced mucosal lesions was studied in rats. Large doses (15 mg/kg) OF 743, which induced both central, psychostimulator, peripheral, and vagolytic effects equally decrease stress- and ethanol-induced mucosal lesions. The smaller doses, which show only peripheral effects, largely inhibit ethanol-induced lesions. The degree of the inhibitory influence of OF 743 is comparable with the same atropine influence and considerably exceeds the degree of the inhibitory influence of pirenzepine.", 
    "78": "A series of 2-substituted 3-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)thiazolidin-4-ones were synthesized and evaluated for anticonvulsant activity in a genetic model of reflex epilepsy (sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice). The combination of preferred substituents in the 2-position coupled with the introduction of a mercapto group on the thiadiazole moiety led to a number of active compounds. The anticonvulsant activity of most derivatives is better than that of the clinically useful anticonvulsant sodium valproate and some of them appear to possess potencies in the same range as phenytoin and clobazam.", 
    "79": "By measuring the levels of two major metabolites of rat brain noradrenaline (NA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), we investigated the effects of anxiogenic beta-carboline FG 7142, an inverse agonist of benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, on brain noradrenergic activity of rats. Thirty min after treatment with FG 7142 (15 mg/kg IP), levels of both MHPG and DHPG in the hypothalamus, amygdala and thalamus, but not in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, significantly increased. These increases were significantly antagonized by pretreatment with BZD receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (15 mg/kg, IP). Sixty min after treatment with FG 7142 at the same dose, significant increases in both metabolite levels occurred in the hypothalamus, amygdala, thalamus and cerebral cortex, and increases in MHPG levels only were observed in the hippocampus. These increases were significantly blocked by pretreatment with alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (100 microgram/kg, IP). The present findings suggest that FG 7142 can produce increases in brain noradrenergic activity in specific brain regions by interacting with BZD receptors, and may support the hypothesis that hyperactivity of brain noradrenergic systems may be one neural mechanism in provocation of aversive emotional changes (anxiety, fear or panic).", 
    "80": "The behavioral and motivational effects of electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus (IC) were investigated. Electrical stimulations of either the dorsal part or ventral part of the IC both elicited wild running (WR). Nevertheless, the ventral part was found more sensitive than the dorsal part, as lower intensities were needed to elicit WR. Moreover, WR differed depending on the part of the IC stimulated. It stopped as soon as the stimulation was switched off when the ventral IC was stimulated, whereas it further persisted in a poststimulus WR when the dorsal IC was stimulated. This poststimulus WR was abolished by anticonvulsant drugs such as diazepam, phenytoin or sodium valproate. In an operant escape conditioning paradigm (switch-off test), only stimulation of the ventral IC readily sustained switch-off learning. Dorsal IC stimulations did not, possibly because of the poststimulus enduring effects of the stimulation, as evidenced by poststimulus WR. Indeed, the anticonvulsant drugs which abolished this poststimulus WR also permitted switch-off of dorsal IC stimulations. It is concluded that electrical stimulations of the IC (dorsal or ventral) elicit aversive effects and that WR elicited either by ventral or dorsal stimulation may represent the overt expression of these aversive effects.", 
    "81": "There are conflicting reports concerning whether flumazenil (Ro15-1788) can antagonize the central effects of ethanol and ethanol withdrawal reactions. C57BL/6J mice were treated chronically with an ethanol liquid diet. Control mice were pair fed an isocaloric diet containing no ethanol. These mice were injected with either Ro15-1788 (25 mg/kg) or vehicle immediately before, 14 h or 24 h before ethanol withdrawal. Under these conditions, no attenuation of the severity of handling-induced withdrawal seizures or of withdrawal hypothermia was observed in the ethanol-dependent mice injected with Ro15-1788. Likewise, there was no abolition or attenuation of tolerance to the ataxic effects (sleep time and horizontal dowel tests) and hypothermic effects of ethanol by Ro15-1788 when the mice were tested on day 3 of ethanol withdrawal. It is concluded that Ro15-1788 (25 mg/kg) has no effect on ethanol tolerance and dependence.", 
    "82": "There have been several reports that convulsions, although rare, occur in patients who received fluoroquinolones. In this study, conducted for the evaluation of the convulsant action of fluoroquinolones, the effect of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin on pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions were investigated in mice. Mice were pretreated intraperitoneally (IP) with saline, ofloxacin (20 or 80 mg/kg) or ciprofloxacin (20 or 80 mg/kg) 30 minutes before subcutaneous (SC) administration of pentylenetetrazol (40 or 60 mg/kg). In another experiment, diazepam (5 mg/kg) was injected (IP) in mice alone or in combination with ofloxacin (80 mg/kg) 30 minutes before pentylenetetrazol (40 mg/kg) administration (SC). In each experiment mice were observed over the following hour for the incidence and onset of clonic convulsions. Results showed that both doses of ofloxacin increased the incidence of clonic convulsions induced by 40 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol. This effect, however was only significant in the higher dose and inhibited by diazepam. On the other hand, a similar proconvulsant effect by ciprofloxacin could not be demonstrated.",

    "85": "The purpose of our study was to evaluate the hypothesis that much of the reported variability in the range of concentrations of plasma clonazepam (and also in the range of concentrations of its major metabolite, 7-aminoclonazepam) encountered in pediatric epilepsy patients is due to collection of samples at random times after dosing. High-performance liquid chromatographic analyses were performed on routinely ordered blood samples collected from chronically dosed outpatients during regular clinic visits. Thirty-six samples from 26 different children (age 0.25-19.6 years, mean 6.3 years) were analyzed. Specific dosing and sample collection times were obtained at the time of blood collection; demographic data were obtained from the clinic charts. A portion of the variation for both clonazepam and its major metabolite was accounted for by differences in daily dosage used. However, by accurate recording of dosage, administration times, and sample collection time, we graphically demonstrated that the majority of the variations in measured clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam concentrations was due to the time elapsed between the last dose and the time of sample collection. Thus, random sample collection times (especially during the drug distribution phase and following frequent dosing) may account, in part, for the poor correlation between plasma concentrations and reported anticonvulsant or toxic effects.", 
    "86": "The analysis of clobazam and its metabolite desmethylclobazam by high-performance liquid chromatography is described. After adding an internal standard 500 microliters of plasma is extracted under basic conditions into dichloroethane. The organic solvent is then evaporated to dryness and the residue reconstituted in 100 microliters of mobile phase prior to injecting an aliquot (30 microliters) onto a Hypersil 5 MOS column, which is eluted with acetonitrile/acetate buffer (pH 5.4) 40:60 vol/vol. The components are separated in approximately 12 min. Using this method, 15 micrograms L-1 of clobazam and 30 micrograms L-1 of desmethylclobazam can be detected. The method is suitable for the therapeutic monitoring of these two drugs in patient samples.", 
    "87": "Acute i.p. injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg) resulted in a moderate increase in the tail-flick latency in rats. Tolerance to this diazepam effect developed after 10 days of diazepam treatment (1 mg kg-1 day-1). The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-3505 only partially reversed the effect of diazepam on nociception. Naloxone (5 mg/kg i.p.) failed to affect the effect of diazepam on nociception, while the kappa antagonist MR 2266 fully antagonized the diazepam-induced increase of the tail-flick latency. Diazepam injected intracerebroventricularly (1, 5, 20 micrograms/rat) did not alter basal nociceptive threshold, however, diazepam injected intrathecally (20 micrograms/rat) prolonged the tail-flick latency. Furthermore, intracerebroventricular injection of muscimol partially antagonized the i.p. diazepam-induced increase of the tail-flick latency. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptor sites are partially involved in the effect of diazepam on nociception and indicate that an indirect kappa-opioid-receptor-mediated mechanism may be involved. The anatomical site of diazepam action on tail-flick latency seems to be at the spinal level. Descending axons to the spinal cord from brain areas reached by intracerebroventricular injection of muscimol seem to modulate the effect of diazepam effect on nociception."
