Controls (n = 34) received standard treatment (metoclopramide 10-20 mg i.v. or dixyracin 20 mg i.v.). The intensity and duration of nausea and vomiting were significantly lower and measures of quality of life higher for patients on the experimental ward during the three cycles that were studied. No significant changes in emesis were observed between the cycles. There was no correlation between emesis and any of the parameters of quality of life measured. The reliability and validity of nausea ratings are discussed and we suggest that an underreporting of nausea and vomiting might be common.", 
    "1": "Acute local myocardial ischaemia is associated with a decrease in baroreflex sensitivity while electrical instability (vulnerability) of ventricles increases. Co-administration of a benzodiazepine and a potent analgesic (analgosedation) has been found to raise both baroreflex sensitivity and ventricular fibrillation threshold. Pharmacological modulation of neurovegetative ionization of the heart in the early phase of ischaemia is a promising method for preventing sudden coronary death.", 
    "2": "Prenatal exposure to benzodiazepines (BDZ) can cause behavioral dysfunctions both in humans and in experimental animals. In addition, prolonged impairment of cellular immune functions is found in rats after low dose BDZ exposure (e.g., diazepam 1.25 mg/kg/day) during part of fetal life [gestational days (GD) 14-20]. Analysis of diazepam and its metabolites in maternal and fetal tissues revealed that in this rat model the drug is no longer present at birth, which excludes direct effects of diazepam during the postnatal period. The main target of BDZ in brain, the GABAA receptor complex, is structurally and functionally heterogeneous. Besides alpha- and beta-subunits, gamma 2- or gamma 3-subunit should be coexpressed for a fully functional BDZ response. Signals of mRNAs encoding for alpha 1, beta 2 and gamma 2 are detected in fetal rat spinal cord and lower brainstem by GD 14 and reach telencephalic regions in later fetal life, reminiscent of BDZ receptor ontogeny. Regional subunit distribution differs from the adult brain, one interesting feature being a preponderance of gamma 2 mRNA throughout fetal life. Since subunit composition influences the sensitivity to BDZ, these data suggest that prenatal effects of BDZ depend upon regional subunit compositions present at different developmental stages. The delayed depression of cellular immune responses in prenatally BDZ-exposed rat offspring during the first 2 postnatal months is accompanied by various changes in immune cell biology. Binding characteristics of the peripheral (omega 3) type BDZ receptor are altered until adulthood (8 weeks). Membranes of spleen cell preparations containing mainly lymphocytes exhibit a decrease of affinity for the peripheral ligand [3H]PK11195, splenic macrophage preparations a decrease of maximal binding capacity. Various defects in cytokine production by macrophages and T lymphocytes were observed: Mitogen-stimulated release of macrophage-derived tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and of the T cell-derived interleukin-2 (IL-2) was drastically reduced at 2 and 4 weeks of life and recovered in young adulthood, exhibiting the same time course of depression as lymphocyte proliferation in response to immune stimuli. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) release remained diminished until adulthood. In female offspring, additional alterations were found in splenic noradrenaline turnover after immune stimulation. The mechanisms underlying the breakdown of the cytokine network in prenatally diazepam-exposed offspring, and the long-term consequences are as yet unknown.", 
    "3": "3H-flunitrazepam binding was studied in membranes from different brain regions and from kidneys and adrenals of young (5-month old) and aged (22-month old) rats. Decreased benzodiazepine receptor density (by 33.7%) was observed only in the cerebellum of aged rats. The number of benzodiazepine receptors was significantly increased in the hypothalamus (by 44.1%). Specific 3H-flunitrazepam binding was also significantly increased in both kidney and adrenal membranes from old rats.", 
    "4": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analyses of three different series of benzodiazepine ligands, pyridodiindoles, and beta-carbolines, having inverse agonist/antagonist and agonist actions have been performed with a view to understanding their likely mode of action at the benzodiazepine-receptor (BzR). From this study, the in vitro radioligand displacement activities of substituted 7,12-dihydropyrido[3,2-b: 5,4-b']diindoles (Figure 1) were found to be significantly correlated with resonance effect of R-substituents, van der Waals volumes at positions-1 and -3, hydrophobic constant at position-2 and field effect at position-4 of X-substituents. For 3-substituted beta-carbolines, a similar analysis has established that R-substituents at position-3 of beta-carbolines (Figure 2) are involved in strong hydrophobic interaction with some hydrophobic pocket on the receptor. For the analogues of 6-(benzyloxy)-4-(methoxymethyl)-beta-carbolines-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Figure 3), however, the combined hydrophobicities of 6- and 4-substituents were shown to be important in determining ligand binding behaviour. The significant correlations so obtained are in agreement with the proposed models (Figures 4 and 5) of pharmacophores of inverse agonist/antagonist and of agonist sites at the BzR.", 
    "5": "The effect of beta-carboline (beta-CCE) on spontaneous motility and its development was studied in chick embryos between the 11th and 19th day of incubation. 1. Acutely administered beta-CCE (7.5 mg/kg e.w.) already induced significant activation of motility in 11-day-old embryos. From the 17th day of incubation activation acquired a paroxysmal character. 2. In spinal embryos (decapitated on the second day of incubation) there was no such activating effect, demonstrating that it is associated with supraspinal components of the CNS. 3. In chronic administration from the fourth day of incubation (1.55 +/- 0.24 mg/kg e.w./24h), beta-CCE led to reduced development of spontaneous motility. The effect was concentrated in the period between the fourth and eighth day of incubation. The chronic administration of beta-CCE augmented the activating effect of metrazol and weakened GABA-inhibition of spontaneous motility. 4. On the basis of their findings, the authors express the hypothesis that the benzodiazepine beta-CCE-sensitive component of the complex GABA receptor evidently already functions from the beginning of the second half of incubation of chick embryos.", 
    "6": "Dihydroergosine enhanced [3H]TBOB binding to the crude synaptosomal membranes prepared from the whole rat brain and human frontal cortex. Higher concentrations of the same drug inhibited [3H]TBOB binding in the preparations obtained from the whole mouse brain and bovine frontal cortex. Bicuculline-induced enhancement and GABA- or diazepam-induced inhibition of [3H]TBOB binding were similar in the four species examined. The results indicate that dihydroergosine modulates species-dependently GABA/benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "7": "Great progress has been made in the last 5 yr in demonstrating the presence of benzodiazepines (BDZs) in mammalian tissues, in beginning studies on the origin of these natural compounds, and in elucidating their possible biological roles. Many unanswered questions remain regarding the sources and biosynthetic pathways responsible for the presence of BDZs in brain and their different physiological and/or biochemical actions. This essay will focus on recent findings supporting that: (1) BDZs are of natural origin; (2) mammalian brain contains BDZs in concentrations ranging between 5 x 10(-10)-10(-8) M; (3) dietary source of BDZs might be a plausible explanation for their occurrence in animal tissues, including man; (4) the formation of BDZ-like molecules in brain is a possibility, experimentally supported; (5) BDZ-like molecules including diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam are elevated in hepatic encephalopathy; and (6) natural BDZs in the brain are involved in the modulation of memory processes. Future studies using the full range of biochemical, physiological, behavioral, and molecular biological techniques available to the neuroscientist will hopefully continue to yield exciting and new information concerning the biological roles that BDZs might play in the normal and pathological functioning of the brain.", 
    "8": "Two potent glutamate antagonists, NBQX and GYKI 52466, that act selectively on non-NMDA receptors, have been tested for anticonvulsant activity in 3 models of reflex epilepsy (sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and in genetically epilepsy-prone rats and photically-induced myoclonus in Papio papio) and in amygdala kindled rats. Both compounds potently but transiently suppress reflexly-induced epileptic responses. GYKI 52466 also reduces behavioral seizures and afterdischarge duration in amygdala kindled rats, but with a lower potency than it suppresses reflex epilepsy. These data are similar to earlier results with antagonists acting selectively on NMDA receptors; they do not support a specific involvement of enhanced AMPA receptor sensitivity as a major factor in the expression of kindled seizures.", 
    "9": "The density of omega 3 (peripheral type benzodiazepine) binding sites, a marker of reactive and tumoural cells, has been measured in different types of human brain tumours; omega 3 sites were quantified autoradiographically in sections from biopsy or autopsy specimens labelled with the specific radioligand 3H-PK 11195. Compared to normal brain parenchyma, up to 12-fold increase in omega 3 site densities were found in apparently viable areas of high grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma specimens, whereas more limited increases (2 to 3-fold) in this marker were observed in areas of necrosis. Low grade gliomas (astrocytomas) and meningiomas exhibited only moderate increases (2 to 3-fold) in this autoradiographic marker. Metastases of lung or kidney origin were characterized by greatly elevated (up to 20-fold) omega 3 site densities as compared to normal brain parenchyma. In every case, there was a good spatial correspondence between the histopathological limits of the tumour and the anatomical location of the increase in omega 3 site densities. These results suggest that omega 3 site densities in human brain tumours reflect their proliferative activity and point to a possible future usefulness of positron or gamma-ray emitting omega 3 site ligands for the clinical investigation and detection of human brain proliferative diseases.", 
    "10": "Immunological, neuroendocrine and psychological parameters were examined in 14 psychophysically healthy subjects and in 17 panic disorder patients before and after a 30-day course of alprazolam therapy. T lymphocyte proliferation in response to the mitogen phytohemagglutinin, lymphocyte beta-endorphin (beta-EP) concentrations, plasma ACTH, cortisol and beta-EP levels were examined in basal conditions and after corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Cortisol inhibition by dexamethasone (DST) and basal growth hormone (GH) and prolactin levels were also examined. Depression, state or trait anxiety, anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, simple and social phobias, severity and frequency of panic attacks were monitored by rating scales. The immune study did not reveal any significant difference between patients and controls, or any effect of alprazolam therapy. The hormonal data for the two groups were similar, except for higher than normal basal ACTH and GH plasma levels, lower than normal ratios between the ACTH and cortisol responses to CRH, and blunted DST in some patients. All the impairments improved after alprazolam therapy, in parallel with decreases in anxiety and in severity and frequency of panic attacks.", 
    "11": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) have been localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane in a variety of organs, where they apparently play a role in steroidogenesis, oxidative processes, and/or growth and development. Previous studies have demonstrated ontogenetic changes in heart and lung PBR, with maximal PBR density at 31 days, as opposed to negligible changes in brain PBR during the prenatal through postnatal periods. The present study was designed to examine the influence of maturation and aging upon PBR binding characteristics. Rats aged 1, 2, 12, 18, and 24 months were sacrificed, and the following organs were removed according to standard protocol: heart, lungs, kidneys, adrenal gland, and testes. Binding studies were performed using [3H]PK 11195 as a radioligand. A 3-fold increase in PBR density was demonstrated in testis during maturation, with maximal values appearing at 18 months, followed by a decline at 24 months. None of the other organs examined showed significant changes in PBR density. No alterations were observed in affinity values for the various organs and ages. Since testicular PBR are putatively involved in testosterone production, these results might reflect critical interactions between PBR and gonadal hormone activity during development.", 
    "12": "Intravenous administration of midazolam (2 mg/kg) to 8 pentobarbital-anesthetized cats produced a significant decrease in minute ventilation, tidal volume, blood pressure and heart rate. Treatment with the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 micrograms/side) at the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla (VSM) oblongata completely reversed the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of intravenous midazolam. In contrast, treatment with bicuculline at the same area failed to counteract the respiratory depressant effects of intravenous morphine (1 mg/kg). We conclude that the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of intravenously administered midazolam are due to enhancement of GABAergic transmission at the intermediate area of the VSM.", 
    "13": "The effect of intra-accumbens injections of drugs changing the function of GABA-A and GABA-B receptor systems on stressor-induced motor depression, was studied in rats. Local injections of picrotoxin and baclofen, but not of midazolam and muscimol, attenuated the inhibitory effect of inescapable footshock on locomotor activity in the open field test, examined 24 h after a single exposure of rats to the stressful event. The results obtained with picrotoxin may be related to the general disinhibitory properties of the convulsant on brain neuronal activity, in a period of time important for consolidation of central processes evoked by inescapable shock. The lack of effects of muscimol and midazolam, further underlines the minor and/or indirect role of accumbens GABA-A receptor-related innervation in the neural processes generated by stressful event. On the other hand, the results obtained with baclofen confirm the reports indicating an inverse relationship between the number of GABA-B receptors in the frontal cortex and the development of helpless behavior in rats. It is also noteworthy that most antidepressant drugs which have been shown to prevent or reverse behavioral deficits after inescapable shock, upregulate GABA-B receptors in the frontal cortex. Hence, it appears that GABA-B receptor-related systems within the nucleus accumbens, may contribute to the footshock-induced behavioral depression, including locomotor inhibition. The reduction of stress effect by baclofen does not seem to reflect changes in fear and anxiety, since the drug was given after the stress session, and the anxiolytic midazolam appeared to be ineffective in this test.", 
    "14": "Although benzodiazepines (BZs) have been the most widely used sedative/hypnotics for many years, the mechanism by which they induce sleep and the neuroanatomic site(s) at which they act have remained poorly understood. Recent characterization of the central BZ-GABAA receptor complex using molecular biological techniques and sleep studies employing new ligands have begun to elucidate these issues. Although alterations in GABAergic activity are involved in the anticonvulsant and myorelaxant properties of BZs, the significance of GABA function in their hypnotic effects is less clear. The pharmacologic significance of receptor subtypes also remains uncertain. A growing body of evidence indicates that the hypnotic effects of BZs involve alterations in potential-dependent calcium ion flux. In terms of neuroanatomy, BZ effects on sleep may result from actions in the anterior hypothalamus as well as brainstem structures including the dorsal raphe nuclei.", 
    "15": "The effects were ascertained of two partial inverse agonists at benzodiazepine receptors (beta-CCE and FG 7142) on the incidence of timid (defensive-escape), aggressive, sociable and locomotor activities in both timid and aggressive singly-housed male mice, treated with drugs in paired interactions with untreated non-aggressive males. FG 7142 (5 mg/kg) and beta-CCE (8 mg/kg) increased defenses and escapes without producing other behavioral changes in timid mice. FG 7142 (20 mg/kg) and beta-CCE (1-8 mg/kg) moderately increased defenses and alert postures in aggressive mice and this effect was associated with marked reduction of aggressive behavior. FG 7142 (20 and 80 mg/kg) also decreased walking across cage in aggressive mice. It is concluded that beta-CCE and FG 7142 produced behavioral changes which could be interpreted as \"anxiogenic\".", 
    "16": "Selective breeding for aggressive behavior alters GABA-dependent chloride uptake and behavioral response to benzodiazepine treatment. Pharmacological and biochemical studies examined subjects from three lines of adult male ICR mice selectively bred for either high levels or low levels of aggressive behavior, as well as unselected controls. Selective breeding produced two lines of behaviorally distinct males. During 5-min dyadic confrontations with an outbred stimulus animal, untreated low-aggressive mice spent more time in walking, rearing, and social interaction than untreated high-aggressive mice. The three lines also showed different responsiveness to the aggression increasing and decreasing effects as well as the sedative effects of benzodiazepine treatment. High doses of chlordiazepoxide (17, 30 mg/kg) reduced motor behaviors (walk, rear and groom) in the low-aggressive line without altering these behaviors in the high aggressive line. In the high-aggressive line, the same doses of chlordiazepoxide (17, 30 mg/kg) produced a behavioral shift; aggressive behaviors were reduced while social behaviors increased to levels similar to the untreated low-aggressive line. In contrast, only the unselected line pursued and threatened more after a low dose of chlordiazepoxide (3 mg/kg). The three lines also showed alterations at the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Specific uptake of [3H]Ro-15-1788 was increased in cerebral cortex, hypothalamus and hippocampus in the low-aggressive line, and was reduced in these areas in high-aggressive line when compared with unselected controls. Similarly, GABA-dependent chloride uptake in cortical synaptoneurosomes was augmented in low-aggressive mice and decreased in high-aggressive mice when compared to unselected controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "17": "Previous work (Thomas et al. 1990) showed that an anxiolytic benzodiazepine increased the time allocated to responding in a conflict situation (where responses were both food-reinforced and shock-punished) versus a nonpunishment situation. The present experiment tested whether a benzodiazepine-receptor inverse agonist (FG 7142, 1-30 mg/kg) would have the opposite effect (i.e., decrease time spent responding in a punishment situation). Chain pulls determined whether a rat's lever presses were reinforced on 1) a lean variable-interval schedule, or 2) a richer variable-interval schedule in which responding also produced shock intermittently. FG 7142 dose-dependently decreased nonpunished lever responding, but did not affect punished responding. The drug nonselectively decreased chain pulling (the schedule-switching response). Like chlordiazepoxide, FG 7142 increased the time spent in the punishment component, showing that not all effects of benzodiazepine-receptor agonists and inverse agonists are opposite. These results are inconsistent with expectations that anxiogenic actions of FG 7142 should 1) decrease punished responding; 2) increase the rate of responses that terminate the punishment condition; and 3) decrease time spent in the punishment component. Rather, nonsuppressed responding seems most sensitive to decreases by FG 7142.", 
    "18": "Ro 15-4513, a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor site was labelled with 11C and used for in vitro autoradiography on human post mortem brain sections and for positron emission tomography (PET) on Cynomolgus monkeys. The total radiochemical yield of [11C]Ro 15-4513 was 30-40% with an overall synthesis time of 40 min. The specific radioactivity was about 1000 Ci/mmol at end of synthesis. In vitro autoradiography showed that [11C]Ro 15-4513 bound specifically predominantly in the neocortex of the human brain. Specific binding was also demonstrated in the basal ganglia and the cerebellar cortex. Flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) and clonazepam inhibited the binding in cerebral regions, but a significant proportion in the cerebellum was not inhibited by these agents. This proportion may represent alpha 6-containing BZ receptors. PET examination of [11C]Ro 15-4513 binding in Cynomolgus monkeys demonstrated high uptake of radioactivity in neocortex. The uptake of radioactivity was markedly displaced by high doses of Ro 15-4513 or clonazepam. [11C]Ro 15-4513 should be a useful ligand to examine BZ receptor characteristics in the living human brain by PET.", 
    "19": "The effects of the organophosphorus anticholinesterase paraoxon on the binding of radioactive ligands to the M3 subtype of the muscarinic receptor and receptor-coupled synthesis of second messengers in intact rat submaxillary gland (SMG) cells were investigated. The binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) was most sensitive to atropine and the M3-specific antagonist 4-DAMP followed by pirenzepine and least sensitive to the cardioselective M2 antagonist AFDX116. This, and the binding characteristics of [3H]4-DAMP, confirmed that the muscarinic receptors in this preparation are of the M3 subtype. Activation of these muscarinic receptors by carbamylcholine (CBC) produced both stimulation of phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and inhibition of cAMP synthesis, suggesting that this receptor subtype couples to both effector systems. Paraoxon (100 microM) reduced Bmax of [3H]4-DAMP binding from 27 +/- 4 to 13 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein with nonsignificant change in affinity, suggesting noncompetitive inhibition of binding by paraoxon. Like the agonist CBC, paraoxon inhibited the forskolin-induced cAMP formation in SMG cells with an EC50 of 200 nM, but paraoxon was greater than 500 fold more potent than CBC. However, while the inhibition by CBC was counteracted by 2 microM atropine, that by paraoxon was unaffected by up to 100 microM atropine. It suggested that this effect of paraoxon was not via binding to the muscarinic receptor. Paraoxon did not affect beta-adrenoreceptor function in the preparation, since it did not affect the 10 microM isoproterenol-induced cAMP synthesis, which was inhibited totally by 10 microM propranolol and partially by CBC. Paraoxon had a small but significant effect on CBC-stimulated PI metabolism in the SMG cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The binding of 3H-muscimol and 3H-diazepam to rat striatum membranes after picrotoxin- and bicuculline-induced seizures was characterized. No alteration in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) of 3H-muscimol was observed. However, bicuculline produced a 27% decrease in Kd. Both picrotoxin and bicuculline increased the binding capacity of 3H-diazepam. Bicuculline produced a 86% increase in Kd. These results suggest that the GABA antagonists-induced seizures may modulate 3H-muscimol and 3H-diazepam binding in rat striatum.", 
    "21": "Sham-operated and pinealectomized male rats were maintained at 14 h light:10 h dark cycles (lights-on 5.00 h) and injected daily, for 14 days, with oxazepam or vehicle. 125I-melatonin binding was recorded in synaptosomes prepared at 10.00, 18.00, and 24.00 h from the hypothalamus, hippocampus and medulla-pons of the rats. In the sham-operated, vehicle treated rats, specific 125I-melatonin binding in all brain areas studied was higher at 18.00 h, whereas in the oxazepam-treated animals, binding was higher at 24.00 h than at the other times tested. In the pinealectomized, vehicle-treated rats, the binding recorded at 18.00 h in all three brain areas, was lower than at the other times of day tested. Oxazepam treatment decreased 125I-melatonin binding at 24.00 h in the hippocampus and medulla-pons of the pinealectomized rats and did not significantly affect the binding in the hypothalamus. These results indicate the ability of oxazepam, pinealectomy and their combination, to manipulate the diurnal variations in 125I-melatonin binding sites in the rat brain.", 
    "22": "The effect of orchiectomy on peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBZr) in the rabbit prostate was studied. The mean PBZr density in the mitochondrial fraction isolated from prostates of intact (non castrated) rabbits was 4066 fmol/mg protein which following castration increased to 7236 fmol/mg protein (p less than 0.005). The apparent dissociation constant (KD) of prostatic PBZr was higher in castrated rabbits (4.2 nM) than in intact animals (2.7 nM). These data suggest a role of androgen in the regulation of prostatic PBZr.", 
    "23": "Acute treatment with pentobarbital (PB), ethanol and flunitrazepam significantly decreased 3H-SCH 23390 binding in mouse striatum in a dose dependent manner. In contrast, no significant alterations in 3H-SCH 23390 binding in the cerebral cortex have been observed in mice treated with these sedative and hypnotic drugs. Flumazenil Ro15-1788) reversed the effect of flunitrazepam suggesting the reduction in dopamine D1 receptor binding in the striatum was mediated via GABA-Bz-Cl channel complex. Using kinetic analysis, it was found that such changes in dopamine D1 receptor binding in vivo were mainly due to changes in rates of ligand-receptor binding in vivo. Other non-site-specific drugs such as propanol and butanol also decreased 3H-SCH 23390 binding in vivo, depending on their lipophilicities. These results indicated that micro-environmental factors surrounding receptors, including cell membranes seem to have important roles in receptor binding in vivo. Both PB and flunitrazepam decreased muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding in mouse cortex, striatum, hippocampus and other regions. Together with the fact that PB also altered 3H-Ro15-1788 binding in vivo, this suggested global changes in microenvironmental factors may occur due to these sedative drugs. In vivo quantitative analysis of neuroreceptors with positron emission tomography (PET) seems to have some potencies to reveal the neurochemical base of benzodiazepine dependence.", 
    "24": "There has recently been a large increase in the number of new benzodiazepine receptor ligands, some with benzodiazepine structures, but many with other chemical structures. The pharmacological activities of these ligands have been interpreted on the basis of a continuum of efficacy ranging from full agonist through different degrees of partial agonism to antagonist and through partial to full inverse agonists. Inconsistencies with this hypothesis are considered in terms of alternative hypotheses, particularly the existence of functionally separable receptor subtypes. The potential of partial agonists as non-sedative anxiolytic agents with reduced potential of dependence and of weak partial inverse agonists as pro-cognitive agents is discussed. A pharmacophore for benzodiazepine receptors is proposed and supporting evidence presented.", 
    "25": "Critics often cite the use of illicit drugs among methadone maintenance patients as evidence of this treatment modality's failure. The fact that methadone maintenance treatment does not lead quickly to abstinence in most clients can be a disappointment to treatment professionals and the public. By studying a cohort of 41 patients for their first year in a methadone maintenance program, this study revealed significant trends of diminished narcotic and cocaine use. However, increased benzodiazepine use was also identified. More importantly, this study patterns of drug using that predicted less drug use at the end of one year of treatment. These findings reflect the need for additional research to clarify the meaning of illicit drug use by methadone maintenance patients. In addition, the implications for providing, stopping, and determining effective drug treatment are discussed.", 
    "26": "A new procedure for the preparation of the taurine receptor from mammalian brain is described. The taurine receptor thus prepared shows a Kd of 92 nM, Bmax of 6.0 pmol/mg protein and Hill coefficient of 0.90 suggesting a single site model for the binding of 3H-taurine to the receptor. The binding of 3H-taurine to the receptor is highly specific and is not affected by agonists and antagonists of other receptors such as glutamate, quisqualic acid, kainate and NMDA for the glutamate receptor; glycine and strychnine for the glycine receptor; FNZP for the benzodiazepine receptor; picrotoxin and bicuculline for the GABAB receptor. However, analogues of taurine (e.g., homotaurine and hypotaurine) are potent inhibitors inhibiting more than 50% of 3H-taurine binding at 0.1 microM. Taurine receptor binding is not significantly affected by monovalent cations (e.g., Na+, K+, Li+ and NH4+) at 1 mM or divalent cations (e.g., Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Mn2+) at 0.1 mM. However, the binding was completely abolished by Co2+, Zn2+ and Hg2+ at 0.1 mM, suggesting the presence of free sulfhydryl groups near or at the ligand binding site. Among the amino acids tested, cysteic acid was the most potent inhibitor, followed by beta-alanine, valine, tyrosine and cysteine inhibiting 3H-taurine to an extent of 84, 66, 63, 62, and 58% of 1 mM, respectively. Nucleotides and second messengers (e.g., ATP, ADP, cAMP, GTP, cGMP and diacyl glycerol) do not inhibit 3H-taurine binding significantly at 0.1 mM. From above studies, it seems that the taurine receptor is not up- or down-regulated by ions or second messengers at the taurine binding site. Whether the taurine receptor is coupled to a G-protein mediated second messenger system is currently under investigation.", 
    "27": "The classic benzodiazepines produce anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and myorelaxant effects at overlapping dose ranges. Efforts to reduce the sedative/myorelaxant component of this profile has a long history. Two rational approaches might theoretically lead to the desired drugs. One is based on the combination of partial (low efficacy) agonists of the benzodiazepine receptor with different receptor reserves in neurons subversing various functions. The other approach is based on the existence of GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor polymorphism and assumes that distinct receptor variants may be more prevalent on neurons involved in various CNS functions. Results are presented that were obtained with the partial agonist bretazenil and three other ligands in vitro as well as in vivo. Curves relating fractional receptor occupancy and various effects (potentiation of GABA-induced chloride flux, anticonvulsant, anticonflict and sedative effects) are fully consistent with the view that the particular profile of activity of bretazenil is the result of partial agonism. Comparison of fractional receptor occupancy required for the various effects of both full and partial agonists confirm earlier suggestions that receptor reserves for the individual effects differ with the same order. Clinical aspects of partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists are discussed on the basis of the preliminary information available to date.", 
    "28": "Flumazenil has been studied for antagonism of the residual sedative effect of midazolam administered as a complement of loco-regional anesthesias. Highly significant differences appeared between the patients receiving placebos and those receiving flumazenil, showing a quick suppression of the lasting sedative effects of midazolam. At the dosage of 1 mg, flumazenil seemed to have a more efficient and complete effect than the 0.5 mg dosage. Tolerance to flumazenil was excellent with the exception of one case of agitation and disorientation, in a patient chronic consumer of benzodiazepines thus this could be considered as a deprivation syndrome. In conclusion, flumazenil should certainly have a place in the pharmacological stores of the anesthesiologist.", 
    "29": "The effects of alpha,beta-methylene adenosine 5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-methylene ATP), 2-chloroadenosine and R-PIA (N6-(L-2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine) and their interaction with dipyridamole, indomethacin, 8-phenyl-theophylline, diazepam and other agonists of central or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors were studied on the guinea-pig isolated trachea. alpha,beta-methylene ATP exerted contractile effects on the guinea-pig isolated trachea; - log EC50 and E(max) values were 8.86 +/- 0.19 and 31.3 +/- 2.3 (n = 31) (% vs acetylcholine 10(-3) M) respectively. In comparison with other purinergic receptor agonists, the rank order of potency was: alpha,beta-methylene ATP greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-PIA. alpha,beta-methylene ATP and 2-chloroadenosine had significantly (P less than 0.05) greater efficacy (E(max)) than R-PIA. Indomethacin (3 x 10(-6) M) and 8-phenyltheophylline (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) significantly reduced the contractile effect of 2-chloroadenosine and R-PIA but did not affect alpha,beta-methylene ATP-induced contraction. Conversely, dipyridamole significantly reduced (10(-7) M) or suppressed (10(-6) M) the contractile effects of alpha,beta-methylene ATP whereas it only partially reduced (10(-6) M) the contractile effects of high concentrations of 2-chloroadenosine or R-PIA. Diazepam potentiated the efficacy of alpha,beta-methylene ATP. The E(max) (% vs acetylcholine 10(-3) M) values were 26.1 +/- 2.0 (n = 10) in control conditions and 45.9 +/- 4.6 (n = 5; P less than 0.05) in the presence of diazepam 10(-5) M. Diazepam did not modify the contractile effects of 2-chloroadenosine or R-PIA. Ro5-4864 (10(-7) to 10(-5) M), an agonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, potentiated the contractile effects of alpha,beta-methylene ATP to the same extent as diazepam. Clonazepam, an agonist of central benzodiazepine receptors, did not modify these effects. Antagonists of central (flumazenil) or peripheral (RP 52028) benzodiazepine receptors had no influence on the interaction between diazepam or Ro-4864 and alpha,beta-methylene ATP. In conclusion, alpha,beta-methylene ATP exerts on guinea-pig isolated trachea a contractile effect which is not modified by indomethacin and 8-phenyltheophylline, but is reduced by dipyridamole. It is suggested that this effect might involve P2 chi receptor stimulation.", 
    "30": "We have earlier presented data indicating that the anxiolytic-like effect obtained in rats after depletion of brain 5-HT by means of PCPA or 5,7-DHT treatment is indirect and appears to involve the GABAA/benzodiazepine chloride ionophore receptor complex (GABAA/BDZ-RC), and that it is abolished by adrenalectomy. In the present series of experiments we have therefore investigated the 36Cl(-)-uptake in rat synaptoneurosomal preparations of central cortices from 5,7-DHT- and SHAM-lesioned animals. The GABA as well as the 3 alpha,5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) induced picrotoxin-sensitive increase in 36Cl(-)-uptake was significantly lower than that observed in the SHAM-lesioned animals, indicating that the 5,7-DHT lesion has rendered the GABAA/BDZ-RC subsensitive to two of its tentative endogenous ligands. This effect of the 5,7-DHT lesion on the function on the GABAA/BDZ-RC was reversed by adrenalectomy, indicating that an intact adrenocortical function is required for the development of GABAA/BDZ-RC subsensitivity in 5,7-DHT-lesioned rats. A tentative conclusion of these findings is that the 5,7-DHT lesion induces an increase in release of GABA and/or barbiturate-like steroids and that this increase is reversed by adrenalectomy. The findings from these in vitro studies parallel those from our previous behavioral experiments and provide further support for the notion that a decreased serotonergic influence in the central nervous system may, possibly via the adrenocortical system, enhance the function of the GABAA/BDZ-RC.", 
    "31": "Nitrous oxide produces behavioral effects, the underlying mechanism of which is not known. In the mouse staircase test, exposure to nitrous oxide caused a reduction in rearing activity, an effect similar to that produced by benzodiazepines in this paradigm, when its opioid action on locomotion is blocked by naloxone. In this study, we tested whether effects of nitrous oxide might be mediated by benzodiazepine receptors, using chlordiazepoxide as a control. The abilities of nitrous oxide and chlordiazepoxide to reduce rearing were significantly attenuated in mice pretreated with the benzodiazepine receptor blocker flumazenil or rendered tolerant to benzodiazepines. These findings suggest an involvement of benzodiazepine receptors in mediation of certain behavioral effects of nitrous oxide.", 
    "32": "Acute alcohol administration to rats has in preliminary studies been reported to drastically increase the binding of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist [3H]flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) to central BZ receptors. In the present study the effect of acute alcohol ingestion on the disposition of [11C]flumazenil in the human brain and plasma was examined by positron emission tomography (PET) in four healthy volunteers. Neocortex, cerebellum and pons (reference region) were delineated using X-ray computerized tomography (CT). Alcohol did not increase either total radioactivity uptake or specific [11C]flumazenil binding in neocortex or cerebellum. However, alcohol had a small but significant effect on [11C]flumazenil in arterial blood. After alcohol the plasma radioactivity peak was higher, more narrow and occurred earlier than in the control experiments. The present experiments contradict the view that alcohol directly affects central BZ receptor binding in man. Thus the dramatic increase of flumazenil binding in rat brain reported previously could not be observed in the human brain.", 
    "33": "Quantitative receptor autoradiography was used to study the neuroanatomical distribution and effects of gonadal hormones on [3H] flunitrazepam binding in the male Japanese quail brain. In gonadally intact quail brains, [3H] flunitrazepam displayed a heterogeneous distribution, with elevated levels in the posterior brain regions such as the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale and stratum griseum centrale of the optic tectum. Lower values were observed in the anteriorly located brain sites such as the nucleus septalis (lateralis et medialis), the cortex dorsolateralis and the nucleus lateralis hypothalami. Castration affected [3H] flunitrazepam binding levels in brain areas known to contain gonadal steroid receptors as well as in some areas which were devoid of gonadal steroid receptors. Castration in fact, elevated [3H] flunitrazepam binding in the nucleus preopticus anterior and reduced binding levels in archistriatum dorsalis et ventralis and in the nucleus intercollicularis; all of these areas are known to have gonadal steroid receptors. In two regions which do not contain such receptors, namely the hyperstriatum ventrale and the cerebellum pars granularis, castration increased [3H] flunitrazepam binding. In order to determine whether the gonadal steroid effect is due to changes either in the number of binding sites (Bmax) and or affinity binding state (KD), saturation binding studies were carried out in some of the areas described above in brains of quail which were castrated or castrated and given replacement therapy with testosterone or estradiol for 2 weeks.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "1. The interaction of a new class of quinolone antimicrobials (new quinolones) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) with the GABAA receptor-Cl- channel complex was investigated in frog sensory neurones by use of the internal perfusion and 'concentration clamp' techniques. 2. The new quinolones and the NSAIDs (both 10(-6)-10(-5) M) had little effect on the GABA-induced chloride current (ICI) when applied separately. At a concentration of 10(-4) M the new quinolones, and to a lesser degree the NSAIDs, produced some suppression of the GABA response. 3. The co-administration of new quinolones and some NSAIDs (10(-6)-10(-14) M) resulted in a marked suppression of the GABA response. The size of this inhibition was dependent on the concentration of either the new quinolone or the NSAID tested. The inhibitory potency of new quinolones in combination with 4-biphenylacetic acid (BPAA) was in rank order norfloxacin (NFLX) much greater than enoxacin (ENX) greater than ciprofloxancin (CPFX) much greater than ofloxacin (OFLX), and that of NSAIDs in combination with ENX was BPAA much greater than indomethacin = ketoprofen greater than naproxen greater than ibuprofen greater than pranoprofen. Diclofenac, piroxicam and acetaminophen did not affect GABA responses in the presence of ENX. 4. In the presence of ENX or BPAA, there was a small shift to the right of the concentration-response curve for GABA without any effect on the maximum response. However, the co-administration of these drugs suppressed the maximum of the GABA concentration-response curve, indicating a non-competitive inhibition, for which no voltage-dependency was observed.5. Simultaneous administration of ENX and BPAA also suppressed pentobarbitone (PB)-gated Icl. On the other hand, both PB and phenobarbitone reversed the inhibition of GABA-induced Ic, by coadministration of ENX and BPAA.6. The effect on GABAA responses of co-administration of new quinolones and NSAIDs was not via an interaction with benzodiazepine receptors coupled to the GABAA receptor, since this effect was not reversed by Rol5-1788 or diazepam.7. It is concluded that the co-administration of new quinolones and some of the NSAIDs inhibit GABAergic transmission, and could result in convulsions.",

    "36": "Benzodiazepine receptor imaging was carried out in 10 patients interictally. To be eligible for this study the patients had to have a history of focal seizures and no evidence of routine imaging abnormalities as in CT or MR. The patients were selected on the basis of a regional decreased blood flow in HMPAO SPECT that correlated with the site of a stable unifocal EEG abnormality. Benzodiazepine receptor imaging was performed after intravenous administration of approximately 110 MBq 123-I-Iomazenil using SPECT.", 
    "37": "A regional reduced activity was found on sequential SPECT series after 30 and 90 min post injection in the receptor study. The brain region with a reduced receptor density was concordant to the pathologic finding in HMPAO SPECT in all patients.", 
    "38": "For the evaluation of patients with focal epilepsies lomazenil SPECT offers several advantages over HMPAO SPECT. Iomazenil binds specifically to the benzodiazepine receptor complex whereas the exact binding sites of HMPAO are still unknown. In contrast to HMPAO, lomazenil can be used for sequential SPECT examinations that may detect dynamic changes of the receptor complex. For the purpose of benzodiazepine receptor imaging, lomazenil is a suitable ligand in patients with focal epilepsies.", 
    "39": "Rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus properties of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist flumazenil using a conditioned taste aversion procedure. On drug trials, fluid-restricted rats were injected with flumazenil (32 mg/kg), given access to a 0.25% saccharin solution for 30 min, and injected with LiCl (1.8 mEq/kg IP). On saline trials, injections of saline bracketed the period of saccharin consumption. Acquisition of the discriminated taste aversion, as measured by differential effects on drinking between saline and drug trials, developed after only five pairings of flumazenil with the LiCl injections. Flumazenil did not alter saccharin consumption in unconditioned controls (N = 9) that never received LiCl. The discrimination was also measured by flumazenil's ability to reduce the preference for saccharin over tap water using two-bottle choice tests. Flumazenil demonstrated dose-dependent generalization upon decreasing the training dose as low as 1 mg/kg. Two other BZ receptor antagonists of different chemical structure, CGS 8216 and ZK 93426, substituted completely for the flumazenil stimulus. Partial generalization was exhibited to the partial inverse agonists FG 7142 and beta-CCE, while the full inverse agonists DMCM and PTZ failed to substitute for the flumazenil stimulus. The BZ receptor agonists diazepam and alprazolam failed to substitute for the flumazenil stimulus, although partial generalization was shown with CDP. The results suggest that the BZ receptor antagonist flumazenil may produce intrinsic discriminative stimulus effects that are independent from those of BZ receptor agonists or inverse agonists.", 
    "40": "Transformation of expectation phenomenon into the phenomenon of temporal regulation is usually achieved by the suppression of preliminary factors or by means of their physical modification. Our studies show that such transformation can be obtained in dogs using Kupalov paradigm with the presentation of additional stimuli. These stimuli strictly identical, from the physical point of view, to the signals which interrupt expectation are randomly introduced into the temporal limit. Absence of the reinforcement in response to the additional stimulus impels the animal to include temporal regulation in its behaviour, and an additional negative discriminative stimulus promotes an expression of active character of inhibition. These circumstances make our pattern closer to DRRD (differential reinforcement of response duration). In order to evaluate the merits of this procedure the influence was studied of anxiolytic (diazepam) and neuroleptic (closepine) on the stabilized reaction of experimental animals. The increase of responses duration by closepine and their shortening by diazepam as well as the influence of these pharmacological substances on the frequency of responses in dependence of dose, confirm the results of the previous studies of DRRD and DRL (differential reinforcement of low rate of responses) and prove differential sensitivity of our procedure to pharmacological substances.", 
    "41": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were differentially housed for 21 days immediately after weaning. Isolated animals showed a selective suppression of exploration of the light side of a two compartment box; spending significantly less time in the light, and making fewer transitions between the light and dark compartments compared to socially reared controls. However, both basal and GABA-stimulated [3H] flunitrazepam binding was unaltered in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum following social isolation. These results are discussed in relation to other studies on central benzodiazepine receptor changes following a variety of experimental stressors.", 
    "42": "Diazepam-induced EEG changes were analyzed both visually and by computer in epilepsy for localization of epileptogenic lesion. The results demonstrated that changes in beta spectral were diminished in 11/24 or 15/25 cases, but regionally increased in 3/24 or 3/25 patients overlying the epileptogenic lesion or area of EEG abnormalities. Diazepam-induced delta spectral power was usually increased (9/24), but occasionally focally reduced (3/24) over the lesion. The percentage of positive findings for localization was 38% with visual analysis and 46% with spectral analysis in beta spectral power, 38% in delta spectral power, and 67% with the analysis in combined beta with delta, and 83% with four independent tests. Spectral analysis was more sensitive than visual analysis, and it was a useful supplement to visual analysis, to general EEG evaluation, and to CT. Finally, the study emphasized that a localizing diagnosis to define the epileptogenic lesion should be based on the combination of a multitude of independent tests.", 
    "43": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system, may also be released from olivocochlear efferent nerves reaching the outer hair cells of the cochlea. In the present study the cell potential of isolated outer hair cells of the third and fourth turns of the guinea pig cochlea was measured with patch-clamp electrodes. GABA-receptor agonists and antagonists were applied extracellularly. The cell membrane hyperpolarized in a reversible manner with increasing concentrations of extracellular GABA. Half-maximal hyperpolarization (2 mV) was achieved with approximately 10(-7) M GABA. Desensitization was not observed. The hyperpolarizing effect of GABA was potentiated by the benzodiazepine clorazepate and was blocked by picrotoxin.", 
    "44": "Involvement of the neurotransmitters acetyl choline and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vestibular compensation has been suggested by electrophysiological and pharmacological experiments. In this investigation we used quantitative autoradiography to study the modification of muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors in each nucleus of the rat's vestibular nucleus complex. Tissues were examined 3, 14, 23 h and 3, 12, 37 and 90 days after unilateral surgical labyrinthectomies. The present results demonstrated a muscarinic receptor supersensitivity in the deafferented side in the superior vestibular nucleus 90 days after surgery. This increase was not large enough to support the cholinergic receptor supersensitivity hypothesis for vestibular compensation. The changes in the benzodiazepine receptors observed for a short time following surgery were reversed after a few days. These findings support a transient involvement of GABAergic pathways in vestibular compensation.", 
    "45": "A survey of admissions to Ontario's alcohol detoxication centers showed many admissions used alcohol in combination with other drugs, and a poor correspondence between self-reports and results of the urine analysis. The use of THC was more common among younger admissions with low urine alcohol levels. Benzodiazepine use was more common among referrals from hospitals, general practitioners, and those presenting with cuts and bruises.", 
    "46": "In young chicks submitted to acute stress by forced swimming there was a significant increase in the number of the measurable [3H]-flunitrazepam receptors in synaptosomal membranes from forebrain. In addition, low subsolubilizing concentrations of Triton X-100 caused a significant increase in the measurable [3H]-flunitrazepam receptor number in synaptosomal membranes from non-stressed chicks. However, this Triton X-100 stimulatory effect was not observed when tested in synaptosomal membranes from stressed chicks. In all cases the affinity remained unchanged. This result suggest that: (i) acute stress and Triton X-100 induce receptor recruitment by enhancing [3H]-flunitrazepam accessibility to a pool of receptors which is unmeasurable either before stress or in absence of detergent; (ii) neither recruitment types are additive and they involve receptors coming from the same nonmeasurable pool; (iii) stress induces a maximal recruitment of existing benzodiazepine receptors; (iiii) the pool of nonmeasurable receptors represents about a quarter of the total in control chicks. The recruitment at a short time of stress could be interpreted in terms involving internalization; recycling or modulation of receptors but not its biosynthesis or degradation.", 
    "47": "Because of its abundance in the brain, its ability to produce hyperpolarizing inhibition of almost all neurons, its association with benzodiazepines, and the discovery that many convulsants inhibited its synthesis, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has often appeared to be the key to epilepsy. Many assumed that \"primary\" or \"genetic\" epilepsy must be a disorder of GABA synapses and that GABA agonists would be universal anticonvulsants if permeability and drug metabolism were controlled. The GABA synthetic gene was a logical \"candidate gene\" for epilepsy. However, the GABA-deficiency theory of epilepsy is less convincing today. GABA agonists were found to intensify seizures in some rodent and human cases. Absence and other generalized seizures in humans often worsened when treated with GABA transaminase inhibitors such as gamma-vinyl-GABA. Surprisingly, the GABA transaminase inhibitors appear to be more useful in partial than in generalized epilepsies. Neuronal GABA uptake blockers are proconvulsant. GABA agonists aggravate seizures in several mutants, ranging from the photosensitive baboon to the genetically epilepsy-prone rat. How can this be understood? Muscimol injections into the pedunculopontine nucleus increase seizures due to systematically administered convulsants, while the receptor blocker bicuculline suppresses seizures after injection into several brain regions, including the striatum. The result of inhibiting inhibitory circuits is excitation. Studies with GABA uptake blockers and the GABAB agonist baclofen are presented in which their combined administration provoked seizures in rats. Baclofen was shown also to increase the incidence of seizures evoked by pentylenetetrazole without increasing seizures due to local injections of excitatory amino acids. Baclofen antagonized the myoclonic effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan in rats with serotonin lesions. Baclofen augments some seizures and inhibits others. Selective inhibition of a particular tract, whether GABAergic or not, may have convulsant or anticonvulsant effects, depending on its connections and the state of the organism. GABAA receptor stimulation is usually but not always anticonvulsant. GABAB receptor stimulation may facilitate absence seizures and related primary generalized seizures. GABAB receptors may be abnormal in some forms of nonfocal epilepsy seen in childhood. It is likely that mutations of GABA transporter and GABAA receptor genes will be found in humans but they will probably not be patients with \"pure epilepsy.\"", 
    "48": "We studied the effects of single (45 min) and repeated (ten daily 45-min sessions) microwave exposures (2450-MHz, 1 mW/cm2, average whole-body SAR of 0.6 W/kg, pulsed at 500 pps with pulse width of 2 microseconds) on the concentration and affinity of benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum of the rat. We used a receptor-binding assay with 3H-flunitrazepam as ligand. Immediately after a single exposure, an increase in the concentration of receptor was observed in the cerebral cortex, but no significant effect was observed in the hippocampus or cerebellum. No significant change in binding affinity of the receptors was observed in any of the brain-regions studied. In rats subjected to repeated exposures, no significant change in receptor concentration was found in the cerebral cortex immediately after the last exposure, which may indicate an adaptation to repeated exposures. Our data also show that handling and exposure procedures in our experiments did not significantly affect benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. Because benzodiazepine receptors in the brain are responsive to anxiety and stress, our data support the hypothesis that low-intensity microwave irradiation can be a source of stress.", 
    "49": "The present study shows that postnatal \"consistent\" handling (CH) of rats had long-lasting improving effects on coping with an stressful task (i.e. two-way active avoidance), and that such effects were partially prevented by acute Ro 15-1788 (antagonist of benzodiazepine receptor-BZR; 5 mg/kg) administration. Long-lasting detrimental effects in the same task were also observed in rats which received postnatal \"inconsistent\" handling (INCH), effects that were slightly increased by acute Ro 15-1788 treatment. Finally, Ro 15-1788 tended to increase avoidance acquisition in non-handled (NH) animals. The observed effects of Ro 15-1788 could be partially attributed to a differential modulation of the process of avoidance acquisition depending on postnatal treatments producing different levels of emotionality.", 
    "50": "We further investigated the effect of diazepam on the processing of spatial information in a water maze task. Diazepam significantly impaired the retention of spatial information in a group of rats trained to locate a hidden platform. In a free swim trial carried out after training, diazepam-treated rats showed no bias to the target quadrant. There was no effect of diazepam on retrieval of spatial information in well-trained rats, and diazepam was devoid of any effect on cue learning in the water maze. However, diazepam blocked latent place learning during cue training in the water maze. Our results indicate that the GABA-BZD receptor modulates spatial information processing and that diazepam specifically impairs the retention of spatial information without affecting retrieval or cue learning.", 
    "51": "Ligand binding to many transmitter receptors is much higher in layer Ia of rat posterior cingulate cortex than it is in other layers, and this is where most axons from the anterior thalamus terminate. The present study explores the possibility that a number of receptors may be expressed on axons from limbic thalamic nuclei that terminate in layer Ia. Unilateral thalamic lesions were placed in rats and, 2 weeks later, five ligand binding protocols, coverslip autoradiography, and single grain counting techniques were used to quantify binding in control and ablated hemispheres. Binding to the following receptor subtypes was analyzed: M2 acetylcholine, 3H-oxotremorine-M, or 3H-AF-DX 116 with 50 nM pirenzepine; serotonin1B, 125I-(-)-cyanopindolol with 30 microM isoproterenol; beta 2-adrenoceptors, 125I-(-)-cyanopindolol with 1 microM serotonin and 10 microM atenolol; mu-opioid, 3H-T[r-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol; neurotensin, 3H-neurotensin. Thalamic lesions reduced binding in two laminar patterns. In one pattern, there was a major reduction in binding in most superficial layers with that in layer Ia ranging from 50 to 70% for binding to M2 muscarinic and serotonin1B receptors. Binding to beta 2-adrenoceptors was also reduced in most superficial layers but to a lesser extent. In the second pattern, reductions were limited to layer I with losses in layer Ia of 20-30% for mu-opioid and neurotensin receptors. In no instance was layer Ia binding completely abolished (i.e., postlesion peaks remained). Since the transmitters for each of the five receptors analyzed in this study are not synthesized by anterior or laterodorsal thalamic neurons, these receptors are heteroreceptors. The greatest postlesion reduction in M2 binding was for AF-DX 116 and so most M2 heteroreceptors are of the \"cardiac\" subtype. Finally, the diverse population of heteroreceptors on limbic thalamic axons provides for presynaptic modulation by a wide range of transmitter systems and suggests that thalamocortical transmission may not be a simple, unmodulated event.", 
    "52": "Dry autoradiography was used to determine the distribution of GABAA binding sites in tiger salamander retina. High-affinity binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam [( 3H]-FNZ) was used to localize benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) and [3H]-muscimol was used to localize the GABAA recognition site. Specific [3H]-FNZ binding was present only in the inner retina, primarily in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Co-incubation with GABA enhanced [3H]-FNZ binding by 20-50%. [3H]-muscimol binding was found throughout the IPL and in the outer plexiform layer (OPL). Mouse monoclonal antibodies 62-3G1 and BD-17, that recognize the GABAA beta 2, beta 3 polypeptides, and BD-24, that recognizes the GABAA alpha 1 polypeptide, did not label either the OPL or IPL, despite numerous variations in the fixation and immunoprocessing methods. GABAA receptor location, as revealed by [3H]-muscimol binding, matches the distribution of presumed GABAergic terminals in the OPL and IPL. We suggest that there are at least two subtypes of GABAA receptor in the tiger salamander retina: one type is present only in the inner retina, primarily in the IPL and is functionally coupled to BZRs; the other type is located in the OPL and is not coupled to the BZRs. Furthermore, GABAA receptors in the tiger salamander retina appear to be of a different epitope than GABAA receptors in numerous other preparations that are recognized by mAbs 62-3G1, BD-17, and BD-24.", 
    "53": "To investigate preliminary reports that benzodiazepine-induced sedation may be reversed by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), we examined the effect of TRH or saline placebo on two variables which are sensitive to benzodiazepine agonists: changes in sedation and saccadic eye movements. Lorazepam 10 micrograms/kg i.v. increased self-ratings of sedation and reduced self-ratings of alertness and these changes were almost completely reversed by TRH. In contrast the slowing of saccadic eye movements by lorazepam was not reversed by TRH. The effects of TRH do not appear to be due to a direct antagonism at the benzodiazepine receptor, since flumazenil reverses changes in both variables. Moreover ligand binding studies reveal that TRH has very low affinity at this receptor. These clinical data provide the first demonstration that it is possible to distinguish between the effects of benzodiazepines on saccadic eye movements and psychological self-ratings.", 
    "54": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam and antagonist flumazenil was quantified in vivo in rats, using effect parameters derived from aperiodic EEG analysis. The benzodiazepine-induced increase in amplitudes in the 11.5 to 30 Hz (beta) frequency band of the EEG was used as effect measure. A competitive interaction model was derived that could describe and predict the time course of EEG effect after administration of several combinations of midazolam and flumazenil. Two approaches to derive the interaction model were evaluated. In a first experiment, rats received 10 or 20 mg/kg midazolam i.v. in 15 min during a steady-state infusion of flumazenil at a rate of 0, 0.25, 0.5 or 1 mg/kg/hr. The EEG was continuously measured and frequent blood samples were taken to determine the pharmacokinetics of the drugs. Flumazenil did not influence the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, but a significant reduction in the clearance of flumazenil was observed in the presence of midazolam. Flumazenil did not possess any intrinsic efficacy with regard to the EEG effect measure. With increasing flumazenil concentrations, a parallel shift in the concentration-EEG effect relationship of midazolam was observed, confirming the competitive nature of the interaction. An agonist-antagonist interaction model was used to quantify the interaction, yielding the pharmacodynamic parameters of midazolam [(mean +/- S.E.): Emax = 80 +/- 5 microV/sec, EC50 = 35 +/- 3 ng/ml and N = 1.1 +/- 0.2] and flumazenil: EC50 = 24 +/- 2 ng/ml and N = 1.6 +/- 0.1.

    "55": "The kappa opioid agonists U50,488, bremazocine, ethylketazocine and tifluadom and the opioid antagonist naltrexone were examined alone and in combination with morphine in a squirrel monkey shock titration procedure, before and during chronic morphine administration. Before chronic morphine administration (prechronic phase), all opioids except naltrexone produced dose-dependent increases in median shock level when administered alone. When combined with a dose of morphine that increased median shock level to 90% of maximum (ED90), naltrexone, U50,488 and bremazocine completely antagonized the effects of morphine in most monkeys, whereas ethylketazocine and tifluadom partially antagonized the effects of this dose of morphine. After 10 weeks of daily morphine administration (chronic phase), the average ED90 for morphine was increased 1 log unit. In contrast, average ED50 values for U50,488, bremazocine and tifluadom were decreaed 1/4 to 1/2 log unit, whereas the average ED50 for ethylketazocine did not change from the prechronic to chronic phases. When combined with morphine during the chronic phase, naltrexone completely antagonized the effects of the morphine ED90 at approximately the same doses as during the prechronic phase. In contrast, antagonist activity decreased for U50,488 and bremazocine, increased for ethylketazocine and did not change consistently for tifluadom, compared with the prechronic phase. The present study demonstrates that chronic morphine administration alters both the agonist and antagonist activity of kappa opioids. Changes in antagonist activity of kappa opioids after chronic morphine administration may be explained by concurrent changes in their agonist potency and the extent to which their agonist effects are mu-mediated.", 
    "56": "The present study was conducted to evaluate the agonist and antagonist properties of kappa opioids in the squirrel monkey shock titration procedure. The opioid antagonist naltrexone, the kappa agonists U50,488, bremazocine, ethylketazocine and tifluadom, and the mu agonist l-methadone were administered alone and in combination with a single dose of the mu agonist morphine. When administered alone, all opioids except naltrexone produced dose-dependent increases in median shock level (the intensity below which monkeys maintained shock 50% of the time). In addition, all kappa agonists produced increases in urine output, whereas naltrexone and l-methadone did not. When combined with morphine, naltrexone and all kappa agonists antagonized, at least partially, morphine-induced increases in median shock level, whereas l-methadone did not. Naltrexone and the four kappa agonists also shifted an l-methadone dose-effect curve rightward in a parallel manner; however, the shifts produced by naltrexone were greater in magnitude than those produced by the kappa agonists. These studies demonstrate that a variety of kappa agonists can act as mu antagonists in a primate model of analgesia, although antagonist activity of kappa opioids appears to be limited by their agonist activity in this procedure. Order of potency among the kappa agonists for analgesic, diuretic and antagonist effects was very similar (bremazocine greater than ethylketazocine greater than tifluadom greater than or equal to U50,488), as was the dose range for peak diuretic and antagonist effects, suggesting that mu antagonism among kappa agonists may be kappa-mediated in the squirrel monkey.",

Anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies were found to immunoprecipitate specifically in parallel [3H]flunitrazepam- and [3H]muscimol-reversible binding sites in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum percentages of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of bovine cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus were 68, 77, and 83%, respectively. Immunoprecipitation studies with anti-alpha 1 324-341 antibodies carried out in parallel with anti-gamma 2 1-15 Cys antibodies provided evidence for the promiscuity of the gamma 2 subunit within native GABAA receptors. These results substantiate the association of the gamma 2 polypeptide with native GABAA receptors.", 
    "58": "The presence of benzodiazepine binding sites in rat vas deferens was detected using [3H]Ro 5-4864 as a radioligand. The binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864 to the mitochondrial sites is saturable, reversible, and temperature and time dependent. The association rate constant (k1) was 8.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(7) M-1 min-1, and the dissociation rate constant (k-1) was 0.031 +/- 0.003 min-1. The dissociation constant (KD) determined by saturation binding was 5.22 +/- 0.56 nM. The density of binding was 4,926 +/- 565 fmol/mg of protein. The Hill coefficient of binding was 0.99 +/- 0.01, an indication that [3H]Ro 5-4864 binds to a single site. The [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding was inhibited competitively by Ro 5-4864 and 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl-6-thioguanosine and noncompetitively by PK 11195, nitrendipine, alpha,beta-methylene-ATP, and carboxyatractyloside and was not affected by clonazepam, dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, or protoporphyrin IX. Our data indicate that [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding sites are not identical to those labeled by PK 11195. These binding sites are modulated by the ADP/ATP mitochondrial carrier, and an interaction of dihydropyridines and [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding sites in rat vas deferens is suggested.", 
    "59": "A continuous infusion of propofol following an induction dose of 2 mg/kg was compared with thiopental/isoflurane for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia in 20 mentally retarded outpatients undergoing routine dental procedures. The infusion rate of propofol and the concentration of isoflurane were adjusted to maintain the heart rate and blood pressure within +/- 25% of the baseline values. Postoperative wakefulness was assessed using a 100-mm visual analogue scale at the time of extubation and at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after extubation. Both agents provided adequate anesthesia for the treatment, and no major adverse reactions occurred. Recovery was more complete during the first hour after extubation in the propofol group, and these patients were discharged earlier.", 
    "60": "Geriatric patients who undergo intravenous sedation require careful intraoperative management, because respiratory and circulatory depression usually accompanies the administration of recommended adult sedative doses. This study examined results when a single benzodiazepine, diazepam or flunitrazepam, was carefully titrated to a clinical endpoint of conscious sedation. A total of 335 cases was divided into seven age groups. Mean sedative doses gradually decreased with age. The 60- to 69-yr group required about 75% of the adult recommended dose, the 70- to 79-yr group required 40% to 60%, and the 80- to 89-yr group required 30% to 45%. Pulse oximetry values also declined with age; respiratory depression was observed mainly in elderly patients. Declines in blood pressure after benzodiazepine administration were not correlated with age. The rise in blood pressure normally observed intraoperatively was suppressed both in young as well as old patients. We conclude that intravenous conscious sedation in elderly patients reduces stress-induced cardiovascular stimulation and that respiratory depression may occur at even low sedative doses.", 
    "61": "The administration of succinylcholine causes an increase in serum potassium (K+) concentrations in healthy patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate serum K+ changes following intravenous succinylcholine in children and to evaluate the effect of rectal midazolam pretreatment on these changes. Forty healthy children between the ages of 2 and 7 yr, and who were to undergo oral surgical procedures under general anesthesia were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (saline) or 0.25, 0.35, or 0.45 mg/kg midazolam administered rectally as premedication 30 min before induction of inhalational anesthesia. Blood was drawn after induction with enflurane and at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 min after administration of 1 mg/kg succinylcholine to determine changes in serum K+. Although the results indicate a significant increase in serum K+ after succinylcholine in all groups, midazolam pretreatment failed to cause any observable attenuation in the hyperkalemic response.", 
    "62": "The administration of intravenous agents is the most commonly used method in Canada and the United States to produce sedation or general anesthesia for dental procedures. Ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, has several advantageous physical, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic properties. It can be used to induce anesthesia, sedation, analgesia, and amnesia. Ketamine can maintain functional residual capacity, induce bronchodilation, and avoid cardiovascular depression. However, adverse effects have been demonstrated, such as cardiovascular stimulation and unpleasant emergence phenomena, both of which may be modulated by supplementation with benzodiazepines. An increase in the use of ketamine for ambulatory anesthesia has recently been advocated. This review of the literature supports the use of ketamine as an effective agent for selected anesthetic procedures.", 
    "63": "The presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and peripheral and central benzodiazepine receptors in the mammalian pineal gland prompted the examination of GABAergic transmission in dispersed bovine pineal cells. The effect of GABA on 3H-serotonin (5HT) release was examined in bovine pineal cells. GABA, by acting through GABA B receptor subtype, decreased 5HT release and by acting through GABA B, and presumably through GABA A receptor subtypes, inhibited depolarization-induced 45Ca2+ uptake in bovine pinealocytes. GABA, by acting on GABA B as well as on GABA A receptors, prevented the 5HT2- or 5HT1C-mediated stimulatory effect of serotonergic agonists on calcium uptake in pineal cells. GABA augmented 36Cl- uptake by bovine pineal cells. These results are interpreted to indicate that, by regulating the release of 5HT, GABA may modulate the synthesis and action of melatonin.", 
    "64": "The effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg i.v.) on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were investigated in rats in acute experiments. Generally an increase of the peak-latencies and a reduction of the amplitudes were observed immediately after diazepam (DZP) administration. An account was given of the differences in the DZP effect on SEP when the drug was applied at two different periods of day. The late cortical components were affected in both day and night, whereas the early and intermediate potentials were influenced by DZP only during the light period of day. The late N17 proved to be more sensitive to DZP in the night recordings. Our results suggest that the DZP effect on SEP in daylight conditions is more pronounced than that at night. The possible mechanisms responsible for this difference were discussed.", 
    "65": "In the years from 1989 to 1991 HSG examination was carried out in 502 infertile women. Two hours before the examination 5 mg of diazepam and 5 mg of fenoterol were orally administered, and 30 minutes prior to the procedure 2.5 mg of metamizole were given intramuscularly. The examined population of women was found to have normal patency of oviducts in 412 (82.07%) women, 48 (9.56%) had uni- or bilateral impatency of abdominal openings, in 16 (3.19%) there was uni- and in 19 (3.78%) bilateral +impatency of oviducts in uterine segments, while in 7 (1.39%) alternating impatency was disclosed. Of 502 women in 109 patients laparoscopy and chromotubation were performed during a period from 2 to 16 months after HSG examinations. In 30 (93.7%) out of 32 women with impatency of oviducts in the proximal segment, the diagnosis was confirmed. The administered drugs effectively prevent uterine-tubal spasms occurring at the time HSG is being accomplished.", 
    "66": "The electron structural analogs nicomorpholine and azethylnicotinate possessing a high anticonvulsant activity in experiment were synthesized on the basis of nicotinamide. The new substances antagonized the convulsant effect of corasole in the doses less by a factor of 10 than nicotinamide, with the therapeutic protective index of the test agents being 3-4 times higher than that of nicotinamide and being equal to the index of phenobarbital and diazepam. Analysis of the anticonvulsive activity with the aid of pro- and anticonvulsants disclosed that nicotinamide and its analogs are more effective in relation to bikukullin, thiosemicarbazide and picrotoxin than to corasole. Nicomorpholine like nicotinamide is capable of suppressing the epileptic foci in various zones of the cerebral cortex. The data obtained evidence that the spectrum of the activity of nicotinamide and its analogs differ from that of the classic anticonvulsants and antiepileptic drugs of the diphenin and phenobarbital series, resembling, to a greater degree, benzodiazepine tranquilizers with the predominant influence on the GABA-ergic system.", 
    "67": "The effect of two anticholinergic drugs, Ipratropium bromide, nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist and Pirenzepine, a selective M1 receptor blocker on bronchospasm induced by metacholine and histamine was investigated. The studies were carried out in a group of 52 asthmatic patients. The provocation tests were made by the Ryan method using a De Vilbiss nebuliser connected to a Rosenthal-French dosimeter. It was shown that both drugs protect significantly metacholine induced bronchospasm, but Ipratropium was more effective than Pirenzepine, which suggest that blockade of the M1 receptors only is not sufficient for a complete limitation of bronchi response to metacholine challenge. After histamine provocation some limitation of bronchial reactivity by two investigated drugs was also observed, but not so marked as after metacholine provocation. No significant differences between the effects of Pirenzepine and Ipratropium on histamine induced bronchospasm were observed.", 
    "68": "Midazolam is a water-soluble benzodiazepine with low toxicity. It has anxiolytic and sedative effects. This study assessed the efficacy and tolerance of this drug for sedation in various ward procedures. Pethidine was added to bone marrow aspirations for analgesia. 57 children with the mean age of 48 months and mean weight of 15.7 kilograms were studied. The dose of midazolam used to sedate adequately 86% of the children was 0.73mg/kg, the average onset of sedation was 4.3 minutes and mean duration was about 88 minutes. 47.5% were completely sedated, whereas 38.5% were only partially sedated. In 14%, sedation was not achieved at all. There was a statistically significant drop in blood pressure after sedation but this was not associated with any clinical effects. Hypoventilation was not detected in this study.", 
    "69": "There is evidence for two types of sleep spindle activity, one with a frequency of about 12 cycles/s (cps) and the other of about 14 cps. Visual examination indicates that both spindle types occur independently, whereby the 12-cps spindles are more pronounced in the frontal and the 14-cps spindles in the parietal region. The purpose of this paper is to provide more information about the exact topography of these patterns. First the occurrence of distinct signals in anterior and posterior brain regions was verified using pattern recognition techniques based on matched filtering. Thus the existence of two distinct sources of activity located in the frontal and parietal region of the brain, respectively, was demonstrated using EEG frequency mapping. Evaluation of sleep recordings showed high stability both in the frequency and location of the presumed spindle generators across sleep. Pharmacological effects of lormetazepam and zopiclone on both spindle types were investigated. Both substances enhanced the sleep spindle activity recorded from the frontal and parietal electrodes, but this increase was more pronounced in the parietal brain region.", 
    "70": "Drug-induced changes in cognitive functions such as memory are generally domain specific rather than general effects, that is, only some components of memory are altered. Changes in memory can be secondary to alterations in other cognitive domains such as attention, or non-cognitive domains (mood and arousal), or the direct result of alterations on those neurobiological systems that determine memory functions. The selective memory impairing effects of benzodiazepines are used to illustrate how cognitive neuroscience methods and theory can be useful in assessing the memory changes produced by psychoactive drugs.", 
    "71": "The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of bile flow impairment on hepatic lorazepam detoxication and its relationship with the liver microsomal membrane phospholipid composition. It was observed a decrease of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin content and an increase of phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylglycerol. A similar activity on lorazepam detoxication was observed when cholestatic rats were compared to controls. These results suggest that there is a different modulation than the phospholipid environment play the key role in lorazepam metabolism, independently of membrane.", 
    "72": "Effects of a single dose of the anxiolytic buspirone (15 mg) on memory and psychomotor performance were studied in healthy volunteers and compared to those of the classic benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (15 mg). The study was performed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled way. Three groups of 12 subjects were exposed to an extended test battery before and after intake of drug or placebo. Next to this, an evaluation session took place 1 week later. Immediately after intake, diazepam exerted major effects on memory, impaired psychomotor performance and decreased alertness. In particular, long-term memory had deteriorated, which was interpreted as anterograde amnesia. One week later, more items were recalled from the predrug session compared to the number of items from the postdrug session; this was interpreted as retrograde facilitation. After intake of buspirone, there were no effects of alertness and vigilance, on psychomotor performance and on memory. One week later, a small memory decrement was noticed for verbal material, which was considered as a sign of anterograde amnesia. These results indicate that effects of anxiolytics on memory can be more easily demonstrated 1 week later than immediately after drug intake and, furthermore, that the disruptive effects of diazepam outweight the small effects of buspirone. Finally, it was established that the effects of diazepam on cognition might be mediated by its effects on alertness and vigilance and that cognitive effects are not related to the anxiolytic properties of the drug.", 
    "73": "This case examined the efficacy of buspirone therapy as a reductive technique for severe treatment resistant paramenstrual aggression.", 
    "74": "Aggressive outbursts of an institutionalized mentally retarded adult were analyzed and correlated with menstrual cycling. Behavior was closely monitored, and after ineffective trials of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and beta blockers, a trial of buspirone was initiated.", 
    "75": "Buspirone therapy resulted in a marked decrease in aggressive incidences, and substantial increases in desirable behaviors. As a result of the subjects improvement, doses of concurrent psychotropic medications were reduced or discontinued altogether.", 
    "76": "The authors conclude that buspirone is an effective pharmacotherapy for paramenstrual aggression in the developmentally disabled, and encourage similar experimentation when behavior seems to be otherwise untreatable.", 
    "77": "Benzodiazepines are drugs with a good tolerance that are widely used for the treatment of anxiety. Extrapyramidal side-effects are unusual. Diazepam is effective for the treatment of drug-induced dystonias, nevertheless there are some reports of Diazepam-induced dystonia. We report a case history of a patient who developed oromandibular dystonia after taking Bromazepam. The possible mechanisms that cause drug-induced dystonia are described.", 
    "78": "The convulsant effects of four doses of picrotoxin (PX)-2, 3, 4, and 6 mg/kg s.c.-were evaluated in the first part of the study. The 4-mg/kg dose, which elicited minimal seizures in all animals, generalized tonic-clonic (major) seizures in 75% of rats and fatal outcome in 69% of rats, was chosen for the second part, i.e. for testing the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam (Rivotril Roche, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg i.p.). Clonazepam exhibited a dose-dependent action against PX-induced seizures, being more efficient against major than against minimal seizures.", 
    "79": "Effect of phenobarbital (PhB, 20 and/or 40 mg/kg) on epileptic ECoG phenomena induced by metrazol was studied in acute experiments in rats aged 7, 12, 18, 25 and 90 days. Fractionated administration of metrazol (20 mg/kg i.p. each 300 s) was used to quantify the effects of PhB. First signs of metrazol action (sharp elements and/or rhythmic metrazol activity) were not reliably influenced by PhB. On the contrary, the latency of the first EEG seizures as well as of the first generalized EEG seizures was prolonged and thus a dose necessary for their elicitation was increased in all age groups. These differences reached statistical significance in 12-, 18- and 25-day-old rats. A lack of effect of PhB against the rhythmic metrazol activity supports the adequacy of this activity as a model of human absences. Differences between the development of antiepileptic and hypnotic effects of PhB (described earlier) suggest two different mechanisms of action.", 
    "80": "The effects of haloperidol and diazepam were investigated on stereotypies (wall contacts and turn rounds) induced by the non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK-801 in rats. Haloperidol (0.03, 0.10, 0.25 and 0.40 mg/kg body weight) caused a dose-dependent antagonism whereas diazepam (3.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) caused a dose-dependent agonism of the stereotypies induced by 0.30 mg/kg MK-801 (all drugs given intraperitoneal). Conversely, diazepam (5.0 mg/kg) given alone reduced significantly the number of spontaneous wall contacts and turn rounds. The paradoxial stimulation of MK-801 induced stereotypies by diazepam could be explained by a shift between positive and negative corticostriatothalamic feedback loops envolving GABAergic neurons in favour of the former.", 
    "81": "One of the proposed mechanisms of action for the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines is via a decrease in central serotonergic neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to combine in vivo microdialysis in the rat with behaviour on the elevated X-maze to determine changes in 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus with concomitant measurement of behaviour. Twenty minutes exposure to the elevated X-maze resulted in an increase in extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus with no change in extracellular 5-HIAA. Restricting the rat to either the open or the closed arms produced an increase in extracellular 5-HT, however the increase in 5-HT when restricted to the open arms was not significantly greater than that on the closed arms. Forty minutes pretreatment with diazepam (2.5 mg kg-1 IP) significantly inhibited the increase in extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus and had an anxiolytic profile over 5 min and 20 min exposures of the rats to the X-maze. Diazepam had no effect on basal 5-HT levels before exposure to the X-maze but reduced extracellular 5-HT levels when the animal was returned to the holding cage. Forty minutes pretreatment with the .5-HT1A receptor partial agonist ipsapirone (1 mg kg-1 IP) significantly inhibited the increase in extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus but did not produce behaviour different from vehicle controls after 5 or 20 min periods on the X-maze.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "82": "This study evaluates whether or not some of the benzodiazepines would influence the binding of L-tryptophan to rat hepatic nuclei or nuclear envelopes. Previous publications have indicated that binding of L-tryptophan to hepatic nuclear envelope proteins was saturable, stereospecific, and of high affinity. In this study, we investigated whether some of the benzodiazepines would influence L-tryptophan binding to rat hepatic nuclei or nuclear envelopes as assayed by in vitro L-(5-3H) tryptophan binding. Our results indicate that the addition of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, prazepam, flurazepam, nordazepam, N-desalkylflurazepam, temazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, or 4-chlorodiazepam has little influence on the L-(5-3H) tryptophan binding to hepatic nuclei in vitro. However, the addition of demoxepam, the N-desalkylated compound of chlordiazepoxide, caused marked competition with 3H-tryptophan binding to hepatic nuclei in vitro. When chlordiazepoxide (1 mg/100 g body weight) is administered intraperitoneally 20 min before killing, the isolated hepatic nuclei reveal decreased specific L-tryptophan binding compared to controls. Also, rats pretreated with chlordiazepoxide intraperitoneally before tube-feeding L-tryptophan revealed diminished tryptophan-induced hepatic nuclear RNA efflux and protein synthesis. Our results suggest that chlordiazepoxide, possibly by itself or through a metabolite, can act to affect hepatic nuclear binding of L-tryptophan and to inhibit the stimulatory effect of L-tryptophan on hepatic protein synthesis."
