    "0": "Oral administration of diazepam at doses of 5-10 mg/kg to restraint-stressed mice resulted in almost complete recovery in the stress-induced suppression of the antibody response to sheep red blood cell (SRBC). Moreover, this compound restored the suppression of antibody response to SRBC in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. Diazepam treatment also enhanced the antibody response against SRBC in normal mice only when the animals were immunized with the reduced amount of antigen. It was demonstrated that antigen specific helper T cell activity was promoted by diazepam administration in mice. Addition of diazepam augmented the in vitro anti-SRBC hemolytic plaque-forming cell (PFC) response in mouse splenocytes without altering kinetics of the response. However, the enhancing effect was observed only when the drug was added to the medium at the culture initiation. On the other hand, antibody response to T cell-independent antigens such as trinitrophenylated (TNP)-Ficoll and TNP-lipopolysaccharide were not enhanced by diazepam. Concanavalin A or LPS-induced 3H-thymidine uptake into splenocytes were not stimulated by diazepam. These results suggest that diazepam promotes the antibody response through stimulating helper T cell functions.", 
    "1": "The personal experience in plastic-reconstructive surgery with 395 cases of sub-vigil anaesthesia (neuroleptanalgesia + benzodiazepine in 124 patients (group A); ketamine + benzodiazepine in 138 patients (group B); neuroleptanalgesia + ketamine + benzodiazepine in 133 patients (group C) is described by the authors in the present study. They conclude that the sub-vigil anaesthesia is usually free from complications and a very safe, tolerable, expedient technique for plastic surgical procedures; furthermore, the result is good patient acceptance, a stable blood pressure and heart rate.", 
    "2": "Recent work has suggested that, in man, the specific inhibitor of serotonin reuptake, zimelidine, can block the effects of ethanol on memory processes without affecting psychomotor performance decrements produced by ethanol. The present study was carried out to investigate whether a similar interaction between ethanol and zimelidine could be observed in mice. Using a 2-trial conditioned fear test known to be sensitive to the effects of benzodiazepines and similar drugs, it was found that ethanol, administered before the first trial, produced a dose-related disruption of fear conditioning as shown on the second trial. In a second experiment several doses of zimelidine were administered at the same time as a dose of either ethanol or diazepam. No evidence was obtained for a zimelidine-induced antagonism of the effects of either ethanol or diazepam.", 
    "3": "The effect of pretreatment with drugs on generalized clonic-tonic seizures induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of the endogenous convulsant quinolinic acid (QUIN, 50 micrograms) was studies in rats. Of the inhibitory amino acids tested, only 1-glycine (50 and 100 micrograms, i.c.v.) diminished the number of animals with seizures while taurine and GABA were ineffective. Of the kynurenine metabolites, only kynurenic acid (50 micrograms, i.c.v.) prevented seizures and lethality. Picolinic acid, nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were ineffective. The standard anticonvulsants phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin and primidone were effective antagonists of QUIN-induced seizures at doses which did not influence pentylenetetrazol seizures. However, the only drug which completely prevented QUIN-induced seizures was diazepam (10 mg/kg). It also prevented pentylenetetrazol seizures in rats in a four times lower dose. The GABA derivatives sodium hydroxybutyrate and phenibut (beta-phenyl-GABA), which are effective QUIN-antagonists in mice, were found to be ineffective in rats. Species differences between rats and mice in the efficacy of antagonists QUIN are discussed.", 
    "4": "We studied the hemodynamic interaction between midazolam and alfentanil during induction of anaesthesia in 27 patients with coronary heart disease. Using alfentanil alone (93 +/- 6 micrograms/kg) the induction was associated with stable systemic haemodynamics but also with a pressure increase in pulmonary circulation, due to chest wall rigidity and respiratory acidosis. The administration of subhypnotic doses of midazolam (50 and 100 micrograms/kg) prior to alfentanil prevented chest wall rigidity and pulmonary vasoconstriction completely, suppressed the pressor response to intubation and reduced the dose of alfentanil required for induction. However the midazolam-alfentanil combination led to hypotension, which was primarily due to a decrease of peripheral systemic resistance. Thus the haemodynamic interaction between midazolam and alfentanil resembles the known interactions between other benzodiazepines and opiates, characterized by decreased sympathetic tone and suppressed baroreceptor reflex.", 
    "5": "The water-soluble benzodiazepine midazolam was used along with fentanyl and pancuronium in a totally intravenous anesthetic technique for hysterectomies. Midazolam was given as a 0.3 mg X kg-1 bolus dose followed by constant rate infusion of 0.25 mg X kg-1 X h-1. Plasma midazolam concentrations were measured during the anesthesia. The technique provided excellent conditions for surgery, with pulse rate and blood pressure under good control and without any recall of the peri-operative period. A disadvantage was early respiratory depression, which necessitated administration of naloxone to make extubation possible. This was attributed to the proportionally large amount of fentanyl used. Drowsiness during the first postoperative hours was also pronounced.", 
    "6": "A double-blind closed sequential scheme study was carried out in 82 patients with insomnia to compare the hypnotic effectiveness of 15 mg midazolam and 1 mg lorazepam. Pairs of randomized patients were treated on one and the same night with midazolam or lorazepam, respectively. Eight parameters were recorded for each member of the pair. The time taken to fall asleep, the duration of sleep and the overall assessment of response showed that midazolam was significantly superior to lorazepam: the number of awakenings and evaluation by the patient verged on statistical significance. Both drugs were equal for the quality of sleep, dreams and the patient's condition on awakening. No side-effects were observed in any of the patients.", 
    "7": "Twelve healthy volunteers were given either midazolam 15 mg or nitrazepam 5 mg for 7 consecutive days in a randomized cross-over trial. Self-assessment of sleep, mood or condition on awakening and adverse effects was performed, and the volunteers underwent evaluation of psychomotor performance. Hypnotic effect, judged by the classical sleep variables, showed that the drugs were more or less equal and were superior to placebo. Nitrazepam consistently produced an impaired condition on awakening and also clearly displayed a spectrum of adverse motor effects. Motor tests revealed impairment induced by both drugs, but, in the midazolam group the effect subsided during the trial period. Both drugs had a significant effect on memory, midazolam appearing to perturb certain memory functions to a greater extent than did nitrazepam. The residual plasma concentration of midazolam 11 h after treatment correlated well with the scores obtained in several of the psychomotor tests, whereas plasma nitrazepam levels were not related to performance in any subtest. When discontinued neither drugs, induced any rebound phenomenon. However, the adverse effects of nitrazepam appeared to be carried over into the adjacent placebo period.", 
    "8": "Eight hours immobilization stress in young rats has increased the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in 12 out of 14 brain regions studied. In the same regions cerebral blood flow (CBF) diminished by 2-37%, but the magnitude of flow reduction was not correlated with the degree of increased BBB permeability. On the other hand, a correlation was observed with increased plasma and brain 5-HT levels. The increased BBB permeability and increased 5-HT levels were prevented by pretreatment with p-CPA, indomethacin and diazepam. Cyproheptadine and vinblastine pretreatment prevented the occurrence of increased BBB permeability alone. The probable mechanism(s) underlying the breakdown of BBB permeability is discussed.", 
    "9": "The influence of food on the absorption of midazolam, a new benzodiazepine derivative, was investigated in 18 healthy volunteers in a four-way, randomized, crossover study with a one-week washout period between treatments. Single 15-mg oral doses of midazolam were administered one hour before, with, and one hour after a standard meal as well as under fasting conditions (control). Following serial blood sampling over the next 24-hour period, midazolam plasma concentrations were determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry for pharmacokinetic evaluation. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), time of maximum concentration (tmax), lag time prior to absorption (tlag), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), and elimination rate constant of midazolam and 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam were determined. Significant changes in these parameters were not found when midazolam was taken one hour before or with a meal as compared with the control condition. Significant changes in the Cmax, tmax, and AUC parameters for both midazolam and its metabolite were seen when midazolam was ingested one hour after a meal: There was a delayed and reduced rate of absorption as well as a small reduction in the extent of absorption. Thus, ingestion of midazolam within one hour after a meal may result in a delay in the onset of the pharmacologic effect. These changes may be of some clinical significance in that they may potentially delay the onset of sleep.", 
    "10": "Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg was compared as an intramuscular premedication in small children with papaveretum and hyoscine 0.4 and 0.008 mg/kg. Midazolam produced satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis and in the early postoperative period patients were significantly more awake (p less than 0.05).", 
    "11": "Midazolam, the first benzodiazepine derivative with water-soluble salts, was studied as an induction agent in general anesthesia for the elderly. In group 1 (n = 14), 5 or 10 mg oral diazepam was used as premedication, but in group 2 (n = 9), both oral (10 mg dixyrazin as a night-time sedative) and intramuscular (0.01 mg/kg atropine + 1 mg/kg meperidine) premedicants were used. Serum concentrations of benzodiazepines were determined using both gas-liquid chromatographic (unchanged midazolam) and radioreceptor assays (binding equivalents of benzodiazepines plus their active metabolites). In general, midazolam, 0.15 mg/kg, intravenously resulted in smooth induction of anesthesia, although the time required for induction was rather long and a sudden but transient decrease in blood pressure was found in a significant number of patients. The course of anesthesia was otherwise satisfactory. A marked amnesic effect was observed, especially when diazepam was used as premedication. The pharmacokinetic parameters based on gas-liquid chromatographic measurements were quite comparable with those in young, healthy persons published earlier. In both groups, the binding equivalents measured with radioreceptor assay (reflecting total benzodiazepine activity) were higher than the levels of unchanged midazolam determined with gas-liquid chromatography. The relatively low dose of 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam needed for anesthetic induction in the elderly indicates not pharmacokinetic, but pharmacodynamic, alterations in older patients. We conclude that midazolam is a new intravenous induction agent for use in the elderly, but careful titration of the dosage according to the response of the patient is required. Diazepam premedication prior to midazolam causes a marked anterograde amnesic effect.", 
    "12": "Eleven children with severe incapacitating generalized seizures were treated with sodium valproate and clorazepate and responded with a marked decrease in seizure frequency. Three children received clorazepate alone, either because of valproate toxicity or because of parental concern over side effects. These children, 5 males and 6 females, ranged in age from 3 to 17 years. They manifested normal to severely retarded intelligence. Although valproate levels were in the therapeutic range, seizure control was inadequate. When clorazepate was added to valproate therapy a marked reduction in seizure frequency occurred within 24 hours and became optimal within 48 to 72 hours. Side effects were minimal with the exception of a nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizure in a single patient. Three children were withdrawn from therapy after a year because of recurrent seizures. One patient was restarted on therapy after 6 months and seizure control improved. Clorazepate may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of primary generalized seizures in children.", 
    "13": "Anticholinergic drugs are used to treat a number of neurologic disorders, including parkinsonism, vestibular disturbances, and dystonia. Traditionally, these drugs have been thought to act in similar fashion, as competitive antagonists at a single class of muscarinic receptors, and not to differ significantly in their therapeutic efficacy. Recently, however, pharmacologic studies have shown that the novel antagonist pirenzepine is capable of recognizing heterogeneity among muscarinic receptors; high-affinity pirenzepine sites have been classified as M1 sites and low-affinity sites as M2. This study examined whether the anticholinergics currently available for treatment of neurologic symptoms have selectivity for these subtypes and whether they differ in their degree of selectivity; the study showed that these drugs do demonstrate selectivity. All had greater affinity for the M1 site, indicated by higher affinity for rat forebrain membranes, where M1 predominates, than hindbrain preparations, where M2 predominates. The degree of selectivity varied greatly; some compounds, such as ethopropazine, had little M1 selectivity, whereas others, such as scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, and biperiden, were quite selective, like pirenzepine. It is unknown whether these differences in selectivity have any immediate therapeutic implications. However, these results support the emerging concept of muscarinic receptor subtypes and the prospect of developing more selective agents, with enhanced therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "14": "The authors have evaluated the psychotropic drug use patterns and psychological distress (with the Symptom Distress Checklist, SCL-90) amongst 331 elderly medical inpatients. Forty-two percent of the sample took psychotropic drugs during their hospitalization period. The drugs most commonly used were anxiolytics and hypnotics of the benzodiazepine class. Subjects to whom psychotropic drugs were prescribed reported higher psychological distress compared to those not receiving them; however, a score of moderate distress in the depression and sleep disturbances subscales was reported by a relatively high percentage of subjects not receiving psychotropics. Patients taking antidepressants reported scores of psychological suffering higher than those under benzodiazepine treatment: such a difference not only related to the depression subscale, but to the majority of the symptom areas investigated by the SCL-90.", 
    "15": "The two most-used treatments for phobic and obsessive-compulsive disorders are exposure and drugs. In exposure therapy, the patient is persuaded to re-enter the phobia- or ritual-evoking situation and to stay there despite the ensuing panic until it starts to subside, which may take 1 h or more. The patient does this repeatedly and systematically, noting outcome in an exposure-homework diary which the clinician reviews. Controlled studies show that such self-exposure treatment (requiring little time from the clinician) has lasting value. Only a minority of cases need additional therapist-aided exposure. Antidepressants are useful adjuvants to exposure in dysphoric phobics and ritualisers. No antidepressant is clearly superior to any other. Relapse on stopping medication is a problem. Neither beta-blockers nor benzodiazepines are yet of proven lasting value for these syndromes. It is too easy to forget that drugs have unpleasant side-effects which are not seen with exposure therapy.", 
    "16": "The central effects of sedative-hypnotic drugs were defined through the use of electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques in two species (rat and cat). In immobilized rats, spectral and visual electrocorticogram analysis provides a means of studying and comparing different profiles of sedative-hypnotic drugs. As with spectral analysis, Hjorth's descriptors allow one to detect the sedative effects of drugs and to study drug interactions in acute preparations. We have evaluated the action of hypnotics on the sleep-wakefulness cycle in freely implanted rats during their maximally active period because it is easier to estimate the duration of the sedative effect. We have also examined the action of sedative-hypnotic agents in rats and cats because of the different species reactivity to drugs such as benzodiazepines. These EEG methods are of value in the development of new hypnotic agents.", 
    "17": "In order to avoid after-effects during the day, slowly eliminated hypnotic agents should not be used in the treatment of sleep disorders. It has become customary to separate long-acting from short-acting benzodiazepines and to use the (terminal) half-life as the principle of classification. This approach is only justified, however, in the case of quickly absorbed benzodiazepines that have no pharmacologically active metabolites and that exhibit one-compartment disposition kinetics. In contrast, the duration of action of benzodiazepines characterized by marked two-compartment disposition kinetics can only be estimated correctly when the potency and all relevant kinetic parameters of the drug preparation and its pharmacologically active metabolites are considered.", 
    "18": "In a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study, the blood levels and pharmacodynamic properties of temazepam were compared with flunitrazepam using quantitative pharmaco-EEG and psychometric methods in ten healthy volunteers. Computer-assisted spectral analysis of the EEG after three doses of temazepam (10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg) compared with placebo showed statistically significant changes in brain function. These changes were also seen after the administration of the reference drug (flunitrazepam 2 mg) and are typical of anxiolytic sedatives. Psychometric and psychophysiological tests demonstrated significant alterations at the behavioural level, especially after higher doses of temazepam and 2 mg flunitrazepam, as expected. However, low doses or low blood levels of temazepam induced an improvement of performance in certain variables. Dose-efficacy calculations identified 2 mg flunitrazepam and 40 mg temazepam as the most CNS-effective, followed by 20 mg and 10 mg temazepam, while the least changes occurred after placebo. Time-efficacy calculations showed marked inter-drug differences. The pharmacodynamics of both drugs parallel their respective pharmacokinetics. Regression and correlation analyses between blood levels and EEG or psychometric changes revealed that beta activity and the centroid of the EEG were positively correlated with plasma levels, while alpha activity, psychometric variables and skin conductance were negatively correlated. Psychometric variables started to deteriorate above a blood level of approximately 250 ng/ml, while below this level an improvement was seen. Such (sedative) blood levels were only reached after doses higher than 10 mg temazepam. Our findings indicate that 10 mg temazepam has tranquilizing properties, while 20 mg and 40 mg doses exert, in addition, sedative sleep-inducing effects.", 
    "19": "An hypnotic should be used only when there is evidence of sleep disturbance. The wide range of sleep disorders (e.g. delayed sleep onset or problems of sleep maintenance) and the added complication that the patient may be involved subsequently in skilled work demand that the pharmacokinetics of various hypnotics must be understood before the correct hypnotic can be chosen. Impaired performance is more severe and persists far longer with compounds that are slowly eliminated and with the use of higher doses. The particular situations of aircrew and mountaineers have been studied in detail. Caution must be exercised in the management of aircrew coping with irregularity of rest and work. Temazepam has been used for aircrew for over 10 years and the absence of adverse effects ensures that it remains the recommended hypnotic in this area of medical practice. The relationship of insomnia with the hypoxic environment is undetermined. To investigate this, sleep was studied in six individuals during an expedition to the Himalayas. At altitude, temazepam led to less wakefulness and to drowsy sleep--there were no prolonged sleep latencies.", 
    "20": "Residual sedative effects seem to be intrinsic properties of effective hypnotic agents. Residual effects are dose related and more likely if the elimination half-life is greater than 12 hours. In two separate studies, investigations into effects on performance were carried out using a series of psychometric tests. In the first, a group of skilled radar operators working a shift system were given a pre-sleep administration of temazepam 20 mg and measurements were made of any residual effects. In the second clinical study, general practice patients suffering from idiopathic insomnia were randomized onto either temazepam 20 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg, nitrazepam 5 mg, flurazepam 15 mg, or placebo. Assessments were made using the Leeds Psychomotor Tester to measure Choice Reaction Time and Critical Flicker Fusion. In a separate test, digit substitution was used to measure sensory processing ability. In addition, the Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire was completed by each patient in the clinical study to provide a subjective evaluation of ease of getting to sleep, ease of awakening and behaviour after awakening. Neither study showed a residual activity that was likely to impair performance following temazepam 20 mg indicating the usefulness of this drug in the management of idiopathic insomnia and sleep difficulties introduced by changes in scheduling of sleep, i.e. intercontinental travel or shift work.", 
    "21": "There are three fundamental principles for understanding sleep; the sleeping brain is not a resting brain, the sleeping brain functions in a different manner from the waking brain and the activity and work of the sleeping brain are purposeful. The sleeping brain does fail and this failure is manifest in a variety of clinical symptoms; all sleep complaints should be taken seriously and investigated. Transient insomnia is uniformly associated with objective sleep disturbances which have been documented following phase shifts of the major sleep period such as that caused by transmeridian travel. However, the degree to which the individual responds to these factors is variable. There is a consensus that sleep medications are indicated for transient and short-term insomnia. Benzodiazepine hypnotics are commonly used to induce and maintain sleep, and improve daytime alertness.", 
    "22": "Benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice when initiating hypnotic therapy. Though the mechanism of benzodiazepine action in the central nervous system is similar for all drugs in this class, differences in absorption and pathway of elimination are associated with differences in observed clinical effect. After single-dose administration, onset of hypnotic effect is most closely related to rate of drug absorption and duration of effect is more closely associated with extent of drug distribution. Relative affinity of the individual benzodiazepine for the specific central nervous system binding site may also determine duration of action. During multiple-dose chronic therapy, route of metabolic biotransformation and elimination half-life assume more importance. An increased incidence of adverse drug effects due to high doses of accumulating benzodiazepines may be seen in the elderly and patients with central nervous system deficits or chronic liver disease. Benzodiazepine metabolic biotransformation and clearance is broken into three groups. Group 1--oxidative biotransformation; Group 2--high clearance drugs; Group 3--drug conjugation. Groups 1 and 2 are implicated in a number of drug-disease and drug-drug interactions. Group 3 drugs have little change in patients with liver disease or when administered with inhibitors of drug biotransformation. Clinical implications of these metabolic interactions are variable, but inhibition of Group 1 and 2 benzodiazepine clearance has been associated with increased sedation and psychomotor impairment.", 
    "23": "When the various benzodiazepine hypnotics are studied, large differences are seen with regard to their pharmacokinetic properties and metabolism in man. Some are eliminated from the body at a relatively slow rate (e.g. nitrazepam), others are metabolized rather rapidly (temazepam, triazolam). Some benzodiazepine hypnotics have major active metabolites that are slowly eliminated (flurazepam, quazepam), while others have non-active metabolites (temazepam, lormetazepam). In hypnotic treatment, the duration of drug action should be restricted to the duration of the night, hence a compound with a relatively short elimination half-life may represent a more rational choice. An overview is given of the pharmacokinetics of the currently available benzodiazepine hypnotics with emphasis on temazepam and other hydroxylated benzodiazepines.", 
    "24": "One hundred and forty-nine children were given a novel oral presentation (FDDF) of temazepam as pre-operative medication. The high degree of acceptability by the child, the short duration of onset and resulting percentage production of satisfactory demeanour in the anaesthetic room, suggest that temazepam would make a very useful addition to the paediatric premedicant armamentarium.", 
    "25": "The primary aim of premedication is to relieve the patient's anxiety/restlessness before anaesthesia and to ensure optimum quantity and quality of sleep on the night preceding surgery. With these objectives in mind, oral benzodiazepines offer a good alternative to traditional parenteral premedicants, especially as the clear anxiolytic and sedative effects of the former are of great clinical value. Oral temazepam has proven to be a valuable premedicant given on the evening before operation and/or the following morning, before surgery. Administered as a sedative in a single 20 mg oral dose the night before surgery, temazepam provided a good night's sleep in 77 percent of gynaecological surgical patients; patients slept for 7.6 hours and had no significant residual effects. As a premedicant, temazepam was as effective as parenteral diazepam or papaveretum. Temazepam's short duration of action facilitates rapid postoperative recovery in children, adults, and in the elderly. Thus, it is indicated especially for short operative procedures when rapid recovery and swift return to fitness are essential.", 
    "26": "A review is presented of the changes that occur in the pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines during normal ageing and as a result of disease. Controlled studies in which subjects of different ages have received single doses of diazepam, temazepam, nitrazepam and flunitrazepam have consistently shown an increase in the response to benzodiazepines in the elderly which is not explained by the effects of disease or by altered plasma concentrations. In general, healthy elderly subjects have a 2-3 fold greater response compared with the young. This change appears to be due to a change in the post-receptor mechanism of action. Cerebral diazepam concentrations are similar in young and elderly rats, though older animals also show an increased response and no consistent changes have been demonstrated in brain receptor binding. However, benzodiazepine-induced increases in GABA binding and GABA-induced increases in post-synaptic inhibition have been reported to be greater in aged animals. Regular daily dosing with most benzodiazepines leads to drug accumulation which is proportional to the elimination half-life. Regular dosing with diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and flurazepam has also been found to produce more sedation in the elderly, particularly long stay patients who have a high incidence of dementia, and those with a low albumen or chronic renal failure. A controlled trial of 1 week's dosing with 5 mg of nitrazepam or 20 mg of temazepam in elderly in-patients showed that these doses produced significant impairment of psychomotor performance the morning after the last dose. Only about 50% of the patients were affected and many of these were frail patients with mild dementia on rehabilitation or long stay wards. The doses prescribed for these types of patients should not exceed 2.5 mg of nitrazepam or 10 mg temazepam.", 
    "27": "The aetiology of insomnia can be conveniently divided into six groups: physical (pain, cough, etc.), physiological (shift-workers etc.), psychological (life events), psychiatric (depression, anxiety, etc.), iatrogenic (stimulant drugs, etc.) and idiopathic (no obvious cause). The four main types of insomnia are: prolonged latency, frequent short awakenings, one or two long awakenings and early morning awakening. Patients' habits that may interfere with sleep are related to: alcohol, smoking, tea and coffee drinking, and bedtime drinks. In a double-blind comparison between temazepam and nitrazepam, both drugs were shown to be effective hypnotics, nitrazepam being better for early morning wakening, although at the expense of more hangover effects. Zopiclone, a new cyclopyrrolone hypnotic, was also compared to temazepam in a double-blind cross-over trial and similar hypnotic effects were recorded with both drugs.", 
    "28": "Insomnia may be categorized as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. The ideal hypnotic must promote rapid sleep onset and maintain sleep throughout the night while allowing the patient to awake refreshed the following day. Several benzodiazepines, with differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are presently available. All are clinically effective and not only elimination half-life but also dosage prescribed and pattern of distribution are important factors for determining treatment response. Hypnotics have been divided into those with long elimination half-lives (e.g. nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam), those with intermediately long half-lives (brotizolam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, temazepam) and those with short half-lives (midazolam and triazolam). Carry-over effects into the morning such as excessive daytime sleepiness or drowsiness are related to drug half-life, dosage and pattern of distribution. In equipotent dosages most controlled clinical trials have found no significant differences between the various benzodiazepine hypnotics. Nevertheless, clinicians in general tend to use long half-life benzodiazepines in patients who have difficulties maintaining sleep and short half-life benzodiazepines for treating sleep onset insomnia. Intermediately long half-life, benzodiazepines are used for both indications and most clinicians feel that the choice of hypnotic should not only be influenced by elimination half-life or the dosage used, but by individual patient preference. Hypnotics should be used for only short periods of time and in those patients for whom a more chronic use is indicated, they should be used only on an intermittent basis.", 
    "29": "The effects of six nightly doses of temazepam (20 mg), nitrazepam (10 mg) and placebo on saccadic eye movements, critical flicker fusion threshold, choice reaction time and mood were studied in eight volunteers. Performance was measured on nights 1 and 6 of each treatment. Nitrazepam produced a residual performance impairment on night 1 that disappeared by night 6, despite higher serum concentrations of the drug on the sixth night of treatment. Temazepam, with a shorter elimination half-life, produced no significant performance impairment on night 1, but by night 6 a significant impairment of saccadic eye movements (p less than 0.05) was seen 1 hour after drug intake. We conclude that tolerance to the sedative action of nitrazepam developed over the 6-night period of the study. No evidence of tolerance was seen with temazepam. No residual effects of temazepam (20 mg) were seen the morning after the night-time drug administration.", 
    "30": "In a double-blind study, 32 outpatients with sleep disorders received oral doses of temazepam 20 mg (n = 16) or flunitrazepam 2 mg (n = 16) once a night for 7 days. On the morning after the first and seventh doses, patients completed psychomotor tests and a real driving test on the road over a 25 km course. The road test included a 1 km straight stretch driven at constant speed. In the car, various parameters were automatically recorded every second for approximately 60 minutes. These included angular velocity of steering, lateral acceleration and velocity. An optimization quotient, a measure of the efficiency of information processing in the driver-vehicle-road interaction, was derived from these parameters. An observer recorded driving performance by scoring standardized tasks. After a single dose of temazepam, the improvement in driver performance as shown by a decreased optimization quotient was significantly different to the deterioration seen after flunitrazepam (p less than 0.05). After the seventh dose, this trend was still apparent but was not statistically significant. After both one and seven doses, the angular velocity of steering was significantly decreased in the temazepam group compared with an increase after flunitrazepam (p less than 0.001). Over the straight, this deterioration in steering ability in the flunitrazepam group was apparent after one dose and reached statistical significance compared with temazepam after seven doses (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Eye movements are classified into two categories: quickly running saccades and smooth pursuit movements. Saccades are fast conjugate eye movements with a preprogrammed direction, amplitude, and speed course; their purpose is to register new objects in the visual field. The duration and velocity of saccadic eye movements are very much dependent on vigilance. Comparisons were made with a number of psychometric tests [d 2 Durchstreichtest (cross out test), Viennese determination apparatus, and flicker fusion frequency] and the velocity of fast eye movements. The results of three separate investigations are presented. Standardization was undertaken in 100 healthy volunteers, 50 male and 50 female subjects aged between 20 and more than 50 years were included. In an open parallel group study, comparisons were made between various hypnotics with different half-lives (temazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, and phenobarbital). There were 10 healthy volunteers in each group, and medication was taken as a single night-time dose for 7 nights. In a double-blind study, temazepam (20 mg/day) was tested against flunitrazepam (2 mg/day). Dosing lasted 7 days. A marked impairment of the saccadic eye movements was observed with flunitrazepam but not with temazepam. Of all the benzodiazepines tested, only temazepam had no influence on the parameters of the saccade test. These results can be explained by temazepam's short half-life and also by the fact that no active metabolites are formed.", 
    "32": "Gastric injury and dyspepsia are major side-effects of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or most non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSADs) which cause either gastric ulcerations or gastroduodenal erosions. There is only a limited number of trials in which the possibility of preventing or treating gastric lesions due to those drugs have been studied in man. This paper reviews trials in which H2-receptor antagonists, pirenzepine and prostaglandins have been investigated. - Pirenzepine given in antisecretory doses seems to improve gastrointestinal symptoms induced by ASA or NSADs. Cimetidine and misoprostol might prevent fecal blood loss. Gastroduodenal lesions might be prevented by pirenzepine, misoprostol and enprostil. It might be possible that cimetidine or ranitidine heal NSAD-induced peptic ulcers better than placebo in arthritic patients who stop the ingestion of NSADs. - All over the results of the cited trials are inconclusive, since the number of patients studied were too small and the design of almost all trials was incomparable. Furthermore, all cited studies do not correspond to Robert's concept of \"cytoprotection\", since H2-blockers, pirenzepine and prostaglandins have been applied in antisecretory doses in man.", 
    "33": "The effects of intravenous administration of diazepam (average 20 mg) on learning, performance and mood were assessed in dental patients. These patients required sedation due to excessive anxiety in a dental situation, or because they were to undergo stressful surgery. On a verbal learning task, subjects recalled and recognized significantly fewer words from a list presented after drug administration than from a list presented prior to drug administration, when tested at the end of the treatment period. When tested after treatment, subjects recognised few of a series of picture postcards that had been presented to them during the course of treatment. Subjects showed no significant impairments after diazepam treatment on digit-symbol substitution, symbol copying or number cancellation tasks compared to pre-treatment scores; however, there was a small but significant reduction in the number of finger-taps made. Mood-rating scales showed significant increases in sedation and well-being after diazepam treatment compared to pre-treatment scores, and also a significant reduction in anxiety levels. This study shows that the amnesic effects of diazepam are present in a \"real-life\" stress situation.", 
    "34": "Panic disorder has recently been recognized as a distinct sub-type of anxiety which may occur with or without phobic avoidance. Controlled prospective trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors in the treatment of this disorder. The use of benzodiazepines and beta-blockers has been more controversial. Some preliminary studies assessing other pharmacological agents are available. Methodological problems limit the conclusions which may be drawn from available data.", 
    "35": "Conventional anticholinergics (better called muscarinic antagonists) do not differentiate between subtypes of muscarinic receptors and cause unpleasant side-effects in peptic ulcer treatment. Pirenzepine, the first M1-receptor antagonist, has more selective inhibitory properties on oxyntic gastric glands and accelerates healing rates in peptic ulcer. Pirenzepine and H2-receptor antagonists interact synergistically on parietal cell function; their combination seems to be of therapeutic advantage in defined indications. Telenzepine, a pirenzepine analogue with a modified tricycle and M1-receptor selectivity, is about 10 to 25 times more potent than pirenzepine in reducing basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion in man. In patients with duodenal ulcer 3 mg telenzepine nocte seems to be as effective as 50 mg pirenzepine twice daily in regard to ulcer healing and pain relief. Another pirenzepine analogue with a modified side-chain (AF-DX 116) proved to be cardioselective in animal pharmacology, and was characterized as an M2-receptor antagonist. This might be an important step for a more profound understanding of structure-activity relationships of muscarinic receptor antagonists.", 
    "36": "The relationship between the debrisoquine oxidation status and the metabolism of clomipramine was studied in nine healthy volunteers (five rapid hydroxylators, three slow hydroxylators and one of intermediate status). The hydroxylation of clomipramine and demethylclomipramine were found to covary with that of debrisoquine, whereas demethylation of clomipramine seemed to be independent of the debrisoquine hydroxylation phenotype. The steady-state blood concentrations of clomipramine and its three main metabolites were measured in 122 depressed patients. Thirteen patients who concomitantly received a neuroleptic tended to have higher levels of demethylclomipramine and clomipramine, whereas the levels of the hydroxylated metabolites were hardly affected. Benzodiazepine co-administration did not modify the pharmacokinetics of clomipramine. The results suggest that benzodiazepines rather than levomepromazine should be used in depressed patients with anxiety and/or agitation in combination with the antidepressant treatment.", 
    "37": "Clinical studies revealed a significant increase in the peripheral blood levels of noradrenaline in patients with different forms of neurosis and neurosis-like states as compared to control subjects as well as heterogeneous or unidirectional but differently pronounced changes in blood levels of acetylcholine and adrenaline. Comparison of the clinical findings with the results of dynamic assays for peripheral levels of acetylcholine and catecholamine in dogs exposed to special psychogenic and physiogenic impacts has helped to form an understanding about some common mechanisms of the formation of neuroses and neurosis-like states. The authors emphasize the consistency of neuromediator shifts in the blood of patients and the possibility of using this parameter for the differential diagnosis of various forms of neurotic disturbances at the initial stage of the disease.", 
    "38": "Squirrel monkeys were trained to press a key under a two-component schedule of food presentation. In the presence of either green or red stimulus lights, the 30th response produced a food pellet (fixed-ratio schedule). During the red stimulus lights (punishment component), the first response of each fixed ratio produced either an IV injection of histamine (100.0 micrograms/kg/inj) or a brief electric shock (3.0 mA). Responding was selectively suppressed in either punishment component. Presession IM administration of chlorpheniramine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg), diphenhydramine (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg), or pyrilamine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) increased rates of responding punished by histamine but not those punished by electric shock. Presession administration of promethazine (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) or tripelennamine (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) also increased rates of responding punished by histamine in all subjects and response rates punished by electric shock in one of three subjects. Chlordiazepoxide (3.0-56.0 mg/kg) increased rates of responding punished by either histamine or electric shock. These results suggest that the punishing effects of histamine injection are mediated by H1 receptors and that H1-receptor antagonists increase rates of responding suppressed by punishment only under limited conditions including those in which histamine is the punishing stimulus.", 
    "39": "The possible involvement of serotonin, GABA and opioid peptides in anxiety and in the mechanism of action of benzodiazepine tranquilizers have recently been the subjects of intensive biochemical, neurophysiological and behavioral research. The present review examines the behavioral evidence, viewing anxiety and benzodiazepine action as far as possible separately. Four behavioral paradigms of experimental anxiety or \"conflict behaviors\" are described and assessed for soundness with some practical considerations. The functional significance and pharmacology of benzodiazepine receptors are discussed, and the cases for a number of putative endogenous ligands are examined. Conflict behavior is attenuated by drugs which reduce functional serotonin activity and enhanced by serotonin agonists, but there is little evidence to implicate serotonin in benzodiazepine action. GABA antagonists both intensify conflict and reduce benzodiazepine effects, but evidence of the reverse effects with GABA agonists is more equivocal. The interpretation of behavioral effects of opiate agonists and antagonists and their interactions with benzodiazepines is hindered by their actions on motivational systems other than anxiety, and evidence for an important role of opioid peptides is only suggestive. Some promising lines for future research are indicated.", 
    "40": "A double-blind crossover trial was carried out to compare the anxiolytic activity of lormetazepam vs diazepam. After 1 week of placebo, the drugs were administered for 4 weeks (10 drops twice daily) to 10 subjects with anxiety disorders. Each patient received either lormetazepam or diazepam and modifications of symptoms were evaluated through a series of tests at various intervals (days 0, 8, 16, 24, 32 and 40 of the study). Both drugs proved to be effective and significantly superior to placebo. They were both well tolerated.", 
    "41": "Forty nine patients with a chronic form of multiple sclerosis (MS) [progressive or stable] were treated with hyperbaric oxygen (HO) in a double blind trial. Patients were divided in three groups: the first group (group I) received a course of 2.3 ATA HO with diazepam (5 mg); the second group (group II) received a course of 2 ATA HO; the third group (group III) was the control group. Each patient breathed an adapted gaseous mixture in high pressure. Each patient received 20 sessions of this procedure during 4 weeks. Patients were evaluated with clinical, neurophysiological and immunological parameters. Clinical examination consisted in the evaluation of the Kurtzke's Disability Status Scale (DSS) and Functional Status Scale (FSS). This evaluation was done in the week before the procedure, the week following the treatment, then in the third and sixth month. The neurophysiological study was a comparative analysis from the variations of visual, somesthesic and brain stem auditory potentials. The immunological study was the analysis of the lymphocyte populations (OKT4/OKT8 ratio). Each examination was carried out the week before, then the week following the procedure. We found no amelioration into three groups. Subjectively, some patients thought to be better, but this was true in the two treated groups (I, II) and in the control group (III). There was not an FSS significant variation. We also found no significant variation of evoked potentials and OKT4/OKT8 ratio. We observed some incidental effects of the treatment, particularly in group I, in which patients were treated with a higher pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Thirteen healthy subjects participated in a combined acute and subacute double-blind, cross-over trial of two H1-antihistamines diphenhydramine (DPH) and temelastine (SKF) against placebo. The doses were DPH 50 mg b.d. and SKF 100 mg b.d. Objective (digit symbol substitution, flicker fusion, Maddox wing, attention, tracking, choice reaction) and subjective (visual analogue scales, side-effects on questionnaire) tests were done on Days 1, 4 and 5, on each occasion before drug intake and after 90 min and 3 h. On Day 1 DPH caused clear sedation of unpleasant character and impaired flicker fusion, attention and digit symbol substitution. SKF shifted the VAS assessment \"drowsy/alert\" towards drowsiness at 90 min, without objective impairment. On Day 4 DPH reduced exophoria and impaired flicker fusion without subjective sedation. On Day 5, diazepam 0.3 mg/kg (DZ) given with the other drugs caused subjective sedation of pleasant character and impaired various functions in the objective tests. Neither SKF nor DPH increased the effects of DZ; DPH slightly counteracted the effect of DZ on exophoria. At home, SKF did not differ from placebo while DPH proved sedative. DPH did not improve sleep but caused dry mouth and blurred vision. Measurement of plasma levels of antihistamines on each test day revealed the development of tolerance to antihistamine-induced sedation. The concentration of DZ measured by bioassay was somewhat elevated in the presence of DPH. Since the majority of the performance tests were not influenced by temelastine, it appears to be an acceptable, novel H1-antihistamine for the treatment of allergic disorders.", 
    "43": "Noradrenaline (NA) plasma levels were examined in 18 healthy volunteers on 2 consecutive days after a single treatment with either lormetazepam (0.06 mg/kg) (LMZ group), flunitrazepam (0.03 mg/kg) (FNZ group) or placebo (PLA group) in combination with the benzodiazepine (BZ) antagonist Ro 15-1788 (0.1 mg/kg). Behavioural responses (mood changes, anxiety) were also investigated in parallel. Both BZ decreased NA plasma levels to 50% of the basal values 10 min after the injection; administration of Ro 15-1788 15 min later reinstated NA plasma levels to basal values. A second administration of Ro 15-1788 (0.1 mg/kg) 24 h after BZ or PLA treatment increased NA plasma levels, estimated 10 min after the injection in both the LMZ- and the FNZ groups, but not in the PLA group. Behavioural responses measured under the same treatment also indicated minor anxiety responses followed by mood impairment. These data suggest that a stressful situation may be precipitated by the antagonist Ro 15-1788 24 h after a single BZ treatment, which resembles a withdrawal response, and increases NA plasma levels.", 
    "44": "Benzodiazepines and other compounds which act at benzodiazepine binding sites have been shown previously to attenuate the acquisition of conditioned fear in rodents when administered before the acquisition session, an effect which may parallel the disruption of human memory produced by anxiolytics and sedatives. Such an action is usually, but not invariably, produced by doses which have direct behavioural depressant effects. The present study was carried out to extend previous work by investigating the effects of the hypnotic benzodiazepine triazolam and the nonbenzodiazepines zolpidem and CL 218,872 on the acquisition of learned fear in mice. All these drugs reduced locomotor activity shortly after injection. They also produced disruptions of the acquisition of learned fear. Triazolam exerted behavioural effects similar to those found previously with other benzodiazepines, the does which disrupted the acquisition of conditioned fear being similar to, or lower than, the doses which depressed locomotion. In contrast, the results indicated that zolpidem was more potent at reducing locomotion than at interfering with fear conditioning, a result which may reflect the preferential sedative action of zolpidem.", 
    "45": "Rats were made diazepam dependent by chronic treatment with daily injections of the drug, 20 mg/kg, IP, for 3 weeks. On abrupt termination of the drug, the animals showed withdrawal hyperactivity which was indicated by increased horizontal locomotion and vertical activity, and diarrhoea. The peak effect was seen 3 days after the withdrawal of diazepam. Effects of various alpha 2 agonists, clonidine, guanfacine and B-HT 920, were studied on the diazepam withdrawal phenomena. Clonidine (100 micrograms/kg, IP) given twice a day at an interval of 12 h prevented both withdrawal-induced hyperactivity and diarrhoea. On the contrary, equimolar doses of guanfacine and B-HT 920 failed to reverse withdrawal-induced hyperactivity but attenuated the effect of diarrhoea. However, higher doses (500 micrograms/kg, IP) of guanfacine and B-HT 920 given twice a day at 12-h intervals were found to be effective. Pretreatment with yohimbine (1.5 mg/kg, IP) reversed the protective effect of clonidine, indicating the involvement of alpha 2 receptors in the action of clonidine.", 
    "46": "The activity of 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (2-APH), an antagonist of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptor, was tested in several animal models of anxiolytic activity in rats and mice and compared with the activity of the standard benzodiazepine anxiolytic, diazepam. 2-APH was effective, but about 100 times less potent than diazepam in antagonising the suppressive effects of punishment on locomotor activity in the four-plate test in mice. 2-APH was also effective in enhancing exploration of the open, exposed arms of a plus maze, without altering exploration of the enclosed arms. Again 2-APH was about 100 times less effective than diazepam. In contrast to diazepam, 2-APH was ineffective in antagonising the pro-punishment properties of the anxiogenic beta-carboline DMCM in a modified four-plate test, and in antagonising the discriminative stimulus provided by pentylenetetrazol. These results are discussed in the context of the equivalence of the antagonism of excitatory mechanisms and the enhancement of inhibitory systems as anxiolytic treatments.", 
    "47": "A group of 24 healthy, normal sleepers participated in 2 experiments. The 1st experiment was designed to investigate the effects of 2 nocte doses of temazepam on subjective sleep quality and performance next morning. In contrast to placebo or no-capsule conditions both temazepam 10 and 20 mg improved a number of assessments of sleep quality, although no residual effects on performance were detected. The 2nd experiment was designed to study the effects of temazepam 20 mg on daytime sleeping and subsequent performance following a simulated night shift. Compared to placebo, temazepam had favourable effects on the subjective duration and quality of daytime sleep, but had no overall beneficial or detrimental residual effects on performance.", 
    "48": "An exponential relationship was observed between the firing rate of cerebellar Purkinje cells in urethane-anaesthetized rats and the duration of inhibition evoked in these cells by electrical stimulation of the nearby cortical surface. Benzodiazepines, administered i.v., decreased cell firing and increased the duration of the inhibitory response but did not alter the relationship between the two parameters. These effects of one benzodiazepine, RU 32007, were reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 which had little effect alone. The benzodiazepine inverse agonists methyl- or ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate increased cell firing with the expected reductions in duration of inhibitory response in some cases. However, in 50% of recordings the inhibitory response disappeared, independent of the firing rate. All the effects of the beta-carboline esters were reversed by Ro15-1788 or the benzodiazepine, RU 32007. This action of the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists represents an in vivo blockade of an endogenous synaptic inhibition which is thought to be mediated by release of GABA.", 
    "49": "To study a correlation between anxiety and delirium, 50 schizophrenic patients with the anxiety-delirious syndrome were treated with anxiolytics (leponex and phenazepam). The results were evaluated with the help of a special graded scale. The first control group consisted of 20 patients with vascular and organic psychoses with the anxiety-delirious syndrome who were treated by phenazepam. The second control group was composed of 20 schizophrenics with analogous symptomatology treated by traditional neuroleptics (haloperidol and tisercin). In many patients reduction of anxiety closely and directly correlated with that of delirium, which evidenced the leading role of anxiety in the structure of the syndrome in those patients. It has been demonstrated that in patients of this group treatment with antianxiety drugs is more effective than that with conventional neuroleptics. The diazepam test is proposed as a method of predicting the effect of anxiolytic therapy.", 
    "50": "Evidence related to the effects of benzodiazepines on learning and memory is reviewed in the contexts of human verbal learning studies and animal studies using both aversive and non-aversive paradigms. While the impairment of acquisition by benzodiazepines appears to be a robust phenomenon generalizing across species and experimental conditions, the impairment in the performance of an already-learned task by such drugs appears to be more restrictive and highly dependent upon experimental contingencies. Thus far, performance impairment appears to be found mainly in animal studies using non-aversive, food-motivated tasks, with such tasks being particularly well suited for investigating such a phenomenon. At present, there is a noticeable lack of knowledge regarding the neurochemical substrates underlying BDZ-induced impairment. Finally, some issues that may contribute to the presence or absence of a BDZ-induced performance impairment in published studies are briefly considered.", 
    "51": "A single dose of temazepam 10 mg, as a solution in soft gelatin capsules, was given to 10 fasting geriatric in-patients (mean age 83 years) in a stable clinical condition. The mean peak plasma concentration was 306 ng/ml, with a median time of 0.75 h to peak concentration. Temazepam was eliminated from plasma in a biexponential manner, with a distribution phase (mean t1/2 alpha = 0.7 h) predominating for 3 h. The drug had a mean elimination half-life of 8.7 h. In a chronic study, in which temazepam 10 mg p.o. was given nightly to 13 patients, the plasma concentrations on Days 3, 5, 8, 12 and 15 were not significantly different from each other, showing rapid attainment of steady state levels and the lack of drug accumulation.", 
    "52": "The authors investigated parameters of the sinus rhythm and of the structure of physiological sleep in 11 cats after ligation of the interventricular artery. ECG of the cerebral cortex, electromyogram, electrooculogram, ECG and respiration were registered, both in the acute period of infarction (4th-10th day of the experiment) and in the subacute and late period (3-12 months). In the acute and subacute period, an abrupt decrease was found in the sinus rhythm variability during the waking-sleep cycle. Propranolol administration (10 mg/kg) reduced in intact animals the heart rate, especially during wakefulness, and the rhythm variability during wakefulness and sleep. Suppression of sinus rhythm automatism due to propranolol in animals with experimental MI was most pronounced in the acute period during REM sleep, in the subacute period during wakefulness. In the acute period of MI, the sleep structure was disorganized, in the subacute period it got partly normalized. Protracted propranolol administration in the subacute period of MI led to disturbances in the sleep structure, with reduced REM sleep and prolongation of stage I-II (superficial sleep).",

Consequences for forensic medicine are finally investigated.", 
    "54": "An anti-benzodiazepine monoclonal antibody has been used to demonstrate the existence of benzodiazepine-like molecules in the brain and for the purification of these molecules. Immunocytochemical experiments show that these molecules are neuronal and not glial and that they are ubiquitously distributed throughout the brain. Immunoblots indicate the presence of benzodiazepine-like epitopes in several brain peptides. An endogenous substance that binds to the central-type benzodiazepine receptor with agonist properties has been purified to homogeneity from the bovine brain. The purification consisted on immunoaffinity chromatography on immobilized monoclonal anti-benzodiazepine antibody followed by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 and two reverse phase HPLCs. The purified substance has a small molecular weight and its activity is protease resistant. The endogenous substance blocks the binding of agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists to the central-type benzodiazepine receptor but it does not inhibit the binding of Ro5-4864 to the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine receptor. The neurotransmitter gamma-amino-butyric acid increases the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for the purified substance. Thus this benzodiazepine-like substance is different from the endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands reported by others.", 
    "55": "Pharmacological studies of the effect of Diazepam and Medazepam on prolactin secretion were carried out on sexually mature male albino rats. The experiments were carried out using two series of experimental set-ups. In the first series an analysis was made of the effect of Diazepam in doses of 2 and 4 mg/kg body mass, and of Medazepam in doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg body mass, on the prolactin secretion on the 60th min after a single intraperitoneal injection. The second series of experiments was designed to investigate the effect of Diazepam and Medazepam in the same doses under conditions of acute immobilization of the animals for 60 min. The prolactin levels in the serum were tested using a radioimmunological method. Prolactin secretion decreases after a single intraperitoneal administration of Diazepam in both doses. Prolactin content in the serum was reduced only after a dose of 10 mg/kg body mass. Under conditions of experimental immobilization stress, prolactin secretion was stimulated in the animals from the control group, treated with standard solution used as solvent. Diazepam in both doses administered and Medazepam in a dose of 10 mg/kg inhibit the prolactin secretion stimulated by acute immobilization stress.", 
    "56": "Clonazepam (1 mg h.s.) and temazepam (30 mg h.s.) were studied in 10 patients diagnosed as having insomnia with nocturnal myoclonus. Each subject underwent two nocturnal polysomnographic recordings while drug-free, two during treatment with clonazepam, and two during treatment with temazepam. Treatment sessions were 7 days long, and recordings were done on nights 6 and 7 of the treatment sessions. A 14-day washout period separated the treatment sessions. The order of drugs used in the first and second treatment sessions was randomized. Objective and subjective sleep laboratory data showed that both drugs improved the sleep of patients with insomnia in association with nocturnal myoclonus. Neither drug significantly reduced the number of nocturnal myoclonic events. Sleep changes were consistent with those produced by sedative benzodiazepines in general. Thus, the data support clinical reports that clonazepam, a benzodiazepine marketed for the indication of seizure, is useful in improving sleep disturbances associated with nocturnal myoclonus. Temazepam, a benzodiazepine marketed for the indication of insomnia, was found to be a suitable alternative to clonazepam in the treatment of insomnia associated with nocturnal myoclonus. The present data and other studies suggest the need for a model that explains why leg movements and sleep disturbances may wax and wane independently.", 
    "57": "The kinetics of delorazepam (chlordesmethyldiazepam; CDDZ), and its major metabolite, lorazepam (LRZ) during multiple-dose therapy have been evaluated in two groups of patients with primary or secondary anxiety. The 12 patients in group 1 were 46.8 +/- less than 13.2 years while the eight in group 2 were significantly older (69.7 +/- 7.8 years). All patients were given 0.5 mg twice daily of CDDZ for 30 days. Concentrations of CDDZ and LRZ in multiple blood samples collected during the study were determined by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. The degree of anxiety was evaluated from the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (HRSA). CDDZ and LRZ accumulated in plasma but the rate of accumulation of CDDZ was slower than expected from studies in young volunteers and the half-life values were significantly related to age. Steady-state levels of glucuronated LRZ were also lower in elderly patients. Data indicate that CDDZ is more slowly eliminated and less metabolized as age increases. While pre-treatment scores of HRSA were similar in the two groups, older patients improved significantly less than those of group 1 and had also an higher incidence of side-effects. CDDZ levels positively correlated with improvement in group 1 but not in group 2.", 
    "58": "The dose effects of temazepam tablets (15 and 30 mg) were studied at two sleep centres in 48 volunteers who had objective polysomnographic evidence of sleep onset insomnia. Volunteers slept in the laboratory, retiring at their usual bedtime after taking placebo or temazepam 30 min earlier, and were monitored for 8 h using standard polysomnographic techniques. Acute (nights 5-7) and short term (nights 11-13) temazepam, both 15 and 30 mg, improved the sleep of these volunteers by reducing sleep latency and increasing sleep time compared to the placebo baseline (nights 2-4). Dose differences were found primarily on the measurement of sleep staging, with 30 mg having a greater or more consistent effect than 15 mg. No residual effects were observed on the basis of questionnaires and objective tests of performance and no consistent evidence of disturbed sleep after discontinuing treatment was seen.", 
    "59": "The chronic hypnotic efficacy of estazolam 2.0 mg was studied in five female and seven male subjects. Subjects with a complaint of insomnia verified by polysomnography were included in the study. Following a screening and adaptation period, subjects spent two consecutive nights a week in the laboratory. The protocol for medication was placebo for weeks 1, 2, 9 and 10 and estazolam for weeks 3-8. Estazolam 2.0 mg significantly improved sleep onset and total sleep time for up to six weeks of nightly administration without consistent recovery effects upon discontinuation.", 
    "60": "The results of this double-blind study showed that both chlormethiazole and temazepam are effective, in the correct dose, for the short-term treatment of sleep disturbance in elderly patients. With chlormethiazole treatment there was no daytime drowsiness, whereas significant daytime drowsiness occurred with temazepam.", 
    "61": "The problems experienced by elderly patients taking hypnotic drugs are reviewed. They include those associated with accumulation, tolerance, drug dependence and the intensity and duration of response. Biological mechanisms associated with ageing enhance some of these effects in the elderly. Care should be taken to define the precise indications for hypnotic use and to choose the correct drug and dose for the patient's condition and age.", 
    "62": "Sleep disturbance is common in the elderly. The causes of sleep disturbance are varied, and no single treatment can be successful in all cases. Psychotropic drugs and hypnotics are the drugs most frequently prescribed to the elderly in West Germany. The indications for using benzodiazepines, chlormethiazole, butyrophenones and chloral hydrate are discussed. However, in all cases the underlying cause of the sleep disturbance should be sought rather than treating the symptoms in isolation.", 
    "63": "Certain drugs used to treat the elderly are known to precipitate hypothermia. In this study, the effects of chlormethiazole and thioridazine in producing postural hypotension were compared. In a study of hypothermia in the elderly the effects of chlormethiazole, thioridazine and lormetazepam were examined. Only three patients showed a postural drop following chlormethiazole, while 11 showed a postural drop following thioridazine. Chlormethiazole showed little variation from the control group in the hypothermia study, while thioridazine and lormetazepam caused a fall in temperature. For behaviour control in the elderly and for a short course as a hypnotic, chlormethiazole seems to be safer than thioridazine or lormetazepam.", 
    "64": "Studies in mice demonstrated that the anticonvulsant profile of chlormethiazole differs from that of diazepam and the barbiturates. Chlormethiazole protects animals from convulsions induced by a wide variety of chemoconvulsants known to block the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), such as bicuculline, picrotoxin, isoniazid and pentetrazol, thus confirming and extending earlier studies on its broad anticonvulsant characteristics. Chlormethiazole is particularly potent against isoniazid-induced convulsions, which are probably induced by reductions of GABA levels in the brain. Chlormethiazole was found to have a weak action on benzodiazepine receptor binding, GABA receptor binding and kainic acid receptor binding. Chlormethiazole inhibited picrotoxin binding at very high concentrations, but lowered the functional effects of picrotoxin at much lower concentrations than those affecting picrotoxin binding. Moreover, chlormethiazole failed to change GABA or glutamate levels in the brain and did not affect glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activities in the rat brain. Muscimol (a GABAA agonist) enhanced the anticonvulsant activity of chlormethiazole against picrotoxin but not against bicuculline-induced convulsions. Muscimol enhanced the anticonvulsant potency of diazepam against both chemoconvulsants. These data suggest that the anticonvulsant activity of chlormethiazole is not mediated directly through changes in GABA or glutamate levels or by a direct (agonist) action at the GABA or benzodiazepine receptor complex. These findings suggest that chlormethiazole may enhance GABA transmission beyond the GABA receptors, hypothetically at the level of the GABA receptor coupled ionophore (e.g. the chloride ion channel). Applied micro-iontophoretically, chlormethiazole was found to potentiate the inhibitory responses to GABA, muscimol and glycine, but not to acetylcholine. The potentiation of glycine-mediated inhibition is unique for chlormethiazole and does not occur with any other known anticonvulsant (barbiturates, benzodiazepine, phenytoin or sodium valproate). Studies in primary cultures, derived from spinal cord neurones, showed that chlormethiazole produces hyperpolarization together with an increase in the threshold for action potential generation. Further in vitro studies indicated that chlormethiazole acts on some types of Ca2+-dependent chloride ion channels.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "65": "The anticonflict properties of the anxiolytic diazepam and of the dipeptide Litoralon gamma-L-glutamyl-taurine and two of its analogues SZJ 3388, gamma-aminobutyryl-ethanolamine phosphate, and SZJ 3361, D-1-aminoisobutyrylethanolamine phosphate have been investigated in a \"time-to-emerge\" conflict paradigm in non-deprived rats. Diazepam, Litoralon and compound SZJ 3388 significantly decreased the \"time-to-emerge\" latency (TTE latency) in a dose-dependent manner versus saline- or vehicle-treated controls in doses between 0.05 and 0.50 mg/kg intraperitoneally. The analogue SZJ 3361 was inactive as regards the TTE latency, while the anti-histaminic promethazine lengthened the TTE latency in a dose-dependent manner. The number of irresolute responses was significantly decreased following administration of diazepam, SZJ 3388 and Litoralon and was positively correlated with the TEE latency-decreasing activity of these compounds. The data are discussed in terms of the benzodiazepine-like anxiolytic or anti-conflict properties of these dipeptides.", 
    "66": "The clinical effects of midazolam (7.5, 10 and 15 mg), diazepam 10 mg, fentanyl 0.1 mg and fentanyl 0.1 mg-droperidol 5 mg, administered intramuscularly for surgical premedication, were compared in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. The degree of sedation provided by midazolam was significantly superior to diazepam, fentanyl or placebo. The largest dose of midazolam also impaired the lucidity of the patients and induced a moderate degree of muscular hypotony. A dose-effect relationship was observed only for the sedative effects of midazolam 60 min after administration. Midazolam scored consistently better than diazepam, fentanyl, placebo and fentanyl-droperidol for incidence of amnesia, stability of cardiovascular measurements and physician's acceptance. In all treatment groups, including placebo, anxiety decreased significantly with time. However, if expressed as percentage change, the greatest decrease occurred in the midazolam 15 mg group compared to all other treatments. Midazolam appeared to be a more effective premedicant than diazepam, analgesics or placebo. The intensity of the combined central nervous system effects suggested the dose of 10 mg might be the most suitable for intramuscular premedication.",

Lormetazepam exerted a marked sedative-hypnotic effect maximal at 10 min. Lorazepam had a slower onset of action with a peak effect at 40 min on the different neurobehavioral functions but seemed to induce a longer duration of sedation and a more consistently obtunded awareness of perisurgical events than lormetazepam. Sensory functions were similarly affected by both drugs. Motor function was significantly more impaired by lormetazepam than by lorazepam (P 0.05). Both drugs significantly decreased anxiety for at least 60 min after premedication. Important changes of muscle tone were noticed with lormetazepam at 10 to 30 min resulting in upper airway obstruction in some patients. All hemodynamic changes remained clinically acceptable in both groups and no side effects were seen. The clinical anesthesiologists rated the quality of premedication as unsatisfactory in 7% of the patients treated with lorazepam and in 27% of those receiving lormetazepam. Together with its milder neurobehavioral effects and highly effective anxiolytic action, these factors favor the use of lorazepam for anesthetic premedication despite a relatively slow onset of action.", 
    "68": "A clinico-statistical study of therapy and rehabilitation of 37 patients with psychopath-like schizophrenia selected by the method of blanket sampling using a criterion of the loss of the working ability within 12 months and more showed high efficiency of comprehensive medicated and intensive socio-rehabilitative action (industrial therapy). The role of the stimulating component in the spectrum of psychotropic activities of neuroleptics in the treatment of psychopath-like schizophrenia was ascertained. The result of the work was the employment of 20 of the 37 patients studied. It was shown in 37 randomly selected disabled patients with slowly progressive (psychopath-like) schizophrenia that stimulating neuroleptics played a definite role in including methods of intensive socio-occupational therapy into the management of these patients.", 
    "69": "The effects of benzodiazepines, GABA and adenosine on distress-induced hyperemotionality and gastric lesion formation were investigated in rats. Hyperemotionality such as struggling, vocalization and defecation evoked immediately after immobilization stress were attenuated by diazepam, adenosine or adenosine plus diazepam. Conversely, pretreatment with these drugs produced rapid and potent exacerbation of gastric lesions observed after 12 h of stress. The potent adenosine A1-receptor agonist N6-cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA) markedly inhibited the distress-evoked hyperemotional behaviors and potentiated the ulceration. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscimol, a GABA receptor agonist, and aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), a GABA deaminase inhibitor, attenuated both stress-induced hyperemotionality and ulceration. The inhibitory effects of diazepam and GABA on hyperemotionality were reversed, respectively, by Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, and bicuculline, a GABA receptor antagonist. The stimulatory effect of CHA on stress ulceration was potentiated by bicuculline but was not affected by Ro15-1788 or by picrotoxin, a chloride channel inhibitor. These results suggest that the mechanism involved in gastric lesion formation induced by immobilization stress may be different from that in hyperemotional behavior, and that the activation of GABAergic neurons may act as a central modulating factor in the hyperemotionality and ulceration induced by immobilization stress.", 
    "70": "Antidepressants and some other psychotropic drugs affect the synthesis and release of melatonin through several mechanisms. Monoamine oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting antidepressants increase pineal concentrations of the melatonin precursors, serotonin (5-HT) and N-acetyl serotonin (NAS), in rodents, and also increase pineal N-acetyl transferase activity as well as both daytime and nighttime plasma melatonin concentrations; they also elevate melatonin, 5-HT and NAS in the cerebrospinal fluid of non-human primates. In humans treated with the MAO-A selective inhibitor, clorgyline, or the nonselective inhibitor, tranylcypromine, increased plasma melatonin also occurs; in contrast, the MAO-B selective inhibitor, 1-deprenyl, does not affect plasma melatonin. Chronically-administered tricyclic antidepressants with prominent effects on monoamine uptake and on beta-adrenoceptors reduce pineal and plasma melatonin in rodents; however, in two studies in depressed patients, either no change or a significant elevation in nocturnal plasma melatonin followed 3 to 4 weeks treatment with desipramine. As depressed patients in these and several other recent studies had lower pretreatment nighttime melatonin peaks than controls, these findings may be relevant to the presynaptic and receptor adaptational consequences of chronic antidepressant drug treatment. The significant effects on melatonin of other drugs which affect monoamine function and have psychotropic effects, including lithium, propranolol, amphetamine and several monoamine precursors, together with recent observations of the existence of muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptors in the pineal gland are in accord with previous suggestions that the study of pineal function and melatonin production provides a valuable model system for psychopharmacological investigations.", 
    "71": "We will present data from the comparison between four tests in mice of 10 1,4-benzodiazepines and one 1,5-benzodiazepine (clobazam). The tests used were: the \"4 plates test\" of anxiolytic activity; the electroshock test to determine the anticonvulsive effects; actimetry to predict the sedative effect on motricity; and traction test to predict the myorelaxant effect. The latter two tests have been suggested to be predictive of side-effects that damage psychomotor efficiency in human patients. A comparison of ED50s determined from the predictive tests of the therapeutic effect and those of the side-effects led to the calculation of ratios considered to be predictive of the safety margin. A classification according to this margin shows the advantages of the 1,5-benzodiazepine compared with the 1,4-benzodiazepines. Despite the caution needed in the extrapolation of the results from animals to humans, this work stresses the interesting place that the 1,5-benzodiazepine seem to hold as anticonvulsant in clinical practice.", 
    "72": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) ligands clonazepam (CLO) and Ro5-4864 which preferentially bind to neuronal and non-neuronal elements, respectively, have been used to follow neuronal and non-neuronal development in fetal murine cortical cultures. CLO-displaceable BDZ binding, choline acetyltransferase (CAT) activity, high-affinity delta-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake, and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity reached a maximum value at the end of the second week in culture reflecting maximum neuronal maturation and development. There is a developmental order of these four functions: CAT activity (main enzyme in the synthesis of acetylcholine, a stimulating neurotransmitter) reached maximal levels first, 3H-GABA uptake and CLO-displaceable flunitrazepam receptor binding reached maximal levels 1 day later, and 4 days later GAD activity (primary enzyme in the synthesis of GABA, an inhibitor neurotransmitter) reached maximal levels.", 
    "73": "Standard explanatory models of addiction are reviewed, including personality theory, locus of control, behaviorist theory, social learning, biochemical and socioeconomic theories, in the context of understanding the female preponderance in prescription drug addiction. Alexander and Hadaway's \"adaptive\" model of addiction is presented as a more comprehensive model of female prescription drug addiction, encompassing relevant and therapeutically useful aspects of earlier models. It also permits both the individualization of the model to each woman's particular situation, and also the incorporation of common themes stemming from sex-role stereotyping, low status in the society, and the power dynamic of the male physician-female patient interaction.", 
    "74": "Previous work has shown that administration of pimozide and other neuroleptic drugs can produce within-session response decrement patterns of appetitively-reinforced behaviour. This phenomenon has been described as an extinction-like pattern of responding and used as evidence for the hypothesis that these drugs attenuate the rewarding properties of food, water and electrical stimulation of the brain. The present study was carried out to investigate within-session patterns of responding maintained by food presentation or shock avoidance after administration of a variety of neuroleptic and non-neuroleptic drugs. Haloperidol, metoclopramide, pimozide and butaclamol produced within-session response decrements of both food-reinforced lever pressing and one-way shock avoidance. The atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine did not consistently produce similar effects nor did the alpha-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, the opiate agonist morphine, the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide and the muscle relaxant methocarbamol, although all these drugs were tested up to doses which markedly disrupted responding. Thus, within-session response decrement patterns are a characteristic effect of dopamine-blocking neuroleptic drugs. However, because of the generally similar effects of these drugs on appetitively- and aversively-motivated behaviour, these effects are probably best interpreted as actions on motor, rather than motivational, mechanisms."
