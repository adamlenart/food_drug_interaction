A retrospective study was carried out with the purpose of ascertaining if there is an association between falls and psychoactive medication use among older residents of a community in Brazil.", 
    "1": "All residents aged 65+ (n=161) of one neighborhood of Campo Belo, Brazil (population of 48,000) were evaluated regarding the use of psychoactive drugs and the occurrence of falls in the 12 months preceding the study. Vision and hearing screenings were also performed.", 
    "2": "From the study population, 9.3% were taking prolonged half-life benzodiazepines, 4.4% anticonvulsants (mostly barbiturates), 2.5% antidepressants (all cyclics) and 8.1% alpha-methyldopa. No subject reported use of hypnotics, neuroleptics or drugs to treat Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases (except biperiden). As a whole, drugs that increase the risk of falls were used by 1/5 of this population. In the 12-month period preceding the study, 27 residents (16.8%) experienced falls and, of those, 4 (14.8%) had fracture(s). There was an independent association between psychoactive drug use and falls when variables such as age, gender, vision and hearing were controlled (p=0.02).", 
    "3": "Although the population of this neighborhood must be considered young (only 4% are 65 years old or more), there are already problems related to the use of psychoactive drugs among people. Prescribed anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants and antihypertensives are not appropriate for this age group and their use is associated with falls.", 
    "4": "This article is a transcription of an electronic symposium sponsored by the Brazilian Society of Neuroscience and Behavior (SBNeC). Invited researchers from the European Union, North America and Brazil discussed two issues on anxiety, namely whether panic is a very intense anxiety or something else, and what aspects of clinical anxiety are reproduced by animal models. Concerning the first issue, most participants agreed that generalized anxiety and panic disorder are different on the basis of clinical manifestations, drug response and animal models. Also, underlying brain structures, neurotransmitter modulation and hormonal changes seem to involve important differences. It is also common knowledge that existing animal models generate different types of fear/anxiety. A challenge for future research is to establish a good correlation between animal models and nosological classification.", 
    "5": "Novel chiral selectors 3-5 were prepared by regioselective nucleophilic substitution of 2,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene-1,3-dicarbonitrile (TCBDC, 1) at C(4) by (1R,2R)-trans-diaminocyclohexane, followed by acylation of the intermediary 2 with carboxylic acids containing pi-acid or pi-basic unit. On substitution of the second chlorine atom by the spacer 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES), a 1:1 mixture of regioisomers of N-(([3, 6-dichloro-2,4-dicyano-5-(4,4,4-triethoxy-4-silabutyl)-amino]phenyl)amino) cyclo-hexylcarboxamides and N-(5,6-dichloro-2,4-dicyano-3-(4,4,4-triethoxy-4-silabutyl)-amino]pheny) amino)cyclohexylcarboxamides (6/7, 8/9, 10/11) was obtained. Their covalent binding to Nucleosil 100-5 provided three new chiral stationary phases (CSP-1-CSP-3). NMR spectra of model compounds 12-14 and MM2 calculations on model compounds 15,16 revealed pi-pi interactions between persubstituted benzene ring and second aromatic ring. The results of the evaluation of new CSPs in the separation of 23 test racemates by HPLC are reported. CSP-2 and CSP-3, that have lower conformational freedom than CSP-1, allow for better separation. In particular, good results are obtained in the separation of some 1,4-benzodiazepines and open-chain aromatic amides by CSP-2 and CSP-3.", 
    "6": "Determining the prognosis in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is complicated by several factors: under-recognition of NCSE with its spontaneous resolution (thus decreasing the \"denominator\" of total cases that will have a poor outcome); incorrect diagnosis of NCSE based on misinterpretation of EEG \"epileptiform\" activity; mis-classification of certain EEG patterns as NCSE (e.g. PLEDs; triphasic waves); and grouping of different populations that have markedly different co-morbidities (ambulatory patients with NCSE together with comatose patients with electrographic seizure activity on EEG). There are almost no prospective studies with premorbid neuropsychometric studies, and retrospective studies typically include isolated cases, or case series that include conditions in which the cause of NCSE itself causes cognitive morbidity. To summarize available data, absence status (ambulatory generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus) would appear to carry no lasting morbidity. Complex partial status epilepticus in ambulatory patients rarely results in measurable permanent neurologic deficit, although rarely, short or long-standing deficits may clearly occur. Because intensive treatment with intravenous anticonvulsants (e.g. benzodiazepines or phenytoin) can confer morbidity, the equation has not yet been made as to whether the morbidity of such intensive treatment for all cases of NCSE exceeds the morbidity of the disease itself. Larger, prospective studies will be needed to truly determine the prognosis in the different types of NCSE, stratified according to associated degrees of impairment (minimally impaired, moderately obtunded, comatose).", 
    "7": "Fixed combinations of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) with a benzodiazepine (BZD) for the treatment of depressive syndromes enjoy remarkable acceptance among patients and prescribing physicians. In order to investigate if the widespread use of one such fixed TCA-BZD combination might be due to its high positive reinforcing effect, we tested each drug alone and in combination in an operant conditioning paradigm (fixed ratio 1 time-out 150 s) of intravenous self-administration in rats and compared their reinforcing effects to that of cocaine. Diazepam proved to be of only moderate reinforcing strength. Dothiepin alone was ineffective as a reinforcer but essentially abolished the reinforcing effect of diazepam when given in combination with it. These data indicate that the widespread acceptance of the fixed diazepam-dothiepin combination by the therapeutic community is not due to an increase in the positive reinforcing effect of diazepam by dothiepin but that, in contrast, addition of dothiepin might even decrease diazepam's moderately positive reinforcing effect.", 
    "8": "Economic concepts can be used to assess how drug prices affect consumption patterns. Increases in price for a commodity typically result in reductions in consumption. Demand is considered elastic if decreases in consumption are proportionally greater than increases in price, and inelastic if they are proportionally smaller than rises in price. The price of one commodity can also affect consumption of others. Commodities can function as substitutes, complements or independents, and these concepts refer to increases, decreases, or no change in the consumption of one item as the price of another increases. This study evaluated the effects of drug prices on hypothetical drug-purchasing decisions in 53 alcohol abusers. Experiments 1, 2, and 3 examined how alcohol, cocaine, and Valium prices, respectively, influenced purchases of alcohol, cocaine, Valium, heroin, marijuana and nicotine. As price of alcohol rose in Experiment 1, alcohol purchases decreased and demand for alcohol was inelastic. Cocaine was a complement to alcohol, but other drugs purchases were independent of alcohol prices. In Experiment 2, demand for cocaine was elastic as its price increased. Alcohol was a substitute for cocaine, but other drug purchases did not change significantly. In Experiment 3, demand for Valium was elastic as its price rose, and all other drug purchases were independent of Valium prices. Hypothetical choices were reliable between and within subjects and associated with urinalysis results and lifetime histories of drug abuse. These results suggest that, among alcohol abusers, cocaine is a complement to alcohol, but alcohol is a substitute for cocaine.", 
    "9": "The possible effect of different cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists (MK-329 and L-365260) on the maintenance and reactivation of morphine conditioned place preference (CPP) were investigated in rats, respectively. The results show that the maintenance of morphine CPP could be induced by injection of morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) once for 3 days and this effects were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with 1 but not by 0.1 mg/kg L-365260. Furthermore, following a 28-day extinction, the morphine CPP disappeared and then reactivated again by a single injection of morphine (10 mg/kg). Pretreatment with L-365260 (1 and 0.1 mg/kg) significantly blocked this reactivation of morphine CPP. In contrast, pretreatment of MK-329 (1 and 0.1 mg/kg) failed to do so. The present study demonstrated that CCK-B receptor but not CCK-A receptor is involved in the maintenance and reactivation of morphine CPP. These findings suggest that CCK-B receptor antagonists might be of some value in the treatment and prevention of relapse to drug dependence long after detoxification.", 
    "10": "It has been repeatedly reported that NMDA receptors may contribute to ethanol-induced discriminative stimulus effects and withdrawal syndrome. However, the role of NMDA receptors in the reinforcing properties of ethanol remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to evaluate effects of the novel low-affinity, uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, 1-amino-1,3,3,5,5-pentamethyl-cyclohexane hydrochloride (MRZ 2/579), on ethanol self-administration and ethanol withdrawal-associated seizures in rats. Both an operant (lever pressing for ethanol) and non-operant two-bottle choice setups were employed to initiate ethanol self-administration. In another procedure, forced treatment with high doses (9--15 g/kg/day) was used to induce physical dependence on ethanol. MRZ 2/579 delivered chronically by osmotic minipumps (9.6 mg/day, s.c.) did not alter either operant or non-operant ethanol drinking behaviour in a maintenance phase of ethanol self-administration. In contrast, repeated daily injections of the drug (5 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a progressive decrease in operant responding for ethanol. MRZ 2/579 (0.5--7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and another low-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist, memantine (1--10 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently suppressed ethanol withdrawal seizures with efficacies comparable with that of a standard benzodiazepine derivative, diazepam. The results of the present study indicate that: (i) intermittent administration of MRZ 2/579 may lead to a gradual decrease of operant responding for ethanol; and (ii) the group of low-affinity uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists may be an interesting alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "11": "The type A receptor for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), or GABA(A) receptor, is a pentamer of highly variable quaternary structure. It includes two alpha subunits, drawn from a pool of six genes, which largely determine benzodiazepine pharmacology of the receptor. In brain sections, both [(3)H]RY-80 (ethyl-8-acetylene-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and [(3)H]L-655,708 (ethyl (S)-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-7-methoxy-9-oxo-9H-imidazo[1,5-a]pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate), which are selective for the benzodiazepine site of alpha 5 subunit-containing receptors, showed high-affinity, specific binding, but to fewer regions than did the nonselective benzodiazepine, [(3)H]flunitrazepam. The pattern mirrored alpha 5 mRNA distribution, and was similar to that previously reported for [(3)H]L-655,708 binding. Displacement of [(3)H]RY-80 bound to hippocampal homogenates, and of [(3)H]flunitrazepam bound to cerebellar and hippocampal homogenates showed comparable displacement by flumazenil (K(i)'s 5--7 nM). However, the K(i)'s for diazepam and for clobazam to displace [(3)H]RY-80 binding in hippocampus were about fourfold higher than for [(3)H]flunitrazepam, and the K(i) for clonazepam was sixfold larger, suggesting that these benzodiazepine receptor agonists bind with relatively lower affinity at hippocampal alpha 5-containing receptors.", 
    "12": "The 2,3-benzodiazepine derivative GYKI 52466 has been well characterized as a negative modulator of AMPA-type glutamate receptors. The present study re-examined the effects of GYKI 52466 on AMPA receptor-mediated currents in patches excised from pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 field and found that this drug has positive modulatory effects in addition to its receptor blocking action. A low concentration of GYKI 52466 (10 microM) reliably increased the steady-state current by about three-fold, while the peak current was reduced by 30% only. Higher drug concentrations produced parallel reductions in both the steady-state and peak currents. The increase in the steady-state current was not accompanied by a change in the deactivation time constant and thus, is more likely to result from a change in desensitization than a slowing of channel closing. The results indicate that GYKI 52466 modulates AMPA receptor-mediated currents in a complex manner, perhaps by acting through more than one binding site.", 
    "13": "Previous studies have shown that a wide range of sedative/hypnotic agents, including ethanol, induce sleep when microinjected into the medial preoptic area (MPA) of the anterior hypothalamus. The mechanism by which ethanol acts at this site to induce sleep has not been clear, though possibilities include alterations of chloride channel function in the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or increases in neuronal membrane fluidity. In order to explore the former possibility, we have microinjected into the MPA ethanol 0.24 and 0.47 microM, alone and in combination with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which has no effects on membrane fluidity or voltage-dependent calcium channel function. Ethanol microinjections significantly reduced sleep latency, and tended (P<0.06) to increase total sleep time. Flumazenil given by itself had no significant effects on sleep, but when given in combination with both doses of ethanol, blocked its hypnotic effects. These data suggest that the sleep-inducing action of ethanol microinjections into the MPA is mediated by ethanol-induced alteration of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor function.", 
    "14": "A specific and saturable binding site for [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine ([3H]NMS) was observed in plasma membrane of Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K(d)) of 0.11 +/- 0.02 nM and a concentration of receptor sites (B(max)) of 14.1 +/- 3.9 fmol/mg protein. Pharmacological characterization of this binding site using pirenzepine, himbacine, (11(2-diethyl-amino)methyl)-1-piperidinylacetyl-5-11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(14) benzodiazepine (AF-DX 116), dicyclomine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), and hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSD) showed clear differences, in terms of affinities, between these muscarinic receptor antagonists. The order of potency for inhibiting [3H]NMS binding was HHSD = dicyclomine > 4-DAMP > pirenzepine = himbacine > AF-DX 116. These findings suggest that the muscarinic receptors found in FRT cells belong to the M3 subtype. Stimulation of FRT cells with carbachol produced a biphasic and dose-dependent increase in the intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i), which was blocked in pretreated cells with atropine and almost abolished by a low concentration of 4-DAMP and HHSD. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ from the incubation medium reduced the initial transient peak and completely abolished the plateau phase, while the transient phase was markedly reduced by the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122. These data indicate that [Ca2+]i results from both Ca2+ influx across Ca2+ channels and mobilization of Ca2+ from intracellular Ca2+ stores. The present data showed the presence of the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype in plasma membrane of FRT cells, which may influence cellular function via modulation of [Ca2+]i.", 
    "15": "Alterations in serotonin (5-hydroxytriptamine, 5-HT), norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid have been linked to the pathophysiology of anxiety and depression, and medications that modulate these neurotransmitters are widely used to treat mood disorders. Recently, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its receptor, the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R), have been proposed as possible targets for new antidepressant and anxiolytic therapies. However, animal and human studies have so far failed to provide a clear consensus on the role of SP in the modulation of emotional states. Here we show that both genetic disruption and acute pharmacological blockade of the NK1R in mice result in a marked reduction of anxiety and stress-related responses. These behavioral changes are paralleled by an increase in the firing rate of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, a major source of serotonergic input to the forebrain. NK1R disruption also results in a selective desensitization of 5-HT1A inhibitory autoreceptors, which resembles the effect of sustained antidepressant treatment. Together these results indicate that the SP system powerfully modulates anxiety and suggest that this effect is at least in part mediated by changes in the 5-HT system.",

Most of the patients had prolonged respiratory failure. Nearly half of the patients (47%) received an antidepressant medication while at the facility, and 48% received at least one dose of a benzodiazepine on the first day after transfer. In the sample of 75 patients not prescribed an antidepressant before transfer, 37% were started on therapy with an agent, usually within 3 weeks and predominantly in the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor or psychostimulant class. Younger patients and those evaluated by a mental health specialist were more likely to be prescribed an antidepressant, compared to other patients. Forty percent of patients were still receiving at least one dose of a benzodiazepine in a 24-h period after their third week at the facility.",

The radiosynthesis consisted of N-methylation of the desmethyl precursors 3-methyl-4-phenyl-N-(phenylmethyl)quinoline-2-carboxamide (4a), (+/-)-3-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-4-phenylquinoline-2-carboxamide (5a), and (+/-)-4-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)quinoline-2-carboxamide (6a) with either [11C]methyl iodide or [11C]methyl triflate in the presence of tetrabutylammonium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide in dimethylformamide. The radioligands [11C]4, [11C]5, and [11C]6 were synthesized with over 99% radiochemical purity in 30 min, 30 +/- 5% radiochemical yield, calculated at the end of synthesis (EOS) non-decay-corrected, and 2.5 +/- 1.2 Ci/micromol of specific radioactivity. Inhibition studies in rats following intravenous pre-administration of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK 11195, 1) showed high specific binding to PBR of [11C]4, [11C]5, and [11C]6 in heart, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, spleen, and brain. The biological data suggest that [11C]5, [11C]6, and particularly [11C]4 are promising radioligands for PBR imaging in vivo with PET.", 
    "24": "The experimental class III antiarrhythmic drug, L-768673, prolongs the refractory period of cardiac myocytes by selectively blocking the slow-activating delayed rectifying potassium (I(Ks)) channel. The I(Ks) channel has also been identified in vestibular dark cells and in the marginal cells of the stria vascularis. In the stria vascularis, the I(Ks) channel plays an important role in cochlear homeostasis. Genetic null deletion of the I(Ks) channel in mice and man results in profound hearing loss and cochlear pathology. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of L-768673 on the auditory function and cochlear morphology in rats using auditory brainstem-evoked response and light microscopy. Auditory testing was performed one week prior to dosing, following 14 days of administration and 28 days after the completion of dosing. L-768673 (50 or 250 mg/kg/day for 14 days), had no significant effects on auditory function or cochlear morphology. The results of this study suggest that high doses of L-768673 are not toxic to the inner ear of adult rats treated for 14 consecutive days, and that the ototoxic potential of orally administered L-768673 and similar I(Ks)-selective compounds is unlikely at doses within the therapeutic range.", 
    "25": "An open pilot study on the safety and efficacy of melatonin in the treatment of insomniac patients was conducted in 22 subjects (16 females), mean +/- S.D. age 60.1 +/- 9.5 years. All patients received 3 mg of gelatin melatonin capsules per os daily for 6 months, 30 min before expected sleep time. Twenty of 22 patients were on benzodiazepine treatment and they continued this treatment for part of or for the entire melatonin administration period. Serum concentrations of prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), or estradiol were measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) in morning samples at the beginning and after 6 months of melatonin administration, and standard clinical laboratory tests for blood components were performed. Urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) excretion was measured by RIA before treatment. Serum concentrations of prolactin, FSH, TSH, or estradiol did not exhibit changes after 6 months of melatonin administration, nor were any indications of hematologic or blood biochemistry alteration found. Melatonin augmented significantly the quality and duration of sleep, and decreased sleep latency and the number of awakening episodes, as assessed from sleep logs filled by the patients (first 21 days) and from structured interviews performed by incumbent physicians (up to 6 months). Estimates of next-day function (i.e., alertness in the morning and during the day) also improved significantly during melatonin treatment. The observed effect lasted for the entire period examined (up to 6 months), with 22 out of 22 patients showing improved sleep at the end of treatment. The urinary excretion of aMT6s before starting administration of melatonin correlated negatively and significantly with age, but not with the intensity of sleep the disorder or the outcome of treatment. In 13 of 20 patients taking benzodiazepines together with melatonin, benzodiazepine use could be stopped, and in another four patients, benzodiazepine dose could be decreased to 25-66% of the initial dose. The results of this open, subacute administration trial indicate that melatonin is a safe and useful treatment for sleep disturbances in middle-aged or elderly patients, either by itself or together with benzodiazepines.", 
    "26": "In a double-blind, randomised trial, we compared the effects of pretreatment with midazolam at two different doses (0.025 and 0.05 mg x kg(-1)), with placebo, on the induction dose requirements of propofol in two different age groups. We enrolled 120 patients: 60 younger patients (aged 18-35 years) and 60 older patients (aged over 60 years). All patients received 0.75 microg x kg(-1) of fentanyl, plus a blinded pretreatment with either saline or one of two doses of midazolam. Induction continued with a fixed rate infusion of propofol. Propofol dose requirement was recorded, as were cardiovascular parameters and the occurrence of significant apnoea (> 60 s). Midazolam pretreatment was associated with a significant reduction in propofol dose requirement in both younger and older patients. The reduction in older patients was significantly greater than the equivalent response in younger groups. There was no demonstrable benefit in terms of improved cardiovascular stability or reduction in the incidence of apnoea. Caution is advised in the use of midazolam as an agent for co-induction with propofol in the elderly.", 
    "27": "Both propofol and midazolam are known to inhibit immune function. The aim of this study was to investigate cytokine production in critically ill surgical patients as early markers of immune response to prolonged infusion of propofol and midazolam. The study enrolled 40 elective patients who were to receive long-term sedation for more than 2 days. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two equally sized groups. Central venous blood samples for measurement of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-2 (IL-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were drawn prior to the start and after 48 h of infusion. After 48 h, propofol caused significant increases in IL-1beta (24%), IL-6 (23%) and TNF-alpha (4.8 times) levels, while midazolam caused significant decreases in IL-1beta (21%), IL-6 (21%) and TNF-alpha (19%). Both agents caused significant decreases in IL-8 levels (propofol: 30%, midazolam: 48%, p < 0.05). Propofol caused significant decreases in IL-2 levels (68%, p < 0.001) but increases in IFN-gamma (30%, p < 0.05), whereas there was no significant change with midazolam compared with the pre-infusion level. In conclusion, during 48 h of continuous infusion, propofol stimulated, while midazolam suppressed, the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, and both caused suppression of IL-8 production. Propofol inhibited IL-2 production and stimulated IFN-gamma production, whereas midazolam failed to do so. Therefore, sedative agents may have clinical implications in high-risk and immunocompromised patients.",

    "33": "Previous studies have reported intravenous cocaine self-administration behavior in several strains of mice with the exception of BALB/cByJ, a strain considered a mouse model of high emotional reactivity. The present experiments further investigated acquisition of self-administration in BALB/cByJ mice using a low dose and a habituation session. Following evidence of an initial drug-seeking behavior, we observed a progressive decline of intravenous self-administration. Pretreatment with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, IP), reinstated cocaine-maintained responding. To test the hypothesis that injections directly into a reward-relevant brain region might support consistent cocaine-seeking behavior, BALB/cByJ mice implanted in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) or the caudate-putamen nucleus (CPu) were trained to discriminate between the arm enabling a microinjection of cocaine (30 pmol/50 nl or 150 pmol/50 nl) and the neutral arm of a Y-maze. Only NAc subjects exhibited a spatial discrimination toward the cocaine-reinforced arm and the D2 antagonist, sulpiride (50 mg/kg, IP) eliminated intra-NAc cocaine self-administration. However, after several days of cocaine self-injection, animals developed an approach/avoidance-like behavior between the start box and the reinforced arm. This behavior was suppressed by systemic diazepam (1 mg/kg, IP) pretreatment. We conclude that: (1) medio-ventral NAc is involved both in the rewarding (via a D2 dopaminergic mechanism) and aversive effects of cocaine in mice; and (2) anxiolytic pretreatment (diazepam) indirectly enhanced the reinforcing properties of cocaine in BALB/cByJ, suggesting that emotionality can act as a protective mechanism against stimulant abuse.", 
    "34": "Previous studies have suggested that activation of calcium-phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) enhances benzodiazepine (BZD)- and pentobarbital (PB)- mediated potentiation of alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs). To delineate the underlying mechanism(s), voltage-clamp recordings were performed on recombinant alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors functionally expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. GABA(A)-Rs were tested for their sensitivity to diazepam and PB before and after incubation in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). PMA (25 nM) significantly attenuated the GABA(A) current (p<0.05, n=12-19) up to 90%. PMA treatment, however, did not alter the sensitivity to diazepam or pentobarbital. Similar results were obtained with recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA receptors. These data suggest that PKC activation does not alter the allosteric modulation of GABA(A)-Rs by benzodiazepines and barbiturates and is consistent with the observation from other studies in oocytes that PMA decreases the amplitude of the GABA-activated currents via receptor internalization rather than modification of receptor kinetics.", 
    "35": "The selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, 2-(R)-(1-(R)-3,5-Bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluoro)phenyl-4-(3-oxo-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)methylmorpholine (MK-869), has been recently described as a novel therapeutic approach for anxiety/depression. A frequently used model to establish the central nervous system (CNS) activity of tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists is the inhibition of NK1 agonist-induced foot tapping in gerbils. In the present study, we demonstrate that foot tapping can also be induced in most, but not all, gerbils by footshock and associated cues. MK-869 (0.3-3 mg/kg, i.p.) dose-dependently blocked this foot tapping response. This effect was further shown to be due to selective NK1 receptor blockade, since (2S,3S)-cis-3(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine (CP-99,994; 3 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited foot tapping, whereas its less active enantiomer (2R,3R)-cis-3(2-methoxybenzylamino)-2-phenylpiperidine (CP-100,263; 3 mg/kg, i.p.) had no effect. Diazepam (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) also inhibited foot tapping, whereas fluoxetine (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.) markedly increased this behaviour. The present data support the view that foot tapping in the gerbil is a behavioural response to an aversive stimulus, and is robustly inhibited by two NK1 receptor antagonists. The data support a role for tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonists as novel anxiolytic/antidepressants.", 
    "36": "The study in an ethological perspective of inbred strains of mice offers a more accurate description of anxiety-related behavior. In this context, behavioral performances of the BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J strains were systematically compared in the staircase test, the light/dark test and the elevated plus maze test. A rarely used variable, the latency of the first entry in the dark box, was also recorded in the light/dark test. A new statistical approach to this measure meant that specific avoidance strategies could be differentiated in the two strains. A study of the behavioral responses of the two strains given treatment with diazepam, a widely used anxiolytic compound, was also carried out. Results showed substantial differences between BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J strains. C57BL/6J mice had high baseline activity and exploration of a new environment, suggesting a low level of anxiety. BALB/cByJ mice displayed defensive and protective behavior, with limited exploration of the new environment together with low locomotor activity. The response to diazepam was also different for each strain: C57BL/6J mice showed higher sensitivity to diazepam treatment than did BALB/cByJ mice.", 
    "37": "The cyclodextrin solubilization of three benzodiazepines, i.e. alprazolam, midazolam and triazolam, was investigated. The cyclodextrin solubilization was enhanced through ring-opening of the benzodiazepine rings and ionization of the ring-open forms. Additional enhancement was obtained through interaction of a water-soluble polymer with the cyclodextrin complexes. The ring-opening was pH-dependent and completely reversible, the ring-open forms dominating at low pH but the ring-closed forms at physiologic pH. The ring-closed forms were rapidly regenerated upon elevation of pH. In freshly collected human serum in vitro at 37 degrees C, the half-life for the first-order rate constant for the ring-closing reaction was estimated to be less than 2 min for both alprazolam and midazolam. Midazolam (17 mg/ml) was solubilized in aqueous pH 4.3 nasal formulation containing 14% (w/v) sulfobutylether beta-cyclodextrin, 0.1% (w/v) hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, preservatives and buffer salts. Six healthy volunteers received 0.06 mg/kg midazolam intranasally and 2 mg intravenously, and blood samples were collected up to 360 min after the administration. Midazolam was absorbed rapidly reaching maximum serum concentrations of 54.3+/-5.0 ng/ml at 15+/-2 min. The elimination half-life of midazolam was 2.2+/-0.3 h and the absolute availability was 73+/-7%. All mean values+/-SEM.", 
    "38": "Gamma-ainobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor ionophore ligand t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) was used in an autoradiographic assay on brain cryostat sections to visualize and characterize atypical GABA-insensitive [35S]TBPS binding previously described in certain recombinant GABA(A) receptors and the cerebellar granule cell layer. Picrotoxinin-sensitive but 1-mM GABA-insensitive [35S]TBPS binding was present in the rat cerebellar granule cell layer, many thalamic nuclei, subiculum and the internal rim of the cerebral cortex, amounting in these regions up to 6% of the basal binding determined in the absence of exogenous GABA. Similar binding properties were detected also in human and chicken brain sections. Like the GABA-sensitive [35S]TBPS binding, GABA-insensitive binding was profoundly decreased by pentobarbital, pregnanolone, loreclezole and Mg2+. The binding was reversible and apparently dependent on Cl- ions. Localization of the GABA-insensitive [35S]TBPS binding was not identical to that of high-affinity [3H]muscimol binding and diazepam-insensitive [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding, two previously established receptor subtype-dependent binding heterogeneities in the rat brain. The present study reveals a component of the GABA-ionophore enriched in the thalamus and cerebellar granule cells, possibly representing poorly desensitized or desensitizing receptors.", 
    "39": "Benzodiazepine hypnotics increase NREM sleep and alter its EEG by reducing delta (0.3-3 Hz) and increasing sigma (12-15 Hz) and beta (15-23 Hz) activity. We tested whether the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, zolpidem (10 mg), produced the same pattern of sleep and EEG changes as two \"classical\" benzodiazepines, triazolam (0.25 mg) and temazepam (30 mg). Sleep EEG of 16 subjects was analyzed with period amplitude analysis for 3 nights during drug administration or placebo. The effects of zolpidem were in the same direction but generally of smaller magnitude than those of the classical benzodiazepines. These differences are more likely the result of non-equivalent dosages than different pharmacologic actions. Period amplitude analysis showed that the decreased delta activity resulted mainly from a decrease in wave amplitude. In contrast, the increased sigma and beta activity were produced by increased wave incidence. Delta suppression increased with repeated drug administration but sigma and beta stimulation did not. While these findings have little relevance for the clinical choice of hypnotics they may hold important implications for the brain mechanisms involved in hypnotic tolerance and withdrawal delirium.", 
    "40": "Intranasal (i.n.) midazolam (MDZ) administrations may be used successfully for preoperative sedation, especially in young patients. However, clinicians have to use the commercial parenteral formulation, the low pH of which (3.3), necessary to solubilize MDZ (pK(a) 6.1), is probably responsible for the signs of local irritation frequently reported. As a starting point to design a formulation suitable for the nasal route, MDZ nasal absorption was investigated in rats. The effects of the MDZ solution concentration (10--100 microg/ml), osmolality (from less than 10 mOsm/kg up to 450 mOsm/kg) and pH (3.3--7.4) were studied using an in situ perfusion technique. MDZ was determined by reversed-phase HPLC in the circulating solution and results were expressed in clearance terms. MDZ absorption was independent of its concentration. The pH of the solutions was the key-parameter and only a pH above 4 allowed significant absorption. These results were consistent with a passive diffusion absorption of MDZ and partly followed the pH partition theory. In conclusion, satisfactory MDZ absorption should be expected with a formulation at a pH suitable for the nasal route in human (5.5--6.5).", 
    "41": "This study investigated the effect of chronic benzodiazepine (BZD) administration and its abrupt discontinuation on later subsequent ethanol consumption employing a free choice paradigm between water and increasing ethanol concentrations. In addition, we also studied the anxiolytic and reinforcing properties of ethanol assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and in the conditioned place preference paradigm, respectively. Adult male Wistar rats were subjected to a chronic diazepam (DZM) treatment (2 mg/kg/day, i.p.) during 21 days. Twenty-four hours after that treatment and, in another experiment, 10 days after the last DZM injection, rats were subjected to an oral ethanol self-administration procedure (ethanol was increased in concentration (v/v) on 4 consecutive days as follows: 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% followed by an additional period of 8 days in which animals were offered a 10% (v/v) ethanol solution. Diazepam treated rats showed a higher ethanol intake and spontaneous signs of ethanol withdrawal when the access to ethanol was discontinued. These results were observed when ethanol was available at day 1 of withdrawal but not when DZM treated rats were initiated in the ethanol choice test 10 days after BDZ withdrawal. Furthermore, DZM treated rats exhibited an increased anxiolytic ethanol induced effect (1 g/kg, i.p.) in the EPM and a significant ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (1 g/kg, i.p.). These data suggest that early DZM treatment facilitates ethanol consumption and the development of ethanol dependence.", 
    "42": "The 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 52466, administered intracerebrally or systemically, was assessed for its ability to protect against the neuronal death in the brain caused by intra-hippocampal injections of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor agonists, kainate and L-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA). In contrast to a previous report, a low intra-hippocampal dose of GYKI 52466 (25 nmol) did not protect against kainate toxicity. In order to achieve higher doses of GYKI 52466, solubilization in 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin was used, and limited protection against AMPA, but not kainate toxicity was found. There was a commensurate reduction in seizure-related neuronal loss in the limbic regions of the brain. When diazepam was used to prevent seizures, GYKI 52466 had no effect on hippocampal neuronal loss caused by the direct toxicity of AMPA and kainate on hippocampal neurons. Systemic administration of GYKI 52466 had only a minimal effect on preventing neuronal death caused by AMPA. In vivo, GYKI 52466 is only weakly effective as a neuroprotective agent.", 
    "43": "Two maintenance drugs had been used in France since 1996, methadone and high-dosage buprenorphine. This study aimed to examine changes in drug use from observations gathered between 1995 and 1997, within the framework of the French program for the monitoring of drug dependence (OPPIDUM). This annual survey studies psychoactive substances consumed by drug addicts attending specialised drug care centres. During the last three surveys, 16 centres collected a total of 1597 patient-files. This study shows an increase in the number of patients undergoing maintenance treatment (from 14 to 69%), a reduction in the number of intravenous drug users (from 55 to 22%) and a reduction in consumption of psychoactive substances. However, poly-drug addiction behaviour continues and high-dose buprenorphine subjects frequently use the substance intravenously and in association with benzodiazepines.", 
    "44": "This study compared the discriminative stimulus effects of zolpidem, a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, to benzodiazepines. Eight participants learned to discriminate triazolam (0.35 mg/70 kg) from placebo. The discriminative stimulus effects, self-reported subjective effects, and performance effects of triazolam (0.05-0.35 mg/70 kg), alprazolam (0.25-1.75 mg/70 kg), zolpidem (2.5-35 mg/70 kg) and caffeine (75-525 mg/70 kg) were assessed under two-response and novel-response drug discrimination procedures. Under the two-response procedure, triazolam, alprazolam and zolpidem fully substituted for triazolam and caffeine did not. Under the novel-response procedure, triazolam and alprazolam substituted for triazolam and zolpidem partially substituted for triazolam. Zolpidem, but not triazolam or alprazolam, also produced some novel responding. Caffeine produced both placebo-appropriate and novel responding. The self-reported effects of triazolam, alprazolam and zolpidem were similar. Overall, zolpidem produced similar, but not identical, effects as the benzodiazepines.", 
    "45": "The pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist panadiplon were assessed in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate pentobarbital (10 mg/kg) from saline. In test sessions, pentobarbital and the benzodiazepine full agonist triazolam engendered near 100% drug-appropriate responding in all monkeys, whereas panadiplon engendered near 100% drug-appropriate responding in two of four monkeys. Panadiplon pretreatment resulted in leftward shifts in the pentobarbital dose-response function but predominantly rightward shifts of the triazolam dose-response function. These results are consistent with findings that benzodiazepine partial agonists have pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus effects in some subjects only, and further suggest that partial agonists enhance the effects of pentobarbital but antagonize the effects of a benzodiazepine full agonist.", 
    "46": "Several studies have indicated that acquiring discriminative stimulus control for a certain anxiolytic drug influences its subsequent anti-conflict properties. To further elaborate on the question whether drug discrimination procedures affect behaviour in a conflict paradigm, a classical two-lever drug discrimination procedure was combined with an operant conflict procedure within the same animals. To this extent, rats were trained to discriminate the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 30 mg/kg, po) from saline (SAL), and subsequently punished responding periods were introduced within the same session. In addition to the rats that were trained to discriminate CDP from vehicle, a group of rats was trained on a random relationship between CDP and the rewarded lever. CDP and alprazolam completely substituted for CDP, whereas mianserin did not. Responding during punished components in a session was increased by CDP and alprazolam, but not by mianserin in rats that were trained to discriminate CDP from vehicle and in randomly trained rats. The data indicate that rats can be reliably trained and tested in drug discrimination and conflict procedures within a single session and that CDP's discriminative stimulus does not alter its anti-conflict effects.", 
    "47": "Impulsive and aggressive behaviors in, e.g., personality or substance abuse disorders in man and corresponding behaviors in rats may involve serotonin (5-HT), gamma-amino-butyric acid(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes (GABA(A)/BDZ-RC) and steroid hormones, e.g., testosterone. Here, we studied the effect of gonadectomy on disinhibitory behavior in individually housed 5-HT-depleted rats and on GABA(A)/BDZ-RC function in vitro, in corticohippocampal synaptoneurosomes prepared from the brain of these animals. 5-HT depletion by intracerebroventricular 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT)-induced disinhibitory behavior in a shock-induced behavioral inhibition model (punished conflict model) 14 days after operation. Gonadectomy in connection with the 5-HT depletion reduced the disinhibitory behavior and testosterone substitution prevented this effect. Shock threshold and drinking motivation were not affected by gonadectomy and/or 5-HT depletion. The relative epididymides weight was increased in 5-HT-depleted as compared to sham-operated rats. However, the serum concentrations of testosterone and the relative testes weights were not different in 5-HT-depleted rats as compared to controls. GABA-induced (30, 100, 300 microM) 36Cl(-)-uptake into synaptoneurosomes was lower in 5,7-DHT+gonadectomized rats compared to the control group. This effect was reversed by substitution with testosterone. These results demonstrate that gonadectomy reduces disinhibitory behavior in 5-HT-depleted rats and that GABA(A)/BDZ-RC may be involved in this effect.", 
    "48": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of devazepide (DEV), a cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist, which crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and prevents the development of a preferential relationship with the dam, and compare it to that of 2-NAP, which acts peripherally. At birth, lambs received either an intraperitoneal injection of saline (CTL), DEV (0.1 mg/kg), or 2-NAP (0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg). No major side effects were observed after the injection, however, there was a trend for lambs receiving CCK-A antagonists to be more vocal in the first 2 h and to loose more weight between birth and 3 h. When tested in a two-choice test situations at 24 h of age, the latency to reach a ewe and the total time spent next to them were not affected by the treatments. On the other hand, unlike CTLs, lambs receiving DEV or 0.1 mg of 2-NAP did not spend significantly more time near their dam than near the alien ewe. 2-NAP had no effect at 0.01 mg/kg, but at 1 mg/kg, it improved the preference score. There was no relationship between preference scores and the variations in weight recorded during the neonatal period. The effects of DEV, but not those of 2-NAP, persisted at 48 h of age. Thus, these results support the hypothesis that peripheral CCK receptors are involved in the development of a preference for the mother, but the effects differ according to the amount of 2-NAP that the lambs receive.", 
    "49": "Honokiol has previously been shown to be an effective anxiolytic-like agent in mice when administered for 7 days at 0.2 mg/kg/day prior to evaluation in an elevated plus-maze, while 20 mg/kg is required for efficacy as a single oral dose. The aim of this study was to find analogs of honokiol that are more effective for acute administration. Among the eight analogs evaluated, one partially reduced derivative of honokiol [3'-(2-propenyl)-5-propyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-2,4'-diol] exhibited significant anxiolytic-like activity at 0.04 mg/kg. Following oral administration of 1 mg/kg of this analog, anxiolytic-like activity was clearly evident at 1 h, peaked at 3 h, and remained significant for longer than 4 h after treatment. Combined administration of the derivative with diazepam led to enhanced anxiolytic-like efficacy. Moreover, as with diazepam, the anxiolytic-like effect of the analog was reduced by flumazenil. In contrast, bicuculline, a GABA(A) antagonist, had no effect on the activity of the derivative. Taken together, these results suggest that this analog of honokiol acts at the benzodiazepine recognition site of the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "50": "Effect of saiboku-to, an oriental herbal medicine, on anxiety in mice was investigated using a light/dark test. Anxiogenic- and anxiolytic-like effects were evaluated on the basis of shortened and prolonged time spent in the light zone of the test. Subacute administration (once a day for 7 days) of saiboku-to (0.5-2.0 g/kg, p.o.) induced anxiolytic-like effect. To assess the effect of saiboku-to on brain histaminergic system in a state of anxiety, Compound 48/80 (1.0 microg/2 microl, i.c.v.), a non-neuronal mast cell histamine releaser, or thioperamide (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), a neuronal histamine releaser possessing the inhibitory effect of histamine H(3) autoreceptors, induced decrease in the time spent in the light zone by co-injection with cimetidine (10.0 microg/2 microl, i.c.v.), a H(2) inhibitor, suggesting anxiety-like effect. These histaminergics-induced experimental anxieties were inhibited by pre-treatment with subacute administration of saiboku-to, as well as single treatment with diazepam. The results suggest that saiboku-to exhibits anxiolytic-like effect closely related to histaminergic system in the brain.", 
    "51": "Although GABA(A) receptor positive modulators share many behavioral effects, subtle differences have been detected among their discriminative stimulus effects. The purpose of the present study was to determine the extent of shared discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone with various benzodiazepine receptor ligands and with ethanol. Naive male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate the endogenous neuroactive steroid pregnanolone (5.6 or 8.0 mg/kg) from vehicle. The benzodiazepine receptor agonists, triazolam and lorazepam, the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist, bretazenil, the benzodiazepine1 (BZ1) receptor subtype selective agonists, zolpidem and zaleplon and ethanol were tested. Triazolam, lorazepam and bretazenil substituted for pregnanolone. Lorazepam, but not triazolam or bretazenil, decreased response rates at the highest dose tested. Zaleplon completely substituted for pregnanolone with no effect on response rates. Zolpidem substituted for pregnanolone only at a dose that severely disrupted response rates. Ethanol partially substituted for pregnanolone and decreased response rates. The results are consistent with GABA(A) receptor mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone. The effects on response rates suggest subtle differentiation among the GABA(A) receptor-mediated cues.", 
    "52": "The possible involvement of an endogenous benzodiazepine (BZ) inverse agonist in the activational effects of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) on behaviour was examined in pigs given porcine CRH (75 microg) intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) and the BZ antagonist flumazenil (FLU; 0.09 mg/kg) intravenously (i.v.). In Experiment 1, behaviour was recorded for 75 min in pigs (n=5) given i.v. FLU or saline (SAL) followed by i.c.v. CRH or vehicle (VEH). Significant changes in arousal, posture and oro-nasal activity were induced by CRH, whereas FLU alone had no effect but appeared to reduce some responses to CRH. In Experiment 2, behaviour was observed for 60 min in pigs (n=6) given i.c.v. CRH followed by i.v. FLU, VEH or diazepam (DZ; 0.2 mg/kg). Behavioural responses to CRH, however, were unaffected by FLU, whereas certain aspects of arousal, posture and oro-nasal activity were reduced by DZ; a higher dose of DZ (0.3 mg/kg) given before CRH tended to enhance these inhibitory effects. All treatments also produced similar increases in plasma cortisol. Taken together with previous findings, the negligible effect of FLU in this study suggests that endogenous ligands for the BZ binding site on the GABA(A) receptor are of little importance in regulating the behavioural actions of CRH in swine.", 
    "53": "Social stress induces robust behavioral and physiological changes, some of which may alter the responsiveness to pharmacological agents, including diazepam (DZP). We used a resident-intruder paradigm to (1) develop a comprehensive ethogram of behavioral changes following social defeat (SD) in the socially reactive strain, DBA/2 male mice, (2) determine whether acute exposure of DBA/2 mice to low-dose DZP would induce flight or aggressive behavior, both of which have been observed in other rodent models and (3) to test whether prior social stress affects responses to DZP. Behavioral responses to a nonaggressive intruder (NAI) mouse 24 h post-SD were measured in resident subject mice exposed to DZP (0, 0.5, 2.0 mg/kg, ip) either prior to the resident-intruder test (Experiment 1) or immediately post-SD (Experiment 2); control mice were not defeated (NOSD). In general, SD mice displayed increased passive and active avoidance, defense, immobility, and risk assessment relative to NOSD mice. In Experiment 1, mice treated acutely with 0.5 mg/kg DZP had more approach and flight behavior, while those treated with 2.0 mg/kg DZP had more avoidance than vehicle-treated mice, independent of SD. In Experiment 2, acute DZP (2 mg/kg) induced effects 24 h later, possibly secondary to withdrawal. In a nonsocial context (Experiment 3), DZP increased exploratory activity.", 
    "54": "Various lines of evidence indicate that methamphetamine (METH) self-administration in rats is under dopaminergic control, and NMDA receptors have been shown to control the release of dopamine at its synapse. Consequently, the aim of this study was to observe the effects of dextromethorphan (DM), a non-competitive NMDA antagonist, in rats self-administering METH. The hypothesis was that acute pretreatment of DM (25 mg/kg) would alter response to METH. DM significantly altered self-administration by reducing the number of correct responses for three METH self-administration doses (0.05, 0.1, 0.25 mg/kg). The same pretreatment did not affect responding for food reward. These findings show that the DM was able to selectively alter METH self-administration.",

Amphetamine-induced release of endogenous DA is shown to be enhanced in schizophrenia, as is striatal [18F]FDOPA uptake in the striatum. It is not clear if the density of DA neurons is altered in schizophrenia. By studying the DA transporter with [123I]FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), the density of nigrostriatal dopaminergic cells can be studied. Using [123I]FP-CIT SPECT, DA transporter density in the striatum was studied in 36 young patients with schizophrenia. Ten patients were antipsychotic (AP)-naive, 15 were treated with olanzapine, eight with risperidone and three were AP-free. A control group of 10 age-matched volunteers was included. Striatal [123I]FP-CIT binding was not significantly different between AP-naive patients (2.87), patients treated with olanzapine (2.76), patients treated with risperidone (2.76), AP-free patients (2.68) and controls (2.82) (F=0.07,p=0.98). Unexpectedly, striatal [123I]FP-CIT binding in females was significantly higher than in males (3.29 and 2.70, respectively; t=-2.56, p=0.014).Concluding, functional changes in the dopaminergic system in schizophrenia are not likely to be reflected in a change in DA transporter density. Moreover, DA transporter density does not seem to be altered by AP medication.", 
    "64": "Investigators have found a relationship between the number of previous alcohol withdrawals (AWs) and severity of withdrawal. We evaluated patients with multiple previous AWs, as compared to those with 0-1 previous withdrawals, in an outpatient detoxification trial comparing lorazepam (LZ) to carbamazepine (CBZ). A mixed model analysis of covariance was used to analyze Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised (CIWA-Ar) scores as a function of detoxification history (0-1 vs. 2 or more), drug group (CBZ vs. LZ), assessment day, and hours since last drink. The mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) indicated a significant detoxification history by assessment day interaction (P< or =.03). Least square means associated with this interaction suggested that the CIWA-Ar scores for the multiple detox patients declined more slowly than those with 0-1 previous detoxifications. Patients with multiple detoxes were 150% more likely to experience a heavy drinking day during treatment (P< or =.03). The multiple detox group drank more each drinking day (P=.001) and a greater proportion of this group had early heavy drinking (P=.0002). In the present study, intensity of AW symptoms and early heavy drinking were independent of treatment medications and were more common in patients who had previously undergone multiple treatments for AW.",

Instead, when protonophores were added after cell stimulation, they did not modify [Ca(2+)](c) kinetics and inhibited Ca(2+) release from Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondria. This effect was due to inhibition of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange, because blocking this system with CGP37157 produced no further effect. Increasing extramitochondrial [Ca(2+)](c) triggered fast Ca(2+) release from these depolarized Ca(2+)-loaded mitochondria, both in intact or permeabilized cells. These effects of protonophores were mimicked by valinomycin, but not by nigericin. The observed mitochondrial Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release response was insensitive to cyclosporin A and CGP37157 but fully blocked by ruthenium red, suggesting that it may be mediated by reversal of the Ca(2+) uniporter. This novel kind of mitochondrial Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release might contribute to Ca(2+) clearance from mitochondria that become depolarized during Ca(2+) overload.", 
    "66": "\"Atypical\" antipsychotics represent a new generation of antipsychotics with a significantly lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), as well as little or no effect on prolactin elevation. These advantages constitute a major improvement in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. The exact mechanisms that make these drugs atypical is not clear. However, a preferential action on serotonin 5-HT2 or D4 receptors, or a more rapid dissociation from the dopamine D2 receptor, may account for atypicality. Although the atypical antipsychotics have overcome EPS, other side effects such as weight gain and impaired glucose tolerance/lipid abnormalities have come to the fore. Thus, the challenges are far from over. The current atypicals are much more effective against the psychosis of schizophrenia than against the other, more enduring aspects of this disorder, e.g. negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction. At present, the atypicals use a \"pharmacological shotgun\" strategy to treat aspects of the disease in all patients. A more sophisticated and perhaps effective approach to schizophrenia may lie in independently targeting the pathophysiological mechanisms of each clinical dimension (i.e. positive, negative, cognitive, and affective) with more selective drugs that can be combined and individually titrated to the needs of each patient.", 
    "67": "It is common for health care providers to deal with the complex and difficult issue of withdrawing advanced life support. The patient is always the key source of authority in these decisions. The most important ingredient in end-of-life decision making is effective communication. It is important to try to ascertain what the patient thought about quality-of-life values before surrogate decisions can be made on the patient's behalf. The concepts of beneficence, nonmaleficence, autonomy, and justice are the foundation of ethical decision making. Numerous legal precedents have laid the groundwork for end-of-life decision making. Most state courts have supported withholding and withdrawing life support from patients who will not regain a reasonable quality of life. The recent Patient Self-Determination Act encourages patients to fill out advance directives that state their desires. When continued intensive care is futile, advanced life support should be withdrawn. However, a narrow definition of futility in this situation is the key, since the concept of futility could lead to inappropriate decisions. It is best to consider a situation futile when the patient is terminally ill, the condition is irreversible, and death is imminent. During the withdrawal of advanced life support, terminal or rapid weaning is preferable to extubation. Combinations of opiates, benzodiazepines, and other agents help provide comfort to patients who are suffering.", 
    "68": "The effect of pretreatment with dexamethasone (DEX) on drug-drug interactions between rhodamine 123 (Rho123), a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and midazolam, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate, or verapamil, a P-gp/CYP3A substrate, was studied in rats. Rats were pretreated with DEX (100 mg/kg/day, oral) for 2 days. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody for P-gp, C219, revealed that DEX pretreatment increased P-gp level in the intestine 1.9-fold, but not in the liver. In vitro metabolism study of erythromycin in microsomal suspensions indicated the 9.7-fold increase of CYP3A activity in the liver, but not in the intestine, by DEX pretreatment. In an in vivo study, DEX pretreatment increased P-gp-mediated exsorption clearance of Rho123 from blood to the intestinal lumen approximately 2-fold, but not biliary clearances, in good agreement with the results of Western blot analysis. In untreated rats, midazolam (100 microM) or verapamil (30 or 100 microM) added in the intestinal perfusate (single perfusion) decreased the exsorption clearance and biliary clearance of Rho123 by approximately 30 to 50%. In DEX-pretreated rats, however, the inhibitory potency of midazolam in the liver significantly decreased compared with that in untreated rats, although the potency in the intestine did not change. The inhibitory potency of verapamil decreased both in the intestine and liver by DEX pretreatment. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that DEX pretreatment affects not only P-gp-mediated disposition of Rho123 but also pharmacokinetic interactions of P-gp/CYP3A-related compounds with Rho123, probably because concentrations of substrates/inhibitors at target sites such as the intestine and liver are varied.", 
    "69": "The kinetics of flunitrazepam (FNTZ) N-demethylation to desmethylflunitrazepam (DM FNTZ), and 3-hydroxylation to 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam (3-OH FNTZ), were studied in human liver microsomes and in microsomes containing heterologously expressed individual human CYPs. FNTZ was N-demethylated by cDNA-expressed CYP2A6 (K(m) = 1921 microM), CYP2B6 (K(m) = 101 microM), CYP2C9 (K(m) = 50 microM), CYP2C19 (K(m) = 60 microM), and CYP3A4 (K(m) = 155 microM), and 3-hydroxylated by cDNA-expressed CYP2A6 (K(m) = 298 microM) and CYP3A4 (K(m) = 286 microM). The 3-hydroxylation pathway was predominant in liver microsomes, accounting for more than 80% of intrinsic clearance compared with the N-demethylation pathway. After adjusting for estimated relative abundance, CYP3A accounted for the majority of intrinsic clearance via both pathways. This finding was supported by chemical inhibition studies in human liver microsomes. Formation of 3-OH FNTZ was reduced to 10% or less of control values by ketoconazole (IC(50) = 0.11 microM) and ritonavir (IC(50) = 0.041 microM). Formation of DM FNTZ was inhibited to 40% of control velocity by 2.5 microM ketoconazole and to 30% of control by 2.5 microM ritonavir. Neither 3-OH FNTZ nor DM FNTZ formation was inhibited to less than 85% of control activity by alpha-naphthoflavone (CYP1A2), sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9), omeprazole (CYP2C19), or quinidine (CYP2D6). Thus, CYP-dependent FNTZ biotransformation, like that of many benzodiazepine derivatives, is mediated mainly by CYP3A. Clinical interactions of FNTZ with CYP3A inhibitors can be anticipated.", 
    "70": "1. Previous studies indicate that 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA) neurotoxicity involves the excitotoxic activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Thus, we examined the effect of orphenadrine (an anticholinergic drug with NMDA receptor antagonist properties) on 3-NPA neurotoxicity in both cultured rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) and in rats. 2. Orphenadrine protected CGCs from 3-NPA-induced mortality, as assessed by both the neutral red viability assay and laser scanning cytometry, using propidium iodide staining. 3. For rats, two indirect markers of neuronal damage were used: the binding of [(3)H]-PK 11195 to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a microglial marker, and expression of the 27 kD heat-shock protein (HSP27), a marker of activated astroglia. Systemic administration of 3-NPA (30 mg kg(-1) per day for 3 days) induced a 170% increase in [(3)H]-PK 11195 binding, and expression of HSP27. 4. Both the increase in [(3)H]-PK 11195 and HSP 27 expression were prevented by previous administration of 30 mg kg(-1) per day of orphenadrine for 3 days. Lower doses (10 and 20 mg kg(-1)) had no protective effect. Orphenadrine also reduced 3-NPA-induced mortality in a dose-dependent manner. 5. We propose that orphenadrine or orphenadrine-like drugs could be used to treat neurodegenerative disorders mediated by overactivation of NMDA receptors.", 
    "71": "The treatment of sepsis may require mechanical ventilation of the lungs and sedation. Because neutrophils are the most important effector cells for protecting against sepsis, and propofol and midazolam are the most widely used anesthetics for sedation, we studied the effects of these two anesthetics on the neutrophil function during sepsis. Sepsis was induced in rats by cecal ligation and puncture. At either 4 h or 24 h after cecal ligation and puncture, blood and peritoneal neutrophils were obtained, incubated with the test anesthetics, and the hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) production and CD11b/c expression were determined by flow cytometry. In both early (at 4 h) and late (at 24 h) sepsis, propofol and midazolam depressed H(2)O(2) production by blood and peritoneal neutrophils at clinical concentrations. Propofol caused more depression than midazolam (P < 0.005). In both early and late sepsis, the effect of the anesthetics on the up-regulation of the stimulation-induced CD11b/c expression on blood neutrophils was minimal at clinical concentrations. If these results ultimately become clinically relevant, midazolam may be preferable to propofol for sedation during sepsis.", 
    "72": "We previously defined a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC; ATVLNYYVWRDNS) in the carboxyl terminus of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport into the mitochondria, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. We examined (i) the PBR-cholesterol interaction by UV crosslinking of the C17 side-chain containing progestin, promegestone, and (ii) the role of the CRAC domain of PBR in Leydig cell steroidogenesis by using a transducible peptide composed of the TAT domain of HIV and the CRAC domain of PBR. [(3)H]Promegestone photoincorporated into recombinant PBR, and this labeling was displaced by cholesterol. [(3)H]Promegestone also photoincorporated into the TAT-CRAC peptide. [(3)H]Promegestone crosslinking to TAT-CRAC could be displaced by cholesterol and promegestone, with IC50 values of 1 and 200 microM, respectively. TAT-CRAC efficiently transduced into MA-10 Leydig cells and inhibited the hCG- and cAMP-stimulated steroid production in a dose-dependent manner. TAT-CRAC did not affect the hCG-induced cAMP synthesis and the 22R-hydroxycholesterol-supported steroidogenesis. Mutated TAT-CRAC lost its ability to bind [(3)H]promegestone and to inhibit the hCG-stimulated steroidogenesis. These results show that TAT-CRAC binds cholesterol and competes for cholesterol interaction with endogenous PBR, suggesting that the cytosolic carboxyl-terminal domain of PBR is responsible for taking up and bringing steroidogenic cholesterol into the mitochondria.",

    "77": "Insomnia is problematic for many individuals, causing them to seek treatment. There is a long history of therapies aimed at restoring normal sleep patterns, each having its advantages and disadvantages. This review traces the history of insomnia drug therapies from chloral hydrate and the barbiturates through the benzodiazepines and explores the newest selective benzodiazepine receptor agonists, including zolpidem and zaleplon. The mechanisms of action of the benzodiazepine receptor agonists are compared and contrasted. A pharmacokinetic comparison is presented showing the importance that parameters such as dose, onset of action, lipophilicity, metabolites, half-life, and receptor-binding affinity have on clinical effects. The possible adverse effects of sleep aids are discussed, including residual sedation and psychomotor impairment, daytime anxiety, anterograde amnesia and cognitive impairment, rebound insomnia, and drug tolerance and dependence. Effects on sleep efficiency and staging are also discussed. Recommendations for the primary care physician on the selection of hypnotics are also provided. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are often appropriate agents in the treatment of insomnia; however, individual drug and patient considerations are important in matching the most appropriate agent to the individual patient. Zolpidem and zaleplon, newer selective benzodiazepine receptor agonists, offer additional treatment options.", 
    "78": "Complaints of poor sleep are very common in people with chronic respiratory disorders. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), poor sleep may be due to many causes, including cough, excess mucous production, and frequent arousals from sleep caused by hypercapnia, as well as secondary to medications used to manage the lung disease. Patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) also complain of excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue due to poor-quality sleep, although the mechanism of sleep disruption is somewhat different from that in patients with COPD. Although benzodiazepines are often the drugs of choice for the management of insomnia, caution is suggested with the use of these agents in patients with chronic obstructive respiratory disease due to the reduction in upper airway muscle tone and blunting of the arousal response to hypercapnia. However, controlled trials with short-acting benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, including triazolam, zolpidem, and zaleplon, suggest that these agents may be safely used in selected patients who have mild to moderate COPD without daytime hypercapnia. Less data are available on the use of these agents for patients with OSA, but a preliminary trial using zaleplon suggests that respiratory function is not adversely affected in patients with mild to moderate OSA. Studies are needed to further define the benefit-risk ratio of the use of benzodiazepine receptor agonists for the management of insomnia in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.", 
    "79": "The elderly are known to have a high prevalence of insomnia. Causes of insomnia include: medical, psychiatric, and drug issues; circadian rhythm changes; sleep disorders; and psychosocial factors. The elderly frequently use sleeping aids. Risks associated with elderly patients' use of hypnotic drugs are attributable to concomitant comorbid conditions, use of multiple medications, altered pharmacokinetics, and increased central nervous system sensitivity to these drugs. Treatment options for insomnia include behavior modification and pharmacotherapy. The choice of hypnotics is based on matching the nature of the insomnia to the hypnotic agent. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists are common hypnotics prescribed for insomnia in the elderly. The ideal agent has rapid onset, duration of action that lasts through the night but no residual daytime effects, and no adverse effects. The longer-acting agents have been shown to result in a higher risk of falls and hip fractures in the elderly. This relationship is not apparent with short-acting agents. Zaleplon, the newest benzodiazepine receptor agonist, has the shortest half-life of available agents. Studies have demonstrated that zaleplon is effective in improving sleep latency, duration, and sleep quality in the elderly. Zaleplon does not appear to cause rebound insomnia, residual sedation, or adversely affect psychomotor function. The key for the healthcare professional is finding the appropriate treatment or treatment combination, including behavioral modification and pharmacotherapy. When hypnotics are indicated, the most appropriate short-acting agent should be considered.", 
    "80": "Although a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders are known to cause insomnia, there are many patients for which a cause cannot be determined. When the etiology is unknown, treatment of insomnia must be symptomatic. Epidemiologic studies suggest that insomnia does not occur on a regular basis in most people. In addition, the presentation of insomnia relative to the time of night is often variable, with waking in the middle of the night and initiating sleep upon going to bed being the most common. The intermittent occurrence of most insomnia suggests that treatment is best accomplished by using hypnotics on an \"as needed\" basis when difficulties with sleep occur. When pharmacological treatment of insomnia is warranted, benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BzRAs) are often the preferred class of agents. Agents with a shorter duration of action and rapid onset of action are preferred for flexible administration, providing an option for middle of the night dosing if this is when insomnia occurs. Of the available hypnotic agents in the BzRA class, triazolam, zolpidem, and zaleplon have rapid onsets of action and short half-lives. However, with a half-life of 1 hour, only zaleplon appears to be suited for middle of the night administration. Other important factors that affect selection of an agent for the treatment of intermittent insomnia include psychomotor or cognitive impairment and rebound insomnia after discontinuation of therapy. In one placebo-controlled trial, residual sedation was seen after flurazepam, but not with zaleplon, following middle-of-the-night administration. In addition, rebound insomnia was not apparent in a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial of zaleplon. In this same study, transient rebound insomnia was apparent with zolpidem compared to placebo. More data are needed on long-term therapy with hypnotic agents given intermittently on nights during which insomnia occurs.",

The atypical antipsychotic clozapine fully substituted for olanzapine in both the 0.5-mg/kg OLZ group (99.3% drug lever responding [DLR]) and the 0.25-mg/kg OLZ group (99.9% DLR). The typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine also substituted for olanzapine in both the 0.5-mg/kg OLZ group (87.5% DLR) and in the 0.25-mg/kg OLZ group (98.9% DLR); whereas, haloperidol displayed partial substitution for olanzapine in the 0.5-mg/kg OLZ group (56.1% DLR) and in the 0.25-mg/kg OLZ group (76.4% DLR). The 5.0-mg/kg dose of thioridazine produced olanzapine-appropriate responding in the 0.5-mg/kg OLZ group (99.6% DLR), but only partial substitution was seen with the 0.25-mg/kg OLZ training dose (64.0% DLR). The atypical antipsychotics raclopride (53.9% DLR) and risperidone (60.1% DLR) displayed only partial substitution in the 0.5-mg/kg OLZ group. Both the muscarinic cholinergic antagonist scopolamine (90.0% DLR) and the 5-HT2A/2C serotonergic antagonist ritanserin (86.0% DLR) fully substituted for olanzapine in the 0.5-mg/kg OLZ group.",

Specifically, olanzapine's discriminative stimulus properties appear to be meditated in part by both cholinergic and serotonergic mechanisms.", 
    "90": "Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist available in France as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opiate-dependent individuals. Twenty deaths have been reported in patients who have ingested buprenorphine in combination with benzodiazepines. Since buprenorphine and many benzodiazepines are CYP3A substrates, the effect of buprenorphine on CYP3A activity was examined in order to assess the likelihood of a pharmacokinetic interaction. The formation of 6beta-hydroxytestosterone was measured in dexamethasone-induced rat liver microsomes and in human liver microsomes under control conditions and in the presence of buprenorphine. Buprenorphine was found to be a weak inhibitor of CYP3A with a 50% decrease in enzyme activity occurring at a concentration of 118 microM (IC50) in human liver microsomes. IC50 was 0.3 microM for ketoconazole in the same system. Since the IC50 for buprenorphine is roughly 2000 times higher than typical plasma concentrations, this drug is unlikely to cause clinically significant inhibition of CYP3A in patients. Excessive CNS depression due to the combination of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines is most likely due to additive or synergistic pharmacologic effect unrelated to a pharmacokinetic interaction between the drugs.",

Tinnitology is an integrated discipline of basic sciences, neuroscience, and clinical medicine for the understanding of aberrant auditory phenomena unrelated to an external source of sound. To patients with subjective idiopathic tinnitus, nuclear medicine techniques of positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography provide correlation of structure and function, which improves the accuracy of the tinnitus diagnosis. Additionally, they provide a monitoring system to establish the efficacy of modalities of therapy attempting to provide tinnitus relief. Further, they provide information of neuroreceptors and neurochemistry in brain underlying or accompanying basic mechanism for production of specific clinical types and subtypes of tinnitus. This study reports the application of nuclear medicine techniques for a new clinical neuropharmacology protocol for tinnitus treatment highlighted by intratympanic drug therapy in predominantly cochlear-type tinnitus.

By radioreceptor binding assays, we demonstrated the ability of the flavone to displace a specific radioligand, [(3)H]Ro 15-1788, from the central benzodiazepine binding site. Electrophysiological studies performed on cultured cerebellar granule cells showed that apigenin reduced GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-activated Cl(-) currents in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect was blocked by co-application of Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Accordingly, apigenin reduced the latency in the onset of picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Moreover, apigenin injected i.p. in rats reduced locomotor activity, but did not demonstrate anxiolytic, myorelaxant, or anticonvulsant activities. The present results seem to suggest that the inhibitory activity of apigenin on locomotor behaviour in rats cannot be ascribed to an interaction with GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor but to other neurotransmission systems, since it is not blocked by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "110": "Anxiety is a common psychiatric illness often treated by benzodiazepines (BZs). BZs, such as Valium, bind to the alpha subunit of the pentameric GABA(A) receptor and increase inhibition in the CNS. There is considerable evidence for abnormal GABA(A) receptor function in anxiety, and a significant proportion of anxiety patients has a reduced sensitivity to BZs. Here, we show that serotonin(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor knock-out mice display BZ-resistant anxiety. Consistent with this finding, binding of both BZ and non-BZ GABA(A) receptor ligands were reduced and GABAergic inhibition was impaired in mutant mice. These changes were reflected by abnormal alpha subunit expression in the amygdala and hippocampus, two important limbic regions involved in fear and anxiety. These data suggest a pathological pathway, initiated by a 5-HT(1A) receptor deficit, leading to abnormalities in GABA(A) receptor composition and level, which in turn result in BZ-insensitivity and anxiety. This model mechanistically links together the 5-HT and GABA systems, which both have been implicated in anxiety. A related mechanism may underlie reduced BZ sensitivity in certain forms of anxiety.", 
    "111": "GABA(A) receptors are chloride channels composed of five subunits. Cerebellar granule cells express abundantly six subunits belonging to four subunit classes. These are assembled into a number of distinct receptors, but the regulation of their relative proportions is yet unknown. Here, we studied the composition of cerebellar GABA(A) receptors after targeted disruption of the delta subunit gene. In membranes and extracts of delta-/- cerebellum, [(3)H]muscimol binding was not significantly changed, whereas [(3)H]Ro15-4513 binding was increased by 52% due to an increase in diazepam-insensitive binding. Immunocytochemical and Western blot analysis revealed no change in alpha(6) subunits but an increased expression of gamma(2) subunits in delta-/- cerebellum. Immunoaffinity chromatography of cerebellar extracts indicated there was an increased coassembly of alpha(6) and gamma(2) subunits and that 24% of all receptors in delta-/- cerebellum did not contain a gamma subunit. Because 97% of delta subunits are coassembled with alpha(6) subunits in the cerebellum of wild-type mice, these results indicated that, in delta-/- mice, alpha(6)betagamma(2) and alphabeta receptors replaced delta subunit-containing receptors. The availability of the delta subunit, thus, influences the level of expression or the extent of assembly of the gamma(2) subunit, although these two subunits do not occur in the same receptor.", 
    "112": "1. The effects of I(Ks) block by chromanol 293B and L-735,821 on rabbit QT-interval, action potential duration (APD), and membrane current were compared to those of E-4031, a recognized I(Kr) blocker. Measurements were made in rabbit Langendorff-perfused whole hearts, isolated papillary muscle, and single isolated ventricular myocytes. 2. Neither chromanol 293B (10 microM) nor L-735,821 (100 nM) had a significant effect on QTc interval in Langendorff-perfused hearts. E-4031 (100 nM), on the other hand, significantly increased QTc interval (35.6+/-3.9%, n=8, P<0.05). 3. Similarly both chromanol 293B (10 microM) and L-735,821 (100 nM) produced little increase in papillary muscle APD (less than 7%) while pacing at cycle lengths between 300 and 5000 ms. In contrast, E-4031 (100 nM) markedly increased (30 - 60%) APD in a reverse frequency-dependent manner. 4. In ventricular myocytes, the same concentrations of chromanol 293B (10 microM), L-735,821 (100 nM) and E-4031 (1 microM) markedly or totally blocked I(Ks) and I(Kr), respectively. 5. I(Ks) tail currents activated slowly (at +30 mV, tau=888.1+/-48.2 ms, n=21) and deactivated rapidly (at -40 mV, tau=157.1+/-4.7 ms, n=22), while I(Kr) tail currents activated rapidly (at +30 mV, tau=35.5+/-3.1 ms, n=26) and deactivated slowly (at -40 mV, tau(1)=641.5+/-29.0 ms, tau(2)=6531+/-343, n=35). I(Kr) was estimated to contribute substantially more to total current density during normal ventricular muscle action potentials (i.e., after a 150 ms square pulse to +30 mV) than does I(Ks). 6. These findings indicate that block of I(Ks) is not likely to provide antiarrhythmic benefit by lengthening normal ventricular muscle QTc, APD, and refractoriness over a wide range of frequencies.", 
    "113": "The present study examines the effect of pregabalin (previously S-Isobutylgaba and CI-1008) in two distinct rat models of anxiety. Pregabalin binds with high affinity and selectivity to the alpha(2)delta subunit of voltage dependent calcium channels (VDCC). Its corresponding R-enantiomer (R-isobutylgaba) is approximately 10 fold weaker. Pregabalin dose-dependently induced anxiolytic-like effects in both the rat conflict test and elevated X-maze with respective minimum effective doses (MED) of 3 and 10 mg kg(-1). In contrast, R-isobutylgaba only showed activity at the highest dose of 100 mg kg(-1) in the conflict test. These data indicate that pregabalin may possess clinical utility as a novel anxiolytic agent and demonstrates the importance of the alpha(2)delta subunit of VDCC in the mediation of anxiety related behaviours.",

    "116": "Of the 184 patients, 133 (72.2%) received appropriate, prompt medical treatment for SE, i.e., intravenous diazepam, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. In 100 patients (75.8%), the dose of the first AED administered was less than that currently recommended. The first treatment was effective in terminating SE in 41 (31.1%) of 132 patients. The adequacy of treatment was highly predictive of drug efficacy (P = .002). The dose of the second AED treatment was inadequate in 52 (80%) of 65 patients treated.", 
    "117": "Based on this retrospective study, the treatment of SE is remarkable for both inadequacy and ineffectiveness. The inappropriate use of therapeutic regimens in the management of SE may be an important cause of ineffective medical treatment.",

    "120": "In a randomized prospective trial of 40 patients undergoing acromioplasty under general anesthesia, 20 patients received an ISBP block (group 1) and 20 had no block (group 2). A digitally assisted acromioplasty was performed using a burr introduced via a posterior portal. The undersurface of the acromion was debrided, directing the burr with the surgeon's index finger introduced via a small lateral incision. Independent review was at day 1, day 2, week 1, week 6, and 1 year.",

    "123": "Polypharmacy, or the use of multiple drugs in the therapy of psychiatric disorders, is not recommended. However, appropriate combinations of pharmacologic mechanisms may enhance the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs and alter the course of schizophrenia. In recent years, some articles have been published about the successful use of clozapine and risperidone in combination for the treatment of patients with resistant schizophrenic and schizoaffective disorders. However, safety of this drug combination is open to discussion. This report presents the results of a preliminary study of five patients with resistant schizophrenia successfully treated with risperidone-olanzapine combination. The results suggest that this combination may be useful. In the future, the efficacy of risperidone-olanzapine combination should be confirmed in larger study populations before its clinical application is considered.", 
    "124": "The imidazopyridine zolpidem is a short-acting hypnotic chemically distinct from benzodiazepines (BZs). According to its peculiar neuropharmacologic activity (selectivity for the omega 1-BZ receptors), zolpidem is expected to be a pure hypnotic, without the other effects of BZs. In particular, it has been stressed that zolpidem is well tolerated in adults and in the elderly, and that tolerance, abuse, dependence, rebound insomnia, and other withdrawal effects do not develop in relation to zolpidem administration. However, despite these assumptions, zolpidem abuse, dependence, and withdrawal effects have been recently discussed and reviewed herein. In addition, the case of a 43-year-old woman who had an epileptic attack after abrupt interruption of an abused, high dose of zolpidem (600 mg/d), is reported and discussed. At the clinical level, it is stressed that the subjective effects ofzolpidem are comparable to those of other BZs, and that abuse, dependence, and withdrawal seizures cannot be avoided simply shifting the regimen of a BZ abuser to zolpidem. At the pharmacologic level, it is important to note that zolpidem's clinical effects cannot be explained on the basis of the old distinction between omega I and 2 receptors because this distinction is no longer valid; the new classification ofGABAA receptor subtypes is reported and zolpidem activity at this level is discussed herein.", 
    "125": "Atypical neuroleptic agents are an excellent, safer, and more effective alternative to the widespread practice of maintenance adjunctive treatment with traditional neuroleptic agents in patients with bipolar disorder. Currently, a number of prospective studies are available with clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Most are short-term studies, although longer-term data are becoming available. Four double-blind studies of acute mania have been conducted with risperidone and olanzapine, leading to recent Food and Drug Administration approval for olanzapine in the indication of acute mania. Given the limited longer-term data, and the evidence for mostly adjunctive benefits with these agents, it seems unlikely that these agents will prove to be primary mood stabilizers in their own right. Nonetheless, they serve an important role as adjunctive treatments along with standard mood stabilizers in the rational polypharmacy of bipolar disorder. To date, differences in efficacy have not been established. However, differences in the side effect of weight gain may be even more relevant in bipolar disorder than in schizophrenia due to the need to use standard mood stabilizers that often potentiate such weight gain.", 
    "126": "For patients hospitalized with acute episodes of psychosis, rapid stabilization of intense positive symptoms, hostility, and agitation is typically a preeminent therapeutic goal. These goals often differ from those of the nonhospitalized patient with psychosis for whom long-term treatment goals such as improvement of negative symptoms, cognitive function, compliance, and reduction in side effect burden may be paramount. Therefore, when selecting an antipsychotic treatment for hospitalized patients, efficacy against positive symptoms and hostility as well as speed of therapeutic onset should strongly be considered. At the same time, selection of antipsychotic treatment in the inpatient setting should establish a definitive treatment that will address long-term goals effectively after discharge. This article presents the rationale and practical guidelines for selection of treatment regimens for patients hospitalized due to acute psychosis.", 
    "127": "The physiologic and psychological impact of drugs administered in the emergency treatment of psychosis endures much longer than the patient's brief stay in the psychiatric emergency service (PES). Although newer antipsychotic agents with improved efficacy and side effect profiles are now available and generally recommended as first-line treatment for psychosis, the slow titration schedules and lack of intramuscular preparations for these drugs often lead to the preferential use, and perhaps overuse, of conventional antipsychotics in emergency situations. A recent survey found that most medical directors of psychiatric emergency programs would prefer to administer an oral atypical agent if such an agent were found to be effective, safe, reliable, and practical to use. Preliminary results have shown the atypical antipsychotic risperidone to have efficacy equal to that of the conventional agent haloperidol in a direct comparison in the PES; further study is required, however, to determine the appropriateness of the use of risperidone and the other atypical antipsychotics in the emergency treatment of psychosis.", 
    "128": "Under intense public pressure, regulatory agencies have recently defined circumstances in which medications will be considered a form of restraint, so-called \"chemical restraint.\" This article proposes that the emergency management of the agitated patient be viewed as a brief departure from the usual physician-patient collaboration. Viewed in this way, the goal is simply to terminate the emergency in the manner most likely to be acceptable to patients and conducive to a more typical dialogue. To that end, the author reviews all controlled studies of medication treatment of agitation that have appeared in English since the advent of the neuroleptic medications. Issues of diagnosis, relative efficacy, dosage, route, onset, offset, safety, tolerability, and consumer preference are considered.", 
    "129": "Bipolar disorder is a recurrent and relapsing mood disorder characterized by cycles of depression and mania. This article addresses the treatment of patients with bipolar mania, which remains one of the most difficult challenges facing clinicians. Patients require safe and effective therapeutic approaches for acute episodes of mania and depression, as well as chronic prophylaxis against future episodes. Monotherapeutic approaches are rarely effective, and combination approaches are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Lithium is the only agent currently approved for the treatment of both acute episodes of mania and maintenance therapy; however, it is associated with a relatively poor response rate, high relapse rate, and less-than-optimal side effect profile. Other recent approaches have included several anticonvulsant agents, as well as conventional and atypical antipsychotic agents.",

    "132": "The intensive care unit of a medical university hospital.", 
    "133": "Twenty-six ventilated TBI patents (Glasgow Coma Scale score on admission, < or = 8 points) were divided randomly into two groups: a hypothermic group (n = 15), in which the patients were cooled to 32 to 33 degrees C after being giving vecuronium, midazolam, and buprenorphine; and a normothermic group (n = 11), in which the patients' body temperature was controlled at 36 to 37 degrees C by surface cooling using the same treatment as the hypothermic group. Body temperature control including normothermia was started 3 to 4 hrs after injury. The duration of hypothermia usually lasted for 3 to 4 days, after which the patients were rewarmed at a rate of approximately 1 C per day.", 
    "134": "Blood sampling for TXB2 and 6-keto PGF1alpha was started shortly after admission in both groups. Arterial TXB2 levels on admission in both groups were elevated remarkably, but not 6-keto PGF1alpha, thereby causing an imbalance of the prostanoids after injury. In the normothermic group, TXB2 decreased transiently, but this prostanoid increased again 3 days after the injury. In the hypothermic group, such prostanoid differences disappeared shortly after therapy, and the condition was sustained for 10 days. Hypothermia attenuated differences in TXB2 levels between arterial and internal jugular bulb sera, which may reflect reduced cerebral prostanoid production. The Glasgow Outcome Scale score 6 months after the insult in the hypothermic group was significantly higher than that in the normothermic group (p = .04).", 
    "135": "The current results from a limited number of patients suggest that moderate hypothermia may reduce prostanoid production after TBI, thereby attenuating an imbalance of thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin I2. However, it must be clarified whether the changes in the prostanoid after moderate hypothermia are a secondary effect of other mediator changes or whether they simply represent an epiphenomenon that is mechanistically unrelated to damage in TBI.", 
    "136": "1. The pathological process that precipitates schizophrenia has yet to be identified. However, many lines of evidence suggest that a change in the functioning of the frontal cortex is an important abnormality that underlies schizophrenia. 2. Studies in Brodmann's area 9, obtained post-mortem, have shown changes in 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT2A, muscarinic M1 and GABA(A) receptors in tissue from subjects with schizophrenia. 3. Animal studies suggest a site in the cortex where there would be an interaction between serotonergic and cholinergic innervation and that this interaction would involve the 5-HT2A and the M1 receptor. This site, in turn, would be a potent modulator of GABA activity and, hence, levels of GABA(A) receptors. 4. From combining these data, a theoretical site is proposed that, if proven to exist in human cortex, is likely to be central to the pathology of that illness."
