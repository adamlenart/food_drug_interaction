The complexity of the disease and its treatments make MG patients particularly susceptible to adverse effects of drugs. MG is not a painful condition; however, as pain management armamentarium includes drugs from diverse pharmacological groups and with potential for drug-drug interactions, managing pain in patients with MG can be challenging. The underlying disease and the concomitant medications of each patient must be considered and the analgesic treatment individualized. This review presents an update on the various aspects of pain pharmacotherapy in patients with MG, focusing primarily on medications used to treat chronic pain. Drugs discussed are opioids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, benzodiazepines, intravenous magnesium, and local anesthetics. Drug interactions with agents used for MG treatment (acethylcholinesterase inhibitors, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants) and plasmapheresis are discussed. The clinical usefulness and limitations of each of the drug classes and agents are described.",

    "5": "Recent work in neuroeconomics has used game theory paradigms to examine neural systems that subserve human social interaction and decision making. Attempts to modify social interaction through pharmacological manipulation have been less common. Here we show dose-dependent modification of human social behavior in a prisoner's dilemma model after acute administration of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A modulating benzodiazepine alprazolam. Nine healthy adults received doses of placebo, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\u2009mg alprazolam in a counterbalanced within-subject design, while completing multiple test blocks per day on an iterated prisoner's dilemma game. During test blocks in which peak subjective effects of alprazolam were reported, cooperative choices were significantly decreased as a function of dose. Consistent with previous reports showing that high acute doses of GABA-modulating drugs are associated with violence and other antisocial behavior, our data suggest that at sufficiently high doses, alprazolam can decrease cooperation. These behavioral changes may be facilitated by changes in inhibitory control facilitated by GABA. Game theory paradigms may prove useful in behavioral pharmacology studies seeking to measure social interaction, and may help inform the emerging field of neuroeconomics.",

It is characterised by unexplained abdominal pain, discomfort, and bloating in association with altered bowel habits. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial involving disturbances of the brain-gut axis. The pathophysiology provides the rationale for pharmacotherapy: abnormal gastrointestinal motor functions, visceral hypersensitivity, psychosocial factors, autonomic dysfunction, and mucosal immune activation. Understanding the mechanisms, and their mediators or modulators including neurotransmitters and receptors have led to several therapeutic approaches including agents acting on the serotonin receptor or serotonin transporter system, antidepressants, novel selective anticholinergics, alpha-adrenergic agonists, opioid agents, cholecystokinin-antagonists, neurokinin-antagonists, somatostatin receptor agonists, corticotropin releasing factor antagonists, chloride channel activators, guanylate cyclase-c agonists, melatonin, atypical benzodiazepines, antibiotics, immune modulators and probiotics. The mechanisms and current evidence regarding efficacy of these agents are reviewed.", 
    "11": "Peripheral neuropathy represents an important complication of diabetes involving a spectrum of structural, functional and biochemical alterations in peripheral nerves. Recent observations obtained in our laboratory have shown that the levels of neuroactive steroids present in the sciatic nerve of rat raised diabetic by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ) are reduced and that, in the same experimental model, treatment with neuroactive steroids, such as progesterone, testosterone and their derivatives show neuroprotective effects. On this basis, an interesting therapeutic strategy could be to increase the levels of neuroactive steroids directly in the nervous system. With this perspective, ligands of translocator protein-18 kDa (TSPO) may represent an interesting option. TSPO is mainly present in the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it promotes the translocation of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, and, as demonstrated in other cellular systems, it allows the transformation of cholesterol into pregnenolone and the increase of steroid levels. In the diabetic model of STZ rat, we have here assessed whether treatment with Ro5-4864 (i.e., a ligand of TSPO) could increase the low levels of neuroactive steroids in sciatic nerve and consequently to be protective in this experimental model. Data obtained by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry show that treatment with Ro5-4864 was able to significantly stimulate the low levels of pregnenolone, progesterone and dihydrotestosterone observed in the sciatic nerves of diabetic rats. The treatment with Ro5-4864 also counteracted the impairment of NCV and thermal threshold, restored skin innervation density and P0 mRNA levels, and improved Na+,K+-ATPase activity. In conclusion, data here reported show for the first time that a TSPO ligand, such as Ro5-4864, is effective in reducing the severity of diabetic neuropathy through a local increase of neuroactive steroid levels.", 
    "12": "Midazolam (MDZ) is a commonly used benzodiazepine in clinical practice. In addition, its metabolic oxidation is used as a surrogate marker for Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzyme activity as well. Thus, a new simpler method to measure MDZ and its metabolites is welcomed. Herein we report a new and simple HPLC method with ultraviolet detection for the simultaneous determination of midazolam and its hydroxyl metabolites using lorazepam as an internal standard. A liquid-liquid extraction was used to extract the compounds from rabbit hepatic microsomes and human plasma. The separation was performed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 column using a mobile phase composed of 0.05 M Na2PO4 (pH 4.5) and acetonitrile mixture (67:33) pumped at 1.2 mL/min. The calibration curves showed good linearity with correlation coefficient higher than 0.999 for all analytes in the range 10-500 ng/mL. Accuracy in the measurement of quality control (QC) samples was in the range 95-106% of the nominal values. The intra-day and inter-day precisions in the measurement of QC samples were less than 11% coefficient of variation. Although less sensitive than GC-MS, the proposed method was adequately sensitive to measure midazolam hydroxylase activity as a marker for CYP3A activity, and was applied to measure midazolam pharmacokinetics in human plasma.", 
    "13": "The onset of the daily wheel running bout precedes dark onset by several hours in the early runner genetic variant of mice. Here, we test the hypothesis that timed daily administration of a melatonin agonist, ramelteon, or a benzodiazepine, triazolam, normalizes the timing of daily wheel-running rhythms in early runner mice. The daily profiles of wheel-running activity of early runner mice were monitored continuously in a 12:12 light/dark cycle. Wheel running was assessed before, during and after timed daily oral administration of saline vehicle (n=12), ramelteon (10 mg/kg, n=12), or triazolam (1 mg/kg, n=12). The timing of wheel-running rhythms relative to the light/dark cycle was used as a measure of the timing of wake onset. Under baseline conditions, early runner mice entrained to a light/dark cycle at an advanced phase, approximately 3 h before dark onset, on average. Triazolam, but not ramelteon, suppressed wheel-running acutely when administered just prior to the time at which wheel-running onset had occurred under baseline conditions. On a washout day under a light/dark cycle subsequent to one week of once daily administration, the onset of wheel-running was delayed relative to baseline in both ramelteon-treated mice and triazolam-treated mice. In constant dark subsequent to a second week of once daily administration, the onset of wheel-running activity was not affected by either compound. Thus, ramelteon and triazolam caused a shift in the timing of wheel-running rhythms in an LD cycle but did so without long-term effects on the functioning of the circadian clock.",

The aims of this paper were to examine an animal model of appetitive behaviour (as an element of social interaction) and to study the effects of selected psychotropic drugs on appetitively evoked ultrasonic vocalisation (USVs) and aversive context-evoked USVs. Specifically, we analysed the impact of the encounter of pairs of adult rats after long-term isolation on ultrasound vocalisation. It was found that isolation of the adult rats significantly enhanced the appetitive ultrasound vocalisations (50-kHz) during encounters between pairs of rats. In the pharmacological part of the study, we found that diazepam (1.0 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased isolation-induced appetitive USVs (50 kHz) and decreased aversive context-evoked USVs (22-kHz). Buspiron (3.0 mg kg(-1)) decreased the aversive context-evoked USVs and had no effect on isolation-induced appetitive USVs. These data indicate that long-term, isolation-induced 50-kHz USVs in adult rats represent a new behavioural parameter under control of the central GABAergic system, which can be used to study the effects of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "25": "Catatonia is the psychiatric syndrome of disturbed motor functions amid disturbances in mood and thought first described in 1874. It was quickly found in 10% to 38% of psychiatric populations. After it was tied to schizophrenia as a type in the psychiatric classification, its recognition became increasingly limited and by the 1980s questions were asked as to where the catatonics had gone. The decline is largely owing to the change in venue for psychiatric practice from asylum to office, the rejection of physical examination, and the dependence on item rating scales for diagnosis. In the 1970s, broad surveys again showed that catatonia was as common as before among patients with mania and depression, and as a toxic response to neuroleptic drugs. The latter recognition, that the neuroleptic malignant syndrome is the same syndrome as malignant catatonia, and is effectively treated as such, sparked a renewed interest. Clinicians developed rating scales to identify the catatonia syndrome and applied the immediate relief afforded by a barbiturate or a benzodiazepine as a diagnostic test, the lorazepam test. Effective treatments were described as high doses of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Surveys using catatonia rating scales showed catatonia to have many faces. Catatonia is presently limited to a type of schizophrenia in the psychiatric classification. Its recognition as a disorder of its own, such as delirium and dementia, should now be recognized. This experience reinforced the utility of the medical model for diagnosis. An application for melancholia is described.",

    "30": "The widespread use of tobacco and alcohol among adolescents might be related to the ability of nicotine and ethanol to facilitate social interactions. To investigate the neurobehavioral mechanisms underlying the prosocial effects of nicotine and ethanol, we focused on social play behavior, the most characteristic social activity in adolescent rats. Social play behavior is rewarding, and it is modulated through opioid, cannabinoid and dopaminergic neurotransmission, which are also involved in the reinforcing properties of nicotine and ethanol. We found that nicotine and ethanol increased social play, without affecting locomotion or social exploration. Their effects depended on the level of social activity of the partner, and were comparable in familiar and unfamiliar environments. At doses that increased social play, nicotine and ethanol had no anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus-maze. By contrast, the prototypical anxiolytic drug diazepam reduced social play at doses that reduced anxiety. The effects of nicotine on social play were blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, the CB(1) cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR141716A, and the dopamine receptor antagonist alpha-flupenthixol. The effects of ethanol were blocked by SR141716A and alpha-flupenthixol, but not by naloxone. Combined administration of subeffective doses of nicotine and ethanol only modestly enhanced social play. These results show that the facilitatory effects of nicotine and ethanol on social play are behaviorally specific and mediated through neurotransmitter systems involved in positive emotions and motivation, through partially dissociable mechanisms. Furthermore, the stimulating effects of nicotine and ethanol on social play behavior are independent of their anxiolytic-like properties.",

Here we report that a primary increase of CCK-8, the biologically active form of CCK, in the duodenum lowers glucose production independent of changes in circulating insulin levels. Furthermore, we show that duodenal CCK-8 requires the activation of the gut CCK-A receptor and a gut-brain-liver neuronal axis to lower glucose production. Finally, duodenal CCK-8 fails to lower glucose production in the early onset of high-fat diet-induced insulin resistance. These findings reveal a role for gut CCK that lowers glucose production through a neuronal network and suggest that intestinal CCK resistance may contribute to hyperglycemia in response to high-fat feeding.", 
    "37": "Although sensation-seeking status is associated with age of initiation and amount of drug use among adolescents, and sensitivity to the behavioral and reinforcing effects of drugs among young adults, it is unclear whether sensation-seeking status among adolescents is predictive of sensitivity to the pharmacological effects of drugs (i.e. abuse potential) as adults. This study examined the acute behavioral effects of oral diazepam and d-amphetamine in young adults, ages 18-21 years, who had consistently scored in the highest or lowest third of their grade-based cohort on a modified Sensation Seeking Scale that was completed annually between ages 10 and 14 years. Healthy participants completed 16 7.5-h test days, with test days separated by a minimum of 48 h. Each day, assessments consisting of computer task performance, verbal report of drug effects, and cardiovascular measures were completed 0, 50, 110, 170, 230, and 290 min after drug administration. Placebo and three active doses of diazepam and d-amphetamine (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/70 kg) were tested under double-blind conditions according to a randomized-block design. Typical stimulant and sedative effects were obtained with d-amphetamine and diazepam, respectively. Drug effects varied as a function of sensation-seeking status, with magnitude of effects on cardiovascular function, task performance, and report of positive drug effects being greater among high sensation seekers, and report of negative drug effects being greater among low sensation seekers. Adolescents who report high levels of sensation seeking on a consistent basis are more sensitive to pharmacological effects of stimulant and sedative drugs that are associated with abuse potential as young adults.",

    "42": "Behavioral momentum theory proposes that operant behavior is the product of two separable processes: its rate of occurrence and its resistance to change. Generally speaking, operant situations providing more densely spaced or greater magnitudes of reinforcement should be more resistant to disruption. Attempts to disrupt ongoing behavior by manipulating the availability of food or deprivation level typically have supported the predictions of behavioral momentum. Tests with pharmacological disruptors, however, have yielded mixed results. Most investigations of pharmacological disruption of operant behavior have evaluated momentum across situations that differ in rate of reinforcement. The present experiment was an attempt to systematically replicate prior work, but under conditions of differing reinforcement magnitudes. Pigeons were trained to key peck on a multiple fixed-ratio 30 schedule of food presentation, where different components programmed 2-, 4-, or 8-s access to grain. Resistance to rate-decreasing effects of drugs was evaluated with several compounds drawn from distinct pharmacological classes: chlordiazepoxide, cocaine, clonidine, haloperidol, morphine, and ethanol were tested. Additionally, disruption by prefeeding and extinction was examined. Generally, resistance to change by drug administration was not modulated by reinforcement magnitude. Prefeeding and extinction tests, however, replicated previous work, indicating that our procedure was sensitive to more common disruptors. The results give additional support to the notion that pharmacological disruptors may not behave in the manner predicted by behavioral momentum theory.",

Anaesthesia was induced with a combination of midazolam/ketamine in 18 female pigs with a mean body weight of 24.9 +/- 5.9 kg scheduled for surgical removal of the liver. After tracheal intubation, anaesthesia was maintained on a circle rebreathing circuit with isoflurane. Epidural anaesthesia was administered with ropivacaine (AL-group, n = 8) at 0.2 ml/kg of a 7.5 mg/ml solution to the anaesthetised animals. The A-group (n = 10) received isoflurane anaesthesia only. The vaporiser was set at 2.5% for the A-group and 1.5% for the AL-group. Heart rate, invasive systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressure were monitored. Comparisons were made between treatments and within treatments comparing variables during surgical preparation and abdominal surgery. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant (P > 0.05) during surgical preparation or during abdominal surgery. For within treatment groups, the differences between surgical preparation and abdominal surgery were statistically significant (P < 0.05) for heart rate in the A-group, but not statistically significant (P > 0.05) for the other variables. It is concluded that abdominal surgery may be associated with statistically significant changes in heart rate in isoflurane-anaesthetised pigs and that the combined administration of epidural ropivacaine may prevent statistically significant changes in HR during abdominal surgery.",

    "57": "The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; BA 24) via its extensive limbic and high order association cortical connectivity to prefrontal cortex is a key part of an important circuitry participating in executive function, affect, and socio-emotional behavior. Multiple lines of evidence, including genetic and imaging studies, suggest that the ACC and gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) system may be affected in autism. The benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA(A) receptor complex is an important target for pharmacotherapy and has important clinical implications. The present multiple-concentration ligand-binding study utilized (3)H-muscimol and (3)H-flunitrazepam to determine the number (B(max)), binding affinity (K(d)), and distribution of GABA(A) receptors and benzodiazepine binding sites, respectively, in the ACC in adult autistic and control cases. Compared to controls, the autistic group had significant decreases in the mean density of GABA(A) receptors in the supragranular (46.8%) and infragranular (20.2%) layers of the ACC and in the density of benzodiazepine binding sites in the supragranular (28.9%) and infragranular (16.4%) lamina [corrected]. These findings suggest that in the autistic group this downregulation of both benzodiazepine sites and GABA(A) receptors in the ACC may be the result of increased GABA innervation and/or release disturbing the delicate excitation/inhibition balance of principal neurons as well as their output to key limbic cortical targets. Such disturbances likely underlie the core alterations in socio-emotional behaviors in autism.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like effects of YKS and Chotoko, which is an active component of YKS. Oral treatment with YKS (300 and 1000 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of head-dipping behaviors in mice in the hole-board test. Head-dipping behavior in mice was also significantly increased by treatment with Chotoko (50 and 100mg/kg, p.o.). In addition, oral treatment with the water-extracted fractions from YKS (YKS-W; 250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) and Chotoko (Chotoko-W; 10 and 30 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of head-dipping behaviors in mice. On the other hand, treatment with the methanol-extracted fraction of YKS (YKS-Met; 15 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.) did not affect head-dipping behavior. The total distance and number of rearing behaviors were not affected by treatment with any of these drugs. The increase in the number of head-dipping behaviors by treatment with YKS-W (500 mg/kg, p.o.) and Chotoko-W (30 mg/kg, p.o.) was inhibited by pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (1mg/kg, i.v.). In the elevated plus-maze test, the percentage of time spent in open arms was increased in YKS (1000 mg, p.o.) treatment. Based on these results, we suggest that YKS produces an anxiolytic-like effect mediated by the benzodiazepine system. Chotoko is an effective component of YKS for producing an anxiolytic-like effect. The effective compound(s) should be contained, at least in part, in the water-soluble fraction of YKS.",

The data analysis was performed using SPSS/PC+ version 14.0. Prescriptions with the dextropropoxyphene + acetaminophen fixed-dose combination comprised 11.8% of all dispensed prescriptions and in most instances for outpatients undergoing substance abuse rehabilitation. Nearly half of the patients received >or=20 tablets of this fixed-dose combination (mean +/- SD: 30.9 +/- 13.1; range 20-126) as multiple doses.

Approximately 40% of prescriptions with the dextropropoxyphene + acetaminophen fixed-dose combination were written 'as required' (prn), basis. Despite poor safety and efforts to restrict or withdraw worldwide, the dextropropoxyphene + acetaminophen fixed-dose combination continues to be irrationally prescribed to outpatients undergoing substance abuse rehabilitation in Bahrain. Health policy decision-makers should introduce a phased withdrawal of this drug from clinical use. In the meanwhile, it is important to create awareness among prescribers of the risks associated with over-dosage of the dextropropoxyphene + acetaminophen fixed-dose combination and its interaction with other psychotropic medications.", 
    "78": "Dopamine receptors function to control many aspects of motor control and other forms of behaviour in both vertebrates and invertebrates. They can be divided into two main groups (D(1) and D(2)) based on sequence similarity, ligand affinity and effector coupling. However, little is known about the pharmacology and functionality of dopamine receptors in the deuterostomian invertebrates, such as the cephalochordate amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) which has recently been placed as the most basal of all the chordates. A bioinformatic study shows that amphioxus has at least three dopamine D(1)-like receptor sequences. One of these receptors, AmphiD(1)/beta, was found to have high levels of sequence similarity to both vertebrate D(1) receptors and to beta-adrenergic receptors. Here, we report on the cloning of AmphiD(1)/beta from an adult amphioxus cDNA library, and its pharmacological characterization subsequent to its expression in both mammalian cell lines and Xenopus oocytes. It was found that AmphiD(1)/beta has a similar pharmacology to vertebrate D(1) receptors, including responding to benzodiazepine ligands. The pharmacology of the receptor exhibits 'agonist-specific coupling' depending upon the second messenger pathway to which it is linked. Moreover, no pharmacological characteristics were observed to suggest that AmphiD(1)/beta may be an amphioxus orthologue of vertebrate beta-adrenergic receptors.", 
    "79": "An anesthetic combination of medetomidine-midazolam-atropine and propofol was investigated in twenty New Zealand White rabbits. Each rabbit received combined medetomidine at a dosage of 0.2 mg/kg (b.w.), midazolam (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) and atropine (0.5 mg/kg b.w.) intramuscularly for induction of anesthesia. Propofol was administered intravenously - given to effect, and after that by an infusion pump to maintain anesthesia. The influence of the anesthetic combination on the cardiopulmonary system was evaluated by monitoring respiratory and heart rates, blood pressure, and arterial blood gas tensions. The results obtained showed that propofol infusion at a rate of 0.5 mg/kg b.w./min maintained general anesthesia effectively with few side effects on the cardiopulmonary system during 30 minutes. However, slight hypotension, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis were associated with infusion of this anesthetic. The recovery of the rabbits from the anesthesia was smooth. Two rabbits died 20 to 24 hours after anesthesia. In conclusion, an anesthetic combination with medetomidine-midazolam-atropine and propofol at the investigated doses was shown to be a safe method to induce and maintain general anesthesia enabling short-term surgical procedures in healthy animals.",

The effect of amisulpride was compared with that of fluoxetine, the standard antidepressant and olanzapine, another atypical antipsychotic claimed to have antidepressant like activity. Both acute and chronic studies were carried out. In both the studies, animals were divided into four groups (n = 8 each) and subjected to oral drug interventions as follows -- Group 1- control (distilled water, 1 mL/kg); Group 2- fluoxetine in a dose of 10 mg/kg 23.5, 5 and 1 h before the test; Group 3-amisulpride in a dose of 70 mg/kg 23.5, 5 and 1 h before the test; Group 4- olanzapine in a dose of 2 mg/kg 23.5, 5 and 1 h before the study. In the chronic study, the treatment was given daily for 28 days with last dose being given 2 h prior to the test. A time sampling method was used to score the behavioral activity in each group. Results of both the studies indicated that animals given amisulpride displayed significant improvement in swimming behavior (p < 0.01), while markedly reducing immobility as compared to control group (p <0.01). Fluoxetine also showed significant difference in activity as compared to amisulpride and olanzapine (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference between amisulpride and olanzapine in terms of effect on immobility and swimming phases in albino mice (p > 0.05). We conclude that amisulpride per se has an antidepressant like activity comparable to that of olanzapine though the activity was significantly less than that of fluoxetine.",

    "85": "Zebrafish are becoming more widely used to study neurobehavioral pharmacology. We have developed a method to assess novel environment diving behavior of zebrafish as a model of stress response and anxiolytic drug effects. In a novel tank, zebrafish dwell in the bottom of the tank initially and then increase their swimming exploration to higher levels over time. We previously found that nicotine, which has anxiolytic effects in rodents and humans, significantly lessens the novel tank diving response in zebrafish. The specificity of the diving effect was validated with a novel vs. non-novel test tank. The novel tank diving response of zebrafish was tested when given three anxiolytic drugs from two different chemical and pharmacological classes: buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and diazepam. When the test tank was novel the diving response was clearly seen whereas it was significantly reduced when the test tank was not novel. Buspirone, a serotonergic (5HT(1A) receptor agonist) anxiolytic drug with some D(2) dopaminergic effect, had a pronounced anxiolytic-like effect in the zebrafish diving model at doses that did not have sedative effects. In contrast, chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug, which is an effective agonist at GABA-A receptors, did not produce signs of anxiolysis in zebrafish over a broad dose range up to those that caused sedation. Diazepam another benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug did produce an anxiolytic effect at doses that did not cause sedation. The zebrafish novel tank diving task can be useful in discriminating anxiolytic drugs of several classes (serotonergic, benzodiazepines and nicotinic).",

    "89": "Many smokers experience subsyndromal anxiety symptoms while smoking and during acute abstinence, which may contribute to relapse. We hypothesized that cortical gamma aminobutyric acid(A)-benzodiazepine receptor (GABA(A)-BZR) availability in smokers and nonsmokers might be related to the expression of subsyndromal anxiety, depressive, and pain symptoms. Cortical GABA(A)-BZRs were imaged in 15 smokers (8 men and 7 women), and 15 healthy age and sex-matched nonsmokers, and 4 abstinent tobacco smokers (3 men; 1 woman) using [(123)I]iomazenil and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Anxiety and depressive symptoms were measured using the Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and the Center for Epidemiology Scale for Depressive Symptoms (CES-D). The cold pressor task was administered to assess pain tolerance and sensitivity. The relationship between cortical GABA(A)-BZR availability, smoking status, and subsyndromal depression and anxiety symptoms, as well as pain tolerance and sensitivity, were evaluated. Surprisingly, there were no statistically significant differences in overall GABA(A)-BZR availability between smokers and nonsmokers or between active and abstinent smokers; however, cortical GABA(A)-BZR availability negatively correlated with subsyndromal state anxiety symptoms in nonsmokers but not in smokers. In nonsmokers, the correlation was seen across many brain areas with state anxiety [parietal (r = -0.47, P = 0.03), frontal (r = -0.46, P = 0.03), anterior cingulate (r = -0.47, P = 0.04), temporal (r = -0.47, P = 0.03), occipital (r = -0.43, P = 0.05) cortices, and cerebellum (r = -0.46, P = 0.04)], trait anxiety [parietal (r = -0.72, P = 0.02), frontal (r = -0.72, P = 0.02), and occipital (r = -0.65, P = 0.04) cortices] and depressive symptoms [parietal (r = -0.68; P = 0.02), frontal (r = -0.65; P = 0.03), anterior cingulate (r = -0.61; P = 0.04), and temporal (r = -0.66; P = 0.02) cortices]. The finding that a similar relationship between GABA(A)-BZR availability and anxiety symptoms was not observed in smokers suggests that there is a difference in GABA(A)-BZR function, but not number, in smokers. Thus, while subsyndromal anxiety and depressive symptoms in nonsmokers may be determined in part by GABA(A)-BZR availability, smoking disrupts this relationship. Aberrant regulation of GABA(A)-BZR function in vulnerable smokers may explain why some smokers experience subsyndromal anxiety and depression.",

Ro15-4513 has high affinity for receptors containing alpha(4/6) and alpha(5) subunits and lower affinity for alpha(1), alpha(2), and alpha(3) subunits. Flumazenil is nonselective for GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), and alpha(5) subunits and has low affinity for alpha(4/6)-containing receptors. Male (n = 9) and female (n = 8) cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were trained to discriminate ethanol (1.0 or 2.0 g/kg i.g., 30-min pretreatment) from water. Ethanol, PB, and midazolam dose-dependently substituted for ethanol (80% ethanol-appropriate responding). Ro15-4513 (0.003-0.56 mg/kg i.m., 5-min pretreatment) shifted the ethanol, PB, and midazolam dose-response functions rightward in a vast majority of monkeys tested (15/15, 16/17, and 11/12, respectively). In contrast, flumazenil (0.30-10.0 mg/kg i.m., 5-min pretreatment) shifted the ethanol, PB, and midazolam dose-response functions rightward in 9 of 16, 12 of 16, and 7 of 9 monkeys tested, respectively. In the monkeys showing antagonism with both Ro15-4513 and flumazenil, ethanol and PB substitution were antagonized more potently by Ro15-4513 than by flumazenil, whereas midazolam substitution was antagonized with similar potency. There were no sex or training dose differences, with the exception that flumazenil failed to antagonize ethanol substitution in males trained to discriminate 2.0 g/kg ethanol. GABA(A) receptors with high affinity for Ro15-4513 (i.e., containing alpha(4/6) and alpha(5) subunits) may be particularly important mediators of the multiple discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol through GABA(A) receptor systems.",

The capillary was filled by separation buffer (phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 2.5) and methanol (70:30 v/v)) and then hydrodynamically injected large volume of samples into capillary (1 psi, 200 s). Following was using sweeping buffer (phosphate buffer (75 mM, pH 2.5) and methanol (90:10 v/v) containing 65 mM SDS) to sweep and stack analytes. The separation voltage was set at -15 kV (anode at detector end). During method validation, calibration plots were linear (r > or = 0.992) over a range of 0.1-3 microg/mL for codeine, ketamine, and methamphetamine, 0.15-3 microg/mL for morphine, 0.1-1 microg/mL for alprazolam and oxazepam, and 0.1-1.2 microg/mL for other other benzodiazepines and its metabolites. During intra- and inter-day analysis, relative standards and relative errors were less than 14%. The analytes could be simultaneously analyzed and have a detection limit down to 20-50 ng/mL (S/N=3). The results showed good coincidence with GC-MS or LC-ESI-MS. This method was feasible for application to detect trace levels of abused drugs in AD' urine.",

Despite depression being considered the hallmark of bipolar disorder, there are no published systematic reviews or meta-analyses to evaluate the efficacy of modern atypical antipsychotics in bipolar depression. We systematically reviewed published or registered randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) of modern antipsychotics in adult bipolar I and/or II depressive patients (DSM-IV criteria). Efficacy outcomes were assessed based on changes in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during an 8-wk period. Data were combined through meta-analysis using risk ratio as an effect size with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and with a level of statistical significance of 5% (p<0.05). We identified five RCTs; four involved antipsychotic monotherapy and one addressed both monotherapy and combination with an antidepressant. The two quetiapine trials analysed the safety and efficacy of two doses: 300 and 600 mg/d. The only olanzapine trial assessed olanzapine monotherapy within a range of 5-20 mg/d and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination within a range of 5-20 mg/d and 6-12 mg/d, respectively. The two aripiprazole placebo-controlled trials assessed doses of 5-30 mg/d. Quetiapine and olanzapine trials (3/5, 60%) demonstrated superiority over placebo (p<0.001). Only 2/5 (40%) (both aripiprazole trials) failed in the primary efficacy measure after the first 6 wk.

In this paper we have investigated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism and GABA receptors in platelets and in cultured neurons to see whether platelets' GABA mimics neuronal GABA receptor activities. We used the ELISA technique for detecting the GABA concentration in platelet rich plasma and cultured neurons. The functional effects of GABA and its receptor ligands on platelets were determined using an aggregometer. We found that the GABA concentration is 30% lower in platelets than in neurons and in both preparations GABA was metabolized by GABA transaminase (GABA-T). GABA potentiated calcium dependent platelet aggregation with a higher value in washed platelets suspension (WPS) then in platelet rich plasma (PRP). This effect was inhibited by benzodiazepines, calcium channel blockers and the selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase antagonist Wortmannin. GABA neurotransmission is involved in most aspects of normal brain function and can be perturbed in many neuropathologic conditions. We concluded that platelets could be further developed to be used as a peripheral model to study neuronal GABAergic function and its abnormality in diseases such as epilepsy and schizophrenia. Furthermore our results indicated that PI3-kinase is involved in calcium dependent GABA induced platelet aggregation as this synergistic effect is inhibited by Wortmannin in dose dependent manner.",

We investigated the influence of CYP1A2*1F (-163A, rs762551) and serotonergic polymorphisms on olanzapine serum concentrations and clinical outcome in a naturalistic clinical setting. Included were 124 Caucasian psychiatric inpatients treated with olanzapine for at least 4 weeks with steady-state serum concentrations available for 73 patients. The CYP1A2*1F polymorphism was reported to affect the inducibility of CYP1A2. In our study population, CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype alone resulted in a 22% reduction of dose-/body weight-normalized olanzapine serum concentrations compared to homo- and heterozygote carriers of CYP1A2*1A (both groups without inducers). This effect was independent of the well-known effect of inducing agents (here tobacco smoke and carbamazepine which led to on average 28% lower concentrations in CYP1A2*1A carriers and 26% lower concentrations in CYP1A2*1F/*1F carriers). Consistently, patients with the CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype taking inducers had 22% lower concentrations compared to CYP1A2*1A carriers taking inducers. The influence of genotype alone remained significant after Bonferroni's post hoc test. Higher olanzapine concentrations were significantly correlated with better improvement of paranoid and depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenic disorders (Spearman's r=0.5, P=0.026 and P=0.006, respectively). No relationship between serum concentrations and the side effects (DOTES) score was detected. However, patients with the 5-HTR2A intron 2 (rs7997012) AA genotype suffered from more pronounced side effects compared to carriers of the GA or GG genotype (P=0.018 and P=0.002). Short-term weight gain under olanzapine therapy was significantly lower for 5-HTR2C -759 T-allele carriers (P=0.011). Our data suggest that the CYP1A2*1F/*1F genotype exhibits a significant influence on olanzapine concentrations independent of other inducing factors. Thus, CYP1A2*1F genotyping may be useful for clinical treatment decisions given the fact that olanzapine serum concentrations correlated with treatment response. Side effects and weight gain, however, seem to be more influenced by serotonergic polymorphisms.",

    "122": "Intra-amygdala infusion of midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, produces anxiolytic-like effects in mice when first exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and blocks antinociception induced in mice confined in the open arm of the EPM. However, benzodiazepines fail to alter anxiety in maze-experienced rodents, a phenomenon defined as \"one-trial tolerance\" (OTT). The main purpose of the present study was to investigate whether intra-amygdala midazolam attenuates the open arm-induced antinociception (OAA) in maze-experienced mice. Nociception was assessed by the writhing test (intra-peritoneal injection of 0.6% acetic acid). In Experiment 1, nociception was recorded in maze-experienced mice without prior drug treatment. Experiment 2 investigated the effects of systemic midazolam (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg, s.c.), injected before EPM trial 2, on OAA in maze-experienced mice. In Experiment 3, the effects on OAA of intra-amygdala midazolam (30 nmol/0.1 microl), injected before trial 1 (maze-naive) or before trial 2 (maze-experienced), were observed. The effects on OAA of intra-amygdala midazolam injected before trial 1 and trial 2 were also investigated (Experiment 4). The results showed that OAA remained unchanged in maze-experienced mice and was insensitive to systemic midazolam. However, intra-amygdala midazolam attenuated OAA in maze-naive mice, but not in maze-experienced mice. Even when given before both trial 1 and trial 2, intra-amygdala midazolam failed to alter OAA in maze-experienced mice. Taken together, these results confirm that the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex located within the amygdala plays a role in OAA in maze-naive mice. The lack of effects following systemic or intra-amygdala midazolam on OAA in maze-experienced mice suggests that the OTT is also observed in the modulation of nociception and that the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor located within this limbic forebrain structure participates in this process.",

Presently, HAART treatment, a combination of reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease inhibitors is also unsuccessful due to the virus getting resistant to the drugs because of mutational changes. Two types of RT inhibitors exist namely nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). The NNRTIs which bind to an allosteric site on RT are an important arsenal of drugs against HIV-1. The specificity of NNRTIs towards HIV-1 has led to extensive structural and molecular modelling studies of enzyme complexes and chemical synthesis of second and third-generation NNRTIs. The major drawbacks of NNRTIs are generation of resistance and pharmacokinetic problems. By mutational studies of non-nucleoside inhibitor binding pocket (NNIBP) some amino acids which were found to play an important role in proper binding resulted less prone to mutation.

Studies by the former methods suggest the different aggregation abilities of the investigated bile acid derivatives. In an aqueous solution, 7-MKC has a somewhat lower CMC value (43 mM) than 12-MKC (50 mM). Further, it was found that, in addition to primary micelles, 7-MKC forms also secondary micelles. In the experiments with probe (hydrophobic) molecules, the aggregation properties of investigated bile acids did not differ in water, whereas the presence of urea altered the aggregation of 7-MKC. Based on the CMC value, 7-MKC is more hydrophobic than 12-MKC. The apparent hydrophobicity of 7-MKC is a consequence of the formation of secondary micelles, shifting the monomer equilibrium to the direction of primary micelles, which is manifested as a decrease in the CMC value.",

Cocaine, the second most frequently consumed illicit substance after cannabis in both United States and Europe, remains the psychostimulant of choice for many, often mixed with other psychoactive substances. It is most frequently associated with alcohol, and a diagnosis of alcohol dependence may be made in 50%-90% of cocaine-dependent subjects. When treating cocaine addicts, it is important to characterize not only the modalities of cocaine use but also the modes of consumption of other substances, notably alcohol. Alcohol is often consumed to reduce the anxiety and discomfort resulting from cocaine withdrawal. Alcohol may also trigger an irresistible craving for cocaine, which can result in frequent relapses even after several months of cocaine abstinence. Brief intervention and motivational interview techniques can help to reduce alcohol use and prevent cocaine relapses in this context. In the absence of severe cocaine withdrawal symptoms, the guidelines for treating alcohol withdrawal syndrome may be applied for cocaine and alcohol codependence. Lower doses of benzodiazepine are needed for treating this alcohol-cocaine withdrawal syndrome. Cognitive behavioral therapies, alone or in combination with psychotropic medication, are accepted therapeutic approaches for alcohol-cocaine dependence. It is also accepted that over the long term the combination of psychotherapeutic treatments is usually more effective than any single approach. In the absence of a therapeutic consensus, four drugs (disulfiram, baclofen, topiramate and naltrexone) are most often recommended to promote and maintain abstinence; nevertheless, their efficacy has not been proven and their use remains experimental and off-label: they have not been approved by health authorities as treatment for addictions.",

Hence, addiction is now generally considered a chronic brain disease. Chronic use of cannabis impairs cognitive functions, perception, reaction time, learning, memory, concentration, social skills and control of emotions. There may also be panic reactions, hallucinations, paranoid states with fixed delusions and even acute psychosis. These impairments have obvious negative implications for the operation of a motor vehicle or machinery and performance at school or workplace as well as the development of a healthy family, a strong national economy and a secure society.

In an effort to identify small molecules with greater potency, the structure of olanzapine was used as a template to search commercially available chemical inventories for compounds with similar features. These compounds were evaluated for their ability to protect cells against glutamine deprivation and low-serum conditions. Positive compounds, 'hits' from initial screening, were then tested for stimulation of neurite outgrowth, alone and in combination with suboptimum concentrations of nerve growth factor (NGF). Numerous neuroprotective compounds (mw < 550 Da) were identified that significantly stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. These included 4', 6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole, a nuclear stain; staurosporine, an antibiotic and kinase inhibitor; and 2-phenylamino-adenosine, an adenosine analog. The small molecules were comparable with NGF, and in fact, replaced NGF in outgrowth assays. Pharmacophore analysis of the hits led to the design and synthesis of an active compound, LSU-D84, which represented an initial lead for drug discovery efforts.",

    "156": "A CTA was induced by injecting lithium chloride (LiCl; 6 mEq x kg(-1)) 30 min after the animal had imbibed a novel 0.5% saccharin solution. In other animals, neophobia was attenuated by a single access to the novel 0.5% saccharin solution, followed only by injection of saline.", 
    "157": "Pre-conditioning administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ; 6-24 mg x kg(-1), i.p.) and alprazolam (0.3-1 mg x kg(-1), p.o.) resulted in a CTA that did not differ initially from that observed in vehicle-treated controls, but which showed faster extinction. The acquisition of AN was impaired only after the higher doses of CDZ (12-24 mg x kg(-1), i.p.) or alprazolam (1 mg x kg(-1), i.p.). The results show that in this test, altered acquisition of an aversive CTA memory by anxiolytic benzodiazepines is reflected in more rapid extinction. Moreover, at low doses, these drugs showed selectivity for weakening CTA learning compared to AN learning. Evidence is discussed that selective weakening of aversive memory formation is a clinically relevant effect of anxiolytic benzodiazepines.",

Seven new cases (28%) in the olanzapine group and 4 new cases (17%) in the risperidone group met criteria for being overweight or at risk for being overweight. A significant increase in mean systolic blood pressure was found in subjects receiving olanzapine compared with those receiving risperidone (+5.4 mm Hg vs. -3.2 mm Hg; P=0.044), while diastolic blood pressure did not differ between the treatment groups. A significant increase in risk factors for diabetes mellitus (P=0.008) and in overall risk factors for metabolic syndrome (P=0.013) was found in the olanzapine group over the course of treatment, whereas no significant effect on risk factors for diabetes or metabolic syndrome was found in the risperidone group.",

    "162": "Gabapentin (Neurontin) is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of epilepsy and post-herpetic neuralgia. Despite lack of strong evidence, gabapentin is also often prescribed off-label for psychiatric conditions. The case described here involved a 38-year-old male physician with substance intoxication delirium and psychoactive substance dependence due to high self-administered doses of gabapentin, which had been prescribed at lower doses in combination with buspirone and bupropion for depression and anxiety. This unusual case of gabapentin dependence and abuse involved toxic delirium, intense cravings, and a prolonged post-withdrawal confusional state reminiscent of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Gabapentin is a central nervous system inhibitory agent with likely gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and non-GABAergic mechanisms of action. The similarity between benzodiazepine withdrawal and what this patient experienced with gabapentin suggests a common role for GABA-related effects. The case reported here suggests the need for heightened concern regarding the off-label prescription of this drug to vulnerable individuals with psychiatric conditions.",

The disposition index (SI x the acute insulin response to glucose), which measures how the body compensates for insulin resistance to maintain a normal glucose level, was significantly lower in the group treated with clozapine than in the group treated with olanzapine (1067+/-1390 vs. 2521+/-2805; P=0.013), suggesting that the subjects treated with clozapine had a reduced compensatory response to IR compared with the subjects treated with olanzapine. In the clozapine group, both higher WC and BMI were significantly associated with elevated HOMA-IR and lower SI; however, WC was a stronger correlate of IR than BMI, as measured by SI (-0.50 vs. -0.40). In the olanzapine group, neither WC nor BMI was significantly associated with any measure of glucose metabolism.", 
    "166": "In this study, WC was the single best anthropometric surrogate for predicting IR in patients treated with clozapine but not olanzapine.

    "167": "Fast inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain relies on ionotropic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)R). Eighteen genes code for GABA(A)R subunits, but little is known about the epsilon subunit. Our aim was to identify the synaptic transmission properties displayed by native receptors incorporating epsilon. Immunogold localization detected epsilon at synaptic sites on locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. In situ hybridization revealed prominent signals from epsilon, and mRNAs, some low beta1 and beta3 signals, and no gamma signal. Using in vivo extracellular and in vitro patch-clamp recordings in LC, we established that neuron firing rates, GABA-activated currents, and mIPSC charge were insensitive to the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam (FLU), in agreement with the characteristics of recombinant receptors including an epsilon subunit. Surprisingly, LC provided binding sites for benzodiazepines, and GABA-induced currents were potentiated by diazepam (DZP) in the micromolar range. A number of GABA(A)R ligands significantly potentiated GABA-induced currents, and zinc ions were only active at concentrations above 1 muM, further indicating that receptors were not composed of only alpha and beta subunits, but included an epsilon subunit. In contrast to recombinant receptors including an epsilon subunit, GABA(A)R in LC showed no agonist-independent opening. Finally, we determined that mIPSCs, as well as ensemble currents induced by ultra-fast GABA application, exhibited surprisingly slow rise times. Our work thus defines the signature of native GABA(A)R with a subunit composition including epsilon: differential sensitivity to FLU and DZP and slow rise time of currents. We further propose that alpha(3,) beta(1/3,) and epsilon subunits compose GABA(A)R in LC.", 
    "168": "A single exposure to the elevated plus-maze test (EPM) increases open arms avoidance and reduces or abolishes the anxiolytic-like effect of benzodiazepines assessed during a second trial, a phenomenon defined as \"one-trial tolerance\" (OTT). It has been emphasized that the dorsal portion of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (dPAG) plays a role on this enhanced aversion phenomenon in maze-experienced rodents. Given that intra-dPAG injections of a wide range of serotonergic 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor agonists produce anxiolytic-like effects in maze-na\u00efve rodents, the present study examined the effects of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (5.6 and 10.0nmol in 0.15microl) the preferential 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist DOI (2.0 and 8.0nmol in 0.1microl) and the preferential 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist MK-212 (21.2 and 63.6nmol in 0.1microl) microinjected into the dPAG prior to Trial 1 and Trial 2 on the behaviour of mice in the EPM. Test sessions were recorded and subsequently scored for anxiety-like behaviour (percentage of open arms entries and time) as well as general locomotor activity (closed arm entries). The results showed a lack of 8-OH-DPAT (5.6 and 10.0nmol) effect on the behaviour of maze-na\u00efve and maze-experienced mice, while intra-dPAG microinfusions of DOI (8nmol) reduced anxiety-like behaviour only in maze-experienced mice that had received a similar treatment prior to Trial 1. Furthermore, intra-dPAG MK-212 (63.6nmol) showed an anxiolytic-like effect on both Trial 1 and Trial 2. Importantly, these effects were observed in the absence of any significant change in closed arm entries, the parameter considered to be a valid index of locomotor activity in the plus-maze. These results support the dPAG as a crucial structure involved in the neurobiology of the OTT phenomenon as well as accounting the role of the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors located within this midbrain structure on the emotional state induced by EPM test and retest paradigm mice.",

Participants were asked to provide data regarding patterns of drug use in the previous six months, including types of drugs consumed, method of consumption, frequency of use, and weekly income spent on drugs. We also conducted bivariate analyses to identify a possible effect of a reported increase in police presence on measures of drug use and related risk behaviors among study participants.

All patients were evaluated with rating scales, and genetic analyses were performed. We found statistically significant differences between pretreatment and posttreatment body mass index and weight change in Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPAR-gamma2.

    "189": "Peduncular hallucinosis is a rare phenomenon characterized by visual hallucination consisting of vivid, colored image of people, animals, scenes or geometric patterns. In most of the cases the hallucination is accompanied by sleeping disorder, and is by the patient recognized as not being real. It can be observed mainly in patients with thalamic/midbrain vascular disease, and is less frequently seen in brain stem tumor. The damage of the ascending reticular activating system by brain stem compression causing dream activity releasing what is normally suppressed during wakefulness is thought to be the mechanism of peduncular hallucinosis. The authors report a 13-year-old female presenting peduncular hallucinosis due to brainstem compression by a pineocytoma. The patient had a 3-month history of complex visual hallucination and slight somnolence. The hallucination mainly consisted of TV game characters, animals, and vegetables which were colorful and vivid. She was well oriented and realized that the hallucination was not real. MRI showed a pineal mass compressing the quadrigeminal plate inferiorly. There was mild obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueduct stenosis. The tumor was totally removed and was pathologically diagnosed as pineocytoma. After the surgery, the hallucination ameliorated remarkably. Although the administration of benzodiazepine exacerbated the hallucination and sleep disorder, oral carbamazepine was clearly effective and produced nearly complete disappearance of hallucination.

Among the many biochemical cascades likely mediating HIV-1-associated neuronal injury is enhancement of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function and progression to excitotoxicity, an effect that may be directly or indirectly related to accumulation in brain of the HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (Tat) factor. The present studies were designed to examine the hypothesis that binge-like EtOH pre-exposure would enhance effects of Tat on NMDA receptor function. These studies employed a modified in vivo binge EtOH exposure regimen designed to produce peak blood EtOH levels (BEL) of <200 mg/dl in adult male rats and were designed to examine effects of intra-hippocampal injection of Tat (0.5 microl/500 pM/2 min) on EtOH withdrawal-related behavior, spatial learning, and histological measures. Unilateral cannulae were implanted into the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) pyramidal cell layer of animals prior to beginning a 4-day binge EtOH regimen. EtOH was administered via intragastric intubation ( approximately 3.0-5.0 g/kg) with dose determined by behavioral ratings of intoxication daily for 4 days (at 08:00, 16:00, and 24:00 h). EtOH withdrawal behaviors were monitored 12 h after the last administration of EtOH. Morris water maze learning was assessed during the following 4 days, at which times brains were harvested for autoradiographic measurement of NMDA receptor density and neuroinflammation. Maximal BELs of 187.69 mg/dl were observed 60 min after EtOH administration on day 2 of the regimen. In contrast, peak BELs of approximately 100 mg/dl were observed 60 min after EtOH administration on day 4 of the regimen, suggesting development of metabolic tolerance. Significant behavioral abnormalities were observed in EtOH withdrawn animals, including tremor and seizures. Intra-CA1 region injection of Tat significantly potentiated EtOH withdrawal behavioral abnormalities, an effect that was reduced by MK-801 pre-exposure. While EtOH withdrawn animals showed learning similar to control animals, EtOH withdrawn animals that received intra-CA1 Tat injection demonstrated persisting deficits in spatial learning on days 3 and 4 of training, effects that were markedly reduced by administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 30 min prior to Tat injection. No changes in [(3)H]MK-801 binding were observed. Binding density of [(3)H]PK11195, a ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors expressed on activated microglia, was elevated proximal to cannula tracks in all animals, but was not altered by EtOH or Tat exposure. These findings suggest that EtOH abuse and/or dependence in HIV-positive individuals may promote HIV-1-associated cognitive deficits by altering NMDA receptor function in the absence of microglial activation or neuroinflammation.",

Bergmann glial cells in the cerebellum have Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs assembled with GluR1 and GluR4. To examine the role of these Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs, we converted them into Ca(2+)-impermeable receptors by adenoviral-mediated delivery of the GluR2 gene. This resulted in the retraction of the glial processes ensheathing the synapses on Purkinje cell dendritic spines and retard action of the removal of synaptically released glutamate, indicating that glutamate regulates the morphology of glial processes by activating Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs, and the glial Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs are indispensable for proper structural and functional interactions between the Bergmann glia and the glutamatergic synapses. Glioblastoma multiforme is the most malignant type of brain tumor. Glioblastoma cells express Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs assembled from the GluR1 and/or GluR4 subunits, and the conversion of these units to Ca(2+)-impermeable receptors by adenovirus-mediated transfer of the GluR2 gene inhibited cell locomotion and induced apoptosis. In contrast, the overexpression of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors facilitated migration and proliferation of the tumor cells. Thus, Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors are important in the migration and proliferation of neoplastic glias. The blockage of these receptors may be an attractive therapeutic target for preventing of invasive growth.",

Sedation with propofol plus midazolam and/or fentanyl produced better operating conditions than sedation with propofol alone and was associated with shorter procedure times. Recovery times, recall, dreaming, quality of recovery, and patient satisfaction with care were similar between the groups. Administration of >2 mg of midazolam was a predictor of impaired cognitive function at discharge.", 
    "205": "Significant cognitive impairment was common at discharge from elective outpatient colonoscopy. However, the addition of midazolam and/or fentanyl to propofol sedation did not result in more cognitive impairment than the use of propofol alone. Furthermore, the use of adjuvants improved the ease of colonoscopy without increasing the rate of complications or prolonging early recovery times..", 
    "206": "Since its introduction in 2006, 43 patients with various forms of status epilepticus (SE) have been treated with the intravenous formulation of levetiracetam (LEV) in our clinic. After ineffective treatment with benzodiazepines, intravenous LEV was administered as a short infusion (nonconvulsive and subtle SE) at a dose of 1000 or 2000 mg. In cases of convulsive SE, a fractionated injection of 1000 or 2000 mg was used. When the results for both are combined, SE could be terminated in 19 of 43 patients. Intravenous LEV was more effective in simple focal SE (3/5), complex focal SE (11/18) and myoclonic status (2/2) than in nonconvulsive (2/8) and subtle (1/2) SE. In no case was (secondarily) generalized convulsive status epilepticus (0/8) terminated. Intravenous LEV was also well-tolerated when injected in fractionated form. No severe adverse reactions were observed. As a result of this investigation, intravenous LEV in moderate doses may represent an efficacious and well-tolerated alternative for the treatment of focal (simple and complex focal) and myoclonic SE. Further investigations are needed to confirm this assumption as the patient numbers are quite low.", 
    "207": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain where it regulates many physiological functions including sleep, anxiety, reward and memory formation. GABAergic neurons and ionotropic GABA(A) receptors are also found in the spinal cord dorsal horn where they control the propagation of pain signals from the periphery to higher central nervous system areas. Recent evidence indicates that diminished inhibitory control at this site is a major factor in chronic pain syndromes. So far, this knowledge could not be translated into clinical pain therapy, probably because of the widespread actions of GABA in the central nervous system. The identification of GABA(A) receptor subtypes responsible for spinal antihyperalgesic effects has recently opened new avenues for the development of subtype-selective modulators of GABA(A) receptors. First results raise hopes that such compounds will be active against inflammatory and neuropathic pain but devoid of many of the side-effects of the established benzodiazepine-like drugs.", 
    "208": "Adjuvant use of nutritional and herbal medicines has potential to increase the efficacy of synthetic pharmaceuticals, and perhaps also decrease their side-effects by allowing lower doses to be prescribed. We evaluated current evidence for adjuvant use of nutritional and herbal medicines with antidepressants, mood stabilizers and benzodiazepines; and explored novel future areas of research. The paper also critiques current evidence for co-administration of St. John's wort with synthetic antidepressants. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and the Chinese Science Citation Database. Search results were supplemented by a review of reference lists and a forward search using the Web of Science. Where possible we calculated effect sizes. Encouraging evidence exists for the use of omega-3 fatty acids, SAMe, folic acid and l-tryptophan adjuvantly with antidepressants to enhance response and improve efficacy. Various nutrients also have emerging evidence as effective adjuncts with antipsychotics and mood stabilizers. While some evidence supports nutritional adjuvancy with various psychopharmacotherapies, adjuvant use of herbal therapies has not been sufficiently studied to warrant standard clinical application. This remains a promising area of research via robust, safety-conscious studies.", 
    "209": "As the currently recommended laboratory techniques for assessing cardiovascular and respiratory functions are telemetry and plethysmography, we therefore combined both in a single rodent model. The purpose of the present work was to assess the potential influence of body growth on the recorded parameters, to verify the sensitivity of the system to detect well known pharmacological effects of reference drugs, and to determine their reproducibility over time.", 
    "210": "Telemetry instrumented rats were enrolled in successive experiments over a total of 5 months. In each run, they were placed in individual plethysmography chambers for 6h, and received a single intraperitoneal injection of vehicle or test compound. Heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and respiratory parameters were measured in real time. Six of these 16 rats were submitted 5 times at one month intervals to a vehicle injection, and six rats received theophylline (30 mg/kg) twice at 4 months interval. Nine other reference compounds were also tested at a single dose.", 
    "211": "Analysis of baseline data mainly showed correlations between body weight or age and heart rate, as well as tidal volume. In the five successive runs, handling-induced perturbations were noted in all the parameters during 60 to 90 min. The effects of the different reference drugs were consistent with data published in animals and man. The response to theophylline was qualitatively similar at 4 months interval.", 
    "212": "We established a combined model of telemetry and plethysmography in the conscious rat, allowing the reuse of the animals over several successive pharmacodynamic studies. Although a shift of some parameters, particularly heart rate and tidal volume, was noted with age and body weight, this can easily be managed by appropriate design measures. We showed that the combined system can detect negative or positive effects on both cardiovascular and respiratory functions with enough sensitivity.", 
    "213": "The widely reported effects of oxytocin (OT) on CNS function has generated considerable interest in the therapeutic potential for targeting this system for a variety of human psychiatric diseases, including anxiety disorders, autism, schizophrenia, and depression. The utility of synthetic OT, as both a research tool and neurotherapeutic, is limited by the physiochemical properties inherent in most neuropeptides, notably its short half-life and poor blood brain barrier penetration. Subsequently, the discovery and development of non-peptide molecules that act as selective agonists of the oxytocin receptor (OTR) has been an important goal of the field. In this study, we report the receptor and behavioral pharmacology of WAY-267464, a first generation small-molecule OTR agonist. WAY-267464 is a high-affinity, potent, and selective (vs. V1a, V2, V1b) agonist of the OTR. In assays measuring both behavioral (four-plate test, elevated zero maze) and autonomic (stress-induced hyperthermia) parameters of the anxiety response, WAY-267464 exhibits an anxiolytic-like profile similar to OT. We have demonstrated that the anxiolytic-like profile of WAY-267464 is mediated through central sites of action. WAY-267464 also significantly reverses disruption in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle reflex induced by either MK-801 or amphetamine, similar to the antipsychotic-like effects previously reported for OT. Interestingly, in the mouse tail suspension test, WAY-267464 failed to produce changes in immobility that are seen with OT, raising the question of whether the antidepressant-like activity of OT may be working independently of the OTR. A selective OTR antagonist also failed to block the effects of OT on immobility in the TST. The significance of these findings for shaping the clinical development of OTR agonists is discussed.", 
    "214": "Milnacipran (Savella) inhibits both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake and is distinguished by a nearly 3-fold greater potency in inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake in vitro compared with serotonin. We evaluated the ability of milnacipran to inhibit and induce human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro. In human liver microsomes, milnacipran did not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, or 2D6 (IC(50) >or= 100 microM); whereas, a comparator with dual reuptake properties [duloxetine (Cymbalta)] inhibited CYP2D6 (IC(50) = 7 microM) and CYP2B6 (IC(50) = 15 microM) with a relatively high potency. Milnacipran inhibited CYP3A4/5 in a substrate-dependent manner (i.e., midazolam 1'-hydroxylation IC(50) approximately 30 microM; testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation IC(50) approximately 100 microM); whereas, duloxetine inhibited both CYP3A4/5 activities with equal potency (IC(50) = 37 and 38 microM, respectively). Milnacipran produced no time-dependent inhibition (<10%) of P450 activity, whereas duloxetine produced time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C19, and 3A4/5. To evaluate P450 induction, freshly isolated human hepatocytes (n = 3) were cultured and treated once daily for 3 days with milnacipran (3, 10, and 30 microM), after which microsomal P450 activities were measured. Whereas positive controls (omeprazole, phenobarbital, and rifampin) caused anticipated P450 induction, milnacipran had minimal effect on CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9, or 2C19 activity. The highest concentration of milnacipran (30 microM; >10 times plasma C(max)) produced 2.6- and 2.2-fold increases in CYP2B6 and CYP3A4/5 activity (making it 26 and 34% as effective as phenobarbital and rifampin, respectively). Given these results, milnacipran is not expected to cause clinically significant P450 inhibition or induction.", 
    "215": "The aim of this 6-month observational study was to examine which clinical, eating- and lifestyle-related factors were associated with weight gain in patients initiating or switching to oral olanzapine for the treatment of schizophrenia or bipolar mania. A total of 622 outpatients in four countries (China, Mexico, Romania, Taiwan) were assessed at monthly intervals for up to 6 months. Mixed model repeated-measures analysis, adjusted for baseline weight, was used to identify which factors were associated with weight gain during olanzapine therapy. After 6 months of therapy, the LS mean weight change was +4.1 kg and 43.9% of the patients had significant (> or = 7%) weight gain. Early significant weight gain after 2 months of therapy occurred in 23.4% of the patients and these patients gained significantly more weight overall. Ten factors were associated with weight gain during 6 months of olanzapine therapy in an exploratory multivariate analysis: country, housing conditions, stronger appetite, excessive amount of food needed to feel full, eating until uncomfortably full, thoughts preoccupied with food, meal location, increased meal frequency, evening snack consumption, and a lower amount of vigorous exercise. These results indicate that the influence of environmental, eating- and lifestyle-related factors should be considered when assessing weight gain during olanzapine therapy.", 
    "216": "THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE: To review the causes, clinical signs, pathophysiology, consequences, and treatment of seizures and status epilepticus in critically ill patients. Only 25% of people, who have seizures and status epilepticus, have epilepsy as well. In the intensive care settings, seizures and status epilepticus are a common neurologic complication, which is attributable to primary neurologic pathology (stroke, hemorrhage, tumor, central nervous system infection, head trauma) or secondary to critical illness (anoxic brain damage, intoxications, metabolic abnormalities) and clinical management. There are three main subtypes of status epilepticus in intensive care units: generalized convulsive status epilepticus, focal motor status epilepticus, and nonconvulsive status epilepticus. A seizure is a consequence of electrical neurological derangement because of sudden imbalance between the inhibitory and excitatory forces within the network of cortical neurons. The main inhibiting neurotransmitter in the brain is gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which binds to GABA-A and GABA-B receptors. The main excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which binds to N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. Different ions (Cl(-), K(+), Na(+), Ca(2+)) also play a role in the pathophysiology of seizures. Prolonged status epilepticus may lead to different systemic and neurologic consequences. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is one of the most common emergencies encountered in clinical practice, which requires immediate treatment. The first-line drugs are benzodiazepines (lorazepam, diazepam), the second-line ones - phenytoin and fosphenytoin. For the treatment of refractory status epilepticus, barbiturates (phenobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental), valproate, midazolam, propofol, and isoflurane are used. The dosage of drugs and parameters to monitor are referred in the article. The mortality from generalized convulsive status epilepticus is 15-50%; the main factors, influencing prognosis, are the cause and the duration of status epilepticus and age of a patient.", 
    "217": "The pathogenesis, pathophysiology, and pharmacotherapy of sleep bruxism (SB) are still not fully understood. We investigated symptomatology, objective and subjective sleep and awakening quality of middle-aged bruxers compared with controls and acute effects of clonazepam 1 mg compared with placebo by polysomnography and psychometry. Twenty-one drug-free bruxers spent 3 nights in the sleep lab, 21 age- and sex-matched controls 2 nights. Clinically, bruxers exhibited deteriorated PSQI, SAS, SDS and IRLSSG measures, polysomnographically impaired sleep maintenance, increased movement time, stage shift index, periodic leg movements (PLM) and arousals and psychometrically deteriorated subjective sleep and awakening quality, evening/morning well-being, drive, mood, drowsiness, attention variability, memory, and fine motor activity. As compared with placebo, clonazepam significantly decreased the SB index in all patients (mean: -42 +/- 15%). Sleep efficiency, maintenance, latency, awakenings and nocturnal wake time, the stage shift index, S1, PLM, the arousal index, subjective sleep and awakening quality, and fine motor activity improved.", 
    "218": "Brainstem auditory-evoked responses (BAEP) have been reported to be unchanged in the presence of drugs used for induction and maintenance of general anesthesia. The aim of this study was to investigate if the signal segments after the auditory stimulus that are used to average the evoked response change under the influence of general anesthesia.", 
    "219": "BAEPs of 156 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were investigated. Anesthetic regimen was randomized as a combination of one of four hypnotic drugs supplemented by one of four opioids. Signal segments after the auditory stimulus were obtained at six different periods of anesthesia. Power and phase properties of wavelet-filtered single-sweep auditory-evoked activity accounting for the waveform of the averaged BAEP wave V and the stability of amplitude and latency of the averaged BAEP wave V over periods were analyzed.", 
    "220": "Amplitude and latency of wave V change slightly with no significant difference between the periods. During anesthesia, however, the power of single sweeps is significantly reduced, whereas phase-locking properties of the according signal segments are significantly enhanced. This effect is independent of the anesthetic or opioid used.", 
    "221": "General anesthesia affects phase and power of the segments of the electroencephalogram related to BAEP wave V. This study's results support the idea that temporally precise responses from a large number of neurons in the brainstem might play a crucial role in encoding and passing sensory information to higher subcortical and cortical areas of the brain."
