To assess whether aggressive therapy of these patients in the intensive care unit is justified, we retrospectively studied all patients with tetanus hospitalized in our institution between 1968 and 1989. Patients over the age of 70 years fared as well as those under 70 years and recovered without sequelae. These results favor aggressive treatment of elderly patients with tetanus in the intensive care unit.", 
    "1": "Midazolam is the first water-soluble benzodiazepine. As with other benzodiazepines it has amnestic, sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, and anticonvulsant properties. Midazolam is about two to four times more potent than diazepam. Midazolam has been extensively used for a variety of outpatient procedures, but there has been no documentation of its safety in emergency department patients. The authors retrospectively reviewed all patients receiving midazolam during a 2-year period at the University of Cincinnati Center for Emergency Care. The study population consisted of 389 patients (men 56%; women 44%) with an average age of 33.3 years. Midazolam was used intravenously for sedation before a wide variety of painful procedures and for agitation control. The average dose was 3.86 mg, with a range of 0.5 mg to 20.0 mg. The majority of patients (79.2%) received narcotics or sedative/hypnotic agents in addition to midazolam. There was an overall complication rate of 1.0%. Two patients (0.5%) developed clinically significant respiratory depression after midazolam use. Both patients had also received fentanyl citrate and the respiratory depression was reversed with naloxone. Two patients (0.5%) receiving several other drugs developed short periods of hypotension. There were no apparent long term sequelae. The authors conclude that midazolam can be safely used in the emergency department setting. Careful dosing and titration to the desired clinical effects is mandatory. Patients should be closely monitored to maximize safety.", 
    "2": "The efficacy of diazepam, haloperidol, propranolol, and yohimbine in antagonizing the toxic manifestations of d-amphetamine were studied in rats. In the control group of animals given 75 mg/kg intraperitoneal (ip) d-amphetamine, 95% developed seizures, and 100% died in mean times of 12.6 +/- 1.0 and 50.1 +/- 5.9 minutes, respectively. Significant protection against d-amphetamine-induced death was afforded by pretreatment with haloperidol (1.0 to 20.0 mg/kg) or propranolol (20.0 to 30.0 mg/kg). Diazepam (5.0 to 10.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the incidence of clinically overt seizures but offered no protection against death. Yohimbine (2.5 to 10.0 mg/kg) was ineffective in preventing either seizures or death. When haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) was administered in combination with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg), the incidence of death was no different than if haloperidol were given alone. In combination, haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg) and propranolol (10.0 mg/kg) reduced death more than either agent alone. These data support a protective role of haloperidol or propranolol in the treatment of d-amphetamine intoxication and show no protection with diazepam or yohimbine.", 
    "3": "The relation between diazepam use and breast cancer was explored in two case-control studies. The first (1981-1987) was a hospital-based study in the United States of 3,078 cases of breast cancer, 1,259 controls with other malignancies, and 672 controls with nonmalignant conditions. The relative risk estimates for regular diazepam use (at least 4 days per week for at least 6 months) that antedated the diagnosis of breast cancer by at least 12 months were 1.0 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-1.7) using the cancer controls and 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-1.8) using the noncancer controls. Risk factors for breast cancer were taken into account in the estimates. There was no association for regular use lasting at least 5 years or for regular use that took place exclusively in the recent or more distant past. The second study (1982-1986), conducted in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, was community-based, and included 607 cases of breast cancer and 1,214 neighbor controls selected from municipal voting and census records. After control of confounding, the relative risk estimate for regular diazepam use was 0.8 (95% CI 0.5-1.3). Again, there was no association for long-term, past, or recent regular use. The results of both studies suggest that regular diazepam use does not increase the risk of breast cancer. The findings are strengthened by the similarity of the results using three different control groups--women with cancer, women with nonmalignant conditions, and neighbors.", 
    "4": "The possibility to elicit convulsions in rabbits after flunarizine, iv was investigated. A flunarizine solution, 3.3 mg/ml, was given iv at a rate of 1.5 ml/min in three fractional doses every 30 min. Action of anti-epileptic drugs in seizures induced by flunarizine was additionally examined. Convulsive seizures occurred 2-10 min after the last successive dose of flunarizine as alternating clonic and tonic seizures. A treatment with anti-epileptic drugs showed that both phenobarbital at doses 6, 7 and 7.5 mg/kg iv and pentobarbital at doses of 15, 20 and 25 mg/kg, iv did not entirely suppress convulsive seizures, although convulsive episodes were rare. Diazepam at doses of 1-1.5 mg/kg, iv suppressed convulsive seizures.", 
    "5": "Cross-dependence on ethanol and pentobarbital was studied in rats reinforced on diazepam, using an intravenous self-administration method. Five rats were allowed to self-administer diazepam 2.0 mg/kg per injection intravenously by pressing a lever on a continuous reinforcement schedule over a 20 day period. The total daily dose of diazepam delivered reached 50 mg/kg/day. Thereafter, ethanol (50 or 100 mg/kg per injection) and then pentobarbital (6 mg/kg per injection) were substituted for diazepam for 3 and 2 days, respectively. During these substitution periods, responding for self-administration, food intake and body weight were recorded. When ethanol was substituted, self-administration responding increased and then decreased. Food intake and body weight also decreased during this period. These changes during the ethanol substitution session resembled those observed during withdrawal sessions. In contrast, when pentobarbital was substituted, no significant changes in self-administration responses, food intake or body weight were seen. These findings suggest that diazepam produces cross-dependence on pentobarbital, but not on ethanol at the doses used in this experiment.", 
    "6": "Moradol (\"Galenika\", Yugoslavia)/butorphanol tartrate (\"Bristol--Mayers C.\", USA)/, a synthetic analgesic representing a new generation of opiate receptors agonists-antagonists, devoid of any narcogenic potential has been used as the only analgesic at all stages of anesthesia during cancer surgery in 26 patients. For premedication moradol was used in a mean dose of 0.032 +/- 0.003 mg.kg-1 in combination with diazepam (0.153 +/- 0.005 mg.kg-1) and atropine (0.01 mg X X kg-1). For induction to anesthesia moradol was used in a dose of 0.72 +/- 0.003 mg.kg-1 and diazepam in a dose of 0.27 +/- 0.015 mg.kg-1. General anesthesia was maintained with moradol, diazepam, nitrous oxide and droperidol. The data presented in the paper demonstrate the advantages of moradol at all stages of intra- and postoperative analgesia, which ensures stable anesthetic background (according to hemodynamic parameters) and reduces considerably an overall postoperative analgesic dose.", 
    "7": "The emergency management of seizures often involves the use of diazepam as a first-line medication. Intravenous access is difficult in pediatric patients who are having seizures, and for this reason alternate routes of administration have been sought. This paper reviews the recent literature concerning the efficacy of rectal administration of intravenous diazepam solution for the purpose of emergency management of seizures in children. Although intravenous diazepam is the preferred route for the child with active seizure activity, undiluted diazepam intravenous solution administered per rectum is an excellent alternative. The technique of administration is reviewed.", 
    "8": "During whole body radiation therapy of children, treatment may be done in places not equipped with acceptable scavenging systems for anesthetic gases and where clinical observation of the patient may be impossible. In order to solve this problem, the authors have used a total intravenous (IV) anesthetic technique using midazolam, pancuronium, and fentanyl. With midazolam as the only hypnotic agent, the problem with scavenging is solved, and a computer simulation of the plasma concentration of midazolam is presented. A modified stethoscope for monitoring during radiation also has been developed. This anesthetic technique and the stethoscope have been used in seven children. The total IV anesthesia proved to be a useful method for children during whole body radiation. The modified stethoscope functioned very well and was a useful complement to the monitoring equipment.", 
    "9": "Sixty-seven patients with panic disorder were treated with single-blind placebo for one week before being randomized to 6 weeks of double-blind treatment with either lorazepam or alprazolam. Both drugs showed significant and comparable antipanic efficacy throughout the course of the study. With the exception of sedative effects, both drugs were well-tolerated at a mean daily dose of 7 mg for lorazepam and 3 mg for alprazolam. Lorazepam appeared to be as effective as alprazolam in the acute treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "10": "Beginning with the eighties, a paradigm-change concerning anxiety disorders has taken place in considerable parts of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are no longer regarded as consequences of conflicts and ineffective defences or as concomitants of other psychiatric disorders but rather as disorders of their own. This resulted in a modified outlook on anxiety disorders focusing on the acute panic attack (Panic disorder) instead of focusing on chronic anxiety (Anxiety neurosis). This paper reviews recent empirical studies concerning classification, pathogenesis, and therapy of anxiety disorders, i.e. after introduction of the concept of Panic disorder. Epidemiological studies could demonstrate that in western countries anxiety disorders account for the most frequent psychiatric disorders with prevalence rates of 2.0% to 4.7%. Panic disorders show prevalence rates of 0.4% to 1.1%. Results of recent follow-up studies indicate a favorable course for outpatients and an unfavorable course for inpatients with anxiety disorders. Family studies reported on positive familial loading for Panic disorder but not for Agoraphobia and Generalized anxiety disorder. A twin study found higher concordance rates for panic attacks and Agoraphobias in monozygotic twins than in dizygotic twins. Pharmacological provocation studies with lactate infusion, CO2-inhalation, and administration of Caffeine, Yohimbine, Isoproterenol showed a higher vulnerability of patients with Panic Disorder as compared to healthy controls. However, all studies display methodological short-comings and could be interpreted differently as to the concept of a biologically determined vulnerability. Provocation studies using inverse Benzodiazepine-agonists dealt only with healthy probands. Whereas life events play a rather unimportant role f\u00fcr the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders, recent studies point to the influence of cognitive processes and personality variables for the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders. Concerning treatment of anxiety disorders and especially of panic disorders, pharmacological studies as well as studies of behavioural therapy indicate very good results for acute treatment and good results for behavioural therapy with respect to one to four year follow-up studies. Recently, combined drug and psychotherapy gains growing interest. Conclusions are drawn with respect to the usefulness of the new classification, i.e. after the introduction of Panic disorder as a diagnostic category, and references are given for further research strategies.", 
    "11": "Restraint-induced stress produced an inhibition of humoral immune responses accompanied by a decrease of rectal temperature and motor activity. Diazepam and levamisole restored the decrease of humoral immune responses. Furthermore, diazepam restored the decrease of rectal temperature. Shosaikoto, an oriental herbal medicinal mixture, restored the stress-induced inhibition of humoral immune responses and rectal temperature.", 
    "12": "This study investigated the effects of pretreatment with muscimol (GABA-agonist) or diazepam (indirect GABAmimetic) on i.v. meperidine, fentanyl, alphaprodine and morphine, using rabbit tooth pulp and mouse hot plate assays. A previous study reported that the ED50 values for fentanyl in rabbits were significantly lowered by 0.25 mg/kg of muscimol (13.8 to 1.8 micrograms/kg) and by 1.5 mg/kg of diazepam (13.1 to 1.1 micrograms/kg). ED50 values for meperidine in rabbits in this study were increased by muscimol (1.2 to 3.2 mg/kg) and diazepam (1.5 to 3.1 mg/kg). ED50 values for fentanyl in mice were significantly lowered by 0.25 mg/kg of muscimol (23.0 to 8.9 micrograms/kg) and 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam (23.3 to 12.8 micrograms/kg). ED50 values for meperidine in mice were significantly increased by muscimol (2.1 to 5.0 mg/kg) and diazepam (2.0 to 4.8 mg/kg). ED50 values for alphaprodine and morphine were significantly lowered by muscimol and diazepam in mice. A higher dose of muscimol (1.0 mg/kg) had no effect on the ED50 values of meperidine in mice. The antinociception of a submaximal dose of meperidine in rabbits was significantly reduced by a 10 min pretreatment with i.v. diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) at 15, 20, 30 and 45 min after i.v. meperidine. The antinociception of a submaximal dose of fentanyl in rabbits was significantly increased by a 10 min pretreatment with i.v. diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min after i.v. fentanyl. Pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg of scopolamine enhanced the antinociceptive effect of a submaximal dose of fentanyl in both animal models. Diazepam reduced the antinociception produced by the combination scopolamine-fentanyl to that of fentanyl-vehicle control in both animal models. Pretreatment with 0.1 mg/kg of scopolamine did not change the magnitude of antinociception of a submaximal dose of meperidine in rabbits. Since meperidine possesses inherent anticholinergic activity, it is suggested that this anticholinergic activity may be involved in the reduction effects by muscimol and diazepam.", 
    "13": "Several N-(2-methyl or 1,2-dimethylindol-3-ylglyoxylyl)amino acid derivatives were synthesized and tested for their affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor in bovine cortical membranes. The 2-methyl derivatives showed a lower affinity than the unmethylated analogues, and the 1,2-dimethyl derivatives practically lacked any affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor. The importance of the indole N-H group is therefore evidenced for an optimal interaction of these ligands with receptor site.", 
    "14": "Ethanol causes behavioral effects in rats and mice similar to those observed in humans. Moreover, by selective breeding, lines of rats or mice have been obtained that prefer ethanol solution to water and vice versa (ethanol-preferring and ethanol-avoiding animals). Recent studies suggest that ethanol stimulates GABA receptor-mediated opening of the chloride channels in neuronal membranes, and that some behavioral responses to ethanol, such as its sedative and anxiolytic effects, are mediated by central GABA receptors. Recently, we have shown that ethanol suppresses the firing of neurons in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, which exert an inhibitory control over dopaminergic neurons. Escaping from inhibitory control, the latter neurons are stimulated by ethanol. Dopaminergic neurons especially sensitive to ethanol are those of the meso-cortico-limbic system, belonging to the \"pleasure centers\" of the brain. In addiction, it has been shown that ethanol stimulates dopamine metabolism in different brain areas, but more effectively so in ethanol-preferring than in ethanol-avoiding rats. Finally, voluntary ethanol intake modifies dopamine metabolism in different brain areas.", 
    "15": "C57BL/6NNia and autoimmune NZB/BlNJ mice aged 12-14 months were tested for acquisition and retention of an active avoidance response following vehicle or flumazenil (40 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist. Acquisition and retention performance was improved in flumazenil-treated mice when compared with vehicle-treated mice, although the degree of improvement varied with the level of performance in vehicle-treated mice of each strain. The NZB/BlNJ mice, which generally performed more poorly than the C57BL/6NNia mice, showed the greater improvements following flumazenil. These results suggest that antagonism of benzodiazepine receptors leads to improved learning and/or memory performance in mice with spontaneous age-associated deficits.", 
    "16": "Two hundred and seventy blood samples selected at random from Norwegian drivers apprehended on the suspicion of drunken or drugged driving were screened for the presence of amphetamine, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cocaine. Of the samples tested, 223 were from drivers suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol only (A-cases). In the rest (n = 47) of the cases, the police also suspected drugs as a possible reason for driving impairment (D-cases). In the A-cases, benzodiazepines were found in 17%, cannabinoids in 26%, THC in 13% and amphetamine in 2% of the blood samples. One or more drugs besides ethanol were found in 38% of the A-samples. In the D-cases, benzodiazepines were found in 53%, cannabinoids in 43%, THC in 43%, amphetamine in 13% and 77% of these samples contained one or more drugs. Cocaine was not detected in any sample. Blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) above the legal limit of 0.05% were found in 80% of the drug positive A-cases and in 28% of the drug positive D-cases. The frequency of drug detection in A-samples was similar (40%) in samples with BAC above and below 0.05%, while this frequency was much higher (above 90%) in D-samples with BAC below 0.05% than in D-samples with BAC above 0.05% (53%). Benzodiazepines were most frequently found among drivers above 25 years of age, while cannabinoids were most frequently found among drivers below 35 years. For about 15-20% of the A-cases with BAC below 0.05%, other drugs were detected at concentrations which may cause driving impairment. It was concluded that analysis of alcohol only might often be insufficient in A-cases to reveal driving impairment.", 
    "17": "Intravenous administration of beta-CCM (methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) at doses ranging from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg dose-dependently inhibited muricide in olfactory bulbectomized rats. beta-CCM elicited a decrease of locomotor activity at doses ranging from 0.3 to 3 mg/kg, and it impaired rotarod performance at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg. The inhibition of muricide induced by beta-CCM was antagonized by intraperitoneal administration of Ro15-1788 at 10 mg/kg or diazepam at 3 mg/kg. However, the hypolocomotor activity and impairment of rotarod performance induced by beta-CCM were not antagonized by diazepam at 3 mg/kg. These results indicated that beta-CCM exerts an inhibitory effect on muricide through benzodiazepine receptors and this inhibitory effect was not solely caused by its sedative or motor incordinating activity at the dose ranges used in this study.", 
    "18": "Two patients with two and three types respectively of ground-glass hepatocyte inclusions are described. Both were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG) positive and received cyanamide for alcohol aversion therapy. In addition, one of them had taken benzodiazepines and barbiturates. In one patient, cyanamide and HBsAg inclusions co-existed in the same hepatocytes.", 
    "19": "1. The Langendorff preparation was used to investigate functional changes in rat heart one week after the last of a course of repeated injections of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, FG7142 (20 mg kg-1 i.p; three times weekly for five weeks). 2. Under these conditions, FG7142 caused a statistically significant reduction in both cardiac basal tension and the inotropic effect of noradrenaline at doses giving 50 and 100% of the maximum response. 3. Basal heart rate, basal coronary perfusion pressure and the effects of noradrenaline ex vivo on these parameters were all unaffected by repeated administration of FG7142. 4. FG7142 had no intrinsic effects on cardiac function when administered in vitro. 5. We discuss mechanisms which could underlie the effects of FG7142 on cardiac tension ex vivo and consider the possibility that this action may be related to the anxiogenic or proconvulsant actions of this drug.", 
    "20": "A single-dose study of the beta-carboline, ZK 95962, on photosensitive generalized paroxysmal activity in the EEG was conducted in 6 patients with primary generalized epilepsy. Four of the patients were newly diagnosed and did not receive any antiepileptic drug or other medication during the study. Two were receiving current therapy with carbamazepine. A double-blind cross-over study with 2 injections of ZK 95962 (20 micrograms/kg body weight repeated 10 min after 1st injection) and 2 placebo injections were carried out in a randomized order, with 4 h intervals between the injections with active drug and placebo. On the day before the trial, the sensitivity range (standardized photosensitivity range, SPR) was determined hourly using flash frequencies of 2, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 30 and 40 Hz for 4 sec in ascending and descending order until generalized spikes or spike waves occurred. A significant reduction in photosensitivity was observed 2-12 min after injection of ZK 95962 in all patients, lasting 2-3 h. No change in the SPR was observed after placebo injections. The feelings of uneasiness and myoclonic jerks, provoked by photostimulation, were also abolished by ZK 95962, but not by placebo injections. Side effects, including sedation were not observed. The results suggest that benzodiazepine receptor ligands such as ZK 95962 may be potent antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "21": "The anticonvulsant action of progabide, an agonist of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A and GABAB receptors, was investigated in the kindling model of epilepsy in rats. Progabide shortened afterdischarge durations and attenuated the severity of the accompanying convulsive responses in previously kindled rats from the amygdala (AM), frontal cortex (FC), ventral and dorsal hippocampus (HIPP), in a dose-dependent manner. Although progabide was less effective in the dorsal HIPP kindled seizures, the efficacy was potent in AM, FC and ventral HIPP kindled seizures. On the other hand, the anticonvulsant action of baclofen, a selective agonist of GABAB receptors, was relatively weak in terms of the measurement of the afterdischarge duration of AM and HIPP kindled seizures even at toxic doses, compared with progabide. In addition, the anticonvulsant effects of progabide were partially reversed by treatment with the antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors, Ro 15-1788, whereas Ro 15-1788 administration alone did not alter AM kindled seizures. We concluded that the action of progabide may be mediated via the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. These results support the hypothesis that a failure of GABAA-mediated inhibition is one of the bases of induction and generalization of seizures.", 
    "22": "The benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition sites on the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride ionophore complex have been suggested to be involved in the modulation of mesoprefrontal dopamine (DA) neurons. We have examined further the effects of different classes of BZ receptor ligands on DA metabolism in the prefrontal cortex. The anxiogenic inverse agonist FG 7142 elevated selectively 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels and DO-PAC/DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The activating effect was not, however, observed in any other mesocortical, mesolimbic or nigrostriatal DA terminal fields examined. Pretreatments with BZ agonists such as diazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam and CGS 9896 and BZ antagonists such as Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216 and barbiturates such as pentobarbital, significantly antagonized the beta-carboline-induced elevation of prefrontal DOPAC levels. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the pharmacological profile of different BZ receptor ligands on prefrontal DA metabolism and their profiles in behavioral, electrophysiological and receptor binding studies. Agonists increased DA levels and consequently decreased DOPAC/DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex. Inverse agonists, on the other hand, significantly elevated prefrontal DOPAC levels and DOPAC/DA ratio in a dose-dependent manner. Antagonists such as Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216, at low doses, did not alter mesoprefrontal DA metabolism, but at higher doses did elevate DOPAC/DA ratio in the prefrontal cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "23": "The amino-gamma-carbolines 3-amino-1-methyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole and 3-amino-1,4-dimethyl-5H-pyrido[4,3-b]indole were demonstrated to be potent convulsants. Administered i.p. in rats, these compounds penetrated the blood-brain barrier rapidly and appeared in the cerebrospinal fluid. When administered i.c.v., they induced convulsions with short onset latencies, suggesting that these compounds themselves have convulsant activities. In in vitro experiments using the whole cell clamp method, they suppressed gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced Cl- current isolated on the dissociated mouse sensory neurons in dose-dependent manners through their actions as antagonists at GABAA receptors. The relative potency of the suppressive effects on GABA-induced Cl- current was compatible with that of the convulsant activities in mice. Furthermore, Ro15-1788 did not affect their convulsant activities. These results suggested that the amino-gamma-carbolines induced convulsions through their actions as antagonists at GABAA receptors and not through their actions as inverse agonists or antagonists at benzodiazepine receptors. Structure-activity relationships indicated that the 3-amino-group is important for the activities of amino-gamma-carbolines as GABAA receptor antagonists.", 
    "24": "Behavioral and electrophysiological evidence implicating the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy was obtained using an improved rat model of hepatic encephalopathy caused by thioacetamide-induced fulminant hepatic failure. After the administration of thioacetamide together with supportive therapy, acute hepatocellular failure developed in rats as a result of massive hepatocellular necrosis without evidence of renal failure or hypoglycemia. The evolution of hepatic encephalopathy in this model was sufficiently slow to readily permit the staging of the syndrome. Prominent features of the encephalopathy include a marked reduction in open field activity and an abnormal visual evoked response. Both the deficits in spontaneous motor function and visual evoked response abnormalities of rats in stages III to IV hepatic encephalopathy were significantly improved after the administration of the benzodiazepine receptor ligands flumazenil or Ro 15-4513. Doses of flumazenil or Ro 15-4513 that produced these effects in rats with hepatic encephalopathy had no detectable action on either the behavior or the visual evoked responses of normal rats. The ability of benzodiazepine receptor ligands to ameliorate both the behavioral depression and the visual evoked response abnormalities associated with hepatic encephalopathy in the thioacetamide-induced rat model suggest an involvement of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. In addition, the similarity of these observations to those in rabbits with hepatic encephalopathy caused by galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure is compatible with the hypothesis that the mechanisms of hepatic encephalopathy in these two distinct models share a common final pathway, the allosteric enhancement of GABAergic tone through the benzodiazepine receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "The major type of receptor for the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), called the GABAA receptor, is a member of a gene superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. This receptor is a hetero-oligomeric protein composed of several distinct polypeptide types (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). Molecular cloning of these polypeptides reveals that they show 20-40% identity with each other, and 10-20% identity with polypeptides of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and strychnine-sensitive glycine receptor. Each polypeptide type is also represented by a family of genes whose members have 60-80% amino acid sequence identity. Regions of conserved and variable amino acid sequence suggest structural and functional domains within each polypeptide. All of the polypeptides when expressed in heterologous cells produce GABA-activated chloride channels, and the different subtypes express different pharmacological properties. The distributions of mRNAs for the different GABAA receptor polypeptides and their subtypes show significant brain regional variation consistent with pharmacological and biochemical evidence for receptor heterogeneity. Subpopulations of GABAA receptors with different cellular and regional locations show differential sensitivity to GABA, to modulators like steroids, to physiological regulation, to disease processes, and to pharmacological manipulation by drugs such as benzodiazepines. The properties of the different subpopulations of GABAA receptors are determined by which one or more of the different polypeptides and their subtypes are expressed in a given cell to produce a variety of different oligomeric protein structures. Molecular cloning techniques have produced rapid advances in understanding the GABAA receptor protein family.", 
    "26": "We have solubilized, affinity-purified, and functionally reconstituted the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine (GABA/BDZ) receptor from rat brain into natural brain lipid liposomes. The detergent, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio] 1-propanesulphonate, was employed for the isolation of the receptor in the presence of a whole rat brain lipid extract supplemented with cholesteryl hemisuccinate. The soluble and reconstituted protein showed a homogeneous [3H]flunitrazepam binding population and the allosteric modulation of this binding site by GABA, by the pyrazolopyridine, cartazolate, and by the depressant barbiturate, pentobarbital. The purified GABA/BDZ receptor when incorporated into liposomes has been visualized by electron microscopy and reveals rosette structures, 8-9 nm in diameter, which appear to have a central pore. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the reconstituted GABA/BDZ receptor reveals three major protein bands of 41, 52-56, and 59-62 kDa, the latter two of which appears as doublets. Functional receptor reconstitution is demonstrated by the measurement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux into the purified GABA/BDZ receptor incorporated liposomes and its modulation by the BDZs, barbiturates, and pyrazolopyridines.", 
    "27": "The influence of diazepam (1 and 5 mg/kg, i. p.) and buspirone (5 and 10 mg/kg) on the Fourier's spectral EEG power of sensomotor cortex and a conflict behavior in freely moving rats were studied. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) and buspirone (5 mg/kg) produced slowing of EEG theta-activity. Large doses of diazepam and buspirone produced different and multiple EEG effects. To 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) completely antagonized all the effects of diazepam (5 mg/kg). The authors discuss possible mutual relations between the influence on EEG and anxiolytic effect of these tranquilizers.", 
    "28": "The effects of cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine on the GHRH-induced GH release were studied in 10 adolescent females with anorexia nervosa at different stages of the disease, in 5 adolescent females with eating disorders and in 5 normal adolescents. The patients were characterized according to psychological (DSM III-R), endocrinological (GnRH test), nutritional (Somatomedin-C, T3), and clinical (% IBW, duration of the amenorrhoea) criteria. On two separate occasions, each subject received an i.v. bolus injection of GHRH 1-40 (1 microgram/kg) alone or preceded by pirenzepine (0.6 mg/kg i.v. 5 min before GHRH 1-40). GHRH 1-40 injection induced a significantly (P less than 0.05) higher GH increase in the patients with anorexia nervosa at the acute stage as compared with the controls. Pirenzepine did not abolish opportunely the exaggerated GH response to GHRH 1-40 in anorectic patients at the acute stage unlike the control, who showed the blockade of GHRH-induced GH release by the cholinergic muscarinic antagonist (P less than 0.05). The anorectic adolescents at the non acute stage and the adolescents with eating disorders showed varying reductions of GH response; however, pirenzepine produced a blunted suppression of GHRH-induced GH increase as compared to the controls, which was not statistically significant. Somatomedin-C values were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in anorectic patients at the acute stage as compared with controls. The abnormal activity of cholinergic system in anorectic patients, as our data show, could induce the GH hypersecretion through an inhibitory influence on the somatostatinergic function. The reduced somatomedin-C levels, a specific malnutrition index in anorectic patients, produce a modified feed-back on the hypothalamic site (somatostatin) and/or directly on the pituitary, following the GH hypersecretion.", 
    "29": "Zolpidem is a recently introduced sleep-inducer which is thought to act on the central-type benzodiazepine receptors. This observation is the first report of drug poisoning with this compound. The toxic response was characterized by the development of a profound but short-lasting coma, associated with pin-point pupils and respiratory depression, as observed in a narcotic overdose. These clinical signs were not influenced by the administration of naloxone, but responded dramatically to flumazenil. Some analytical data on zolpidem toxicokinetics are presented.", 
    "30": "Alprazolam (48 mg/kg/day) administered orally to dogs 4 times a day in equally divided doses produced physical dependence. This dependence was revealed by a precipitated abstinence syndrome which occurred after either oral administration of flumazenil (6, 18 and 36 mg/kg) or intravenous administration of a liposomal suspension of flumazenil. Flumazenil alone (18, 36 and 72 mg/kg) produced no significant signs of precipitated abstinence in naive dogs. This precipitated abstinence syndrome in alprazolam-dependent dogs was characterized by both clonic and tonic-clonic seizures. Other signs of precipitated abstinence which comprise the NPAS score were less intense in the alprazolam-dependent than in diazepam-dependent dogs. Alprazolam is extensively metabolized in the dog and does not accumulate whereas its predominant metabolite, alpha hydroxyalprazolam, does accumulate. The data suggest that alpha hydroxyalprazolam plays a role in the dependence-producing properties of alprazolam in the dog as revealed by the precipitated abstinence syndrome.", 
    "31": "Early postoperative recovery was studied using sedation scoring, measurement of flicker fusion frequency and completion of Trieger test figures in 60 male patients who presented for vasectomy under general anaesthesia as day patients. Anaesthesia was induced in groups 1 and 2 (20 patients each) with mean (SD) doses of 0.16 (0.04) mg/kg or 0.16 (0.03) mg/kg midazolam respectively; group 2 received flumazenil 0.55 (0.19) mg after completion of surgery. The remaining 20 patients (group 3) received propofol 1.50 (0.24) mg/kg. Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane vaporized in 33% oxygen and nitrous oxide in all patients. Flumazenil tended to improve tests of recovery after midazolam anaesthesia, but early recovery after propofol anaesthesia was associated with better psychomotor test results and less impairment of mental state as judged by sedation and amnesia scoring.", 
    "32": "The depressant effects of midazolam and xylazine on the central nervous system (CNS) were evaluated in 12 dogs. Xylazine was administered to six dogs (1.1 mg/kg intravenously [IV]) followed in 5 minutes by midazolam (1.0 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM]). In a second group of six dogs, xylazine (2.2 mg/kg IM) was followed in 5 minutes by midazolam (1.0 mg/kg IV). Both drug regimens induced rapid and profound sedation or anesthesia. Duration of action varied with the doses and routes of administration. Dogs given the high dose of xylazine IM had an arousal time of 95.4 +/- 8.9 minutes and a walking time of 155.4 +/- 8.8 minutes. These values exceeded the IV xylazine values threefold. Partial reversal of CNS depression was accomplished with either a benzodiazepine antagonist (flumazenil) or an alpha-2 antagonist (yohimbine). In a separate trial, a mixture of xylazine (0.55 mg/kg), midazolam (1.0 mg/kg), and butorphanol (0.1 mg/kg) with and without glycopyrrolate was evaluated in eight dogs. As with the xylazine-midazolam combinations, the CNS depressant effect of this mixture was clinically indistinguishable from anesthesia achieved with other rapid-acting injectable agents. Clinical signs of CNS depression were readily and completely antagonized by the simultaneous injection of flumazenil and yohimbine.", 
    "33": "Glucuronidation of codeine was detected and compared with that of morphine in microsomes from human livers and kidneys. Vmax values for codeine-6-glucuronide (C6G) were 0.54 +/- 0.24 and 0.74 +/- 0.35 nmol/mg/min. in the livers and 0.10 and 0.13 nmol/mg/min. in the kidney, respectively, when codeine and UDP-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) were incubated with microsomal preparation. The corresponding Km values were 2.21 +/- 0.68 and 1.41 +/- 0.36 mM in the livers and 6.69 and 4.12 mM in the kidney. The average codeine glucuronyltransferase (GT) activity was 14-fold lower in the six kidneys than in the 11 livers. Higher GT activities were observed in liver microsomes from patients who had been exposed to enzyme inducers. Rates of glucuronide formation from morphine correlated significantly with those from codeine in both human liver and kidney microsomes. Morphine, amitriptyline, diazepam, probenecid and chloramphenicol inhibited codeine glucuronidation with Ki values of 3.6, 0.13, 0.18, 1.7 and 0.27 mM, respectively.", 
    "34": "During the past 10 years, better results in the treatment of epilepsy have been obtained through the application of pharmacokinetic data to drug therapy of epilepsy. However, pediatric drug therapy is complicated by the continuous change in body weight and body composition with the growth and development, especially during infancy. Younger children require a higher dose per kilogram of body weight than older children in order to achieve comparable plasma concentrations. Plasma levels and seizure control were investigated in a prospective randomized study when phenytoin, carbamazepine (CBZ) or sodium valproate (VPA) was given as a single drug to pediatric patients with several types of epileptic seizures. Studies on newly referred, previously untreated children suggest that both partial and generalized tonic-clonic seizures can be prevented by each of the three drugs. No significant differences in clinical efficacy were found among the three drugs, when optimum plasma concentration ranges were maintained with blood level monitoring. Clonazepam (CZP) may be effective in partial seizures. However, as a wide range of plasma levels was associated with complete freedom from seizures, it was not possible to define a therapeutic range for CZP. Any patient who receives multiple-drug therapy is at risk to develop a drug-drug interaction. Simultaneous administration of VPA was associated with a raised plasma level of carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E), a major metabolite of CBZ, relative to the CBZ dose, whereas the plasma CBZ level remained unaltered. High plasma concentration of CBZ-E may be responsible for side effects in some patients. Drug-protein binding interactions are another source of side effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "35": "The use of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was studied in two patients with coma of unknown etiology. One patient ingested 20.5 mg alprazolam before crashing his truck into parked automobiles. The patient was awakened by flumazenil administration, and the severity of his injuries was evaluated reliably. A second patient ingested 7.5 mg triazolam and attempted suicide with carbon monoxide from car exhaust. His coma resolved completely after the administration of the double-blind study drug, obviating treatment with hyperbaric oxygen. Flumazenil had a clear diagnostic and therapeutic role in the treatment of these patients and should be a useful tool for emergency physicians and toxicologists.", 
    "36": "The presence of hypothalamic disturbances affecting GH secretion in anorexia nervosa has been suggested, although a normal GH response to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) administration has been shown in these patients. The present study was performed to investigate the role of acetylcholine in regulating GH secretion by using pirenzepine, which selectively blocks muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Paired tests were performed in nine anorexia nervosa patients (age +/- SEM, 19.1 +/- 1.2 yr; percent ideal body weight, -32.7 +/- 2.2%) and in six normal controls (20.1 +/- 0.3 yr; -3.1 +/- 1.8%). GHRH-(1-44) (1 microgram/kg) was infused iv with and without pirenzepine pretreatment (0.6 mg/kg, iv). Basal levels of GH were not different in anorexia nervosa compared to normal controls, whereas, somatomedin-C levels were significantly lower in anorexia nervosa patients. However, after pirenzepine administration, the GHRH-stimulated GH responses were completely blocked in normal controls, but not in anorexia nervosa patients. These results suggested that altered muscarinic cholinergic mechanism are involved in the modulation of GH secretion in patients with anorexia nervosa.", 
    "37": "In this double-blind study 31 outpatients undergoing third molar extraction were randomly assigned to one of two groups. All patients were sedated with intravenous midazolam (IV) by titration method. The flumazenil group (n = 20) received an average of 0.8 +/- 0.17 mg of flumazenil IV. The placebo patients (n = 11) each received 10 mL of normal saline. By both observer and patient alertness ratings, patients receiving flumazenil appeared significantly more alert than placebo patients at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes following reversal. After reversal the flumazenil group had significantly higher scores than the placebo group at all intervals through 60 minutes. All the patients receiving flumazenil were able to walk without assistance at 5 minutes, compared with only one patient in the placebo group, and more patients in the flumazenil group recognized the picture card shown to them at 5, 15, 30, and 60 minutes postreversal. Flumazenil is effective in terminating the amnestic properties of midazolam, but this appears to occur to a lesser extent than the reversal of its sedative properties.", 
    "38": "Generalized tonic-clonic seizures are a neurologic emergency. Duration of ictal activity has been associated with neurologic sequelae. The purpose of this study was to determine if midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, could effectively ablate ictal activity in an animal model without significant cardiorespiratory compromise. Ten domestic swine (10 to 20 kg) were ventilated and hemodynamically monitored. Bifrontal craniotomies were performed and electrocortical activity was recorded throughout the experiment. Pentylenetetrazol (100 mg/kg) was administered iv to induce seizures. Midazolam (0.1 mg/kg) was administered iv and serum levels were drawn at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 min after administration. There was no significant difference between the baseline and postmidazolam vital signs. Seizure activity was seen periodically as generalized spikes, as well as individual spikes for 29 +/- 5 sec after midazolam administration. A period of attenuation of 24 +/- 7 sec was seen before returning to baseline electrocortical activity. Our study demonstrates that midazolam effectively ablated induced ictal activity without significant cardiorespiratory depression and with similar EEG effect as other benzodiazepines.", 
    "39": "One hundred chronic pain patients were begun on alprazolam, 1.5 mg/day. No other medication changes or therapeutic interventions were made. Sixteen patients were lost to follow-up and 1 oncology patient died. Of the 83 patients who were evaluated at 12 weeks, 61 (73.5%) showed improvement, and only 5 had discontinued the medication because of side effects. The average score of all patients had decreased from 3.6 to 2.2 on a verbal analog scale that rated pain severity from 0 to 5. There was no difference in response among the various diagnostic groups represented in the study population.", 
    "40": "During chronic use of seduxen various changes of correlation connections between different parameters of general behaviour are revealed in dogs. The character and degree of expressiveness of these changes depend on the drug dose and typological characteristics of animals. The most general and significant manifestation of favourable effect of the drug action on animals behaviour is an increase of the number of \"strong\" correlation connections (correlation coefficient is more than 0.7) of the parameters of various components of conditioned activity, reflecting the state of inner inhibition processes, and to the parameters of vegetative provision of conditioned reactions. The character of reconstructions of correlation connections between different conditioned, vegetative, neurotransmitter and general behaviour parameters allows to judge of the direction of pharmacological influence on separate functional systems and the behaviour as a whole.", 
    "41": "The authors review recent studies on benzodiazepine, the most largely used drug for insomnia and anxiety. In this paper are summarized: the development, patterns of use and abuse, mechanism of action, development of differential tolerance to its many effects, and the phenomena of withdrawal and dependence on the benzodiazepines.", 
    "42": "EEGs were recorded for Fp1, C3 and O1 once a week for 4 weeks after the withdrawal of medazepam, a benzodiazepine with a long half-life, from 7 normal males. Quantified analyses of them showed 2 types of change: A maximum change during the administration of medazepam that later tapered off. It consisted mainly of an increase in fast wave, and was uniform across areas though most significant in C3. A rebound phenomenon that reversed the change produced by the drug, the decrease in fast wave being significant in C3 during week 2. These results suggest that fast wave is the most sensitive EEG element and these 2 types of change must be investigated hereafter in terms of significant changes after the discontinuation of medazepam.", 
    "43": "The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of buspirone and its major metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP), were investigated in rabbits with chronic electrode implants, and the effects were compared with those of diazepam. Intravenous administration of buspirone at 0.1 to 1.0 mg/kg evoked an increase in the arousal EEG pattern period (low amplitude fast waves) in the cortical EEG and synchronization of the hippocampal theta waves with decreased voltages, whereas both 1-PP (0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg, i.v.) and diazepam (1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg) evoked an increase in the drowsy EEG pattern periods: high voltage slow waves and spindle bursts in the cortical EEG and desynchronization of the hippocampal theta waves. Buspirone at higher doses caused behavioral excitation in rabbits, whereas both 1-PP and diazepam produced sedation. Buspirone did not affect EEG arousal responses to both auditory stimulation (2,000 Hz, monotone) and electrical stimulation (100 Hz, 0.1 msec, 3-6 V) of the midbrain reticular formation or the posterior hypothalamus. However, 1-PP tended to inhibit the EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation but not brain stimulation, and diazepam markedly suppressed the responses induced by both stimulations. The recruiting response induced by centromedian thalamic stimulation at a low frequency (7 Hz, 0.1 msec, 4-8 V) was not affected by buspirone, 1-PP and diazepam. Neither buspirone nor 1-PP had an effect on the photic driving response to a flash light (2 Hz) in the occipital cortex of the rabbit, whereas the response was suppressed by diazepam. Both buspirone and 1-PP enhanced the duration of after discharges induced by electrical stimulation (50 Hz, 0.5 msec, 4-15 V) of the dorsal hippocampus, whereas diazepam markedly inhibited the afterdischarges. These results suggest that the EEG effect of buspirone is quite different to those of 1-PP and diazepam in qualitative aspects. It is also suggested that buspirone, unlike diazepam, is an effective anxiolytic drug without a sedative effect.", 
    "44": "Thirty-one patients dependent on benzodiazepines were randomly assigned to either slow withdrawal (SW) or abrupt withdrawal under propranolol cover (PW). Of 16 patients in the SW group, 11 successfully withdrew from their drugs, while only 4 out of 15 in the PW group did so. Patients in the SW group had only mild withdrawal symptoms, while those in the PW group suffered more severe symptoms, which lasted around four weeks. In all, 81% of the whole group suffered withdrawal symptoms of some kind. Patients in both groups were significantly less anxious at the end of the study than at baseline. Younger subjects and those who were more severely anxious at the start of the trial had more difficulty in withdrawing than older and less anxious patients.", 
    "45": "Flurazepam (F) is an extensively prescribed hypnotic (Dalmane) whose in vivo activity has been suggested to be due to its primary metabolites, hydroxyethyl flurazepam (HEF) and N-desalkylflurazepam (DAF). In order to determine the intrinsic pharmacologic activity of F, mice were administered various doses of the cytochrome P-450 suicide inactivator, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT), 1 hr before the ip administration of 1 mg/kg 14C-F. One hr after 14C-F, 70 mg/kg pentylenetetrazole was administered iv and the mice were observed for convulsions. F alone offered no protection from convulsion (mean brain concentrations were 3.9, 32, and 11 ng/g for F, DAF, and HEF, respectively). F with 25 mg/kg ABT also offered no protection despite a 6-fold increase in brain concentrations of F. F with 100 mg/kg ABT offered a 57% protection from convulsions (mean brain concentrations were 99, 62, and 41 ng/g for F, DAF, and HEF, respectively). One mg/kg F with 400 mg/kg ABT offered 100% protection from convulsions (brain concentrations were 190, 47, and 18 ng/g for F, DAF, and HEF, respectively). These data indicate that F has intrinsic pharmacologic activity which must be considered when evaluating the pharmacodynamics of F.", 
    "46": "Fourteen inpatients with long-term benzodiazepine (BDZ)-dependency were gradually withdrawn from their medication. During a four-day study period patients received 5 mg diazepam t.d.s. Under double-blind conditions the 5 mg diazepam was replaced twice, by either 0.5 mg or 0.37 mg alprazolam. When the hypothetically realistic alprazolam to diazepam equivalent ratio of 1:10 with regard to hypnosedative and anxiolytic properties was used, alprazolam was clearly preferred to diazepam in three sensitive tests. When alprazolam and diazepam were tested using the altered equivalent ratio of 1:14, \"liking\" and \"seeking potentials\" revealed no significant differences. However, also under these test conditions alprazolam tended to be preferred in a drug choice test. It is concluded that alprazolam appears to implicate somewhat higher reinforcing properties, possibly leading to a higher abuse liability in BDZ-dependent patients as compared to diazepam.", 
    "47": "The aim of the present study was to define the behavioral correlates of chronic exposure of adult rats to flumazenil (4 mg/kg/day X 21 days in drinking water). In the holeboard test, performed on day 13 of drug treatment, the animals showed a significantly greater interest for the holes under which objects were placed than for the holes without objects (p less than 0.03), while there was no such difference in the control group. In the plus-maze test, the flumazenil-treated animals spent significantly more time on open arms and left less fecal boluses than the controls when tested in the third week of treatment and 24 hours after flumazenil withdrawal. In the drinking-punishment test, conducted on days 3, 6 and 10 after drug withdrawal, the drug-exposed animals, following shock experience, did not significantly alter their unpunished drinking in subsequent trials, while the control rats significantly reduced (p less than 0.003) their unpunished drinking. Also, the punished drinking revealed a significant \"anticonflict\" effect of prior exposure to flumazenil (p less than 0.006) which was still observed 6 days after drug withdrawal. There were no group differences in the home-cage food and water consumption during flumazenil treatment; also, the drug treatment had no effect on nociceptive threshold. In summary, chronic treatment with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, increased exploratory activity and had a lasting anxiolytic effect.", 
    "48": "In a prospective randomized study involving 32 male subjects aged 18 to 38, the effects of flunitrazepam (0.25 to 2 mg/70 kg), lormetazepam (0.5 to 4 mg/70 kg), midazolam (1.5 to 12 mg/70 kg) and diazepam (4 to 32 mg/70 kg) on the beta-activity (13 to 20/s) were investigated. Each subject received four benzodiazepine injections of increasing dosage. The doses were selected so that the lowest had only a slight effect on the test person's condition, while the highest resulted in deep sedation. The increase in beta-activity started off with a latency of 30 to 60 s; it was proportional to the dosage and reached its maximum between the 2. and 3. minutes. The subsequent decrease in beta-activity could be represented by an exponential function. The effect could be cancelled temporarily by administering repeated doses of the specific antagonist, flumazenil (0.1, 0.3 and 0.9 mg/70 kg). The method is suited for describing pharmacodynamic processes, determining equipotential doses of benzodiazepines and detecting the interaction between benzodiazepines and specific antagonists.", 
    "49": "Despite increasing awareness of the problems associated with long term psychotropic use, consumption by the elderly remains high. This study examines some of the reasons for this with a view to prevention. Fifty seven elderly patients using psychotropic medication were interviewed to determine the prevalence of psychiatric illness, patterns of drug use, the reasons for the initial prescription and any relationship to life events. Attitudes to continued use were also assessed. The results suggest that levels of psychotropic use by the elderly could be reduced by improved management of life crises and insomnia.", 
    "50": "Dynorphin 1-17 has been suggested to be the endogenous ligand for kappa opioid receptors. In this study motor effects of dynorphin 1-17, its N-terminal fragments d-Pen2,d-Pen5-enkephalin (DPDPE) and d-Ser2-[Leu5]enkephalin-Thr (DSLET) without or with pretreatment with naloxone, (-)-2-(furylmethyl)-noretacocine (Mr 2266) or tetrodotoxin (TTX) on the isolated rat colon were compared with those of nonpeptide kappa opioid receptor agonists. Intraluminal pressure changes were measured by perfusion manometry in preparations maintained in a standard organ bath. Dynorphin 1-17, 1-9, 1-8, 1-6, [Leu5]enkephalin, DPDPE and DSLET dose dependently stimulated the tone in the proximal, middle and distal colon with the maximum response at 10(-6) to 10(-5) M. The stimulation produced by Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe and Tyr-Gly-Gly was 60 and 600 times less potent, respectively.

Only doses exceeding 10(-6) M of the latter three substances stimulated colonic tone. This action was inhibited neither by naloxone nor by Mr 2266. In contrast, the stimulation by dynorphin 1-17 and 1-6 was inhibited to a greater extent by naloxone than by Mr 2266.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "51": "The analogues 2, 3, 8a-c, 9, 13, and 14 of the beta-carboline 6-(benzyloxy)-4-(methoxymethyl)-beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (ZK-93423, 1) were synthesized in order to determine which functional groups are required for agonist activity exhibited by the parent compound 1 at the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR). The potencies of these compounds were evaluated in vitro and in vivo; the beta-carbolines 2, 8a-c, and 13 were found to exhibit high affinity (0.5-22 nM) for BzR, but in vivo studies demonstrated they were not anticonvulsant while analogues 8a and 8b antagonized the effects of diazepam. These results are in agreement with the model proposed for the pharmacophore of the agonist site (domain) of the BzR, which requires the interaction of two sites of electron density [N(2) and C(4)], a third at E+ (electrostatic or steric), and two of lipophilicity [C(3) and C(6)] of the ligand with the BzR protein (see Figure 1). The pharmacophore for the agonist site is derived from the structure-activity relationships of the benzodiazepines, pyrazoloquinolines, and the beta-carboline 1, and compared to interactions required for ligand inverse agonist activity.", 
    "52": "Toxicological analyses on a putrefied cadaver are sometimes difficult to perform because of the absence of blood and urine. In this study, fly larvae, being living material, are proposed as a new medium of investigation in forensic toxicology. Bromazepam and levomepromazine were identified and assayed in the remains of cerebral tissue, in the clavicle of a putrefied cadaver, and in the fly larvae found on and in the corpse.", 
    "53": "1. Intracellular recordings were made from neurones in the nucleus accumbens in slices from the rat brain maintained in vitro. 2. Muscarine (1-100 microM) depolarized 101 of 107 neurones; this was associated with an increase in the input resistance. The potential change reversed polarity with conditioning hyperpolarization and the reversal potential was linearly related to the logarithm of the extracellular potassium concentration. 3. The depolarization caused by muscarine was not changed by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) or by a solution that contained lower levels of calcium (0.24 instead of 2.4 mM), higher levels of magnesium (5 instead of 1.2 mM) and cobalt (2 mM). 4. Muscarine caused an inward current and a decrease in slope conductance when applied to neurones voltage clamped near their resting potential (-82 mV). The current caused by muscarine reversed polarity at the potassium equilibrium potential. The current-voltage relation of the neurones between -60 and -120 mV was well fitted by assuming a voltage-independent potassium conductance and an inward rectifier potassium conductance; muscarine reduced predominantly the inward rectifier conductance. 5. Phorbol-12,13-diacetate (3 microM) and 5-hydroxytryptamine mimicked the action of muscarine. The inward currents caused by muscarine or 5-hydroxytryptamine were occluded by the inward current evoked by the phorbol ester. 6. The depolarization caused by muscarine was competitively antagonized by pirenzepine; the dissociation constant of 11 nM suggested involvement of the M1 receptor. 7. It is concluded that muscarine acts at M1 receptors to reduce the membrane potassium conductance and that activation of protein kinase C may be an intermediate step.", 
    "54": "Discontinuation of chronic treatment with alprazolam may cause a characteristic clinical syndrome. To assess the basis of this syndrome, mice were treated with alprazolam, 2 mg/kg, for 7 days, a regimen associated with the development of tolerance and downregulation of receptors. Effects on motor activity and the binding and function of GABA receptors were evaluated 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after discontinuation. Motor activity was similar to controls 1 day after cessation of alprazolam, increased from days 2 to 4 after-alprazolam, and returned to control values by 7 days. The binding of benzodiazepines in vivo and in vitro was increased in the cortex 2 and 4 days after alprazolam and in the hypothalamus at 4 days after alprazolam. Binding returned to control values in all areas by 7 days. Binding at the chloride channel, using [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, was not significantly altered after discontinuation. Muscimol-stimulated uptake of [36Cl-] in cortical synaptoneurosomes was increased at 4 days after alprazolam, compared to days 1, 2 and 7. Thus, behavioral and neurochemical alterations was associated with the discontinuation of alprazolam. These alterations were qualitatively similar to those observed following discontinuation of lorazepam but occurred more rapidly and with differing regional specificity.", 
    "55": "We examined the inhibitory effect of L-364,718, a nonpeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, on CCK stimulation of pancreatic exocrine and endocrine secretion in both the isolated pancreatic acini and the isolated perfused pancreata of rats. In the isolated acini, L-364,718 inhibited CCK octapeptide (CCK-8)-stimulated amylase release and binding of 125I-CCK-8 in a dose-dependent manner without appreciable effects on the basal amylase secretion. L-364,718 also inhibited amylase release in response to caerulein and gastrin I, but had no effect on amylase release stimulated by other secretagogues or by agents bypassing receptors. Similarly, binding of N-methylscopolamine to pancreatic acini was not inhibited by L-364,718. In the isolated perfused pancreata, L-364,718 inhibited CCK-8-stimulated pancreatic exocrine secretion and insulin release. The inhibitory effects of L-364,718 were more potent for insulin release than for exocrine secretion and persisted even after the removal of L-364,718 infusion. These results clearly demonstrate that L-364,718 is a specific, potent, and prolonged antagonist of CCK's stimulatory actions on pancreatic acinar and B cells.", 
    "56": "We previously reported that zonisamide inhibits both [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding in rat brain. In the present study, [3H]zonisamide was found to bind in a saturable fashion to the crude synaptosomal fraction of whole rat brain. Linear regression analysis of the binding data in the Scatchard plot indicated a Kd of 90 nM, and a maximal binding capacity of 1.40 x 10(3) fmol/mg protein. Displacement studies revealed an inhibitory effect of clonazepam and an enhancement effect of GABA on specific [3H]zonisamide binding. These results suggest that specific [3H]zonisamide binding sites may have a tight correlationship with benzodiazepine receptors in rat brain.", 
    "57": "The effects of zonisamide on [3H]flunitrazepam binding and [3H]muscimol binding were studied in Sprague-Dawley rat brain. Specific [3H]flunitrazepam bound was decreased to 64.6 +/- 5.6% (mean +/- SD, n = 5, p < 0.002) and 91.9 +/- 4.0% (p < 0.005) by the addition of 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M zonisamide, respectively. Scatchard plot analysis of [3H]flunitrazepam binding with 10(-3) M of zonisamide revealed an increased Kd value with no change in Bmax. No inhibitory effect of zonisamide was seen on the enhancement of specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA. As for the effects on GABA receptors, specific [3H]muscimol bound was decreased to 27.7 +/- 10.4% (mean +/- SD, n = 4, p < 0.005) and 68.3 +/- 3.7% (mean +/- SD, n = 4, p < 0.005) by the addition of 10(-3) M and 10(-4) M zonisamide, respectively. Since therapeutic serum level of zonisamide are around 10(-4) M, these results suggest that zonisamide neuropharmacologically interacts with the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex in a manner similar to phenytoin.", 
    "58": "The release of endogenous aspartic acid elicited by depolarization of rat hippocampus synaptosomes with 15 mM KCl was totally calcium-dependent. Acetylcholine (ACh) added to the superfusion medium inhibited the K(+)-evoked release of aspartate in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of ACh was mimicked by oxotremorine and carbachol. It was insensitive to the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine but blocked by the non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. Further pharmacological characterization of the muscarinic receptor involved showed that the ACh effects was insensitive to the M1 selective muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine. However, the inhibition by ACh of aspartate release was counteracted by 11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido-[2-3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), a selective M2 'cardiac' receptor antagonist. The calcium dependence of the release of aspartate and its regulation through presynaptic receptors are suggestive of a transmitter role for this excitatory amino acid. Moreover, the similarities between the present results and those previously obtained with glutamate are compatible with the idea that aspartate and glutamate are co-released in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "59": "The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZR 93,426, a beta-carboline, on local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) was examined by using quantitative in-vivo autoradiography with [3H]2-deoxyglucose. ZK 93,426 was found to increase local cerebral glucose utilization primarily in prefrontal, cingulate, olfactory and visual cortical regions, as well as the claustrum, nucleus accumbens, anteroventral thalamus, substantia nigra, and dorsal raphe nucleus. This pattern of changes of LCGU produced by ZK 93,426 seems to represent neither a mirror image of the metabolic effects of benzodiazepine receptor agonists nor the pattern of effects on LCGU induced by the partial inverse agonist beta-carboline FG 7142. The unique pattern of regional changes of glucose utilization induced by ZK 93,426 are discussed with respect to recent findings on its promnestic and antiamnestic properties in animals and humans. It is concluded that ZK 93,426 does not seem to fit into the conventional classification scheme of benzodiazepine receptor ligands; thus, the term 'selective inverse agonist' is proposed.", 
    "60": "The distribution of cholinergic pre- and postsynaptic markers and dopaminergic presynaptic markers was analyzed in the adult human striatum, using quantitative receptor autoradiography. The distribution of the different binding sites indicates that cholinergic and dopaminergic uptake sites display a striosomal organization, with a higher binding site density in the striatal matrix. M1 muscarinic cholinergic receptor distribution parallels the distribution of cholinergic presynaptic markers. Our data show that cholinergic and dopaminergic terminals, and M1 receptors are enriched in the matrix of the adult human striatum.", 
    "61": "Subcellular fractionation of rat liver by differential centrifugation showed the mitochondrial fractions to have the greatest enrichment of 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine acceptor. Two peaks of acceptor sites were found on isopycnic density-gradient centrifugation, one peak (rho = 1.19 g/ml) corresponding to the peak of mitochondria as judged by marker enzyme distribution and by transmission electron microscopy, and the other peak (rho = 1.17 g/ml) which is not mitochondrial as judged by the lack of mitochondrial enzyme markers. Whereas the density of the mitochondrial acceptor was sensitive to sonication and was shown to have an outer-membrane location, the density of the non-mitochondrial acceptor was insensitive to sonication. The non-mitochondrial acceptor was shown not to be associated with Golgi, lysosomes, rough endoplasmic reticular microsomes, peroxisomes, or some types of plasma membranes, as judged by differences in the distribution of marker activities. No enrichment of benzodiazepine acceptor was found in the purified nuclear fraction. Both acceptors were shown to be peripheral-type high-affinity acceptors as judged by ligand specificities and by photoaffinity labelling.",

    "63": "Primiparous pregnant Sprague-Dawley dams were administered a single daily s.c. injection of diazepam (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) or vehicle over gestation days 14-20. No differences in neonatal mortality and weight gain were found between the control and diazepam-exposed pups. Conversely, male pups prenatally treated with this benzodiazepine exhibited subtle behavioural alterations either during early postnatal life or during adulthood. In particular, a significant decrease in the locomotor activity of the diazepam-treated groups was found at the end of the second postnatal week (14-16 days). Furthermore, the administration of diazepam during gestation produced marked changes in the length of ultrasonic calls of rat pups removed from their nest. Finally, adult male rats (120 days of age) prenatally exposed to diazepam showed a notable impairment in copulatory activity as well as a significant decrease in the duration of ultrasonic (22 kHz) post-ejaculatory calls emitted during sexual behaviour. These findings suggest that late gestational exposure to diazepam induces both short- and long-term behavioural changes in rat offspring, changes characterized by altered activity patterns and emotional-motivational responsiveness to environmental challenges.", 
    "64": "The in vitro response of sheep platelets to platelet activating factor (PAF) was investigated. Sheep platelet-rich plasma aggregated in response to PAF with an EC50 of 10 nM. Platelets isolated via arabinogalactan density gradient centrifugation displayed an EC50 of 50 pM with a threshold response at 0.1 pM. PAF-induced release of 14C-serotonin from isolated sheep platelets was comparable with an EC50 of 50 pM and threshold release at 10 fM. PAF-induced aggregation was specific in that it could be blocked by the competitive receptor antagonists Alprazolam (Upjohn, IC50 = 40 microM), L-652,731 (MSD, IC50 = 6 microM), and WEB 2086 (Boehringer Ingelheim, IC50 = 0.8 microM). At micromolar concentrations, WEB 2086 did not inhibit ADP- or thrombin-induced aggregation nor thrombin-induced serotonin release. However, at higher concentrations of WEB 2086 some inhibition of thrombin-induced platelet aggregation and release was observed. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that high concentrations of WEB 2086 can inhibit thrombin-induced clotting (Ki = 866 microM) and cleavage of the chromogenic substrate Spectrozyme-TH (Ki = 842 microM). In summary, the response of isolated sheep platelets to PAF was specifically inhibitable and was 10 to 100 times more sensitive than washed rabbit platelets, the most popular bioassay currently in use.", 
    "65": "The use of psychotropic drugs was studied in 200 cancer patients admitted to a medical oncology unit at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, in December 1987. When compared with a similar survey that studied prescription practices 10 years ago, there was a 30% increase in the use of psychotropic agents. Whereas prescription rates for different drug classes remained relatively stable, psychotropic drugs are now used for a greater range of reasons. The introduction of several new agents, especially short-acting benzodiazepines, has altered the physician's choices. Despite awareness of the different properties of psychotropic medications and their increased use, they are still underused, especially the antidepressants and antipsychotics when prescribed for psychologic distress.", 
    "66": "Rats treated one week with flurazepam were killed while still on the drug or 48 h after termination of drug treatment. The brain 'microsac' preparation derived from the cerebral cortices was used for studying the GABA-stimulated chloride influx. There was no significant change in the basal or GABA-stimulated influx between control and treated groups. However, the effect of flunitrazepam to enhance 10 microM GABA-stimulated influx was significantly reduced, indicating tolerance. Methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3- carboxylate (DMCM), an 'inverse agonist' at benzodiazepine receptors, dose dependently inhibited 50 microM GABA-stimulated influx; chronic treatment did not alter the effect of DMCM. This study demonstrates that one week treatment with flurazepam produces tolerance to benzodiazepines without any change in the effect of GABA or DMCM. This indicates that GABA and benzodiazepine sites are differently modulated after chronic treatment with benzodiazepines. However, since both benzodiazepine and DMCM act on the same receptors it appears that the different 'domains' on the benzodiazepine receptor are differently altered during chronic treatment.", 
    "67": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the involvement of dopaminergic (DA) neurones afferent to the prefrontal cortex in stress-related behaviours induced by controllable vs uncontrollable negative events. Rats were either sham-operated or given a bilateral infusion of 6-hydroxydopamine (4 micrograms in 0.4 microliter) into the prefrontal cortex which resulted in a specific and almost complete (80%) reduction of local DA. Three weeks after surgery, sham and lesioned rats were subjected to one of the following experimental procedures involving (1) controllable or (2) uncontrollable events: (1) the punished drinking test and a FR1/FR7 schedule of food/shock presentation; (2) the forced swimming test and the learned helplessness paradigm. DA depletion in the prefrontal cortex resulted in an increase in punished responding in the drinking test and under the FR schedule; the anti-punishment effects of diazepam (2 mg/kg) were not modified. Lesions also induced a reduction in immobility duration in the forced swimming test but failed to affect the induction of escape deficits in rats trained for learned helplessness. In the latter two models, DA depletion in the prefrontal cortex did not modify the antidepressant effects of desipramine (32 mg/kg and 24 mg/kg/day, respectively). These results suggest that controllable and acute aversive situations may be modulated by DA neurones in the prefrontal cortex. DA neurones, however, may not be crucial in the modulation of delayed and uncontrollable stress-related behaviours. Taken together, the present findings suggest that an increased tendency to perseverate could be the main behavioural feature associated with DA lesion in the prefrontal cortex. Acute vs delayed consequences of negative events could be an additional relevant factor for the involvement of DA neurons in stress-related behaviours.", 
    "68": "Polyclonal antibodies were raised to synthetic amino acid sequences of the bovine GABAA receptor alpha 2- and alpha 3-subunits and purified by affinity chromatography on a column coupled with the respective peptide. Anti-peptide alpha 2(416-424) and anti-peptide alpha 3(459-467) antibodies immunoprecipitated GABAA receptors and recognized a protein of 53 kDa (P53) and 59 kDa (P59), respectively, in Western blots of GABAA receptors purified from the brains of 5-10 day old rats. P53 as well as P59 are specifically photolabeled by [3H]flunitrazepam and are recognized by the alpha-subunit specific monoclonal antibody bd 28.", 
    "69": "Foot-shock produced a more than 2-fold increase in noradrenaline (NA) release from the frontal cortex of freely moving rats. The effect of acute stress was almost completely prevented by the administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.). Diazepam alone inhibited cortical NA release, the maximal inhibition (-57%) being observed 90 min after the injection. Cortical NA release therefore appears to be a reliable index of central noradrenergic activity in response to stressful conditions.", 
    "70": "Muscarinic receptors present in longitudinal ileum were characterized using the non-selective radioligand [3H]N-methylscopolamine [( 3H]NMS) and the M3 selective radioligand [3H]4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide [( 3H]4DAMP). In saturation studies, [3H]4DAMP, but not [3H]NMS, identified two populations of binding sites with 17% of the sites (155 fmol/mg protein) displaying high affinity (Kd = 0.39 nM) for [3H]4DAMP and the remaining sites displaying low affinity for the radioligand (Kd = 4.43 nM). In competition studies gallamine and methoctramine, but not AF-DX 116, identified two populations of [3H]NMS binding sites. Affinity estimates for gallamine and methoctramine indicated that 80% of the [3H]NMS binding sites were of the M2 subtype. The minor population of [3H]NMS binding sites could not be readily characterized, due partly to the low selectivity of the competing ligands and also to the relatively low density of the sites. In studies using the M3 muscarinic receptor selective radioligand [3H]4DAMP, the minor population of sites could be preferentially labeled by using a low concentration (0.4 nM) of [3H]4DAMP. Under these conditions, [3H]4DAMP labeled approximately equal levels of the two muscarinic receptor binding sites present in the ileum. Competition studies with AF-DX 116, gallamine and methoctramine indicated that the two [3H]4DAMP binding sites displayed the pharmacology expected of the M2 and M3 receptors, respectively. These results provide additional evidence that longitudinal ileal smooth muscle membranes contain both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors and indicate that [3H]4DAMP is a useful ligand for identifying heterogeneity of muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "71": "The role of gastrin, acetylcholine and histamine in the acid response to central vagal activation induced by intracisternal injection of the stable analog, RX 77368, was further investigated in urethane-anesthetized rats with gastric fistula. The gastrin monoclonal antibody 28-2 injected intravenously, at a dose previously shown to prevent gastrin-induced stimulation of acid secretion, did not alter the peak acid response to intracisternal injection of RX 77368 (15 ng). The TRH analog (30 ng) injected into the cisterna magna increased levels of histamine measured in the hepatic portal blood. Cimetidine administered at a dose which completely blocked the stimulation of gastric acid secretion produced by intravenous infusion of histamine, inhibited by 62% the stimulatory effect of intracisternal RX 77368 (30 ng). The M1 muscarinic antagonist, pirenzepine, completely prevented the acid secretion induced by intracisternal RX 77368 (30 ng). These results indicate that the acid response to central vagal activation by the TRH analog in rats involved M1 muscarinic receptors along with histamine release acting on H2 histaminergic receptors whereas gastrin does not appear to play an important role.", 
    "72": "Alprazolam is a widely used antianxiety agent, yet relatively little is known about the relationship between chronic oral doses and steady-state plasma levels. This study examines the relationship over a wide range of therapeutic doses. We conducted a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 36 patients with agoraphobia with panic attacks, or panic disorder with limited phobic avoidance based on DSM-III criteria. Patients received alprazolam (N = 25) or placebo (N = 11) beginning at 1 mg/day and increased weekly until either a maximum tolerated dose or 10 mg/day was achieved. Dosages were then gradually tapered according to a predetermined schedule. The entire study period lasted 14 weeks. Laboratory and clinical assessments were conducted weekly. Doses up to 6 mg/day were tolerated by 80% of patients on alprazolam and doses of 10 mg/day were tolerated by 40% of patients. Twenty-seven percent of the placebo patients reached 10 tablets/day. In the alprazolam group, the principal cause of intolerance was sedation. Throughout the study no significant changes in vital signs or laboratory parameters were observed. Steady state alprazolam, 4-hydroxy alprazolam, and alpha-hydroxy alprazolam plasma levels were linearly related to dose. A 1 mg dosage increment produced, on the average, a corresponding 10 ng/ml increase in steady state level of the parent drug. Significant response was observed in subjects who achieved concentrations greater than 20 ng/ml, with a maximum of 81% of the samples classified as responders within the 60 ng/ml and above group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "Cigarette smoking-induced alterations in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and effectiveness are reviewed. Drug therapy can be affected pharmacokinetically by polyaromatic hydrocarbons and pharmacodynamically by nicotine. Pentazocine and phenylbutazone show increased metabolism in smokers and may have to be given in higher dosages. Smokers experience less pain relief with propoxyphene than do nonsmokers. Codeine, meperidine, and morphine are unaffected pharmacokinetically, and the effect on acetaminophen is probably not clinically important. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, and phenobarbital are not influenced. Heparin metabolism is elevated in smokers; this effect may necessitate modest increases in dosage. Warfarin clearance is increased, but this is not associated with a change in prothrombin time. Pindolol and propranolol are unaffected pharmacokinetically, but direct effects of nicotine may interfere with blood pressure control. Smoking transiently diminishes the diuretic effect of furosemide, inconsistently affects protein binding of lidocaine, and has no effect on prednisone, prednisolone, or dexamethasone. The metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites is increased. Smoking is associated with decreased subcutaneous absorption of insulin and increased dosage requirements. Healing of GI ulcers with histamine H2-receptor antagonists may be compromised in smokers; sucralfate is probably more useful. Imipramine, benzodiazepines, chlorpromazine, and glutethimide may be influenced, and theophylline metabolism is accelerated. Cigarette smoking can affect the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of many drugs.", 
    "74": "It was hypothesized that triazolam might decrease central apneas associated with arousal periods in patients with central sleep apnea by hastening the onset of consolidated sleep. Five male patients, diagnosed as having central sleep apnea on a screening night, participated in a double-blind randomized crossover study of the effect of placebo, 0.125 mg triazolam, and 0.25 mg triazolam on sleep, respiration, and daytime function. Results indicated that the medication increased total sleep and decreased central apnea index and number of brief arousals. Improved sleep quality was reflected in improved daytime psychomotor performance and alertness. These data, if replicated, imply that benzodiazepine use may be beneficial in patients with central sleep apnea.", 
    "75": "In an earlier paper, we reported the development of (+-)-7-iodo-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-(4'-azidophenyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro- 1H-3-benzazepine (I-MAB) and its 125I analogue ([125I]I-MAB) as selective, high affinity photoaffinity labels for the D-1 dopamine receptor. In this report, we now describe the complete synthesis and resolution of I-MAB and the pharmacological characterization of the stereoisomers in canine striatal membranes. R-(+)-I-MAB showed highly specific dopamine D-1 receptor binding (KD = 0.28 nM) and binds selectively and stereoselectively to the D-1 receptor. These results further confirm the previous suggestion that, in the benzazepine series of DA agonists and antagonists, the activity principally resides in the R-(+) enantiomer, the S-(-) enantiomer being considerably less potent or inactive. Moreover, R-(+)-[125I]I-MAB, upon photolysis, identifies the ligand-binding subunits of the neuronal D-1 receptor, with an apparent Mr of 74,000, 62,000, and 51,000 as assessed by autoradiography following sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Photoincorporation of R-(+)-[125I]I-MAB into these polypeptides was stereoselectively blocked by D-1 dopaminergic ligands with an appropriate pharmacologic profile for the receptor. R-(+)-[125I]I-MAB should thus prove to be a useful stereoselective photoaffinity label for the further characterization of the D-1 receptors.", 
    "76": "The purpose of this study was to compare a high and low dose of diazepam with chloral hydrate in the sedation of young children. Thirty healthy children between the ages of 20 and 48 months, with a mean age of 33.5 months, participated in the study. All children exhibited negative behavior during a screening visit and required at least two restorative appointments with the use of sedation. A dose of either 0.3 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg of diazepam at one visit and 50 mg/kg of chloral hydrate at another visit was administered in a double-blind manner. All children were restrained in a Papoose Board with auxiliary head restraint and received 50% nitrous oxide/oxygen during treatment. The degree of sleep, body movement, crying, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and blood oxygen saturation were monitored before and during the operative procedures. Vital signs remained essentially unchanged during treatment, except for transitory elevations of the pulse during periods of stimulation. There were no statistically significant differences among the three drug regimens with regard to movement and crying. Significantly more patients who received chloral hydrate were asleep than when either dose of diazepam was given during the first 60 min of treatment. The only side effect found was vomiting in one patient with both chloral hydrate and diazepam. It is concluded that the sedative effects of chloral hydrate and diazepam are similar when young children are sedated for dental treatment. The use of diazepam might be more advantageous because chloral hydrate produces more sleep during the first hour of treatment.", 
    "77": "1. In the portal vein of permanently cannulated, freely moving, unanaesthetized rats, methacholine (MCh) is able to inhibit the electrically-evoked endogenous noradrenaline (NA) overflow. This inhibition is mediated by presynaptic inhibitory muscarinic heteroreceptors. 2. By use of pirenzepine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) and AF-DX 116 as M1-, M3-, and M2-selective antagonists respectively, the MCh (0.1 microM)-induced inhibition of the electrically-evoked NA overflow could be reversed to the control stimulation value dose-dependently. 3. The potency order of the antagonists was: 4-DAMP greater than AF-DX 116 greater than pirenzepine, pIC50 values being 8.50, 7.96 and 7.01, respectively. 4. From these results it was concluded that the inhibitory presynaptic heteroreceptors in the portal vein of conscious unrestrained rats are of the cardiac M2-subtype.", 
    "78": "The effectiveness of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in reducing negative contrast on the first day after a shift from 32% to 4% sucrose was investigated in four experiments using rats. Previous studies indicated that CDP was effective on the second, but not on the first postshift day. In Experiments 1 and 1a, neither initial experience (3 or 10 days) with the eventual postshift 4% solution (i.e. 4%, then 32%, then 4%), nor initial experience with alternating 4% and 32% sucrose, led to a reliable contrast-reducing effect of CDP on the first shift day. Evidence from Experiments 2 and 3 suggested that a range of doses of CDP (3, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg) did not have reliable effects on the first postshift day, although the two lower doses did reduce contrast on the second postshift day (the higher doses were not administered on Day 2). The evidence suggests that the relative ineffectiveness of CDP in moderating the initial response to reward reduction is not related to a problem of recognizing the difference between the postshift solution and the memory of the preshift solution. Alternative interpretations in which CDP's lack of effect on the initial occurrence of contrast is related to an initial stage of unconditioned frustration and/or exploratory behaviour are considered.", 
    "79": "We compared midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 and fentanyl 50 micrograms with thiamylal 4 mg.kg-1 for rapid sequence induction. We could use midazolam safely in patients with bronchial asthma or drug allergy. There was no difference in time from the beginning of induction to intubation between midazolam treated group and thiamylal treated group. Changes in systolic as well as diastolic blood pressure and heart rate during 2 hours from intubation were smaller in midazolam treated group than in thiamylal treated group. In midazolam treated group, no arrhythmias were observed at the time of intubation. We could reduce the amount of anesthetics in midazolam treated group during 2 hours from intubation. From the results mentioned above, we conclude that midazolam is a useful agent for rapid sequence induction.", 
    "80": "The amygdaloid kindling phenomenon has been widely used to evaluate and screen potential anticonvulsant compounds in adult rats. In the current study, weanling rats (ages 23-25 days) were implanted chronically with amygdaloid electrodes. They were treated with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 0.5 mg/kg diazepam or 1.0 mg/kg diazepam before twice daily kindling stimulations to determine the effect of diazepam on the acquisition of the kindled seizure. Additional juvenile rats implanted as weanlings and simulated twice daily without drug pretreatment until fully kindled were used to test for the acute anticonvulsant effects of diazepam (0.25-4.0 mg/kg). Diazepam was demonstrated to have anticonvulsant properties in juvenile rats by both prolonging the time to develop the fully kindled response during acquisition and by reducing the elicited seizure severity and the length of the afterdischarge in the fully kindled juvenile rats. Together, these data point to the extension of the anticonvulsant profile of diazepam to now include juvenile amygdaloid kindling in rats. They further point to the potential ability of screening proposed anticonvulsant drugs for their efficacy against amygdaloid kindling in immature rats."
