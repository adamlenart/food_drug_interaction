The aim was to study the acceptance and cooperation of the families, the psychological attitude and the relation between the findings and parents' educational level. At the end of the follow-up, 80% of the 91 families showed good cooperation and psychological benefits. There was no relationship between the findings at the end of the follow-up and families' educational level. Even in the presence of a favorable psychological attitude, recurrences of febrile convulsions were still a frightening experience for many parents.", 
    "1": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus contains a neural oscillatory system which regulates many circadian rhythms in mammals. Immunohistochemical evidence indicates that a relatively high density of GABAergic neurons exist in the suprachiasmatic region. Since intraperitoneal injections of the benzodiazepine, triazolam, have been shown to induce phase shifts in the free-running circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in the golden hamster, the extent to which microinjections of muscimol, a specific agonist for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), may cause phase-shifts in hamster activity rhythms was investigated. Stereotaxically implanted guide cannulae aimed at the region of the SCN were used to deliver repeated microinjections in individual animals. A phase-response curve (PRC) generated from microinjections of muscimol revealed that the magnitude and direction of permanent phase-shifts in the activity rhythm were associated with the time of administration. The PRC generated for muscimol was characterized by maximal phase-advances induced 6 h before activity onset and by maximal phase-delays which occurred 6 h after activity onset. The PRC for muscimol had a shape similar to a PRC previously generated for the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam. Single microinjections of different doses of muscimol given 6 h before activity onset induced phase-advances in a dose-dependent fashion. Histological analysis revealed that phase shifts induced by the administration of muscimol were associated with the proximity of the injection site to the SCN area. These data indicate that a GABAergic system may exist within the suprachiasmatic region as part of a central biological clock responsible for the regulation of the circadian rhythm of locomotor activity in the golden hamster.", 
    "2": "Clobazam was used as an added treatment in 28 patients with intractable epilepsies: 26 subjects had associated handicaps. A good response was observed during the first two-three months of Clobazam treatment: the reduction in seizure frequency of 73% for partial seizures and 62% for GTCs. A tolerance to Clobazam treatment was observed after the third month of treatment: at the end of the sixth month, the seizure frequency was reduced to 36% for partial seizures and 39% for GTCs. Out of 28 patients 4 were seizure free at the end of the sixth month; we have not found any specific characteristic in these patients. The AA. suggest the possibility of an intermittent use of Clobazam for this type of patients.", 
    "3": "A randomised double-blind trial was undertaken to compare epidural lignocaine 1.5% with adrenaline to epidural fentanyl (100 micrograms in saline 10 ml) in forty unpremedicated patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy without ancillary procedures. Midazolam only was used for sedation. There was no significant difference in intraoperative pain scores with several patients in each group complaining of pain. Decreases in blood pressure occurred in both groups but were more pronounced in the lignocaine groups (36% vs 25% maximum decrease from control, P = 0.004). Heart rate was increased in the lignocaine group compared with control and to the fentanyl group, but there was no difference in respiratory rates within or between groups. Pruritus was more common in the fentanyl group and leg heaviness in the lignocaine group, but neither was troublesome. There was no difference in urological outcome at one month. Both techniques were satisfactory for the majority of patients, but the fentanyl group had a shorter preparation time and less cardiovascular changes.", 
    "4": "Fifty-five patients completed a 5-week double-blind study comparing alprazolam, propranolol, and placebo in the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks. There was no concomitant behavioral treatment. Patient and therapist rating scales included Sheehan's Panic and Anxiety Attack Scales, the Marks-Sheehan Phobia Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the Side Effects Checklist. The results generally support the efficacy of alprazolam, but not propranolol, in the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks. The significance of the results are discussed, as well as a number of the unique aspects of our procedures and patient population.", 
    "5": "Subjects primarily suffering from DSM-III panic disorders (agoraphobia with panic attacks, 13 subjects; panic disorder, one subject) were tested with two drug treatments after a baseline was established using single-blind placebo capsules three times daily for 1 week. Double-blind, 4-week crossover treatments were given with alprazolam, 0.5-6.0 mg/day, and adinazolam mesylate, 10-120 mg/day. Mean final doses in mg/day were 3.1 for alprazolam and 95.5 for adinazolam mesylate. Both were broadly effective in comparison with the baseline condition. Measures included self-rated symptoms and global impressions, physician-rated global impressions, and two forms of challenges, agoraphobic and noradrenergic. The two active drugs were highly similar in overall efficacy across the sample, but alprazolam was favored globally in six subjects, and adinazolam was favored globally in another six subjects. Only two subjects obtained maximal improvement ratings without side effects with both drugs. No diagnostic or demographic factor correlated with the differential in responses to the two active treatments. No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities occurred with either drug.", 
    "6": "Rational use of premedication for anaesthesia must always be modified and updated to keep pace with the evolving fields of anaesthesiology and surgery, as well as to meet changing patient needs and preferences. It is no longer axiomatic that all patients require, and therefore should receive, premedication. Unfortunately, a variety of traditional reasons have been proposed to justify routine premedication in many institutions. Smoothing induction, decreasing reflexes and arrhythmias, decreasing nausea and vomiting, decreasing pain, decreasing secretions, and producing sedation and amnesia have all been claimed historically as beneficial results of premedication. Modern anaesthetic agents and techniques have come a long way towards eliminating the routine need for premedication. In the preoperative period, the goal of an anxiety-free patient who is physiologically uncompromised requires an individualised approach based on experience and an adequate knowledge of current pharmacology. As our knowledge of potential problems associated with anaesthesia has expanded, we have added other classes of drugs such as the H2-histamine receptor blockers and antacids to our premedicant armamentarium. Outpatient and short-stay patients have further challenged our preoperative goal of an anxiety-free patient by requiring individuals to be 'street ready' within a brief period of time after surgery. Even for in-house elective procedures, not every patient is a candidate for routine premedication. A frank preoperative discussion is all that is necessary to effectively allay anxiety in many persons. In these and other special situations, this article will hopefully guide the reader toward a more rational approach to premedicating patients.", 
    "7": "With the aim of assessing four forms of therapy with adjustment-disordered outpatients, we randomly assigned 70 subjects to the following treatments: supportive psychotherapy (psychoanalytically oriented), viloxazine (an antidepressant), lormetazepam (a benzodiazepine), and S-adenosylmethionine (a methyl donor with antidepressive properties). A further group of 15 subjects received a placebo, orally administered. The trial lasted 4 wk. None of the treatments had clearly superior effects over others on scores on the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. All produced a significant improvement. However, groups given S-adenosylmethionine and supportive psychotherapy had the highest mean scores.",

    "9": "Drugs are the most cost-effective modality of chronic care, and older adults with multiple illnesses often need multiple drugs. Because this may lead to drug interactions, adverse drug effects, and problems with compliance, drug regimens should be individualized and as few drugs as possible used.

Patients and providers must agree on a particular regimen, its goals, promises, and limitations.", 
    "10": "While psychiatric populations with panic disorder have been shown to be responsive to several classes of psychoactive medications, there is little evidence that medical patients with panic disorder respond to similar interventions. In this non-blind, eight-week trial of alprazolam in patients presenting with chest pain and found to have panic disorder, 15 of 20 met the single criterion for improvement: a 50 percent or greater reduction in panic frequency. Several other measures were also significantly positive for those who completed the study. Furthermore, these patients reported a marginally significant drop in episodes of chest pain or discomfort. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is now required to test the validity of these findings.",

    "13": "To assess pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of acute, subchronic and withdrawn quazepam, a single-blind, longitudinal study was run in eight male, healthy young volunteers. The design covered a 1-week placebo run-in period, a period with daily oral night-time administration of 15 mg quazepam until a pharmacokinetic steady-state was reached (3 weeks) and a 2-week placebo withdrawal period. Oculodynamic Test (ODT) (EOG-registration with simultaneous choice reaction task, CRT) and Adaptive Pursuit Tracking Test (APTT) were used for assessment of intradiurnal and long-term profiles of attention, perception, cognition, objective sedation, psychomotor and muscular (force-related) parameters and cardiorespiratory measures under workload. Visual analogue scales (VAS) of sedation, excitation and state anxiety were applied additionally. Plasma levels of quazepam and its metabolites (oxoquazepam and desalkyl-oxoquazepam) were intermittently analyzed by GC, within 24 h after actual blood sampling in the morning of assessment days, to check the attainment of the intended criterion for termination of medication (steady-state, \"on-line kinetic procedure\"). Adverse effects were recorded by subjects' written free recall and a symptom-checklist. Although a pharmacokinetic steady-state could be reached in sequence for the parent drug quazepam and its metabolites within 3 weeks, there was no pharmacodynamic steady-state at the end of this period, but a continuous impairment in oculomotor variables. Performance in the choice reaction task and the APTT showed a similar tendency, which was masked to a certain extend by learning effects. There were no signs for rebound effects within the 2 weeks after withdrawal. Relevant carry-over phenomena declined after 3 days of withdrawal.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "This paper is concerned with classification, clinical-electroencephalographic correlation, principles of treatment, and pharmaceutic therapy of epileptic psychoses. Based on the system of the physically founded reversible psychoses, classification of epileptic psychoses is developed, which is easy to apply for clinical and research purposes. Its principles are the criteria of disturbance of consciousness and of connexion to epileptic seizures. Epileptic psychoses without disturbance of consciousness frequently go along with a forced normalization of epileptic EEG-changes. This clinical-electroencephalographic correlation is documented by the cases of a depressive-paranoid and a cenesthetic alternative-psychosis. Epileptic psychoses connected to seizures, going along with disturbances of consciousness, however, show, without any exception, a pathological changed EEG. Also in the cases of the often iatrogenically produced epileptic psychoses with disturbances of consciousness yet not connected to seizures, the EEG-results are of decisive diagnostic importance. Each of these three clinical-electroencephalographically defined groups of psychoses calls for concentration on particular pathogenetical aspects concerning a specific pharmaceutic therapy. The respective principles of treatment are developed in subtly differentiated ways and they are provided with suggestion as to medicamental treatment. Schizophrenia-like epileptic psychoses are a model for idiopathic schizophrenias and so important perspective opens up for research.", 
    "15": "Explants of adult rat neurohypophysis were maintained in culture for 14 days. The majority of cells present in the outgrowth of such cultures were identified as pituicytes on the basis of immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein. Pituicytes were also stained by antisera to the membrane glycoprotein antigen Thy-1 and the extracellular matrix glycoprotein fibronectin. The cultures contained naloxone sensitive binding sites for the opioid receptor ligand [3H] dynorphin A 1-8 and peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. Dynorphin binding was visualised over pituicytes following autoradiography. The morphology of cultured pituicytes was regulated by beta-adrenergic receptors present on the cells which, when activated, stimulated rapid transformation from a flattened irregular morphology to a stellate, process-bearing morphology. Dynorphin was without effect on the morphology of cultured pituicytes. These findings are discussed in the context of the known morphological plasticity of pituicytes in vivo.",

    "17": "Previous studies of freezing and open-field activity have demonstrated that lactating rats are less fearful or less anxious than nonpregnant ones. The purpose of this investigation was to observe the behavior of mother rats in conflict tests, which are frequently used in studies on the neurobiology of anxiety. In the punished drinking test, in which licking from a water spout is punished by electric shocks, mothers (observed on Day 1 postpartum following 24 hr of water deprivation) were found to drink more than virgins. Mothers (Day 1 postpartum) also consumed more food than controls in an unfamiliar open field. In contrast, no difference between mothers (Day 5 postpartum) and virgins was present in the exploration of an electrified shock probe. The largest maternal anticonflict effects in the drinking and feeding tests were recorded when the females were tested with their pups. Increased punished drinking was also observed in virgin rats treated with the anxiolytic benzodiazepine midazolam. Water-deprived virgins and mothers did not differ in the shock titration test, a result suggesting that diminished pain reactivity was unlikely to account for the increased punished drinking in mothers. Moreover, females in late pregnancy, which are hypoalgesic (Gintzler, 1980), did not lick more than virgins in the punished drinking test. Following 24 hr of water deprivation, unpunished drinking was higher in lactating females than in virgins, so the increased acceptance of punishment by mothers might have been due to their being more thirsty than virgins.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "A double-blind, randomised study was performed to investigate whether aminophylline could reverse the sedative effect of benzodiazepine and if it could shorten the observation time necessary after benzodiazepine sedation. Forty patients undergoing minor abdominal, urogenital or lower extremity surgery were given benzodiazepine to maintain a state of deep sedation after spinal or epidural analgesia was achieved. Postoperatively, the patients received either aminophylline, 110 mg, or physiological saline intravenously. The aminophylline-treated patients showed a significantly more rapid reversal of sedation, but after 30 min there was no difference between the two groups. It is concluded that aminophylline antagonizes the sedative effect of benzodiazepine, but in routine benzodiazepine sedation, aminophylline will not shorten the necessary observation period after sedation.", 
    "19": "A prospective study of 1094 consecutive adult patients undergoing coronary revascularization was undertaken to determine the effect of anesthetic technique on outcome. Patients received one of five primary techniques: high-dose fentanyl (greater than 50 micrograms/kg), moderate-dose fentanyl (less than 50 micrograms/kg), sufentanil (3-8 micrograms/kg), diazepam (0.4-1 mg/kg) with ketamine (3-6 mg/kg) or halothane (0.5-2.5% inspired concentration after thiopental induction). Supplemental inhalation anesthesia (enflurane, halothane, or isoflurane) was used in 60% of cases where the primary technique was intravenous based. Patients in the above anesthetic groupings had similar perioperative demographic and risk classifications. The overall incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction, postoperative low cardiac output state, and in-hospital death were 4.1, 5.6, and 3.1%, respectively. There were no significant differences in the incidence of these occurrences or in the incidence of serious pulmonary, renal, or neurologic morbidity or length of ICU stay among primary anesthetic techniques nor among supplemental inhalation agent groups. Multivariate discriminant analysis of this data suggests that a multitude of factors are significantly more important than anesthetic technique as determinants of outcome after coronary artery surgery.", 
    "20": "Alprazolam added to stable doses of neuroleptics in nine schizophrenic patients was associated with a 20%-30% mean reduction in positive and negative symptoms, although clinical response was variable and in some patients particularly brisk. The authors examined the possibilities of a pharmacokinetic effect of alprazolam on neuroleptic plasma levels and of a clinical effect of alprazolam. The modest increase in mean neuroleptic plasma levels did not correlate with clinical change, but those patients with the highest alprazolam plasma levels tended to show more robust clinical responses.", 
    "21": "1. The effects of the anticholinesterase eserine on CA3 pyramidal cells and dentate gyrus granule cells in guinea-pig hippocampal slices were investigated with single-electrode current-clamp and voltage-clamp recording. 2. In the majority of cells superfused with eserine (0.5-10 microM) for 3-10 min, tetanic stimulation near the cell layers elicited a delayed depolarization (slow EPSP; duration up to 60 s) at a pre-stimulation membrane potential of -60 mV. The slow EPSP was blocked by atropine (1 microM). 3. Under voltage clamp at -60 mV holding potential, an apparent inward current (slow EPSC) with a similar time course to the slow EPSP was observed. 4. The amplitude of the delayed inward current was about 50 pA. The amplitude increased at holding potentials more positive than -60 mV. At holding potentials negative to -60 mV, the delayed inward current was too small to allow reliable analysis. In the absence of eserine, there was a delayed inward current, which was rather small, however, due to a superimposed outward current. 5. Eserine reduced the after-hyperpolarization following a train of action potentials. This effect was antagonized by atropine, but not to pirenzepine. In voltage-clamp recording, eserine reduced a current termed IAHP. 6. CA3 neurones treated with eserine exhibited a region of negative slope conductance (in tetrodotoxin). The slow inward current which developed at clamp potentials between -50 and -40 mV was reduced by Ni2+ (50 microM). The effect of eserine on slope conductance increased with time of exposure. In all neurones superfused with eserine for more than 60 min, burst discharges were observed. Burst discharges were blocked by atropine and Ni2+, but not by pirenzepine. 7. In cells superfused with eserine for more than 1 h, tetanic stimulation failed to elicit a slow EPSP or EPSC. Currents induced by focal acetylcholine (ACh) application were first enhanced by eserine, but blocked after exposure to eserine for more than 1 h. Blockade of ACh-induced currents was also observed after bath application of carbachol (CCh) in a concentration (0.2 microM) in which it did not induce an inward current at -60 mV holding potential. Further, the slow EPSP faded when elicited by repeated tetanic stimulation. 8. While the observed effects of eserine on hippocampal neurones can be explained by eserine's well-known ability to block acetylcholinesterase activity, our data indicate that the effects of eserine involve more than one muscarinic receptor site, i.e. desensitizing and non-desensitizing postsynaptic receptor sites.", 
    "22": "A retrospective study on patients with acute poisoning admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Ichilov Hospital over a 3-year period (1982-84) is presented. Of 419 patients seen in the Emergency Room for intoxication during these years, 71 (17%) required intensive care upon admission. Suicide attempts accounted for 90% of the ICU admissions, with drugs of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) group being the most commonly used (51%). Mixed-drug overdose was seen in 55% of the patients. There was a poor correlation between the drugs suspected on admission and those actually detected in the blood. Although the total number of admissions due to poisoning increased in 1984 (21 in 1982 vs. 37 in 1984), mechanical ventilation was required by fewer patients (92% in 1982 vs. 51% in 1984) and for a shorter period of time (3.1 days in 1982 vs. 2.1 days in 1984), which resulted in a shorter ICU stay (4.8 days in 1982 vs. 3.1 days in 1984). The introduction of the new BDZ antagonist flumazenil may have partially accounted for this positive trend.", 
    "23": "In an attempt to identify a tumour marker, we investigated peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) in kidney specimens obtained from patients who underwent nephrectomy due to a renal mass. [3H]PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, was used as a ligand. Binding assays were conducted on samples of membrane homogenate taken from both the healthy portion and the tumour site of the kidney. It was found that binding characteristics of benign tumours and normal kidney tissues were not significantly different, i.e. equilibrium dissociation constants of 2.20 +/- 0.73 and 2.38 +/- 0.98 nM, respectively, and maximal number of binding sites of 3190 +/- 1081 and 4189 +/- 998 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In contrast, no PBS were detectable in renal carcinoma. The absence of PBS in malignant renal tissues may serve as a biochemical marker for tumours of the kidney.", 
    "24": "1. Seven benzodiazepines were investigated for their ability to interact with receptors for thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) on GH3 and GH4C1 pituitary tumour cells. 2. Midazolam and chlordiazepoxide were the most potent inhibitors of TRH-induced [3H]-inositol phosphate formation with Ki values in the low micromolar range. The antagonism was competitive in nature and was increased in potency at sub-physiological temperatures. 3. None of the agents examined antagonized bombesin-induced [3H]-inositol phosphate formation in GH4C1 cells. 4. While the ability of benzodiazepines to interact with the GABA receptor-chloride channel ionophore is markedly stereospecific, little difference was evident in the ability of (+)- and (-)-4-methylmidazolam (Ro 21-5656 and Ro 21-5657) to compete with TRH at its receptor. 5. Recently it has been suggested that, in contrast to phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, the TRH-induced breakdown of phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates is transient in clonal pituitary cells. Addition of chlordiazepoxide to TRH-stimulated GH3 cells up to 60 min after initiating the reaction leads, however, to an immediate decline in the cellular content of inositol trisphosphate. This indicates that TRH-induced phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis is not transient.", 
    "25": "In this article we report the results of two experiments examining the role of central benzodiazepine receptor sites in the response to novelty. Animals that were food deprived and presented with food in a novel environment showed long latencies before they began eating. Pretreatment with diazepam or preexposure to the \"novel\" environment for 1 hr/day for 4 or 7 days before testing in that environment dramatically reduced the latency to begin eating. Administration of either the \"inverse agonist,\" FG-7142, or an antagonist, RO15-1788, of the central benzodiazepine receptor before testing completely reversed the effects of 7 days of preexposure to the novel environment. In home-cage feeding tests, FG-7142, but not RO15-1788, increased the latency to begin feeding in food-deprived animals. These findings indicate that FG-7142 is strongly anxiogenic, whereas RO15-1788 is not anxiogenic, yet both drugs are potent in reversing the effects of habituation. The results of these experiments suggest that the normal process of habituation to novelty may involve the release of an endogenous, anxiolytic compound (an agonist) that binds to a central benzodiazepine receptor, the effects of which are blocked by RO15-1788.", 
    "26": "The meta- and para-isothiocyanato derivatives of t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate (TBOB) were synthesized by catalytic reduction of the corresponding nitro compounds, followed by treatment with thiophosgene. p-NCS-TBOB (2) inhibited the binding of both [3H]TBOB and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) with potencies (IC50 of 61 and 23 nM, respectively) similar to the parent compound. In contrast, the meta derivative (m-NCS-TBOB, 1) was more than 1 order of magnitude less potent (IC50 of 1588 and 149 nM, respectively). The IC50 values for both 1 and 2 were strongly dependent on the tissue concentration, in a manner characteristic of irreversible inhibitors. Moreover, preincubation of tissue with these compounds, followed by extensive washing, resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the number of [35S]TBPS binding sites and in the apparent affinity of this radioligand. Similar effects were not observed in tissues treated in identical fashion with either TBOB or picrotoxin. Preincubation with p-NCS-TBOB at concentrations that significantly inhibit [35S]TBPS or [3H]TBOB binding did not affect radioligand binding to either benzodiazepine or gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. These findings suggest that m- and p-NCS-TBOB bind irreversibly to sites labeled by cage convulsants such as TBOB and TBPS, which are on or near GABA-gated chloride channels. p-NCS-TBOB should prove useful in determining the molecular characteristics of the benzodiazepine receptor-coupled GABA-gated chloride ionophore.", 
    "27": "We have previously shown that approximately 20% of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A/benzodiazepine receptors in intact neurons are intracellular [J. Neurosci. 6:2857-2863 (1986); Mol. Pharmacol., 35: 75-84], but the nature of this pool remained unknown. In this report, we describe the synthesis, appearance in the plasma membrane, and degradation of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in nerve cells derived from embryonic chick brain and grown in primary monolayer cell culture. Irreversible photoaffinity labeling of the benzodiazepine-sensitive modulator site on the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor using [3H]flunitrazepam as a permeable probe was used in conjunction with exhaustive trypsinization of intact cells and competition binding using Ro7-0213 (a benzodiazepine bearing a charged quarternary ammonium moiety). Newly synthesized intracellular receptors that are transported to the surface membrane comprise at most only 4% of total receptors and up to one fifth of the steady state intracellular pool. The kinetics of receptor recovery after photoaffinity blockade are consistent with a model in which newly synthesized receptors first appear within the cell and then undergo intracellular transit before appearing on the cell surface. This suggests a \"precursor-product\" relationship between newly synthesized intracellular receptors and surface receptors. However, the majority of intracellular receptors are not transported to the cell surface and may represent a \"nonprecursor\" pool. The kinetics of degradation for intracellular receptors are consistent with the overall kinetics for total (surface plus intracellular) receptors. Intracellular and surface receptors are pharmacologically similar with regard to their sensitivity to methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate binding and their affinity for flunitrazepam. Degradation of the individual receptor subunits (with apparent molecular weights of 51,000 and 48,000) was monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and both photoaffinity-labeled subunits degrade with indistinguishable biphasic kinetics. From these results, and the results of our previous studies, we propose a minimal model describing the dynamic cellular pathway for GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor metabolism in central nervous system neurons.", 
    "28": "We have examined the effects of chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) exposure to diazepam on firing rate responses of reticulata neurons to the inverse agonist methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788. The ability of DMCM and Ro15-1788 to alter firing rate were tested in control, chronic diazepam and acute diazepam-treated rats. In controls, DMCM increased firing rate of reticulata neurons. This effect was reversed by Ro15-1788, which had no effect on firing rate when administered alone. In acute and chronic diazepam-treated groups, low doses of DMCM were less effective in increasing firing than in controls. However, the administration of high doses of DMCM to diazepam-treated animals increased firing rates above the rates observed in control animals after the same compounds. Administration of Ro15-1788 also increased reticulata firing rates above control levels in both acute and chronic diazepam-treated groups. The similarity in reticulata responses after chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) diazepam treatments suggests that the altered properties of the benzodiazepine ligands observed after chronic exposure could reflect the presence of diazepam. This may indicate that reticulata neurons themselves do not show changes in sensitivity to benzodiazepine ligands after chronic benzodiazepine exposure. We propose that the altered responses to DMCM and Ro15-1788 in diazepam-treated rats reflect a compensatory change which occurs by 1 hr and maintains reticulata activity at a constant level throughout the period of prolonged exposure to the agonist.", 
    "29": "We have examined the ability of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), and the antagonist, Ro15-1788, to modulate gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) sensitivity of reticulata neurons after chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) diazepam exposure. Sensitivity to GABA was analyzed by monitoring single unit responses to microiontophoretically applied GABA. The inverse agonist DMCM decreased GABA sensitivity of reticulata neurons to similar levels in control, chronic diazepam and acute diazepam-treated groups. Ro15-1788 administration reversed the effects of DMCM on GABA sensitivity and also resulted in comparable levels of GABA sensitivity in all treatment groups. Thus, the ability of the inverse agonist DMCM and the antagonist Ro15-1788 to alter GABA sensitivity of reticulata neurons was not altered by diazepam treatment. However, reticulata GABA sensitivity in the absence of additional benzodiazepine ligands was enhanced in both acute and chronic diazepam groups when compared to control values. The similarity in reticulata responses after both chronic (3 week) and acute (1 hr) diazepam treatments suggests that the enhanced sensitivity to GABA merely reflects the presence of diazepam. Thus, the ability of diazepam to potentiate reticulata GABA responses does not show time-dependent changes with prolonged benzodiazepine exposure.", 
    "30": "Studies were carried out in chloralose-anesthetized cats while monitoring respiratory (tidal volume and respiratory rate) and cardiovascular (arterial pressure and heart rate) activity. Midazolam applied bilaterally to the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla in doses of 0.75, 7.5 and 75 micrograms/side reduced tidal volume by -6 +/- 3, -10 +/- 1 and -11 +/- 1 ml, respectively. A dose of 250 micrograms/side produced apnea in each animal tested. Corresponding changes in arterial pressure were -35 +/- 9, -44 +/- 6, -43 +/- 9 and -64 +/- 17 mm Hg, respectively. Larger doses of chlordiazepoxide (e.g., 1000 micrograms/side) were required to produce similar effects. Intravenous administration of midazolam in doses of 1.5 to 150 micrograms had no significant effect on cardiorespiratory activity. However, larger doses of midazolam given i.v. produced cardiorespiratory depression that was similar to that observed with centrally applied drug. Pretreatment or treatment with centrally applied flumazenil or bicuculline counteracted the cardiorespiratory effects of centrally applied midazolam. Most importantly, ventral surface application of flumazenil counteracted the cardiorespiratory depressant effects of i.v. midazolam. Central administration of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate produced cardiorespiratory effects opposite to those seen with midazolam, and these stimulatory effects were also counteracted by centrally applied flumazenil. These results indicate that alterations in cardiorespiratory activity can be produced by drugs interacting with gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptors at the ventral surface of the medulla.", 
    "31": "The muscarinic receptors in a B82 cell line which were transfected with the rat m1 muscarinic receptor gene (cTB10 cells) were studied by using radioligand binding assays. Their possible coupling to the hydrolysis of inositol lipids and cyclic AMP formation were also investigated. [(-)-[3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate [(-)-[3H]QNB] binding to the intact cTB10 cells was saturable and displaceable by 1 microM atropine sulfate. The Kd and maximum binding values of (-)-[3H]QNB from saturation studies were 12 pM and 17 fmol/10(6) cells, respectively. Inhibition studies of (-)-[3H]QNB binding to intact cTB10 cells suggested that these muscarinic receptors are of the M1 type defined by their high affinity for pirenzepine and low affinity for AF-DX 116 [11-[2-diethylamino methyl-1-piperidinylacetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b) (1,4)benzodiazepine-6-one]. The muscarinic agonist carbachol stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation in the cTB10 cells, which could be reversed by the muscarinic antagonists atropine, pirenzepine or AF-DX 116. The rank order of potency of the muscarinic antagonists in inhibiting carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation was atropine greater than pirenzepine greater than AF-DX 116, in agreement with that from ligand/(-)-[3H]QNB competition experiments. Pertussis toxin and 4 beta-phorbol, 12-beta-myristate, 13-alpha-acetate reduced carbachol-stimulated [3H]inositol monophosphate accumulation. Prostaglandin E1 stimulated cyclic AMP formation in the cTB10 cells. Carbachol at the concentration of 10 mM exhibited no stimulatory or inhibitor effect on the basal or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cyclic AMP formation. These results suggest that the muscarinic receptors encoded by the transfected m1 gene in the cTB10 cells are of the M1 type and are coupled to the hydrolysis of inositol lipids, possibly via a pertussis toxin sensitive G protein.", 
    "32": "A monoclonal antibody (mAb 62-3G1) to the GABAA receptor/benzodiazepine receptor/Cl- channel complex from bovine brain was used with light and electron microscopy in goldfish retina and light microscopy in chicken retina to localize GABAA receptor immunoreactivity (GABAr-IR). GABAr-IR was found in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) in both species, in three broad bands in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) of goldfish, and in seven major bands of the chicken IPL. A small percentage of amacrine cell bodies (composing at least three types) were stained in chicken. In goldfish OPL, GABAr-IR was localized intracellularly and along the plasma membrane of cone pedicles, whereas rod spherules were lightly stained, but always only intracellularly. In chicken, all three sublayers of the OPL were GABAr-IR. The presence of GABAr-IR on photoreceptor terminals is consistent with data indicating feedback from GABAergic horizontal cells to cones. In the goldfish IPL, GABAr-IR was localized to postsynaptic sites of amacrine cell synapses; intracellular staining of processes in the IPL also was observed in presumed \"GABAergic\" targets. A comparison of GABAr-IR with the distributions of 3H-muscimol uptake/binding, glutamate decarboxylase-IR, GABA-IR, and 3H-GABA uptake in the IPL showed either a reasonable correspondence or mismatch, depending on the marker, species, and lamina within the IPL. The distribution of GABAr-IR in the retina corresponded better with the 3H-muscimol than with 3H-benzodiazepine binding patterns yet overall was in excellent agreement with many other physiological and anatomical indicators of GABAergic function. We suggest that intracellular GABAr-IR represents the biosynthetic and/or degradative pathway of the receptor and we conclude that mAb 62-3G1 is a valid marker of GABAA receptors in these retinas and will serve as a useful probe with which to address the issue of mismatches between the localization of GABAA receptors and indicators of presynaptic GABAergic terminals.", 
    "33": "Antagonism of mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) induced convulsions, reflecting a GABAergic mechanism, was observed in a series of 1-aryl-3-(aminoalkylidene)oxindoles. Optimal MPA antagonism was associated with 3-halo, 3-alkyl, and/or 4-alkoxy substituents in the pendant aryl ring and with (dimethylamino)methylene, 1-(dimethylamino)-ethylidene and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinylidene side chains. The precise mechanism of action of these agents is unclear at this time; however, they are not GABA mimics and they do not affect GABA levels. Like other GABAergic agents, these compounds are potent enhancers of benzodiazepine binding and they antagonize cyclic GMP elevations induced by isoniazid. Compounds from this series may therefore have potential therapeutic utility as anticonvulsants or anxiolytics.", 
    "34": "Binding assays of [3H]muscimol and [3H]-flunitrazepam have been performed on brain homogenates of brainstem, cerebellum, and forebrain of genetically epileptic quaking (qk) mutant mice 20, 40, 70, and 90 days old and their corresponding controls of the same strain (C57BL/6J). The endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content has been determined in various brain regions of 70-day-old qk and control mice. Finally, the behavioral effects of diazepam, of the mixed GABAA/GABAB receptor agonist progabide, and of the selective GABAB receptor agonist baclofen have been assessed in adult qk mutants. Our results strongly suggest a lack of involvement of GABAergic neurotransmission in the inherited epilepsy of the qk mutant mouse.", 
    "35": "The fat and protein composition of human milk changes dramatically in the first several weeks postpartum. In order to investigate the possible effect of this compositional change on the milk-to-plasma drug concentration ratio (M/P), the following experiment was performed. Milk samples were collected from five healthy lactating women on days 3, 5, 7, and 14 postpartum; blood samples were obtained on these days, as well as on day 1. Serum and skim milk unbound fractions (fp and fm, respectively) and the skim milk-to-whole milk drug concentration ratio (S/M) were determined in vitro in the above samples for diazepam, propranolol, and etretin, an aromatic retinoid. In addition, the composition of these milk and serum samples was also assessed. Using a previously proposed mathematical model for the distribution of drugs between milk and plasma, M/P was calculated from values for fm, fp, S/M, milk pH, and literature values for the pKa values of the compounds. The M/P was calculated for each subject on each day of sample collection. Total serum protein and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels increased in the first two weeks postpartum. Mean diazepam fp values fell from 0.020 to 0.014 during this period, while propranolol fp values changed inversely with serum AAG levels. Milk whey and total proteins decreased as lactation progressed, but changes in fat levels were not statistically significant. Calculated propranolol M/P increased during the study period, predominately due to changes in milk pH and propranolol S/M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "36": "The development of midazolam has been a nice addition to the list of drugs used for preprocedure or preoperative conscious sedation. Like other CNS depressants, it has potentially serious adverse effects, but with careful use, provides the practitioner with another drug useful for easing a patient through a difficult procedure or surgery.", 
    "37": "1. The cerebral topography of the action of diazepam and the action of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT3 receptor antagonists GR38032F and ICS 205-930 in attenuating an aversive response was studied in the mouse. 2. Mice which had been cannulated to allow drug injection into the dorsal and median raphe nuclei, the amygdala, nucleus accumbens or caudate-putamen were placed in a two compartment black (dimly illuminated) and white (brightly illuminated) test box. Measurements were made of the time spent, rearing and line crossings in the two sections and the latency of initial movement from the white to the black area. 3. The injection of diazepam (0.1-10 ng), GR38032F (0.01-1.0 ng) and ICS 205-930 (1.0-10 ng) into the dorsal raphe nucleus and amygdala, and the injection of diazepam (0.1-10 ng) into the median raphe nucleus, reduced an aversive response to the brightly illuminated white area, delaying the initial movement into the black section and increasing the time spent, rearings and line crossings in the white area. Concomitantly such activities were decreased in the black section. 4. The injection of the 5-HT3 agonist 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (0.1-10 ng) into the dorsal raphe nucleus and amygdala caused the opposite response, decreasing the time taken to move into the black section and increasing the time spent, rearings and line crossings in the black section, decreasing such activities in the white area. 5. The 5-HT3 agonist and antagonists showed little or no effect following injection into the median raphe nucleus and there were no changes in exploratory behaviour following their injection, or injection of diazepam, into the nucleus accumbens or caudate-putamen. 6. It is concluded that in the mouse the cerebral topography of action of GR38032F and ICS 205-930 in attenuating an aversive response follows that of diazepam in the dorsal raphe nucleus and amygdala but that diazepam may have additional effects mediated via the median raphe nucleus.", 
    "38": "In a double-blind randomized study, we compared the effects of the M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine and the nonselective antagonist ipratropium bromide on bronchoconstriction induced by inhaled sulfur dioxide (SO2) and methacholine in atopic volunteers. Both inhaled pirenzepine (70 micrograms) and ipratropium bromide (7 micrograms) significantly inhibited vagally mediated bronchoconstriction by SO2 to the same extent (p less than 0.02). However, at this dose, pirenzepine had no effect on methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction, whereas ipratropium bromide gave significant protection (p less than 0.02). This indicates that vagally mediated bronchoconstriction in humans can be inhibited by blockade of pirenzepine-sensitive (M1) muscarinic receptors probably present on a different site from muscarinic receptors at the neuromuscular junction and presumably localized to parasympathetic ganglia. Pirenzepine may be useful in investigating ganglionic function and could be beneficial therapeutically in airway disease.", 
    "39": "The effect of many intravenous sedative and hypnotic drugs on subcortical and early cortical evoked responses has been investigated by many authors. Because of the great inter- and intraindividual variabilities late cortical evoked components (EP) are thought to be unable to reflect the degree of anesthetic depth. However the impact of centrally acting anesthetic drugs on EP has not been thoroughly studied. The present study investigates the influence of midazolam and the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil on acoustical (AEP) and somatosensory (SEP) evoked cortical responses. In addition the following parameters were recorded: heart frequency, mean arterial blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation and in approximation the end-expiratory carbon dioxide tension. In 12 healthy volunteers (age: 25-36 y) the following combinations of drugs were given in several sessions: Midazolam-flumazenil, midazolam-ringer's solution, ringer's solution-flumazenil. In 6 subjects the study was performed according to a double blind placebo-controlled experimental protocol. Midazolam led to a suppression and a prolongation of latencies of components: N1/P2; P2/N2 (AEP); P100/N150; N150/P220 (SEP). Flumazenil (0.3 mg) led to a prompt restoration of all cortical components with however still reduced amplitudes compared to control. At the end of the observation period, 50 min after application of the second drug, EP-components did not differ significantly between the groups given midazolam-ringer's solution and midazolam-flumazenil. Flumazenil given alone had no significant effect on the AEP- and SEP-recordings, so no intrinsic activity of flumazenil could be substantiated.", 
    "40": "Patients who underwent peripheral arterial surgery had anaesthesia maintained with an infusion of midazolam. They were allowed either to recover spontaneously or to have the effects of midazolam reversed by flumazenil at the end of surgery. This study demonstrated that the cardiovascular responses to arousal using flumazenil are no different from those seen when the patient is allowed to recover in the normal way. This result has obvious advantages for clinical practice but the dangers of resedation must not be forgotten.", 
    "41": "This study evaluated recovery after a fixed dose of midazolam as induction agent and the influence of flumazenil on recovery parameters in patients undergoing day-case surgery (arthroscopy of the knee). In 40 unpremedicated patients, anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.2 mg/kg, vecuronium bromide 0.1 mg/kg intravenously and 3 vol.% isoflurane in oxygen prior to intubation. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 66% in oxygen and 0.9 vol.% isoflurane. Ten minutes after the end of anaesthesia 20 patients received 0.2 mg flumazenil intravenously, followed by increments of 0.1 mg at 60 s intervals until eye opening. Recovery was assessed by the time to eye-opening, to answering five set questions correctly, and to recovering ocular balance (Maddox Wing test), and by comparing pre- and postoperative performance in a pencil and paper test (the p-deletion test). With the exception of ocular balance, all parameters showed a quicker improvement without side-effects in the flumazenil group. After 4 h all patients were fit for discharge. One month after the procedure, all patients were satisfied with the anaesthesia. Full recovery took on average 1.5 days (range between 0 h-10 days). Whilst the technique employing a fixed dose of midazolam as induction agent gives satisfactory intraoperative anaesthesia for day-case arthroscopy, further improvement can be made with the use of flumazenil which hastens recovery.", 
    "42": "The present study was undertaken in order to establish whether muscarinic cholinergic receptors are involved in the anomalous GH response to GnRH in men with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in male patients with major depression. For this purpose, 16 male diabetics, 18 depressed men and 9 normal controls were tested with GnRH (25 micrograms iv) with and without previous treatment with the muscarinic cholinergic receptor blocker pirenzepine (40 mg iv 10 min before GnRH). Additional experiments with TRH (200 micrograms iv 10 min after pirenzepine) were performed in the same subjects and used for comparison between responders to TRH and GnRH. The administration of GnRH stimulated GH release in 12 out of the 16 diabetics and in 8 out of the 18 depressed patients, but not in the normal controls. Control and diabetic non-responders to GnRH did not respond to TRH. In contrast, all diabetic responders to GnRH, except 2, showed paradoxical GH responses to TRH. All depressed responders to GnRH and 3 of the non-responders, were responsive to TRH. The pattern and magnitude of the secretory responses to TRH and GnRH were similar in depressed and diabetic patients. When the effects of GnRH and TRH were restudied in the presence of pirenzepine, neither GnRH nor TRH enhanced the serum concentrations of GH in any patient. These data indicate that a muscarinic cholinergic mechanism is involved in the anomalous responses of GH to GnRH and TRH in diabetic men and in male patients affected by major depression.", 
    "43": "Experiments were carried out on 62 rabbits anesthetized with urethane and chloralose and immobilized with gallamine triethiodide under artificial ventilation. Ventricular extrasystoles were induced by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamic defence area (HVE). Following intravenous administration of diazepam (0.5 mg/kg), the pressor response and HVE induced by electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus were attenuated, as blood pressure (BP) dropped. Bilateral microinjection of flurazepam (200 micrograms in 0.5 microliters) or GABA (3 micrograms in 0.5 microliters) into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (rVLM) resulted in a significant decrease in BP, and pressor response during hypothalamic stimulation as well as reduction in the amount of HVE. Bilateral microinjection of picrotoxin (7.5 micrograms in 0.5 microliters) into the rVLM facilitated HVE and increased BP. Microinjection of flurazepam, GABA of the same doses into the caudal ventrolateral medulla (cVLM), however, had no such effect. The depressant effect of intravenous injection of diazepam could be prevented by bilateral microinjection of GABA receptor antagonist bicuculline (3 micrograms in 0.5 microliters) or picrotoxin (7.5 micrograms in 0.5 microliters) into the rVLM. Whereas bilateral microinjection of atropine (0.25 micrograms in 0.5 microliters), scopolamine (0.15 micrograms in 0.5 microliters), naloxone (0.5 micrograms in 0.5 microliters), strychnine (1 microgram in 0.5 microliters) into the rVLM no depressant effect was observed. These results suggest that the depressant effect of diazepam on BP, the pressor response and HVE may be mediated by activation of the GABA receptors in the rVLM.", 
    "44": "Because hypothermia and anorexia were previously found to be more sensitive indices of the effects of lindane than were convulsions, these endpoints were used to quantify the ability of benzodiazepines (BDs) and phenytoin either to ameliorate or exacerbate the toxicity of lindane in the rat. After administration of lindane (40 or 50 mg/kg) in oil per os, toxicity was counteracted by phenytoin and the \"central\" BD agonists diazepam and clonazepam, but was worsened by Ro 5-4864 a \"peripheral\" BD agonist. Clonazepam and diazepam were each more effective in counteracting lindane-induced anorexia than in stimulating food intake, presumably because the animals had been fasted and probably even controls ate maximally when food was presented. Diazepam alone (3 injections in 1 day) produced withdrawal-induced decreased food intake the following day. Clonazepam and diazepam alone each transiently decreased colonic temperature, yet effectively blocked the more severe hypothermia produced by lindane. Ro 5-4864 by itself did not produce any measurable effects, yet exacerbated all of the effects, including lethal effects, of lindane. The present findings are compatible with other evidence that lindane and Ro 5-4864 act at the picrotoxinin receptor of the GABAA-activated chloride channel and that systemic administration of agents acting at this site may produce a constellation of effects, including seizures, hypothermia and anorexia.", 
    "45": "The effects of AHN 086 and its reversibly acting structural analogue Ro 5-4864 were studied in the spontaneously beating guinea-pig atria and field-stimulated guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle in the presence and absence of dihydropyridine calcium channel modulators. The treatment of guinea-pig atria with AHN 086 followed by extensive washing did not alter contraction. However, AHN 086 (0.5 microM) potentiated (88%) the positive inotropic responses by BAY K 8644, an effect that was not reversed by extensive washing of the tissue. Higher concentrations of AHN 086 (greater than 2 microM) irreversibly inhibited the intropic, but not the chronotropic responses to BAY K 8644, nifedipine, and isoproterenol. Ro 5-4864 (10 microM) produced a reversible enhancement of the inotropic responses and block of the chronotropic responses to BAY K 8644. In guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle, both AHN 086 and Ro 5-4864 reversibly inhibited field-stimulated contractions. Neither Ro 5-4864 nor AHN 086 affected the ability of nifedipine to inhibit field-stimulated contractions of ileal longitudinal smooth muscle. Treatment of intact atrial with 5 microM AHN 086 followed by extensive washing resulted in a significant inhibition (30-50%) of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and of [3H]nitrendipine binding to voltage-operated calcium channels, but did not affect [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to beta-adrenergic receptors on atrial membranes. The same treatment applied to intact ileal longitudinal smooth muscle affected neither [3H] (-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarine receptors nor [3H]nitrendipine binding, but did result in a significant inhibition (30-50%) of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to ileal longitudinal smooth muscle membranes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "46": "The effects of PK 11195, a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (200 mg orally), of nicardipine (20 mg orally), of their combination, and of a placebo on brachial and carotid arteries, diameters, and flows were determined and compared over a period of 8 h after drug intake during a double-blind and cross-over study performed on six healthy volunteers. Simultaneously, plasma concentrations of both drugs were measured. PK 11195 significantly increased carotid and more markedly brachial arteries, flows (20 and 39%, respectively), and diameters (4 and 7%, respectively) and decreased forearm vascular resistance. Thus, PK 11195 preferentially affected the resistance vascular beds where it dilated both large arteries and arterioles. The intensity and duration of the peripheral vasodilating effects of PK 11195 were similar to those of nicardipine. Simultaneous administration of PK 11195 and nicardipine abolished almost all the peripheral vasodilating effects of both drugs. This finding, which was not related to a pharmacokinetic interaction between PK 11195 and nicardipine, demonstrates that in humans a functional antagonism develops between these two drugs at the vascular level.", 
    "47": "Forty-two healthy male patients (aged 19-40 years), undergoing orthopaedic surgery under spinal anaesthesia (3 ml isobaric 0.5% bupivacaine), were given clonidine 4.5 micrograms kg-1 orally either 2 (Group I, n = 10) or 4 (Group II, n = 10) hours before the operation, diazepam 0.15 mg kg-1 orally (Group III, n = 10) or a placebo tablet (Group IV, n = 12) 2 h before the operation. Plasma concentrations of cortisol, noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) were assayed from venous blood samples just before premedication and just before the spinal block. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cortisol, tryptophan, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and catecholamine metabolites were assayed from a sample taken before the spinal block. The plasma NA concentrations of the patients in the groups receiving clonidine decreased clearly compared with the other groups (P less than 0.05). The NA metabolite DHPG was also lower in Groups I and II than in Group III (P less than 0.05) after premedication. Plasma A concentrations were lower in Groups I and III than in Group IV (P less than 0.05). The CSF concentrations of the different substances were similar in all groups. In Group I the sensory blockade lasted significantly longer than in Group III (P less than 0.05) and the mean duration of motor blockade was longer in Group I than in Groups III and IV (P less than 0.05).

    "48": "The influence of cholinergic and noncholinergic inhibitory nerves was examined in circular and longitudinal muscle from the duodenum. Rodent proximal small intestine was cut into strips measuring 6.0 x 10.0 mm. Strips cut along the oral-caudal axis were called longitudinal strips, whereas those cut 90 degrees to that axis were called circular strips. The strips were stretched to their optimal lengths and subjected to electrical field stimulation in the presence of various concentrations of atropine, pirenzepine or McN-A-343-11. All three drugs inhibited field-stimulated contraction responses and produced or augmented relaxation responses in both muscle layers. All relaxation responses were abolished by tetrodotoxin, indicating they were due to excitation of inhibitory nerves. For each response examined atropine was significantly more potent than pirenzepine (relative potency ratio, 13.36-95.74). The inhibitory effect of McN-A-343-11 on longitudinal muscle was antagonized by both atropine and pirenzepine, indicating the recruitment of cholinergic inhibitory nerves. Neither atropine nor pirenzepine had any effects on inhibitory responses produced by McN-A-343-11 in circular muscle, indicating the recruitment of noncholinergic inhibitory nerves. McN-A-343-11 also increased spontaneous contraction amplitudes in both muscle layers by a direct (tetrodotoxin-resistant) effect on smooth muscle. This effect was also antagonized by atropine and pirenzepine. Thus, both cholinergic and noncholinergic nerves participate in inhibitory neuromuscular transmission in the small intestine. Circular muscle is dominated by a noncholinergic inhibitory innervation. Longitudinal muscle appears to be controlled by both cholinergic and noncholinergic inhibitory nerves.", 
    "49": "Topographic EEG changes with medazepam and diazepam in normals were analyzed by the computerized wave form recognition method. A principal component (PC) analysis, using such EEG elements as wave percent-time (8 bands) and average amplitude (7 bands), resulted in a considerable reduction of variables (4 PCs). In O1, because of high positive loadings in the average amplitude in all bands and a decrease in the mean score with either drug, PC-1 represents a component which reacts in the form of diminution of average amplitude as a whole. In Fp1, C3 and O1, PC-2, with a bipolarity of alpha 2 versus beta 1 and beta 2 in the wave percent-time in loading profile, could be a component showing characteristic changes common to the 2 benzodiazepines. In C3, because of a significant difference in the mean score between the 2 drugs, PC-4 might be a between-drug difference component in which diazepam (medazepam) increases (decreases) slow activity. The relationship between the score at PC-4 in C3 and daytime sleepiness may signify that the slow components are associated with sedation. Based on the correlation at PC-2 in Fp1, a marked increase in beta 1 and beta 2 components (responder) rather means less sleepiness, and relative preservation of alpha 1 and alpha 2 (non-responder) more sleepiness.", 
    "50": "Six polychlorinated convulsant insecticides that potently inhibit t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding to rat brain membranes also potentiate the protective effect of NaCl (200 mM) against heat inactivation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites on the same membranes. Similar effects were obtained with all \"cage\" convulsants tested. The rank order of potencies as heat protection potentiators was similar to the rank order of potencies as inhibitors of [35S]TBPS binding (alpha-endosulfan greater than endrin greater than dieldrin greater than toxaphene greater than lindane). alpha-Endosulfan and endrin are more potent in both respects than any previously reported picrotoxin-like (cage) convulsant, but are much less toxic to mammals. The greatly reduced toxicities of alpha-endosulfan and endrin in mammals may reflect partial gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-neutral properties of these compounds. Time courses of heat inactivation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the presence of 200 mM NaCl plus saturating concentrations of endrin or picrotoxin revealed monophasic components constituting about 88% of the binding sites, suggesting that virtually all [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites are coupled to picrotoxin binding sites in the GABA/benzodiazepine/picrotoxin receptor complex. Protection against heat inactivation constitutes a useful tool for characterizing the various allosterically linked binding sites in neurotransmitter receptor complexes.", 
    "51": "The possibility that excitatory and inhibitory inputs to neurons can affect the generation and degeneration of neuroarchitecture was examined in hippocampal pyramidal neurons in isolated cell culture. Dendritic outgrowth and cell survival were directly monitored in neurons exposed to: the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, the inhibitory transmitter GABA, anticonvulsants or combinations of these agents. Glutamate caused a graded series of changes in pyramidal neuron cytoarchitecture: a selective inhibition in dendritic outgrowth and dendritic pruning was observed with subtoxic levels of glutamate while cell death was induced by higher levels. Low levels of GABA alone or in combination with diazepam, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin were without effect on dendrite outgrowth while higher levels caused moderate reductions in outgrowth. Neither GABA nor the anticonvulsants affected cell survival. GABA plus diazepam, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and phenytoin each significantly reduced the dendritic regression and cell death normally caused by glutamate. Elevation of extracellular K+ to 50 mM caused dendritic regression and 100 mM K+ caused cell death; these effects were greatly reduced by GABA and anticonvulsants. The calcium channel blocker Co2+ prevented the dendritic regression and cell death caused by both glutamate and K+ indicating that calcium influx was required for the neuroarchitectural responses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that neurotransmitters and neuromodulatory drugs can have direct and interactive effects on both neurite outgrowth and cell survival. Such neurotransmitter actions may play roles in both the formation and degeneration of the neuronal circuits in which they participate in information coding.", 
    "52": "Depleting the mitochondrial matrix of divalent cations with the ionophore A23187 activates a pH-sensitive, anion uniport pathway which can transport many anions normally regarded as impermeant (Beavis, A. D., and Garlid, K. D. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 15085-15093). Addition of valinomycin to respiring mitochondria can also induce the uptake of a wide variety of anions; however, the mechanism of anion transport during this \"respiration-induced\" swelling is less certain. In this paper, I demonstrate that both of these processes are inhibited by a variety of cationic amphiphiles including propranolol, quinine, amiodarone, imipramine and amitriptyline, and the benzodiazepine R05-4864. Although the IC50 values for the two processes are not equal, the ratio of IC50 values for the two processes appears to be the same for all drugs. Measurements of net transmembrane proton fluxes that occur during the assays reveal that respiration-induced swelling is associated with extensive proton ejection, the peak of which coincides with the maximum rate of anion transport. Moreover, from measurements of matrix buffering power, it is estimated that the matrix pH is 3 units more alkaline during respiration-induced swelling than during A23187-induced swelling. It is also shown that the IC50 for A23187-induced transport is pH-dependent in a manner consistent with modulation of drug binding by protonation of two sites. These findings allow the difference in IC50 values for the two types of assay to be explained by the pH dependence of the binding constant for the drug. Furthermore, the pH gradient generated during respiration-induced swelling is so large that the electrical component of the proton-motive force will be negligible. Thus, despite the fact that the mitochondria are \"energized,\" rapid electrophoretic anion influx is possible. These data provide evidence that the transport of anions in these two types of assay occurs via the same pathway.",

Mixed intoxications dominated, especially combinations of benzodiazepines and alcohol. One patient died. Interpersonal conflicts were stated as the main reason for the self poisoning. Five patients were considered suicidal. 27 patients were followed up six months later. A majority considered both their social and mental situation to be better than at the time of the self poisoning episode, and had reduced consumption of alcohol and drugs.", 
    "54": "GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was used to investigate regional differences in response to chronic diazepam treatment by comparing cortical and cerebellar tissue from rats chronically treated with diazepam for 3 weeks. Using a treatment protocol which has previously been shown to produce behavioral tolerance and physical dependence, cortical membrane preparations from chronic diazepam-treated rats were found to exhibit a decreased responsiveness to the stimulation of 36Cl- influx by GABA and a corresponding decrease in the ability of flunitrazepam to enhance GABA-stimulated 36Cl-influx. This decrease in sensitivity to flunitrazepam, however, appears to reflect the underlying decrease in sensitivity to GABA. In contrast, in membrane vesicles prepared from cerebella of chronic diazepam-treated rats, there was no measurable effect on GABA-stimulated 36Cl--influx or on the enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx by flunitrazepam. These results support the suggestion that there is a regionally specific reduction in GABA/benzodiazepine receptor function following chronic benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "55": "The present report describes the effects of Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo-(1,5-a) (1,4)-benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) in the conflict test, on convulsions induced by isoniazid and DMCM (methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) and on the binding of [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) to rat brain membrane preparations. Ro 15-4513 produced a dose-dependent proconflict effect that was prevented by the administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788. In addition, Ro 15-4513 was not convulsant per se but enhanced the convulsions produced by isoniazid and completely blocked the convulsions induced by the full inverse agonist, DMCM. In vitro, Ro 15-4513, like ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE), antagonized the increase in [3H]GABA binding induced by diazepam. The results indicate that Ro 15-4513 is anxiogenic and interacts with benzodiazepine recognition sites as a partial inverse agonist.", 
    "56": "Muscarinic receptors of the M2 type have been studied in the rat brain using quantitative autoradiography with the selective ligand, [3H]AF-DX 116. High specific binding of [3H]AF-DX 116 was found in areas such as laminae IV and V of the parietal cerebral cortex, thalamus and hypothalamus and dentate gyrus. Intermediate [3H]AF-DX 116 binding was found in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, caudate-putamen, nucleus accumbens, and claustrum as well as in certain brainstem nuclei such as the nucleus of the solitary tract and the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagus. In contrast, the accessory olfactory nucleus, globus pallidus and cerebellum contained very low concentrations of M2 receptors. The present study demonstrates a unique regional distribution of M2 receptors in the rat brain.", 
    "57": "Bilateral microinjections (0.2-2 nmol/site) of a potent M2 muscarinic receptor agonist, cis-methyldioxolane (CD), but not those of a relatively selective M1 receptor agonist (McN-A343; 3 nmol/site), into the intermediate portion of nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) of pentobarbital-anesthetized rats elicited a decrease in blood pressure (23-52 mm Hg) and heart rate (16-50 bpm). Previous microinjections of a selective competitive M2 receptor antagonist (AFDX-116; 0.8 nmol/site), but not those of a potent selective M1 receptor antagonist (pirenzepine; 2 nmol/site), into the NTS blocked the effects of CD. These results indicate that the muscarinic receptors in the intermediate portion of NTS are of M2 type.", 
    "58": "In a double-blind comparative study, the therapeutic efficacy and safety of three centrally effective antispasmodics (Tetrazepam, Baclofen and Tizanidine) in patients suffering from multiple sclerosis with spastic motor disturbances of the lower extremities was to be examined. 47 patients of either sex at the age of 23 until 63 were allocated to one of the three therapies by means of minimization. The duration of treatment was limited to 35 days at a maximum. The dosage was optimized corresponding to the clinical symptoms. The antispasmodic efficacy and safety of the above-mentioned substances was investigated with well-established parameters and methods. The typical laboratory parameters were determined at the beginning and at the end of the study. -With reference to cloni, spasms and the muscular tonus, no systematic differences were found between the treatment groups. A previously existing clonus could not be altered decisively by the administration of the three antispasmodics, whereas the muscular tonus could comparably be decreased with all therapeutic measures. Statistically significant differences between the treatment groups were not observed. The patients of all three groups recorded a subjective sensation of relief with reference to the symptoms of spasms by the medication. As to the residual urinary volume, no relevant differences and alterations were determinated in the course of the treatment as well. With reference to undesired side effects quantitative and qualitative differences could be established, in which Tetrazepam showed the most favourable benefit/risk ratio.", 
    "59": "Live Tetrahymena cells bound 3H-diazepam specifically, as demonstrated by autoradiographic evidence of displacement of about 25% of labeled diazepam in the presence of a 1000-fold amount of cold diazepam. The 3H-diazepam bound to membrane preparations isolated from untreated (control) cells was not displaced by cold diazepam, whereas cells involved in primary interaction (imprinting) with diazepam showed amplification and specificity of diazepam binding in both in vivo (cell suspension) and in vitro (pellicle) systems, as well as displacement of bound label in the presence of 1000-fold cold diazepam. It appears that diazepam induced imprinting and, consequently, also the formation of specific receptors in Tetrahymena.", 
    "60": "The selectivity of Ro 15-4513 in reversing the actions of sedative-hypnotic drugs was examined. The motor impairment induced by i.p. administration of 1.8 g/kg of ethanol was partially reversed by doses of Ro 15-4513 ranging from 2-8 mg/kg. Antagonism of the similar effect induced by 20 mg/kg of pentobarbital was observed only at the 8 mg/kg dose of Ro 15-4513. Treatment with 4 mg/kg of Ro 15-4513 shifted the dose-effect curve for motor impairment by ethanol to the right but did not affect the corresponding curve for pentobarbital. Ro 15-4513 also increased the onset latency and shortened the duration of sleep time induced by ethanol but not by pentobarbital. Blood ethanol and pentobarbital levels measured at 32 min after drug administration were not affected by Ro 15-4513. The selectivity of Ro 15-4513 and the mechanism(s) underlying its proconvulsant effect in reversing the actions of ethanol are discussed.", 
    "61": "A double-blind, cross-over investigation undertaken of the bioaccessibility of diazepam in 12 healthy volunteers revealed that there is no significant difference as regards the bio-accessibility of diazepam administered as Valaxon or as Valium tablets. It is concluded that pharmokinetic studies such as this can provide important clinical information and are easy to carry out in a hospital department.", 
    "62": "An attempt was made at evaluating the usefulness of forced diuresis for the treatment of Phanodorm poisoning. Fifty two patients were examined, 40 of them with Reladorm (Polish trade name. Reladorm contains 100 mg of cyclobarbital and 10 mg of diazepam) poisoning and 12 with Cyclobarbitalum Calcium (Phanodorm) poisoning. The test group was selected out of those poisoned with barbiturates so that a homogeneous toxic agent would be involved and the impact that other toxins may have on the rate of metabolism and excretion eliminated. The elimination of drug from blood was compared with the elements determining ED intensity, such as i.v. fluid administration, primary infiltrate (clearance of endogenous creatinine), reabsorption in renal tubules and diuresis rate. No correlation was found which is an evidence that ED proves to be useless in the treatment of Phanodorm poisoning. The author suggests that in this type of poisoning supportive treatment should be undertaken according to daily fluid demand in relation to such factors as sex, age, body temperature, health conditions and contraindications due to the patient's general condition.", 
    "63": "It can be extremely difficult to interpret the results of experiments in which a treatment is found to antagonize the behavioural effects of a drug. This article discusses strategies that can be used to help identify the nature of the antagonism and examines what such experiments tell us about the mechanisms underlying the drug's behavioural effects. Examples are taken from research with both benzodiazepines and ethanol. It is suggested that behavioural studies using different strategies to reduce the effects of a drug will further enhance our understanding of the mechanisms mediating the drug's effects. Such studies will include comparisons between the effects of chronic drug exposure (tolerance studies), genetic manipulations, and pharmacological treatments.", 
    "64": "The pharmacological profile of the two 5-HT(3) (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor antagonists, the putative anxiolytics ICS 205-930 and GR38032F was compared with that of diazepam in four standard behavioural tests in rats. All the investigated drugs induced an anxiolytic effect in the passive avoidance test, having reduced the latency to re-enter the chamber previously associated with an inescapable footshock, and increased the time spent in that chamber. On the basis of the lowest effective dose, both ICS 205-930 and GR38032F were about 20 times more potent than diazepam, though the anxiolytic activity of either 5- HT(3) receptor antagonist was confined to a narrow dose range (ICS 205-930: 93.7-187.5 \u03bcg/ kg, GR38032F: 125-375 \u03bcg/kg), their higher doses having been ineffective. The anxiolytic effect of diazepam, but not of ICS 205-930, was abolished by flumazenil. In contrast to diazepam, neither ICS 205-930 nor GR38032F-both given in doses up to 20 mg/kg-showed any activity in the pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures, open field, and rota-rod tests. These results suggest that the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists may represent a new class of anxiolytic drugs devoid of anticonvulsant, sedative or muscle-relaxant properties, and that their anxi olytic activity is not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "65": "Benzodiazepine GABA-ionophore receptor complex ligands showed persistent modulation of the chloride ionophore, labeled by [(35)S]TBPS, even after receptor complex extensive purification. GABA caused inhibition of [(35)S]TBPS binding, while benzodiazepine agonists increased and benzodiazepine inverse agonists decreased the specific [(35)S]TBPS binding to the purified receptor. When GABA binding sites were occupied by the neurotransmitter benzodiazepine receptor agonists and antagonists reversed their effects clonazepam in fact inhibited and ?-carboline ethyl ester increased [(35)S]TBPS binding in the presence of GABA. The antagonist flumazenil showed no effect both in the presence or absence of GABA.", 
    "66": "Synaptosomal membranes were prepared from bovine retinas to measure both high- and low-affinity binding of [(3)H]muscimol which is displaceable by ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) under various buffering conditions using Tris-citrate (non-physiological) and Krebs-Ringer's bicarbonate (physiological) buffers. The maximum number of high- and low-affinity sites (B(max)) was found when the tissue was prepared and assayed in Tris-citrate; the lowest B(max) occurred when the tissue was prepared and assayed in Krebs. The apparent affinity (K(D)) for the high-affinity site showed a slight dependence on buffering conditions, whereas the K(D) for the low-affinity site did not. These data support the suggestion that physiological ions act to alter the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in vivo. Thus, the correlation of biochemical and electrophysiological data ought to reflect these observations.", 
    "67": "The involvement of a histidine residue in benzodiazepine binding is suggested by the decrease of Ro 15-1788 and flunitrazepam binding when pH is changed from 7.5 to 5.5. Diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivates the benzodiazepine binding site by modifying a histidine residue, as shown by its faster action at pH 7.5 than at pH 5.5. After a partial diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivation, the remaining Ro 15-1788 binding sites still have the same sensitivity to acid pH. No difference in the pH sensitivity of the Ro 15-1788 binding is observed between the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex. It is thus proposed that the histidine residue is present at every benzodiazepine binding site, be it either subtype I or II. The pure antagonists Ro 15-1788 and propyl-?-carboline-3-carboxylate protect, respectively, 36.2 and 1% of the benzodiazepine binding sites from diethyl pyrocarbonate inactivation, the full agonists flunitrazepam and diazepam provide, respectively, a 98.5 and a 46.5% protection and the full inverse agonists methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-?-carboline-3-carboxylate and methyl-?-carboline-3-carboxylate provide respectively, a 60 and an 11% protection. Data suggest that the histidine residue is absent from the propyl-?-carboline-3-carboxylate binding site, and that the ability of the compounds to protect the Bdz binding sites is not related to their agonist or inverse agonist potencies. The protections observed may be due to allosteric interactions between the Bdz and ?-carboline binding sites and the histidine residue.", 
    "68": "In a retrospective case control study, clinical features of postictal excitement following electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) were examined in 24 patients and 24 matched controls. The two groups did not differ in clinical outcome, degree of pretreatment agitation, anesthetic or succinylcholine dose, number of ECTs received, mean seizure duration, number of titrated treatments with subconvulsive stimulation, or type of EEG ending. Patients who became excited early in the treatment course rarely manifested this phenomenon at all subsequent treatments. Within the \"excited\" group, a minority of patients became excited following the first ECT, and only 34.3% of their treatments resulted in postictal excitement. It may not be necessary to routinely use postseizure benzodiazepines in patients who have once exhibited a postictal excitement.", 
    "69": "Lever-press responding of male Sprague-Dawley rats was maintained under a conflict procedure in which every tenth response produced both food and electric shock (punished responding); every thirtieth response produced only food in the presence of a separate stimulus. The benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, increased responding 4- to 6-fold. Buspirone and its structural analog, gepirone, only moderately and inconsistently increased responding (1.5- and 2-fold, respectively). The dopamine-2 (D-2) receptor antagonist, sulpiride, but not haloperidol had effects similar to buspirone. The D-1 antagonist SCH 23390 was not active. The non-selective serotonin (5HT) antagonists, cyproheptadine and methysergide, consistently increased responding 2-fold, but the 5HT-2 antagonists, ketanserin, pirenperone, ritanserin, R-56 413, and LY 53857 and the 5HT-1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, were inactive. In pigeons, serotonergic compounds have been shown to increase punished responding. The present results suggest that exploitation of this species difference may be helpful in evaluating new chemicals for novel anxiolytic activity and for investigation of their mechanisms of action.", 
    "70": "The present study examined the effects of acute and chronic treatment with the alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine on behavior in the Conditioned Suppression of Drinking (CSD) conflict paradigm, an animal model for the study of anti-anxiety treatments. In daily 10-min sessions, water-deprived rats were trained to drink from a tube which was occasionally electrified (0.25mA). Electrification was signalled by a tone. Within 3-4 weeks of 4 day/week CSD sessions, control (i.e. non-drug) CSD behavior had stabilized (approximately 40 shock/session and 11ml water/session). Acute treatment with clonidine across a range of doses (1.25-40\u00b5g/kg; 10-min pretreatment) did not exert an anti-conflict effect, with doses greater than 5\u00b5g/kg significantly depressing unpunished responding (i.e. water intake). Similarly, administration of a single dose of clonidine (40\u00b5g/kg) across a range of pretreatment times (10 to 120min) failed to increase punished responding. In contrast, chronic post-test treatment with clonidine (40\u00b5g/kg, twice daily for 18 weeks) resulted in a dramatic and time-dependent increase in punished responding, with a latency to onset of approximately 3-4 weeks. The response to an acute challenge with chlordiazepoxide (10mg/kg) or the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (4.0mg/kg) did not differ in chronic clonidine-versus saline-treated subjects, indicating that benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity had not been affected by this chronic clonidine treatment. An acute challenge with a low dose of clonidine (10\u00b5g/kg) decreased punished and unpunished responding in chronic clonidine- or saline-treated subjects. Finally, an acute challenge with the alpha-2-antagonist yohimbine (1.25mg/kg) failed to block the increase in punished responding associated with chronic clonidine treatment, indicating that the anti-conflict effect of this chronic post-test clonidine treatment was not the result of alpha-2-adrenoceptor activation at the time of CSD testing (i.e. not due to drug accumulation). Discontinuation of chronic clonidine treatment resulted in a decline to near saline-treated levels of punished responding over the course of 3 weeks of conflict testing. The relationship of these findings to the anti-anxiety effects of clonidine in humans are discussed.", 
    "71": "The anxiolytic drug buspirone and its structural analogues gepirone and ipsapirone produce behavioural effects which differ from those seen with benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Buspirone has been reported to disrupt active avoidance responding without interfering with the ability to escape the aversive stimuli, an effect usually associated with antipsychotic drugs. In the present study, buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone produced dose-related decreases in one-way, active avoidance responding of rats. However, these drugs did not consistently give rise to a within-session decline in avoidance responding as was seen with the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide. In a second experiment, buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone disrupted the performance of a passive avoidance response. Rats previously conditioned to remain on a raised platform to avoid shock stepped off the platform after injection of these drugs. A similar effect on the passive avoidance response was not produced by chlordiazepoxide; diazepam, CL 218, 872, haloperidol, imipramine or d-amphetamine. These disruptions of the performance of both active and passive avoidance indicate a unique pharmacological profile for buspirone and similar drugs.", 
    "72": "Benzodiazepines are currently the drugs of choice in the treatment of anxiety, and a specific response to benzodiazepines is the central feature of animal models of anxiety. However, the benzodiazepines, in addition to their anxiolytic properties, have a wide range of non-specific cerebral depressant effects. Conversely, numerous non-benzodiazepines have been used to relieve anxiety, and antidepressants are at least as effective as benzodiazepines in some anxiety states. Buspirone and certain other 5-HT receptor ligands also appear to be clinically active, but are relatively inactive in some of the animal models validated by their response to benzodiazepines.", 
    "73": "Effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93 426 were examined in two groups of rats with long lasting radial maze impairments caused by either ibotenic acid lesions to cholinergic forebrain projections or 28 weeks of alcohol treatment. Animals were trained on the 8-arm radial maze prior to ibotenic acid treatment or following chronic alcohol treatment. Spatial and associative working and reference memory were investigated in parallel. Lesioned rats showed high error rates in all aspects of memory, but particularly in spatial working memory, whilst error rates in alcohol-treated rats were low and uniform. ZK 93 426 improved performance in both experiments. In lesioned rats working memory errors were selectively decreased, in line with evidence that ZK 93 426 enhances attention. However in alcohol-treated rats both reference and working memory errors were reduced to control level, suggesting that these animals primarily showed a mild attentional deficit. Alcohol treatment and lesions were both found to reduce cortical choline acetyltransferase activity, but in view of the non-specificity of alcohol or ibotenic acid to cholinergic neurons and the wide distribution of the GABA-BZ receptor complex, interactions of ZK 93 426 with other systems cannot be ruled out.", 
    "74": "The present experiments further characterized intravenous self-administration of the short-acting benzodiazepine midazolam in rats under conditions of unlimited access to the drug. The results of the first experiment demonstrated that rats responded at higher rates on a lever that produced an infusion of 0.05mg midazolam than on a lever that did not result in reinforcement, and that they transferred responding to the other lever when the reinforcement contingencies were reversed. These results provide further evidence of the reinforcing effects of midazolam. In the second experiment, rats responding at stable rates for 0.05mg midazolam per infusion exhibited increased responding when transferred to a lower dose (0.0125mg/infusion) and decreased responding when transferred to a higher dose (0.20mg/infusion) of the drug. However, the inverse relationship between responding and drug dose was apparent only during the first transfer session, after which no consistent relationship was observed. In support of previous observations, all rats exhibited a temporal pattern of responding for midazolam over the 24h sessions, with maximal responding occurring during the dark phase of the 12h light/dark cycle. However, the present results also provide preliminary evidence that rats given prolonged access to midazolam (more than 49 days) develop a more constant within session pattern of responding for midazolam. This may be related to the development of physical dependence and reflect an attempt to avoid withdrawal effects by maintaining a stable intake of midazolam within a session.", 
    "75": "It has been argued that persistent avoidance behaviour is strongly influenced by safety signals, and that agoraphobic avoidance behaviour is a clinical example of this influence. It was proposed that agoraphobic avoidance can be reduced by the judicious use of safety signals, and specifically, by training patients to travel towards rather than away from safety. A safety-signal technique in which the patient travelled towards the therapist at the most fear-inducing situations was compared with conventional therapist-assisted exposure. In the second part of the treatment programme, both groups of agoraphobics were given homework assignments. The safety-signal technique resulted in slightly better clinical gains than those achieved by therapist assisted exposure, but after these relatively brief programmes, the improvements in both groups were weak. Global clinical outcome was influenced by age, chronicity and long-term benzodiazepine use.", 
    "76": "In this paper the authors report on two term-birth newborn infants who were exposed to long-term maternal treatment with benzodiazepines. They emphasize the free interval before the onset of respiratory pauses in these newborns, since triazolam is classified as belonging to the class of benzodiazepines with ultra-rapid elimination and especially the severity of these disorders.", 
    "77": "Literature data on mutagenic-carcinogenic activity of benzodiazepines are scarce, restricted to few of them, and contradictory. Consequently, in order to provide additional information for the assessment of the genotoxic risk connected with the use of this family of drugs, 32 benzodiazepines of various chemical structure have been tested for their capability to induce DNA damage in vivo, which is considered a sensitive index of potential mutagenic-carcinogenic activity. The frequency of DNA single-strand breaks and/or alkali-labile sites was checked in the liver of rats given orally a single dose (1 mmol/kg) or 15 successive daily doses (0.2 mmol/kg) by the use of a new viscometric technique capable of detecting one DNA lesion per 10(10) Da. Statistically significant changes of viscometric parameters indicative of liver DNA fragmentation were absent with all 32 benzodiazepines, after both acute and subacute treatments. Since the doses tested in rats were from 100 to more than 5000 times higher than doses usually administered to humans, these negative results are in favor of the absence of mutagenic-carcinogenic effects in patients taking benzodiazepines.", 
    "78": "Alprazolam, an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, has a pharmacologic profile similar to that of diazepam. An intermediate half-life of 10-12 hours and a comparatively brief duration of activity relative to other anxiolytic benzodiazepines justified evaluation of a 0.5-mg test dose in an anxious patient with chronic obstructive lung disease. Subjective indexes, breath-by-breath respiratory drive response to hypercapnia, and blood alprazolam concentrations were determined before and after dosing. Subjective testing included a visual analog dyspnea scale, the state anxiety inventory, and subjective feelings visual analog scales (represented by alertness, calmness, and level of contentment). After dosing, the patient was better able to tolerate the rebreathing study technique. Statistically significant improvements in dyspnea (t - 10.20; p 0.0005), anxiety (t - 45.85; p less than 0.0001), alertness (t - 13.04; p less than 0.0001), cententedness (t - 12.27; p less than 0.0001), and calmness (t - 8.05; p less than 0.0001) occurred after alprazolam administration. Drive to breathe, as determined by mouth occlusion pressure and minute ventilation, was not statistically different before and after dosing. No adverse effects were reported or observed. Further study is warranted.", 
    "79": "Postprandial pancreatic secretion results from the interaction of neural and hormonal factors but their contribution to the net postprandial secretion is unknown. Recent description of highly specific and potent cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists allows the determination of the physiological role of CCK in the postprandial pancreatic secretion. In six dogs with chronic pancreatic fistulae, the blockade of CCK receptors by non-peptidal agent (L-364,718) caused little change in basal pancreatic secretion, but decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) by about 60% the pancreatic protein response to meat feeding and virtually abolished the pancreatic responses to CCK-8 and bombesin. The pancreatic protein responses to pentagastrin, reaching about 37% of CCK maximum, was also significantly reduced but this effect was less pronounced than that observed in tests with CCK-8 or bombesin stimulation. In contrast, cholinergically stimulated pancreatic secretion, reaching about 40% of CCK maximum, was unaffected by L-364,718. Cholecystokinin antagonism also failed to affect the postprandial and bombesin induced increments in plasma CCK and gastrin concentrations, but significantly reduced the PP responses to CCK-8 bombesin and meat feeding possibly as a result of the removal of the CCK mediated release of PP. We conclude that CCK plays a crucial role in the mediation of the postprandial and bombesin induced pancreatic secretion and in the PP release.", 
    "80": "Midazolam is a new parenteral benzodiazepine premedication for endoscopy. Consecutive patients were randomized to receive either intravenous midazolam or diazepam as premedication for outpatient total colonoscopy by one endoscopist. Fifty-five patients received diazepam (0.15 mg/kg) and 50 received midazolam (0.07 mg/kg). Both patient and endoscopist were blind to the study drug used. The two groups were similar with respect to age, sex, and indication for colonoscopy. Patients were rated by the endoscopist for degree of cooperation, sedation, and pain during examination. There was significantly more oversedation in the midazolam group than in the diazepam group (p less than 0.05). Immediate procedure recall was less in midazolam patients (p less than 0.005), but on repeat interview the next day there was no difference between the two groups concerning recall of the endoscopy. There was no significant difference between the two groups in the incidence of arm pain. We conclude that in a clinical setting, midazolam does not appear to offer any significant advantage over diazepam, except for cost. Midazolam carries an increased risk of oversedation when it is administered on a milligram per kilogram basis and should instead be titrated individually.", 
    "81": "It is assumed that when anticonvulsants arrest seizure, there is rapid return of brain high energy phosphates and brain lactate to control values. To test this hypothesis, diazepam was administered to neonatal dogs during flurothyl-induced seizure. In vivo 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy disclosed that diazepam quickly arrested electrographic seizure and restored brain phosphocreatine and inorganic phosphate to baseline values. In contrast, in vivo 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic measurements showed that arrest of seizure with diazepam did not return brain lactate to control values. The sustained increase in cerebral blood flow and prolonged elevation of brain lactate, acetate, valine, and succinate in the postictal period indicate that metabolic recovery of the brain occurs over an extended period of time after the normalization of EEG, phosphocreatine, and brain pH.", 
    "82": "The steady-state intravenous pharmacokinetics of pirenzepine has been investigated in 57 subjects whose renal function ranged from normal to chronic failure requiring regular haemodialysis. Pirenzepine renal clearance, total clearance and terminal (dominant) half-life were found to be correlated with the creatinine clearance (CLCR), but this was not the case for the volume of distribution and the nonrenal clearance. The therapeutic regimen was well tolerated by all subjects. Haemodialysis did not significantly contribute to the elimination of pirenzepine. Dosage adjustment need only be considered in patients with CLCR less than 25 ml/min in order to reduce the frequency of minor side-effects.", 
    "83": "The steady-state intravenous pharmacokinetics of pirenzepine has been investigated in patients with chronic liver disease and others with combined chronic liver disease and renal insufficiency. The plasma clearance (CL) of Pirenzepine, steady-state plasma concentration Cmin(ss) and dominant half life t1/2 gamma were not significantly altered in the chronic liver disease group. In patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency, CL was reduced, t1/2 gamma was prolonged from 11.1 to 19.4 h and Cmin(ss) was elevated from 36 ng/ml to 66 ng/ml compared to healthy controls. Plasma concentrations remained in the therapeutic range and the dosage regimen was well tolerated. Adjustment of the dose of pirenzepine need be considered only in cases of severe impairment of both renal and hepatic elimination.", 
    "84": "The effects of daily administration for 8 days of 50 mg pipequaline, 10 mg diazepam and placebo were assessed in a double-blind cross-over study with 12 healthy volunteers. This study also tested for an interaction between the drugs and alcohol on the eighth day. Subjective ratings, psychomotor and memory performance were evaluated. Diazepam produced the typical pattern of changes, namely impairments in psychomotor performance and reductions in the retention of newly memorised information. In contrast, the effects of pipequaline were relatively minor. In general, neither drug potentiated the effects of alcohol on performance, only isolated instances of non-additive interactions occurring. Subjective reports revealed that whereas both active drugs increased feelings of calmness, this result was accomplished by pipequaline with considerably less drowsiness, no euphoria and a general absence of the adverse side effects of diazepam."
