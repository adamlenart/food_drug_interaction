Characteristic dose-response curves for acetylcholine showing greater negative inotropic response with dose were seen. Increasing AF-DX 116 concentrations reversed the negative inotropy of acetylcholine and, in fact, increased the inotropic response approximately 100% and 50% above the baseline contractile force in a dose-dependent manner in the guinea pig and rabbit, respectively. This increase in contractility following AF-DX 116 addition was not observed in rat atria. The capacity of AF-DX 116 to produce the positive inotropic response only occurred at concentrations above 1 x 10(-5) M. The positive inotropic response of AF-DX 116 was antagonized by dl-propranolol, which suggests that the administration of AF-DX 116 at higher concentrations may unmask the effect of norepinephrine released from underlying viable adrenergic terminals which exist in the left atria.", 
    "1": "During the past 20 years there has been a substantial increase in the data available on the prevalence and consequences of the use of drugs which are liable to abuse. The body of data is sufficiently scientific, comprehensive and global in scope to enable an overall profile of the use patterns of these drugs to be drawn in this review. The studies evaluated include those which surveyed populations of hundreds, thousands, or even more, covering a range of common drugs of abuse and using specified research methods. The data are summarised for North America, Europe, Asia and the West Pacific, Africa and South America. A complex picture has emerged, confounded by an array of factors, which this review does not address in detail, such as youth alienation, the changing role of women and the increasing sophistication of criminal networks. From a global perspective, the evidence reviewed from the various regions indicates that the use of drugs with liability for abuse is widespread and associated with public health and social problems of great magnitude. The major set of problems appears to be related to primary pattern drugs such as alcohol, nicotine, cannabis and the opioids. Cocaine may also be a worldwide threat in view of the problems it has created in some regions. Drug abuse usually starts in adolescence, and both sexes now appear to be involved where in the recent past it was predominantly men who were affected. The concurrent use of multiple substances is now becoming the modal pattern, and drug-related problems correlate with one another and with somatic, psychiatric and social pathology. Opioid use now tends to be via intravenous administration, and the doses of cannabis and cocaine base which are used are increasing. Substances with therapeutic effects on DSM-III-R diagnosable disorders, such as antidepressants and benzodiazepines, require careful consideration by policymakers because the risk:benefit ratio is different to that of primary-pattern intoxicants, especially taking into consideration the broad and proven therapeutic use of these substances and the need for their availability for patients and physicians. In conclusion, the data presented in this review indicate that the scientific description of trends and consequences of drug abuse is an indispensable first step in rational policy making. The review also identifies areas for further study and research.", 
    "2": "Radioligand binding was conducted on airways of the rat and human, surgically subdivided into trachea, lung airways, and parenchyma. 3H-QNB bound uniformly to receptors in separate sections of the rat and human airway. Receptor densities generally were ranked: lung airways greater than trachea greater than parenchyma. Receptor subtypes were identified mostly by pirenzepine displacement of bound 3H-QNB. The rat trachea, and rat and human lung airways had a uniformly low affinity for pirenzepine while rat and human parenchyma demonstrated both high and low affinity pirenzepine binding. Inhibition of methacholine-stimulated smooth muscle contraction by the M1 receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, and M2 receptor antagonist, gallamine, was studied in rat trachea and bronchus in vitro. Schild plot pA2 values were compatible with low potency antagonism, thereby favoring the presence of M3 receptors at these smooth muscle sites. Reserpine treatment of rats (0.5 mg kg-1 day-1 for 7 days) produced a decrease in peak tension in response to methacholine without changing the muscarinic receptor character (Kd 3H-QNB), population density (Bmax in fmol mg-1 protein), or function (methacholine EC50). These results indicate that muscarinic receptor heterogeneity exists in the airway of both laboratory rat and man. While the muscarinic receptor subserving airway smooth muscle contraction appears to be the M3 subtype, decreased contractile responses to methacholine by trachea and bronchus from reserpine-treated rats were receptor independent.", 
    "3": "On individual placement in a cage with 20 evenly spaced glass marbles, female MF1 mice buried 7.8 +/- 0.2 marbles. Olfactory stimuli from experimenters hands and sex of mice had no influence on number buried, but most marbles were buried when they were evenly spaced. There was no habituation to these novel objects on serial testing or prehousing with marbles and, in a two-compartment box, mice did not avoid marbles, spending half their time on the marble side. In the pharmacological experiments, locomotor activity was measured separately to indicate the possibility of nonspecific effects. The anxiogenic agents yohimbine and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) did not enhance burying, yohimbine decreased burying at doses also reducing locomotor activity. Diazepam effects depended on dose: 0.1 mg/kg increased burying, 0.25 mg/kg had no effect and 1.0-5.0 mg/kg reduced it. Diazepam increased locomotor activity from 0.1-2.5 mg/kg and had no effect at 5.0 mg/kg. Zimeldine, 10.0 mg/kg, reduced burying but not locomotor activity. Inhibition of marble burying may be a correlational model for detection of anxiolytics rather than an isomorphic model of anxiety.", 
    "4": "The opiate antagonist, naloxone, has been reported to attenuate the loss of behavioural inhibition produced by benzodiazepines in tasks involving punishment and nonreward. This has led to suggestions that endogenous opioid systems may be involved in the anxiolytic actions of the benzodiazepines. However, the capacity of naloxone to block the effects of benzodiazepines depends on the behavioural schedule used. We tested the effects of naloxone and chlordiazepoxide on acquisition and performance of a signalled punishment schedule. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg IP) increased both punished and unpunished responding during acquisition and unpunished responding during performance of the conflict schedule. Naloxone (3 mg/kg IP) was essentially without effect on responding and failed to attenuate the punishment-releasing effects of chlordiazepoxide. The failure of naloxone and chlordiazepoxide to interact during acquisition of this punishment schedule is similar to results we obtained with successive discrimination and is in contrast to our findings with a differential reinforcement of low rates schedule. These results are consistent with the view that benzodiazepines reduce behavioural inhibition through two separate routes; that one of these routes depends on the release of endogenous opiates; and that the predominant route depends on schedule parameters.", 
    "5": "To determine the type of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor that mediates the inhibitory effects of peripherally administered CCK-8 on food intake and activity in 9- to 12-day-old rat pups, we gave injections of a type-A CCK receptor antagonist, MK-329, or of the type-B CCK receptor antagonist, L-365,260, prior to CCK-8 (IP). MK-329 reversed the inhibitory effects of CCK-8, but L-365,260 did not. This demonstrates that the inhibitory effects of CCK-8 (IP) are mediated by type-A, but not type-B, CCK receptors in pups of this age.", 
    "6": "1. The relationship between plasma flunitrazepam concentrations and the degree of sedation was evaluated in 20 healthy subjects receiving two single oral doses of 1 mg flunitrazepam on two different occasions (1 week apart). The degree of sedation was rated blindly during the two treatment sessions in parallel with blood sampling (48 h). 2. A strong correlation between the concentrations of flunitrazepam in plasma and the degree of sedation was found according to the sigmoid Emax model. The plasma drug concentration producing 50% of maximal effect (EC50) was found to be 7.0 and 6.5 ng ml-1 on the two occasions, respectively. The variability in EC50 between subjects was larger (C.V. 39%) than the variability within subjects (C.V. 27%). 3. The steepness of the concentration-response curve as reflected in the slope factor(s) showed a virtual 'all or none' response to flunitrazepam with s values ranging from 3 to 30 with a mean of about 14. 4. The results in young healthy subjects suggest that the present dosage recommendations for temporary insomnia (1-2 mg) may be inappropriate; the dose can probably be reduced to 0.5 mg in some patients to achieve moderate sedation.", 
    "7": "The enhancement of model hydrophilic (propranolol hydrochloride) and lipophilic (diazepam) drug penetration across rat and hairless mouse skin in vitro has been studied. Preliminary experiments established that most n-alkanes having chain lengths of between 7 and 16 promote the flux of both drugs. For propranolol, enhancement varied parabolically with carbon number; for diazepam, heptane was ineffective and all others were essentially equipotent. Enhancement by n-nonane was then compared with that by n-nonanol. Propranolol flux was increased by both enhancers, whereas diazepam penetration was not affected by the less lipophilic alcohol. The enhancement of propranolol by n-nonane and n-nonanol was examined as a function of adjuvant concentration in the applied formulation. Maximum increases in maximum penetration rates of 6.5-fold (n-nonane) and 8.2-fold (n-nonanol) were determined. As expected, the enhancement was saturable, indicative of a maximally perturbed stratum corneum. Finally, the penetration enhancing abilities of six monoterpenes were assessed. The purely hydrocarbon analogues promoted both propranolol and diazepam transport to an extent similar to that of n-nonane. The terpenes with hydrogen-bonding ability, however, only enhanced propranolol flux (at a level comparable to n-nonanol). While the data reported do not directly reveal mechanistic information on percutaneous penetration enhancement, they do provide a starting point for the rational investigation of interrelationships between drug, enhancer, and skin. Such information is clearly essential for the optimization and exploitation of transdermal drug delivery.", 
    "8": "The effects of partial denervation, partial denervation with additional nervous blockade with bupivacaine, and total denervation achieved by amputation and replantation of the ear on traumatic vasospasm were studied in the rabbit. The central ear artery was exposed and compressed in a standardized fashion. The inner diameter was determined by in vivo microscopy using transillumination with cold light. The resulting spasm was assessed in terms of its duration, intensity (reduction of initial diameter), and severity (integrated change in diameter over time). None of the types of denervation had any influence on the vasospasm. The results suggest that the vasospasm is a local phenomenon of the vascular smooth muscle and is not modified by the nervous system.", 
    "9": "Heavy i.v. sedation is often used in upper GI endoscopy. Sedation, however, creates the need for recovery facilities and precludes patients from returning to their normal daily activities. This is undesirable, since endoscopy is routinely performed as an out-patient procedure. Also the cost for medication and recovery facilities militate against the indiscriminate use of i.v. sedative premedication. The present study was undertaken in an attempt to establish what proportion of patients can benefit from oral premedication, and whether such an administration route can eliminate some of the disadvantages associated with i.v. sedation. Four hundred out-patients were randomized to receive orally either triazolam, 0.125 mg, or placebo. Of the patients, 359 were evaluable; 177 received placebo and 182 triazolam. All major aspects of the procedure were covered using visual analogue scale questionnaires for the endoscopist and patient. There were no differences in endoscopic experience, or sex and age distribution between the groups. Triazolam reduced patient discomfort, 38.6 +/- 25.6 vs 44.8 +/- 30.1 (p = 0.0379). Recollection of post-endoscopy information was the same in both groups. One patient complained of drowsiness following the procedure. No patient needed to stay in hospital to complete recovery. Endoscopy quality was identical in the two groups. Oral premedication has the potential to be of significant value, may optimize the use of endoscopy resources, and does not impair patient activities post-endoscopy.", 
    "10": "In a random group of medical examiner cases, muscle tissue, as well as blood and vitreous humor, was analyzed for ethyl alcohol, and the results were compared. When the blood concentration was greater than 0.10 g/dL, the muscle to blood ratio was 1.00 or less (average 0.94), and when the blood concentration was less than 0.10 g/dL, this ratio was greater than 1.00 (average 1.48). The author proposes that this ratio is dependent upon the time course of absorption and distribution, as has been observed for vitreous humor, but with a more rapid equilibration. Muscle tissue was also analyzed in another group of cases found to be positive for one or more drugs in blood. The concentrations of the drugs in muscle varied from none detected to 6.5 times those in blood and seemed to be dependent on the time course between ingestion and death, as well as on the nature of the drug. For most common basic drugs, the ratios were often near unity. Muscle is proposed as a useful alternative specimen to postmortem blood.",

The overall quality of intraoperative sedation was similar in the two sedative treatment groups. Although midazolam produced less pain on injection and more effective intraoperative amnesia, use of propofol was associated with less postoperative sedation, drowsiness, confusion, clumsiness, and amnesia, as well as more rapid recovery of cognitive function.

It antagonizes the sedative-hypnotic, anticonvulsive, anxiolytic and the muscle-relaxant effects of benzodiazepines. Its efficacy is prompt and complete. In several studies rebound phenomena have been observed. It was the aim of this randomized double blind study to investigate the efficacy of flumazenil by psychometric tests. The psychometric parameters we used were cognition and choice reaction time of 12 young and healthy volunteers. Three medication groups (A, B and C) were formed for this investigation. In a cross over design all volunteers had to be treated in each of these three medication groups. Between the groups we set a test-free interval of 7 days for every volunteer. In medication group A (midazolam/flumazenil) we applied 15 mg midazolam. Reversion was performed after 60 min with 0.5 mg flumazenil. In medication group B (placebo/flumazenil) midazolam was replaced by a physiological solution of sodium chloride. In medication group C (placebo/placebo) midazolam and flumazenil were substituted by a physiological solution of sodium chloride. For the investigation of the psychometric parameters (cognition and choice reaction time) we used the so called syndrome kurz test (SKT) and the decision reaction time measuring instrument (\"Entscheidungs-Reaktionszeit-Messger\u00e4t\"; ERM). Psychometric investigations were performed in all groups at intervals of 5, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180 and 240 min. Our results show that cognitive abilities remain impaired up to 60 min after the administration of flumazenil. Decision time and choice reaction time improved 120 min after administration of the antagonist. In our investigation neither rebound phenomena nor agonistic reactions of flumazenil were observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Pregnant mice were administered cocaine hydrochloride at 10 and 20 mg/kg body weight intravenously (tail), and/or diazepam at 20 or 40 mg/kg b.w. by gavage. Combinations of diazepam and cocaine (20/10 and 40/20, respectively) were used. Significant reductions of fetal weight and length were found in the group treated with diazepam and cocaine (40/20). The incidences of incomplete ossification of sternebrae and skull bones, as well as delayed ossification of the paws, were significantly increased in the combination groups. Hydronephrosis and cryptorchidism were observed in the cocaine-treated groups, with the incidence of these malformations increasing significantly when diazepam was co-administered.", 
    "21": "The effects on memory, psychomotor functions and mood of intramuscular scopolamine (0.3 mg, 0.6 mg) were compared with those of oral lorazepam (2 mg) and placebo. Thirty-six volunteers took part in a double-blind, independent groups design. Subjects completed a battery of tests 1 and 3 h after drug administration. Both doses of scopolamine produced levels of sedation comparable to that produced by lorazepam. The time course of effects of scopolamine and lorazepam differed but the pattern of psychomotor impairments and amnestic effects produced was very similar. In terms of mood, lorazepam had an anxiolytic effect whereas scopolamine increased ratings of anxiety. Levels of sedation, indexed by either subjective ratings or motor retardation (tapping speed), were related more to psychomotor performance than to performance on memory tasks. The results suggest that benzodiazepines and scopolamine have similar amnestic and sedative effects and as such may not offer distinct models of memory dysfunction.",

We observed five patients who had the typical findings of orthostatic tremor but had a wide range of frequencies. All five also had postural hand tremor and a family history of essential tremor, suggesting a relationship between orthostatic tremor and essential tremor. This report also emphasizes the association of orthostatic tremor with painful cramps and a relatively consistent improvement with clonazepam.", 
    "24": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is characterized by progressive, usually symmetric rigidity of the axial muscles with superimposed painful spasms precipitated by tactile stimuli, passive stretch, volitional movement of affected or unaffected muscles, startling noises, and emotional stimuli. Electromyography demonstrates continuous normal motor unit potentials in the affected muscles. Both the rigidity and the spasms are relieved by sleep, general anesthesia, myoneural blockade, peripheral nerve blockade, and partially by diazepam. Evidence for an autoimmune etiology of SPS includes its association with other autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies and the presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of many affected patients. We describe two patients with this syndrome who had GAD antibodies in both CSF and serum. Partial relief of the symptoms in these patients by corticosteroid therapy provides additional evidence of an autoimmune etiology of SPS and of the role of immunotherapy in its treatment.",

In highly emetogenic (HE) regimen (including platinum) patients received MTC 1 mg/kg or ALZ 3 mg/kg x 4 doses, and lorazepam 2.5 mg 30 min before therapy. In moderately emetogenic (ME) regimen patients received MTC 0.5 mg/kg or ALZ 1.5 mg kg x 3 doses, and lorazepam 2.5 mg 30 min before therapy. In both HE and ME regimen groups there was no statistically significant difference between MTC + L and ALZ + L treatments as regards the number of vomiting episodes, the duration of emesis and nausea, the intensity of nausea and side effects, but a statistically significant difference between treatments was found in the HE group where MTC-L was superior to ALZ + L in obtaining complete protection from vomiting (37 vs 11%, p = 0.05). No significant difference in side effects was observed.",

Both formulations provided anxiolysis and sedation, but there was wide variation in plasma concentrations of temazepam between individuals and between formulations. The presence or absence of anxiety did not influence the absorption of the preparations. It is suggested that plasma concentrations in excess of 200 ng ml-1 are required for sedation and anxiolysis, and that this may be achieved more reliably using the elixir formulation.", 
    "30": "This study examined the interaction between i.v. administered midazolam and thiopentone on the loss of response to verbal command (\"hypnosis\") and the loss of response to transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the ulnar nerve (\"anaesthesia\") in patients presenting for minor elective surgery. Dose-response curves for thiopentone and midazolam individually and in combination were determined using the two end-points in 300 unpremedicated patients. For hypnosis a highly significant (P less than 0.001) supra-addictive (synergistic) interaction was found, the combination having 1.8 times the expected potency of the individual agents. Although midazolam failed to produce anaesthesia in the dose range used, the dose of thiopentone required to produce anaesthesia was reduced by 50% in the presence of midazolam. The mechanism of interaction and the potential role of benzodiazepine-barbiturate combinations are discussed and the observed synergistic anaesthesia interaction is used to explain the potentially dangerous combination of benzodiazepines with other potent CNS depressants such as barbiturates and alcohol.", 
    "31": "The effect of diazepam (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) on the acquisition and retention of place learning was evaluated. The analysis of escape latencies indicates that 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg diazepam significantly impaired the retention of spatial information. When a free swim trial was carried out only control animals showed spatial bias to the target quadrant. The absence of spatial bias in the group that received 0.3 mg/kg suggests that the amnesic effect of diazepam can be seen at doses similar to or even lower than the anxiolytic ones, and that the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex is highly sensitive to the cognitive impairment induced by diazepam in spatial tasks.", 
    "32": "Rats were exposed to an open field with flashing light (OFL; 60-W lamp, 30 Hz, for 7 min) 2 h after training and/or 2 h before testing in a two-way active avoidance task (30 trials, 0.5-mA footshock). Post-training OFL presentation caused retroactive interference, i.e., a retrieval impairment/amnesia for the avoidance task. Pretest OFL exposure reversed the post-training OFL-induced retrieval deficit. Diazepam (2.0 mg/kg), atropine (2.0 mg/kg), and methylatropine (0.1 mg/kg) administered before post-training OFL presentation blocked the OFL amnesic effect. However, these drugs did not counteract the pretest OFL-induced recovery of retrieval. Atropine and methylatropine administered 2 h before testing to rats receiving only post-training OFL presentation canceled the OFL-interfering effect. These results suggest: (1) that the amnesic effect of post-training OFL is due to failure of retrieval of the avoidance task, (2) that the reversal of this retrieval impairment by pretest OFL exposure may involve either priming or state-dependent mechanisms, and (3) that there are different modulatory mechanisms involved in post-training and pretest OFL effects.", 
    "33": "A case history of a patient who developed severe anxiety and agitation on two occasions after discontinuation of a midazolam infusion is presented.

    "34": "It has been recognized for many years that central cholinergic neurons are susceptible to inhibition by opiates and that during withdrawal their firing rates are enhanced. Nevertheless, classical nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonists have not been demonstrated to provide consistent inhibition of withdrawal symptoms in humans or in animal models. The purpose of this study was to determine whether selective blockade of central M1 or M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes could provide inhibition of naloxone precipitated withdrawal symptoms in morphine dependent rats. As with earlier human studies, both cardiovascular and behavioral measures of withdrawal were quantitated. The selective M2 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP was significantly more effective than the M1 antagonist pirenzepine in reducing both cardiovascular and behavioral symptoms. These results are consistent with a role for cholinergic neurons in the expression of certain morphine withdrawal symptoms and suggest that future therapies might be targeted towards central M2 receptors.", 
    "35": "This study was designed to document possible changes in bupivacaine kinetics in serum and in heart and brain tissues induced by a pretreatment with diazepam in mice.

    "36": "There is accumulating evidence that benzodiazepines (BZD)--agents widely used as anxiolytics and hypnotics-could be regarded as \"natural\" drugs since they have been found in trace amounts also in plants, various tissues of different animal species and even humans. The biosynthesis of such BZD is still unknown and the hypothesis is favoured that they may be of plant origin. Besides diazepam (D) and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DD) several other BZD (e.g. delorazepam, deschloro-diazepam, delormetazepam, isodiazepam, lormetazepam, oxazepam) could be detected. In some cases identification of these compounds was accomplished by specific mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and for quantification various methods have been applied resulting in different concentrations which range for D from about 0.005 to 1 ng/g and for DD from 0.01 to 0.5 ng/g. It is very unlikely that these trace amounts exert any direct pharmacological effects and at the moment only speculations upon their physiological/biological role are possible. Recently BZD-receptor binding activity equivalent to surprisingly high levels of more than 900 ng/ml was found in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with advanced hepatic encephalopathy. As long as the structure of this binding activity has not been elucidated no firm conclusions can be drawn from these findings. If pertinent analytical problems (e.g. drug-free biological material; exact quantification by internal standard techniques) are solved and if the source(s) of BZD are established it might be possible to answer also the critical question whether \"endogenous\" or \"natural\" BZD play any (in-) direct role in the regulation of CNS activity.", 
    "37": "A postal questionnaire inquiring about routine sedation and premedication practice for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was sent to 1048 doctors. Of 665 appropriate returns, 81% were from consultant physicians and surgeons. Most endoscopists (90%) reported using an intravenous benzodiazepine for at least three quarters of endoscopies and 54% of physicians and 69% of surgeons always did so. Midazolam was the intravenous sedative used by a third of all respondents and 13% also used an additional intravenous agent, usually pethidine. Over the previous two years a total of 119 respiratory arrests, 37 cardiac arrests, and 52 deaths were identified. Adverse outcomes were reported more frequently by consultant physicians, by those who 'titrated' the intravenous sedative, and by those who used an additional intravenous agent, but were reported equally frequently by endoscopists using midazolam and endoscopists using diazepam. There is an urgent need for a prospective study to identify the circumstances and risk factors associated with adverse outcomes related to endoscopy.", 
    "38": "This study was performed to compare the incidence of bleeding associated with two anaesthetic techniques during otolaryngological microsurgery. Twenty-eight venous interpositions for otospongiosis have been carried out at random either under local anaesthesia combined with light sedation (midazolam 0.1 mg.kg-1 and alfentanil 0 micrograms.kg-1) or using general anaesthesia (propofol 2.5 mg.kg-1, then 9 mg.kg-1.hr-1 and alfentanil 30 micrograms.kg-1, then 15 micrograms.kg-1). The patients' lungs were mechanically ventilated. Every ten minutes, heart rate, arterial blood pressure and FETCO2 were observed. Bleeding was assessed on a four-point scale and evaluated according to its duration and the annoyance that it caused. General anaesthesia was clinically better tolerated. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were lower than with general anaesthesia. The end-expiratory CO2 was 4.7 +/- 0.2 per cent. Bleeding was less frequent, lasted less time, but when it occurred the surgical disturbance was identical in the two groups. General anaesthesia produced a less bloody operating field and local anaesthesia required the cooperation of the patient.", 
    "39": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABAA agonists enhance stimulated release of [3H]norepinephrine [( 3H]NA) in several regions of the rat brain. In this study, the mechanisms by which GABA and GABAergic agonists augment potassium-stimulated release of [3H]NA from rat frontal cortical slices were examined. GABA enhanced potassium-stimulated [3H]NA release, but did not alter release of [3H]NA evoked by the calcium ionophore A23187, 10(-5) M, either in the presence or the absence of extracellular calcium. The effect of GABA on potassium-stimulated [3H]NA release was apparently reduced by the GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide, 10(-4) M, and by the selective inhibitor of GABA uptake SKF 89976A, 10(-5) M, but was abolished only when bicuculline methiodide and SKF 89976A were present in combination. The GABAA agonist muscimol enhanced potassium-stimulated release of [3H]NA in a manner similar to GABA. In addition, nipecotic acid, a substrate for GABA uptake, enhanced potassium-stimulated [3H]NA release. Thus, GABA appears to enhance potassium-stimulated [3H]NA release by acting upon both GABA uptake and GABAA receptors. The GABAA receptors involved in this effect may be a subtype of GABAA receptors since they are not modulated by benzodiazepines. These results support the involvement of the GABA uptake carrier and the GABAA receptor in mediating the enhancement by GABA of potassium-stimulated [3H]NA release in the cortex of the rat.", 
    "40": "The effects of reversal of flunitrazepam-induced sedation with flumazenil on coronary hemodynamics, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and left ventricular (LV) performance were investigated, in a double-blind trial, in 12 patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization. Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by continuous thermodilution. Arterial and coronary sinus blood were analyzed for oxygen and lactate contents. The determinants of LV performance were obtained from the cardiac output measured by thermodilution and from left heart catheterization data. To reverse flunitrazepam-induced sedation, patients were randomly allocated to receive placebo or flumazenil (by increment, up to 1 mg) at the end of procedure. In the placebo group, no significant hemodynamic changes were observed. In the flumazenil group, heart rate, cardiac index, maximum velocity of shortening, and relaxation time constant were not significantly altered. By contrast, mean aortic pressure and LV end-diastolic pressure (baselines: 90 +/- 5 and 7.3 +/- 4.1 mmHg, respectively) increased (9%, P less than 0.05 and 67%, P less than 0.05, respectively) after flumazenil administration, but these changes represented mainly a return toward presedation values. MVO2 and coronary resistance were not significantly altered, whereas CSBF increased slightly (baseline: 119 +/- 20 ml/min; increase 10%, P less than 0.05). No electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia was observed during the study. These data show that reversal of benzodiazepine effects with flumazenil is not associated with a major alteration of LV systolic function, relaxation, or coronary hemodynamics in patients with coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, it should be cautiously used when LV end-diastolic pressure is increased at the time of its administration.", 
    "41": "The effectiveness of oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) as preanesthetic medication was compared with oral meperidine, diazepam, and atropine (MDA) in 40 pediatric patients scheduled to undergo repair of congenital heart defects. In a double-blinded manner, patients received a fentanyl lollipop (20-25 micrograms/kg) and a placebo oral solution (0.4 ml/kg) (n = 20) or a placebo lollipop and an oral solution (0.4 ml/kg) of meperidine (1.5 mg/kg), diazepam (0.2 mg/kg), and atropine (0.02 mg/kg) (n = 20). The patient's vital signs, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), as well as activity and apprehension scores were evaluated and recorded at baseline and at 10-min intervals. The patient's emotional status at the time of parental separation and at induction of anesthesia were also assessed. Side effects and onset of action were observed. After OTFC, onset of sedation was significantly faster than with the oral solution of meperidine, diazepam, and atropine. In both groups there was no significant change in heart rate. Although systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and respiratory rate showed statistically significant decreases, these changes were not clinically significant. The child's emotional status at the time of separation from the parents and during induction was similar in both groups. Side effects with OTFC were more frequent: nose itching occurred in 65%, body itching in 10%, and vomiting in 30%. Two patients (10%) in the OTFC-treated group became hypoxemic (SpO2 less than 90) and required supplemental oxygen. In the group receiving oral meperidine, diazepam, and atropine, 10% had mild facial pruritus and 5% complained of a dry mouth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "42": "Muscarinic stimulation of mucus secretion, as measured by the release of [3H]glycoprotein, was studied in explants from the tracheal epithelium of weanling swine. The mucus glycoprotein secretion was transient, ceasing within the first 10 min of a continuous exposure to 100 microM ACh. Increasing the solution's osmotic pressure did not alter basal mucus glycoprotein secretion. Mucus glycoprotein secretion was inhibited by 2-10 microM PZP, indicating that the M3 muscarinic receptors mediate cholinergic stimulation of mucus production.", 
    "43": "Five children with epilepsy with \"continuous spike-waves during slow sleep\" (CSWS) are reported. The main clinical features of CSWS include (a) onset between 5 and 7 years of age, (b) the occurrence of several types of seizure (i.e., partial motor, generalized motor, and atypical absence), and (c) the presence of language disturbances and abnormal behavior based on emotional impairment. The EEG findings were characterized by sleep tracings showing almost continuous (greater than 95%), diffuse slow spike and wave activity. After treatment with valproate (VPA) (or ethosuximide, ESM) and clonazepam (CZP), the spike and wave complex status disappeared. Symptoms and signs of the CSWS also decreased. We suggest that combined treatment is an appropriate treatment for CSWS.", 
    "44": "This paper presents the main issues in the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric sequelae in torture victims. The concept of post traumatic stress disorder is used to organize literature on psychiatric casualties resulting from massive psychic trauma, e.g., the Nazi Holocaust, the Vietnam and Israeli wars, and the current world epidemic of torture. Torture is a unique human made stressor resulting in category-specific diagnostic symptoms. Medical assessment can be complemented with photographs, x-rays, electroencephalograms, and sleep studies. Individual psychotherapy and group techniques focus on the issues of denial and trust, loss, survivor guilt, and reparation. Programs of psychological and social rehabilitation and treatment with benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and other compounds are reviewed. Future research needs include the conceptualization of the trauma of torture and its sequelae in broader terms, the application of standardized measurements to facilitate international comparisons, and the testing of various approaches to intervention in an experimental design. An ethical physician must resist the pressures of totalitarian governments to assume neutrality in the presence of human rights violations affecting his/her patients.", 
    "45": "Seizures in pregnancy pose risks for both the mother and the fetus and must be managed aggressively. Antiepileptic drugs have some teratogenic potential, but the risks are not as profound as reported in earlier literature. There is definitely less risk to the fetus from anticonvulsant exposure than from uncontrolled seizures. The evaluation of a pregnant woman with new-onset seizures is the same as for the nonpregnant patient, including head computed tomography with appropriate abdominal shielding. Status epilepticus management is based on IV benzodiazepines, phenytoin, or phenobarbital. Good fetal outcome is dependent on rapid seizure control. Management of eclampsia is controversial. There is little evidence that magnesium sulfate has anticonvulsant properties, and its use as such will probably decline steadily in the future. At present, it is reasonable to manage eclamptic seizures in the same way that status epilepticus is managed.", 
    "46": "To increase understanding of the potential in elderly persons for disability related to behavioral side effects of anxiolytic medications, cognitive and psychomotor effects of clinical doses of buspirone and a popular intermediate-acting benzodiazepine, alprazolam, were examined in carefully screened, healthy elderly subjects.", 
    "47": "Sixty subjects recruited through community organizations and newspaper advertisements and screened on the basis of history, physical examination, and laboratory studies were randomly assigned to one of three drug treatment groups. After 2 days of washout placebo, subjects were given 0.25 mg t.i.d. of alprazolam, 5 mg t.i.d. of buspirone, or placebo three times a day for a total of 14 days in a double-blind design. Behavioral assessments were completed beginning 1 hour after ingestion of medication on the second washout placebo day, day 1 of the treatment period, and day 14 of the treatment period. Tests included the continuous performance test, recall memory for word lists, digit-symbol substitution, retention of pictorial stimuli over 1 hour, the Profile of Mood States, and subjective ratings of mental status.", 
    "48": "Buspirone did not affect reaction time, vigilance, psychomotor speed, or memory function. Alprazolam had minimal effects on vigilance, psychomotor speed, and memory on the first treatment day and had no effects after repeated doses.", 
    "49": "Buspirone did not produce behavioral side effects that could lead to disability, and alprazolam had minimal side effects. Because the patients were carefully screened, it is unclear whether these medications in the doses used would have more side effects in less healthy elderly patients.", 
    "50": "Specific cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor and gastrin receptor antagonists were used to assess what role, if any, these receptors have in autocrine cell growth. Although the cholecystokinin receptor antagonist, L-364,718, inhibited cell proliferation in a broad spectrum of cell lines, the gastrin antagonist, L-365,260, had no effect on cell proliferation. In addition neither added gastrin17, nor sulfated cholecystokinin8, could reverse the inhibitory action of L-364,718. It is proposed that L-364,718 inhibits cell proliferation independently of classical gastrin/CCK receptors.", 
    "51": "The growing realisation that the benzodiazepines have potential for causing serious harm has caused concern due to their wide and common use. This paper is a review of the adverse effects of benzodiazepines, and concentrates on four areas of particular concern: drug dependence with the consequent withdrawal symptoms; psychological effects while on the drugs; use by the elderly; and tolerance to the drug effects. Although the phenomenon of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome is generally accepted, there is still controversy over the frequency amongst users. A number of major studies are reviewed here, and the main methodological issues are discussed. These include definition of the withdrawal symptoms, selection of subjects, and use of double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. The studies investigating psychological impairment with benzodiazepine use deal mainly with motor performance and co-ordination, although there is a large group of studies looking at the effect of the drugs on memory. Although the studies reviewed make a considerable contribution to the understanding of the effects of benzodiazepines, they focus on physiological and specific psychological variables, rather than more global measures of functioning and behaviour. It is suggested here that this emphasis needs to change in order to obtain a clearer picture of how benzodiazepines affect quality of life. Future studies should also be prospective in design, and include clear criteria for the selection of subjects and for the definition of withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "52": "The ability of midazolam, a benzodiazepine, to reduce the distress associated with lumbar puncture and bone marrow aspiration was examined in 23 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. Patients were randomized to receive 0.2 mg/kg midazolam HCl or placebo intravenously 3-5 min before the procedures, under double-blind conditions. Based on prior experiences, children in both groups anticipated severe pain from these procedures. Postprocedure pain ratings by patients were markedly reduced in the midazolam but not the placebo group. Both physicians and parents judged the midazolam group as significantly less distressed than controls during and after the procedures. Trained observers recorded significantly fewer pain- and anxiety-related behaviors in the midazolam group immediately before and after, but not during the procedures. The amnestic effects of midazolam, confirmed in a visual recall/recognition test, appear to account for the decreased pain ratings since the behavioral manifestations were similar in the two groups. There were no adverse drug reactions or significant changes in vital signs. Midazolam warrants further investigation as a premedication for painful diagnostic and treatment procedures in children with cancer.", 
    "53": "Thirty-one patients with a DSM-III (R) diagnosis of Major Depression received adinazolam (n = 16) or desipramine (n = 15) during a 6 week double-blind randomized controlled trial. Both groups showed a significant decline in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores (21.8 +/- 4.5 to 10.7 +/- 8.5 for adinazolam and 23.5 +/- 5.5 to 12.9 +/- 8.6) for desipramine. Melancholic and anxiety symptoms were reduced equally by both drugs. Initial sedation was the most common side-effect with adinazolam. Plasma levels of desipramine and hydroxy-desipramine correlated highly with oral dose after 3 weeks of treatment.", 
    "54": "The antiemetic efficacy of cinnarizine was assessed in 17 cancer patients receiving platin-based chemotherapy (cisplatin dose-range 30-160 mg, or carboplatin 270-600 mg) in a randomised, cross-over study. The patients were prophylactically given oral metoclopramide 3 x 1 mg/kg and lorazepam 2 x 1 mg with or without cinnarizine 3 x 75 mg. The antiemetic combination with cinnarizine prevented emesis completely on 51% of 35 days with chemotherapy and less than 3 emetic episodes occurred on 86% of the days, compared with 43% and 57% (p less than 0.01) without cinnarizine respectively. Severe nausea was significantly less frequent with cinnarizine and 59% of the chemotherapy days were without nausea, compared to 46% of the days without cinnarizine (p less than 0.05). Side-effects were uncommon and minor with both antiemetic regimens. The study suggests that addition of cinnarizine to metoclopramide and lorazepam improves antiemetic prophylaxis in low to medium dose platin-based chemotherapy.", 
    "55": "Grayanotoxins are known to occur in the honey produced from the nectar of Rhododendron ponticum growing on the mountains of the eastern Black Sea region of Turkey and also in Japan, Nepal, Brazil, and some parts of North America and Europe. Two cases of honey intoxication are presented here. Both of the patients experienced severe bradycardia and hypotension after ingestion of honey which was brought from Trabzon, Turkey. Microscopical examination showed Rhododendron ponticum pollen tetrades. Anesthetized albino rats were injected intraperitoneally with toxic honey extract doses equivalent to 1 or 5 g honey/kg. Dose-dependent hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory rate depression were observed. When marked bradycardia (approximately 75% of control value) was reached, rats were given atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, i.p.) or AF-DX 116 (20 mg/kg, i.p.). Atropine sulfate improved both bradycardia and respiratory rate depression. AF-DX 116, which is a selective M2-muscarinic receptor antagonist, restored only heart rate, but not the respiratory rate depression. These results suggest that M2-muscarinic receptors are involved in cardiotoxicity of grayanotoxin.", 
    "56": "1. Because imipramine has lowered T4 in uncontrolled studies we examined the effect of imipramine on serum thyroid levels in panic disorder patients in a double-blind placebo and diazepam treatment controlled study. 2. Treatment with imipramine (10 subjects) was associated with a significant decrease of T4 and FTI and treatment with diazepam (8 subject) was associated with a significant decrease of T4. However, there was no significant difference across treatment groups. 3. This finding suggests that previously reported decreases in thyroid hormones during antidepressant therapy may be due to nonspecific effects of treatment rather than to the drug itself.", 
    "57": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of flumazenil on bupivacaine-induced acute toxicity, 10 groups of mice were previously treated by a 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 mg/kg single dose of flumazenil or saline 15 minutes before an injection of bupivacaine (50 mg/kg: exp. 1 and 60 mg/kg: exp.2). The convulsant activity, the period of latency to convulse and the induced mortality were assessed in each group. The bupivacaine-induced mortality was increased by flumazenil. Also, the convulsant activity was increased by flumazenil and the period of latency to convulse was proportionally decreased with increasing doses of flumazenil for the two tested doses of bupivacaine.", 
    "58": "Stress is known to influence the immune function via an effect on the central nervous system. We previously presented data showing that stress alters the population of T-cell subsets in mice. The variations of T-cell subsets in the thymus, peripheral blood, and spleen in mice similarly stressed by immobilization or by unavoidable and opioid-dependent stress were measured by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies anti-L3T4, anti-Lyt 1, anti-Lyt 2 and anti-Thy 1, 2. Immobilization stress was applied for three days and T-cell subsets were measured on the days 1, 2 and 3, as well as on day 7 after release from immobilization. Lyt 2-positive cells in the thymus were the most sensitive to stress, showing significant variations. The proportion of immature T-cells increased in the thymus, blood and spleen of the stressed mice. When diazepam or naloxone were administered 30 min before the initiation of stress, these variations tended to decrease. Thus, the ratio of T-cell subsets varied with the duration of immobilization stress. This appeared to be partly mediated by the opioid system and the central nervous system.", 
    "59": "Infantile spasms usually start during the first year of life and constitute one of the most difficult types of epilepsy to treat. They carry a very poor prognosis for both epilepsy and mental development. Seventy children, including 47 infants, with intractable infantile spasms were entered into an open study with vigabatrin as add-on therapy to the usual anticonvulsant treatment. All were resistant to previous treatments, including corticosteroids (43 patients), carbamazepine, benzodiazepines, and sodium valproate. Two children withdrew from the study because of intolerance to vigabatrin (hypotonia or hypertonia) before evaluation of efficacy could be made. Of the remaining 68 children, 29 (43%) showed complete suppression of spasms. Forty-six children had a greater than 50% reduction in spasms. The best response was observed in those with tuberous sclerosis (12/14 compared with 12/18 with symptomatic infantile spasms of other origin and 22/36 with cryptogenic infantile spasms). Following the initial response to treatment of these patients (n = 68), a long-term response was confirmed in 75% of children with symptomatic infantile spasms and 36% of children with cryptogenic infantile spasms. In eight children, all other anticonvulsant medication could be definitively withdrawn. Tolerability appeared excellent, with 52 of 70 patients reporting no side effects. Somnolence, hypotonia, weight gain, excitation, and insomnia were the most common problems at the beginning of the study and were usually transient. Given the poor prognosis of this type of childhood epilepsy, vigabatrin appears to be a very interesting advance in the management of drug-resistant infantile spasms.", 
    "60": "I.v. midazolam was compared with diazepam in 112 dental outpatients in order to obtain a control of sedation. Midazolam has shown better results in all the parameters evaluated (memory scale, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics values) and in controlling sedation. The Authors consider midazolam as a preferred drug in dental outpatients and hope to get it available also in Italy.", 
    "61": "1. Effects of a new stressful manipulation, forced shaking stress at low temperature (4 degrees C) (FSLT stress), on sleeping induced by pentobarbital were investigated 70 min following its application. 2. Repeated application (7 times) decreased the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital-Na (45 mg/kg, i.p.) in mice without affecting that induced by ketamine-HCl and chloral hydrate. This effect of FSLT stress disappeared 3 days after termination of application. 3. The latency of nociceptive response in hot-plate test increased in a naloxone-sensitive manner by single and repeated FSLT stress when tested immediately (2 min) after but not 70 min after the last stress application. 4. Diazepam (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly prolonged the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.) in stressed animals without changing that in unstressed animals. The effect of diazepam was blocked by Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg, i.p.), a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. 5. Repeated FSLT stress thus appears to decrease pentobarbital sleep by inducing functional changes in the central nervous system and the GABAergic system may partially participate in FSLT stress-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleep.", 
    "62": "1. Tolerance to and physical dependence on alprazolam were induced in mice by administering two doses of a slow release preparation. 2. Physical dependence was evaluated by the abstinence syndrome induced by flumazenil. Tolerance was studied by measuring the motor incoordination induced by a test dose of alprazolam. 3. The intensity of tolerance was decreased by the administration of L-phenylisopropyl adenosine (L-PIA), cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA), cyclohexyl adenosine (CHA), N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA), 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PTP) and theophylline (TP). 4. The intensity of the abstinence syndrome induced by flumazenil was attenuated by L-PIA, CPA NECA, TP and 8-PTP. 5. The results suggest that benzodiazepines may exert, at least in part, their effects by involving adenosine in the central nervous system.", 
    "63": "The influence of propranolol on the disposition of flutoprazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative extensively biotransformed by hepatic microsomal oxidation, was evaluated in the rat. Propranolol was infused subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps (5 mg/day) to obtain steady-state concentrations of about 200 ng/ml. Flutoprazepam (5 mg/kg) was given intraperitoneally on the third day of propranolol infusion. There was some variability in flutoprazepam disposition, consistent with the concept of an extensive first-pass metabolism of high-extraction drugs. Propranolol had no significant effects on the kinetics of flutoprazepam or norflutoprazepam, an active metabolite possibly accounting for a substantial part of the parent compound's pharmacological and clinical effects. It was concluded that there is no evidence of any pharmacokinetic interaction between this beta-adrenoceptor blocker and flutoprazepam in the rat.", 
    "64": "Chlormezanone plasma concentrations were determined in 5 volunteers (group 1) after a single oral dose of 200 mg of chlormezanone with high performance liquid chromatography. A plasma elimination half-life of 23 +/- 2.3 h was calculated. The mean peak chlormezanone plasma level was 1.86 +/- 0.2 micrograms/ml, 1 h after ingestion. Additionally, chlormezanone plasma levels were determined after repeated oral doses of chlormezanone recommended for treatment of muscular spasms due to degenerative skeletal disease. After 5 days of repeated daily doses of 3 x 200 mg (group 2; 12 patients) or 3 x 400 mg (group 3; 10 patients) of chlormezanone, mean predose chlormezanone plasma levels were 12.0 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml (group 2) and 22.7 +/- 4.0 micrograms/ml (group 3), respectively. Comparable plasma concentrations were determined after 10 days of repeated doses of 3 x 200 mg or 3 x 400 mg of chlormezanone in 3 patients from each of these 2 groups. In 7 patients of group 3, chlormezanone had to be discontinued on the 5th day due to increasing muscular weakness, ataxia and exercise-inducible tachycardia. After a loading dose of 800 mg and repeated doses of 3 x 200 mg chlormezanone to 5 patients (group 4), plasma levels of 6.5 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml, 8.9 +/- 2.2 micrograms/ml, 12.7 +/- 2.0 micrograms/ml, and 10.4 +/- 2.4 micrograms/ml were determined after 2, 8, 16, and 36 h, respectively. Trace amounts of a degradation product of the acid-labile chlormezanone could be detected in plasma besides the unchanged drug after administration of repeated oral doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "In previous research, a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) package was found to be effective in reducing children's distress associated with the painful medical procedures of bone marrow aspirations (BMAs) and lumbar punctures (LPs). Orally administered Valium demonstrated less effectiveness but was helpful in reducing behavioral distress before the medical procedure. In the present study, we investigated whether the combination of oral Valium and CBT would result in increased efficacy of the CBT. Eighty-three subjects were randomly assigned to receive either CBT or CBT plus Valium while undergoing either a BMA or an LP. Dependent variables included observed behavioral distress, self-reported fear and pain, and pulse rate. Results failed to support the value of such a combination but did provide additional evidence in regard to the effectiveness of the CBT. The need for more potent medical interventions for some children is discussed.", 
    "66": "There has been concern over the growing misuse of buprenorphine and temazepam in Scotland. In interviews with 78 clients of Glasgow drug agencies during 1989-1990, it was found that buprenorphine and temazepam are now more widely and frequently misused than heroin or other opiates. Fifty-eight percent of buprenorphine users used six to seven days weekly. Fewer users of other drugs used as frequently. Heroin, other opiates and temazepam were associated with criminality. Buprenorphine, perhaps because it is relatively inexpensive, was not associated with criminality. Implications for drug policy and treatment are discussed.", 
    "67": "The distribution of diazepam in biological fluids and tissues of rats was examined 1, 2, 4 and 8 h after intraperitoneal administration by using a radioimmunoassay with specific anti-diazepam antibody. The diazepam levels in serum, saliva, brain and bone marrow decreased over a period of 2 h and levelled off 4 h after administration. The diazepam concentration in bone marrow was much higher than in serum, saliva and brain, suggesting an accumulation of diazepam in this tissue. This indicates that bone marrow could be a very useful material for the detection of diazepam in skeletonized remains. The diazepam concentrations in bone marrow, serum, saliva and brain showed a linear relationship (r = 0.860-0.997), indicating that a valid estimate of diazepam concentration in blood can be made from bone marrow samples.", 
    "68": "Lorazepam (Temesta) and alprazolam (Xanax) are two benzodiazepines which are widely used for their anxiolytic activity. In this study their effect on psychomotor functions was investigated. Eight young healthy volunteers participated in the experiments. Using a double-blind cross-over design, the effect of single oral doses of lorazepam (2.5 mg) and alprazolam (0.5 mg) on a choice reaction time test to visual stimuli (letter pairs presented on a computer screen), were assessed. The experimental procedure consisted of three sessions which differed from each other either by the stimulus presentation rate, or by the presence or absence of a warning signal. In all three sessions, lorazepam, when compared with placebo, significantly prolonged the reaction times (RT), while alprazolam did not. Increasing the interstimulus interval resulted in an equal increase of the reaction times in the three conditions. On the other hand, the introduction of a warning signal which preceded the presentation of the letter pairs, improved performance in the three conditions. This improvement was more pronounced after lorazepam than after placebo. This finding is interpreted as a partial recuperative effect for the impaired performance in the baseline condition after intake of lorazepam.", 
    "69": "One hundred and twenty-eight children aged three to ten years, were studied to determine the effect of premedication on amnesia for the preanesthetic period. Four comparable groups were used: A control group, no premedication; oral trimeprazine tartrate 2 mg/kg, methadone 0.1 mg/kg plus droperidol 0.15 mg/kg (T.M.D.); oral midazolam 0.45 mg/kg; intramuscular midazolam 0.15 mg/kg. Amnesia was tested for four pictorial facts, and for induction of anesthesia. For pictorial facts, both routes of midazolam administration gave a sixty percent incidence of amnesia compared with sixteen percent in the control group (p less than 0.001). The T.M.D. premedication provided a forty-three percent incidence, also better than the control group (p less than 0.05). Induction was remembered by fifty percent of the midazolam children compared with sixty-six percent of the T.M.D. group (p greater than 0.05) and eight-one percent of the control group (p less than 0.05). The potential advantages of amnesia in pediatric premedication are discussed.", 
    "70": "The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of concomitant administration of alprazolam and fluoxetine were studied in this double-blind parallel study in 80 healthy, male volunteers. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Drug treatments consisted of 4-day regimens of 1 mg alprazolam four times daily, 60 mg fluoxetine every morning, 1 mg alprazolam four times daily and 60 mg fluoxetine every morning, and placebo four times daily. Psychomotor performance, mood status, and degree of sedation were evaluated at designated times. Combined administration of alprazolam and fluoxetine resulted in an approximate 30% increase in plasma alprazolam concentrations relative to plasma concentrations following the administration of alprazolam alone. There were no significant differences in fluoxetine or norfluoxetine plasma concentrations between the alprazolam/fluoxetine and fluoxetine treatments. Psychomotor decrements increased when fluoxetine was administered with alprazolam relative to alprazolam administration alone. Psychomotor performance of the fluoxetine treatment group was not significantly different from that of the placebo group. No significant changes were observed in mood status, and sedation was minimal in all treatment groups. As when any two psychoactive drugs are administered together, increased patient monitoring and patient education is recommended when alprazolam and fluoxetine are prescribed concurrently.", 
    "71": "Multiple drug abuse may involve the whole range of abused drugs, but the most critical problems exist with cocaine, alcohol, opioids, and benzodiazepines. The medical and psychosocial consequences of abusing these drugs in various combinations are often more severe than abusing each drug alone, and specific combinations of treatment options may be needed for many of these drugs. These combination treatments may include relapse prevention psychotherapies targeted toward drug-related cues that are specific to each type of drug as well as pharmacotherapies targeted toward specific drugs of abuse, such as naltrexone for opioid abuse and disulfiram for alcohol abuse. Few controlled clinical trials are available with multiple drug abusers, but successful treatments using pharmacological adjuncts such as disulfiram and amantadine have been described with cocaine-abusing or alcoholic methadone-maintained patients.", 
    "72": "Three N,N-dimethylcarbamyl derivatives of oxazepam (1-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)oxazepam, 3-O-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)oxazepam, and 1,3-O-bis(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl) oxazepam) and a 3-O-acyl-1-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)-oxazepam were synthesized from either oxazepam or demoxepam. Enantiomeric pairs of these derivatives and of camazepam were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography on at least two of three commercially available chiral stationary phase columns employed. Absolute configurations of resolved enantiomers were established by comparing their circular dichroism spectra to those of enantiomeric oxazepams with known absolute stereochemistry. Similar to those of oxazepam, enantiomers of 1-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)oxazepam undergo rapid racemization (t1/2 1.9 min at 23 degrees C and 0.9 min at 37 degrees C) in an aqueous solution at pH 7.5. The (R)-enantiomer of rac-3-O-acyl-1-(N,N-dimethylcarbamyl)oxazepam was hydrolyzed approximately 4.6-fold faster than the (S)-enantiomer by esterases in rat liver microsomes, whereas the (S)-enantiomer was hydrolyzed approximately 43-fold faster than the (R)-enantiomer by esterases in rat brain S9 fraction.", 
    "73": "AHR-12245, 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-3H-imadazo[4,5-b]pyridine-3-acetamid, ethosuximide, Na valproate, phenytoin, and clonazepam were evaluated in mice and rats with a battery of well-standardized anticonvulsant test procedures. The results obtained indicate that the anticonvulsant profile of AHR-12245 is similar to that for ethosuximide and clonazepam. AHR-12245 is effective in nontoxic intraperitoneal doses in mice by the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), pentylenetatrazol (s.c. PTZ), bicuculline, and picrotoxin tests but ineffective against strychnine-induced seizures; it is effective after nontoxic oral doses in both mice and rats by the s.c. PTZ test and ineffective by the MES test. The candidate antiepileptic substance was also ineffective against seizures induced in amygdala and corneally kindled rats. The PIs for AHR-12245 by the s.c. PTZ test were 4.5 to 12 times higher than those for the prototype agents, except that for clonazepam when administered orally in mice. The in vitro studies indicate that AHR-12245 is a weak inhibitor of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding but does inhibit adenosine uptake. These results indicate that AHR-12245 is a relatively nontoxic agent with a profile of anticonvulsant action which suggests it should be useful in generalized absence seizures.", 
    "74": "Short term anaesthesia induced with xylazine and ketamine was compared to a combination of xylazine, ketamine and temazepam (a benzodiazepine) in six adult horses. Duration of recumbency was significantly prolonged when temazepam was administered with xylazine and ketamine. No significant differences in heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure or arterial pH, pCO2 and pO2 were seen between the xylazine and ketamine combination plus temazepam, and xylazine and ketamine combination only treated horses.", 
    "75": "A number of disease processes including congenital anomalies, malunited odontoid fractures, rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis can result in atlanto axial subluxation. The patient population presenting for surgery is therefore varied in age and general condition, ranging from fit young men to steroid dependent frail arthritic patients. The degree of instability and the spinal cord compression are also variable. Gauging these parameters has an important bearing on the anaesthetic management. We present management of six patients with atlanto axial subluxation in our institution.", 
    "76": "Three children had both nocturnal unilateral motor seizures and daytime ipsilateral \"negative myoclonus\" which occurred so frequently that it resembled asterixis. Neurophysiologic studies demonstrated lateralized spike discharges that were time-locked to postural lapse in the contralateral outstretched arm. The clinical course was characterized by good seizure control with benzodiazepines.", 
    "77": "Results of a randomized trial on antiemesis for cisplatin (CDDP) and non-CDDP chemotherapy-induced vomiting are reported. One hundred and sixty-three outpatients received 282 chemotherapy courses (141 with CDDP and 141 without CDDP). Patients were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose metoclopramide plus methylprednisolone (arm A) or the same drugs plus lorazepam (arm B). In both arms a high protection rate for vomiting was obtained, on the whole without statistically significant differences. Patients who received lorazepam had, however, significantly fewer nausea episodes during first day post-chemotherapy (p less than 0.05). Arm B was also superior in anxiety control during the first day of chemotherapy (p less than 0.01). Both regimens were significantly more effective in patients who had not been given chemotherapy previously (p less than 0.01). No differences in antiemetic protection were found between CDDP and non-CDDP courses. No significant differences were found in premonitory vomiting control between the two arms of the trial. Toxicity was very mild with both regimens, although sedation was significantly higher in arm B (p less than 0.001). We conclude that high-dose metoclopramide plus methylprednisolone is a highly effective combination for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and that it is quite suitable for outpatient use. Lorazepam did not significantly increase the antiemetic potency of the combination, nor did it improve premonitory vomiting control, although it gave a better control of acute nausea and anxiety.", 
    "78": "This study compared differential effects of behavioral therapy and triazolam in a clinical population with sleep-onset insomnia. Triazolam was hypothesized to decrease sleep latency and frequency and duration of awakening, with some effects during the first night's administration. But at follow-up, sleep measures were predicted to return to baseline levels. Behavioral treatment was hypothesized to effect sleep after 2 or more weeks of training which persisted at follow-up.", 
    "79": "Thirty patients with average sleep latencies of 81.48 minutes, who reported chronic insomnia for an average of 2.6 years, were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: behavioral stimulus control/relaxation training and triazolam.", 
    "80": "Both treatments decreased sleep latency but differentially. Triazolam was effective immediately but maintained only some gains at follow-up. Behavioral treatment decreased sleep latency beginning the second week, when subjects expected no improvement, with gains maintained at follow-up. Comparisons showed that triazolam group latencies returned toward baseline, while behavioral group gains were maintained at follow-up.", 
    "81": "Triazolam treatment showed superior immediate treatment effects, while behavioral treatment showed superior treatment effects at follow-up, effects that accrued during the training period and differentially persisted at follow-up. One treatment strategy implied by these results would be to combine these two interventions concurrently. This would seem to use the immediate effects produced by the medication until the behavioral skills were learned, at which point medication would be terminated. This strategy could offer immediate relief and sustained effects at drug termination.", 
    "82": "A device to facilitate kinetic receptor filtration assays is described. The receptor containing membranes and the labeled ligand are placed in two separate syringes and are rapidly mixed into a collecting syringe using a pneumatic ram. Shortly after the start of mixing, a pneumatically controlled valve switches the collecting syringe containing the receptor-ligand mixture to the filtration unit. Filtration is performed on glass/microfiber filters or equivalent by pushing the plunger of the collecting syringe by a stepper motor. A valve positioner controlling several valves allows the filtered membranes to be washed and dried by pressure in any user programmable sequence. Further filtration of the receptor-ligand mixture can be programmed at selected time points. The entire system is controlled by an IBM-PC. With this system, the association and dissociation of diazepam from crude bovine-brain membranes has been studied at 4 degrees C. The dissociation shows a biphasic pattern with half lifes of 1.3 and more than 23 minutes respectively. Association appears to be into a single compartment.", 
    "83": "The tritiated cardioselective muscarinic antagonist AF-DX 384 (5,11-dihydro-11-[2-(-[8-dipropylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]-ethyl] amino]-carbonyl]-6H-pyrido [2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one) was used to label muscarinic receptors in the rat ileum. Saturation binding to membrane suspensions revealed a high affinity binding site with a Kd of 9.2 nM. The maximal number of binding sites labeled in this tissue (Bmax) is 237 fmol/mg protein. The association and dissociation kinetics were well represented by single exponential reactions, and the dissociation constant obtained from the ratio of rate constants was in agreement with that derived from saturation experiments. Specific binding was inhibited by muscarinic antagonists with a rank order of potencies of atropine (pKi: 8.80) greater than 4-DAMP (pKi: 8.23) = AF-DX 384 (pKi: 8.20) greater than AF-DX 116 (pKi: 7.09) = hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pKi: 6.97) greater than pirenzepine (pKi: 6.49) and is consistent with the interaction of [3H]AF-DX 384 with muscarinic receptors of the M2 subtype. It can be concluded that [3H]AF-DX 384 can be used to selectively label M2 muscarinic receptors in heterogeneous receptor populations.", 
    "84": "Urethral pressure profiles (UPPs) were recorded in ten adult healthy male cats before and after administration of either phenoxybenzamine, diazepam, nifedipine or xylazine. A significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in urethral pressure at the level of the prostate was observed following treatment with all drugs. Xylazine produced a significant decrease in urethral pressure 4 to 7 cm from the tip of the penis in healthy male cats. None of the drugs used decreased urethral pressure in the zones of pure striated muscle or pure smooth muscle in these cats, making current recommendations for pharmacological management of urethral spasm suspect. Further studies are necessary to evaluate clinical cases of urethral spasm and to study the effects of these drugs on the urethral pressure of cats suffering from this spasm.", 
    "85": "A severe chloroquine poisoning, featuring indicators of bad prognosis, has been treated by a diazepam-type therapy. The outcome was favourable in a dramatic way. A toxicokinetic study showed very high chloroquine plasmatic levels, consistent with the severity of the poisoning.", 
    "86": "After 21 days of treatment with diazepam (0.5 or 2 mg/kg/day) rats were tolerant to the effects of diazepam to increase social interaction in the low light unfamiliar test condition of the social interaction test of anxiety. When they were tested 24 h after the last of 21 injections they showed significant decreases in social interaction, indicating an anxiogenic withdrawal response. However, the social interaction scores of rats tested 48 h after withdrawal from diazepam treatment were no longer different from those of the control group. The decreased social interaction, indicating increased anxiety, detected 24 h after withdrawal of diazepam (21 daily injections of 0.5 or 2 mg/kg), could be reversed by the usual daily diazepam dose (0.5 or 2 mg/kg, respectively) or by baclofen (0.5 or 1 mg/kg). Baclofen (2 mg/kg) was sedative in both control treated and diazepam-dependent rats, but was ineffective at reversing the decrease in social interaction seen after diazepam withdrawal. Possible sites of action mediating these effects of baclofen are discussed, and it is suggested that either post-synaptic GABAB sites in the hippocampus are involved or that the reversal of the decreased social interaction detected on withdrawal of diazepam treatment is due to a baclofen-mediated inhibition of 5-HT release in the hippocampus.", 
    "87": "A single 10 mg dose of zolpidem, an imidazopyridine hypnotic, was administered to young, healthy male volunteers prior to bedtime. The drug reduced REM sleep but did not significantly affect other sleep stages and subjective sleep parameters. All-night spectral analysis of the EEG revealed that power density in nonREM sleep was reduced in the low-frequency range (1.25-2.5 Hz; 5.25-10.0 Hz) and increased in the spindle frequency range (12.25-13.0 Hz). Significant changes in the EEG spectrum were present in the first 4 h of sleep. The pattern of the spectral changes was similar to those induced by other hypnotics that bind to the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. There were no residual effects of zolpidem on psychomotor performance in the morning, on the self-rated state in the morning and at noon, and on sleep and EEG parameters in the subsequent drug-free night.", 
    "88": "Although still very preliminary, these studies exemplify how metabolic brain measurements can address questions of relevance in the investigation of drugs of addiction such as: 1. Mechanisms of drug toxicity, i.e., vascular pathology demonstrated from chronic use of cocaine. 2. Neurotransmitters that may be involved in the pharmacological actions of drugs, i.e., alcohol and the benzodiazepine-Gaba receptor complex, marijuana, and the cannabinoid receptor. 3. Mechanisms of drug withdrawal, i.e., hyperresponsivity of the brain to alcohol in the alcoholic, possibly as a consequence of increased sensitivity of the benzodiazepine-Gaba receptor complex. 4. Knowledge about brain function, i.e., the relation between activation of the cerebellum by marijuana and alcohol and the mood-changing effects of these drugs, suggests that the cerebellum may play a role in the mood disturbing actions seen with these drugs (a role which is different from the classical one which associates the cerebellum to motor regulation). Future work will provide more definitive answers to the above questions and will similarly provide information about mechanisms of toxicity, addiction, withdrawal, and reinforcement of other drugs of abuse.", 
    "89": "Used as early as 1946 as an analgesic then to treat heroin addicts, the addicting and toxic potential of methadone was quickly recognized. 25 deaths between 1981 and 1986 were reportedly due to methadone in Geneva of which 2 were violent deaths, 9 were caused by a combination of opiates and methadone and 14 were directly related to methadone. Three deaths were noted during the two first weeks of methadone substitutive therapy. Six were noted less than two weeks before leaving jail and 15 were associated with benzodiazepine ingestion. Postmortem blood levels cannot help determine the severity of poisoning neither a causal relationship between methadone and death. Pathological findings as well as the medical history should be taken into consideration.", 
    "90": "ASA Grade I and II patients admitted for day-case urological surgery received no premedication or an oral dose of temazepam 10 mg. Anaesthesia was induced with methohexitone and maintained with nitrous oxide, oxygen and halothane or enflurane via a Mapleson A circuit. The incidence of post-operative headache was investigated by an independent observer. Eighty patients were studied (50 male and 30 female) of whom 32 (40%) had post-operative headaches. Post-operative headache was significantly correlated with female sex and frequent 'normal' headache occurrence. The lack of previous surgical experience was a significant risk factor and a loose insignificant association existed with age, the use of halothane and the presence of pre-operative headache. Temazepam premedication had no effect and was associated with significantly more patients complaining of feeling cold.", 
    "91": "This double-blind study investigated the rectal administration of midazolam as an alternative to general anaesthesia for elective computerized tomography (CT) of the brain. Thirty children were randomly allocated to receive either midazolam 0.3 mg kg-1 (Group 1) or midazolam 0.6 mg kg-1 (Group 2) by the rectal route. Sedation was obtained in 13 children in Group 1 and 12 in Group 2 but this was only satisfactory for scanning in seven children in Group 1 and eight in Group 2. We concluded that although the technique produced sedation, it did not reliably produce satisfactory conditions for CT scanning.", 
    "92": "1. Wistar rats were implanted with cannulae into the medial preoptic and anterior hypothalamic areas for intracerebral injections. 2. Unilateral intracerebral injections of carbachol (1 microgram) into a limited area of the basal forebrain decreased significantly both the distance travelled by the animals and time spent walking. 3. In addition to the decrease in locomotion, it was demonstrated for the first time that injections of carbachol also slow animal movement by significantly decreasing speed of forward progression. 4. All locomotor effects of carbachol were reversed by local pretreatment with atropine (1 microgram) but not by pirenzepine (2 micrograms) suggesting that these effects were mediated by M2 muscarinic receptors with minimal or no M1 receptor involvement.", 
    "93": "Using conditioned-reflex methods for active and passive avoidance with punishment reinforcement, we found pronounced memory deficits in 12-week old rats exposed perinatally to alcohol (FAS rats). Impairment of memory was observed not only with the high dose of 9 g ethanol/kg body weight (ingested with tap water in a 6% solution) to which dams were exposed during pregnancy and lactation, but also with the ten-fold lower dose of 1 g ethanol/kg body weight (0.6% ethanol). The nootropic drugs citicholine, piracetam and meclofenoxate administered orally for five days before the training session were effective in decreasing memory deficits; particularly pronounced was the effect of piracetam and meclofenoxate. The benzodiazepine tranquilizer diazepam additionally impaired learning and memory in FAS rats. It is suggested that nootropics could be used to decrease the cognitive disturbances in some humans born to alcoholic mothers.", 
    "94": "1. Human erythrocyte muscarinic receptor is further classified as M1 subtype by its binding of [3H]pirenzepine (a specific M1 antagonist). Conversely, binding of [3H]piperidinyl AF-DX116 (a specific M2 antagonist) is not detected. 2. There are high correlations between the binding efficacies of 25 known or putative cholinergic agents using either human erythrocyte membrane or mouse caudate homogenate. Also the in vitro data corresponds satisfactorily with in vivo data measuring the protective effect of these compounds against organophosphate poisoning. 3. The human erythrocyte membrane is an efficient model for investigating cholinergic agonists and antagonists.", 
    "95": "In conscious dogs with gastric and pancreatic fistulas, we compared the action of different doses of telenzepine (ranging from 9 to 243 nmol kg-1 h-1 i.v.) and pirenzepine (ranging from 43 to 1,170 nmol kg-1 h-1 i.v.) on the pancreatic secretory response to graded loads of intraduodenal infusions of tryptophan, given with a secretin background. Both, telenzepine and pirenzepine caused an overall significant inhibition of the cumulative incremental pancreatic protein output by 65.8 and 66.8%, respectively. The pancreatic bicarbonate output was also reduced by 38.3 and 40.5%, respectively, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. The inhibitory potency of the effective doses of telenzepine or pirenzepine did not differ significantly. Only the highest doses of telenzepine (243 nmol kg-1 h-1 i.v.) and of pirenzepine (1,170 nmol kg-1 h-1 i.v.) significantly increased heart rate from 59.9 +/- 3.4 to 63.1 +/- 4.5 bpm, respectively. These findings indicate that (1) in the intact animal, the M1-receptor antagonists telenzepine and pirenzepine are capable of inhibiting pancreatic bicarbonate and protein output in response to intraduodenal tryptophan with secretin background, and (2) telenzepine is 4.7 times more potent than pirenzepine.", 
    "96": "Flumazenil, the first specific benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist, is one of the most innovative drugs to become available within the last few years. Flumazenil is indicated for the reversal of the centrally depressant effects of BZDs, in BZD-induced anaesthesia, in BZD sedation in intensive care and in patients comatose after drug overdoses including BZDs. A conference of experts experienced in the treatment of mixed drug overdoses by various means, including flumazenil, was held in order to try to reach a consensus regarding the safe use of flumazenil in this indication. From the knowledge and experience gained to date, it was concluded that flumazenil may be useful and safe in the treatment of suspected BZD and mixed drug overdoses, provided that the appropriate precautions are observed.", 
    "97": "1,1,1-Trichloroethane (1,1,1-TE) is a widely used organic solvent which is thought to be relatively safe. The present review is mainly focused on the neurotoxic effects of 1,1,1-TE. Concentrations above 350 ppm are considered capable of negatively conditioning the performance of the exposed person, in particular reaction time and manual abilities. Peripheral neuropathies have also been described. More recently the potential neurotoxicity of 1,1,1-TE has been underscored by animal studies investigating the effects of this substance in neurobehavioral tests and on neurochemical parameters. 1,1,1-TE alters the motor activity in small laboratory rodents. In fixed interval responding in mice, the effects of 1,1,1-TE are qualitatively similar to those of other volatile (ethanol) and non volatile (benzodiazepines and barbiturates) CNS depressants. In addition, in drug discrimination procedures 1,1,1-TE shares discriminative stimulus properties with barbiturates, toluene, halotane, and oxazepam indicating that this solvent has behavioral effects in common with central nervous system depressant drugs. From a neurochemical point of view long-term exposure to 1,1,1-TE induces astrogliosis in the cerebral cortex of gerbils as indicated by an increased concentration of glial fibrillary acidic protein. In addition low dose inhalation of 1,1,1-TE for 3 months decreases DNA concentrations in several brain regions of the gerbil. 1,1,1-TE affects also brain concentrations of cAMP and cGMP as well as calcium ion control, possibly through an action on voltage-dependent calcium channels. It has been also suggested that intermediate metabolites of 1,1,1-TE may give origin to condensation products with dopamine, ultimately impairing dopaminergic transmission. Some of the neurochemical effects of 1,1,1-TE are shared by other chlorinated organic solvents as well as by CNS depressants. The literature analyzed indicates that 1,1,1-TE may exert significant neurotoxic effects suggesting that more caution in its use is needed and that attention should be paid to the possibility of an additive effect of 1,1,1-TE and CNS depressants (ethanol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and other volatile solvents) giving origin to severe neurotoxicity."
