    "0": "As can be seen from the tables, the terminal half-life of clobazam is about 50 hours, and from a solid dosage form the peak plasma level occurs approximately 1.5 hours after ingestion. Thus, there is a significant, yet relatively short, dosage form delay effect when the solid dosage forms are compared to the rapidly available solution of the drug. However, based on the areas under the curve, comparison of the solid dosage forms with the solution indicates that the fraction of clobazam absorbed is 1. Pupil diameter measurement at 2, 4, and 6 hours after ingestion of clobazam correlated well with the plasma levels at these times. Pupils were constricted to the highest degree at 2 hours and approached the initial pupillary diameter at the 6-hour measurement.", 
    "1": "Clorazepate is decarboxylated to form desmethyldiazepam and is a convenient way of administering it. Its kinetics were investigated in epileptic patients after single oral and multiple oral doses. Peak serum concentrations of demethyldiazepam occurred in 0.5 to 1 hr. There appeared to be a brief lag before rapid absorption. Because of the rapid absorption with resulting high serum levels, daily doses should be divided. Serum concentration/time curves were best fitted by the two-compartment open model. The apparent t1/2 of the distribution phase was 1.28 +/- 0.44 hr and the t1/2 of the disposition phase was 40.8 +/- 9.96 hr. Serum concentrations rose after meals. Whole body apparent volume of distribution (VB/F) was 1.63 +/- 0.24 L/kg. Total plasma clearance was 34.4 +/- 7.2 ml/min, which is greater than clearance levels for desmethyldiazepam in normals and reflects the greater hepatic metabolism which occurs in treated epileptics. The discrepancy illustrates the hazards of extrapolating data collected in normals to patients with multiple drug exposures.", 
    "2": "Benzodiazepines are among the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world. In contrast to their extensive use, the therapeutic indications and potential of benzodiazepines are limited. All benzodiazepine derivatives available in Canada are similar structurally and in their pharmacologic actions. Few have specific advantages over any others. For example, no benzodiazepine has been shown to be superior to chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of acute anxiety, chronic anxiety neurosis or insomnia. Barbiturates should not be prescribed for these problems since benzodiazepines are just as effective and are safer. Persons more than 70 years old should receive initial doses of benzodiazepines 50% less than those prescribed for younger persons, and individuals with cirrhosis should receive chlordiazepoxide or diazepam in one third the usual dose; oxazepam or lorazepam should be considered for these two groups of patients. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide should not be given intramuscularly. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed only when clearly indicated and only for the necessary length of time.", 
    "3": "The prescribing of psychoactive drugs for 1431 chronically ill elderly patients being assessed for long-term institutional or community care was surveyed. Psychoactive drugs had been prescribed for about one quarter of the patients; benzodiazepines were the most frequently prescribed group. Judging from the extensive prescribing of flurazepam and chloral hydrate, commonly used hypnotics, the main reason psychoactive drugs were prescribed was to provide night-time sedation. Antidepressants and drugs promoted as useful in improving cognitive function were infrequently prescribed. Commendable prescribing practices included the infrequent use of \"cerebral vasodilators\" and barbiturates. Questionable prescribing practices included the infrequent use of tricyclic antidepressants in severely depressed patients and the use of tranquilizers in patients described by their attending physician as markedly or extremely withdrawn.", 
    "4": "The effects of 1mg/kg diazepam on punished behaviour of pigs were investigated under various degrees, of food deprivation and/or shock level. Responses emitted during the punishment signal were affected more by the shock level than by the degree of food deprivation while nonpunished response rates were modified by neither factor. Diazepam treatment increased the number of responses emitted during the punishment signal but interacted with the shock intensity: drug effects were attenuated when the shock intensity was severe, in spite of an equivalent control baseline. Diazepam also increased the overall rate of nonpunished responding. The drug treatment had no reliable effect on flinch and escape thresholds measured in separate experiments. The effects of diazepam on punished responding do not appear to be related to eventual changes in food motivation or sensitivity to electric shock.", 
    "5": "The effect of the new 1,5-benzodiazepine clobazam on visual evoked potentials (VEP) and spontaneous EEG in the conscious rabbit and on spinal polysynaptic reflexes in the decerebrated cat was studied in comparison to the 1,4-benzodiazepine diazepam. Clobazam was half as potent as diazepam in depressing the amplitude of visual evoked potentials in the nonanaesthetized rabbit, whereas the depressing effect on spinal polysynaptic reflexes in the decerebrated cat was only 1/7 --1/30 of the diazepam effect. The action of clobazam and diazepam on VEP also showed differences in time course, i.e., the peak effect of clobazam lasted from 1 to 6 h after application, whereas the effect of diazepam appeared after 10 min and declined already after 1 h. Both compounds had similar effects on computer-analyzed spontaneous EEG in the rabbit (power spectrum analysis), with an increase of power in the beta-band (13-39Hz) and a decrease in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and theta (4-8Hz) bands.", 
    "6": "The present paper reviews the role of antianxiety agents in the treatment of nonpsychotic anxious patients. Major emphasis is placed on findings from clinical trials conducted by this research group. Consideration is given to the relative efficacy of available antianxiety agents, to patients response in relation to patterns of symptomatology, and to the degree of symptom relief experienced by drug-treated anxious patients. Also discussed are some of the many nonspecific factors that affect improvement with drug treatment in general and with the benzodiazepines in particular. It is concluded that many anxious patients are not currently receiving adequate drug treatment, and may require longer periods of drug therapy or supplemental nondrug intervention.", 
    "7": "The analysis of variance and Student's \"t\" test were applied in an assessment of the hypotensive effectiveness of three hypotensive protocols: a) diazepam + amitryptiline; b) reserpine + chlorthalidone; c) all drugs in 57 and 32 patients with stabilised essential hypertension. Diazepam + amitryptiline proved effective, both alone and in protocol b).", 
    "8": "Seventy-nine cases of eclampsia (incidence 0.22%) are reviewed. The corrected maternal and perinatal mortality rates were 12.6% and 28.3%. Maternal and perinatal mortality were directly related to number of fits, severity of eclampsia, delay in onset of treatment, and duration of labour. Whereas the maternal mortality was 23 per cent in patients delivered vaginally and 8.6 per cent in patients delivered by caesarean section, the perinatal mortality was almost the same in both types of delivery.", 
    "9": "The postoperative respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl in combination with flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) was assessed in awake and in unconscious patients. In awake patients respiratory function was measured with blood-gas analyses. For measurements in unconscious patients the administration of nitrous oxide/oxygen was continued postoperatively and the respiratory depression was judged from the increase in respiratory minute volume after the i.v. administration of 0.05 mg naloxone (Narcan). In the group of awake patients blood-gasvalues were within the normal range after anaesthesia with flunitrazepam (1 mg) and fentanyl (0.80 mcg/kg body weight/10 min anaesthesia; last fentanyl given 40 min before the end of the operation), and the administration of naloxone was without any effect. If, however, naloxone was given while the patients were kept under light nitrous oxide/oxygen anaesthesia, the effect was different. The respiratory minute volume was considerably less than its predicted value in all groups of patients having received fentanyl, and naloxone caused a marked increase in respiratory minute volume and in respiratory rate. In a group of patients which have received no opiate but enflurane, naloxone showed no effect. After premedication with pethidine as compared with flunitrazepam the effect of naloxone on ventilation was more pronounced. This marked difference in the postoperative effect of fentanyl on ventilation depending on the state of consciousness has to be attributed to an interaction between a residual respiratory depressant effect of fentanyl and the effect of unconsciousness. Since after the combined use of flunitrazepam and fentanyl deep postoperative sleep occurs quite frequent, a residual effect of fentanyl should always be antagonized with naloxone to protect the patients from a possible hazardous effect of this interaction.", 
    "10": "The results of two experiments suggest that sensory and affective verbal descriptors provide a valid scaling method which discriminates between the sensory intensity and the affect, or unpleasantness, of electrocutaneous stimuli. Twenty-four subjects judged the sensory intensity and affect of noxious electrocutaneous stimuli by choosing verbal descriptors from randomized lists and by cross-modality matching to time duration and to handgrip force. The psychophysical functions for sensory intensity generated by the descriptor and the cross-modality functions for sensory intensity generated by the descriptor and the cross-modality methods are the same. Psychophysical functions for affect generated by thedescriptor and the cross-modality methods are different. However, only the descriptor method produces psychophysical functions for affect that are significantly different from all the sensory functions. This result suggest that only the descriptor method distinguishes between sensory intensity and affect. The discriminative power of the descriptor method is demonstrated further in an experiment in which 32 subjects rated either the sensory intensity or the affect of the electrocutaneous stimuli immediately before and after an i.v. administration of 5 mg diazepam. This common minor tranquilizer significantly lowered affective descriptor responses (P less than 0.005) without altering sensory descriptor and sensory and affective handgrip responses. These experiments indicate that sensory and affective verbal pain descriptors may be used as a valid and sensitive tool for the evaluation of pain and pain control methods.", 
    "11": "A case of anticholinergic psychossis in a 17-year-old male following suspected ingestion of an unknown amount of benztropine mesylate is discussed. The borderline mentally retarded patient exhibited acute psychosis and physical signs common to anticholinergic and amphetamine intoxications such as mydriasis, tachycardia and hypertension. Intramuscular chlorpromazine hydrochloride and oral haloperidol were administered to sedate the patient. The differential diagnosis of anticholinergic intoxication was based on the patient's physical and mental symptoms, the short duration of the psychosis and a negative urine assay for amphetamine. The neuropsychiatric signs of and treatment for anticholinergic psychosis are discussed. Physostigmine salicylate is the drug of choice for reversing the signs and symptoms of anticholinergic poisoning. Benzodiazepines may be used if sedation is indicated, but use of phenothiazines for this purpose should be avoided.", 
    "12": "The compatibility and stability of diazepam injection were studied following dilution to 10 different concentrations in dextrose 5% in water, normal saline, Ringer's injection and lactated Ringer's injection. Prepared solutions were examined for clarity and pH throughout a 24-hour period. Clear solutions were filtered and then assayed 24 hours after preparation using UV spectrophotometry. Solutions which formed visible precipitates before 24 hours or which did not demonstrate acceptable potency (greater than or equal to 90%) were assayed after shorter time periods. Dilutions lower than 1:20 (5 mg in 20 ml) resulted in immediate visible precipitates in all four diluents. The 1:20 dilution was compatible with all four diluents and maintained acceptable potency for four hours, whereas at 1:40 dilution (5 mg in 40 ml) diazepam was stable for at least 6-8 hours in the same diluents. At higher dilutions of 1:50, 1:75 and 1:100 (5 mg in 50, 75 and 100 ml, respectively) the injection was compatible with and stable in all four diluents for 24 hours. Further studies are required before the use of diazepam injection as an infusion can be recommended. However, if in some circumstances it is necessary to administer diazepam as an infusion, it is recommended that it be diluted in dextrose 5% in water, normal saline, Ringer's injection or lactated Ringer's injection to a dilution of at least 1:40 and used within 6 hours or to a dilution of 1:50 and used within 24 hours.",

Such an endogenous 3H-diazepam binding inhibitory factor (DIF) has been found. This compound is unevenly distributed in brain and in various peripheral organs. The partially purified compound appears to have a low molecular weight (below 500) and is not inactivated by proteolytic enzymes.", 
    "14": "1 A high pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay has been developed for the measurement of chlordiazepoxide and its metabolites, N-desmethylchlordiazepoxide and demoxepam in microgram concentrations in human plasma. 2 Another metabolite was detected in appreciable amounts in the plasma from patients receiving high doses of chlordiazepoxide after the first 3 days of treatment. 3 Preliminary studies would indicate that this metabolite is N-desmethyldiazepam. 4 A modified HPLC system, using a microparticulate column was developed to separate N-desmethyldiazepam from chlordiazepoxide and its other metabolites in plasma.", 
    "15": "In a 36-week controlled study, the efficacy of clonazepam administered with phenytoin and phenobarbital was evaluated in twenty-four epileptic mental patients suffering from major motor seizures. The patients were distributed in two strata according to the presence or the absence of chlorpromazine. As compared with placebo treatment in the chlorpromazine-free patients, a significant reduction in the frequency of the tonic-clonic seizures was observed during the 24-week clonazepam treatment. This effect could not be observed in the patients requiring the antipsychotic drug. The EEG performed before and at the end of the experimental period did not show any significant change. The most common adverse reactions to clonazepam were drowsiness and ataxia; they diminished with continued treatment.", 
    "16": "Chlordiazepoxide, which blocks serotonin turnover, increased food intake; and fluoxetine, a serotonin agonist, decreased food intake. Administration of combinations of the two drugs showed an antagonistic dose-dependent relationship, implicating a satiety of hunger mechanims which is mediated by serotonin.", 
    "17": "The electroencephalographic findings observed in twenty-nine patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome were related with prognosis of the epileptic manifestations. The presence of slow spike-wave complexes with preponderance of spike over the slow wave and the presence of fixed complexes in spite of the medical treatment, are related with poor prognosis for the epileptic manifestations.", 
    "18": "A comparison was made of the effects of chronically administered diazepam and phenobarbital with those of elicited seizures on repeated acquisition learning in 3 prepubertal Papio papio. The learning task required the baboons each day to perform different sequences of lever presses on a three-lever behavior panel. Middle dose levels of both diazepam and phenobarbital were found to improve learning performance relative to base-line control levels, as measured by total errors, efficiency, and time required to complete chains of various lengths to a fixed criterion. The doses were well within therapeutically relevant seizure control and clinical blood level ranges. Higher doses of both drugs generally abolished the performance gains achieved with the lower doses. Seizures elicited twice weekly for 2--3 weeks, or daily for 7 days, induced no overall decrement in performance. Cyclicity in subsequent performance was, however, induced by each individual seizure during the twice weekly seizure period, and learning performance was found to be significantly worse at 42 hr than at 18 hr after each seizure. Implications of these data for acquisition of learning in the epileptic are discussed.", 
    "19": "Clobazam, an anxiolytic 1,5-benzodiazepine, has been evaluated as an anticonvulsant in 2 animal models. In mice showing sound induced seizures, clobazam, 1--4 mg/kg, i.p., blocked seizure responses for 1--2 hr. In Senegalese baboons Papio papio showing photically induced myoclonus or seizures, clobazam, 2--12 mg/kg, i.v., totally prevented such responses for up to 6 hr. In baboons pretreated with allylglycine, 170--185 mg/kg, a similar but briefer protection was induced by clobazam. Neurological toxicity was not prominent (transient, slight nystagmus after clobazam, 2--6 mg/kg; muscular hypotonia after clobazam, 12 mg/kg). The possibility that 1,5-benzodiazepines are superior to 1,4-benzodiazepines in the therapy of epilepsy requires clinical investigation.", 
    "20": "The possible function of the lone tryptophan residue of human serum albumin in the stereospecific binding site for indole and benzodiazepine compounds was investigated by chemical modification. This residue can be selectively modified with 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzyl bromide. The modification alters the conformation of the albumin only slightly, as revealed by circular dichroism, fluorescence, and ultraviolet absorption measurements. A decrease in the association constants of L-tryptophan and diazepam of about 30 - 50% and a decrease in the extrinsic Cotton effects of four benzodiazepine derivatives of about 10 - 15% were found as specific effects of the tryptophan modification. The tryptophan modification itself did not change the number of binding sites of diazepam and L-tryptophan. It is suggested that the lone tryptophan residue of human serum albumin is not directly involved in the specific binding site for indole and benzodiazepine compounds. However, the modification alters the properties of the binding site either by an incomplete refolding of the albumin after urea treatment, or a more selective allosteric effect of the modified tryptophan residue.", 
    "21": "A status epilepticus was observed in a 22 year old female patient during endotoxinshock. The status epilepticus was treated with a high dosage of diazepame. The EEG showed a burst suppression pattern, in our case mixed by anoxia and diazepame. The burst-suppression pattern and the clinical suspicion of delayed degradation of diazepame caused by toxic hepatic failure suggested the therapy of forced diuresis. This therapy was followed by decreasing suppression periods, indicating the dominante influence of the hypnotic drug. This result shows the diagnostic as well as the therapeutic value of forced diuresis in this case.", 
    "22": "In experiments on dogs, milid (proglymid) entailed a weak inhibition of the 2nd phase of the gastric secretion leaving intact the 1st phase. The action of LS-519 was obvious in the 1st phase, having entailed a significant inhibition. The glycomacropeptid exerted a strong inhibiting effect both on the 1st and the 2nd phases, the effect lasting longer than that of the first two drugs. All the three drugs not only inhibited the gastric secretion but increased pH, reduced the gastric juice acidity while exerting no significan effect on concentration of common proteinases.", 
    "23": "150 patients undergoing minor gynaecological procedures (curretages) were anesthetized with ketamine and either diazepam flunitrazepam or placebo in order to establish the best combination for the prevention of postoperative psychotomimetic effects. From observations, up to 24 h after operation, it was found and statistically proven that the combination of ketamine/flunitrazepam as compared to the combinations ketamine/diazepam and ketamine/placebo led to a remarkable reduction of psychotomimetic side reactions.", 
    "24": "Several new alpha-amino-alpha-phenyl-o-tolytriazoles and -imidazoles have been prepared in one step by means of a novel reductive rearrangement of the corresponding benzodiazepines with hydrazine hydrate. These new triazoles were found to have moderate sedative and muscle relaxing activity in mice (i.e., these compounds depressed the traction and dish reflexes at higher doses than did diazepam) but were very potent antagonists of the clonic convulsions induced in mice by the administration of pentylenetetrazole. Furthermore, they antagonized the lethality induced by thiosemicarbazide. While these new compounds were very active in mice, most were inactive in rats. These results are discussed with reference to the metabolism of compound 13.",

There are a number of organic fluorides which have become important considerations in psychiatry. Therapeutically the organic fluorides include the neuroleptics trifluoperazine, fluphenazine, triflupromazine, and haloperidol, the benzodiazepine flurazepam and the polyfluorinated inhalant convulsant indoklon. On the negative side, deliberate inhalation of fluorocarbon aerosol propellants has become a modern form of drug abuse among the young. A review is presented on the biochemistry and toxicology of organic fluorides with special emphasis on implications to the field of psychiatry.", 
    "27": "The treatment of Parkinson's syndrome with newly developed drugs has to be planned within the entire therapeutic concept. Besides the anticholinergics, levodopa, amantadines and beta-blockers should be taken into consideration. When necessary, hypnotics, ataractics and antidepressant drugs should be applied.", 
    "28": "Intraperitoneal injection of diazepam in moderate dosage (1--10mg/kg) to rats caused a decrease in dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) formation, measured as the accumulation of these intermediates induced by inhibition of the aromatic L-aminoacid decarboxylase by means of NSD 1015 (3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (HCl), in limbic forebrain, striatum and the remaining hemisphere portion. These effects are opposite to those induced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) and gamma-butyrolactone (100 and 750 mg/kg i.p. respectively), and the effects of the latter agents were significantly counteracted by diazepam. The effect of diazepam on dopa formation persisted after the acute transection of dopaminergic axons (transverse cerebral hemisection at the level of the caudal hypothalamus). The elevation of dopamine following hemisection was also significantly counteracted on the hemisected side of the brain, the intact side remaining unchanged. The data do not support the hypothesis that benzodiazepines act by enhancing gabaergic transmission. They rather suggest that these agents exert an inhibitory action on transmitter synthesis and utilization at the synaptic level, i.e. an action not necessarily bearing any direct relationship to gaba.", 
    "29": "The article describes analytical data (TLC, GLC, IR, UV and MS) of flunitrazepam, 7-amino-flunitrazepam, desmethylflunitrazepam, 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam, 7-amino-desmethyl-flunitrazepam and many other benzodiazepine-derivatives, especially aminobenzophenones. Also extraction from biological specimen is reported.", 
    "30": "Based on evidence that the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) has specific and independent receptors for 5HT, GABA and glycine (Gallager and Aghajanian, 1976; Wang and Aghajanian, 1977), alterations in the firing rate of DR neurons following the administration of benzodiazepines (BZ) were evaluated to determine whether they were the result of a direct interaction with 5HT receptors or due to interactions of these drugs with GABA and/or glycine. The effects of BZs after both direct and systemic application were tested in rats using microiotophoretic and single-cell recording techniques. Although the BZs did not alter the spontaneous firing rate of the DR, both the systemic and iontophoretic administration of these drugs were found to potentiate the inhibitory response produced by GABA. The data suggest that this potentiation is mediated postsynaptically. Since the effects of BZs on the spontaneous activity of the DR are only apparent following pretreatments with AOAA, it is speculated that these drugs may only have pronounced effects when GABAergic input is prominent.", 
    "31": "In a double-blind crossover trial valproate was compared with phenobarbital with regard to anticonvulsive activity and tolerance in 17 epileptic children (mean age 55 +/- 26 months) with Lennox syndrome. Valproate in association with a phenobarbital dose reduced by about 40% proved to be to a statistically significant degree more active against epileptic seizures than phenobarbital alone. No difference in the effect on the EEG tracings was observed. Valproate appeared to be somewhat more active than phenobarbital with regard to behaviour, but the difference was not significant. Tolerance to both products was equally good.", 
    "32": "Conclusive evidence of improved outcome due to adjunctive anxiolytic therapy in some somatic conditions is lacking. However, such therapy may facilitate patient management without being \"curative\". The resulting improved feeling of well-being may be of value in the management of gastrointestinal disorders, migraine and myocardial infarction. Negative effects may be observed in acute respiratory conditions, especially during acute exacerbations of chronic conditions, with the administration of benzodiazepines; hence they should be used with caution. The use of these agents in treating persons with hypertension seems to be of no value and may even be detrimental. Careful evaluation of each case is desirable, and treatment should be planned with its termination in mind.", 
    "33": "The presence of diazepam in culutres of chicken embryo myoblasts arrests normal muscle cell differentiation. High concentrations of the drug reversibly prevent myoblasts from fusing to form multinucleated myotubes. Lower concentrations of diazepam allow cell fusion to occur, but inhibit the synthesis and accumulation of myosin heavy chain, implying that cell fusion does not obligate myoblasts to synthesize and accumulate large quantities of muscle specific protein. The effect of diazepam on muscle cells in culture is direct and specific.", 
    "34": "A 39-year-old right-handed male suffered several episodes of transient right-sided weakness, sensory loss, and Broca's aphasia at age 31. Diagnostic studies failed to demonstrate any cause for these events. Following a complete recovery, he noted the onset of stiffness and increasing muscle bulk in his right arm, which gradually restricted its use. Simultaneous recordings from contracting biceps and triceps muscles in both arms suggested that the hypertrophy was physiologically induced by an abnormal mechanism providing resistance during phasing activity.", 
    "35": "The evoked potential in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) recorded by stimulation of basal medial amygdaloid nucleus (Abm) showed a triphasic pattern and diazepam (2 mg/kg, i. p.) decreased the late component. The evoked potential in the midbrain reticular formation (MRF) recorded by stimulation of Abm showed a fast component with a relatively short latency followed by a biphasic late component and diazepam decreased the late component. Though the evoked potential in the Abm recorded by stimulation of LH showed a triphasic pattern, diazepam had no influence on the amplitude. Diazepam increased markedly the amplitude of evoked potential in the MRF recorded by stimulation of LH. Diazepam was ineffective on the evoked potential in the Abm recorded by stimulation of MRF. Diazepam decreased markedly the late component of evoked potential in the LH recorded by stimulation of MRF. These results suggest that the depression of emotional behavior by diazepam may be particularly related to the fact that the evoked potential in the LH recorded by stimulation of Abm was decreased by diazepam.", 
    "36": "Vasomotor waves (VMW) were observed in nine cardiac patients during cardiopulmonary bypass. The period and amplitude of the waves were described together with their consistency and other pertinent data. Effects of several pharmacologic agents on these waves were tested. These VMW are likely to be caused by spontaneous oscillation of presso-regulatory feedback systems. Cerebral ischemic response is suspected to be the most likely candidate. However, no patients showed any gross neurological symptoms in the postoperative period.", 
    "37": "In order to study the metabolic fate of prazepam (PZ), a new synthetic method of [5-14C]PZ(I) and [sidechain-14C]PZ (II) was investigated. The synthesis of these labelled compounds has already been described by E. J. Merrill, et al., but their method requires many synthetic steps and the yield is unfavorably poor. We have recently found much more convenient and efficient method, which is summarized below. 2-Iodo-4-chloroaniline was cyanized with Cu14CN obtained from K14CN, then reacted with phenylmagnesium bromide, hydrolyzed with conc. HCl to give [carbonyl-14C]2-amino-5-chloro-benzophenone(ACB). ACB was bromoacetylated, aminated with NH3 in MeOH, then heated and cyclized to [5-14C]desalkylprazepam(DPZ) according to the usual procedure. DPZ was converted to its Na salt with MeONa, then reacted with cyclopropylmethyl bromide in DMF to give I (2.61 mCi/mmol) with the overall yield of 41.9% from K14CN. [5-14C] Diazepam was also obtained by using MeI instead of cyclopropylmethyl bromide. On the other hand, 14CO2 generated from Na214CO3 and H2SO4 was reacted with cyclopropylmagnesium bromide to give [carboxyl-14C]cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, which was reduced with LiAlH4, then naphthalenesulfonylated to [alpha-14C]cyclopropylmethyl 2-naphthalenesulfonate. Na salt of DPZ was treated with the naphthalenesulfonate in DMF to give II (3.45mCi/mmol) with the overall yield of 36.9% from Na214CO3.", 
    "38": "The influence of Diazepam and Nitrazepam on the anticoagulating activity of Phenprocoumon was studied in rats. It was found that the repeated oral application of Diazepam or Nitrazepam during the treatment with Phenprocoumon did not change the adjusted prothrombin time. The prothrombin time was considerably shortened when the application of Diazepam or Nitrazepam was stopped although Phenprocoumon was still applied. Furthermore, the influence of Chlordiazepoxid, Diazepam and Nitrazepam on the normal prothrombin time was studied. It was found that the treatment with benzodiazepine derivatives had no influence upon the prothrombin time, not only during the treatment, but also after the treatment was stopped.",

Depending on the products of nitrasepam transformation formed in the animal liver, the enzymic systems providing such transformations have species peculiarities: the rat liver tissues contain nitroreductase, N-acetyl-transferase and desacetylase. And the mice tissues contain only nitroreductase and desacetylase.", 
    "40": "Ro 21-3981 is a newly synthesized water soluble benzodiazepine derivative. Its pharmacological properties are similar to diazepam. This investigation was designed to establish the effective induction dosage of Ro 21-3981 and to compare it with diazepam for induction of anaesthesia. The ED50 for Ro 21-3981 induction is 0.15 mg/kg and ED 100 is 0.2 mg/kg. Ro 21-3981 is one and one-half times as potent as diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) and more rapid in action. There is significantly less pain on injection with Ro 21-3981 as compared to diazepam. Cardiovascular stability and apnoea were observed with both drugs. Ro 21-3981 is a promising anaesthetic induction drug that merits further human study.", 
    "41": "1 To assess the potential hazards of nitrazepam therapy of insomnia in the elderly, adverse reactions to nitrazepam were studied in 2111 hospitalized medical patients who received the drug. 2 Manifestations of unwanted central nervous system (CNS) depression (such as drowsiness or 'hangover') were reported in 49 nitrazepam recipients (2.3%), and signs of unwanted CNS stimulation (such as nightmares, insomnia, agitation, etc.) in 15 (0.7%). None of the adverse reactions were considered serious. 3 Physician-rated clinical efficacy of nitrazepam was not related to dose, but the frequency of both types of adverse reactions increased significantly at higher daily doses. CNS depression also was significantly more frequent in the elderly, being reported in 11% of those aged 80 years or older, whereas the frequency of CNS stimulation was not correlated with age. 4 The effect of age on the reported rate of unwanted CNS depression was most striking at high doses. Among patients aged 80 years or over whose daily dose averaged 10 mg or more, 55% experienced unwanted CNS depression attributed to nitrazepam. 5 Low doses of nitrazepam are safe for elderly individuals, but the elderly are readily susceptible to excessive CNS depression at high doses. The findings suggest that there is little reason to exceed 5mg doses of nitrazepam for most patients, particularly those who are elderly.",

HCl and 2 related compounds, 7-chloro-1-3-dihydro-5-phenyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one-4-oxide (CBO) and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone (ACB), by high pressure liquid chromatography. The 3 compounds are separated on a reverse phase microparticulate column packing, using a mobile phase of acetonitrile and aqueous ammonium acetate. Bulk powders or capsule formulations are quantitated by direct comparison of their peak heights to those of appropriate reference standards. Data are presented showing the limit of detectability for the related compounds to be less than 80 ng CBO/ml and less than 40 ng ACB/ml. Based on peak heights, the relative standard deviation for the precision for chlordiazepoxide.HCl is 0.42%. Recoveries from laboratory-prepared samples for chlordiazepoxide.HCl were 99.4%; CBO, 102.4%; and ACB, 99.7%.", 
    "43": "A simple and convenient method for the routine determination of clonazepam in tablets by dc polarography is described. Clonazepam is extracted from the sample by ethanol and diluted with pH 4.15 acetate buffer in a volumetric flask. The filtered solution is then polarographed at the dropping mercury electrode versus the saturated calomel electrode. The polarographic wave is well developed; the determination is quantitative, precise, and accurate.", 
    "44": "A sensitive fluorescence TLC--densitometric procedure was developed for the specific determination of chlordiazepoxide (I) and its two metabolites, demoxepam (II) and desmethylchlordiazepoxide (III), in serum. After extraction from serum with ether, I, II, and II were separated by TLC and converted with a sulfuric acid spray to pale blue (Rf 0.63), green (Rf 0.54), and blue (Rf 0.45) fluorescence spots, respectively. Quantitation was accomplished by scanning the plate with a densitometer at 390 (I), 430 (II), and 390 (III) nm. The sensitivities were 0.05 (I), 0.01 (II), and 0.01 (III) microgram/ml of serum. The procedure was successfully applied to measurement of I-III in human serum after oral administration of 20 mg of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride.", 
    "45": "The effect of chronic alcoholism on oral and intramuscular plasma levels of chlordiazepoxide (CDX) was assessed. A 50-mg oral dose of CDX resulted in significantly higher plasma levels in the 2 hr following CDX than a 50-mg intramuscular dose administered to acute withdrawing alcoholic subjects. The same CDX dose was administered 7 days later and the same differences were observed between the mean oral and intramuscular plasma levels during the first 2 hr after administration of CDX. Peak concentration occurred significantly sooner after the oral than intramuscular dose of CDX in both the initial dose and the dose given a week later. It was also observed that the areas under the curve for CDX were significantly greater initially than 1 wk later. It is suggested this effect may be at least partially the result of the longer CDX half-lives initially than a week later. The active metabolite, N-desmethylchlordiazepoxide, peaked significantly earlier with the oral dose than with the intramuscular dose after the patient was alcohol free for a week.", 
    "46": "Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity has been determined before and after intramuscular injection of lidocaine, diazepam or saline in humans and lidocaine, diazepam, digoxin and saline in pigs and rabbits. Two ml volum of each of the drugs was given to humans as well as to the experimental animals. No changes in CPK activity were found after saline in humans or rabbits but a minor increase was demonstrated in pigs. A marked increase of CPK activity was demonstrated after lidocaine or diazepam in humans and after lidocaine, diazepam or digoxin in pigs and rabbits. Post mortem examination of the injection sites in the animals revealed extensive muscle tissue necrosis after lidocaine, diazepam and digoxin. No damage of the tissue was found after saline. CPK activity was also determined in rabbits receiving 2 ml of dilutions of diazepam in saline. The injection sites were examined post mortem. The CPK activity was increased in animals receiving 1:2 and 1:8 dilutions while a 1:20 dilution did not give rise to changes in the enzyme activity. The necrotic area diminished when diazepam was diluted and no pathological changes were found at the injection sites after the 1:20 dilution. Measuring the CPK activity in rabbits after an intramuscular injection seems to be a sensitive method for the determination of local toxicity.", 
    "47": "Effects of drugs used during labor and delivery on spontaneous (resting) and evoked brain electrical activity were studied in 45 normal human newborns 48 hours after delivery. Mothers received either anesthesia (general plus local) alone (group 1), anesthesia plus meperidine (group 2), anesthesia plus meperidine and promethazine (group 3), or anesthesia plus meperidine and diazepam (group 4). Autoregressive spectral analyses and subsequent stepwise discriminant analyses showed no differences in spontaneous brain electrical activity in the infants related to the type of drugs given to the mother. However, when auditory stimuli were reduced in intensity from 80 dB to 63 dB, a significant effect was found in newborn brain electrical activity between the anesthetic-only drug pattern (group 1) and the drug patterns of anesthetics with meperidine (group 2) and anesthetics with meperidine plus diazepam (group 4). The data suggest that this effect diminishes in the presence of promethazine (group 3). Evoked responses to visual, tactile, and olfactory stimuli remained unaffected.", 
    "48": "Postoperative muscle pains occurred in 16% of 25 patients given 10 mg diazepam IV 5 minutes prior to succinylcholine. Postoperative muscle pains occurred in 60% of 25 patients not given diazepam before succinylcholine. The difference is statistically significant. Diazepam reduced the severity and duration of postoperative muscle pains, as well as their frequency.", 
    "49": "The commonly used volatile anesthetics, several of their metabolites, and drugs frequently employed by the anesthesiologist were screened for mutagenicity in the Salmonella/rat-liver microsomal assay system developed by Dr. B. Ames and his colleagues. Chloral hydrate, both a sedative and metabolite of trichloroethylene, was found to be weakly mutagenic. Other compounds testing including halothane, isoflurane, methoxyflurane, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were not mutagenic. Non-volatile compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of bacterial strains with decreased capacity to repair damaged DNA. None of the compounds tested inhibited the growth of DNA-repair-deficient strains relative to a strain with normal DNA-repair. Halothane and trilene were tested for direct interaction with DNA; under the experimental conditions employed, no direct interaction of these compounds and DNA could be detected.", 
    "50": "Forty endogenously depressed patients given standard antidepressants and/or electroconvulsive therapy in a general hospital psychiatric ward were assessed using the short form of the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The patients were then randomly assigned to two groups: Under double-blind conditions, one group received in addition 20 mg diazepam per day and the other, identical placebos. No additional benzodiazepines were prescribed during the study. Standard therapy with tricyclic antidepressants or electric shock was determined by the patients' own psychiatrists. The assessments were repeated after ten days of diazepam or placebo treatment. Fourteen patients (seven in each group) also completed the Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory. Results of the Beck Depression Inventory indicated that the addition of diazepam retarded the improvement of the patients receiving only tricyclic antidepressants but had no effect on the recovery of patients receiving electroconvulsive therapy."
