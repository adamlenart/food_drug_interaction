We undertook these experiments to elucidate the mechanism for induction of c-fos and the linkage of this action to the trophic effects of gastrin. Gastrin (0.1-10 nM) dose dependently induced luciferase activity in AR42J cells transfected with a construct consisting of a luciferase reporter gene coupled to the serum response element (SRE) of the c-fos promoter. This effect was blocked by the specific CCK-B receptor antagonist D2 but not by the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 or by pertussis toxin, indicating that gastrin targets the SRE via specific CCK-B receptors through a mechanism independent of Gi. Inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) either by prolonged (24 h) exposure of the cells to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (100 nM) or by incubation with the selective inhibitor GF-109203X (3.5 microM) resulted in an 80% reduction in luciferase activity. Similar results were observed in the presence of the specific extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD-98059 (50 microM). We measured ERK2 activity in AR42J cells via in-gel kinase assays and observed that gastrin (1 pM-100 nM) induced ERK2 enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner. Addition of GF-109203X and PD-98059, either alone or in combination, produced, respectively, partial and total inhibition of gastrin-induced ERK2 activity. Gastrin induction of ERK2 activity also resulted in a threefold increase in the transcriptional activity of Elk-1, a factor known to bind to the c-fos SRE and to be phosphorylated and activated by ERK2. PD-98059 blocked the growth-promoting effect of gastrin on the AR42J cells, demonstrating that this effect depends on activation of MEK. Our data lead us to conclude that the trophic actions of gastrin are mediated by ERK2-induced c-fos gene expression via PKC-dependent and -independent pathways.", 
    "1": "Quantitative electroencephalographic parameters and saccadic eye movements are frequently used as pharmacodynamic measures of benzodiazepine effect. We investigated the relationship between these measures and the hypnotic effect.", 
    "2": "The correlation between the pharmacodynamic measures and sleep quality was determined in 21 patients with primary insomnia. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships were characterized after administration of 20 mg oral temazepam. The hypnotic effect was determined on the basis of polysomnographic sleep recordings and a subjective sleep evaluation questionnaire. Correlations between pharmacodynamic measures and the improvement of sleep were investigated.", 
    "3": "The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships for the parameters derived from electroencephalography and saccadic eye movements showed considerable interindividual variability. Administration of temazepam led to a significant improvement in the objective parameters sleep period efficiency, wake time after sleep onset, and sleep efficiency and in the subjective assessment of sleep quality. No significant correlations were observed between the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic-derived parameters and the improvement in objective or subjective sleep parameters.", 
    "4": "In subjects with primary insomnia the administration of 20 mg oral temazepam results in changes in both the pharmacodynamic measures and in quality of sleep. No individual correlations between the pharmacodynamic measures and quality of sleep were observed. We concluded that the investigated pharmacodynamic measures are of value in the first assessment of clinical efficacy and for the selection of the dose(s) to be investigated in subsequent trials that aim at showing clinical efficacy. However, the conclusive quantification of clinical efficacy should be performed only on the basis of the clinical end point itself.", 
    "5": "Properties of carbachol-induced oscillatory activity in rat hippocampus. J. Neurophysiol. 78: 2631-2640, 1997. The recent resurgence of interest in carbachol oscillations as an in vitro model of theta rhythm in the hippocampus prompted us to evaluate the circuit mechanisms involved. In extracellular recordings, a regularly spaced bursting pattern of field potentials was observed in both CA3 and CA1 subfields in the presence of carbachol. Removal of the CA3 region abolished oscillatory activity observed in CA1, suggesting that the oscillatory generator is located in CA3. An alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), blocked carbachol oscillations, indicating that AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents are necessary for the population oscillation. Moreover, the spread of oscillatory activity into CA1 required intact N-methyl--aspartate receptors. These data are more consistent with epileptiform bursting than with theta rhythm described in vivo. In the presence of carbachol, individual CA3 pyramidal cells exhibited a slow, rhythmic intrinsic oscillation that was not blocked by DNQX and that was enhanced by membrane hyperpolarization. We hypothesize that this slower oscillation is the fundamental oscillator that participates in triggering the population oscillation by exciting multiple synaptically connected CA3 neurons. gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptors are not necessary for carbachol to elicit synchronous CA3 field events but are essential to the bursting pattern observed. Neither GABAB nor metabotropic glutamate receptors appear to be necessary for carbachol oscillations. However, both nicotinic and M1 and M3 muscarinic cholinergic receptors contribute to the generation of this activity. These results establish the local circuit elements and neurotransmitter receptors that contribute to carbachol-induced oscillations and indicate that carbachol-induced oscillations are fundamentally distinct from theta rhythm in vivo.", 
    "6": "A sensitive gas chromatographic method for the determination of the quinoline alkaloid viridicatin, a fungal metabolite isolated from several Penicillium species and presumably a biogenetic precursor to naturally occurring diazepam-like 1,4-benzo-diazepines, has been developed. Prior to conversion of viridicatin into a volatile trimethylsilyl derivative, a rapid sample clean-up was accomplished by solid-phase extraction from mould mycelium on a C18 cartridge. Using synthetical 6-bromo-viridicatin as an internal standard, the amount of viridicatin produced de novo in emerged grown cultures of Penicillium cyclopium strain SM 72 was calculated in correlation to the duration of mould cultivation.", 
    "7": "The effects of premedication with midazolam (M), fentanyl (F), or both (B) on induction of anesthesia via a mask with sevoflurane (S) were assessed in 24 healthy volunteers who participated on three occasions, receiving either intravenous (IV) F (2.4 microg/kg), M (36 microg/kg), or B (0.6 microg/kg F, 9 microg/kg M) 5 min before three vital capacity breaths of 8% S, 66% N2O, and O2. At loss of lid-lash reflex (LLR), ventilation was manually assisted until a randomly assigned time of administration was attained, at which time laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation were attempted. The effective times for 50% of subjects (ET50) to loss of LLR were 64 s for M and B and 54 s for F (P < 0.05). The ET50 to acceptable intubating conditions were 4.3, 3.1 and 2.5 min for F, M, and B, respectively. F resulted in more airway management difficulties than M or B. Heart rate was slightly increased before intubation in M. Heart rate increases after intubation were least in F, intermediate in B, and greatest in M. The time to achieve good intubating and airway conditions up to intubation was lowest with M or B. Anesthetic adjuvants did not improve the time to achieve loss of consciousness with anesthetic induction via the face mask with sevoflurane, but they significantly decreased the time to acceptable tracheal intubating conditions.",

    "9": "Patient-specific factors and knowledge of drug therapy direct CS and analgesia practices for oncology patients undergoing interventional radiologic techniques. Nurses caring for oncology patients in this setting must understand the effects of cancer on anatomic structures and physiologic functions. Variability in responses to pain and drug therapy observed among oncology patients necessitates the need for highly individualized plans of care that sometimes deviate from standard CS and analgesia procedures. Therefore, sedation and analgesia policies that apply to oncology patients must include flexible dose ranges for drugs such as opioids and benzodiazepines and guidelines for titrating these drugs to optimal effects. Although frequent assessments of pain using subjective reports remain the most valid indicators of adequate pain control, familiarity with radiologic interventions and responses of anatomic structures to various types of noxious stimuli allows the nurse to anticipate aspects of procedures known to be painful. Attention to symptom management both during and after the procedure is critical because patients with progressive cancer may present with significant physical and psychological alterations. In summary, CS and analgesia practices for oncology patients are based on sound pharmacologic principles and influenced by myriad factors that can be considered only in the context of the patient's own uniqueness and experiences.", 
    "10": "The intent of this article is to be a comprehensive, but by no means exhaustive, review of some of the agents used for CS. The major classes and their principal uses are presented: benzodiazepines, for sedation-hypnosis, anxiolysis, and, in the case of midazolam, amnesia; and opiates, for analgesia and sedation. Also included are the miscellaneous items etomidate and propofol, for sedation-hypnosis; ketamine, for sedation and analgesia; and the phenothiazines and butyrophenones. One should consider how the interactions between and among these agents can be used for the benefit of the patient undergoing CS, and also the danger in combining agents and the necessity of constant monitoring. The reporting of ADEs is a recurring theme, the value of which cannot be overemphasized in modern medical practice, not only to satisfy accreditation requirements but also to ensure patient safety and improve therapeutic choices of medications.", 
    "11": "The incidence of alcohol dependence/abuse in patients of a general health care facility is 35-50%. The diagnosis and treatment of patients experiencing or at risk of alcohol withdrawal is problematic. The admitting diagnosis is usually another medical condition, illness or injury. Signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal is complicated by pre-existing conditions. In an attempt to improve the quality of care, decrease the length of stay of these patients, and decrease demands on nursing staff, a protocol for intervention and treatment of alcohol withdrawal was developed on the orthopedic ward of Royal University Hospital. The protocol enables each nurse to assess. Intervene and initiate the proper referrals. The recognized tool of assessment used to identify at risk patients is the CAGE questionnaire. The Clinical Institute WithDrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale is used to determine when it is appropriate to use Benzodiazepines. General nursing considerations are addressed through a pre-printed care plan. Nurses refer to social work, Alcoholics Anonymous and make use of available resource material. The protocol enables nurses to provide safe and effective care with few associated costs. Except for mass immunization, there is no other single intervention in health care that has the same far reaching consequences (Sullivan, 1995).", 
    "12": "The effect of chronic lithium pretreatment on physostigmine-induced yawning was investigated in male rats. Intraperitoneal administration of physostigmine to rats induced yawning in a biphasic manner. However the maximum response was obtained by 0.2 mg/kg of the drug. Intracerebroventricular administrations of a putative M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor antagonists, pirenzepine and methoctramine decreased physostigmine-induced yawning. Intraperitoneal administration of a non-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine, also decreased the physostigmine-induced yawning significantly. Chronic lithium pretreatment (30 days) reduced yawning induced by physostigmine. The inhibitory effect of pirenzepine, methoctramine and atropine on physostigmine-induced yawning increased in rats pretreated with chronic lithium. These findings indicate that yawning is induced by a central cholinergic mechanism and that chronic pretreatment of lithium may interact with the cholinergic-induced behaviour.", 
    "13": "This paper proposes a three phase \"model\" of the neuropharmacological processes responsible for the seizures and neuropathology produced by nerve agent intoxication. Initiation and early expression of the seizures are cholinergic phenomenon; anticholinergics readily terminate seizures at this stage and no neuropathology is evident. However, if not checked, a transition phase occurs during which the neuronal excitation of the seizure per se perturbs other neurotransmitter systems: excitatory amino acid (EAA) levels increase reinforcing the seizure activity; control with anticholinergics becomes less effective; mild neuropathology is occasionally observed. With prolonged epileptiform activity the seizure enters a predominantly non-cholinergic phase: it becomes refractory to some anticholinergics; benzodiazepines and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists remain effective as anticonvulsants, but require anticholinergic co-administration; mild neuropathology is evident in multiple brain regions. Excessive influx of calcium due to repeated seizure-induced depolarization and prolonged stimulation of NMDA receptors is proposed as the ultimate cause of neuropathology. The model and data indicate that rapid and aggressive management of seizures is essential to prevent neuropathology from nerve agent exposure.", 
    "14": "When rats were made tolerant to the benzodiazepine tranquilizer chlordiazepoxide (CDPX) by its steady administration, a particular gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor in cerebral cortex was modified. Its rate of desensitization in the absence of CDPX was enhanced (3-fold with 10 microM GABA) below saturation with GABA, and the dependence of this rate on GABA concentration was changed from sigmoid to hyperbolic. This mimicked the effect of the presence of CDPX on desensitization of the naive receptor. This receptor has been characterized by its rapid desensitization (t1/2 = 30 msec at saturation). In contrast, a different, slower desensitizing GABAA receptor, on the same membrane, was unaffected, and the initial transmembrane halide exchange rate of the faster desensitizing receptor was unaltered. In the presence of CDPX, the initial halide exchange rate of the modified receptor was enhanced, but the already enhanced desensitization rate was not altered. During chronic presence of CDPX and the development of tolerance, the total signal due to this receptor remained constant at the value before exposure. After discontinuation, the total signal decreased but could be restored to the original value by the presence of CDPX. It was postulated that dependence and withdrawal syndromes result from a decreased ratio of initial chloride flux rate to desensitization rate, caused by an increase in desensitization. The contribution of this effect in vivo would depend on desensitization making a contribution to signal termination [or the fraction of receptors that are inactive (desensitized)]. In the quench flow experiments, the total signal due to this receptor from naive rat did not depend much on GABA concentration or the presence of CDPX because the result of increased channel opening was counterbalanced by increased desensitization. In contrast, the total signal of this receptor from tolerant rat was significantly increased by CDPX or increased GABA concentration. Differences between these experiments and measurements reported with other drugs could be explained if, in those experiments, the halide exchange rate, as well as its desensitization rate, retained an enhanced value in the absence of the drug.", 
    "15": "Several agents may treat cocaine addiction and toxicity including bromocriptine, desipramine, GBR 12909 [1-(2-(bis(4-fluorphenyl)-methoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenyl-propyl) piperazine], diazepam, buprenorphine and dizocilpine. In this study, we sought to determine whether these specific therapeutic agents alter cardiovascular responses to cocaine in conscious rats. Arterial pressure responses to cocaine (5 mg/kg, i.v.) were similar in all rats whereas cardiac output responses varied widely. In 26 of 33 rats (named vascular responders), cocaine induced a decrease in cardiac output of 8% or more. The remaining rats with little change or an increase in cardiac output were classified as mixed responders. Pretreatment with bromocriptine (0.1 mg/kg) or desipramine (1 mg/kg) increased cardiac output in mixed responders and increased systemic vascular resistance in vascular responders similar to the differential effects noted with cocaine. GBR 12909 (0.5-10 mg/kg) elicited a decrease in cardiac output at higher doses. Diazepam (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) had small, short-lasting effects on cardiovascular parameters. Buprenorphine (0.3 mg/kg) or the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartic acid) receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (0.05 mg/kg), increased arterial pressure, heart rate and cardiac output in vascular responders. Bromocriptine and desipramine prevented the difference in cardiac output responses in vascular and mixed responders by reducing the cocaine-induced decrease in cardiac output in vascular responders. Pretreatment with GBR 12909 (1 mg/kg) had little effect on cardiovascular responses to cocaine except to depress the increase in cardiac output noted in mixed responders. Buprenorphine selectively enhanced the increase in systemic vascular resistance whereas dizocilpine enhanced the pressor response. These data suggest that several treatment regimens for cocaine addiction alter the cardiovascular responses to cocaine and that dopamine D2 receptor activation may be necessary for the decrease in cardiac output noted in vascular responders.", 
    "16": "The radiochemical synthesis and pharmacological properties are described of [3H]RY 80 (ethyl-8-acetylene-5, 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a][1, 4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate, [ethyl-3H]). This compound is one of a series of 8-substituted imidazobenzodiazepines that exhibits both high affinity and selectivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors containing alpha-5 subunits. Saturable, high-affinity (Kd approximately 0.7 nM) binding of [3H]RY 80 was observed in hippocampal membranes. The maximum number (Bmax) of [3H]RY 80 binding sites was approximately 18% of that obtained with [3H]flunitrazepam, a radioligand that labels all \"diazepam-sensitive\" GABAA receptors. This value is consistent with previous estimates (10-20%) of the proportion of rat hippocampal GABAA receptors containing alpha-5 subunits determined by immunoprecipitation with selective antibodies and competition experiments using an alpha-5-selective ligand. In recombinant GABAA receptors composed of alpha-5 beta-3 gamma-2 subunits, the Kd of [3H]RY 80 (approximately 0.5 nM) was consistent with the value obtained in hippocampus, whereas the Bmax value was not significantly different from that obtained with [3H]flunitrazepam. The potencies of several benzodiazepine site ligands to inhibit [3H]RY 80 binding to hippocampal membranes were in agreement with the values obtained in recombinant (alpha-5 beta-3 gamma-2) GABAA receptors. [3H]RY 80 was used both in a \"GABA shift\" assay to correctly predict the in vivo actions of a novel, alpha-5-selective ligand and to characterize a population of GABAA receptors containing alpha-5 subunits in neonatal rat cortex. These findings demonstrate that [3H]RY 80 can be used as a radioligand to examine the properties of GABAA receptors containing alpha-5 subunits.", 
    "17": "This retrospective study includes 65 children treated for status epilepticus at Tampere University Hospital in Finland. Aetiology of the condition, effectiveness of the treatment protocol, including short barbiturate anaesthesia to prevent prolonged status epilepticus episodes, and neurological outcome were evaluated. Symptomatic aetiology was present in 40% of status epilepticus episodes, and 37% of episodes were induced by fever. Neurological sequelae secondary to status epilepticus were identified in 15% of the cases and subsequent epilepsy in 23% during the mean follow-up time of 3.6 years. There were no status epilepticus-related deaths. The cut-off point of status epilepticus duration for significant risk for permanent neurological sequelae was 2 hours. Our treatment protocol, including short barbiturate anaesthesia in refractory cases, was able to abort status epilepticus in less than 2 hours in 75% of cases. We conclude that early and prompt use of barbiturate anaesthesia should be encouraged, and may explain our low morbidity figures.", 
    "18": "As the world's population ages, increasing numbers of patients with dementia can be expected, the signs and symptoms of which can be extremely disruptive. In particular, behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia reduce the quality of life of carers (usually family members) and increase the cost of care. Conventional neuroleptics have been used for many years in the management of disturbed and disruptive demented patients, although there are few well-controlled clinical trials demonstrating their efficacy. The use of the low-potency neuroleptics is associated with orthostatic hypotension, cardiac toxicity, anticholinergic side effects and daytime sedation. The high-potency neuroleptics tend to cause extrapyramidal side effects and akathisia. Clozapine although less likely to cause extrapyramidal symptoms than conventional neuroleptics, can cause orthostatic hypotension and requires continual blood monitoring. Early-phase open trials suggest that risperidone is efficacious in patients with behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia and that it has a low side-effects profile. Further trials are needed to confirm this, but it is likely that the newer antipsychotics, as typified by risperidone, will lead to safer and more effective management of patients with the disruptive and costly behavioral and psychological signs and symptoms of dementia. Non-pharmacologic interventions may also provide benefit, though controls are rare.", 
    "19": "Pharmacological analyses of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor subtypes have suggested that both the alpha and gamma subunits, but not the beta subunit, contribute to the benzodiazepine binding site. We took advantage of the different pharmacological properties conferred by the inclusion of different gamma subunits in the receptor macromolecule to identify amino acids gamma2Phe77 and gamma2Met130 as key determinants of the benzodiazepine binding site. gamma2Phe77 was required for high affinity binding of the benzodiazepine site ligands flumazenil, CL218,872, and methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate but not flunitrazepam. This amino acid was, however, required for allosteric modulation by flunitrazepam, as well as other benzodiazepine site ligands. In contrast, gamma2Met130 was required for high affinity binding of flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and triazolam but not flumazenil, CL218, 872, or methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and did not affect benzodiazepine efficacy. Introduction of the phenylalanine and methionine into the appropriate positions of gamma1 was not sufficient to confer high affinity for the benzodiazepine site ligand zolpidem. These data show that gamma2Phe77 and gamma2Met130 are necessary for high affinity binding of a number of benzodiazepine site ligands. Although most previous studies have focused on the contribution of the alpha subunit, we demonstrated a critical role for the gamma subunit at the benzodiazepine binding site, indicating that this modulatory site is located at the interface of these two subunits. Furthermore, gamma2Phe77 is homologous to alpha1Phe64, which has been previously shown to be a key determinant of the GABA binding site, suggesting a conservation of motifs between different ligand binding sites on the GABAA receptor.", 
    "20": "In the thalamus, paradoxical changes in response to augmentation of inhibition can occur as a result of either cellular or network effects. Clonazepam, a GABA(A) agonist, produces a paradoxical reduction in evoked thalamocortical neuron inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in thalamic slice. This has been hypothesized to be a result of augmentation in inhibitory to inhibitory connections. In a computer model, orthodromic simulation produced an increase in initial IPSP, a result contrary to that found experimentally. This failure was traced to the inability of orthodromic activation to produce fast enough recurrent inhibition to alter initial reticularis neuron firing. Simulated antidromic stimulation was able to reduce this initial spike train and reproduced the experimental finding.", 
    "21": "To understand the properties of benzodiazepine receptor in the neostriatum, we examined the potentiating effects of diazepam, triazolam and brotizolam on the GABA(A) receptor-mediated Cl- current in dissociated rat neostriatal neurones using the nystatin-perforated patch recording configuration. Neurones were classified into large and small neurones, on their somatic size. In the large neurones, which are putative cholinergic interneurones, all the benzodiazepine receptor agonists recognized a single effective site. However, in the small neurones, which are mostly considered to be projecting neurones, the effect of brotizolam was best described when two effective sites were assumed. Therefore, the properties of benzodiazepine receptor differed among large and small neurones while at least two kinds of functional binding sites were also found to exist in small neurones.", 
    "22": "In vibratome-cut slices from rat striatum and in the presence of 10 mM LiCl, the cholinergic agonist carbachol stimulated the accumulation of total [3H]inositol phosphates (EC50 11+/-1 microM and maximum effect 546+/-36% of basal). The response to 100 microM carbachol (497+/-24% of basal) was inhibited by muscarinic antagonists (1 microM), the rank order of efficacy being 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP; 100% inhibition) approximately pirenzepine (98+/-3%) > p-fluoro analog of hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pFHHSiD; 90+/-3%) > methoctramine (32+/-7%) approximately tropicamide (30+/-10%). Antagonist inhibition curves best fit to a single-site model for 4-DAMP (pKi 8.9+/-0.2) whereas, for both pirenzepine and pFHHSiD, the best fit was to the two-site model. The pKi values for the high-affinity (8.3+/-0.2) and low-affinity (6.9+/-0.2) components for pirenzepine-mediated inhibition corresponded to those reported for M1 and M3 receptors, respectively. The pKi values for the high-affinity (8.2+/-0.3) and low-affinity (7.0+/-0.2) components for pFHHSiD inhibition were in good agreement with those reported for M3 and M1 receptors, respectively. Altogether these results indicate that carbachol-induced [3H]inositol phosphate formation in rat striatal slices is mediated by both M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "23": "Recurring episodes of stupor in adults have been shown to be related to increased levels of endozepines, which are endogenous ligands for the GABAA receptors. We report here two children presenting with recurrent episodes of stupor associated with fast EEG activity who had increased levels of endozepine-4 in plasma. Mass spectroscopy did not reveal commercially available benzodiazepines. Interictal endozepine-4 levels were normal. In one of the patients, administration of flumazenil (0.25 mg i.v.), a benzodiazepine inverse agonist, induced improvement of consciousness and attenuation of EEG fast activity. In conclusion, children presenting with recurrent episodes of stupor and EEG fast activity should be evaluated for endozepine levels and can be effectively treated with i.v. flumazenil.",

The trachea was intubated with an endotracheal tube (ID 7 mm) that had a second lumen for insertion of a superfine fibreoptic bronchoscope (OD 2.2 mm) to measure the bronchial cross-sectional area (BCA) continuously. The tip of the bronchoscope was placed at the level of the second or third bronchial bifurcation of the right bronchus. A videoprinter printed the BCA which was then measured with a NIH image program. Bronchoconstriction was produced with histamine (H) 10 micrograms.kg-1 followed by 500 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1. Thirty minutes later, 0 [saline], 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg.kg-1 midazolam and 25 micrograms.kg-1 flumazenil were given.

    "28": "Using an isolated rat stomach infusion model, we investigated the role of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and acetylcholine in the secretion of gastrin (which plays a major role in gastric acid secretion), and the relationship between gastrin secretion and stomach pH. Bombesin, which has a structure analogous to that of GRP, was used in the experiment. We also investigated whether acetylcholine has muscarine-like or nicotine-like action. Our findings pointed to the presence of an alternative, GRP-mediated, route for stimulating gastric secretion from G cells, other than the acetylcholine-mediated route. We injected bombesin to confirm the presence of such a GRP-mediated route; significantly increased gastrin secretion was observed, even under acidic conditions, in the gastric lumen, which has been considered to show almost no gastric secretion. This secretion was not inhibited by atropine. The results suggested that there are two routes for inducing gastrin secretion from G cells: an acetylcholine-mediated route and a GRP-mediated route (intramural peptide neurons). As GRP induced gastrin secretion, regardless of stomach pH, GRP was considered to be more closely related to gastrin secretion. The results also suggested that a muscarine-like action, particularly in the M3 receptor-mediated route, plays a significant role in acetylcholine-mediated gastrin secretion and that nicotine-like action is not involved in gastrin secretion.", 
    "29": "It is not yet clear if benzodiazepine receptor ligands, implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatic coma, also have a role in subclinical cognitive or neurophysiological alterations in cirrhotic patients. Therefore, we carried out a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, on brainstem auditory evoked responses and on the number connection test in cirrhotic patients with subclinical neurophysiological or cognitive alterations. Thirteen cirrhotic subjects with subclinical neurophysiological or cognitive alterations were studied. A total of 3 mg of flumazenil or saline was infused intravenously. Before and after the infusion, the number connection test was administered and brainstem auditory evoked responses recorded. After 72 h, patients were crossed over. Flumazenil did not influence brainstem auditory evoked responses or the number connection test. A screening test for benzodiazepines was negative in all subjects. We conclude that benzodiazepine receptor ligands have a negligible role, if any, in the pathophysiology of subclinical neurophysiological or cognitive alterations of cirrhotic patients.", 
    "30": "Changes in GABA function have been postulated to be involved in alcohol tolerance, withdrawal and addiction. In this study we measured regional brain metabolic responses to lorazepam, to indirectly assess GABA function (benzodiazepines facilitate GABAergic neurotransmission), in alcoholics during early and late withdrawal. Brain metabolism was measured using PET and 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose after placebo (baseline) and after lorazepam (30 micrograms/kg intravenously) in 10 alcoholics and 16 controls. In the alcoholics evaluations were performed 2 to 3 weeks after detoxification and were repeated 6 to 8 weeks later. Controls were also evaluated twice at a 6 to 8 weeks interval. While during the initial evaluation metabolism was significantly lower for most brain regions in the alcoholics than in controls in the repeated evaluation the only significant differences were in cingulate and orbitofrontal cortex. Lorazepam-induced decrements in metabolism did not change with protracted alcohol withdrawal and the magnitude of these changes were similar in controls and alcoholics except for a trend towards a blunted response to lorazepam in orbitofrontal cortex in alcoholics during the second evaluation. Abnormalities in orbitofrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus in alcoholics are unlikely to be due to withdrawal since they persist 8 to 11 weeks after detoxification. The fact that there was only a trend of significance for an abnormal response to lorazepam in orbitofrontal cortex indicates that mechanisms other than GABA are involved in the brain metabolic abnormalities observed in alcoholic subjects.",

This protein has been found to copurify with two other mitochondrial proteins, namely the outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also known as mitochondrial porin, and the inner membrane adenine nucleotide carrier. In vitro reconstitution experiments suggested that the PBR was a multimeric complex in which the isoquinoline binding site was on the Mr 18,000 subunit, denoted pk18, whereas the benzodiazepine binding site required the association of this subunit with VDAC to be expressed. Untransformed cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are devoid of specific binding sites for isoquinolines and benzodiazepines, whereas yeast cells transformed with a pk18-expressing vector exhibit RO5-4864 and PK11195 binding sites that are pharmacologically identical to those of the PBR. To clarify the role of VDAC and of the adenine nucleotide carrier, if any, in the constitution of the benzodiazepine binding site, yeast host strains were constructed in which the corresponding genes had been knocked out. Mitochondria prepared from pk18-producing cells devoid of either VDAC or adenine nucleotide carrier exhibit both benzodiazepine and isoquinoline carboxamide binding sites with little or no change in the Kd values as compared with the wild-type background. These results rule out the contention that VDAC is indispensable for establishing the benzodiazepine binding site and are in agreement with the hypothesis that the Mr 18,000 subunit carries both the isoquinoline carboxamide and benzodiazepine binding domains.", 
    "32": "It was previously believed that the neuronal type of nitric oxide (NO) synthase was constitutive in nature, and that changes in the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ represent the sole input that regulates its activity. Recent reports, however, suggested that this enzyme could also be induced under certain conditions. We report here that prolonged stimulation of M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors results in potentiation of maximal receptor-mediated activation of neuronal NO synthase in Chinese hamster ovary cells. This effect was dependent on the concentration of agonist during the treatment and was abolished by a muscarinic receptor antagonist. These findings are important for understanding the sequelae of prolonged administration of muscarinic agonists in vivo.",

The prevalence of benzodiazepine dependence was 11.4% (N = 16); the prevalence of alcohol dependence was 8.6% (N = 12); and the prevalence of prescription narcotic dependence was 1.4% (N = 2). These findings suggest that substance use disorders in the geriatric psychiatry outpatient population exist to a significantly greater extent than previously reported. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize patients with benzodiazepine dependence, alcohol dependence, and no substance use disorder. These groups were compared on demographic and clinical variables using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-squared statistical techniques. Clinicians working in comparable outpatient settings may be in a better position to prevent, detect, and treat substance use disorders in their patients as a result of increased awareness of its epidemiologic characteristics in this population.", 
    "35": "The neurochemical consequences of aversive behavior based on novelty, rat social interaction, have been assessed in various rat brain regions utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with an electrochemical detector (HPLC-ECD) technique. The present studies indicated that compared to animals from the home cage, those exposed to the high-light aversive unfamiliar test condition, had significantly increased levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the metabolite of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), in the tested brain regions including amygdala, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, tuberculum olfactorium, hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, and striatum. The levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), the metabolites of dopamine (DA), were increased in tuberculum olfactorium, nucleus accumbens, and striatum. When compared to the low-light familiar test condition (LF), the levels, following exposure to the highlight unfamiliar situation, of 5-HIAA were significantly increased in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, tuberculum olfactorium, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens, while the 5-HIAA levels remained unchanged in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and striatum. The DOPAC and HVA levels were also increased by the HU situation in the amygdala, tuberculum olfactorium, and nucleus accumbens. An increase was also found for the levels of DA in the amygdala. Such effects were prevented by diazepam or the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. It is concluded that the aversive test condition of the social interaction test (HU) increases 5-HT and DA turnover throughout the rat brain. Such effects might be related to the sensitivity to novel anxiolytic drug of the social interaction test.",

The effects were less marked after 3 and 6 weeks of treatment (10 mg/kg/day), indicating that some tolerance had developed, but a significant anxiolytic effect still remained. After 3 weeks of diazepam treatment (2 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), tolerance developed to the anxiolytic effects, and there was an anxiogenic response 24 h after withdrawal. In contrast, there were no anxiogenic withdrawal effects 24 h after 3 weeks or 24, 48 or 72 h after 6 weeks treatment with CGP 49823 (10 mg/kg/day). These results suggest that the compound may prove to be a useful anxiolytic and that substance P may play a role in mediating states of anxiety.",

Systolic blood pressure from the initial incision to CPB was lower in the isoflurane group compared with the midazolam group. During this interval, ketanserin was required in nine patients from the midazolam group at a mean dose of 26 mg, compared with only one patient in the isoflurane group. During and after CPB, there was no difference in ketanserin and in vasopressive/inotropic agent requirements. Temporary cessation of midazolam was required in four patients, for a mean of 34 minutes; whereas isoflurane was stopped in 10 patients for 36 minutes, mostly in the post-CPB period. Time to awakening and to extubation in the midazolam group (217 minutes and 19.5 hours) and the isoflurane group (193 minutes and 18.2 hours) were comparable.

Both AMPA- and kainate-induced [Ca2+]i increases could be blocked completely by the AMPA receptor-selective antagonist LY300168 (50 microM). However, following treatment with concanavalin A, an inhibitor of kainate receptor desensitisation, 30% of cells showed a kainate-induced [Ca2+]i rise of >100 nM in the presence of LY300168. Responses to 30 microM kainate in the presence of LY300168 were virtually abolished by the AMPA and GluR5 kainate receptor competitive antagonist LY293558 (100 microM). These results demonstrate the presence of functional kainate receptors on cultured cerebellar granule cells, and suggest that the GluR5 subtype of kainate receptor plays a significant role in kainate receptor-mediated [Ca2+]i increases.", 
    "56": "Recent innovations in mass spectrometry (MS) have led to the development of instruments with increased capabilities, smaller footprints, and relatively low cost. The traditional MS in most toxicology laboratories is a quadrupole system equipped with electron impact ionization. Recently, an ion trap with electron impact, positive chemical ionization, negative chemical ionization, and tandem MS capabilities was introduced by Finnigan MAT. This paper compares the sensitivity and precision of ion-ratio measurements between a Finnigan GCQ ion-trap mass spectrometer (ITMS) and a Hewlett Packard quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS) using electron impact ionization with diazepam as the model compound. Additionally, the sensitivity and precision of ion ratio measurements are evaluated for the ITMS using positive chemical ionization, negative chemical ionization and tandem MS modes of analysis. In the full scan mode (m/z 50-650, 1 Hz), the ITMS had an average signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 1400 for a 2-ng injection of diazepam (10 injections per day for 5 days), within-run ion ratio precision had coefficients of variation from 5 to 11%. Using similar full scan conditions, a 10-ng injection of diazepam on the QMS had an average S/N ratio of 160, and precision of ion ratio measurements varied from 5 to 13%. In the selected ion mode (SIM) of analysis (three ions, 2 Hz), the ITMS had an average S/N of 14,000 for a 2-ng injection and ion-ratio precision ranging from 6 to 15%. Using similar SIM conditions, a 2-ng injection in the QMS had an average S/N of 3000 with ion ratio standard deviations of 0.67 to 2.9%. Overall, the ITMS provided at greater S/N, equivalent precision in full scan, but was 5- to 10-fold less precise in measuring ion ratios in the SIM mode as compared with the QMS.", 
    "57": "NNC 13-8241 has recently been labelled with iodine-123 and developed as a metabolically stable benzodiazepine receptor ligand for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in monkeys and man. NNC 13-8199 is a bromo-analogue of NNC 13-8241. This partial agonist binds selectively and with subnanomolar affinity to the benzodiazepine receptors. We prepared 76Br labelled NNC 13-8199 from the trimethyltin precursor by the chloramine-T method. Carbon-11 labelled NNC 13-8199 was synthesised by N-alkylation of the nitrogen of the amide group with [11C]methyl iodide. Positron emission tomography (PET) examination with the two radioligands in monkeys demonstrated a high uptake of radioactivity in the occipital, temporal and frontal cortex. In the study with [76Br]NNC 13-8199, the monkey brain uptake continued to increase until the time of displacement with flumazenil at 215 min after injection. For both radioligands the radioactivity in the cortical brain regions was markedly reduced after displacement with flumazenil. More than 98% of the radioactivity in monkey plasma represented unchanged radioligand 40 min after injection. The low degree of metabolism indicates that NNC 13-8199 is metabolically much more stable than hitherto developed PET radioligands for imaging of benzodiazepine receptors in the primate brain. [76Br]NNC 13-8199 has potential as a radioligand in human PET studies using models where a slow metabolism is an advantage.", 
    "58": "1. Miniature IPSCs recorded from cultured murine cerebellar granule cells increased in half-width and amplitude following application of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) Flunitrazepam (Flu, 1 microM). The increase in the half-width was much greater than that in the amplitude. 2. Five-millisecond applications of 1 mM GABA to nucleated outside-out patches elicited rapidly rising biexponentially decaying responses that resembled IPSCs. Flu had no effect on the amplitude of such responses, but consistently slowed their deactivation by approximately 50%. This effect was reversed by Flu washout or application of the BDZ antagonist Ro15-1788. The partial inverse agonist. Ro15-4513 speeded deactivation and depressed peak current amplitude by 23 +/- 12%. 3. The EC50 for GABA was between 45 and 50 microM. At submaximally effective agonist concentrations, Flu increased response amplitude and slowed response deactivation. Both effects were present in all cells taken from young cultures (4-7 days in vitro) but the latter was absent in 55% of the neurones obtained from older cultures (14-27 days in vitro). 4. With 120 ms applications of 20 microM GABA, responses activated monoexponentially (time constant, 39.8 +/- 2.8 ms) and deactivated biexponentially (time constants, 40.4 +/- 2.1 and 251 +/- 15 ms). Application of Flu slowed both activation and deactivation. The latter effect arose from an increased contribution of the slower component of decay. 5. Desensitization of responses to 1 mM GABA was biexponential, with time constants of 47 +/- 11 and 479 +/- 49 ms. Flu speeded desensitization by decreasing both fast and slow time constants. GABAA receptor desensitization consistently slowed subsequent deactivation. No significant relationship between the level of desensitization and the amount of slowing of deactivation produced by Flu was found. 6. Responses to paired 5 ms applications of 1 mM GABA indicated that the slowing of deactivation and the speeding of desensitization produced by Flu combine to generate a marked frequency dependence in the actions of this BDZ. Thus when compared with control responses, GABA-induced charge transfer was only enhanced by Flu during the first of two successive agonist applications.", 
    "59": "The worldwide expansion in the use of benzodiazepines has led to their frequent, and often inappropriate, use and to increase in their involvement in self-induced poisoning and iatrogenic overdosing. Flumazenil is a specific and competitive antagonist at the central benzodiazepine receptor, reversing all effects of benzodiazepine agonists without tranquillising or anticonvulsant actions. Incremental intravenous bolus injections of flumazenil 0.1 to 0.3 mg are the most effective and well tolerated in the diagnosis and treatment of pure benzodiazepine overdose; additional boluses or an infusion (0.3 to 0.5 mg/h) can be given to prevent patients from relapsing into coma. Intravenous flumazenil 10 to 20 micrograms/kg is effective in neonates and small children. Intramuscular, oral (20 to 25 mg 3 times daily or as required) and rectal administration may be used as alternatives in long term regimens. Patients with mixed-drug overdose require higher doses (up to 2 mg bolus, approximately equal to 1 mg/h infusion) to regain consciousness. Children and the elderly, chronically ill patients, and pregnant women and their fetuses all respond satisfactorily to flumazenil, but the usefulness of the drug in patients with hepatic encephalopathy and alcohol overdose is debatable. The use of flumazenil results in complete awakening with restoration of upper airway protective reflexes, thus enabling gastric lavage to be performed and transfer of the patient from the emergency room to another hospital department. Resumption of effective spontaneous respiration allows for expeditious extubation, weaning off mechanical ventilation or the avoidance of endotracheal intubation. While flumazenil is not associated with haemodynamic adverse effects, caution should be exercised when using this agent in patients who have co-ingested chloral hydrate to carbamazepine or whose ECG shows abnormalities typical to those seen after overdose with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); the use of flumazenil in the presence of these drugs can sometimes induce treatable cardiac dysrrhythmia. Flumazenil per se does not induce adverse effects. Coma reversal by flumazenil may cause mild, short-lived reactions caused by sudden awakening. Withdrawal symptoms in long term benzodiazepine users and seizures in patients who have taken an overdose of TCA or carbamazepine and a benzodiazepine can occur with flumazenil; these symptoms are avoidable by utilising slow flumazenil dose titration.", 
    "60": "This study aimed at assessing the effects of midazolam (MDZ) sedation on auditory brainstem (BAEP) and middle latency (MLAEP) evoked potentials in intensive care conditions. Ten ventilated comatose patients were receiving an intravenous MDZ bolus dose (0.2 mg/kg) followed by a 2 h continuous infusion (0.1 mg/kg/h). MLAEPs and BAEPs elicited by clicks (90 dB HL + masking) were simultaneously and continuously monitored during the first 6 h and for 30 min the next morning. We found no effect of MDZ sedation on BAEPs. Only MLAEP components were modified. However, none of the patients presented any total abolition of the MLAEPs. Bolus injection led to very early alteration of cortical responses, beginning after 5 min and lasting almost 1 h (maximum Pa latency increase, 3.1 ms; maximum Pa-Nb amplitude decrease, 46%). During continuous infusion, MLAEPs remained slightly, although significantly, altered (Pa latency, +1.3 ms; Pa-Nb amplitude, 27%). The Nb wave seemed to be modified earlier and to return to normality later than the Pa wave. These findings incite a careful interpretation of MLAEP tracings acquired during the first hour following MDZ bolus injection. If possible, MDZ should be administered as continuous infusion for reliable interpretation of evoked potential changes in intensive care unit, or during surgery.",

Group-reared rats and PHFIs rats were housed in pairs starting 21 days prior to the first experiment. For these two groups, CDP (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) increased SI in unfamiliar, but not familiar (cagemate) pairings. In rats isolated throughout, SI was markedly increased and this was unaffected by CDP. Isolated rats also exhibited increased motor activity (MA) during SI tests, and the MA of both isolates and PHFIs was reduced by CDP. Finally, levels of aggression were very low except in isolates, where a relatively modest increase in aggression was reversed by either pairing or CDP. To summarise, isolation-induced increases in SI and aggression were reversed by pairing, but pairing only attenuated isolation-induced increases in MA. Although CDP reduced the elevated aggression and MA of isolated rats, it had no effect on their elevated SI scores. These data question the permanence of anxiety-related, isolation-induced behavioural changes and stand in contrast to the irreversible anxiogenic profile reported for isolation-reared rats in the elevated X-test.",

Subjects received 4- sampling nights of placebo or triazolam in the single-choice conditions or 2 nights of each in the forced-choice condition. Then on 7 choice nights they could self administer a capsule, or not, in the single-choice conditions, or were required to choose one of two color-coded capsules in the forced-choice condition. In the single-choice conditions, subjects chose placebo 80% of nights and triazolam 77% of nights, while in the forced-choice condition triazolam was chosen on 86% of nights. Thus, the self administration of triazolam did not vary significantly between single or forced choice conditions, but that of placebo did. Placebo rate was high when it was the only alternative, but low when competing with triazolam. On sampling nights, compared to placebo, triazolam produced a significant increase in total sleep time, a reduction in latency to sleep, wake after sleep onset, and percentage stage 1 sleep. Triazolam, relative to placebo, also improved mood in the morning on some sampling nights.

Modern usage is still quite diverse and includes wound healing, kidney and lung ailments, insomnia and depression. This plant has been known to contain a red pigment, hypericin, and similar compounds, which have been assumed to be the primary active constituent(s) in this plant genus. A crude Hypericum extract was tested in a battery of 39 in vitro receptor assays, and two enzyme assays. A sample of pure hypericin was also tested. Hypericin had affinity only for NMDA receptors while the crude extract had significant receptor affinity for adenosine (nonspecific), GABAA, GABAB, benzodiazepine, inositol triphosphate, and monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. With the exception of GABAA and GABAB, the concentrations of Hypericum exact required for these in vitro activities are unlikely to be attained after oral administration in whole animals or humans. These data are consistent with recent pharmacologic evidence suggesting that other constituents of this plant may be of greater importance for the reported psychotherapeutic activity. Alternative pharmacologic mechanisms for Hypericum's antidepressant activity are critically reviewed and the possible importance of GABA receptor binding in the pharmacology of Hypericum is highlighted.

    "69": "Nefazodone is a new antidepressant drug, chemically unrelated to the tricyclic, tetracyclic or selective serotonin uptake inhibitors. Nefazodone blocks the serotonin 5-HT2 receptors and reversibly inhibits serotonin reuptake in vivo. Nefazodone is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration with a peak plasma concentration observed within 2 hours of administration. Nefazodone undergoes significant first-pass metabolism resulting in an oral bioavailability of approximately 20%. Although there is an 18% increase in nefazodone bioavailability with food, this increase is not clinically significant and nefazodone can be administered without regard to meals. Three pharmacologically active nefazodone metabolites have been identified: hydroxy-nefazodone, triazoledione and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP). The pharmacokinetics of nefazodone are nonlinear. The increase in plasma concentrations of nefazodone are greater than would be expected if they were proportional to increases in dose. Steady-state plasma concentrations of nefazodone are attained within 4 days of the commencement of administration. The pharmacokinetics of nefazodone are not appreciably altered in patients with renal or mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment. However, nefazodone plasma concentrations are increased in severe hepatic impairment and in the elderly, especially in elderly females. Lower doses of nefazodone may be necessary in these groups. Nefazodone is a weak inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and does not inhibit CYP1A2. It is not anticipated that nefazodone will interact with drugs cleared by these isozymes. Indeed, nefazodone did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline, a compound cleared by CYP1A2. Nefazodone is metabolised by and inhibits CYP3A4. Clinically significant interactions have been observed between nefazodone and the benzodiazepines triazolam and alprazolam, cyclosporin and carbamazepine. The potential for a clinically significant interaction between nefazodone and other drugs cleared by CYP3A4 (e.g. terfenadine) should be considered before the coadministration of these compounds. There was an increase in haloperidol plasma concentrations when coadministered with nefazodone; nefazodone pharmacokinetics were not affected after coadministration. No clinically significant interaction was observed when nefazodone was administered with lorazepam, lithium, alcohol, cimetidine, warfarin, theophylline or propranolol.",

Each pig in the group received all of the test doses with 5-7 d between treatments (droperidol--0.1, 0.3, 0.6 mg/kg, or midazolam--0.25, 0.5, 1.0 mg/kg) and saline (3 mL), i.m. One investigator, unaware of the treatment administered, assessed the time of onset, degree, and duration of sedation. The 0.3 mg/kg dose of droperidol and 0.5 mg/kg dose of midazolam were judged to be the most suitable for sedation and produced similar degrees of sedation, although the onset and duration of sedation was significantly longer for the droperidol group. The effects of these 2 doses on heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and rectal temperature were assessed in 12 pigs randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatments. Respiratory rate decreased significantly with droperidol at 10, 15, and 30 min. Temperature was significantly decreased at 60 min following midazolam. This study demonstrates that 0.3 mg/kg i.m. of droperidol and 0.5 mg/kg i.m. of midazolam induce adequate sedation in pigs with minimal cardiorespiratory changes.",

The three-dimensional structure, consistent with the proton-proton distances obtained from the quantitative analysis of the two-dimensional NOEs, was generated by restrained energy minimization and molecular-dynamics simulation. In water/SDS micellar medium, YLGYLEQLLR adopts an amphipathic helicoid structure with distinct hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces. The relative disposition of the tyrosine aromatic rings was compared with that of the aromatic rings in the benzodiazepines.", 
    "72": "The synthesis and stereochemical structure--activity relationships of a new class of potent and selective non-peptide cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) receptor antagonists based on the 1,3-dioxoperhydropyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine skeleton are described. The most potent member of this series of eight diastereoisomers, (4aS,5R)-2-benzyl-5-[N-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-tryptophyl]-amino] - 1,3-dioxoperhydropyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine, displays nanomolar CCK-A receptor affinity and higher than 8000-fold potency at the CCK-A than at the CCK-B receptor. As CCK-A antagonist, this compound inhibits the CCK-8-evoked amylase release from pancreatic acinar cells at a low concentration, similar to that of the typical antagonist Devazepide. Highly strict stereochemical requirements for CCK-A receptor binding and selectivity have been found. The L-Trp and the 4a,5-trans disposition of the bicyclic perhydropyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine are essential for binding potency and selectivity.", 
    "73": "Ligands for cerebral benzodiazepine receptors were used in the past to indicate the intactness of cortical neurons in subacute to chronic states after stroke and thus to differentiate among brain regions with complete or incomplete infarction and with functional deactivation. For planning acute interventional therapy, however, a marker of irreversible damage in early ischemia is needed. We studied the applicability of [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) for differentiation between tissue with and without potential of recovery in the first hours after focal experimental ischemia.", 
    "74": "In 11 cats, cerebral blood flow, cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, oxygen extraction fraction, and FMZ binding were studied repeatedly by positron emission tomography before, during, and up to 12 hours after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) (30 minutes in 2, 60 minutes in 7, and 120 minutes in 2 cats, respectively). Development of the defects in energy metabolism were compared with the defects in FMZ binding (2 to 3 hours and 8 to 9 hours after MCAO), with the pattern of disturbed glucose metabolism (determined 12 hours after MCAO), and with the size of the infarcts (determined approximately 15 hours after MCAO).", 
    "75": "Irrespective of the level of reperfusion, defects in FMZ binding (2 to 3 hours after MCAO) were closely related to areas with severely depressed oxygen consumption and predicted the size of the final infarcts, whereas preserved FMZ binding indicated intact cortex. Depression of glucose metabolism was in all animals larger than the defects in FMZ binding and the infarcts, indicating functional deactivation of brain areas beyond the permanent morphological damage. In addition, FMZ distribution within 2 minutes after injection was significantly correlated to flow and yielded reliable perfusion images.", 
    "76": "The reduction of FMZ binding early after focal ischemia reflects irreversible neuronal damage that otherwise only can be detected by multitracer studies. Our experimental data and first clinical applications suggest that FMZ has potential as an indicator of developing infarction. Since FMZ distribution additionally images perfusion, this tracer might be useful for the selection of patients who would benefit from acute therapeutic intervention.", 
    "77": "It is widely agreed that after two or more seizures patients should be given antiepileptic treatment, but there is still controversy about the treatment of patients after a first unprovoked seizure. In a multicenter, randomized, open trial, patients with a first tonic-clonic seizure were randomized to immediate treatment (carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, or sodium valproate) or to treatment only after another seizure. Fifty-two (24%) of the 215 patients randomized to immediate treatment and 85 (42%) of the 204 randomized to delayed treatment experienced seizure recurrence during follow-up. Age, acute treatment of the seizure with benzodiazepines, remote etiologic factors, and EEG abnormalities were significant predictors of relapse. Of the immediately treated patients, 87% had no seizures for a year and 68% had no seizures for 2 years, whereas only slightly fewer initially untreated patients (83% and 60%) achieved these endpoints. Patients treated after the first seizure and those treated after seizure relapse had the same time-dependent probability of achieving 1 and 2 seizure-free years. None of the variables that were prognostic predictors of relapse was significantly associated with the probability of having 1 or 2 years of seizure control. Anticonvulsants in patients presenting a first tonic-clonic seizure reduce the risk of relapse; however, 50% of patients who are not treated will never experience a second seizure. Moreover, the probability of long-term remission is not influenced by treatment of the first seizure.", 
    "78": "Although gallbladder stasis exists in most patients with cholesterol gallstones, it is unknown whether stasis is a causative factor of gallstone disease or merely a consequence of it. We studied the impact of sustained gallbladder stasis induced by a cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptor antagonist (MK-329) on gallstone formation in ground squirrels fed either a trace or a high-cholesterol diet. MK-329 markedly inhibited gallbladder contraction in vitro in response to CCK (at EC100, control: 3.6 +/- 0.5 vs. MK-329: 1.1 +/- 0.3 g; P < .05) and increased gallbladder fasting volume in vivo (control: 462 +/- 66 vs. MK-329: 1,004 +/- 121 microL; P < .05). Whereas the high-cholesterol diet alone (1%-cholesterol diet + placebo) increased the cholesterol saturation index (CSI) in control animals (trace-cholesterol diet + placebo), MK-329 significantly (P < .05) decreased the CSI in both hepatic and gallbladder bile in animals on the trace-(trace-cholesterol diet + MK-329) as well as on the high-cholesterol diets (1%-cholesterol diet + MK-329). The mucin content of the mucus layer on the epithelial surface of the gallbladder wall more than doubled (P < .05) with the high-cholesterol diet; adding MK-329 to the latter group produced a further 82% increase (P < .05). The cholesterol diet + MK-329 group had the highest (100%) incidence of cholesterol crystals that were evident in fresh gallbladder bile, coincident with a shortened nucleation time (2.5 +/- 0.6 days; P < .05 vs. the cholesterol diet + placebo group, 5.8 +/- 1.0 days or the other 2 groups, >21 days). Bile from animals on the trace-cholesterol diet, whether or not receiving MK-329, lacked crystals in bile and exhibited a normal nucleation time (>21 days). Thus, stasis per se may lower the CSI, but its detrimental effect on the gallbladder predominates locally, and so accelerates cholesterol crystal formation in this model.",

A stratified random sample (N = 373) completed face-to-face diagnostic assessments including the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, a brief self-rated disability questionnaire (Brief Disability Questionnaire), and the interviewer-rated Social Disability Schedule. A telephone follow-up survey was completed 3 months later. Use of psychotropic drugs, use of mental health services, and direct health care costs were assessed by using the health plan's automated data systems.", 
    "81": "Approximately 10% of the primary care patients reported major current insomnia (e.g., taking at least 2 hours to fall asleep nearly every night). Current insomnia was associated with significantly greater functional impairment (according to both Brief Disability Questionnaire and Social Disability Schedule), more days of disability due to health problems, and greater general medical service utilization. While insomnia was associated with depressive disorder and chronic medical illness, adjustment for these factors only partially accounted for the association of insomnia with disability and with health care utilization. Of the patients with current insomnia, 28% received any psychotropic drug; 14% received benzodiazepines and 19% received antidepressants.",

    "84": "Patients aged 60 or older who were admitted to medical services at Duke Hospital were evaluated by a geropsychiatrist who used a structured psychiatric interview to identify major or minor depressive disorder. Medical records of depressed patients were reviewed for use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines before admission, during hospitalization, and on discharge. After discharge, depressed patients were contacted four times by telephone at 12-week intervals to inquire about medication use (median follow-up time = 45 weeks).", 
    "85": "Of 153 depressed patients, 40.5% received antidepressants at some time during their hospital stay or follow-up period, 25.5% received only benzodiazepines, and 34.0% received neither. The most commonly prescribed antidepressant was amitriptyline (45.2% of treated patients), administered at an average maximum dose of 49 mg/day. Only 15 of 114 untreated depressed patients started antidepressant therapy during hospitalization (nine with amitriptyline). Of 91 depressed patients who did not receive antidepressants either before admission or during hospitalization, only 11% received any antidepressant therapy during the median 11-month follow-up; again, half were treated with amitriptyline at doses of 10-30 mg/day. Intensity of antidepressant therapy was predicted by severity of depressive symptoms, history of psychiatric problems, and higher income.", 
    "86": "A relatively low proportion of depressed older medical inpatients receive treatment with antidepressants. Patients treated with antidepressants often receive potentially dangerous tertiary tricyclics at inadequate doses. Unless depression is identified and treated during medical hospitalization, it is unlikely to be treated adequately after discharge.", 
    "87": "Animals vary in their sensitivity to ethanol, a trait at least partly determined by genetic factors. In order to identify possible responsible genes, mice lacking Fyn, a non-receptor type tyrosine kinase, were investigated. These mice were hypersensitive to the hypnotic effect of ethanol. The administration of ethanol enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in the hippocampus of control mice but not in Fyn-deficient mice. An acute tolerance to ethanol inhibition of NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials in hippocampal slices developed in control mice but not in Fyn-deficient mice. These results indicate that Fyn affects behavioral, biochemical, and physiological responses to ethanol.", 
    "88": "Chronic administration of benzodiazepine agonists produces behavioral tolerance. For induction of tolerance, the use-dependent down-regulation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA[A])/ benzodiazepine receptors is a potential cellular mechanism. We previously identified GABA(A) receptors on clathrin-coated vesicles from rat brain, suggesting that surface receptors can be internalized via endocytosis. To examine a role for coated vesicles in GABA(A) receptor down-regulation in vivo, fractions were obtained from mouse brain microsomes through density centrifugation and treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100. This coated vesicle preparation was enriched in clathrin subunits and clathrin light-chain kinase and had twice the level of [3H]flunitrazepam binding as did vesicles not exposed to Triton. Adult mice were treated with lorazepam (2 mg/kg/day) for 7 days via osmotic minipump, achieving a serum level of 103 +/- 8.9 ng/ml. The level of flunitrazepam bound to coated vesicles was increased by 83 +/- 13% in the lorazepam-treated mice compared with vehicle-treated controls. The Bmax value for [3H]flunitrazepam binding to synaptic membranes from lorazepam-treated animals was 33 +/- 4% lower than that of controls. The amount of GABA(A) receptor alpha-1 subunits, as quantified by Western blotting, followed a similar pattern. Relative to controls, immunoreactivity for alpha-1 subunits in coated vesicles from lorazepam-treated mice was increased by 60.0 +/- 10.3%, whereas that in synaptic membranes declined by 12 +/- 6%. These results indicate that lorazepam-dependent GABA(A) receptor sequestration occurs in mouse brain. Furthermore, it is suggested that this sequestration may play a role in GABA(A) receptor down-regulation in vivo.", 
    "89": "The effects of an agonist (S-AMPA, i.c.v.), as well as competitive (CNQX, NBQX, DNQX, i.p.), and noncompetitive antagonists (GYKI 52466, i.p.) at the AMPA/kainate receptors were examined in the open field and the Vogel tests of anxiety. It was found that both kinds of antagonists inhibited rat exploratory behavior in a dose-dependent manner, at the dose range exhibiting a clear-cut tendency to decrease rat locomotor activity. They appeared inactive in the Vogel test over an examined dose-range. S-AMPA, whereas not changing in a significant way rat behavior in the open field, significantly enhanced the suppressive influence of a shock on drinking in the Vogel test. The drug administered at the dose of 2 micrograms/5 microliters, i.c.v., revealed also a tendency to decrease the motor activity followed by prodromal symptoms of epileptic-like activity in some subjects. It is concluded that AMPA/kainate receptors probably are not directly involved in the control of rat emotional behavior. Thus, their primary role as putative neuroprotective and anticonvulsant agents is indirectly confirmed.", 
    "90": "To determine the effect of long-term blockade of cholecystokinin (CCK) on both pancreatic storage and secretion processes, L 364,718 (a CCK receptor antagonist) was administered to rats at 0.1 mg/kg/day for 3, 7, and 15 days. Zymogen granules were analyzed by flow cytometry to determine their light scattering properties-forward scatter and side scatter-as well as their amylase content measured by a specific antiserum. The mean number of zymogen granules per cell was counted on pancreatic sections using electron microscopy. DNA content, pancreatic weight, and enzyme secretion were also studied under both basal conditions and CCK infusion at a dose of 1.25 micrograms/kg/h, which is able to displace the CCK receptor antagonist. Two subpopulations of zymogen granules (Z1 and Z2) were identified on the basis of their light scattering parameters, in both control and L 364,718-treated rats. L 364,718 administered for 3, 7, and 15 days induced a significant reduction in the amylase content of individual zymogen granules, for both Z1 and Z2 zymogen granule subsets. In contrast, the number of zymogen granules per cell increased from day +3 of treatment onward, the highest values being detected at day +7. Hyperplasia was observed only at day +15. Basal enzyme secretion decreased significantly in rats treated with L 364,718 for 3 and 7 days but recovered to control values after 15 days of treatment. No significant differences in CCK-stimulated amylase secretion were observed between control and L 364,718-treated rats. At day +15 of L 364,718 treatment a significant increase in enzyme secretion was observed with respect to shorter treatment periods; this was associated with a significant increase in both the number of cells and the number of zymogen granules per cell. Our results indicate that chronic administration of L 364,718 induces a biphasic effect on pancreatic function. Interestingly, although enzyme secretion reached recovery after long-term treatment (15 days), the storage process is altered since the mean enzyme content in each individual zymogen granule remains significantly reduced.", 
    "91": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate 5.0 mg/kg pentobarbital from saline under a concurrent fixed-interval (FI) FI schedule of food presentation on which, after pentobarbital administration, responses on one key were reinforced with food under an FI 60-s component and responses on the other key were reinforced under an FI 240-s component. After saline administration, the schedule contingencies on the two keys were reversed. After both pentobarbital and saline, pigeons responded more frequently on the key on which responses had been programmed to produce the reinforcer under the FI 60 component of the concurrent schedule. The schedule was changed to concurrent FI 150 FI 150 s for drug-substitution tests. In each bird, increasing doses of pentobarbital, ethanol, and chlordiazepoxide produced increases in the proportion of responses on the key on which responses had been reinforced under the FI 60 component after pentobarbital administration during training sessions. The proportion of responses on that key was slightly lower for ethanol than for chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital. At a dose of pentobarbital higher than the training dose, responding decreased on the key that had been reinforced under the FI 60 component during training sessions. Phencyclidine produced less responding on the key programmed under the FI 60-s component than did pentobarbital. Methamphetamine produced responding primarily on the key on which responses had been reinforced under the FI 60-s component after saline administration.", 
    "92": "The behavioural element, stretched attend posture (SAP), is an important component of the \"risk-assessment\" repertoire of defensive behaviour in rodents. The present experimental paradigm was devised as a novel and simple method of eliciting high levels of SAP in mice and rats. The SAP test apparatus comprised an elevated black Perspex circular platform. A smaller clear red Perspex circular \"Canopy\" was supported directly above the platform by a central pillar, thus dividing the platform into an inner, dimly lit covered zone and an outer, brightly lit exposed zone. In both the rat and mouse version of this model, vehicle-treated animals exhibited a marked preference for exploring the covered zone and also exhibited high baseline levels of SAP, particularly at the covered zone boundary whilst they investigated the exposed zone. In the mouse SAP test, the benzodiazepine receptor agonists, diazepam (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) and chlordiazepoxide (2 mg/kg s.c.), and the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, buspirone (1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.), ipsapirone (3 mg/kg s.c.) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.2 mg/kg s.c.), all significantly decreased the frequency of SAP without impairing motor activity. In the rat SAP test, diazepam (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) significantly decreased, whilst the anxiogenic 5-HT2C/1B receptor agonist, mCPP (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg s.c.), significantly increased, the frequency of SAP. Ipsapirone (3 mg/kg s.c.) induced a non-specific behavioural inhibition. These data suggest that the \"Canopy\" SAP test is a useful paradigm to investigate risk assessment behaviour in both rats and mice, and may provide a sensitive novel rodent model of anxiety.",

    "94": "This was a multicenter, randomized, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 9 university-affiliated teaching hospitals. Patients > 18 years of age requiring conscious sedation for a painful procedure expected to last < 20 minutes were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients received 2 micrograms/kg of fentanyl, followed by midazolam titrated to the desired level of sedation. Patients were then randomized to receive either flumazenil or placebo in a 3:1 ratio (flumazenil:placebo). Vital signs, O2 saturation, and alertness were recorded at regular intervals. Prior to ED release, patients were asked to rate the amount of discomfort they experienced and the level of relaxation achieved on a 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS). They also were questioned about their recall for the procedure and satisfaction with the drug regimen. Physicians also rated their satisfaction with the drug regimen on a 10-cm VAS.", 
    "95": "Overall, 133 patients received flumazenil and 46 patients received placebo. Patients in the 2 groups received similar doses of midazolam. The patients who received flumazenil returned to baseline alertness earlier (11.1 min vs 24.8 min, p < 0.001) and at a faster rate than did the patients given placebo. Actual intervals from procedure completion until release from the ED did not differ between the 2 groups (98.2 +/- 3.6 min flumazenil vs 96.9 +/- 5.8 min placebo; p = 0.89). The amounts of discomfort experienced, levels of relaxation achieved, recalls for the procedure, and both patient and physician satisfactions were also similar for the 2 groups. There were no serious adverse effects related to the study drug, and minor adverse effects were similar for the 2 groups.", 
    "96": "Flumazenil is safe and efficacious in reversing midazolam-induced sedation in ED patients given a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to facilitate the performance of a short, painful procedure.

    "97": "A series of succinamide derivatives containing the 5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one skeleton (6a-z) was prepared and evaluated for binding affinity to muscarinic receptors in vitro and for antagonism of bradycardia and salivation in vivo in comparison with AF-DX 116 (1a). Structure-activity relationships (SAR) studies in vitro indicated that the 4-(4-alkyl-1-piperazinyl)benzylamino moiety plays a crucial role in enhancing the affinity for M2 muscarinic receptors. Compound 6y, containing a 4-(4-isopropyl-1-piperazinyl)benzylmethylamino moiety, exhibited the highest affinity for M2 muscarinic receptors (pKi = 9.2), being 200 times as potent as 1a, and compound 6u, containing a 4-(4-ethyl-1-piperazinyl)benzylethylamino moiety, showed the highest selectivity for M2 over M3 muscarinic receptors (M3/M2 ratio = 320). Both 6y and 6u antagonized the oxotremorine-induced bradycardia in rats after intravenous or oral administration. Oral evaluation in conscious dogs showed that the efficacy for increasing the heart rate was at least 3-fold greater than that of 1a.", 
    "98": "The provision of an immediate supply of isolated porcine hepatocytes for artificial liver support requires preservation techniques that will allow maintenance of cell viability and detoxification functions. By means of a simple and cost-effective cryopreservation system, porcine hepatocytes can be available for both local and distant medical treatment facilities. Additionally, cryopreservation provides an adequate period for quality control testing to be completed prior to use of any specific cell lot. We are reporting a dual approach, namely the preservation of porcine hepatocytes, at 4 degrees C and at -196 degrees C in liquid nitrogen (LN2). Using a combination of cryoprotectant agents with Chee's modified Eagle's culture media (CEM), collagenase isolated hepatocytes stored at 4 degrees C for 24 h maintained 80% of the initial diazepam metabolism measured in freshly isolated cells and nearly 100% of initial function was preserved in hepatocytes stored up to 6 mo at -196 degrees C. University of Wisconsin solution (UW) was also tested and while adequate for 4 degrees C storage, it certainly did not match the performance of the CEM formulations for preservation of metabolic function of cells stored in liquid nitrogen. Based on our results of viability and detoxification function the combination of CEM with DMSO, polyethylene glycol and serum provided optimal protection for LN2 frozen cells. Other findings in these studies underlined the importance of the gradual introduction of DMSO in the prefreezing process, the period of osmotic equilibration, and the rapid postthaw withdrawal of this agent to minimize cytotoxic effects at these critical stages. Our freezing methodology provides the foundation for further technological developments in the cryopreservation of the large numbers of cells (billions) that are necessary for extracorporeal liver assist devices.", 
    "99": "In many neurons, responses to individual quanta of transmitter exhibit large variations in amplitude. The origin of this variability, although central to our understanding of synaptic transmission and plasticity, remains controversial. To examine the relationship between quantal amplitude and postsynaptic receptor number, we adopted a novel approach, combining patch-clamp recording of synaptic currents with quantitative immunogold localization of synaptic receptors. Here, we report that in cerebellar stellate cells, where variability in GABA miniature synaptic currents is particularly marked, the distribution of quantal amplitudes parallels that of synaptic GABA(A) receptor number. We also show that postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor density is uniform, allowing synaptic area to be used as a measure of relative receptor content. Flurazepam, which increases GABA(A) receptor affinity, prolongs the decay of all miniature currents but selectively increases the amplitude of large events. From this differential effect, we show that a quantum of GABA saturates postsynaptic receptors when <80 receptors are present but results in incomplete occupancy at larger synapses.",

    "101": "Thirty-six subjects in experiment 1 and 48 subjects in experiment 2 were pretested on a computerized memory battery to establish baseline performance. Subjects were then randomly assigned to receive placebo, 0.25 mg, or 0.75 mg oral alprazolam (experiment 1) or placebo, 0.25 mg, 0.50 mg, or 0.75 mg oral alprazolam (experiment 2). Forty-five minutes after the double-blind administration of alprazolam, subjects were given a second memory battery. The memory batteries tested story recall and recognition and word recall and recognition. Subjects in experiment 2 subsequently underwent oral surgery for the removal of one to four molars. The subjects completed anxiety questionnaires both before and after surgery.", 
    "102": "The 0.75-mg and 0.50-mg doses, but not the 0.25-mg dose, impaired word recall. The 0.75-mg dose also impaired story recall and recognition. The proportion of subjects reporting moderate to high anxiety during oral surgery decreased with increasing doses of alprazolam. Multiple regression indicated that the 0.75-mg alprazolam dose significantly decreased anxiety during oral surgery. The 0.25-mg and 0.50-mg doses also tended to reduce anxiety, but beta values for these doses did not reach significance.",

    "104": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether gastrin regulates morphological changes and alpha-subunit gene expression in parietal cells through the gastrin/CCK-B receptor on enterochromaffin-like cells by histamine release. Treatment with 100 mg/kg of YM022, a potent and selective gastrin/CCK-B receptor antagonist, for one week in rats did not alter mRNA levels of histidine decarboxylase or H+, K+-ATPase. However, parietal cell morphology predominantly changed to the resting form, although the serum gastrin concentration was significantly increased. Additional treatment with YM022 and oral omeprazole, 100 mg/kg, for one week markedly suppressed the increases of mRNA levels of histidine decarboxylase and H+, K+-ATPase and completely blocked the morphological transformation of the parietal cells to a stimulated form induced by treatment with omeprazole alone. This indicates that the morphological transformation of parietal cells to an activated form with a subsequent increase in H+, K+-ATPase synthesis caused by hypergastrinemia is mediated by increased histidine decarboxylase gene expression in enterochromaffin-like cells via gastrin/CCK-B receptors.", 
    "105": "The threat of civilian and military casualties from nerve agent exposure has become a greater concern over the past decade. After rapidly assessing that a nerve agent attack has occurred, emphasis must be placed on decontamination and protection of both rescuers and medical personnel from exposure. The medical system can become rapidly overwhelmed and strong emotional reactions can confuse the clinical picture. Initially, care should first be focused on supportive care, with emphasis toward aggressive airway maintenance and decontamination. Atropine should be titrated, with the goal of therapy being drying of secretions and the resolution of bronchoconstriction and bradycardia. Early administration of pralidoxime chloride maximizes antidotal efficacy. Benzodiazepines, in addition to atropine, should be administered if seizures develop. Early, aggressive medical therapy is the key to prevention of the morbidity and mortality associated with nerve agent poisoning.", 
    "106": "The mechanisms governing the assembly of alpha-, beta- and gamma-subunits to form GABAA-receptors are poorly understood. Here, we report that the alpha-subunit is essential for receptor assembly. In mice homozygous for a deletion on chromosome 7 spanning the alpha 5- and gamma 3-subunit genes, zolpidem-insensitive benzodiazepine binding sites, corresponding to GABAA-receptors containing the alpha 5-subunit, were absent in the hippocampus. This loss of alpha 5-GABAA-receptor binding was also apparent as a 21% decrease in the total number of benzodiazepine binding sites in the hippocampus. In addition, immunoreactivity for the beta 2,3- and gamma 2-subunit was decreased exclusively in neurons which normally express the alpha 5-subunit, such as olfactory bulb granule cells and hippocampal pyramidal cells. In other brain regions of the mutants, the beta 2,3- and gamma 2-subunit staining was unaffected. Controls included two lines of mice homozygous for a shorter chromosomal deletion, that either included or excluded the gamma 3-subunit gene. These two lines were indistinguishable with regard to numbers of benzodiazepine binding sites and levels alpha 5-, beta 2,3- and gamma 2-subunit immunoreactivity, indicating that the lack of gamma 3-subunit gene did not contribute to the observed deficit in receptor formation. These results demonstrate that the absence of the alpha 5-subunit gene prevents the formation of the entire respective receptor complex in adult mouse brain. Thus, the alpha-subunit, unlike the gamma 2-subunit, might play a major role in the assembly or targeting of GABAA-receptor complexes.", 
    "107": "The gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABA) receptor in the mammalian central nervous system is composed of pentameric combinations of alpha1-6, beta1-4, gamma1-3, delta1, and/or epsilon1 subunit subtypes. Although each of the different subunits influences the functional properties of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors (GABARs), the alpha subunit subtypes have been shown to be important for activation of the receptor by GABA and pentobarbital and the regulation of GABARs by numerous allosteric regulators, including benzodiazepines, furosemide, zinc, and lanthanum. However, with the exception of the benzodiazepines, the alpha subtype domain that is responsible for the action of these allosteric compounds is unknown. The alpha1 and alpha6 subtypes are among the most diverse of the alpha subunit family and confer a different responsiveness of GABARs to GABA and many of the allosteric modulators. These regulatory compounds act after extracellular application and therefore likely act on extracellular GABAR sites, the largest of which is the amino-terminal extracellular domain. To determine the role of this domain in the action of these allosteric regulatory agents, we constructed chimeras of the rat alpha1 and alpha6 subtypes with a splice site within the first putative transmembrane domain (TM). This separated the large extracellular amino-terminal domain from the transmembrane, intracellular, and TM2-3 and carboxyl-terminal extracellular domains of the subunit. The chimeric subtypes were expressed in L929 fibroblasts along with beta3 and gamma2L subtypes, and their pharmacological properties were determined with whole-cell electrophysiological recording. The alpha subtype amino-terminal extracellular domain was the primary determinant of GABA sensitivity and was responsible for the functional properties of activation by pentobarbital, sensitivity to diazepam, potentiation by lanthanum, and high affinity inhibition by furosemide. The remaining carboxyl-terminal domains influenced the GABA sensitivity and determined zinc sensitivity and low affinity inhibition by furosemide. Both domains were apparently required for inhibition by lanthanum.",

Their binding pocket is made up of amino acid residues located on both alpha and gamma subunits. We transiently expressed wild-type alpha1beta2gamma2 and mutant GABAA receptors in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and determined their binding properties. Receptors containing the mutant alphaY209A showed approximately 40-fold decrease in affinity for [3H]Ro 15-1788 and diazepam, whereas zolpidem displayed no measurable affinity. Receptors containing the mutant alphaY209F showed a small-to-moderate decrease in affinity for [3H]Ro 15-1788, diazepam, zolpidem, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, and Cl 218872, amounting to 2-8-fold. Receptors containing the mutant alphaY209Q appeared in the surface membrane of transfected cells, bound [3H]muscimol with wild-type affinity, but failed to bind [3H]Ro 15-1788 or [3H]flunitrazepam with detectable affinity. If these mutant receptors were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the apparent affinity for GABA was only slightly decreased, whereas the ability of the currents to be stimulated by low concentrations of flunitrazepam was abolished. Receptors containing a point mutant of another amino acid residue, alphaT206A, surprisingly showed an increase in affinity of 5- and 16-fold, for the negative allosteric modulator methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and the partial positive allosteric modulator Cl 218872, respectively, whereas there was only a small decrease in affinity for Ro 15-1788, diazepam, and zolpidem, amounting to 2-, 4-, and 5-fold. Both alpha206 and alpha209 are thus both important in determining the binding affinities for ligands of the benzodiazepine binding site. The residues are spaced at an interval of three amino acids and may be part of an alpha helix.", 
    "109": "We examined the direct myocardial depressant effects of diazepam and midazolam and determined whether a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, or an L-type Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644, affects the myocardial depression induced by diazepam and midazolam in cultured rat ventricular myocytes. Ventricular myocytes of neonatal rats were obtained by enzymatic digestion with collagenase and cultured for 6-7 days. The myocytes were stabilized in serum-free medium, and the spontaneous beating rate and amplitude were measured by determining displacement with a fiberoptic sensor. Myocytes were exposed to either diazepam or midazolam at concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 microM. The beating rate and amplitude were measured 4 min after diazepam or midazolam administration. In other cells, either diazepam or midazolam was administered at each concentration in the presence of flumazenil or Bay K 8644. Midazolam and diazepam decreased the beating rate and amplitude concentration-dependently. These myocardial depressant effects were prevented by Bay K 8644 and, to a lesser degree, by flumazenil. Thus, the L-type Ca2+ channel is important in the direct myocardial depression caused by diazepam and midazolam.", 
    "110": "This study describes the direct effect of midazolam and diazepam on intrinsic myocardial contraction using cultured rat ventricular heart cells. Both of these drugs have a direct myocardial depressant effect at the cellular level, which is mainly mediated by an inhibition of the sarcolemmal L-type Ca2+ channel.", 
    "111": "Male rats ingested about half as much of an intraorally infused (1 ml/min) carbohydrate solution compared with a protein solution. Blood levels of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) had increased to 13.6 +/- 1.4 and 16.7 +/- 1.7 pmol/l when the rats stopped ingesting carbohydrate or protein and continued to increase to 35.6 +/- 3.2 pmol/l 30 min after the carbohydrate meal and 34.4 +/- 3.5 pmol/l 60 min after the protein meal. Intraperitoneal injection of CCK-8 (0.6-5.0 micrograms) inhibited and injection of the CCKA-receptor antagonist L-364, 718 (20-80 micrograms) facilitated carbohydrate intake, but neither CCK-8 nor L-364,718 affected protein intake. The results suggest that CCK-8 is not involved in regulating the duration of a protein meal but may be involved in regulating carbohydrate intake. The postprandial period of suppression of protein intake correlated with the disappearance of some amino acids, e.g., Arg, Tyr, and Trp, in the blood, and this may be of importance for protein ingestion, since these amino acids are neurotransmitter precursors.", 
    "112": "Microinjecting cholinomimetics into the pontine reticular formation produces a state that resembles natural rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Evocation of this REM sleeplike states is anatomically site dependent within the pons and is mediated by muscarinic receptors. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cholinergic REM sleep generation and muscarinic receptor subtype involvement remain to be specified. This study tested the hypothesis that muscarinic receptor subtypes are differentially distributed within the oral and caudal divisions of rat pontine reticular nucleus. In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to localize and quantify M1, M2, and M3 binding sites in the pontine reticular formation and in pontine brain stem regions known to regulate REM sleep. M1-M3 binding sites were present in some REM sleep-related nuclei, such as dorsal raphe and locus ceruleus. The pontine reticular formation was found to have a homogeneous distribution of M2 binding sites across its rostral to caudal extent, indicating that anatomic specificity of cholinergic REM sleep induction cannot be accounted for by a differential density of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "113": "A cholecystokinin (CCK)-releasing peptide, luminal CCK-releasing factor (LCRF), has been purified from rat jejunal secretion. Amino acid analysis and mass spectral analysis showed that the purified peptide is composed of 70-75 amino acid residues and has a mass of 8,136 Da. Microsequence analysis of LCRF yielded an amino acid sequence for the amino-terminal 41 residues. To determine the biologically active region of the molecule, a peptide was synthesized consisting of the amino-terminal 35 amino acids of LCRF. In this study, intraduodenal infusion of LCRF-(1-35) significantly stimulated pancreatic secretion in conscious rats. The dose-response curves to LCRF-(1-35) and to monitor peptide were similar and biphasic, with higher doses producing submaximal pancreatic secretory responses. The CCK-A receptor antagonist MK-329 abolished the pancreatic secretory response to intraduodenally infused LCRF-(1-35). These results demonstrate that LCRF biological activity is contained within the amino-terminal 35-amino acid portion of LCRF, and this fragment may be useful for investigating the role of LCRF in gastrointestinal function.", 
    "114": "Olanzapine and risperidone, both second-generation antipsychotic agents, represent two different pharmacologic strategies. Although they share some in vitro properties, they differ by virtue of their chemical structure, spectrum of receptor binding affinities, animal neuropharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo neuroimaging profile. Based on such differences, it was hypothesized that the two compounds would show distinct safety and/or efficacy characteristics. To test this hypothesis, an international, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, 28-week prospective study was conducted with 339 patients who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, or schizoaffective disorder. Results of the study indicated that both olanzapine and risperidone were safe and effective in the management of psychotic symptoms. However, olanzapine demonstrated significantly greater efficacy in negative symptoms (Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms summary score), as well as overall response rate (> or = 40% decrease in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score). Furthermore, a statistically significantly greater proportion of the olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients maintained their response at 28 weeks based on Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects, hyperprolactinemia, and sexual dysfunction was statistically significantly lower in olanzapine-treated than risperidone-treated patients. In addition, statistically significantly fewer adverse events were reported by olanzapine-treated patients than by their risperidone-treated counterparts. Thus, the differential preclinical profiles of these two drugs were also evident in a controlled, clinical investigation. Olanzapine seemed to have a risk-versus-benefit advantage.", 
    "115": "Bradycardia is one of the inevitable and undesirable responses when the muscle weakness induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is reversed by AChE inhibitors. The current study was designed to compare the bradycardiac effects of the two AChE inhibitors used widely in clinical anesthesia, neostigmine and edrophonium. Isolated, spontaneously beating guinea pig right atrial preparations were used as the experimental model, and in some cases, electrical field stimulation was utilized to stimulate parasympathetic nerve terminals within the atria. Neostigmine decreased the spontaneously beating rate in a concentration-dependent manner at concentrations up to 10 microM. At higher concentrations, the agent restored the beating rate to the predrug control level. Atropine abolished the biphasic response of the atrium to neostigmine. In contrast, edrophonium had no effect on the spontaneous beating rate. However, edrophonium (3 microM) potentiated the field stimulation-induced negative chronotropic effect. Tetrodotoxin did not inhibit the chronotropic effect of neostigmine. Both neostigmine and edrophonium at higher concentrations inhibited the negative chronotropic effect of carbachol. In conclusion, neostigmine possesses potential dual effects on cardiac muscarinic ACh receptors. Low concentrations of neostigmine may stimulate the receptors directly, and at higher concentrations neostigmine may act as an antimuscarinic agent. On the other hand, edrophonium may inhibit the cardiac muscarinic ACh receptors exclusively without stimulating the receptors. These results could at least partially explain the difference between the bradycardiac effects of the agents observed clinically.", 
    "116": "The discriminative stimulus effects of benzodiazepines often have been indistinguishable from those of barbiturates or other sedative/anxiolytics. However, baboons and rats trained to discriminate lorazepam did not reliably generalize to pentobarbital in previous studies, although animals comparably trained to discriminate pentobarbital reliably generalized to lorazepam. The present study investigated the generalization profile for a variety of anxiolytic, sedative and other drugs in baboons trained to discriminate oral lorazepam (1.8 mg/kg). Triazolam, alprazolam, diazepam, midazolam, bromazepam, temazepam and nordiazepam occasioned >80% of total responses on the lorazepam-paired lever, in that order of potency, 60 min after oral dosing; chlordiazepoxide did so in three of five baboons. However, barbiturates (amobarbital, hexobarbital, methohexital, pentobarbital, phenobarbital, secobarbital) and methypryIon occasioned lorazepam-appropriate responding in only one or two baboons. Testing barbiturates at different pretreatment times (amobarbital, hexobarbital, pentobarbital or secobarbital) or by an i.m. route of administration (methohexital, pentobarbital) did not produce an increase in generalization. Neither other classic sedatives/anxiolytics (chloral hydrate, clomethiazole, ethanol, methaqualone, meprobamate, triclofos), nor anticonvulsants (phenytoin, valproic acid), nor drugs from other pharmacological classes shared discriminative-stimulus effects with lorazepam. These results, together with those from previous studies in which lorazepam or another benzodiazepine served as the training stimulus, indicate that lorazepam training results in a more selective generalization profile with respect to sedative/anxiolytic drugs than does training with other benzodiazepines.", 
    "117": "The ability of pretreatment by the selective cholecystokinin-B (CCK(B)) receptor antagonist L-365,260 (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) to prevent the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive action of morphine was evaluated by a well-established rat model of unilateral peripheral mononeuropathy. The 4-day pretreatment regimens (saline, L-365,260 or morphine alone, or with the combination of L-365,260 and morphine) were begun on postoperative day 12. The experiments were performed on day 16, when the pain-related behavior reached a stable maximum. Behavioral test based on a mechanical stimulus (vocalization threshold to paw pressure) and relatively low acute doses of systemic morphine (0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg i.v.) were used. On day 16, the base-line vocalization threshold to paw pressure values of the groups pretreated with one of the four regimens were similar, which suggests that the pretreatments had no effect on the development of mechanical allodynia. Pretreatment with morphine alone (10 mg/kg s.c., two times a day during 4 days) induced a complete tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of acute morphine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.v.). However, pretreatment with the combination of L-365,260 with morphine completely prevented the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of acute i.v. morphine. The effect of acute morphine in this latter pretreatment group was dose dependent, naloxone reversible and similar to the effect of acute morphine seen in the saline-pretreated group. Our results suggest that in this well-characterized model of neuropathic pain, the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of systemic morphine can be prevented by systemic coadministration of the CCK(B) antagonist L-365,260. We further show, that in contrast to a tonic activity of the endogenous opioidergic system, a tonic activity of the endogenous CCK system cannot be revealed in this rat model of neuropathic pain.", 
    "118": "The primary goal of this study was to determine the extent that selective muscarinic receptor antagonists could discriminate between the chronotropic and coronary vasoconstrictor responses to acetylcholine in isolated rat hearts perfused at constant flow rate. Bolus injections of acetylcholine caused dose-dependent decreases in heart rate and increases in perfusion pressure. The ED50 (95% confidence) of acetylcholine for decreasing rate was 0.463 (0.336-0.640) nmol and the dose that increased perfusion pressure by 30 mm Hg (ED30 mmHg) was 3.19 (2.00-5.08) nmol. The M2 selective antagonist methoctramine (3.16 microM) produced a 307-fold increase in the ED50 for bradycardia but had no significant effect on the pressor response to acetylcholine. In marked contrast, the M3 antagonist hexahydrosiladifenidol displayed a distinct preference for inhibiting coronary vasoconstrictor responses to acetylcholine. When present at 316 nM, this drug produced a 66-fold increase in the ED30 mmHg but only a 6-fold increase in the ED50 for bradycardia. The M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine (316 nM) produced a 5- to 7-fold increase in both parameters. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (25 microg/kg, i.p.) essentially eliminated acetylcholine-evoked bradycardia although pressor responses persisted with some reduction. These observations demonstrate that cardiac and coronary vascular effects of acetylcholine can be clearly discriminated with specific muscarinic antagonists. Furthermore, they provide evidence that the M3 receptor subtype mediates the vasoconstrictor effect of acetylcholine on resistance vessels in rat heart.", 
    "119": "Recent research in rats and humans has shown that exogenous progesterone evokes a sleep profile similar to that induced by agonistic modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors, such as benzodiazepines. This finding suggests the involvement of the neuroactive metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone. In the vehicle-controlled study reported here, we assessed the sleep effects of two doses of allopregnanolone (7.5 and 15 mg/kg), mixed with oil, administered intraperitoneally at light onset in 8 rats. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram were recorded during the first 6 postinjection hr. Compared with vehicle, both doses of allopregnanolone reduced the latency to non-rapid eye movement sleep (non-REMS) and 15 mg/kg allopregnanolone significantly increased the time spent in pre-REMS, an intermediate state between non-REMS and REMS. Furthermore, allopregnanolone dose-dependently influenced EEG activity during non-REMS and REMS. In non-REMS, EEG activity was decreased in the lower frequencies (< or =7 Hz) and enhanced in the frequencies of > or =13 Hz. In REMS, allopregnanolone enhanced high-frequency EEG activity (> or =17 Hz). The effects were most pronounced during the first postinjection hours and gradually diminished thereafter. Analysis of the plasma and brain concentrations of allopregnanolone in 45 rats revealed long-lasting increases, which reached maximal levels during the first postinjection hour. The sleep effects of allopregnanolone are very similar to those elicited by larger doses of progesterone, which produce comparable brain levels of allopregnanolone. These data indicate that the steroid allopregnanolone has benzodiazepine-like effects on sleep.", 
    "120": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors are found on vagal afferent fibers. In pancreatic acini, CCK receptors exist in high- and low-affinity states. The aim of this study was to identify the vagal CCK-A receptor affinity state that mediates the effect of CCK on pancreatic protein secretion. Using a rat model with a pancreatic-biliary cannula, we studied the effects of CCK-JMV-180 on exocrine pancreatic function. CCK-JMV-180 acts as an agonist on high-affinity CCK receptors and as an antagonist on low-affinity CCK receptors. Infusion of CCK-JMV-180 (22-88 micrograms.kg-1.h-1) caused dose-dependent increases in pancreatic protein secretion, which were blocked by the CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718. Acute vagotomy in anesthetized rats and perivagal application of capsaicin in conscious rats abolished pancreatic responses to CCK-JMV-180 at 22 and 44 micrograms.kg-1.h-1. CCK-JMV-180 did not reduce pancreatic responses to CCK octapeptide infusion at 20 and 40 pmol.kg-1.h-1. To demonstrate that endogenously released CCK also acts on high-affinity CCK-A receptors, we showed that in conscious rats intraduodenal infusion of 18% casein produced a threefold increase in protein secretion and elevated plasma CCK levels from 0.7 to 8.4 pM. Infusion of CCK-JMV-180 at 44 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 failed to inhibit pancreatic responses to casein. In separate studies, perivagal application of 1% capsaicin inhibited 95% and 90% of the pancreatic responses to casein and casein combined with intravenous CCK-JMV-180, respectively. The neurotoxic effect of capsaicin on small-diameter sensory vagal fibers was verified by immunohistochemical and retrograde tracing studies. In conclusion, we demonstrated that in contrast to their effect on satiety, which is mediated by vagal low-affinity CCK-A receptors, exogenous CCK and endogenous CCK under physiological conditions act through high-affinity CCK-A receptors to mediate pancreatic protein secretion. These findings suggest that different affinity states of the vagal CCK receptors mediate different digestive functions.", 
    "121": "A set of force field parameters capable of reproducing the preferred conformations of the biologically important [1,4]-benzodiazepines was developed for AMBER and other molecular modeling programs that utilize the Weiner et al. force field. Equilibrium parameters were obtained from representative model compounds found in the Cambridge Structural Database, and bond stretching and torsion potential force constants were estimated using AM1 and PM3 semiempirical Hamiltonians. Parameters obtained with the two semiempirical methods and the existing linear interpolation method are compared. Molecular mechanics and dynamic simulations showed that AM1 derived parameters, together with MNDO ESP fitted atomic charges, predicted the X-ray structure of a number of representative [1,4]-benzodiazepines within 0.01 A, 0.8 degree, and 5 degrees, from observed bond lengths, bond angles, and bond torsions, respectively.", 
    "122": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of reduced doses of the benzodiazepine agonist quazepam in older insomniacs, 30 men and women > 60 years old with chronic insomnia were randomly assigned to receive 0, 7.5, or 15 mg quazepam. After two placebo nights, each subject received the appropriate dose for seven consecutive nights, which was followed by two placebo recovery nights. Both doses increased total sleep time relative to placebo during the early (nights 1 and 2) and late (nights 6 and 7) treatment phases. The low dose reduced sleep latency during the late phase, whereas the high dose reduced sleep latency in both early and late treatment phases. These observed hypnotic effects for both doses did not diminish over the seven nights of repeated administration. There also was a continued hypnotic effect during the two nights of placebo recovery for both doses. Analyses of plasma concentrations of quazepam and its metabolites suggested the continued drug effects on sleep during recovery are due to the metabolite desalkylflurazepam. In the safety evaluation done by means of adverse drug event assessments and postsleep questionnaires, the adverse events reported were minimal and not drug or dose related.", 
    "123": "In this multicenter, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, fixed-dose study, the efficacy, safety, dosing characteristics, and discontinuation of clonazepam were analyzed in patients with panic disorder. Four hundred thirteen patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo or one of five fixed daily doses of clonazepam (0.5 mg, 1.0 mg, 2.0 mg, 3.0 mg, and 4.0 mg). After 3 weeks of dose escalation, the fixed dose was given for 6 weeks (the dose-maintenance phase) and then was tapered during a 7-week discontinuance phase. The completion rates for the dose-maintenance phase ranged from 59 to 85% for the clonazepam groups (74% for the placebo group). Efficacy measurements at the end of the dose-maintenance phase indicated clinical improvement in all treatment groups but with a clear differentiation of the four higher doses of clonazepam from the 0.5-mg dose and placebo. The minimum effective dosage, as determined by the Williams' test, was 1.0 mg daily. Dose-response analysis showed that daily dosages of 1.0 mg and higher were equally efficacious in reducing the number of panic attacks. All treatments were well tolerated. Somnolence and ataxia were reported more often by patients in the 3.0- and 4.0-mg groups; depression, dizziness, fatigue, and irritability, although not showing dose-relatedness, were reported by more patients taking clonazepam than placebo. During the discontinuance phase, most patients worsened from their condition at the end of the dose-maintenance phase but did not revert to that at baseline. In addition, with the tapering schedule chosen for this study, patients in all treatment groups tolerated the discontinuance of clonazepam. Daily doses of 1.0 to 2.0 mg of clonazepam offered the best balance of therapeutic benefit and tolerability.", 
    "124": "Several benzodiazepines were enantioresolved on a new carbohydrate chiral stationary phase based on maltooligosaccharides. The role of organic modifier, ionic strength, pH and temperature are examined and the results are discussed. In general, selectivity and retention were found to decrease with increasing organic modifier concentration. The appearance of two peaks for diazepam suggests that the reported separations are based on separation of conformers and was supported using circular dichroism detection. Counterintuitively, resolution and enantioselectivity were found to improve with increasing temperatures.", 
    "125": "The brain cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-BR) is a major target for drug development because of its postulated role in modulating anxiety, memory, and the perception of pain. Drug discovery efforts have resulted in the identification of small synthetic molecules that can selectively activate this receptor subtype. These drugs include the peptide-derived compound PD135,158 as well as the nonpeptide benzodiazepine-based ligand, L-740,093 (S enantiomer). We now report that the maximal level of receptor-mediated second messenger signaling that can be achieved by these compounds (drug efficacy) markedly differs among species homologs of the CCK-BR. Further analysis reveals that the observed differences in drug efficacy are in large part explained by single or double aliphatic amino acid substitutions between respective species homologs. This interspecies variability in ligand efficacy introduces the possibility of species differences in receptor-mediated function, an important consideration when selecting animal models for preclinical drug testing. The finding that even single amino acid substitutions can significantly affect drug efficacy prompted us to examine ligand-induced signaling by a known naturally occurring human CCK-BR variant (glutamic acid replaced by lysine in position 288; 288E --> K). When examined using the 288E --> K receptor, the efficacies of both PD135,158 and L-740, 093 (S) were markedly increased compared with values obtained with the wild-type human protein. These observations suggest that functional variability resulting from human receptor polymorphisms may contribute to interindividual differences in drug effects.", 
    "126": "1. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A/central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) complex is a major inhibitory receptor in the vertebrate CNS. Binding of [11C]-flumazenil to this complex in vivo is reduced in hippocampal sclerosis (HS). It has been uncertain whether reduced cBZR binding is entirely due to neuronal loss in HS. 2. The objective of this study was to characterize abnormalities of the cBZR in HS with a correlative autoradiographic and quantitative neuropathological study. 3. Saturation autoradiographic studies were performed with [3H]-flumazenil to investigate relationships between neuronal density and receptor availability (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) in HS. Hippocampal tissue was obtained at surgery from 8 patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) due to HS and autopsies of 6 neurologically normal controls. Neuronal densities were obtained by means of a 3-D counting method. 4. Bmax values for [3H]-flumazenil binding in the subiculum, CA1, CA2, CA3, hilus and dentate gyrus were all found to be significantly reduced in HS compared with controls and significant increases in affinity were observed in the subiculum, hilus and dentate gyrus. In HS, cBZR density in the CA1 region was significantly reduced (P < 0.05) to a greater extent than could be attributable to neurone loss. In other regions, Bmax was reduced in parallel with neuronal density. 5. In HS, there is a loss of cBZR in CA1 over and above loss of neurones. This finding and increases in affinity for flumazenil in subiculum, hilus and dentate gyrus imply a functional abnormality of the GABAA/cBZR complex that may have a role in the pathophysiology of epileptogenicity in HS.", 
    "127": "Benzodiazepines are commonly used to supplement opioid analgesics in treating procedural pain during the treatment of major burn injuries. To date, no study has investigated whether benzodiazepines actually have an analgesic or anxiolytic effect in such circumstances. Seventy-nine patients admitted to a major regional burn center were randomly assigned to groups that received 1 mg of lorazepam or a placebo in addition to their standard opioid analgesics. A strong analgesic effect of lorazepam was not observed when treatment groups were compared independent of their baseline pain ratings. However when patients who had high baseline pain were compared, lorazepam resulted in a significant reduction in pain ratings (adjusted post-treatment VAS mean score = 54.28; adjusted control VAS mean score = 69.06). Trait anxiety did not predict those patients who had an analgesic effect with lorazepam, but state anxiety did prove to be a covariate with visual analogue score decreases in pain reports.", 
    "128": "We report a 64-year-old male with granulocytopenia and dermatitis due to cyanamide treatment. We administered cyanamide for alcoholism. After about one month he suffered from scaly erythema over his whole body and granulocytopenia (granulocyte; 140/microliter) with maturation arrest in bone marrow. After cessation of cyanamide and the start of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administration, the skin eruption ameliorated gradually, and the peripheral blood granulocyte counts increased. Cyanamide showed positive results in the drug lymphocyte stimulation test (198%) and the patch test led to the diagnosis of granulocytopenia and dermatitis induced by cyanamide. After restarting glibenclamide and diazepam administration, his granulocytopenia did not reoccur. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a case with granulocytopenia induced by cyanamide."
