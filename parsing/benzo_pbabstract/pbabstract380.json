Earlier studies have shown that temporal lobe epileptogenic regions may be identified readily by positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of regional benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor binding. We tested the specific applicability of this method in patients with FLE. Six patients with frontal partial seizures and 7 healthy men were investigated with PET and the BZD receptor ligand [11C]flumazenil. All patients had magnetic resonance (MR) brain scans. The independent assessment of seizure-onset region was based on seizure semiology, intra- and extracranial EEG and, in 4 cases, also on [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET. The epileptic focus/seizure-generating region was correctly identified by [11C]flumazenil PET in all patients. This region was characterized by a significant reduction in BZD receptor density. The area with reduced BZD receptor density was better delimited than the corresponding hypometabolic region, which was observed in 50% of patients investigated with [18F]FDG-PET. MRI was normal in 5 patients. Visualization of BZD receptors with [11C]flumazenil PET appears to be a promising approach for noninvasive identification of frontal lobe epileptogenic regions.", 
    "1": "Caring for the problem drinker in the perioperative period is a challenging task. If alcohol abuse is suspected, a careful assessment is indicated before surgery is performed. Both the CAGE and SMAST questionnaires are good screening tools for alcoholism. Preoperative evaluation of alcohol-dependent patients should include a complete blood count, blood urea nitrogen, serum electrolyte levels, creatinine and glucose levels, liver function tests, coagulation studies, an electrocardiogram and a chest radiograph. Smoking cessation and aggressive postoperative respiratory care are especially important for alcoholic patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Elective surgery should not be considered in patients with acute hepatitis or cirrhosis, since the operative mortality rate is quite high in these patients. Alcohol withdrawal is managed primarily with benzodiazepines, although clonidine and beta blockers may also be beneficial.", 
    "2": "The GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid-A) receptor gamma 2 subunit subtype is probably a functionally integral part of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABAA receptor complex, important for benzodiazepine pharmacology. We have evaluated the possibility of specifically reducing benzodiazepine receptor binding properties in vivo using phosphorothioate antisense oligodeoxynucleotides to inhibit the expression of GABAA receptor gamma 2 subunit subtype. Intracerebroventricular infusions of an antisense oligonucleotide reduced benzodiazepine receptor radioligand binding by 9-15% in specific rat brain regions.", 
    "3": "Benzodiazepines modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked chloride currents through a specific binding site at the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex. The heterogeneity of diazepam-sensitive benzodiazepine binding sites (type I and type II) has been identified by pharmacological approaches both with native receptors and recombinant receptors coexpressing alpha, beta and gamma subunits. In addition, two distinguishable diazepam-insensitive benzodiazepine sites are found, spatially distributed between cerebral cortical and cerebellar regions. Coexpression of alpha 6 with beta 2 and gamma 2L subunits creates a pharmacologically similar benzodiazepine receptor to the diazepam-insensitive site observed in cerebellum, however, there is no evidence regarding the possible subunit combination forming the DI site in cerebral tissues. Here we report the cloning of the human alpha 4 cDNA and its pharmacology by coexpression of this alpha 4 subunit with beta 2 and gamma 2L subunits. This recombinant receptor complex showed a high affinity for the previously described benzodiazepine partial agonist bretazenill, the pyrazoloquinoline compounds CGS-9895 and CGS-9896, as well as the inverse agonists DMCM (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy 4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) and Ro15-4513 as determined by [3H]Ro15-4513 binding. However, it is insensitive to the benzodiazepine type I selective compounds CL218.872 (3-methyl-6-[3-(trifluoromethyl)[phenyl]-1,2,4-triazolo[4.3-b]pyridazine ) and zolpidem as well as the benzodiazepine full agonists diazepam, halazolam and midazolam. In addition, the benzodiazepine receptor ligands DMCM, beta-CCE (beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester), Beta-CCM (beta-carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester), FG-7142, CGS-9895 and CGS-9896 showed 7 to 10 times higher affinity for alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L. The pharmacology of the alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L receptor complex appears to resemble those of the diazepam-insensitive site found in the cerebral cortex. Our study thus suggests that this subpopulation of diazepam-insensitive GABAA receptors may be composed of alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L subunits.", 
    "4": "A cDNA encoding the gamma 3 subunit of the human GABAA receptor has been obtained by molecular cloning. Its deduced amino acid sequence shows a high level of sequence identity with the published mouse and rat sequences (96%). The ligand binding pharmacology of the benzodiazepine site formed by stably-expressed human alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2S and alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 3 GABAA receptor subtypes have been compared for a number of ligands, Benzodiazepine site ligands were found to be either non-selective or gamma 2-selective, with the exception of CL218,872, which was found to be 10-fold selective for the alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 3-containing subtype Two benzodiazepine site ligands. Ro15-4513 and FG8205 were more efficacious at alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 3 receptors than alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes, CL218,872, which is a partial agonist at alpha 1 containing receptors, had no intrinsic activity at either alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 or alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 3, alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2S and alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 3 human GABAA receptors were also expressed in Xenopus oocytes and their benzodiazepine pharmacology investigated. Both the EC50 and efficacy of benzodiazepine site ligands were influenced by the type of gamma subunit coexpressed with alpha 1 and beta 2.", 
    "5": "In order to evaluate the effect of a collective agreement on change in GP's prescribing habits with regard to benzodiazepines and analgetics containing codeine, the prescriptions, measured in DDD, for the period September - November 1993 were compared with the prescriptions issued during the same period in 1994. All 11 general practitioners in three neighboring municipalities around the small town of R\u00f8ros took part in the project. Co-operation with the only pharmacy in the region was established. In 1993, baseline consumption of the actual drugs was slightly below the average for Norway. A total decline of approximately 50% in prescribed DDD was obtained, with a reduction in prescriptions for hypnotics, anxiolytics and analgetics alike.", 
    "6": "The effects of treatment with CCK receptor antagonists or administration of an antisense oligonucleotide to the gastrin receptor, on gastrin-I and cholecystokinin-8-induced acid secretion in mouse stomach were evaluated. Administration of gastrin-I (1 microM) or cholecystokinin-8 (30 nM) stimulated acid output at the rates of 2.6 +/- 0.27 and 1.0 +/- 0.21 microEq h-1, respectively. Gastrin-I-induced acid output was significantly blocked by pretreatment of stomachs with 3R[+]-N-[2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5- phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepin-3-yl]-N[3-methylphenyl[urea (L-365,260; 1 microM), but not by devazepide (L-364,718; 1 microM). Cholecystokinin-8-induced acid output, on the other hand, was sensitive to both L-365,260 (100 nM) and L-364,718 (100 nM). Administration of antisense, but not mismatch, oligonucleotide significantly reduced gastrin-induced acid output, while antisense oligonucleotide treatment had no effect on cholecystokinin-8-induced acid output. These results of antagonist and antisense oligonucleotide studies suggest that gastrin-I and cholecystokinin-8 may involve different receptor subtypes in stimulating gastric acid secretion in mice, and that antisense oligonucleotide administration may serve an useful tool in characterizing CCK/gastrin receptor subtypes.", 
    "7": "Kainate, an agonist at non-NMDA glutamate receptors, evoked strong concentration-dependent cobalt accumulation in the chick brain stem auditory nuclei angularis, laminaris (NL) and magnocellularis (NM). This effect could be blocked completely by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist CNQX and the AMPA antagonist GYKI 53655 but not by antagonists of NMDA receptors or voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Kainate (30 microM) evoked cobalt uptake from embryonic day (E)9 through E21, with a peak intensity at E15. Before E13, uptake occurred mainly in NL but declined markedly in NM after E15 and ceased in NL by E21. We conclude that calcium-permeable non-NMDA receptors are transiently expressed at the time when mature neuronal number, form and synaptic connectivity are established.", 
    "8": "Cytochromes P450 3A3/4 are inordinately important P450 enzymes catalyzing the metabolism of a large variety of clinically useful drugs, steroids, and carcinogens. Two monoclonal antibodies, MAb 3-29-9 and MAb 275-1-2, were prepared to human P450 3A4 from mice immunized with baculovirus-expressed human P450 3A4. MAb 3-29-9 was a powerful inhibitor of the enzymatic activity of P450 3A3/4/5. MAb 3-29-9 inhibited the P450 3A3, 3A4, and 3A5 catalyzed metabolism of substrates of divergent molecular weights, e.g., p-nitroanisole, phenanthrene, diazepam, testosterone, taxol, and cyclosporin. However, MAb 3-29-9 did not give a western blot with P450 3A3 or 3A4. MAb 275-1-2 was non-inhibitory but yielded a strong western blot with P450 3A3 and 3A4 but not with 3A5, and thus distinguished between 3A3/4 and 3A5. The two MAbs did not cross-react with human 2E1, 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, and 2C9; rat 2A1, 3A1/2, 4A1, 4A3, and 2B1; and mouse 1A1 and 1A2. MAb 3-29-9 has been used successfully to measure the quantitative contribution of P450 3A3 and 3A4 to the metabolism of the above-designated substrates in human adult liver. MAb 3-29-9 and MAb 275-1-2 are precise and sensitive reagents for P450 3A studies.", 
    "9": "The influence of various concentrations of ferrous iron and ascorbate on in vitro peroxidation and drug binding of diverse membrane preparations (cerebral cortex and liver) was studied. Peroxidation was not simply dose-related to ascorbate and ferrous iron, but a complex relationship between iron and ascorbate when added in association was established. Under our conditions 0.01 mM Fe2+ and 0.5 mM ascorbate was the most peroxidative combination for cerebral and liver membranes. Under the same conditions, cerebral membranes were more peroxidated than liver membranes. Considering the consequences of drug binding, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) of liver were more affected by peroxidative events than central-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBRs) of the cerebral cortex. The degree of binding disturbance was generally inversely correlated to the degree of peroxidation and this was more significant for liver PBRs than for cerebral CBRs. The liver membrane model was retained for testing in vitro protection by diverse putative antioxidants. Under our conditions desferrioxamine, ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA), trolox, and rutin were good protective antioxidants, whereas phenyl-butyl-nitrone (PBN) and tocopherol were not effective.", 
    "10": "In this study, we examined the effects of a novel water-soluble, putative AMPA receptor antagonist, (-)(3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3, 4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate (LY326325), on glutamate-, N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-, and kainic acid (KA)-induced elevations of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i) and 45Ca2+ uptake, as well as glutamate agonist-induced neurotoxicity in primary cultures of intact rat cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. In some experiments, the actions of LY326325 were tested in the presence of cyclothiazide, a compound that is known to block glutamate-induced desensitization of AMPA-preferring subtypes of glutamate receptors, thereby largely potentiating the functional effects of AMPA. LY326325 fully blocked the elevations of [Ca2+]i induced by NMDA and non-NMDA glutamate receptor agonists in both cortical and cerebellar granule neurons. The application of increasing concentrations of cyclothiazide was not able to reverse the LY326325-induced blockade of glutamate receptors in cortical neurons. In contrast, the same cyclothiazide treatment fully reversed the blockade produced by the noncompetitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2, 3-benzodiazepine HCl (GYKI 52466). In 45Ca2+ uptake studies. LY325325 inhibited the NMDA-, AMPA-, and KA-induced enhancement of 45Ca2+ uptake in a concentration-dependent fashion in both cortical and cerebellar granule cells. In analogy to the results obtained with [Ca2+]i recordings, cyclothiazide failed to counteract the LY326325-induced blockade of KA-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake in cerebellar granule neurons, whereas the blockade induced by the noncompetitive AMPA/KA receptor blocking agent GYKI 52466 was fully reversed by cyclothiazide. Because a similar, although not identical pattern of actions was seen following the application of the competitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist 6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(f)quinoxaline-2-3-dione (NBQX), it is suggested that the inhibitory actions of LY326325 are similar to those produced by NBQX but clearly differ from those caused by the noncompetitive AMPA/KA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466. Finally, when the neuroprotective actions of LY326325 on glutamate agonist-induced neurotoxicity were examined in cerebellar granule neurons, we found that LY326325 almost completely blocked the neurotoxic actions of NMDA, AMPA, and KA, respectively, whereas it produced only a partial blockade of glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, our current results suggest that although LY326325 blocked both nonNMDA and NMDA-induced Ca2+ responses, it still displayed a preferential affinity of nonNMDA receptors as compared to NMDA receptors. However, LY326325 appears to be a less selective AMPA/KA receptor antagonist than NBQX and GYKI52466, respectively.", 
    "11": "The existence of diurnal changes in postsynaptic expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors was assessed in cerebral cortex of Syrian hamsters by measuring [3H]GABA binding and the influx of 36Cl- in synaptoneurosomes. A diurnal variation in dissociation constant of [3H]GABA binding to cerebral cortex membranes, and the absence of diurnal differences in maximal number of sites, were found. When the nycthemeral changes in muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake by cortical synaptoneurosomes were assessed, a maximum occurred late at night (i.e. 0400 h). At 1600 h, micromolar concentrations of flunitrazepam potentiated significantly the influx of chloride induced by muscimol, while at 0400 h flunitrazepam did not exert any significant effect on 36Cl- uptake. The results indicate that postsynaptic type A GABAergic activity peaked at nocturnal hours in the cerebral cortex of Syrian hamsters.", 
    "12": "Death associated with anaesthetic procedures is rare, 1-4 deaths per 10,000 anaesthesias. However, each case gives rise to discussion about causality and who is to blame. Prospective studies are few, and comparison between them is difficult because of the use of different definitions of anaesthesia related death. A critically ill patient with impaired function of multiple organs seems to be at a higher risk of anaesthesia related death than a more healthy patient. However, no study has so far identified preoperative risk factors of anaesthesia related death. This is probably due to the low incidence of anaesthesia related death. The most common causes of anaesthesia related deaths are: 1) circulatory failure due to hypovolaemia in combination with overdosage of anaesthetic agents such as thiopentone, opioids, benzodiazepines or regional anaesthesia; 2) hypoxia and hypoventilation after for instance undetected oesophageal intubation, difficult intubation, technical failure in the anaesthetic equipment, or aspiration of gastric content, 3) anaphylactoid reactions including malignant hyperthermia, and 4) human negligence such as lack of vigilance or errors in the administration of drugs and in the maintenance and control of the anaesthetic equipment. We discuss the importance of continuing education for anaesthesiologists, development of a standard for surveillance during anaesthesia and quality control of the anaesthetic procedure with registration of undesired incidents. National registration of serious incidents will make it possible to determine the incidence of serious complications and death associated with anaesthesia. Hopefully this registration will provide information about causality and thereby facilitate prevention and improve patient safety during anaesthesia.", 
    "13": "The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system has consistently been implicated in the actions of (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and other hallucinogens. Recent evidence suggest that the 5-HT2A/2C receptor subtypes may be major targets for such drugs in the CNS. DOI-treated hooded rats (0.1-5.0 mg/kg) and DOI treated ICR mice (0.1-2.0 mg/kg), displayed aversions at lower doses and anti-aversions at higher doses to the open arms of the plus-maze. Mianserin (0.5 mg/kg) and ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg) blocked the anti-aversive behavior, but only mianserin was effective at reversing the aversions produced by the higher doses of DOI in the ICR mice. DOI produced an intense aversion in the DBA/2 and anti-aversion in the C57/BL6 mice to the open arms of the plus-maze. These opposing actions of DOI in the plus-maze may be exploited in studying the neurobehavioral effects of hallucinogens. Since flumazenil was ineffective at blocking the DOI induced changes, it was concluded that the mechanism of DOI induced anxiolysis or anxiogenesis may not involve an action at the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "14": "Our results indicate that benzodiazepine (Bz) treatment time, greater than 2-3 months, induce a decrease of both specific and nonspecific responses. Mice treated for different times with diazepam or chlordemethyldiazepam showed decreased survival to experimental Salmonella typhimurium infections after three months of treatment. Adherence, expressed as the polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) capacity to attach to nylon wool, was impaired after 7 days of treatment. Longer treatments further increase this impairment. PMN from mice treated with Bz for 90 days also demonstrate on impaired chemotaxis and phagocytosis for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Monocytes from mice treated for 7 days secreted more IL-1 alpha then controls; the antibody titer in mice given to prolonged treatment progressively diminished compared to controls. Con A or LPS stimulated lymphocytes showed an increase of H3-thymidine incorporation from mice treated for a short time and conversely a decreased incorporation when taken from mice that underwent longer treatments. Benzodiazepines were therefore found to affect PMN chemotaxis and phagocitosis, general immunity and survival of mice to infections.", 
    "15": "Panic disorder is a chronic illness that affects at least 3 percent of the population. Panic disorder is associated with significant morbidity and an increased risk of suicide. Patients generally present with multiple somatic and psychologic complaints, including heart palpitations, chest pain, tremor, shortness of breath, choking, nausea or abdominal distress, dizziness, derealization, fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying, paresthesias, chills or hot flushes, headache, diarrhea, insomnia, chronic fatigue, anxiety and depression. To make the correct diagnosis, these symptoms must be evaluated carefully since they also occur with serious cardiovascular, pulmonary, endocrinologic and neurologic disorders. Many effective treatments are available, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and clonazepam, and psychotherapy.", 
    "16": "The gut hormones, cholecystokinin (CCK) and truncated glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1(7-36)amide or GLP-1) both stimulate insulin secretion and affect glucagon secretion in mice, but their effects on the secretion of other islet hormones have not been established in rodents. In the present study, we have examined the influence of the C-terminal octapeptide of CCK, CCK-8, and GLP-1 on the secretion of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) in the mouse by the use of a radioimmunoassay for rodent PP. Mice were injected intravenously with CCK-8 (doses in the range of 0.053-5.3 nmol/kg) or with GLP-1 (doses in the range of 1-32 nmol/kg) and blood was sampled at 2, 6 or 10 min after the injection. Controls were injected with saline. It was found that CCK-8 at 5.3 nmol/kg increases plasma levels of both PP and insulin when the sample was taken at 2 min, but not at 6 or 10 min, after injection. These effects were blocked by the selective CCKA-receptor antagonist, L-364,718 (2.4 micromol/kg). GPL-1 increased plasma insulin levels at 32 nmol/kg at 2 and 6 min after the injection, but plasma PP levels were unaltered. In conclusion, this study, using a newly developed radioimmunoassay for PP in rodents, shows that CCK-8 but not GPL-1 stimulated PP secretion in mice at dose levels where both peptides stimulate insulin secretion. Furthermore, PP secretion in response to CCK-8 showed a similarity with that of insulin in terms of dose- and time-response characteristics as well as sensitivity to CCKA-receptor antagonism.", 
    "17": "The 7-(acyloxy)-6-arylpyrrolo[2,1-d][1,5]benzothiazepine derivatives have been recently proposed as a new class of ligands specific for the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (Fiorini et al. J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 1427-1438) (Greco et al. J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 4100-4108). In this paper we report the X-ray crystallographic structures of three potent (1-3) and two inactive (4 and 5) previously described benzothiazepines, as well as binding affinity constants for two newly assayed analogs in which the acyloxy side chain was replaced by a methoxy group (6) or removed (7). Structure-affinity relationships and molecular mechanics calculations performed using crystal structures as references have led to a revised 3D pharmacophore model accounting for all the data available up until now. Interestingly, the hypothetical receptor-bound conformations of 1-3 display a considerable degree of similarity with their crystal geometries. Additional calculations have confirmed that the poor affinities of benzothiazepines bearing an aroyloxy group (4 and 5) should be ascribed to the steric and/or electronic features of the side chain aryl moieties rather than to unfavorable conformational properties.", 
    "18": "The present study reports on the equilibrium association constant (KD) and receptor density (Bmax) values of a number of brain areas from the mesencephalon, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum for the overall benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites as well as for benzodiazepine binding site subtype 1 (BZ1) and subtype 2 (BZ2), determined by autoradiographical procedures using [3H] flunitrazepam. The differences between BZ1 and BZ2 binding sites were analyzed using the specific BZ1 agonist zolpidem as inhibitor of the radioligand. Statistically significant differences in the affinities of BZ2 with respect to BZ and BZ1 binding site were mainly found in cortical layers when pKD (negative logarithms of KD values) values were compared (ANOVA-SNK test). The distribution of Bmax, as well as the percentages of BZ1 and BZ2 and Hill coefficients which, surprisingly, are always close to 1 (> 0.9) for all the saturation kinetics analyzed, are also described. The possibility of heterogeneity related to anatomical distribution in the different subtypes is discussed.", 
    "19": "The GABA receptor subtype mediating responses of cerebellar Purkinje neurons to the neurotransmitter was evaluated and compared in GEPR-9 vs. nonepileptic, genetic control GEPR-NE rats. Quantitative analysis of responses to microiontophoretically applied GABA, muscimol and baclofen indicated that the inhibitory action of GABA on cerebellar Purkinje neurons was mediated by GABAA receptors since muscimol produced responses similar to those of GABA and baclofen was without substantial electrophysiological action. In addition, Purkinje neurons in GEPR-9 animals showed a similar reduced sensitivity to both GABA and muscimol. Radioligand binding studies using the GABAA receptor selective ligand, [3H]muscimol, and the benzodiazepine receptor selective ligand, [3H]flunitrazepam, were conducted on cerebellar and cortical homogenates from GEPR 9, GEPR-NE and Sprague-Dawley rats. No differences in the Kd or Bmax for these ligands among the three groups studied were observed. The lack of significant changes in the Kd and Bmax for these two ligands in the cerebellum suggests that the mechanism for the observed subsensitivity to GABA in the GEPR 9 rat lies beyond the level of the receptor, perhaps at the signal transduction process for GABA mediated inhibitory responses.", 
    "20": "In order to shorten anaesthesia induction and to avoid pain of the intramuscular injection, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of midazolam given by a jet-injector, utilized solely for mass inoculations until now. Premedication with midazolam with the jet-injector, indeed, proved to be effective, rapid and safe in children. The best results were found in two groups receiving 150-200 microgram/kg midazolam. Within 5 minutes, it was easy to cannulate a vein in children injected by the jet-injector, whereas the effect of intramuscular injection developed slowly, within 7 minutes. In the latter group, cannulation of the vein was more difficult than in the other groups. The separation from the parents and anaesthetic induction were greatly facilitated by midazolam given by the jet-injector. Amnesia was present not only for anaesthetic induction but also for the injection. Recovery was not more prolonged in those premedicated with midazolam with the jet-injector than with midazolam administered by other routes: oral, rectal or nasal. The children induced with the aid of jet-injector had no unpleasant recall based on interviews with the patients and parents.",

This ICD-10 based review of the literature provides help for general practitioners and other specialists in the short and long term treatment of anxiety as well as in the discontinuation of pharmacologic treatment. The author describes the use of high potency benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and 5 HT1A partial agonists and summarizes the disadvantages of some older drugs still in use for the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "22": "We have recently shown that CCKB receptor antagonists such as PD-134,308, 4-([2-[[3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-2-methyl-1-oxo-2-[[tricyclo[3.3.1.1]dec - 2-yloxy)carbonyl]amino]propyl]amino]-1-phenylethyl]amino)-4-oxo[R- (R*,R*)]-butanoate-N-methyl-D-glucamine, are able to strongly potentiate antinociception induced by endogenous enkephalins, protected from degrading enzymes by the mixed inhibitor RB 101, N-[(R,S)-2-benzyl-3[(S)-(2-amino-4- methylthio)butyldithio]-1-oxopropyl)-L-phenylalanine benzyl ester, at both spinal and supraspinal levels. In this study, the duration of this facilitatory response and the possible development of tolerance to this synergistic effect were investigated in the rat tail-flick test after acute and chronic treatment with PD-134,308 and RB 101. PD-134,308 facilitated and prolonged the antinociceptive responses induced by RB 101 (20 mg/kg, i.v.). The duration of the effect induced by PD-134,308 was also investigated by injecting this compound at different times before RB 101 administration. In the case of the tail-flick test, the improvement of RB 101 antinociceptive response was still significant 6 h after PD-134,308 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), whereas in the hot-plate test, this enhancement was only effective for 3 h after CCKB receptor antagonist administration. In the case of a repeated administration of RB 101, the potentiation induced by PD-134,308 on the antinociceptive effect produced by the first injection of RB 101 (20 mg/kg, i.v.), was found almost identical after a second administration of RB 101 performed 190 min later. Chronic administration of RB 101 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) plus PD-134,308 (3 mg/kg, i.p.) administered for 5 days both once or twice per day, did not induce the development of tolerance to antinociception at the peak effect time. However, a decrease in the duration of the antinociceptive response was observed. These results indicate that the potent and long-lasting antinociceptive response induced by the coadministration of the peptidase inhibitor and the CCKB receptor antagonist could have interesting perspectives in the clinical treatment of pain.", 
    "23": "Despite the presence of the multiple subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) and their isoforms for gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABAA) receptors in mammalian brains, the alpha x beta 2 gamma 2 subtypes appear to be the prototype GABAA receptors sharing many properties with native neuronal receptors. In order to gain insight into their subunit stoichiometry and orientation, we prepared a tandem construct of the alpha 6 and beta 2 subunit cDNAs where the carboxyl-terminal of alpha 6 is linked to the amino-terminal of beta 2 via a linker encoding 10 glutamine residues. Transfection of human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the tandem construct alone failed to induce GABA-dependent CI- currents, but its cotransfection with the cDNA for alpha 6 or gamma 2, but not beta 2, led to the appearance of GABA currents which were picrotoxin-sensitive and, in the case of gamma 2 containing receptors, responded to a benzodiazepine agonist, U-92330. The high affinity GABA site, however, was detected with [3H]muscimol binding in all combinations of the receptor subunits, including the tandem construct alone or with the beta 2. No appreciable differences were found in their Kd (2.5 nM) and Bmax values (1.4 pmol/mg of protein). These data are consistent with the view that the polypeptides arising from the tandem construct were expressed with the high affinity GABA site, but unable to form GABA channels. The requirement of a specific monomeric subunit (alpha 6 or gamma 2) for the tandem construct to express Cl--currents supports a pentameric structure of GABAA receptors consisting of two alpha 6, two beta 2, and one gamma 2 for the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 and three alpha 6 and two beta 2 for the alpha 6 beta 2 subtype.", 
    "24": "A mouse defense test battery (MDTB) has been designed to assess defensive reactions of Swiss-Webster mice to situations associated with nonpainful threat. When compared to mice approached by a leather glove, animals confronted with an anesthetized or a conscious rat displayed potentiated flight responses and defensive threat/attack reactions, while risk assessment performances were generally similar in all three conditions. Furthermore, escape attempt responses following removal of the stimulus were higher in the conscious rat condition compared to the two other groups. Taken together, these results suggest that flight reactions and defensive threat/attack responses are specific to the rat, and thus indicate that the MDTB may relate to 'antipredator' defense. In mice confronted with an anaesthetized rat, administration of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor full agonist chlordiazepoxide (5-25mg/kg, i.p., 30min) and the BZ partial agonist Ro 19-8022 (0.5-2mg/kg, i.p., 30min) altered one of two risk assessment measures and inhibited defensive attack behaviors, but failed to counter the post-predator increase in escape attempts. In addition, Ro 19-8022 also strongly reduced flight responses. The overall behavioral profile suggests a fear/anxiety-reducing action of both drugs. By contrast, administration of the BZ inverse agonist Ro 19-4603 (0.025-0.1mg/kg, i.p., 30min) reliably released these defensive responses. Interestingly, the BZ antagonist flumazenil (5-20mg/kg, i.p., 30min) manifested differential intrinsic activity depending upon the level of threat. Thus, in a weakly threatening situation, the drug potentiated flight reactions, indicating an inverse agonist-like action, decreased defensive biting in a highly threatening situation, indicating an agonist activity. These findings demonstrated that BZ ligands differently modulated 'antipredator' defense in Swiss-Webster mice, depending upon their intrinsic (positive or negative) efficacy, but also depending upon the defense strategy required by the threat.", 
    "25": "We have expressed a functional human muscarinic M2 receptor, under the control of the homologous discoidin I gamma promoter, in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum. The use of a contact site A leader peptide ensured insertion of the newly synthesized receptor protein into the plasma membrane. Due to the characteristics of the discoidin I gamma promoter, the M2 receptor is expressed during late growth and early development. The heterologously expressed M2 receptors show binding characteristics similar to authentic receptors. Membranes as well as whole cells can be used in ligand binding assays.", 
    "26": "Neurochemical accounts of panic disorder focus on peripheral indices of central transmitter activity, hormonal correlates and therapeutic efficacy. Anxiogenic agents augment norepinephrine activity, some anxiolytics increase serotonin neurotransmission while benzodiazepines and antidepressants influence catecholamine, indoleamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid turnover in infrahuman subjects. Reliable correlates of central transmitter activity in panic disorder are not in evidence. While animal models of anxiety may not mirror the symptom profile of panic, neurobiological accounts of panic disorder fail to consider extensive central colocalization of neurotransmitter and putative neurotransmitters. In effect, transmitter release in major ascending and descending transmitter systems is modulated by variable neuropeptide interfacing. The behavioral concomitants of psychological disturbance likely follow from variable neurochemical release induced by stimuli as well as conditioning and sensitization. The functional role of receptor sites associated with multiple neurochemical systems may vary and the sensitivity and/or density of receptor sites may be modified. Accordingly, the behavioral and neurochemical concomitants of acute and chronic pathology may be fundamentally different from one another. The present review argues that the symptoms of panic disorder and the etiology of the illness must be evaluated against a background of genetic, organismic and experiential factors. Such variables presumably underlie the diverse behavioral symptoms associated with panic disorder and variations in the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological treatment.", 
    "27": "Previous clinical and experimental studies have shown evidence of a leakage of whole bacteria and bacterial products after major trauma through the gut barrier. By determining plasma endotoxin levels, products of the arachidonic pathway, interleukin-6, and the endotoxin-neutralizing capacity (ENC) of plasma during colonoscopy, we studied the gut barrier function and the pathogenetic sequelae of mediator release during a minimally invasive procedure.", 
    "28": "Thirty-two patients were enrolled in a controlled prospective study. Endotoxin and ENC were determined by a chromogenic modification of the limulus amebocyte lysate test. Prostanoids and interleukin-6 were measured using commercially available ELISA tests. C-reactive protein levels were checked by nephelometry.", 
    "29": "Twenty-one of the 32 patients had elevated endotoxin plasma levels during colonoscopy. In one patient, gut-derived bacteria were detected in plasma. ENC decreased after 5 min, and thromboxane B2 levels also started to increase at that time. No acute-phase response took place after 24 h.", 
    "30": "During colonoscopy, endotoxin can be detected in blood. ENC measurement was shown to be even more sensitive. The pathogenetic sequelae leading to gut barrier failure remain unclear, because mediator release and endotoxemia, as checked by ENC, took place simultaneously.", 
    "31": "GYKI 52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] has been described as a non-competitive AMPA (non-NMDA glutamate) receptor antagonist. In the present paper some behavioral effects of GYKI 52466 were studied in male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice. GYKI 52466 reduced the locomotor activity in normal rats and mice, without evoking any symptoms of behavioral stimulation. The CGP 37849-induced hyperlocomotion was increased by GYKI 52466. The akinesia in monoamine-depleted rats was not affected by the drug studied. The antiakinetic effect of L-DOPA was not changed by GYKI 52466, whereas the antiakinetic effect of L-DOPA+CGP 37849 was decreased. GYKI 52466 increased the hyperlocomotion induced by apomorphine or cocaine. The drug did not change the catalepsy induced by haloperidol or fluphenazine, as well as the anticataleptic effect of CGP 37849. GYKI 52466 was inactive in the forced swimming test, but increased the antidepressant effect of CGP 37849. The flexor and extensor muscle tone of the rats hind limb was not modified by GYKI 52466. The results obtained indicate that GYKI 52466 shows a neuropharmacological profile similar but not identical with that of the quinoxalines (competitive AMPA receptor antagonists) studied previously.", 
    "32": "State of the art of pharmacology of tolerance to and dependence on benzodiazepine receptor ligands is shortly summarized. Firstly, the inadequacies of animal models of drug-dependency are underlined. Then, some elements of molecular biology of the GABA-A receptor complex are described to give a theoretical background for discussing pharmacological profiles of action of the selective type 1 (e.g. zolpidem), and partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g. bretazenil). These groups of benzodiazepine receptor ligands are considered to exhibit low tolerance and dependence liability. The evidence from behavioral and electrophysiological experiments so far favors the concept that the gradually developing hypofunction of the brain GABA system is the basis for tolerance to benzodiazepines, and the cause of abstinence symptoms. Receptor binding studies on adaptive changes in the GABA-A and benzodiazepine receptors after chronic benzodiazepine administration, insofar gave negative or contradictory results. The available up to now data on the long-term processes occurring in the subunits of the GABA-A receptor complex are also not homogenous, and it is difficult to discuss them. Likewise, the contribution of neurosteroids and specific ligands of the peripheral type of benzodiazepine receptor to the discussed phenomenona, is a matter of controversy. In conclusion, it should be stressed that the selective type 1 benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists, either due to excitation of a smaller fraction of receptors, or lower efficacy, do not entirely readjust the function of the GABA-A receptor complex, thus leaving the place for action of the endogenous neurotransmitter. Such profile of central activity should prevent the development of strong tolerance and abstinence symptoms.", 
    "33": "The effect of flumazenil (FLU) on plasma protein binding of diazepam (DZ), nordiazepam (ND) and oxazepam (OX) was determined in plasma from drug-naive dogs to which graded concentrations of tested drugs alone and in combination were added. The results revealed that as the concentration of FLU added to plasma alone was increased its binding with plasma proteins decreased and that there were no significant binding interactions between FLU and OX, ND and DZ.", 
    "34": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating. Deficits in PPI are observed in schizophrenia patients and can be modelled in animals by administration of noncompetitive NMDA antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) or dizocilpine (MK-801). Previous studies indicate that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine restores PPI in PCP-treated animals while the typical antipsychotic haloperidol does not. Olanzapine (LY170053) is a novel putative atypical antipsychotic that shares many pharmacological and behavioral properties with clozapine. The present study assessed the ability of olanzapine (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) to antagonize deficits in PPI produced by PCP (1.5 mg/kg) and dizocilpine (0.1 mg/kg). At the two highest doses, olanzapine significantly increased PPI in PCP- and dizocilpine-treated animals without affecting PPI or baseline startle reactivity by itself. These results support the notion that olanzapine is functionally similar to clozapine and may have utility as an atypical antipsychotic agent.", 
    "35": "The effects of lorazepam (1,2 mg) and placebo on encoding, remembering and awareness were assessed in a study with 54 healthy volunteers. All subjects studied stimulus materials in a levels of processing (L-o-p) task. Half the subjects were assessed on an explicit memory task of word recognition and the other half were given an implicit memory task of word-stem completion. Following the implicit task, awareness of retrieval was further investigated by questions and by subjects' recollective experience in recognising the actual words they had completed from stems. L-o-p effects and marked lorazepam-induced impairments were found in the implicit task of word-stem completion although the interaction between L-o-p and drug effects emerged only as a trend in the data. Lorazepam-induced impairments on stem-completion may then be explained at least in part as being due to contamination by explicit retrieval processes, but we cannot rule out the possible role of drug effects on perceptual processes at encoding. Results from responses to \"awareness\" questions and from analysis of subsequent recollective experience indicated that subjects were not aware of using explicit retrieval during the implicit task. Results also replicated previous findings showing that both lorazepam and L-o-p independently affect performance in an explicit memory task of word recognition. Thus drug-induced deficits at encoding persist regardless of the level at which information is initially processed.", 
    "36": "Therapeutic response to lorazepam and dopaminergic metabolism were investigated in 18 neuroleptically naive acute catatonic patients. They were diagnosed as catatonic according to criteria by Lohr and Rosebush and treated exclusively with lorazepam (2-4 mg) during the first 24 h. Dopaminergic metabolism (plasma HVA, plasma MHPG), anxiety (HAM-A) and parkinsonic/dyskinetic movements (SEPS, AIMS) were measured under standard conditions before initial treatment with lorazepam (day 0) and 24 h after initial treatment (day 1). On day 0 responders to lorazepam treatment (complete remission of catatonic syndrome after 24 h according to Rosebush and Lohr) showed significantly higher (P = 0.004) plasma HVA (130.4 +/- 51.2 pmol/ml; means +/- SD) than non-responders (no remission of catatonic syndrome after 24 h; 73.2 +/- 40.5 pmol/ml; means +/- SD). On day 1 plasma HVA did not differ any more significantly between both groups Clinically, responders showed significantly higher HAM-A (P = 0.025) and AIMS (P = 0.022) scores as well as significantly lower SEPS (P = 0.049) scores than non-responders on day 0. Hence catatonic short-term responders and nonresponders to lorazepam can be distinguished with regard to plasma HVA, anxiety and dyskinetic/parkinsonic movements.", 
    "37": "In a double-blind, six-way crossover study the effects on psychomotor performance and memory of single doses of Ro 41-3696 (1, 3, 5 and 10 mg), a novel non-benzodiazepine partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, zolpidem (10 mg) and placebo were compared after night-time administration to 12 healthy young male subjects. Psychomotor performance tests (tracking and attention as part of a standardized task battery) were conducted just before and at 1.5 and 8 h after drug intake. The memory test consisted of the recall of a list of 15 words at 8 h after drug intake which had been learned at 1.5 h after intake. At 1.5 h after drug intake 10 mg zolpidem induced markedly larger psychomotor effects than any dose of Ro 41-3696. The effects of 5 and 10 mg Ro 41-3696 and zolpidem were significantly greater than those of placebo (P < 0.05). The following morning, 8 h after drug intake, the slight residual effects of 5 and 10 mg Ro 41-3696 were statistically significantly greater than placebo, whereas zolpidem effects did not differ from placebo. The results of the memory test showed that learning as well as recall were most clearly impaired by zolpidem. An influence of Ro 41-3696 on these variables was not observed for doses up to 5 mg. In conclusion, Ro 41-3696 at all doses tested induced less effects on psychomotor performance and memory than 10 mg zolpidem at 1.5 h after intake. However, the effects of Ro 41-3696 appeared to be of longer duration.", 
    "38": "Preclinical data suggest that the imidazodiazepinone derivative bretazenil (Ro 16-6028) has anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties with only weak sedative effects. We examined the influence of oral administration of 1 mg bretazenil on the sleep EEG and the concomitant nocturnal secretion of cortisol, growth hormone and prolactin in ten healthy young men. After bretazenil we found a significant increase in stage 2 sleep and a significant reduction in stage 3 sleep. REM latency was prolonged. Spectral analysis of sleep-EEG power revealed a decrease in delta and in theta power and an increase in sigma power. We found no significant influence on sleep onset latency or on intermittent wakefulness. Bretazenil prompted a significant decrease in cortisol secretion and a significant increase in prolactin release. It had no major influence on growth hormone secretion.", 
    "39": "In a test of the reinforcing efficacy of triazolam under an oral drug self-administration procedure, three baboons consumed higher volumes of triazolam than of vehicle. Although these results suggested that triazolam was serving as a reinforcer, the unconditioned effect of triazolam itself on drinking remained unclear. Therefore, the effect of pretreatment with triazolam on consumption of a nondrug fluid was assessed in sessions that were otherwise identical to oral drug self-administration sessions. Following oral pretreatment with triazolam (0.6-19.2 mg total dose), there was a dose-dependent increase in drinking, suggesting that triazolam increased fluid consumption per se. However, subsequent manipulations showed that following pretreatment with triazolam, there was no systematic change in tap water consumption from the regular drinking spout and that the dipsogenic effect of pretreatment with triazolam was not specific to a particular fluid; however, the effect was specific to prior experience with the oral self-administration procedure. Thus, the dose-related increase in consumption from the drinkometer spout following triazolam pretreatment most likely is explained as the \"priming\" or \"reinstatement\" of an operant that previously had produced drug reinforcement, even though extinction (i.e., substitution of the drug vehicle) was in effect.", 
    "40": "The binding of warfarin, a series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a series of benzodiazepines to rat serum albumin (RatSA) and rabbit serum albumin (RabSA) was compared with their binding to human serum albumin (HSA) using high-performance liquid chromatography on stationary phases based on immobilized albumins. The effect of the addition to the mobile phase of compounds known to bind to HSA at site I (phenylbutazone) or at site II (R- and S-ibuprofen) or at both sites (2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid) was investigated on all three proteins. The results indicated that for the chiral compounds studied, the stereoselectivity of drug binding was much lower on RatSA than on HSA. On RatSA and RabSA, the benzodiazepine site was not a major binding site for R- and S-ibuprofen. The results indicated the existence of two binding sites for R and S warfarin on RatSA and probably on RabSA. On RatSA, one site is the major stereoselective site and is the major binding site of phenylbutazone and piroxicam. The other one is a major binding site for R- and S-ibuprofen and R- and S-ketoprofen.", 
    "41": "The practice of anaesthesia has changed considerably over the past 20 to 30 years owing largely to technological advances in patient monitoring and an expanded and improved pharmacological repertoire. While patient safety in anaesthesia has greatly improved, the risk of neurological and psychiatric adverse effects of anaesthetics remains and is the focus of continued investigation. For example, a great deal of attention has recently been directed at intraoperative awareness. This adverse event can be caused by delivering an inappropriate amount or type of anaesthetic. Another risk of anaesthesia involves drug-induced unpleasant subjective states in patients. Those drugs most frequently associated with these states include ketamine, droperidol and scopolamine. This risk can often be attenuated by careful adjustment of drug dose and the use of adjunctive agents such as benzodiazepines which may produce amnesia of the unpleasant subjective state. While it is well established that modern anaesthetic drugs cause acute impairment of cognition and psychomotor functioning, there is little evidence that these drugs have long term impairing effects. Finally, a particular kind of surgery, cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass, can be associated with adverse neurological and psychiatric sequelae which, while not directly related to anaesthesia, are of intense interest to anaesthesiologists.", 
    "42": "In this study, we present five cases of seizures following withdrawal of flunitrazepam, lorazepam, or triazolam, representing 3% of a sample consisting of 153 patients dependent on benzodiazepines. Both abrupt cessation of benzodiazepine intake and high-dose use seem to be critical for the appearance of seizures. Pharmacological features, such as short elimination half-life and high potency, might explain the higher risk of seizures observed in these patients.", 
    "43": "One hundred and sixty patients (mean age 39.8 years; 67% female) diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) who had completed a prospective, 8 week, double-blind comparison of lorazepam (mean daily dose 4.2 mg) and ipsapirone (mean daily dose 19.5 mg) were rapidly tapered by a substitution of half-strength medication for 3 days, then substitution of matched placebo for an additional 11 days. Patients treated with ipsapirone showed no rebound anxiety on discontinuation, nor any other significant increase in withdrawal symptomatology compared to patients who had been prospectively treated with placebo. In contrast, patients treated with lorazepam showed significant emergent anxiety and/or withdrawal-related symptomatology by almost all clinical measures employed. Overall, 25% of patients treated with lorazepam showed rebound anxiety, and 40% of them utilized reserve medication because they found drug discontinuation to be intolerable. The clinical implications for discontinuation of benzodiazepines after short-term therapy are discussed.", 
    "44": "Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) has been recently used in alcohol detoxification, but conflicting data are available concerning the central mechanism of action of this GABA catabolite. GHB ability to stimulate growth hormone (GH) secretion has been reported. Our previous studies revealed the ability of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) to counteract GHB effects on GH secretion. Other hypotheses, including an opioid or serotonergic role of GHB, have been considered. In the present study we investigated GH responses to GHB with or without naloxone (an opiate receptor antagonist) or metergoline (a serotonin receptor antagonist) pretreatment. This study included 10 male healthy volunteers (aged 24.3 +/- 2.9 years) who were submitted to four tests in random order: (A) oral GHB administration; (B) oral GHB and i.v. naloxone administration; (C) oral GHB and oral metergoline administration; and (D) oral placebo and i.v. saline administration. Blood samples for GH assay were collected during the three tests at -15, 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 90 min. GHB induced a significant increase in GH plasma levels; naloxone pretreatment did not antagonize GHB action on GH secretion; metergoline significantly decreased GH response to GHB (p < 0.05). No changes were obtained with placebo and saline administration. The opioid system does not seem to be involved in GHB effects on GH-secreting pituitary cells; GHB effects on the serotonergic system influencing GH secretion, on the other hand, cannot be excluded.", 
    "45": "Although neuroleptic drugs have proven value in the management of patients with schizophrenia, the existing drugs are far from ideal. The pharmacological profile of olanzapine (LY 170053, Lilly) in animal models suggests that it may be an effective antipsychotic drug in humans, with the potential for a reduced incidence of desirable extra-pyramidal side effects, compared to existing neuroleptics. The results of this first investigation of olanzapine in schizophrenic patients indicate that it has efficacy as an antipsychotic compound, relieving positive and negative features of schizophrenia. Olanzapine appears to have an acceptable degree of overall tolerability, and may be associated with a low incidence of extrapyramidal tract symptoms. It does not appear to be free of adverse effects on liver function.", 
    "46": "Trimethyltin (TMT) is a toxicological agent that produces damage in a number of limbic structures, resulting in concomitant disruptions of behavior. The purpose of the present study was to determine the utility of response-duration differentiation (RDD) responding as a behavioral baseline for studying the behavioral consequences of TMT administration. Under the RDD schedule, responses of a restricted duration (1-1.3 s) were reinforced, and disruption of this performance may represent effects upon fine motor control, timing behavior, or both. Two doses of TMT (4 mg/kg) were administered 1 week apart, and behavior under the schedule was studied daily for 6 weeks thereafter in a group of four rats. Additionally, the effects of diazepam (0.1-3mg/kg) administered prior to and following TMT administration were compared. TMT produced disruptions in accuracy of responding and increases in rates of responding in the weeks following its administration. Behavior had generally recovered by 6 weeks after the first TMT administration. Diazepam flattened the relative frequency distributions of response durations at lower doses in the TMT-treated rat. These data show that RDD responding is sensitive to the effects of TMT, and TMT treatment can result in alterations in the effects of diazepam.", 
    "47": "We investigated the bacterial contamination of commonly used intravenous anaesthetic agents. Ten trainee anaesthetists drew up four syringes each of propofol, midazolam, thiopentone, 0.9% saline and a culture medium control using their normal practice. A set of syringes was cultured at the time of drawing up and at 2, 4 and 8 h afterwards. No anaesthetist washed his or her hands before drawing up the drugs. Six anaesthetists capped the syringes using sheathed needles. Eight syringes were contaminated with bacteria. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from six syringes (four sheathed and two unsheathed) and an Acinetobacter sp. from two syringes (one sheathed and one unsheathed). No bacteria were cultured from the midazolam syringes. However, two syringes from each of the other solutions were contaminated. This implies that one syringe was contaminated when it was drawn up, at 2 h a further two had detectable contamination, two more were contaminated at 4 h and three more at 8 h. We cannot recommend drawing up drugs at the start of a list for use later in the day. They should be used immediately after drawing up. Basic hand washing before drawing up drugs may reduce contamination.", 
    "48": "We evaluated the addition of midazolam to propofol during induction of anaesthesia by assessing laryngeal mask tolerance, haemodynamic variables, recovery times and cost. Forty patients (ASA grades I-IV) undergoing elective surgery were allocated randomly to receive a standard dose of propofol or a smaller dose of propofol combined with midazolam. A laryngeal mask was inserted and any episodes of coughing or hiccuping during its insertion or removal were recorded. Anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide and enflurane with fentanyl for analgesia. After surgery, recovery times, pain, shivering, nausea, vomiting and analgesic requirements were recorded. The cost of the drugs used was also calculated. No significant differences were detected in any variables, except that patients given propofol needed more morphine in the recovery ward. The average cost of propofol alone was 3.47 pounds per anaesthetic, while the midazolam plus propofol cost was 2.03 pounds. Adding midazolam to propofol allowed a reduced dose of propofol to be used without adverse effects, while reducing the anaesthetic costs.", 
    "49": "The term co-induction of anaesthesia has been applied to the use of two or more drugs to induce anaesthesia. The term was introduced in 1986 to describe the unplanned induction of anaesthesia by non-anaesthetically trained personnel practising sedation. A new benzodiazepine was combined with opioids, with synergistic effects, causing unplanned anaesthesia in an unsuitable environment leading to several fatalities. Currently, planned co-induction of anaesthesia is practised by anaesthetists exploiting drug interactions, particularly synergism, principally between midazolam, fentanyl, sufentanil and alfentanil, and propofol. It can produce an improvement in all phases of anaesthesia, including induction, maintenance and recovery. There are advantages in combining midazolam with propofol, thereby reducing the risk of awareness and also the dose of propofol and hence its side-effects and cost. Propofol is the principal intravenous induction agent for day-case anaesthesia. The pre-administration of 0.03 mg kg-1 of midazolam (approximately 2 mg in normal healthy adults) is now being practised widely. Current papers suggest that 2 mg of midazolam administered to an average, otherwise healthy, adult does not compromise recovery, whereas an increase to 5 mg may be expected to delay the possibility of final discharge of such patients by about 20 min. The use of midazolam and propofol with or without either fentanyl or alfentanil is probably the principal technique for the induction of day-case anaesthesia at the present time. A major advantage is that by reducing the dose of propofol there is less chance of the severe bradycardia that is sometimes associated with the combined use of propofol and opioids, although this can be prevented by vagolytic agents. However, the use of opioids increases the incidence of post-operative nausea and vomiting. Another important drug is ketamine, the effects of which are often additive with other drugs. The combination of ketamine and midazolam is an important technique, particularly in the management of critically ill patients. The alpha 2-agonists, e.g. clonidine and dexmedetomidine, may also have a role in this context in the future. This paper presents the current approach to the co-induction of anaesthesia, particularly in relation to the reduced risk of awareness when using midazolam, and the health economics in relation to the potential reduction in the dose and hence cost of propofol.", 
    "50": "The spectrum of effects that constitutes the state of general anaesthesia can be induced by the combined use of drugs. Each drug has a predominant action regarding one of the anaesthesia components, hypnosis, analgesia and amnesia. However, each agent, when used in combination, not only produces its own expected effect, but it can also modify the effect of another agent acting on a different component. For example, an opioid, in addition to its anti-nociceptive effect, can also potentiate the hypnotic effect of a benzodiazepine. Anaesthetists have long recognized these effects but did not quantify them until recently. Pharmacologists have provided us with techniques to measure drug interactions. We have utilized these techniques to demonstrate and quantify significant pharmacological interactions for hypnotic effect with commonly used intravenous agents. The clinical utility of these combinations can now be exploited precisely for the benefit of all our patients.", 
    "51": "Combination therapy with two or more different drugs, with the intention of reaching the same therapeutic goal, was heavily criticized for a long time. However, it is accepted today, especially when advantages over monotherapy can be shown. For the induction of anaesthesia or for long-term sedation in the intensive care unit, combination therapy may offer an improved effect profile, a more balanced ratio of desired versus adverse effects, an improved time-course of effect, simpler treatment requirements or lower costs. Midazolam and propofol have been investigated as potential partners for those two indications. The mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic properties, pharmacological effect, the way in which they interact at the receptor site, the differences in pharmaceutical formulations, the side-effect profiles and economic considerations were compared. Animal experiments and clinical pharmacology studies have shown that midazolam and propofol have synergy with other centrally active drugs. It could be expected that the relationship between desired effects and adverse effects could be improved by skilful use of the synergism between midazolam and propofol. Co-induction of anaesthesia and co-administration in long-term sedation can offer improvements in therapeutic situations compared with monotherapy. These improvements are in terms of a more suitable effect profile, a more favourable ratio of desirable effects to side-effects, optimization of the time-course of effects and reduced costs.", 
    "52": "Prenatal benzodiazepine exposure has been reported to result in abnormal neurobehavioural development in laboratory animals but little is known about the behavioural relevance of this effect ina naturalistic environment. In this study, outbred CD-1 male mice were prenatally exposed to oxazepam (15 mg/kg per os, twice daily) on days 12-16 of fetal life and fostered at birth to untreated dams. At adulthood, each mouse was fitted with a radio collar and its first reactions assessed. Three hours later, behavioural and exploratory activities were recorded in a laboratory open field, and 24 h later in a natural setting. Immediate reactions to the radio collar were higher in the oxazepam-treated mice than in controls consisting of more attempts to remove it and an increase of push-digging. The attempts to remove the collar were still evident in oxazepam treated mice tested in the laboratory open-field 3 h later. Moreover, oxazepam increased the frequency of grooming and reduced walking in both the laboratory and the natural settings. In the natural settings running was increased during the initial 30-min test, while a pronounced level of grooming and a lower frequency of eating were observed 140 min after release. Frequency of sniffing, grooming, and rearing behaviours were higher in the laboratory test when compared to the natural settings. On the other hand, prolonged bouts of sniffing were recorded in the natural environment. These findings permit separation of robust drug effects (increased grooming, reduced walking) from situation-dependent effects, the natural environment revealing, in addition, more subtle effects.", 
    "53": "There is evidence that activity at the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex in specific brain areas might be enhanced during rodent motherhood. We tested the hypothesis that the manipulation of this neurochemical system by prenatal benzodiazepine exposure affects typical behavioral responses of lactating mouse dams. Outbred CD-1 mouse fetuses were administered either oxazepam (OX, 15 mg/kg) or vehicle twice a day on embryonic days 12-16 and fostered at birth to untreated dams. Female offspring were subsequently mated at the young adult stage. In a first experiment, the behavioural repertoire of the two groups of lactating females was scored (single 10-min session) from postpartum days 3 to 18. When compared with VEH dams, OX females showed a shorter duration of pup-sniffing at 7-10 days and enhanced crouching behaviour when pups had reached the age of 14-18 days. In addition, OX-treated dams used more cotton for nest construction than the controls. The two female groups were differentiated only in the presence of their offspring. In a second experiment aimed at investigating possible OX-induced changes in pup-stimulus perception, the same lactating females were challenged in sequence on postpartum day 8 with three different patterns of pup-related cues consisting of: three 8-day-old live male pups (LP), three same-age dead pups DP, or three dead pups accompanied by pre-recorded ultrasounds (DPU). In the absence of carry-over effects of prenatal dam treatment, LP stimuli elicited a higher frequency of sniffing and digging than the others, whereas the level of licking, and grooming was reduced. In conclusion, the present results indicate that the slight alteration in maternal care resulting from prenatal OX treatment can be dissociated from changes in pup-related stimulus perception.", 
    "54": "Utilizing psychogenetically selected Roman high- and low-avoidance rats (RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh), the present experiments investigated the effects of prenatally administered vehicle and diazepam (1 and 3 mg/kg per day, SC) on the behavior and neurochemistry of adult, male offspring. Active, two-way avoidance behavior was analyzed in 96 rats, at 6 months of age, and swimming navigation in 68 others, at 11 months. Three weeks after testing, selected brain areas from the latter animals were immunoassayed for benzodiazepine (BZD)-like molecules. The 3 mg/kg dose of diazepam both decreased freezing behavior in the shuttle box and reduced the hippocampal content of BZD-like molecules in the RLA/Verh male rats. Swimming navigation (spatial learning), at which the RLA/Verh rats were more adept, was not specifically affected by prenatal diazepam in either rat line.

Displacement studies using marker compounds for the major drug binding sites showed that oxaprozin has a high affinity for the benzodiazepine/indole site and binds to the warfarin site but with a significantly lower affinity. Biochromatography and ultrafiltration techniques were used to screen for possible competition and allosteric interactions between oxaprozin and potential co-administered drugs including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antipyretics, hypoglycaemics, inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme, anaesthetics, metal ions and anticancer agents. Competition occurred mainly with drugs bound at the benzodiazepine site (benzodiazepines, various non-steroidal anti-inflammatories).", 
    "56": "The effect of melathonine on behavior of rats under conditions of conflict situation is studied in experiments conducted in morning evening hours. The drug suppressed the response of rats on painful irritation and increased a number of taking water from drinking bowl. This effect of melathonine was more pronounced in the evening trials. The effects of melathonine were comparable with the influence of conventional benzdiazepine tranquilizer, diazepine, on the animal behavior.", 
    "57": "1. Patterns of drug treatment and the use of polypharmacy in schizophrenic in-patients were compared and evaluated in the University Teaching Hospitals of Psychiatry in Badajoz, Spain, Huddinge, Sweden, and Tartu, Estonia. 2. The medical records of up to 100 consecutively admitted patients were retrospectively reviewed using a standardized data form. 3. The male patients were significantly younger than females in all study locations, but there were no age differences between the locations. The length of stay was equal for the two series in the same hospital, but considerably longer in Tartu than in Badajoz and Huddinge. 4. The neuroleptic drugs used most commonly in Badajoz and Tartu were similar in prescription frequency and in the doses prescribed, but different from those used in Huddinge. Haloperidol was the most frequently prescribed neuroleptic in Badajoz and Tartu, accounting for one third of all neuroleptic prescriptions. In Huddinge the choice of neuroleptics was more evenly spread over several compounds. Intramuscular injections other than depot preparations were commonly used in Tartu and Badajoz, but not in Huddinge. 5. At least two neuroleptics were prescribed simultaneously on 73% of treatment days in Badajoz and 46% in both Huddinge and Tartu. The average cumulative daily doses of concomitant multiple neuroleptic treatment, expressed in chlorpromazine equivalents, were lower in Huddinge than in the other study locations and higher for male patients in Badajoz and Tartu. 6. Anticholinergics were used together with neuroleptics in 42% of treatment days in Badajoz and 30% in Huddinge as compared with 75% in Tartu. The use of anticholinergics increased in parallel to the increase in the number and the cumulative dose of concomitant neuroleptics in all study locations. 7. About 15% of patients in Badajoz and Tartu, but only 1% in Huddinge, received concomitant treatment with antidepressant drugs. The simultaneous use of antidepressants and benzodiazepines was inversely related to the number and the cumulative dose of neuroleptics in Badajoz and Tartu. In contrast, the cumulative dose and number of neuroleptics were greater, when additional benzodiazepines were prescribed in Huddinge. 8. The study in schizophrenic in-patients revealed that polypharmacy with concomitant multiple neuroleptics, additional anticholinergics and other psychotropics is an international phenomenon.",

Nerve stimulation was followed immediately by a transient increase in short-circuit current (SCC) and in the potential difference (PD), which consisted of a rapid and then a slow component. 3. Diazepam concentrations from 5.0 x 10(-5)M to 5.1 x 10(-4)M caused a dose-dependent block of both components to a 30% of their control values and also reduced the stimulatory responses to noradrenaline in this preparation. 4. Diazepam antagonized the potassium blocking effect of barium. 5. These results, based on electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence, are consistent with a calcium and sodium blocking effect of diazepam on the nerve skin junction of C. caudiverbera.", 
    "59": "1. The present study was designed to examine the effects of intracerebroventricular injection of several cholinergic drugs on the impairment of spontaneous alternation performance induced by the M1-selective muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine. 2. Pirenzepine (3 and 10 micrograms) significantly reduced spontaneous alteration performance related to working memory without producing any marked increase in total arm entries, which are considered to reflect locomotor activity. 3. Physostigmine (3.47 micrograms), a cholinesterase inhibitor, and McN-A-343 (20 micrograms), and M1-selective muscarinic receptor agonist, significantly improved the pirenzepine (3 micrograms)-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation performance, although oxotremorine (0.68 microgram), a nonselective muscarinic receptor agonist, showed a tendency to reverse the pirenzepine (3 micrograms)-induced impairment. 4. These findings suggest that the blockade of muscarinic M1 but not M2 receptors results in the impairment of spontaneous alternation performance associated with working memory.",

Benzodiazepines are safer than earlier sedative drugs used for this purpose, such as barbiturates, chloral hydrate and paraldehyde.

Long-term outcome is commented on.", 
    "61": "Recent advances in the understanding of the neurobiological basis of alcohol dependence have led to the development of pharmacological agents for the treatment of drinking problems. However, alcoholism is a complex disease with psychological and social dimensions in addition to medical problems. This implies that, in this domain, pharmacotherapy must be integrated in a general strategy of treatment and directed to specific aspects of management of the disease, such as treatment or prevention of the withdrawal syndrome or prevention of relapse after detoxification. Whereas the treatment of the withdrawal syndrome with pharmacological agents such as the benzodiazepines is now an established practice, the use of drugs for other dimensions of the disease is more controversial. However, the pharmacological approach aimed towards prevention of relapse appears promising, by means of classical medications such as disulfiram or new drugs (e.g. opiate antagonists and acamprosate). The clinical evaluation of such medications requires guidelines that will permit extrapolation of the results of the trials to situations that are commonly faced by practitioners.", 
    "62": "The possibility that a patient during general anaesthesia is aware of the operation going on and aware of severe pain that might be remembered postoperatively must be very alarming to patients and anaesthetists alike. Furthermore, there is experimental evidence showing that conscious recall of intraoperative events is only the tip of an iceberg; it seems very probable that there is even a higher incidence of unconscious perception during general anaesthesia. Therefore, the following stages of intraoperative awareness must be distinguished: (1) conscious awareness with explicit recall and with severe pain; (2) conscious awareness with explicit recall but no complaints of pains; (3) conscious awareness without explicit recall and possible implicit recall; (4) subconscious awareness without explicit recall and possible implicit recall; (5) no awareness. The incidence of conscious awareness with explicit recall and severe pain has been estimated at less frequent than 1/3000 general anaesthetics. Conscious awareness with explicit recall but no complaints of pain has been reported in the literature with an incidence of 05-2%. With 7-72%, conscious awareness without explicit recall and possible implicit recall shows a very wide range of variation and its occurrence probably depends on the anaesthetic drugs used. Subconscious awareness with possible implicit recall has an incidence of up to 80%, but there are many methodological problems in demonstrating implicit memory of intraoperative events. Reports of intraoperative awareness do not come exclusively from cardiac surgery and obstetrics, but also from all other operative specialties. Postoperatively, patients who experience intraoperative awareness may develop a so-called post-traumatic stress syndrome. Symptoms involve re-experiencing the event awake or in dreams, sleep disturbances, depression, avoidance of stimuli associated with the event. The probability of the development of the post-traumatic stress syndrome seems to coincide with the experience of severe pain. When a patient complains of intraoperative awareness postoperatively the anaesthesiologist should discuss the event frankly with the patient. When the symptoms of the post-traumatic stress syndrome persist a psychotherapy should follow. Causes for intraoperative awareness may be: equipment failure, too-light anaesthesia, e.g. for a caesarean section or for emergency surgery in severely injured or polytraumatized patients, during cardiac surgery, bronchoscopy of difficult intubation. There is interindividual variability in anaesthetic effect; for example, chronic drug or alcohol abuse or overweight may make increased anaesthetic doses necessary. They are at risk for intraoperative awareness. Some general anaesthetics or anaesthetic procedures, e.g. the combination of a relaxant and N2O, opioid mono-anaesthetics, or opioids combined with benzodiazepines, seem to involve a higher risk of intraoperative awareness than do volatile anaesthetics. The bases of litigation are medical malpractice, breach of contract by the anaesthesiologist or lack of informed consent from the patient. Therefore, patients who are at risk of intraoperative awareness should be given detailed information on this special risk before the operation.", 
    "63": "A patient hospitalized because of somatic disturbances without any sign of detectable cerebral organicity and because of secondary anxiety disorder and major depression presents different clinical pictures with a neurological aspect. All this pictures, that evoke the diagnostic of hysteria conversion in particular, are complicated by a tetraplegia with emission of red urine that enable us to think of a diagnostic of hepatic-porphyria (variegata). Hereditary metabolic diseases, which categories of bioclinic symptoms (that enable us to evoke the diagnostic and to prevent the complications that are breeded by the prescription of forbidden drugs for ill subject) are reminded.", 
    "64": "First defined as a residual diagnostic category in the third edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) was until recently one of the least studied and least clearly conceptualized of the anxiety disorders. The clinical definition of GAD has however improved up to the fourth edition of the DSM where the disorder is now characterized as a chronic state of apprehensive expectation and uncontrollable worry concerning multiple daily life events or activities and accompanied with at least 3 symptoms belonging to a list of six common manifestations of psychic or motor tension. Clinical research demonstrating the stability and the specificity of somatic symptoms clearly support the validity of the diagnosis of GAD despite possible difficulties in the differential diagnosis with other chronic conditions or axis II disorders such as dysthymia or mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. After benzodiazepines (BZD) and 5-HT1A agonists like buspirone, several other types of new anxiolytic drugs have been developed for the treatment of GAD. Partial agonists at GABA-BZD receptor sites may offer the advantage of a better efficacy vs side-effects ratio over classical BZDs; however, systematic comparative clinical trials will have to demonstrate the clinical relevance of the encouraging results obtained with these drugs, at the experimental level, during studies in healthy volunteers and during the first placebo-controlled trials. Furthermore, the recent description of GABA-receptor's subunits clearly suggest that the development of drugs acting at this level and devoided of psychomotor or withdrawal side-effects is a target that is worth pursuing. On the other hand, the development of 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 antagonists is also of interest for the treatment of GAD since it could provide new anxiolytic drugs without these side-effects and thus easier to administer on a long-term basis corresponding to the chronicity of GAD. However, it will also be important to know if wether or not the efficacy of these new drugs, like that of buspirone, is associated with some effects on depressive symptomatology, develops only progressively over time and is different in previous BZD users compared to GAD patients who did not receive BZD before the new drug. Among these drugs in development for GAD, the most likely to reach the market in a near future are a BZD partial agonist (abecarnil), 5-HT1A agonists like ipsapirone and 5-HT3 antagonists like ondansetron. However, another area of new developments concerning the drug treatment of GAD is the use of antidepressants, which have demonstrated efficacy in this indication even in patients without depressive features or panic attacks symptoms. Considering the chronic nature of GAD, these drugs, like those acting on the 5-HT-system, would be more adapted than BZD for the long-term management of this condition. If confirmed by clinical trials involving antidepressants other than tricyclics, the efficacy of these drugs in GAD may suggest that common neurobiological mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of both anxiety and depressive disorders. Despite the potential interest of these new treatments of GAD, recent years have shown that the development of new anxiolytic drugs often appears limited by high-rates of placebo response in numerous clinical trials. This phenomenon may be related--in part--to the increasingly sophisticated designs used in such trials, such as extensive diagnostic workups, repeated evaluations and inclusion criteria selecting the less severe types of anxiety. As emphasized by other authors, much more research needs to be done to establish what effects various ways of conducting a trial have on the trial's results in order to facilitate the emergence of new psychopharmacological approaches in the treatment of GAD.", 
    "65": "Prolongation of the QT interval may produce potentially hazardous dysrhythmias. The effects on the QT interval of midazolam followed by administration of either vecuronium or atracurium have been investigated. Thirty patients, ASA I or II, without cardiovascular problems, electrolyte abnormalities or receiving any medication were studied. All patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.08 mg kg-1 i.m. 30-60 min before surgery. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.4 mg kg-1. ECG recordings as well as heart rate and arterial pressure measurements were obtained before induction of anaesthesia and 1, 3 and 5 min after midazolam administration. Further recordings were obtained at 1, 3 and 5 min after either vecuronium 0.1 mg kg-1 (15 patients) or atracurium 0.5 mg kg-1 (15 patients). Further recordings were obtained immediately after tracheal intubation and at 1, 3 and 5 min later. Midazolam followed by administration of either vecuronium or atracurium did not produce any significant change in QTc interval (QT interval corrected for heart rate). Statistically significant prolongation of QTc was observed in both groups after intubation, although the mean QTc values did not exceed the upper limits of normal. Heart rate and arterial pressure were also increased significantly in both groups after intubation.",

    "67": "A prospective neurological and electroencephalographic (EEG) study was performed in sixteen leukemia patients receiving busulfan (BU) and cyclophosphamide before autologous bone marrow transplantation. All patients were given anticonvulsant prophylaxis with a combination of phenobarbital (PB) and clonazepam (CLZ). Neurological examination and EEG were performed prior to and soon after completion of BU treatment and were repeated two months later. No tonic-clonic and/or myoclonic convulsions were observed. In two patients, comparison of EEG recorded before and upon completion of BU administration revealed modification of features. EEG re-evaluated two months after BU showed normalization in one of the two patients. BU may trigger both generalized and myoclonic seizures together with EEG abnormalities; PB combined with CLZ may be useful prophylactic treatment.", 
    "68": "A case of childhood-onset somnambulism is reported in which a 43-year-old man presented with repeated sleep-related injuries incurred during violent nocturnal activity, which included frenzied running, throwing punches and wielding knives. He had also driven an automobile a long distance during a presumed somnambulistic state. His wife had been repeatedly injured, and she felt that her life was threatened by his nocturnal violence 2-3 times yearly. Polysomnography (PSG) documented multiple episodes of complex and violent behaviors arising exclusively from stage 3/4 sleep, thus confirming the diagnosis of somnambulism. Other causes of sleep-related violence were excluded. The patient responded promptly to treatment with bedtime clonazepam, and benefit was maintained at 5-year follow-up. Although this strictly clinical case did not have any legal repercussions, it does carry forensic implications, particularly when placed in the context of the published medical literature on PSG-documented parasomnias (somnambulism, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) containing explicit examples of recurrent violence, at times life-threatening, directed toward the bed partner and others. Thus, a new medical-legal concept is proposed, consisting of \"parasomnia with continuing danger\" as a noninsane automatism. Treatment guidelines, within the context of forensic medicine, are presented.", 
    "69": "Forty-one subjects between 12 and 63 years of age with a complaint of nocturnal wandering were reviewed retrospectively, and a prospective investigation of their compliance to treatment was performed. Twenty-nine of 41 subjects committed violence against themselves or others (\"violent group\"). Clinical investigation of their problem involved polysomnography, wake and sleep EEGs and ambulatory EEG recording in the home environment. The nocturnal wandering may have started from NREM sleep or REM sleep, and violence was observed in both of these sleep states. Arousal from sleep may have been triggered by sleep-disordered breathing or may have been related to temporal lobe abnormalities, and, in some cases, no abnormal polygraphic features were noted. Violence was always preceded by many instances of nocturnal wandering that had received little clinical attention. Temporal lobe abnormalities, a rare cause of nocturnal wandering, were present only in the \"violent\" group. This group also had a higher percentage of men than the \"nonviolent\" group. In both groups, the frequency of nocturnal wandering increased with an increase in daytime stressors. Pharmacological and psychiatric treatment approaches were beneficial in both groups.", 
    "70": "Injection of quinolinic acid in the rat striatum mimics neurochemical changes observed in Huntington's disease. We previously demonstrated that intrastriatal transplantation of fetal striatum or gelfoam protects against toxicity induced by a subsequent intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid performed one week later. Herein, we examined whether fetal striatum or sham transplantation provides protection against quinolinic acid that lasts up to four weeks. Intrastriatal quinolinic acid injection produces neuronal loss and gliosis in Nissl staining, loss of cytochrome oxidase histochemical staining, decrease in autoradiographic binding of [3H]SCH 23390-labeled dopamine D1 and [3H]CGS 21680-labeled adenosine A2 receptors, and increase in autoradiographic binding of [3H]PK 11195-labeled peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. None of these changes was observed in rats transplanted with fetal striatum one, two or four weeks before quinolinic acid injection. In animals transplanted with fetal striatal tissue, Nissl staining showed healthy grafts located in normal appearing striata. Although sham transplantation performed one week before quinolinic acid injection also protected against histological, histochemical and binding changes, sham transplantation performed two or four weeks before quinolinic acid injection was less effective in attenuating quinolinic acid-induced striatal toxicity. Thus, sham transplantation provides transient protection against quinolinic acid-induced striatal toxicity, whereas implantation of tissue such as fetal striatum seems to be required for long-lasting protection. Our study suggests that intracerebral transplantation may also act through other mechanisms than restoration of deficient neurotransmitters or damaged pathways, a finding which may have significant clinical implications in assessing the potential benefit of this approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease.", 
    "71": "In a continued effort to probe the role of the aromatic rings in classical 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) ligand pharmacology, a series of new thiophene-containing benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) ligands were synthesized. As a first step in determining the binding profile and selectivity to BDZR functional subtypes, the affinities in two central nervous system (CNS) regions, cerebellum, in which a single 'Type I' BDZR could be labeled; and spinal cord, in which we have previously demonstrated some receptor heterogeneity, were determined. These compounds were also assessed for their compliance with a recently developed three dimensional pharmacophore for recognition and activation of the 'Type I' BDZR, using the techniques of computational chemistry. The computations showed all ligands synthesized fulfilled the minimum requirements for recognition, further validating the current pharmacophore. Using the criteria for activation, the new ligands were all predicted to be agonists at the cerebellar 'Type I' BDZR. Since the compounds showed reasonable affinity, the behavioral profile of one of them at five in vivo endpoints was determined. This compound demonstrated more behavioral selectivity than the typical 1,4-BDZ ligand. While they fulfilled the requirements for agonist activity at the 'Type I' BDZR, these ligands showed significantly greater delocalization in the electron density distribution in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), so that either aromatic ring could serve as an electron accepting site, not just the one comparable to the more classical BDZR agonist, flunitrazepam. It is possible that the ability of the second ring in the tested compound (5a) to also function as an electron acceptor can affect the recognition and activation of other receptor types leading to the more discriminate behavioral profile of this thiophene analog compared to flunitrazepam.", 
    "72": "The importance of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated sensitization of central nervous system (CNS) neurons is well established in animal models of acute and chronic pain. A human model of central sensitization would be useful in screening new NMDA antagonists and establishing dose regimens for clinical trials in patients with pain related to sensitization of CNS neurons. We used this model to examine the effects of intravenous infusions of two centrally acting analgesics, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine and the morphine-like opioid agonist alfentanil. Twelve normal subjects completed a 3-session, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. From 25 to 60 min after capsaicin injection, subjects were given intravenous infusions of ketamine (mean dose: 32 mg), alfentanil (mean dose: 3075 micrograms), or saline placebo. Both drugs significantly reduced ongoing pain and pinprick-evoked hyperalgesia during the infusion. The reduction in allodynia evoked by light stroking was statistically significant only for alfentanil. Mean reduction +/- SEM relative to placebo were for ongoing pain: ketamine, 36 +/- 9%; alfentanil, 51 +/- 5%; area of pinprick hyperalgesia: ketamine, 34 +/- 7%; alfentanil, 35 +/- 7%; and area of mechanical allodynia: ketamine, 52 +/- 20%; alfentanil, 70 +/- 12%. Because the drugs were given systemically and produced side effects in all subjects, we cannot specify the site or sites of action nor conclusively rule out a non-specific 'active placebo' response as the cause for reduction of symptoms. Arguing against an 'active placebo' response, however, was the lack of analgesic effect of intravenous midazolam (mean dose; 3.4 mg, titrated to produce side effects of similar magnitude to ketamine and alfentanil) given at 145 min after capsaicin in 9 subjects who had received saline from 25 to 60 min. The results of this study suggest that neural systems sensitive to NMDA receptor antagonists and opioids participate in capsaicin-evoked pain phenomena, and support the feasibility of pharmacological studies using the intradermal capsaicin model.", 
    "73": "We followed the prescription of psychotropic drugs by primary health care physicians over a 3-year period. The material consisted of 1000 randomly selected adult primary health care patients. At least one psychotropic drug was prescribed to one third (n = 307) of the sample during the follow-up period. The most commonly used drug category was that of benzodiazepines, which was prescribed to 24% of the sample. An antidepressive was prescribed to 8%, a neuroleptic to 2% and \"other psychotropic drugs\" to 10% of the sample. The most important predictor for prescribing psychotropic drugs was recognition of mental problems at the initial survey, but age and marital status also had an association with the prescription. No gender difference was found after controlling for mental problems. Psychotropic medication was also prescribed to 13% of the patients who had no sign of mental disorder.", 
    "74": "Diazepam-binding inhibitor isolated from synaptic membranes exerts a pronounced inhibitory effect on the specific benzodiazepine-receptor binding of 3H-flunitrazepam and simultaneously leads to an increase of synaptosomal uptake of 14C-GAMA. At the same time the inhibitor also depresses the specific binding of 14C-NAD by synaptic membranes, but displaying a greater effect. In both cases the inhibition was competent.

    "75": "Saccadic eye movements have been previously used to assess residual effect of anaesthetics, but this test is seldom compared to other psychomotor tests. The aim of the present study was to validate saccades as a recovery index in relation to frequently referred subjective and psychometric tests. Eight healthy subjects were tested before and after intra-muscular injection of either placebo or 0.15 mg.kg-1 of midazolam. Each session consisted of a saccadic test (recorded by electro-oculography), a choice-reaction-time test (CRT), a subjective state-of-alertness test (11 visual analogic scales) and blood sampling (to monitor midazolam plasma concentration), before and 30 (t30), 60 (t60), 120 (t120), 180 (t180), 240 (t240) minutes after drug administration. In the placebo group, there was no change in subjective assessment, saccade characteristics (latency, peak velocity and duration) or CRT results. In the midazolam group, 6 subjective items changed with different time-courses, when compared to baseline: from t30 to t120 (drowsy, in shape, tired, clumsy, strong) and t120 (woolly). Saccade latency and duration were significantly different from t30 to t120 and until t180 for peak velocity. CRT performance was significantly altered from t30 to t120. Midazolam plasma concentration decreased from 177 +/- 33 ng.ml-1 at t30 to 47 +/- 12 ng.ml-1 at t240. At this latter time, sensorimotor functions returned to the baseline. All subjects fulfilled the clinical conditions for home discharge 4 hours after administration. These results suggest that a saccadic eye movement test is a sensitive and reliable tool for the assessment of residual effect of anaesthetics. This test was found to be more sensitive than CRT test since peak saccadic velocity was the last psychometric parameter to be returned to baseline after midazolam injection. This study also confirms the poor reliability of subjective assessment, as subjects tended to underestimate the alteration of their performance immediately following drug injection.", 
    "76": "Previous research showed: a) emotional distress is a risk factor for mortality after myocardial infarction (MI) and b) emotional distress is linked to stable personality traits. In this study, we examined the role of these personality traits in mortality after MI. Subjects were 105 men, 45 to 60 years of age, who survived a recent MI. Baseline assessment included biomedical and psychosocial risk factors, as well as each patient's personality type. After 2 to 5 (mean, 3.8) years of follow-up, 15 patients (14%) had died. Rate of death for patients with a distressed personality type (11/28 = 39%) was significantly greater than that for patients with other personality types (4/77 = 5%) (p < .0001). Patients with this personality type tend simultaneously to experience distress and inhibit expression of emotions. Low exercise tolerance, previous MI (p < .005), anterior MI, smoking, and age (p < .05) were also associated with mortality. A logistic regression model including these biomedical factors had a sensitivity for mortality of only 27%. The addition of distressed personality type in this model more than doubled its sensitivity. Of note, among patients with poor physical health, those with a distressed personality type had a five-fold mortality risk (p < .005). Consistent with the findings of other investigators, depression (p < .005), life stress, use of benzodiazepines (p < .01), and somatization (p < .05) were also related to post-MI mortality. These psychosocial risk factors were more prevalent in the distressed personality type than in the other personality types (p < .001-.05). Multiple logistic regression indicated that these psychosocial factors did not add to the predictive value of the distressed personality type. Hence, an important personality effect was observed despite the low power. This suggests that personality traits may play a role in the detrimental effect of emotional distress in MI patients.", 
    "77": "Occasionally, terminal ill patients with severe agitated delirium are extremely difficult to sedate, either becoming too deeply sedated when undisturbed or severely agitated when disturbed. This situation occurs even with the short-acting benzodiazepines such as midazolam. This paper describes the use of a low-dose infusion of the anesthetic agent propofol (Diprivan, Zenica), which has a very short length of action and allows the depth of sedation to be easily controlled from minute to minute.", 
    "78": "In advanced cancer patients close to death, delirium, multifocal myoclonus, and restlessness may occur. Multi-organ failure and related metabolic changes are mostly responsible for these symptoms. A pharmacologic approach to manage the delirium is necessary in the majority of cases. Benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and barbiturates are the most common drugs used. In the case reported, propofol administered at very low doses provided good control of neuropsychiatric symptoms. After a loading dose of 20 mg, an infusion of 50-70 mg per hr was started. The patient died peacefully after 8 hr of propofol infusion, without requiring opioids. Propofol seems to be a promising drug in treating the terminal agitated state that can be associated with the dying process.",

In both in vitro systems, the mechanism of inhibition was competitive with Km/KI ratios larger than 1 for the 3HDZ pathway and smaller than 1 for the NDZ pathway. There was an omeprazole concentration dependent decrease in diazepam clearance in vivo which could be modelled using a simple inhibition equation with a KI of 57 microM (19.8mg/L). In contrast there was no statistically significant change in the steady state volume of distribution for diazepam in the presence of omeprazole.",

The purpose of this monitored prescription process is to limit their use, which seemed undue. After the first six month of implementation, drug use decreased significantly(-50%) and has since stabilized. This reduction is particularly pronounced for benzodiazepines and especially anxiolytic drugs. The decree of August 9, 1991 has enabled us to optimize the delivery of these drugs and thus improve prescription for more rational indications.", 
    "88": "1. Combined hippocampal-parahippocampal slices were employed to study the development of complex epileptiform discharges after Schaeffer collateral stimulation in vitro. With repeated stimulation, slices generated several different types of epileptiform discharges, which were temporally linked to the preceding stimulus, and predictable in their progression. The first epileptiform discharge to be elicited by stimulation was a primary afterdischarge, which began immediately after the stimulation train and progressed with repeated stimulation until it had peaked in amplitude and duration by the third to fifth stimulus train. After development of the primary afterdischarge, a secondary afterdischarge began to appear, with a 2- to 5-min latency after the third to sixth stimulation train, and progressed in amplitude and duration with repeated stimulation, sometimes to durations > 30 min. 2. After development of the secondary afterdischarge, 65-70% of rostral slices triggered long-duration, spontaneous self-sustained activity. This activity consisted of repeated spontaneous 3- to 5-min duration ictallike discharges with a short interval (< 15 min between events), lasting for hours in many cases. These discharges were similar to activity seen in depth recordings of patients with complex partial status epilepticus. This cyclic spontaneous epileptiform activity was blocked by diazepam (100 nM to 1 microM), and potentiated by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV, 50 microM). Analysis of the temporal progression of epileptiform activity through multiple channel extracellular recordings demonstrated that both the interictal and ictal discharges evident during spontaneous recurrent ictal-like status epilepticus (SE) originated at a site distant from the stimulation locus, and then propagated to area CA1. 3. Intracellular recordings from CA3 neurons during spontaneous recurrent ictallike SE activity revealed the cellular correlates of this activity. Recurrent ictallike discharges were initiated at a cellular level by a large depolarization, accompanied by tonic action-potential firing. As the ictal event progressed, the neuron continued to depolarize, and a period of depolarization block ensued, which was terminated by the gradual repolarization of the neuron, with accompanying phasic burst firing. 4. A second variety of long-duration self-sustained activity was also seen in 5-10% of slices. This type of continuous sustained activity was initiated by an increase in duration of the secondary afterdischarge to 30-120 min duration with repeated stimulation. These sustained discharges were also increased in amplitude and frequency by APV (50 microM) and reduced or blocked by the benzodiazepines diazepam or clonazepam (1 microM). Sustained epileptiform discharges seen in vitro were similar to one form of seizure discharges seen in patients with SE in their frequency, duration, in their progression through a similar electrographic series of stages, and their sensitivity to benzodiazepines. 5. Intracellular recordings from CA3 neurons during continuous SE-like discharges revealed large bursts within this area during generation of generalized epileptiform activity. These bursts were coincident with extracellularly recorded population burst activity in CA1, and so were a circuit phenomenon. 6. This physiological and pharmacological correspondence between the multiple types of SE-like activity seen in vitro and in patients with SE suggests that these long-duration limbic discharges seen in slices may constitute a valuable model for study of the seizure discharges of SE. Future studies exploiting the advantages of in vitro preparations may aid in understanding physiological and pharmacological factors important in generation and control of this grave neurological condition.",

    "90": "The prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics is hypoactive and displays changes related to inhibitory, GABAergic neurons, and GABAergic synapses. These changes include decreased levels of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the enzyme for GABA synthesis, upregulation of muscimol binding, and downregulation of benzodiazepine binding to GABAA receptors. Studies in the visual cortex of nonhuman primates have demonstrated that gene expression for GAD and for several GABAA receptor subunit polypeptides is under control of neuronal activity, raising the possibility that similar mechanisms in the hypoactive prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics may explain the abnormalities in GAD and in GABAA receptor regulation. In the present study, which is the first of its type on human cerebral cortex, levels of mRNAs for six GABAA receptor subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2) and their laminar expression patterns were analyzed in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics and matched controls, using in situ hybridization histochemistry and densitometry. Three types of laminar expression pattern were observed: mRNAs for the alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunits, which are the predominant receptor subunits expressed in the mature cortex, were expressed at comparatively high levels by cells of all six cortical layers, but most intensely by cells in lower layer III and layer IV. mRNAs for the alpha 2, alpha 5, and beta 1 subunits were expressed at lower levels; alpha 2 and beta 1 were expressed predominantly by cells in layers II, III, and IV; alpha 5 was expressed predominantly in layers IV, V, and VI. There were no significant changes in overall mRNA levels for any of the receptor subunits in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics, and the laminar expression pattern of all six receptor subunit mRNAs did not differ between schizophrenics and controls. Because gene expression for GABAA receptor subunits is not consistently altered in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics, the previously reported upregulation of muscimol binding sites and downregulation of benzodiazepine binding sites in the prefrontal and adjacent cingulate cortex of schizophrenics are possibly due to posttranscriptional modifications of mRNAs and their translated polypeptides.", 
    "91": "This is a prospective randomized double-blind trial conducted to determine whether preoperative orally administered clonidine causes or potentiates postoperative vomiting in 140 children (3-12 yr) undergoing strabismus surgery. They were all inpatients and classified randomly into four groups (n = 35 each); placebo (control), diazepam 0.4 mg.kg-1, clonidine 2 micrograms.kg-1, and clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1. These agents were administered 93-112 min (mean; 100 min) before the anticipated time of induction of anaesthesia. All children received inhalational anaesthesia with halothane and nitrous oxide in oxygen. Muscle relaxation in all patients was obtained with vecuronium and residual neuromuscular blockade was antagonized with neostigmine and atropine before tracheal extubation. Diclofenac suppository was prescribed to prevent postoperative pain. No opioids or postoperative antiemetics were administered. All children remained in hospital for two days postoperatively. The incidence and frequency of vomiting were compared in the groups with Kruskall-Wallis Rank test. Clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1 caused a lower incidence and frequency of vomiting than did placebo and diazepam (incidence and frequency: 11% and 1.37% and 3, and 34% and 2 in clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1, placebo, and diazepam, respectively; P < 0.05 for clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1 vs placebo and diazepam). However, low-dose clonidine was ineffective. These data suggest that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1 may be useful for preventing emesis following strabismus surgery. This property of clonidine indicates that it may be superior to other sedative premedicants such as diazepam and midazolam.", 
    "92": "Alterations in autonomic activity caused by anaesthesia can be assessed by spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). This study examined the effects of ketamine and midazolam on HRV. Thirty patients of ASA PS 1 were studied. Fifteen were given ketamine (2 mg.kg-1) and 15 received midazolam (0.3 mg.kg-1), iv. The RR intervals of ECG were measured before and after induction of anaesthesia for ten minutes during spontaneous respiration. Power spectral density of the data was computed using fast Fourier transform. The spectral peaks within each measurement were calculated: low frequency area (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz), high frequency area (HF, 0.15-0.5 Hz), and total power (TP, 0.04-0.5 Hz). Normalized unit power was derived as follows: low frequency area (nuLF): LF/TP x 100%, high frequency area (nuHF): HF/TP x 100%. Both ketamine and midazolam caused reductions in all measurements of HRV power (P < 0.05). However, ketamine increased nuLF from 64 +/- 14% to 75 +/- 13% (P < 0.05) and decreased nuHF from 36 +/- 14% to 25 +/- 13% (P < 0.05), while midazolam decreased nuLF from 66 +/- 15% to 54 +/- 14% (P < 0.05) and increased nuHF from 34 +/- 15% to 46 +/- 14% (P < 0.05). These results documented that both ketamine and midazolam reduced the total power and all frequency components of power in spite of their opposing effects on autonomic nervous activity. However, normalized unit power showed the expected sympathetic activation with ketamine and sympathetic depression with midazolam since ketamine increased nuLF and midazolam decreased nuLF.", 
    "93": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is known to stimulate cell proliferation but involvement of CCKB type receptors has not been exactly demonstrated so far. We examined the effect of CCK-8S and two receptor agonists on rat glioma C6 cells when using different CCKB receptor agonists and antagonists. Both CCK-8S and CCKB receptor agonists BC 264 and Suc-Trp-N(Me)Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2 stimulate [3H]thymidine incorporation. These effects were inhibited by CCKB receptor antagonist L-365,260 over 100-fold more effectively than it was seen by using CCKA receptor antagonist L-364,718. The data indicate that CCKB receptor agonists are potent stimulants of rat glioma C6 cell DNA synthesis suggesting that CCKB receptor activation is involved in cell proliferation within the central nervous system.", 
    "94": "Five forms of the drug alprazolam have been identified by thermal analysis and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). The single crystal X-ray structures of two of these species, a polymorph 1 and a dihydrate 2, were determined. The dihydrate crystallized from a solution of alprazolam in methanol containing traces of water. Species 3 and 4 are nonstoichiometric solvates with ethanol and acetonitrile, respectively. The differential scanning calorimetric curves for the solvates 2-4 are similar, showing a desolvation endotherm, followed by an exotherm associated with recrystallization, and a final endotherm for the fusion of alprazolam. The solvates 3 and 4 were shown to be isomorphous by XRD. The products of desolvation of 2-4 were identified by their XRD traces. Solvates 2 and 3 yield polymorph 1 on desolvation, whereas solvate 4 yields a different polymorph.", 
    "95": "The approach to drug treatment of vertigo is almost exclusively symptomatic. There are 3 major goals for drug treatment of vertigo. The first one is to eliminate the hallucination of motion. Drugs with vestibular 'suppressant' properties are used for this purpose. The major vestibular suppressants are anticholinergic and antihistamine drugs. The second goal is to reduce the accompanying neurovegetative and psychoaffective signs (nausea, vomiting, anxiety). Antidopaminergics are used for this purpose. The third goal is to enhance the process of 'vestibular compensation' to allow the brain to find a new sensory equilibrium in spite of the vestibular lesion. Until now, the pharmacological manipulation of vestibular compensation has been assessed in animals but not in humans with vestibular lesions. Vestibular suppressant drugs delay rather than enhance compensation. A variety of other drugs is also used in the treatment of vertigo, including benzodiazepines, histaminergic agents, sympathomimetics and calcium antagonists. Their mechanism of action is poorly understood. The data base derived from clinical trials evaluating antivertigo medications is often questionable because of methodological limitations. This explains why habits of prescription are mainly empirical, and why striking differences can be noticed from one country to another. We can hope that new treatments may emerge from the present interest in receptor subclasses and neuromodulators of the vestibular system, and we must be ready to evaluate these potential new pharmacological agents with reliable clinical methods in humans.",

EMLA cream was applied in group 1 while placebo was applied in group 2 (control group). All were premedicated with oral midazolam. Either EMLA or placebo was applied at least 30 minutes before transfer to the operating theater and the area was covered with a transparent dressing. Parameters recorded upon arrival in the operating room and upon hand puncture with a 22-G needle were systolic and diastolic arterial pressures (SAP and DAP) and heart rate (HR). Pain was assessed on a behavior scale, a visual analog scale evaluated by the anesthesiologist (VAS-anesthesiologist) and a VAS evaluated by a nurse (VAS-nurse). Adverse events were also recorded. A Student t-test and a Mann-Whitney U-test were used for statistical analysis; the level of significance was p < 0.05.",

    "100": "A carboxyl-terminus truncated mutant of the guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein-coupled TRH receptor (TRH-R) was previously shown to exhibit constitutive, i.e. TRH-independent, activity (C335Stop TRH-R). Chlordiazepoxide (CDE), a known competitive inhibitor of TRH binding to wild-type (WT) TRH-Rs, is shown to compete for binding to C335Stop TRH-Rs also. More importantly, CDE is shown to be a negative antagonist of C335Stop TRH-Rs. CDE rapidly caused the basal rate of inositol phosphate second messenger (IP) formation to decrease in AtT-20 pituitary cells stably expressing C335Stop TRH-Rs (AtT-C335Stop cells), but not in cells expressing WT TRH-Rs (AtT-WT cells). Similar observations were made in HeLa cells transiently expressing C335Stop or WT TRH-Rs. CDE inhibition of IP formation was shown to be specific for TRH-Rs using GH4C1 cells expressing both TRH-Rs and receptors for bombesin. In these cells, CDE inhibited TRH-stimulated IP formation, but had no effect on bombesin-stimulated IP formation. The effects of chronic administration of CDE were studied. Preincubation of AtT-C335Stop cells, but not AtT-WT cells, with CDE for several hours caused an increase in cell surface receptor number (up-regulation) that led to increased TRH stimulation of inositol phosphate formation and elevation of intracellular free Ca2+. Preincubation with CDE did not affect methyl-TRH binding affinity or TRH potency in cells expressing AtT-C335Stop or in AtT-WT cells. We conclude that CDE is a negative antagonist of C335Stop TRH-Rs and that constitutively active C335Stop TRH-Rs are down-regulated in AtT-20 pituitary cells in the absence of agonist.", 
    "101": "The purpose of this study was to explore gender differences of medication use in a random sample of community-dwelling elderly subjects (N = 791). The average number of different medications in women (N = 578) was higher than in men (N = 213) (4.0 vs. 3.5, age corrected ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.3). However, despite this relatively small difference in number of medications there was a major gender difference in the pattern of medications used. Compared to men, women had a higher use of benzodiazepines (risk ratio 1.7, 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.3), diuretics (1.5, 1.1-2.0), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents (1.7, 1.2-2.3), and anti-depressants (2.5, 1.1-5.5), but a lower use of pulmonary (0.5, 0.3-0.9) and gout medications (0.2, 0.1-0.6). These gender differences in medication use can be explained by the fact that compared to men, women have a higher prevalence of non-lethal chronic conditions such as degenerative joint disease and hypertension. However, additional factors such as gender-specific differences in patient or physician behavior are likely to contribute to the observed differences in medication use as well. Overall, 36% of all women and 21% of all men were using benzodiazepines, with 42% of these subjects using long-acting compounds. Furthermore, 24% of all women and 15% of all men reported use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents for which safer medication and non-medication alternatives would be available in many cases. Thus, women had a higher risk of inappropriate medication use than men. On the other hand, the finding that antidepressant use was 3% in men and 7% in women indicates that compared to women, men might be at increased risk for undertreatment of depression. Further causal evaluation of gender differences in both medication use and patient-physician interaction might contribute to detection and reduction of inappropriate drug use in older persons.", 
    "102": "1. The effects of subacute and of chronic diazepam treatment upon binding to the GABAA receptor have been examined by use of receptor autoradiography for determining flunitrazepam (FNZP) binding, GABA enhancement of FNZP binding. SR 95531 2-(3'-carboxy-2',propyl)-3-amino-6-p-methoxyphenylpyridazinium bromide) binding and GABA binding in parallel sections from rat brain. Prior to the autoradiographic procedures, a behavioural assessment of the rats was made in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. 2. Rats receiving diazepam either subacutely (3 days) or chronically (28 days) by both continuous release, from previously implanted subcutaneous silastic capsules, or by daily injection (5 mg kg-1) did not display changes in FNZP or GABA binding in any of the 47 brain structures analysed. Similarly, there were no significant effects of treatment upon mean total entries or on the open:total ratio for entries in the elevated plus-maze. 3. There were reductions in the GABA enhancement of FNZP binding in the nucleus accumbens and central grey after subacute diazepam treatment. This effect persisted in the nucleus accumbens after chronic treatment. Less marked effects occurred in the lateral habenula, dorsal raphe and substantia nigra pars compacta. In the dorsal tegmental nucleus, GABA enhancement of FNZP binding was enhanced after chronic treatment and this was accompanied by reductions in SR 95531 binding. Treatment did not otherwise affect SR 95531 binding, with the exception of the dorsal raphe where binding was decreased after subacute treatment. 4. In general, the patterns of binding produced by the two different treatment routes were very similar. However, SR 95531 binding was lower in certain hippocampal fields in the i.p. treated animals compared to the rats implanted with silastic capsules. 5. It is concluded that repeated administration of diazepam evokes changes in benzodiazepine and GABA receptor coupling, and to a lesser extent changes in low affinity GABA binding, in certain interrelated brain structures of which an accumbens-habenula circuit is a central feature. These changes occur soon after the initiation of diazepam treatment, suggesting that they are unlikely to account for tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of diazepam but may trigger and/or accompany other critical neurochemical events.", 
    "103": "1. The demonstration that systemic administration of the CCKA receptor antagonist, devazepide, increases food intake in rats has provided the strongest support for the hypothesis that endogenous peripherally released cholecystokinin (CCK) acts as a satiety factor. However, interpretation of these results has been confounded by the fact that devazepide can enter the brain from the systemic circulation and may increase food intake by a central action. The present study was therefore undertaken to confirm the hypothesis that endogenous peripheral CCK is a satiety factor by investigating the effects of a novel CCKA receptor antagonist, 2-NAP, which is unlikely to cross the blood brain barrier, on food intake in rats. 2. 2-NAP (1-16 mg kg-1, i.p.) had no significant effects on the intake of a test meal in rats. 3. Pretreatment of rats with 2-NAP (2 mg kg-1, s.c.) abolished the inhibitory effects of exogenous peripheral CCK (5 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) on food intake. 4. In agreement with previous results, devazepide (50-200 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) significantly increased the intake of a test meal in rats. 5. The observations that 2-NAP, which is unlikely to penetrate the blood brain barrier, had no effect on food intake, but that 2-NAP abolished the suppressant effect of exogenous peripheral CCK, suggest that endogenously released peripheral CCK is not important as a satiety factor in rats."
