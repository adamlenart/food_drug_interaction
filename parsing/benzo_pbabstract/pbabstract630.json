    "0": "A high performance liquid chromatographic method for quantitative determination of neothramycin in plasma was developed. The procedure involves pretreatments for the removal of endogenous materials in plasma samples and separation on a reversed phase column. The antibiotic was monitored with a fluorescence detector and confirmed by a specific sulfite adduct shift of retention time. A linear response for serum samples containing neothramycin ranging from 50 to 500 ng/ml was obtained. The sensitivity of this method was sufficient to measure neothramycin in human plasma for 120 minutes after a 24 mg/m2 (body surface area) intravenous injection.", 
    "1": "Rats placed into the rotating cylindrical tretbahn (diameter 50 cm, 2.3 r. p. m.) for 24, 48 and 96 hrs developed the sleep deprivation resulting in elevation of SH-group level for over 20% in mesencephalon and diencephalon. The normalizing occurred within 48 hrs. The high level of brain SH-groups in 24-hr sleep-deprived rats changed insignificantly after 12 hrs of resting. The intraperitoneal administration of phenazepam (1 mg/kg) or barbamyl (70 mg/kg) had no effect whereas their combination normalized the SH-groups level within 12 hrs of rest.", 
    "2": "Hypothermia was produced by IM administration of diazepam (0.125-0.5 mg/kg) to squirrel monkeys of various ages (2-16 years) in a thermoneutral (23 +/- 0.5 degrees C) environment with animals over eight years of age having slightly greater responses. Hypothermia caused by an intermediate dose (0.25 mg/kg) was augmented in a cold environment (15 degrees C), especially in the older animals. There was no marked alteration in the temperature change/age regression after 0.25 mg/kg diazepam in a hot environment (30 degrees C) compared with the control response. Injections of diazepam (1.25-5.0 microgram) into the lateral cerebral ventricle in a thermoneutral environment produced hyperthermia rather than hypothermia in all animals, and the magnitude of the induced hyperthermia was smaller in older monkeys. The results support previous case reports in man and suggest that this commonly used drug can induce hypothermia, especially in older primates exposed to cold. The drug action responsible for this temperature change appears to take place peripherally rather than within the brain.", 
    "3": "Benzodiazepines are known to potentiate GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) action in the brain. The effects of midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, on GABA disposal (14CO2 from [1-14C]GABA) and on the individual processes of GABA uptake, GABA release, and GABA-transaminase in the rat brain synaptosomal model system were studied. A 10 per cent inhibition of action was defined as ID10. Midazolam inhibited overall GABA disposal at ID10 = 13 micro M. The ID10 values for the three contributing process in the overall GABA disposal process are 580 micro M for GABA-transaminase activity, 96 micro M for GABA release, and 13 micro M for GABA uptake. The value for GABA release is probably not valid since it fell outside of the linear part of the regression line which was used for calculation. Therefore, GABA uptake inhibition appears to be responsible for the overall inhibition of GABA disposal. This value is consistent with the proposed hypothesis that anesthesia involves excess GABA in the synaptic area.", 
    "4": "Schedule-controlled lever pressing and schedule-induced licking were studied in rats under a multiple fixed-interval fixed-interval schedule of food reinforcement upon which was superimposed a multiple variable-time variable-time schedule of electric-shock delivery. Shocks were signaled in one component of the multiple schedule and unsignaled in the other. The effects of diazepam upon the suppression of behavior during the signal (conditioned suppression) and during signaled and unsignaled shock (differential suppression) were studied under several shock intensities (Experiment 1) and at increased body weight (Experiment 2). In each study, diazepam led to dose-dependent increases in the rate of pressing and licking during signaled and unsignaled shock, but had little effect on conditioned suppression. the rate-enhancing effects of diazepam depended upon the intensity of shock, nature of the response, and whether or not shocks were signaled. The data was discussed in terms of (1) implications for understanding the effects of signaled and unsignaled shock on behavior, (2) the effects of diazepam on behavior suppressed by response-independent shock, and (3) comparison between operant and schedule-induced behavior.", 
    "5": "We describe a rapid, sensitive procedure for detecting benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants in serum. After the compounds are adsorbed on charcoal and eluted with an organic solvent mixture, the drugs are thin-layer chromatographed and detected by their fluorescence. Because it is so fast and easy (turn-around time of about 1 h), the method can be used for emergency toxicology screening. An analysis requires 1.0 mL of serum, and the limit of detection for each of the drugs is about 0.75 mg/L. The procedure is sensitive enough to allow the use of serum instead of urine for the detection of these drugs, because serum has certain advantages over urine as the sample and better reflects the state of the patient's toxicity.", 
    "6": "A previously reported patient with analbuminemia was re-investigated after 4 1/2 years, at age 6. The serum albumin concentration was 150 mg/L by radioimmunoassay. Most of the observed increase in total plasma protein over the 4 1/2 years was attributable to gamma-globulin. Concentrations of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were increased; the esterified:free ratio and the lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity were both normal. Albumin is apparently not essential for binding of lysolecithin generated by the acyltransferase-catalyzed reaction. The binding of bromphenol blue suggested that analbuminemic serum has about 25% of normal binding capacity for bilirubin (more than expected in a patient with analbuminemia), which may explain why newborns with this disorder do not develop kernicterus. Binding by the patient's plasma of diazepam (1020 mg/L) and warfarin (1040 mg/L), which bind primarily to albumin, as well as of propranolol (1.05 g/L), which binds primarily to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, was also studied. The proportions of free diazepam (14.4%) and warfarin (4.8%) were about 10-fold normal. In contrast, the proportion of propranolol in the free form was decreased (4.5%). Evidently, other plasma proteins are partly compensating for the deficiency of albumin.", 
    "7": "This is an electrophysiological study in cats and rats of the imidazobenzodiazepinone derivative, Ro 15-1788, the first representative of specific benzodiazepine antagonists. (1) In unanaesthetized spinal cats, 1-10 mg kg-1 Ro 15-1788 i.v. did not affect segmental dorsal root potentials (DRPs), polysynaptic ventral root reflexes (VRRs), Renshaw cell responses to antidromic ventral root volleys and spontaneous gamma-motoneurone activity. However, at 1 mg kg-1 i.v., it antagonized the enhancement of DRPs as well as the depression of polysynaptic VRRs, Renshaw cell discharges and gamma-motoneurone activity induced by meclonazepam (0.1 mg kg-1 i.v.), diazepam (0.3 mg kg-1 i.v.) or zopiclone (1 mg kg-1 i.v.). The same dose of Ro 15-1788 failed to reduce similar effects of phenobarbital (10 mg kg-1 i.v.) on spinal cord activities. (2)In unanaesthetized \"enc\u00e9phale isole\" rats, 3 mg kg-1 Ro 15-1788 i.v. abolished the decrease induced by 5 mg kg-1 midazolam i.v. of spontaneous multiunit activity (MUA) in the substantia nigra pars compacta, nucleus raph\u00e9 dorsalis, nucleus locus coeruleus and the CAl area of the hippocampus dorsalis, but not the decrease produced by 10mg kg-1 pentobarbital i.v. Ro 15-1788 (12mg kg-1 i.v.) by itself did not affect MUA in the substantia nigra, but slightly depressed MUA in the other 3 areas. (3) In intact immobilized rats, the increase of power induced by 1 mg kg-1 flunitrazepam i.v. in the 0.5-48 Hz range of the electrocorticogram as well as in the 0.5-8 Hz, 8-32 Hz and 32-48 Hz frequency bands was transiently abolished by 5 mg kg-1 Ro 15-1788 i.v. (4) In unrestrained cats, 5 mg kg-1 Ro 15-1788 i.p. had no effect on the electrical threshold for eliciting a rage reaction evoked by electric hypothalamic stimulation, but abolished the threshold increase caused by 1 mg kg-1 diazepam i.p. These results are in line with biochemical and behavioural findings and support the selective antagonism by Ro 15-1788 of central effects of benzodiazepines through an interaction at benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "8": "Six hundred postmortem and emergency room urine analysis for benzodiazepines were performed by both the \"EMIT-dau Benzodiazepine Metabolite Assay\" (EMIT) and thin layer chromatography (TLC). Benzodiazepine drugs or metabolites were detected in 90 urines by TLC and 84 urines by EMIT. Of th six apparent false negative EMIT analysis, three were due to high edogeneous lysozyme activity and three were due to the greater sensitivity of TLC (0.1 mg/L) versus EMIT (0.5 mg/L). The EMIT assay sensitivity for four benzodiazepine drugs and five of their major uninary metabolites was determined. Benzodiazepines unsubstituted at the N-1 position displayed the greatest sensitivity by EMIT assay, 0.5 mg/L. Twenty-six \"nonbenzodiazepine\" drugs or drug metabolites commonly encountered in urine drug screening, failed to produce significant false positive or false negative results with the EMIT benzodiazepine assay.", 
    "9": "Harmine, a hallucinogen with potent monoamine oxidase inhibitory properties, induced abnormal behavior, including tremor, scratching, head twitch and cage biting, in the mouse. A dose-dependent tremor was produced by all routes of administration of harmine. Although oxotremorine tremor was markedly suppressed by atropine, harmine tremor was unaffected by cholinergic drugs, remarkably inhibited by dopaminergic drugs, antidepressants and diazepam, mildly diminished by p-chlorophenylalanine, markedly augmented by 5-hydroxytryptophan and mildly increased by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine. These findings suggest that a catecholaminergic (particularly dopaminergic) and serotonergic system imbalance plays an important role in the manifestation of harmine tremor. In view of these characteristics, harmine tremor may be useful as an effective experimental model for the evaluation of antiparkinsonism drugs, along with oxotremorine tremor because of the different mechanism of occurrence. In addition, harmine tremor appears to be useful in characterizing the properties of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "10": "In 8 outpatients with duodenal ulcer the effect of a single dose of 50 mg pirenzepine is compared to a 3-7 days treatment with 2x50 mg. Basal and peptone-stimulated acid output is measured. A single dose of 50 mg pirenzepine reduced basal acid output by 39,9% and the stimulated acid secretion by 21,3%. Treatment for 3-7 days with 2x50 mg pirenzepine is significantly more effective. Basal acid output is reduced by 75,1% and stimulated acid output by 54,0%. No acid inhibition can be demonstrated 12 hours after the last drug administration. Basal serum gastrin levels are little but significantly increased after chronic treatment.", 
    "11": "Primary cultures of dissociated hippocampi from fetal mice examined for the presence of binding sites for [3H]diazepam. The binding assays were done with living cells still attached to the culture dish. The cells contain high affinity binding sites for [3H]diazepam, Kd = 5 nM, which are completely inhibited with 20 nM R05-4864 but only 26% with 20 nM lorazepam. The binding was inhibited by purinergic compounds and by quinidine. The living cell did not exhibit increased binding of [3H]diazepam in the presence of GABA and in fact a slight decrease in binding was found. This was also found when live, intact C6 glial cells were investigated. These observations suggest that the use of living cells to study the benzodiazepine receptor is valuable and maybe necessary to fully characterize this receptor.", 
    "12": "1 Interactions of depressant and anticonvulsant drugs with the neuronal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor + effector system have been examined on afferent fibres to the rat cuneate nucleus in vitro. Three types of interaction have been measured: (a) potentiation of depolarizing responses to the GABA analogue, muscimol: (b) reduction in the potency of bicuculline as an antagonist of muscimol at the GABA receptor: (c) reduction in the potency of picrotoxin as an antagonist of muscimol acting on the effector mechanism. 2 Phenobarbitone reduced the potency of picrotoxin in doses which did not affect the potency of bicuculline and which caused only a small potentiation of muscimol. Pentobarbitone did not show such selectivity, a reduction in potency of picrotoxin always being accompanied by a reduction in potency of bicuculline and a substantial potentiation of muscimol. 3 Flurazepam and lorazepam both reduced the potency of picrotoxin without affecting that of bicuculline and with very little potentiation of muscimol. Phenytoin had no effect on the potency of picrotoxin whilst potentiating muscimol to the same extent as phenobarbitone. 4 The spectrum of drug activity in reducing the potency of picrotoxin correlates well with the reported anticonvulsant effects of these drugs against kindled amygdaloid seizures. Potentiation of muscimol and reduction of bicuculline potency appear more closely related to hypnotic properties.", 
    "13": "In a double-blind study we compared fluvoxamine, a new selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, with clomipramine. In 36 female inpatients with vital depression, the antidepressant properties of fluvoxamine and clomipramine were studied. Eight patients did not complete the study. During a 4-week treatment period the Hamilton-, Zung-, Clinical Global Impression- and Leyden ratings showed, apart from the last scale in the fluvoxamine group, significant improvement in both groups. In the latter scale, a statistically significant difference was found in favour of clomipramine. Additional anxiolytic-sedative medication was required equally in both groups. CSF data in 10 patients are discussed. Non-specific electrocardiographic (ECG) repolarization disturbances were observed in both groups. Anticholinergic side effects were more prominent with clomipramine than with fluvoxamine; gastrointestinal symptoms and agitation were more prominent with fluvoxamine than with clomipramine. Fluvoxamine did not show particular advantages or disadvantages over clomipramine.", 
    "14": "The effects of the short-acting benzodiazepine, triazolam, on EEG activity during sleep were assessed in poor sleepers. Twenty male subjects, mean age 21 +/- 2.37 years, participated. A screening night preceded 3 placebo nights, 6 treatment nights, and 2 placebo-withdrawal nights. During treatment, 10 subjects received triazolam (0.5 mg) and 10 received placebo. The treatment condition was double-blind. In addition to rate/min spindle count and number of delta half-waves/min, the auditory evoked response (AEP) was obtained on the last placebo baseline and the fifth drug night. Subjects receiving triazolam showed a significant increase in sleep spindles and a significant decrease in delta count during drug administration. Both values returned to baseline on the first withdrawal night. The AEP peak-to-trough amplitude was also significantly reduced during sleep by triazolam, but, as the time since drug ingestion increased, the amplitude of the AEP also increased. There was no difference in AEP amplitude between the two groups 5 h post-drug ingestion.", 
    "15": "The results of the tricyclic antidepressants imipramine, desipramine and doxepin and the anti-anxiety agent diazepam were tested for their effects on the frequency distribution of spontaneous brain electrical activity (EEG) in the cat. Multivariate statistical techniques were employed to make an objective and quantitative assessment of the results of broad-band frequency analysis in terms of certain dose-related and drug-specific variables. In spite of several clinical and pharmacological differences in their properties, the antidepressants produced remarkably similar profiles of frequency change which were unrelated to those produced by diazepam.", 
    "16": "Temazepam is a 1,4-benzodiazepine, newly marketed in the United States for the symptomatic treatment of the complaint of insomnia. The manufacturer recommends a dose of 30 mg before bedtime for most adults and 15 mg for geriatric or debilitated patients. A dose of 30 mg usually produces peak plasma concentrations within 3 hours after oral ingestion and has a mean half-life of 10 to 15 hours. Thus, temazepam is absorbed more slowly and metabolized more quickly than flurazepam, the only other benzodiazepine marketed in the United States specifically for insomnia. Eight sleep laboratory and 21 clinical studies on temazepam indicate that temazepam reduces awakening during the night and increases sleep duration. However, there was no consistent evidence that temazepam reduces sleep latency--probably because temazepam, taken at bedtime, does not reach sufficiently high blood levels in time to affect sleep onset. One sleep laboratory study on 8 insomniac patients given 35 consecutive nightly doses of 30 mg found no evidence of tolerance or rebound insomnia. Studies on tolerance, metabolism and carry-over effects have shown that temazepam has no long-acting metabolites and does not affect waking function following use at bedtime. In patients for whom hypnotic medication is appropriate, temazepam should be an effective drug for reducing most symptoms of insomnia.", 
    "17": "Effects of psychotropic drugs on emotional reactivity and behavior under acute stress were studied in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-HDA)-destroyed catecholaminergic brain terminals. The differences in emotional and behavioral reactivity were found in the group of animals who received 6-HDA. An abrupt reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in corpus striatum of \"emotional\" rats correlates with noticeable difficulties in the behavior of escape out of stress and essential differences in the effects of psychotropic drugs whose action is mediated via the catecholamine neurotransmitter system.", 
    "18": "The pharmacokinetic disposition of lorazepam was investigated in sham-operated aneshetized dogs, dogs with hepatic devascularization, and dogs with total splanchnic devascularization following i.v. administration of 0.3 mg per kg of the drug. In sham-operated dogs, lorazepam distribution was extensive (100 +/- 15.2 liters) and clearance approximately expected liver blood flow (971 +/- 91 ml per min). Lorazepam glucuronide levels in plasma rose rapidly in the first hour and reached a plateau by 5 hr. Urinary recovery of the conjugate in 5 hr was 45% of administered dose. Hepatic devascularization resulted in 39% reduction in distribution volume, and 89% reduction in clearance; however, there was still 105 +/- 88 ml per min of extrahepatic lorazepam clearance. Five-hour urinary recovery of conjugate decreased by 80%. Total splanchnic devascularization resulted in 37% further reduction in extrahepatic clearance, almost complete inhibition of urinary recovery of conjugate, and further reduction in the volume of distribution. It is concluded that the liver is the major site for lorazepam metabolism in dogs; however, appreciable extrahepatic metabolism occurs, partly in nonhepatic components of the splanchnic organs which act as a reservoir during drug distribution.", 
    "19": "Methodology for the quantitative determination of clorazepate dipotassium and monopotassium in solid dosage forms was developed. Clorazepate was resolved from its degradation products, making the analysis specific and stability indicating. Analytical separation was performed on a octadecylsilylated silica column. Clorazepate was extracted from the dosage forms with 0.04% NaOH and chromatographed with aqueous 0.005 M tetra-n-butylammonium ion (pH 7.5)- acetonitrile (70:30) as the eluent. The analysis was completed in approximately 20 min with a precision of less than 2.4% RSD.", 
    "20": "In a double-blind, placebo controlled and randomised secretory study the effectiveness of pirenzepine, ranitidine, and their combination was compared intraindividually in eight healthy subjects receiving intravenous bolus injections. Pirenzepine (0.15 mg/kg) plus ranitidine (0.6 mg/kg) suppressed peptone-stimulated gastric acid secretion from 69 +/- 11 to 2 +/- 0.4 mmol H+/3 h; the mean percentage inhibition was 97%. Postprandial gastrin was unaffected. There were only minor side-effects in a few experiments (reduction of salivation, brief blurring of vision), but no prolactin stimulation after ranitidine or ranitidine plus pirenzepine. The combined application of ranitidine and pirenzepine inhibited meal-stimulated acid secretion more effectively and produced fewer side-effects than the combination of cimetidine plus pirenzepine studied previously.", 
    "21": "A double-blind, random design, parallel group, four-week study of prazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, and placebo was conducted in diverse private outpatient practices (surgeon, internist, and obstetrician-gynecologist) using a common protocol, in order to evaluate their comparative efficacy in these settings. In addition, the effects of these anxiolytics on depressive symptoms in patients with anxiety were studied. Results showed that the non-psychiatric practitioners used lower dosages than psychiatrists in previous reports, and perception of anxiety levels of their patients were lower than the psychiatric raters. When patients were divided into two groups (1. predominantly depressed with anxiety, and 2. predominantly anxious with depression), differences between the benzodiazepines were shown. In the high depression-low anxiety group, all four treatment methods were effective in alleviating both anxiety and depression. In the high anxiety-low depression group, only prazepam and placebo were effective in alleviating both anxiety and depression, while diazepam and lorazepam decreased anxiety levels, but not depression.", 
    "22": "The anxiolytic effects of clobazam, diazepam, and placebo were compared in a 4-wk double-blind study of 159 anxious outpatients, primarily from family practice. Clobazam (30 to 80 mg/day) and diazepam (15 to 40 mg/day) were found to induce similar side effect, primarily sedation, and although both active drugs induced greater clinical improvement than placebo, clobazam induced the largest degree of improvement in most aspects. It was speculated that the relatively high daily dosage of diazepam may have been contributed to these results.", 
    "23": "Benzodiazepines bind to living cultures of dissociated rat cerebral cortex. This binding is saturable, and kinetic analyses indicate that the binding is to a single class on sites with kinetic constants very close to those obtained using neuronal membrane preparations. The efficacy of a number of benzodiazepines, xanthine derivatives and other drugs in competition experiments is similar to that seen in neuronal membrane preparations, and suggests that the benzodiazepine binding site studied in these investigations is the same as that found in neuronal membrane preparations and believed to be the pharmacologically active benzodiazepine binding site. GABA agonists increase the binding of benzodiazepines, and this increase has the same order of efficacy as their ability to hyperpolarize the neurons when applied at known concentrations with muscimol greater than GABA greater than THIP. At high concentrations THIP potentials benzodiazepine binding to the same level as GABA. Diazepam increases the ability of both GABA and THIP to hyperpolarize the neurons as well as the amplitude of spontaneous IPSPS which, in this system, are GABA-mediated. The competitive GABA antagonist bicuculline methiodide slightly decreased benzodiazepine binding and also antagonized the increase due to GABA. The non-competitive GABA antagonist picrotoxinin had no effect on benzodiazepine binding but did antagonize the GABA-induced increase in benzodiazepine binding. Replacement of Cl- in the incubation medium by acetate, which does not permeate the GABA-mediated Cl-- ionophore, increases benzodiazepine binding, and GABA no longer increases the binding. Picrotoxinin decreases the increase in benzodiazepine binding is Cl--free media, and this decrease is blocked by GABA. These results are discussed in terms of interactions at the GABA receptor complex consisting of a GABA recognition site, a benzodiazepine recognition site, a picrotoxinin recognition site, and a Cl- ionophore.", 
    "24": "The pharmacokinetics of benzodiazepines have gained increasing importance since clinical findings indicate differences in profiles of clinical action and abuse potential between members of this class of compounds which cannot be explained by differences in molecular structure but correlate closely with specific features of invasion and elimination kinetics. This correlation is discussed on data from the literature and demonstrated by means of computer simulated plasma level curves.", 
    "25": "Pregnant rats were intubated with alcohol (ethanol, 3 grams per kilogram) twice daily throughout gestation. Control animals received solutions of isocaloric sucrose. At birth, offspring were placed with untreated surrogate dams. Beginning at 6 months of age, the offspring were tested for their thermogenic responsiveness to various drugs and to cold. Prenatal exposure to alcohol resulted in tolerance to alcohol and cross-tolerance to pentobarbital and diazepam but did not affect responsiveness to cold. This pattern of effects suggest that prenatal exposure to alcohol produces specific long-term effects on the neural mechanisms underlying drug tolerance.", 
    "26": "A review of the literature indicates that neither experimental nor epidemiological studies can give a clear indication as to whether orally administered diazepam adversely affects the ability of a patient to drive a car. It is preferable for anxious, aggressive, or depressed patients not to drive. Since diazepam tends to relieve these symptoms, this particular medication should not lead to an automatic prohibition of car driving. Patients should always be urged to use great care while at the wheel of a motor car.", 
    "27": "beta-Carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) was tested on two models of epilepsy in the baboon: kainic acid-induced limbic status epilepticus and photosensitive epilepsy. Beta-CCE, at very low doses ranging from 8 to 100 microgram/kg (i.v.), induced a reactivation of the limbic focus and photomyoclonic and generalized seizures in photosensitive and non-photosensitive baboons. The proconvulsant effect of beta-CCE may be associated with its binding to a particular subclass of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "28": "[3H]Flunitrazepam binding was studied in synaptosomal membranes from rat brain following 4 weeks of chronic treatment with 100-150 mg/kg/day flurazepam. At 12 h after the end of treatment, the brain was removed and dissected into 8 areas: cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, corpus striatum, hypothalamus, midbrain-thalamus, medulla-pons, and olfactory bulbs. Membranes from each area were extensively 'washed', and saturation binding studies performed. Chronic flurazepam treatment caused a reduction in the apparent number of binding sites (Bmax) that was confined to the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and medulla-pons, with a possible smaller loss in the olfactory bulbs. The binding constant (KD) was unchanged in all areas studied.", 
    "29": "The biotransformation pathways following oral administration of prazepam are characterized. The time course of the active metabolite descyclopropylmethylprazepam (= norprazepam), representing 80-90% of all prazepam metabolites in plasma, can be described by an open one compartment model with a mean elimination half life of 70 h and a plasma clearance of 1.0-1.4 l/h. 3-5 h after single doses of 20 mg prazepam, the corresponding peak levels of norprazepam are 120-160 ng/ml. There is only a slight uptake of norprazepam into red blood cells and a relative low secretion into breast milk. Following repeated doses of daily 20 mg prazepam steady state levels of norprazepam are 600-800 ng/ml. The slow build-up of the active metabolite and the long elimination half life ensure continuous plasma levels with small fluctuations.", 
    "30": "Unlike the anesthetic barbiturate pentobarbital and the anxiolytic pyrazolopyridine etazolate, which enhance [3H]diazepam binding to rat brain membranes, the anticonvulsant barbiturates phenobarbital and metharbital, and also chlormethiazole, at therapeutic concentrations (10-1000 muM), do not stimulate [3H]diazepam binding, but instead block the enhancement by both pentobarbital and etazolate. The same anticonvulsants at similar concentrations inhibit [3H]alpha-dihydropicrotoxinin (DHP) binding suggesting that these anticonvulsants compete for the same receptor sites as pentobarbital and etazolate, designated the barbiturate-picrotoxinin receptor component of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex.", 
    "31": "By using kainic acid (KA) to perform chemical lesions in the guinea pig cerebellum, we have caused degeneration of Purkinje cells without affecting cell morphology. Near the injection site we found a large decrease in autoradiographically labeled histamine-H1 and benzodiazepine receptors of the molecular layer while those receptors distant from the injection site were unaffected. GABA receptors in the granule cell layer remained uniformly constant even immediately adjacent to the lesion site. This evidence suggests that histamine-H1 and benzodiazepine receptors are present on neuronal elements (possibly on Purkinje cell dendrites) in the molecular layer of the cerebellum and that GABA receptors area associated with the KA-resistant granule cells.", 
    "32": "With standard extracellular recording and microiontophoretic techniques, the effects of flurazepam on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) evoked depression of cerebellar and cerebral cortical neurons in rats have been studied. It was found that although flurazepam potentiated the GABA-mediated inhibition of most Purkinje cells (25 or 36), it caused only a weak potentiation of GABA action on some cerebral cortical neurons (14 of 37). The difference between the action of flurazepam in these two structures was statistically significant. The results confirm a previous report that the enhancement of GABA-evoked inhibition by benzodiazepines is more readily elicited on cerebellar cortical neurons than on cerebral cortical neurons.", 
    "33": "1. Aerobic incubation of the maleate salt of midazolam, 8-chloro-6-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine, with rat liver 9000 g supernatant fluid fortified with an NADPH-generating system yielded three metabolites. These were identified with an 1-hydroxymethyl derivative formed by oxidation of the methyl substituent on the imidazo moiety, the derivative hydroxylated at C-4 of the diazepine ring, and the corresponding dihydroxy derivative. 2. Pretreatment of rats with phenobarbital stimulated the oxidative metabolism in vitro of midazolam by 9000 g liver supernatant. 3. Rats given 2.5 mg/kg of [14C]midazolam maleate i.v. excreted 81% of the administered radioactivity in the faeces and 10% in the urine in 24 h. The highest levels of 14C were in the liver and the lowest in the brain during the first day. 4. Four phenolic derivatives of midazolam were identified in rat bile. These were the 4'-hydroxy and the 4'-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl derivatives of midazolam and two benzophenones. Evidence that the benzophenones were artifacts derived from the 4-hydroxy derivatives of the two biliary benzodiazepine metabolites is presented. These biliary metabolites were excreted as glucuronide and/or sulphate conjugates. 5. The Propensity of the rat to excrete phenolic metabolites of midazolam in bile is in agreement with the metabolism of several other benzodiazepines in this species.", 
    "34": "5,11-Dioxo-1,2,3,5,6,11,12,12a-octahydropyrrolo [2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine and the corresponding 2-hydroxyderivative were prepared by the intramolecular cyclization of 1-(2-aminophenylacetyl)pyrrolidin-2-carboxylic acid and 1-(2-aminophenylacetyl)-4-hydroxypyrrolidin-2-carboxylic acid; some of the tricyclic compounds were tested for neuropsychopharmacological effects.", 
    "35": "Plasma concentrations of midazolam (Ro 21-3981/001) were studied in six gynaecological patients following a 12.5 mg intravenous bolus injection of the drug for induction of anaesthesia. The plasma decay curves were found to be biphasic. Therefore the data were interpreted according to an open two compartment model. The fast distribution phase (alpha-phase) lasted about 30 to 45 min with a mean halflife of about 8-9 min. The half-life of the slow redistribution and elimination phase (beta-phase) amounted to a mean of about 150 min. The apparent volume of distribution of the cental compartment (V1) was calculated as 24.11 and the volume of distribution at steady state as 84.21 (Vd, ss). The volume of distribution in the beta-phase (Vd beta) ranged from 71.5 to 129.51 with a mean of 104.21. The total plasma clearance varied from 380 to 527 ml/min with a mean of 472 ml/min. It is suggested that the pharmacokinetic behavior is due to water-solubility and plasma protein binding of this new benzodiazepine.", 
    "36": "A four-liter pressure chamber was constructed for pharmacological experiments in rats; it consisted of the following: 1) a system for repeated, accurate injection; 2) an alternative single-dose injection system; 3) a system for direct blood sampling to the outside. The injection and sampling systems were tested for possible drug adsorption at 71 ATA. The accuracy of drug concentration measurements in samples collected through the sampling system at pressure was found to be satisfactory.", 
    "37": "The effects of diazepam on the development of explanted stage 4 chick embryos were investigated. Diazepam, at 10-120 micrograms/ml, preferentially inhibited closure of the neural tube. This effect was reversible. Concentrations of 150-200 micrograms/ml inhibited not only neural tube closure but also blastodermal expansion, somite formation, and heart development in 52% of the embryos. Concentrations above 200 micrograms/ml were highly embryotoxic. Electron microscopy of affected neuroepithelial cells revealed that 1) apical surfaces were much smoother than usual and 2) apical filament bundles, which are generally thought to provide motive forces for uplifting of neural folds, were not well organized and often lacked alternating dark and light areas along their length. These findings and the fact that changes in cell surface topography reflect the contractile activities of underlying filament bundles suggest that the observed \"smoothing\" effect on apical cell surfaces and neural tube closure defects are due, at least in part, to the impaired ability of these filament bundles to contract.", 
    "38": "Butorphanol tartrate (Stadol [Bristol]) and diazepam (Valium [Roche]) given intravenously in combination, in proper doses, and properly monitored are effective and safe to induce analgesia and calmness preliminary to extensive infiltration of local anesthetics that are otherwise painful and distressin. They are particularly good for moderately long and prolonged dermatoplastic procedures, and all the better because their analgesic and calmative effects last well into the postoperative period.", 
    "39": "Intravenous diazepam and ketamine may be used as sole agents, along with local anesthesia, or in combination with preoperative sedation in office plastic surgical procedures. These medications can lower or, in some instances, eliminate the requirements for local anesthesia. They enable procedures traditionally confined to hospital operating rooms (where general anesthesia must be used) to be done in office surgical facilities. True dissociation occurs, and this is not seen without the use of ketamine, which selectively and centrally blocks the effect of painful stimuli without obtunding vital functions. Use of these two agents together is mandatory, because of the use of ketamine alone can produce unwanted side effects. Together, diazepam and ketamine exhibit synergism, with the adverse effects of each being canceled by the other. This dissociative technique appears to approach the \"ideal\" in a properly staffed and equipped office surgical facility with appropriate patient selection. Tranquility can now be a reality for the patient, staff, and plastic surgeon.", 
    "40": "A patient with tetanus was treated with high-dose intravenous (IV) diazepam for control of muscular spasms. As the spasms were controlled with diazepam, lactic acidosis developed. The condition resolved on discontinuation of diazepam therapy and recurred with reinstitution of the drug. To our knowledge, lactic acidosis previously has not been associated with the use of high-dose IV diazepam.", 
    "41": "It has previously been shown in rats that diazepam alone has no effect on the cerebral metabolic rate (CMRO2) but that it interacts with nitrous oxide to produce a 40 per cent reduction in the CMRO2 value. In the present study, the effect of sedative doses of diazepam on the cerebral energy state, glycolysis, citric acid cycle, and amino acid metabolism in rats was determined in the presence and absence of a simultaneous administration of 70 per cent nitrous oxide, 45 s to 30 min after the diazepam injection. The metabolic response was very similar in the two groups despite the differences in metabolic rates of oxygen consumption. There were no changes in the cortical concentrations in ATP, ADP, AMP, phosphocreatine and creatine. The brain glycogen concentration was elevated during diazepam sedation, whereas brain glucose levels remained close to normal values except at 30 min after administration of diazepam alone, when the glucose level showed a 30 per cent increase. The onset of diazepam sedation was associated with an inhibition of glycolysis at the phosphofructokinase step in both groups. The reduced pyruvate concentration subsequently leads to a reduction in the pool size of the citric acid cycle intermediates. The concentrations of alanine and glutamate decreased during the period of diazepam sedation, while those of aspartate and glutamine increased. GABA and ammonia concentrations remained unchanged. Based on the cerebral metabolic response, the onset of diazepam sedation appears to be associated with an inhibition of rate of metabolism (glycolysis), both in the presence and absence of nitrous oxide. In that respect, diazepam has a metabolic profile similar to barbiturates.", 
    "42": "Mental and psychomotor effects and diazepam kinetics were studied in Caucasian and Orientals. 12 Caucasian and 13 Oriental young adults received on one of two occasions, separated by 2 weeks, either 0.2-mg/kg diazepam or saline intravenously. Serum diazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography in samples drawn up to 72 hr after injection. Serum protein binding was measured by equilibrium dialysis. Subjects were tested on a battery of psychological tests before and 0.5, 2, and 4 hr after treatment. While the free fraction of diazepam was identical in both races (0.02), volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) was different when calculated as absolute volume (Vdss = 76.55 +/- 9.63 l in Caucasians and 54.96 +/- 4.55 l in Orientals, p = 0.04) and marginally significant when corrected for body weight (Vdssl/kg = 1.10 +/- 0.11 in Caucasian and 0.88 +/- 0.05 in Orientals, p = 0.07). total body clearance (Cl), but not elimination half-life (t 1/2), was higher in Caucasians than Orientals, p less than 0.01; t 1/2 = 37.70 +2- 5.53 hr in Caucasians and 41.77 +/- 3.80 in Orientals). Desmethyldiazepam levels were higher in Orientals than Caucasians. Mental and psychomotor effects were maximal at the first session (0.5 hr), followed by complete recovery by the 4-hr session. Effects were similar in both groups. If repeated dosing causes a higher rate of cumulated diazepam serum levels in Orientals, as expected, there might be deeper brain depression in that group.", 
    "43": "The vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) in the macaque was tested by a modified B\u00e1r\u00e1ny spinning test before and after subcutaneous administration of 1 mg/kg of picrotoxin. The drug caused a decrease in the nystagmus time constant to a value near that of the cupula and a decrease in mystagmus asymmetry. Picrotoxin prevented diazepam from increasing the time constant of vestibular nystagmus. Furthermore, picrotoxin reduced the nystagmus time constant after vermisectomy, a lesion that increases the nystagmus time constant and prevents some VOR modifications. Because picrotoxin and diazepam interact antagonistically in the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter system, these results show a role of GABA in the neural network that transforms a short cupula time constant into a longer nystagmus time constant.", 
    "44": "The effects of sodium hydroxybutyrate (100 mg/kg); phenazepam (1 mg/kg), apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg and haloperidol (1 mg/kg) on the electrophysiological sleep pattern were studied in rats during 7-day alcohol withdrawal after its voluntary consumption for 13 months. It was shown that alcohol withdrawal led to profound disorders in the sleep-waking cycle. Sodium hydroxybutyrate prevented these disturbances and brought sleep to normal. Phenazepam exerted a powerful sedative and hypnotic effects but did not improve the balance of sleep phases. Apomorphine displayed a tendency to sleep normalization. However, this effect was short-term. Haloperidol did not eliminate abstinence manifestations in the sleep pattern.", 
    "45": "Sleep-inducing effects of hypnotic drugs are difficult to demonstrate in rats because of high baseline sleep times. Most increases in slow wave sleep (SWS) following the administration of hypnotics have been found to be at the expense of REM sleep rather than waking. In the first experiment we found that rats chronically implanted with electrodes for recording ECoG and EMG slept significantly less during the first two hours of the dark period when housed under 16-hr light 8-hr dark (16L/8D) than when housed under 12L/12D conditions. The second experiment examined the effects of flurazepam, phenobarbital and thalidomide administered orally at the onset of the two-hour period of increased waking resulting from the 16L/8D lighting. All three drugs caused dose-dependent reductions in waking and increases in SWS with no alterations in REM% of total sleep time. Sleep onset latency was also significantly was also significantly reduced by all three drugs. As in man, flurazepam was the most potent, and thalidomide was the least potent of the hypnotics in rats.", 
    "46": "To evaluate sympathetic nervous system activity during narcotic-hypnotic \"balanced anesthesia,\" plasma catecholamine concentrations and hemodynamic variables were assessed simultaneously in 10 men with coronary artery disease who received, sequentially, morphine sulfate, 3 mg/kg IV, and diazepam, 0.25 to 0.35 mg/kg IV, for myocardial revascularization surgery. Infusion or morphine sulfate rates of 5 to 10 mg/min significantly decreased both mean systemic arterial pressure (from 98 plus or minus 6 to 84 plus or minus 5 torr, p less than 0.01) and systemic vascular resistance index (from 38 plus or minus 3 to 30 plus or minus 5 units, p less than 0.05). These changes were associated with 2-fold increases in plasma norepinephrine levels (from 246 plus or minus 31 to 488 plus or minus 85 pg/ml, p less than 0.01) and 4-fold increases in plasma epinephrine levels (from 129 plus or minus 20 to 570 plus or minus 182 pg/ml, p less than 0.01). Addition of diazepam further decreased systemic arterial pressure (from 84 plus or minus 5 to 73 plus or minus 3 torr, p less than 0.01) and was associated with significant decreases in cardiac and stroke volume indices when compared with values obtained after morphine sulfate alone. Plasma concentrations of both norepinephrine and epinephrine also declined in association with these hemodynamic changes. Following skin incision, systemic arterial pressure and systemic vascular resistance index increased, the latter to the highest measured value (50 units). Norepinephrine concentrations increased significantly more than it had after morphine-diazepam anesthesia (321 plus or minus 63 pg/ml). It was concluded that the administration oif high dose morphine anesthesia acutely activates the sympathoadrenal system while producing peripheral vasodilation. Diazepam, when used following morphine to assure loss of consciousness, exacerbates the hypotensive effects produced by morphine and is associated with decreased levels of plasma catecholamines. Surgical incision produces significant peripheral sympathetic activation and increases vascular resistance during morphine-diazepam anesthesia.", 
    "47": "Median convulsant (CD50) and median lethal (LD50) doses of intraperitoneal lidocaine, bupivacaine, and etidocaine were determined in 149 mice. Another 496 mice were pretreated with intramuscular diazepam, lorazepam, or midazolam, 1 mg/kg. Fifteen minutes later, lidocaine, bupivacaine, or etidocaine was given intraperitoneally and the incidence of convulsions and deaths recorded. Benzodiazepines significantly reduced the incidence or convulsions. For instance, etidocaine, 54.9 mg/kg, produced 50% convulsions in untreated mice compared to 6.9%, 3.4%, and 3.4% after diazepam, lorazepam, or midazolam, respectively. Benzodiazepines also enhanced survival, as shown by significant increases in the LD50s. The bupivacaine LD50, for example, increased from 58.7 mg/kg in untreated mice to 75.2, 79.1, and 83.6 mg/kg after diazepam, lorazepam, or midazolam, respectively. Similarly, bupivacaine, 58.7 mg/kg, killed 50% of untreated mice, but only 1.2%, 9.7%, and 4.5% of mice treated with diazepam, lorazepam, or midazolam, respectively. It is concluded that premedication with a benzodiazepine significantly reduces the incidence of convulsions in mice and lowers the mortality rate as well. In equal intramuscular doses, midazolam proved to be the most effective anticonvulsant and diazepam the least. Etidocaine and bupivacaine convulsions were more difficult to suppress than those induced by lidocaine. On the other hand, the lethality of lidocaine was least reduced by these benzodiazepines."
