Early in vitro research of the anticonvulsant activity of the blossom extracts were done but there has been no investigation focused on the blossom essential oil and its anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activity of the essential oil of C. aurantium blossoms (neroli) was investigated. The anticonvulsant activity of neroli was assessed in pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsion by i.v. and i.p. methods and maximal electroshock (MES) in mice, with diazepam as the standard drug. While mechanistic studies were conducted using flumazenil, a GABA A-benzodiazepine receptor complex site antagonist. Neroli produced protection against clonic by i.v adminiatration of PTZ at 20 and 40 mg/kg, compared with protection with benzodiazepine. The mean onset and percentage protection against convulsion in neroli-treated mice were reduced by flumazenil. Intraperitonaeal PTZ also decreased the latency of clonic seizure in the neroli (40 mg/kg) treated group. We also showed that neroli (20 and 40 mg/kg), exhibited inhibition of the tonic convulsion induced by MES and decreased the mortality rate. Neroli was analyzed by GC and GC-MS and twenty three constituents, representing 91.0 % of the chromatographical oil were identified. The major components of neroli were characterized as linalool (28.5%), linalyl acetate (19.6%), nerolidol (9.1%) E,E-farnesol (9.1%), \u03b1-terpineol (4.9%) and limonene (4.6%) which might be responsible for the anticonvulsant activity. The results suggest that neroli possesses biologically active constituent(s) that have anticonvulsant activity which supports the ethnomedicinal claims of the use of the plant in the management of seizure.",

The sedative, hemodynamic, and adjuvant anaesthetic effects of both premedications were assessed.", 
    "8": "The levels of sedation (Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scales) and anxiety (visual analog score) at pre-induction, and the times to eye-opening and extubation, were not different between the groups. The heart rate response following tracheal intubation and extubation, and mean arterial pressure responses after extubation, were attenuated in the dexmedetomidine group compared to the midazolam group. No bradycardia or hypotension was noted in any patients. Propofol target concentrations at intubation and at start and completion of surgery were decreased in the dexmedetomidine group, whereas no difference in respective remifentanil levels was detected.",

One hundred thirty-four spine procedures were performed on patients that had a history of prior vasovagal reaction during a spine procedure. Of these, 90 procedures were performed without moderate sedation, and 21/90 (23.3% [95% CI 15.2-32.1%]) were complicated by a repeat vasovagal reaction.

    "23": "A total of 18,141 dementia patients were screened from the one million sample of the National Health Insurance Research Database. The dementia patients were then divided into TCM users and non-TCM users according to their medical records between 1997 and 2008. Demographic characteristics included gender, age, insured amount, and geographic location and medical conditions including comorbidity diseases, behavioral and psychological symptoms, and anti-dementia medication were also investigated. Their tendency of TCM usage was investigated using a multivariate logistic regression.", 
    "24": "In Taiwan, 43.3% dementia patients had sought TCM treatments. The inclination of TCM usage was inversely proportional to age; the younger and early-onset dementia (age less than 55 years) patients constituted the high usage group. Female, living in central Taiwan, and higher insured amount were also associated with higher tendency of TCM use. Multilevel Poisson regression analysis showed that the Adjust odds ratios (OR) of TCM use were 1.80 (95% CI=1.68-1.94), 2.52 (95% CI=2.30-2.76), and 3.41 (95% CI=3.01-3.86) for those with one, two, three or more behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), respectively compared with dementia sufferers without BPSD. In addition, polypharmacy led to higher utilization of TCM (one type: Adjust OR=1.41, 95% CI=1.28-1.56, two types: Adjust OR=1.97, 95% CI=1.63-2.00; three or more types: Adjust OR=2.95, 95% CI=2.27-2.78). More than 70% TCM visits were treated with Chinese herbal remedies, while others used acupuncture and manipulative therapies.

    "25": "More than 40% of the dementia patients in Taiwan used TCM. Young-onset dementia, higher number of BPSD, multiple chronic diseases, and polypharmacy were independent predictors for dementia patients seeking TCM medical advice. On the basis of the current findings, additional clinical or epidemiologic study on the prescription patterns of TCM in dementia treatment, or the herb-drug interaction and safety issue can be conducted.", 
    "26": "Few methods for noninvasive assessment of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in porcine models are available. The aim of this study was to evaluate methods for assessment of arterial stiffness and endothelial dysfunction in anesthetized G\u00f6ttingen minipigs. Pulse-wave velocity (PWV) was assessed in male G\u00f6ttingen minipigs (n = 8; age approximately 60 wk) by using applanation tonometry of the carotid and femoral arteries. In addition, flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) was assessed by using vascular ultrasonography of the brachial artery to evaluate endothelial dysfunction. To evaluate the reproducibility of the methods, minipigs were anesthetized by intravenous infusion of ketamine and midazolam and examined every other day for a total of 3 trials. Neither examination day nor systolic, diastolic, or mean arterial blood pressure statistically influenced PWV or FMD. The median interexamination coefficient of variation was 17% for PWV and 59% for FMD. Measured values of PWV corresponded largely to those in clinically healthy humans, but FMD values were lower than expected for lean, young animals. Although the ketamine-midazolam anesthesia we used has been associated with minor hemodynamic effects in vivo, in vitro studies suggest that both drugs are vasodilatory. Therefore anesthesia might have influenced the endothelial response, contributing to the modest FMD response and the concurrent high coefficients of variation that we noted. We conclude that PWV\u2014but not FMD\u2014showed acceptable interexamination variation for its potential application in porcine models.", 
    "27": "The provision of long-term opioid analgesic therapy for chronic pain requires a careful risk/benefit analysis followed by clinical safety measures to identify and reduce misuse, abuse, and addiction and their associated morbidity and mortality. Multiple data sources show that benzodiazepines, prescribed for comorbid insomnia, anxiety, and mood disorders, heighten the risk of respiratory depression and other adverse outcomes when combined with opioid therapy. Evidence is presented for hazards associated with coadministration of opioids and benzodiazepines and the need for caution when initiating opioid therapy for chronic pain. Clinical recommendations follow, as drawn from 2 previously published literature reviews, one of which proffers 8 principles for safer opioid prescribing; the other review presents risks associated with benzodiazepines, suggests alternatives for co-prescribing benzodiazepines and opioids, and outlines recommendations regarding co-prescribing if alternative therapies are ineffective.", 
    "28": "In an ongoing effort to identify novel drugs that can be used as neurotherapeutic compounds, we have focused on anilino enaminones as potential anticonvulsant agents. Enaminones are organic compounds containing a conjugated system of an amine, an alkene and a ketone. Here, we review the effects of a small library of anilino enaminones on neuronal activity. Our experimental approach employs an olfactory bulb brain slice preparation using whole-cell patch-clamp recording from mitral cells in the main olfactory bulb. The main olfactory bulb is a key integrative center in the olfactory pathway. Mitral cells are the principal output neurons of the main olfactory bulb, receiving olfactory receptor neuron input at their dendrites within glomeruli, and projecting glutamatergic axons through the lateral olfactory tract to the olfactory cortex. The compounds tested are known to be effective in attenuating pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) induced convulsions in rodent models. One compound in particular, KRS-5Me-4-OCF3, evokes potent inhibition of mitral cell activity. Experiments aimed at understanding the cellular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect revealed that KRS-5Me-4-OCF3 shifts the concentration-response curve for GABA to the left. KRS-5Me-4-OCF3 enhances GABA affinity and acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Application of a benzodiazepine site antagonist blocks the effect of KRS-5Me-4-OCF3 indicating that KRS-5Me-4-OCF3 binds at the classical benzodiazepine site to exert its pharmacological action. This anilino enaminone KRS-5Me-4-OCF3 emerges as a candidate for clinical use as an anticonvulsant agent in the battle against epileptic seizures.",

    "30": "Retrospective analysis was performed on 293 consecutive pediatric patients admitted with viral gastroenteritis to Osaka General Hospital between November 2007 and May 2009. Eighteen patients developed seizures, 12 of whom were positive for norovirus and six for rotavirus, as revealed by antigen detection. Of these 18 seizure patients, eight presented without fever (the aFS group) and 10 presented with febrile episodes (FS group).", 
    "31": "Seizure patients in the rotavirus group (83%) were more likely to be febrile than those in the norovirus group (58%). Compared with the aFS group, 90% of patients in the FS group presented seizures at an early stage of gastroenteritis. The frequency of clustered seizures in the FS group was considerably higher than that of febrile seizures in general and was also as high as that of \"convulsions with mild gastroenteritis (CwG)\". All seizure patients, whether febrile or afebrile, presented with generalized tonic clonic seizures (GTCS), complex partial seizures (CPS), or both. Diazepam (DZP) was less effective and carbamazepine (CBZ) was completely effective for the cessation of seizures in the FS group, similar to the drug response observed in CwG.", 
    "32": "The causative pathogen (norovirus or rotavirus) affected the frequency of febrile episodes during gastroenteritis, but fever had little effect on the clinical features of seizures. However, seizures occurred earlier during gastroenteritis in the FS group. On the whole, the clinical features of febrile seizures during viral gastroenteritis may closely resemble those of \"convulsions with mild gastroenteritis\" (CwG) than those of febrile seizures in general with respect to the frequency of clustered seizures and the antiepileptic drug responses and may have a pathogenic mechanism distinct from those of febrile seizures due to other causes.", 
    "33": "There is strong evidence for the use of the ketogenic diet (KD) in Dravet syndrome (DS). The purpose of this study was to evaluate both effectiveness and tolerability in comparison with various antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).", 
    "34": "32 children (19 males) with genetically confirmed DS treated at our center since 1999 were analyzed retrospectively. Data collected from patients' files included type of mutation, age at treatment initiation and treatment lag, overall seizure frequency and frequency of different seizure types, especially prolonged seizures and status epilepticus (SE). Efficacy and safety of the KD were evaluated. In addition, the effect on seizure count was compared with that of various AED regimen and the vagus nerve stimulation (VNS).", 
    "35": "Overall response to the KD was 70% at 3 months and 60% at 12 months. No SE occurred while patients were on the diet, and the frequencies of prolonged generalized and myoclonic seizures were reduced. No severe side effects requiring withdrawal of the KD were observed. Although the effect of the KD was independent of age at initiation, it had to be withdrawn due to noncompliance more frequently in solid fed older children compared with infants treated with the liquid ketogenic formula. The KD was not significantly inferior to the current gold standard AED triple combination of Stiripentol+Valproate+Clobazam (89%), Bromides (78%), Valproate alone (48%), Topiramate (35%) and VNS (37%) and significantly more effective than Levetiracetam (30%; p=0.037, Pearson's Chi-square).", 
    "36": "These data suggest that the KD ranks among currently used AEDs as an effective treatment for seizures in DS. According to our results (good effect on SE and prolonged seizures, good tolerability, less compliance problems due to formula treatment) the KD should be considered as an early treatment option in infants with DS.", 
    "37": "The poor prognosis of patients with glioblastoma fuels the search for more effective therapeutic compounds. We previously hypothesised that the neuroleptic olanzapine may enhance antineoplastic effects of temozolomide the standard chemotherapeutic agent used in this disease. This study tested this hypothesis. The anti-proliferative effect of olanzapine was examined by MTT assays and cell count analysis. Soft-agar assays were performed to examine colony-forming ability. In addition, the inhibitory effect of olanzapine on the migratory capacity of U87MG and A172 cells was analyzed by Transwell(\u00ae) assays. Moreover, staining for annexin V/propidium iodide or carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester was performed prior to flow cytometric analysis in order to better understand the subjacent cellular mechanism. Our initial hypothesis that olanzapine may enhance temozolomide's anti-tumor activity could be confirmed in U87MG and A172 glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover, treatment with olanzapine alone resulted in a marked anti-proliferative effect on U87MG, A172 and two glioma stem-like cells with IC50 values ranging from 25 to 79.9 \u00b5M. In U87MG cells, anchorage-independent growth was dose-dependently inhibited. In A172 cells, migration was also shown to be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, olanzapine was shown to exert a cell line-dependent pleomorphism with respect to the induction of apoptosis, necrosis and/or cytostasis. Our data show that the neuroleptic olanzapine enhances the anti-tumor activity of temozolomide against glioblastoma cell lines. Moreover, this is the first study to show that olanzapine provides on its own anti-cancer activity in glioblastoma and thus may have potential for repurposing.",

Patients concerned by these drug-related problems were 64 years old on average. Seven categories of medication-related problems represented more than 69% of PIs (1.1-Non Conformity of the drug choice compared to the formulary; 4.1 Supratherapeutic dose; 5.3 Therapeutic redundancy; 6.2 Drug interaction (all levels of severity); 7.0 Adverse drug reaction; 8.3 Inappropriate drug form; 8.5 Inappropriate timing of administration). The PIs related to 9.2 Patient's non compliance, 2.0 Untreated indication and 3.2 Length of the treatment too short were infrequent (less than 1%). The most common type of intervention was the dose adjustment. Almost 45% of these PIs involved Zopiclone or Zolpidem prescription in elderly patients. Seven hundred and nine drug interactions were identified by pharmacists. The most common type of drug interaction considered the risk of cardiac arrhythmias due to antipsychotic medications. One hundred and thirty-three PIs concerned adverse drug reaction. The most frequent adverse drug reactions were a fall (36 PIs), hemorrhage/bleeding (32 PIs), drowsiness (12 PIs) and extrapyramidal syndrome (12 PIs). Antidepressant drugs were the greatest pharmacological class concerning adverse drug reaction. The overall acceptance rate was 57%. Eight hundred and seventy-four PIs (19%) were refused and 1111 (24%) were non-assessable.",

However, few PIs concern compliance to therapy or polyprescription of antipsychotic drugs. These two categories of medication-related problems are known to be an issue in mental health therapy. The lack of guidelines describing mental health pathology (such as the HAS guideline) is an obstacle for performing evidence-based PIs. The lack of information describing the context of the prescription is a limitation of this study. In order to improve their practice, pharmacists have to focus more on the context in which patients are evolving, and to take into account its entire situation based on Anglo-Saxon approaches. A second way is to identify clinical settings where PIs are useful and to describe PIs needed. Doctors and pharmacists should get together and talk about these clinical situations and PIs, because some may be misunderstood or disapproved by prescribers. This collaboration could take the form of a thesaurus combining clinical situation and PIs.", 
    "42": "It appears important for pharmacists to show their daily involvement in the quality of medical care. This feedback on medication problems encountered and PIs proposed should help prescribers to identify clinical situations at risk. Nevertheless, this study also suggests that progress is possible.

This number of schizophrenia-altered expression genes is significantly higher than expected by chance (Chi-test, Padj 1.19E-50), suggesting that at least part of the antipsychotic beneficial effects is exerted by modulating the expression of these genes. Interestingly, all six of these genes were overexpressed in patients and reverted to control levels of expression after treatment. We also found a significant enrichment of genes related to obesity and diabetes, known adverse affects of antipsychotics.",

    "56": "Nausea and vomiting are common adverse events in chemotherapy. In spite of the serious effects on the quality of life and further treatment, they remain overlooked by physicians, and no standard treatment has been developed. Neurokinin-1 (NK-1) receptor antagonists and palonosetron are the major agents in the standard regimen for treating moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). However, NK-1 receptor antagonists first became commercially available at the end of 2013 and palonosetron has not been extensively applied in China. Olanzapine was recommended as a therapy for moderate and severe CINV in antiemesis-clinical practice guidelines in oncology in 2014 for the first time. It is an atypical antipsychotic agent, which can block multiple receptors on neurotransmitters. During more than 10 years, olanzapine has demonstrated significant effects in preventing CINV and treating breakthrough and refractor CINV, which was observed in case reports, precise retrospective studies, and phase I, II and III clinical trials, with no grade 3 to 4 adverse events. In particular, it is superior to aprepitant and dexamethasone in delayed nausea and vomiting. Therefore, this compound is worthy of further investigation.",

A systematic literature search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials comparing dexmedetomidine premedication with midazolam or ketamine premedication or placebo in children. Two reviewers independently performed the study selection, quality assessment and data extraction. The original data were pooled for the meta-analysis with Review Manager 5. The main parameters investigated included satisfactory separation from parents, satisfactory mask induction, postoperative rescue analgesia, emergence agitation and postoperative nausea and vomiting. Thirteen randomized controlled trials involving 1190 patients were included. When compared with midazolam, premedication with dexmedetomidine resulted in an increase in satisfactory separation from parents (RD\u200a=\u200a0.18, 95% CI: 0.06 to 0.30, p\u200a=\u200a0.003) and a decrease in the use of postoperative rescue analgesia (RD\u200a=\u200a-0.19, 95% CI: -0.29 to -0.09, p\u200a=\u200a0.0003). Children treated with dexmedetomidine had a lower heart rate before induction. The incidence of satisfactory mask induction, emergence agitation and PONV did not differ between the groups. Dexmedetomidine was superior in providing satisfactory intravenous cannulation compared to placebo. This meta-analysis suggests that dexmedetomidine is superior to midazolam premedication because it resulted in enhanced preoperative sedation and decreased postoperative pain. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the dosing schemes and long-term outcomes of dexmedetomidine premedication in pediatric anesthesia.",

Common associated ocular pathologies include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and cataracts. Several theories have been proposed to try to explain the visual hallucinations. However, the pathophysiology remains poorly understood, and treatment is largely based on anecdotal data. The lack of awareness of CBS among medical professionals often leads to inappropriate diagnosis and medication. In a country like India, where awareness of mental health is not widespread, cultural myths and stigma prevent patients from seeking professional help. Here we describe two cases of CBS and revisit different ocular morbidities that have been reported to occur in conjunction with CBS. Psychiatrists and ophthalmologists alike must be sensitive to this clinical condition to ensure prompt diagnosis and treatment.",

We examined the prevalence of and factors associated with benzodiazepine use among 482 patients with bipolar I or II disorder enrolled in the Bipolar CHOICE study. Eighty-one subjects were prescribed benzodiazepines at study entry and were considered benzodiazepine users. Stepwise logistic regression was used to model baseline benzodiazepine use versus nonuse, using entry and exit criteria of P < 0.1. In bivariate analyses, benzodiazepine users were prescribed a significantly higher number of other psychotropic medications and were more likely to be prescribed lamotrigine or antidepressants as compared with benzodiazepine nonusers. Benzodiazepine users were more likely to have a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder and comorbid anxiety disorder, but not comorbid alcohol or substance use disorders. Benzodiazepine users also had experienced more anxiety and depressive symptoms and suicidality, but not irritability or manic symptoms, than did benzodiazepine nonusers. In the multivariate model, anxiety symptom level (regardless of diagnosis), lamotrigine use, number of concomitant psychotropic medications, college education, and high household income predicted benzodiazepine use. Benzodiazepine use in patients with bipolar disorders is associated with greater illness complexity as indicated by a higher number of concomitant psychotropic medications and higher anxiety symptom burden, regardless of a comorbid anxiety disorder diagnosis. Demographic factors were also important determinants of benzodiazepine use, which may be related to access to care and insurance coverage for benzodiazepines.",

First, an 8-year-old Caucasian boy with cryptogenic Lennox-Gastaut syndrome beginning at 3.5 years of age, who was experiencing multiple daily generalized tonic-clonic, absence, myoclonic, and tonic seizures at presentation. Second, a 25-year-old, left-handed, White Hispanic man with moderate mental retardation and medically refractory seizures that he began experiencing at 1 year of age, secondary to tuberous sclerosis. When first presented to an epilepsy center, he had been receiving levetiracetam, valproate, and clonazepam, but reported having ongoing and frequent seizures. Third, a 69-year-old Korean woman who had been healthy until she had a stroke in 2009 with subsequent right hemiparesis; as a result, she became less physically and socially active, and had her first convulsive seizure approximately 4 months after the stroke.",

Consideration and discussion of the pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic, and clinical properties of 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepine action provide a rationale on why and how these transitions were successful.", 
    "80": "Stiripentol is an antiepileptic drug (AED) approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of Dravet Syndrome (DS) as adjunct treatment with valproate and clobazam. PCDH19-related epilepsy is an emerging epileptic syndrome characterized by the occurrence of epilepsy in female patients associated with mental retardation and autistic features\u00a0in most cases. It shares many features with DS: age of onset, normal development before the onset, fever sensitivity, cognitive impairment during the time, drug-resistance. Basing on the numerous similarities between DS and PCDH19-related epilepsy, we tried stiripentol in a nine and half year old female patient with PCDH19-related resistant epilepsy, as add-on treatment to valproate and clobazam. It had a surprising efficacy as the patient had a two years and ten months seizure free period, as never in her epilepsy history. Up to date, clinical trials of stiripentol have been always focused on DS. The delineation of new epileptic syndromes, as PCDH19-related epilepsy, opens new scenarios to the utilization of this AED. This case report is suggestive of a good response of PCDH19-related Epilepsy to stiripentol. However further cases and above all clinical trials are necessary to confirm this result.", 
    "81": "The anticholinergic toxidrome is well described and relatively common. Despite controversy, studies have shown that physostigmine is relatively safe and effective in reversing this toxidrome. We would expect toxicologists would be liberal in its use. We retrospectively analyzed data in the Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) registry, representing data from medical toxicologists in multiple institutions nationwide, searching for patients who exhibited an anticholinergic toxidrome, determining what treatment(s) they received, and classifying the treatments as physostigmine, benzodiazepines, physostigmine and benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, or no definitive treatment. The causal agents of the toxidrome were as reported by the treating toxicologist. Eight hundred fifteen consecutive patients with anticholinergic toxidromes were analyzed. Benzodiazepines alone were given in 28.7 %, 12.4 % were given physostigmine alone, 8.8 % received both physostigmine and benzodiazepines, 2.7 % were given antipsychotics, and 47.4 % were given no definitive treatment. In patients who received only physostigmine, there was a significant difference in the rate of intubation (1.9 vs. 8.4 %, OR 0.21, 95 % CI 0.05-0.87) versus other treatment groups. Physostigmine was given at varying rates based on causative agent with use in agents with mixed or unknown effects (15.1 %) being significantly lower than those with primarily anticholinergic effects (26.6 %) (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Patients with anticholinergic toxicity were more likely to receive benzodiazepines than physostigmine. Those patients who received only physostigmine had a significantly lower rate of intubation. Physostigmine was more likely to be used with agents exerting primarily anticholinergic toxicity than in those agents with multiple actions.", 
    "82": "GABAA receptors are pentameric chloride ion channels that are opened by GABA. We have screened a cell line derived from human glioblastoma, U3047MG, for expression of GABAA receptor subunit isoforms and formation of functional ion channels. We identified GABAA receptors subunit \u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b15, \u03b21, \u03b22, \u03b23, \u03b4, \u03b33, \u03c0, and \u03b8 mRNAs in the U3047MG cell line. Whole-cell GABA-activated currents were recorded and the half-maximal concentration (EC\u2085\u2080) for the GABA-activated current was 36 \u03bcM. The currents were activated by THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol) and enhanced by the benzodiazepine diazepam (1 \u03bcM) and the general anesthetics etomidate and propofol (50 \u03bcM). In line with the expressed GABAA receptors containing at least the \u03b13\u03b23\u03b8 subunits, the receptors were highly sensitive to etomidate (EC\u2085\u2080=55 nM). Immunocytochemistry identified expression of the \u03b13 and \u03b23 subunit proteins. Our results show that the GABAA receptors in the glial cell line are functional and are modulated by classical GABAA receptor drugs. We propose that the U3047MG cell line may be used as a model system to study GABAA receptors function and pharmacology in glial cells.", 
    "83": "Chemical modification of the physiologically active substances and creation of prodrugs is one of the ways for pharmacotherapy optimization. The aim of the work was determination of the kinetic parameters ofnonspecific esterases that catalyze hydrolysis of new hypnotic drug Levana (1,4-benzodiazepine derivative). The experiments were carried out using the 14C-labelled Levana and its active metabolite - 3-hydrixyphenazepam. In vitro it was shown that Levana undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis even in buffer solution (pH 7.4), though in plasma and homogenates of brain and liver this process is more intensive (conventional Vmax was 6.9 \u00b1 0.5, 19 \u00b1 4 and 12 \u00b1 1 mM/(h\u00b7mg of protein, correspondingly). The samples mentioned differ by activity of tissue esterases being most active in the liver (conventional K 0.45 \u00b1 0.04 mM for the liver and 47 \u00b1 11 mM for the brain). In plasma carboxylesterase activity (for Levana) is the lowest (conventional K 129 \u00b1 10 mM). In vivo it was shown that Levana more easily permeates brain-blood barrier (compared to 3-hydroxyphenazepam), that leads to higher concentrations (after hydrolysis) of its metabolite in brain tissue. Also it is quantitatively estimated as the increase of concentration (brain/blood) ratio ~1.4 times.", 
    "84": "The second-generation antipsychotic olanzapine is effective in reducing psychotic symptoms but can cause extreme weight gain in human patients. We investigated the role of the gut microbiota in this adverse drug effect using a mouse model. First, we used germ-free C57BL/6J mice to demonstrate that gut bacteria are necessary and sufficient for weight gain caused by oral delivery of olanzapine. Second, we surveyed fecal microbiota before, during, and after treatment and found that olanzapine potentiated a shift towards an \"obesogenic\" bacterial profile. Finally, we demonstrated that olanzapine has antimicrobial activity in vitro against resident enteric bacterial strains. These results collectively provide strong evidence for a mechanism underlying olanzapine-induced weight gain in mouse and a hypothesis for clinical translation in human patients.", 
    "85": "This study assessed the efficacy of diazepam, and the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists perampanel and GYKI52466 in a lithium-pilocarpine status epilepticus (SE) model. SE was induced in rats using lithium chloride, scopolamine methyl bromide, and pilocarpine. Diazepam 10, 20, or 40 mg kg(-1), or perampanel 1, 2.5, 5, or 8 mg kg(-1) were administered intravenously at 10 or 30 min after seizure onset, and GYKI52466 50 mg kg(-1), or combinations of diazepam 2.5-5 mg kg(-1) and perampanel 0.5-1 mg kg(-1), were administered intravenously at 30 min after seizure onset. Diazepam 20 mg kg(-1) terminated seizures (based on electroencephalography and assessment of behavioral seizures) in 2/6 rats at 10 min and 0/6 rats at 30 min (ED50: 10 min, 30 mg kg(-1); 30 min, not determined). Perampanel 8 mg kg(-1) terminated seizures in 6/6 rats at both 10 and 30 min (ED50: 10 min 1.7 mg kg(-1); 30 min, 5.1 mg kg(-1)). GYKI52466 50 mg kg(-1) terminated seizures in 2/4 rats at 30 min. Co-administration of diazepam 5 mg kg(-1) and perampanel 1 mg kg(-1) terminated seizures in 9/9 rats at 30 min. In conclusion, perampanel and GYKI52466 provided efficacy in a lithium-pilocarpine SE model at 30 min after seizure onset, when SE was refractory to diazepam, supporting the therapeutic potential of AMPA receptor antagonists for refractory SE. The perampanel dose required to terminate seizures was reduced by combination with diazepam, suggesting synergy.", 
    "86": "GABAA receptors are the main fast inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain, and targets for many clinically important drugs widely used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, insomnia and in anesthesia. Nonetheless, there are significant risks associated with the long-term use of these drugs particularly related to development of tolerance and addiction. Addictive mechanisms of GABAA receptor drugs are poorly known, but recent findings suggest that those drugs may induce aberrant neuroadaptations in the brain reward circuitry. Recently, benzodiazepines, acting on synaptic GABAA receptors, and modulators of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors (THIP and neurosteroids) have been found to induce plasticity in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons and their main target projections. Furthermore, depending whether synaptic or extrasynaptic GABAA receptor populations are activated, the behavioral outcome of repeated administration seems to correlate with rewarding or aversive behavioral responses, respectively. The VTA dopamine neurons project to forebrain centers such as the nucleus accumbens and medial prefrontal cortex, and receive afferent projections from these brain regions and especially from the extended amygdala and lateral habenula, forming the major part of the reward and aversion circuitry. Both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABAA drugs inhibit the VTA GABAergic interneurons, thus activating the VTA DA neurons by disinhibition and this way inducing glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. However, the GABAA drugs failed to alter synaptic spine numbers as studied from Golgi-Cox-stained VTA dendrites. Since the GABAergic drugs are known to depress the brain metabolism and gene expression, their likely way of inducing neuroplasticity in mature neurons is by disinhibiting the principal neurons, which remains to be rigorously tested for a number of clinically important anxiolytics, sedatives and anesthetics in different parts of the circuitry.",

The apparent total clearance (CL/F) and distribution volume (V CLB/F) of clobazam and the elimination rate constant of N-CLB (Kem) were related to body weight by allometric equations. Mean population estimates (% inter-individual variability) were 1.23 L/h (29%) for CL/F, 39.1 L (18%) for V CLB/F and 0.0706 h(-1) (26%) for Kem. The AUC values for clobazam and N-CLB were found to increase by 100% when bodyweight increased from 10 to 60 kg, and the simulated C trough values were higher than the currently accepted target values (0.03-0.3 mg/L for clobazam and 0.3-3 mg/L for N-CLB).",

The onset of sedation was 1.5 to 2.5 minutes in the remimazolam dose groups compared with 5 minutes for midazolam. Because this was a single administration study, sedation could be maintained for as long as necessary to complete the procedure, using rescue midazolam or propofol. Recovery from sedation was rapid for all treatment groups but was influenced by the choice of rescue medication. There were no obvious differences in the safety profiles of remimazolam and midazolam.", 
    "94": "This exploratory dose-finding study showed that a single administration of remimazolam (0.10-0.20 mg/kg) was capable of inducing rapid sedation with a quick recovery profile in patients undergoing a diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. The safety profile was favorable and appeared to be similar to that of midazolam, warranting further development of this short-acting compound.",

A phase I, open-label, randomized study was conducted in 42 healthy male participants to assess the effect of brivaracetam on CYP3A activity using midazolam as a probe. Participants were randomized to oral brivaracetam 5, 50, or 150\u2009mg/day from Day 8 to Day 14. A single oral dose (7.5\u2009mg) of midazolam was administered on Days 1, 13, and 20, and full pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained. For all brivaracetam doses, the areas under the plasma concentration-time curves from 0 to infinity (AUCinf ) for midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam were similar on Days 13 and 20 compared with Day 1. Following brivaracetam 150\u2009mg/day, the Day 13/Day 1 AUCinf ratio (90% confidence interval) was 1.09 (0.97, 1.21) and 1.04 (0.93, 1.17) for midazolam and 1'-hydroxymidazolam, respectively. For the Day 20/Day 1 comparison, the corresponding AUCinf ratios were 1.10 (0.98, 1.23) and 1.07 (0.97, 1.18). Maximum midazolam plasma concentration was increased on both Day 13 and Day 20 vs. Day 1 but the relevance of this finding was unclear. This study indicates that brivaracetam up to 150\u2009mg/day has no significant inducing or inhibiting effect on CYP3A activity.", 
    "96": "Tumor-specific targeting ligands were recently exploited to deliver both imaging and therapeutic agents selectively to cancer tissues in vivo. Because the cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK2R) is overexpressed in various human cancers (e.g., lung, medullary thyroid, pancreatic, colon, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors) but displays limited expression in normal tissues, natural ligands of CCK2R were recently explored for use in the imaging of CCK2R-expressing cancers. Unfortunately, the results from these studies revealed not only that the peptidic CCK2R ligands were unstable in vivo but also that the ligands that mediated good uptake by tumor tissues also promoted a high level of retention of the radioimaging agent in the kidneys, probably because of capture of the conjugates by peptide-scavenging receptors. In an effort to reduce the normal organ retention of CCK2R-targeted drugs, we synthesized a nonpeptidic ligand of CCK2R and examined its specificity for CCK2R both in vitro and in vivo.",

After synthesis and purification, 4 complexes with different physicochemical properties were evaluated for binding to CCK2R-transfected HEK 293 cells. The best conjugate, termed CRL-3-(99m)Tc, was injected into mice bearing CCK2R tumor xenografts and examined by \u03b3 scintigraphy and SPECT/CT. The uptake of the conjugate in various organs was also quantified by tissue resection and \u03b3 counting.",

    "122": "Ghrelin (Grh) is an endogenous ligand of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor. In neonatal chicks, central Ghr induces anxiogenic-like behavior but strongly inhibits food intake. The intermediate medial mesopallium (IMM) of the chick forebrain has been identified to be a site of the memory formation, and the modulation of the GABAA receptors that are present here modifies the expression of behavior. Thus, the GABAergic system may constitute a central pathway for Ghr action in regulating the processes of food intake and stress-related behaviors. Therefore, we investigated if the effect of systemic administration of bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist) and diazepam (benzodiazepine receptor agonist) on the anxiety in an Open Field test and inhibition in food intake induced by Grh (30pmol) when injected into IMM, were mediated by GABAergic transmission. In Open Field test, bicuculline was able to block the anxiogenic-like behavior induced by Ghr, whereas diazepam did not produce it. However, the co-administration of bicuculline or diazepam plus Ghr did not show any change in food intake at 30, 60 and 120min after injection compared to Ghr alone. Our results indicate for the first time that Ghr, injected into the forebrain IMM area, induces an anxiogenic-like behavior, which was blocked by bicuculline but not diazepam, thus suggesting that Ghr plays an important role in the response pattern to acute stressor, involving the possible participation of the GABAergic system. Nevertheless, as neither drug affected the hypophagia induced by intra-IMM Ghr, this suggests that it may be mediated by different mechanisms.", 
    "123": "Some argue that there is no evidence to support the use of antiepileptic drug (AED) blood level monitoring when treating people with epilepsy (PWE). This paper identifies how AED monitoring can be invaluable in such treatment. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES: (i) Compliance: Antiepileptic drug blood levels often confirm noncompliance rather than adequate seizure control, confirming subtherapeutic levels in PWE attending hospitals due to seizures. Routine monitoring of AED levels may prevent breakthrough seizures by identifying noncompliance and instituting heightened compliance measures before experiencing breakthrough seizures without modifying dosages. For PWE attending hospitals due to seizures, loading with the AED shown to be subtherapeutic may be all that is required. (ii) Cluster seizures and status epilepticus: When using long-acting AEDs to complement benzodiazepines, blood level monitoring confirms that an adequate dosage was given and, if not, a further bolus can be administered with further monitoring. This is particularly useful when using rectal administration of AEDs. (iii) Polypharmacy: Polypharmacy provokes drug interactions in which case AED monitoring helps in differentiating adequate dosing, offending AED with toxicity and free level measuring benefits when total levels are unhelpful. (iv) Generic substitution: Generic AEDs can fluctuate considerably from a parent compound, and even a parent compound, sourced from an alternative supplier, may have altered bioavailability for which blood level monitoring is very useful.",

Among SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine had great liability to induce weight gain and metabolic adverse reactions.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the differential effects of antipsychotics (olanzapine and clozapine) on the levels of adipocytokines (leptin and adiponectin) and total ghrelin. Three hundred and thirty-three patients with schizophrenia under clozapine or olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Control participants were recruited from a healthy community population based on a health investigation (N=119). Fasting blood samples for glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin, and total ghrelin were analyzed. There were significant differences in the levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose between these three groups. Post hoc comparisons showed that the olanzapine group had the highest levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. The levels of leptin, adiponectin, and total ghrelin were also significantly different between the three groups after controlling age and body mass index (BMI). Post hoc comparisons showed that the olanzapine group had the lowest levels of adiponectin and total ghrelin. The present study found that the uses of olanzapine and clozapine were associated with changes in adipocytokines and total ghrelin, even after adjusting potential confounding factors. Olanzapine had greater influences on adiponectin and total ghrelin than clozapine. The changes in adipocytokines and total ghrelin were a direct effect of antipsychotics on hormonal pathways of energy homeostasis, rather than the result of weight gain.", 
    "128": "As the rate of opioid prescription grows, so does fetal exposure to opioids during pregnancy. With increasing fetal exposure to both prescription and nonprescription drugs, there has been a concurrent increase in identification of Neonatal Withdrawal Syndrome (NWS) and adaptation difficulties after birth. In addition, extended use of opioids, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines in neonatal intensive care has resulted in iatrogenic withdrawal syndromes. There is a lack of evidence to support the use of any one specific evaluation strategy to identify NWS. Clinicians caring for infants must use a multimethod approach to diagnosis, including interview and toxicology screening. Signs of NWS are widely variable, and reflect dysfunction in autonomic regulation, state control, and sensory and motor functioning. Several assessment tools have been developed for assessing severity of withdrawal in term neonates. These tools assist in determining need and duration of pharmacologic therapy and help in titration of these therapies. Considerable variability exists in the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to affected babies across settings. An evidence-based protocol for identification, evaluation, and management of NWS should be in place in every nursery.

Of the agitated patients, 28 (80%) were graded as very and dangerously agitated. By multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis, independent predictors for agitation included male sex, history of long-term use of anti-depressant drugs or benzodiazepines, frontal approach of the operation, method and duration of anesthesia and presence of endotracheal intubation. Total intravenous anesthesia and balanced anesthesia with short duration were protective factors. Emergence agitation was associated with self-extubation (8.6% vs 0%, P\u200a=\u200a0.005).

However, little is known about the long-term effects of AAPD treatment before the brain is fully developed. Indeed, we and others have previously reported that treatment of adolescent rats with olanzapine (OLA; a widely prescribed AAPD) on postnatal days 28-49, under dosing conditions that approximate those employed therapeutically in humans, causes long-term behavioral and neurobiological perturbations. We have begun to study the mechanisms of these effects. Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5HT) regulate many neurodevelopmental processes. Currently approved AAPDs exert their therapeutic effects principally through their DAergic activities, although in schizophrenia (SZ) and some other diseases for which AAPDs are prescribed, DAergic dysfunction is accompanied by abnormalities of glutamatergic (GLUergic) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acidergic (GABAergic) transmission. Here, we use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) to investigate the effects of adolescent OLA administration on GABA and GLU levels. We found that the treatment caused long-term reductions in the levels of both GLU and GABA in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of adult rats treated with OLA during adolescence. The NAc is a key node in the brain's \"reward\" system, whose function is also disrupted in schizophrenia. Further research into potential, OLA-induced changes in the levels of GLU and GABA in the NAc and other brain areas, and the dynamics and mechanisms of those changes, are an essential step for devising new adjunct therapies for existing AAPDs and for designing new drugs that increase therapeutic effects and reduce long-term abnormalities when administered to pediatric patients.",

Research has suggested that autonomic imbalance is a common pathway to increased morbidity and mortality for CVD. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis is a non-invasive method that assesses autonomic imbalance, and low HRV is correlated with high cardiovascular risk. Olanzapine, a widely used antipsychotic drug, is considered to have good cardiac safety because of not causing significant corrected QT-interval (QTc) prolongation; however, it is still unclear whether olanzapine affects HRV. We recruited 83 patients with schizophrenia who were medication-free for at least 1 month and tested their HRV at the baseline and 4 weeks after treatment with olanzapine. We found that patients who had substantial weight gain (EWG) manifested significantly lower HRV than those who had non-substantial weight gain (NWG) and that HRV decrease was positively correlated to an increase in body mass index (BMI) and weight gain. Our results indicate that olanzapine-induced weight gain may play an important role in its potential cardiovascular risk. Since olanzapine has a very high potential for weight gain compared with other antipsychotics, further research is needed to explore its cardiovascular safety profile, specifically long-term cardiac safety.",

    "162": "A robust and validated method based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) has been developed for the simultaneous determination of remimazolam, which is a new chemical entity, and its major carboxylic acid metabolite (M1) in human plasma. Plasma samples were pre-purified by protein precipitation procedure and analyzed using an isocratic chromatographic separation over an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile-water containing 10mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.4mLmin(-1). Positive electrospray ionization was employed as the ionization source in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The analysis time was about 1.5min. The method was fully validated over the concentration range of 0.5-1000ngmL(-1) for both analytes. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.5ngmL(-1). Inter- and intra-batch precision was less than 8.4% and the accuracy was within 88.8-107.0%. The mean extraction recoveries obtained from three concentrations of QC plasma samples were 96.8%, 98.7% and 98.6% for remimazolam, 98.7%, 99.8% and 101.5% for M1, respectively. Selectivity, matrix effect and stability were also validated. The method was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of remimazolam in Chinese healthy subjects.", 
    "163": "Urine specimens submitted for pain management drug testing often contain multiple psychotherapeutic drugs, in addition to opioids. Immunoassay-based screen-and-confirm approaches typically used for clinical drug testing have limited sensitivity to detect therapeutic concentrations of many drugs prescribed in pain management and do not differentiate between drugs in the same class. In addition, screening for all the various illicit and prescription drugs that may be present in the pain management population requires as many as 10-20 individual immunoassays. High-resolution MS approaches have the potential to transform the way clinical drug testing is performed for pain management.", 
    "164": "The increased use of opioid analgesics, sedative hypnotics and stimulants, coupled with the associated risks of overdose have raised concerns around the inappropriate prescribing of these monitored drugs.

No further significant change was observed after the introduction of the narcotic monitoring system (p\u00a0=\u00a00.8). By May 2013, the prevalence had dropped to 1.0%. Inappropriate benzodiazepine prescribing was significantly influenced by both the legislation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the monitoring system (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), which together reduced potentially inappropriate prescribing by 50.0% between October 2011 and May 2013 (from 0.4% to 0.2%). The prevalence of potentially inappropriate prescribing of stimulants was significantly influenced by the introduction of the monitoring system in May 2012, falling from 0.7% in April 2012 to 0.3% in May 2013 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).",

In older people (\u2265 65 years), the incidence of benzodiazepine use decreased from 55.5 to 30.3 users per 1000, whereas the incidence of Z-drug use increased from 7.3 to 20.3 users per 1000 over the study period. Among those 18-64 years of age, the incidence of benzodiazepine use decreased from 30.1 to 27.6 users per 1000, but the increase in incidence of Z-drug use was more than 2-fold. The youngest population (\u2264 17 years) showed the lowest rates of use of these drugs. The highest rates of use were observed among older women and the low-income population.",

Currently, a considerable number of patients with schizophrenia do not receive standardised and systematic treatment in China. In the past years, many controlled trials have been conducted in chronic schizophrenia. In contrast, research on first-episode schizophrenia is lacking. This paper describes the background and design of the Chinese First-Episode Schizophrenia Trial project--a multicentre, randomised, open-label clinical trial. A total of 600 first-episode schizophrenia patients were randomly divided into 3 groups and treated with risperidone, aripiprazole, and olanzapine for 1 year. During the study period, only 1 medication change of the 3 antipsychotic medications was allowed.", 
    "177": "Increasing evidence indicates that central dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is involved in pathophysiology of anxiety, in particular the DA receptor subtype 3 (D3R). We previously reported that D3R null mice (D3R(-/-)) exhibit low baseline anxiety levels and that acutely administrated diazepam is more effective in D3R(-/-) than in wild type (WT) when tested in the elevated plus maze test (EPM). Here we tested the hypothesis that genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of D3R affect GABAA subunit expression, which in turn modulates anxiety-like behaviour as well as responsiveness and tolerance to diazepam. D3R(-/-) mice exhibited tolerance to diazepam (0.5mg/kg, i.p.), assessed by EPM, as fast as after 3 day-treatment, performing similarly to untreated D3R(-/-) mice; conversely, WT exhibited tolerance to diazepam after a 14-21 day-treatment. Analysis of GABAA \u03b16 subunit mRNA expression by qPCR in striatum showed that it was about 15-fold higher in D3R(-/-) than in WT. Diazepam treatment did not modify \u03b16 expression in D3R(-/-), but progressively increased \u03b16 expression in WT, to the level of untreated D3R(-/-) after 14-21 day-treatment. BDNF mRNA expression in striatum was remarkably (>10-fold) increased after 3 days of diazepam-treatment in both WT and D3R(-/-); such expression level, however, slowly declined below control levels, by 14-21 days. Following a 7 day-treatment with the selective D3R antagonist SB277011A, WT exhibited a fast tolerance to diazepam accompanied by a robust increase in \u03b16 subunit expression. In conclusion, genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade of D3R accelerate the development of tolerance to repeated administrations of diazepam and increase \u03b16 subunit expression, a GABAA subunit that has been linked to diazepam insensitivity. Modulation of GABAA receptor by DA transmission may be involved in the mechanisms of anxiety and, if occurring in humans, may have therapeutic relevance following repeated use of drugs targeting D3R.", 
    "178": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of benzodiazepine (midazolam) administration on rat conditioned fear responses and on local brain activity (c-Fos and CRF expressions) of low- (LR) and high- (HR)anxiety rats after the first and second contextual fear test sessions. The animals were divided into LR and HR groups based on the duration of their conditioned freezing response in the first contextual fear test. The fear-re-conditioned LR and HR animals (28 days later) had increased freezing durations compared with those durations during the first conditioned fear test. These behavioral effects were accompanied by increased c-Fos expression in the medial amygdala (MeA), the basolateral amygdala (BLA), and the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei and elevated CRF expression in the MeA. All these behavioral and immunochemical effects of fear re-conditioning were stronger in the LR group compared with the effects in the HR group. Moreover, in the LR rats, the re-conditioning led to decreased CRF expression in the primary motor cortex (M1) and to increased CRF expression in the BLA. The pretreatment of rats with midazolam before the second exposure to the aversive context significantly attenuated the conditioned fear response, lowered the serum corticosterone concentration, decreased c-Fos and CRF expressions in the MeA and in the BLA, and increased CRF complex density in M1 area only in the LR group. These studies have demonstrated that LR rats are more sensitive to re-exposure to fear stimuli and that midazolam pretreatment was associated with modified brain activity in the amygdala and in the prefrontal cortex in this group of animals. The current data may facilitate a better understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms responsible for individual differences in the psychopathological processes accompanying some anxiety disorders characterized by stronger reactivity to re-exposure to stressful challenges, e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder.", 
    "179": "Febrile seizures are the most common type of seizure among children that can be prevented by using prophylactic drugs like Clobazam and Diazepam. The present prospective study was conducted in the Department of Pediatrics, Mymensingh Medical College Hospital and Community Based Medical College Hospital, Bangladesh over a period of 1 year from July 2012 to June 2013 to compare the effectiveness of intermittent Clobazam versus Diazepam therapy in preventing the recurrence of febrile seizures and assessed adverse effects of each drug. A total of 65 patients (32 children administered Clobazam and rest 33 children received Diazepam) of simple and complex febrile seizures aged 6 months to 5 years of both sexes were the study population. Data were collected by interview of the patients, clinical examination and laboratory investigations using the research instrument. Data were analyzed by using Chi-square (\u03c72) Test, Student's 't' Test and Fisher's Exact Test. For all analytical tests, the level of significance was set at 0.05 and p<0.05 was considered significant. The proportion of patients was higher between age 12-36 months and male was predominant in the both Clobazam and Diazepam groups. Over 31% of patients in Clobazam group who experienced episode of fever within 3 months, 40.6% within 6 months and 9.4% within 9 months compared to 36.4% in Diazepam group within 3 months, 45.5% within 6 months & 12.1% within 9 months after discharge from the hospital. Three (9.4%) patients in Clobazam group and 7(21.3%) in Diazepam group who experienced febrile convulsion during the follow up period. From the data adverse effects within 3 and 6 months experienced by the patient's drowsiness, sedation and ataxia were higher in Diazepam group than those in Clobazam group. However, within 9 months lethargy and irritability were somewhat higher in Clobazam group than those in Diazepam group. The mean duration of hospitalization was significantly higher in Diazepam group compared to Clobazam group (6.0\u00b11.0 vs. 4.6\u00b10.08 days, P<0.001). Seven (21.2%) out of 33 children with febrile seizures in Diazepam group had a history of recurrent seizures, whereas 3(9.4%) of 32 children in the Clobazam group. The risks of recurrent febrile seizure in the Diazepam group was 2.6 times greater compared to those in the Clobazam group (P=0.186). The result indicates that Clobazam is safe, efficacious, requires less frequent dosing and has less adverse effects such as drowsiness, sedation, ataxia and irritability as compared to Diazepam. So, Clobazam may be an alternative to Diazepam given intermittently for prevention of recurrent febrile seizures.", 
    "180": "Use of cannabinoids is increasing at an alarming rate. Their easy availability, cheapness, perceptive legality and difficulty in detecting its presence with standard urine toxicologic tests, and similar factors probably contribute to the increased use, and popularity of synthetic cannabinoids. Although laws, and regulations concerning auditing of these substances have been implemented in many countries, production of new types of synthetic cannabinoids rapidly takes place. Primary psychoactive ingredient of cannabis is \u0394 9-tetrahydrocannabinoid which is partial agonist of cannabinoid receptors, while synthetic cannabinoids are potent, and complete agonists of these receptors. Therefore it is not surprising that synthetic cannabinoids exert more powerful effects than cannabinoids. Clinical effects of synthetic cannabinoids can cause referrals to emergency services, and hospitalizations. Despite lack of any specific therapy benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and fluid replacement may be required. Clinical follow-up studies are needed for better comprehension of its clinical effects, and treatment outcomes.", 
    "181": "The translocator protein (TSPO), which was previously designated as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a 3.5 billion year-old evolutionarily conserved protein expressed by most Eukarya, Archae and Bacteria, but its organization and functions differ remarkably. By taking advantage of the genomic data available on TSPO, we focused on bacterial TSPO and attempted to define functions of TSPO in Pseudomonas via in silico approaches. A tspo ortholog has been identified in several fluorescent Pseudomonas. This protein presents putative binding motifs for cholesterol and PK 11195, which is a specific drug ligand of mitochondrial TSPO. While it is a common surface distribution, the sense of insertion and membrane localization differ between \u03b1- and \u03b3-proteobacteria. Experimental published data and STRING analysis of common TSPO partners in fluorescent Pseudomonas indicate a potential role of TSPO in the oxidative stress response, iron homeostasis and virulence expression. In these bacteria, TSPO could also take part in signal transduction and in the preservation of membrane integrity.",

Despite recent increases in related mortality, the circumstances surrounding and characteristics of individuals involved in NPS deaths at a population level remain relatively unknown.", 
    "183": "The Scottish National Drug Related Death Database (NDRDD) collects a wide-range of data relating to the nature and circumstances of individuals who have died a drug-related death (DRD). We conducted exploratory descriptive analysis of DRDs involving NPS recorded by the NDRDD in 2012. Statistical testing of differences between sub-groups was also conducted where appropriate.", 
    "184": "In 2012, we found 36 DRDs in Scotland to have NPS recorded within post-mortem toxicology. However, in only 23 of these cases were NPS deemed by the reporting pathologist to be implicated in the actual cause of death. The majority of NPS-implicated DRDs involved Benzodiazepine-type drugs (13), mainly Phenazepam (12). The remaining 10 NPS-implicated deaths featured a range of different Stimulant-type drugs. The majority of these NPS-implicated deaths involved males and consumption of more than one drug was recorded by toxicology in all except one case. NPS-implicated deaths involving Benzodiazepine-type NPS drugs appeared to involve older individuals known to be using drugs for a considerable period of time, many of whom had been in prison at some point in their lives. They also typically involved combinations of opioids and benzodiazepines; no stimulant drugs were co-implicated. Deaths where stimulant-type NPS drugs were implicated appeared to be a younger group in comparison, all consuming two or more Stimulant-type drugs in combination.", 
    "185": "This exploratory study provides an important insight into the circumstances surrounding and characteristics of individuals involved in NPS deaths at a population level. It identifies important issues for policy and practice, not least the prominent role of unlicensed benzodiazepines in drug-related mortality, but also the need for a range of harm reduction strategies to prevent future deaths.",

    "187": "We report the case of an aborted awake craniotomy for a left frontotemporoinsular glioma due to ammonia encephalopathy on a patient taking Levetiracetam, valproic acid and clobazam. This awake mapping surgery was scheduled as a second-stage procedure following partial resection eight days earlier under general anesthesia. We planned to perform the surgery with local anesthesia and sedation with remifentanil and propofol. After removal of the bone flap all sedation was stopped and we noticed slow mentation and excessive drowsiness prompting us to stop and control the airway and proceed with general anesthesia. There were no post-operative complications but the patient continued to exhibit bradypsychia and hand tremor. His ammonia level was found to be elevated and was treated with an infusion of l-carnitine after discontinuation of the valproic acid with vast improvement. Ammonia encephalopathy should be considered in patients treated with valproic acid and mental status changes who require an awake craniotomy with patient collaboration.",

Poisoning may result from misuse by pet owners, off-label use of medicines or, more frequently, accidental ingestion of drugs that are improperly stored. This review focuses on classes of drugs intended for human use that are most commonly involved in the poisoning of small animals and provides an overview of poisoning episodes reported in the literature. To perform this review a comprehensive search of public databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar) using key search terms was conducted. Additionally, relevant textbooks and reference lists of articles pertaining to the topic were reviewed to locate additional related articles. Most published information on small animal poisoning by drugs intended for human use was from animal and human poison control centres or from single case reports. The dog was the species most frequently poisoned. The major drugs involved included analgesics (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), antihistamines (H1-antihistamines), cardiovascular drugs (calcium channel blockers), central nervous system drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, baclofen, benzodiazepines and zolpidem), gastrointestinal drugs (loperamide), nutritional supplements (vitamin D and iron salts) and respiratory drugs (\u03b22-adrenergic receptor agonists).",

Data were collected through a semi-structured interview within a network of partner pharmacies from the Nantes area, in France. All data were obtained exclusively through patients' declarations. 212 patients (19-64\u00a0years old) were included: they were considered dependent when they answered positively to at least three items of the DSM IV. A multivariate logistic regression and a principal component analysis (PCA) were carried out to determine their profile.",

The risk to develop BZD/z-drugs dependence is significantly associated with psychiatric history and with the quantity of BZD/z-drugs that is taken. A two factor concept of dependence could be identified according to the PCA: one axis with items of \"tolerance\" and \"long term administration or higher doses\", and a second axis with \"concerned by treatment\" and \"somatic consequences\". Conclusions/Importance: Among this BZD/z-drug dependent population, the two axes identified in the PCA represent two profiles of dependence: being in positive conditioning or suffering from negative consequences. Clinicians need to know them: these two clinical profiles may have an influence in terms of decision-making, especially to manage discontinuation.", 
    "193": "The mainstay of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) treatment involves pharmacologic treatment but can also consist of psychological treatment (i.e. cognitive behavioural therapy). First-line pharmacological treatment involves either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or the selective norepinephrine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). While these are the most effective treatments, they can produce adverse events and they also have a slower onset of action, during which there may be an increase in anxiety. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are a class of drug that is presumed to indirectly promote gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) activity and rapidly control the core symptoms associated with GAD. They have been historically effective when used in the short-term treatment of GAD but have to be used with caution due to their adverse effect profile such as drowsiness, falls, confusion, impairment of memory, and incoordination (which can be particularly problematic in the elderly), their tendency for dependence, and potential for substance abuse. For these reasons and to determine their appropriate use, this report will review the evidence for the short- and long-term use of BZDs for the treatment of GAD.", 
    "194": "Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion is regulated by estradiol feedback. This feedback switches from negative to positive in females; this switch depends on time of day in many species. Estradiol feedback is likely conveyed via afferents. Kisspeptin neurons of the arcuate nucleus and anteroventral-periventricular region (AVPV) may differentially regulate GnRH neurons during negative and positive feedback, respectively. We tested estradiol and time of day regulation of GABAergic transmission and postsynaptic response to GABA in these two populations using transgenic mice with GFP-identified kisspeptin neurons. Ovariectomized (OVX) mice treated or not with estradiol (E) were studied in the AM (negative feedback) or PM (positive feedback). GABAA receptor reversal potential was unaffected by time of day or estradiol. GABA depolarized the membrane potential of arcuate neurons from OVX+E mice; this response was blunted in cells from OVX mice. GABA hyperpolarized AVPV kisspeptin neurons, except in the OVX PM group in which GABA did not alter membrane potential attributable to a PM hyperpolarization of baseline membrane potential. In both kisspeptin neuron populations from OVX mice, the frequency of GABAergic spontaneous postsynaptic currents was increased in the PM; this increase was blunted by estradiol. In arcuate, but not AVPV, kisspeptin neurons, estradiol reduced miniature postsynaptic current amplitude independent of time of day. Using nonstationary fluctuation analysis and diazepam to manipulate GABAA receptor apparent affinity, the decrease in arcuate miniature postsynaptic current amplitude was attributed to decreased number of receptors bound by GABA. Time of day and estradiol feedback thus both target presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms to differentially regulate kisspeptin neurons via GABAergic transmission.", 
    "195": "Drug abuse is a common problem and growing concern in the United States, and over the past decade, novel or atypical drugs have emerged and have become increasingly popular. Recognition and treatment of new drugs of abuse pose many challenges for health care providers due to lack of quantitative reporting and routine surveillance, and the difficulty of detection in routine blood and urine analyses. Furthermore, street manufacturers are able to rapidly adapt and develop new synthetic isolates of older drugs as soon as law enforcement agencies render them illegal. In this article, we describe the clinical and adverse effects and purported pharmacology of several new classes of drugs of abuse including synthetic cannabinoids, synthetic cathinones, salvia, desomorphine, and kratom. Because many of these substances can have severe or life-threatening adverse effects, knowledge of general toxicology is key in recognizing acute intoxication and overdose; however, typical toxidromes (e.g., cholinergic, sympathomimetic, opioid, etc.) are not precipitated by many of these agents. Medical management of patients who abuse or overdose on these drugs largely consists of supportive care, although naloxone may be used as an antidote for desomorphine overdose. Symptoms of aggression and psychosis may be treated with sedation (benzodiazepines, propofol) and antipsychotics (haloperidol or atypical agents such as quetiapine or ziprasidone). Other facets of management to consider include treatment for withdrawal or addiction, nutrition support, and potential for transmission of infectious diseases.",

It is entirely preventable, yet this is a case of a 15-year-old, 97-kg male football player who presented unresponsive and hyperthermic after an August football practice. His blood pressure was 80/30, and his pulse was 180. He had a rectal temperature of 107.3\u00b0F, and upon entering the emergency department, he was rapidly cooled in 40 minutes. As he progressed, he developed metabolic acidosis, elevated liver enzymes, a prolapsed mitral valve with elevated troponin levels, and worsening hypotension even with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. After 3 days in the hospital, this young man was pronounced dead as a result of complications from exertional heat stroke. We address not only the complications of his hospital course relative to his positive blood cultures but also the complications that can result from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication our patient was taking. As the population of young adults becomes more obese and more highly medicated for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, we sought out these growing trends in correlation with the increase in incidence of heat-related illness.

It requires a systematic approach with key stakeholders and advanced practice nurses as subject matter experts involved throughout all phases of the implementation. Bedside clinicians assessing the patient must feel supported and valued members of the process. Challenges of all care providers need to be acknowledged and addressed.", 
    "207": "Patients with chronic diseases often receive multiple medications and are associated with increased vulnerability to medication errors. Identifying high-alert medications for them would help to prioritize the interventions with greatest impact for improving medication safety. The aim of this study was to develop a list of high-alert medications for patients with chronic illnesses (HAMC list) that would prove useful to the Spanish National Health Service strategies on chronicity.", 
    "208": "The RAND/UCLA appropriateness method was used. Drug classes/drugs candidates to be included on the HAMC list were identified from a literature search in MedLine, bulletins issued by patient safety organizations, incidents recorded in Spanish incident reporting systems, and previous lists. Eighteen experts in patient/medication safety or in chronic diseases scored candidate drugs for appropriateness according to three criteria (evidence, benefit and feasibility of implementing safety practices). Additionally they rated their priority of inclusion on a Likert scale.", 
    "209": "The final HAMC list includes 14 drug classes (oral anticoagulants, narrow therapeutic range antiepileptics, antiplatelets - including aspirin -, antipsychotics, \u03b2-blockers, benzodiazepines and analogues, corticosteroids long-term use, oral cytostatics, oral hypoglycemic drugs, immunosuppressants, insulins, loop diuretics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioid analgesics), and 4 drugs or pairs of drugs (amiodarone/ dronedarone, digoxin, oral methotrexate and spironolactone/eplerenone).",

    "211": "The objective of this study was to characterize the acute clinical effects, laboratory findings, complications, and disposition of patients presenting to the hospital after abusing synthetic cathinone. We conducted a retrospective multicenter case series of patients with synthetic cathinone abuse by searching for the terms bath salts, MDPV, methylenedioxypyrovalerone, mephedrone, methcathinone, methylone, methedrone, and cathinone within the \"agent\" field of a national clinical toxicology database (ToxIC). The medical records of these patients were obtained and abstracted by investigators at each study site. Patients with confirmatory testing that identified a synthetic cathinone in either blood or urine were included in the series. Patients who had either an undetectable synthetic cathinone test or no confirmatory testing were excluded. A data abstraction sheet was used to obtain information on each patient. We entered data into an Excel spreadsheet and calculated descriptive statistics. We identified 23 patients with confirmed synthetic cathinone exposure--all were positive for methylenedioxyprovalerone (MDPV). Eighty-three percent were male and 74 % had recreational intent. The most common reported clinical effects were tachycardia (74 %), agitation (65 %), and sympathomimetic syndrome (65 %). Acidosis was the most common laboratory abnormality (43 %). Seventy-eight percent of patients were treated with benzodiazepines and 30 % were intubated. Ninety-six percent of patients were hospitalized and 87 % were admitted to the ICU. The majority (61 %) of patients was discharged home but 30 % required inpatient psychiatric care. There was one death in our series. The majority of patients presenting to the hospital after abusing MDPV have severe sympathomimetic findings requiring hospitalization. A number of these patients require inpatient psychiatric care after their acute presentation.", 
    "212": "Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) has been successfully determined in coffee by high performance liquid chromatography dual electrode detection (LC-DED) in the dual reductive mode. Initial studies were performed to optimise the chromatographic conditions and these were found to be 50% acetonitrile, 50% 50 mM pH 2.0 phosphate buffer at a flow rate of 0.75 mL min(-1), employing a Hypersil C18, 5 \u03bcm, 250 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm column. Cyclic voltammetric studies were made to ascertain the redox behaviour of Rohypnol at a glassy carbon electrode over the pH range 2-12. Hydrodynamic voltammetry was used to optimise the applied potential at the generator and detector cells; these were identified to be -2.4 V and +0.8 V for the redox mode and -2.4 V and -0.1 V for the dual reductive mode respectively. A linear range of 0.5-100 \u03bcg mL(-1), with a detection limit of 20 ng mL(-1) was obtained for the dual reductive mode. Further studies were then performed to identify the optimum conditions required for the LC-DED determination of Rohypnol in beverage samples. A convenient and rapid method for the determination of Rohypnol in beverage samples was developed using a simple sample pre-treatment procedure. A recovery of 95.5% was achieved for a sample of white coffee fortified at 9.6 \u03bcg mL(-1) Rohypnol.",

    "214": "Male and female CHC patients from an outpatient referral center were assessed using the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the Barrat Impulsiveness Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale-Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF). Structured psychiatric interviews were performed according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. SD was assessed based on specific items in the BDI (item 21) and the HAM-A (item 12). DSL was assessed based on a specific question in the WHOQOL-BREF (item 21). Multivariate analysis was performed according to an ordinal linear regression model in which SD and DSL were considered as outcome variables.", 
    "215": "SD was reported by 60 (57.1%) of the patients according to the results of the BDI and by 54 (51.4%) of the patients according to the results of the HAM-A. SD was associated with older age, female gender, viral genotype 2 or 3, interferon-\u03b1 use, impulsiveness, depressive symptoms, antidepressant and benzodiazepine use, and lower HRQL. DSL was reported by 34 (32.4%) of the patients and was associated with depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, antidepressant use, and lower HRQL.",

    "218": "Four patients from rural Haiti and Rwanda with clinical signs of catatonia and a positive screen using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale were treated collaboratively by general physicians and mental health clinicians with either lorazepam or diazepam. Success in treatment was clinically assessed by complete remittance of catatonia symptoms.", 
    "219": "The four patients in this report exhibited a range of characteristic and recognizable signs of catatonia, including immobility/stupor, stereotypic movements, echophenomena, posturing, odd mannerisms, mutism and refusal to eat or drink. All four cases presented initially to rural outpatient general health services in resource-limited settings. In some cases, diagnostic uncertainty initially led to treatment with typical antipsychotics. In each case, proper identification and treatment of catatonia with benzodiazepines led to significant clinical improvement.", 
    "220": "Catatonia can be effectively and inexpensively treated in resource-limited settings. Identification and management of catatonia are critical for the health and safety of patients with this syndrome. Familiarity with the clinical features of catatonia is essential for health professionals working in any setting. To facilitate early recognition of this treatable disorder, catatonia should feature more prominently in global mental health discourse.", 
    "221": "GABA(A) receptors constitutively enter and exit synapses by lateral diffusion in the plane of the neuronal membrane. They are trapped at synapses through their interactions with gephyrin, the main scaffolding protein at inhibitory post-synaptic densities. Previous work has shown that the synaptic accumulation and diffusion dynamics of GABA(A)Rs are controlled via excitatory synaptic activity. However, it remains unknown whether GABA(A)R activity can itself impact the surface trafficking of the receptors. Here we report the effects of GABA(A)R agonists, antagonists and allosteric modulators on the receptor's surface dynamics. Using immunocytochemistry and single particle tracking experiments on mouse hippocampal neurons, we show that the agonist muscimol decreases GABA(A)R and gephyrin levels at synapses and accelerates the receptor's lateral diffusion within 30\u2013120 min of treatment. In contrast, the GABA(A)R antagonist gabazine increased GABA(A)R amounts and slowed down GABA(A)R diffusion at synapses. The response to GABA(A)R activation or inhibition appears to be an adaptative regulation of GABAergic synapses. Surprisingly, the positive allosteric modulator diazepam abolished the regulation induced by muscimol, and this effect was observed on \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b15 and \u03b32 GABA(A)R subunits. Altogether these results indicate that diazepam stabilizes synaptic GABA(A)Rs and thus prevents the agonist-induced regulation of GABA(A)R levels at synapses. This occurred independently of neuronal activity and intracellular calcium and involved GABA(A)R\u2013gephyrin interactions, suggesting that the changes in GABA(A)R diffusion depend on conformational changes of the receptor. Our study provides a new molecular mechanism involved in the adaptative response to changes in GABA(A)R activity and benzodiazepine treatments.", 
    "222": "Interactions between the dual BCR/ABL and Src inhibitor bosutinib and the Chk1 inhibitor PF-00477736 were examined in BCR/ABL(+) leukemia cells, particularly imatinib-resistant cells, including those with the T315I mutation. Bosutinib blocked PF-00477736-induced ERK1/2 activation and sharply increased apoptosis in association with Mcl-1 inhibition, p34(cdc2) dephosphorylation, BimEL up-regulation, and DNA damage in imatinib-resistant CML or Ph(+) ALL cell lines. Inhibition of Src or MEK1 by shRNA significantly enhanced PF-0047736 lethality. Bosutinib/PF-00477736 co-treatment also potentiated cell death in CD34(+) CML patient samples, including dasatinib-resistant blast crisis cells exhibiting both T315I and E355G mutations, but was minimally toxic to normal CD34(+) cells. Finally, combined in vivo treatment significantly suppressed BaF3/T315I tumor growth and prolonged survival in an allogeneic mouse model. Together, these findings suggest that this targeted combination strategy warrants attention in IM-resistant CML or Ph(+) ALL.", 
    "223": "Few studies have examined the relation between impulsivity and drug involvement with prison inmates, in spite of their heavy drug use. Among this small body of work, most studies look at clinically relevant drug dependence, rather than drug use specifically.", 
    "224": "N=242 adult inmates (34.8% female, 52% White) with an average age of 35.58 (SD=9.19) completed a modified version of the 15-item Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and measures assessing lifetime alcohol, opiate, benzodiazepine, cocaine, cannabis, hallucinogen, and polysubstance use. Lifetime users also reported the frequency of use for the 30days prior to incarceration.",

Implications for drug interventions are considered for this population, which is characterized by high rates of substance use and elevated impulsivity.", 
    "227": "211 compounds containing a benzodiazepine moiety (BZD) and belonging to 4 groups of different biological activity (H - inhibitors of reverse transcriptase of HIV-I virus, A - antiarrhythmic agents, G - ligands of benzodiazepine receptor in GABAergic system and C - cholecystokinin receptor antagonists) were subjected to structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. SAR investigations of all 211 BZD were based on Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) of physicochemical data connected with BBB (blood-brain barrier) permeability of studied compounds. DFA was performed with STATISTICA 10.0 software by the stepwise method and resulted in 3 discriminant functions whose quality was assessed by Wilk's lambda parameter. Calculated discriminant functions (roots) were applied to draw the scatter diagram of canonical values that showed all 211 cases divided into 4 groups of different biological activity. The method was successfully validated with a set of 38 BZD derivatives expected to belong to groups H, A, G and C. The reliability of the obtained model was confirmed with a cross-validation test. Classification functions presented in this study may be used as a practical tool for predicting new BZD drugs activity.", 
    "228": "In this study, it is shown a method for the determination of benzodiazepines and their main metabolites in urine samples by hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) in the three-phase mode. Initially, the hydrolysis step was performed using 100 \u03bcL of sodium acetate 2.0 mol/L buffer solution (pH 4.5), 25 \u03bcL of \u03b2-glucuronidase enzyme and incubation for 90 min at 55 \u00b0C. In parallel with hydrolysis, the LPME fiber (9 cm) was prepared. Its pores were filled with a mixture of dihexyl ether: 1-nonanol (9:1). Afterwards, a solution of 3.0 mol/L of HCl was introduced into the lumen of the fiber (acceptor phase). After hydrolysis, the fiber was submersed in the alkalinized urine (pH 10) containing 10% NaCl. Samples were then submitted to orbital shaking (2400 rpm) for 90 min. The acceptor phase was later withdrawn from the fiber, dried and the residue derivatized with trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) for 10 min at 60 \u00b0C with further addition of N-methyl-N-tert-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide containing 1% tert-butyldimethylchlorosilane (MTBSTFA) for 45 min at 90 \u00b0C followed by determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The calibration curves obtained showed linearity over the specified range, with a similar sensitivity to traditional techniques and a higher detection capability compared to most of the miniaturized methods described in the literature. The method has been developed and successfully validated and applied to urine samples from real cases of benzodiazepines intake.", 
    "229": "Despite more than 20 clinically approved antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), there remains a substantial unmet clinical need for patients with refractory (AED-resistant) epilepsy. Animal models of refractory epilepsy are needed for at least two goals; (1) better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance to AEDs, and (2) development of more efficacious AEDs for patients with refractory seizures. It is only incompletely understood why two patients with seemingly identical types of epilepsy and seizures may respond differently to the same AED. Prompted by this well-known clinical phenomenon, we previously evaluated whether epileptic rats respond differently to AEDs and discovered AED responsive and resistant animals in the same models. In the present study, we used the same approach for the widely used intrahippocampal kainate mouse model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In a first step, we examined anti-seizure effects of 6 AEDs on spontaneous recurrent focal electrographic seizures and secondarily generalized convulsive seizures in epileptic mice, showing that the focal nonconvulsive seizures were resistant to carbamazepine and phenytoin, whereas valproate and levetiracetam exerted moderate and phenobarbital and diazepam marked anti-seizure effects. All AEDs seemed to suppress generalized convulsive seizures. Next we investigated the inter-individual variation in the anti-seizure effects of these AEDs and, in case of focal seizures, found responders and nonresponders to all AEDs except carbamazepine. Most nonresponders were resistant to more than one AED. Our data further validate the intrahippocampal kainate mouse model as a model of difficult-to-treat focal seizures that can be used to investigate the determinants of AED efficacy.", 
    "230": "Abnormalities of GABAergic interneurons are some of the most consistent findings from post-mortem studies of schizophrenia. However, linking these molecular deficits with in vivo observations in patients - a critical goal in order to evaluate interventions that would target GABAergic deficits - presents a challenge. Explanatory models have been developed based on animal work and the emerging experimental literature in schizophrenia patients. This literature includes: neuroimaging ligands to GABA receptors, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of GABA concentration, transcranial magnetic stimulation of cortical inhibitory circuits and pharmacologic probes of GABA receptors to dynamically challenge the GABA system, usually in combination with neuroimaging studies. Pharmacologic challenges have elicited behavioral changes, and preliminary studies of therapeutic GABAergic interventions have been conducted. This article critically reviews the evidence for GABAergic dysfunction from each of these areas. These methods remain indirect measures of GABAergic function, and a broad array of dysfunction is linked with the putative GABAergic measures, including positive symptoms, cognition, emotion, motor processing and sensory processing, covering diverse brain areas. Measures of receptor binding have not shown replicable group differences in binding, and MRS assays of GABA concentration have yielded equivocal evidence of large-scale alteration in GABA concentration. Overall, the experimental base remains sparse, and much remains to be learned about the role of GABAergic interneurons in healthy brains. Challenges with pharmacologic and functional probes show promise, and may yet enable a better characterization of GABAergic deficits in schizophrenia."
