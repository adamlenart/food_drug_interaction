    "0": "1. The running component of audiogenic seizures in mice has been used as the basis of a sequential screening test for the detection of a variety of centrally acting drugs.2. For acceptance by the test, an active compound must completely suppress the running component in a total of sixteen mice at a dose of 1/5 LD50 intraperitoneally.3. Considerable economies in the numbers of animals required for screening have been achieved, the mean number of mice required to reject an inactive compound being 2.0.4. The running component is highly sensitive to anticonvulsants and general central depressants, and insensitive to phenothiazine tranquillizers and morphine. Reserpine caused an increase in the severity of the running component.5. The statistical model used in this test is of general application to screening test situations which use quantal data.", 
    "1": "Chlordiazepoxide plus clidinium bromide (Librax(R)) was evaluated and compared with a placebo by means of a random sample, double-blind crossover technique in 42 patients presenting ordinary functional gastrointestinal disorders.", 
    "2": "* 73.9 percent excellent-to-good response to the active drug in patients receiving it before they received the placebo, compared with 44.5 percent in those who did not receive it until after the placebo period.* 58.9 percent excellent-to-good response to the active drug in patients who received it after the placebo period, as compared with 31.8 percent in those receiving the placebo last.* Overall clinical response 67.5 percent excellent-to-good with the active drug as compared with 37.5 percent with the placebo.* Excellent-to-good results in 12 follow-up patients receiving the known active drug.* Statistically significant symptomatic response in four of eight target symptoms. The tranquilizer-anticholinergic preparation used appeared to improve not only patient outlook and attitudes but to effectively relieve both the physiologic and psychic manifestations of common functional gastrointestinal disorders.", 
    "3": "The use of diazepam for premedication before elective caesarean section increased the incidence of unpleasant recall postoperatively, compared with atropine in a previous study. This finding suggests that diazepam is unsuitable for this type of anaesthesia."
