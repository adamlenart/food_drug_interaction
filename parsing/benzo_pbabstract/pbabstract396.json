For this purpose the food reinforcement usually used was replaced by a social reinforcement. The results show that learning and memory can be assessed using this procedure. Moreover, under these experimental conditions, drugs such as scopolamine, amphetamine or kinurenic acid injected into the nucleus accumbens produced behavioral deficits. BC 264, a highly selective CCK-B agonist, peripherally administered or infused into the anterolateral part of the nucleus accumbens also impaired memory. These effects were suppressed by L-365,260 supporting the involvement of CCK-B receptors and of the nucleus accumbens in memory processes.", 
    "1": "The effects of pentylenetetrazol and bicyclic gamma-butyrolactones of similar stereostructures were studied on the convulsant and benzodiazepine binding sites and chloride ionophore activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor-complex. Bicyclic gamma-butyrolactones displayed millimolar IC50 values and low stereoselectivities on [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to the convulsant sites in synaptosomal membranes of rat forebrains. Ring saturation of bicyclic gamma-butyrolactones decreased their IC50 values by one order of magnitude. The IC50 values of saturated bicyclic gamma-butyrolactones and pentylenetetrazol were increased by GABA versus its antagonist R 5135 (3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta,17-aza-androstan-11-one). A bicyclic gamma-butyrolactone and pentylenetetrazol accelerated the dissociation of [35S]TBPS, displaced [3H]flumazenil binding in two phases and blocked the muscimol-elicited chloride currents in patch-clamped cortical neurones in culture in a similar manner. These similar effects on binding and ionophore function support their common modes of action on the GABAA receptor-ionophore complex.", 
    "2": "In rat pancreatic acinar cells, amylase release and Ca2+ mobilization are related to the occupancy of CCKA receptor. The rat pancreatic acinar cell line (AR4-2J) possesses both CCKA (CCKA R) and CCKB (CCKB R) sub-type receptors. Using this cell line we attempted to determine the relative involvement of each sub-type in both amylase release and Ca2+ mobilization. For this purpose we used L 364718 a selective antagonist for CCKA R and PD 135158 a selective antagonist for CCKB R. We showed on AR4-2J cells that: a minority of CCKA R (Kd = 0.7 nM), a classical CCKB R (Kd = 0.93 nM) and a new high affinity gastrin binding site (Kd = 2.1 pM) coexisted; CCK through CCKA R and CCKB R, was more potent to stimulate amylase secretion (EC50 = 34 pM) and Ca2+ mobilization (EC50 = 30 pM) than to occupy its receptor. Gastrin induced a biphasic stimulation of amylase release. Gastrin through CCKB R was equally potent to stimulate amylase release (EC50 = 1.72 nM) and Ca2+ mobilization (EC50 = 3.1 nM), whereas through the high affinity gastrin binding site, gastrin-induced amylase release (EC50 = 0.73 pM) did not correlate with the Ca2+ mobilization (EC50 = 3.1 nM). These results demonstrated for the first time the existence, on AR4-2J cells, of a high affinity gastrin receptor whose occupation by gastrin induces amylase release.", 
    "3": "GABAA and GABAC receptors were studied on cultured or freshly isolated rat retinal bipolar cells. The cells displayed GABA-induced whole-cell currents, which were only partially blocked by high concentrations (100 microM) of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The bicuculline-resistant (GABAC) component was insensitive to the GABAA receptor modulators flunitrazepam (1 microM) and pentobarbital (50 microM). The bicuculline-sensitive portion of the current was strongly augmented by both drugs, indicating that it was mediated by conventional GABAA receptors. The GABAC and GABAA receptor subtypes displayed a 7-fold difference in their binding affinity for GABA, the EC50 values being 4.2 microM and 27.1 microM, respectively. The Hill coefficient was approximately 2 for both receptors. The bicuculline-insensitive GABAC receptors were markedly blocked by 100 microM picrotoxinin, 2-(3-carboxypropyl)-3-amino-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyridazinium bromide (SR-95531) and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, drugs known to be antagonists of GABAA receptors. Examination of single-channel currents indicated main-state conductances of 7.9 pS and 29.6 pS for GABAC and GABAA receptors, respectively. The pore diameter of open GABAC receptor channels was 5.1 A, i.e. close to the value of 5.6 A reported for the GABAA receptor. These results demonstrate that rod bipolar cells possess two populations of pharmacologically distinct GABA receptors, GABAA and novel-type GABAC receptors, which might subserve different physiological functions in controlling visual transduction in the retina.", 
    "4": "The effect of lindane (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane) on [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding and GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx was investigated in cultured cerebral cortical neurons. In addition, the cytotoxic action of lindane as well as a protection by GABA and flunitrazepam were studied together with the ability of lindane to increase the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+. Lindane was found to be toxic to the neurons, an effect that could be completely prevented by the simultaneous presence of GABA (0.1 microM) and flunitrazepam (100 microM) and reduced by GABA alone. An interaction with the GABA receptor-gated chloride channel was demonstrated by an inhibitory action of lindane on [35S]TBPS binding (IC50 188 +/- 51 nM) and on GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx in the neurons. Lindane only marginally increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in the neurons. It is concluded that the cytotoxic action of lindane is mediated through interaction with GABA receptors in a manner essentially independent of changes in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.", 
    "5": "Cholinergic replacement strategies have achieved little success in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It has been suggested that the mnemonic function of cholinergic neurons may be enhanced by treatments that reduce GABA-ergic inhibition, while preserving the normal pattern of activity in the cholinergic neurons. Following on these suggestions, the present study investigated the mnemonic effects of intra-nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM) injections of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142). Rats were surgically implanted with bilateral cannulae in the NBM prior to training in a double Y-maze. Daily training sessions continued until reference and working memory choice performance stabilized to a criterion of > or = 91% correct. Rats (n = 9) received FG 7142 bilaterally in doses of 0.2, 2.0 and 3.0 micrograms/0.5 microliter per side, muscimol (a GABAA agonist) in a dose of 0.1 microgram/0.5 microliter per side, vehicle (345 micrograms 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin/0.5 microliter saline per side) or no injection in a counterbalanced order with retraining to criterion between treatments. Muscimol impaired choice accuracy on both the reference and working memory components, but the effect was bigger for working memory, replicating our previous findings. Two doses of FG 7142 (0.2 and 2.0 micrograms/0.5 microliter) enhanced choice accuracy on the working memory component. The present results suggest that benzodiazepine partial inverse agonists may enhance mnemonic function.", 
    "6": "We investigated the effects of 1-amino-5-bromouracil on the benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex to elucidate its central action. 1-Amino-5-bromouracil neither displaced nor enhanced [3H]muscimol, [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), or [3H]dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate binding to the rat brain synaptosomal membranes. The anesthesia induced by 1-amino-5-bromouracil was potentiated by diazepam, pentobarbital, and muscimol, and was antagonized by picrotoxin but not by bicuculline. 1-Amino-5-bromouracil protected mice from picrotoxin-induced seizure and slightly ameliorated TBPS-induced seizure, but did not antagonize bicuculline-induced seizure. Diazepam antagonized both the bicuculline- and the picrotoxin-induced seizure, and pentobarbital antagonized the picrotoxin- and the TBPS-induced seizure. Our in vivo studies suggest that part of the central action of 1-amino-5-bromouracil is concerned with the benzodiazepine-GABAA receptor complex including the chloride channel.", 
    "7": "Thirty-two pre-moulting female southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) were heavily sedated with midazolam (0.04 mg/kg) combined with pethidine (4 mg/kg). This combination made it possible to give the seals intravenous injections and was rapidly antagonised by naloxone. After sedation with midazolam and pethidine, 2 to 3 mg/kg intravenous thiopentone or ketamine induced light immobilisation for approximately five minutes and allowed the animals to be intubated. Prolonged deep levels of restraint were achieved after sedation with midazolam and pethidine by repeated intravenous doses of approximately 1.5 mg ketamine/kg at 10 minute intervals, to maintain restraint for 60 minutes.", 
    "8": "A new class of pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) analogues featuring a pyrazolo[4,3-e]pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]diazepinone ring system has been designed and synthesized. These compounds, 2a-o, are characterized by the substitution of the aromatic A ring, characteristic of the PBDs, with a disubstituted pyrazole ring bearing alkyl and benzyl substituents at N6 or N7 and alkyl or carbomethoxy substituents at C8. Biological evaluation revealed an appreciable in vitro cytotoxic activity for compounds 2a,b,f-i.", 
    "9": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBzR) is associated with the outer mitochondrial membrane. Protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), an endogenous substance with high affinity for the PBzR, induced the inner membrane permeability transition (MPT) in respiring liver mitochondria de-energized by carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. Cyclosporin A (CyA), an inhibitor of the permeability transition, prevented this effect. In cultured hepatocytes, the MPT was measured as an increased [3H]sucrose-accessible space sensitive to CyA. Nanomolar concentrations of PPIX potentiated the induction of the MPT and the extent of cell killing in hepatocyte cultures de-energized by rotenone. CyA prevented the enhanced cell killing by PPIX. PPIX did not increase the rate or extent of ATP depletion, the loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, or the accumulation of long chain acyl-CoA thioesters. The association of the PBzR with the voltage-dependent anion channel of the outer mitochondrial membrane and with the adenine nucleotide carrier of the inner membrane suggests that this complex mediates the transport of PPIX across the mitochondrial membranes. In turn, this same complex participates in the MPT. Thus, the same structural complex (PBzR, voltage-dependent anion channel, and adenine nucleotide carrier) can interact with the endogenous substrate PPIX to result in different functional consequences depending on the state of mitochondrial energization.", 
    "10": "Modulation of GABA-mediated neurotransmissions by Ro 15-4513 in cerebellar slices was assessed following stimulation of the parallel fibre input, which, in this preparation, preferentially activates the inhibitory interneurones innervating Purkinje cells. Peristimulus-time histogram analysis of inhibitory responses of spontaneously-active Purkinje cells showed only a decrease in the duration of inhibition induced by Ro 19-4603. This is consistent with inverse agonism on the BZ1 receptors associated with postsynaptic GABAA receptors on Purkinje cells. 1 microM Ro 15-4513 induced a similar response but 100 nM Ro 15-4513 induced a biphasic response, with an increase in duration of inhibition preceding the decrease during continued perfusion of the compound. At lower concentrations of Ro 15-4513 the increase in inhibition predominated, the minimal effective concentration being 10 pM. 1 microM flumazenil blocked both components of this response to 100 nM Ro 15-4513, but at 100 nM flumazenil only blocked the decrease in inhibition. The ability of Ro 15-4513 but not Ro 19-4603 to enhance inhibition and its relative insensitivity to 100 nM flumazenil, parallel the affinities of these compounds for diazepam-insensitive (DI) binding sites in the cerebellum. These data suggest that the enhancement of inhibition induced by Ro 15-4513 results from its inverse agonist activity on DI receptors causing disinhibition of both granule cells and their parallel fibres and increased sensitivity to the electrical stimuli inducing activation of the inhibitory interneurones innervating Purkinje cells.", 
    "11": "Ammonia and benzodiazepines are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of various benzodiazepine-receptor ligands and neurosteroids on ammonia toxicity in mice. Administration of ammonium acetate (8-15 mmole/kg; i.p.) to Swiss Webster mice resulted in a dose-dependent increase in mortality. Pretreatment with the central benzodiazepine receptor agonist clonazepam or the antagonist Ro15-1788 (7 mg/kg each; i.p.) had no significant effect on the lethal response to 10 mmole/kg ammonium acetate. However, pretreatment with the putative antagonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, PK 11195 (10 mg/kg; i.p.), reduced mortality from 50 to 10%. Ro5-4864 (10 mg/kg; i.p.), an agonist of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, had no effect on ammonia toxicity. The neurosteroid, pregnenolone sulfate (20 mg/kg; i.p.) reduced mortality from 50 to 25%. The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, MK-801 (2 mg/kg; i.p.), had no effect on the lethal response to ammonium acetate. The results from the present study suggest a role for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors and specific neurosteroids in the alleviation of ammonia toxicity in mice.",

Impairments were observed after Dzp- and/or Scopo-pretraining treatments. Physo was without effect but antagonized the Dzp-induced impairments. beta-CCM enhanced acquisition and antagonized the Scopo-induced impairing effect. All these drugs had no effect in posttraining administration.", 
    "13": "The objectives of this study were to assess the stability of a 1 mg/ml oral midazolam solution elaborated by our Hospital Pharmacy Service, and to confirm its clinical effect in presurgical paediatric patients. The solution's stability was tested by determining its pH and its UV-visible absorption spectrum at room temperature for up to 60 days. A high performance liquid chromatography method was used to confirm it. There was no significant change in pH value of either the test or a control solution. No loss of midazolam could be detected during the test. The Anaesthesiology Service assessed the sedation quality (very good, good, bad) and the venous puncture response, 20 minutes after the administration of 0.3 mg/kg of an oral midazolam solution. Twenty children were examined (age: 4-7 years). In addition, the haemodynamic and ventilatory functions were evaluated.", 
    "14": "Patients presenting with noncardiac chest pain of psychogenic origin are one of the more challenging clinical dilemmas to primary care medicine. Key aspects to recognition of these patients are predominance of autonomic complaints, multiple presentations, clustering of physical complaints and a repeated history of negative cardiac pathology, a clinical profile of anxiety or panic disorder. Therapy can be achieved by the use of benzodiazepines. Psychiatric consultation is to be sought following successful symptom abatement from a parenteral benzodiazepine challenge in the emergency department on successive occasions.", 
    "15": "The binding characteristics of pirenzepine and oxomemazine to muscarinic receptor were studied to evaluate the selectivity of oxomemazine for the muscarinic receptor subtypes in rat cerebral microsomes. Equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate([3H]QNB) determined from saturation isotherms was 64 pM. Analysis of the pirenzepine inhibition curve of [3H]QNB binding to cerebral microsome indicated the presence of two receptor subtypes with high (Ki = 16 nM, M1 receptor) and low (Ki = 400 nM, M3 receptor) affinity for pirenzepine. Oxomemazine also identified two receptor subtypes with about 20-fold difference in the affinity for high (Ki = 84 nM, OH receptor) and low (Ki = 1.65 microM, OL receptor) affinity sites. The percentage populations of M1 and M3 receptors to the total receptors were 61:39, and those of OH and OL receptors 39:61, respectively. Both pirenzepine and oxomemazine increased the KD value for [3H]QNB without affecting the binding site concentrations and Hill coefficient for the [3H]QNB binding. Oxomemazine had a 10-fold higher affinity at M1 receptors than at M3 receptors, and pirenzepine a 8-fold higher affinity at OH receptors than at OL receptors. Analysis of the shallow competition binding curves of oxomemazine for M1 receptors and pirenzepine for OL receptors yielded that 69% of M1 receptors were of OH receptors and the remaining 31% of OL receptors, and that 29% of OL receptors were of M1 receptors and 71% of M3 receptors. However, M3 for oxomemazine and OH for pirenzepine were composed of a uniform population. These results suggest that oxomemazine could be classified as a selective drug for M1 receptors and also demonstrate that rat cerebral microsomes contain three different subtypes of M1, M3 and the other site which is different from M1, M2 and M3 receptors.", 
    "16": "We compared the inhibitory effects of histamine and pentagastrin (PG) on motilin-induced upper gastrointestinal phase III activity in conscious dogs that had surgically prepared Heidenhain pouchs (HP). Contractile activity was measured by means of chronically implanted force transducers, and changes in pH of the perfusate through the HP were monitored simultaneously. Intravenous infusion of PG (4 micrograms/kg-hr) inhibited motilin-induced phase III activity both in the main stomach and in the HP, whereas histamine (40 micrograms/kg-hr) inhibited activity only in the main stomach. Famotidine (0.3 mg/kg, i.v., the dose that completely inhibited gastric acid secretion by PG or histamine) blocked the inhibition of phase III activity induced by histamine but did not affect PG-induced inhibition. L-364,718 (1 mg/kg, i.v.), which had no effect on the PG-induced decrease in the pH of the perfusate lowered by PG, reversed the inhibition of phase III activity by PG in the HP but not in the main stomach. However, L-364,718, when combined with famotidine, potently reversed the PG-induced inhibition of phase III activity both in the main stomach and in the HP. These results show that the inhibitory effect of PG on motilin-induced phase III activity is brought about by two distinctive mechanisms, gastric acid and the cholecystokinin receptors-dependent mechanism, whereas the histamine-induced inhibition is mediated only by gastric acid. In the vagally denervated HP, however, gastric acid is not involved in an inhibitory effect of PG.",

Previous studies have shown that the drug is eliminated mainly by biotransformation in rats, dogs and monkeys. Two metabolites, mono- and bis-hydroxy analogs were demonstrated to be active in vitro. The potency of benzodiazepine receptor binding (Ki) is 3.7 nM for the parent drug, 3.3 nM for the mono-hydroxylated metabolite and 1.2 nM for the bishydroxylated metabolite, respectively. Although the metabolites are as potent as, or more so than the parent drug in vitro, they are inactive in rats in a conditioned emotional response model. This study was designed to explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo activity of the metabolites. After i.v. administration of L-663,581 or its preformed metabolites, the metabolites were cleared more slowly than the parent drug. After i.p. administration at the same dose, the areas under the curve of the metabolites were 2 to 5 times that of the parent drug. Thus, the lack of in vivo activity of the metabolites cannot be explained by the absorption and/or elimination kinetics. Brain uptake studies indicated that the permeability of the blood-brain barrier is high for L-663,581 but very poor for the metabolites; the brain extraction ratio was about 0.6 for L-663,581 and less than 0.03 for the metabolites.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "Published results suggest that delta-opioid agonists can modulate the mu-mediated analgesia. In this work, the antinociceptive effects produced by the mu agonist [D-Ala2,NMe-Phe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin or the mixed inhibitor of enkephalin-degrading enzymes RB 101 (N- [(R,S)-2-benzyl-3[(S)(2-amino-4-methyl- thio)butyldithio]-1-oxopropyl]-L-phenylalanine benzyl ester) were studied after administration of the systemically active and selective delta agonist Tyr-D-Ser(O-tert-butyl)-Gly-Phe-Leu- Thr(O-tert-butyl). In the hot-plate test in mice, Tyr-D-Ser(O-tert-butyl)-Gly- Phe-Leu-Thr(O-tert-butyl) (i.v.) potentiated the antinociceptive responses elicited by [D-Ala2,NMe-Phe4,Gly-ol5]enkephalin (i.v.) or RB 101 (i.v.). These facilitatory effects were reversed not only by prior administration of the delta-selective antagonist naltrindole (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), but also unexpectedly by the selective cholecystokinin CCK-A antagonist MK-329 (20 micrograms/kg i.p.). In addition, the CCK analog [Boc- Tyr(SO3H)-Nle-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2] (a mixed CCK-A/CCK-B agonist) increased the jump latency and this effect was blocked by MK-329 (20 micrograms/kg i.p.) and by naloxone, but not by the selective CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 (5 mg/kg i.p.). In contrast, the selective CCK-B agonist BC 264 (62 micrograms/kg i.v.) produced a hyperalgesic effect that was antagonized by L-365,260 (5 mg/kg i.p.). Taken together, these findings suggest that the potentiating effects of delta agonists on mu-mediated analgesia are due to an increase in the release of endogenous CCK interacting with CCK-A and CCK-B receptors and resulting in positive and negative regulation of the endogenous opioid system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "28": "It has recently been shown that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and central-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists inhibit the expression of the POMC gene and the release of POMC-derived peptides from hypothalamic neurons. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of GABA could be accounted for by a direct action on POMC neurons, we investigated the localization of the beta 1-subunit of the GABAA-benzodiazepine-receptor complex in the arcuate nucleus. Using a monoclonal antibody raised against a synthetic fragment of the beta 1-subunit, we demonstrate the presence of GABAA receptor on POMC neurons. The proportion of POMC neurons that exhibit immunoreactivity for the beta 1-subunit of the GABAA receptor was not significantly different in the posterior portion (73.0-76.0%) and anterior portion (61.3-62.7%) of the arcuate nucleus. The data also revealed that in the arcuate nucleus, a majority of neurons that were immunostained by the antibody to the beta 1-subunit were not POMC positive. The present results support the concept that GABAA and central-type benzodiazepine receptor agonists exert a direct inhibitory action on POMC neurons. The data also indicate the existence of subsets of POMC neurons within the arcuate nucleus.", 
    "29": "Several situations arise in the PICU patient that require the administration of drugs for sedation and analgesia. A \"cookbook\" approach is impossible because of the diversity of patient and clinical scenarios. When amnesia is required, these authors prefer a continuous infusion of a benzodiazepine such as midazolam or lorazepam. Although the majority of clinical experience has been with midazolam, lorazepam either by bolus dose or continuous infusion offers a cost-effective alternative. When analgesia is required, the addition of a continuous infusion of narcotic or the use of a PCA device in the older patient should prove effective. Although fentanyl is frequently chosen, morphine is an effective and cost-effective alternative for patients with stable cardiovascular function. The synthetic narcotics are recommended for neonates, especially following cardiac surgical procedures and those at risk for pulmonary vasospasm. Narcotics may also be used for the treatment of agitation in those situations that do not necessarily require analgesia. Our clinical experience suggests that narcotics may be more effective for sedation than benzodiazepines in children less than 1 year of age. When the above agents fail to be effective or are associated with cardiovascular depression, alternatives may include ketamine or pentobarbital. Ketamine may be useful for the unstable patient or those with a bronchospastic component to their disease process. We have found pentobarbital to be effective when the combination of benzodiazepines and narcotics fails to provide the desired level of sedation. Aside from these techniques, regional anesthesia may offer a more effective means of controlling pain in the PICU patient. These techniques may be effective when parenteral narcotics are inadequate or lead to undesired effects. Although most commonly used for postoperative analgesia, their use in patients with pain from other causes (e.g., multiple trauma) may be indicated, especially when parenteral narcotics may interfere with respiratory function or the ongoing assessment of the patient's mental status.",

While carbamazepine exerted no beneficial effect for patients with generalized anxiety disorder, it appeared to improve outcome in the panic disorder group.", 
    "45": "Results of this study indicate that panic disorder patients are more vulnerable to alprazolam withdrawal than patients with generalized anxiety disorder, and this may reflect a general diathesis of panic disorder patients to encounter more difficulty during drug withdrawal. Carbamazepine may selectively assist with alprazolam withdrawal in panic disorder patients. However, these data do not support its widespread use during benzodiazepine discontinuation, especially given its potential toxicity. In light of a proposed greater vulnerability of panic disorder patients to withdrawal, future studies need to account for differential effects related to specific diagnosis.", 
    "46": "The purpose of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of alprazolam (APZ) as an adjuvant drug to ondansentron against cisplatin-induced emesis. All patients received CDDP 100 mg/m2, and had previously received chemotherapy. We established two groups of patients randomly: Group A patients received 5-HT3 alone, and Group B received 5-HT3 and APZ. The drugs were administered as follows: 5-HT3 was given at a dose of 1 ampule 8 mg in 100 ml N/S in 10 minutes i.v. infusion before the infusion of CDDP. We continued with 1 tablet 8 mg in the afternoon and 1 before sleeping the first day; for the next two days, patients received 3 tablets 8 mg/day. APZ was given in tablets of 0.25 mg 60 minutes before CDDP infusion and then with the second and third dose of 5-HT3. We did not find significant differences in clinical parameters and factors, especially anxiety, that influenced vomiting between the examined groups. The mean number of vomiting episodes without gastric content (4.76 episodes) and the mean duration of nausea (195 minutes), were greater in Group A than in Group B (1.39 episodes, p < .0001; 91 minutes, p < .049). Differences also were found in the mean number of vomiting episodes with gastric content between the examined groups (A: 1.97; B: 1.09; p < .135). The intense of nausea and vomiting according to WHO classification was greater in Group A (grade 0, p < .004; grade 2, p < .020) than in Group B. Patients of Group B had fewer problems with appetite (p < .027), and more intense sedative effect (grade 0 [p < .001], 1 [0.027], 2 [0.022]) than patients of Group A. In conclusion APZ improved the antiemetic efficacy of ondansentron in cisplatin-induced emesis.", 
    "47": "Anxiety disorders affect 16 percent of the U.S. population. Family physicians treat 90 percent of patients presenting with one or more anxiety disorders. Common anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social phobia. Differentiation among these disorders may be difficult, since symptoms and presentations are often similar. Underlying medical disorders and depressive illness may mimic or coexist with anxiety disorders. The chronic, remitting and relapsing nature of anxiety disorders requires the institution of a long-term plan of care. The integration of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions generally produces the greatest benefit to patients. Pharmacotherapeutic options frequently prescribed by family physicians include benzodiazepines, beta blockers, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants and azapirones. Useful psychotherapeutic models featuring brief interventions include supportive and cognitive approaches, and behavioral therapies, such as biofeedback, in vivo exposure and systematic desensitization.", 
    "48": "GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors are allosterically coupled, and occupation of either receptor site increases the affinity of the other. Chronic exposure of primary neuronal cultures to benzodiazepine agonists reduces these allosteric interactions. Neurons express multiple GABAA receptor subunits, and it has been suggested that uncoupling is due to changes in the subunit composition of the receptor. To determine if uncoupling could be observed with expression of defined subunits, mouse Ltk- cells stably transfected with GABAA receptors (bovine alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma 2L subunits) were treated with flunitrazepam (Flu) or clonazepam. The increase in [3H]Flu binding affinity caused by GABA (GABA shift or coupling) was significantly reduced in cells treated chronically with the benzodiazepines, whereas the KD and Bmax of [3H]Flu binding were unaffected. The uncoupling caused by clonazepam treatment occurred rapidly with a t1/2 of approximately 30 min. The EC50 for clonazepam treatment was approximately 0.3 microM, and cotreatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5.6 microM) prevented the effect of clonazepam. The uncoupling observed in this system was not accompanied by receptor internalization, is unlikely to be due to changes in receptor subunit composition, and probably represents post-translational changes. The rapid regulation of allosteric coupling by benzodiazepine treatment of the stably transfected cells should provide insights to the mechanisms of coupling between GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors as well as benzodiazepine tolerance.", 
    "49": "The survival and development of cerebellar neurons are under the control of interacting epigenetic signals. In the present study, we have examined interactive effects of nerve growth factor (NGF) and acetylcholine on in vitro cerebellar Purkinje cell survival. In initial experiments, dissociated rat cerebellar cultures were grown for 6-7 days in the presence of NGF and the stable cholinergic agonist carbachol. Simultaneous exposure to carbachol and NGF selectively increased Purkinje cell number, whereas neither agent was effective when tested alone. The increase in survival was blocked by the muscarinic antagonists atropine (0.1 microM) and pirenzepine (10 nM), but not by methoctramine (25 nM). Nicotine had no effect on survival when tested alone or in combination with NGF. The cerebellar cultures exhibited cholinergic neuronal traits: high-affinity choline uptake, and choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities. To determine whether transmitter produced in vitro triggers Purkinje responsiveness to NGF, cells were exposed to physostigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Physostigmine alone induced an atropine-sensitive increase in cell survival that was enhanced in the presence of NGF. These data suggest that the early expression of cholinergic traits plays a role in Purkinje development. Activation of muscarinic receptors triggers enhanced Purkinje survival in the presence of NGF.", 
    "50": "The bis-quaternary W84, hexamethylene-bis-[dimethyl-(3-phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium bromide], is a potent allosteric modulator of M2-cholinoceptors. In this study we aimed at quantifying its allosteric effect on the dissociation of [3H]pirenzepine from M1-cholinoceptors in rat cerebral cortex and to measure the effects on association and equilibrium binding of [3H]pirenzepine. For sake of comparison tacrine was included which is known to be a potent allosteric modulator of [3H]pirenzepine binding to M1-receptors. Under control conditions (3 mM MgHPO4, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 23 degrees) [3H]pirenzepine binding was characterized by KD = 5 nM and Bmax = 965 fmol/mg membrane protein, the rate constants amounting to k+1 = 5.0 microM-1 x min-1 and k-1 = 0.031 min-1. W84 and tacrine reduced [3H]pirenzepine binding concentration-dependently with IC50-values of 1.9 microM and 2.6 microM, respectively. [3H]pirenzepine association was inhibited by the compounds with EC50,ass = 1.8 microM for W84 and EC50,ass = 2.4 microM for tacrine. The concentrations reducing the dissociation rate by 50% amounted to EC50,diss = 21 microM for W84 and to EC50,diss = 54 microM for tacrine. Compared with W84, the dose-reponse curves of tacrine for the investigated effects were significantly steeper. In conclusion, WS84 affected [3H]pirenzepine binding to M1-receptors allosterically with a higher potency than tacrine but probably by a different mechanism.", 
    "51": "The present work was designed to study the influence of testosterone and oestrogens on the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome in mice. Several withdrawal signs were induced by 15 mg/kg intraperitoneally of flumazenil in diazepam-treated mice. The most noticeable were jerks, usually accompanied by tail lifts, and seizures. The intensity of the diazepam withdrawal syndrome was significantly lower in male than in female mice, especially in relation to the incidence of seizures. Castrated male mice showed a significant increase in the intensity of withdrawal syndrome. In addition, diazepam produced a significant increase of body weight in males but not in females. The principal finding of the present work is that the incidence of seizures produced by the administration of flumazenil was significantly lower in male than in female diazepam-treated mice. This fact suggests that the mechanism of action of benzodiazepines is modulated by the action of sexual hormones, and that testosterone plays a relevant role.", 
    "52": "FK480 is a new synthetic non-peptide antagonist of cholecystokinin (CCK)-A receptors. The dosage form of FK480 is a soft capsule containing a solution of FK480 in a mixture of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) and glycerol to improve its bioavailability. Studies on the stability of this FK480 dosage form revealed that the main degradation occurred by optical isomerization at the asymmetric C-3 position of the pyrrolobenzodiazepine ring. The degradation reaction was accelerated by formic acid formed in a mixture of PEG 400 and glycerol. Addition of amino acids to the capsule solution retarded the isomerization by reacting with formic acid. Therefore, formic acid appears to accelerate optical isomerization of FK480.", 
    "53": "1. Monosynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA)-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were evoked in CA1 pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal slice preparation by direct stimulation of the interneurons in the presence of glutamatergic blockers and intracellular QX-314 to block GABAB-mediated postsynaptic inhibition. 2. Paired-pulse stimulation was used to activate presynaptic GABAB autoreceptors and thereby reduce the amount of transmitter release. This caused paired-pulse depression, persisting for > 3 s, and maximal at interpulse intervals between 100 and 250 ms where peak current (Ipeak) was decreased by 29.7% and decay time (t1/2) was decreased by 44.7%. There was clear correlation between changes in Ipeak and t1/2 at all interpulse intervals. 3. With paired-pulse stimulation, the decay of the second IPSC in most cells (12/18) could be resolved into two components, Ifast and Islow, each decaying monoexponentially with tau fast = 14.10 ms and tau slow = 58.87 ms. The faster decay during paired-pulse depression was predominantly caused by a larger Ifast fraction, which accounted for 27.5% of Ipeak in a single control IPSC and 79.3% at an interpulse interval of 250 ms. 4. Reducing the probability for transmitter release at all active sites by reducing [Ca2+]o from 2 mM to 1 mM decreased Ipeak by 49.7%, reduced paired-pulse depression, and partly mimicked the changes in decay kinetics seen after activation of presynaptic GABAB receptors. Lowering the stimulating intensity to 10% of the maximal value decreased Ipeak by 73.8%, but hardly affected the decay of the IPSC and the paired-pulse depression. 5. Application of the selective blocker of GABA uptake, tiagabine (20-50 microM), increased t1/2 of a single IPSC by 114% without affecting Ipeak. The increase was caused solely by an increase in tau slow of 141%. On the other hand, the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam (2 microM), selectively increased tau fast. It therefore is suggested that tau fast reflects the kinetics of the GABAA receptor/ionophore complex and tau slow the efficiency of the GABA uptake system. 6. The findings show that GABA activates postsynaptic receptors throughout the tail of a single IPSC. This could be caused by reactivation of synaptic receptors or activation of extrasynaptic receptors. The decay therefore is limited mainly by the efficiency of the uptake system. An IPSC that is maximally depressed by paired-pulse stimulation is mediated primarily by a single activation of synaptic receptors, and the decay is limited mainly by the kinetics of the GABAA receptor/ionophore complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Abrupt cessation of chronic treatment of diazepam (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) produced withdrawal reactions. BR 16-A, a multicomponent herbal preparation shown to reverse the withdrawal reactions to opiates was studied against diazepam induced withdrawal reactions in mice. Acute dose of diazepam (20 mg/kg) produced a decrease in the ambulatory and total activity. However, chronic administration for 21 days produced tolerance and no significant change in the ambulatory and total activity. On abrupt termination of diazepam treatment after 21 days, the animals showed anxiety and excitement as there was an increase in ambulatory and total activity. The withdrawal excitement was highest at 72 hr of the last dose of diazepam. Concomittant administration of BR 16-A (100 and 500 mg/kg) reversed the acute effect of diazepam in a dose dependent manner. Similarly, chronic administration of BR 16-A (100 and 500 mg/kg/day for 21 days) with diazepam (20 mg/kg/day for 21 days) also reversed the withdrawal induced hyperambulation and total activity. Chronic administration of BR 16-A per se had no significant effect on the ambulatory and total activity, however, in acute doses, BR 16-A (100 and 500 mg/kg) produced a dose dependent increase in the ambulatory and total activity. BR 16-A with its CNS profile of activity could be a useful preparation in the management of substances of abuse.",

Other studies have shown that a variety of interventions can reduce prescribing, but these have been restricted to relatively few general practices or patients. We co-ordinated an audit of benzodiazepine prescribing and withdrawal in 15 practices caring for 87,900 patients across a district. In total 3234 patients (37 per 1000 registered patients) were discovered to be taking the drugs at the start of the programme, and 16% of these people stopped taking the drugs by the conclusion of the audit 8 months later. There was no relation between success at benzodiazepine cessation and initial levels of prescribing, nor with practice size. Younger patients were significantly more likely to stop benzodiazepines than those over the age of 65.", 
    "56": "Neuropsychological dysfunction in children and adults with epilepsy is common and has several possible interrelated causes, including the underlying pathophysiology, possible cerebral pathology, the effects of subclinical discharges, sleep disorders, status epilepticus and drug therapy. Of these factors the effects of subclinical discharges and those of medication are potentially remediable. In up to 50% of patients with subclinical epileptiform EEG discharges, these are associated with transitory cognitive impairment. When the discharges are focal, the cognitive deficits usually reflect the normal neuropsychological functions of the affected brain region. Most antiepileptic drugs, with the exception of the benzodiazepines (which themselves adversely affect cognition) and lamotrigine, do not suppress inter-ictal discharges. Although well-designed clinical trials of the effects of antiepileptic drugs are difficult to perform, there is convincing evidence that phenobarbitone and phenytoin cause cognitive impairment. Drugs which control both the seizures and inter-ictal discharges should improve cognitive function, provided the drugs themselves do not have a cognitive penalty. Lamotrigine provides effective control of both overt and subclinical seizures, without adversely affecting cognition.",

Eight of the patients had withdrawal seizures, five had withdrawal symptoms and four patients had no withdrawal problems at all. Ultimately all the patients came off CZP, mainly quite rapidly (3-30 days) with the initial side effects regressing totally in 11 patients.", 
    "58": "The effects of an antagonist at the strychnine insensitive glycine site (5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, i.c.v.), and of noncompetitive (MK-801, i.p.) and competitive (CGP 37849, i.p.; CGP 39551, i.p.; AP-7, i.c.v.) NMDA antagonists were compared with diazepam (i.p.) in two animal models of anxiety (the open field exploratory behavior of non-habituated rats, and the Vogel conflict test). All drugs when applied in appropriate doses increased punished drinking in the Vogel test, without producing any significant changes in free drinking and the stimulus threshold at their lowest anticonflict doses. The effective doses were as follows: diazepam 1.5 and 2.5 mg/kg; MK-801 0.005 and 0.01 mg/kg; CGP 39551 5.0 and 20.0 mg/kg; CGP 37849 1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg; 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid 5.0 microgram (i.c.v.); AP-7 0.5 microgram (i.c.v.). In the open field diazepam (0.05 mg/kg), MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), CGP 37849 (0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mg/kg), and AP-7 2.5 micrograms (i.c.v.) significantly increased exploratory activity in the central sectors of the open field (anti-neophobic reaction), without changing motor activity of the rat. MK-801 at the highest tested dose of 0.2 mg/kg significantly stimulated animal locomotor activity. CGP 37849 in the largest dose examined (10 mg/kg) significantly depressed the motor behavior of rats. Overall, it appeared that different NMDA antagonists showed an anxiolytic-like profile, similar to that of the benzodiazepine diazepam. Among different NMDA receptor complex antagonists studied, CGP 37849 was characterized by the largest distinction between the doses showing an anxiolytic-like action in the open field test, and changing rat motor behavior.", 
    "59": "L. P. Crespi (1942) showed that rats trained to run an alley for a large food reward slowed down when shifted to a small reward. This effect is usually interpreted as an aversive emotional response to reward reduction (A. Amsel, 1958). Benzodiazepines attenuate the behavioral effects of reward reduction (cf. C. F. Flaherty, 1990), but the emphasis has been on their anxiolytic, not memory-impairing, effects. Researchers trained rats (175-200 g) to run an alley for food until asymptote was reached. Reward magnitude was then either decreased (Experiment 1) or increased (Experiment 2). The benzodiazepine midazolam (1 mg/kg ip), injected immediately prior to a decrease or increase in reward magnitude, impaired the later retention of both changes in a manner consistent with anterograde amnesia. The findings suggest that the memory-impairing effects of benzodiazepines may, at least in part, influence the response to reward reduction.", 
    "60": "1. By measuring the binding of N-[3H-methyl]-scopolamine ([3H]-NMS) and of unlabelled subtype-specific muscarinic antagonists, two populations of muscarinic binding sites can be distinguished in the membranes of cardiac ventricles taken from 1-day-old chicks. One of them, corresponding to approximately 80% of [3H]-NMS binding sites, has higher affinities for AF-DX116 (pKi = 6.42) and methoctramine (pKi = 7.33); the rate of [3H]NMS dissociation from these sites is fast. The other population, corresponding to approximately 20% of [3H]-NMS binding sites, has lower affinities for AF-DX116 (pKi = 5.00) and methoctramine (pKi = 6.19); the rate of [3H]-NMS dissociation from these sites is slow. Both populations have high affinities for pirenzepine, but the affinity of the former (major) population is lower (pKi = 7.99) than that of the latter (minor) population (pKi = 10.14). 2. Since it has been shown earlier that two mRNAs for muscarinic receptors are expressed in the chick heart, one of them close to the genetically defined m2 and the other to the m4 subtype, we propose that the major population of binding sites with high affinities for AF-DX116 and methoctramine and the lower affinity for pirenzepine represents the M2-like receptors, while the minor population represents the M4-like receptors. 3. It proved possible to obtain isolated samples of either population by selectively protecting the M2-like sites with AF-DX116 and the M4-like sites with pirenzepine, and by inactivating the unprotected sites with benzilylcholine mustard. The properties of the isolated populations corresponded to those derived from the analysis of [3H]-NMS binding to the original mixed population.4 Alcuronium exerted positive allosteric action on the binding of [3H]-NMS both to the M2-like and the M4-like population and severely slowed down [3H]-NMS dissociation from them; its affinity for the M2-like sites was 3-10 times higher.", 
    "61": "1. Epibatidine is an analgesic substance, isolated from the skin of the poisonous frog Epipedobates tricolor, for which the mechanism of action was previously unknown. 2. The IC50 of synthetic (+)-epibatidine oxalate (the naturally occurring isomer) for [3H]-nicotine binding to rat whole-brain membranes was 0.1 nM. The (-)-isomer also exhibited high affinity (IC50 = 0.2 nM). 3. (+)- and (-)-Epibatidine exhibited much lower affinity for displacement of the muscarinic ligand [3H]-N-methylscopolamine binding to rat cortical membranes (Kapp = 6.9 microM and 16.0 microM respectively). The (+)-enantiomer of epibatidine had an antagonist/agonist (NMS/oxo-M) binding ratio of 4.2 This is consistent with a muscarinic antagonist profile. 4. (+)-Epibatidine oxalate (10 microM) did not cause significant (> 30%) displacement of radioligand binding to opioid, excitatory amino acid, benzodiazepine, 5-HT, dopamine, adrenaline or peptide receptors. 5. (+)- and (-)-Epibatidine (5-20 micrograms kg-1 s.c.) doubled response latency in the mouse hot-plate test. Antinociception and behavioural depression induced by (+)-epibatidine (5 micrograms kg-1) was fully blocked by the nicotinic antagonists mecamylamine (2 mg kg-1 s.c.) or dihydro-beta-erythroidine (2 mg kg-1 s.c.). The muscarinic antagonist scopolamine (0.4 and 10 mg kg-1 s.c.) caused partial reversal of antinociception induced by (+)-epibatidine in mice, but not in rats. 6. These findings demonstrate that (+)-epibatidine oxalate salt is a highly selective and potent nicotinic analgesic agent.", 
    "62": "1. GYKI 52466 is a benzodiazepine derivative that has muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties thought to be mediated by highly selective, noncompetitive antagonism of non-NMDA receptors. However, recent electrophysiological data showed that, in addition to non-NMDA receptors, the GABAA-receptor associated benzodiazepine site is involved in the depressant effect of GYKI 52466 on spinal reflex transmission. In view of the structural similarities between the 2,3 benzodiazepine derivative GYKI 52466 and 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam, the benzodiazepine site of GABAA receptor complex could also be involved in the anticonvulsant activity of GYKI 52466, which has not yet been proven. This prompted us to study the effect of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, on anticonvulsant and adverse effects of GYKI 52466 in different seizure models in mice. The non-NMDA antagonist, NBQX and diazepam were used for comparison. 2. Seizure threshold models for different types of generalized seizures were used. The threshold for maximal (tonic) electroshock seizures (MES) was significantly increased by GYKI 52466 (10-20 mg kg-1), NBQX (80-120 mg kg-1) and diazepam (5 mg kg-1) shortly after i.p. drug administration. The same dose-range of the non-NMDA antagonists also significantly increased the threshold for myoclonic and clonic seizures induced by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), although the magnitude of threshold increases obtained with the respective drugs, differed, at least in part, from that seen in the MES experiments. GYKI 52466 was clearly less potent in increasing PTZ thresholds for myoclonic and clonic seizures than on the MES threshold, while NBQX exerted about the same potency in both models. In contrast to the non-NMDA antagonists, diazepam was capable of increasing themyoclonic and clonic PTZ seizure threshold at much lower doses than the MES threshold. The PTZ threshold for tonic seizures was markedly increased by GYKI 52466, while NBQX and diazepam were clearly less potent in this respect.3. With respect to adverse effects, GYKI 52466 and NBQX induced significant seizure threshold increases in the different seizure models only at doses which caused sedation and ataxia, while diazepam increased the myoclonic and clonic PTZ seizure threshold at doses below those inducing motor impairment.4. Flumazenil (5-20 mg kg-1) antagonized the anticonvulsant and adverse effects of diazepam but not GYKI 52466. Instead, the anticonvulsant effect of GYKI 52466 was potentiated by flumazenil in some experiments. The anticonvulsant activity of NBQX was slightly reduced by flumazenil in the MES model but not in the PTZ test.5. The data indicate that the GABAA receptor-associated benzodiazepine site is not critically involved in anticonvulsant or adverse effects of GYKI 52466. However, both GYKI 52466 and NBQX were unable to increase seizure thresholds at doses below those inducing sedation and motor impairment,thus demonstrating that non-NMDA antagonists lack a selective anticonvulsant action in standard models of generalized seizures.", 
    "63": "1. The contribution of various excitatory amino acid (EAA) receptors (NMDA, AMPA/kainate and metabotropic) in the brain to the development of morphine dependence was examined. This was performed by measuring the severity of the precipitated withdrawal syndrome following chronic subcutaneous (s.c.) morphine and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) EAA antagonist treatment. 2. Continuous subcutaneous (s.c.) treatment with morphine sulphate (36.65 mumol day-1) produced an intense and reliable naloxone-precipitated withdrawal syndrome. 3. Chronic i.c.v. treatment with antagonists selective for metabotropic and NMDA receptors, but not AMPA/kainate receptors, significantly attenuated abstinence symptoms. Conversely, EAA antagonists had very little effect on non-withdrawal behaviours. 4. These results suggest that, as well as changes elicited by activation of NMDA receptors, metabotropic receptors and intracellular changes in the phosphatidylinositol (PI) second-messenger system or the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system, to which EAA metabotropic receptors are linked, may be involved in the development of opioid dependence with chronic morphine treatment.", 
    "64": "1. The aim of this study was to investigate the sensitivity of pain-related potentials used in experimental pain models to the non-specific effects of the tranquilizer diazepam. Pain-related potentials were recorded after painful stimulation of the nasal mucosa with CO2 and after painful stimulation of the tooth pulp. Acoustically evoked potentials were measured in order to compare their sensitivity to the tranquilizer diazepam with the sensitivity of the pain-related potentials. 2. Twenty volunteers participated in this randomised, double-blind, three-fold crossover study. Measurements were obtained before and 20 min after the administration of the drug. Event-related potentials were recorded after painful stimulation of the nasal mucosa with CO2 (two stimulus intensities: 60% v/v and 70% v/v CO2), after painful stimulation of the tooth pulp (two stimulus intensities: 2.2 x and 3.3 x detection threshold), and after non-painful acoustical stimulation of the right ear. The subjects rated the perceived intensity of the painful stimuli by means of a visual analogue scale. In addition the spontaneous EEG was analysed in the frequency domain and the vigilance of the subjects was assessed in a tracking task. 3. Diazepam reduced significantly the amplitudes of the event-related potentials after painful stimulation of the tooth pulp and after acoustical stimulation. In contrast only a small, statistically non-significant reduction could be found after painful stimulation with CO2. The pain ratings of the painful stimuli were not affected by diazepam. Diazepam reduced the performance of the tracking task. A decrease of arousal could be found in the alpha 2-range, whereas in the beta 2 and the theta-range the power density increased under diazepam. 4. We demonstrated that event-related potentials after painful stimulation of the nasal mucosa with CO2 are less affected by the nonspecific effects of the tranquilizer diazepam than event-related potentials after painful stimulation of the tooth pulp. The effects of diazepam on the tracking task, the spontaneous EEG and the event-related potentials clearly confirm its sedative properties. Diazepam had no analgesic effect measurable by pain intensity estimates.",

Intravenous administration of succinylcholine (0.075 mg/kg of body weight) significantly decreased mean absolute pressure in the prostatic and post-prostatic/penile intraurethral segments by -9.5 and -6.5 mm of Hg, respectively (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.0006, respectively). Dantrolene (1.0 mg/kg, IV) significantly decreased mean prostatic and postprostatic/penile intraurethral segmental pressures by -3.5 and -2.8 mm of Hg, respectively (P = 0.005 and P = 0.0181, respectively). Diazepam (0.8 mg/kg, IV) did not significantly alter mean intraurethral segmental pressures. None of the drugs caused a change in segmental lengths of the urethra. These results indicate that skeletal muscle makes a substantial contribution to intraurethral tone in anesthetized, healthy, sexually intact male cats and that skeletal muscle relaxation may be successful in reducing prostatic and post-prostatic/penile urethral segmental tone in male cats. These results also suggest that dantrolene sodium may be valuable for the pharmacologic management of urethral disorders in male cats.", 
    "66": "The effects of diazepam, a long half-life benzodiazepine, midazolam and triazolam, two with short half-life, on the transitional stage between deep slow wave sleep and paradoxical sleep were studied in Wistar and WAG/Rij rats. This intermediate stage is characterized by the unusual association of cortical spindles and low frequency hippocampal theta rhythm. The main result was extension of the intermediate stage at the expense of paradoxical sleep by diazepam and triazolam by influencing only the duration of the intermediate stage and both the onset and maintenance of paradoxical sleep. Midazolam increased both intermediate stage and paradoxical sleep. Several differences in the qualitative modulation of the stage characteristics and between rat strains were found. In regard to the possible peculiar physiological significance of the intermediate stage, we conclude that benzodiazepines promote a transient pharmacological cerveau isol\u00e9-like stage during sleep in rats.", 
    "67": "The aim of the present report was to investigate the influence of pup stimulus properties and female parity on mouse maternal behavior. Outbred CD-1 mouse pups, prenatally exposed to either the vehicle (VEH) or oxazepam (OX, 15 mg/kg twice/day on pregnancy days 12-16) and fostered to untreated dams at birth, were offered as a stimulus on postnatal days 4, 6, and 8 to four groups of females that differed in maternal experience: virgin, experienced virgin females, primiparae, and biparae. Maternal behavior was observed during a 15-min session each day. Virgin females were less involved in crouching behavior than primiparae. Pups, age, and prenatal oxazepam showed interactive effects on maternal care, particularly by increasing licking and nest-building activities and decreasing still-out behavior. Moreover, dams receiving younger pups showed high levels of both locomotor activity and rearing. The present findings point to the need for a better understanding of mother-pup interactions in studies aimed at characterizing drug and toxicant effects on both animal and human development.", 
    "68": "The relative influence of systemically administered morphine, fentanyl, and diazepam on the thresholds of spinal motor reflexes (SMRs), vocalizations elicited during stimulation (VDSs), and vocalization afterdischarges (VADs) was assessed. Responses were elicited by applying graded electric current to the tail. Performance (latency and amplitude) of all three responses was monitored to determine whether elevations in threshold were confounded by performance decrements. All three drugs were found to elevate VAD thresholds more readily than VDS and SMR thresholds. VADs were also most susceptible to the deleterious effects of these drugs on motor performance. Nevertheless, across the dose range of morphine and fentanyl that elevated thresholds of all three responses without disrupting the performance of any response, the order of susceptibility to threshold increases remained VAD, VDS, and SMR. Diazepam also elevated VAD thresholds more readily than VDS thresholds across a dose range that failed to disrupt performance of either response. SMR thresholds were only elevated by diazepam when administered in doses that significantly disrupted performance. Results are discussed in terms of supporting the validity of VADs as a model of the affective-motivational dimension of pain.", 
    "69": "Vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl GABA, GVG) is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-transaminase (GABA-T). This study addressed the question of whether or not the inhibition of GABA-T has an anxiolytic effect in rats. Diazepam (1.5 mg/kg) and GVG (50 and 500 mg/kg) increased the tendency of rats to explore in the elevated plus-maze test, whereas the effect of general locomotor activity was diminished. The sedative effect of GVG (500 mg/kg) was more pronounced 6 h than 2 h after IP administration. The present findings suggest that even a partial inhibition of GABA-T results in a reduction of anxiety measures in a novel environment.", 
    "70": "The effect of convulsive stimulations on the dissipation of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam was investigated using the kindled-convulsion model. Amygdala-kindled rats were rendered tolerant to diazepam's anticonvulsant effect by 25 \"bidaily\" (one/48 h) diazepam injections (2.5 mg/kg), each followed 1 h later by a convulsive stimulation. They were then divided into nine groups for the tolerance-dissipation phase of the experiment. Of the nine groups, three received bidaily control handling for one trial, three trials, or seven trials; three received bidaily saline injections, each 1 h before a convulsive stimulation, for one, three, or seven trials; and three received bidaily diazepam injections, each 1 h after a convulsive stimulation, for one, three, or seven trials. Finally, each rat received a tolerance-retention test (i.e., a diazepam injection followed 1 h later by a convulsive stimulation) 48 h after its last tolerance-dissipation trial. The tolerance dissipated gradually but completely over the 4-, 8-, and 16-day test intervals in the rats that received a convulsive stimulation before each injection during the tolerance-dissipation phase, whether they were injected with saline or diazepam; in contrast, tolerance did not dissipate in the rats that received saline injections but no stimulations. Remarkably, the discontinuance of the bidaily diazepam injections, even for 16 days, was not sufficient to dissipate the tolerance that had developed to diazepam's anticonvulsant effect; nor was the continuation of the bidaily diazepam injections sufficient to keep tolerance from dissipating.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "We carried out a 9-day double-blind clinical trial comparing intramuscular zuclopenthixol acetate with liquid oral haloperidol in the treatment of 40 newly admitted schizophrenic patients with acute exacerbation. A parallel-group design was used with stratification by sex. Zuclopenthixol acetate (50 to 150 mg) was given intramuscularly every 3 days, whereas liquid haloperidol (10 to 30 mg daily) was given orally three times a day, with supplementary doses of each medication given under double-blind conditions when needed for agitation. No other sedative drugs, including benzodiazepines, were administered. The mean daily dose was 18.9 mg for haloperidol as compared with a mean dose per 3 days of 117.6 mg for zuclopenthixol. The two treatments were found to be equally efficacious on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinical Global Impression Scale. Both drugs induced similar extrapyramidal side effects. However, more tremors were associated with zuclopenthixol as was a tendency for tardive dyskinesia to be unmasked at the end of the injection interval. Sedation was higher with zuclopenthixol acetate than with haloperidol. Serum creatinine phosphokinase levels were not significantly increased after zuclopenthixol injections. The results of this trial suggest that zuclopenthixol acetate given intramuscularly every second to third day offers an alternative to conventional liquid oral haloperidol in the management of acute schizophrenia.",

    "76": "Theophylline and benzodiazepines are frequently combined in clinical practice. Because of a number of case reports about antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced sedation by theophylline, we investigated serum alprazolam levels in a convenient sample of pulmonary medicine inpatients receiving theophylline and no theophylline. One mg of alprazolam was given daily for seven days to 6 patients receiving theophylline and 7 patients not receiving theophylline treatment. On days 2 through 7, trough serum alprazolam levels were measured. On day 7, blood samples were collected before (0 hour), and at 3, 6, 9 and 12 hours after alprazolam administration. In patients receiving theophylline, serum trough alprazolam levels were significantly lower during each day of the study. In patients receiving no theophylline, serum alprazolam levels were in the therapeutic range, except for two patients who had high alprazolam levels. In this small study, serum alprazolam levels were found to be consistently below the therapeutic range in patients receiving chronic theophylline treatment. Previously reported antagonism of anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines by theophylline is probably due to the lower serum benzodiazepine levels in these patients.", 
    "77": "This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to evaluate the effects on postoperative pain of the local anesthetic, 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine, sprayed hepatodiaphragmatically under the surgeon's direct view during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Metabolic endocrine responses to surgery (glucose and cortisol) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug requirements were investigated, as well as the presence of nausea, vomiting, and sweating. Local anesthetics or placebo solutions were given as follows. Immediately following the creation of a pneumoperitoneum, surgeons sprayed the first 20 mL of solution (S1), and an additional 20 mL of solution (S2) was sprayed at the end of the operation. Patients were classified into three groups (14 patients per group). Group A received 20 mL of saline during both S1 and S2, group B received 20 mL of saline during S1 and 20 mL of bupivacaine during S2, and group C received 20 mL of bupivacaine during both S1 and S2. The degree of postoperative pain was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS) and the verbal rating scale (VRS) on arrival in the recovery room and subsequently at time intervals of 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h. The results of this study indicate a significant decrease of postoperative pain in patients treated with local anesthetic. VAS and VRS pain scores, as well as respiratory rate and analgesic requirements, were significantly lower in group C. The postoperative plasma cortisol level in group C was significantly lower than in groups A and B.", 
    "78": "The effects of chlordiazepoxide, caffeine and placebo on the contingent negative variation (CNV) in relation to extraversion were investigated in a double-blind study. Forty-four healthy naive volunteers, varying in extraversion scores, took part in the study. The baseline values of the O wave, E wave and average CNV amplitudes decreased significantly in successive experiments for individual subjects. Administration of the drugs caused a change in the amplitude of the O wave from baseline, whereas placebo effects were negligible. For chlordiazepoxide the change was positive at the lower end of the extraversion score and negative at the upper end, while for caffeine the opposite was found. For the individual drugs the correlations with the change in O wave and extraversion score were not significant (P < 0.20 in the case of both drugs). Analysis of the difference in the effect on O wave between the drug and the placebo yielded a significant negative correlation for chlordiazepoxide (P < 0.05) whereas the positive correlation for caffeine was not significant (P < 0.40). The individual differences between the effects of chlordiazepoxide and caffeine on O wave correlated significantly with the extraversion score (P < 0.02). This difference was positive at the lower end of the extraversion score and negative at the upper end. The same trend was found in the case of E wave and average amplitude but not significantly so. This finding supports the hypothesis that CNV is an indicator of the interaction between extraversion and condition.", 
    "79": "Erythromycin is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 [CYP3A4] and has a potentially dangerous interaction with midazolam and triazolam. The possible interaction between erythromycin and a short-acting benzodiazepine, temazepam, was investigated in a double-blind, randomized crossover study. Ten healthy volunteers received 500 mg erythromycin or placebo orally three times a day for 6 days followed by a challenge dose of 20 mg temazepam. Plasma samples were collected for the determination of temazepam, oxazepam, and erythromycin, and psychomotor effects were measured during the 24 h after intake of temazepam. Erythromycin did not change the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of temazepam to a statistically significant degree. The metabolic fate of temazepam and its almost complete bioavailability explain the lack of interaction. Temazepam, unlike midazolam or triazolam, can thus be prescribed in the usual doses for patients receiving erythromycin.", 
    "80": "This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of drug-related hospital admissions in southern Tasmania, Australia. The causes of consecutive admissions to medical wards of the Royal Hobart Hospital were reviewed. Comprehensive data were collected over a 10-week period on 691 admissions (median age: 67 years and range: 11-97 years; 50.8% males). Sixty-eight (9.8%) of the admissions were classified as being either probably or definitely drug-related. Most of these admissions were attributable to intentional overdose (38.2%) or an adverse drug reaction (30.9%). The overdoses often involved benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. Gastrointestinal bleeding related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was the most common adverse drug reaction (38.1% of all reactions). Other drug-related admission categories were poor compliance (14.7%), dosage decrease or therapy cessation by a doctor producing an exacerbation of symptoms (7.4%), substance abuse (4.4%) and drug interaction (4.4%). Patients with a drug-related admission were, on average, younger than the other medical admissions, with no significant difference in gender. Patients admitted due to an overdose or substance abuse were younger than other drug-related admissions and non-drug related admissions. In conclusion, this study has determined that almost 10% of medical admissions to the hospital are drug-related and it is estimated that 40 to 50 elderly people are admitted each year suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding related to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.", 
    "81": "We report our experience with general anaesthesia (GA) supplemented with subarachnoid bupivacaine and morphine for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) in 18 patients. Fifteen patients were male, and mean age was 62 yr. Anaesthesia (GA) was induced with alfentanil 97 +/- 22 micrograms.kg-1 and midazolam 0.04 +/- 0.02 mg.kg-1 supplemented with a muscle relaxant, and maintained with isoflurane (0.25-0.5%) in oxygen throughout surgery. Spinal anaesthesia (SA) was then performed at a lumber level using hyperbaric bupivacaine (23-30 mg) and/or lidocaine (150 mg) with morphine (0.5-1 mg). Pooled data showed the following haemodynamic results (P < 0.05). Induction of GA produced a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Addition of SA produced a decrease in heart rate. Heart rate and MAP did not change with sternotomy. Phenylephrine support of arterial blood pressure was used at some time during operation in 17 patients. Supplementation of GA was minimal. Patients received 2.7 +/- 0.7 coronary grafts. Operating room time was 3.9 +/- 0.6 hr. Postoperative analgesic requirements were minimal, and in half of the patients tracheal extubation occurred on the day of surgery. Complications included one myocardial infarction, one resternotomy, a metabolic encephalopathy in a dialysis-dependent patient, and one case of herpes labialis. No patient recalled intraoperative events. Combined GA with SA may be an effective technique for CABG surgery. Further study of the cardiovascular, neurological and metabolic effects of the technique is required.", 
    "82": "The purpose of this study was to determine the onset times of vecuronium neuromuscular block administered into either the central circulation or a peripheral vein. One hundred and twenty adult patients with a pulmonary artery (PA) catheter were randomly divided into one of three groups with respect to the routes of vecuronium administration (n = 40 in each group). Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 2.5 mg iv and fentanyl 10-50 micrograms.kg-1 iv and maintained with intermittent doses of fentanyl 50 micrograms iv and nitrous oxide 60-70% in oxygen. After immobilization of the forearm in a splint, the ulnar nerve was stimulated supramaximally every 12 sec. The resulting force of the evoked thumb twitch was recorded (Myograph 2000, Biometer, Denmark). The times from the injection to the first depression of twitch response (latent onset) in patients given vecuronium 0.08 mg.kg-1 into the pulmonary artery, the right atrium, and a peripheral vein on the hand were 58.0 +/- 19.5, 71.5 +/- 17.1, and 82.4 +/- 18.0 sec (mean +/- SD), respectively. The latent onset of neuromuscular block occurred sooner in patients given vecuronium into the central vein than when administered into a vein on the hand (P < 0.01). In comparing the patients given vecuronium into the central vein, the onset times to 95% twitch depression (onset) were 152.3 +/- 40.7 and 168.2 +/- 35.5 sec.

    "83": "The authors studied the efficacy and cost of substituting sedation using midazolam and alfentanil for the existing regimen of diazepam and meperidine in patients requiring upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Sixty consenting subjects were randomized to receive either meperidine 50 mg with diazepam approximately 90 micrograms.kg-1 (Group D) or alfentanil 250 micrograms with midazolam approximately 50 micrograms.kg-1 (Group M). Endoscope insertion time, patient acceptance, apnoeic or desaturation episodes were noted by a physician observer. Pulse oximetry was used to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) during endoscopy. Subjects performed four-choice reaction time (4CRT) tests before, 30 and 60 min after endoscopy, and were assessed for nausea or dizziness and their ability to stand and walk. During endoscopy, insertion time was shorter (84 +/- 45 sec vs 122 +/- 83 sec, P < 0.03) and fewer aversive movements occurred (0.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.7 +/- 2.4, P < 0.005) in Group M than Group D. No subject in either group suffered any apnoea or prolonged desaturation requiring supplemental oxygen. Irrespective of treatment group, greater decreases in SpO2 (6.1 +/- 3.4% vs 3.6 +/- 2.2% P < 0.001) occurred in subjects > 45 yr of age than in subjects < or = 45 yr. During recovery 4CRT values at 30 min after endoscopy were longer (723 +/- 226 msec vs 594 +/- 139 msec, P < 0.005) in Group M than in Group D but not after 60 min. It was concluded that the small differences in endoscopy conditions and greater sedation during the first 30 min of recovery did not justify the additional cost of using midazolam and alfentnil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "84": "The relationship between benzodiazepine and regular amphetamine use was examined in a sample of 301 regular amphetamine users. Benzodiazepine use was widespread, with 37% of subjects having used them in the month preceding interview, and 55% in the preceding 6 months. Injectors of amphetamines were more likely to have ever used, and to be currently using, benzodiazepines. Comparisons of benzodiazepine users with other subjects indicated that benzodiazepine users had higher levels of polydrug use and psychopathology, as well as poorer health and social functioning than non-users. The odds of benzodiazepine using injectors having injected with a borrowed used needle in the preceding month were 3.8 times of those of non-benzodiazepine-using injectors. These results are consistent with studies of other groups of illicit drug users, such as heroin users, in indicating that benzodiazepine use is associated with greater levels of risk and psycho-social dysfunction.", 
    "85": "Acute effects of alcohol and diazepam on reaction time (RT) and event-related potential (ERP) measures were examined in 108 healthy male volunteers. The subjects engaged in a simple RT task at two levels of stimulus intensity during baseline and treatment sessions. Lower stimulus intensity produced increased RT's, increased ERP peak latencies, and suppression of peak amplitudes. Moderate and high doses of alcohol, and high doses of diazepam produced increased RT's. Alcohol suppressed P100 and N100 amplitudes, while diazepam suppressed P100 amplitudes only. P100 amplitudes were correlated to RT's under baseline and treatment conditions. These results were taken as evidence for impaired stimulus detection during alcohol and diazepam intoxication, with both drugs influencing sensory-perceptual processes and alcohol alone influencing the degree of attentiveness.", 
    "86": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a serious adverse reaction of neuroleptic drug therapy, composed of mental status changes, muscular rigidity, hyperthermia, signs of autonomic instability and typical laboratory findings. The syndrome has received increased attention in the scientific literature since 1980; nevertheless some weighty issues regarding clinical symptoms, etiopathogenesis and treatment require additional studies. This paper presents 9 cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome prospectively observed in 8 inpatients and 1 outpatient with different psychiatric diagnosis. Levenson's diagnostic criteria were fulfilled in 7 cases; the remaining two had slighter symptoms. So neuroleptic malignant syndrome is to be considered a rare but not unusual side effect of neuroleptics. The risk of syndrome doesn't seem to be correlated with chemical class, D2 receptor affinity and total dosage of neuroleptics; a key factor seems instead to be a quick loading rate of neuroleptics. Seven of 9 cases displayed severe changes in mental status (clouding of consciousness that varies from stupor to coma), violent psychomotor excitement and aggressiveness before the onset of the syndrome. Such clinical features seem themselves, in our experience, to be potential risk factors besides reason for an increase of neuroleptic dosage. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually is preceded by prodromal signs, the most important appearing the worsening of alterations in consciousness. Symptoms of neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually appear abruptly and in some cases with a dramatic course; they last, in cases with favourable outcome, a few days to two weeks from neuroleptic withdrawal; by far the worst outcome, instead, occurs if diagnosis and drug discontinuation are not carried out early. The first measure in the treatment of neuroleptic malignant syndrome consists of prompt discontinuation of all neuroleptic medications and other psychopharmacological cures, except for benzodiazepines, and institution of supportive therapy; such interventions can resolve the most of cases. Three patients treated with bromocriptine and/or dantrolene didn't display a different duration of clinical symptoms and rate of complications if compared to patients treated with supportive therapy only. Use of bromocriptine or dantrolene, or both, therefore should be considered as a second line of action. In four cases, neuroleptics were reintroduced within few days of recovery; low potency neuroleptics were employed, given low doses which gradually increased: in none of the 4 cases did the patients experience partial or complete recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.", 
    "87": "Tonic GABAergic inhibition in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) has been shown to regulate a constellation of behavioral and physiological responses that resemble a human panic attack. The present study was aimed at testing if the panic-like response elicited by injecting gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonists into the DMH can be blocked by pretreating the animals with the antipanic drugs, imipramine and clonazepam. Rats were fitted with arterial catheters and bilateral chronic microinjection cannulae in the DMH. Their baseline heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure and \"anxiety\" (measured by the social interaction test) responses to injection of the GABAA antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) into the DMH were recorded. After treatment in a double-blind manner with vehicle, imipramine (5 and 15 mg/kg, 7 days), and clonazepam (5 mg/kg, 3 days), the response to BMI microinjection into the DMH was once again recorded. Both imipramine and clonazepam, but not vehicle treatments blocked the BMI response.", 
    "88": "Electroencephalographic slow-wave activity (SWA; power density in the 0.75 to 4.5 Hz band) and spindle frequency activity (SFA; 11.25 to 15.0 Hz) exhibit a typical time course and a distinct mutual relationship during sleep. Because benzodiazepines (BDZ) suppress SWA and enhance SFA, we investigated the effect of two BDZ-receptor agonists on the dynamics of these EEG parameters. A single dose of midazolam (15 mg), zopiclone (7.5 mg), or placebo was administered before bedtime to healthy young men. Although the two drugs reduced SWA and enhanced SFA, their time course across and within sleep cycles as well as their mutual relationship were little affected. The results constitute further evidence that hypnotics acting as BDZ-receptor agonists do not substantially interfere with the homeostatic aspect of sleep regulation.",

    "90": "The New Zealand Myrtacea Leptospermum scoparium Forst. contains lipophilic flavonoids which interact specifically with benzodiazepine receptors. For an indepth characterization of their binding behavior, structure activity relationships were delineated which are in accord with results obtained by quantum-chemical and spectroscopic methods. Inhibition experiments have been performed by a radio receptor assay with [3H]flunitrazepam and IC50-values of 2.1 microM for 5,7-dimethoxyflavone (1), 45 microM for 5,7-dimethoxy-6-methylflavone (2), 3.3 microM for 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6-methylflavone (3) and 40 microM for 5-hydroxy-7-methoxy-6,8-dimethylflavone (4) have been measured. Flavanones 5 to 8, however, at concentrations < or = 0.1 mM, did not show a 50% inhibition of the binding radiolignand. The agonistic profile of the flavones was determined indirectly by TBPS-shift experiments which revealed a negative cooperation with the TBPS/picrotoxinin-binding site. To characterize the biologically active conformations, energy minima were calculated using the semiempirical method AM1. The steric arrangement of the substituents for all global minima calculated were in accord with homonuclear NOE-experiments. A correlation of the geometry of the lowest energy conformers with corresponding IC50-values reveals an increase of the affinity towards the benzodiazepine receptor, when the substituents at the flavones are coplanar to the aromatic system and R3 represents a sterically demanding methylgroup. Analyses of the global minima of 5,7-Dimethoxyflavone and diazepam showed one conformer each, in which the methoxy substituent in R3 and the N-methyl on the one hand and the corresponding carbonyl oxygens as well as the unsubstituted phenyl rings on the other were nearly superimposable. The flavanones lacking the double bond between C-2 and C-3 have angular structures, whereby the loss of affinity to the receptor can be explained. From the locomotion study with rats, an in vivo sedating, possibly even anxiolytic effect of the dry extract of the tincture prepared from Leptospermum scoparium by use of 70% ethanol, could be concluded. At doses of 50 mg and 250 mg of the dry extract per kg of body weight, an unequivocal but not linear dose-activity relationship in respect to the moving activities of the animals was determined. Upon an application of 500 mg of this extract per kg body weight, by contrast, only a negligible reduction of the moving activity was found in relation to a control group. We suppose that at higher doses, activating compounds of the extract come to the fore pharmacologically neutralizing the primarily sedating effect.", 
    "91": "Midazolam was administered as a premedicant to 90 patients aged from 20 to 55 years with ASA status 1 or 2. The patients were divided into 3 groups: group I 10 mg orally, group II 20 mg orally, group III 5 mg intramuscularly. All premedications were given 30 minutes before entering the operating room. The perioperative effects of midazolam on blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate and SpO2 as well as sedative, hypnotic and amnemonic effects were evaluated in these patients. There were no remarkable changes in the blood pressure, pulse rate or respiratory rate. There was no problem on the upper airway tract, but a slight decrease in SpO2 was observed in a few patients. In this study, sedative and hypnotic effects were almost satisfactory. Midazolam produced significant anterograde amnesia, and the amnemonic rate was 66.7% in group I and 86.7% in group II and III. In conclusion, oral midazolam is an effective preanesthetic medication in adult.", 
    "92": "Norepinephrine (NE) release in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) of rats was studied during immobilization using an intracerebral microdialysis technique. A series of experiments using pharmacological and physiological manipulations indicated that the NE recovered in the medial PFC dialysate was mainly derived from nerve terminals and that the dorsal noradrenergic bundle was a major source of NE in the medial PFC. Immobilization stress immediately elevated NE levels to 176.0 +/- 9.0% of basal release, and this increase continued for the entire period of stress and 20 min after termination of the stress. Preinjection of a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (5 mg/kg ip), significantly attenuated immobilization-induced NE release, while injection of an anxiogenic compound, FG-7142 (20 mg/kg ip), facilitated NE release in an obviously nonstressed condition. These results therefore suggest that stressful stimuli activate the NE system in the medial PFC, which may be modulated by an activation of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain.", 
    "93": "It was the aim of the present study to characterize the modulatory effect of muscarinic agonists on the overflow of norepinephrine and neuropeptide Y (NPY) from the in situ perfused guinea pig heart, induced by electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion (6 Hz, 5 V, 1 min). The muscarinic agonists oxotremorine (0.01-1 microM) and carbachol (0.1-10 microM) reduced norepinephrine and NPY overflow in a concentration-dependent manner to approximately 30% of control. The inhibitory effect of carbachol was antagonized by the unspecific muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 microM) but not by the nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium (100 microM). The M2-specific antagonist AF-DX-116BS was 25 times more potent than the M1-specific antagonist pirenzepine in antagonizing the inhibitory effect of carbachol [50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 0.2 microM for AF-DX-116BS; IC50 = 5.0 microM for pirenzepine]. These findings indicate that presynaptic muscarinic inhibition of stimulated norepinephrine and NPY release from the guinea pig heart is mediated mainly by activation of M2 receptors. As early as 2 min after stop-flow ischemia, the inhibitory effect of carbachol (10 microM) on the stimulation-evoked overflow of norepinephrine and NPY was lost.

Experiments were designed to determine whether ingested polyamines induce change in intestinal motility associated with a cholecystokinin (CCK) release and whether endogenous polyamines are involved in the intestinal and colonic motor response to a meal. Intestinal and colonic motility was assessed in rats equipped with intestinal electrodes, and plasma CCK was determined using a bioassay. Orogastric administration of putrescine, spermidine, or spermine (20 mumol) disrupted intestinal migrating myoelectric complexes (MMCs) and increased the frequency of colonic spike bursts. After a 6-day treatment with the ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor alpha-difluoromethylornithine, the duration of postprandial disruption of MMCs, but not the stimulation of colonic motility, induced by a 3-g meal was significantly reduced. The duration of MMC disruption and the increase in colonic spike burst frequency after spermidine administration (20 mumol) were significantly reduced by CCK-A and CCK-B antagonists. Eight minutes after saline administration plasma CCK concentration was 0.9 +/- 0.4 pM; it rose to 4.7 +/- 2.8 pM, 8 min after spermidine (20 mumol). These results indicate that exogenous polyamines disrupt intestinal MMCs and stimulate colonic motility through a release of CCK acting at CCK-A and CCK-B receptors and suggest that endogenous polyamines are involved in the postprandial control of intestinal motility.", 
    "95": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an 18-kDa protein present in the outer mitochondrial membrane. The human PBR can be labeled with the benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 and with the isoquinoline carboxamide PK11195. The two ligands compete with each other in binding experiments, with previous results suggesting overlapping but not identical binding sites. To define the regions of the receptor interacting with PK11195 and Ro5-4864 and to address the question of the topology of the molecule in the membrane, we generated mutant human PBRs with amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions and with point mutations in potentially accessible cytoplasmic regions. The mutant genes were expressed in yeast and analyzed in binding experiments using radiolabeled PK11195 and Ro5-4864. The results showed that, whereas deletions in the amino-terminal sequence had marked consequences for the binding affinity of both ligands, the final 13 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus could be deleted with no effect on the binding of either Ro5-4864 or PK11195. The site-directed mutagenesis experiments pinpointed four amino acids as participating in the binding site of Ro5-4864. Three of these, Glu-29, Arg-32, and Lys-39, which are located in the first putative cytoplasmic loop, are conserved in human, bovine, rat, and mouse PBRs. The remaining residue, Val-154, which is found at the interface between the putative fifth transmembrane region and the cytoplasm, is present in the human, rat, and mouse sequences but is replaced by methionine in the bovine sequence. The exchange of Met-154 for valine in the bovine PBR introduced a binding site for Ro5-4864, which is absent in the native PBR. These four amino acids played a minor role, if any, in the binding site of PK11195. We also showed that the histidines previously suggested to be part of the binding site of PK11195 are not directly involved in the interaction of the human receptor with either PK11195 or Ro5-4864.", 
    "96": "Chronic exposure to benzodiazepines can result in an \"uncoupling\" of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors and benzodiazepine receptors (BzR) both in primary neuronal cell cultures and in vivo. The effect of chronic exposure to BzR ligands was examined in an engineered cell line (WSS-1) stably expressing \"type I\" GABAA receptors. Chronic exposure to flurazepam produced a concentration- (EC50, approximately 1.1 microM after a 48-hr exposure) and time-dependent (t1/2, approximately 3 hr at 100 microM) reduction in the efficacy (Emax) of GABA to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding to BzR, a characteristic of uncoupling in native GABAA receptor isoforms. Uncoupling of GABAA receptors and BzR without concomitant changes in BzR density was also produced by chronic exposure to other, structurally diverse, BzR ligands, including Ro 15-1788 and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, but was not manifested after exposure to the 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake blocker fluoxetine. Chronic (12-48-hr) exposure to flurazepam did not remarkably alter levels of alpha 1 and gamma 2 mRNAs, which constitute GABAA receptors in this cell line. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that uncoupling of GABAA receptors and BzR in this engineered cell line can proceed without the elaboration of additional novel subunits and could involve either post-translational modification of GABAA receptor proteins or changes in subunit stoichiometry.",

    "104": "Hippocampal rhythmical slow activity (RSA) can be elicited by stimulation of the midbrain reticular formation. Buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and imipramine are all anxiolytic and have all been shown to decrease the frequency of RSA. All these compounds have been suggested to affect, directly or indirectly, 5-HT metabolism and function. The present experiments tested the possibility that buspirone, chlordiazepoxide and imipramine reduce RSA frequency via 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Rats received buspirone (10 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and imipramine (30 mg/kg) after 5-HT depletion with p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA, 100 mg/kg/day for 3 days or 350 mg/kg/day for 2 days) or after pretreatment with 5-HTP (40 mg/kg, to replete 5-HT) as well as pCPA. The frequency-reducing effects produced by buspirone and chlordiazepoxide were unchanged by either dose of pCPA, whereas the frequency-reducing effect of imipramine was completely eliminated by the high dose of pCPA. Pindolol, but not beta-blockers (a combination of metoprolol and ICI118,551), was able to block the effect of imipramine on RSA frequency. Pindolol has been reported to block the effects of buspirone but not chlordiazepoxide. These data suggest that: (1) buspirone obtains its frequency-reducing effects via pre- or post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors rather than 5-HT1A autoreceptors; (2) chlordiazepoxide obtains its frequency-reducing effect via benzodiazepine receptors and GABA with no direct or indirect involvement of 5-HT systems; and (3) imipramine obtains its frequency-reducing effect by increasing the availability of 5-HT at 5-HT1A receptors which are not autoreceptors.", 
    "105": "Injections of acetylcholine (ACh) into the lateral septal area (LSA) caused blood pressure increases in unanesthetized freely moving rats. ACh was injected in the dose range of 0.1-54 nmol/500 nl using regular metal needles (200 microns o.d.). In the LSA, injections of carbachol or ACh (2.5 nmol/500 nl) were equipotent (+22 +/- 2 and +19 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively) suggesting the existence of an ACh-sensitive pressor site in the LSA. Maximum responses to ACh injected either intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or into the LSA were not significantly different (+23 +/- 1 and +21 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively). However, the ED50 for the injection into the LSA (0.24 nmol) was significantly lower than that observed after i.c.v. injection (2.6 nmol), ruling out a possible leakage of ACh from the LSA and into the ventricular space. This idea is supported by data showing that the effect of the intraseptal injection of 30 nmol of ACh was blocked by pretreatment with 3 nmol of atropine either i.c.v. or into the LSA, whereas the effects of i.c.v. ACh were completely blocked by i.c.v. atropine, but only partially (42%) when atropine was injected into the LSA. The idea of the existence of an ACh-sensitive site in the LSA is further supported by the more direct observation that injections of 30 nmol/100 nl of ACh into the LSA using glass needles (50-70 microns o.d.) caused similar pressor responses. Neither the i.v. pretreatment with pentolinium or adrenalectomy affected the response to 30 nmol/500 nl of ACh injected into the LSA, ruling out the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "106": "Neuroactive steroids are a new class of steroids that do not interact with any of the classical cytosolic hormonal steroid receptors. The most well-documented examples are those that interact with the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor/chloride channel complex in the central nervous system. The GABAA receptors are known to contain allosteric modulatory sites for therapeutically useful drugs such as benzodiazepines (BZs) and barbiturates. The interaction of neuroactive steroids with the GABAA receptor is specific to a site on the receptor complex distinct from the benzodiazepine and barbiturate modulatory sites. Neuroactive steroids exist endogenously; the examples are metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnane-20-one, and 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha, 21 alpha-dihydroxy-20-one, respectively, and their 5 beta stereoisomers. The GABAA receptor agonist-like effects that these neuroactive steroids produce in vivo are similar, but not identical, to those of BZs and barbiturates. Representatives of all three classes of modulators are active as sedative-hypnotics, anticonvulsants, and anxiolytics in animal models. Because of the heterogeneity of GABAA receptors and their differential distribution in the brain, dissimilar in vivo pharmacological profiles displayed by BZs, barbiturates and neuroactive steroids are not surprising. Studies of neuroactive steroid interactions with the GABAA receptor revealed a unique subset of these steroids that modulate the receptor with limited efficacy. Another endogenously occurring progesterone metabolite, 5 alpha-pregnane-3 alpha,20 alpha-diol, is an example of this subset of neuroactive steroids. At present, it is not clear whether the observed limited efficacy is due to receptor subtype selectivity, partial agonist activity or both.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "107": "Progesterone (P) in both the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is necessary to facilitate sexual receptivity in estrogen-primed hamsters. The mechanism of P may be different in the VMH and VTA, as there are many intracellular progestin receptors (PR) in the VMH but few in the VTA. Progesterone conjugated to bovine serum albumin (P-3-BSA) does not bind well to intracellular PR or permeate the surface of neuronal membranes. However, VTA application of P-3-BSA rapidly increases sexual receptivity if P has been applied earlier to the VMH. P-3-BSA is ineffective when applied to the VMH. The membrane-limited effect of P may be related to the ability of some progestins to modulate the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex (GBRC). We have found that infusions of a GABAA agonist, muscimol, into the VTA enhance and a GABAA antagonist, bicuculline, inhibit receptivity. Because P itself is not highly effective at the GBRC, and since the most potent modulators of the GBRC, the 5 alpha-reduced progestins, do not bind well to PRs, progestin metabolites were applied to the VTA. Only the potent GBRC modulators facilitated sexual receptivity when applied to the VTA concurrent with P to the VMH. The reverse treatment, with a progestin metabolite implanted into the VMH, was ineffective. VTA infusions of an inhibitor of 5 alpha-reductase also attenuated behavioral estrus in hamsters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

For more than 400 frequently used drugs therapeutic and, if data were available, toxic and fatal plasma concentrations as well as elimination half-lives were compiled in a table including, e.g., hypnotics like barbiturates and benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants, sedatives, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, antihistamines, anti-epileptics, beta-adrenergic antagonists, antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, gyrase inhibitors), diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, anti-arrhythmics, anti-asthmatics, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, opioid agonists, and local anaesthetics. Data have been abstracted from published information, both compilations and primary sources, and supplemented with data collected in our own forensic and clinical toxicology laboratories. Wherever possible, ranges for therapeutic plasma concentrations are expressed as trough concentration at steady-state. The range of (or single) half-life values given for each drug are chosen to represent the terminal log-linear phase at most. In addition to the assessment of significance of drug levels for the therapeutic monitoring of patients, this list can assist the diagnostic assessment in cases of intoxication.",

Psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions should be administered concurrently if pharmacotherapy is needed. When psychotropic medication is called for, the agent of choice should be that which results in the least amount of autonomic nervous system toxicity and sedation. Short half-life benzodiazepines in low doses are generally the best options for elderly patients in need of psychotropic medication. Unlike benzodiazepines with longer half-lives, they cause no metabolite accumulation and have a lower potential for toxicity.",

    "112": "The rat in-situ perfused liver model was used to investigate the effect of three H2-receptor antagonists on the pharmacokinetic disposition of the short-acting benzodiazepine, midazolam. Perfusion experiments, using standard techniques, were carried out on four groups (one control and three H2-receptor antagonist-treated groups) of male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-350 g). All animals received midazolam 1 mg; the three treated groups received cimetidine (8 mg), ranitidine (3 mg) or famotidine (0.4 mg). Perfusate and bile samples were collected and assayed for midazolam using gas chromatography. The perfusate data indicated that midazolam disposition was impaired at 10, 50 and 60 min of the experimental period following the addition of cimetidine, whereas ranitidine and famotidine produced an effect at 10 min only; midazolam levels in bile were not affected by the presence of an H2-receptor antagonist. It was concluded that the limited inhibitory effect of cimetidine may be attributed to its lack of specificity for CYP3A, the isoenzyme responsible for the metabolism of midazolam."
