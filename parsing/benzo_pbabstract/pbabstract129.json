Ovariectomized diabetic rats were divided into two groups: one group received daily estrogen replacement (30 mug 17beta-estradiol/kg body weight) and the other group received a vehicle. Each group was further divided into three subgroups and orally given either a placebo, risperidone (0.5 mg/kg body weight), or olanzapine (2 mg/kg body weight) each day in conjunction with a high-fat diet for eight weeks. Ovariectomy reduced serum prolactin levels, while risperidone and estrogen replacement increased them. Olanzapine, not risperidone, increased body weight gain and epididymal fats, and impaired glucose tolerance in ovariectomized diabetic rats, while estrogen replacement improved them. This was related to changes in insulin secretion capacity. Ovariectomized rats had decreased beta-cell mass, due to decreasing beta-cell proliferation, compared with Sham rats, and olanzapine, but not risperidone, caused further reduction. Olanzapine reduced IRS2 protein levels in the islets of ovariectomized rats. Decreased IRS2 attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt and, subsequently, PDX-1 protein levels were lowered in olanzapine-treated rats. Estrogen replacement activated insulin/IGF-1 signaling regardless of treatment. In conclusion, olanzapine, but not risperidone, exacerbated glucose homeostasis partly by attenuating beta-cell function and mass in ovariectomized diabetic rats, while estrogen replacement reversed its negative impact. Further human studies are needed to support the claim that olanzapine should be avoided in the treatment of schizophrenic postmenopausal patients with diabetes.", 
    "1": "Abnormal behaviors and death associated with the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) have emerged as a major issue in influenza patients taking the drug. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of oseltamivir on the behavior of mice using light-dark and open-field preference tests. Oseltamivir (75 and 150 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) alone affected neither time spent in the open area in the light-dark preference test nor ambulation in the open-field test at 2h post-injection. However, a non-selective adenosine A(1)/A(2) receptor antagonist, caffeine (10mg/kg, i.p.) in combination with oseltamivir (150 mg/kg, i.p.) increased time spent in the open area in the light-dark preference test. This enhancement was not inhibited by a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (10-20mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.)). Enhancement of ambulation in the open-field test was also observed when caffeine (10mg/kg, i.p.) was combined with oseltamivir (150 mg/kg, i.p.). This enhancement was inhibited by a dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist, haloperidol (0.1mg/kg, s.c.). Furthermore, an adenosine A(2) receptor antagonist, SCH58261 (3mg/kg, i.p.) in combination with oseltamivir (150 mg/kg, i.p.) increased ambulation in the open-field test, while an adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist, DPCPX (1-3mg/kg, i.p.) did not. These findings suggest that the actions of oseltamivir may involve the dopamine and adenosine systems. Our findings suggest that due to the interaction between central blockade of adenosine A(2) receptors by caffeine, and oseltamivir-induced behavioral changes, patients being treated with oseltamivir should be closely monitored.", 
    "2": "Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) has many actions critical to maintaining mammalian CNS function. It is therefore significant that levels of ApoD have been shown to be altered in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia, suggesting a role for ApoD in the pathophysiology of the disorder. There is also a large body of evidence that cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems are affected by the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, we decided to use in vitro radioligand binding and autoradiography to measure levels of ionotropic glutamate, some muscarinic and serotonin 2A receptors in the CNS of ApoD(-/-) and isogenic wild-type mice. These studies revealed a 20% decrease (mean+/-SEM: 104+/-10.2 vs. 130+/-10.4 fmol/mg ETE) in the density of kainate receptors in the CA 2-3 of the ApoD(-/-) mice. In addition there was a global decrease in AMPA receptors (F(1,214)=4.67, p<0.05) and a global increase in muscarinic M2/M4 receptors (F(1,208)=22.77, p<0.0001) in the ApoD(-/-) mice that did not reach significance in any single cytoarchitectural region. We conclude that glutamatergic pathways seem to be particularly affected in ApoD(-/-) mice and this may contribute to the changes in learning and memory, motor tasks and orientation-based tasks observed in these animals, all of which involve glutamatergic neurotransmission.", 
    "3": "Seven new 1,3-diazepinium chlorides exhibiting some structural similarities to the 1,4-benzodiazepines were synthesized. In a Hippocratic screen using mice, three of these salts, 3-methoxy-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8a), 3-methoxy-9-methyl-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8c) and 3-methoxy-11-methyl-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8e) were examined for their effect on the central nervous system, and their activities compared to that of diazepam. On their own, salts 8a, 8c and 8e solicited no sedative effects on the behaviour of the animals. However, they elicited significant effects in combination with diazepam on diazepam-induced activities such as decreased motor activity, ataxia and loss of righting reflex. Compounds 8a and 8c were fitted into the pharmacophore/receptor model developed by Cook et al. with interaction at the L(1), H(1) and A(2) sites indicating that they are potential inverse agonists of the Bz receptor. The compounds displayed some affinity for the alpha1 isoform of the GABA(A)/BzR (L(Di) interaction) but are non-selective for alpha5 (no L(2) interaction). Results of binding affinity studies showed that compound 8a is mildly selective for the alpha1 receptor although not very potent (K(i)=746.5nM). The significant potentiation of diazepam-induced ataxia and decreased motor activity by compounds 8a and 8c in the Hippocratic screen may be associated with alpha1 selectivity.", 
    "4": "Increasing evidence indicates that sleep deprivation (SD) alters responses to pharmacological agents by affecting specific transmitter systems. The present work addressed deficits in passive avoidance (PA) performance that are seen after SD, and investigated whether treatment with the inverse benzodiazepine agonist beta-CCM could prevent such deficits. Male Wistar rats were deprived of sleep for 96 h using the platform method (SD group), or were sleep deprived and then allowed to recover sleep for 24h (SR group). Animals were treated with saline or 0.5mg/kg beta-CCM before PA training, and were tested 30 min or 24h later. A separate set of animals was sacrificed for [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding analysis. beta-CCM increased PA performance in control animals in both short and long term retention tests, whereas SD and SR animals were unaffected by the drug treatment. Interestingly, [(3)H]Ro 15-4513 binding was reduced in the entorhinal cortex in both SD and SR groups. These findings suggest that the lack of promnesic effects of beta-CCM after SD and SR may be associated with benzodiazepine receptor downregulation in specific brain regions related to memory formation.", 
    "5": "We have previously proposed that the heterogeneous collapse of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) during ischemia and reperfusion contributes to arrhythmogenesis through the formation of metabolic sinks in the myocardium, wherein clusters of myocytes with uncoupled mitochondria and high K(ATP) current levels alter electrical propagation to promote reentry. Single myocyte studies have also shown that cell-wide DeltaPsi(m) depolarization, through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced ROS release mechanism, can be triggered by global depletion of the antioxidant pool with diamide, a glutathione oxidant. Here we examine whether diamide causes mitochondrial depolarization and promotes arrhythmias in normoxic isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. We also investigate whether stabilization of DeltaPsi(m) with a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (4'-chlorodiazepam; 4-ClDzp) prevents the formation of metabolic sinks and, consequently, precludes arrhythmias. Oxidation of the GSH pool was initiated by treatment with 200 microM diamide for 35 min, followed by washout. This treatment increased GSSG and decreased both total GSH and the GSH/GSSG ratio. All hearts receiving diamide transitioned from sinus rhythm into ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation during the diamide exposure: arrhythmia scores were 5.5+/-0.5; n=6 hearts. These arrhythmias and impaired LV function were significantly inhibited by co-administration of 4-ClDzp (64 microM): arrhythmia scores with diamide+4-ClDzp were 0.4+/-0.2 (n=5; P<0.05 vs. diamide alone). Imaging DeltaPsi(m) in intact hearts revealed the heterogeneous collapse of DeltaPsi(m) beginning 20 min into diamide, paralleling the timeframe for the onset of arrhythmias. Loss of DeltaPsi(m) was prevented by 4-ClDzp treatment, as was the increase in myocardial GSSG. These findings show that oxidative stress induced by oxidation of GSH with diamide can cause electromechanical dysfunction under normoxic conditions. Analogous to ischemia-reperfusion injury, the dysfunction depends on the mitochondrial energy state. Targeting the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor can prevent electrical and mechanical dysfunction in both models of oxidative stress.", 
    "6": "Generalized and persistent anxiety, accompanied by nervousness and other symptoms (Generalised Anxiety Disorder, GAD) is frequent in the general population and leads to benzodiazepine usage. Unfortunately, these substances induce sedation and have a high potential for drug abuse, and there is thus a need for alternatives. As the anxiolytic properties of lavender have already been demonstrated in pharmacological studies and small-scale clinical trials, it was postulated that lavender has a positive effect in GAD. A controlled clinical study was then performed to evaluate the efficacy of silexan, a new oral lavender oil capsule preparation, versus a benzodiazepine. In this study, the efficacy of a 6-week-intake of silexan compared to lorazepam was investigated in adults with GAD. The primary target variable was the change in the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A-total score) as an objective measurement of the severity of anxiety between baseline and week 6. The results suggest that silexan effectively ameliorates generalized anxiety comparable to a common benzodiazepine (lorazepam). The mean of the HAM-A-total score decreased clearly and to a similar extent in both groups (by 11.3+/-6.7 points (45%) in the silexan group and by 11.6+/-6.6 points (46%) in the lorazepam group, from 25+/-4 points at baseline in both groups). During the active treatment period, the two HAM-A subscores \"somatic anxiety\" (HAM-A subscore I) and \"psychic anxiety\" (HAM-A subscore II) also decreased clearly and to a similar extent in both groups. The changes in other subscores measured during the study, such as the SAS (Self-rating Anxiety Scale), PSWQ-PW (Penn State Worry Questionnaire), SF 36 Health survey Questionnaire and Clinical Global Impressions of severity of disorder (CGI item 1, CGI item 2, CGI item 3), and the results of the sleep diary demonstrated comparable positive effects of the two compounds. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that silexan is as effective as lorazepam in adults with GAD. The safety of silexan was also demonstrated. Since lavender oil showed no sedative effects in our study and has no potential for drug abuse, silexan appears to be an effective and well tolerated alternative to benzodiazepines for amelioration of generalised anxiety.", 
    "7": "Our objective was to determine if chronic treatment with the non-competitive AMPA antagonist talampanel is efficacious and safe in subjects with ALS. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of nine months treatment duration was conducted in 59 subjects with ALS, with 40 subjects receiving talampanel 50 mg p.o. t.i.d, and 19 subjects receiving placebo. Primary outcome measure was rate of decline in isometric arm strength (as measured by change in arm strength megaslope of the Tufts Quantitative Neuromuscular Exam (TQNE)). Other efficacy endpoints included rate of decline in respiratory function, isometric leg strength, bulbar function, fine motor function, the ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS), and survival. Secondary safety outcome measures were frequency of adverse events, neurological status, plasma concentration of talampanel, vital signs, routine laboratory tests, and electrocardiograms. Decline in muscle strength was 15% less in talampanel treated subjects, and decline in ALSFRS was 30% slower in talampanel treated subjects. Talampanel was safe in subjects with ALS. Mortality rates (8% talampanel, 5% placebo) and drug discontinuation rates (25% talampanel, 16% placebo) were similar in active treatment and placebo groups. Dizziness and somnolence occurred significantly more often in talampanel treated subjects. Although no efficacy measure reached statistical significance, there was a repeated trend toward slower decline in ALSFRS and isometric muscle strength in talampanel treated subjects. Talampanel was well tolerated in subjects with ALS. Although certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the active treatment group, the rate of subject drop-out after nine months did not exceed that seen in other trials. These findings provide strong support for a phase III trial to determine the efficacy of talampanel in subjects with ALS.", 
    "8": "We present a 20-year-old previously healthy male who suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen and underwent multiple surgeries because of abdominal abscess and fistula formation. Pain control was difficult to achieve despite high-dose opioid therapy. Post-traumatic stress disorder was a confounding factor in treating this patient's pain. Ten months after the original injury, the patient returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy with restoration of bowel continuity and abdominal wall closure. The patient presented to the intensive care unit after a 12-hour operation with an open abdomen and the requirement of mechanical ventilation, sedation, and analgesia. Sedation and analgesia were difficult to achieve and maintain with combinations of extremely high doses of midazolam, lorazepam, propofol, and fentanyl (motor assessment activity scale [MAAS] scores of 5), but profoundly achievable with dexmedetomidine. Dexmedetomidine also improved the patient's mental stability, which resulted in improved patient care through compliance with physicians, nurses, and physical therapists.", 
    "9": "Insomnia is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive populations. Some studies have estimated as many as 70% of HIV patients experience insomnia at some point during their illness. Insomnia has been linked to reduced quality of life as well as treatment non-adherence in these patients. However, there has been very limited research on the treatment of insomnia in this setting. Lacking treatment trials, we carried out a review of the available literature relevant to the pharmacologic treatment of insomnia in HIV seropositive individuals in order to provide guidance for the clinical management of this complex population. A systematic MEDLINE search was performed using as search terms each of the FDA approved or commonly prescribed insomnia medications and \"insomnia and HIV.\" In addition, we reviewed the published literature on HIV therapies and common comorbid conditions and their interactions with insomnia therapies. We found 4 primary factors affecting the pharmacotherapy of insomnia in individuals with HIV: (1) medications used to treat HIV; (2) antibiotics used to treat opportunistic infections; (3) the HIV infection itself; and (4) conditions frequently associated with HIV infection. The means by which these factors affect the expected risk-benefit profile of insomnia therapies is discussed, and recommendations are made for choosing medications in patients encountered in clinical practice.",

Cerulein (Cae), a CCK-1R agonist, and pentagastrin, a CCK-2R agonist, dose-dependently increased SS release, 3-fold at 1 mumol/L Cae, 2.5-fold at 10 mumol/L pentagastrin, with occupation of both CCKRs confirmed by L-364,178 and L-365,260 inhibition of CCK receptors 1 and 2. The occupation of high-affinity CCK-1R by Cae was confirmed on SS release with JMV-180, a high-affinity CCK-1R agonist, and absence of SS release inhibition at high Cae concentration occupying the low-affinity CCK-1R. These cells release more than 60% of their SS content by constitutive secretion, confirmed by cycloheximide and brefeldin inhibiting SS synthesis and intracellular trafficking, respectively.",

    "19": "Seven healthy male volunteers were included in a randomized crossover manner. The heart rate (HR), HR variability, arterial oxygen saturation, and bispectral index value were continuously monitored. A mental arithmetic task for 7 minutes was given with or without intravenous sedation with midazolam or propofol. A bispectral index value of 75 to 85 and an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation score of 4 were the targeted sedation level in both groups. HR variability was assessed using the power spectral analysis (low-frequency [LF] and high-frequency [HF] components and LF/HF ratio). The faces anxiety scale was used to grade their stress feelings after each mental arithmetic task.",

The HR, LF/HF ratio, and normalized unit LF increased, and the normalized unit HF decreased in both groups. However, the percentage of changes in LF/HF ratio, normalized unit LF, and normalized unit HF were smaller in the midazolam group. In addition, the reduction in faces anxiety scale was greater in the midazolam group.",

    "23": "Earlier studies have shown widespread alterations of functional connectivity of various brain networks in schizophrenia, including the default mode network (DMN). The DMN has also an important role in the performance of cognitive tasks. Furthermore, treatment with second-generation antipsychotic drugs may ameliorate to some degree working memory (WM) deficits and related brain activity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of treatment with olanzapine monotherapy on functional connectivity among brain regions of the DMN during WM. Seventeen patients underwent an 8-week prospective study and completed two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at 4 and 8 weeks of treatment during the performance of the N-back WM task. To control for potential repetition effects, 19 healthy controls also underwent two fMRI scans at a similar time interval. We used spatial group-independent component analysis (ICA) to analyze fMRI data. Relative to controls, patients with schizophrenia had reduced connectivity strength within the DMN in posterior cingulate, whereas it was greater in precuneus and inferior parietal lobule. Treatment with olanzapine was associated with increases in DMN connectivity with ventromedial prefrontal cortex, but not in posterior regions of DMN. These results suggest that treatment with olanzapine is associated with the modulation of DMN connectivity in schizophrenia. In addition, our findings suggest critical functional differences in the regions of DMN.",

    "28": "We previously showed that 5-HT(3) receptors are involved in the development and expression of methamphetamine (MAP)-induced locomotor sensitization in mice. Here, we examined whether the dopaminergic or the GABAergic systems are involved in the attenuating effects of the 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist MDL72222 on MAP-induced locomotor sensitization. Quantitative autoradiography of D1 ([(3)H]SCH23390), D2 ([(3)H]raclopride) receptor, and GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine ([(3)H]flunitrazepam) binding was carried out in the brains of mice treated with chronic MAP and pretreatment with MDL72222. No significant differences were found in D(1) and D(2) binding between the two groups, suggesting that the attenuating effects of MDL72222 on MAP-induced locomotor sensitization is not medicated by D1 and D2 receptors. Postsynaptic dopamine (DA) receptor supersensitivity was measured by challenge with apomorphine, a dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor agonist, after repeated MAP treatment or pretreatment with MDL72222 before MAP. Apomorphine induced an enhanced locomotor activity in both chronic MAP-treated mice and mice pretreated with MDL 72222, with no significant differences between the two groups. The binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam was significantly decreased in the motor and cingulate cortex, caudate putamen, and nucleus accumbens of mice in the repeated MAP treatment group compared with the control group, and this effect was reversed by pretreatment with MDL72222. This suggested that GABA(A) benzodiazepine binding sites are involved in the attenuating effects of a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist on MAP-induced locomotor sensitization.",

At the emergency department, a prolonged QT-interval was noticed in addition to sinusbradycardia and marginal hypokalemia. The QT-interval normalized promptly after citalopram was discontinued. Taking into account the clinical picture and the ascertained orthostatic dysregulation, a diagnosis of orthostatic syncope was made. Because of the lengthened QT-interval, drug-induced torsade de pointes ventricular arrhythmia was considered as a differential diagnosis. We describe that citalopram was most probably the cause for the prolonged QT-interval. In our article we discuss the pathophysiology of drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS), the most important drugs involved, and finally the prophylaxis and treatment of a TdP ventricular arrhythmia.",

The subjects consisted of 54 adult clinic outpatients and 54 age- and sex-equated healthy comparison subjects. The author found that the digit sequencing task scores for verbal WM were significantly less in both patients with a current episode of MDD and patients in remission than in the controls. Also, there were no significant correlations between the digit sequencing task scores and the dose of antidepressants or benzodiazepines in patients experiencing remission. It is suggested that WM/central executive function in MDD might be impaired, and thus verbal WM might be, at least to a degree, trait related.",

We report on the case of a 42-year-old female patient with frequent daily episodes of almost complete paralysis for the last 6 months resistant to an escitalopram-lorazepam combination at adequate doses. By contrast, the adjunctive administration of low-dose amisulpride at 200 mg/d to the patient's regimen resulted in her substantial and durable improvement. We hypothesize that low-dose amisulpride, acting as a selective antagonist of D2 and D3 dopamine autoreceptors, might reverse the decreased activity of frontal and subcortical dopaminergic circuits presumably involved in motor control during hysterical paralysis.",

    "43": "The use of illicit prescription drugs is common in cannabis users; however, the effects of few psychoactive drugs have been characterized in this population. In this study, Delta-tetrahydrocannabinol (i.e. Delta-THC), triazolam, hydromorphone, and methylphenidate were administered to cannabis users (n=8). Subjects completed the multiple-choice procedure to assess drug reinforcement, as well as self-report questionnaires and performance tasks; physiological assessments were also conducted. Only Delta-THC increased the crossover point on the multiple-choice procedure, but all of the drugs increased ratings on one or more 'positive' drug-effect questionnaire items, as well as items specific for each drug. Triazolam produced the most robust performance impairment, except on a time reproduction task, which was impacted to a greater degree by Delta-THC. Delta-THC elevated heart rate and decreased temperature, triazolam increased heart rate, methylphenidate elevated all cardiovascular indices, and hydromorphone reduced respiration. The effects of the drugs tested in this study were generally consistent with their known pharmacology, although minimal responses to hydromorphone were observed. Future research to directly compare the effects of different psychoactive drugs in cannabis users and nonusers would be useful for identifying potential differences in drug effects as a function of use history.",

Ugi reactions of Boc-protected anthranilic acids, fluorous benzaldehydes, amines, and cyclohexylisocyanide or methyl 2-isocyanoacetate were carried out at room temperature. Microwave-promoted de-Boc/cyclization reactions afforded 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones (BZDs). Suzuki coupling reactions further derivatized the BZD ring by removing the fluorous tag and introducing the biaryl group. A thirty three-member biaryl-substituted BZD library containing four points of diversity was prepared by microwave-assisted solution-phase fluorous parallel synthesis.", 
    "45": "The purpose of this study was to develop a microemulsion system for intranasal delivery of lorazepam. The phase behavior and properties of microemulsions were characterized in a pseudo-ternary system composed of Cremophor EL 35/Transcutol P/Lauroglycol FCC or Labrafil M 1944CS/water, and intranasal absorption of lorazepam from microemulsions was investigated in rabbit. The microemulsions, comprising of FCC, Cremophor EL 35/Transcutol P (1.5:1) and water, were optimal for intranasal delivery of lorazepam. These systems had a higher solubilization capacity with the particle size of <150 nm, and were stable at ambient conditions for at least six months. In vivo absorption studies showed that intranasal absorption of lorazepam from microemulsions at 0.38 mg/kg had the larger AUC(0-t), the longer half-life and the prolonged circulation time with the mean bioavailability of 80.84% for ME2 and 63.48% for ME8 as compared to the intramuscular injection at 0.16 mg/kg. These results indicate that microemulsions may bea promising approach for the intranasal delivery of lorazepam.",

This difference was non-significant. No baseline variable was associated with an increased risk of non-adherence, though the delivery form of pre-randomisation drug (oral or depot) was weakly (p = 0.054) associated with patients originally on depot being less likely to be adherent to an atypical drug.",

    "50": "The goal of the present study was to explore the dynamics of the gamma band using the coherence of the quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) in a sensorimotor integration task and the influence of the neuromodulator bromazepam on the band behavior. Our hypothesis is that the needs of the typewriting task will demand the coupling of different brain areas, and that the gamma band will promote the binding of information. It is also expected that the neuromodulator will modify this coupling. The sample was composed of 39 healthy subjects. We used a randomized double-blind design and divided subjects into three groups: placebo (n=13), bromazepam 3mg (n=13) and bromazepam 6 mg (n=13). The two-way ANOVA analysis demonstrated a main effect for the factors condition (i.e., C4-CZ electrode pair) and moment (i.e., C3-CZ, C3-C4 and C4-CZ pairs of electrodes). We propose that the gamma band plays an important role in the binding among several brain areas in complex motor tasks and that each hemisphere is influenced in a different manner by the neuromodulator.",

Polysomnography (PSG) was performed on nights 1, 6 and 7 of treatment. Daytime assessments on Day 8 included the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS).

The 2.5mg dose also reduced WASO in hours 5-8 (-16.3min, p=0.001). Both doses also improved subjective sleep quality and usual subjective efficacy measures. A significantly longer mean MSLT latency was observed on Day 8 with both doses, compared to placebo (2min increase; p=0.03, both doses). The PVT, RAVLT, and POMS did not differ among treatment groups. No serious or unexpected treatment emergent adverse events were noted.",

    "55": "Mitochondria play a major role in cellular calcium homeostasis. Despite decades of studies, the molecules that mediate and regulate the transport of calcium ions in and out of the mitochondrial matrix remain unknown. Here, we investigate whether SLP-2, an inner membrane mitochondrial protein of unknown function, modulates the activity of mitochondrial Ca(2+) transporters. In HeLa cells depleted of SLP-2, the amplitude and duration of mitochondrial Ca(2+) elevations evoked by agonists were decreased compared to control cells. SLP-2 depletion increased the rates of calcium extrusion from mitochondria. This effect disappeared upon Na(+) removal or addition of CGP-37157, an inhibitor of the mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger, and persisted in permeabilized cells exposed to a fixed cytosolic Na(+) and Ca(2+) concentration. The rates of mitochondrial Ca(2+) extrusion were prolonged in SLP-2 over-expressing cells, independently of the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca(2+) elevations. The amplitude of cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations was increased by SLP-2 depletion and decreased by SLP-2 over-expression. These data show that SLP-2 modulates mitochondrial calcium extrusion, thereby altering the ability of mitochondria to buffer Ca(2+) and to shape cytosolic Ca(2+) signals.",

    "60": "Sumatriptan succinate is an agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1 receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT1D family). It does not have significant affinity for the remaining 5-HT receptors. It does not have affinity for alpha1, alpha2 or beta-adrenergic, dopamine1, dopamine2, muscarinic or benzodiazepine receptors. The objective of the study was to evaluate the in vitro transnasal absorption of sumatriptan succinate through sheep nasal mucosa and to determine its in vitro permeation behavior from various formulations containing penetration enhancers. In this study four different thermoreversible gel formulations designed for nasal delivery of sumatriptan succinate were formulated. The formulations were prepared by using a poly(oxythylene) poly(oxypropylene) block copolymer (Pluronic F 127) based gel along with different permeation enhancers and a pluronic lecithin organogel base. The effect of different concentrations of sodium glycocolate, EDTA and transcutol on in vitro nasal diffusion of sumatriptan succinate was studied. The best permeation profile was obtained with a formulation containing transcutol at a concentration of 0.005% w/w. Pluronic lecithin organogel showed good gelling properties at a concentration in the 20% range.", 
    "61": "The non-benzodiazepine GABA(A) receptor modulators ('Z-drugs') - zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone and eszopiclone - have become the accepted treatments for insomnia where they are available. However, recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials suggest that, for these drugs, there may be particular efficacy and tolerability profiles and distinct clinical outcomes in specific patient populations. This is particularly apparent when hypnotic/ selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor co-therapy is used to treat patients with co-morbid insomnia and psychiatric disorders, as patient recovery appears to be accelerated and enhanced by some drugs but not others. Emerging evidence of why this should be the case is that these hypnotic drugs may differ significantly from each other in their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. Functional selectivity for specific GABA(A) receptor subtypes may determine each drug's clinical attributes, while the pharmacokinetic characteristics of Z-drugs also determine to a large extent how they perform in the clinic. For example, activity at GABA(A) alpha 1 receptor subtypes may be associated with sedative effects, whereas activity at alpha 2 and alpha 3 receptor subtypes may be associated with anxiolytic and antidepressant effects. In summary, the distinct clinical outcomes of zaleplon, zolpidem, zopiclone and eszopiclone may be explained by each drug's unique GABA(A) receptor subunit selectivity and pharmacokinetic profile. Further investigation of GABA( A) receptor subtype effects would help to increase understanding of current hypnotic drug effects, while knowledge of each drug's specific binding profile should enable clinicians to tailor treatment to individual patient's needs.", 
    "62": "Aggressivity is a common problem in the management of elderly patients with dementia. Medications currently used to diminish aggressive behaviour in dementia can have problematic side effects. We present a case and systematic review of the current knowledge about the use of cyproterone acetate to treat aggressivity (excluding hypersexuality related behaviours) in dementia. An 82-year-old man required psychiatric inpatient admission due to agitation and aggressivity and was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. After failed trials of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine 100\u2009mg/day and risperidone 1\u2009mg/day), drugs for dementia (memantine 20\u2009mg/day and rivastigmine 9\u2009mg/day) and benzodiazepines (lorazepam 0.5-1\u2009mg prn) he was started on cyproterone acetate titrated up to 50\u2009mg twice daily. After two weeks he was calmer and did not express aggressivity. Two months later he was discharged to a community placement where he subsequently remained settled on cyproterone. We reviewed literature on the use of cyproterone in aggressivity (excluding hypersexuality) associated with dementia. We searched the main medical databases including articles in English, Spanish, French and Italian. Only one randomized double-blind trial was found, comparing cyproterone with haloperidol (n\u2009=\u200927). Cyproterone was more effective controlling aggressivity and had lower incidence of side effects. In the one uncontrolled naturalistic observational study identified (n\u2009=\u200919), cyproterone was associated with significant reductions in aggressivity without causing major side effects. Further literature was limited to theoretical discussions. Despite there being evidence to support our observations of a useful role for cyproterone in aggressivity in dementia, further studies are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of this therapeutic option.", 
    "63": "In the present study the effect of adenosinergic system on the development of diazepam tolerance to motor disturbances in mice was investigated. Diazepam tolerance was obtained by administration of diazepam at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg, s.c. for ten consecutive days. On the 1st and the 10th day of the experiment motor impairments were measured in two behavioural tests: rota-rod and chimney test. We showed that acute diazepam injection produced significant motor impairments in mice and that effect was decreased by repeated diazepam treatment, confirming the development of tolerance to the motor impairing effect of diazepam. We demonstrated that adenosine A(1) and/or A(2A) receptor agonists: CPA (0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), CGS 21680 (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.), NECA (0.005 and 0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment with diazepam were able to attenuate the development of diazepam tolerance and adenosine receptor antagonists: DPCPX (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), DMPX (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and caffeine (10.0 and 20.0mg/kg, i.p.) induced the opposite effect. The most apparent effects were obtained by non-selective agonist (NECA) and antagonist (caffeine) of adenosine receptors. We conclude that adenosinergic system plays an important role in mechanisms underlying the development of benzodiazepine tolerance.", 
    "64": "GABA(A) receptors that contain the alpha5 subunit (alpha5GABA(A)Rs) are highly expressed in the hippocampus, and have been implicated in learning and memory processes. They generate a tonic form of inhibition that regulates neuronal excitability. Recently it was shown that alpha5GABA(A)Rs also contribute to slow phasic inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons following local stimulation in the stratum lacunosum moleculare. However, it is unknown whether alpha5GABA(A)Rs can also be recruited indirectly by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Here, we studied GABAergic currents evoked by stimulation in the stratum radiatum of CA1 in the presence and absence of CNQX to block AMPA receptor-mediated excitation. We tested their sensitivity to gabazine and two drugs acting at the benzodiazepine site of alpha1/alpha2/alpha3 or alpha5GABA(A)Rs (400 nM zolpidem and 20 nM L-655,708, respectively). IPSCs evoked by stimulation in the stratum radiatum in the presence of CNQX were potentiated by zolpidem, blocked by 1 muM gabazine and were relatively insensitive to L-655,708 consistent with the lack of alpha5GABA(A)Rs. In contrast, IPSCs evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals had a significant gabazine-insensitive component. This component was attenuated by L-655,708 and enhanced by burst stimulation. Furthermore, the L-655,708-sensitive current was absent in recordings from mice lacking alpha5GABA(A)Rs (gabra5(-/-) mice). These results show that alpha5GABA(A)R-mediated phasic inhibition is activated by the Schaffer collateral pathway and provide evidence for activity pattern-dependent participation of alpha5GABA(A)Rs in inhibition.",

Extrapolating from the rat data, the effective dose of [11C]PK11195 for a 70-kg man was estimated to be 4.2 +/- 0.3 microSv/MBq. Five different radiometabolites were detected in rat plasma, and the level of intact [11C]PK11195 decreased from 80% +/- 11% (mean +/- SD) at 10 min to 44% +/- 5% at 40 min after injection. In rat heart, brain, kidney, and lung homogenates, more than 90% of total radioactivity originated from intact [11C]PK11195.

The use of Meperidine was lower in the I group but the difference was not statistically significant. Both the groups took the same amount of time to complete the prep, but the I group fasted longer. The I group also completed or drank more of the prep more often than the P group. The prep quality was found to be superior with less frequency of a poor prep in the I group.

    "73": "Deferasirox, a newly developed iron chelator, was coadministered orally with either a known inducer of drug metabolism or with cosubstrates for cytochrome P450 (CYP) to characterize the potential for drug-drug interactions. In the induction assessment, single-dose deferasirox pharmacokinetics were obtained in the presence and absence of a repeated-dose regimen of rifampin. In the CYP3A interaction evaluation, midazolam and its active hydroxylated metabolite were assessed after single doses of midazolam in the presence and absence of steady-state concentrations of deferasirox. To test for interaction at the level of CPY2C8, single-dose repaglinide pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics were determined with and without repeated-dose administration of deferasirox. After rifampin, a significant reduction (44%) in plasma exposure (AUC) to deferasirox was observed. Upon coadministration of midazolam, there was a modest reduction of up to 22% in midazolam exposure (AUC, C(max)), suggesting a modest induction of CYP3A4/5 by deferasirox. Def erasirox caused increases in repaglinide plasma C(max) and AUC of 1.5-fold to over 2-fold, respectively, with little change in blood glucose measures. Specific patient prescribing recommendations were established when coadministering deferasirox with midazolam, repaglinide, and rifampin. These recommendations may also apply to other substrates of CYP3A4/5 and CYP2C8 or potent inducers of glucuronidation.", 
    "74": "The present work aimed to evaluate the effects of social separation for 14 days (chronic stress) and of withdrawal from a 14-day treatment with diazepam (acute stress) on the exploratory behaviour of male rats in the elevated plus-maze and on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) turnover in different brain structures. Social separation had an anxiogenic effect, evidenced by fewer entries into, and less time spent on the open arms of the elevated plus-maze. Separation also selectively increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the hippocampus and median raphe nucleus. Diazepam withdrawal had a similar anxiogenic effect in grouped animals and increased 5-hydroxytryptamine turnover in the same brain structures. Chronic treatment with imipramine during the 14 days of separation prevented the behavioural and neurochemical changes caused by social separation. It is suggested that the increase in anxiety determined by both acute and chronic stress is mediated by the activation of the median raphe nucleus-hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine pathway.", 
    "75": "An ideal drug for outpatient treatments under conscious sedation would have both sedative and analgesic properties. CB1/CB2 agonists are expected to have sedative, amnestic, analgesic and anti-emetic properties. The main objective of this first study in humans was to assess the sedative properties of intravenous Org 26828. In addition, pharmacokinetics, amnestic properties, postural stability, and behavioural and cardiovascular effects were studied. Midazolam intravenous 0.1 mg/kg and placebo were used as controls. The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC0-inf) of the main metabolite Org 26761 were proportional to dose. No effects were observed after doses up to 0.3 \u03bcg/kg of Org 26828. Dose-related effects were observed at higher doses. Although subjects reported subjective sedation after administration of Org 26828 at 3 and 6 \u03bcg/kg, the observed sedation was considerably less than after midazolam. Doses higher than the maximum tolerated dose of 1 \u03bcg/kg of Org 26828 caused unpleasant central nervous system effects (anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations). Therefore, Org 26828 is not suitable for providing sedation for outpatient surgical procedures.", 
    "76": "Drug use has been associated with craving, which may be described as a powerful and sometimes overwhelming urge to use the drug. Patients seeking treatment for methylamphetamine dependence must cope with drug cravings as they engage in psychosocial treatments. Changes in brain GABA(A) receptors during substance use and withdrawal provide a neurobiological basis for craving and associated anxiety. Flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) plus gabapentin (an antiepileptic) were compared with placebo in a randomized, double-blind study to assess the effects on craving during initial treatment for methylamphetamine dependence. Evaluation was conducted over a 30-day period. Craving and drug use were found to be highly correlated. Craving was reduced significantly in the flumazenil plus gabapentin group compared with placebo following the initial treatment period and throughout the 30 days. Decreased methylamphetamine use was also observed, as measured by urine drug screens and self-reports.", 
    "77": "Neuronal network oscillations are a unifying phenomenon in neuroscience research, with comparable measurements across scales and species. Cortical oscillations are of central importance in the characterization of neuronal network function in health and disease and are influential in effective drug development. Whilst animal in vitro and in vivo electrophysiology is able to characterize pharmacologically induced modulations in neuronal activity, present human counterparts have spatial and temporal limitations. Consequently, the potential applications for a human equivalent are extensive. Here, we demonstrate a novel implementation of contemporary neuroimaging methods called pharmaco-magnetoencephalography. This approach determines the spatial profile of neuronal network oscillatory power change across the cortex following drug administration and reconstructs the time course of these modulations at focal regions of interest. As a proof of concept, we characterize the nonspecific GABAergic modulator diazepam, which has a broad range of therapeutic applications. We demonstrate that diazepam variously modulates theta (4-7 Hz), alpha (7-14 Hz), beta (15-25 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz) frequency oscillations in specific regions of the cortex, with a pharmacodynamic profile consistent with that of drug uptake. We examine the relevance of these results with regard to the spatial and temporal observations from other modalities and the various therapeutic consequences of diazepam and discuss the potential applications of such an approach in terms of drug development and translational neuroscience.",

The experimental results clearly suggested that, in comparison with the UV-spectrophotometry method, the first-order derivative UV-spectrophotometry is a simple method to estimate diazepam with sufficient accuracy, specificity, and precision even in the presence of 282-times Tween-20 and 2,072-times propylene glycol.",

    "80": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is considered to be one of the most common anxiety disorders. Despite its high prevalence, the disorder is still considerably underdiagnosed and undertreated. SAD shows a typically early onset in childhood or early adolescence and generally becomes chronic. The disease places a massive burden on patients lives, affecting not only their social interactions but also their educational and professional activities, thereby constituting a severe disability. Although substantial progress in the study of the etiology of SAD has been made, no commonly accepted model has emerged yet. Data from genetic and neuroimaging studies point towards a contribution of several neurotransmitter systems (i.e. norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin) to the pathophysiology of this disorder. Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies have repeatedly emphasized the central role of the amygdalae and insula in the neural circuitry of the disorder. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are commonly accepted as first line therapy, however other substance classes like serotonin norepineprine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), benzodiazepines and several other agents have also proved effective. There is still a substantial lack of data on therapeutic options in cases of non-responsive SAD as well as on add-on therapy.

Compared with placebo, use of dexmedetomidine during procedures was associated with decreased use of rescue midazolam and a similar degree of sedation compared with various agents used during surgery or for procedures. Use of long-term (>24 h) dexmedetomidine sedation is comparable to sedation with benzodiazepines in critically ill patients. In a Phase 4 study, dexmedetomidine was safe in dosages up to 1.4 microg/kg/hour for greater than 24 hours and did not produce rebound tachycardia or hypertension when abruptly discontinued. One small randomized controlled trial demonstrated decreased incidence of delirium, the primary endpoint, with dexmedetomidine compared with midazolam or propofol for sedation after cardiac valve surgery. Many, but not all, studies suggest that dexmedetomidine has a promising role in prevention and treatment of delirium in critically ill patients when delirium was studied as a secondary endpoint.",

These cells could be used in various applications such as studies of drug metabolism and hepatotoxicity, which however, would require a significant expression of drug metabolizing enzymes. To derive these cells we use a stepwise differentiation protocol where growth- and maturation factors are added. The first phase involves the formation of definitive endoderm. Next, these cells are treated with factors known to promote the induction and proliferation towards hepatic progenitor cell types. In the last phase the cells are terminally differentiated and maturated into functional hepatocyte-like cells. The cultures were characterized by analysis of endodermal or hepatic markers and compared to cultures derived without induction via definitive endoderm. Hepatic functions such as urea secretion, glycogen storage, indocyanine green uptake and secretion, and cytochrome P450-expression and activity were evaluated. The DE-Hep showed a hepatocyte morphology with sub-organized cells and exhibited many liver-functions including transporter activity and capacity to metabolize drugs specific for important cytochrome P450 sub-families. This represents an important step in differentiation of hESC into functional hepatocytes.", 
    "100": "Formulation of layered pellets can be a useful method for the preparation of multiparticulate systems. The aims of this work were to study the properties of hydrophilic active agent (pirenzepine dihydrochloride) layers formed on different pellet cores, the efficacy of layering and the connection between the core and the layers. The carrier pellets were prepared from mixtures of a hydrophilic (microcrystalline cellulose) and a hydrophobic (magnesium stearate) component in different ratios. These cores were coated in a fluid bed apparatus with an aqueous solution of active agent, with or without the addition of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) as an adhesive component. The wettability of the pharmaceutical powders was assessed by means of Enslin number and contact angle measurements, and the surface energy was determined. Spreading coefficients of the components were also calculated and correlated with pellet properties such as the content of active agent, the friability and the morphological appearance of the layered product. An increased friability of the layer formed and the lower effectiveness of the process were experienced with a reduction in the wetting of the core. The efficiency of layering on a less polar core could be increased by the addition of HPMC, but the sensitivity of these pirenzepine layers to mechanical stress was higher. The type of the abrasion of these particles was dissimilar to that for samples prepared without HPMC. Peeling of the layers containing HPMC was observed for hydrophobic cores, but this phenomenon was not detected for the hydrophilic ones. These results can be explained by the spreading coefficients, which revealed an insufficient adhesion of layers for the samples that exhibited peeling.",

    "102": "Beta-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, Ca(2+) antagonists, and benzodiazepines negatively affect platelet aggregation in vitro. Few data exists on whether platelet function in vivo is relevantly influenced by exposure to any these substances. We analysed in three cohorts of 100 patients each treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), autologous HSCT, and intensive chemotherapy, respectively, whether treatment with these drugs was associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Cumulative incidences of bleeding in the three cohorts were 47 +/- 5% after allogeneic transplants, 30 +/- 5% after autologous transplant, and 46 +/- 5% after chemotherapy (p = 0.008). Exposure to beta-blockers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.71, p = 0.32), Ca(2+) antagonists (HR 0.90, p = 0.73), and benzodiazepines (HR 1.18, p = 0.29) did not significantly increase the risk of bleeding in any cohort. Instead, bleeding risk was determined by platelet count, presence of inflammation, azotemia, presence of graft-versus-host disease and treatment with low-molecular weight heparin. After correcting for these factors, no differences in bleeding risk were seen between the three cohorts. In conclusion, therapy with Beta-1-adrenoreceptor antagonists, Ca(2+) antagonists, and benzodiazepines did not appear to significantly increase the risk for hemorrhagic complications in patients with iatrogenic severe thrombocytopenia.",

Post-natal day 17 rats were injured using controlled cortical impact. Systemic treatment with flumazenil at 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg was initiated on post-injury day 1 and administered for 13 days via daily intraperitoneal injections. Morris water maze (MWM) testing was used to measure latency to find a submerged platform and the results from experimental and control animals were compared. We demonstrated a significant dose-dependent improvement in MWM performance in drug-treated animals. This is the first study demonstrating the efficacy of flumazenil in reducing post-TBI cognitive deficits and we propose that these effects may be related to modulation of the GABA(A) receptor.",

Quantitative analysis of the video was performed using the Dartmouth Operative Conditions Scale (DOCS). The DOCS is a tool previously developed to quantify the adequacy of procedural sedation through an objective measurement of the patient state during the sedation process. In this study, the DOCS was used in a novel way to compare the quality of sedation provided by different sedation protocols. Data were collected on patient demographics, patient and provider satisfaction, efficiency, side effects, and safety measures.", 
    "108": "Videotape analysis using the DOCS revealed that 52% (13/25) of the standard group exhibited an uncontrolled patient state (significant undersedation and/or oversedation) on 1 or more occasion during their EUS procedure compared with 28% (7/25) of the propofol group. Patients in the standard group spent 7.1% of the procedure in an uncontrolled patient state, whereas patients in the propofol group experienced an uncontrolled state approximately 1.0% of the procedure time. Overall efficiency as measured by time in both the procedure room and in recovery was superior in the propofol group. These patients spent 12 less minutes on average in the procedure room and were ready for discharge in about half the time (56 minutes versus 109 minutes). The propofol group experienced significantly less in-hospital and at-home nausea and vomiting and felt back to baseline status more quickly. Finally, patient satisfaction was improved in the propofol group: 60% felt the procedure was better than anticipated versus 21% in the standard group.", 
    "109": "Expert videotape analysis of the patient state during procedural sedation allows direct comparison of sedation methodologies using small numbers of patients. In our institution, endoscopist-directed sedation using a midazolam/narcotic combination for EUS proved inferior to sedation using propofol given by an anesthesiologist. Specifically, a midazolam/narcotic combination provided less effective intraprocedural conditions, was less efficient both before and after the procedure, and was less satisfactory to patients as compared with propofol. Results of this type of analysis can be used to drive appropriate system redesign and improve patient care.", 
    "110": "To investigate the pharmacokinetic characteristics in TSOD (Tsumura, Suzuki, obese, diabetes) mice, a model of type 2 diabetes and obesity, the expressions of major hepatic CYP enzymes in TSOD and TSNO (Tsumura, Suzuki, non-obesity; control) mice were compared. The 7-month-old TSOD mice, which represented severe obesity/diabetes-related pathophysiology, showed higher expressions of Cyp2c and Cyp3a compared with TSNO mice, while those of Cyp1a and Cyp2e were lower. Cyp3a metabolic activity was also higher in TSOD mice. In the 7-month-old liver, pregnane X receptor (PXR) (nuclear receptor) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) (cofactor) mRNA expression were higher in TSOD mice, possibly playing a role in the altered expression of Cyp3a. This specifically altered CYP expression in TSOD mice suggests that the biotransformation of drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes differs from that in normal animals. Based on these findings, further investigation on the relationship between altered CYP expression and pathophysiology may be useful in elucidating changes in pharmacokinetics in obese/diabetic patients.", 
    "111": "We aimed to assess the effect of coadministration and withdrawal of a potent cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) inhibitor (ritonavir) and a potent CYP3A inducer (St John's wort) on CYP3A enzyme activity in an open, fixed-sequence study design. We investigated the pharmacokinetics of midazolam: (i) at baseline, (ii) after a single dose of either St John's wort or ritonavir (each n = 6), (iii) after 14 days of coadministration of ritonavir (300 mg b.i.d.) and St John's wort (300 mg t.i.d.), and (iv) at 2 days after cessation of both St John's wort and ritonavir. Combined administration of inducer and inhibitor resulted in a predominance of enzyme inhibition: coadministration of St John's wort and ritonavir with intravenous administration of midazolam resulted in an increase in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-8 h) of midazolam to 180% of baseline value, whereas with orally administered midazolam, the AUC(0-6 h) increased to 412% of baseline value (P < 0.05 for each). After cessation of the coadministered drugs, the AUC(0-6 h) of orally administered midazolam decreased to 6% of the level observed during combined administration, and the AUC(0-8 h) of intravenously administered midazolam decreased to 33% of the values observed during combined administration (P < 0.001 for each). Induction may be unmasked after the withdrawal of a combination of a potent CYP3A inhibitor and a potent CYP3A inducer, leading to substantial drops in drug exposure of CYP3A substrates. This may require substantial dose adjustments, particularly of orally administered drugs.",

The level of sedation was assessed at defined time intervals, according to the Houpt Sedation Rating Scale. Children's sedation success during dental treatment was classified as satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Heart rate and oxygen saturation were evaluated by an oxygen saturation monitor in the sedation period.

Propylene glycol serum concentrations were obtained 24-48 hours after continuous-infusion lorazepam was initiated and every 3-5 days thereafter. Propylene glycol accumulation was defined as concentrations of 25 mg/dL or more. Groups with and without propylene glycol accumulation were compared and factors associated with propylene glycol concentration were determined using multivariate correlation regression analyses.", 
    "142": "Forty-eight propylene glycol serum samples were obtained from 33 patients. Fourteen (42%) patients had propylene glycol accumulation, representing 23 (48%) serum samples. Univariate analyses showed the following factors were related to propylene glycol accumulation: baseline renal dysfunction, presence of alcohol withdrawal, sex, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, rate of lorazepam continuous infusion, and 24-hour lorazepam dose. Multivariate linear regression modeling demonstrated that propylene glycol concentration was strongly associated with the continuous infusion rate and 24-hour dose (adjusted r(2) > or = 0.77; p < 0.001). Independent correlation analyses showed that these 2 variables were so strongly associated with propylene glycol concentration (r(2) > or = 0.71; p < 0.001) that they alone predicted propylene glycol concentration. Seven (21%) patients developed renal dysfunction after continuous-infusion lorazepam was initiated, but associated causes were indeterminable. Other possible propylene glycol-associated adverse effects were not observed.",

The search was from the earliest references included in this database (1949) until 1 May 2009. This resulted in retrieval of 129 papers. Review of study summaries indicated that 36 provided information about either a topical treatment or oral therapy for acute low back pain. In addition, studies included as part of the evidence base for the Evidence Review of American Pain Society/American Academy of Pain Medicine Evidence Review for Evaluation and Management of Low Back Pain were reviewed.",

Only a small number of studies compared different approaches to treatment of acute back pain and most failed to demonstrate significant differences among treatments. Available results support the view that both NSAIDs and low-level continuous heat treatment are more effective than acetaminophen and that heat treatment is also significantly more effective than ibuprofen. A potential limitation of this study is that information from trials published in journals not included in PubMed or reported only at meetings and not yet published was not included.",

    "153": "A 2-day-old girl was referred with a problem of the left forearm and arm, which exhibited cold oedema with decreased mobility. Lesions were present at birth and were rapidly complicated by skin necrosis. The mother was taking olazanpine, prazepam and valpromide throughout the entire pregnancy. Delivery was complicated by shoulder dystocia requiring obstetric procedures such as suprapubic pressure, Couder's maneuver and episiotomy. On physical examination her left hemi-thorax, left arm, forearm and hand exhibited marked oedema. A large and well-demarcated bullous, fibrous and ulcerated area of skin necrosis was observed on the elbow fold and on the inner anterior part of the arm. Digital flexion with cyanosis was present. MR angiography revealed extensive oedema of the soft tissue and muscle with fascial effusion, associated with compression of the arm arteries and reduced blood flow in the forearm. A fasciotomy was performed at Day 3 of life. The postsurgical arterial MRI was normal. At Day 10 of life, the patient developed opisthotonos involving spasms and tremors associated with numerous intercritical abnormalities evoking benzodiazepine weaning syndrome. The child's neurological status was stabilized by treatment with phenobarbital and clonazepam. She was subsequently lost to follow-up.", 
    "154": "CVIC has been ascribed to multiples causes. Mechanical compression is the main recognized factor: amniotic band constriction, umbilical cord loops, compression in utero by a deceased co-twin, malposition of the hand, arm or forearm, local or general factors that can add to extraction problems: brachypelvic disproportion, extraction with forceps, oligo/polyhydramnios, pre-term delivery, pre-eclampsia, caesarean section, premature labour, excessive maternal weight gain or diabetes. Our case emphasized three main points. First, the diagnostic value of early MR angiography in the event of associated extensive tissue oedema, multiple arterial compression and decreased vascular perfusion. Second, the role of shoulder dystocia in triggering the traumatic factor reported for the first time. Third, the role of neuroleptic and anxiolytic treatments taken by the mother during pregnancy. Prazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that can cause impregnation and withdraw syndromes in neonates. Impregnation \"floppy infant syndrome\" is an early event characterized by hypotonia, hypoventilation and lethargy. Hypotonia and decreased foetal movements may favour prolonged pressures and malposition with secondary crush injury during delivery. Maternal medication has not been cited hitherto as an aetiological factor in neonatal compartment syndrome.",

The main aim of this study was to determine whether common missense polymorphisms in the UGT2B15 gene (D85Y and K523T) are associated with altered oxazepam pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We also determined the possible influence of a common deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding UGT2B17, which shows substantial substrate specificity overlap with UGT2B15.",

    "159": "We have extended our previous 10-year follow-up study of MMT retention for another 5 years and added data on survival of all patients ever admitted to our MMT clinic (6/1993 to 6/2007). Data were calculated from admission to MMT until leaving, death, or study closure (6/2008). Ninety-four of a total of 613 patients (4711.6 person-years [py]) died. Cancer was the primary cause of death for those who remained in treatment, and overdose for those who left MMT. Longer survival (p=0.051) with a trend for a lower mortality rate (p=0.08) was noted among the 464 patients who stayed in treatment > or =1 year (1.8/100 py), compared with the 149 patients who left MMT <1 year (2.6/100 py). Predictors of survival in multivariate analyses were younger age (<40 years) at admission, living with a spouse/partner, being hepatitis B sera-negative, not abusing benzodiazepines on admission (interaction effect), not being referred directly from hospitalization to MMT, and not leaving the MMT program for hospitalization. The two latter variables also predicted longer retention, as did a high methadone dose (> or =100mg/d), no opiate and, no benzodiazepine abuse after 1 year and either having any DSM-IV-TR Axis I, or no Axis I&II psychiatric diagnoses. Unlike retention, mortality was associated with pre-treatment severity and comorbidities thus only partially reflects MMT outcome (opiate abstinence and treatment success). Benzodiazepine abuse reduced both retention and survival, emphasizing the high priority that should be given to stopping it.",

Combined rates of overweight and obesity at 6 months and 12 months exceeded 50% in patients, and were almost double those of healthy subjects. Logistic regression demonstrated that weight gain in the first 6 months was significantly associated with male gender and prescription of olanzapine or risperidone. Patients who were obese at 6 months and/or 12 months had significantly greater mean serum triglyceride levels and fasting glucose levels than non-obese patients.",

    "165": "Many studies showed that benzodiazepines could modulate immune responses through interaction with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in immune cells but most of the studies were focused on monocytes and macrophages. In the present study, we revealed that diazepam, a mixed-type benzodiazepine, inhibited IFN-gamma production by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) induced by anti-CD3 in dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that diazepam could inhibit the frequency of IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. The inhibitory effect of diazepam on IFN-gamma production is similar to that of R(0)5-4864, a selective PBRs ligand. However, D8555, a selective ligand for PBRs in microglia in the central nervous system, is a much weak inhibitor compared with R(0)5-4864 or diazepam. The inhibitory effect of R(0)5-4864 could be antagonized by PK11195, which is recognized as selective PBRs antagonist, and suppressive effect of diazepam on T cells is partially antagonized by PK11195. Collectively, these results suggested that diazepam suppressed human T cell function through PBRs.", 
    "166": "Zolpidem is a widely used hypnotic drug acting via benzodiazepine binding sites on GABA(A) receptors. Several studies suggested that zolpidem might have better anticonvulsant potency than previously thought. To compare the sedative and anticonvulsant potency of this drug, we studied in male mice the influence of zolpidem (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.) on ambulatory locomotor activity (a measure of sedation) and on the threshold for myoclonus, clonic and tonic seizures, as well as death, in response to i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 4.4 mg/min). Because older people take zolpidem more often than young people and have a higher incidence of epilepsy, we also compared the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of low doses of this drug (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) between adult (3 months) and aged (13 months) mice. Zolpidem in doses of 0.3-10 mg/kg decreased locomotion, as quantified by recording interruptions of infrared beams during 10 min, and in doses of 1-10 mg/kg increased the threshold for PTZ-induced seizures and death. The effect of zolpidem against tonic seizures was greater than against two other seizure components and death. In control aged mice the threshold for PTZ-induced myoclonus, clonic seizures and death was lower than in adult mice, while the locomotor activity was not different. In adult and in aged mice zolpidem in a dose of 1 mg/kg decreased locomotion and elevated the threshold for PTZ-induced seizures and death. Neither of these effects was age-dependent. The results suggest that in addition to strong sedative activity zolpidem has potent anticonvulsant properties.", 
    "167": "Little is known about the effects of antipsychotic medications on gray matter (GM) in schizophrenia. Although clozapine remains the most effective antipsychotic medication in treatment-refractory cases, it is unknown whether it has a differential effect on GM development.",

    "171": "The precise definition of a severe asthmatic exacerbation is an issue that presents difficulties. The term 'status asthmaticus' relates severity to outcome and has been used to define a severe asthmatic exacerbation that does not respond to and/or perilously delays the repetitive or continuous administration of short-acting inhaled beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists (SABA) in the emergency setting. However, a number of limitations exist concerning the quantification of unresponsiveness. Therefore, the term 'acute severe asthma' is widely used, relating severity mostly to a combination of the presenting signs and symptoms and the severity of the cardiorespiratory abnormalities observed, although it is well known that presentation does not foretell outcome. In an acute severe asthma episode, close observation plus aggressive administration of bronchodilators (SABAs plus ipratropium bromide via a nebulizer driven by oxygen) and oral or intravenous corticosteroids are necessary to arrest the progression to severe hypercapnic respiratory failure leading to a decrease in consciousness that requires intensive care unit (ICU) admission and, eventually, ventilatory support. Adjunctive therapies (intravenous magnesium sulfate and/or others) should be considered in order to avoid intubation. Management after admission to the hospital ward because of an incomplete response is similar. The decision to intubate is essentially based on clinical judgement. Although cardiac or respiratory arrest represents an absolute indication for intubation, the usual picture is that of a conscious patient struggling to breathe. Factors associated with the increased likelihood of intubation include exhaustion and fatigue despite maximal therapy, deteriorating mental status, refractory hypoxaemia, increasing hypercapnia, haemodynamic instability and impending coma or apnoea. To intubate, sedation is indicated in order to improve comfort, safety and patient-ventilator synchrony, while at the same time decrease oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production. Benzodiazepines can be safely used for sedation of the asthmatic patient, but time to awakening after discontinuation is prolonged and difficult to predict. The most common alternative is propofol, which is attractive in patients with sudden-onset (near-fatal) asthma who may be eligible for extubation within a few hours, because it can be titrated rapidly to a deep sedation level and has rapid reversal after discontinuation; in addition, it possesses bronchodilatory properties. The addition of an opioid (fentanyl or remifentanil) administered by continuous infusion to benzodiazepines or propofol is often desirable in order to provide amnesia, sedation, analgesia and respiratory drive suppression. Acute severe asthma is characterized by severe pulmonary hyperinflation due to marked limitation of the expiratory flow. Therefore, the main objective of the initial ventilator management is 2-fold: to ensure adequate gas exchange and to prevent further hyperinflation and ventilator-associated lung injury. This may require hypoventilation of the patient and higher arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO(2)) levels and a more acidic pH. This does not apply to asthmatic patients intubated for cardiac or respiratory arrest. In this setting the post-anoxic brain oedema might demand more careful management of PaCO(2) levels to prevent further elevation of intracranial pressure and subsequent complications. Monitoring lung mechanics is of paramount importance for the safe ventilation of patients with status asthmaticus. The first line of specific pharmacological therapy in ventilated asthmatic patients remains bronchodilation with a SABA, typically salbutamol (albuterol). Administration techniques include nebulizers or metered-dose inhalers with spacers. Systemic corticosteroids are critical components of therapy and should be administered to all ventilated patients, although the dose of systemic corticosteroids in mechanically ventilated asthmatic patients remains controversial. Anticholinergics, inhaled corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists and methylxanthines offer little benefit, and clinical data favouring their use are lacking. In conclusion, expertise, perseverance, judicious decisions and practice of evidence-based medicine are of paramount importance for successful outcomes for patients with acute severe asthma.", 
    "172": "A pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-benzimidazole hybrid (PBD-BIMZ) derived from the tricyclic anticancer PBD antibiotics can covalently bind to a guanine base at its exocyclic 2-amino group in double-helical DNA. Through the formation of stable DNA adducts, these hybrids have previously been shown to have significant anticancer activity in a number of cell lines. Here, the three-dimensional solution structure of the complex formed between the self-complementary DNA decamer 5'-AACAATTGTT-3' and PBD-BIMZ has been investigated by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and NOE distance restraint molecular dynamics simulations. Refinements using an explicit solvation model yielded a complex structure that is in good agreement with the NMR structural data. Successful convergence is indicated by an average mutual root-mean-square deviation of <1 A for three final representative structures selected by clustering methods from the molecular dynamics trajectories at 300 K. The ligand binds in an (11S,11aS) configuration to one of the two symmetrically located guanine bases of the duplex and is oriented with its benzimidazole moiety toward the 5'-end of the modified guanine. It is accommodated within the minor groove covering the centrally located 6 bp. Conformational and helical parameters of the DNA adduct are typical of a B-like duplex, and more significant helical distortions by the covalent binding of PBD-BIMZ are mostly confined to the covalent binding site and the junction between complexed and noncomplexed DNA segments. In contrast to the overall well-determined conformation of the bound hybrid, its terminal N-methylpiperazine ring appears to adopt various conformations associated with increased flexibility.", 
    "173": "The aim of this study was to model in mice the association between metabolic syndrome and the administration of atypical antipsychotic (AAP). Two dosages (4 and 8 mg/kg per day) of olanzapine (OL) were infused in 36 female mice for 30 days by osmotic mini-pumps. This study was also designed to further extend the implications raised in other experiments by our model of AAP-induced metabolic dysregulation. Through the use of the osmotic mini-pumps, this model is aimed to circumvent the shorter (than in humans) half-life of AAPs in rodents and to chronically administer OL by a reliable and less disturbing method. Indirect calorimetry was used to evaluate metabolic rate (MR) and respiratory exchange ratio together with weight and caloric intake. Serum insulin, leptin, and glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test) were assessed. Pancreatic beta cells insulin levels, periuterine and liver fat content were also analyzed. Olanzapine-infused mice exhibited a reduction of overall MR (kilojoule per hour) and resting MR and respiratory exchange ratio, with periuterine fat significantly enlarged. All metabolic alterations were detected at the highest dose, with major effects found on weight gain and hyperphagia. Impaired glucose metabolism, associated with hyperinsulinemia and hyperleptinemia were found. Insulin resistance was evidenced by the raise of HOMA-IR index. Increased insulin and lipid storage were detected at pancreatic and hepatic levels respectively. These findings illustrate the development of a cluster of risk factors (metabolic syndrome) and, for the first time, a decrease of energy expenditure (MR) due to chronic OL infusion.", 
    "174": "The number-needed-to-treat (NNT) or the number-needed-to-harm (NNH) analysis was performed on olanzapine and comparators for all known controlled clinical studies of olanzapine for bipolar maintenance treatment or relapse prevention to assess safety and efficacy. Studies compared olanzapine (n = 225) and placebo (n = 136) for 12 months, olanzapine (n = 217) and lithium (n = 214) for 12 months, and olanzapine plus lithium or valproate (n = 72) and placebo plus lithium or valproate (n = 64) for 18 months. For prevention of all-cause treatment discontinuation, the NNT was 7 to 8. For 9 of 11 efficacy and disposition measures examined, beneficial outcomes were more common with olanzapine than placebo. Beneficial outcomes were more common with olanzapine than lithium for 7 measures and more common for olanzapine plus lithium or valproate than placebo plus lithium or valproate for 1 measure. The NNHs of 5 to 8 for a weight gain of 7% or higher and 10 to 11 for the increase in body mass index category to overweight or obese during maintenance treatment indicated that these outcomes were more common for olanzapine or olanzapine plus mood stabilizers than for the comparators. All efficacy and disposition measures showing significant differences between groups for 12 to 18 months have NNTs favoring olanzapine or olanzapine plus lithium or valproate over placebo, lithium, or placebo plus lithium or valproate. However, the NNHs favor these comparators for avoidance of weight gain and of increase in body mass index category to overweight or obese. Clinicians should consider these and other potential benefits and risks in using maintenance treatments for patients with a bipolar disorder."
