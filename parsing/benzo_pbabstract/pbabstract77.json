Acute use of lorazepam is frequently the initial treatment choice for convulsive status epilepticus or repetitive seizure clusters. Cognitive assessment was performed during drug and placebo conditions using a computerized battery of cognitive tests. With the exception of performance on the reasoning composite score, significant drug effects were present on all primary cognitive domain measures. However, the only significant drug-by-age interaction effect was seen for dual-task performance. The relationship between test performance and plasma lorazepam concentrations was generally modest and non-significant, suggesting that individual differences in pharmacokinetics are not a major factor contributing to the emergence of cognitive side effects. Despite robust lorazepam effects on multiple measures of neurocognitive function, differential age effects are largely restricted to dual-task performance. These results indicate that with the exception of dual-task performance, older individuals in the age range of this study do not appear to be at increased risk for the emergence of cognitive side effects following a single 2-mg dose of lorazepam.",

    "34": "Acute catatonia is a non-specific, relatively frequent syndrome, which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis. It occurs in association with mood disorders, psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases. Its short-term prognosis is of paramount importance. Without effective treatment, it is associated with high mortality. Despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder, it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings, which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care. However, if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia, the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial. In fact, despite the progress made by the DSM-IV-TR and CIM 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia, we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia, which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients. To illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients, we report here a clinical vignette.", 
    "35": "Mr. M. aged 21, without psychiatric history, has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension. Olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mg/d on the nineth day of hospitalization; the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution, in intensive units, of 15mg per day of lorazepam. After 72hours, the patient has not responded to this treatment. ECT was expected, but the patient died on the 12th day.", 
    "36": "This case raises a threefold question: the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis, that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care, primarily the well-founded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder. For Mr. M., the clinical diagnosis that he has shown, according to the DSM IV-TR, is brief psychotic disorder \"temporary diagnosis\". This diagnosis - brief psychotic disorder - does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table. The immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome. The proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be \"catatonia\" as proposed by Taylor and Fink, instead of \"brief psychotic disorder\" if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis. The identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow: its clinical detection, the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder, appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally, the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy. Conventional treatment, benzodiazepine- and/or ECT-based, can solve the catatonic episode in a few days, irrespective of its etiology and its severity. Moreover, while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes, recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine, in various clinical forms of benign catatonia. However, our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated. Was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine\u00a0? The answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia. We wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like Cassidy et al. in 2001 and Suzuki et al. in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by Taylor and Fink in 2003.", 
    "37": "The non-recognition of catatonia as an independent entity, the lack of a therapeutic consensus and the pending issue on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of catatonia are at the origin of the difficulties of therapeutic support of catatonic patients.", 
    "38": "Anxiety disorders are among the main psychiatric conditions co-occuring with bipolar disorders. Many clinical and epidemiological studies have found much higher prevalence rates of generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in bipolar patients than in the general population, regardless of age. In the National Comorbidity Survey for instance, the diagnosis of at least one anxiety disorder was made for nearly 90% of bipolar subjects. Several issues arise from this high comorbidity, such as the way anxiety disorders alter the course and prognosis of the mood disorder, and challenge typical therapeutic strategies. This article reviews data on clinical and therapeutical significance of such comorbidity.", 
    "39": "Many studies point out the poorer outcome for bipolar patients with co-occurring anxiety symptoms: apart from the alarming increase of suicidal ideas and suicide attempts, authors have found a shorter duration of euthymia, more comorbid addictions, mixed states and rapid cycling, and lower response to treatments. This is the reason why monitoring the suicidal risk in those bipolar patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders is of critical importance. From a physiopathological standpoint, the precise links between both pathologies remains unclear. The frequency of this comorbidity and its significance on long term prognosis stands in sharp contrast with the very few therapeutic studies conducted in this indication so far. Pharmacological approaches are strongly limited by the risk of mood switching under antidepressants and drug dependence on anxiolytics such as benzodiazepines. Nevertheless, there is emerging evidence of the interest of atypical antipsychotics such as olanzapine and mood stabilisers such as lamotrigine to control anxiety symptoms in bipolar patients. There is weaker evidence for other molecules. Taking into account other therapeutic approaches than the pharmacological approach appears accurate. Psychosocial interventions such as cognitive-behavioral therapies or psychoeducation appear essential to improve in a correct way the global functioning and quality of life of these patients.",

    "42": "Currently, columns packed with sub-2 \u03bcm particles are widely employed in liquid chromatography but are scarcely used in supercritical fluid chromatography. The goal of the present study was to compare the performance, possibilities and limitations of both ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and ultra-high performance supercritical fluid chromatography (UHPSFC) using columns packed with sub-2 \u03bcm particles. For this purpose, a kinetic evaluation was first performed, and van Deemter curves and pressure plots were constructed and compared for columns packed with hybrid silica stationary phases composed of 1.7 and 3.5 \u03bcm particles. As expected, the kinetic performance of the UHPSFC method was significantly better than that of the UHPLC. Indeed, the h(min) values were in the same range with both strategies and were between 2.2 and 2.8, but u(opt) was increased by a factor of >4 in UHPSFC conditions. Another obvious advantage of UHPSFC over UHPLC is related to the generated backpressure, which is significantly lower in the presence of a supercritical or subcritical fluid. However, the upper pressure limit of the UHPSFC system was only \u223c400 bar vs. \u223c1000 bar in the UHPLC system, which prevents the use of highly organic mobile phases at high flow rates in UHPSFC. Second, the impact of reducing the particle size (from 3.5 to 1.7 \u03bcm) was evaluated in both UHPLC and UHPSFC conditions. The effect of frictional heating on the selectivity was demonstrated in UHPLC and that of fluid density or decompression cooling was highlighted in UHPSFC. However, in both cases, a change in selectivity was observed for only a limited number of compounds. Third, various types of column chemistries packed with 1.7 \u03bcm particles were evaluated in both UHPLC and UHPSFC conditions using a model mixture of acidic, neutral and basic compounds. It has been shown that more drastic changes in selectivity were obtained using UHPSFC columns compared to those obtained by changing UHPLC columns. In addition, there was a good complementarity between the two separation modes. Finally, by combining the use of small particles with supercritical fluids as a mobile phase, it was possible to achieve the analysis of pharmaceutical compounds in less than 1 min or to attain a peak capacity of more than 250 in approximately 40 min, both with a high degree of repeatability.", 
    "43": "The Nuss procedure for the correction of Pectus Excavatum (PE) is associated with intense postoperative pain. Our strategy to control early postoperative pain is to combine epidural with intravenous analgesia. Our aim was to analyse our pain control strategy by reviewing all the PE cases treated at our institution. Sixty consecutive patients, aged between 12 and 26 years old, received the PE operation at our institution from January, 2007 to September, 2010. The median age was 16 (12-27) with a male/female ratio of about 7/1. An epidural catheter was employed in all the cases, with 38 patients (63%) requiring additional drugs to control pain, which remained in place for 74 hours (72-96). The pain score was higher in male patients, but lower in those younger than 16 years old. Moreover, patients that consumed benzodiazepines had a significant decrease in cumulative opioid intake (P = 0.0408). Both gender and age had an impact on pain control, while we noticed a synergistic effect between opiates and tranquillizers.", 
    "44": "Benzodiazepines potentiate \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) activity and are widely prescribed to treat anxiety, insomnia, and seizure disorders. Unfortunately, clinical use of benzodiazepines (BZs) is severely limited by tolerance. The mechanisms leading to BZ tolerance are unknown. BZs bind at the interface between an \u03b1 and \u03b3 subunit of GABA(A)Rs, preferentially enhancing synaptic receptors largely composed of \u03b1(1-3, 5), \u03b23, and \u03b32 subunits. Using confocal imaging and patch-clamp approaches, we show that treatment with the BZ flurazepam decreases GABA(A)R surface levels and the efficacy of neuronal inhibition in hippocampal neurons. A dramatic decrease in surface and total levels of \u03b12 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs occurred within 24 h of flurazepam treatment, whereas GABA(A)Rs incorporating \u03b11 subunits showed little alteration. The GABA(A)R surface depletion could be reversed by treatment with the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788. Coincident with decreased GABA(A)R surface levels, flurazepam treatment reduced miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude, which returned to control levels with acute Ro 15-1788 treatment. GABA(A)R endocytosis and insertion rates were unchanged by flurazepam treatment. Treatment with leupeptin restored flurazepam lowered receptor surface levels, strongly suggesting that flurazepam increases lysosomal degradation of GABA(A)Rs. Together, these data suggest that flurazepam exposure enhances degradation of \u03b12 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs after their removal from the plasma membrane, leading to a reduction in inhibitory synapse size and number along with a decrease in the efficacy of synaptic inhibition. These reported subtype-specific changes in GABA(A)R trafficking provide significant mechanistic insight into the initial neuroadaptive responses occurring with BZ treatment.", 
    "45": "Adverse drug events (ADE) are important causes of impairment of the quality of care for inpatients and therefore should be identified and characterized. Thus, lists of triggers were developed, including the proposal by the Institute for Healthcare Improvement. We analyzed the application of these triggers in a university hospital, with the cooperation of pharmacy and medical students, field training, standardized forms and manuals. Here, we present the process of application and performance of these triggers in a teaching hospital. The information on the triggers and ADE were collected through a retrospective chart review of patients discharged from January to June 2008. Four hundred and ninety-seven triggers were identified in 177 charts, and each chart had 2.33 (SD = 2.7) triggers on average. The most frequent triggers were: \"antiemetic\" (72.1/100 charts), \"abrupt cessation of medication\" (70.0/100 charts) and \"over-sedation, drowsiness, numbness, lethargy, hypotension and fall\" (34.6/100 charts). The most effective triggers for capturing ADE were \"benzodiazepine antagonist\", \"antidiarrheal\" and \"rash\", which, when identified in charts, were related to an event. The ADE most commonly found were related to the triggers, \"abrupt cessation of medication\" (8.3/100 charts), \"antiemetic\" (4.6/100 charts), \"rash\" and \"anti-allergy\" (2.1/100 charts). These results may help to decide which triggers are more useful in each situation.",

Prolactin levels were higher in the patients treated with olanzapine compared with in those treated with clozapine at study start, but there were no differences in the other parameters between the treatment groups at study start. In the patients remaining on their medication all 8 years, the glucose level increased over time in the clozapine group, but not in the olanzapine group, whereas body mass index and lipids were unchanged over time in both treatment groups.",

    "50": "Alcohol dependence has two distinct clinical features: (1) Physiological Dependence (PD), which characterizes the pharmacological tolerance that alcohol progressively induces in the brain and (2) Alcohol Addiction (AA), which is the behavioral conditioning of alcohol drinking resulting from the chronic activation of the reward system. PD results from a progressive imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission systems and leads to the occurrence of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS), which is prevented by benzodiazepines in cases of alcohol cessation. AA is considered to persist much longer and results from a disruption of the dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway, which is treated by anticraving drugs. Relapse in alcohol dependence is usually considered to be the result of AA. However, 50% of the relapses in alcohol occur within the first month after alcohol cessation. During this period, it has been shown that many patients experience anxious symptoms that have been neurobiologically related to withdrawal symptoms and PD. Thus, we hypothesize that early relapses are more the consequence of late symptoms of PD than AA. From this standpoint, we propose that prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines may reduce the first-month relapse rate.",

Mean total healthcare costs increased by $2334 between the pretreatment and post-treatment periods (from $4637 [SD=$9840] to $6971 [$17,002]; p<0.01); costs of accident-related encounters and other care that was possibly related to use of benzodiazepines increased by an average of $1099 ($1757 [$7656] vs $2856 [$14,836]; p=0.03).", 
    "64": "Healthcare costs increase in patients with GAD beginning long-term (\u2265 90 days) treatment with a benzodiazepine anxiolytic; a substantial proportion of this increase is attributable to care associated with accidents and other known sequelae of long-term benzodiazepine use.",

    "70": "Today's understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of delirium is still limited, but there are several promising hypotheses. It is believed that biomarkers sensitive to death of neurons or glial cells indicate delirium. Several neurotransmitters are considered to be involved in the state of delirium, with greatest emphasis on acetylcholine and dopamine acting in opposite ways; acetylcholine reduces, while dopamine increases neuron excitability. Other neurotransmitters that probably play a role in the pathogenesis of delirium are GABA, glutamate and monoamines. Sepsis leading to systemic inflammatory response syndrome often presents with delirium and perhaps is the most common causal factor for delirium in intensive care unit; sedatives and analgesics are also common iatrogenic risk factors. Patients receiving benzodiazepines are more likely to have postoperative delirium than those who do not. Postoperative cognitive changes are more common in older than in younger patients, and they can be categorized as postoperative delirium, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and dementia. The mechanisms responsible for postoperative cognitive changes are not fully understood, but it is certain that they are multifactorial. Risk factors may be associated with patient characteristics, type of surgery and type of anesthesia.", 
    "71": "Delirium is a common problem in intensive care patients, frequently underdiagnosed and resulting in prolonged hospital stay and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. On the other hand, reversibility of the condition points to the importance of prevention, early diagnosis and immediate therapy. Management strategy is directed to nonpharmacological interventions as preventive measures and pharmacological treatment, which includes typical and atypical neuroleptics. Delirium management includes haloperidol as the first line medication, but also olanzapine and risperidone as atypical neuroleptics. Benzodiazepines are used in delirium caused by alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "72": "Essential Palatal tremor (EPT) is a rare disorder presenting as unilateral or bilateral rhythmic involuntary movements of the soft palate. There is mention of the utility of benzodiazepines like clonazepam probably because of their gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) agonistic property. But no reports are available for the same. Here we report a 30-year old married female patient who presented with the complaints of pain in the lower part of face, behind the ears, back side of neck and clicking sound in her. General physical examination (GPE) revealed symmetrical rhythmic flapping movements of the soft palate and the uvula. Central nervous system (CNS) examination did not reveal any focal deficits and Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was normal. She was diagnosed as having EPT and treated successfully with clonazepam.",

Refractory subjects were those who reported persistent symptoms of anxiety and showed suboptimal response in the Hamilton-anxiety scale (HAM-A\u00a0\u2265\u00a016) after a standard dose regimen of anxiolytics other than pregabalin, alone or in combination, over 6\u00a0months. The pregabalin arm was documented with data extracted from patients who received pregabalin in the study for the first time, added or replacing the existing therapy. In the UC arm, treatment might include one or more of the following: a serotonin selective reuptake inhibitor, a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, other anti-depressants, a benzodiazepine or an anti-epileptic drug other than pregabalin. The time horizon of the modelling was 6\u00a0months in the base-case scenario, and the National Health System perspective was chosen to calculate costs. Effectiveness was expressed as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, which were derived using the EQ-5D questionnaire, at baseline and end-of-trial visits. Results of the CEA model was expressed as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping techniques was also carried out to obtain the cost-effectiveness plane and the corresponding acceptability curve.",

    "81": "Metabolic abnormalities are serious adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic treatment. This study aims to determine the effects of adjunctive aripiprazole on metabolic profiles among patients receiving treatment with atypical antipsychotics, and to examine whether these effects are different from that of pre-existing atypical antipsychotics. In the 8-week open-label trial, aripiprazole was added to patients who were receiving treatment with atypical antipsychotics and had experienced weight gain or dyslipidemia. The dosage of pre-existing atypical antipsychotics was fixed, while the dosage of aripiprazole ranged from 5 to 20 mg/day during the study period. Metabolic profiles, including body weight, body mass index (BMI), plasma levels of fasting glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and adiponectin, were measured at baseline and week 8. As a result, 43 subjects (16 males and 27 females, mean age: 37.8\u00b110.8 years) completed the study. The pre-existing antipsychotics were olanzapine (n=12), risperidone (n=19), quetiapine (n=6) and amisulpiride (n=6). The mean dosage of adjunctive aripiprazole was 9.9\u00b13.2 mg/day. After the aripiprazole-augmented regimen for 8 weeks, patients treated with olanzapine had significant decreases in body weight, BMI and triglyceride levels, and had significant increases in adiponectin levels. For patients treated with other atypical antipsychotics, none of the metabolic parameters significantly changed after administering aripiprazole. In conclusion, aripiprazole-augmented treatment might be beneficial for the metabolic regulation of patients being treated with a stable dose of olanzapine, but not for those treated with other atypical antipsychotics. A long-term, randomized, double-blind controlled design is suggested to confirm these findings.",

All patients received 4 \u03bcg/kg per body weight alfentanil for analgesia and 3 L of supplemental oxygen. Oxygen saturation (SpO\u2082) was measured by pulse oximetry (POX), and capnography (PcCO\u2082) was continuously measured using a combined dedicated sensor at the ear lobe. Instances of apnea resulting in measures such as stimulation of the patient, a chin lift, a mask maneuver, or withholding of sedation were recorded. PcCO\u2082 values (as a parameter of sedation-induced hypoventilation) were compared between groups at the following distinct time points: baseline, maximal rise, termination of the procedure and 5 min after termination of the procedure. The number of patients in both study groups who regained baseline PcCO\u2082 values (\u00b1 1.5 mmHg) five minutes after the procedure was determined.",

Therefore, 83 patients (mean age 62 \u00b1 13 years) were successfully randomized to receive propofol (n = 42) or midazolam (n = 41) for sedation. Most of the patients were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II [16 (38%) in the midazolam group and 15 (32%) in the propofol group] and ASA III [14 (33%) and 13 (32%) in the midazolam and propofol groups, respectively]. A mean dose of 5 (4-7) mg of IV midazolam and 131 (70-260) mg of IV propofol was used during the procedure in the corresponding study arms. The mean SpO\u2082 at baseline (%) was 99 \u00b1 1 for the midazolam group and 99 \u00b1 1 for the propofol group. No cases of hypoxemia (SpO\u2082 < 85%) or apnea were recorded. However, an increase in PcCO\u2082 that indicated alveolar hypoventilation occurred in both groups after administration of the first drug and was not detected with pulse oximetry alone. The mean interval between the initiation of sedation and the time when the PcCO\u2082 value increased to more than 2 mmHg was 2.8 \u00b1 1.3 min for midazolam and 2.8 \u00b1 1.1 min for propofol. The mean maximal rise was similar for both drugs: 8.6 \u00b1 3.7 mmHg for midazolam and 7.4 \u00b1 3.2 mmHg for propofol.

    "88": "Red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for massive hemorrhage induce systemic ischemic-reperfusion and influence the disposition and pharmacological activity of drugs as a result of a reduction in the level of expression and activity of cytochrome P450s (P450). It was reported that, when organ-preserving solutions are exposed to carbon monoxide (CO), the treatment was effective in suppressing the postreperfusion reduction in renal P450 levels in cases of kidney transplantation. Therefore, we hypothesized that transfusions with RBC that contain bound CO (CO-RBC) would protect the hepatic level of rat P450 during a massive hemorrhage, compared with plasma expanders and RBC resuscitation. To achieve this, we created 40% hemorrhagic-shock model rats, followed by resuscitation, with use of recombinant human serum albumin, RBCs, and CO-RBCs. At 1 hour after resuscitation, the expressions of hepatic P450 isoforms (1A2, 2C11, 2E1, and 3A2) were significantly decreased in the RBC resuscitation group, compared with the sham group. Such alterations in hepatic P450 significantly resulted in an increase in the plasma concentrations of substrate drugs (caffeine [1A2], tolbutamide [2C11], chlorzoxazone [2E1], and midazolam [3A2]) for each P450 isoform, and thus, the hypnotic action of midazolam could be significantly prolonged. Of interest, the reductions in hepatic P450 activity observed in the RBC group were significantly suppressed by CO-RBC resuscitation, and consequently, the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs and the pharmacological action of midazolam remained at levels similar to those under sham conditions. These results indicate that CO-RBC resuscitation has considerable potential in terms of achieving safe and useful drug therapy during massive hemorrhages.",

Two liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry methods for simultaneous detection and quantification of amphetamines, designer amphetamines, benzoylecgonine, benzodiazepines, opiates, and opioids in urine were developed and validated. A 500-\u03bcL aliquot of urine was diluted and fortified with an internal standard solution. After enzymatic cleavage, online extraction was performed by an ion-exchange/reversed-phase turbulent flow column. Separation was achieved by using a reversed-phase column and gradient elution. For detection, a Thermo Fisher TSQ Quantum Ultra Accurate Mass tandem mass spectrometer with positive electrospray ionization was used, and the analytes were measured in multiple-reaction monitoring mode detecting two transitions per precursor ion. The total run time for both methods was about 15 min. Validation was performed according to the guidelines of the Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry. The results of matrix effect determination were between 78% and 116%. The limits of detection and quantification for all drugs, except zopiclone, were less than 10 ng/mL and less than 25 ng/mL, respectively.

All the animals exposed to SE were immunopositive to pimonidazole, but a different scenario emerged during epileptogenesis when a decrease in pimonidazole-immunostained cells occurred from 7 to 14 days, so that only 1 out of 4 rats presented with pimonidazole-immunopositive cells. Pimonidazole-immunoreactive cells robustly reappeared at 21 days post-SE induction when all animals (7 out of 7) had developed spontaneous recurrent seizures. Specific neuronal markers revealed that immunopositivity to pimonidazole was present in cells identified by neuropeptide Y (NPY) or somatostatin antibodies. At variance, neurons immunopositive to parvalbumin or cholecystokinin were not immunopositive to pimonidazole. Pimonidazole-immunopositive neurons expressed remarkable immunoreactivity to hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). Interestingly, surgical samples obtained from pharmacoresistant patients showed neurons co-labeled by HIF-1\u03b1 and NPY antibodies. These interneurons, along with parvalbumin-positive interneurons that were negative to HIF-1\u03b1, showed immunopositivity to markers of cell damage, such as high-mobility group box 1 in the cytoplasm and cleaved caspase-3 in the nucleus. These findings suggest that interneurons are continuously endangered in rodent and human epileptogenic tissue. The presence of hypoxia and cell damage markers in NPY interneurons of rats and patients presenting with recurrent seizures indicates a mechanism of selective vulnerability in a specific neuronal subpopulation.",

    "116": "About 34% of specimens from the intake visit and 25% of those from the FAP assessment tested positive for an illicit drug. The most common drug detected was marijuana (90% of positive specimens), followed by opioids (18%), cocaine (5%), benzodiazepines (3%), and methadone (3%). None tested positive for amphetamines. The majority of women (53%) who tested positive for an illicit substance at intake also tested positive at the FAP assessment.",

Those providing smoking-cessation services to pregnant women may want to be prepared to assist with obtaining services for other drug use as well.", 
    "118": "Cocaine abuse and dependence is a major public health problem that continues to challenge medication-based treatment. Buspirone (Buspar) is a clinically available, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic medication that acts on both serotonin and dopamine systems. In recent preclinical studies, acute buspirone treatment reduced cocaine self-administration at doses that did not also decrease food-reinforced behavior in rhesus monkeys (Bergman et al, 2012). The present study evaluated the effectiveness of chronic buspirone treatment on self-administration of cocaine and food. Five adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to self-administer cocaine and food during four 1-h daily sessions under a second-order schedule of reinforcement (FR2 [VR 16:S]). Buspirone (0.32 and 0.56 mg/kg/h) was administered intravenously through one lumen of a double-lumen catheter every 20 min for 23 h each day for 7-10 consecutive days. Each buspirone treatment period was followed by saline control treatment until drug- and food-maintained responding returned to baseline levels. Buspirone significantly reduced responding maintained by cocaine, and shifted the dose-effect curve downwards. Buspirone had minimal effects on food-maintained responding. In cocaine discrimination studies, buspirone (0.1-0.32 mg/kg, IM) did not antagonize the discriminative stimulus and rate-altering effects of cocaine in four of six monkeys. These findings indicate that buspirone selectively attenuates the reinforcing effects of cocaine in a nonhuman primate model of cocaine self-administration, and has variable effects on cocaine discrimination.",

    "124": "Vulnerability for anxiety and depressive disorders is thought to have origins in early life and is increasingly recognized to involve deficits in GABAergic neurotransmission. Mice that were rendered heterozygous for the \u03b32 subunit gene of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) show behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine and pharmacologic features expected of a mouse model of melancholic anxious depression, including reduced survival of adult-born hippocampal neurons. Here we embarked on elucidating the developmental substrate underlying this phenotype, focusing on the Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swim Test as relevant behavioral paradigms. In a first series of experiments using hemizygous tamoxifen-induced genetic inactivation of a floxed \u03b32 genomic locus we show that reducing the gene dosage at postnatal days (P)13/14 but not P27/28 results in altered behavior in both of these tests in adulthood, reminiscent of the anxious-depressive phenotype previously described for global heterozygous mice. However, in contrast to global heterozygous mice, the behavioral changes induced by \u03b32 subunit knockdown at P13/14 occurred without changes in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, indicating that altered neurogenesis is not an absolute prerequisite for anxiety- and depression-related behavior in this model. In a separate series of experiments using a pharmacological approach, acute but transient potentiation of GABA(A)Rs with diazepam uncovered distinct developmental vulnerabilities for altered behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze and Forced Swim Test, respectively. Specifically, diazepam given during P10-16 but not during later weeks resulted in increased anxiety-like behavior in adulthood, while diazepam administered during P29-35 but not earlier nor later resulted in increased immobility behavior in adulthood. We conclude that anxiety-like behavior in the Elevated Plus Maze and behavioral despair-like immobility in the Forced Swim Test are controlled by separate postnatal critical periods characterized by distinct developmental sensitivity to manipulation of GABAergic transmission via \u03b32 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs.",

This observation suggests the potential for significant clinical uncertainty concerning the role of benzodiazepines in PTSD, which was examined by characterizing prescribing variation in the VHA across multiple levels of geographic aggregation and over time.", 
    "130": "Veterans with PTSD were identified from national VHA administrative data in fiscal years 1999 through 2009. Benzodiazepine prescribing frequencies were aggregated across 137 medical centers, 21 networks, and four U.S. regions, and the extent of variation was characterized at each level.

In the absence of a laccase mediator, the original concentrations of 10 \u03bcg mL(-1) of nitrazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and oxazepam decreased by 27.3%, 45.6%, 18.6% and 18.7%, respectively, after 48 h treatment using the purified enzyme, whereas the removal percentages for clobazam, chlordiazepoxide, and lorazepam were only 5.6%, 3.6%, and 4.1%, respectively. Among the laccase mediators, HBT was the most efficient compound, increasing the degradation percentages of nitrazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and oxazepam to 73%, 88.1%, 61.4%, and 71.2%, respectively. The removal percentages of clobazam, chlordiazepoxide, and lorazepam was increased to 8.2%, 4.7%, and 6.5%, respectively, when the laccase-HBT system was used.

    "140": "A prospective cohort study of 157 mixed-diagnosis highest acuity patients was conducted in a large general intensive care unit (ICU). Data on four groups of risk factors (clinical, acute psychological, socio-demographic and chronic health) were collected during ICU admissions.

The strongest clinical risk factor for PTSD was longer duration of sedation (regression coefficient = 0.69 points (95% CI: 0.12, 1.27) per day, scale = 0 to 51). There was a strong association between depression at three months and receiving benzodiazepines in the ICU (mean difference between groups = 6.73 points (95% CI: 1.42, 12.06), scale = 0 to 60). Use of inotropes or vasopressors was correlated with anxiety, and corticosteroids with better physical quality of life.",

These findings suggest that psychological interventions, along with pharmacological modifications, could help reduce poor outcomes, including PTSD, after intensive care.", 
    "143": "Moderate reductions in synaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) have been associated with an enhanced defensive behavioral reactivity to mild threat, sensitive to diazepam. We here tested whether a deficit in \u03b12 subunit-containing GABAergic synapses is sufficient to cause this anxiety-related phenotype and to prevent its attenuation by the benzodiazepine. Wild type (\u03b12+/+), heterozygous (\u03b12+/-) and homozygous (\u03b12-/-) knock-out littermates were tested in the free-choice exploratory (FCE) and the light/dark choice (LDC) paradigms. \u03b12-/- mice, double mutant \u03b11H101R\u03b12-/- and \u03b13H126R\u03b12-/- mice, which combine a lack of \u03b12-GABA(A)Rs with point-mutated diazepam-insensitive either \u03b11H101R or \u03b13H126R-GABA(A)Rs, and double point-mutated \u03b11H101R\u03b12H101R and \u03b11H101R\u03b13H126R mice were used to uncover the GABA(A)R subtype(s) mediating the drug effects. Data show that in the FCE, \u03b12-/- mice exhibited more retractions (i.e. risk assessment) and longer latencies to first occurrence into the novel compartment and less transitions and time spent inside it in comparison to \u03b12+/- and \u03b12+/+ mice. In the LDC, \u03b12-/- mice visited and spent less time in the lit box and stayed longer in the tunnel than the other two groups. Minor differences were found between \u03b12+/- and \u03b12+/+ mice in the two paradigms. Diazepam (1.5mg/kg per os) normalized retractions and latencies in the FCE in \u03b12-/- and \u03b13H126R\u03b12-/- mice, but not in \u03b11H101R\u03b12-/- mice. The same drug treatment failed to attenuate behavioral aversion in both paradigms in all mutants with impaired \u03b12-GABA(A)R function. These results reveal \u03b12-containing GABA(A)Rs as key molecular determinants in the regulation of anxiety-related responses elicited by exposure to relative novelty and mild threat. In the absence of these receptors, diazepam through activation of \u03b11-GABA(A)Rs remains effective in reducing risk assessment, but not behavioral aversion.", 
    "144": "Previous studies have demonstrated that the knockdown or knockout of the three Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) isoforms, NCX1, NCX2, and NCX3, worsens ischemic brain damage. This suggests that the activation of these antiporters exerts a neuroprotective action against stroke damage. However, drugs able to increase the activity of NCXs are not yet available. We have here succeeded in synthesizing a new compound, named neurounina-1 (7-nitro-5-phenyl-1-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-2(3H)-one), provided with an high lipophilicity index and able to increase NCX activity. Ca(2+) radiotracer, Fura-2 microfluorimetry, and patch-clamp techniques revealed that neurounina-1 stimulated NCX1 and NCX2 activities with an EC(50) in the picomolar to low nanomolar range, whereas it did not affect NCX3 activity. Furthermore, by using chimera strategy and site-directed mutagenesis, three specific molecular determinants of NCX1 responsible for neurounina-1 activity were identified in the \u03b1-repeats. Interestingly, NCX3 became responsive to neurounina-1 when both \u03b1-repeats were replaced with the corresponding regions of NCX1. In vitro studies showed that 10 nM neurounina-1 reduced cell death of primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation followed by reoxygenation. Moreover, in vitro, neurounina-1 also reduced \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release, enhanced GABA(A) currents, and inhibited both glutamate release and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. More important, neurounina-1 proved to have a wide therapeutic window in vivo. Indeed, when administered at doses of 0.003 to 30 \u03bcg/kg i.p., it was able to reduce the infarct volume of mice subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion even up to 3 to 5 hours after stroke onset. Collectively, the present study shows that neurounina-1 exerts a remarkable neuroprotective effect during stroke and increases NCX1 and NCX2 activities.", 
    "145": "Pavlovian stimuli invigorate ongoing instrumental action, a phenomenon termed the Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) effect. Acute stressors can markedly enhance the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), and CRF injection into the nucleus accumbens increases the PIT effect. However, it is unknown whether acute stressors by themselves would amplify the PIT effect. Here, we examined the effects of acute stressors on PIT. Rats first received Pavlovian and instrumental training, and then the impact of the Pavlovian stimuli on instrumental responding was analyzed in the subsequent PIT test. Acute stressors were applied prior to the PIT test. Because the effects of acute stressors critically depend on stressor type and time of day, we used two acute stressors that involved one or several distinct stressors (denoted here as \"single\" vs. \"multiple\" stressors) applied either in the light or the dark period of the light:dark cycle. The results revealed that single and multiple stressors applied in the light period did not alter the PIT effect--that is, the ability of an appetitive Pavlovian stimulus to enhance leverpressing--or the basal leverpress rate. When applied in the dark period, single and multiple stressors also did not alter the PIT effect, but they did markedly reduce the basal leverpress rate. Diazepam pretreatment did not counteract the declines in basal instrumental responding in the PIT test that were induced by either a single or multiple stressors. Our findings suggest that acute stressors were unable to amplify the incentive salience of reward-predictive Pavlovian stimuli to activate instrumental responding, but, depending on the time of day of stressor exposure, they did reduce basal instrumental responding.", 
    "146": "Benzodiazepines have a broad spectrum of clinical applications including sedation, anti-anxiety, and anticonvulsive therapy. At the cellular level, benzodiazepines are allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors; they increase the efficacy of inhibition in neuronal networks by prolonging the duration of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. This mechanism of action predicts that benzodiazepines reduce the frequency of inhibition-driven network oscillations, consistent with observations from human and animal EEG. However, most of existing data are restricted to frequency bands below \u223c30 Hz. Recent data suggest that faster cortical network rhythms are critically involved in several behavioral and cognitive tasks. We therefore analyzed diazepam effects on a large range of cortical network oscillations in freely moving mice, including theta (4-12 Hz), gamma (40-100 Hz) and fast gamma (120-160 Hz) oscillations. We also investigated diazepam effects over the coupling between theta phase and the amplitude fast oscillations. We report that diazepam causes a global slowing of oscillatory activity in all frequency domains. Oscillation power was changed differently for each frequency domain, with characteristic differences between active wakefulness, slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Cross-frequency coupling strength, in contrast, was mostly unaffected by diazepam. Such state- and frequency-dependent actions of benzodiazepines on cortical network oscillations may be relevant for their specific cognitive effects. They also underline the strong interaction between local network oscillations and global brain states.", 
    "147": "Some treatments are inappropriate for patients with cognitive decline. We analyse their use in 500 patients and present a literature review.", 
    "148": "Benzodiazepines produce dependence, and reduce attention, memory, and motor ability. They can cause disinhibition or aggressive behaviour, facilitate the appearance of delirium, and increase accident and mortality rates in people older than 60. In subjects over 65, low systolic blood pressure is associated with cognitive decline. Maintaining this figure between 130 and 140 mm Hg (145 in patients older than 80) is recommended. Hypocholesterolaemia < 160 mg/dl is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, aggressiveness, and suicide; HDL-cholesterol<40 mg/dl is associated with memory loss and increased vascular and mortality risks. Old age is a predisposing factor for developing cognitive disorders or delirium when taking opioids. The risks of prescribing anticholinesterases and memantine to patients with non-Alzheimer dementia that is not associated with Parkinson disease, mild cognitive impairment, or psychiatric disorders probably outweigh the benefits. Anticholinergic drugs acting preferentially on the peripheral system can also induce cognitive side effects. Practitioners should be aware of steroid-induced dementia and steroid-induced psychosis, and know that risk of delirium increases with polypharmacy. Of 500 patients with cognitive impairment, 70.4% were on multiple medications and 42% were taking benzodiazepines. Both conditions were present in 74.3% of all suspected iatrogenic cases.", 
    "149": "Polypharmacy should be avoided, if it is not essential, especially in elderly patients and those with cognitive impairment. Benzodiazepines, opioids and anticholinergics often elicit cognitive and behavioural disorders. Moreover, systolic blood pressure must be kept above 130 mm Hg, total cholesterol levels over 160 mg/dl, and HDL-cholesterol over 40 mg/dl in this population.", 
    "150": "Why are some individuals more likely than others to develop a posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the face of similar levels of trauma exposure? Monitoring the traumatic process combining the antecedents, the determinants of the psychic trauma and the acute symptoms can clarify the causes of the final onset of a chronic repetition syndrome. Epidemiologic research has clarified risk factors that increase the likelihood of PTSD after exposure to a potentially traumatic event. PTSD is an interaction between a subject, a traumatogenic factor and a social context. With each epidemiological, psychopathological and more particularly neurogenetic study, we will expand on the impact of these interactions on the therapeutic treatment of psycho-traumatised persons.", 
    "151": "Most studies have shown that unrelated to the traumatic event, additional risk factors for developing PTSD include younger age at the time of the trauma, female gender, lower social economic statuts, lack of social support, premorbid personality characteristics and preexisting anxiety or depressive disorders increase the risk of PTSD. The psychic trauma is firmly attached to the repetition and the previous traumas are as many risks of developing a subsequent PTSD in the wake of a new trauma: PTSD in adults may represent a prolonged symptomatic reaction to prior traumatic assault, child abuse and childhood adversities. Related to the traumatic event, the organic pain, the traumatic brain injury, but also the sight of blood can lead to a trauma being considered as more serious or more harmful to life. It is useful to recognize the acute reactions of exhaustion stress as they can guide both the pharmacotherapeutic and the psychotherapeutic treatment thanks to debriefings. Even though the majority of people with acute stress disorder subsequently develop PTSD, the current data indicate that too many people can develop PTSD without initially displaying acute stress disorder. Though peritraumatic dissociation and peritraumatic distress have emerged as the strongest predictors for PTSD and have to be treated as soon as possible with the debriefing or the pharmacology; initial evidence suggests the potential benefits of early intervention, shortly after the trauma, and psychological debriefing has received increasing interest from the scientific community. However the Anglo-Saxon techniques (such as Critical Incident Stress Debriefing also known as the Mitchell model) are in total contrast with the French approach. In the first case the emotional response is controlled to ensure the pursuit of the group action, whilst in the second case the debriefing concerns patients with acute symptoms in order to prevent the development of a PTSD structuring of the latter. The facts, emotions and thoughts are not partitioned but inter-linked, thus enabling a fragmentation of the traumatic experience. In the face of the annihilation experienced, speech production by the subject is restored linking the person to the human community, once abandoned. However, debate continues on the efficacy of single session debriefing in the prevention of PTSD. At the time of the acute stress reactions, benzodiazepines are contraindicated at this stage as they promote dissociation and ulterior revivals. On the other hand, treatment with propranolol could be proposed: a two or three week course of propranolol begun in the aftermath of a traumatic event can reduce subsequent PTSD symptoms.", 
    "152": "A genetic polymorphism is evidently at work in the development of a PTSD via the regulation of the expression of genes of interest to the serotoninergic system and the adrenocorticotropic axis. The 5-HTTLPR (promoter region of SLC6A4 witch encodes the serotonin transporter) constitutes a genetic candidate region that may modulate emotional responses to traumatic events. The interaction between variation at the 5HTTLPR and stressful life events could predict depression and PTSD. Considering the dopaminergic pathway, the A1 allele coding the type 2 dopaminergic receptor is associated with a severe comorbidity of PTSD with the presence of somatic disorders, anxiety, social change and depression. For noradrenergic neuromodulation, an interaction between the polymorphism of gene GABRA2 and the occurrence of PTSD is described whereas an interaction between the number of traumatic events and Val(158)Met polymorphism of the gene coding for catecholamine-o-methyltransferase has also been found. The role of polymorphisms in FKBP5 (a co-chaperone of hsp 90 which binds to the glucocorticoid receptor) in predicting PTSD too, with a gene-by-environment point of view. These gene-by-environment studies are needed to focus more on distinct endophenotypes and influences from environmental factors. If several candidate genes are involved, a weighting of susceptibility to such and such a neurological regulation system will imply various endophenotypes. According to the monoamine predominantly incriminated, PTSD can take on a more hyper-vegetative clinical expression linked with noradrenergic overuse. Differently, avoidance behaviour and the depressive aspect invoke more a modification of the serotoninergic modulation whilst posttraumatic psychotic reactions question the role of dopaminergic pathways. Neuroscientific discoveries interesting the biological support of PTSD can thus modify our view of the conception of the disorder in relation to different therapeutic prospects.", 
    "153": "Chronic PTSD can manifest itself in different clinical forms. The repetition syndrome can appear a long time after the traumatic event, following a paucisymptomatic latency period, which can last several years or even decades. The absence of complaints from the patient is common, the latter suffering in silence. Often other comorbid disorders and other complaints arise sooner than the clinical picture. Thus a depressive episode characterised as drug-seeking behaviour is frequently encountered. The therapeutic accompaniment traditionally combines a pharmacological and a psychotherapeutic treatment even if recommendations are rare. A posttraumatic stress disorder is never just a coincidence. The different stages of the evolution and the establishment of a PTSD are the expression of an interaction between the outside and the inner self. Despite a known progression of the posttraumatic stress disorder, this deleterious evolution is far from being a foregone conclusion. On the contrary, several levels of prevention are possible at each stage of its structuration to propose treatments to subjects who are vulnerable and/or present symptoms. No neurobiological study has yet found a biological marker, which would apparently and inevitably destine a subject to structure, a posttraumatic stress disorder in reaction to a stress. Conversely, the psychopathological study finds afterwards that a particular subject has necessarily built a traumatic repetition syndrome according to the concordance of significant data relative to his/her history. The event strikes a repression or an anterior biographical deadlock and of which the thematic questions the fundamentals of human culture in its emancipation with nature, like the question of death and its consequences: bereavement, parentality, transgenerational transmission and organicity often linked to the illness. A therapeutic proposal constitutes an environmental factor par excellence which can be either protective or deleterious. If the traumatic repetition syndrome has been known since Antiquity, the birth of PTSD has followed the chronology of the DSM according to the sociopolitical contexts encountered. A PTSD does not occur by chance: the conditions of possibility of the trauma are established by genetic and psychological determinants interactively integrated at the heart of a social context. After the increase in a psychotraumatic interest in international publications since the 1980s, a fight against over-victimisation seems to be setting in. The advances in genetic and neuroimaging techniques are in the process of superseding psychometric studies in terms of reliability and validity; maybe we should see in this social evolution the changes of tomorrow concerning the clinical of PTSD and its treatment. The healing of the psycho-traumatised subject cannot just be established on the passive status of victim, which would be detrimental to reflection and ultimately reconstruction: the rebirth of the subject will require active commitment, which could distract from the deadly repetition. Whilst the confrontation with death resembled nonsense, the subject will question the psychotraumatic determinants of his/her life history to reinstate this tragic event within a search for meaning. Such restructuring is built on the intersubjectivity of the clinical relationship, which occurs within a social context. PTSD is a pathology which interacts with the societal context: on the one hand the trauma is established on the brutal reconsideration of social values which seem immutable and on the other hand, the clinical and nosographical concept of PTSD is changing with the evolution of society.",

Sixty healthy patients who were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) group I or II were enrolled and we recorded their personal details, the amount of drug used, their degree of satisfaction, duration of operation, and haemodynamic and respiratory variables. The two groups were comparable. The amount of local anaesthetic (p=0.11) and the duration of operation did not differ significantly (p=0.32). The patients in the dexmedetomidine group had a slower heart rate, lower systolic and diastolic pressure, and cooperated better. There were no significant differences in their respiratory rates, bispectral index, and total volume of drugs used. We conclude that dexmedetomidine works as well as midazolam for outpatient dental procedures and can be used as an alternative to midazolam.",

    "174": "Among the noteworthy recent stories in the management and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the saga of the development of pharmacological inhibitors of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). Inhibiting CETP significantly raises plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which has long been considered a marker of reduced CVD risk. However, the first CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, showed a surprising increase in CVD events, despite a dramatic increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This paradox was explained by putative off-target effects not related to CETP inhibition that were specific to torcetrapib. Subsequently, three newer CETP inhibitors, namely dalcetrapib, anacetrapib, and evacetrapib, were at various phases of clinical development in 2012. Each of these had encouraging biochemical efficacy and safety profiles. Dalcetrapib even had human arterial imaging results that tended to look favorable. However, the dalcetrapib development program was recently terminated, presumably because interim analysis of a large CVD outcome trial indicated no benefit. These events raise important questions regarding the validity of the mechanism of CETP inhibition and the broader issue of whether pharmacological raising of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol itself is a useful strategy for CVD risk reduction.",

    "180": "Gabapentin is used for the treatment of hot flashes and neuropathic pain in breast cancer survivors, and is commonly used off-label for the treatment of anxiety. Yet, clinical trial evidence to support the use of gabapentin for anxiety symptoms is lacking. In a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial we compared 300 mg gabapentin versus 900 mg gabapentin versus placebo. Subjects were 420 breast cancer patients who had completed all chemotherapy cycles. Anxiety traits and current (state) anxiety were measured using the Speilberger Strait-Trait Anxiety Inventory at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks. Pain was measured at baseline using a 10-point scale. Analyses included analysis of covariance and ordinary least squares regression. At 4 weeks, state anxiety change scores were significantly better for gabapentin 300 and 900 mg (p = 0.005) compared to placebo. The magnitude of improvement was proportional to baseline state anxiety. At 8 weeks, the anxiolytic effects of gabapentin compared to placebo persisted (p < 0.005). We found no significant interactions. The lower dose (300 mg) was associated with the best treatment outcomes for all patients except those with the highest baseline anxiety. Given its similar pharmacology, efficacy in the treatment of hot flashes, and low cost, gabapentin may provide a low cost and parsimonious alternative treatment choice for breast cancer survivors presenting in primary care practices with anxiety symptoms. Gabapentin is effective for hot flashes, and, therefore, may provide therapeutic benefit for both anxiety and hot flashes at a generic drug price. For patients reluctant to take a controlled substance, such as a benzodiazepine, gabapentin may offer an alternative therapy. Similarly, patients with a history of substance use may benefit from gabapentin without risk of addiction or abuse. For cancer survivors experiencing both hot flashes and anxiety, gabapentin may provide a single effective treatment for both and is an alternative therapy for anxiety for patients unwilling to take a benzodiazepine or those with a history of substance use.", 
    "181": "This retrospective observational study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine (DEX) for children with heart failure.

A retrospective review of the charts for all children (up to 18 years of age) with signs and symptoms consistent with congestive heart failure who received DEX in our CVICU between April 2006 and April 2011 was performed. The patients were divided into two groups for study purposes: the DEX group of 21 patients, who received a DEX infusion together with other conventional sedation agents, and the control group of 23 patients, who received conventional sedation agents without the use of DEX. To evaluate the safety of DEX, physiologic data were collected including heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and inotrope score. To assess the efficacy of DEX, the amount and duration of concomitant sedation and analgesic infusions in both the DEX and control groups were examined. The numbers of rescue boluses for each category before the initiation of sedative infusion and during the sedative infusion also were examined. The baseline characteristics of the patients in the two groups were similar. There was no effect of DEX infusion on heart rate, MAP, or inotrope score at the termination of infusion. The daily amount of midazolam administered was significantly less during the last 24 h of DEX infusion in the DEX group than in the control group (p = 0.04). The daily amount of morphine infusion did not differ between the DEX and control groups during any period. The numbers of sedation and analgesic rescue boluses were lower in DEX group throughout the infusion. No other significant side effects were noted. Two patients in the DEX group had a 50 % or greater drop in MAP compared with baseline in the first 3 h after initiation of DEX infusion, whereas one patient had a 50 % or greater drop in heart rate compared with baseline in the first 3 h after initiation of DEX infusion. Administration of DEX for children with heart failure appears to be safe but should be used cautiously. Furthermore, DEX use is associated with a decreased opiate and benzodiazepine requirement for children with heart failure.", 
    "182": "Sarin, a potent organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitor, induces an array of toxic effects including convulsions. Many antidotal treatments contain anticonvulsants to block seizure activity and the ensuing brain damage. Magnesium sulfate (MGS) is used to suppress eclamptic seizures in pregnant women with hypertension and was shown to block kainate-induced convulsions. Magnesium sulfate was evaluated herein as an anticonvulsant against sarin poisoning and its efficacy was compared with the potent anticonvulsants midazolam (MDZ) and caramiphen (CRM). Rats were exposed to a convulsant dose of sarin (96 \u03bcg/kg, im) and 1 min later treated with the oxime TMB4 and atropine to increase survival. Five minutes after initiation of convulsions, MGS, CRM, or MDZ were administered. Attenuation of tonic-clonic convulsions was observed following all these treatments. However, radio-telemetric electro-corticography (ECoG) monitoring demonstrated sustained seizure activity in MGS-injected animals while this activity was completely blocked by MDZ and CRM. This disrupted brain activity was associated with marked increase in brain translocator protein levels, a marker for brain damage, measured 1 week following exposure. Additionally, histopathological analyses of MGS-treated group showed typical sarin-induced brain injury excluding the hippocampus that was partially protected. Our results clearly show that MGS demonstrated misleading features as an anticonvulsant against sarin-induced seizures. This stems from the dissociation observed between overt convulsions and seizure activity. Thus, the presence or absence of motor convulsions may be an unreliable indicator in the assessment of clinical status and in directing adequate antidotal treatments following exposure to nerve agents in battle field or terror attacks.", 
    "183": "HIV protease is a primary target for the design of virostatics. Screening of libraries of non-peptide low molecular weight compounds led to the identification of several new compounds that inhibit HIV PR in the low micromolar range. X-ray structure of the complex of one of them, a dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepinone derivative, showed that two molecules of the inhibitor bind to the PR active site. Covalent linkage of two molecules of such a compound by a two-carbon linker led to a decrease of the inhibition constant of the resulting compound by 3 orders of magnitude. Molecular modeling shows that these dimeric inhibitors form two crucial hydrogen bonds to the catalytic aspartates that are responsible for their improved activity compared to the monomeric parental building blocks. Dibenzo[b,e][1,4]diazepinone analogues might represent a potential new class of HIV PIs.",

Fifty-nine patients (44 males, age range 24-74) were included in the study, and breath, plasma and urine samples were collected following recovery, together with interview data. Analyses of breath and plasma samples were conducted with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. Urine was screened using immunochemical reagents and positive findings confirmed with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods. The following analytes were investigated: methadone, amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine, diazepam, oxazepam, morphine, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, buprenorphine and tetrahydrocannabinol. In 53 of the studied cases, recent intake of an abused substance prior to admission was reported. In 35 of these (66%), the breath analysis gave a positive finding. Identifications were based on correct chromatographic retention time and product ion ratios obtained in selected reaction monitoring mode. Generally, data from breath, plasma, urine and self-report were in agreement. Detected substances in breath included amphetamine, methamphetamine, buprenorphine, 6-acetylmorphine, morphine, codeine, methadone, tetrahydrocannabinol, diazepam, oxazepam and cocaine.

Despite the lack of data in the case of NA, clinical evidences suggest that SE survivors could suffer from neurological/cognitive deficits and impairments such as spontaneous recurrent seizures (epilepsy) after a latent period of epileptogenesis. It is beyond doubt that an effective and quick management of the initial seizures and prevention of SRBD are critical to prevent these long-term consequences, explaining why most experimental data are focusing on the 5-40min post-exposure time frame. However, in field conditions, treatment may be delayed and with the exception of NMDA receptor antagonists, currently no drug provides protection (against lethality, seizures, SRBD and neurological consequences) when seizures are left unabated for one hour or more. Ketamine (KET) is the only NMDA antagonist licensed as an injectable drug in different countries and remains an anesthetic of choice in some difficult field conditions. In this short review paper, after a presentation of some of the key points of the pathophysiology of NA-induced SE and a quick survey of the potential therapeutic avenues in the context of delayed treatment of NA-induced SE, we will review the recent data we obtained showing that KET, in combination with atropine sulfate (AS), with or without a benzodiazepine, considerably reduces soman-induced neuroinflammation, provides neuroprotection, histologically and functionally, and also positively modify soman-induced changes in brain metabolism. Finally, we will also mention some results from safety studies including those bringing evidence that, at difference with MK-801, KET does not impair thermoregulation and even seems to reduce AS-induced heat stress. All in all, KET, in combination, appears a good candidate for the out-of-hospital treatment of severe NA-induced SE.", 
    "208": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) safety profiles in pregnancy suggest that the risk of major malformations (MMs) cannot be considered simply as a \"class effect\". The aim of this paper was to review and update the available literature on the risks of MMs in women exposed to BDZs in the first trimester of pregnancy.", 
    "209": "PubMed was searched for English-language articles, from January 2001 to November 2011, introducing as keywords \"teratogens\", \" major malformation\", \"foetus\", \"infant\", \"newborn\", \"pregnancy\", in conjunction with \"benzodiazepines\" as a keyword or BDZ generic name as text words.", 
    "210": "Twelve studies were selected for the review. BDZ exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy seems not to be associated with an increasing risk of congenital MMs. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide should be considered drugs of first choice.", 
    "211": "Data published in the last 10 years did not indicate an absolute contraindication in prescribing BDZs during the first gestational trimester. In any case, studies analyzed suffer from a number of methodological limitations such as lack of careful report of BDZ patterns of use in pregnancy, possible influences of recall bias, lack of controlling for confounding factors and lack of data concerning possible MMs in aborted fetuses.", 
    "212": "This study investigated the roles of cholecystokinin (CCK)(A) and CCK(B) receptors on CCK-4-induced anxiety-like behaviors in mice through behavioral and neural evaluations. Anxiety-like behaviors in mice were induced by an intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of CCK-4, which can bind to both CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptors. The effects of CCK(A) and CCK(B) receptor antagonists (devazepide and CI-988, respectively) were examined using mouse anxiety tests (elevated-plus maze and light-dark box) and also by examining neuronal activities through EEG monitoring and c-Fos immunohistochemistry in the cortex and amygdala. CCK-4 (3 \u03bcg/kg of body weight i.c.v.) significantly induced mouse anxiety-like behaviors in the anxiety tests and also affected their EEG patterns with respect to pre-drug tracing, resulting in increase in spectral power in relative power distribution in the delta and theta bands (0.5-5 Hz frequency bands) and also in increase in c-Fos immunopositive neuron counts. These CCK-4 effects were completely suppressed by 1.0mg/kg CCK(B) receptor antagonist, CI-988, while the same amount of CCK(A) receptor antagonist, devazepide was partly able to suppress the same effects. These findings indicated that not only CCK(B) receptors but also CCK(A) receptors in the brain play important roles in regulating anxiety-like behaviors in mice. The present study also proposed a possibility that cortical EEG is useful for assessing anxiety.", 
    "213": "Studies of the carcinogenic potential of benzodiazepines and related drugs (BZRD) have been equivocal. A recent study reported a 35% excess cancer risk among users of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines.", 
    "214": "Using Danish nationwide registers, we conducted a matched case-control study of the association between BZRD and cancer risk. During 1 January 2002 and 31 December 2009, we identified 152\u2009510 cases with a first time cancer who were matched (1:8) by age and gender to 1,220,317 cancer-free controls. A new-user design was applied by excluding all subjects who had used anxiolytics, hypnotics or sedatives during the first 2 years of available prescription data (1995-6). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. In the primary analysis, long term use of BZRD was defined by a cumulative amount of \u2265500 defined daily doses of BZRD within a period of 1 to 5 years prior to the index date.", 
    "215": "The adjusted OR for cancer associated with BZRD use was 1.09 (95% CI 1.04, 1.14). ORs were close to unity for most cancer sites, except stomach 1.40 (95% CI 1.05, 1.88), oesophagus 1.43 (95% CI 1.01, 2.02), liver 1.81 (95% CI 1.18, 2.80), lung 1.38 (95% CI 1.23, 1.54), pancreas 1.35 (95% CI 1.02, 1.79) and kidney 1.39 (95% CI 1.01, 1.91). For tobacco-related cancers, the OR was 1.15 (95% CI 1.09, 1.22) and for the remaining cancer sites 1.01 (95% CI 0.94, 1.08). Sub-group analyses revealed only small differences between different levels of exposure or different patient subgroups.", 
    "216": "BZRD use was not associated with an overall increase in cancer risk, except for what is likely explained by minor lifestyle confounding, e.g. smoking.", 
    "217": "Post-ischaemic benzodiazepine administration is neuroprotective, but chronic administration of benzodiazepines can induce tolerance, such that the neuroprotective effect may be reduced. This study investigated whether benzodiazepine tolerance can worsen ischaemic injury and whether neuroprotection by post-ischaemic benzodiazepine administration is affected by benzodiazepine tolerance. We also investigated whether antagonism of benzodiazepine receptors by flumazenil was able to restore neuroprotection during benzodiazepine tolerance.", 
    "218": "Experiments were performed in both benzodiazepine-tolerant and naive rats. Benzodiazepine tolerance was indeed by 4 weeks administration of flurazepam. Bilateral carotid artery occlusion (BCAO) was performed to cause cerebral ischaemia. Four experiments were performed: (1) BCAO with no further interventions; (2) BCAO followed by administration of diazepam; (3) administration of flumazenil before BAO; and (4) administration of flumazenil before and diazepam after BCAO. Neurological and histological assessment was performed 5 days after BCAO.", 
    "219": "Benzodiazepine tolerance did not affect neuronal injury in the CA1 and CA3 regions and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus after severe ischaemic insult, but did worsen neuronal damage when mild ischaemia was applied (P<0.05). Neuroprotective efficacy of post-ischaemic diazepam was not observed under conditions of benzodiazepine tolerance. Flumazenil treatment before BCAO reduced ischaemic neuronal damage exacerbated by benzodiazepine tolerance (P<0.05), and restored neuroprotection by post-ischaemic diazepam (P<0.05), the effect of which was reduced by benzodiazepine tolerance (P<0.05). However, pre-ischaemic flumazenil treatment in naive animals reduced neuroprotection provided by post-ischaemic diazepam (P<0.01-0.05).", 
    "220": "Benzodiazepine tolerance can worsen ischaemic neuronal injury and abolish the neuroprotection provided by post-ischaemic diazepam. Pre-treatment with flumazenil treatment reversed benzodiazepine tolerance and restored neuroprotection by post-ischaemic diazepam. These findings may suggest that management of patient's risk of developing cerebral ischaemia may need to take into account current use.", 
    "221": "This paper reports on the thermodynamic and kinetic evaluation of a new ultra-high performance liquid chromatography broad-spectrum Pirkle-type chiral stationary phase (CSP) for enantioselective applications (eUHPLC). The well-known Whelk-O1 selector was covalently immobilized onto 1.7-\u03bcm high-surface-area, porous spherical silica particles to produce a totally synthetic, covalently bonded CSP that was packed into 150 mm, 100mm, 75 mm and 50mm columns, either 4.6 or 3.0mm ID. A 100 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm ID column was fully characterized from a kinetic and thermodynamic point of view, using as reference a conventional HPLC Whelk-O1 column, 250 mm\u00d74.6mm ID, based on 5-\u03bcm porous silica particles. On the eUHPLC column, van Deemter plots generated H(min) values of 3.53 \u03bcm for 1,3-dinitrobenzene, at an interstitial mobile phase linear velocity (\u03bc(inter)) of 5.07 mm/s, and H(min) of 4.26 and 4.17 \u03bcm for the two enantiomers of acenaphthenol, at \u03bc(inter) of 4.85 mm/s and 4.24 mm/s, respectively. Resolution of 21 enantiomeric pairs including alcohols, epoxides, sulfoxides, phosphine oxides, benzodiazepines and 2-aryloxyproprionic esters used as herbicides, were obtained with significant advantages in terms of efficiency and analysis time. Speed gain factors were calculated for the different column geometries (150 mm, 100mm, 75 mm and 50mm, either 4.6 or 3.0mm ID), with respect to the standard HPLC column (250 mm \u00d74.6 mm ID), and were as high as 13, in the case of the 50-mm-long column, affording sub-minute separations of enantiomers with excellent resolution factors. In particular, trans-stilbene oxide was resolved in only 10s, while a 50 mm\u00d73.0 mm ID column was used as a compromise between reduced mobile phase consumption (less than 1 mL per analysis) and smaller extra-column band-broadening effect. Given the relatively low viscosity in NP mode, and the excellent permeability of these eUHPLC columns, with backpressure values under 600 bar for a wide range of flow rates, the use of standard HPLC hardware is possible. In this case, however, a significant loss in resolution is observed, compared to the UHPLC instrumentation, if no modifications are introduced in the HPLC apparatus to reduce extra-column variance. The excellent efficiency and selectivity, conjugated with the very high-throughput and the ultra-fast analysis time, prove the potentials of the eUHPLC Whelk-O1 columns in the development of enantioselective UHPLC methods.",

In light of systematic reviews, large randomized controlled trial data are emphasized wherever possible. This review addresses the treatment of acute manic/mixed episodes, including combination treatment, the preliminary literature regarding bipolar depression among youth, treatment in the face of comorbid conditions, and maintenance treatment. Suggestions regarding future directions are offered. A clinical vignette describing a teen with bipolar disorder is presented and bipolar medications, dosing, efficacy, side effects, contraindications, and succinct comments on each medication are summarized.", 
    "223": "This article reviews common sleep disorders in children and pharmacologic options for them. Discussions of pediatric sleep pharmacology typically focus on treatment of insomnia. Although insomnia is a major concern in this population, other conditions of concern in children are presented, such as narcolepsy, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and sleep apnea.", 
    "224": "Delirium is one of the most common causes of acute end-organ dysfunction across hospital settings, occurring in as high as 80% of critically ill patients that require intensive care unit (ICU) care. The implications of this acute form of brain injury are profound. Across many hospital settings (emergency department, general medical ward, postoperative and ICU), a patient who experiences delirium is more likely to experience increased short- and long-term mortality, decreases in long-term cognitive function, increases in hospital length of stay and increased complications of hospital care. With the development of reliable setting-specific delirium-screening instruments, researchers have been able to highlight the predisposing and potentially modifiable risk factors that place patients at highest risk. Among the large number of risk factors discovered, administration of potent sedative medications, most notably benzodiazepines, is most consistently and strongly associated with an increased burden of delirium. Alternatively, in both the hospital and ICU, delirium can be prevented with the application of protocols that include early mobility/exercise. Future studies must work to understand the epidemiology across settings and focus upon modifiable risk factors that can be integrated into existing delirium prevention and treatment protocols.", 
    "225": "The GABA(A) receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in mammalian brain. Each isoform consists of five homologous or identical subunits surrounding a central chloride ion-selective channel gated by GABA. How many isoforms of the receptor exist is far from clear. GABA(A) receptors located in the postsynaptic membrane mediate neuronal inhibition that occurs in the millisecond time range; those located in the extrasynaptic membrane respond to ambient GABA and confer long-term inhibition. GABA(A) receptors are responsive to a wide variety of drugs, e.g. benzodiazepines, which are often used for their sedative/hypnotic and anxiolytic effects.", 
    "226": "This article addresses the question of 'best treatment options', which clinicians face when treating pregnant women with alcohol and opioid dependence.", 
    "227": "Studies show that alcohol consumption is associated with fetal abnormalities and long-term cognitive problems depending on the amount consumed, drinking pattern, and time of gestation. Screening and evaluation of specific interventions are important to reduce alcohol consumption during pregnancy and associated problems in infants. Opioid detoxification is only recommended beyond the first trimester and only in those pregnant women who refuse opioid maintenance therapy. Methadone is the most established treatment of pregnant opioid-dependent women, though recent results indicate some advantages of buprenorphine, slow-release oral methadone and diamorphine compared with methadone.", 
    "228": "Benzodiazepines seem to be the most recommendable option for managing alcohol withdrawal, and psychosocial interventions succeed in reducing alcohol consumption or in maintaining abstinence in alcohol-dependent pregnant women. Regarding opioid dependence, current results suggest that factors like the health status of the mother, the need for additional medications (e.g. treatment for HIV), comorbid drug dependence, and concurrent drug use need to be considered in order to find the 'best opioid substitute'."
