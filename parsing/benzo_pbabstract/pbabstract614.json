In the control state, antipyrine half-life was longer in elderly than in young subjects (16.4 vs 11.0 hours), and metabolic clearance lower (0.48 vs 0.72 ml/min/kg). However, coadministration of cimetidine prolonged antipyrine half-life to a similar extent in elderly and in young groups (150 and 153 per cent of control) and reduced metabolic clearance to a similar extent in both (79 vs 69 per cent of control) groups. Three young and six elderly volunteers received a single 15 mg oral dose of clorazepate, a precursor of desmethyldiazepam, with and without cimetidine. As in the case of antipyrine, cimetidine prolonged desmethyldiazepam half-life similarly in young and elderly groups (175 vs 164 per cent of control) and similarly reduced metabolic clearance (51 vs 65 per cent of control). The elderly population may already have an impaired capacity to oxidize drugs. This capacity is further impaired by coadministration of cimetidine.", 
    "1": "A simple, rapid, and reliable gas-liquid chromatographic (GLC) confirmation procedure was developed for urine samples found positive by the EMIT-dau benzodiazepine metabolite assay. The procedure involves acid hydrolysis, organic extraction, and identification using GLC-nitrogen-phosphorus detection (NPD). The method was validated in three subjects who took 10 mg diazepam daily for five days. Urinary excretion of the diazepam related substances was monitored quantitatively for 12 days. Considerable differences in diazepam metabolism was observed, despite the small number of subjects used. The data further indicated that both the physical characteristics and the metabolic profile of each individual may determine whether or not their occasional benzodiazepine use would be detected by the EMIT procedure. In some individuals taking daily diazepam, 48 to 72 hours may be required before sufficient metabolites accumulate in the urine to give a positive EMIT reaction.", 
    "2": "One hundred A.S.A. physical status I and II surgical patients were randomized to receive midazolam, 0.07 mg/kg (group M, 31 patients), hydroxyzine, 1.0 mg/kg (group H, 34 patients), or midazolam diluent as a placebo (group P, 35 patients). Drugs were administered in the vastus lateralis muscle 60 to 90 minutes before anesthesia induction. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental, 3.0 mg/kg, followed by 1.0-mg/kg increments if required. An entry criterion was that patients score greater than or equal to 50% on a subjective Anxiety Visual Analog Test (AVAT). Anxiety was also objectively rated on a six-point scale by a trained observer. Patients and observer were unaware of type of premedication used. Midazolam and hydroxyzine produced significantly (p less than 0.05) greater reduction of anxiety than placebo on both the AVAT and objective anxiety evaluations. Peak onset appeared between 30 and 60 minutes after drug administration. Hemodynamic changes were similar in all groups, and no untoward reactions were encountered before anesthesia. The injection site 24 and 48 hours after administration showed evidence of mild tissue irritation in 68% of patients in group H, 26% of patients in group M, and none of the patients in group P. Midazolam is an efficacious, safe premedicant in relatively healthy patients. It has a prompt onset of action with only minimal tissue irritation.", 
    "3": "A prospective study of 204 patients undergoing operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass was undertaken to determine the incidence and etiologic factors leading to postperfusion cerebral dysfunction and to determine whether pretreatment with thiopental, 15 mg/kg, would reduce the incidence. Patients were randomly assigned to a control (diazepam) or study (thiopental) group and were treated identically except for the drug administered. Patients were examined neurologically on the 1st and 4th postoperative day and a psychometric test was administered on the 4th day. Although fewer neuropsychiatric complications were present in patients given thiopental, the difference was not significant. The overall incidence of cerebral dysfunction attributable to cardiopulmonary bypass alone was 16.2% for transient and 6.4% for persistent dysfunction (present at the 10th postoperative day). The incidence of postoperative cerebral dysfunction was more than twice as high in patients undergoing intracardiac than in patients having extracardiac operations and more than 4 times as high in patients more than 60 years of age than in younger patients. Perfusion pressure less than 50 torr with hematocrit less than 30% was not related to development of postoperative cerebral dysfunction. The data suggest that air or particulate emboli originating within the heart or aorta are the major causes of postbypass cerebral dysfunction.", 
    "4": "Although the potent benzodiazepine antagonist CGS 8216 has in vitro activity indicative of an interaction with central adenosine systems, neither it, nor the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 showed any great degree of interaction with central adenosine A-1 receptors as measured by radioligand binding. It is concluded that interaction of benzodiazepine antagonists with A-1 receptors is not a property related to their antagonist activity.", 
    "5": "The effect of tofizopam on 3H-flunitrazepam binding was studied in rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Tofizopam (at a concentration of 10(-7) M) increased 3H-Flu binding through a 30% rise in the Bmax with no modification of Kd in either brain area. Similar results were obtained when the binding was measured in tofizopam (50 mg/kg p.o.) pretreated rats. Even though tofizopam has no anticonvulsive action against pentetrazol-induced convulsions, it significantly potentiated the action of diazepam but with no modification of brain diazepam levels and metabolism. The brain levels of tofizopam are reported and compared to plasma levels after oral administration of 5 and 50 mg/kg to rats.", 
    "6": "The reactivity of some 6H-indolo[2,3-b] [1,8]naphthyridines (II) and 11H-indolo[3,2-c] [1,8]naphthyridines (III) in displacing specific [3H] diazepam binding from bovine brain membranes was examined. All the indolonaphthyridines tested are active and show a higher activity than indole and tryptophan. The inhibition is due to direct interaction with the benzodiazepine binding sites. Some structure-activity relationships are discussed.", 
    "7": "Acute microinjections of the GABA agonist, muscimol (100 ng), into either the dorsal (DR) or the median (MR) raphe nucleus of etherized rats induced post-anesthesia hyperactivity as measured in photocell chambers. The increased activity counts seen after MR injections, furthermore, were 4 times greater than those following DR injections. In animals implanted with chronically indwelling cannulae, a muscimol (25-400 ng) dose-response analysis confirmed the greater sensitivity of the MR site. Subsequent experiments thus employed only MR cannulae. The benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, in a subataxic dose (3.8 mg/kg, IP) by itself did not affect activity level, but enhanced the locomotor response to low doses (25-50 ng) of muscimol. Conversely, a sub-convulsant dose of the GABA antagonist, bicuculline (1.1 mg/kg, IP), completely blocked the hyperactivity produced by muscimol (50-100 ng). Bilateral electrolytic destruction of the ventral tegmental nuclei of Gudden produced hyperactivity, but failed to alter the effect of muscimol. Forebrain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) depletion following administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine did not affect baseline activity level, but markedly attenuated the locomotor response produced by intra-MR injections of muscimol. These data suggest that midbrain GABA neurons modulate activity level through a direct action on 5-HT neurons, and indicate that intra-MR muscimol induced hyperactivity depends on intact ascending 5-HT fibers.", 
    "8": "Recent reports indicate that benzodiazepine-induced hyperphagia can be antagonised by naloxone, an opiate antagonist. Benzodiazepines are also known to facilitate water ingestion in water-deprived rats, and the present study showed that in addition, benzodiazepine treatment can enhance drinking which is elicited by an osmotic thirst stimulus (2 M hypertonic saline) or by a hypovolemic thirst stimulus (20% polyethylene glycol). In both cases, low dose levels of naltrexone (also an opiate antagonist) dose-dependently suppressed the facilitation of thirst-aroused drinking by chlordiazepoxide. Taken with recent biochemical data these behavioral results indicate that the enhancement of ingestive responses by benzodiazepines may depend upon a naloxone-reversible release of endogenous opioid peptides.", 
    "9": "The most compelling pharmacological evidence in support of benzo-diazepine (BZD) receptor heterogeneity is derived from the study of the complex interactions of CL 218872 and propyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (PCC) with brain BZD receptors. In the present study, we provide evidence to support the hypothesis that intraregional BZD receptor heterogeneity in rat brain is a result of the different conformational states of a single receptor. This hypothesis is based upon the observation that CL 218872 and PCC lose the ability to effectively discriminate BZD receptor subtypes in rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and pons-medulla at physiological temperature (37 degrees C). Interestingly, both PCC and CL 218872 show higher affinity for BZD receptors in the cerebellum when compared to other brain regions at 37 degrees C. This observation suggests that interregional BZD receptor heterogeneity occurs under physiologically relevant temperatures. We propose that distinct cerebellar and non-cerebellar type BZD receptors exist in vivo while marked differences in the affinity of the type I and type II BZD receptor subtypes postulated by Klepner et al. 1979 may only occur in vitro at 0 degree--4 degree C.", 
    "10": "Specific binding of [3H]diazepam at a free concentration of 2 nM was found to be maximally potentiated by 117% in Tris-HCl buffer and 160% in Tris-citrate buffer by ethylenediamine (EDA), but only at relatively high concentrations of EDA (ED50 = 5 X 10(-5) M), although this potentiation was susceptible to a low dose (6 microM) of bicuculline. Dose-response curves show that EDA differs from GABA with respect to both potency and efficacy. In additivity experiments no evidence was found that EDA could act as a partial agonist at GABA receptors, and it was concluded that EDA and GABA apparently do not potentiate [3H]diazepam binding by acting on the same receptor. Scatchard analysis lends support to this hypothesis, indicating that the potentiation of [3H]diazepam binding by 3.16 X 10(-3) M EDA is due to an increase in receptor number (from 930 to 1170 fmol/mg protein) and not receptor affinity (remaining constant about 20 nM). Subsequent studies showed the potentiation to be reversible. It is concluded that EDA can act on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor ionophore complex but that this is probably not a direct action on the GABA receptor. It is suggested that EDA can be used to differentiate GABA receptors linked to benzodiazepine receptors from those not so linked.", 
    "11": "Administration of estrogen to adult male rats increases the density of striatal dopamine receptors. The densities of the dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens and cortex are not altered, while the density of those in the hippocampus is decreased. In the pituitary the density, on a whole pituitary basis, is not changed. The increased density of striatal dopamine receptors normally observed after estrogen treatment is prevented by prior injection into the striatum of kainic acid, which destroys the intrinsic neurons in the striatum. In addition, the benzodiazepine receptors in the striatum, cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum are not altered by estrogen treatment, showing the specificity of the estrogen treatment and suggesting that the effects of estrogen are not mediated through benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "12": "Lormetazepam, an investigational hypnotic, was evaluated for efficacy and withdrawal phenomena in doses of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg in four separate sleep laboratory protocols, each including four placebo baseline nights, seven drug nights, and three placebo withdrawal nights. A moderate degree of efficacy was shown across the four doses, but this was quite variable. There was no dose-response effect for efficacy for either the first three or last three nights of this short-term administration period. In general, there was less efficacy on the later drug nights, indicating a potential for the development of tolerance over a relatively short period of time. Following drug withdrawal, there was a dose-related worsening of sleep above baseline levels (rebound insomnia). The peak degree of worsening of sleep following drug withdrawal was more than two times greater than the peak degree of improvement of sleep with drug administration.", 
    "13": "We have kinetically investigated the tissue distribution of 14C-diazepam and described the appearance and disappearance of its metabolites (3-hydroxydiazepam, desmethyldiazepam, and oxazepam) following a single iv injection of 14C-diazepam into rats. Significant amounts of oxazepam were detected in plasma and various tissues in the rat, contrary to previous reports. Concentration-time profiles of diazepam in the main disposing organs (liver, kidney, and lung) and the other organs (brain, heart, and small intestine) indicated that diazepam was distributed rapidly to these organs. Concentration-time profiles of diazepam in the main tissues for drug distribution (skin and adipose) indicated that diazepam was slowly distributed to these tissues, whereas that in muscle, which is also responsible for drug distribution, indicated that diazepam was less rapidly distributed to this tissue. Metabolites appeared in plasma and various tissues or organs immediately after iv injection of diazepam. Metabolites levels in plasma and various tissues or organs were significantly lower than that of diazepam except for liver and small intestine, where metabolites levels were higher compared to that of diazepam and metabolites exhibited a considerable persistence.", 
    "14": "The concentrations of (R)-(-)- and (S)-(+)-oxazepam glucuronides in plasma and urine of several species have been measured. The relative amounts of these diastereoisomers vary among species. Thus, in the plasma and urine of rhesus monkeys the concentrations of the R-isomer are higher, whereas in man and dog more of the S-isomer is present. In plasma and urine of miniature swine the amounts of the two diastereoisomers are about equal. In the urine of rabbits the S-isomer prevails. Similar species-related differences are observed in the in vitro formation of the isomeric oxazepam glucuronides. Homogenates of dog, miniature swine, rabbit, and rat liver produce more of the S-isomer, whereas with monkey liver the formation of (R)-oxazepam glucuronide is favored. The agreement between in vivo and in vitro data is fairly good for rhesus monkey, miniature swine, and rabbit. However, for the dog the ratio of S- to R-isomers in the liver homogenate is much higher than in plasma and urine. This species-dependent stereoselective glucuronidation of oxazepam is not related to the phylogenetic or dietary grouping of these species.", 
    "15": "Forty alcohol abusers (with a history of long-time alcohol addiction and mean daily use over 360 grams of alcohol) were treated with tiapride or chlordesmethyldiazepam when stopped their overdrinking. The aim of such pharmacological treatment was both a valuation of effectiveness towards ten target-symptoms and the attempt to avoid the development of a withdrawal syndrome-or, at least, to shorten its course. Chlordesmethyldiazepam resulted to be on the whole more effective than tiapride in dominating all most dramatic symptoms of Delirium Tremens and in avoiding--in a significantly higher number of patients--the onset of a DT syndrome in all its typical features. Moreover, CDDz appeared as a manageable drug and free from important side-effects, and could control symptoms without need of further therapies.", 
    "16": "A study of psychotropic drug prescribing, derived from the computerized pricing data in Northern Ireland from 1966, showed that the use of these drugs reached a peak in 1975, when about 12.5% of the adult population were estimated to have been receiving them, and declined in the following 5 years. Benzodioazepines accounted for three-quarters of all psychotropic drugs prescribed in 1980. Benzodiazepine tranquillizer prescribing was consistently 20-30% higher than in the rest of the United Kingdom, in contrast to hypnotic and antidepressant prescribing which has been consistently lower. The rate of increase in benzodiazepine tranquillizer prescribing was greater than in other European countries, but the level remains lower than in Iceland and Denmark. The influence of a number of demographic and socioeconomic variables was studied in an intra-regional analysis of the 1978 data for the 17 health districts in the province, using multivariate and multiple regression statistics. The prescribing of benzodiazepine hypnotics was almost entirely accounted for by the proportion of elderly (over 65 years) and women aged 45-59 years: neuroleptic prescribing was largely a function of factors associated with rural areas (overcrowding and unemployment) and the proportion of elderly; but neither tranquillizer, antidepressant, barbiturate hypnotic nor psychostimulant prescribing were satisfactorily explained by these variables.", 
    "17": "There are frequent reports of impairment of psychomotor performance on the morning after taking hypnotics. Possible ways of avoiding these problems include a reduction of the dose or using a hypnotic with a short half-life. This study used nitrazepam 2.5 mg and triazolam 0.125 mg in a group of hospitalized elderly patients. Both drugs were effective hypnotic agents but they are different in their residual effects. Patients reported difficulty in waking after nitrazepam but not after triazolam. These difficulties were confirmed by nurse observation. Nitrazepam significantly impairs (after repeated doses) psychomotor performance after five days therapy and this effect was not seen after triazolam. If a benzodiazepine hypnotic is used in the elderly, a drug with a short elimination half-life is an advantage.", 
    "18": "Trimethadione was compared with chlordiazepoxide for anti-anxiety activity in two behavioral tests known to predict the anxiolytic action of drugs. In the drug-discrimination test, male hooded rats were trained to discriminate the anxiogenic action of pentylenetetrazol from saline by responding for food reinforcement on one of two levers after treatment with pentylenetetrazol (1450 mumol/kg) and on the other lever after injection of saline. Pretreatment with either chlordiazepoxide (2.8-33 mumol kg) or trimethadione (559-2236 mumol/kg) prior to the injection of pentylenetetrazol, produced a dose-dependent antagonism of the anxiogenic stimulus. In the other test, male Wistar rats were trained to respond for milk reinforcement in a conflict procedure in which some of the reinforced responses resulted in the delivery of footshock. Treatment of these rats with chlordiazepoxide (17-67 mumol/kg) or trimethadione (1118-2236 mumol/kg) antagonized the footshock-induced suppression of responding. In a receptor binding study, trimethadione failed to inhibit flunitrazepam binding. These data suggest that trimethadione is an effective anxiolytic agent whose action does not directly involve benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "19": "The effect of several drug restriction policies on benzodiazepine and cephalosporin use was evaluated in a large federal hospital. Computerized drug-use data were examined for the 10-year period from 1972 through 1981. The five major types of drug restrictions implemented were the: (1) requirement that all diazepam prescriptions be countersigned by the chief of staff, (2) deletion of cephalothin sodium from the formulary, (3) required countersignature by a physician from the infectious disease service for all cefazolin sodium prescriptions, (4) requirement that justification accompany all cefazolin sodium prescriptions after the countersignature requirement was lifted, and (5) amendment of the countersignature requirement for diazepam with a series of designated exceptions. All of the restrictions resulted in a decrease in the number of dosage units dispensed; however, the required countersignature by the chief of staff and deletion from the formulary were the most effective in restricting drug use. The effect of the restriction policies appears to be related to the influence or power of the restriction enforcer and the perceived importance of the restriction, as well as the relative difficulty of drug acquisition by the prescriber. Formulary deletion, countersignature requirements, or restricted use to a service or physician are action plans that may alter the use rates of drugs.", 
    "20": "Twelve male patients were given high dose fentanyl (75-100 microgram.kg-1) anaesthesia with oxygen during elective aorto-coronary bypass operations, and their haemodynamic and vasopressin responses were determined during induction, sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass, post-bypass and recovery periods. For comparison, a group of 12 male patients were anaesthetized with morphine, halothane 0.5 per cent, nitrous oxide and oxygen, and were similarly studied. Significant alterations in haemodynamics included increased mean arterial pressure after sternotomy in the fentanyl group, increased heart rate in both groups, increased systemic vascular resistance after sternotomy only in the halothane group, and decreased left ventricular stroke work index in both groups following induction, bypass, and during the recovery periods. Plasma vasopressin levels increased significantly in both groups during the bypass period, but returned to baseline levels following bypass. Serum sodium and osmolality did not change significantly, and urinary sodium and potassium excretion rose with the progress of the operation in both groups. A positive correlation was found between mean arterial pressure and vasopressin only in the halothane group. Systemic vascular resistance was correlated to vasopressin levels in both groups. Vasopressin response in both groups was similar, with significant but relatively low increases in levels during cardiopulmonary bypass. Fentanyl-oxygen anaesthesia did not provide haemodynamic stability in eight of 12 patients.", 
    "21": "Chronic ingestion of ethanol in alcoholic beverages can impair drug therapy, lead to sometimes hazardous interactions, or compromise adherence to a well-planned drug treatment program. Various drugs consistently interact with alcohol: CNS depressants, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, muscle relaxants, antihistamines, and psychotropic agents; analgesics, including aspirin and narcotics; anticoagulants and other cardiovascular drugs, namely digitalis glycosides, diuretics, antihypertensives, and antiarrhythmics; and antidiabetic agents. Abstinence from alcohol by elderly patients receiving these drugs is recommended.", 
    "22": "Displacement of [3H]propyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]PrCC) and [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNM) was studied in rat hippocampus and cerebellum. Diazepam displaced both ligands with equal potency in both regions. Ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta CCE) and CL 218,872 displaced [3H]PrCC more potently than [3H]FNM and were more potent in the cerebellum than the hippocampus. Beta CCE and CL 218,872 interact more potently with BZ1 than BZ2 sites, while diazepam is equipotent. GABA and chloride ions enhance the potency of diazepam and CL 218,872 but not beta CCE.", 
    "23": "The present study addresses the possible role of endorphins in mediating the anxiolytic properties of diazepam (DZM) in man. The ability of a low dose (0.4 mg. i.v.) of the specific opiate antagonist, Naloxone (NLX) to modify the anxiolytic action of DZM (0.07 mg/kg i.v.) in 22 patients anticipating minor orthopaedic surgery was evaluated. The study was performed in a double-blind placebo (saline)-controlled, randomized design. DZM administered 3 hours pre operation, reduced the anxiety experienced by subjects as estimated on a formal rating scale completed by the patients. NLX, as compared to saline, given 30 min post DZM significantly and strongly attenuated, but did not abolish this effect of DZM. These findings parallel observations in rats of the ability of NLX to block the action of DZM in the conflict test and suggest that the anxiolytic action of DZM in man may be partially mediated by endorphins.", 
    "24": "A significant fall in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was noted before gastric lavage and before renal excretion was increased by forced diuresis in 103 patients treated in an intensive care unit for self-poisoning with psychoactive drugs. The pathogenesis of changes in BUN during acute intoxication with benzodiazepines, phenothiazines and barbiturates is obscure, but they do not seem to be associated with accelerated renal excretion, hepatic failure or enzyme induction.", 
    "25": "MK-801, phenobarbital and clonazepam blocked convulsions elicited in mice by bicuculline. Treatment with Ro 15-1788 antagonized the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam, but not MK-801 or phenobarbital. The anticonflict effect in the rat of chlordiazepoxide, but not MK-801, was antagonized by Ro 15-1788. Despite having certain benzodiazepine-like effects in vivo, MK-801 does not act directly or indirectly via receptors for benzodiazepines.", 
    "26": "U-43,465F (8-chloro-1-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-6-phenyl-4H-s-triazolo [4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine p-toluene sulfonate) showed two fold activity at 32 mg/kg i.p.: antipunishment activity inhibited by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, and an antidepressant-like reversal of apomorphine-induced hypothermia, antagonized by the beta-adrenergic receptor blocker d,1-propranolol. U-43,465F hence produced effects not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors and these effects might be related to antidepressant activity.", 
    "27": "If benzodiazepines rank amongst the less harmful drugs, they are not completely safe. As all other drugs, they must be evaluated in relation with their risk/benefit ratio knowing that their side effects must be assessed for each patient and that they may vary according to indication, dosage, routes of administration and pharmacokinetic differences between the molecules. The authors mainly study: vigilance disorders and performance impairment, memory loss, behaviour disturbances, exceptional toxicomania risk, teratogen effects, not proved to this date, acute overdosage, interaction with other sedative psychotropic drugs (CNS depressors, imipramine). In conclusion, the authors underline the importance of the use of benzodiazepines and their success which is a social phenomenon.", 
    "28": "Clinical trials conducted in general practice are more especially interesting as they enable to test a drug in the real conditions of use. On the other hand, these trials are beneficial to the G.P. (new image, rupture of his loneliness, change in his prescription habits, contact with hospitals). The methodology, as for hospital studies, must be rigorous. As a matter of fact, these two types of studies are additional and the cooperation between the G.P.'s and the pharmaceutical industry can conduct to the solution of specific problems: drug interaction--long-term therapeutic effect--new indications. This double blind cross over study comparing triazolam and nitrazepam conducted by G.P.'s on insomniacs is the first French clinical study intended for the registration application and done according to this methodology. This work is an exemple of the new opportunity offered to G.P.'s in future. The results have shown that: on 54 patients (23 male and 31 female) of an average age: 48, 32 have preferred triazolam, 13 have preferred nitrazepam, 9 have had no preference.", 
    "29": "Several studies have been conducted in view to evaluate the short and medium-term efficacy of triazolam. The present investigation was aimed at assessing its long-term effectiveness. Four female and six male (average age: 29.9 years +/- 9.6) insomniacs took part in this study. After selection of the subjects, they are kept under observation in the sleep laboratory during two consecutive nights per week for ten weeks, during which they were given a placebo on weeks 1, 8, 9 and 10 and triazolam 0.50 mg on weeks 2 to 7. Triazolam proved to be an effective hypnotic during the six weeks of treatment, with no withdrawal effects upon discontinuation.", 
    "30": "The authors have studied the pharmacokinetics of the five benzodiazepines: flurazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam and triazolam. The pharmacokinetics parameters of these molecules are different and vary according to individual sensitivity. Twelve healthy volunteers were involved in this study (6 males--6 females). The parent drug has been titrated for nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, temazepam, triazolam and the active metabolite of flurazepam, the N-desakylflurazepam (DAF). Half-lifes have been calculated: it is short for the temazepam and triazolam with no accumulation after multiple drug administration. Triazolam has the shortest half-life. Those different results enable to better understand the prescription problem of hypnotics as duration of action must be limited to one night, with no residual effect the day after.", 
    "31": "The pharmetabolism properties allow to guide the therapeutic use of benzodiazepines. The authors have studied these two aspects in relation with absorption, routes of administration, protein binding, distribution, m\u00e9tabolism, excretion, long-term use. The paper also deals extensively with pharmacokinetics and metabolic modifications under the influence of drug interaction, age, physiologic condition (pregnancy, new-born, elderlies) and pathological condition. These data are useful to guide the choice according to indication and to adapt the dosage.", 
    "32": "The properties of benzodiazepines are reviewed in animal. If the benzodiazepines have qualitatively the same effects, there are however some quantitative differences; in humans, benzodiazepines are likely to have pharmacodynamic effects quantitatively different. In these conditions, and facing the difficulty to prove, at the present time, such differences, the choice of a benzodiazepine must be made in view of its therapeutic efficacy in the indication concerned and in view of pharmacokinetics.", 
    "33": "Morphine appears to be capable of initiating the opiate dependence process with the first exposure. This can be demonstrated within 3 hrs by the administration of a low dose of naloxone which results in a significant elevation in plasma corticosterone. The response was still evident if the interval between morphine-priming and naloxone was extended to 6, 12, or 24 hours. The magnitude of the hormone elevation varied with the priming dose of morphine or with the dose of naloxone used to precipitate the response. Results are presented suggesting that the stress/withdrawal hormone response may be evident as early as 30 min after morphine-priming. Rats pretreated for eight days with either diazepam, phenobarbital, or amphetamine showed similarities in hormone responses after morphine-priming and naloxone administration when compared to saline-pretreated controls. The exception being the phenobarbital-pretreated group, where the response was attenuated and not observed at the 24 hr interval. These results emphasize the parallels between acute dependence and chronic dependence, suggesting that the same mechanism is involved.", 
    "34": "The effects of various doses of diazepam and the new central benzodiazepine antagonist Ro-15-1788 were investigated in fully amygdaloid kindled rats. Diazepam had a pronounced dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect in this model. Ro-15-1788 dose-dependently reduced the behavioral ranks of the elicited kindled seizures to a maximum of 60% of control without consistently modifying the afterdischarge duration. No prestimulation convulsant effects were seen with Ro-15-1788. When 2 mg/kg i.p. of Ro-15-1788 was given after various doses of diazepam, the prestimulation sedation and ataxia anticonvulsant effects of diazepam (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) were attenuated by treatment with 2 mg/kg dose of Ro-15-1788. At the low dose of diazepam (0.25 mg/kg), increased reduction of behavioral rank and after discharge duration was seen after the 2 mg/kg dose of Ro-15-1788. Thus, Ro-15-1788 appears not to have proconvulsant properties in the kindled amygdaloid seizure model. Further, Ro-15-1788 appears to have some anticonvulsant properties of its own. Mixed agonist and antagonist effects were seen with Ro-15-1788 when given after various doses of diazepam in this model.", 
    "35": "Anisatin, a pure toxic substance isolated from the seeds of a Japanese plant (Illicium anisatum) acts as a picrotoxin-like, non-competitive GABA antagonist. Anisatin inhibited [3H]diazepam binding enhanced by either GABA or pentobarbital, without affecting the basal specific binding to rat brain membranes. The inhibition of this pentobarbital enhancement was competitive. These actions of anisatin were even more apparent when the binding assays were carried out at 37 degrees C rather than a 0 degrees C. Thus, at a physiological temperature, anisatin may have a more potent modulatory effect on benzodiazepine-GABA receptor coupling, through the barbiturate-picrotoxin sensitive sites.", 
    "36": "RO 15-1788 (4-20 mg/kg), both alone and in combination with chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), increased exploratory head-dipping in an holeboard above control levels. This intrinsic action of a benzodiazepine antagonist is not reversed, and is even augmented, by chlordiazepoxide. RO 15-1788 alone had no effect on locomotor activity, but antagonized the sedative effects of chlordiazepoxide. beta-CCE (1 and 2 mg/kg) was without effect on locomotor activity, but the higher dose reduced head-dipping.", 
    "37": "Gaba increases the potency of the benzodiazepines chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, diazepam, nitrazepam and oxazepam, and the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872 in displacing specific binding of the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]Ro 15-1788. In contrast, the potencies of the purines 1-methyl- and 1-ethylisoguanosine for benzodiazepine antagonist binding sites were decreased by GABA, while the potencies of inosine, hypoxanthine, 6-dimethylaminopurine, and the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, zopiclone, were unaltered by GABA. The results suggest that the purines and 'classical' benzodiazepine agonists may bind to different conformations or populations of receptors.", 
    "38": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of 7-amino-flunitrazepam (Ro 20-1815) and 7-amino-desmethylflunitrazepam (Ro 5-4650) in plasma is described. After extraction with an organic solvent, the compounds and their internal standard (7-amino-methylclonazepam or Ro 5-3384) are derivatized with fluorescamine and chromatographed on a reversed-phase muBondapak C18 column using pH 8 buffer solution-acetonitrile (3:1) as mobile phase. The detection is performed by a fluorometer at excitation and emission wavelengths of 390 and 470 nm, respectively. The sensitivity limit is about 1 ng/ml of plasma for both 7-amino-flunitrazepam and 7-amino-desmethylflunitrazepam. The method has been applied to the determination of plasma levels of these substances during pharmacokinetic studies of flunitrazepam, desmethylflunitrazepam and 7-amino-flunitrazepam.", 
    "39": "The ability of pirenzepine and atropine, given i.v., to inhibit gastric acid and salivary secretion and increase pupil diameter has been assessed in the rat. Pirenzepine had a similar potency against acid secretion, ED 50 0.71 (0.41 to 1.1) mg.kg-1, and salivary secretion, ED 50 (0.43 to .59) mg.kg-1, whilst its potency was less in the eye, ED 50 1.8 (1.6 to 2.1) mg.kg-1. Atropine however, was more potent in reducing salivary secretion, ED 50 0.012 (0.010 to 0.016) mg.kg-1 and increasing pupil diameter, ED 50 0.028 (0.025 to 0.031) mg.kg-1 than in inhibiting gastric acid secretion, ED 50 0.056 (0.037 to 0.083) mg.kg-1. Therefore, that quantity of pirenzepine which inhibits gastric acid secretion by 50% will have only a slight effect on the eye and will inhibit salivary secretion by a similar magnitude. In contrast, the amount of atropine required to inhibit acid secretion by 50% will significantly increase pupil diameter and abolish salivary secretion.", 
    "40": "A standardized, patient-oriented package insert for benzodiazepines has been compared with four package inserts printed by manufacturers for these drugs. The leaflets were submitted to 222 hospitalized patients randomly allocated to two groups; 108 received a manufacturer's notice and 114 the standardized notice. The patients were interviewed two or three days later and found the standardized notice more comprehensible than those of the manufacturers. Two independent experts assessed the adequacy of the notices and also found the standardized notice more appropriate for patients. The patients answered a questionnaire about the effects of the drugs and the precautions while using them. Those who had read the standardized notice were significantly better informed than those who had read manufacturers' notices. However, the level of understanding varied largely from one item to another, and depended on the level of education and age.", 
    "41": "A conflict model is described in which clinically effective antianxiety agents exhibit pronounced anticonflict activity. Male squirrel monkeys were trained to depress a bar for 5 sec to obtain food reinforcement. The 6 hr test session was comprised of an initial 3 hr period in which each 5 sec response was punished and then a 3 hr unpunished period. Trained monkeys would rarely be shocked and would make most of their responses during the non-punished period. Both benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide and diazepam) and non-benzodiazepine (meprobamate and phenobarbital) anxiolytics produced pronounced and unequivocal increases in punished responding. Other psychoactive agents (damphetamine, chlorpromazine, ethanol, morphine, amitriptyline and imipramine) did not produce an increase in punished responding. Sensitivity (i.e., large magnitude effects), selectivity, stable baseline performance and fully automated features make this test useful in identifying potential anxiolytic agents in primates.", 
    "42": "The pharmacokinetics of the tranquilizer phenazepam and its high-active metabolite 3-hydroxyphenazepam in the cat blood was studied in experiments using gas liquid chromatography and mathematic simulation. The experimental findings were computer-processed. An appreciable quantity of 3-hydroxyphenazepam was found in the blood in addition to the unchanged drug at any times after oral administration of phenazepam (2 mg/kg). Joint modelling of the kinetics of phenazepam and 2-hydroxyphenazepam within the same metabolic model allowed calculating the kinetic parameters of both the compounds. The elimination constant of the metabolite in cats was found to be twice as high on the average as compared to that of the unchanged drug.", 
    "43": "The cardiopulmonary, behavioral, and pharmacokinetic properties of diazepam were determined in horses. Heart rate, cardiac output, mean pulmonary artery, aortic and right atrial blood pressures, respiratory rate, and arterial pH and blood gas values did not change after IV diazepam (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 mg/kg) administration. Increasing doses of diazepam resulted in signs of muscle weakness including fixed stance, muscle fasciculations of the head, neck, and thorax muscles, ataxia, and then recumbency. Dosages of diazepam exceeding 0.2 mg/kg produced mild sedation. Behavioral changes persisted for up to 2 hours with a dosage of 0.4 mg/kg. Plasma concentration-time data in horses given brief (5 min) infusions of diazepam were described by a triexponential equation. Total body clearances of diazepam were between 6.94 and 9.56 ml/min/kg, and the half-life values between 2.52 and 21.6 hours. The volume of distribution at steady state was 1.56 to 2.94 L/kg. N-Desmethyldiazepam was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry following glucuronide hydrolysis of urine. Oxazepam, N-methyloxazepam, and N-desmethyldiazepam, but not diazepam, were detected after glucuronide hydrolysis of urine collected from 1 horse which was given 140 mg of IV diazepam. Only N-desmethyldiazepam was detected in hydrolyzed urine samples collected from other horses given 80 mg of diazepam.", 
    "44": "The stability of diazepam injection repackaged in disposable glass syringes and stored at room and refrigerator temperatures was studied. Thirty-nine 1.5-ml syringes were filled with 1.1 ml diazepam injection 5-mg/ml. All syringes were stored in light-resistant bags on their sides so that the solution was in contact with the rubber stoppers on both ends. Samples were assayed with a stability-indicating HPLC method for diazepam and its degradation product, 2-methylamino-5-chloro-benzophenone (MACB), after 30, 60, and 90 days of storage at 30 degrees C and 4 degrees C. At 90 days, the diazepam injection stored at 4 degrees C retained 97.4 +/- 1.6% of its original potency; samples stored at 30 degrees C retained 92.4 +/- 1% of their original potency. Apparent sorption to rubber syringe components led to a decrease in the concentration of both diazepam and MACB. The decrease in diazepam was a function of storage time and temperature; however, the disappearance of MACB from the syringes was a function of only time. Diazepam injection is chemically stable as 5-mg doses in disposable glass syringes for 90 days when stored at 4 degrees C or 30 degrees C. However, refrigeration is recommended.", 
    "45": "In a clinical study including 40 patients, who all underwent elective gynaecological surgery, the quantity and acidity of the gastric contents were compared for patients premedicated with diazepam (Apozepam) intramuscularly and orally, respectively. A significant difference was found with regard to both the quantity and acidity of the gastric fluid. The volume of gastric fluid was smaller after oral than after intramuscular premedication with diazepam (1.5 ml and 20 ml, respectively). The acidity of the gastric fluid was also less after oral than after intramuscular premedication (pH 2.4 and 1.8, respectively).", 
    "46": "The effects of naloxone hydrochloride (0.01-10 mg X kg-1), naltrexone hydrochloride (0.01-10 mg X kg-1), and morphine sulphate (0.01-10 mg X kg-1) on the increased water consumption provoked by administration of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg X kg-1) were investigated in male rats which had been adapted to a 22 hr water-deprivation schedule. As previously reported, both naloxone and naltrexone dose-relatedly reduced water ingestion. Naloxone at 1 mg X kg-1 and naltrexone at 0.1 mg X kg-1 completely blocked the chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperdipsia. Since both opiate antagonists removed the chlordiazepoxide-induced effects in small doses, their effect can plausibly be attributed to opiate receptor blockade. Hence, chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperdipsia may depend upon the activation of endogenous opioid mechanisms. Morphine had little effect on drinking, unless a large dose (10 mg X kg-1) was used, when the thirst-induced and chlordiazepoxide-induced drinking were attenuated. The data provided no evidence that morphine, a mu opiate agonist, enhanced chlordiazepoxide-induced water consumption. The results are considered in relation to other relevant behavioural and biochemical findings.", 
    "47": "The muscle relaxant (antispastic) effect of diazepam, alone or in combination with phenytoin, was studied in mutant Han-Wistar rats with progressive spastic paresis. Alone, phenytoin did not alter the spontaneous activity in the electromyogram (EMG) of the gastrocnemius soleus (GS) muscle of mutant rats, but strongly enhanced the depressant action of diazepam on the spontaneous EMG activity. Picrotoxin reduced the antispastic effect of diazepam alone and partially reversed the antispastic effect of combined treatment. Therefore, the antagonistic effect of picrotoxin on the reduction of the spontaneous activity in the EMG produced by the combination of both drugs hardly suggests an interaction of picrotoxin with phenytoin, but rather indicates an interaction with the effect of diazepam. Phenytoin enhancement of the depressant action of diazepam on the spontaneous EMG activity of mutant rats strongly suggests the potential therapeutic usefulness of the combined treatment with both drugs.", 
    "48": "In 49 patients with various neurological disorders plasma and CSF gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentrations were determined by radioreceptor assay. The CSF GABA concentration of 127 +/- 47 pmol/ml (range: 65-275; n = 52) was independent of the age, the sex and the intake of various drugs including benzodiazepines, baclofen and antidepressants. Patients with diverse neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, ischaemic strokes, intracranial tumour and polyneuropathies had similar CSF GABA levels. The mean plasma GABA concentration was 309 +/- 79 pmol/ml (range: 179-498; n = 44). The correlation between the GABA concentrations of CSF and plasma was very poor (r = 0.18; n = 44). Therefore plasma GABA is not a suitable indicator for CSF GABA.", 
    "49": "1 The serum binding capacity for diazepam was significantly lower in pregnancy and there was a linear correlation with gestational age. 2 The binding of diazepam was not correlated to albumin during pregnancy. 3 In cord sera there was a significantly reduced binding capacity for diazepam with albumin levels of less than 40 g/l.", 
    "50": "The pharmacologic effects of ketamine, midazolam, and a midazolam-ketamine combination were compared with thiopental for rapid induction of general anesthesia. Thiopental, 4 mg/kg, 1.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.3 mg/kg midazolam, or 0.15 mg/kg midazolam, and 0.75 mg/kg ketamine, were administered intravenously in a randomized fashion to 80 patients undergoing emergency surgery. Adequacy of induction, hemodynamic changes, and postoperative effects were assessed during and after a standardized induction-maintenance anesthetic technique. Midazolam had the slowest onset (15-60 s) and longest duration of action. During induction, thiopental decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 11%, ketamine increased MAP by 10%, while neither midazolam nor the midazolam-ketamine combination significantly changed MAP. Heart rate (HR) increased during induction in all groups; however, the increase was significantly less in the combination group. After intubation, MAP and HR increased to the same extent in all four groups. Significantly more patients who received ketamine for induction were disoriented during emergence. Midazolam most effectively produced anxiolysis and antegrade amnesia. Significantly more patients who received thiopental felt depressed postoperatively, and 95% required parenteral opiate analgesics in the recovery room. Dreaming was highest after ketamine (55%) and lowest after midazolam (0%) and the combination (5%). Thus, midazolam effectively attenuated both the cardiostimulatory responses and unpleasant emergence reactions associated with ketamine. The author concludes that both midazolam and the midazolam-ketamine combination are safe and effective induction agents for emergency surgery, which may offer an advantage over thiopental in situations where hemodynamic stability is crucial. Furthermore, midazolam effectively attenuates the side effects of ketamine.", 
    "51": "Renal hemodynamic changes associated with thiopental, diazepam, and ketamine were studied in conscious dogs after previous surgical placement of an aortic catheter and a Doppler ultrasonic flow probe on the left renal artery. Thiopental, 10 mg/kg, changed blood pressure minimally whereas 20 mg/kg significantly decreased blood pressure by 5% to 10%. Renal blood flow initially increased significantly, then returned to control levels after both doses. Renal resistance was not significantly altered by 10 mg/kg of thiopental whereas 20 mg/kg significantly reduced resistance by 10%. Diazepam, 1 and 2 mg/kg, caused transient increases in arterial pressure of approximately 10%. Renal blood flow significantly decreased 5% to 10% from control levels with both doses. Renal resistance did not change with the 1-mg/kg dose of diazepam, but 2 mg/kg of diazepam increased it by 8% to 12%. Ketamine, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, elevated arterial pressure 20% to 40%. Renal blood flow increased significantly by 10% to 15% with both doses of ketamine. This effect lasted longer with the large dose. Renal resistance was significantly elevated by the 2.5-mg/kg dose of ketamine, whereas 5 mg/kg did not alter this variable. In conclusion, each of these drugs maintains renal blood flow reasonably well in an unanesthetized animal. However, ketamine appears to be more beneficial than thiopental, which in turn, is superior to diazepam in this regard. Little dose-response effect was evident for any of the drugs. Furthermore, it should be noted that changes in arterial pressure can be misleading when perfusion of this vascular bed is considered.", 
    "52": "Arterial and venous concentrations of phenobarbital, phenytoin, clonazepam, and diazepam were followed for 12 hr after a rapid intravenous injection. Initial blood samples were collected at intervals of only 5 sec. The arterial curves were initially much higher and steeper than the venous. For all four drugs the arterial curves could be described as triexponential functions. The initial part of the arterial curves were used in determining the initial supply to and uptake rate in the organs.", 
    "53": "The permeability across the blood-brain barrier of phenobarbital, phenytoin, clonazepam, and diazepam was determined in a total of 29 patients with the double-indicator dilution method. Cerebral blood flow was measured with the 133Xe intra-arterial injection method. The unidirectional extraction (E) of the four drugs was 0.07, 0.11, 0.42, and 0.42, respectively. Permeability surface area products (PS) calculated for the drugs depended on E as well as on the plasma protein binding of the drugs and the cerebral blood flow and was calculated as 0.1, 0.5, 0.5, and 2.6 ml gm-1 min-1, respectively. A mathematic model of cerebral uptake and concentration is presented. The brain concentration of each drug is then calculated for two different states, one with a sudden rise from zero to an arterial concentration, which remains constant, and the other with the arterial concentration, which is achieved after rapid intravenous injection. The cerebral uptake rate of clonazepam and diazepam was much more rapid than that of phenobarbital and phenytoin. After intravenous clonazepam or diazepam injection, half-maximal gray matter concentration is reached about 15 sec after the drug arrives at the brain.", 
    "54": "Free fractions of diazepam (D alpha), warfarin (W alpha), and methadone (M alpha) were measured in plasma obtained from 37 Kutchin Athapaskan Indians. Mean D alpha (3.42%) varied directly with free fatty acid concentration (r = 0.65, P less than 0.001) and was higher than previously found in other groups. These higher levels of fatty acids were associated with lower W alpha (r = -0.43, P = 0.007), and W alpha rose with time after a meal (r = 0.42, P = 0.01) when fatty acids usually fall. Mean W alpha was 0.72% and increased with age (r = 0.47, P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, age, fatty acids, and time after the last meal together accounted for 42% of intersubject variation in W alpha. W alpha and D alpha were inversely correlated (r = -0.33, P = 0.04), a result of the strong effects of fatty acids in these drugs. In contrast to both D alpha and W alpha, intersubject differences in M alpha correlated inversely with alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentration (r = -0.50, P = 0.001), but not fatty acids.", 
    "55": "The cardiovascular effects of midazolam 0.2 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied during the induction of anaesthesia in 16 premedicated patients subjected to cardiac surgery. In eight patients with coronary artery disease in whom global resting left ventricular function was normal the haemodynamic changes were small and observations on arterial pressure, cardiac index, stroke index, cardiac filling pressures, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance appeared to parallel those accompanying deep sleep in healthy volunteers. In eight patients with valvular heart disease and haemodynamic evidence of moderately impaired cardiac performance, pump function during induction with midazolam was maintained, probably as a result of the tendency towards a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Midazolam appears to be a valuable alternative to conventional induction agents without adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.", 
    "56": "Bilateral microinjection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the lateral septum resulted in a behavioural profile in the Social Interaction test of anxiety similar to that seen after chronically-administered benzodiazepines. In contrast, bilateral microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine into this locus did not alter the profile of rats tested in this model. In a colony-intruder model of aggression, the 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesioned rats showed decreased dominance, while the 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats showed increased dominance and reduced subordination. The results suggest that lateral septal 5-hydroxytryptamine, but not catecholamines, is important in the control of anxiety, whereas both lateral septal 5-hydroxytryptamine and catecholamines are involved in the control of aggression.", 
    "57": "Two benzodiazepine antagonists were tested in an animal model of anxiety, the social interaction test. Ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (1 and 2 mg/kg) had a potent anxiogenic action; the imidazodiazepine RO 15-1788 (4-10 mg/kg) had a weak anxiogenic effect that with a larger dose (20 mg/kg) disappeared and RO 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) significantly counteracted the anxiogenic effect of the beta-carboline (1 mg/kg). The implications of these results for the understanding of the pharmacological basis of anxiety and for the existence and nature of an endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site are discussed.", 
    "58": "A comprehensive review, evaluating 51 randomized double-blind controlled studies, covering different aspects of epileptology, is presented. Trials were grouped according to the investigated topic and for each group an attempt was made to derive an overall conclusion. The majority of studies investigated antiepileptic drug treatments. Other topics were: psychotropic effect of antiepileptic drugs, folic acid and vitamin D administration in epilepsy, and EEG investigations. A cross-sectional analysis of items such as designs, patient sampling principles, recording of effect parameters and side effects, concomitant treatments, and statistical evaluations demonstrated that cross-over designs, investigating fixed dosage schedules, were extensively used. Less than half of these studies included a washout period between treatments, complicating the interpretation of the obtained results. The vast majority of studies involved only chronic patients; and marked heterogeneity in patient selection with respect to age, seizure type, and mental status, and severity of epilepsy was observed. Classifications of seizures varied between the studies. The most prominent effect parameter was seizure frequency. The use of heterogeneous patient samples frequently necessitated equalization of widely different seizure types in order to perform statistical analyses. The mean duration of trials was 6 months, precluding evaluation of chronic toxicity. The majority of studies recorded side effects, but data collection was rather unsystematic and statistical evaluation was seldom applied. Most studies were add-on trials, and since concomitant treatment was frequently changed during the investigations, it was difficult to evaluate the influence of this variable. A correlation analysis across trials demonstrated, among other things, that the common assumption that short controlled trials provide too optimistic results, could not be substantiated. This survey provides no firm indication of which drug is more suitable for which seizure type.", 
    "59": "Audiogenic seizure-prone mice (DBA/2J) were exposed to a broad band noise source. A reproducible response consisting of wild run, clonus, and tonic stages resulted in all mice. Layers 1 and pyramidal from the parietal cortex and the molecular and Purkinje cell-rich layers from the cerebellar vermis were separately analyzed for glucose, glycogen, ATP, and phosphocreatine. Results showed a biphasic cerebellar response, with decreases in high energy phosphates occurring during the wild run and tonic stage. In the cortex, similar changes occurred in the pyramidal cell layer, but the decreases were not as pronounced as those in the cerebellum. Cells from layer 1 of the parietal cortex were not affected as much as those of the pyramidal layer, suggesting a differential effect between neuronal and nonneuronal cell populations. The greater response of the cerebellum could indicate an attempt to reduce the severity of both the wild run and the tonic extension seizure.", 
    "60": "Recent advances in the diagnosis of epilepsy include the development of a clinically useful classification of epileptic seizures and the recognition of specific epileptic disorders. These advances have been aided by the advent of x-ray computed tomography, long-term electroencephalographic telemetry, and video monitoring. Techniques for functional imaging of the human brain promise even greater diagnostic capabilities. New antiepileptic drugs have improved medical management, and technical and theoretical advances in pharmacokinetics have permitted physicians to design balanced dosing for individual patients. Although currently underused, surgical treatment of partial complex epilepsy can be safe and effective when used appropriately. Operant conditioning of electroencephalography may become another practical alternative therapy. Contributions of basic research to understanding the complications of status epilepticus have influenced treatment protocols and greatly improved the prognosis of this potentially lethal condition.", 
    "61": "At the Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinics in San Francisco, the recreational use of cocaine is on a precipitous incline of popularity. Intensified symptoms of intoxication and the possibility of overdose parallel the current fad of smoking \"freebase.\" We examined the \"cocaine reaction,\" an adrenergic storm affecting CNS, respiratory and cardiovascular systems, which may proceed to generalized collapse and death within minutes. The physiologic and pharmacologic mechanisms of the reaction are elaborated, and a logical algorithm of treatment is outlined. The psychodynamics of the \"armed\" cocaine personality is discussed, as is the proper psychological approach to these patients. A specific indicated technical and pharmacologic approach, as well as several caveats of therapy that have been clinically developed in the treatment of several hundred cases of cocaine overdose, are presented.", 
    "62": "Subjects with panic disorder (N = 23) were randomized into a crossover design involving diazepam, placebo, relaxation therapy, or control. Anxiety was measured by a 3-day hourly diary, psychological tests, and assessment of heart rate and skin conductance level during baseline, stress test, and interview. The greatest and only significant physiologic changes occurred with diazepam. The largest pre/posttreatment changes on the psychological tests and self-reported anxiety and depression occurred with relaxation, although the differences were not statistically significant. Relaxation therapy may be useful for treating the general anxiety associated with panic disorder.", 
    "63": "Compounds from both the beta-carboline (BC) and xanthine groups have been suggested to be the natural ligands for benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors. In this study we examined the effects of several BC's and caffeine, 1,3,7-trimethylxanthine, on the binding of 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FZ) and beta-3H-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (3H-BCCE) to the BZ receptors of rat and mouse brain. In mice, convulsion-producing doses of caffeine (120 mg/kg intravenously) and harmane (30 mg/kg intravenously) lowered the specific binding of 3H-FZ in vivo by 12-31%. A tremorogenic dose of harmaline (30 mg/kg intravenously) increased binding by 31%. Caffeine and harmane also slightly decreased the in vivo binding of 3H-BCCE, a compound that binds preferentially to the cerebellar type of BZ receptors. Harmaline stimulated the binding of 3H-BCCE only in the forebrain. Both harmaline and harmane increased by 41-111% the amount of 3H-BCCE that was distributed to the brain. In vitro BC's and caffeine displaced 3H-FZ from receptors in the rat brain with various Ki values (4.7 to 206.9 microM). The antagonism for BZ binding was competitive and in Scatchard analysis produced linear plots. Exceptions were harmaline and caffeine in the forebrain: both exhibited curvilinear plots for 3H-FZ binding. Harmaline increased the binding, and caffeine decreased it by altering the affinity of a subgroup of BZ receptors. In the hindbrain both harmaline and caffeine inhibited binding and produced linear plots. BC-induced tremor and convulsions unveil a large number of spare receptors in the brain, and these seem to be of the cerebellar type of BZ receptors. In addition, our results show that tremorogenic and convulsive BC's act differently on BZ receptors: during harmaline-induced tremor the affinity of some BZ receptors is increased, while harmane-induced convulsions are connected to direct occupation of BZ receptors.", 
    "64": "Using a milk reinforced two-lever operant procedure, rats were trained to discriminate 3 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide (CDP) from saline. Following this, generalization experiments were conducted with the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872, a synthetic non-benzodiazepine (BDZ) ligand for the BDZ receptor. CL 218,872 produced CDP lever selection in a dose related fashion and thus generalized to the standard CDP treatment. However, this generalization was antagonized by the concurrent administration of pentylenetetrazol or amphetamine, but not by strychnine or bicuculline. Also, there was evidence for cross tolerance for a sedative effect between CDP and CL 218,872.", 
    "65": "Results are presented of a comprehensive drug study carried out on specimens from drivers and pedestrians fatally injured in Ontario. Toxicological analyses were regularly performed on blood and urine and occasionally on vitreous humor, stomach contents, and liver. The analytical procedures could detect and quantitate a wide variety of drugs including such illicit drugs as Cannabis. With respect to drivers, alcohol was found in 57% of the study sample and drugs other than alcohol, in 26%. However, in only 9.5% of the drivers were psychoactive drugs (other than alcohol) detected in the blood in concentrations that may adversely affect driving skills. Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and diazepam accounted for a majority of the findings in this category.", 
    "66": "It was suggested that diazepam action is mediated by the GABA-ergic system. This suggestion was controlled in vitro experiments with hippocampal slices. The GABA-ergic system was blocked by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The influence of diazepam (1 X 10(-6) M) on the population spikes (PS) evoked in the CA1 area by Schaffer's collaterals stimulation manifested itself in a reversible decrease. Bicuculline (1 X 10(-7) M) and picrotoxin (1 X 10(-6) M) induced an increase in the PS amplitude and appearance of additional PS. Diazepam was normally ineffective when applied in conjunction with bicuculline or picrotoxin. The data indicate that the action of diazepam is really mediated by the GABA-ergic system.", 
    "67": "The convulsant benzodiazepine Ro 5-3663, bicuculline and picrotoxin induced electroencephalographic (EEG) and behavioural convulsions. In rabbits, the EEG modifications consisted, with increasing doses, of three different patterns: slow waves in the optic lead, spike- and wave-complexes in the sensorimotor cortex, and grand-mal generalized seizures. These EEG effects were terminated by administration of diazepam (1 mg/kg) and morphine (0.25-1.0 mg/kg). Naloxone, in doses of 5-10 mg/kg, potentiated the effects of the three convulsant drugs. This potentiating phenomenon was also antagonized by the administration of diazepam and morphine. In membrane preparations, obtained from rat cortex, deprived of endogenous modulators of [3H]GABA binding, naloxone but not morphine, was able to inhibit [3H]GABA binding to its specific recognition sites. These data agree with previous findings indicating a GABA-antagonistic effect of naloxone, and support the hypothesis that the anticonvulsant effect of morphine might be, at least in part, due to an increase in GABAergic activity at the synaptic level.", 
    "68": "Benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide and diazepam) produced a dose-dependent decrease in the discharge rate of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of freely moving cats. This ranged from no significant change at doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg (i.p.), to greater than 90% reductions in unit activity at 10 mg/kg. The effects of benzodiazepines on raphe units occurred within 15-30 min of injection and the duration of action was dose-dependent and lasted from 1 to more than 6 hr. Doses of benzodiazepines that significantly decreased raphe unit activity (i.e. 2.5-10 mg/kg) also produced ataxia and decreased EMG activity. These data suggest that benzodiazepine-induced suppression of raphe unit activity is closely related to general motor behavior. Raphe unit activity remained suppressed during phasic increases in EMG activity during eating, grooming, or predatory behavior, suggesting that benzodiazepines also have a direct inhibitory action on raphe cells. The present results are discussed in the context of the serotonergic hypothesis of anxiety."
