To date, no drug-like, selective inhibitors have been reported. We use a recombinant substrate based on the amino-terminus of BRI2 fused to amyloid \u03b2 1-25 (A\u03b21-25) (FBA) to develop facile, cost-effective SPP/SPPL protease assays. Co-transfection of expression plasmids expressing the FBA substrate with SPP/SPPLs were conducted to evaluate cleavage, which was monitored by ELISA, Western Blot and immunoprecipitation/MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry (IP/MS). No cleavage is detected in the absence of SPP/SPPL overexpression. Multiple \u03b3-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and (Z-LL)2 ketone differentially inhibited SPP/SPPL activity; for example, IC50 of LY-411,575 varied from 51\u00b179 nM (on SPPL2a) to 5499\u00b1122 nM (on SPPL2b), while Compound E showed inhibition only on hSPP with IC50 of 1465\u00b193 nM. Data generated were predictive of effects observed for endogenous SPPL2a cleavage of CD74 in a murine B-Cell line. Thus, it is possible to differentially inhibit SPP family members. These SPP/SPPL cleavage assays will expedite the search for selective inhibitors. The data also reinforce similarities between SPP family member cleavage and cleavage catalyzed by \u03b3-secretase.", 
    "1": "New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is defined as a sudden onset of refractory status epilepticus in patients who do not have a history of epilepsy. It is a neurologic emergency, and determining the underlying etiology is an important factor for effectively managing and predicting the prognosis of NORSE. We describe the case of a 28-year-old woman who was hospitalized with NORSE secondary to an unknown etiology. She did not respond to traditional anticonvulsant therapy, including benzodiazepines, fosphenytoin, propofol, and levetiracetam. The patient was placed on continuous electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring and was treated further with multiple antiepileptics, which were titrated aggressively based on EEG readings and therapeutic drug levels; despite this treatment, EEG monitoring revealed continued seizures. Thus, high-dose corticosteroids were started for seizure control. Her workup included computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the head, a lumbar puncture, toxicology screening, and extensive testing for multiple infectious and inflammatory etiologies. The patient's history revealed recent exposure to a new cat. Serologic results were positive for Bartonella henselae, and she was diagnosed with cat-scratch disease (CSD). She did not have the typical presentation of symptoms of lymphadenopathy, however, which is common in CSD. Doxycycline 100\u00a0mg and rifampin 300\u00a0mg twice daily were added to the patient's anticonvulsant and corticosteroid therapy. She was hospitalized for a total of 26\u00a0days and discharged with only minor neurologic impairment (short-term memory deficits and minor cognitive problems). The patient was discharged receiving antiepileptics, antibiotics, and a corticosteroid taper. To our knowledge, this is the first clinically known case of NORSE secondary to CSD without typical CSD symptoms in the adult population. The patient failed to respond to traditional anticonvulsant therapy alone. With the addition of high-dose corticosteroids to aggressive anticonvulsant therapy, seizure control was achieved. Further studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of high-dose corticosteroid and anticonvulsant therapy followed by antibiotics in patients with NORSE secondary to CSD.",

Although, several epidemiological or clinical studies about anxiety disorders in pregnancy exist, data on their treatment are very limited. Similar to other anxiety disorders, specific pharmacological treatment approaches in pregnant women with panic disorder (PD) have not been discussed in the literature. An important issue in the treatment of pregnant women with any psychiatric diagnosis is the risk-benefit profile of pharmacotherapy. Therefore, the treatment should be individualized. Untreated PD seems to be associated with several negative outcomes in the pregnancy. When the results of current study regarding the safety of pharmacological agents on the fetus and their efficacy in PD were gathered, sertraline, citalopram, imipramine and clomipramine at low doses for pure PD, and venlafaxine appeared to be more favorable than the other potential drugs.

These methods which have been commonly used in neuroimaging and also simulated studies have been applied on a real case of pharmaco-EEG study where the effects of increasing benzodiazepine doses on the central nervous system measured by LORETA were investigated. Data consisted of EEG recordings obtained from nine volunteers who received single oral doses of alprazolam 0.25, 0.5, and 1\u00a0mg, and placebo in a randomized crossover double-blind design. The identification of active regions was highly dependent on the selected multiple test correction procedure.

    "32": "OBJECTIVE To analyze the perception of and motivation for the chronic use of benzodiazepine among older adults. METHODS A qualitative study was conducted on 22 older adults living in Bambu\u00ed, MG, Southeastern Brazil, who were taking benzodiazepines and had the clinical and cognitive ability to respond to interview questions. The collected data were analyzed on the basis of the \"signs, meanings, and actions\" model. RESULTS The main reasons pointed out for the use of benzodiazepines were \"nervousness\", \"sleep problems\", and \"worry\" due to family and financial problems, everyday problems, and existential difficulties. None of the interviewees said that they used benzodiazepines in a dose higher than that recommended or had been warned by health professionals about any risks of their continuous use. Different strategies were used to obtain the prescription for the medication, and any physician would prescribe it, indicating that a bond was established with the drug and not with the health professional or healthcare service. Obtaining and consuming the medication turned into a crucial issue because benzodiazepine assumes the status of an essential food, which leads users to not think but sleep. It causes a feeling of relief from their problems such as awareness of human finitude and fragility, existential difficulties, and family problems. CONCLUSIONS Benzodiazepine assumes the characteristics of polyvalence among older adults, which extrapolate specific clinical indications, and of essentiality to deal with life's problems in old age. Although it relieves the \"nerves\", the chronic use of benzodiazepines buffers suffering and prevents older adults from going through the suffering. This shows important difficulties in the organization and planning of strategies that are necessary for minimizing the chronic use in this population.", 
    "33": "Humans liberally use ethanol for its facilitating effects on social interactions but its effects on central nervous system function remain underexplored. We have recently described that very low doses of ethanol abolish long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity in human cortex, most likely through enhancement of tonic inhibition [L\u00fccke et al, 2014, Neuropsychopharmacology 39:1508-18]. Here, we studied the effects of low-dose ethanol on long-term depression (LTD)-like plasticity. LTD-like plasticity was induced in human motor cortex by paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation (PASLTD), and measured as decreases of motor evoked potential input-output curve (IO-curve). In addition, sedation was measured by decreases in saccade peak velocity (SPV). Ethanol in two low doses (EtOH<10mM, EtOH<20mM) was compared to single oral doses of alprazolam (APZ, 1mg) a classical benzodiazepine, and zolpidem (ZLP, 10 mg), a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, in a double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled crossover design in ten healthy human subjects. EtOH<10mM and EtOH<20mM but not APZ or ZLP enhanced the PASLTD-induced LTD-like plasticity, while APZ and ZLP but not EtOH<10mM or EtOH<20mM decreased SPV. Non-sedating low doses of ethanol, easily reached during social drinking, enhance LTD-like plasticity in human cortex. This effect is most likely explained by the activation of extrasynaptic \u03b14-subunit containing gamma-aminobutyric type A receptors by low-dose EtOH, resulting in increased tonic inhibition. Findings may stimulate cellular research on the role of tonic inhibition in regulating excitability and plasticity of cortical neuronal networks.", 
    "34": "Sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) is classified as an NREM-related parasomnia characterized by recurrent episodes of dysfunctional eating that occur after an arousal from the main sleep period with partial or complete amnesia for the event, resulting in weight gain from eating high calorie foods and causing various injuries due to consumption of inedible or toxic items. SRED can be idiopathic or commonly associated with other primary sleep disorders such as sleepwalking, restless legs syndrome (RLS), obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), other clinical conditions, or use of sedative-hypnotic medications. First-line treatment of idiopathic SRED includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at mean dosages of 20 to 30\u00a0mg/day. Topiramate at 100-300\u00a0mg/day and clonazepam at 0.5-2.0\u00a0mg/day can be valid alternative options. SRED related to other parasomnias or sleep disturbances that cause sleep fragmentation benefit most from treatment of the associated sleep disorder. In particular, RLS-related SRED is best treated with dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, while sleepwalking-related SRED benefits from low-dose benzodiazepines such as clonazepam. Different kinds of drug associations have been proposed in a limited number of cases, especially in the past. We strongly recommend that all patients suffering from SRED should undergo consistent and regular follow-up about 2-3 times per year or otherwise according to the physician's judgment, in order to assess the evolution of symptom severity and frequency and re-evaluate treatment efficacy and any side effects that may arise.",

The Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) and maximum velocity (Vmax) of midazolam were estimated using the Michaelis-Menten equation. The Km of CYP3A2 midazolam remained unchanged, but the Vmax decreased at 28\u2009\u00b0C. In rats, whose temperature was maintained at 37, 32 or 28\u2009\u00b0C by a heat lamp or ice pack, the plasma concentrations of midazolam were higher, whereas those in the brain and liver were unchanged at 28\u2009\u00b0C. The tissue/plasma concentration ratios were, however, increased significantly. The unbound fraction of midazolam in serum at 28\u2009\u00b0C was half that at 37\u2009\u00b0C. These pharmacokinetic changes associated with hypothermic conditions were due to reductions in CYP3A2 activity and protein binding.",

In this study, the antidepressive effect of the total alkaloid of YuanHu (YHTA) was investigated in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) rat model using 1H-NMR-based metabonomics. Plasma metabolic profiles were analyzed and multivariate data analysis was applied to discover the metabolic biomarkers in CUMS rats. Thirteen biomarkers of CUMS-introduced depression were identified, which are myo-inositol, glycerol, glycine, creatine, glutamine, glutamate, \u03b2-glucose, \u03b1-glucose, acetoacetate, 3-hydroxybutyrate, leucine and unsaturated lipids (L7, L9). Moreover, a metabolic network of the potential biomarkers in plasma perturbed by CUMS was detected. After YHTA treatment, clear separation between the model group and YHTA-treated group was achieved. The levels of all the abnormal metabolites mentioned above showed a tendency of restoration to normal levels. The results demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of YHTA against depression and suggested that NMR-based metabolomics can provide a simple and easy tool for the evaluation of herbal therapeutics.",

Midazolam is a positive allosteric modulator of synaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors in the brain. It potentiates GABAergic inhibition and thereby controls hyperexcitability and seizures. Midazolam is administered intravenously or intramuscularly to control acute seizures and SE. Due to its favorable pharmacokinetic features, midazolam is being considered as a replacement anticonvulsant for diazepam in the antidote kit for nerve agents.

In all experiments, male Wistar rats were first tested in FEP to be categorized according to their levels of trait anxiety (high, medium and low). Then, only medium trait anxiety rats were selected to be tested again in FEP, two weeks later, after being pharmacologically treated, according to each experiment as follows: Experiment I: 0.5mg/kg of diazepam (DZP) or vehicle; Experiment II: 20mg/kg of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or vehicle; Experiment III: 5mg/kg of fluoxetine (FLX5) or vehicle: and Experiment IV: 0.5mg/kg of fluoxetine (FLX0.5) or vehicle. As a group, the results showed that PTZ and FLX5 increased levels of trait anxiety and reduced locomotor activity, whereas DZP and FLX0.5 decreased levels of trait anxiety, without impairing locomotor activity. These results demonstrate that FEP for rats is able to predict clinical anxiolytic and anxiogenic activities of different drugs, including fluoxetine, which is believed to present a dual effect on anxiety. Therefore, this paradigm can be proposed as an effective method for testing potential trait anxiety-reducing drugs, in rats.", 
    "51": "The aim of this study was to compare the effect of the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonist tandospirone versus that of the benzodiazepine hypnotic flunitrazepam in a rat model of long-term adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-induced sleep disturbance. Rats implanted with electrodes for recording electroencephalogram and electromyogram were injected with ACTH once daily at a dose of 100\u2009\u00b5g/rat. Administration of ACTH for 10\u2009d caused a significant increase in sleep latency, decrease in non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep time, and increase in wake time. Tandospirone caused a significant decrease in sleep latency and increase in non-REM sleep time in rats treated with ACTH. The effect of tandospirone on sleep patterns was antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635. In contrast, flunitrazepam had no significant effect on sleep parameters in ACTH-treated rats. These results clearly indicate that long-term administration of ACTH causes sleep disturbance, and stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor by tandospirone may be efficacious for improving sleep in cases in which benzodiazepine hypnotics are ineffective.",

Recent knockout studies in mice unexpectedly report normal or latent phenotypes, raising doubts about the protein's role in steroidogenesis and other previously postulated functions and challenging the validity of earlier data on the selectivity of TSPO-binding drugs.

    "57": "Parasomnias are a group of disorders characterized by abnormal behaviors, physical activities, and autonomic arousal symptoms while transition to sleep or continuation of sleep. Sleep terror (ST) is classified under parasomnias characterized by sudden fear attacks beginning with crying attacks or high-frequency screams and continuing with increased autonomic symptoms. ST occurs in the first few hours of sleep during the delta phase. Further, the lifetime prevalence of ST in adults is less than 1%. It is important to obtain; anamnesis from patients' bed partner for a clinical evaluation of ST. Methods, such as evaluating sleep diaries and video recordings, can help ST diagnosis. It is also important to evaluate patients' medical history, history of substance or alcohol abuse, psychological traumatic experiences, primary or secondary incomes, and detailed neurological aspects. Physician can select some serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCADs) as medical treatment if patients have a high frequency of attacks. Because of addiction and relapse of ST episodes, benzodiazepines are not preferred as the first-line treatment. In this study, we will discuss ST, which is rare in adulthood, and use of long-acting benzodiazepine based on two cases.",

Pharmaceuticals are nowadays considered as an important environmental contaminant. Chromatography methods which require expensive equipment and complicated sample pretreatment are used for detection of CECs in natural water. Thus, in this study we proposed a simple, fast, and low-cost voltammetric method as a screening tool for the determination of CECs in natural water prior to chromatography. A case study was conducted with alprazolam (benzodiazepine). The method was optimized and validated in-house. The limit of quantification was 0.4\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L(-1) for a 120\u00a0s preconcentration time. The recoveries ranged from 93 to 120\u00a0% for accuracy tests.

Doses of ketamine infusion ranged from 0.5 to 4 \u03bcg/kg/min. A low-dose ketamine infusion was used to reduce agitation in a patient requiring high doses of sedatives and analgesics. In a second patient, ketamine improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In a third patient, ketamine may have facilitated liberation from mechanical ventilation. In a fourth patient, ketamine was used for palliation to avoid lethargy. Ketamine may be considered to help decrease agitation, manage pain, facilitate opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal, prevent respiratory depression, and potentially manage depression and anxiety in chronically critically ill patients.",

Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and topiramate are the approved medications that were used for this object. To assess the role of non-pharmacologic therapy in the management of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, we analyzed effects of forced exercise by treadmill on alcohol dependent mice as an animal model. A total of 60 adult male mice were divided into 5 groups, from which 4 groups became dependent to alcohol (2 g/kg/day) for 15 days. From day 16, treatment groups were treated by diazepam (0.5mg/kg), forced exercise, and diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) concurrent with forced exercise for two weeks; And the positive control group received same dose of alcohol (2 g/kg/day) for two weeks. The negative control group received normal saline for four weeks. Finally, on day 31, all animals were observed for withdrawal signs, and Alcohol Total Withdrawal Score (ATWS) was determined. Blood cortisol levels were measured in non-fasting situations as well. Present findings showed that ATWS significantly decrease in all treatment groups in comparison with positive control group (P<0.05 for groups received diazepam and treated by forced exercise and P<0.001 for group under treatment diazepam + forced exercise). Moreover, blood cortisol level significantly decreased in all treatment groups (P<0.001). This study suggested that forced exercise and physical activity can be useful as adjunct therapy in alcoholism and can ameliorate side effects and stress situation of withdrawal syndrome periods.", 
    "66": "Stiff person syndrome (SPS) is a rare and disabling central nervous system disorder first described in 1956 and characterized by fluctuating rigidity and stiffness, gait impairment, and painful spasms of the axial and limb musculature. Although an underlying mechanism of impaired synaptic \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-ergic inhibition has been proposed, the exact mechanism remains unclear. The glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody, a marker for SPS, is a strong indication of disease and has been reported in approximately 70% of patients. The current treatment of choice is benzodiazepines and baclofen, both of which reduce motor unit potential firing and, therefore, decrease stiffness and spasms. However, patients continue to have substantial disability with pharmacologic therapy alone. This case report demonstrates the potential of osteopathic manipulative treatment as an adjunct to medication in the management of SPS. By decreasing somatic dysfunction and reducing the frequency of exacerbations, osteopathic manipulative treatment may alleviate the symptoms and overall morbidity associated with this disease.", 
    "67": "Most seizure emergencies occur outside of the hospital, and there is a need for treatment interventions that can be administered quickly and safely by nonclinical caregivers. Intranasal benzodiazepine administration does not require intravenous access and offers rapid seizure cessation. Intranasal midazolam is faster at aborting seizure activity than rectal diazepam and quicker to administer than intravenous diazepam. Although time to seizure cessation varies from study to study, intranasal midazolam is efficacious when administered not only by emergency department personnel but also by paramedics and caregivers in out-of-hospital and home settings. Absorption of midazolam intranasal formulations appears to be relatively rapid compared to diazepam formulations. Its shorter elimination half-life may also be beneficial in that patients may more quickly return to normal function because of rapid offset of effect. On the other hand, the faster rate of elimination of midazolam may expose patients to a higher rate of seizure recurrence compared with diazepam. Two diazepam formulations and one midazolam formulation are being currently developed for intranasal use. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Status Epilepticus\".",

As the range of toxicologically relevant compounds is continually changing due to the emergence of new psychoactive substances (NPS), laboratories are encountering analytical challenges. Current immunoassays are insufficient for determining the whole range of the drugs abused, and a broad-spectrum screening method is therefore needed. Here, the patterns of drug abuse in two groups of drug users were studied from urine samples using a comprehensive screening method based on high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The two groups comprised drug abusers undergoing opioid maintenance treatment (OMT) or drug withdrawal therapy and routinely visiting a rehabilitation clinic, and drug abusers with irregular attendance at a harm reduction unit (HRU) and suspected of potential NPS abuse. Polydrug abuse was observed in both groups, but was more pronounced among the HRU subjects with a mean number of concurrent drugs per sample of 3.9, whereas among the regularly treated subjects the corresponding number was 2.1. NPS and pregabalin were more frequent among HRU subjects, and their abuse was always related to drug co-use. The most common drug combination for an HRU subject included amphetamine, cannabis, buprenorphine, benzodiazepine, and alpha-pyrrolidinovalerophenone. A typical set of drugs for treated subjects was buprenorphine, benzodiazepine, and occasionally amphetamine. Abuse of several concurrent drugs poses a higher risk of drug intoxication and a threat of premature termination of OMT. Since the subjects attending treatment used fewer concurrent drugs, this treatment could be valuable in reducing polydrug abuse.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of asiatic acid and its potential modulation of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor. Fifty-five male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into 5 groups: vehicle (DMSO), asiatic acid (AA), midazolam, or a combination of flumazenil + AA or midazolam + AA, and injected intraperitoneally 30 minutes prior to testing. The rats were tested on the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Forced Swim Test (FST). Data were analyzed using a two-tailed multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Significance was found regarding the ratio of open arm time, maximum speed, and time spent mobile in the AA group and the midazolam + AA group (P < .05). Flumazenil decreased the anxiolytic effects, suggesting that AA modulates the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor.

We conducted a population-based, nested case-control study linking healthcare and coroner's records in Ontario, Canada, from January 31, 1994 to December 31, 2010. We included social assistance recipients receiving methadone for an opioid use disorder. Within this group, cases were those who died of opioid-related causes. For each case, we identified up to 5 controls matched on calendar quarter. The primary analysis examined the association between use of psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants or antipsychotics) and opioid-related mortality. Secondary analyses examined the associations between baseline characteristics, health service utilization, comorbidities and opioid-related mortality. Among 43,545 patients receiving methadone for an opioid use disorder, we identified 175 (0.4%) opioid-related deaths, along with 873 matched controls. Psychotropic drug use was associated with a two fold increased risk of opioid-related death (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.0; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2 to 3.5). Specifically, benzodiazepines (adjusted OR 1.6; 95% CI 1.1 to 2.5) and antipsychotics (adjusted OR 2.3; 95% CI 1.5 to 3.5) were independently associated with opioid-related death. Other associated factors included chronic lung disease (adjusted OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.6), an alcohol use disorder (adjusted OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 3.2), mood disorders (adjusted OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.0 to 3.2), and a history of heart disease (adjusted OR 5.3; 95% CI 2.0 to 14.0). Psychotropic drug use is associated with opioid-related death in patients receiving methadone. Mindfulness of these factors may reduce the risk of death among methadone recipients.", 
    "84": "In the visual cortex, synaptic plasticity is very high during the early developmental stage known as the critical period and declines with development after the critical period. Changes in the properties of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAA R) have been suggested to underlie the changes in the characteristics of plasticity. However, it is largely unknown how the changes in the two receptors interact to regulate synaptic plasticity. The present study investigates the changes in the properties of NMDAR and GABAA R from 3 to 5 weeks of age in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the rat visual cortex. The impact of these changes on the characteristics of long-term potentiation (LTP) is also investigated. The amplitude and decay time constant of GABAA R-mediated currents increased during this period. However, the decay time constant of NMDAR-mediated currents decreased as a result of the decrease in the proportion of the GluN2B subunit-mediated component. Induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP at 3 weeks depended on the GluN2B subunit, but LTP at 5 weeks did not. Enhancement of GABAA R-mediated inhibition suppressed the induction of LTP only at 5 weeks. However, partial inhibition of the GluN2B subunit with a low concentration of ifenprodil allowed the GABAA R-mediated suppression of LTP at 3 weeks. These results suggest that changes in the properties of NMDAR- and GABAA R-mediated synaptic transmission interact to determine the characteristics of synaptic plasticity during the critical period in the visual cortex.",

Factors associated with long-term BZDR use included female sex, AD, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, coronary artery disease, and asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The high prevalence of long-term BZDR use among individuals with AD is especially a cause for concern because long-term use may further impair cognition and may be associated with serious adverse events.",

    "121": "The last decade has witnessed the emergence of new chronopharmacological perspectives. In the case of sleep disorders, the accumulating evidence suggests that even a minor dysfunction in the biological clock can impact broadly upon body physiology causing increases in sleep onset latency, phase delays or advances in sleep initiation, frequent nocturnal awakenings, reduced sleep efficiency, delayed and shortened rapid eye movement sleep and increased periodic leg movements, among others. Thus, restoration of the adequate circadian pattern of proper sleep hygiene, targeted exposure to light and the use of chronobiotic drugs, such as melatonin, which affect the output phase of clock-controlled circadian rhythms, can help to recover the sleep-wake cycle. The optimization of drug effects and/or minimization of toxicity by timing medications with regard to biological rhythms is known as chronotherapeutics. While chronotherapeutical approaches have been particularly successful in the treatment of hypertension, allergies and some forms of cancer, a time-dependent pharmacological approach can be also effective when dealing with sleep disruptions like insomnia. A large proportion of patients under benzodiazepine (BZD)/Z drug treatment fail to achieve a complete and sustained recovery and are left with residual symptoms, like tolerance or dependency, that make relapse or recurrence more likely, and poorer quality of life a reality. Thus the chronic and extensive use of BZD/Z drugs has become a public health issue and has led to multiple campaigns to reduce both prescription and consumption of BZD/Z-drugs. This short review discusses available data on the efficacy of melatonin to reduce chronic BZD use in insomnia patients.", 
    "122": "To explore the EEG boundary of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) and the concept of \"possible NCSE\", we studied 14 consecutive patients with \u2264 2-Hz nonevolving periodic generalized epileptiform discharges (GPDs) in their first EEG after out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The pattern was associated with myoclonus in 11 patients. EG reactivity to antiseizure drugs (benzodiazepines and propofol), but without clinical improvement, was noted in 8 patients, satisfying the diagnostic criteria of \"possible NCSE\". Resolution of GPDs and emergence of physiological rhythms in follow-up EEGs and/or subsequent clinical improvement were noted in 6 of them, strongly suggesting that the initial slow nonevolving GPD pattern reflected NCSE significantly contributing to their coma. Background rhythms from 10 to 90% of the periods between GPDs were noted in 9 patients and appeared to correlate with reactivity of the GPD pattern to antiseizure drugs when 20% or more. Ten patients died, and four were discharged to longer care rehabilitation centers. Although based on few observations, preliminary evidence appears to indicate that in this context, nonevolving GPD frequencies as low as 0.8 Hz can reflect clinically significant NCSE and, therefore, warrant appropriate testing for possible reactivity. There is also some preliminary indication that background rhythms may be another important diagnostic and, perhaps, prognostic indicator, but this needs to be tested in large prospective studies. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled \"Status Epilepticus\".", 
    "123": "The elevated plus maze (EPM) test is used to examine anxiety-like behaviors in rodents. One interesting phenomenon in the EPM test is one-trial tolerance (OTT), which refers to the reduction in the anxiolytic-like effects of benzodiazepines when rodents are re-exposed to the EPM. However, the underlying mechanism of OTT is still unclear. In this study, we reported that OTT occurred when re-exposure to the EPM (trial 2) only depended on the prior experience of the EPM (trial 1) rather than diazepam treatment. This process was memory-dependent, as it was prevented by the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors antagonist MK-801 1.5h before trial 2. In addition, OTT was maintained for at least one week but was partially abolished after an interval of 28 days. Furthermore, the administration of the D1-like receptors agonist SKF38393 to the bilateral dorsal hippocampus largely prevented OTT, as demonstrated by the ability of the diazepam treatment to produce significant anxiolytic-like effects in trial 2 after a one-day interval. These findings suggest that OTT to the EPM test may occur via the activation of NMDA receptors and the inactivation of D1-like receptors in certain brain regions, including the hippocampus.", 
    "124": "In rodents, the behavioral and neurochemical effects resulting from the pharmacological blockade of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are unclear. Metyrapone, a corticosterone synthesis inhibitor, has been demonstrated to reduce cocaine-related behaviors, especially in a low-dose combination with oxazepam, a benzodiazepine. Although this combination therapy (MET/OX) also reduces drug-taking and drug-seeking behaviors in both rodents and cocaine-dependent humans, these effects are not correlated with plasma glucocorticoid levels. In this brief report, we present data demonstrating that this MET/OX combination enhances brain levels of the GABA-active steroid metabolites, tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) and allopregnanolone. Male rats, trained to self-administer cocaine or that received yoked-saline infusions, were pretreated with MET/OX, at doses that reduced cocaine-motivated responding, or vehicle. Allopregnanolone and THDOC were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (LC-MS/MS) in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala in the brains from these rats. THDOC levels were enhanced following MET/OX pretreatment in both brain regions, regardless of cocaine self-administration experience. However, allopregnanolone was selectively enhanced in the rats that self-administered cocaine, but not in rats in the yoked-saline group. Thus, the MET/OX combination increased neurosteroid content in brain regions important for drug addiction. These neurosteroids have been shown to reduce cocaine-related behaviors and may contribute to the behavioral effects of MET/OX combination therapy.", 
    "125": "Sleep deteriorates with age. The menopause is often a turning point for women's sleep, as complaints of insomnia increase significantly thereafter. Insomnia can occur as a secondary disorder to hot flashes, mood disorders, medical conditions, psychosocial factors, underlying intrinsic sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or restless legs syndrome (RLS), or it can be a primary disorder. Since unrecognized OSA can have dramatic health-related consequences, menopausal women complaining of persisting sleep disturbances suggesting primary insomnia or intrinsic sleep disorders should be referred to a sleep specialist for a comprehensive sleep assessment. Patients suffering from primary insomnia will be preferentially treated with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin, or with cognitive behavioural therapy. Insomnia related to vasomotor symptoms can be improved with hormone replacement therapy. Gabapentin and isoflavones have also shown efficacy in small series but their precise role has yet to be established. In patients suffering from OSA, non-pharmacological therapy will be applied: continuous positive airway pressure or an oral appliance, according to the severity of the disorder. In the case of RLS, triggering factors must be avoided; dopaminergic agonists are the first-line treatment for moderate to severe disease. In conclusion, persisting sleep complaints should be addressed in menopausal women, in order to correctly diagnose the specific causal disorder and to prescribe treatments that have been shown to improve sleep quality, quality of life and long-term health status.", 
    "126": "The recent technological advancements of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry allow the simultaneous determination of tens, or even hundreds, of target analytes. In such cases, the traditional approach to quantitative method validation presents three major drawbacks: (i) it is extremely laborious, repetitive and rigid; (ii) it does not allow to introduce new target analytes without starting the validation from its very beginning and (iii) it is performed on spiked blank matrices, whose very nature is significantly modified by the addition of a large number of spiking substances, especially at high concentration. In the present study, several predictive chemometric models were developed from closed sets of analytes in order to estimate validation parameters on molecules of the same class, but not included in the original training set. Retention time, matrix effect, recovery, detection and quantification limits were predicted with partial least squares regression method. In particular, iterative stepwise elimination, iterative predictors weighting and genetic algorithms approaches were utilized and compared to achieve effective variables selection. These procedures were applied to data reported in our previously validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry multi-residue method for the determination of pharmaceutical and illicit drugs in oral fluid samples in accordance with national and international guidelines. Then, the partial least squares model was successfully tested on naloxone and lormetazepam, in order to introduce these new compounds in the oral fluid validated method, which adopts reverse-phase chromatography. Retention time, matrix effect, recovery, limit of detection and limit of quantification parameters for naloxone and lormetazepam were predicted by the model and then positively compared with their corresponding experimental values. The whole study represents a proof-of-concept of chemometrics potential to reduce the routine workload during multi-residue methods validation and suggests a rational alternative to ever-expanding procedures progressively drifting apart from real sample analysis.", 
    "127": "Interleukin 1 (IL-1) plays a critical role in stress responses, and its mRNA is induced in the brain by restraint stress. Previously, we reported that IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) knockout (KO) mice, which lacked IL-1Ra molecules that antagonize the IL-1 receptor, showed anti-depression-like behavior via adrenergic modulation at the age of 8 weeks. Here, we report that IL-1Ra KO mice display an anxiety-like phenotype that is induced spontaneously by aging in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. This anxiety-like phenotype was improved by the administration of diazepam. The expression of the anxiety-related molecule glucocorticoid receptor (GR) was significantly reduced in 20-week-old but not in 11-week-old IL-1Ra KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. The expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) was not altered between IL-1Ra KO mice and WT littermates at either 11 or 20 weeks old. Analysis of monoamine concentration in the hippocampus revealed that tryptophan, the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA), and the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid (HVA) were significantly increased in 20-week-old IL-1Ra KO mice compared to littermate WT mice. These findings strongly suggest that the anxiety-like behavior observed in older mice was caused by the complicated alteration of monoamine metabolism and/or GR expression in the hippocampus.",

It is mainly produced by astrocytes under hypoxic conditions and has proven to have neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects. In the present study, we investigated the effect of midazolam on EPO expression in primary cultured astrocytes and the mouse brain. Midazolam was administered to 6-week-old BALB/c male mice under hypoxic conditions and pregnant C57BL/6N mice under normoxic conditions. Primary cultured astrocytes were also treated with midazolam under hypoxic conditions. The expression of EPO mRNA in mice brains and cultured astrocytes was studied. In addition, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), known as the main regulator of EPO, was evaluated. Midazolam significantly reduced the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of EPO in BALB/c mice brains and primary cultured astrocytes and suppressed EPO expression in the fetal brain. Midazolam did not affect the total amount of HIF proteins but significantly inhibited the nuclear expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 proteins. These results demonstrated the suppressive effects of midazolam on the hypoxia-induced up-regulation of EPO both in vivo and in vitro.",

    "137": "A novel paper spray cartridge with an integrated solid phase extraction (SPE) column is described. The cartridge performs extraction and pre-concentration, as well as sample ionization by paper spray, from complex samples such as plasma. The cartridge allows for selective enrichment of target molecules from larger sample volumes and removal of the matrix, which significantly improved the signal intensity of target compounds in plasma samples by paper spray ionization. Detection limits, quantitative performance, recovery, ionization suppression, and the effects of sample volume were evaluated for five drugs: carbamazepine, atenolol, sulfamethazine, diazepam, and alprazolam. Compared with direct paper spray analysis of dried plasma spots, paper spray analysis using the integrated solid phase extraction improved the detection limits significantly by a factor of 14-70, depending on the drug. The improvement in detection limits was, in large part, due to the capability of analyzing larger sample volumes. In addition, ionization suppression was found to be lower and recovery was higher for paper spray with integrated SPE, as compared to direct paper spray analysis. By spiking an isotopically labeled internal standard into the plasma sample, a linear calibration curve for the drugs was obtained from the limit of detection (LOD) to 1 \u03bcg/mL, indicating that this method can be used for quantitative analysis. The paper spray cartridge with integrated SPE could prove valuable for analytes that ionize poorly, in applications where lower detection limits are required, or on portable mass spectrometers. The improved performance comes at the cost of requiring a more complex paper spray cartridge and requiring larger sample volumes than those used in typical direct paper spray ionization.",

Additional doses of propofol of 0.5 mg/kg each were given to achieve sedation induction (modified Ramsay scale level 6), and further doses were administered during the procedure as required. A total of 92 children (PK, n = 47; PF, n = 45) were analyzed. P < 0.05 was considered significant.", 
    "158": "There was no difference in the propofol dose required for successful scope introduction and also in the need for additional propofol doses and the total additional propofol doses required in the first minute after sedation induction. Propofol injection pain was higher in the PF group (odds ratio 1.78). The adverse events and recovery time were similar. There was no escalation of care, airway intubations, death, or disability.", 
    "159": "Nonanesthetist-administered propofol sedation is feasible in teaching hospitals. Propofol requirement is similar in both PK and PF combination regimens, but the lower frequency of propofol injection pain may favor the use of PK.",

    "162": "A 75-year-old man, with a recently diagnosed carcinoma of the parotid gland, was admitted with a fluctuating psychiatric syndrome. Delirium was diagnosed, although an acute underlying somatic cause could not be readily established. Antipsychotics and benzodiazepines were not effective. After 7 sessions of ECT, all symptoms ceased. This enabled him to receive radiotherapy for his tumor and enjoy a good quality of life for the remaining 8 months of his life.",

    "164": "The present study investigates the influence of bromazepam while executing a motor task. Specifically, we intend to analyze the changes in alpha absolute power under two experimental conditions, bromazepam and placebo. We also included analyses of theta and beta frequencies. We collected electroencephalographic data before, during, and after motor task execution. We used a Two Way ANOVA to investigate the condition (PL \u00d7 Br6 mg) and moment (pre and post) variables for the following electrodes: Fp1, Fp2, F7, F3, Fz, F4, F8, C3, CZ and C4. We found a main effect for condition on the electrodes FP1, F7, F3, Fz, F4, C3 and CZ, for alpha and beta bands. For beta band we also found a main effect for condition on the electrodes Fp2, F8 and C4; for theta band we identified a main effect for condition on C3, Cz and C4 electrodes. This finding suggests that the motor task did not have any influence on the electrocortical activity in alpha, and that the existing modifications were a consequence due merely to the drug use. Despite its anxiolytic and sedative action, bromazepam did not show any significant changes when the individuals executed a finger extension motor task.",

The frequency of benzodiazepine use ranged from 8.5% to 20%. Five studies reported accelerated cognitive deterioration in association with benzodiazepine use. Two studies reported clinical efficacy for lorazepam and alprazolam to reduce agitation in Alzheimer's disease patients. No evidence was found for an improvement of sleep quality using benzodiazepines.",

The primary objective was to determine if veterans with PTSD who were receiving an SGA had first received SSRI or SNRI therapy in accordance with VA recommendations.", 
    "171": "Among 308 veterans who met the inclusion criteria, the average number of SSRI or SNRI agents prescribed prior to initiation of SGA therapy was 0.88. Only 19.8% of patients (n = 61) had been prescribed 2 SSRI or SNRI agents, with 48.4% of patients (n = 149) having received 1 agent. All evaluated courses of SSRI and SNRI therapy prior to SGA initiation were of sufficient duration (range, 5-30 months), and mean adherence rates were >80%. Current or past benzodiazepine use was documented in about 55% of patients (n = 170).",

Active prescriptions for benzodiazepines, hypnotics, antidepressants, and antipsychotic medications at the EOL were recorded. During EOL care, 28 (72%) participants with PTSD used these medications versus 55 (40%) of the non-PTSD participants (P = .0005). There was significant correlation between a lifetime diagnosis of PTSD with antidepressant use (P = .0002) and hypnotics (P = .0085) during EOL care but not with benzodiazepines or antipsychotics. The higher utilization of certain medication classes among participants with PTSD may indicate that PTSD treatment should continue at the EOL to improve care.", 
    "174": "Since drug-drug interaction (DDI) can affect organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) and cause clinical events, prediction of such DDI is important in early clinical development. Although statins are useful probes for OATP-mediated DDI, endogenous probes would be more practical for predicting such DDI. In this study, we investigate the possible use of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), an endogenous OATP substrate, in predicting OATP-mediated DDI in cynomolgus monkeys as a first step toward in human assessment. In in vitro experiments, both human and cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes showed a time- and temperature-dependent DHEAS uptake. Rifampicin (RIF), a typical OATP inhibitor, inhibited this uptake, indicating the involvement of OATP in DHEAS uptake. In in vivo experiments, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of DHEAS were significantly increased following administration of RIF 10 mg/kg, although the extent of this increase was lower than that observed with the test-statins used in this study. However, based on the results of in vitro hepatic DHEAS uptake, changes in DHEAS concentration are expected to be more prominent in human than in monkey. This shows for the first time that DHEAS may be used as endogenous probe for predicting OATP-mediated DDI.",

Patients receiving chronic opioids may suffer from unrecognized sleep apnea that contributes to opioid-overdose death. Currently, information regarding the perioperative management of patients with chronic opioid-associated CSA is limited. The objectives of this review are to define the clinical manifestations of SDB associated with chronic opioid therapy, especially CSA, and to highlight their prevalence, mechanisms, risk factors, and perioperative management.",

Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine meeting abstracts were also searched for relevant articles. We included all prospective, retrospective studies and case reports in which CSA and chronic opioid use was confirmed by polysomnography. CSA was defined as the absence of airflow for \u2265 10 seconds with the absence of breathing efforts. A Central Apnea Index \u2265 5 events/h was considered significant.", 
    "177": "The search strategy yielded 8 studies which included 560 patients. The overall prevalence of CSA in patients taking chronic opioids was high (24%). The morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) was strongly associated with the severity of the SDB, predominantly CSA, with an MEDD of >200 mg being a threshold of particular concern. Concurrent use of benzodiazepines or hypnotics was associated with the severity of CSA in one study. Body mass index was inversely related to the severity of SDB. There were various recommendations regarding the best type of positive airway pressure therapy for the treatment of opioid-associated CSA. Continuous positive airway pressure may be ineffective in eliminating, or may even increase, CSA. Adaptive servoventilation and bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation were effective according to some reports.", 
    "178": "The overall prevalence of CSA in patients taking chronic opioids was 24%. The most important risk factors for severity of CSA were an MEDD >200 mg, and low or normal body mass index. Continuous positive airway pressure is often ineffective for treating CSA. Limited data are available on the perioperative management of patients with CSA associated with chronic opioid use. Further prospective studies on the perioperative risks and management of these patients are needed.", 
    "179": "Quercetin is a plant flavonol that is available from both daily diet and nutraceuticals. To investigate the effect of acute and short-term intake of high-dose quercetin on CYP3A-mediated metabolism, 10 healthy volunteers received 7.5 mg oral midazolam without, with a single dose of 1500 mg quercetin and after 1-week supplementation with 1500 mg quercetin daily. A substudy was performed in three subjects to explore the impact of repeated quercetin intake on intravenously administered midazolam. Coadministration with a single dose of quercetin did not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam and its 1'-hydroxymetabolite, but following short-term quercetin intake, there was a trend to reduced midazolam exposure (geometric mean ratio of test-control area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC0-\u221e ): 0.82; 90% confidence interval: 0.61-1.10) and midazolam-metabolite AUC0-\u221e ratios were decreased by 9.7%-47.6% from control in seven subjects. The tendency was opposite when midazolam was given intravenously. We conclude that a single dose of quercetin would not provoke any toxic adverse events when coadministered with midazolam, whereas repeated quercetin intake can reduce systemic exposure to the orally given drug by increasing its CYP3A-catalyzed metabolism. As the effect deviated after intravenous drug administration, different mechanisms of interaction may be involved at the intestinal site compared with the liver.",

Acupuncture was performed on 20 participants over 4\u2005weeks, 3 times per week, on points ST8, GB2, TE21, SI19, SI18 and LI4 bilaterally as well as GV20 in the midline, each session lasting half an hour. Twenty-two patients took clonazepam once a day (0.5\u2005mg in the morning) for 2\u2005weeks and, after 2\u2005weeks, two tablets (0.5\u2005mg in the morning and in the evening) were taken for the next 2\u2005weeks. Prior to and 1\u2005month after either therapy, participants completed questionnaires: visual analogue scale, Beck Depression Inventory, Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS) pain scale, 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).",

The present study highlights virtual screening strategies in identification of high affinity small molecule non-peptidic inhibitors. Nutlin3A and RG7112 belonging to compound class of Cis-imidazoline, MI219 of Spiro-oxindole class and Benzodiazepine derived TDP 665759 served as query small molecules for similarity search with a threshold of 95%. The query molecules and the similar molecules corresponding to each query were docked at the transactivation binding cleft of MDM2 protein. Aided by MolDock algorithm, high affinity compound against MDM2 was retrieved. Patch Dock supervised Protein-Protein interactions were established between MDM2 and ligand (query and similar) bound and free states of p53. Compounds with PubCid 68870345, 77819398, 71132874, and 11952782 respectively structurally similar to Nutlin3A, RG7112, Mi219 and TDP 665759 demonstrated higher affinity to MDM2 in comparison to their parent compounds. Evident from the protein-protein interaction studies, all the similar compounds except for 77819398 (similar to RG 7112) showed appreciable inhibitory potential. Of particular relevance, compound 68870345 akin to Nutlin 3A had highest inhibitory potential that respectively showed 1.3, 1.2, 1.16 and 1.26 folds higher inhibitory potential than Nutilin 3A, MI 219, RG 7112 and TDP 1665759. Compound 68870345 was further mapped for structure based pharamacophoric features. In the study, we report Cis-imidazoline derivative compound; Pubcid: 68870345 to have highest inhibitory potential in blocking MDM2-p53 interactions hitherto discovered.",

At the endpoint, the responder rate was 54%, with 2 patients remaining clonic/tonic-clonic seizure-free. Twenty-two patients experienced stiripentol-related adverse events, with two having severe ones. They included somnolence (79%), loss of appetite (67%), ataxia (58%), and elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase (38%). No adverse events led to study discontinuation, but 19 patients required dose reduction for stiripentol and/or either antiepileptic drug combined. Stiripentol dose reduction was done in 9 patients, mostly due to somnolence or loss of appetite.", 
    "188": "During adjunctive stiripentol use with clobazam and valproate, careful monitoring for adverse events such as somnolence and loss of appetite is recommended, and dose reduction may become needed for any of the antiepileptics.

Not only was his insomnia remained untreated, but also he gradually became isolated, suspicious, and aggressive, and dropped out of university. He was then hospitalized in a psychiatric ward for 2 months, and was treated with antipsychotics and gradual discontinuation of zolpidem. With no improvement in psychosis and sleep improvement he was discharged. After two weeks he was hospitalized again and went under electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and antipsychotic therapy, and was discharged with relative improvement. Now, after three years, he is diagnosed with schizophrenia and with modest improvements he is under care and treatment.",

    "192": "The objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate complications in the management of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) treated with benzodiazepine and pentobarbital infusions. Of 28 children with RSE, eleven (39%) were treated with a pentobarbital infusion after failure to control RSE with a benzodiazepine infusion; while17 children (61%) required only a benzodiazepine infusion. The mean maximum pentobarbital infusion dosage was 5.2 \u00b1 1.8 mg/kg/h. Twenty-five patients received a continuous midazolam infusion with an average dosage of 0.41 \u00b1 0.43 mg/kg/h. The median length of stay was longer for the pentobarbital group. Children requiring pentobarbital therapy were more likely to develop hypotension, require inotropic support, need intubation, mechanical ventilation, peripheral nutrition, and blood products; furthermore, they were more likely to develop hypertension and movement disorder after or during weaning. In conclusion, children with RSE who required pentobarbital therapy had a longer hospital stay with more complications.", 
    "193": "Significant toxicity from amphetamine and cathinone derivatives is being increasingly reported. We describe a series of self-reported exposures to 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine (25-I-NBOME or 25-I), a novel amphetamine derivative. Ten patients with an average age of 17 years presented to local emergency departments (EDs) in our community after ingestion and/or insufflation of a drug referred to as \"25-I.\" Of 10 patients, 6 reported taking 25-I alone; other substances included ethanol; 2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenethylamine; marijuana; and ketamine. Most common effects included tachycardia (90%), hypertension (70%), agitation (60%), and hallucinations (50%). The average heart rate was 123 beats per minute. Two patients were found in status epilepticus, and another was found unresponsive. One patient who had a seizure had multiple, discrete intraparenchymal hemorrhages and acute kidney injury. Six patients were admitted to the intensive care unit, two were treated in the ED and released, and 1 each was admitted to psychiatry or managed in a clinical decision unit and subsequently discharged. Three patients required emergent intubation, and all admitted patients (7/10) were given intravenous benzodiazepines for sedation. Urine and blood specimens were obtained from 1 patient, which showed analytic confirmation of 25-I. In addition to sympathomimetic effects, methoxy and other substituent groups impart serotonergic effects, resulting in hallucinogenic properties. 2-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine appears to be extremely potent with a reported \"dose\" of 500 \u03bcg resulting in increased potential for inadvertent overdose.

Plasma levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4) and thyroid-peroxidase (TPO-Abs) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TG-Abs) were determined. Cognitive assessment was performed with the MATRICS Cognitive Consensus Cognitive Battery. We also explored the relationship between thyroid variables and cognition in three subgroups of psychotic patients: psychosis not otherwise specified, affective psychosis (bipolar disorder or schizoaffective disorder) and non-affective psychosis (schizophrenia or schizophreniphorm disorder).", 
    "196": "In patients with early psychosis, higher FT4 levels (but not TSH or thyroid antibodies) were associated with better cognitive performance in attention/vigilance and overall cognition. The relationship between FT4 levels and the attention/vigilance domain remained significant in a multivariate analysis after adjusting for education level, age, gender, substance use, and benzodiazepine and antipsychotic treatments. We did not find a significant association between FT4 and cognitive performance in HS. In the exploratory analysis by psychotic subtypes, subjects with affective psychosis had increased FT4 levels and better cognitive profile than those with non-affective psychosis.",

    "198": "It is widely recognized that patients presenting diabetes are at increased risk for fractures. In a retrospective case-control study, 101 cases were selected from medical charts of outpatients older than 70 with diabetes mellitus and a fracture within the past 5 years. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) had been measured within 4 months around the assessment. Each case was matched for sex and age with one control, diabetic patient with no fracture. HbA1c level was similar in both groups. Patients with fractures presented significantly lower BMIs than controls, and had a higher rate of declared osteoporosis and comorbidity. A small number of cases were using vitamin D supplements while more were treated with benzodiazepine, opiates and Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). This study suggests that, rather than the tight control of blood glucose, other factors such as medication and comorbidity could be associated with fracture risk in elderly diabetics.",

In the control group, normal saline was given during the same periods. Patients in the 2 groups received sufentanil and midazolam for sedation and pain relief when necessary. Agitation was monitored with the Riker Sedation-Agitation Scale in the PACU and delirium was monitored with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit for 5\u00a0days postoperatively.", 
    "201": "The overall incidence of agitation was similar between the 2 groups. However, when the influence of patient shifting was excluded, the incidence of agitation in the dexmedetomidine group was apparently lower than that in the control group (10.3 vs 30%; P\u00a0= .029). No difference was found in the occurrence of delirium between the experimental and control groups (5.1 vs 12.5%; P\u00a0= .432).",

    "203": "Recent evidence from animal and human studies suggests neuroprotective effects of the SSRI fluoxetine, e.g., in the aftermath of stroke. The underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be fully defined. Because of its effects on the cytochrome P450 system (CYP450), we hypothesized that neuroprotection by fluoxetine is related to altered metabolism of retinoic acid (RA), whose CYP450-mediated degradation in brain tissue constitutes an important step in the regulation of its site-specific auto- and paracrine actions. Using traditional pharmacological in vitro assays, the effects of fluoxetine on RA degradation were probed in crude synaptosomes from rat brain and human-derived SH-SY5Y cells, and in cultures of neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, retinoid-dependent effects of fluoxetine on neuronal survival following glutamate exposure were investigated in rat primary neurons cells using specific retinoid receptor antagonists. Experiments revealed dose-dependent inhibition of synaptosomal RA degradation by fluoxetine along with dose-dependent increases in RA levels in cell cultures. Furthermore, fluoxetine's neuroprotective effects against glutamate excitotoxicity in rat primary neurons were demonstrated to partially depend on RA signaling. Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that the potent, pleiotropic antidepressant fluoxetine directly interacts with RA homeostasis in brain tissue, thereby exerting its neuroprotective effects.", 
    "204": "Cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia is associated with a lower density of dendritic spines on deep layer 3 pyramidal cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). These alterations appear to reflect dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton required for spine formation and maintenance. Consistent with this idea, altered expression of genes in the cell division cycle 42 (CDC42)-CDC42 effector protein (CDC42EP) signaling pathway, a key organizer of the actin cytoskeleton, was previously reported in DLPFC gray matter from subjects with schizophrenia. We examined the integrity of the CDC42-p21-activated serine/threonine protein kinases (PAK)-LIM domain-containing serine/threonine protein kinases (LIMK) signaling pathway in schizophrenia in a layer-specific and cell type-specific fashion in DLPFC deep layer 3.", 
    "205": "Using laser microdissection, samples of DLPFC deep layer 3 were collected from 56 matched pairs of subjects with schizophrenia and comparison subjects, and levels of CDC42-PAK-LIMK pathway messenger RNAs were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.

    "206": "Relative to comparison subjects, CDC42EP4, LIMK1, LIMK2, ARHGDIA, and PAK3 messenger RNA levels were significantly upregulated in subjects with schizophrenia in laminar and cellular samples. In contrast, CDC42 and PAK1 messenger RNA levels were significantly downregulated specifically in deep layer 3 pyramidal cells. These differences were not attributable to psychotropic medications or other comorbid factors.",

    "213": "sec-Butylpropylacetamide (SPD) is a one-carbon homologue of valnoctamide (VCD), a chiral constitutional isomer of valproic acid's (VPA) corresponding amide--valpromide. Racemic-SPD and racemic-VCD possess a unique and broad-spectrum antiseizure profile superior to that of VPA. In addition, SPD blocks behavioral and electrographic status epilepticus (SE) induced by pilocarpine and the organophosphates soman and paraoxon. Valnoctamide has similar activity as SPD in the soman-induced SE model. The activity of SPD and VCD against SE is superior to that of diazepam and midazolam in terms of rapid onset, potency, and ability to block SE when given 20 to 60 min after seizure onset. sec-Butylpropylacetamide and VCD possess two stereogenic carbons in their chemical structure and, thus, exist as a racemic mixture of four individual stereoisomers. The anticonvulsant activity of the individual stereoisomers of SPD and VCD was comparatively evaluated in several anticonvulsant rodent models including the benzodiazepine-resistant SE model. sec-Butylpropylacetamide has stereoselective pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD). The higher clearance of (2R,3S)-SPD and (2S,3R)-SPD led to a 50% lower plasma exposure and, consequently, to a lower anticonvulsant activity compared to racemic-SPD and its two other stereoisomers. Racemic-SPD, (2S,3S)-SPD, and (2R,3R)-SPD have similar anticonvulsant activities and PK profiles that are better than those of (2R,3S)-SPD and (2S,3R)-SPD. Valnoctamide has a stereoselective PK with (2S,3S)-VCD exhibiting the lowest clearance and, consequently, a twice-higher plasma exposure than all other stereoisomers. Nevertheless, there was less stereoselectivity in VCD anticonvulsant activity, and each stereoisomer had similar ED50 values in most models. sec-Butylpropylacetamide and VCD stereoisomers did not cause teratogenicity (i.e., neural tube defect) in mice at doses 3-12 times higher than their anticonvulsant-ED50 values.

    "214": "Members of the cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) subfamily of drug metabolizing enzymes exhibit developmental changes in expression in human liver characterized by a transition between CYP3A7 and CYP3A4 over the first few years of life. In contrast, the developmental expression of CYP3A5 is less well understood due to polymorphic expression of the enzyme in human tissues as a result of the prevalence of the CYP3A5*3 allele, which leads to alternative splicing. We further explored the expression of CYP3A5 and the impact of alternative splicing on the variability of CYP3A5 functional activity in a large bank of human prenatal liver samples (7 to 32 weeks of age postconception). The expression of normally spliced CYP3A5 mRNA in all human fetal liver samples varied 235-fold whereas CYP3A5 SV1 mRNA was only detected in fetal liver samples with at least one CYP3A5*3 allele. Formation of 1'-OH midazolam (MDZ) varied 79-fold, and the ratio of 1'-OH MDZ to 4-OH MDZ varied 8-fold and depended on the presence or absence of the CYP3A5*3 allele. Formation of 4-OH MDZ was significantly associated with 1'-OH MDZ (r(2) = 0.76, P < 0.0001) but varied (36-fold) independently of CYP3A5 genotype or expression. The substantial interindividual variability that remains even after stratification for CYP3A5 genotype suggests that factors such as environmental exposure and epigenetic alterations act in addition to genetic variation to contribute to the variability of CYP3A5 expression in human prenatal liver.", 
    "215": "We developed murine CYP3A knockout ko chimeric mice with humanized liver expressing human P450S similar to those in humans and whose livers and small intestines do not express murine CYP3A this: approach may overcome effects of residual mouse metabolic enzymes like Cyp3a in conventional chimeric mice with humanized liver, such as PXB-mice [urokinase plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficiency (uPA/SCID) mice repopulated with over 70% human hepatocytes] to improve the prediction of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics in humans. After human hepatocytes were transplanted into Cyp3a KO/uPA/SCID host mice, human albumin levels logarithmically increased until approximately 60 days after transplantation, findings similar to those in PXB-mice. Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that hepatic human P450s, UGTs, SULTs, and transporters mRNA expression levels in Cyp3a KO chimeric mice were also similar to those in PXB-mice and confirmed the absence of Cyp3a11 mRNA expression in mouse liver and intestine. Findings for midazolam and triazolam metabolic activities in liver microsomes were comparable between Cyp3a KO chimeric mice and PXB-mice. In contrast, these activities in the intestine of Cyp3a KO chimeric mice were attenuated compared with PXB-mice. Owing to the knockout of murine Cyp3a, hepatic Cyp2b10 and 2c55 mRNA levels in Cyp3a KO/uPA/SCID mice (without hepatocyte transplants) were 8.4- and 61-fold upregulated compared with PXB-mice, respectively. However, human hepatocyte transplantation successfully restored Cyp2b10 level nearly fully and Cyp2c55 level partly (still 13-fold upregulated) compared with those in PXB-mice. Intestinal Cyp2b10 and 2c55 were also repressed by human hepatocyte transplantation in Cyp3a KO chimeric mice.", 
    "216": "The authors aimed to determine the effectiveness of infrared thermal imaging (IRTI) as a novel, noninvasive technique in adjunctive diagnostic screening for lower limb deep venous thrombosis (DVT).", 
    "217": "The authors used an infrared thermal imaging sensor to examine the lower limbs of 64 DVT patients and 64 healthy volunteers. The DVT patients had been definitively diagnosed with either Doppler vascular compression ultrasonography or angiography. The mean area temperature (T_area) and mean linear temperature (T_line) in the region of interest were determined with infrared thermal imaging. Images were evaluated with qualitative pseudocolor analysis to verify specific color-temperature responses and with quantitative temperature analysis. Differences in T_area and T_line between the DVT limb and the nonaffected limb in each DVT patient and temperature differences (TDs) in T_area (TDarea) and T_line (TDline) between DVT patients and non-DVT volunteers were compared.", 
    "218": "Qualitative pseudocolor analysis revealed visible asymmetry between the DVT side and non-DVT side in the presentation and distribution characteristics (PDCs) of infrared thermal images. The DVT limbs had areas of abnormally high temperature, indicating the presence of DVT. Of the 64 confirmed DVT patients, 62 (96.88%) were positive by IRTI detection. Among these 62 IRTI-positive cases, 53 (82.81%) showed PDCs that agreed with the DVT regions detected by Doppler vascular compression ultrasonography or angiography. In nine patients (14.06%), IRTI PDCs did not definitively agree with the DVT regions established with other testing methods, but still correctly indicated the DVT-affected limb. There was a highly significant difference between DVT and non-DVT sides in DVT patients (P < 0.01). The TDarea and TDline in non-DVT volunteers ranged from 0.19 \u00b1 0.15\u2009\u00b0C to 0.21\u2009\u00b0C \u00b1 0.17\u2009\u00b0C; those in DVT patients ranged from 0.86\u2009\u00b0C \u00b1 0.71\u2009\u00b0C to 1.03\u2009\u00b0C \u00b1 0.79\u2009\u00b0C (P < 0.01).", 
    "219": "Infrared thermal imaging can be effectively used in DVT detection and adjunctive diagnostic screening because of its specific infrared PDCs and TDs values."
