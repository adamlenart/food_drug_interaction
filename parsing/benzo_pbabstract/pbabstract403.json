    "0": "To evaluate the functional role of endogenous acetylcholine (ACh) in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses, the influence of cholinergic hypofunction on it was investigated. Administration of a cholinergic neurotoxin, ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A; 5 nmol, i.c.v.), to guinea pigs one week prior to preparing slices resulted in a significant decrease in the magnitude of LTP, associated with a significant decrease in cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and the number of ChAT immunoreactive cells in the hippocampal slices. Bath-application of a cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine at 0.1 microM and 10 microM, attenuated and augmented, respectively, the magnitude of LTP in slices prepared from vehicle-treated animals (naive slices), whereas that in slices prepared from AF64A-treated animals (lesioned slices) was not significantly affected by physostigmine at any concentration tested. The induction of LTP in naive slices was inhibited or facilitated by a muscarinic M1 antagonist pirenzepine (1 microM) and by an M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 (1 microM) alone, respectively, whereas that in lesioned slices was not significantly changed by either of them. Furthermore, bath-applied carbachol (CCh) at 0.01-10 microM augmented the magnitude of LTP in lesioned slices, whereas the induction of LTP in naive slices was inhibited and facilitated by CCh at 0.01-0.1 microM and 1-10 microM, respectively, as reported previously. Such an augmentation of LTP by CCh was reversed by pirenzepine, but not by AF-DX 116. These observations suggest that AF64A induces the defect in ACh release and the hypofunction of M2 receptors, but not of M1, at least during the induction of LTP at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "A reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method has been used to determine flunitrazepam in plasma. Extraction was simple and there was no need to hydrolyse the drug. Separation was achieved on a 150 x 3.9 mm i.d. column packed with 4-microns Nova Pack C18 using a mobile phase of water-acetonitrile-triethylamine (700:300:4, v/v/v) (adjusted to pH 7.5 with orthophosphoric acid). The method was shown to be rapid and reliable with a lower limit of detection of 5 ng ml-1. Results are reported of simple experiments on the effects of temperature and light on the stability of flunitrazepam in plasma kept on the laboratory bench.",

Possibilities of preventive measures against murder in hospital are discussed.", 
    "3": "Five chromatographic and six immunoassay techniques were compared using data reported by 131 participants in the UK National External Quality Assessment Scheme for Drugs of Abuse in Urine. Twenty five samples were studied containing none or one of three concentrations of amphetamine, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, benzoylecgonine, methadone and morphine. Technique sensitivity and specificity achieved with realistic clinical samples of 25 mL vol were assessed as the percentage of true positive and true negative tests, respectively. Thin-layer chromatography was inadequate for the detection of several analytes, the sensitivity for 0.5 mg/L of benzoylecgonine being < 30%, and for 1.5 mg/L of amphetamine < 86%. Gas chromatography with mass spectrometry was significantly less sensitive than other techniques for the detection of 0.5 mg/L of benzoylecgonine (71%) and 1.5 mg/L of morphine (88%). High-performance liquid chromatography was the most sensitive for amphetamine. Immunoassays performed well when operating above their specified cut-off concentrations but, because they are directed to quinalbarbitone showed reduced cross-reactivity with amylobarbitone, the barbiturate more commonly prescribed in the UK.", 
    "4": "Data on naturally occurring panic attacks were gathered through continuous self-monitoring for 94 patients suffering from panic disorder with agoraphobia. A total of 1276 panic attacks were collected. In this article various aspects of panic attacks, including severity, duration and time of onset and situations in which panic occurs are addressed. In addition, the symptoms of panic were investigated, examining the (in)variability of attacks within each patient and the patterning of symptoms in the entire group of patients. The most important findings were as follows: attacks occurred predominantly in nonphobic situations; nocturnal panic attacks were generally more severe than attacks during the day; symptom patterns across various attacks, stemming from the same patient, were rather variable; and finally, a substantial number of the attacks (40%) did not meet the DSM-III-R criteria for number of symptoms.", 
    "5": "In a parallel-group, placebo-controlled, polysomnographic study with randomization, the possible occurrence of rebound insomnia was evaluated in 24 patients suffering from moderate to severe chronic insomnia and receiving either triazolam 0.5 mg, zolpidem 10 mg, or placebo. Treatment duration was 27 nights, followed by three placebo-controlled withdrawal nights. Both drugs showed significant efficacy compared to placebo during the active treatment period. A trend toward tolerance was noted in the triazolam group but not in the zolpidem one. The increase in total sleep time in the zolpidem group was accompanied by an increase in the number of sleep cycles. When active treatment was discontinued, clear rebound insomnia was present in the triazolam group while it was not possible to observe any rebound in the placebo and zolpidem groups. Subjective feelings of the patients, which were assessed by means of visual analog scales, correlated well with polysomnographic data. Our findings tend to indicate that, even after long-term treatment, zolpidem does not induce rebound insomnia or daytime anxiety.", 
    "6": "Akathisia can be a quite common and very troubling side effect of psychotropic treatment. Clinicians have become steadily more aware of this disorder, owing to original descriptions of restless movement disorder dating back to the first half of this century. Delineation of acute akathisia from other movement disorders, such as tardive dyskinesia, is crucial for providing patients with the best interventions. The pathophysiology of akathisia is not completely understood, but likely arises from complex interactions in subcortical and possibly spinal dopamine/norepinephrine systems. There are now valid and reliable methods to assess akathisia using standardized scales; doing so helps track the progress of treatment interventions. The secondary complications of akathisia are numerous. The most notable ones are non-compliance and assaultive or suicidal ideation or behavior. Iron status may play a pivotal role in the pathophysiology and development of acute akathisia due to the possible interaction of iron with the D2 receptor, but practical clinical significance of this is not yet clear. Causative agents of akathisia include all currently available neuroleptics, various other psychoactive medications, and occasional other non-psychotropics. Treatment first should include stopping the offending agent (if possible), lowering the dose, or changing to a lower potency neuroleptic. If these are not feasible, then there are a host of medications which are variably effective. The most common are beta-blockers, anticholinergics, clonidine, or benzodiazepines. Less commonly prescribed agents such as opiates, amantadine, buspirone, piracetam, amitriptyline, and dopamine depleters can be tried in more treatment-refractory patients. An overall treatment algorithm incorporating knowledge to date is presented at the end of this review.", 
    "7": "The ED50 for abolition of generalized seizures and reduction of afterdischarges to 20% of the control duration was determined in kindled rats for phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, clonazepam, and diazepam, both at a stimulation intensity of 200 microA and at 10 microA above the threshold for generalized seizures (threshold stimulation). Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and valproic acid acted in a stimulus-dependent manner, i.e. the ED50 was higher at 200 microA than at threshold stimulation. Phenytoin had the same ED50 irrespective of the stimulus intensity. Generalized seizures and afterdischarges were suppressed by the same doses of the drugs mentioned. The benzodiazepines, clonazepam and diazepam, had a differential effect: they suppressed generalized seizures at low doses, whereas afterdischarges were only suppressed incompletely at relatively high doses. The ED50 of both benzodiazepines was independent of stimulus intensity. In order to avoid erroneous conclusions a standardization of kindling parameters, especially stimulation intensity, is proposed when drug effects are to be compared.", 
    "8": "The cellular localization of binding sites for the gastrointestinal peptides [3H]cholecystokinin and [125I]bombesin as well as the cholecystokininB-antagonist [3H]L-365,260 was investigated in explant cultures of rat cortex, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord using autoradiographic techniques. Many neurons in cortical, brainstem and spinal cord cultures revealed intense labelling of the radioligands whereas cerebellar neurons showed only little binding. In addition to neurons, binding sites for these peptides were also observed on astrocytes. Labelling of glial cells in cerebellar cultures was usually weaker than in the other CNS areas studied, suggesting a certain specialization of astrocytes in various brain regions. By means of combined immunohistochemical and autoradiographic techniques it was demonstrated that many neurons and astrocytes which expressed binding sites for [3H]cholecystokinin, [3H]L-365,260 and [125I]bombesin were also immunostained by the monoclonal muscarinic receptor antibody M 35 providing evidence for a co-localization of peptidergic and cholinergic receptors on the membrane of these cells. Our autoradiographic findings suggesting the presence of receptors for cholecystokinin and bombesin on astrocytes are supported by electrophysiological studies demonstrating that both peptides induce a hyperpolarization of glial cells.", 
    "9": "Electrophysiological recordings from neurons of rat frontal neocortical slices have been used to investigate the action of the beta-carboline methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta- carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), on responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and on the excitability of the neurons. Iontophoretic application of GABA close to the intracellularly recorded cells (resting membrane potential -74 +/- 0.9 mV) elicited a depolarization associated with a decrease of input resistance, mediated by GABAA receptors. Bath application of DMCM (0.1-1 microM) reduced these GABA responses decreasing the affinity of the receptors for GABA. This effect was blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) antagonist ZK 93426 (1 microM). DMCM (0.1 microM) also decreased the hyperpolarization that followed a train of action potentials (AHP), mediated by Ca(2+)-dependent K+ conductance, and increased the duration of Ca(2+)-dependent action potentials recorded after blockade of Na+ and K+ conductances. Neither effect was blocked by BZR antagonists. These results indicate that DMCM increases the excitability of neurons not only by reducing the gain of the GABAA/BZR complex, but also by modulating intrinsic membrane mechanisms.", 
    "10": "The relationship between anticonvulsant tolerance to clonazepam and benzodiazepine receptor changes was studied in amygdala kindled rats. Fully kindled rats were given 1 mg/kg clonazepam (clonazepam treated) or vehicle (kindled control) orally three times per day for 4 weeks. During chronic treatment, amygdala stimulation was given twice per week, 30 min after a single protective dose of clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected to both groups of rats. As measured by seizure stage, clonazepam treated rats showed a greater degree of tolerance than kindled control rats; contingent tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of clonazepam developed in kindled control rats, while clonazepam treated rats shows contingent plus pharmacologic tolerance. There were no significant differences between clonazepam treated and kindled control rats in \"peak\" plasma clonazepam concentrations 40 min after clonazepam injections. Benzodiazepine receptor assays showed no significant difference in maximal binding capacity (Bmax), dissociation constant (Kd) or gamma-aminobutyric acid (100 microM) enhancement of benzodiazepine receptor binding between clonazepam treated and kindled control rats. These data suggest that pharmacologic tolerance to anticonvulsant action of clonazepam is not related to either plasma clonazepam concentrations or benzodiazepine receptor changes.", 
    "11": "Laboratory rats exhibit innate behavioural and corticosterone responses when exposed to cat odour. However, not all are responsive and differences in benzodiazepine receptor binding between responders and non-responders were explored. Rats were exposed to cat odour for 5 min and based on time spent sheltering were divided into responders (n = 21; mean +/- SEM = 244 +/- 8.2 sec) or non-responders (n = 20; 43.9 +/- 4.8 sec). Four days later, both groups were randomly allocated among 3 experimental conditions: home-cage, neutral or cat odour, and killed 30 min after exposure. [3H]flunitrazepam binding was performed at two ligand concentrations (2 and 10 nM); where significant differences in single point binding were found, Scatchard analysis was performed on pooled samples. In hippocampus and frontal cortex responders had significantly lower binding than non-responders. In hippocampus this was most apparent when the rats were exposed to the novel test situation, i.e. neutral odour and was due to a reduction in affinity (Kd = 0.4 and 1.2 nM non-responders and responders). In frontal cortex, differences were significant only following exposure to cat odour (Bmax = 2663 and 1501 fmol/mg protein in non-responders and responders). The changes in amygdala were not significant.", 
    "12": "The role of the muscarinic cholinergic system in the generation of LTP in the medial perforant path-dentate granule cell synapses in vivo was investigated using anesthetized rats. Cholinergic denervation with AF64A, a cholinergic toxin, did not significantly affect LTP induced by a strong tetanus (100 pulses at 100 Hz), but attenuated the LTP induced by a weak tetanus (30 pulses at 60 Hz). The i.c.v. injection of scopolamine (1.5-50 nmol) did not significantly affect the LTP induced by the strong tetanus but attenuated the magnitude of LTP produced by the weak tetanus in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that the cholinergic system is not essential for induction of LTP by strong stimuli but plays a role in facilitating the generation of LTP by weak stimuli. Furthermore, the induction of LTP by a weak tetanus was blocked by pirenzepine but affected by neither AF-DX116 nor 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine. The LTP-facilitatory action of the cholinergic system is probably mediated by muscarinic M1 receptors.", 
    "13": "Biochemical, molecular, and electrophysiological studies suggest that phosphorylation of beta subunits of the GABAA receptor (GaR) by exogenous protein kinase A inactivates the receptor channels. We have developed a method which for the first time allows the study of GaR phosphorylation in brain tissues by endogenous PKA. Desalted homogenates or crude synaptic membranes from mouse cerebral cortex were incubated with [gamma-32P]ATP and 8-Br-cAMP or chlorophenylthio-cAMP. Extracts from these incubations were immunoprecipitated by polyclonal antibodies against native GaR and analyzed by SDS-gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. In both homogenates and membranes, cAMP-dependent incorporation of 32P was observed for a 57-kDa peptide, and to a lesser extent 51- to 53-kDa peptides. Phosphorylation of affinity-purified GaR by the catalytic subunit of PKA also produced a major 57-kDa phosphopeptide and a minor 51-kDa phosphopeptide. Limited digestion by S. aureus V-8 protease of the 57-kDa phosphopeptide from the desalted homogenates or from purified receptors produced a major 32P-labeled fragment of 11 kDa, suggesting that the phosphorylation site is similar to that shown previously to reduce GaR function. The phosphorylation of GaRs in homogenates was time dependent and blocked by H-89 or protein kinase inhibitor 5-24, specific inhibitors of protein kinase A. Prolonged incubations resulted in dephosphorylation of the 57-kDa phosphoprotein by a microcystin-LR sensitive phosphatase. In cortical homogenates the level of cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the 57-kDa GaR peptide was more than 5 times that obtained with washed synaptic membranes. However, assays of PKA using the heptamer kemptide as substrate showed that the specific activity in the particulate fraction was 57% that of the homogenate. This suggests that GaRs on synaptic membranes are preferentially phosphorylated by a cytoplasmic form of protein kinase A. By comparing the [3H]flunitrazepam-photolabeled 53-kDa GaR subunit with the 51-57 kDa [32P]peptides from cortical homogenates, the molar ratio of [32P]/[3H] was estimated at 0.43, suggesting that a substantial fraction of the GaR pool is phosphorylated under these conditions.", 
    "14": "Accumulating evidence suggests that immediate-early gene transcription factors such as c-Fos, form part of an intracellular signalling pathway linking the activation of neuronal receptors by neurotransmitters to changes in neuronal gene expression. Recently it has been demonstrated that the centrally active muscarinic receptor agonist pilocarpine induces both c-fos mRNA and protein in rat brain. In this report using immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization techniques we demonstrate for the first time that in addition to c-fos, pilocarpine administration increases the neuronal expression of jun-B, krox-20 and krox-24 (zif-268) but not related c-jun and jun-D genes in rat cortex and hippocampus. Pretreatment of animals with atropine or pirenzepine significantly reduced induction of c-fos, jun-B, krox-20 and krox-24 genes in both hippocampus and cortex. These results show that activation of pirenzepine-sensitive muscarinic receptors results in a specific pattern of immediate-early gene expression in rat brain neurons. We suggest that the combinatorial complexity of immediate-early gene induction may allow receptor-specific control of gene expression in vivo.", 
    "15": "Chronic GABA exposure of mammalian primary cultured cortical neurons results in a downregulation of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. In the present study, the mRNA levels, as well as polypeptide expression, for the GABAA receptor alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits in cultured embryonic mouse cerebral cortical neurons (7 day old) were examined using northern analysis and immunoblotting techniques following chronic GABA treatment. The alpha 1 subunit mRNA or polypeptide could not be detected in these neurons. The steady state levels of mRNA for the GABAA receptor alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits showed a decrease in comparison with untreated neurons. There was no change in the level of the beta actin or poly(A)+ RNA under the same experimental conditions. This agonist-induced reduction in the GABAA receptor alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunit mRNA was blocked by the concomitant exposure of neurons to R 5135, an antagonist of GABAA receptor. The polypeptide expression for the GABAA receptor alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits in chronically GABA-treated neurons also showed a decline and this change was also blocked by the concomitant exposure of cells to GABA and R 5135. These results indicate that the chronic exposure of the GABAA receptor complex to agonist downregulates the expression of the alpha subunits of the receptor complex, which may be related to an observed decreases in the number of binding sites and GABA-induced 36Cl-influx in the cortical neurons.", 
    "16": "The distribution of the mRNAs encoding the gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunits of the GABAA receptor in the rat brain has been revealed by in situ hybridization, northern blot and dot blot analysis using specific antisense oligonucleotides. In addition, the quantitative distribution of the gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunit peptides participating in the fully assembled GABAA receptors/benzodiazepine receptors has been mapped by immunoprecipitation with specific anti-gamma 2S and anti-gamma 2L antibodies. Several neuronal types and brain regions are enriched in gamma 2L such as neurons of the layer II of striate cortex and cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as the inferior colliculus, superior colliculus, deep cerebellar nuclei, medulla and pons. Other neuronal types and regions are enriched in gamma 2S such as the mitral cells of the olfactory bulb, pyramidal neurons of the pyriform cortex, layer VI of the neocortex, granule cells of the dentate gyrus and pyramidal cells of the hippocampus. Other cortical areas and cerebellar granule cells express both gamma 2S and gamma 2L in comparable amounts. There is a good correlation between the relative expression of gamma 2S and gamma 2L mRNAs and the relative presence of these protein subunits in fully assembled and mature receptors in the studied brain regions. The differential distribution of gamma 2S and gamma 2L might result in differential ethanol sensitivity of the neurons expressing these GABAA receptor subunits.", 
    "17": "A solid-phase extraction and GC-MS confirmation method was developed for certain urinary diazolo- and triazolobenzodiazepines, including the metabolites of lorazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam, and triazolam. The latter two do not form benzophenones, and the others are not readily confirmed by conventional thin-layer chromatography or GC-MS techniques. Samples were hydrolyzed with glucuronidase at 37 degrees C, adjusted to pH 4.5, extracted with Bond Elut Certify columns, dried, and derivatized using BSTFA with 1% TMCS. Sample preparation time averaged 4 hours. A GC-MS selected-ion-monitoring acquisition method targeting retention time, molecular ion abundances, and qualifier ion ratios was used to determine positive results. The recovery of 7-NH2-clonazepam was 95%, and recoveries of alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, and lorazepam were greater than 66%. Linearity was demonstrated from 0.1 to 1.0 microgram/mL for each drug. Within-run CVs were less than 11%, and between-run CVs were less than 16%. Using this technique, we have been able to confirm suspected cases of abuse that had not been confirmed by previous techniques.", 
    "18": "We describe the first case series (n = 6) of using chlordiazepoxide to accomplish a rapid, well-tolerated withdrawal from alprazolam. After abruptly discontinuing alprazolam, we substituted a 50-mg dose of chlordiazepoxide for each 1 mg of alprazolam (except for one elderly patient where we substituted 25 mg) and gave additional chlordiazepoxide doses (25-50 mg every 4-6 hours) as needed for the first 1-2 days of hospitalization. With this approach, the mean \"substitution ratio\" of chlordiazepoxide to alprazolam was 86 to 1. We then tapered chlordiazepoxide by an average of 10% each day over a 7- to 14-day period according to the symptoms manifested and tolerated by individual patients. No seizures or other serious side effects occurred. Incomplete cross-dependence, as described elsewhere in the literature, was not observed. The rapidity and familiarity of the method are advantages for inpatient units, but careful titration of dosage, diagnostic clarity, and extended follow-ups are necessary when applying this approach.", 
    "19": "An ultrafiltration system was evaluated for the free-fraction measurement of SPECT radiotracers (beta-CIT, IBF, and iomazenil) used in functional brain imaging. The effect of temperature, storage, centrifugal force, tracer concentration, and percentage filtered demonstrated a relative error of < 9%. As a result of the minimal temperature effect, 25 degrees C was employed for all measurements. A comparison of the ultrafiltration system with equilibrium dialysis revealed < 5% difference for beta-CIT and iomazenil, but 16% for IBF. Additionally, the time and ease of operation considerably favored the ultrafiltration system. The precision quantitated by repetition was < 6% for between-run and within-run variability. In conclusion, ultrafiltration provided rapid results, demonstrated minor analytical errors, revealed generally good correlation with equilibrium dialysis, and allowed excellent precision.", 
    "20": "The objective of this study was to examine the use of rapidly diffusing (flow-limited) indicators for estimating the pulmonary capillary blood volume (i.e., fraction of the lung blood volume wherein the diffusible indicators equilibrate with the tissue) and the capillary transit time distribution. Supporting theory and an application to experimental data are presented. The theory leads to the following equations, which relate the mean transit time (t), the variance (sigma 2), and the third central moment (m3) of the capillary transport function, hc(t), to the moments of the venous concentration-time curves for a vascular reference indicator, CR(t), and a flow-limited diffusible indicator, CD(t), after a bolus injection of the indicators upstream from an organ: sigma 2D - sigma 2R = ([1 + (te/tc)]2-1)sigma 2c and m3D-m3R = ([1 + (te/tc)]3-1)m3c, where te = tD - tR and tc is capillary t. The moments of hc(t) can be estimated if the injected bolus includes, along with the vascular reference indicator, at least two flow-limited diffusible indicators, each with a different te. A least-squares optimization procedure can then be used to specify the moments of hc(t). This approach was applied to isolated dog lung lobes with [14C]-diazepam as the diffusible indicator. The tissue-to-perfusate partition coefficient for [14C]diazepam could be adjusted to any desired value by altering the perfusate albumin concentration. Thus, by making a number of injections, each at a different perfusate albumin concentration, data were obtained in a manner equivalent to making one injection with a number of flow-limited diffusible indicators, each with a different te. On average, the estimated capillary volume and mean transit time were approximately 48% of the total lobar volume and mean transit time, and the relative dispersion of the hc(t) was approximately 75%.", 
    "21": "Treatment of mice with the benzodiazepine derivative Ro11-3128 1-2 days post-infection with Schistosoma mansoni leads to arrest of virtually all schistosomula at the skin stage, and results in the development of protective immunity to challenge infection. A characteristic feature of Ro11-3128 treatment in vitro is the formation of exudates and membranous blebs at the schistosomular surface; other drugs tested, such as Ro15-5458 and oxamniquine which are also effective against the skin stages but relatively ineffective in inducing protection, do not induce this reaction. Here, we have examined whether such in vitro treatment causes enhanced presentation of schistosomular antigens by host antigen-presenting cells (APC) using an in vitro assay with activated peritoneal adherent cells as APC and T cells from S. mansoni antigen-sensitized mice. We have shown that viable mechanically transformed schistosomula (MS) can be processed and presented with similar kinetics to soluble antigen. However, in vitro drug treatment leads to enhanced presentation of MS. Experiments in which membranous blebs and antigen released by Ro11-3128-treated parasites during in vitro culture were separated from the remaining intact schistosomula, demonstrated significant stimulatory activity in the soluble and particulate-released antigen fractions. Filtration, antigen transfer experiments and SDS-PAGE analysis of the released material further suggested that most of the activity resided in the particulate fraction. Thus, quantitative and qualitative changes to antigen presentation by Ro11-3128 treatment early after infection may underlie the immunoprotective efficacy of Ro11-3128-abbreviated infections.", 
    "22": "Adult rats with two-thirds of the liver removed were administered diets supplemented with benzodiazepine drugs over a period of 10 days and the mass of organ regenerated or the liver increment ascertained. For a number of the drugs, liver regeneration was stimulated; the effect was more consistent and reproducible in the adult female. On the basis of the lower sensitivity of the male, such animals provided an approach toward rating the hepatotrophic efficacy of the agents and in relation to structure. According to the current classification, hepatotrophic activity was higher with lorazepam, loprazolam, oxazepam and chlordiazepoxide; intermediate with nitrazepam, temazepam, quazepam, halazepam and triazepam and lower with diazepam, clorazepate dipotassium, clobazam and alprazolam. More reproducible responses in terms of g wet and dry liver per 100 g body weight were obtained with sham-operated or intact males. The antagonist, flumazenil, fed at 0.080% was not effective as such nor modified the responses in admixture with several drugs in partially hepatectomized or intact males. In vivo hepatic microsomal changes in protein, cytochrome P-450 or the enzymes, aminopyrine demethylase and benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylase with the various series were not remarkable or sporadic. Among other factors, the liver incremental changes noted currently are dependent on the metabolic intermediate benzodiazepines of varying elimination half-lives which may be distinct from that of the parent drug coupled with the alterations induced by partial ablation of the organ in rats of either sex.", 
    "23": "Muscarinic receptors expressed by rat oligodendrocyte primary cultures were examined by measuring changes in second messengers following exposure to carbachol, an acetylcholine analog, and by polymerase chain reaction. Inositol phosphate levels were measured in [3H]myo-inositol-labelled young oligodendrocyte cultures following stimulation with carbachol. Atropine, a specific muscarinic antagonist, prevented the carbachol-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates. The formation of inositol trisphosphate was concentration- and time-dependent, with the peak at 100 microM carbachol and 10 min. Carbachol increased intracellular calcium levels, which were dependent both on the mobilization of intracellular stores and influx of extracellular calcium. In initial experiments with more selective antagonists, the mobilization of intracellular calcium was preferentially inhibited by pirenzepine, a selective M1 antagonist, but not methoctramine, a selective M2 antagonist, suggesting M1 muscarinic receptor involvement. A role for protein kinase C in the regulation of carbachol-stimulated inositol phosphate formation and intracellular calcium mobilization was demonstrated, as acute pretreatment with phorbol-12,13-myristate acetate abolished the formation of both second messengers. Pretreatment with 100 microM carbachol abolished the 40% increase in the cyclic AMP accumulation stimulated by isoproterenol, a specific beta-adrenergic agonist. In turn, the inhibition was alleviated by pretreatment with atropine, suggesting muscarinic receptor involvement. Polymerase chain reaction carried out with specific m1 and m2 muscarinic receptor oligonucleotide primers, confirmed that these cells express, at least, the two muscarinic receptor subtypes. Without excluding the expression of other subtypes, these results suggest that developing oligodendrocytes express m1 (M1) and m2 (M2) muscarinic receptors capable of mediating phosphoinositide hydrolysis, mobilization of intracellular calcium and the attenuation of beta-adrenergic stimulation of cyclic AMP formation.", 
    "24": "The goal of this study was to clarify pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors in cells of the mouse retinal ganglion cell layer in situ. Spontaneous synaptic currents and responses to exogenous GABA were recorded from individual neurons in retinal whole mounts (postnatal days 1-3) or retinal stripe preparations (postnatal days 4-6). Drugs were applied by a fast local superfusion system. Current responses were measured with the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration. All cells responded to exogenous GABA (average EC50 and Hill coefficient: 16.7 microM and 0.95 respectively) and generated GABAergic synaptic currents in response to elevated KCl. GABA-induced currents of retinal ganglion cells were blocked by bicuculline, picrotoxin and Zn2+, as well as strychnine, and increased by pentobarbital, clonazepam and 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one. In some retinal ganglion cells GABA caused an increase in the frequency of spontaneous synaptic currents, which points to a partially depolarizing action of this traditionally inhibitory neurotransmitter in the neural retina. Our major observation is that acetylcholine and acetylcarnitine blocked or reduced GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents and responses to exogenous GABA. This effect was seen in only a fraction of retinal ganglion cells and occurred in both the undesensitized and the desensitized state of the GABAA receptor. The block was voltage-independent and persisted during coapplication with the nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists D-tubocurarine and atropine. In contrast to GABA-activated Cl- currents, glycine-activated Cl- currents remained unaffected by acetylcholine and acetylcarnitine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Treatment using combinations of levodopa, opioids, benzodiazepines, and baclofen provided only partial benefit or resulted in intolerable adverse effects. Higher dosages of clonidine than previously reported in the literature (0.9 mg/d in divided doses) were needed to completely relieve his RLS symptoms. The only prominent adverse effect was dry mouth. The RLS symptoms returned after subsequent reductions in the dosage. After the dosage of clonidine was again increased, complete relief of the symptoms was achieved again.

    "33": "During May 1990-July 1991, health workers recruited 117 pregnant adolescents at two hospital-based perinatal clinics and two family practice residency clinics in Madison, Wisconsin, into a study designed to determine the prevalence of cigarette, alcohol, and other drug use among pregnant teenagers in a small US city. 68.4% of the teenagers were Caucasian. They underwent a urine drug screening for amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, LSD, and phencyclidine at the initial and third-trimester visits. The provider reviewed the medical record from the initial prenatal visit detailing the history of substance abuse. Based on the self-reports, 48.3% smoked cigarettes, 8.6% drank alcohol, and 7.7% used other drugs. 12.8% of the patients tested positive for at least one drug metabolite. These prevalences were similar to those of other inner city data. The medical provider report showed that 56.3% had used tobacco, 22.7% had used alcohol, and 11.4% had used other drugs. Medical providers detected 98.2% of the cigarette smokers, 60% of the alcohol users, and only 25% of the users of other drugs. During the third-trimester visit, 8 of 81 patients (9.9%) tested positive for marijuana (6) and cocaine (2). Of these 81 teenagers, 16 were positive for other drug use either at the first- or third-trimester visits. Three tested positive for other drug use during both visits. No significant difference in the percentage of cigarette smokers between positive and negative substance users existed. Risk factors for alcohol and other drug use included: neither parent at home (odds ratio [OR] = 3.47); father of the baby not close to the pregnant teenager (OR = 10.26); father of the baby had at least one consequence related to alcohol and other drug use (OR = 3.45); and pregnant teenager had at least one consequence related to alcohol and other drug use (OR = 8.19). These findings suggest that if clinicians are aware of these risk factors, identification and management of substance use among pregnant teenagers will improve.", 
    "34": "1. Nimodipine (30 mg three times daily) and diazepam (10 mg once daily), were given orally to 24 elderly healthy subjects in a randomized, non-blinded, threefold-crossover study. Each of the three treatment periods lasted 5 days separated by 2 week washout phases. 2. Plasma concentrations of nimodipine and diazepam were not affected by the combined treatment. 3. No clinically relevant changes in haemodynamics, ECG recordings, clinical chemistry or haematology were observed after all of the three treatments. The overall frequency of side effects was lowest during monotherapy with nimodipine and highest during diazepam monotherapy. 4. In the test of subjective rating of tiredness (VAS) and the Pauli calculation test, diazepam, alone and with nimodipine co-medication, produced an increase in tiredness and a clear reduction in performance and endurance. After nimodipine monotherapy an improvement was observed only in the Pauli test. Using the critical flicker fusion frequency test (CFF) significant decrements in performance were found after diazepam monotherapy only. 5. In summary, there was no evidence that either nimodipine or diazepam affected the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerance of each other. However, the CNS-effects of diazepam were compensated partially by nimodipine.",

The biotransformation of the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam (ALP) to its hydroxylated metabolites (4-OH-ALP and alpha-OH-ALP) was evaluated in human, monkey, rat, and mouse liver microsomes. 2. In all species 4-OH-ALP was the principal metabolite, accounting for 84% of clearance in human microsomes compared with 16% for alpha-OH-ALP. 3. Among the serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine (FLU) and sertraline (SERT), and their respective demethylated metabolites norfluoxetine (NOR) and desmethylsertraline (DES), NOR was the most potent inhibitor (mean Ki for 4-OH-ALP formation in humans: 11 microM), FLU the weakest (Ki = 83 microM), with SERT and DES falling in between (Ki = 24 and 20 microM). 4. The in vitro data predict 29% inhibition of ALP clearance at mean FLU and NOR plasma concentrations of 77 ng ml-1 and 72 ng ml-1, respectively, after correction for liver:water partition ratios in the range of 12-14. The observed mean degree of inhibition in a previous in vivo study was 21%. 5. Ketoconazole was a potent inhibitor of ALP metabolism in vitro (Ki = 0.046 microM), suggesting that ALP hydroxylation is mediated by the cytochrome P450-3A sub-family.

In conscious dogs, 45 min intravenous infusion of synthetic human CCK-33 (100 pmol/Kg/hr) caused an integrated CCK response over 90 min of 675 +/- 51 pmol-90 min/L, and the plasma CCK levels declined promptly with a t1/2 of 2.2 +/- 0.3 min after cessation. Organ extraction of CCK-33 by the kidney, mesenteric organs, and liver was examined in anesthetized dogs. From the gradients of the plasma levels between afferent and efferent vessels for each organ after bolus injection of CCK-33 (50 pmol/Kg), renal extraction ratio was 0.30 +/- 0.04, and mesenteric extraction ratio was 0.19 +/- 0.04. Hepatic extraction was not detected. T1/2 and extraction ratios were not affected by the preinjection of L-364,718 (20 nmol/Kg). The results indicate in dogs that exogenously administered CCK-33 is degraded by the mesenteric organs as well as the kidney but not by the liver, and that receptor-mediated mechanisms are not involved in these degradation pathways of CCK.", 
    "44": "1. The last two decades have witnessed an upsurge in the interest in anxiety disorders. Much research effort has been dedicated to panic disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. However, it is only very recently that we have begun to understand some of the basic principles about the psychopharmacology of social phobia. 2. Drug classes sofar studied include beta-blockers, nonselective and irreversible MAO-inhibitors (MAOI's) and benzodiazepines. 3. Beta blockers appear to be of use in specific social phobias, like public speaking. There is considerable evidence suggesting that MAOI's are effective in reducing both social anxiety as well as social avoidance. A disadvantage of the conventional irreversible MAOI's is their risk for hypertensive crises when combined with dietary tyramine. So far only a small number of studies with selective MAOI-A inhibitors such as moclobemide and brofaromine have been conducted in social phobia, and the results indicate that both compounds are effective. 4. Drugs exerting selective and specific actions on certain compounds of e.g. the serotonergic system can now be studied and it is hoped that the role of 5-HT and other neuronal systems in social phobia can be elucidated. 5. In order to gain more information about selective serotonergic drugs the first double blind placebo controlled study with fluvoxamine in social phobia is here reported. Preliminary results indicate a reduction of social anxiety. 6. Finally the role of peptides in the treatment of social phobia is critically reviewed. The MSH/ACTH analog Org 2766 was investigated in patients suffering from social phobia. No anxiolytic effects of this peptide could be observed.",

As in the beginning we were not aware of her benzodiazepine dependency, she underwent withdrawal, so that the clinical picture became very complex and lengthy; it should be considered that long-term benzodiazepine use as well as withdrawal might have contributed to genesis, at least to manifestation of the depressive disorder. Apart from the self-contained depressive disorder and benzodiazepine dependency, obviously biographic-psychodynamic and family-dynamic factors have been important in formation, but as well in remittence of the complex clinical picture. An impressive urinary retention without detectable organic origin which persisted for several weeks is remarkable.", 
    "46": "The effects of d-amphetamine (0.32 to 5.6 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.10 to 5.6 mg/kg) on defecation were examined in two groups of rats. One group was exposed to a fixed-time 60-s (FT 60-s) schedule of food delivery and the other group was exposed to massed-food sessions. During vehicle control sessions, rats exposed to the FT 60-s schedule excreted a significantly higher number of fecal boli than rats exposed to massed-food sessions. d-Amphetamine, at doses above 0.56 mg/kg, significantly reduced defecation (boli produced) in both groups, although the magnitude of the drug's effect was larger in the group exposed to the FT 60-s schedule. For both groups, diazepam only produced a significant decrease in defecation at the highest dose (5.6 mg/kg).

    "47": "In a previous study, rats treated chronically with flurazepam were tolerant to the anticonvulsant action of some benzodiazepines (BZs), but not others (34). To determine if this differential crosstolerance was unique to flurazepam, rats were treated chronically with diazepam or midazolam, and tested for tolerance to the anticonvulsant actions of diazepam, midazolam, clonazepam, and clobazam. Regional benzodiazepine receptor binding in brain was also studied. In contrast to previous findings with flurazepam, 1 week treatment with diazepam or with midazolam did not cause tolerance. Rats treated with diazepam for 3 weeks were tolerant to diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam, and midazolam. In contrast, rats treated 3 weeks with midazolam were tolerant to diazepam and midazolam, but not clobazam or clonazepam. Neither diazepam nor midazolam treatment for 3 weeks altered BZ binding in cerebral cortex, cerebellum, or hippocampus. The effects of chronic BZ treatment depended not only on the BZ given chronically, but also on the BZ used to evaluate these effects, suggesting drug-specific interactions of different BZs with their receptors.", 
    "48": "The administration of 2,2',2''-tripyridine produced generalized tremor, myoclonus, and hindlimb abduction, similar to the \"5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) syndrome,\" in mice. Pretreatment with mianserin, cyproheptadine, methysergide, or metergoline ameliorated, whereas 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT), or 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino]tetraline hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) augmented the 2,2',2''-tripyridine-induced tremor. Furthermore, diazepam and flunitrazepam exhibited a dose-dependent protection against 2,2',2''-tripyridine-induced tremor in mice, but pentobarbital only had a slightly protective effect. The inhibitory effects of diazepam and flunitrazepam on the 2,2',2''-tripyridine-induced tremor were potentiated in mice pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). These observations suggest a serotonin-mediated action of 2,2',2''-tripyridine in its tremor action and that the benzodiazepine agonist attenuation of the 2,2',2''-tripyridine-induced tremor is probably mediated through the GABAergic inhibition of serotonergic neurons.", 
    "49": "The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two doses of intranasal midazolam on sedation of young children for dental treatment. Thirty uncooperative children, mean age of 32 months, who needed at least two restorative visits, participated in this study. The patients were assigned randomly to receive either 0.2 mg/kg or 0.3 mg/kg of midazolam intranasally, with the alternate regimen administered at the second appointment. All the children received 50% nitrous oxide, and were restrained in a Papoose Board (Olympic Medical Group, Seattle, WA) with a head holder. Degree of alertness, crying, and movement were evaluated at baseline and at 5-min intervals throughout the procedure. Evaluation of overall behavior at each session was performed by one investigator, blind to the dose, using a separate rating scale. The reliability of ratings was assessed by two investigators from videotapes of the procedures. Statistical analysis showed no differences (P > 0.05) in the behavior of the children receiving the two doses. Successful sedation, as assessed by lack of or minimal crying and/or movement that interrupted treatment, was observed in all the treatment visits with both doses (mean score 4.66 +/- 1.09 for 0.3 mg and 4.40 +/- 1.04 for 0.2 mg).

    "50": "Effect of pirenzepine on gastric mucosal blood flow (GMBF) in adult patients after coronary artery bypass grafting and mitral and aortic valve replacement was evaluated by using endoscopic laser-Doppler velocimetry. Heart rate, blood pressure and cardiac output increased temporarily after intravenous administration of pirenzepine 20 mg. GMBF also increased with these hemodynamic changes. However, GMBF remained significantly higher even after the decrease of cardiac output. Therefore, the increase in GMBF, which might be due in part to increase in cardiac output, could be explained by pirenzepine's own effect on gastric mucosa. Since the GMBF is one of the most important gastric mucosal defensive factors, pirenzepine may be useful in preventing acute gastric mucosal lesions in patients with low cardiac output.", 
    "51": "We evaluated gastric juice secretion during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) in cardiac surgery. The effect of pirenzepine, a muscarine receptor blocker, was also tested to clarify the mechanism involved. Gastric juice secretion increased significantly from pre ECC value of 3.8 +/- 1.3 ml.h-1 to 12.4 +/- 4.0 ml.h-1 during ECC. It decreased to 5.0 +/- 1.4 ml.h-1 (mean +/- SE) after ECC. Pirenzepine premedication reduced serum gastrin level. However, it did not suppress the increase of gastric juice secretion. There is no significant correlation between serum gastrin level and gastric juice secretion. ECC is a major stress and increases gastric juice secretion. This phenomenon is probably activated via sympathetic and hypophysis-adrenal gland system.",

Both methods were significantly more effective than placebo (n = 30). Six patients in the benzodiazepine/opiate group had oxygen desaturation, whereas none did in the nitrous oxide/oxygen group. Duration of stay after the procedure was significantly shorter in the gas inhalation group than in those receiving conventional intravenous sedation. Except for patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, nitrous oxide/oxygen inhalation is a safe and acceptable alternative method of sedation and analgesia during colonoscopy.", 
    "53": "These studies investigated behavioral and hormonal responses to stress in developing mice. Experiment 1 examined the effects of 24-hr maternal deprivation on corticosterone (CORT) secretion and ultrasonic vocalization (UVZ) rate in 4-, 8-, and 12-day-old mice. At these ages, exposure to a novel environment resulted in minimal changes in CORT secretion. Maternal deprivation increased pups' CORT secretion in an age-dependent fashion but did not affect their UVZ rate. The aim of experiment 2 was to test the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), an anxiolytic compound, on CORT secretion and UVZ in both normally reared and in maternally deprived 8-day-old mice. CDP administration elevated CORT secretion in a dose-dependent fashion, producing larger CORT increases in deprived (DEP) animals. CDP affected UVZ only in nondeprived (NDEP) animals: UVZ rate was decreased by high CDP doses. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the infant mouse shows a period of stress hyporesponsiveness similar to the rat and that maternal presence contributes to inhibit adrenocortical activity. CDP administration, but not novelty exposure, increased CORT secretion in 8-day-old normally reared mice suggesting that during the stress hyporesponsive period, the HPA axis is capable of responding only to specific stimuli. Changes in HPA axis activity and UVZ rate resulting from maternal deprivation and/or CDP challenge do not seem to be directly related.",

Data were collected during the night before surgery, after premedication and for 8 h post-operatively. The pulse oximeter (Nellcor N-200E) output was retrospectively evaluated using Satmaster, a computer programme which permits storage, retrieval, signal evaluation and compilation of oximetric data. There was no significant difference in the frequency, duration, or magnitude ofdesaturation episodes recorded during the post-premedication period compared to the desaturation episodes which occurred in the same child during normal sleep, on the night before surgery. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the desaturation data between the two premedicant regimens. No child recorded a genuine desaturation less than 80% for longer than 15 s at any time during the study. Neither regimen significantly depressed saturation in otherwise healthy children presenting for minor surgical procedures.",

To localise muscarinic receptors and their M1 and M2 subtypes in the human eye, in vitro ligand binding and autoradiographic techniques with densitometric quantitation on postmortem eye sections were used. As ligands, [3H] quinuclydinyl benzylate (QNB) (non-subtype specific muscarinic antagonist), [3H]pirenzipine (M1 antagonist), [3H]oxotremorine (M2 muscarinic agonist), [3H]AFDX-116(11[(2[diethylaminomethyl]1-piperidinyl)acetyl]5 , 11dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one) (M2 antagonist) were studied. Specific binding sites for QNB, pirenzipine, and AFDX-116 were localised in the entire ciliary muscle, the iris, and ciliary epithelium. [3H]oxotremorine localised only in the longitudinal portion of the ciliary muscle, and additionally, was not localised in the iris or ciliary epithelium. These results suggest that oxotremorine, by binding selectively to receptors on the longitudinal ciliary muscle and inducing its contraction, may modulate outflow facility independently from accommodation and miosis.",

    "62": "The functional affinities of some recently developed subtype-selective muscarinic antagonists towards bovine tracheal smooth muscle muscarinic M3 receptors were established and compared to binding affinities for bovine cardiac M2 and functional affinities for guinea-pig tracheal smooth muscle M3 receptors; functional affinities towards bovine or guinea-pig cardiac M2 receptors were determined when the M2/M3 selectivity in bovine tissues deviated from reported guinea-pig data. It was found that the M2-selective antagonist AQ-RA 741 showed similar high affinities in bovine and guinea-pig heart (8.27-8.41); the affinity in bovine trachea, however, was almost 10-fold higher than in guinea-pig trachea (7.51-6.63). The M3-selective antagonist DAC 5945 displayed functional affinities that were similarly high in bovine and guinea-pig trachea (8.16-8.24) and approximately a 100-fold lower in bovine and guinea-pig heart (6.15-6.36); with this compound, the binding affinity in bovine cardiac membranes (6.92) was clearly higher than the functional affinity, as has meanwhile also been reported for the guinea-pig. With the M3-selective muscarinic antagonists p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol and UH-AH 371, affinities towards bovine tracheal muscarinic M3 receptors were 0.3 log units higher than in guinea-pig trachea (7.36-7.09 and 8.43-8.13, respectively), and, in case of p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol, both were lower than previously reported for the guinea-pig ileum (typically 7.8). In some instances, especially AQ-RA 741 in bovine trachea and p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol in bovine and guinea-pig trachea, the M3 receptor affinities found here correlated better to the reported M1 than to the M3 receptor affinities. It is concluded that small, but occasionally clear species and tissue differences exist with regard to the affinities of muscarinic receptor antagonists for smooth muscle M3 receptors, and it is suggested that this may be due to small, but potentially important differences in their amino acid sequences.", 
    "63": "Bicucculine being introduced to rats has induced an increase of [14C]GABA capture with synaptosomes and simultaneous decrease of GABA and NAD level in the brain. The decrease of the inhibiting effect of GABA is accompanied by the increase of specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam with benzodiazepine receptors at the expense of the increase of binding capacity from 0.33 to 0.45 g/mol per 100 mg of protein. Under these conditions the dissociation constant remains unchanged. Such an activation of benzodiazepine receptors was observed under the lack of NAD in the organism (model of PP-hypovitaminosis). Introduction of the surplus doses of nicotinamide neutralizes the convulsant effect on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "64": "The effects of scopolamine (0.3, 0.6 mg IM) lorazepam (2 mg oral) and placebo on word valence ratings, priming and word recall were assessed in a double-blind independent group design with 36 subjects. Subjects given active drugs rated words as having more of an affective load than subjects given placebo. Priming, as assessed in a word-stem completion task, was not significantly affected by any treatment. Word recall showed some impairment following all active treatments. Performance on the stem completion task was unrelated to subjectively rated sedation but did not relate to word-valence ratings in different ways across drug treatments. Performance on the recall task was unrelated to valence ratings but did relate to the sedative effects on lorazepam. Implications are drawn out for pharmacological models of memory dysfunction.", 
    "65": "Unlike diazepam, lorazepam has repeatedly been shown to impair perceptual priming as well as explicit memory. To determine whether this deleterious effect was due to an impairment in acquisition of information, 60 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to five treatment groups (placebo, lorazepam 0.026 or 0.038 mg/kg, diazepam 0.2 or 0.3 mg/kg) and successively performed perceptual priming tasks and a free-recall task. Priming performance on information learned before or 2 h after drug administration, i.e. at the peak concentration of lorazepam, was assessed under the influence of the drugs, using a picture-fragment and a word-stem completion task. Free-recall performance was altered by both drugs. Lorazepam decreased priming performance when information was acquired after, but not before, drug administration, indicating that the drug alters the acquisition of information. Lorazepam also impaired the ability to identify fragmented pictures, but there was no evidence that this perceptual effect accounts for the priming impairment. Surprisingly, diazepam also decreased priming when information was acquired after drug administration, suggesting that, at least in certain circumstances, the two benzodiazepines may exert similar effects on priming measures.", 
    "66": "The effect of two dosages of sarmazenil (RO 15-3505) on sleep propensity and performance was investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled paradigm. The design included three 24-h testing periods, separated by at least one 7-day rest period, commencing after 24-h of sleep deprivation. Twelve normal, healthy, adult males (mean age 27 +/- 2.8 years) were paid to participate. During the experimental periods, they came to the sleep laboratory at 2100 hours and spent the night awake under close supervision. At 0700 hours, a schedule of 7 min \"attempting\" sleep in bed, 13 min awake outside the bedroom, began. This schedule was maintained for 24 h. Repeated administrations of 1 mg and 2 mg sarmazenil significantly reduced the 24-h levels of total sleep. This was particularly evident during the period 0700-2300 hours. Sarmazenil also significantly improved reaction time and tended to increase the number of correct responses in the \"categories search\" task. Sarmazenil tended to improve reaction time in the \"Stroop\" test but this was significant only for the \"easy\" version of the test during the night.", 
    "67": "The effects of a series of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands, ranging from a full agonist through to partial inverse agonists, were examined on short term working memory in the rat. The behavioural paradigm used was a discrete trial, operant delayed matching to position task, as originally described by Dunnett (1985), with delays of 0, 5, 15 and 30 s. The benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) full agonist lorazepam (0.25, 0.375 and 0.5 mg/kg) dose and delay dependently impaired matching accuracy. Lorazepam also increased the latency to respond and decreased the number of nose pokes made into the food tray during the delays. In contrast, the BZR partial agonist ZK 95,962 (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) did not affect matching accuracy, but did increase the speed of responding. The BZR antagonist ZK 93,426 (1.25, 5, 25 mg/kg) had no effects in this paradigm. The BZR weak partial inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) and ZK 90,886 (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg) did not affect accuracy of performance. However, both of these drugs increased the latency to respond and decreased nose poke responses. These motoric effects were particularly strong following 10 mg/kg Ro 15-4513. This shows that the effects of drugs on the accuracy of responding and on the speed of responding can be dissociated. The BZR partial inverse agonist FG 7142 had effects on matching accuracy that were dependent upon dose. The lowest dose of FG 7142 (1 mg/kg) significantly improved accuracy, whereas the highest dose (10 mg/kg) impaired accuracy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Animals were trained to consume ETOH (11% v/v) using a limited access procedure. Measurements were taken at 10- and 60-min intervals. Ro15-4513 (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) markedly attenuated ETOH consumption at both intervals. The antagonistic actions of Ro15-4513 were completely blocked by the higher dose of flumazenil at both intervals; the lower dose failed to antagonize the Ro15-4513-induced reduction of ETOH intake. When flumazenil was given alone, both doses reduced ETOH self-administration at 60 min; although the magnitude of the antagonism was comparable to that of Ro15-4513 only with the highest does of flumazenil (16.0 mg/kg). Neither Ro15-4513 nor flumazenil alone or in combination significantly altered water intake at any of the tested doses. Rats pretreated with Ro15-4513 showed a substantial reduction in blood ethanol concentration (BEC) compared with the Tween-80 vehicle condition at the 10-min interval. However, the BEC of animals given Ro15-4513 in combination with flumazenil were similar to rats given Tween-80 vehicle. The present study extends our previous research by demonstrating that Ro15-4513 and flumazenil attenuate ETOH self-administration in non-food or water deprived rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "The time course of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) inverse agonist RO19-4603 in antagonizing ethanol (EtOH) intake was investigated in alcohol-preferring (P) rats (n = 7) maintained on 24-h continuous free-choice access to EtOH (10% v/v), water, and food. After fluid intakes had stabilized over several weeks, animals were injected with Tween-80 vehicle solution or RO19-4603 (0.075, 0.150, and 0.30 mg/kg). EtOH and water intakes were determined at 8- and 24-h intervals. RO19-4603 caused a marked attenuation of EtOH drinking with each of the doses tested. EtOH intake during the 8-h following 0.075, 0.150, and 0.30 mg/kg RO19-4603 was decreased by approximately 36, 74, and 57%, respectively. Intakes during the 24-h interval were similar to the vehicle control condition. However, 32 h post-drug administration, EtOH intakes were reduced to approximately 27, 31, and 29% following the 0.075, 0.150 and 0.30 mg/kg doses, respectively. To further confirm the reliability of the RO19-4603 dose-response effect, and its selectivity for EtOH, the highest dose condition (0.30 mg/kg) was tested twice. The second 0.30 mg/kg dose condition exerted a profile of effects similar to the initial treatment; 8 h following administration, intake was decreased to 60% of the control level, and 32 h post-drug administration intake was decreased to approximately 46% of the controls. These decreases were evidently selective in comparison with water, since water drinking showed compensatory increases which paralleled the decreased EtOH consumption. Dose-response comparisons indicated that 0.150 mg/kg approaches the maximum effective dose, since the 0.30 mg/kg dose of RO19-4603 did not produce an additional decrease in EtOH intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "CL 284,846, N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1, 5-a]pyrimidin-7-yl)phenyl)]-N- ethylacetamide, is a novel non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic with benzodiazepine-like sedative effects, but with less apparent liability for accompanying undesired side effects. In an effort to further characterize its pharmacological activity, CL 284,846 (3.0 mg/kg, IP, 30 min pretreatment) was established as a discriminative stimulus (DS) in rats (n = 7). CL 284,846 (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) showed a dose-related increase in drug-appropriate responding up to the training dose and a dose-related decrease in response rate. The benzodiazepine agonist triazolam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), the benzodiazepine partial agonist Ro 17-1812 (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) and the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872 (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) substituted for CL 284,846 in all rats, whereas the imidazopyridines zolpidem (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) and alpidem (10.0-30.0 mg/kg), the benzodiazepine partial agonist bretazenil (0.03-10.0 mg/kg) and the novel putative anxiolytic CL 273,547 (10.0-56.0 mg/kg) substituted in most, but not all, rats. Ro 17-1812, bretazenil, and CL 218,872 had no effect on response rate while the other drugs showed a concomitant decrease in rate. The 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (1.0-10.0 mg/kg) and the barbiturate pentobarbital (3.0-17.0 mg/kg) failed to substitute for CL 284,846 up to rate-decreasing doses. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (3.0-10.0 mg/kg) blocked the DS effects of CL 284,846 in most rats with no effect on response rate. Taken together, these results suggest that the DS effects of CL 284,846 are mediated via benzodiazepine receptors; however, the DS profile of CL 284,846 remains distinct from both benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic drugs.", 
    "71": "The experiments have indicated that the first week of postresuscitation is marked by enhanced goal-investigating behaviour in the open field, by the accelerated learning of an operant reflex, and by decreased anxiety in the conflict situation test in male rats undergone a 10-min arrest of systemic circulation. There was a depressive behavior in the open field following 6-8 weeks with the normalization of operant reflex learning and the level of anxiety in the conflict test situation. Gidazepam (3 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a sedative effect in the first week after resuscitation, then 6-8 weeks later it displayed its anxiolytic and activating effect which is similar to this dose of the agent given to intact animals. The findings suggest that there are changes in the pattern of neurophysiological abnormalities, as well as a response of the benzodiazepine receptor complex to drugs during a resuscitative process, which may be one of the components of formation of a post-resuscitative central nervous abnormality.",

Enzyme activity was estimated before and after an oral dose of MPT (7.5 mg/kg-1) at various time intervals upto 120 hr. Antidote groups received atropine (10 mg/kg-1, i.p.), either alone or with diazepam (2.5 mg/kg-1, i.p.), at the onset of toxic signs. Inhibition of enzyme activity served as definite index of acute toxicity of MPT. RBC ChE activity correlated with the intensity of toxic signs in no-antidote rats, while in atropine treated groups, there was no correlation. BuChE levels did not correlate with toxic signs in any of the groups except in the fatal group. The resynthesis of both the enzymes was complete in 120 hr study and did not synchronize with the recovery pattern of animals from toxic signs. Compared to BuChE, RBC ChE activity was found to be a more sensitive indicator for the diagnosis of severity of MPT toxicity.",

Using this technique a population of albino rats can be divided into three groups: highly active (HA), low active (LA) animals, and rats with intermediate activity. HA animals exhibit stable behaviour in forced swimming and conflict situation paradigms. They are also more sensitive to a benzodiazepine anxiolytic phenazepam in conflict situation test. At the same time, LA rats decrease their activity and are less sensitive to phenazepam. Both groups (LA and HA) are not homogeneous: each of them includes animals demonstrating quite another type of behaviour compared with a majority of rats.",

Analysis of clinical studies and pharmacological tests with animals about body temperature changes caused by neuroleptics yields that these may lead to hypothermia as well as hyperthermia, depending on individual disposition and dose, which is mainly a result of their effect through dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, which controls thermoregulation, and of their influence on vasomotoric mechanisms of vessels of the skin. Though hyperthermic changes are more hazardous and occur more frequently hypothermia by neuroleptic agents is clinically relevant as shown by the summarizing presentation of previously released case reports: hypothermia is found at neuroleptic medicated healthy volunteers and at psychiatric patients with or without physical illness, at which hypothyreosis and impair of the brain seem to represent special risks.", 
    "88": "The effects of kindling and inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist beta-carbolines on animal models of anxiety are briefly reviewed in relation to affective disorder associated with chemical exposure. Recent experimental results are described. In the present study, cats were given the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist, FG-7142, a powerful anxiogenic compound in humans and animals. Neural transmission in pathways involved in defensive behavior in the cat was monitored using evoked potential techniques. Change in these pathways was related to behavioral changes induced by the drug. It was found that a single dose of FG-7142 lastingly increased defensive response to rodents for at least 40 days after drug administration. Behavioral change was specific to defensive response, since approach-attack behavior remained unchanged, replicating previous studies. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Flumazenil, reversed the increase in defensiveness in a drug-dependent manner, replicating previous findings. Increased defensiveness was paralleled by a delayed onset potentiation of neural transmission between the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus of the left hemisphere. Potentiation in the left hemisphere was transient, decaying between 6 and 12 days after the drug. There was a longer lasting potentiation (LTP) of activity evoked in the left and right amygdalo-periacqueductal gray pathways and in the right amygdalo-medial hypothalamic pathway. Potentiation in these pathways appeared at the time of behavioral change. Potentiation of the right amygdalo-periacqueductal gray and right amygdalo-medial hypothalamic pathways persisted until the end of the experiment. In contrast, potentiation of the left amygdalo-periacqueductal gray pathway faded by 40 days after the drug. Flumazenil decreased potentiation ony in the right amygdalo-periacqueductal gray pathway. These data strongly suggest that lasting affective change is mediated by lasting changes in particular efferents of the amygdala of the right hemisphere. Behavioral and physiological effects of FG-7142 were blocked by the N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, AP7. The data suggest that failure of neural inhibition induced by FG-7142 engages NMDA receptor processes to produce lasting potentiation of transmission in neural circuits that mediate defensive response with behavioral consequences. Since FG-7142 interferes with GABA mediated neural inhibition and is proconvulsant, its action might mimic the action of other environmental chemicals with similar properties, such as chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticides. The relationship of the present data to the literature on the neural and behavioral effects of insecticide exposure is discussed. The significance of these findings for multiple chemical sensitivity disorder is also briefly discussed.", 
    "89": "The main actions of benzodiazepines (hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, myorelaxant and amnesic) confer a therapeutic value in a wide range of conditions. Rational use requires consideration of the large differences in potency and elimination rates between different benzodiazepines, as well as the requirements of individual patients. As hypnotics, benzodiazepines are mainly indicated for transient or short term insomnia, for which prescriptions should if possible be limited to a few days, occasional or intermittent use, or courses not exceeding 2 weeks. Temazepam, loprazolam and lormetazepam, which have a medium duration of action are suitable. Diazepam is also effective in single or intermittent dosage. Potent, short-acting benzodiazepines such as triazolam appear to carry greater risks of adverse effects. As anxiolytics, benzodiazepines should generally be used in conjunction with other measures (psychological treatments, antidepressants, other drugs) although such measures have a slower onset of action. Indications for benzodiazepines include acute stress reactions, episodic anxiety, fluctuations in generalised anxiety, and as initial treatment for severe panic and agoraphobia. Diazepam is usually the drug of choice, given in single doses, very short (1 to 7 days) or short (2 to 4 weeks) courses, and only rarely for longer term treatment. Alprazolam has been widely used, particularly in the US, but is not recommended in the UK, especially for long term use. Benzodiazepines also have uses in epilepsy (diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam), anaesthesia (midazolam), some motor disorders and occasionally in acute psychoses. The major clinical advantages of benzodiazepines are high efficacy, rapid onset of action and low toxicity. Adverse effects include psychomotor impairment, especially in the elderly, and occasionally paradoxical excitement. With long term use, tolerance, dependence and withdrawal effects can become major disadvantages. Unwanted effects can largely be prevented by keeping dosages minimal and courses short (ideally 4 weeks maximum), and by careful patient selection. Long term prescription is occasionally required for certain patients.",

    "94": "We recently reported that inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) production by the NO synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-NG-nitro arginine (L-NOARG) antagonized the behavioral effects of a benzodiazepine (BZ) in a mouse paradigm for screening anxiolytic drug activity. Because other research has found that the anesthetic gas nitrous oxide (N2O) also produces BZ-like behavioral effects, the present research was conducted to ascertain whether NO might also be involved in N2O anxiolysis. Male Swiss-Webster mice were tested in an elevated plus-maze inside an inflatable glovebag. Exposure to N2O significantly increased exploratory activity on the open arms of the plus-maze, as measured by the number of entries into the open arms and the time spent on the open arms. Pretreatment with L-NOARG significantly reduced the N2O-induced elevation in open arm activity. This antagonism of the N2O effect was reversed by ICV treatment of L-NOARG-pretreated mice with L-arginine but not D-arginine. These findings indicate that NO possibly mediates behavioral effects of N2O in an animal model for anxiety.",

The effects of intravenous administration of two alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) antagonists were studied on responses of single neurones to iontophoretically applied excitatory amino acids. The tests were performed on spinal neurones in alpha-chloralose anaesthetized, spinalized rats. 2. Both the quinoxaline, NBQX (2-16 mg kg-1) and the 2,3-benzodiazepine, GYKI 53655 (2-8 mg kg-1) dose-dependently decreased responses to AMPA. 3. Both compounds were short acting, with half-recovery times of 15 min for NBQX and 7 min for GYKI 53655. 4. The selectivity for responses to AMPA over those to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) was significantly poorer for systemic NBQX than for either systemic GYKI 53655 or iontophoretic NBQX, suggesting that systemic NBQX may be converted to a less selective metabolite. 5. GYKI 53655 is therefore likely to be a more valuable tool than NBQX for the study of AMPA receptor-mediated processes in vivo.", 
    "96": "Diazepam (DZP) is commonly used in treatment of patients with acute ischemic syndromes to allay anxiety, but benzodiazepines reduce myocardial contractility and increase myocardial blood flow. To investigate the antiischemic effect of DZP, we studied 13 patients with a positive exercise test and angiographically documented coronary artery disease. All patients were submitted to a randomized, placebo-controlled trial using 0.9% NaCl infusion as placebo and intravenous (i.v.) diazepam (0.1 mg/kg in 20 min). Exercise tests performed immediately after the infusions showed that as compared with placebo, DZP significantly prolonged time to 1-mm ST-segment depression (557 +/- 198 vs. 428 +/- 226 s, p < 0.0001) and total exercise duration (624 +/- 177 vs. 561 +/- 188 s, p < 0.007). Rate-pressure product (RPP) at 1-mm ST-segment depression was not significantly different with the two treatments. DZP significantly delays onset of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. Because RPP at onset of ischemia was similar to that recorded with placebo despite greater levels of external workload, the antiischemic action of DZP appears to be mediated, at least partially, by a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption.", 
    "97": "Neuropathic pain is often a reason for an unfavourable response to morphine or other opioids in treating cancer pain. This type of pain is difficult to manage and may co-exist with nociceptive cancer pain. There is still a potential for opioid responsiveness, although the doses needed will be higher, and adjuvant drug therapies are best employed concurrently with opioid drugs. Adjuvant drugs used are the antidepressants, anticonvulsants, including benzodiazepines, corticosteroids and neurolepts. Less commonly, agents such as baclofen and clonidine, and sympatholytic drugs such as prazosin can be employed for sympathetically maintained neuropathic pain (discussed in Part 3). The type of agent selected will depend on the natural history of the disease process, as well as a description of the pain--the lancinating pains tending to respond better to anticonvulsants. Non invasive neurostimulatory approaches such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be useful in management, and a few patients may require an invasive procedure such as dorsal column stimulation.", 
    "98": "Previous studies have reported that diazepam (DZ) is capable of inducing mitotic-meiotic arrest and increasing the frequency of aneuploidy in mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo. We now report that DZ failed to induce either meiotic arrest or aneuploidy in mouse oocytes. In fact, doses of 0, 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg DZ administered at the same time as human chorionic gonadotropin did not induce the ovulation of metaphase I oocytes or of hyperploid metaphase II oocytes. A reduction in the number of ovulated oocytes was observed in the treated groups relative to controls, but this reduction was only significant (p < 0.01) at the highest dose. These findings indicate that different results are found among the assays used for detecting chemically induced aneuploidy. Determining the factors responsible for these differences is an important area for future research.",

Behavioral tests carried out at the age of 6, 12, and 18 months indicated higher emotionality and deviations of novelty reaction in D rats in comparison with controls, and these differences decreased with aging. However, no deficits were found in memory testing. D rats revealed some transitional alterations of monoamine neurotransmission in the hypothalamus (5-HT) and striatum (DA) and minor defects in reproductive functions (irregular estrous cycles in females). Significant depression of immune response in D rats persisting for the whole life may be considered as a serious risk of neonatal D treatment.", 
    "100": "The related rat cholecystokinin (CCK)-A and gastrin/CCK-B receptors can be selectively blocked by the antagonists L364718 and L365260, respectively. In order to determine receptor domains which are important in conferring specificity for L365260 and L364718 we constructed by overlap-PCR a rat gastrin/CCK-B receptor chimaera which contained the seventh transmembrane domain of the rat CCK-A receptor. Receptor binding assays on transiently transfected COS cells demonstrated a selective reduction in the affinity of the chimaeric receptor for L364718, so that the L365260 and L364718 affinities were of a similar order. Since the chimaera differs from the wild-type gastrin/CCK-B receptor by only six amino acids we conclude that one or more of these six amino acids contributes to L364718 binding and that the affinity determinants of L365260 and L364718 must, at least in part, be different. Furthermore, the affinity of the chimaera for gastrin is essentially the same as the gastrin/CCK-B receptor, indicating that the six different amino acids probably do not contribute to peptide agonist binding.",

    "102": "A cDNA encoding a functional gamma-aminobutyric (GABA)-activated Cl- channel has been isolated from an adult Drosophila head cDNA library. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the subunit functions efficiently, presumably as a homooligomeric complex and is activated by GABA or muscimol. GABA-evoked currents are highly sensitive to antagonism by picrotoxin but are insensitive to bicuculline, RU 5135, or zinc. Pentobarbitone greatly enhances GABA-evoked currents, whereas the neurosteroid 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one demonstrates a large reduction in both the potency and maximal effect when compared with its actions upon vertebrate GABA type A receptors. Although zinc-insensitive, the subunit is also insensitive to flunitrazepam. Hence, the GABA receptors formed by this subunit exhibit a unique pharmacology when compared with vertebrate GABA type A receptors or those composed of rho subunits. Because the receptor-channel complex functions as a homooligomer, this subunit may be of value in mutagenesis studies aiming to define drug-binding sites.",

    "110": "The effects of acetylcholine on isolated uterine artery rings of non-pregnant and pregnant guinea-pigs were investigated. Acetylcholine induced a concentration- and endothelium-dependent relaxation of both types of vessels, with similar pD2 (non-pregnant: pD2 = 7.66; pregnant: pD2 = 7.59) and maximal response values. The pKA values (non-pregnant vs. pregnant) of acetylcholine were 6.17 vs. 6.09. The occupancy response relationship was non-linear since the half-maximal response to acetylcholine (non-pregnant vs. pregnant) was obtained with 2.86 vs. 2.91% receptor occupancy. In quiescent preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonists, atropine, pirenzepine, N,N'-bis[6-[(2-methoxybenzyl)amino]hexyl]-1,8-octane-diamine tetrahydrochloride (methoctramine) and para-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pFHHSiD), produced parallel rightward shifts of the curves for acetylcholine and the slopes of the Schild plots were not significantly different from unity. The plots constrained to a slope of unity gave the following -log KB values (non-pregnant vs. pregnant): atropine (9.68 vs. 9.75), pirenzepine (6.75 vs. 6.53), methoctramine (6.13 vs. 6.23) and pFHHSiD (7.88 vs. 7.96). It is concluded that, in guinea-pig uterine arteries, acetylcholine induces endothelium-dependent relaxation and acts as a full agonist, regardless of pregnancy status. We suggest that the relaxation induced by acetylcholine, in either non-pregnant or pregnant guinea-pig uterine artery, is mediated via the M3 subtype of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "111": "One-day-old chicks were selected on their performance in imprinting behaviour and termed high-imprinted (H-I), partially imprinted (P-I) and low-imprinted (L-I) chicks. Then, H-I and L-I chicks were submitted to acute handling stress and [3H]flunitrazepam receptor-binding was performed on synaptosomal membranes from forebrain at various times after handling. The receptor number significantly increased in L-I but not in H-I chicks at 30 min after handling while the affinity remained unchanged at all times. In addition, when the three selected groups were maintained to reach 15 days of age and then they were submitted to acute swimming stress, the degree of receptor increase was also inversely related to the degree of imprinting performance. The receptor increase associated to swimming stress was higher in the left hemisphere, suggesting an interhemispheric asymmetry of stress effects. The results suggest that more-imprinted chicks are less susceptible than less-imprinted chicks to acute stress associated to central benzodiazepine receptor increase, probably due to differences in the degree of endogenous emotionality.", 
    "112": "Although benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications in the United States, considerable controversy surrounds their proper role in medical practice.", 
    "113": "Data from the household section of the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey were analyzed to estimate the prevalence and general characteristics of adults who purchased benzodiazepines in 1987.", 
    "114": "An estimated 6.2% (10.9 million) of the adult population purchased benzodiazepines in 1987. In nearly half (47.0%) of the purchases, the use of benzodiazepines perceived by the patient did not correspond to a labeled or literature-supported unlabeled use. Multivariate analysis disclosed that benzodiazepine use was predicted by sociodemographic factors (white race, female gender, age older than 64 years, and unemployed work status), pharmacologic factors (use of an antidepressant), mental health factors (high levels of anxiety), and general health factors (poor general health, cardiac disease, arteriosclerosis, health-related work impairment, and trouble walking one block).", 
    "115": "These data indicate that benzodiazepine use is less prevalent than previously reported and suggest that there has been a recent decline in use. A marked discrepancy exists between why people perceive they purchase benzodiazepines and the recognized uses of these medications."
