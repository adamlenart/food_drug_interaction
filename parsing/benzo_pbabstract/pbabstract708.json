    "0": "The effect of nitrazepam on ventilatory capacity and arterial blood gas tensions was studied in a double-blind controlled crossover trial in six patients with chronic obstructive bronchitis in ventilatory failure (raised Paco(2)). Nitrazepam produced a fall in ventilatory capacity and worsening of the ventilatory failure. In the sixth patient, while on the active drug, the Pao(2) fell from 48 to 35 mm Hg while the Paco(2) tension rose from 59.5 to 68 mm Hg. It is suggested that nitrazepam is contraindicated in patients with severe chronic obstructive bronchitis.", 
    "1": "A clinical study of 42 patients with essential tremor is presented. In the case of 12 patients the family history strongly suggested an autosomal dominant mode of transmission, in four the mode of inheritance was indeterminate, and the remaining 26 patients were sporadic cases without an established genetic basis. The tremor involved the upper extremities in 41 patients, the head in 25, lower limbs in 15, and trunk in two. Seven patients showed involvement of speech. Variations were found in the speed and regularity of the tremor. Leg involvement took a variety of forms: (1) direct involvement by tremor; (2) a painful limp associated with forearm tremor; (3) associated dyskinetic movements; (4) ataxia; (5) foot clubbing; and (6) evidence of peroneal muscular atrophy. Several minor symptoms-hyperhidrosis, cramps, dyskinetic movements, and ataxia-were associated with essential tremor. Other features were linked phenotypically to the ataxias and system degenerations. Apart from minor alterations in tone, expression, and arm swing, features of Parkinsonism were notably absent.", 
    "2": "Pomeroy tubal ligations were performed on 138 patients between 19-45 years old with an average parity of 4.8 in the early puerperium under local infiltration anesthesia with systemic sedation and analgesia. The optimum dose of diazepam was found to be 0.3 mg/kg. Sterilization was performed for socioeconomic reasons. Two minor anesthetic complications were observed, a thrombophlebitis and an urticarial reaction. Hospital discharge was comparable to that of multiparous women who do not undergo puerperal sterilization."
