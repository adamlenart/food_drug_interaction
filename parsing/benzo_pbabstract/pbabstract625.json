    "0": "A rapid method was developed for the determination of diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, and 3-hydroxydiazepam (temazepam) in human plasma using electron capture gas chromatography. Following a single extraction with benzene from 0.2 ml plasma, diazepam and its metabolites were quantitated on a SP-2250 column with medazepam as internal standard. The method has a sensitivity limit of 4 ng diazepam, oxazepam, and desmethyl-diazepam, and 15 ng 3-hydroxydiazepam per ml of plasma.", 
    "1": "Acid and pepsinogen secretion were studied in the isolated luminally perfused mouse stomach. Stimulation was obtained with bethanechol 10(-5)M. Pirenzepine blocked the effect of bethanechol in a dose dependent manner. The minimal blocking dose was 10(-5)M. Atropine 10(-6)M blocked secretion to a similar extent as pirenzepine 10(-5)M. Addition of tetrodotoxin did not change the response to bethanechol or to bethanechol together with pirenzepine. It is concluded that acid and pepsinogen secretion stimulated by bethanechol are inhibited by atropine and pirenzepine. There is at present no evidence that bethanechol stimulation or antimuscarinic inhibition act via intramural nerves.", 
    "2": "The cardiovascular effects of benzodiazepines administered intravenously as preoperative sedatives have received considerable study, but sleep laboratory research on benzodiazepines administered orally as hypnotics has not focused on assessment of cardiovascular changes. Analysis of heart rate (HR) data collected in sleep laboratory studies on the effects of 0.5 mg of triazolam (Halcion) and 30 mg of flurazepam (Dalmane) demonstrated that both benzodiazepine hypnotics produced a significant HR elevation that was present for up to 4 h during sleep. By the 3rd night of bedtime administration of triazolam, the HR increase was no longer statistically significant, but on the 5th night of flurazepam administration, HR was still significantly elevated over baseline levels. The HR elevation does not appear to be of clinical significance for most patients. However, this finding indicates that benzodiazepines administered at hypnotic-dose levels have peripheral as well as central effects.", 
    "3": "Prophylactic effects of psychotropic drugs on 55 schizophrenics in remission were evaluated for 3 years in a double-blind controlled study employing a cross-over design. Patients were randomly assigned to the following drugs orally administered twice a day: placebo; diazepam 15 mg; imipramine 50 mg; chlorpromazine 75 mg; and haloperidol 3 mg. The number of days of remission for each patient was recorded. Since only two patients received all five drug treatments, the data were analyzed using the number of days allocated to the \"first assigned drugs\" only and the cross-over aspect of the experimental design was disregarded. All patients treated with either the placebo, diazepam or imipramine relapsed within a year. On the other hand, four patients treated with chlorpromazine, or with haloperidol, were in remission for more than 1 year. Fifty percent of the patients relapsed within 16 days with placebo; 88 days with diazepam; 30 days with imipramine; 165 days with chlorpromazine; and 74 days with haloperidol. Within a year, only chlorpromazine significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to placebo and imipramine. At the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs. These data suggest that neuroleptic treatment for a longer period is vitally important to prevent relapse even in schizophrenics in remission and that such a trial seems an efficient method for investigating the prophylactic effects of neuroleptics.", 
    "4": "The kinetics of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to synaptosomal (P2) membranes from rat cerebral cortex was studied. The pseudo-first order association at 0 degrees was curvilinear and the association rate was increased with increasing concentrations of ligand. The association curve was resolved best as two linear exponentials, representing a fast and a slow component. The percentage of each association component varied with the ligand concentration. Association was slightly decreased in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid. Dissociation at 0 degrees, whether equilibrium binding had occurred at 0 degrees or 37 degrees, was also biphasic. The dissociation of the complexes was more rapid at higher concentrations of ligand. Dissociation was slower in the presence of gamma-aminobutyric acid, and this effect was more pronounced at higher concentrations of ligand. Prolonged preincubation at 37 degrees either in the presence or in the absence of [3H]flunitrazepam also decreased the dissociation rate. Dissociation was faster before equilibrium than after equilibrium had been reached. These results are discussed in terms of one homogeneous type of benzodiazepine receptor with two interconvertible conformations.", 
    "5": "Free plasma concentrations were studied after i.v. administration of three different doses (2.5, 5, 7.5 mg/kg respectively) of 3-N,N-dimethylcarbamoyloxy-7-chloro-5-phenyl-1-methyl-1,3-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (camazepam) to three healthy male mongrel dogs. Total plasma concentration was measured by a specific gas-liquid chromatography technique. The protein binding of camazepam in dog plasma was studied by using the equilibrium dialysis method and found to vary from 88.5 to 76.7% when the total drug concentration increased from 8 ng/ml to 8 micrograms/ml. For the subsequent pharmacokinetic analysis the calculated free camazepam plasma concentrations were used. The superposition principle was applied to each dog demonstrating that a linear pharmacokinetic model was applicable. Computer analysis showed that the pharmacokinetics of camazepam could be conveniently described by a three-compartment model assuming that the drug elimination occurred from the central compartment exclusively. The half-life of the terminal elimination phase ranged from 6.4 to 10.5 h, a finding which might suggest that camazepam could exhibit long-lasting effects.", 
    "6": "The effect of 0.05 and 0.03 mg/kg of intravenously administered lorazepam on the ventricular fluid pressure (VFP) was recorded continuously for 45-90 minutes in 13 wakeful spontaneously breathing unanaesthetized patients with hydrocephalus. The initial VFP was low in 11 patients with low-pressure hydrocephalus, and at the upper level of normal in 2 who had stenosis of the aqueduct. Lorazepam caused minute changes in VFP. The largest transient increased (7 and 16 torr) occurred in the two patients with the highest initial VFP. Blood acid-base balance, blood pressure, and heart rate remained unaltered. However, lorazepam caused such drowsiness that it was difficult to check the patients' level of consciousness. For this reason, intravenously administered lorazepam in a dosage of 0.03 mg/kg or more seems unsuitable for premedication in neurosurgical patients with brain disease.", 
    "7": "Using the method of quantitative spectrophotometry the activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was determined in a culture of the brain tissue of a 8- to 10- week-old human embryo. To the culture medium the blood serum of schizophrenic patients treated with leponex was added. In the control experiments the sera of healthy subjects, non-treated schizophrenics, and schizophrenics treated with phenothiazines and benzodiazepines were added. Leponex caused a statistically significant lowering of the LDH activity in the culture cells irrespectively of the prevalence of discrete or monolithic forms of the mitochondria in them. This effect of leponex distinguished this drug from other psychopharmacological agents tested by the author. A connection between mitochondria transition from the descrete to the monolithic form on the one hand, and the LDH activity, i.e. transition of the cells to the glycolytic pathway of respiration on the other, has not been confirmed.", 
    "8": "The benzodiazepine diazepam and the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 were tested alone or in combination for their influence on scopolamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. The benzodiazepine antagonist had no effect by itself, but prevented the enhancement of scopolamine-induced locomotor stimulation produced by diazepam.", 
    "9": "After 3 days of dosing rats with lorazepam (0.25 mg/kg), tolerance developed to its sedative effects. Recovery from this tolerance was rapid. No differences could be detected in undrugged behaviour 24 h after the last dose and no differences in response to a probe injection could be found when 2 drug-free days intervened between the chronic treatment and test dose. RO 15-1788 (1-4 mg/kg) antagonised the sedative effects of acute lorazepam (0.5 and 0.25 mg/kg), but chronic treatment with these doses concomitantly with lorazepam did not prevent the development of tolerance. However, 4 mg/kg RO 15-1788 administered for 5 days at the same time as lorazepam (0.5 mg/kg) and again 45 min later attenuated the development of tolerance. Plasma concentrations after acute and chronic treatment did not differ for 0.25 mg/kg lorazepam, but they were lower following chronic treatment with 0.5 mg/kg. Therefore the development of behavioural tolerance in rats to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines probably involves changes in benzodiazepine receptors, in addition to a pharmacokinetic contribution after treatment with high doses.", 
    "10": "In a double-blind controlled study lasting 8 weeks, 50 anxious psychoneurotic outpatients with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety or panic disorder were randomly assigned to alprazolam (n=30), a new benzodiazepine, or placebo (n=20), after a washout period of 1 week. Alprazolam at dosages between 0.25 and 3 mg/day was found to be significantly better than placebo in the treatment of either disorder. The finding that alprazolam was effective in the treatment of panic disorder is of interest as this diagnostic category is usually treated with tricyclic antidepressants or MAO inhibitors.", 
    "11": "An attempt was made to evaluate tranquilizing effects of three neuroleptic drugs (10 and 50 mg melperone, 1 mg haloperidol, and 50 mg chlorpromazine) and diazepam (10 mg) on experimental anxiety in normal subjects. This was done by studying the effects of the drugs on the anticipatory autonomic (skin conductance) response evoked during aversive classical conditioning. Diazepam, 50 mg melperone, and chlorpromazine completely abolished the anticipatory response, decreased the number of conditioned and unconditioned responses, and decreased skin conductance level. Treatment with 10 mg melperone and haloperidol had no effect on the conditioned and unconditioned responses.", 
    "12": "Normal male volunteers took single acute doses of either diazepam or placebo under double-blind conditions in three simulated public speaking experiments. Measures of palmar sweating and subjective anxiety showed that anticipation of speaking in public increased anxiety relative to baseline and prestress conditions, and performance of public speaking further increased anxiety. A dose-related anxiolytic effect of diazepam on subjective anxiety supported the model's clinical relevance. Moreover, the intensity of the subject's public speaking phobia predicted both degree of prestress anxiety relief from 10 mg diazepam and overall anxiety level, regardless of medication, throughout the experimental session. A measure of traditionalism predicted placebo and 5 mg diazepam response during prestress: As in previous clinical trials, high traditionalism scorers reported more relief from placebo, whereas low scorers showed more relief from diazepam.", 
    "13": "The liver first pass effect of pinazepam in four anaesthetized rabbits was determined by measuring the concentrations of this compound and those of its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam in the plasma from the portal and hepatic veins. Anaesthesia was induced with an i.p. injection of urethane (1.5 g/kg). Portal and hepatic veins were exposed by midline incision. Pinazepam (20 mg/kg) was orally administered in a single dose by stomach intubation. Blood was simultaneously drawn from the portal and hepatic veins of each rabbit at different intervals after dosing. Pinazepam plasma levels were significantly higher in portal than hepatic vein. While N-desmethyldiazepam concentrations were significantly higher in the hepatic than portal vein plasma. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that the rabbit liver extracts pinazepam from the blood and converts this compound into N-desmethyldiazepam.", 
    "14": "Though ophthalmologists operate upon patients that are in a debilitated state, a general anesthesia has to be employed with increasing frequency. Flunitrazepam, known to possess good cardiovascular tolerance, was studied to evaluate its effects on intraocular pressure in 34 unselected patients undergoing 41 operations under general anesthesia, usually 41 operations under general anesthesia, usually for retinal detachment or cataract. Ocular pressure was normal in all cases before surgery, but a history of chronic respiratory insufficiency was obtained in 8 cases and of cardiovascular disease in 18. After premedication with 0.02 mg . kg-1 of flunitrazepam and 0.01 mg . kg-1 of atropine, anesthesia was induced by 0.04 mg . kg-1 i.v. of flunitrazepam alone. No marked alterations in cardiac of respiratory functions were observed. Intraocular pressure was measured with a Schi\u00f6tz tonometer, just before and 5 minutes after the i.v. injection of flunitrazepam. Results showed -- before: 1.61 +/- 0.51 kPa (12.1 +/- 3.8 mmHg); after: 1.09 +/- 0.36 kPa (8.2 +/- 2.7 mmHg) -- a statistically reduction of 32 p.cent. The precise mechanism of action of flunitrazepam on intraocular pressure is not known, but cannot be related to the reduction in aqueous humor secretory flow or the marked diminution in arterial or venous pressure. A probable explanation is the lowering of resistance to aqueous humor flow exterior to the ocular globe as a result of the muscle relaxant properties of the product. Flunitrazepam appears to be a narcohypnotic of choice in ophthalmological surgery on these inherently debilitated patients.", 
    "15": "Clocapramine was introduced into clinical use as a successor to carpipramine which is designated as a \"d\u00e9sinhibiteur' by Deniker et al. Pharmacological and biochemical studies were carried out in order to elucidate the central action of clocapramine. Antidopaminergic activity of clocapramine was more potent than that of carpipramine. Clocapramine did not show any imipramine-like action; on the other hand, carpipramine partially did. We discuss the correlation between the preclinical findings so far obtained and clinical disinhibitory activity.", 
    "16": "The results of treatment of neurotic disorders with single or divided daily doses of the anxiolytic drug clobazam have been compared. The trial was performed in two groups, each of 57 patients, paired according to age, sex, diagnosis, severity of initial disorder, and total daily dose. The 114 subjects formed a random subgroup from a total of 1369 patients taking part in a postmarketing surveillance trial of clobazam. In view of the changes in the overall severity of the symptoms, in \"persistent anxiety\" and \"anxiety crises\", in \"sleep disorders\", the global clinical impression and the tolerance, it is concluded that clobazam is a useful drug in the treatment of anxiety, and that single or divided daily dosage schedules produce similar results.", 
    "17": "The practical utilization of clinical pharmacokinetics data are fundamentally different for benzodiazepines and antidepressants. This difference is a consequence of the difference in time-course of action of the two types of drugs. The anxiolytic, sedative or hypnotic effect of benzodiazepines is usually immediate, and the dose can be titrated on the basis of effect measurements. Pharmacokinetic data on benzodiazepines thus in particular are important for design of dose, dose intervals and prediction (warning) about possible accumulation after repeated doses. Different benzodiazepines differ in pharmacokinetic properties, and the clinician should be aware of these differences in order to select the proper drug for a given purpose. Antidepressants are characterized by exerting their effect gradually ovec weeks. It has been shown that the therapeutic effect is related to the steady state plasma concentration which may vary considerably among patients on a standard dose. A major significance of pharmacokinetics of antidepressants thus is, that therapy guided by monitoring of plasma levels of active compounds will improve both safety and efficacy of the treatment. For antidepressants and for benzodiazepines knowledge of the pharmacokinetics is the basis of designing rational dose schedules that take influencing factors such as age, disease, concurrent treatment, etc. into account.", 
    "18": "After establishing the definition of an anxiolytic, the use of these drugs in the treatment of psychopathological states is examined. Whilst it is clear that the balance of evidence is against their use in depression unaccompanied by a significant level of anxiety, it is nevertheless the case that these drugs have an established place in the management of mixed anxiety-depression. This leads to a number of logical possibilities concerning the mode of action of anxiolytics and the relationships between depression and anxiety: these possibilities are examined. Complementary uses of anxiolytics adjunctive to pharmacological and non-pharmacological techniques for treating depression are also considered.", 
    "19": "The development of the benzodiazepin molecule has led to drugs which are specially indicated in the management of anxiety. Such drugs may be ingested overnight in which a beneficial effect on sleep is followed by an anxiolytic effect the next day, or during the day. In each case it is desirable that their day time effect is without or with only minimal impairment of performance. In the present paper studies on the effects of two anxiolytic (potassium chlorazepate and clobazam) on sleep and on performance will be reviewed. Potassium chlorazepate is usually given as a single dose (15 mg) overnight. It has useful hypnotic activity and a sustained anxiolytic effect the next day related to the activity of its long-acting metabolite, nordiazepam. Further, unlike most if not all other, 1,4 benzodiazepines it is difficult to unequivocally impairment of performance. On the other hand clobazam is usually given as repeated doses (10-20 mg) during the day, and with this 1,5-benzodiazepine it is also difficult to establish impairments of performance. Anxiolytics without impairment of performance during the day have obvious clinical advantages, and if they also have a useful hypnotic activity they can be particularly appropriate for the management of insomnia secondary to anxiety.", 
    "20": "The various clinical effects of benzodiazepines have been attributed to the presence of saturable binding sites, stereospecific and of high affinity in the central nervous system. Good correlations have been described between the inhibition of the binding of [3H]diazepam and the anticonvulsant and anticonflictual properties of benzodiazepines. Such results would suggest that these binding sites are the pharmacological receptors responsible for the therapeutic properties of benzodiazepines. In addition, the neuromediator which has been associated with benzodiazepines in terms of its functions is GABA. Up to the present, the anticonvulsant and anticonflictual properties of substances acting on benzodiazepine receptors could not apparently be dissociated. However, b using quinoline derivatives we have been able to dissociate anticonflictual and anticonvulsant properties for substances acting upon benzodiazepine receptors. These substances (PK 8165 and PK 9084) displace diazepam from binding sites (Ki of 100 to 400 nM) in the brain but not peripherally. The fact that PK 9084 and PK 8165 are more active on benzodiazepine derivatives in the presence of anions suggests that they act upon receptors coupled with a chloride ionophore-like. Benzodiazepines, PK 8165 and PK 9084 have anticonflictual properties but cause neither ataxia nor sedation even at doses 5 to 20 times greater than anticonflictual doses. Furthermore, these compounds are not anticonvulsant. In contrast to benzodiazepines, PK 8165 and PK 9084 do not decrease the cGMP of the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. This cGMP pool being the reflection of the activation of GABAergic receptors, it would seem that these substances must act on a sub-unit of benzodiazepine receptors not coupled with GABA but associated with the chloride ionophore. This sub-unit could be responsible for the anticonflictual properties of substances acting upon benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "21": "Benzodiazepines have been shown to produce most, if not all, of their pharmacological effects by directly interacting with specific recognition or receptor sites within the CNS. The presence of benzodiazepine receptors has prompted many studies as to their possible physiological significance, including attempts at isolating an endogenous ligand. To data a number of substances including the purines inosine and hypoxanthine, nicotinamide, beta-carbolines, and an unidentified peptide factor have been isolated and postulated as being endogenous ligands. A number of these compounds have also been shown to either mimic or antagonize the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines, although it is still unclear whether these occur under physiological conditions. More recent biochemical studies have established a functional (and perhaps structural) relationship between te benzodiazepine receptor and the receptor for gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in brain. It now appears that the benzodiazepine receptor actually exists as a \"supramolecular complex\" consisting of a GABA receptor and an associated chloride channel. A number of anxiolytic drugs including the barbiturates and pyrazolopyridines appear to act through these associated \"regulatory\" sites rather than directly on the benzodiazepine recognition site.", 
    "22": "Fifty-five patients complaining of insomnia entered a single-blind general practice study and were treated with either 400 mg chlormezanone or 20 mg temazepam at night for 2 weeks. There was a significant increase from baseline for both treatments in average duration of sleep, quality of sleep and frequency of waking refreshed. There was no significant difference between the treatments, with overall effectiveness rated similarly. It is concluded that chlormezanone is at least as useful as temazepam in treating insomnia.", 
    "23": "The benzodiazepine hypnotics triazolam (T) (0.25, 0.5 and 1.0 mg), nitrazepam (N) (10 mg) and flunitrazepam (F) (2.0 mg) were investigated with respect to night-time effects and day-time residual effects, in healthy, young subjects. Drug or placebo was taken orally at home before bed-time. Tests for residual drug effects were administered in the laboratory throughout the following day. They included multiple sleep latency tests, the digit cancellation test, questionnaires, self-ratings and experimenter ratings. In addition, motor activity was recorded with a wrist-worn activity monitor during the drug-night, the day following drug intake, and the two subsequent nights. Residual effects consisted of reduced day-time motor activity (T 0.5, F 2.0), enhanced self-rated day-time sleepiness (T 1.0, F 2.0), increased experimenter-rated tiredness (T 0.5, F 2.0), and impaired performance in the digit cancellation test (F 2.0). Grogginess was a common symptom in the morning after flunitrazepam. All drugs reduced motor activity during sleep, and increased subjective depth and quietness of sleep. Increased motor activity in the second post-drug night was observed after triazolam 0.5 mg. The results indicate that a small dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine may be appropriate for promoting sleep without subsequent day-time residual sequelae.", 
    "24": "10 healthy male and female subjects spent 7 nights both with a quiet surrounding and defined noise of subsonic jet fly-overs in a sleep laboratory. During the last 4 nights they were medicated in a double-blind cross-over test design with the benzodiazepine 8-chloro-6-phenyl-4H-s-triazolo (4,3-a)-(1,4)benzodiazepine (estazolam, BAY k 4200) at a dosage of 2 mg and placebo. On each following morning they passed a tracking test and an apparative mental arithmetic calculation test in order to evaluate a potential hangover. Simultaneously heart rate was registered continuously. The results were as follows: About 10 h after medication significant hang-over effects of estazolam in psycho-physiological performance could still be seen. Statistically significant differences between the conditions with estazolam and placebo in the range of 5 to 15% were found. Hang-over is not restricted to tracking and mental performance but can also be seen in slightly lowered heart rate.", 
    "25": "Experimental sleep disturbances (model insomnia) were produced by the administration of methylphenidate (MPD) 10 mg and caffeine (CAF) 150 mg. The effect of temazepam (TEM), 15 mg or 30 mg, on the model was investigated. All-night polysomnography was performed on 8 normal young male subjects under each of the following 9 conditions: baseline, MPD 10 mg, CAF 150 mg, TEM 15 mg, TEM 30 mg, MPD + TEM 15 mg, MPD + TEM 30 mg, CAF + TEM 15 mg, CAF + TEM 30 mg. A reduction in total sleep time and total amount of stage REM (S-REM) sleep and an increase in the sleep latency and wake time (S-W) were observed in both the MPD and CAF nights. The sleep latency was significantly longer in the CAF night than in the MPD night. Administration of TEM 15 mg or TEM 30 mg alone caused very few modifications in the sleep parameters. These drugs in combination with MPD or CAF resulted in almost complete recovery of the sleep disturbance induced by MPD or CAF. The results indicate that CAF and MPD produced similar models of insomnia except for a greater sleep latency for CAF than for MPD. Both models were useful in the evaluation of hypnotic drugs such as temazepam.", 
    "26": "In a double-blind study, fifty-five healthy, male medical students received a tranquilizer (bromazepam, 'Lexotanil') or placebo according to dosage group (placebo, 1.5 mg and 3 mg bromazepam). The subjects were randomly allocated to three groups (placebo: n = 19; 1.5 mg: n = 19; and 3 mg: n = 17). Dependent variables tested were the subjective assessment of performance and the level of activation (self-rating), and aspects of psychomotor function were assessed using the standard testing devices. The medication was administered for a total of 14 days. The testing times reported here were: before start, and after 7 and 14 days of administration of serum or placebo. The subjective evaluation (self-rating) such as performance assessment and level of activation demonstrated no changes related to either the medication or the length of time elapsed. The objective measures of performance revealed two main effects: lengthening of time of reaction to optical stimuli during the course of the study, especially in the higher bromazepam dosage group (sedative effect). This sedative effect was, however, relatively weak since, despite this observation, there was a significant training effect in the 3 mg group with regard to attentiveness and alertness testing. The results were also evaluated for a possible effect on driving ability. In the group studied here and at the relatively low dosage administered, any possible negative influence can be disregarded.", 
    "27": "Twelve normal subjects were tested on a number of measures both before and 1,3 and 5 h after 10 mg diazepam, 100 and 200 mg tofisopam and a placebo. The measures included self-ratings of mood, bodily symptoms, hostility and sleep, the electroencephalogram (EEG), reaction time, tapping, digit symbol substitution, the symbol copying test, and plasma levels. Diazepam showed a clear profile of action, producing EEG changes, pronounced sedation and psychological impairment. The last two effects were maximal at 1 h and had worn off by 5 h. The EEG was recorded at 3 h only. Tofisopam in no way resembled diazepam. It produced no changes on the EEG or psychological tests and a very mild stimulant effect was apparent on the ratings. While diazepam was easily detectable in the blood, tofisopam did not bind to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "28": "The use of the drug grandaxin (made in Hungary) has demonstrated its high activity in the treatment of psychopathological disturbances of neurotic origin. Its administration is preferable when vegetative and hyposthenic disturbances are prevalent in the neurosis clinical picture. At the same time it alleviates the intensity of phobic and senestho-hypochondriacal experiences, however, its administration as the sole means for eliminating these disturbances seems undesirable. Neither can grandaxin be the drug of choice in controlling anxious and agrypnic disturbances. Psychogenic somatic syndromes have also appeared to be insensitive to the treatment with this drug. The side-effects produced by grandaxin are mild. The most persistent are nausea and headaches which develop in patients receiving high doses and subside in most cases spontaneously on reduction of the latter. No complications were noted.", 
    "29": "A double-blind study was conducted on triazolam, using nitrazepam and placebo as control compounds; statistically significant differences were demonstrated in favor of triazolam compared with placebo and with nitrazepam in many aspects of efficacy, but there was no significant difference between triazolam and nitrazepam in the incidence of concomitant symptoms and side effects. The fact that a certain quantity of triazolam is equivalent in strength to ten times that quantity of nitrazepam suggests the high potency of the former. These data indicate that triazolam is a valuable sleep inducer, with highly-rated efficacy and safety.", 
    "30": "Effects of the benzodiazepine derivative 8-chloro-6-phenyl-4H-s-triazolo(4,3-a)-(1,4)benzodiazepine (estazolam, BAY k 4200) on sleep stage patterns of 10 subjects were studied in the laboratory under double-blind conditions during quiet and noise-disturbed nights. The noise of 17-20 jet fly-overs was presented during sleep. The mean peak level of the noise was 97 dB(A) measured indoors near the sleeper's head. Intermittent wakefulness, stage 1 and movement time (MT) increased during noise-disturbed nights. Estazolam suppressed the phases of intermittent wakefulness during the quiet night and reduced stage 1 and MT. Arousal reactions by jet noise were milder and shorter under estazolam. Both effects resulted in equal amounts of intermittent wakefulness, stage 1 and MT during the noise-disturbed night under estazolam and during the quiet night under placebo. The dosage of 2 mg estazolam had no significant effect on stage REM, but delta-sleep decreased. Hints of carry-over effects were found in the sleep stage patterns. Effects of estazolam were seen in the estimations of sleep quality and mood by the subjects in the morning after awakening.", 
    "31": "Pharmacokinetic investigations after oral and intravenous application of 50 mg and 100 mg 7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-2,2-dihydroxy-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3-carbonic acid (dipotassium clorazepate, DPC, Tranxilium, Tranx\u00e8ne) were conducted with two groups of male subjects (A: N = 7; B: N = 6). DPC and its metabolites, nordiazepam (ND) and oxazepam (OX), were measured in blood and urine. After oral application of DPC the expected metabolite pattern was observed. But after i.v. infection of 50 mg or 100 mg DPC a rapid increase of DPC- and also ND-concentrations in the serum was shown. The pattern of the metabolites excreted in urine differed considerably between the groups with oral and i.v. administration of DPC. The possible causes of rapid biotransformation in the serum are discussed.", 
    "32": "A sensitive and highly specific electron capture gas-liquid chromatographic method was developed for the determination of flunitrazepam in human plasma. The method involves selective extraction of the drug into hexane from plasma at pH 9 followed by back-extraction into 2 N sulfuric acid for clean-up procedure, and re-extraction by 20% toluene-hexane at pH 2. The sensitivity limit of the method is 0.5 ng/ml of plasma. Its specificity was tested for about 45 drugs frequently administered as co-medication in hospitalized patients, including other benzodiazepines. The method proves very suitable for investigating the clinical pharmacokinetics of flunitrazepam as well as for monitoring therapeutic plasma levels and in forensic situations following over-dosage, and was successfully applied within a clinical pharmacokinetic study in an intensive care unit.",

Screening results after a single p.o. dose of 1 mg lormetazepam (Noctamid-1) are also reported.", 
    "34": "The effects of a short-acting benzodiazepine hypnotic, triazolam (0.5 mg), on sleep, performance, and arousal threshold were assessed in 20 male poor sleepers (age 21 +/- 2.37 years). Following in a laboratory screening night, all subjects received placebo for 3 nights (single-blind), ten received triazolam and ten placebo for 6 nights (double-blind), and all received placebo on 2 withdrawal nights (single-blind). All effects described below were statistically significant. Triazolam reduced sleep latency and increased total sleep time and sleep efficiency. Percent Stage 2 was increased and percent Stage 4 was reduced during treatment. Morning performance, measured 8.25 h post-drug, showed no decrements. Acute effects were assessed on treatment night 6 during arousals from sleep at 1.5, 3, and 5 h post-administration: performance was impaired in triazolam subjects on the Wilkinson 4-Choice Reaction Time Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Williams Word Memory Test, and Card Sorting Task. In the morning following treatment night 6, long-term memory was tested using a recognition task requiring subjects to identify words presented during night-time test batteries: triazolam subjects correctly identified fewer target words. Triazolam administration produced anterograde amnesic effects. However, in a Paired Associates Test learned prior to drug ingestion on the previous evening, triazolam did not impair morning recall of word pairs. Threshold for arousal from slow wave sleep was elevated during treatment, and triazolam subjects did not show increased sensitivity to the arousing tone over nights as did placebo subjects.", 
    "35": "Nanogram quantities of flunitrazepam and its major metabolite, desmethylflunitrazepam, can be reliably quantitated in human plasma using electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. After addition of methylnitrazepam as the internal standard, plasma samples are extracted with an organic solvent (benzene:isoamyl alcohol). The organic extract is separated, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and injected onto the chromatograph using an automatic sampling system which allows up to 100 analyses/24 h. The sensitivity limits are 0.5 ng/ml for flunitrazepam and 1-2 ng/ml for desmethylflunitrazepam. Use of the method is illustrated in a study of the pharmacokinetic properties of flunitrazepam following a single 1.0-mg intravenous dose.", 
    "36": "The concentrations of lormetazepam and its glucuronide in plasma and milk were determined during administration of 10 daily doses of lormetazepam 2 mg (2 tablets of Noctamid-1) to five mothers delivered by Caesarian section. Their babies were breast-fed throughout the study, and the plasma levels of lormetazepam and its glucuronide were determined three times in the babies. At 12 and 24 h after administration, the plasma level of lormetazepam was about 3.5 ng/ml and 1.8 ng/ml in mothers, and below 0.09 ng/ml in the children. In milk the lormetazepam concentration was below 0.2 ng/ml. The plasma level of glucuronide varied between 24 ng/ml at 12 h and 11 ng/ml 24 h after administration. Almost no accumulation of unchanged lormetazepam was observed (factor: 1.3). The ratio of the levels of lormetazepam in milk and plasma was estimated to be below 0.06, and for the glucuronide the ratio was 0.04. The quantity of free and conjugated active ingredient transferred to the children via breast milk was calculated to be at most 100 ng/mg, corresponding to 0.35% of the maternal dose, which is regarded as tolerable.", 
    "37": "Three series of behavioral experiments, i.e. hole-board, open-field and spontaneous motor activity test, were carried out on mice with the goal of determining the effects of the interaction between caffeine and two peculiar benzodiazepines (BDZ). The drugs, desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) and chlor-desmethyldiazepam (Cl-DMDZ), were administered acutely by the intraperitoneal route. In preliminary experiments, the effects of several doses of caffeine were examined in the three in order to obtain some indication of the doses to use for interaction experiments. Therefore, stimulant doses of caffeine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) were associated with the two benzodiazepines. It was found that BDZ counteracted the effect of caffeine in the hole-board and in the spontaneous motor activity tests. By contrast, in the open-field situation, the association always gave rise to an increase in exploration activity. Furthermore, the present investigations showed, once again, that chlor-desmethyldiazepam is more active than the other benzodiazepine.", 
    "38": "The transient amnesias produced by drugs may have much in common with the more permanent amnesias associated with organic brain damage. This possibility was investigated using two benzodiazepines, diazepam and lorazepam, with medical student volunteers. In Experiment 1, 27 subjects received a 2ml intravenous injection of either diazepam (7.5 mg) or of lorazepam (3.0 mg) or of normal saline. In Experiment 2, a further 13 subjects were given lorazepam (2.5 mg) or saline. A double blind procedure was used. Neither drug had an appreciable effect on span-type short-term memory (except with 2-channel presentation). Both drugs produced severe anterograde amnesia in other forms of memory test: the amnesic effect of lorazepam lasted for several hours. This amnesia was not attributable to failures of perception. Lorazepam appeared to affect recognition even more than recall. In a test with lorazepam no evidence was obtained that the drug increases susceptibility to proactive interference. With both drugs, recall and recognition were unimpaired of material presented about 10 min before the injection; this shows that the drugs did not affect retrieval mechanisms.", 
    "39": "The concentrations of free fatty acids in plasma were estimated in thirty-three subjects, before and after (24 hours and 72 hours) the start of bromazepam oral administration in a daily dose of 6 mg (1.5 mg at 7 a.m., 1.5 mg at 3 p.m. and 3 mg at 11 p.m.). A fourth estimation was performed 72 hours after drug discontinuation. A control group of twelve subjects received a placebo according to the same dosage pattern. In comparison with the first estimation, the subsequent free fatty acid values showed a significant decrease (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.001, respectively), whereas the control group showed no significant decrease (p greater than 0.05). The aim of the present article is to present the results of the three day-standard oral administration of bromazepam on free fatty acid concentration of plasma. All the samples, including the control group, were taken from a population free from any disease affecting adipose tissue metabolism.", 
    "40": "Sixty Filipino insomniacs participated in a double-blind study of temazepam on an outpatient basis. Patients who took 10 or 20 mg of temazepam slept better than those who took placebo on the first three nights of taking the hypnotic. There was a significant reduction in the time of onset of sleep, and an increase in the duration of sleep. No untoward side effects from temazepam were noted in this study.", 
    "41": "The efficacy and safety of temazepam (30 mg) were compared with the efficacy and safety of flurazepam hydrochloride (30 mg) and placebo in a four-day, double-blind study in 75 geriatric convalescent-home patients with insomnia. The efficacy and safety profiles of the two active drugs were similar. Patients treated with temazepam, however, reported significantly less drug hangover both on awakening and during the entire day after each night of treatment than did patients receiving flurazepam or placebo. The difference between temazepam and flurazepam was probably due to the drugs' markedly different half-lives, temazepam's mean half-life being ten hours compared with 65.5 hours for the active metabolite of flurazepam. It is well recognized that the elderly may be especially sensitive to the adverse effects associated with the accumulation of the long-acting metabolite of flurazepam. Since temazepam has no active metabolites and minimal accumulation, it is a particularly appropriate hypnotic for use in geriatric patients.", 
    "42": "Six prodrug-type esters of oxazepam and lorazepam, which are potent benzodiazepine tranquillizers, were synthesized in 2-14C-labelled form. Pharmacokinetics of the compounds administered i.p. to mice were compared with respect to the effect of the acyl groups on the brain appearance of the esters and the parent drugs. Brain accumulation of the compounds administered was characterized by the areas under the brain-to-blood concentration ratio-time functions (AUQ). The rates of brain penetration were characterized by the slope of the correlation between i.v. dose and 1 -min brain levels. These slopes as well as AUQ values depended upon hydrophobicity (Rm) according to an optimum function. The lag times of the brain appearance of the parent drugs showed a minimum at about the same Rm at which AUQ values were maximal. The rates of brain appearance of the parent compounds correlated with the hepatic microsomal hydrolysis rate of their esters.", 
    "43": "As one index of sympathetic reactivity, electrodermal responses (EDR) were evoked from central (hypothalamic) and peripheral (ulnar nerve) sites in pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. When compared with intravenous chlorpromazine (ED50 approximately 1.0 mg/kg), only thioridazine, trifluoperazine, and pimozide were less potent than chlorpromazine in reducing the amplitude of these centrally-evoked sympathetic-cholinergic responses. Perphenazine and methotrimeprazine (a non-neuroleptic phenothiazine) were about twice as potent as chlorpromazine. Haloperidol and triflupromazine were about 5 times as potent and chlorprothixine was more than 10 times as potent. None of these agents reduced the peripherally-evoked electrodermal response, indicating a CNS mode of action. Diazepam was without effect at either site. In addition, pretreatment with yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg. i.v.) did not significantly alter the ED50 for any of the above drugs. These results demonstrate that all of the phenothiazines and non-phenothiazine neuroleptics tested produce a dose-dependent central sympatho-inhibition and that diazepam does not. The results also suggest that there is no significant correlation between central sympatho-inhibition and the antipsychotic potency of these compounds and that their depression of central sympathetic outflow is independent of alpha-adrenergic mechanisms in the CNS.", 
    "44": "One hundred thirty-seven current or prospective recipients of hypnotics were screened to obtain a sample of 12 severely insomniac patients for a study concerning efficacy and side effects of 2 mg flunitrazepam and 100 mg pentobarbital as hypnotics. During the baseline period, these 12 subjects showed wide intraindividual variability of sleep and performance. This variability was not reduced by the hypnotics, which on the average did not adversely affect performance. Flunitrazepam, but not pentobarbital, slightly reduced sleep latency. Neither hypnotic prolonged sleep duration or reduced the number of wakings. The generalizability of the results to the population of recipients of hypnotics is discussed.", 
    "45": "Cyclic 3',5' guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, stimulated in brain slices by ouabain, potassium, and sodium azide depolarization, have been found to be inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by both behaviorally active and inactive benzodiazepines. ED50's for these benzodiazepines bear no relation to potencies established from receptor membrane binding studies; however, these values do correspond to ED50's calculated for several known membrane stabilizing agents tested in this system. The concentration of [3H]flunitrazepam necessary to saturate the benzodiazepine receptor in identical slice preparations is considerably lower than that needed to initiate inhibition of depolarization-induced cGMP stimulation. Some of the reported in vivo actions of benzodiazepines on cGMP formation may be the result of membrane stabilizing actions of the benzodiazepines or mediated indirectly.", 
    "46": "Chronic lithium administration significantly changes characteristics of the circadian rhythms in rat brain alpha- and beta-adrenergic, muscarinic acetylcholine, dopamine, opiate, and benzodiazepine receptors. There are changes in the timing of the peak number of receptors (phase-position), in the amplitude of the rhythms, and in the 24-hour mean number of receptors. The circadian rhythm in the number of forebrain alpha- and beta-adrenergic and benzodiazepine receptors is abolished. The phase-position of forebrain acetylcholine and opiate receptors and striatal benzodiazepine receptors is delayed. As the rhythms of the dopamine receptor number and alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone secretion become bimodal, their phase positions are difficult to evaluate. The mean number of forebrain alpha- and beta-adrenergic, acetylcholine, opiate, and striatal benzodiazepine receptors increases. The mean number of forebrain benzodiazepine and striatal dopamine receptors and the mean concentration of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone decreases. Lithium has profound effects on each of the receptor rhythms measured. Slowing and altering circadian rhythms may contribute to the therapeutic effects of chronic lithium treatment in affective disorders.", 
    "47": "Lorazepam 0.05 mg X kg-1 and diazepam 0.1 mg X kg-1 administered intravenously were compared as sedatives for 42 patients undergoing Caesarean Section under epidural anaesthesia. After receiving the drug, 15 per cent of the diazepam patients and 32 per cent of the lorazepam patients were still agitated. Ten per cent of the diazepam patients and 36 per cent of the lorazepam patients had severe symptoms of delirium. These included hallucinations, confusion, agitation, restlessness, inappropriate weeping and repetitive hand movements. Memory impairment was greater with lorazepam. Thirty-five per cent of the diazepam patients had pain at the injection site. None of the lorazepam patients had such pain. Respiratory rate, heart rate and mean blood pressure did not change significantly in either group. Half the patients who had been given lorazepam had side effects that were bothersome enough to cause them to complain the following day. Lorazepam and diazepam were both unsatisfactory as sedatives for patients having Caesarean Section.", 
    "48": "Successful treatment of aggressive behavior depends on promptly addressing it, preventing violence by timely intervention, and proceeding with differential diagnosis and definitive medical or psychiatric treatment. Whenever a frightened, threatened, or hostile patient is identified, the staff should address this mood and begin measures to prevent a violet outcome, keeping safety uppermost in mind. Paradoxically, ignoring anger or beligerency augments its development by increasing the patient's suspiciousness, frustration, helplessness, or out-of-control feelings. Whenever possible the staff should adopt a conciliatory but firm approach aimed at resolving the crisis. Resolution may require force, which should be left to security personnel or effected only with overwhelming staff power. Armed patients are always the province of the police. Medication can be extremely effective as an aid in subduing patients, as short-term symptomatic treatment, and often in long-term management.", 
    "49": "There is now substantial evidence that several TIQs and beta-carbolines are present in vivo and increase during certain pathological conditions. It still remains to be determined, however, precisely what roles they play in endogenous functions and whether or not they are critical for the expression of these pathological conditions. Accumulating biochemical information continues to support the notion that these compounds can act as false transmitters. The exciting new findings, which will certainly receive a great deal more attention, concern the interaction of some of the beta-carbolines with the benzodiazepine receptor. Determining if a beta-carboline is an endogenous receptor ligand will attract further research interest on the theoretical and specifically clinically-directed levels. Biochemical, morphological, and behavioral data indicate that some of the condensation products can act as neurotoxins. Very few experiments have included an examination of long-term effects of exposure to one of these alkaloids, so the amount of information on this issue is limited. Chronic rather than acute administration of an alkaloid is more likely to mimic the pathological states in which these compounds are hypothesized to play a role. Biochemically, both the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems have been shown to be affected by chronic treatments with certain alkaloids. Progressive and long-term behavioral alterations also have been reported. Such changes may reflect an adaptation to an increase or decrease in activity of particular systems or a neurotoxic action.", 
    "50": "The various types of alkylation reactions with alkyl halides and their application in the gas chromatographic analysis of acidic compounds of pharmaceutical interest are reviewed. An extensive survey of the use of these methods for the analysis of various (classes of) compounds is given, with special reference to their determination in biological matrices.", 
    "51": "We have purified a small, basic protein with high affinity and selectivity for biogenic amine receptors to apparent homogeneity from the venom of Russell's viper (Vipera russelli). This protein, which we designate \"vipoxin,\" has Mr = 13,000, and appears to exist in solution as a single polypeptide chain. It may contain 2 atypical amino acids. Vipoxin inhibits in a dose-dependent manner the binding of 3H-ligands to biogenic amine receptors, with apparent Ki values of 3 nM at alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, 5 nM at alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, 15 nM at dopamine receptors, and 32 nM at serotonin receptors. At concentrations up to 1 microM, vipoxin is inactive at beta-adrenergic, histamine, nicotinic cholinergic, muscarinic cholinergic, adenosine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, benzodiazepine, or opiate receptor binding sites. The effect of vipoxin is essentially irreversible over 20 h at alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors and serotonin receptors and is only slightly reversible at dopamine receptors. Norepinephrine protects alpha-adrenergic receptors from inhibition by vipoxin, while dopamine does not. Vipoxin has no protease activity but does have phospholipase A2 activity, which cannot account for its action on receptors, since receptor binding is assayed in the presence of 1 mM CoSO4 which completely and selectively inhibits the phospholipase activity. Other phospholipases A2 in the same venom lack vipoxin's action on receptors. In physiologic experiments, vipoxin behaves as an agonist at alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in the rat vas deferens and is over an order of magnitude more potent than norepinephrine itself. At alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, it is neither a simple agonist nor an antagonist, but selectively potentiates norepinephrine. Vipoxin may be a useful tool for biogenic amine receptor characterization.", 
    "52": "Anthramycin and mitomycin C (MC) are two DNA reactive drugs, which bind covalently to GC pairs producing different effects on DNA: anthramycin stiffening and MC distorsion. This paper describes experiments in which we have used anthramycin as a probe to sense quantitatively the effects on DNA of MC binding. Saturation binding experiments show that both anthramycin and MC partially inhibit the binding of the other drug to DNA (maximum inhibition by MC and anthramycin, 22.4% and 19.7%, respectively) but by a mechanism other than direct site exclusion. This suggests that MC binds in the major groove of DNA, since anthramycin is known to bind in the minor groove. An abrupt reduction in the binding of anthramycin to DNA-MC complexes occurs between MC binding ratios of 0.030 and 0.035, which parallels and probably results from sudden intensification of a MC-induced DNA conformational change occurring between these binding ratios. Dialysis measurements indicate that anthramycin is very possibly binding at sites distant from MC sites and suggest a clustering of closely bound MC chromophores resulting from possible cooperative binding. S1 nuclease digest experiments demonstrate an initial enhancement of nuclease activity in DNA-MC complexes, the magnitude of which correlates well with the reduction of anthramycin binding, relative to the degree of MC binding. The enhanced nuclease activity in these complexes indicates regions of exposed DNA or helix base distortion which is related to or is the result of conformational change.", 
    "53": "The effects of nine benzodiazepines on the locomotor stimulation induced in mice by cocaine (4 mg . kg-1 i.p.) were studied. These benzodiazepines markedly enhanced cocaine-induced hyperactivity. This effect was observed at low doses, e.g. doses at least 8 times lower than those required to depress the stimulation caused by cocaine. Nitrazepam-induced enhancement of the hyperactivity elicited by cocaine was reduced or suppressed by blocking dopaminergic receptors with pimozide (0.015--0.03 mg . kg-1), by interrupting GABAergic transmission with picrotoxin (0.25--0.5 mg . kg-1) or blocking alpha- or beta-adrenergic receptors with prazosin (0.25 mg . kg-1) or dl-propranolol (4 mg . kg-1) respectively. At these doses, neither pimozide, picrotoxin, prazosin nor propranolol were able to modify the spontaneous locomotor activity or the stimulation elicited by cocaine alone. Strychnine (0.25--0.50 mg . kg-1) or methysergide (2 mg . kg-1) failed to alter the enhancement by nitrazepam of cocaine-induced hyperactivity. These results suggest that an interaction of benzodiazepines with some catecholaminergic processes, either directly or through the involvement of a GABAergic link, may account for their facilitatory activity on cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation.", 
    "54": "It has been proposed that GABAergic receptors possess two functionally distinct, but strictly co-operating binding sites, one for GABA itself, another for benzodiazepines. The activation of GABA receptor is followed by opening of the Cl- channels. This action is strengthened if both binding sites of GABA receptor are contemporaneously engaged by their respective agonists. Baclofen, a GABAergic drug, is able, in acute administration, to determine an increase of serum GH in man. The aim of this work was to control if benzodiazepines can strengthen this metabolic effect of Baclofen in vivo. Five healthy voluntary women were studied. Blood samples for serum GH evaluation were collected basally and 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 minutes after oral administration of 20 mg. of Baclofen. This test was repeated one week after oral administration of 12 mg. die of Diazepam. The results were analyzed for paired data. The finding show that the metabolic effect of Baclofen on GH secretion are prolonged in time after Diazepam premedication and suggest that GABA-benzodiazepines interaction is effective at hypothalamo-hypophyseal level in man.", 
    "55": "The binding of 3H-diazepam to membrane benzodiazepine receptors was examined in 2 psychogenetically selected lines of rats, which differ according to the selection criterion in avoidance behaviour (RHA/Verh greater than RLA/Verh) and, in addition, in emotionality (RHA/Verh less than RLA/Verh). RHA/Verh rats tended to show higher specific diazepam binding in all CNS-subregions when compared with RLA/Verh animals. Significant differences were found in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamic region and pons-medulla. These results reinforce the contention that a system involving benzodiazepine receptors may play a role in emotional behaviour.", 
    "56": "Three days after the acute oral administration of methyl mercury (MeHg), a 27-60% increase in the total number of binding sites for [3H]diazepam was seen in the retina and different areas of the rat brain, with no change, except in the retina, in the apparent dissociation constant for its ligand. In contrast, MeHg failed to change [3H]spiroperidol and [3H]GABA binding in the same areas. Moreover, MeHg decreased cyclic GMP content in the cerebellar cortex. The various possible mechanisms involved in the action of MeHg on benzodiazepine binding are discussed.", 
    "57": "The binding of [3H] L-quinuclidinylbenzilate to muscarinic receptors and [3H] flunitrazepam to benzodiazepine receptors were studied in the rat hippocampus after lesion of the fimbria-fornix. While the muscarinic receptors showed no change, the benzodiazepine receptors did change considerably at various time intervals. Two days after the lesion the specific [3H] flunitrazepam binding decreased 38%, while at 5 days it increased 65%. After 14 days of the lesion it still was significantly above normal. These changes are due to a variation in the number of sites, and not in affinity. Possible interpretations of these results are discussed.", 
    "58": "The noradrenergic innervation to the cerebellum was lesioned by intracerebroventricular 6-hydroxydopamine and the effects on GABA and benzodiazepine receptors followed by radiolabelling experiments. This lesion produced a 20% decrease in benzodiazepine receptor labelling in the cerebellum with no change in the labelling of GABA receptors. This provides further evidence for a lack of identity between the GABA and benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "59": "A gas chromatographic assay with electron-capture detection (GC--EC) is described for the metabolites of ethyl loflazepate (Victan), a new benzodiazepine with a potent anti-anxiety activity, in biological fluids. Since the parent drug undergoes a first-pass effect, pharmacokinetic data may only be obtained by measuring the total levels of two of the major metabolites. Accurate data can not be obtained for the metabolites separately since one of them (M1) is chemically transformed to the other (M2) during plasma sampling, storage and extraction. A sensitive, specific and accurate GC--EC assay is developed using a synthetic analogue of M2 as an internal standard. The limit of detection in plasma is approximately 2 ng/ml and the precision about 3% (within-run and between-run). The method is applied to plasma samples collected after oral administration of 2 mg and 4 mg of the drug in tablet form to human volunteers. The results obtained are correlated with those from an existing gas chromatographic--mass spectrometric assay. A very good correlation between the results (inter-laboratory comparison) is obtained, validating both techniques.", 
    "60": "The effects of a number of beta-carboline derivatives on [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine binding site were investigated. The potency of beta-carbolines at the benzodiazepine binding site appeared to be determined largely by the aromaticity of the molecule. Norharmane-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester was considerably more potent (IC50 10 nM) than its tetrahydro-beta-carboline analogue (IC50 6 microM). There is essentially no difference in potency between the (+)- and (--)-forms of the tetrahydro-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate analogues.", 
    "61": "Three possible endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptors, beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta CCE), tryptophylglycine (Trp-Gly) and ACTH peptides, have been tested, following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration in mice, for their direct effects on the CNS and the modification of diazepam's antileptazol activity. Whilst beta CCE and ACTH both reduced diazepam's antileptazol activity, only beta CCE had direct stimulant effects. Trp-Gly produced sedation and augmented the antileptazol effect of diazepam. Despite these differing effects, it remains possible that the endogenous ligand for the benzodiazepine receptors has a tryptophan-like structure.", 
    "62": "Diazepam is frequently used for pre- and peroperative sedation. However, at i.v. injection local pain and thrombophlebitis are not uncommon, probably due to tissue irritancy of the various organic solvents necessary to keep diazepam in aqueous solution. In this study the incidence of local adverse effects following i.v. injection of Diazemuls, a new lipid emulsion formulation, was compared with that of Apozepam, a glycoferol-water solution. We found that the latter preparation caused local pain and thrombophlebitis as often as reported with propyleneglycol-phenylcarbinol-ethanol preparations (Stesolid, Valium) and in a statistically higher incidence that the lipid emulsion form, which therefore seems more suitable for intravenous use.", 
    "63": "Clinical effects of thiopentone (3 mg/kg body weight) and diazepam (0.3 mg/kg) were compared for elective caesarean sections in two groups of 43 and 39 women, respectively. They were given general anaesthesia in left lateral tilt. The systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures were moderately elevated at onset of surgery in both groups, probably indicating light anaesthesia. Later, a gradual decrease to the preinduction levels was observed. The mean injection-delivery (I-D) interval was 344 s in the thiopentone group and 339 s in the diazepam group. The I-D intervals were shorter than 10 min in 39 of the cases in the thiopentone group and 38 cases in the diazepam group. Low Apgar scores at 1 min (6 or less) occurred in five of the neonates in each group, while all had normal Apgar scores at 5 min ( 7 or mor) As judged by the Apgar scores and the acid-base status of umbilical cord blood, the effects of the induction agents on the neonatal condition were indistinguishable in the two groups. In the thiopentone group, unpleasant recollections were reported in 5 out of 40 patients (12.5%) compared to none in the diazepam group. Diazepam-nitrous oxide anaesthesia is well accepted by the mothers and is alternative to supplementing thiopentone induction with a volatile gas for patients who have previous experienced wakefulness or express fear of awareness. The main drawback with diazepam induction, however, is the slow induction of sleep. Harmful drug effects on the neonates must be expected if the dose has to be increased in order to ensure sleep."
