    "0": "We evaluated the activity of the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine on differentiation and gene expression in adult neural precursor cells in vitro. Neural precursors obtained from forebrain subventricular zone (SVZ)-derived neurospheres express a subset (13/24) of receptors known to bind olanzapine at high to intermediate affinities; in contrast, all 24 are expressed in the SVZ. In the presence of 10 nM, 100 nM or 1 microM olanzapine, there is no significant change in the frequency of oligodendrocytes, neurons, GABAergic neurons and astrocytes generated from neurosphere precursors. In parallel, there is no apparent change in cell proliferation in response to olanzapine, based upon bromodeoxyuridine incorporation. There are no major changes in cytological differentiation in response to the drug; however, at one concentration (10 nM) there is a small but statistically significant increase in the size of glial fibrillary acidic protein-labeled astrocytes derived from neurosphere precursors. In addition, olanzapine apparently modulates expression of one serotonin receptor -- 5HT2A -- in differentiating neurosphere cultures; however, it does not modify expression of several other receptors or schizophrenia vulnerability genes. Thus, olanzapine has a limited influence on differentiation and gene expression in adult neural precursor cells in vitro.", 
    "1": "Clinically, portal vein embolization has been proven to be useful as a preoperative treatment for major hepatic surgeries with impaired liver function. However, its effects on the metabolism and elimination of various drugs after portal vein embolization or ligation remain to be elucidated.", 
    "2": "A portal vein branch that perfuses the central and left lobes of the liver of male Wistar rat was ligated, and changes in the weights of ligated and nonligated lobules as well as hepatic levels and activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, such as CYP3A2 and CYP2C11, were determined. To evaluate in vivo the effect of PVL on hepatic drug metabolism, the narcotic activity (sleep time) of midazolam, a specific substrate for CYP3A2, was measured.", 
    "3": "Although plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase and hepatic weight returned to basal levels at day 7 after the portal vein ligation, hepatic activities of CYP3A2 and CYP2C11 still remained low (53% and 54% of control levels, respectively), and returned to their initial levels after about day 14. The metabolism of midazolam was prolonged by approximately three times at day 7 after ligation and returned to basal levels at day 14.", 
    "4": "Because hepatic CYP-dependent drug metabolism by CYP isoforms recovered more slowly than the apparent recovery of hepatic volume and plasma alanine aminotransferase levels, the therapeutics of drugs metabolized by the CYP isoforms should be used carefully in patients who receive major hepatectomy with portal vein branch embolization.", 
    "5": "Short-term (<45 days) treatment studies in rats have reported increased oxidative stress and oxidative (i.e., oxygen free radical-mediated) neural cell injury with typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol, but not with the atypicals such as clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone. However, now these and several other atypical antipsychotics that differ in their neurotransmitter receptor affinity profiles are being used for a long-term treatment of schizophrenia. Therefore, understanding of their long-term treatment effects on the expression of antioxidant enzymes and oxidative neural cell injury in rats may be important to explain the possible differential mechanisms underlying their long-term clinical and side effects profiles. The effect of 90 and 180 day exposure to haloperidol (HAL, 2mg/kg/day), a representative typical antipsychotic was compared to exposure to chlorpromazine (CPZ, 10mg/kg/day), ziprasidone (ZIP, 12mg/kg/day), risperidone (RISP, 2.5mg/kg/day), clozapine (CLOZ, 20mg/kg/day) or olanzapine (OLZ, 10mg/kg/day) on the expression of antioxidant defense enzymes and levels of lipid peroxidation in the rat brain. The drug-induced effects on various antioxidant defense enzymes; manganese-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) and catalase (CAT) were assessed by determination of their enzymatic activity and protein content. Immunohistochemical analysis was also carried out to assess the cellular levels of MnSOD and CuZnSOD and cellular morphology. The oxidative membrane damage was assessed by determination of levels of the lipid peroxidation product, hydroxyalkanals (HAEs) in the rat brain. Both 90 and 180 days of HAL treatment very significantly decreased the levels of MnSOD (50%) and CuZnSOD (80%) and increased the levels of HAEs compared to vehicle treatment. Smaller reduction was found in CAT (25%) and no change in the glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx). The levels of enzymatic activity correlated generally well with the levels of enzyme protein indicating that the changes were in the expression of net protein. Though atypical antipsychotics like ZIP, RISP and OLZ did not show any change in the HAEs levels up to 90 days, further treatment up to 180 days resulted in significantly increased levels of HAEs in CPZ, ZIP and RISP, but not in OLZ treated rats. Post-treatment with several atypical antipsychotics (OLZ=CLOZ>RISP) for 90 days after 90 day of HAL treatment significantly restored the HAL-induced loss in MnSOD and CuZnSOD activities and increase in lipid peroxidation products as well as cellular morphology. These data may be very helpful in planning long-term use as well as switch over of these antipsychotics for the management of schizophrenia.", 
    "6": "It has been suggested that neurosteroids with agonist properties at the central GABA-A receptor are implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) in chronic liver disease. In order to address this issue, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to measure the neurosteroids pregnenolone, allopregnanolone, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) in postmortem brain tissue from controls, cirrhotic patients who died without HE, a patient who died in uremic coma, and cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma. Exposure of rat cerebral cortical membranes to brain extracts from hepatic coma patients resulted in a 53% (p < 0.001) increase in binding of [3H]muscimol, a GABA-A receptor ligand. Subsequent GC/MS analysis showed that concentrations of the GABA-A receptor agonist neurosteroid allopregnanolone were significantly increased in brain tissue from hepatic coma patients compared to patients without HE or controls (p < 0.001). Brain allopregnanolone concentrations were significantly correlated with the magnitude of induction of [3H]muscimol binding (r2 = 0.82, p < 0.0001). Concentrations of allopregnanolone comparable to those observed in hepatic coma brains are pathophysiologically relevant. Concentrations of the neurosteroid precursor pregnenolone were also increased in brain tissue from hepatic coma patients, while those of a second neurosteroid THDOC were below the levels of detection in all groups. Brain concentrations of benzodiazepine receptor ligands estimated by radioreceptor assay were not significantly increased in cirrhotic patients with or without hepatic coma. These findings suggest that increased levels of allopregnanolone rather than \"endogenous benzodiazepines\" offer a cogent explanation for the phenomenon of \"increased GABAergic tone\" previously proposed in HE.",

Psychollatine (1) was assessed for NMDA-induced seizures, MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion, amphetamine-induced lethality, and apomorphine-induced climbing behavior in mice. Psychollatine (1) (100 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.3 mg/kg) prevented NMDA-induced seizures (P < 0.01), while 1 (100 mg/kg) attenuated the MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion (P < 0.05). Compound 1 (3 and 10 mg/kg), as well as chlorpromazine (4 mg/kg), prevented amphetamine-induced lethality (P < 0.05). Finally, 1 (10 mg/kg) (P < 0.05), MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) (P < 0.01), and chlorpromazine (4 mg/kg) (P < 0.01) attenuated apomorphine-induced climbing behavior.

    "20": "The two main aetiologies of transient amnesia in the elderly are idiopathic transient global amnesia (TGA) and iatrogenic or toxic amnesia. Vascular and epileptic amnesia are less common. According to the literature, transient psychogenic amnesia, which is a frequent cause of amnesia at age 30 to 50, is very rare in the elderly. TGA is the prototypical picture of transient amnesia. It occurs more often after age 50, with no identified cause, even if some authors accept emotional stress or minor head trauma as occasional precipitants. The mechanism of TGA remains a matter of discussion. It may be the consequence of a spreading depression similar to that described in migraine with aura, but other arguments support an ischemic mechanism. Iatrogenic amnesias are mainly caused by benzodiazepines (BZs) or anticholinergics. The former may occur in a non-anxious subject, who is not a usual consumer of BZ and takes a single dose. The latter are more often due to a hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, in particular in patients presenting with a covert, incipient Alzheimer's disease. A vascular origin must be considered when amnesia is accompanied by other neurological symptoms, and when the regression of the amnesic disorder is slow, lasting several days. It results from lesions involving various mechanisms and locations, mainly subcortical. Partial seizures, most often mesio-temporal, more rarely frontal, may be the cause of transient amnesia in the elderly, in the absence of a past history of epilepsy. The red flag supportive of an epileptic origin is the repetition of stereotyped amnesic episodes. EEG demonstration of seizures may be difficult and the response to antiepileptic drugs effective on partial seizures is usually good.",

The effects of scopolamine on emotion-recognition are similar to those found in Huntington's disease patients. Furthermore, the impairments in anger and fear recognition previously observed with diazepam do not appear to be a general property of benzodiazepines. This suggests that alterations in emotional processing involving changes in the ability to recognize threat-related emotions (particularly, fear and anger) may not be a principal mechanism underlying anxiolysis or paradoxical aggression seen with benzodiazepines.",

    "43": "GABAA receptors (GABARs) are heteromultimeric proteins composed of five subunits. The specific subunit composition determines critical properties of a GABAR such as pharmacological sensitivities and whether the receptor contributes to synaptic or extrasynaptic forms of inhibition. Classically, synaptic but not extrasynaptic GABARs are thought to respond to benzodiazepines, whereas the reverse has been suggested for ethanol. To examine the effects of subunit composition on GABAR function in situ, we took advantage of two naturally occurring alleles of the rat gene for GABAR subunit alpha6 (Gabra6(100R) and Gabra6(100Q)). Depending on their subunit partners, these two variants of alpha6 can lead to differential sensitivities to benzodiazepines and ethanol. An examination of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA-mediated currents in cerebellar granule cells from Gabra6(100R/100R) and Gabra6(100Q/100Q) rats uncovered marked allele-dependent differences in benzodiazepine sensitivity. Unexpectedly, we found that the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and diazepam enhanced extrasynaptic inhibition mediated by delta subunit-containing GABARs in Gabra6(100Q/100Q) rats. Complementary experiments on recombinant GABARs confirmed that, at subsaturating [GABA], flunitrazepam potentiates alpha6/delta subunit-containing GABARs. Based on data and a simple theoretical analysis, we estimate that the average extrasynaptic [GABA] is approximately 160 nm in perfused slices. These results (1) demonstrate contributions of alpha6 subunits to both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA responses, (2) establish that delta subunit-containing GABARs are benzodiazepine sensitive at subsaturating [GABA] and, (3) provide an empirical estimate of extrasynaptic [GABA] in slices.", 
    "44": "We used a rodent model of cuprizone-induced demyelination to examine the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) response during remyelination. C57BL/6J mice were fed a 0.2% cuprizone-containing or control diet for 3 weeks and then removed to allow for remyelination. Quantitative autoradiography of 3H-(R)-PK11195 binding to PBR in the corpus callosum showed increased levels at 3 weeks of demyelination and gradually decreased as a function of remyelination. PBR levels were associated with the degree of remyelination and activation of microglia and astrocytes. However, the temporal pattern suggests that the PBR signal during the late stages of remyelination was primarily associated with astrocytes. We also used small-animal positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging to determine if this technique could be used to monitor PBR levels in the brain of living mice. The results indicate that 11C-(R)-PK11195 levels are significantly elevated in the mouse brain during cuprizone-induced demyelination and normalize at a time in which remyelination is complete. These findings support the notion that PBR is a sensitive marker for the visualization and quantification of brain injury and recovery. Further, the in vivo imaging of the PBR response is now possible in the living rodent brain.",

Following electrospray ionization, the analytes were quantified in the single ion storage mode. The assay was validated according to current acceptance criteria for bioanalytical method validation. It was proved to be linear from 0.7 to 200 ng/ml plasma for buprenorphine, 1.0 to 200 ng/ml for norbuprenorphine, 2.0 to 200 ng/ml for nordiazepam, and from 5.0 to 200 ng/ml for oxazepam.

The majority of these juvenile cases are being misdiagnosed, and/or do not come to clinical attention. Awareness of early-onset panic disorder, as well as a more precise definition of early signs and possible clinical subtypes, can favour timely diagnosis and treatment, reduce clinical impairment and improve the prognosis of these patients. In the context of a multimodal approach, pharmacological treatment can be helpful. This review focuses on the empirical evidence of pharmacotherapy in early-onset panic disorder, including selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines and tricyclics.

Practical guidelines for the management of these patients are provided, including treatment of the most frequent psychiatric comorbidities.", 
    "48": "This review is focused on aggressive behavior in adult patients with major mental disorders. Aggression, agitation, and hostility are defined. The roles of intramuscular forms of ziprasidone and olanzapine in the treatment of acute agitation and aggression are discussed. We review general considerations pertaining to persistent aggression in inpatients and outpatients, including comorbidity of major mental disorders with substance use disorders and personality disorders. The role of clozapine as an antiaggressive agent is well established, particularly in inpatients. Evidence also exists for the efficacy of risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, and aripiprazole. Anticonvulsants and lithium are widely used with the intent to control aggression, but their efficacy lacks strong evidential support. Benzodiazepines have a role in controlling acute agitation, but their long-term use for persistent aggression is not recommended. There is evidence for antiaggressive effects of SSRIs and hormonal agents with antiandrogenic properties. Beta-adrenergic blockers and electroconvulstive treatment are rarely used in clinical practice to control aggression, but they may be effective. The heterogeneity of aggressive behavior is a challenge for developing rational treatments. Emerging genetic findings hold a promise of future treatments of aggressive behavior developed on the basis of individual patients' genotypes.", 
    "49": "Antipsychotic agents have long had a place in the clinical treatment of bipolar disorder, in both acute and maintenance phases. Recent clinical research conducted with the new generation of antipsychotic agents has contributed enormously to the data available on antipsychotic agents in bipolar disorder. Even now, however, the clinical trial data relates principally to the short-term treatment of acute mania. With the exception of recent data generated during the clinical trial programme for olanzapine, studies of maintenance treatment, conducted with antipsychotic agents, both established and newly-introduced, have generally been small and prone to methodological weakness. As a result, many important clinical questions, concerning the utility of antipsychotic agents in bipolar maintenance, can not be answered by reference to the data. Taken together, the findings of the clinical trials in bipolar maintenance, conducted with antipsychotic agents other than olanzapine, can be regarded only as tentative. As was conducted with olanzapine, larger, more rigorously designed studies are required to provide definitive evidence of efficacy in longer-term treatment. Due to the logistical complexity and expense of these sorts of study, it is likely that, for many antipsychotic agents with a potential role in long-term treatment in bipolar disorder, the definitive studies will never be undertaken.", 
    "50": "This review describes the pharmacological characteristics of olanzapine (ZYPREXA), outlines the European licensed indications and examines four peer reviewed, randomized, controlled, double blind clinical trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine as maintenance therapy in patients with bipolar I disorder. These studies range in duration from 47 to 78 weeks and support the view that olanzapine is an effective and well-tolerated pharmacological therapy for relapse prevention in bipolar disorder. Evidence is presented that olanzapine is effective in preventing relapse following an index manic or a mixed episode with or without psychotic features and in patients with a history of rapid cycling. The safety and tolerability of the medicine is also examined, focusing on weight gain and metabolic issues.", 
    "51": "Varying levels of pharmaceuticals, including salicylate, ibuprofen, and acetaminophen, have been reported in the aquatic environment, but few studies have actually addressed the impact of these drugs on aquatic organisms. We tested the hypothesis that these pharmaceuticals are endocrine disruptors in fish by examining their impact on interrenal corticosteroidogenesis in rainbow trout. Indeed, acute adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-mediated cortisol production in trout interrenal cells in vitro was significantly depressed (20-40%) by these pharmaceutical drugs. Furthermore, we investigated whether this interrenal dysfunction involved inhibition of the steroidogenic capacity in rainbow trout. To this end, we fed trout salicylate-laced feed (100 mg/kg body weight) for 3 days and assessed the transcript levels of key proteins involved in corticosteroidogenesis, including steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), cytochrome P450 cholesterol side chain cleavage (P450scc), and 11beta-hydroxylase. Salicylate treatment did not affect the resting plasma cortisol or glucose levels, whereas the acute ACTH-stimulated cortisol production was significantly depressed in the interrenal tissue. This disruption of steroidogenesis by salicylate corresponded to a significant drop in the gene expression of StAR and PBR, but not P450scc or 11beta-hydroxylase, compared to the sham-treated fish. Also, brain glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein content and not GR mRNA level was significantly reduced by salicylate. Taken together, salicylate is a corticosteroid disruptor in trout and the targets include the key rate-limiting step in interrenal steroidogenesis and brain glucocorticoid signaling.", 
    "52": "Body weight gain is a worrying side effect of many new antipsychotic drugs. The mechanisms by which antipsychotic drugs increase weight in humans are not known. Attempts to model the metabolic effects of antipsychotic drugs in the animal have not been successful. Female rats appear to be sensitive to the effects of antipsychotics, but male rats less, and this does not match the clinical situation in humans. In previous rodent studies, antipsychotics were always given by daily gavage or injections. Antipsychotics have different pharmacokinetics in rodents and humans, and in the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the insensitivity of male rats to the effects of antipsychotics could be related to their mode of administration. Thus, we administered antipsychotic drugs mixed with the food. Animals were treated during 6 weeks with haloperidol (1mg/kg), olanzapine (1mg/kg), ziprasidone (10mg/kg), or a control solution. Animals were allowed to self-select food among three macronutrients (carbohydrates, lipids and proteins). Food selection was measured throughout the study. At the end of the study, body composition was measured by dissection and weighing of the rat's main organs and tissues. Mitochondrial thermogenesis was measured in brown adipose tissue in olanzapine-treated animals. Circulating leptin, insulin, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were also assayed at the end of the study. The results show that none of the antipsychotic treatments modified caloric intake, food selection or body weight. Olanzapine did not alter mitochondrial thermogenesis. However, haloperidol and olanzapine induced a significant increase in adiposity and circulating leptin. Ziprasidone produced a moderate fat accumulation. It is concluded that mixing antipsychotic treatments with the food provides a reliable animal model of antipsychotic-induced fat accumulation.", 
    "53": "It has been suggested that ammonia-induced enhancement of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in the brain is involved in the development of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This hypothesis is based on animal experiments and studies of post-mortem human brains using radiolabelled PK11195, a specific ligand for PBR, but to our knowledge has not been tested in living patients. The aim of the present study was to test this hypothesis by measuring the number of cerebral PBRs in specific brain regions in cirrhotic patients with an acute episode of clinically manifest HE and healthy subjects using dynamic (11)C-PK11195 brain PET.", 
    "54": "Eight cirrhotic patients with an acute episode of clinically manifest HE (mean arterial ammonia 81 micromol/l) and five healthy subjects (22 micromol/l) underwent dynamic (11)C-PK11195 and (15)O-H(2)O PET, co-registered with MR images. Brain regions (putamen, cerebellum, cortex and thalamus) were delineated on co-registered (15)O-H(2) (15)O and MR images and copied to the dynamic (15)O-H(2)O and (11)C-PK11195 images. Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) ((15)O-H(2)O scan) and the volume of distribution of PK11195 ((11)C-PK11195 scan) were calculated by kinetic analysis.", 
    "55": "There were regional differences in the CBF, with lowest values in the cortex and highest values in the putamen in both groups of subjects (p<0.05), but no significant differences between the groups. There were no significant differences in the volume of distribution of PK11195 (V (d)) between regions or between the two groups of subjects. Mean values of V (d) ranged from 1.0 to 1.1 in both groups of subjects.", 
    "56": "The results do not confirm the hypothesis of an increased number of PBRs in patients with HE.", 
    "57": "With the increasing application of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission imaging, there has been an evolving appreciation for the range of normal variants and the realization that false-positives can lead to serious consequences.", 
    "58": "One of the most common causes of a false-positive study is the uptake of FDG in areas of hypermetabolic brown adipose tissue (HBAT). Areas of involvement are often spatially closely related to important lymph node groups in the neck, axilla, and upper mediastinum, making critical differentiation difficult, even with PET-CT.", 
    "59": "FDG uptake in HBAT has been noted to occur more frequently in cold months and benzodiazepines have been proposed for its prevention. The use of these drugs is, in our experience, of limited value and may complicate patient care in both inpatient and outpatient populations. In this report, we describe considerable success by completely reversing HBAT in 9 of 10 sequential patients with simple core warming maneuvers, which obviate the use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "60": "Delusional parasitosis is a rare disorder in which patients have a fixed, false belief of being infested with parasites. It is often accompanied by a refusal to seek psychiatric care. Delusions of parasitosis is classically treated with typical antipsychotic agents, the traditional dermatologic choice being pimozide. However, pimozide's adverse effect profile and the need for frequent electrocardiographic monitoring make such treatment less practical.", 
    "61": "We describe 3 patients who were diagnosed as having delusional parasitosis that was successfully treated with a recently Food and Drug Administration-approved atypical antipsychotic agent, olanzapine (5 mg/d). Olanzapine has a more benign adverse effect profile than typical antipsychotic agents and eliminates the need for electrocardiographic monitoring. Olanzapine therapy has been associated with such adverse effects as sedation, hyperlipidemia, weight gain, and insulin resistance, all of which were infrequent in our patients.", 
    "62": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent that can be used as a first-line agent in delusional parasitosis as a safer therapeutic option without a specialized monitoring regimen.", 
    "63": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic of the thienobenzodiazepine class, has been on the market since 1996. Its popularity has increased over recent years because of excellent clinical results as well as a favourable side effect profile. Mirroring this increased olanzapine use has been a rise in the number of non-accidental overdoses. The clinical picture of olanzapine overdose can be surprisingly variable. In the case presented, the patient's low Glasgow Coma Score prevented an accurate history being taken. Examination revealed bilateral upgoing plantars, pinpoint pupils, increased tone, and brisk reflexes; however initial investigations, including an urgent CT head, were normal. The patient required 24 hours of intensive care before he regained consciousness and admitted to the overdose. Although there are several reports of olanzapine mimicking opiate intoxication in overdose, this is one of the first cases where overdose has mimicked an intracerebral event. The authors highlight some of the literature regarding clinical presentation and treatment options, and discuss the relation between olanzapine therapy and diabetes.", 
    "64": "Accurate assessment of medication impact requires modeling cumulative effects of exposure duration and dose; however, postmarketing studies usually represent medication exposure by baseline or current use only. We propose new methods for modeling various aspects of medication use history and employment of them to assess the adverse effects of selected benzodiazepines.", 
    "65": "Time-dependent measures of cumulative dose or duration of use, with weighting of past exposures by recency, were proposed. These measures were then included in alternative versions of the multivariable Cox model to analyze the risk of fall related injuries among the elderly new users of three benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, temazepam, and flurazepam) in Quebec. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to select the most predictive model for a given benzodiazepine.", 
    "66": "The best-fitting model included a combination of cumulative duration and current dose for temazepam, and cumulative dose for flurazepam and nitrazepam, with different weighting functions. The window of clinically relevant exposure was shorter for flurazepam than for the two other products.", 
    "67": "Careful modeling of the medication exposure history may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their adverse effects.", 
    "68": "We used calcium sensitive fluorescence microscopy to investigate the actions of PK11195, a ligand for the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), to modulate Ca2+ influx through store-operated channels (SOC) in human microglia. PK11195 effectively blocked SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx induced by platelet-activating factor (PAF) in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 of 9 microM). A prolonged SOC-mediated Ca2+ entry was also induced using the sarcoplasmic endoreticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor cyclopiazonic acid (CPA) to deplete intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores; a single concentration of PK11195 (at 20 microM) reduced SOC-mediated Ca2+ influx by 78%. RT-PCR and immunocytochemical analysis results showed PK11195 also inhibited the expression and production of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) triggered by PAF stimulation. These results suggest that activation of the PBR in mitochondria is linked to reduced entry of Ca2+ through plasmalemmal SOC and subsequent modulation of cellular functions in human microglia.",

    "70": "A retrospective chart analysis of 263 consecutive male patients undergoing intravenous (IV) sedation for dentoalveolar surgery was divided into 5 BMI groups: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, extremely obese. Data recorded were noninvasive baseline and intraoperative hemodynamic measurements at 5-minute intervals for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), and pulse (P). Statistical analysis of mean values between groups was carried out using multivariate linear regression analysis, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and Student's t test and found significant for P < .05.", 
    "71": "Average hemodynamic values for normotensive patients were significantly lower for all groups except for pulse in the normal group, pulse in the obese group, and DBP in the extremely obese group. For normotensive patients, there were statistically significant strong positive correlation for elevated BMI and increased baseline changes in SBP and PP. For the hypertensive group, there was a statistically significant moderate positive correlation for elevated BMI and increased baseline changes in PP and statistically significant strong positive correlation for baseline changes in MAP. Baseline changes were significant for greater increases in SBP and decreases in DBP and MAP in the underweight hypertensive group. Significant increases from baseline in the normotensive group were for PP in the normal BMI group and for pulse in the obese group. All baseline changes, with the exception of normotensive underweight SBP (+26.7%) and hypertensive PP (+23.9%), were within +/-20% of baseline (range, -12.2% to +17.4%).", 
    "72": "In general, normotensive patients in this study had lower average hemodynamic values than hypertensive patients in all BMI groups. Great variability was seen in baseline changes for all BMI groups, but a substantial majority of changes were within +/-20% of baseline. There were statistically significant moderate and positive correlations in BMI for changes from baseline for several hemodynamic measurements. Intravenous sedation for oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures maintains a stable hemodynamic state in hypertensive and normotensive patients regardless of BMI.", 
    "73": "We examined whether midazolam impairs short-term/working memory processes. We hypothesize that prior dissociations in midazolam's effects on short-term/working memory tasks and episodic memory tasks arise because midazolam has a larger effect on episodic memory processes than on short-term/working memory processes. To examine these issues, .03 mg/kg of participant's bodyweight of midazolam was administered in a double-blind placebo-controlled within-participant design. Performance on the digit span and category generation/recall tasks was examined. The results of Experiment 1 demonstrated that: (1) midazolam impaired performance on the digit span task; (2) midazolam did not impair performance on the category generation task; (3) midazolam impaired performance on the category recall task; and (4) midazolam's effect on category recall was four times as large as its effect on digit span. The results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that midazolam did not impair digit span performance when the digit span task was administered at a later time. These results suggest that midazolam can impair short-term/working memory processes, but these effects are substantially smaller than midazolam's effect on episodic memory processes. Moreover, they demonstrate that conscious awareness of materials during study is not sufficient to produce episodic memory.", 
    "74": "Endoscopy during pregnancy raises the unique issue of fetal safety. Endoscopic medications comprise a significant component of fetal risks from endoscopy. Before endoscopy, the gastroenterologist or anesthesiologist should evaluate the potential fetal risks of sedation and analgesia, identify any contraindications to endoscopy, stabilize the maternal medical status as necessary, and correct maternal hypoxia or hypotension. The mother should be informed about the potential teratogenic risks of endoscopic medications during pregnancy. Patients who receive sedation and analgesia should be monitored during endoscopy by continuous electrocardiography, continuous pulse oximetry, and intermittent sphygmomanometry, as well as by the pulse and respiratory rate. General principles of sedation and analgesia during pregnancy include use of the minimal effective dose, avoidance of unnecessary medications, and preferable use of Food and Drug Administration category B medications.", 
    "75": "Although atypical antipsychotics are widely used during pregnancy, their safety is not well established. This case highlights the possible teratogenic effect of olanzapine, in which the baby was born with meningocele and ankyloblepharon.

Effects of a progestin-priming regimen that enhances PR-mediated (experiment 1) or more rapid, PR-independent effects of progestins (experiments 2 and 3) on sexual behavior were examined. Levels of P, 3alpha,5alpha-THP, and muscimol binding were examined in tissues from aged mice (experiment 4).",

Mid-aged wild-type mice demonstrated greater increases in lordosis 6 h later compared to their pre-P, baseline test than did aged wild-type mice (experiment 1). Lordosis of younger and older wild-type, but not PRKO, mice was significantly increased within 5 min of intravenous (IV) administration of P (100 ng), compared with E(2)-priming alone (experiment 2). However, wild-type and PRKO mice demonstrated significant increases in lordosis 5 min after IV administration of 3alpha,5alpha-THP, an effect which was more pronounced in mid-aged than in aged animals (100 ng-experiment 3). In tissues from aged wild-type and PRKO mice, levels of P, 3alpha,5alpha-THP, and muscimol binding were increased by P administration (experiment 4).

A recently synthesized compound, L-364,373, was shown to activate I(Ks) in ventricular cells isolated from guinea pigs and rabbits. Due to the interspecies differences known to exist in the properties of the delayed rectifier K+ currents, the effect of L-364,373 on I(Ks) was studied and compared with that of another I(Ks) activator mefenamic acid in canine ventricular myocytes. Mefenamic acid (100 microM) significantly increased the amplitude of the fully activated I(Ks) current, as well as the I(Ks) current tails, by shifting the voltage dependence of its activation towards negative voltages and increased the time constant for deactivation. In contrast, L-364,373, up to concentrations of 3 microM, failed to augment I(Ks) at any membrane potential studied, but slightly increased the time constant of deactivation. It is concluded that human studies are required to evaluate the therapeutically beneficial effects of I(Ks) activators. Rodent cardiac tissues are not suitable for this purpose.",

A substantial number of overdoses occurred with no one else present and/or involved the concomitant use of other drugs. While knowledge of at least one overdose prevention strategy was reported by 90% of the sample, less then half of the sample knew any single strategy. Furthermore knowledge of the dangers of mixing benzodiazepines and/or alcohol with heroin was associated with an increased likelihood of such mixing being reported prior to overdose.", 
    "85": "While heroin users can articulate knowledge of key overdose risk reduction strategies, this knowledge was not generally associated with a reduction in risk behaviours but was in some cases associated with increased reports of overdose risk behaviours. Further research is required in order to better understand this paradoxical effect, focussing on risk reduction education amenable to the social contexts in which heroin use takes place.", 
    "86": "The current research examines the influence of midazolam (MDZ) on memory reconsolidation using a contextual fear paradigm in rats, based on three context-shock training trials (0.7 mA, 3 s). First, we evaluate the effect of MDZ (1 mg/kg, i.p.) injected shortly after the training procedure. Second, we examined the influence of MDZ after a brief exposure (90 s) either in the training context (reactivation procedure) or in a neutral environment (no reactivation procedure) and one day later, freezing behavior was scored when rats were re-exposed to the training environment. Third, we investigate both the effect of MDZ administered at different times following reactivation on fear memory and the persistence of such effect 10 days after reactivation. Finally, we test whether the MDZ effect could be reverted by a single weak training trial (0.2 mA, 3 s) or by the presentation of the same unconditioned stimulus in the absence of the conditioned stimulus as a reminder which proves to induce significant freezing in rats not previously trained. Results show that MDZ interferes with the formation of a contextual fear memory only when administered after the reactivation procedure but not after the training procedure. This interference was effective up to 60 min after reactivation and not at a later time. No spontaneous recovery of freezing behavior was observed 11 days after MDZ injection which was not reverted by a weak training trial and by the unconditioned stimulus alone. All these data support the idea that stimulating GABA A receptor sites via MDZ selectively disrupts the reconsolidation process of a contextual fear memory.",

Following administration of the 10th dose, blood was collected serially over 8 h for measurement of saquinavir plasma concentrations. Saquinavir pharmacokinetic parameter values were determined using noncompartmental methods and compared between males and females.

The patients with a significant cross-correlation between mood and sleep plus bedrest reported about two thirds of all large sleep changes of >3 h and three fourths of all large mood changes (>20 on 100-unit scale). Patients with a significant cross correlation were more likely to take benzodiazepines.",

    "108": "This study was performed to evaluate the characteristics of penile erection during midazolam-induced sedation after nocturnal sleep deprivation (NSD) and to determine the effect of NSD on erectile episodes in healthy, sexually functional young men. This procedure might possibly prove to be a brief office-based method of assessing whether erectile dysfunction is psychogenic or biogenic. Nineteen volunteers between the ages of 20 and 29 years participated in this study. We measured the morning penile erection after midazolam (3-5 mg) administration intravenously and all subjects completed 42 tests. Of 42 test, 28 tests revealed erectile episodes, whereas no erectile episodes were observed in 14 tests. Nocturnal sleep deprivation rate was significantly higher in tests with erectile episodes than in tests without erectile episode (P=0.030). Test order or duration of test was not different between two test results. Number of erectile episodes (r=0.374, P=0.015), tip radial rigidity (r=0.412, P=0.007), base radial rigidity (r=0.366, P=0.017) and tip tumescence (r=0.447, P=0.003) correlated with the degree of NSD. When we determined whether NSD was discriminative with regard to erectile episodes, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was calculated at 0.705 (95% confidence interval, 0.527-0.883; P=0.032) for the possibility of erectile episodes. Nocturnal sleep deprivation might recover the inhibited rapid eye movement sleep during midazolam-induced sedation. Our findings suggest that erection monitoring during midazolam-induced sedation after NSD may be convenient.

    "109": "Obesity is highly prevalent among patients with schizophrenia and is associated with detrimental health consequences. Although excessive consumption of fast food and pharmacotherapy with such second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs) as clozapine and olanzapine has been implicated in the schizophrenia/obesity comorbidity, the pathophysiology of this link remains unclear. Here, we propose a mechanism based on brain reward function, a relevant etiologic factor in both schizophrenia and overeating. A comprehensive literature search on neurobiology of schizophrenia and of eating behavior was performed. The collected articles were critically reviewed and relevant data were extracted and summarized within four key areas: (1) energy homeostasis, (2) food reward and hedonics, (3) reward function in schizophrenia, and (4) metabolic effects of the SGAs. A mesolimbic hyperdopaminergic state may render motivational/incentive reward system insensitive to low salience/palatability food. This, together with poor cognitive control from hypofunctional prefrontal cortex and enhanced hedonic impact of food, owing to exaggerated opioidergic drive (clinically manifested as pain insensitivity), may underlie unhealthy eating habits in patients with schizophrenia. Treatment with SGAs purportedly improves dopamine-mediated reward aspects, but at the cost of increased appetite and worsened or at least not improved opiodergic capacity. These effects can further deteriorate eating patterns. Pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of these insights need further validation via prospective clinical trials and neuroimaging studies.",

The discontinuation rate was significantly different between the treatments. The medications most frequently interrupted within one year were CLOD (28.7%; p<0.01 versus any other treatment), while by far the least interrupted was ALN-OW (6.9%; p<0.001 versus any other treatment). The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were drug related side effects, insufficient motivation to treatment and fear of side effects. The prevalence of the reasons for discontinuation were different among treatments: safety concerns were very common for HRT, lack of motivation was the most common cause for CaVitD and CLOD, and drug related side effects for RIS, ALN and RLX. Persistence to treatment was significantly higher in patients with previous vertebral fractures, densitometric osteoporosis, on corticosteroid or anti-inflammatory treatments. A significantly increased risk of treatment interruption was found among patients on benzodiazepine or gastro-protective agents and in patients in whom a bone measurement was not readily available. The highest compliance to recommended dosing was observed with ALN OW and HRT (p<0.001 versus any other) and the lowest for CaVitD (p<0.01 versus any other). Poor treatment compliance (<50% drug taken) was significantly related to benzodiazepine and gastroprotective use, while a significantly better compliance was associated with recognized risk factors for osteoporosis: early menopause, low bone mass values values, previous vertebral fractures. The poorest adherence was observed when treatments were prescribed by General practitioners (GPs), and orthopaedic surgeons (p<0.01 versus global mean).",

The main reasons for discontinuation are side effects and lack of motivation while the best treatment adherence was observed in patients with severe and well documented osteoporosis.", 
    "129": "In cortex and hippocampus, protracted (>4 weeks) social isolation of adult male mice alters the subunit expression of GABA type A receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) as follows: (i) the mRNAs encoding GABA(A)-R alpha1, alpha2, and gamma2 subunits are decreased by approximately 50%, whereas those encoding alpha4 and alpha5 subunits are increased by approximately 100%; (ii) similarly, the synaptic membrane expression of the alpha1 subunit protein is down-regulated, and that of the alpha5 subunit protein is up-regulated; and (iii) the binding of [(3)H]flumazenil to hippocampal synaptic membranes is decreased. Behaviorally, socially isolated (SI) mice are resistant to the sedative effects of the positive allosteric GABA(A)-R modulators diazepam (DZP) and zolpidem. This resistance seems to be attributable to the decrease of alpha1-containing GABA(A)-Rs. Paradoxically, DZP, which, unlike zolpidem, acts at alpha5-containing GABA(A)-Rs, increases the locomotor activity of SI mice. Imidazenil, which fails to modulate alpha1-, alpha4-, and alpha6-containing GABA(A)-Rs but is a selective positive allosteric modulator of alpha5-containing GABA(A)-Rs, also increases locomotor activity in SI mice. Importantly, SI mice responded to muscimol, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3(2H)-one, and allopregnanolone similar to group-housed mice. These data suggest that a switch (a decrease in alpha1/alpha2 and gamma2 and an increase in alpha4 and alpha5 subunits) in the composition of the heteropentameric GABA(A)-R subunit assembly without a change in total GABA(A)-R number occurs during social isolation. Thus, the repertoire of DZP and imidazenil actions in SI mice appears to be elicited by the allosteric modulation of GABA(A)-Rs overexpressing alpha5 subunits. Benzodiazepine response mediated by alpha1-containing GABA(A)-Rs is expected to be silent or reduced.", 
    "130": "Cholecystokinin (CCK), one of the most abundant neuropeptides in the brain, plays an important role in anxiogenesis through the activation of CCK receptor-2 (CCKR-2). Accumulating evidence, however, has suggested this role depends on endogenous CCKergic \"tone,\" which is largely determined by the expression level of the CCKR-2. Using the tTA/tetO-inducible transgenic (tg) approach, we show here that overexpression of the CCKR-2 in neurons of the forebrain significantly increases CCKR-2 binding capacity in tg mice compared with their littermate controls. Interestingly, these tg mice consistently exhibit increased fear responses, which are generally interpreted as anxiety-like behaviors in the rodent, in a battery of behavioral tests, which represented conflict situations or delivered stress to the subjects. The inhibition of transgene expression with doxycycline treatment completely diminished both increased receptor-binding activity and all behavioral phenotypes. Furthermore, treatment of tg mice with diazepam significantly attenuated these anxiety-like behaviors. Our results directly demonstrate that the elevated CCKergic tone via overexpression of the CCKR-2 in the brain may constitute an underlying molecular/neuronal mechanism for the expression of anxiety. In addition, our study has validated a robust genetic anxiety model in the mouse in terms of their face, constructive, and predictive validity.",

Management include ruling out all possible causes, such as physiologic compromise, physical discomfort and pain.

    "150": "Classical fear conditioning involves pairing a neutral conditional stimulus (CS) with an aversive unconditional stimulus (US). Subsequent presentation of the CS alone induces fear responses. Acquisition of conditioned fear is thought to involve learning of the CS/US association, followed by memory consolidation. Recently we reported that the N1/P2 auditory evoked potential was enhanced by fear conditioning in humans. Diazepam 10 mg, given before CS/US pairing, prevented subsequent expression of fear potentiation when the response was elicited, 1 week later, in the presence of the CS. In this experiment, we examined whether this effect of diazepam was caused by disruption of the formation of CS/US associations or by disruption of consolidation. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was used to block the effect of diazepam either during the association period or during subsequent consolidation. Forty-two male volunteers (18-35 years) participated in two sessions separated by 7 days. In Session One, they ingested diazepam 10 mg or placebo: 60 minutes later they received flumazenil 1 mg or saline intravenously (i.v.). Then they received 20 presentations of a light (CS), 50% of which terminated with electric shock (US). This was followed by a second infusion of flumazenil or saline. Subjects received placebo/saline/saline (Group 1), diazepam/saline/saline (Group 2), diazepam/flumazenil/saline (Group 3) and diazepam/saline/flumazenil (Group 4). In Session Two, the CS was presented without the US; 50% of CS presentations terminated with a sound pulse; an equal number of sound pulses were presented without the CS. Auditory evoked potentials were recorded at Cz. In Session Two, CS presentation enhanced the auditory N1/P2 potential in placebo-treated subjects (Group 1). This enhancement was prevented by diazepam (Group 2). Flumazenil reversed diazepam's effect on fear potentiation if it was administered before conditioning (Group 3), but not if it was administered afterwards (Group 4). The results confirm that diazepam prevents the acquisition of fear conditioning in humans, and suggest that it disrupts the formation of CS/US associations, rather than the consolidation of fear memory.",

    "152": "The inhalation of 7.5% carbon dioxide (CO2) in healthy subjects produces an increase in blood pressure and heart rate, and increased feelings of anxiety, fear and tension (Bailey et al. 2005). As this state is similar to that of general anxiety rather than panic, we further validated this by examining the effects of anxiolytic medication. Two separate studies in healthy volunteers are described; study one is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a single dose of 2 mg lorazepam and study two describes the effects of 21 days of treatment with paroxetine. Gas challenges were air and 7.5% CO2 inhaled for 20 minutes, delivered on day 0 (before treatment) and day 21 (after treatment) in the paroxetine study. Subjective effects were measured using visual analogue scales and questionnaires. When compared with placebo, lorazepam 2 mg significantly reduced peak CO2-induced subjective fear, feelings of wanting to leave, tension and worry. In the paroxetine study, when compared with day 0, day 21 showed a significantly attenuated peak CO2-induced nervousness and a trend for reduced ratings of anxiety, fear, feel like leaving, tense and worried. In these studies we have shown that this CO2 model of anxiety is sensitive to lorazepam and to a lesser extent paroxetine. This gives support to its utility as an experimental model of general anxiety disorder in healthy volunteers.", 
    "153": "We have shown earlier that mild electric shocks induce a lasting social avoidance in male rats. Here we investigated whether shock-induced social avoidance can be developed into a laboratory model of stress-induced anxiety. The putative new model would assess sub-chronic, stress-induced anxiety (as opposed to tests based on natural fear) in a heterologous context (as opposed to classical fear conditioning). A single exposure to mild electric shocks induced a robust social avoidance that lasted more than 5 days. Low doses of chlordiazepoxide (0.5, 1 mg/kg), diazepam (0.5, 1, 5 mg/kg), buspirone (0.3, 1 mg/kg), and fluoxetine (1, 3, 5 mg/kg) abolished this effect, whereas the anxiogenic compound m-chlorophenylpiperazine (0.5-3 mg/kg) induced social avoidance in unshocked rats. These effects were produced at doses that did not affect locomotion in the open field. Haloperidol (0.05, 0.1, 1, 5 mg/kg) influenced social avoidance at sedative doses only. The sensitivity of the model to anxiolytic agents was compromised at high (sedating) doses. Taken conjointly, these data show that shock-induced social avoidance can be used to assess the anxiolytic potential of compounds. In addition to predictive validity, the model appears to show construct and face validity as well: stress is among the etiological factors of, whereas social avoidance simulates the social deficits seen in, a variety of anxiety disorders. The model may be used to study the effects of anxiolytics on sub-chronic states of stress-induced anxiety.",

It is not known whether the massive synovial hyperplasia characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis is due to the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts or to defective apoptosis.

Here, we investigated the effect of glutamate receptor antagonists and selected antirheumatic drugs on proliferation of synoviocytes in vitro. Experiments were conducted on rabbit synoviocytes cell line HIG-82 obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Menassas, VA, USA). Cell proliferation was assessed by means of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay.

Investigations with isolated proteins pointed to serum albumin as the principal binding protein for deferasirox and its iron complex in human plasma. Competition binding experiments indicated that deferasirox at high concentrations displaced markers from the two main drug binding sites of human albumin, whereas Fe-[ICL670]2 displaced only warfarin. In the context of the pharmacokinetic properties of deferasirox and Fe-[ICL670]2, the data indicate the importance of plasma protein binding for their disposition and support a comparison of the pharmacokinetics of deferasirox and its iron complex across species. The low likelihood of clinically relevant drug displacement by deferasirox in plasma is discussed.",

Parental interview revealed he had episodes of shaking in the afternoon. Chest x-ray showed thoracic distension. Blood investigations, electrocardiogram, cardiac echography, brain CT scan and CSF were normal. Electroencephalography registered slow delta waves 2-3 cycles/min and an aspect of degraded waves and spikes. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit where he fully recovered within 48 hours. A second parental interview and clinical presentation confirmed an intoxication with a rodenticide containing alpha-chloralose. The late clinical orientation did not allow us to perform a urinanalysis.",

From a case treated in south-eastern France, whose judicial consequences were known, it seemed of interest to carry out an international study of jurisprudence concerning this type of rape. While from the medical viewpoint the drugs used are well-known and their presence can be clinically verified, the legal consequences of their use in subsequent criminal prosecution is less clear-cut. Some European countries have no jurisprudence in this area, while others consider the use of drugs as an aggravating circumstance. In France, it was only in 2003 that the first case of DFSA was truly punished by the judicial system, with considerable media attention. By contrast, in English-speaking countries, particularly the United States, the use of drugs to facilitate sexual assault has frequently been recognized in legislation and in criminal prosecutions. Prevention is fundamental and is recognised as demonstrated by campaigns in various countries.",

    "180": "Neuropeptide (NPY) Y2 receptors play an important role in some anxiety-related and stress-related behaviours in mice. Changes in the level of anxiety can affect some cognitive functions such as memory, attention and inhibitory response control. We investigated the effects of NPY Y2 receptor deletion (Y2(-/-)) in mice on visual attention and response control using the five-choice serial reaction time (5-CSRT) task in which accuracy of detection of a brief visual stimulus across five spatial locations may serve as a valid behavioural index of attentional functioning. Anticipatory and perseverative responses provide a measure of inhibitory response control. During training, the Y2(-/-) mice had lower accuracy (% correct), and made more anticipatory responses. At stimulus durations of 2 and 4s the Y2(-/-) were as accurate as the Y2(+/+) mice but still more impulsive than Y(+/+). At stimulus durations of 0.25 and 0.5s both groups performed worse but the Y2(-/-) mice made significantly fewer correct responses than the Y2(+/+) controls. The anxiolytic drug diazepam at 2mg/kg IP greatly increased the anticipatory responding of Y2(-/-) mice compared to Y2(+/+). The anxiogenic inverse benzodiazepine agonist, FG 7142, at 10mg/kg IP reduced the anticipatory responding of Y2(-/-) but not Y2(+/+) mice. These data suggest that NPY Y2 receptors make an important contribution to mechanisms controlling attentional functioning and \"impulsivity\". They also show that \"impulsivity\" of NPY Y2(-/-) mice may depend on their level of anxiety. These findings may help in understanding the pathophysiology of stress disorders and depression.", 
    "181": "An updated overview over the past decade is provided with respect to the use of clonazepam in a variety of psychiatric disorders. The efficacy of clonazepam monotherapy for the short-term treatment of panic disorder (PD) was fully established in two large pivotal multicentre studies in the late 1990s in a total of >800 patients. Other studies support a role for clonazepam, in association with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), to accelerate treatment response in PD. Although some longitudinal data suggest an ability to maintain improvement without tolerance for up to 3 years, long-term controlled studies of clonazepam in PD are lacking. Studies have shown that clonazepam can also block CO2-induced panic and improve certain aspects of quality of life in PD. Clonazepam has shown some efficacy in social phobia; however, because this evidence is based on few studies, further studies are warranted before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Finally, evidence for the use of clonazepam in acute mania and as augmentation therapy with SSRIs to accelerate response in depression is examined. The long half-life and higher potency of clonazepam may allow easier discontinuation with fewer withdrawal symptoms compared to other benzodiazepines and studies using a slow clonazepam taper appear promising.", 
    "182": "It has been shown that airway ciliary function is impaired by several anesthetic or sedative drugs, which may predispose anesthetized or intensive care patients to respiratory complications, such as hypoxemia, atelectasis and pulmonary infection.

Ketamine at a supraclinical dose (1000 microM) increased CBF (22 +/- 13, mean +/- standard deviation, % increase from baseline; baseline = 100%) significantly (P < 0.01). Fentanyl at a high clinical dose (100 nM) increased CBF significantly (10 +/- 9%). Pentobarbital decreased CBF dose-dependently (100 microM, -2 +/- 6%; 300 microM, -14 +/- 18%; 1000 microM, -75 +/- 5%) and reversibly (P < 0.01).",

The aim of the present study was to define the effects of DMED in respiratory mechanics in normal rats. In addition, lung morphometry was studied to determine whether the physiological changes reflected underlying morphological changes defining the sites of action of dexmedetomidine. Arterial blood gases were also determined. Twelve adult Wistar rats were randomly assigned to two groups of six animals each: PENTO and DMED. In PENTO group animals were sedated (diazepam, 5mg, i.p.) and anaesthetised with pentobarbital sodium (20mgkg(-1) i.p.). The rats of the DMED group received dexmedetomidine (250mugkg(-1) i.p. followed by intravenous infusion of 0.5mugkg(-1)h(-1)). In spontaneously breathing rats, minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, and neuromuscular inspiratory drive were lower in dexmedetomidine group, which also presented hypercapnia, whereas tidal volume, inspiratory, expiratory, and total respiratory cycle times were higher in dexmedetomidine group compared to the PENTO group. During mechanical ventilation, respiratory mechanical parameters were similar in both groups. These findings were supported by the absence of histological changes. In conclusion, under the conditions studied, dexmedetomidine did not change respiratory mechanical parameters and lung histology, but induced ventilatory depression.", 
    "187": "Thyroid hormones (THs) have critical roles in brain development and normal brain function in vertebrates. Clinical evidence suggests that some human nervous disorders involving GABA(gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic systems are related to thyroid dysfunction (i.e. hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism). There is experimental evidence from in vivo and in vitro studies on rats and mice indicating that THs have effects on multiple components of the GABA system. These include effects on enzyme activities responsible for synthesis and degradation of GABA, levels of glutamate and GABA, GABA release and reuptake, and GABA(A) receptor expression and function. In developing brain, hypothyroidism generally decreases enzyme activities and GABA levels whereas in adult brain, hypothyroidism generally increases enzyme activities and GABA levels. Hyperthyroidism does not always have the opposite effect. In vitro studies on adult brain have shown that THs enhance GABA release and inhibit GABA-reuptake by rapid, extranuclear actions, suggesting that presence of THs in the synapse could prolong the action of GABA after release. There are conflicting results on effects of long term changes in TH levels on GABA reuptake. Increasing and decreasing circulating TH levels experimentally in vivo alter density of GABA(A) receptor-binding sites for GABA and benzodiazepines in brain, but results vary from study to study, which may reflect important regional differences in the brain. There is substantial evidence that THs also have an extranuclear effect to inhibit GABA-stimulated Cl(-) currents by a non-competitive mechanism in vitro. The thyroid gland exhibits GABA transport mechanisms as well as enzyme activities for GABA synthesis and degradation, all of which are sensitive to thyroidal state. In rats and humans, GABA inhibits thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) release from the pituitary, possibly by action directly on the pituitary or on hypothalamic thyrotropin-releasing hormone neurons. In mice, GABA inhibits TSH-stimulated TH release from the thyroid gland. Taken together, these studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that there is reciprocal regulation of the thyroid and GABA systems in vertebrates.", 
    "188": "High-throughput screening of the Merck sample collection identified benzodiazepinone tetralin-spirohydantoin 1 as a CGRP receptor antagonist with micromolar activity. Comparing the structure of 1 with those of earlier peptide-based antagonists such as BIBN 4096 BS, a key hydrogen bond donor-acceptor pharmacophore was hypothesized. Subsequent structure activity studies supported this hypothesis and led to benzodiazepinone piperidinyldihydroquinazolinone 7, CGRP receptor K(i)=44nM and IC(50)=38nM. Compound 7 was orally bioavailabile in rats and is a lead in the development of orally bioavailable CGRP antagonists for the treatment of migraine.", 
    "189": "Talampanel is a 2,3-benzodiazepine-type allosteric (noncompetitive) AMPA-antagonist currently being developed as an orally active, broad-spectrum anticonvulsant. Here, a detailed study of its N-acetylation in humans is presented using plasma concentration data of both TLP and its N-acetyl metabolite obtained from healthy volunteers (n = 28) genotyped for N-acetyltansferase NAT2 isozymes. Plasma samples were obtained for up to 48 h after a single oral dose of 75 mg TLP both in fasted and in fed subjects. A perfect correspondence could be established between the phenotype inferred before the study from genotyping and that determined after the study by using plasma metabolite-to-parent molar ratios confirming that this route of metabolism is indeed mediated by NAT2. Analysis of the data has been performed using both noncompartmental analysis and a custom-built, unified parent-metabolite PK model, which incorporates three different acetylation rates according to the genotype-based classification of each subject as slow, intermediate, or fast acetylator to simultaneously fit plasma levels for both TLP and its metabolite. This suggest that for TLP in humans, (i) N-acetylation represents only a relatively small fraction of its total elimination (about one-fourth in fast acetylators and much less in slow acetylators), (ii) acetylation is about eight-twelve times faster in fast and three-six times faster in intermediate acetylators than in slow acetylators, and (iii) the N-acetyl metabolite is eliminated faster than the parent TLP.",

The most serious complication of neuroleptic malignant syndrome is acute renal failure. We investigated six cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with myoglobulinemic acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis and effect of hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration. The patients were five males and one female with a mean age of 43.5 yr. All of the patients, who developed acute renal failure induced from rhabdomyolysis, had previously received butyrophenone (haloperidol), phenothiazine, benzamide, iminomide, benzisoxazole, antidepressants, and hypnotics (benzodiazepine and barbiturate) for the treatment of schizophrenia. The clinical manifestations of neuroleptic malignant syndrome were characterized by altered consciousness, muscle rigidity and weakness, fever, and excessive perspiration. The peak laboratory data were blood urea nitrogen 102 +/- 26 (mean +/- SD) mg/dL, serum creatinine 9.1 +/- 2.1 mg/dL, serum creatine phosphokinase 229,720 +/- 289,940 IU/L, and all of them developed oliguric acute renal failure. Dantrolene sodium administration was given to five cases and hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration was performed in all of them. The serum creatinine level after hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration was 1.4 +/- 1.0 mg/dL. All patients were successfully cured of acute renal failure by hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration. As a result, myoglobulinemic acute renal failure associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome was successfully treated by hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration.",

The results showed that infusion of ethanol (0.47 micromol) and propofol (20 microg) in both SN and AT icrohad anticonvulsant effects (prevention of seizures or increased latency to seizures). Anticonvulsant effects were also obtained when muscimol (120 ng) was infused into AT or when diazepam (5 microg) was infused into SN. Pentobarbital (50 microg) did not attenuate soman-elicited seizures in any of the injection sites.

The objective of this study is to describe the effects of lorazepam on silent period (SP) and corticomotor excitability. Twelve healthy male subjects (median age 35 years) were studied at baseline, following i.v. lorazepam administration and after reversal of the benzodiazepine effects with i.v. flumazenil. Lorazepam was given at a low-dose in one subject (0.0225 mg/kg bolus + 2 microg/kg/h infusion) and at a high-dose (0.045 mg/kg bolus + 2.6 microg/kg/h infusion) in the rest. Threshold (Thr) was measured at 1% steps. SPs were investigated with two complementary methods. First, SPs were elicited using a wide range of stimulus intensities (SIs) (from 5 to 100% maximum SI at 5% increments). At each SI, four SPs were obtained and the average value of SP duration was used to construct a stimulus/response (S/R) curve of SI versus SP .The resulting S/R curves were then fitted to a Boltzman function, the best-fit values of which were statistically compared for each experimental condition (i.e., baseline vs. lorazepam vs. flumazenil). Second, a large number of SPs (n=100) was elicited during each of the three experimental conditions using blocks of four stimuli with an intensity alternating between MT and 200% MT. This method was employed so as to reveal the dynamic, time-varying effects of lorazepam and flumazenil on SP duration at two stimulus intensity (SI) levels. MEP recruitment curves were constructed at rest and during activation and fitted to a Boltzman function the best-fit values of which were statistically compared for each experimental condition. Lorazepam at a low dose did not affect Thr, SP, or the active MEP recruitment curves. The high dose also had no effect on Thr and the active MEPs whereas the resting MEP recruitment curves were depressed post-lorazepam at the higher range of stimulus intensities. With regard to SP, the Max value of the S/R curve decreased from 251+/-4.6 ms at baseline to 215.2+/-3.1 ms post-lorazepam (P<0.01). V50 also decreased significantly (from 47.92+/-0.9% to 43.73+/-0.81%, P<0.01) whereas there was no significant change regarding slope and SP Thr. The statistical analysis of the SP S/R curves as well as the study of SPs at two SI levels revealed that lorazepam reduced SP duration when high intensity stimuli were used (>60%). In contrast, at low SIs a small increase in SP duration was noted post-drug. Enhancement of GABAergic inhibition by lorazepam results in a reduction of SP duration when high SIs is used. At the lower range of SIs, a small but statistically significant increase in SP duration is observed. The kinetic behavior of this phenomenon as well as the possible underlying mechanisms are discussed."
