A variety of antagonists (atropine, pirenzepine, 4-DAMP and N-methyl-scopolamine) inhibited carbamyl choline-induced transient Ca2+ mobilization both in a competitive and a noncompetitive manner. The apparent noncompetitive inhibition constants were lower in IMR-32 than in SH-SY5Y cells even when the competitive inhibition constants were similar. This may relate to the previously reported differential expression of muscarinic receptor subtypes in these cell lines.", 
    "1": "Rats were treated for 5 days with vehicle or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day) and then exposed to a cloth impregnated with a neutral or cat odor. Those exposed to cat odor made significantly fewer contacts with the cloth and spent less time in contact with it and more time sheltering than those exposed to the neutral odor. CDP (5 mg/kg) significantly increased the time in contact with both odor cloths, but there were no other significant effects in the cat odor group. Rats previously exposed to cat odor showed significant anxiogenic responses in the social interaction and elevated plus-maze tests that were significantly reversed by CDP. There was no reduction in the responses to the cat odor on a second occasion as a result of the first exposure occurring after treatment with CDP (5 or 20 mg/kg). The anxiogenic effects of pentylenetetrazole (20 mg/kg) as detected in the social interaction and plus-maze tests were unaffected by prior odor experience. It is suggested that during exposure to the cat odor the responses of rats reflect avoidance components of a phobic anxiety state. Benzodiazepines are relatively ineffective against these responses in contrast to their efficacy against the generalised anxiety responses detected in the social interaction and plus-maze tests.", 
    "2": "This study was performed to test the hypothesis that sedation after recovery from pharmacologic hypnosis is less pronounced if hypnosis is induced with a midazolam-morphine combination compared with midazolam administered alone. Loss of the righting reflex was used as an index for the hypnotic effect and reduction of locomotor activity as an index for the sedative effect. One group of rats received midazolam (20 mg/kg i.v) and another group an equipotent (in relation to the hypnotic ef.fect) combination of midazolam (4 mg/kg i.v.) and morphine (1.3 mg/kg i.v.). The duration of loss of the righting reflex in the midazolam and midazolam-morphine groups was 30 +/- 3 and 28 +/- 2 min, respectively (mean +/- SE). The difference between the groups in locomotor activity after recovery from hypnosis was very pronounced. The locomotor activity in the midazolam-morphine group at 1 and 2 h was seven and five times greater, respectively, than in the midazolam group (P < 0.005). The profound difference in locomotor activity for the two treatment groups was explained on the basis of the difference in the outcomes of midazolam-morphine interactions with regard to hypnosis (synergism) and sedation (summation). When the animals recovered from hypnosis, the synergism of the drug interaction ceased to be a contributing factor.", 
    "3": "The repair of anthramycin-DNA adducts by the UVR proteins in Escherichia coli follows two pathways: the adducts may be incised by the combined actions of UVRA, UVRB, and UVRC, or alternatively, the anthramycin may be removed by UVRA and UVRB in the absence of UVRC and with no DNA strand incision. To assess the competition between these two competing pathways, the rate of UVRABC-mediated excision repair of anthramycin-N2-guanine DNA adducts and the rate of UVRAB-mediated removal of the adduct were measured with single end-labeled DNAs under identical reaction conditions. UVR protein concentrations of 15 nM UVRA, 100 nM UVRB, and 10 nM UVRC protein were chosen to mimic in vivo concentrations. With these UVR protein concentrations and anthramycin-DNA concentrations of 1-2 nM the incision reaction and the release reactions are described by first-order kinetics. The rate of the UVRABC reaction, measured as the increase in incised fragments, was six to seven times faster than the rate of the UVRAB reaction, measured as the decrease in incised fragments. The UVRABC incision rate on anthramycin-modified linear DNA was four to five times the incision rate measured on the same DNA irradiated with ultraviolet light. We also investigated the role of the ATPase function of UVRB in UVRAB-mediated anthramycin removal. We found that a UVRB analogue with alanine at arginine 51, which retains near wild type ATPase activity, supported removal of anthramycin in the presence of UVRA, whereas a UVRB analogue with alanine at lysine 45, which abolishes the ATPase activity, did not. UVRB*, a specific proteolytic cleavage product of UVRB which retains the ATPase activity, did support removal of anthramycin in the presence of UVRA.", 
    "4": "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone, TRH (< Glu-His-Proamide), and [N tau-Me-His]TRH (MeTRH) are present as neutral and positively charged forms at physiologic pH, and it was possible that they bind to the TRH receptor (TRH-R) as charged (protonated) species. Binding affinities of TRH and MeTRH to endogenous rat TRH-Rs and to transfected wild type mouse TRH-Rs decreased below pH 7.1. Half-maximal decreases in binding occurred at the approximate pK alpha values of these ligands. Asp to Ala mutations in extracellular loop 1, TM-4, and TM-5 did not decrease binding affinity, but an Asp to Ala mutation in TM-2 caused the affinity to decrease 8-fold. The pH dependences of binding of MeTRH, however, were similar in wild type and all mutant receptors and were consistent with the protonated form of MeTRH binding less well. Thus, the binding of TRH to its receptor does not involve ionic interactions and may be a prototype for binding of neutral peptide ligands to G protein-coupled receptors.", 
    "5": "An isocratic high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with ultraviolet detection is described for the quantification of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine and its major metabolites, N-desmethylclozapine and clozapine N-oxide, in human serum or plasma. The method included automated solid-phase extraction on C18 reversed-phase material. Clozapine and its metabolites were separated by HPLC on a C18 ODS Hypersil analytical column (5 microns particle size; 250 mm x 4.6 mm I.D.) using an acetonitrile-water (40:60, v/v) eluent buffered with 0.4% (v/v) N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine and acetic acid to pH 6.5. Imipramine served as internal standard. After extraction of 1 ml of serum or plasma, as little as 5 ng/ml of clozapine and 10 or 20 ng/ml of the metabolites were detectable. Linearity was found for drug concentrations between 5 and 2000 ng/ml as indicated by correlation coefficients of 0.998 to 0.985. The intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation ranged between 1 and 20%. Interferences with other psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants or neuroleptics were negligible. In all samples, collected from schizophrenic patients who had been treated with daily oral doses of 75-400 mg of clozapine, the drug and its major metabolite, N-desmethylclozapine, could be detected, while the concentrations of clozapine N-oxide were below 20 ng/ml in three of sixteen patients. Using the method described here, data regarding relations between therapeutic or toxic effects and drug blood levels or metabolism may be collected in clinical practice to improve the therapeutic efficacy of clozapine drug treatment.", 
    "6": "Caffeine and other methylxanthines induce a dose-dependent reduction in core body temperature in mice. These experiments investigated the effects of neurotransmitter and neuromodulator antagonists on caffeine-induced hypothermia. Pretreatment with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole; the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol; the dopamine antagonist, haloperidol; or the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil had no intrinsic effects on core body temperature nor did they interact significantly with the hypothermic effects of caffeine. The alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin and the 5-HT receptor antagonist, metergoline significantly enhanced the hypothermic effects of caffeine, probably involving a combined effect with their intrinsic hypothermic actions. Pretreatment with the opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone (3 mg/kg i.p.), had no intrinsic effect on core body temperature but attenuated the hypothermic effect of caffeine reflected in a parallel shift to the right in the caffeine dose-effect curve. The naloxone-induced attenuation of the hypothermic effects of caffeine was also seen to be dose-dependent. The results reveal that opiate receptors (but not adrenoceptors, 5-HT, dopamine or benzodiazepine receptors) may play a role in modulating the hypothermic action of caffeine and possibly other methylxanthines.", 
    "7": "Modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor function by drugs such as ethanol may depend on the genetic heterogeneity of GABAA receptor subunits, which vary across species and cell types. For this reason, the effects of ethanol on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-activated chloride currents (IGABA) were examined using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in primary cultures of neurons obtained from different species (chick, mouse and rat) and from different brain regions (cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and spinal cord), and in acutely dissociated neurons from rat neocortical slices. Low concentrations (1-50 mM) of ethanol produced an enhancement of IGABA in some cells from each brain region examined. In cells obtained from the rat and chick cerebral cortex, 40-58% of cells exhibited an ethanol-sensitive IGABA. Moreover, a statistically significant variation in the response to ethanol was found in rat cortical neurons obtained from different litters. In mouse hippocampal neurons, potentiation of IGABA was obtained with ethanol concentrations (1-10 mM) well below those needed to inhibit neuronal responses to N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (30-50 mM), suggesting a differential sensitivity of these two receptor mechanisms to ethanol. Potentiation of IGABA by ethanol was reversed by the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist RO15-4513 (ethyl 8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine - 3-carboxylate), but was not affected by chelation of intracellular calcium. Furthermore, high concentrations of GABA attenuated the ability of ethanol to enhance IGABA. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol facilitates coupling between receptor binding and chloride channel activation.", 
    "8": "After a description of the harmful effects of psychotropic drugs as well as of the moments of vulnerability to any teratogenic effect, this paper reviews prospective, retrospective and epidemiological studies of the teratogenic effects of anticonvulsants (phenytoin, valproic acid, carbamazepine and barbiturates), lithium, anti-psychotics, benzodiazepines and anti-depressive agents. It is found that the results of these studies are not unequivocal. Only lithium and valproic acid are shown to be teratogenic. In cases where malformations of the fetus are observed, the treatment often consisted in a combination of various psychotropic drugs. The review is completed with data on the psychopharmacological problems during delivery and their side-effects on the newborn.", 
    "9": "Highly steroidogenic granulosa cell lines were established by transfection of primary granulosa cells from preovulatory follicles with SV40 DNA and Ha-ras oncogene. Progesterone production in these cells was enhanced to levels comparable to normal steroidogenic cells, by prolonged (> 12 h) stimulation with 8-Br-cAMP, forskolin and cholera toxin, which elevate intracellular cAMP. The steroidogenic capacity of individual lines correlated with the expression of the ras oncogene product (p21) and the morphology of the cells. Formation of the steroid hormones was associated with de novo synthesis of the mitochondrial cytochrome P450scc system proteins. Since cholesterol import into mitochondria is essential for steroidogenesis, the expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and the sterol carrier protein 2 was characterized in these cells. The induction of the expression of the genes coding for both proteins appeared to be mediated, at least in part, by cAMP. Stimulation of the PBR by specific agonists enhanced progesterone production in these cells. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA) dramatically suppressed the cAMP-induced steroidogenesis, in spite of enhanced intracellular cAMP levels, suggesting that TPA can modify the effects of cAMP. cAMP stimulation suppressed growth of transformed cells concomitantly with induction of steroidogenesis. The transformed cells lacked receptors for the native stimulants, the gonadotropic hormones. After transfection of the cells with a lutropin (LH) receptor expression plasmid, the LH and hCG response was reconstituted. In these newly established cell lines gonadotropins were able to stimulate the formation of cAMP and progesterone in a dose-dependent manner with an ED\u2085\u2080 characteristic of the native receptor. High doses caused desensitization to gonadotropins as observed in normal cells. These newly established oncogene-transformed granulosa cell lines can serve as a useful model to study inducible steroidogenesis and the effect of oncogene expression on this process.", 
    "10": "Transfer of cholesterol to cytochrome P450scc is generally the rate-limiting step in steroid synthesis. Depending on the steroidogenic cell, cholesterol is supplied from low or high density lipoproteins (LDL or HDL) or de novo synthesis. ACTH and gonadotropins stimulate this cholesterol transfer prior to activation of gene transcription, both through increasing the availability of cytosolic free cholesterol and through enhanced cholesterol transfer between the outer and inner mitochondrial membranes. Cytosolic free cholesterol from LDL or HDL is primarily increased through enhanced cholesterol ester hydrolysis and suppressed esterification, but increased de novo synthesis can be significant. Elements of the cytoskeleton, probably in conjunction with sterol carrier protein(2) (SCP(2)), mediate cholesterol transfer to the mitochondrial outer membranes. Several factors contribute to the transfer of cholesterol between mitochondrial membranes; steroidogenesis activator peptide acts synergistically with GTP and is supplemented by SCP(2). 5-Hydroperoxyeicosatrienoic acid, endozepine (at peripheral benzodiazepine receptors), and rapid changes in outer membrane phospholipid content may also contribute stimulatory effects at this step. It is suggested that hormonal activation, through these factors, alters membrane structure around mitochondrial intermembrane contact sites, which also function to transfer ADP, phospholipids, and proteins to the inner mitochondria. Cholesterol transfer may occur following a labile fusion of inner and outer membranes, stimulated through involvement of cardiolipin and phosphatidylethanolamine in hexagonal phase membrane domains. Ligand binding to benzodiazepine receptors and the mitochondrial uptake of 37 kDa phosphoproteins that uniquely characterize steroidogenic mitochondria could possibly facilitate these changes. ACTH activation of rat adrenals increases the susceptibility of mitochondrial outer membranes to digitonin solubilization, suggesting increased cholesterol availability. Proteins associated with contact sites were not solubilized, indicating that this part of the outer membrane is resistant to this treatment. Two pools of reactive cholesterol within adrenal mitochondria have been distinguished by different isocitrate- and succinate-supported metabolism. These pools appear to be differentially affected in vitro by the above stimulatory factors.", 
    "11": "A sensitive spectrophotometric procedure is described for the determination of 1,4-benzodiazepine (clorazepate dipotassium) in the presence of its degradation products. The procedure is based on acid hydrolysis of clorazepate dipotassium to yield its final degradation products viz., 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone and glycine. The amino-chlorobenzophrenone is extracted from the neutralized hydrolysate with diethyl ether, the extract is evaporated, the residue is dissolved in methanol and its absorbance measured at about 240 nm or 380 nm. Glycine, left in the aqueous layer after etherial extraction of aminochlorobenzophenone, is treated with ninhydrin reagent in the presence of pyridine and the bluish violet colour formed is measured at about 560 nm. The suggested procedures determine 20-100 mg of clorazepate dipotassium via its degradation products aminochlorobenzophenone and glycine with mean accuracies of 100.0 +/- 0.5% at 560 nm, 100.2 +/- 0.6% at 380 nm and 99.8 +/- 0.5%. The suggested procedures are suitable for stability-testing of clorazepate dipotassium in bulk powder and in pharmaceutical preparations.", 
    "12": "A series of 5 generalized tonic-clonic seizures within 30 min was induced by repeated transauricular electrical stimulation in mice. In this model, the anticonvulsant potency of intravenous valproate was compared with diazepam and phenytoin. All 3 drugs proved capable of rapidly suppressing the seizures after intravenous bolus injection. Potent anticonvulsant activity of diazepam and valproate was already obtained after 30 s, while phenytoin's onset of action was somewhat slower. In contrast to diazepam, valproate and phenytoin suppressed the seizures at non-sedative doses. ED50s for blockade of generalized tonic-clonic seizures throughout the 30-min period of repeated electrical stimulation were 6.6 mg/kg for diazepam, 28 mg/kg for phenytoin and 212 mg/kg for valproate. Determination of valproate in plasma and brain demonstrated that the rapid onset of anticonvulsant action after intravenous bolus injection was related to rapid drug penetration into brain tissue. The data indicate that an intravenous formulation of valproate might be a useful alternative to phenytoin as a non-sedative anticonvulsant for diazepam-resistant status epilepticus.", 
    "13": "The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the alterations of flexor reflex parameters in spasticity and the possibilities to take advantage of them as a method for assessment of common interneurone activity. Clinical and electromyographical examinations were performed on 120 patients with spastic hemiparesis after stroke. The flexor reflex was obtained after supramaximal electrostimulation of the tibial nerve behind the ankle. The stimulus consisted of 50 msec train of 1 msec duration pulses given at 100 Hz. The reflex activity was recorded from the tibialis anterior muscle. As all patients were with hemiparesis the healthy side was used as a control. The patients were subdivided into four groups, each treated with different myorelaxants (Baclofen, Sirdalud, Myolastan and electroacupuncture). After about 25 days treatment the clinical and electromyographic examinations were repeated. The flexor reflex was recorded with two clearly distinguishable responses on the healthy, as well as on the spastic side. On the spastic side a reflex with prolonged latencies and durations, as well as with decreased amplitudes and thresholds of both reflex responses was found. On the spastic side the first reflex response had higher threshold than the second one, while on the healthy side it was vice versa. Moderate correlations were found between most of the reflex parameters. No correlations were found between the reflex parameters and the degree of spasticity. Only after Baclofen treatment all reflex parameters tended to normalized. After treatment with Myolastan, Sirdalud and electroacupuncture only the second response's duration shortened. In conclusion the flexor reflex is a sensitive method for assessment of altered common interneurone activity in spasticity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Principals and trainees in general practice attending training events were asked to give information about their prescribing of drugs, with a focus on the prescribing of benzodiazepines for psychological problems. High prescribers of benzodiazepines believed that a prescription saved consultation time, tended to be influenced by drug company information and believed that patients expected a prescription. Low prescribers of benzodiazepines did not prescribe for bereavement, wished to have more psychological expertise and offered treatments other than drugs. Doctors classified as empathic from their statements at interview found difficulty in ending consultations and thought that social problems should be part of the general practitioner's work, although there were no differences between empathic and unsympathetic doctors in overall prescribing rates of benzodiazepines. The data suggest that doctors who are emphatic towards their patients would prescribe less if they had training in psychological skills.", 
    "15": "Fourteen days administration of haloperidol (1 mg/kg daily) prevented the motor depressant effect of caerulein (an agonist at cholecystokinin receptors, 15 micrograms/kg) and the antagonistic effect of caerulein (100 micrograms/kg) against (+)-amphetamine (5 mg/kg) induced hyperlocomotion in mice. The antiaggressive effect of caerulein (40 micrograms/kg) in saline-treated mice was replaced by increased aggressiveness after long-term haloperidol and diazepam (5 mg/kg daily) treatment. The anticonvulsant effect of caerulein (125 micrograms/kg) against picrotoxin (10 mg/kg) induced seizures was abolished after 14 days diazepam, but not after haloperidol, treatment. The above described changes in the mouse behaviour are probably related to the development of subsensitivity at CCKA receptors, whereas the CCKB receptor subtype becomes more sensitized to the action of caerulein after long-term haloperidol and diazepam treatment.", 
    "16": "Analgesia and sedation with the associated reduction of undesired vegetative reactions are important components in the therapeutic regimen of intensive care patients. None of the sedative drugs available can fulfil every one of the criteria expected of an \"ideal\" sedative. Four commonly used drug combinations have been established as standards: 1. opioid and neuroleptic, 2. opioid and benzodiazepine, 3. ketamine and benzodiazepine, and 4. opioid and propofol. In everyday use one must take not only the specific side-effects of a drug into consideration but also its pharmacokinetic properties. These are often markedly altered in critically ill patients who have impaired functions of vital organs. The pharmacokinetics of a drug is affected by disturbed renal or hepatic function, interactions with other drugs, altered protein binding and the induction or inhibition of metabolic enzymes. The best method of drug administration is by motor-driven pump, with which large fluctuations of the dosage can be avoided. Constant ratios of drug combinations are not recommended, since the pharmacokinetics of each drug is affected to a different degree in the critically ill patient. Withdrawal symptoms, can occur for example after prolonged administration of benzodiazepines, can often be avoided by slowly reducing the dose or by switching to a short-acting substance. In some patients (e.g. those with a history of alcohol abuse) a massive increase of the drug dose is not indicated when the effect is not adequate. Instead, an entirely different substance should be employed and the administration of less frequently used drugs should be considered. Despite detailed knowledge of the altered pharmacokinetics in critically ill patients, the drugs should be dosed as dictated by the situation, true to the anaesthesiologists' adage: \"Dosage according to effect!\"", 
    "17": "The ligand binding pocket of many G protein-coupled receptors is thought to be located within the core formed by their seven transmembrane domains (TMDs). Previous results suggested that muscarinic antagonists bind to a pocket located toward the extracellular region of the TMDs, primarily at TMDs 2, 3, 6, and 7. Tyrosine-82 (Y82) is located in TMD2 only one helical turn from the presumed membrane surface of Hm1, whereas a phenylalanine (F124) is found in the equivalent position of the closely related Hm3. In order to determine the contribution of Y82 to Hm1 ligand binding and selectivity versus Hm3, we constructed the point mutation Y82 F of Hm1 and measured binding affinities of various ligands, with 3H-N-methylscopolamine (3H-NMS) as the tracer. The Hm1 wild-type receptor and the Y82F mutant were transfected into human embryonic kidney U293 cells. Whereas the affinities of NMS, carbachol, and atropine were either unchanged (carbachol) or enhanced by less than twofold (atropine and NMS), the affinity of the Hm1-selective pirenzepine was reduced threefold by the Y82F mutation. These changes parallel affinity differences of Hm1 and Hm3, indicating that the Y82 F mutation affects the binding pocket and that Y82 contributes to the binding selectivity among closely related muscarinic receptors.", 
    "18": "The pharmacokinetics of midazolam were investigated following intravenous and intramuscular administration of 0.5 mg of midazolam hydrochloride/kg of body weight to five healthy mixed-breed dogs. One dog also received the same dose of midazolam by oral and rectal routes. The disposition of midazolam following intravenous administration was characterized by very rapid and relatively extensive distribution followed by rapid elimination. Mean (+/- SD) apparent volume of distribution was 3.0 +/- 0.9 l/kg, mean elimination half-life was 77 +/- 18 min, and clearance was 27 +/- 3 ml/kg/min. Following intramuscular administration, absorption was rapid and complete. A mean peak midazolam concentration of 549 +/- 121 ng/ml was reached within 15 min, and systemic availability was over 90% in each dog. Oral administration to one dog resulted in peak midazolam concentrations within 10 min and a systemic availability of 69%. Rectal administration to the same dog yielded very low systemic availability. Midazolam was extensively bound to canine plasma proteins, with the unbound fraction representing less than 4% of the total plasma midazolam concentration. Plasma samples were also assayed for the presence of the major metabolites, 1-OH and 4-OH midazolam. Neither metabolite were detected, probably as a result of rapid elimination of these compounds by hepatic glucuronidation. Behavioral responses to administration of midazolam included initial signs of profound weakness, ataxia and transient agitation followed by a period of quiesence. A normal behavior pattern returned within 2 h of midazolam administration.", 
    "19": "In the past 18 months, there has been considerable controversy regarding the benzodiazepine triazolam (Halcion). To review data supporting or not supporting the assertion that treatment with triazolam results in adverse reactions more frequently than with other benzodiazepines, the author used computerized literature searches (MEDLINE, English language articles from 1975 to the present) to identify reports of behavioral disinhibition, amnesia, delirium, rebound insomnia, and withdrawal reactions on benzodiazepines. Studies of disinhibitory reactions during benzodiazepine treatment do not substantiate the argument that they are more prevalent with triazolam than with other benzodiazepines. The behavioral disinhibition reactions during treatment with benzodiazepines are associated with higher dosages and pretreatment level of hostility. Anterograde amnesia occurs with many benzodiazepines, but usually without changes in a person's normal activities and behaviors. The reports of anterograde amnesia during benzodiazepine treatment describe people performing rather complex tasks during which outside observers could not detect any unusual behaviors. The prevalence of delirium during treatment with triazolam and other benzodiazepines is unclear, but delirium is more frequent at higher dosages and in the elderly. Controlled studies regarding the adverse effects of triazolam on sleep are lacking. The author concludes that despite the considerable adverse publicity in the lay press, there is little scientific evidence that triazolam is associated with disinhibitory or other adverse reactions at a greater frequency than other benzodiazepines.", 
    "20": "Insomnia is a highly prevalent problem occurring in about 35% of the adult population. The complaint can be divided into temporary insomnia and persistent insomnia. A 1983 NIMH/OMAR Consensus Development Conference on drugs and insomnia issued guidelines for the use of sleep-promoting medications. There was a consensus that hypnotic medication is indicated for the treatment of temporary insomnia. Temporary insomnia, in response to external circumstances, is real and can have very serious consequences. This paper reviews the proper use of sleeping pills in the primary care setting in the context of current controversy involving benzodiazepines in general and benzodiazepine hypnotics in particular. It is concluded if the physician feels a patient's temporary insomnia warrants symptomatic relief with medication, it is appropriate to prescribe use of the lowest effective dose of a benzodiazepine hypnotic for several nights. Depending on the circumstances, the physician can specify either a short-acting or a long-acting hypnotic. The patient should be firmly instructed to call the clinic or office the next day to report results.", 
    "21": "Despite the fact that the prevalence rate for insomnia in the United States is high (35.2%), the number of patients with this condition do not represent a large percentage of patients evaluated and treated in sleep disorders clinics. On the other hand, the great majority of patients with insomnia do not seek treatment for their condition from their physicians. Several hypotheses have been created to explain this phenomenon: (1) lack of training for physicians in the area of sleep disorders, (2) pessimism in relation to treatment outcome shared by patients and physicians, and (3) time constraints and other reasons on the part of the physicians. Insomniacs, however, deserve accurate diagnosis and effective treatments for their condition. Insomnia is often the result of multiple factors converging rather than one single cause. For academic purposes, however, different disorders in difficulties with initiation and maintenance of sleep are discussed. Among them, adjustment sleep disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements in sleep, circadian abnormalities, and psychiatric disturbances. Emphasis is placed on the treatment of each, along with the treatment of the other factors that are commonly found in patients with insomnia: poor sleep hygiene, use of medications that disrupt sleep, performance anxiety, deficient exposure to entrainers of circadian rhythms, diet, and exercise. A comprehensive treatment that includes a multifactorial approach is the ideal way to treat patients with insomnia. Research that will enhance our knowledge of the biological substrate of insomnia will provide clinicians with additional tools to improve the outcome of their treatments of patients with insomnia.", 
    "22": "After their clinical introduction in the 1960s, the benzodiazepines rapidly became the most widely prescribed sedative/hypnotics because of their many advantages over barbiturates and other older agents. Along with this popularity came controversy, which has continued to this day. The most recent form this has taken has been the concern that the short-acting benzodiazepines may have a predisposition to induce certain forms of clinical complications. The author reviews the historical framework in which this controversy arose. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, it became increasingly clear that long-acting agents were associated with daytime sedation as well as cognitive and psychomotor impairment, particularly in the elderly. The short-acting benzodiazepines, which greatly reduced the frequency of these types of effects, rapidly became the most widely prescribed agents. A growing body of data indicates that the short-acting hypnotics are less likely to be associated with falls and hip fractures in the elderly and also have less respiratory depressant qualities, compared with the older long-acting agents. The short-acting compounds may also be more efficacious in inducing sleep during the first night of administration. In contrast, the long-acting agents may be more desirable in those cases in which daytime sedation is desired and may be associated with a delayed and milder withdrawal sleep disturbance. With the short-acting agents, however, sleep disturbance upon drug cessation is dose dependent and may be greatly reduced by tapering the dose.", 
    "23": "This paper examines several clinical concerns about the shorter half-life benzodiazepine hypnotics from an epidemiologic perspective. It draws on data from (1) 1979 and 1990 comprehensive probability-based U.S. national household surveys of the medical use of psychotherapeutic medications; (2) a 1990 four-city community-based volunteer call-in survey of the beneficial and adverse effects of hypnotics; and (3) an analogous random-digit dialing telephone survey in the general population. The issues addressed are abuse liability, rebound, depersonalization/derealization, paranoid feelings, accidents/injuries, and the unexamined consequences of the target illness in assessments of benefit-risk. In populations representative of everyday outpatient practice, we found that (1) the abuse liability of benzodiazepine hypnotics with shorter and longer elimination half-lives was generally low and comparable; (2) prevalence rates for rebound were low and not differential for flurazepam, temazepam, triazolam, and OTC sleeping pills; (3) reports of a single or an occasional experience involving depersonalization/derealization or paranoid feelings were fairly frequent in normals, in insomnia patients prior to treatment, and in persons with untreated insomnia; (4) treatment-emergent rates of occurrence for these same symptoms were low and not drug-specific; (5) past-year prevalence rates for serious accidents/injuries were much higher for chronic untreated insomnia than for normal controls and most groups treated with psychotherapeutic medications. A high proportion of past-year users of hypnotics were satisfied with their medication and would take it again.", 
    "24": "Data from the National Disease and Therapeutic Index for the time period 1987-1991 (IMS, America) were examined for recent trends in the pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. All medications given with the desired action of promoting sleep or sedation at night were categorized as benzodiazepine hypnotics, benzodiazepine nonhypnotics, antidepressants, or other. From 1987 to 1991, the following trends were found: (1) overall pharmacologic treatment for insomnia decreased by approximately 10%, (2) use of benzodiazepine hypnotics fell about 30% during this time period, (3) use of antidepressants for insomnia increased by 100%, and (4) the noted changes were somewhat stronger for institutionalized patients than for ambulatory patients. These changes in the pharmacologic treatment of insomnia may be related to widespread media attention and are not supported by scientific data.", 
    "25": "It is not known whether hypoxia, associated with upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures when midazolam sedation is used without narcotics, persists into the post-procedure recovery period. Thirty consecutive patients aged over 60 years, undergoing ERCP using midazolam sedation alone, were monitored clinically and by pulse oximetry before, during and for 2 hours after the procedure. They were randomized prospectively to receive either 0.5 mg flumazenil or normal saline on extubation. Results show that patients were most hypoxic in the first 30 minutes after the procedure and that mean oxygen saturation had not returned to pre-sedation values by 2 hours. Treatment with flumazenil increased alertness 2 minutes after the procedure, and was associated with a significantly higher arterial oxygen saturation at 15 minutes.",

    "27": "The pharmacokinetics of oral administration of R 82913, or tetrahydroimidazol [4,5,1-jk]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one or -thione (TIBO), was compared with those of intravenous administration in five AIDS patients. TIBO was administered as a single daily 1-h infusion of 100 mg for 29 days and orally as a single daily dose for 14 days with three consecutive regimens of 100, 200, and 100 mg with probenecid (1 g) daily. Each cycle was followed by a wash-out period. Oral bioavailability of TIBO appears to be low and is not improved by the adjunction of probenecid. Trough levels obtained with oral administration systematically remained far below the 90% inhibitory concentration of TIBO against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Tolerance of TIBO was excellent. No clinical efficacy could be demonstrated. p24 antigenemia decreased significantly in one patient under intravenous therapy. TIBO derivatives are promising anti-HIV-1 agents in vitro, but improvement of oral bioavailability is needed before implementation of long-term efficacy and tolerability studies. Moreover, rapid emergence of resistance, which has been recently documented, constitutes a major problem with most nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.", 
    "28": "Previous studies have demonstrated an elevation in GH in adult insulin-dependent diabetics which can be modified by administration of pirenzepina either IV or orally. In this study we have evaluated the mean nocturnal GH levels (MNGH) and HbA1-C levels in a group of young insulin-dependent diabetics, both before and after treatment with pirenzepina (Gastrozepin). The study population included 8 patients, 6 males and 2 females, between the ages of 12 and 17 years, with a mean of 15.6 years. Pirenzepina was administered during one month at a nightly oral dose of 0.6 mg/kg followed by 5 months of treatment with 1 mg/kg. The most important results obtained in the study are the following: 1) Nocturnal administration of pirenzepina did not significantly modify the MNGH in the study population (10.88 +/- 3.81 ng/ml vs 9.57 +/- 8.25 ng/ml, p > 0.05). 2) This pharmaceutical did not alter the plasma levels of HbA1-C (9.57 +/- 8.25 vs 10.01 +/- 2.30, p > 0.05). However, 5 out of 8 patients had a decrease in their nocturnal GH secretion after pirenzepina treatment. If only the 5 patients that responded to this treatment are considered, the differences in MNGH are significant (10.48 +/- 4.94 before treatment vs 4.35 +/- 2.53 following treatment, p < 0.05). Therefore, we conclude that oral pirenzepina treatment for 6 months, at the doses described, do not consistently decrease GH secretion in young diabetics nor does it decrease HbA1-C values in this group. However, further studies are necessary to establish the possible value of this treatment.", 
    "29": "The hypothesis that peripherally administered cholecystokinin C-terminal octapeptide (CCK-8) and endogenous CCK act by the same abdominal vagal mechanism to produce satiety was tested by injecting rats with CCK-8 or the type A CCK receptor antagonist MK-329 after they had received bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomies. CCK-8 (8 nmol/kg ip) inhibited 1-h food intake by 60%; vagotomy and MK-329 (0.5 mg/kg sc) each completely blocked this effect. In contrast, vagotomy did not alter the stimulatory effect of MK-329 (0.5 mg/kg sc) on feeding; 3-h cumulative intake in control and vagotomized animals was increased by 25 and 34%, respectively. These results suggest that satiety is mediated in part by an endogenous CCK action that is independent of abdominal vagal innervation.", 
    "30": "The results of a drug-use evaluation (DUE) of triazolam at a university medical center are reported. The DUE was conducted at three institutions in a medical center complex with over 1100 beds. Indicators and thresholds were developed by the DUE subcommittee and approved by each institution's pharmacy and therapeutics committee. The medical charts of patients for whom triazolam was prescribed during January through March 1991 were reviewed. The relationship between the occurrence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and triazolam use was evaluated with the Naranjo ADR probability scale. Of 192 patients whose medical charts were reviewed, 123 (64%) were prescribed 0.125-mg doses. Patients who were > 70 years of age were more likely than younger patients to be prescribed this low dose (84% versus 60%). Fifty-four patients (28%) received no doses; a median of two doses (range, 1-46) were received by the remaining 138 patients. Twelve (9%) of those 138 patients experienced ADRs considered to be possibly (n = 10) or probably (n = 2) related to triazolam. Possible triazolam-associated reactions consisted of confusion (four cases), weakness and lethargy (four), and dizziness (two); probable triazolam-associated ADRs were confusion (one case) and next-day somnolence (one). Factors potentially contributing to ADRs included the presence of concomitant diseases or medications, the total number of doses received, and patient age. Of 138 hospitalized patients who had been given one or more doses of triazolam, 12 had had possible or probable triazolam-associated ADRs. The use of low doses and short-term therapy, particularly in elderly patients, may reduce the likelihood of ADRs.", 
    "31": "The effects of atropine or pirenzepine on bronchoconstriction and reduction in heart rate during vagus nerve stimulation were studied in 10 anesthetized dogs. The bronchoconstriction produced by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves, 5 min after intravenous injection of atropine or pirenzepine, was recorded as an increase in pulmonary inflation pressure. Atropine and pirenzepine at the doses of 0.01 mg.kg-1 and 0.2 mg.kg-1 respectively were administered and supplemented twice at 30 min intervals. Atropine inhibited the reduction in heart rate more than pirenzepine at all doses. Pirenzepine inhibited the increase in pulmonary inflation pressure more than atropine. Our results suggest that pirenzepine which inhibits bronchoconstriction is useful in patients with bronchial asthma and/or COPD as an anticholinergic agent.", 
    "32": "Lamina V-type neurons on the spinal dorsal horn which responded to the bradykinin injection into the femoral artery were studied neurophysiologically in the spinal transected cats by the tungsten microelectrode method. It has been demonstrated that the separate and combined antinociceptive effects of fentanyl, clonidine and midazolam administered intrathecally can produce reduction in response to noxious stimuli. Fentanyl (25 micrograms), clonidine (30 micrograms) and midazolam (1.0 mg) separately suppressed noxious evoked activity at the spinal level. On the other hand, fentanyl (5 micrograms), clonidine (5 micrograms) and midazolam (0.5 mg) each produced no significant suppression of the evoked activity. However, the combinations of drugs at lower doses produced supra-additive suppressive effect. These suppressive effects were reversed by each antagonist (naloxone, yohimbine and flumazenil). These findings suggest that when two of these drugs are combined at subanalgesic doses, a significant synergistic interaction is exerted. Therefore, the use of these drugs in combination can reduce the total amount of any one drug required for analgesia in the spinal cord and also reduce the side effects of these agents.", 
    "33": "The objective was to compare the materno-fetal effects between Diazepam and Magnesium sulfate used as anticonvulsivant therapy in cases of severe pre-eclampsia. The study was prospective, comparative, longitudinal, randomized clinical trial. The study was done at Centro Medico Nacional Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social. Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Torreon, Coah, Mexico. The patients were all the women admitted to the labor and delivery ward with diagnosis of severe pre-eclampsia and viable conceptus were assigned at random to receive either Diazepam (Group A, n = 19) or Magnesium sulfate (group B, n = 19). There were no significant differences between both groups. All of the patients remained alert, conscious and well oriented. None of the newborns showed hiporreflexia, flaccidity or neonatal respiratory distress that could be implicated to the anticonvulsivant therapy. It is concluded that Diazepam and Magnesium sulfate are good alternatives as anticonvulsivant therapy in cases of severe pre-eclampsia.", 
    "34": "The effect of renal failure upon the \"in vitro\" binding of midazolam, a new water-soluble short-acting benzodiazepine, has been studied in man. An increase of its free fraction (ranging from 2.52 to 5.17%) in serum from uremic patients was observed. A similar situation was originated in rabbits by administering uranyl nitrate (2 mg/Kg i.v.) and posterior hypnosis with midazolam. Uremic rabbits showed a marked increase in the free concentration of midazolam in serum (ranging from 8.9 to 13.7 micrograms/ml) and in midazolam brain levels (156.2 micrograms/g in cortex vs 84.5 micrograms/g in control animals). A positive correlation between brain and serum free concentration of midazolam was also observed. It is concluded that in renal patients more unbound drug is available to produce central nervous system effects, and a decrease in intravenous dose of midazolam could be recommended in this clinical situation.", 
    "35": "We studied the importance of cholecystokinin (CCK) system in the regulation of thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion in male rats. To this end, we tested the effects of both unselective CCK agonists CCK-8 and caerulein, and CCK-B selective agonists CCK-4 and pentagastrin as well as the selective CCK antagonists (devazepide and L-365,260) at wide dose-ranges on the cold-stimulated and TRH-induced TSH and PRL secretion. Caerulein, given s.c. 15 min before sacrifice, decreased TSH levels at 5 micrograms/kg. In time course-studies, the maximum inhibition was seen at 15 min but the effect lasted at least 30, but less than 60 min. Also CCK-8 decreased TSH levels at the doses of 20 and 50 micrograms/kg at 15 min. Devazepide and L-365,260 did not affect TSH or PRL levels at any dose. The effect of caerulein (5 micrograms/kg) was antagonized by devazepide, a CCK-A antagonist, at 100 micrograms/kg, but not by a CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 tested at a wide dose range. PRL levels were not affected by any treatment. Caerulein (5 micrograms/kg), given at the same time as TRH (500 ng/kg), inhibited the TRH-induced TSH levels at 15 min, but not at 30 or 60 min. CCK-8 (50 micrograms/kg), CCK-4 (100 micrograms/kg) and pentagastrin (500 micrograms/kg) did not affect the TRH-induced TSH secretion. The results probably indicate that CCK-A receptor stimulation inhibits TSH secretion at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. PRL levels in male rats are not affected by CCK system.", 
    "36": "Serotonergic reuptake inhibitors have been the primary medications for treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); however, other serotonergic and alpha 2-adrenergic medications also have been reported to reduce obsessive-compulsive symptoms. In this study, we compare three medications with reported efficacy in OCD to a control medication, diphenhydramine, a medication without theoretical or demonstrated treatment benefit. The three active medications were clomipramine, a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor; clonazepam, a benezodiazepine with putative serotonergic properties; and clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist. Twenty-eight subjects with DSM-III-R diagnosis of OCD rotated through 6-week trials of each of the four medications in a randomized, double-blind, multiple crossover protocol. Clomipramine and clonazepam were both effective relative to the control medication in reducing OCD symptoms. There was a significant cross-response between these two medications; however 40% of subjects failing clomipramine trials had a clinically significant response to clonazepam treatment. The control medication, diphenhydramine, itself produced a significant decrement in symptoms, whereas clonidine was ineffective in reducing OCD symptoms. Clonazepam improvement was unrelated to changes in anxiety and occurred early in treatment. Clonazepam was significantly more effective than the other medications during the first 3 weeks of treatment. The results confirm the efficacy of clomipramine in the treatment of OCD and suggest that clonazepam might be a useful alternative treatment for patients with this disorder.", 
    "37": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam were studied in 18 young subjects, from 21 to 36 years of age, and 18 elderly subjects, ranging in age from 65 to 76 years. Nine men and 9 women per age group were studied in a randomized three-way crossover design. Single doses of one 30-mg adinazolam mesylate sustained release tablet, one 30-mg immediate release tablet, and 15 mg of intravenous adinazolam mesylate were administered. Plasma adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, and psychomotor performance tests, including digit-symbol substitution and two card-sorting tasks, were performed. An effect index, defined as the maximal performance decrement divided by N-desmethyladinazolam maximum plasma concentration was calculated as a measure of sensitivity to these effects. Adinazolam oral and systemic clearances were reduced approximately 30% and 25%, respectively, in elderly volunteers. Adinazolam half-life was prolonged approximately 40% in the elderly after oral dosing. N-Desmethyladinazolam plasma concentrations and half-life were increased approximately 40% in elderly volunteers. Psychomotor performance decrements were observed following all treatments; decrements were lowest following sustained release tablets and intravenous adinazolam. Maximal performance decrements in elderly subjects were approximately twice those observed in young subjects. No significant influence of age on the effect index for digit-symbol substitution was evident. Effect indices for card-sorting tests were significantly higher in the elderly. Lower clearances of adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam are observed in elderly volunteers, and increased N-desmethyladinazolam levels contribute to increased psychomotor performance decrements in elderly subjects. Results also suggest that elderly subjects may be more sensitive to certain cognitive effects of N-desmethyladinazolam.", 
    "38": "Injuries are a major public health problem among the elderly, and they have substantial medical, social, and economic consequences. There has been a longstanding concern that psychotropic drugs increase the risk of injury, particularly in the elderly, who frequently use psychotropic drugs and are more vulnerable to drug effects that may predispose to injuries. For benzodiazepines and antidepressants, the most commonly used psychotropic drugs outside of institutional settings, an extensive body of data demonstrating psychomotor function impairment establishes a firm basis for concern, which is reinforced by the more limited epidemiologic data. However, because of limitations in both types of data, this issue remains controversial. To resolve this controversy, we suggest three lines of further research: psychomotor function tests more directly relevant to the injury risk of the elderly medication user, epidemiologic studies designed to distinguish drug effects from those of underlying psychopathology, and clinical trials that include injuries as an outcome.", 
    "39": "1. The nature of the muscarinic receptor subtype mediating endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation was investigated in the perfused mesenteric vascular bed preparation which is a model for resistance vessels. 2. After methoxamine-induced vasoconstriction the vessels were dilated with acetyl-beta-metacholine (MCh). 3. The potency of the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine, the M2-selective antagonists AF-DX 116 and AQ-RA 741, the M3-selective antagonists 4-DAMP and p-FHHSiD to block the MCh-induced vasodilation was quantified by means of pA2-values. Atropine was used for comparison. 4. The rank order of potency for the various muscarinic receptor antagonists appears to be: atropine > 4-DAMP > p-FHHSiD > pirenzepine > AQ-RA 741 > AF-DX 116 which is similar to findings in conduit arteries. 5. The high potency of the M3-selective antagonists 4-DAMP and p-FHHSiD and the low potency of the M1- and M2-selective antagonists suggest a major role of M3-receptors in the cholinergic vasodilatation in the perfused mesenteric vascular bed.", 
    "40": "It is almost three decades since a survey of attempted suicide in Dublin City Hospitals was published. In 1962, 159 cases in the City of Dublin and Borough of Dun Laoghaire were studied and reported. Over a six month period (November 1989-April 1990) 147 cases of deliberate self-poisoning were admitted to the Mater Hospital, Dublin, of which 100 case notes were appropriate for examination. In 1973, a six month survey of attempted suicide was carried out at the Mater Hospital, Dublin where 38 patients were admitted following non-fatal deliberate self-poisoning. In our study, the female to male ratio was 2:1, 50% of cases took more than one drug type,, benzodiazepines being the most commonly ingested compound. Alarmingly over a quarter (28%) of females under 25 had overdosed on paracetamol either alone or in conjunction with other compounds. Alcohol was consumed in 46% of all cases. 40% of cases involved a past history of deliberate self-poisoning and 60% had a past history of psychiatric intervention. Our survey outlines current trends in deliberate self-poisoning in Dublin's North Inner City. We have compared our 1990 survey to the similar survey conducted by our unit seventeen years ago. Several characteristics remain unaltered. The number of overdoses has almost trebled. We have noted a sharp rise in unemployment, alcohol abuse and psychiatric history among female overdoses. We have noted the disturbing introduction of paracetamol overdose particularly among young females (25%). Finally we have documented the introduction of overdosing amongst the homeless population which did not exist in the 1973 survey, but which accounts for 12% of our survey.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "42": "About 5% of the patients admitted to emergency departments with poisonings are seriously ill and need admission to intensive care units (ICUs). This paper presents the result of three multicentric studies carried out in Spain during the last ten years. A study was made of 6 ICUs in 1980, 41 in 1987 and 15 in 1990 with a total of 596 patients. The average age (36) remained stable throughout, but the number of female cases decreased each time. The most frequent cause (79%) was attempted suicide. The products used most frequently were therapeutic drugs (82, 71 and 58%) followed by drugs of abuse, and then agricultural, household and industrial products. We observed a progressive decrease in barbiturates (54, 15 and 2%) and an increase in benzodiazepines and cyclic antidepressants. Therapeutic methods used were mostly gastric lavage (64%), activated charcoal (35%), forced diuresis (43%), extracorporeal therapy (11%) and antidotes. The mortality rate fluctuated between 6.4 and 9.1%, being significantly higher with poisoning by non-therapeutic drugs. In conclusion, the most common poisoning admitted to our ICUs was by psychoactive drugs in suicide attempts. We observed the under-use of activated charcoal and an excessive usage of kidney and extracorporeal methods. The prognosis was worse for poisonings with non-therapeutic drugs.", 
    "43": "Drug and alcohol abuse continue to be commonly encountered problems in most patient populations. To deal effectively with these problems, the primary care physician must have a thorough knowledge of the pharmacology of commonly abused drugs and the adjunctive agents used in treatment. Management of alcoholism may involve a range of medical interventions, including the treatment of alcohol intoxication, the use of benzodiazepines for alcohol withdrawal, and possibly the short-term administration of disulfiram to maintain sobriety. Successful management of cocaine or amphetamine abuse requires an understanding of the powerful reinforcing properties of these drugs and the unique problems that arise in the recovery period. Barbiturate intoxication and withdrawal are potentially life-threatening events requiring skilled in-patient treatment. Prolonged use of benzodiazepines can lead to drug dependence; successful withdrawal involves gradual dosage reduction. Acute intoxication from marijuana or hallucinogenic drugs may occasionally result in adverse reactions requiring medical intervention, but significant withdrawal reactions are rare. Management of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid overdose, whether illicit or iatrogenic, requires the prompt and skillful use of opioid antagonists. Promising new pharmacologic approaches are now being successfully applied to the management of opioid dependence. An acceptance of nicotine as the addictive component of tobacco smoke has led to the development of nicotine gum as substitution therapy for cigarette smoking. Successful pharmacologic management of overdose or withdrawal is often the prerequisite for effective long-term treatment and recovery.", 
    "44": "The present paper compares the effects of different serotonergic agonists and antagonists with benzodiazepine derivatives in two animal models of anxiety; the Vogel's and the open-field tests. In the Vogel's conflict test, both diazepam and midazolam produced an anti-punishment action. The drugs 8-OH-DPAT (0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg), buspirone (0.62 mg/kg), gepirone and ipsapirone (0.3 and 0.62 mg/kg, respectively) increased punished intake of water. Ritanserin disinhibited the behaviour of rats at the doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg and ICS 205-930 (0.001 and 0.01 mg/kg) exerted a marked increase in punished drinking, while ondansetron was active only after the largest dose (1.5 mg/kg). In the open-field test, all drugs increased the number of entries into the central area, as well as the time spent in the central sector of the open-field. The present data indicate similar but not identical spectra of pharmacological sensitivity of both ethologically-oriented and conflict tests, for various classes of anxiolytic drugs. The 5-HT1A receptor agonists and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist have been shown to have similar anxiolytic-like profile to the benzodiazepines but in a narrower dose-range. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appeared to be unique in respect to their very strong anti-emotional activity (ICS 205-930), devoid of any clear-cut general inhibitory properties upon locomotion.", 
    "45": "Prior studies have suggested the presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (MAChR) subtypes within the mammalian central nervous system on the bases of functional ligand binding or molecular biologic evidence. Autoradiographic differentiation of MAChR subtypes in ligand binding assays has previously relied on the use of agonists, results of homogenate binding assays to determine relative subtype binding affinities or both. In the present study, the binding of [3H]scopolamine to intact slide-mounted tissue sections is characterized. The rapid binding kinetics of the ligand permit autoradiographic saturation experiments. Autoradiographic competition assays utilizing [3H]scopolamine and the unlabeled subtype-selective ligands pirenzepine, 11-((2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11,-dihydro-6H-pyr ido (2,3-b)(1,4)benzodiazepin-6-on (AF-DX 116) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide reveal evidence for the presence of multiple MAChR subtypes distributed heterogeneously throughout the brain. High-affinity pirenzepine MAChR (putative M1 subtype) predominate in the telencephalon. High-affinity AF-DX 116 MAChR (putative M2 subtype) are widely distributed, but are quantitatively minor populations, with the exception of motor cranial nerve nuclei and the basal pons, where they represent the dominant MAChR fractions. Evidence for relative enrichment of M3 receptors was obtained in the thalamus, the superficial layer of the superior colliculus, the periqueductal region, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the pons. The autoradiographic assays developed in this work may assist in defining altered receptor populations arising in pathologic conditions or resulting from drug therapy.", 
    "46": "The muscarinic receptor subtype antagonists 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP), 11-[(2-[diethylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl)acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3- b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) and pirenzepine were used to inhibit the outflow facility and accommodative and miotic responses to near-maximal intracameral doses of pilocarpine in the living rhesus monkey eye. The pharmacologic M3 antagonist 4-DAMP was the most potent inhibitor of all three responses, with IC50 values of 41.7 nM for outflow facility (vs. 40.9 microM pilocarpine), 19.8 nM for accommodation (vs. 40.9 or 81.8 microM pilocarpine) and 3.2 nM for miosis (vs. 4.1 microM pilocarpine). The M1 antagonist pirenzepine was at least 30-fold less potent, with IC50 values of 2.2 microM for outflow facility, 1.4 microM for accommodation and 0.1 microM for miosis. The M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 was the least potent by far, with IC50 values of 15.5 microM for outflow facility, 14.2 microM for accommodation and 1.5 microM for miosis. The results suggest that these three functional responses to pilocarpine are all mediated through an M3 receptor subtype.", 
    "47": "The mechanisms of action of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) suggest that patients taking them may respond with hyper- or hypotension when undergoing coronary artery surgery. We describe a case where MAOIs were present and fentanyl and midazolam were the anaesthetic agents used. The anaesthesia and surgery were performed without incident. Postoperative ICU care was complicated by hypertension, hyperthermia, and severe shivering followed by hypotension resistant to therapy and finally death. Diagnoses of pulmonary embolism and sepsis were unproven and may have played a role. The MAOIs may also have played a role. Reactions in patients while taking both meperidine and MAOIs are unusual and animals react differently from humans to a combination of MAOIs and narcotics. There are only five reported cases where fentanyl was given to patients on MAOIs. We conclude that, until there is more information, MAOIs should be discontinued, if possible, before surgery in which catecholamines may be needed.", 
    "48": "Critical flicker frequency (CFF) is the frequency at which a flickering light appears steady. It is a sensitive measure for assessing recovery from anaesthesia. The CFF is almost always determined with the method of limits by which the flickering frequency is progressively decreased (or increased) until the patient reports a change from fusion to flicker (or flicker to fusion). This method has two disadvantages: it is influenced by the response bias (i.e., the subjective criterion used by the subject to decide that flicker is present or absent) and by the response delay (i.e., the interval between the perceptual change and the response). To avoid these problems, the method of forced choice is recommended. For each trial, the subject observes the light during two short successive periods. The light flickers during only one period, according to chance. The patient must indicate the period during which flickers occur. If uncertain, the patient has to make a guess. The aim of this study was to compare the two methods for assessing recovery from general anaesthesia. Two induction agents were used to obtain different recovery profiles. Twenty patients undergoing uncomplicated surgery lasting less than two hours were tested. They received either thiopentone or midazolam for induction, according to a randomized design. Vecuronium was used to facilitate tracheal intubation and anaesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, isoflurane and nitrous oxide. The CFF was measured before induction and at 60, 120 and 180 minutes after arrival in the recovery room. The person measuring CFF was unaware of the induction agent used.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Catecholamine secretion in the bovine adrenal medulla is evoked largely by nicotinic receptor activation. However, bovine adrenal medulla also contain muscarinic receptors that mediate several cell responses. To understand the physiological role of muscarinic receptors in the bovine adrenal medulla it is important to identify the pharmacological subtypes present in this tissue. For this, we analyzed the abilities of different selective muscarinic antagonists in displacing the binding of the non-selective antagonist [3H] quinuclidinyl benzylate to an enriched plasma membrane fraction prepared from bovine adrenal medulla. All the selective antagonists bind at least two bindings sites with different affinities. The binding profile of the sites with high proportion is similar to the M2 subtype and those present in low proportion have a M1 profile. However, some variation in the proportion of the sites for the different ligands suggest the presence of the third pharmacological subtype (M3). We conclude that the sites in high proportion (60-80%) correspond to M2 muscarinic subtypes, and the rest is constituted by M1 plus M3 subtypes. The presence of multiplicity of subtypes in the adrenal medulla membranes suggests a diversity of functions of muscarinic receptors in the adrenal gland.",

HE increased both spontaneous and high (50 mM) ammonium chloride-evoked GABA release in cerebral cortical slices by 38% and 50%, respectively. No effects of HE were noted in cerebellar or striatal slices. An increased release of GABA in the cerebral cortex may contribute to the endogenous benzodiazepine-mediated enhancement of GABAergic tone, which is thought to be partly responsible for the pathophysiological mechanism of HE.", 
    "51": "This study examined contingent methadone take-home privileges for effectiveness in reducing on-going supplemental drug use of methadone maintenance patients. Fifty-three new intakes were randomly assigned to begin receiving take-home privileges after 2 consecutive weeks of drug-free urines or to a noncontingent procedure in which take-homes were delivered independently of urine test results. The contingent procedure produced more individuals with at least 4 consecutive weeks of abstinence (32% vs. 8%); 28% of noncontingent subjects also achieved abstinence after shifting to the contingent procedure. Lower baseline rate of drug-free urines was strongly associated with successful outcome, whereas the type of drug abused (cocaine vs. benzodiazepines) did not influence outcomes. Findings support a recommendation for using contingent take-home incentives to motivate abstinence during methadone maintenance treatment.",

The group consisted of 22 males and 10 females, with a mean age of 1.96 yr (range 7 months to 3 yr). The procedure was well tolerated by all after premedication with intravenous diazepam. Esophageal varices were eradicated in all children after 4.45 sessions (+/- 1.12). Follow-up clinical and endoscopic evaluations have been carried out over a period of 9 months to 4 yr (mean 3.5 yr) after the patients were put on a sclerotherapy program. There was a significant reduction in number of bleeding episodes (60 vs. 8), mean blood transfusion requirement (2.19 vs. 0.31), and bleeding risk factor (0.09 vs. 0.008). There were a few minor conditions, such as transient dysphagia and esophageal ulcerations, in 14 patients (43.75%), which later responded to medical treatment. Perisclerotherapy bleeding, seen in six patients (18.7%), responded to repeat sclerotherapy. Recurrence of varices was encountered in two patients (6.25%); these were eradicated after reinstitution of sclerotherapy. Endoscopic sclerotherapy is the treatment of choice in patients of extrahepatic portal vein obstruction who are below 3 yr of age.", 
    "54": "To determine which of three types of rectal sedation was most effective preoperatively in facilitating parental separation and intravenous cannulation in young children, 100 children 3.0 +/- 1.7 (mean +/- SD) yr of age were randomly assigned to four equal groups. One group (M-K-A) received rectal midazolam (0.5 mg/kg), ketamine (3 mg/kg), and atropine (0.02 mg/kg). The other sedation groups received the same doses of midazolam and atropine (M-A) or ketamine and atropine (K-A) alone, and the control group (A) received only rectal atropine. Most children in either the M-K-A (100%) or M-A (92%) groups separated easily from their parents without struggling or crying, significantly more than in the K-A (60%) or A (64%) groups. However, more children in the M-K-A group (44%) were asleep during separation than in the M-A group (8%; P < 0.05). Only 20% of the children in the M-A or M-K-A groups cried during intravenous catheter placement, significantly less than in the K-A (56%) or A (92%) groups. Intravenous catheter placement was also successful significantly more often in the M-A (80%) and M-K-A (84%) groups than in the K-A (48%) or A (40%) groups. Complications were similar among the groups, but there was evidence that midazolam prolonged recovery time in some patients. Rectal midazolam with or without ketamine is a useful technique when intravenous catheter placement before induction of anesthesia is desired.", 
    "55": "The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of spasmodic torticollis and other idiopathic torsion dystonias remain largely unknown. Thus, a variety of drugs have been used alone or in combination on an empirical basis to treat these disorders, but to date none have efficacy that is proven and consistent. The drugs in use include anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, dopaminergics and dopamine antagonists with variable degrees of clinical improvement. Botulinum toxin A injection treatment for spasmodic torticollis is safe and efficacious with minimal adverse effect. However, it is expensive and beneficial effects are short-lasting. Only when a spasmodic torticollis patient's symptoms are refractory to combined treatment, using various drugs and Botulinum toxin injections, should the patient be considered a candidate for neurosurgical procedures.", 
    "56": "The effects of new thienodiazepine anxiolytics, etizolam and clotiazepam, on the appearance of frontal midline theta activity (Fm theta) were studied by the double-blind crossover method. The results were as follows; 1) Both clotiazepam and placebo tended to increase the Fm theta appearance in all subjects, but etizolam showed no such tendency. 2) Clotiazepam significantly increased the Fm theta appearance as compared with placebo in subjects with a high neurotic tendency (N-scale of MPI above 19). 3) Clotiazepam tended to increase the Fm theta appearance as compared with placebo and etizolam in subjects with a high anxiety level (MAS score above 14). 4) Apparently more subjects complained of drowsiness after the administration of etizolam than after clotiazepam or placebo.", 
    "57": "The release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the median eminence (ME) in cyclic rats was stimulated to a significant extent by the selective muscarinic antagonists 11[(2)(diethylamino)methyl][-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX-116) and methoctramine, and to a lesser extent also by other ligands selectively antagonistic to m1 and m3 receptors. Such stimulation was estrous-cycle-dependent and was not achieved by muscarinic agonists. We suggest that the effect is induced via the m4 receptor subtype. Attempts to block the muscarinic-antagonist-induced stimulation of GnRH release with a variety of drugs were successful only in the presence of prazosin, an antagonist to alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. One possible explanation for this muscarinically mediated stimulation of GnRH release is that it results from cross-talk between the muscarinic and the alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, i.e., muscarinic agonists might inhibit the release induced by alpha 1-agonists, and muscarinic antagonists, by cancelling this inhibitory effect, might thus allow the endogenous alpha 1-agent, norepinephrine, to induce the release of GnRH.", 
    "58": "Cholinergic neurotransmission exerts a physiological control on GH secretion. Pirenzepine (Pz), an antagonist of muscarinic receptors, by enhancing hypothalamic somatostatin release, inhibits stimulated GH secretion in normal subjects but not in acromegalic patients. To address the hypothesis that a feedback effect of GH hypersecretion can be involved in this condition, GH responses to GHRH 1-29, 1 microgram/kg iv, with and without administration of Pz, 40 mg iv before tests, were investigated in eight acromegalic patients, before and 20-30 days after transsphenoidal adenomectomy. Pz diminished (p < 0.001) the incremental area under the curve (AUC) of GH responses to GHRH in seven normal controls. In contrast, GHRH responsiveness in untreated acromegalic patients was not affected by Pz. Postoperative basal GH levels decreased by 62.4 +/- 14.9% (p < 0.01). Pz inhibited GH responses to GHRH (p < 0.01). Furthermore, a direct relationship (r = 0.73, p < 0.01) between basal concentrations and the AUC of GH responses following Pz plus GHRH-test was found. The finding that muscarinic receptor activity recovered after the reduction of serum GH basal levels by pituitary surgery lends support to the proposed pathophysiological role of GH excess as a possible determinant factor in cholinergic-somatostatinergic dysfunction in acromegaly.", 
    "59": "Alprazolam (Xanax) or 8-chloro-1-methyl-6-phenyl-4H-S-triazolobenzodiazepine is a potent drug for the treatment of anxiety disorders. The chemical structure differs from the classical benzodiazepines by incorporation of the triazoloring. Due to the triazolo ring, the drug can have additional modes of action than the normal benzodiazepines. The triazolobenzodiazepines are potent inhibitors of the platelet-activating factor. This factor is a potent stimulator of the corticotropin-releasing hormone. This hormone has an effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis but the corticotropin-releasing hormone is also known to be a stimulator of the locus coeruleus. The corticotropin-releasing hormone in patients with panic attacks is elevated. This could be a result of the hyperactive metabolism which is observed by positron emission tomographic (PET) studies of the right parahippocampal area.", 
    "60": "Withdrawal of benzodiazepines in man may induce hallucinatory symptoms and can evoke delusional depressions, which can be treated with dopamine-antagonistic drugs. Withdrawal of benzodiazepines in rats induces a strong hyperactivity during daytime, leaving the nighttime activity relatively undisturbed. This hyperactivity may be related to an enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic area, especially in the nucleus accumbens. Mesolimbic dopaminergic activity may be specifically involved in the development of benzodiazepine withdrawal. Acute administration of benzodiazepines in otherwise non-treated rats, has been described not to affect the dopamine-turnover in the nucleus accumbens, measured by synthesis inhibition. However, activation by administration of haloperidol (feedback activation) can be suppressed by benzodiazepines effectively. Five different benzodiazepines viz. desmethyldiazepam (DMD), lorazepam (LRZ), brotizolam (BTZ), triazolam (TRZ) and flunitrazepam (FNZ) have been compared with respect to their acute effects. Using a 3-fold increase in dopamine turnover (determined by measuring the DOPAC-concentration), benzodiazepines were capable to reduce this increase maximally for 70-80% in the nucleus accumbens. The results point to a selective effect of benzodiazepines in the nucleus accumbens. The increase induced by haloperidol in the corpus striatum was found to be much less sensitive to benzodiazepines. In contrast to the other compounds lorazepam appeared to have no effect on haloperidol-induced increase in DOPAC concentration. Flunitrazepam and brotizolam did affect not only the haloperidol-induced DOPAC increase but also the basal DOPAC concentrations. Linear dose-response curves could not be obtained for the compounds, but minimal effective doses could be assessed. Flunitrazepam and triazolam appeared to be the most active compounds.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "The binding of 3H-acetylcholine (ACh) to acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on rat thymocytes was examined and found to be inhibited by the treatment with several antagonists against nicotinic and muscarinic AChRs. This result suggested that thymocytes have AChRs with different affinity, and bear both nicotinic and muscarinic AChRs on their surfaces. To make clear the functional significance of the AChRs, DNA synthesis of the thymocytes stimulated with ACh was examined. 3H-thymidine uptake of thymocytes was significantly increased when the cells were stimulated with ACh or another cholinergic agonist. The increment of DNA synthesis caused by ACh in thymocytes was not reduced by treatment with nicotinic antagonists, but was decreased by treatment with any of the muscarinic antagonists. Concentration of the intracellular second messengers, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) was also made higher by ACh stimulation. It is discussed that the enhancement of intracellular IP3 and cGMP concentrations after stimulation of muscarinic AChRs appears to be related with the increment of thymocyte DNA synthesis.", 
    "62": "Although the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders can be approached from numerous theoretical perspectives, the concentration of research has been on the efficacy of behaviour therapy. Behaviour therapy procedures are briefly described and evaluated, including systematic desensitisation, flooding, modelling, reinforcement and cognitive procedures. We also review research findings on pharmacotherapy, focusing on benzodiazepine and antidepressant usage. Finally, several conclusions are drawn concerning the scientific and clinical status of these treatment approaches for childhood anxiety disorders.", 
    "63": "Physicians often face the problem that they have to treat anxiety and insomnia in patients who are dependent on narcotics or other substances. Reports about different reinforcing properties of different benzodiazepines and increasing concern about their misuse, often in combination with other drugs, call for studies that help to establish recommendations for choosing psychopharmacologic agents in the treatment of these patients. Opiate addicts enrolled in a methadone maintenance program were interviewed about their subjective \"liking\" of all psychotropic substances with which they had personal experience. The results confirm previous reports that certain benzodiazepines, especially flunitrazepam and diazepam, stand out from others in terms of positive reinforcing properties. Overall, the attractiveness of benzodiazepines as drugs of abuse for poly-drug abusers is lower than that of other sedative/hypnotics.", 
    "64": "Several classes of nonbenzodiazepine compounds, including imidazopyridines such as alpidem and zolpidem and cyclopyrrolones, e.g., zopiclone, have effects similar to benzodiazepines and may act at the benzodiazepine receptor in brain. We characterized the binding of these compounds to the benzodiazepine site in three brain regions using specific uptake of the high-affinity ligand [3H]Ro15-1788 (flumazenil). For alpidem, benzodiazepine binding was decreased in cortex and hippocampus with increasing drug dose. For zolpidem, receptor binding was reduced in cortex without a dose-response effect and no effect was observed on cerebellar binding. Zopiclone did not alter binding except for a decrease in binding at the lowest dose evaluated and an increase in binding above control at the highest dose. These data corroborate prior studies indicating that the imidazopyridines appear to act at the benzodiazepine receptor, but do not support receptor subtype selectivity of zolpidem. The limited effect of zopiclone except for increased binding at high doses is also consistent with prior studies suggesting that zopiclone acts at a site distinct from the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "65": "The effect of bethanechol on membrane potential and excitability was determined in mudpuppy parasympathetic postganglionic neurons. Bethanechol induced a large amplitude hyperpolarization, which was followed by a smaller amplitude depolarization, in 115 out of 135 cells tested. In approximately 20% of these cells, a brief depolarization preceded the hyperpolarization. During the bethanechol-induced hyperpolarization, the membrane input resistance decreased markedly, whereas the input resistance was increased during the subsequent depolarization. The hyperpolarization and depolarization were blocked by atropine and were unaffected by d-tubocurarine, thus, both appeared to be mediated by muscarinic receptors. The bethanechol-induced hyperpolarization was inhibited by the M2 muscarinic receptor antagonist AF-DX 116, whereas the bethanechol-induced depolarization was unaffected. Both a nonselective increase in membrane conductance and a decrease in membrane potassium conductance appeared to be involved in the generation of the bethanechol-induced depolarization. Evidence for the first mechanism was obtained in barium-treated cells in which bethanechol initiated a rapid onset depolarization, which was reversed at membrane potentials near 0 mV. Evidence for the second mechanism was obtained when the hyperpolarization was inhibited by AF-DX 116. In AF-DX 116-treated cells, the membrane input resistance was increased during most of the bethanechol-induced depolarization. Mudpuppy neurons initiate repetitive action potential activity in response to long depolarizing current pulses. Following application of bethanechol, with the hyperpolarization negated electrotonically, the number of action potentials produced by a depolarizing current pulse was greater than that produced prior to application of bethanechol. It is suggested that activation of muscarinic receptors on mudpuppy cardiac neurons influences multiple conductance systems and determines the excitability of these neurons.", 
    "66": "In rodents, the effect of the beta-carboline derivative isopropyl-6- benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (abecarrnil), a new ligand for benzodiazepine receptors possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, was evaluated on the function of central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor complex, both in vitro and in vivo. Added in vitro to rat cortical membrane preparation, abecarnil increased [3H]GABA binding, enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and reduced the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS). These effects were similar to those induced by diazepam, whereas the partial agonist Ro 16-6028 (tert-butyl-(S)-8-bromo-11,12,13,13a-tetrahydro-9-oxo-9H- imidazo[1,5-a]-pyrrolo-[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-1-carboxylate) showed very weak efficacy in these biochemical tests. After i.p. injection to rats, abecarnil and diazepam decreased in a time-dependent and dose-related (0.25-20 mg/kg i.p.) manner [35S]TBPS binding measured ex vivo in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, both drugs at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg antagonized completely the convulsant activity and the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by isoniazide (350 mg/kg s.c.) as well as the increase of [35S]TBPS binding induced by foot-shock stress. To better correlate the biochemical and the pharmacological effects, we studied the action of abecarnil on [35S]TBPS binding, exploratory motility and on isoniazid-induced biochemical and pharmacological effects in mice. In these animals, abecarnil produced a paralleled dose-dependent (0.05-1 mg/kg i.p.) reduction of both motor behavior and cortical [35S]TBPS binding. Moreover, 0.05 mg/kg of this beta-carboline reduced markedly the increase of [35S]TBPS binding and the convulsions induced by isoniazid (200 mg/kg s.c.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "Fentanyl has been shown to increase the overall resistance to inspiratory flow of the ventilatory system (Rmax). Rmax is the sum of the airway resistance (Raw) and of the non-Newtonian resistance (delta R) which may result from the viscoelastic properties of the thoracic tissues, from inequalities of the regional time constants within the lung, or from both. A bronchoconstrictor challenge may increase the magnitude of variation in regional time constants. Thus, in order to describe the effect of fentanyl on the two components of Rmax, this study was performed, with the end-inflation occlusion method, during paralysis and mechanical ventilation in 10 normal men undergoing barbiturate anaesthesia for minor urological procedures. The patients were anaesthetized with methohexitone and paralysed with vecuronium. Before administration of fentanyl, delta R accounted for 56% of Rmax. Fentanyl 5 micrograms kg-1 elicited a significant increase in Rmax (+34.5%; P = 0.005) and a parallel increase in both Raw (+35.2%, P = 0.017) and delta R (+33.5%, P = 0.005). The increase in Raw, but not in delta R, was reversed by atropine, suggesting that the increase in these two components of Rmax was not linked. Thus fentanyl increased both components of Rmax, but the effects of fentanyl on Raw and delta R seemed to depend on different mechanisms.",

    "74": "1. The effects of pirenzepine (a selective blocking agent of M1 muscarinic receptors) were studied on excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) and inhibitory junction potentials (IJPs) elicited on colonic smooth muscle by stimulation of efferent parasympathetic nerve fibres in anaesthetized cats and rabbits. 2. Pirenzepine (25 micrograms kg-1 to 0.2 mg kg-1, i.v.) decreased the amplitude of EJPs or abolished them. In pirenzepine, parasympathetic stimulation elicited IJPs in most cases. 3. In both species, pirenzepine initiated spontaneous IJPs, indicating an increase in the activity of the non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic (NANC) inhibitory neurones. 4. The results suggest that M1 muscarinic receptors are involved in synaptic transmission within intramural plexuses, at interneuronal synapses in the parasympathetic excitatory pathway to colonic smooth muscle, but are not involved in the pathway to the NANC inhibitory neurones. The facilitation of IJPs by pirenzepine suggests that, under normal physiological conditions, NANC neurones are tonically inhibited by an intramural nervous circuit involving M1 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "75": "The effect of the muscarinic receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 on the inhibitory action of muscarinic agonists and on responses mediated by nicotinic or muscarinic ganglionic transmission was studied in the superior cervical ganglion of the anesthetized cat. The postganglionic compound action potential evoked by cervical sympathetic trunk stimulation was depressed by methacholine or acetylcholine (ACh) injected into the ganglionic arterial supply. The depression was blocked by AF-DX 116. The compound action potentials evoked by preganglionic stimulus trains were also depressed when the intratrain frequency was 2 Hz or greater. This intratrain depression was, however, insensitive to AF-DX 116. The anticholinesterase drug physostigmine markedly enhanced the intratrain depression of the compound action potential. This effect was reversed by AF-DX 116. During nicotinic receptor block with hexamethonium, preganglionic stimulus trains with intratrain frequencies of 5 Hz or greater produced nicitating membrane contractions that could be blocked by the M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine. The amplitude of the contractions increased with frequency and reached a maximum at 20-40 Hz. AF-DX 116 had no effect on these responses. After administration of physostigmine, the amplitude of the nictitating membrane responses decreased with increasing intratrain frequency. AF-DX 116 reversed this effect. The data suggest that, in the superior cervical ganglion, AF-DX 116 sensitive muscarinic receptors which depress synaptic transmission are activated by exogenous agonists but not by the ACh released by the preganglionic axon terminals unless cholinesterase activity is inhibited.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "76": "The GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor consists of at least four subunits, alpha, beta, gamma and delta, each comprised of several variants. The developmental expression of the alpha 1, beta 1-3, gamma 2 and delta subunits was studied in the murine inferior olivary nucleus by in situ hybridization with antisense cRNA probes. The postnatal appearance and distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding sites, alpha and beta subunit-specific ligands respectively, were also studied autoradiographically. The beta 3 subunit was transiently expressed in each of the subnuclei of the inferior olive: The signal was strong at birth, increased throughout postnatal week 1 and rapidly declined thereafter to low adult levels. A similar pattern of labeling was observed with [3H]muscimol. Detectable levels of alpha 1 subunit mRNA hybridization signal and [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites were also present in the inferior olive at birth, decreasing thereafter. Low to moderate levels of beta 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunit mRNAs were present in olivary neurons throughout postnatal development, while delta mRNAs were largely absent. It has been reported previously that, during the 2nd postnatal week, the ratio of climbing fiber terminals to Purkinje cells is reduced from 3:1, as observed in neonates, to the 1:1 relationship observed in the adult cerebellar cortex. Our results raise the possibility that the subunit composition of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor in inferior olivary neurons undergoes changes during development, and that this process may be related to the elimination of multiple climbing fiber innervation of cerebellar Purkinje cells.",

The somatic membranes of the granule cells, which receive no synapses, were immunopositive for the alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits, but not for the alpha 6 subunit. Thus, the alpha 1 and the beta 2/3 subunits are located at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, but the alpha 6 subunit is detectable only at synaptic sites.", 
    "78": "The efficacy, safety, and performance of triazolam was compared with those of other shorter-acting hypnotics acting on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor--zopiclone, zolpidem, midazolam, brotizolam, temazepam, lormetazepam, and loprazolam. In all, 5506 patients participated in 38 clinical and epidemiologic studies, of whom 2462 were treated with triazolam in parallel-design and crossover studies. To provide clinically relevant comparisons, only studies using comparator agents in doses equipotent to the triazolam doses were included. Two general findings emerged. First, \"serious\" central nervous system side effects, such as excitement and violence, were not demonstrated for any of the hypnotic agents, including triazolam. Other central nervous system side effects, such as depression and irritability, were reported with equal frequencies for all the hypnotics reviewed. Rebound insomnia, reported intermittently with most of these agents, was short-lived and not clinically significant. So-called early morning insomnia was noted only once and does not appear to be a valid clinical entity. Daytime anxiety was not observed in large numbers of triazolam-treated subjects studied, which is contrary to claims that the drug is anxiogenic. Second, a remarkable similarity was found among all of these shorter-acting agents in terms of efficacy, side effects, and performance-related effects. This was particularly of note for zopiclone and zolpidem. Although claims have been made suggesting differences, evaluation of the studies herein showed that these nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics were indistinguishable from triazolam and other benzodiazepine hypnotics in their clinical and pharmacologic activity. Thus, different chemical structures did not a priori predict different clinical profiles when drugs share a similar mechanism of action.", 
    "79": "Expression plasmids were constructed with cDNAs encoding the rat gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor alpha 1, beta 2, and gamma 2 subunits and were cotransfected into cultured human embryonic kidney 293 cells. A single cell line (WS-1) was established after G-418 treatment and clonal selection. This cell line contained saturable, high affinity binding sites for the benzodiazepines [3H] Ro 15-4513 and [3H]flunitrazepam that were modulated by GABA. Competition experiments with benzodiazepine receptor ligands suggest a profile characteristic of native \"type I\" benzodiazepine receptors, because strong correlations were observed between the Ki values of these ligands in WS-1 cells and in both cerebellar homogenates (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) and 293 cells transiently transfected with the corresponding cDNAs (r = 0.96, p < 0.001). Fluorescence intensity in WS-1 cells loaded with the Cl(-)-specific probe 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)-quinolinium was reliably increased by GABA. This effect was blocked by bicuculline and augmented by midazolam, consistent with the presence of GABA-gated, benzodiazepine receptor-modulated, Cl- channels. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of mRNAs encoding alpha 1 and gamma 2 receptor subunits. Southern blot analysis confirmed genomic integration of transfected alpha 1 and gamma 2 cDNAs. The beta 2 subunit was not detected in either Northern or Southern blot analysis, indicating that a functional type I GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex can be constituted without a beta subunit.",

Latency of the P3 was significantly increased after a single dose of both 5 and 10 mg of diazepam but not after placebo. P3 amplitude decreased slightly, but not significantly after 10 mg of diazepam. Changes in P3 occurred in the absence of significant changes in the preceding evoked waves (N1, P2).

    "81": "Alcohol exerts several of its actions via the chloride channel associated with the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. To explore a possible role for this receptor complex in risk for alcoholism, and to determine whether risk for alcoholism is associated with risk for benzodiazepine abuse, the authors administered intravenous diazepam to 18 sons of male alcoholics (SOAs) and 18 control subjects. Four logarithmically increasing doses of diazepam and matched volumes of placebo were given in randomized order on separate days about 1 week apart. SOAs were significantly more likely than controls to report euphoric responses to diazepam. At some diazepam doses, SOAs were more likely to report feeling \"high\" and \"intoxicated.\" SOAs and controls did not differ in feeling \"drugged.\" SOAs and controls may differ in expectations regarding the subjective effects of drugs and/or in the function of the central GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. These findings also add further evidence for increased pleasurable effects, and thus possibly increased risk for benzodiazepine abuse, in a subgroup of SOAs.", 
    "82": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes in neuroblastoma cell lines IMR-32 and SH-SY5Y were determined with receptor binding, Ca++ mobilization and Northern blotting. Displacement of [3H]NMS with pirenzepine in IMR-32 cells revealed apparent binding sites with Kd values of 5 (41%) and 237 nM (59%). With 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-metylpiperidine metiodid, a similar proportion of apparent high- and low-affinity binding was obtained: 36 (Kd = 0.26 nM) and 64% (Kd = 6.3 nM), respectively. In SH-SY5Y cells, two different affinities with apparent Kd of 40 (24%) and 460 nM (76%) could be distinguished with pirenzepine, even though the Kd of the apparent high-affinity site varied markedly (variation = 8.7-96.8 nM). Inhibition of carbachol-induced Ca++ mobilization displayed high sensitivity to 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine metiodid in both cell lines. IMR-32 cells displayed high sensitivity to pirenzepine, whereas the sensitivity varied between different batches of SH-SY5Y cells. DNA fragments (approximately 1000 base pairs) from SH-SY5Y DNA amplified with polymerase chain reaction were used as probes for muscarinic receptor mRNA. Northern blotting with the Hm1-specific probe gave a stronger signal for SH-SY5Y than for IMR-32, whereas the result obtained with the Hm2-probe was the opposite. Also, the Hm3 mRNA was detected in SH-SY5Y cells. The Hm4 and Hm5 transcripts were not detected in either of these cell lines.",

The present study tested the hypothesis that pentobarbital would enhance benzodiazepine binding in a site-specific manner across the rat brain. In vitro receptor autoradiography was used to localize and quantitatively map [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FLU) binding in the absence and presence of pentobarbital in 133 brain areas. Each area demonstrated a statistically significant increase in [3H]FLU binding in the presence of in vitro pentobarbital (P < or = 0.05). Hindbrain nuclei dominated the top 20% of brain areas demonstrating the greatest pentobarbital-induced increases in [3H]FLU binding. The greatest mean percent increase in [3H]FLU binding occurred in the medulla, including areas known to be important for cardiovascular control, breathing, motor tone and regulating levels of arousal. These findings show that differential enhancement of benzodiazepine binding in the presence of pentobarbital occurred in brain areas controlling physiological functions known to be impaired by systemically administered pentobarbital.", 
    "84": "Hyperekplexia, or startle disease (STHE), is an autosomal dominant neurologic disorder characterized by muscular rigidity of central nervous system origin, particularly in the neonatal period, and by an exaggerated startle response to sudden, unexpected acoustic or tactile stimuli. STHE responds dramatically to the benzodiazepine drug clonazepam, which acts at gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA-A) receptors. The STHE locus (STHE) was recently assigned to chromosome 5q, on the basis of tight linkage to the colony-stimulating factor 1-receptor (CSF1-R) locus in a single large family. We performed linkage analysis in the original and three additional STHE pedigrees with eight chromosome 5q microsatellite markers and placed several of the most closely linked markers on an existing radiation hybrid (RH) map of the region. The results provide strong evidence for genetic locus homogeneity and assign STHE to a 5.9-cM interval defined by CSF1-R and D5S379, which are separated by an RH map distance of 74 centirays (roughly 2.2-3.7 Mb). Two polymorphic markers (D5S119 and D5S209) lie within this region, but they could not be ordered with respect to STHE. RH mapping eliminated the candidate genes GABRA1 and GABRG2, which encode GABA-A receptor components, by showing that they are telomeric to the target region.", 
    "85": "To determine what muscarinic receptor subtype regulates the rise of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) and resultant airway submucosal gland secretion on muscarinic receptor stimulation, we examined the effects of atropine (ART), pirenzepine (PZ), 11([2-(diethylamino) methyl-1-piperidinyl] acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pirido (2,3-b)(1,4)-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX116) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodode (4-DAMP) on methacholine (MCh)-evoked [Ca2+]i rise in acinar cells, mucus glycoprotein (MGP) secretion and electrolyte secretion from submucosal glands isolated from feline tracheae. [Ca2+]i was measured with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorescent dye, fura2. We determined MGP secretion by measuring trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-precipitable 3H-labeled glycoconjugates and electrolyte secretion by the change in the rate constant of 22Na-efflux from isolated glands. Half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of PZ, AF-DX116, 4-DAMP and ATR against MCh (10(-5) M)-evoked [Ca2+]i rise were 10(-7) M, 6 x 10(-6) M, 8 x 10(-9) M and 6 x 10(-9) M, respectively. IC50 values of these antagonists against MCh (10(-5) M)-evoked MGP secretion were 10(-6) M, 2 x 10(-5) M, 8 x 10(-9) M and 6 x 10(-9) M, respectively. MCh (10(-5) M)-evoked 22Na-efflux was significantly inhibited by 10(-7) M 4-DAMP and 10(-7) M ATR (p < 0.01, respectively), but the inhibitory effect of PZ (10(-7) M) was not statistically significant.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "In an attempt to elucidate the role of cholinergic mechanism in respiratory chemosensitivity to CO2 in humans, we examined 17 healthy male volunteers for ventilatory responses to hyperoxic progressive hypercapnia and isocapnic progressive hypoxia on three separate days in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Pirenzepine, a M1 muscarinic antagonist which does not cross the blood-brain barrier, biperiden, another M1 muscarinic antagonist which is expected to penetrate into the central nervous system, or placebo was intravenously preinjected before the measurement of ventilatory responses. There were no significant differences in the mean magnitude of ventilatory responses among the three experimental days. However, despite the poor correlation between the magnitude of ventilatory response to hypercapnia in the placebo and pirenzepine studies, there was a significant correlation between them when the value in the pirenzepine study was expressed as % of control, value i.e., subjects with greater hypercapnic ventilatory response in the placebo study showed greater declines with biperiden. Since these relations were seen only for the ventilatory response to hypercapnia with biperiden, we suggest that a cholinergic mechanism, particularly the M1 muscarinic receptor, may be involved in chemoreception to CO2 in the central nervous system and constitute the neurochemical background for the interindividual variation in hypercapnic ventilatory response in humans.", 
    "87": "Thirty cases of SMS, including 22 cases reported previously in China, were analysed clinically manifested by involvement of neck and facial muscles, slurred speech, dysphagia or dyspnea, exaggerated tendon reflexes, ankle clonus and/or Hoffmann's sign. Half of them had past history of infection. Five out of 18 CSF examined showed elevation of protein content, immunoglobulin and white cell count, suggesting the presence of inflammation or demyelination changes in CNS. The pathology of the syndrome is probably located in the spinal cord or brain stem. The criteria for diagnosis are proposed. For treatment, the dosage and way of administration of diazepam should be judged according to the severeness of the disease; nitrazepam and clonazepam are effective, too.", 
    "88": "The study compared the effectiveness of temazepam and a mixture of chloral hydrate and hydroxyzine in sedating 20 young children aged 20 to 60 months (mean age 38.7 months). All the children exhibited negative behaviour during a screening visit and required at least two visits for restorative treatment with the use of sedation. The children were assigned randomly to receive either 50 mg/kg of chloral hydrate with 25 mg of hydroxyzine or 0.3 mg/kg of temazepam for the first visit, and the alternate regimen for the second visit, in a double-blind manner. Pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation levels were monitored before, during and after the operative procedures. All the treatment sessions were video-recorded and evaluated independently by three paediatric dentists for the degree of crying, movement, sleep and overall behaviour during specific procedures and at specific time intervals. The results showed no statistically significant differences between the two pharmacologic regimens with regard to crying, movement, sleep and overall behaviour. No significant difference in behaviour was found related to either the order of administration of the drugs or to the sex of the patients. It was concluded that 0.3 mg/kg temazepam and a mixture of 50 mg/kg chloral hydrate with 25 mg hydroxyzine had similar sedative effects on the children receiving dental treatment.", 
    "89": "In neonatal units, there is a tendency to assume that any acutely sick infant with gastro-intestinal symptoms has necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). This prospective study was conducted to find a better definition of enteropathy in preterm neonates and their risk factors.", 
    "90": "All the 351 preterm neonates admitted to a neonatal unit from 1 August 1988 to 31 July 1989 were included in the study. A chart including 45 items was established for each infant, with special attention to data on the pregnancy, delivery, any early ischemic and/or infectious problem, nutrition and any gastro-intestinal (GI) problem. All the neonates were fed similarly, depending their maturation, gestational age and GI status. Each infant was assigned to one of 5 categories: 1) no GI problem; 2) transient obstruction; 3) NEC with pneumatosis; 4) hemorrhagic colitis without obstruction or pneumatosis; 5) other GI disease.", 
    "91": "267 infants had no GI problem during their stay in the neonatal unit. 53 developed GI symptoms: 23 transient obstructions, 6 NEC, and 24 hemorrhagic colitis. The mean age at onset of symptoms in these last 3 categories was 7 days, 14 days and 23 days, respectively. Ten risk factors were found to be significantly correlated with GI disturbances: umbilical venous catheter, benzodiazepines, birth weight < 1,500 g, patent ductus arteriosus, ventilatory assistance, abnormal amniotic fluid, gestational age < 32 weeks, early antibiotic treatment, passage of meconium > 48 hours, episodes of apnoea and/or bradycardia.", 
    "92": "This follow-up shows that the GI disturbances of preterm neonates admitted to a neonatal unit, specially those having one or more risk factors, can be separated into 3 groups: 1) isolated intestinal obstruction, seen in the most immature babies during the first week of life with the risk of developing NEC; 2) frank blood in the stool, indicating colitis and possibly minor forms of NEC; 3) combined obstructive and hemorrhagic symptoms, typical of NEC.", 
    "93": "The application of the axial dispersion model to diazepam hepatic elimination was evaluated using data obtained for impulse-response experiments with diazepam in the single-pass isolated perfused rat liver preparation. The transient form of the two-compartment dispersion model was applied to the output concentration versus time profile of diazepam after bolus input of a radiolabelled tracer into the hepatic portal vein (n = 4), providing DN and CLint estimates of 0.251 +/- 0.093 and 135 +/- 59 ml min-1, respectively. In contrast, the one-compartment form of the axial dispersion model, which assumes instantaneous transversal distribution of substance to the accessible spaces within the liver, could not adequately describe the residence time distribution (RTD) of diazepam. Furthermore, the magnitude of DN, a stochastic parameter which characterizes the axial spreading of solutes during transit through the liver, is similar to that determined for non-eliminated substances such as erythrocytes, albumin, sucrose and water. These findings suggest that the dispersion of diazepam in the perfused rat liver is determined primarily by the architecture of the hepatic microvasculature."
