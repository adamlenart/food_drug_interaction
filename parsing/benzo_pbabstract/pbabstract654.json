    "0": "The biochemical and behavioural effects of acute, 5, 15 and 25 days treatment with chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) were examined in the rat. After 5 days of drug treatment, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) levels in the midbrain, hypothalamus and cortex were significantly higher than those of the corresponding controls, and the level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) was significantly lower, indicating reduced turnover. After 15 days of drug treatment, 5HIAA levels were significantly elevated, compared with the controls, possibly indicating that CDP was blocking the transport of 5HIAA from the brain. This effect appears to be independent of the reduced turnover. After 25 days of drug treatment there were no significant differences compared with the controls. There were no marked changes in noradrenaline and dopamine in any of the areas investigated. It appears that the reduction in 5HT turnover is linked to the anxiolytic effects of CDP; the latter were found after 5 days of drug treatment, but not after 15 or 25 days, using the social interaction test of anxiety.", 
    "1": "Diazepam (0.3, 0.6, 1.2, or 2.5 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction of the potentiated startle effect where acoustic startle amplitude is normally increased in the presence of a light previously paired with a shock. Even the lowest dose tested (0.3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated potentiated startle. The effect was selective since the same doses did not depress baseline startle amplitude measured in the same animals in the same test session. A 2 X 2 design in which rats were trained and tested under the same or different drug condition (diazepam or saline) showed the results could not be explained by state-dependent learning. The primary effect of diazepam was to block expression of rather than acquisition of fear as measured by potentiated startle. Flurazepam (2.5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) also reduced potentiated startle selectively but was 6--8 times less potent than diazepam. These and other results suggest that the potentiated startle paradigm, as a measure of classical conditioning that involves no operant, might provide a useful adjunct to behavioral methods currently being used to analyze antianxiety compounds.", 
    "2": "The time course of action of repeated daily doses of chlordiazepoxide (CDP) was examined in mice with septal lesions. Bilateral septal lesions produced changes in both conditioned and unconditioned behavior. These lesions increased rate of operant responding on a VI-40 s schedule and produced hyperreactivity to tactile stimuli. The effects of repeated administration of CDP on these two classes of behavior were observed to follow different time courses. In a dose dependent fashion, CDP first reduced VI response rates in septal mice, but after several daily doses the response rate increased above post-surgical baseline levels. The suppressant effects of CDP on septal hyper-reactivity were quite different. Hyper-reactivity was persistently attenuated by all CDP doses tested during the eight-day drug regimen. The pattern of drug effects suggested that serotonin antagonism was involved in CDP's effects on lesion produced hyper-reactivity.", 
    "3": "In a multicenter, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, the efficacy of Limbitrol was compared with that of its components, amitriptyline and chlordiazepoxide. All patients had a diagnosis of primary depression. Data from 279 patients were evaluated using the Hamilton depression scale, the Beck depression inventory, and physician and patient global change measures. Statistically significant differences favoring Limbitrol occurred after 1 week of treatment, and a trend in favor of Limbitrol continued throughout the remaining 3 weeks. In most efficacy comparisons, the combination was as good as, or better than, amitriptyline alone. It was superior to chlordiazepoxide alone after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. Each component produced an independent contribution to the total therapeutic effect: the chlordiazepoxide effect was more prominent in the first 2 weeks and the amitriptyline effect in the latter 2 weeks. A trend favoring amitriptyline over chlordiazepoxide was evident by week 4. The overall incidence of side effects was comparable in both Limbitrol- and amitriptyline-treated groups. Limbitrol-treated patients exhibited more sedation, but significantly fewer Limbitrol patients discontinued treatment prematurely because of side effects.", 
    "4": "The effect of delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), morphine, haloperidol and chlordiazepoxide on the exhibition of the signs of the quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome was studied in rats. In preliminary studies approximately equi-sedative doses of these drugs were chosen. Morphine and THC produced a very similar degree of suppression of the signs of the quasi-morphine withdrawal, but unlike morphine, the effects of THC were not reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The dopamine receptor antagonist, haloperidol, produced a moderate suppression of the withdrawal syndrome and chlordiazepoxide was without significant effect. It is concluded that THC is of very similar potency to morphine in suppressing the quasi-morphine withdrawal syndrome, but its activity in this regard does not appear to be dependent upon the availability of opiate or dopamine receptors, nor is it due to sedation alone.", 
    "5": "Naloxone in high doses (60--240 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose-dependent increase in cerebellar cGMP content of mice. The rise in cGMP content reached its maximum within 5 min and was of short duration. Short-lasting episodes of clonic seizures were noted after 240 mg/kg naloxone. Low doses of naloxone (5--10 mg/kg) had no effect on cerebellar cGMP content, but markedly potentiated the increase in cGMP induced by isoniazid. On the other hand, naloxone (5 mg/kg) partially antagonized the fall in cGMP elicited by diazepam, but had only a slight effect on the action of pentobarbital (30 mg/kg i.p.). These results support the assumption proposed by other authors that naloxone exerts GABA antagonistic effects aside from the potent opiate receptor antagonistic activity.", 
    "6": "Diazepam and muscimol, a direct GABA agonist, were compared on behavioral inhibition induced in rats by (1) novelty, (2) punishment, and (3) nonreward. (1) Muscimol (0.03--0.25 mg . kg-1 i.p. 30 min before testing, or i.v. immediately before testing) failed to enhance food intake consistently in a nonfamiliar situation and (0.125--0.5 mg . kg-1 i.p. or i.v.) to increase the ingestion of an unknown food (chocolate); (2) muscimol (0.125--0.5 mg . kg-1 i.p. or 0.25 i.v. 10 min before testing) was ineffective in reducing the inhibition of lever presses for food elicited by the delivery of an electric shock at every eighth press; (3) muscimol (0.125--0.5 mg . kg-1 i.p.) failed to attenuate the inhibitory effects on responding induced by the suppression of the reinforcement during extinction. Contrastingly, diazepam (2 mg . kg-1 i.p. 30 min before testing) was found to reduce each type of behavioral inhibition. These data lend no support to the hypotheses of GABA control of behavioral inhibition and of GABA involvement in the action of benzodiazepines on inhibition induced by novelty, punishment, or nonreward.", 
    "7": "Four benzodiazepines (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, halazepam, lorazepam) were tested for their effects on the acquisition of a passive-avoidance task in mice. This was done to determine whether amnesic effects, as reported in humans after diazepam and lorazepam, could be demonstrated by blockade of passive-avoidance responding in mice and, if so, to investigate the possible causes of the blockade by studying the relationships between the blockade and times of drug administration. Each of these benzodiazepines, at doses that did not alter overt behavior, blocked acquisition of the passive-avoidance response when they were administered to mice prior to the training session, but not when they were administered after the training session or prior to testing 24 h later. The block of avoidance responding was reversed, however, when the drugs were administered prior to both training and test sessions. These results suggest that state-dependent learning occurred; i.e., apparent amnesia occurred in the test session with untreated mice that had undergone passive-avoidance learning 24 h earlier under the influence of drug.", 
    "8": "Clomipramine used alone is an affective analgesic against organic pain due to a lesion of the peripheral nervous system, in particular post-herpetic pain. The quality of the result is related to the dose, and hence to tolerance. Fluohydrocortisone is the most powerful drug against orthostatic hypotension, the chief cause of limitation of treatment. No complications were seen, even in very elderly patients.", 
    "9": "An investigation was carried out on the effect of the intake of diazepam and alcohol on simple performance tests. The combined administration of diazepam and alcohol led to an increase of the plasma diazepam concentration as compared to that obtained after diazepam without alcohol. Furthermore, after combined intake of diazepam and alcohol a decrease of performance was observed, that was significantly higher, than the effects obtained after either alcohol or diazepam alone. This impairment was especially noticeable duirng the first hour of the experiment, i.e. until the plateau of the diazepam plasma concentration was reached, while afterwards a correlation between diazepam plasma concentration and impairment of performance could not be established. The relevance of these findings for the interpretation of diazepam plasma concentrations in relation to the impairment of performance are discussed.", 
    "10": "The post-mortem blood specimens of 389 forensic autopsies were analyzed for diazepam. The age of the cases investigated was above 10 years and the survival time was less than 12 hours. Eighteen samples corresponding to 4.6% were found to be diazepam-positive. These 18 samples were distributed equally between men and women. The proportion of diazepam-positive samples was increased in the groups of suicide and poisoning (alcohol and opiates). The association between diazepam intake and poisoning was statistically highly significant. No correlation was found between diazepam intake and age. Alcohol was found to occur significantly more often in the group of the diazepam positive cases as compared to the diazepam negative group.", 
    "11": "Thirteen patients with acute dystonia and extrapyramidal symptoms as a result of drug intoxication are reported. In a number of instances, the symptoms were due to more than one drug being given to the patient, among which were phenothiazine derivatives, non-phenothiazine tranquilizers and metoclopramide. Diazepam (Valium) given intravenously caused the patients to fall asleep immediately and to wake within an hour, free from all symptoms. It is felt that in patients with drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms, diazepam should be considered as the possible drug of choice.", 
    "12": "A patient with the clinical and electroencephalographic features of dialysis encephalopathy exhibited dramatic improvement with the initiation of diazepam therapy. Although improvement was sustained for a period of several weeks, her clinical condition eventually deteriorated despite continued treatment with diazepam and dialysis. Dialysis encephalopathy in this patient is compared with other cases recently reported in the medical literature as having a similar dramatic response to diazepam. It is concluded that diazepam transiently reverses a component of the dialysis encephalopathy syndrome, but it does not appear to change the ultimate prognosis for patients with this condition.", 
    "13": "A case of idiopathic unilateral (left) idiopatic basal ganglia calcification with associated extrapiramidal controlateral symptoms is described. The patient, a 20 years old man, showed since childhood a progressive motor impairment of his right limbs more obvious in his arms. Neurological examination showed hypertonia, distonia, motor and other extrapiramidal impairments of his right limbs. Skull X Ray and CT scan revealed left basal ganglia calcification. Laboratory investigations excluded all the common diseases with basal ganglia calcifications: tumors, tiroid and paratiroid disorders, parassites, vascular, inflammatory or degenerative diseases. Psycodiagnostic tests did not reveal relevant abnormalities. We cannot say with certainty that this is a sporadic case as we were unable to examine the whole family. Slight improvement of symptoms was obtained using orfenadrine and diazepam.", 
    "14": "The relatively clear and compact picture of an electroencephalographic classification of psychotropic substances becomes extremely more complex if the influence of personality traits and topographic differentiations in the EEG are taken into account. Using the example of EEG alterations under diazepam, amitriptyline, pyritinol, EMD 21-657 and caffeine, the complex structure of substance effects, personality factors, topographical differentiations, placebo reactivity and spontaneous circadian variability of the EEG is demonstrated.", 
    "15": "A study of 46 patients has shown that Clonazepam is an effective drug in preventing attacks of pain in essential trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia and in Sluder's syndrome. The therapeutic action of the drug is less evident in different types of migraine, among which only the combined headache presents good results to the treatment. The effective dose of this drug is generally not greater than 3 mg/die and does not give rise to side effects in long-term prescription.", 
    "16": "The effects of osmotic opening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) on local cerebral glucose utilization (LCGU) were studied in rats with the carbon 14-deoxyglucose method. The BBB was opened to Evans blue dye by unilateral carotid artery perfusion with hypertonic mannitol solution. (14C)-Deoxyglucose was injected 15 minutes or two to three hours later. Osmotic opening of the BBB resulted in focal areas of intense LCGU in affected areas of the perfused hemisphere. In the contralateral hemisphere, glucose utilization was diminished, especially in cerebral cortical areas. The effects were reversible. LCGU was normal in both hemispheres when permeability to Evans blue returned to normal two to three hours after carotid artery perfusion. In 3 of 5 experiments the administration of high doses of intravenous diazepam immediately following carotid artery perfusion with mannitol prevented an increase in LCGU in the perfused hemisphere but did not prevent lowering of LCGU in the contralateral hemisphere. Increased LCGU following osmotic opening of the BBB was not accompanied by a rise in local cerebral blood flow as measured by the iodoantipyrine method. Blood flow was, in fact, significantly decreased.", 
    "17": "Among 2,299 patients on whom first-trimester abortions were performed after administration of local anesthesia, 97 per cent reported experiencing some degree of pain. Independent ratings of the pain severity were obtained from the patients and also from the doctors and counselors who observed them. Although the rating procedures used by patients from those used by doctors and counselors, the three sources agreed significantly in evaluating pain levels of individual patients. Data from all three sources indicated that pain produced during the abortion procedure tended to be minor in severity. The ranking of relative painfulness of the eight stages of the aborton procedure based on average ratings obtained from doctors was nearly identical to that based on average ratings obtained from counselors. (Patients did not rate the separate stages.) On average, the patients rated the pain as being less than earache or toothache, but more than headache or bachache. The youngest patients experienced the most pain, and the oldest experienced the least. Both gestational age and cervical dilatation were related to pain in a curvilinear fashion, i.e., for both variables, patients in extreme categories experienced more pain than those in intermediate categories. Preprocedure fearfulness was positively related to intraoperative pain. No support was found for the expectation that oral administration of 5 mg. of diazepam reduces pain during this procedure.", 
    "18": "In order to quantify the pain associated with first trimester abortions and to analyze its influences, patient observations by doctors and attending counselors and patient interviews were conducted. Of the 2299 patients, 86% received 20 cc of lidocaine as paracervical anesthesia (14% received less) and 76% choose to receive 5 mg oral diazepam preoperatively (4% received 3-8 intravenously during the procedure). Patients compared their pain with other familiar types of pain. Doctors and counselors rated the pain during each of 8 specific stages of the abortion (examination, speculum insertion, tenaculum placement, administration of paracervical local anesthesia, uterine sounding, cervical dilatation, vacuum aspiration, and sharp curettage) as compared with the average pain they had observed. In addition, counselors rated the degree of apprehension with which the patient faced the procedure. These methods were analyzed on the basis of internal consistency among each group and agreement across the 3 sources and were found to be sufficiently dependable for the purpose at hand. The pain most often experienced was less severe than an earache or toothache, more severe than a menstrual pain or headache. Physicians and counselors agreed that vacuum aspiration is the most painful stage followed by dilatation and sharp curettage. Pain was positively associated with 1) age of 15 years or less, 2) with gestation of less than 7 weeks or more than 12 and with dilatation on a curvilnear basis, and 3) with patient fear. Despite expectations to the contrary, administration of 5 mg oral diazepam did not reduce pain.", 
    "19": "Nonketotic hyperglycinemia is an inborn error of metabolism resulting from a defect in the glycine cleavage enzyme system. It is characterized biochemically by elevated concentrations of glycine in blood, spinal fluid, and urine. Previous therapies which have been directed toward reducing the glycine concentration in plasma and CSF have not been successful in preventing neurological deterioration, which may be the result of the role of glycine as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Strychnine treatment was initiated because it is a specific antagonist of glycine at postsynaptic membranes. The patient reported here has shown clinical and EEG improvement while taking strychnine in conjunction with sodium benzoate.", 
    "20": "In experiments on rats it was shown that the neuroleptics droperidol (0.6 mg/kg) and aminazin (10 mg/kg) can potentiate the analgetic action of the endogenous morphine-like pentapeptide leucin-enkephalin administered into the brain ventricles at a dose of 50 micrograms. A statistically significant increase in the analgetic activity lf leucin-enkephalin given at a dose of 100 micrograms was induced only by droperidol. The tranquilizer diazepam (5 mg/kg) had no effect on the action lf leucin-enkephalin. Naloxon (2 mg/kg) removed the analgetic effect of leuchin-enkephalin administered both alone and after a preliminary injection od droperidol or aminazin.", 
    "21": "Metrizamide is a water-soluble, nonionic radiocontrast medium that penetrates better into narrow subarachnoid spaces than do oily contrast media or gas. We performed metrizamide optic nerve thecography on five cats with iatrogenic orbital lesions. Optic thecograms successfully demonstrated displacement of the optic nerve, obstruction of the optic nerve sheath subarachnoid space, and extravasation of the contrast medium from a punctured optic nerve sheath. Metrizamide-induced seizures could be prevented by intramuscular preadministration of diazepam.", 
    "22": "Plasma concentrations of barbital and diazepam were measured daily during a double-blind study of the efficacy of the two drugs in the treatment of delirium tremens and less severe clinical states. Treatment was estimated as satisfactory in the majority of cases; the present study deals with the satisfactory groups only. Both in the barbital group and in the diazepam group the same plasma level was seen in different clinical states. This result is discussed in relation to the theories about the aetiology of delirium tremens, and it is concluded that the data fits best with the assumption that delirium tremens is released from a withdrawal state, but once established, the delirious state is not interrupted by the drugs. The barbital concentrations were rather high, many at a level where non-alcoholics would show pronounced intoxication symptoms not seen in the present material. The diazepam concentrations on the other hand were low, often below a level where a cerebral effect is measurable in normal subjects. On this basis it is concluded, that the two drugs have different modes of action. Barbital may act by its cross-dependence properties with alcohol and thus diminish the withdrawal reaction, whereas diazepam may act by its anti-anxiety effect, but not in the doses here applied, by cross-dependence properties with alcohol. Finally, this hypothesis is discussed in relation to clinical experience in the treatment of delirium tremens.", 
    "23": "Partially purified extracts of bovine brain were previously found to inhibit competitively the binding of [3H]-diazepam to rat brain synaptosomal membranes. The purines inosine and hypoxanthine were subsequently identified as the compounds responsible for this inhibitory activity. Intracerebroventricular administration of inosine to mice of the C3H/HEN and NIH general purpose strains caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the latency to clonicotonic seizures produced by intraperitoneal administration of the convulsant pentylenetetrazole. Intracerebroventricular administration of equimolar doses of 2'-deoxyinosine, which is more potent than inosine in inhibiting the binding of [3H]diazepam in vitro, significantly increased pentylenetetrazole-evoked seizure latency. In contrast, both 7-methylinosine and thymidine were ineffective in inhibiting the in vitro binding of [3H]diazepam and increasing the latency to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in vivo. These results suggest that endogenously occurring purines such as inosine exhibit diazepam like effects when administered intracerebroventricularly, and these effects may be related to the interaction of inosine and related compounds with benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system.", 
    "24": "In an attempt to answer questions regarding nerve injection injuries, we injected 11 agents in current use and commonly administered by intramuscular injection into the sciatic nerves of adult Wistar rats. Equal volumes of normal saline were used as control. We harvested the sciatic nerves at various times after injection and examined them by both light and electron microscopy. We performed myelinated nerve fiber counts and constructed histograms. Any impairment of motor function was also noted. We gave injections to 79 animals a total of 158 times; 116 injections were directly into the nerve fascicle (intrafascicular) and 42 were into the epineural tissue (extrafascicular). The results revealed considerable variation in the degree of nerve fiber injury according to the agent injected. Minimal damage resulted from the injection of iron-dextran, meperidine, and cephalothin, and maximal nerve injury followed the injection of penicillin, diazepam, and chlorpromazine. The site of injection was crucial. Intrafascicular injection was invariably associated with severe nerve injury, but, with few exceptions, extrafascicular injection resulted in minimal damage. The quantity of drug injected was also important in determining the degree of injury. Large, heavily myelinated fibers were more susceptible to injection injury than smaller, thinly myelinated nerve fibers. The effect of the injected drug seemed to be related to injury of the nerve fiber unit--both the axon and the Schwann cell with its myelin sheath. Regeneration in damaged nerves was a constant finding; even the most severely injured nerves, with total axonal degeneration, underwent subsequent regeneration.", 
    "25": "It was shown that the phenomenon of inactivation of Na, K-ATPase of the non-purified fraction of the rat cortical synaptosomes under electroshock may be related to \"modification\" of the potassium active center of the enzyme. The anticonvulsant diazepam injected intramuscularly also inhibits Na, K-ATPase of the cerebral membranes. However, in subsequent electrical stimulation of the brain the drug activates Na, K-ATPase as compared to controls. Diazepam also abolishes clonic convulsions induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. At the same time it does not eliminate compensatory shifts in the activity of acetyl-cholinesterase of the rat cerebral and spinal synaptosomes, characteristic of electroshock. The results are discussed from the standpoint that inhibition of the activity of Na, K-ATPase of the nerve endings membranes may underlie the pathogenetic mechanism of the convulsive activity.", 
    "26": "In a sample of middle class individuals seeking martial and sexual counseling, 30% had diagnosable psychiatric illness, including 14% who had depressions at the time of interview. Those with psychiatric syndromes were significantly more likely to have prescribed psychoactive than those without these syndromes. Those with depression were more likely to have received diazepam and similar drugs than antidepressants. The same was true for those with other syndromes but in many of these cases, diazepam or other antianxiety agents seemed more appropriate. Thus, affective disorder might well be the psychiatric syndrome for which these drugs are most often inappropriately prescribed. Inappropriate treatment is a matter of concern in an illness which is potentially fatal.",

    "28": "Mogadon as a parenteral solution was employed for treating status epilepticus (15 cases), intermitent epileptic seizures (10 cases), Lennox syndrome (14 cases), myoclonic seizures (5 cases) and absences (6 cases). The dosage layed between 3,3 mg and 10 mg according to each individual case. Status epilepticus and intermitent seizures disappeared following the injection and so did the irritative EEG alterations. Remission was observed in 10 Lennox cases while the remaining 4 improved. Mogadon abolished myoclonic seizures, in some cases beyond 6 hours. In simple absence improvement was also evident, although more shortlived than in myoclonic seizures. Sleepiness was side-effect, occurring in some cases.", 
    "29": "Behavioral effects and blood or plasma levels of d-amphetamine, ethanol, cocaine, and diazepam were examined in rhesus monkeys treated chronically with alpha-l-acetylmethadol (LAAM), methadone, or vehicle. Chronic treatment with the opiates failed to alter blood or plasma levels and behavioral effects of d-amphetamine or ethanol. LAAM-maintained monkeys were somewhat less sensitive to rate-decreasing effects of cocaine on schedule-controlled responding, but cocaine plasma levels and half-lives generally did not differ across the chronic treatment conditions. Behavioral depression after diazepam was prolonged substantially in LAAM- and methadone-maintained monkeys, but blood levels of diazepam and metabolites were not increased prolonged in those animals. Naloxone partially antagonized the residual depression LAAM- and methadone-maintained monkeys 24 hr after diazepam, but had no effect on the weaker sesidual depression in vehicle-maintained aniamals. Thus, diazepam appeared to interfere with the metabolic inactivation of the opiates. One LAAM-maintained monkey showed recurrent episodes of LAAM overdose and eventually died during the course of the study.", 
    "30": "Male rats (175 g) were given 30 mg of diazepam in their food daily for 35 days. The animals became drowsy and ataxic from this high dose of drug. After the 35-day dosing, the rats were killed daily, and specific binding of [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam was determined in synaptosomal preparations from these and corresponding control rats. On days 3, 4, 6, and 7 after the treatment period the specific binding and specific binding of [3H]diazepam was double that of the control binding and specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was 1.67 times that of control. The data indicate that very high doses of diazepam, given for long periods, cause increased specific binding of radiolabeled ligand to brain subfractions. The possible mechanisms and implications are discussed. When lower doses or shorter dosage regimens are used, increased binding is not observed.", 
    "31": "Experiments on pyrolaxon-immobilized cats evidence that diazepam produces depression of evoked potentials in the specific, nonspecific and associative brain structures upon an electric stimulation of the visceral and somatic nerves, and also with accoustic and photostimulation; Meprotan (meprobamate) in doses of 40-100 mg/kg neither changes nor increases, and in doses of 100-150 mg/kg, reduces the amplitude of evoked potentials and at the sme time forces down the arterial pressure. Amizyl (benactyzine) inhibits the potentials evoked by stimulation of the vagus. The amplitude of responses arising on stimulation of the inferior cardiac, celiac and sciatic nerves, and also with acoustic and photostimulation neither changes nor increases.", 
    "32": "Two new 1,5 benzodiazepines have been evaluated acutely as anticonvulsants in baboons, Papio papio, with photosensitive epilepsy. BAU 426 (8-Chlor-6-[2-chlorphenyl]-4H-s-triazolo-[4,3-a] [1,5-benzodiazepin-5-[6-H]on) and BAU 500 (analogue of BAU 426 with [2-trifluor methylphenyl] substituted for [2-chlorphenyl]), 0.1--5.0 mg/kg, were administered i.v. to baboons with and without priming with D,L allylglycine. BAU 426 or BAU 500, 0.1--0.2 mg/kg, produced partial or transient protection against photically induced myoclonus or epileptic responses. Complete protection, in the absence of signs of sedation or acute neurological toxicity, was seen 1--4 h after 0.5--2 mg/kg. EEG changes typical of benzodiazepines were seen for 1--3 h and clinical signs of sedation with some muscular hypotonia were evident for 1 h after either drug, 5 mg/kg. Clinical trials are required to determine if these compounds are superior to 1,4 benzodiazepines as anticonvulsants.", 
    "33": "The effects of intravenous flunitrazepam (Rohypnol, Roche) on various body functions were studied and the following conclusions were reached: it is a very potent sedative/hypnotic even in small doses, it may cause depression of spontaneous breathing, it does not give rise to raised cerebrospinal fluid or intra-ocular pressure, it does not adversely affect renal function, and it can be used quite safely in combination with fentanyl or pentazocine in anaesthetic practice.", 
    "34": "Muscimol induced in rats a recall deficit which possibly results from a dissociation of learning. In one out of the 2 experimental conditions studied, a cross dissociation of learning was found between diazepam and muscimol.", 
    "35": "The reaction of the antitumor antibiotic anthramycin with cellular DNA and the ability of normal human fibroblasts cells and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells to respond to this injury has been evaluated. The binding of [15-3H]anthramycin to cellular DNA in human skin fibroblasts occurred in a linear manner up to 6 h. Treatment with unlabeled antibiotic resulted in unscheduled (repair) DNA synthesis in human skin fibroblasts maintained in hydroxyurea, whereas negligible unscheduled DNA synthesis was observed in cells of an excision-defective strain of XP. Confluent nondividing normal skin fibroblast cells were able to remove 86% of the bound anthramycin within 72 h, however XP cells were only able to remove 49% during the same incubation period. These results are discussed in terms of the types of DNA damage produced by anthramycin in vitro and the likely repair pathways involved in removing lesions produced on DNA by anthramycin.", 
    "36": "A double-blind controlled therapeutic trial of factorial design was used to study the therapeutic effects of lorazepam, hyoscine butylbromide, and ispaghula husk in 12 randomised blocks of eight patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Each of the three agents caused a sustained symptomatic improvement in some of the patients, although only with ispaghula was the difference between the real and dummy preparation statistically significant. When the eight possible combinations of treatment were analysed none of the 12 patients who received only dummy preparations of the three agents had maintained any improvement over the three months of the trial. Seven patients improved among the 12 who received potent preparations of all three agents, and between four and six patients improved in the groups receiving one or two of the potent preparations. These therapeutic results, though far from perfect, show that the types of drug commonly used to treat IBS are of some value and may be additive in their effects. Similar combinations of other therapeutic agents may be more effective, but it will be possible to determine this only by carrying out factorial therapeutic trials.", 
    "37": "In a seven months old infant with a history of obstructive bronchitis, hypsarrhythmia was found to be the cause of symptoms mimicking pertussis with recurrent apnoea. Morphological cerebral abnormalities could not be detected. Clonazepam showed a prompt and persistent therapeutic effect.", 
    "38": "A double-blind, controlled clinical trial of chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam and placebo was conducted in 65 outpatients with past histories of temper outbursts, assaultive behaviour and impulsiveness associated with anxiety, irritability and hostility. Of those tests showing statistically significant results, there was a tendency for oxazepam to be somewhat more effective in the reduction of anxiety than chlordiazepoxide. Oxazepam was also superior to the latter on 1 subscale of tests used to measure hostility. No paradoxical rage responses were noted.", 
    "39": "1. Chlordiazepoxide (Cdp, 1 to 100 micrometer) enhanced the inhibitory action of externally applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) upon spontaneous spike discharges in guinea-pig cerebellar slices; the actions of externally applied beta-alanine and taurine, but not externally applied glycine, were also enhanced by Cdp. 2. It was suggested the Cdp might exert its action by enhancing the increase of membrane permeability to K+ induced by the amino acid, but not to Cl-. 3. Cdp (5 to 100 micrometer) reversed the antagonism of picrotoxin to the inhibitory action of externally applied GABA and also the antagonism of strychnine to the actions of externally applied beta-alanine and taurine. 4. The inhibition of the spontaneous spike discharges of Purkinje cells, evoked by electrical stimulation of the slice, was also enhanced by Cdp (10 to 100 micrometer). 5. The blocking action of picrotoxin (10 to 20 micrometer) on the stimulus-evoked inhibition of spike discharges was reversed by Cdp (10 micrometer). 6. In a similar manner, strychnine (10 or 20 micrometer) was also found to block the stimulus-evoked inhibition of spike discharges. It is suggested that in the cerebellum strychnine-sensitive amino acid(s) may be involved in synaptic transmission. Strychnine blockade was also reversed by Cdp (10 micrometer).",

Antipyrine, an analgesic and antipyretic drug, is extensively metabolized by oxidation at various sites and oxazepam, a benzodiazepine, is almost exclusively metabolized by conjugation with glucuronic acid. Comparing the plasma clearance rates and the plasma half lives of the two drugs, correlation coefficients of r = 0.766 (P less than 0.01) and r = 0.966 (P less than 0.01) have been obtained. The data suggests that in man the processes of oxidation and glucuronidation are linked by a common control which regulates the metabolic rates of the two reactions.", 
    "41": "Rats on days 12--14 of pregnancy were treated with restraint stress alone (9h daily), restraint stress plus diazepam (1 mg/kg, twice daily), diazepam alone, or left as untreated controls. Postnatal development and behaviour was assessed on a wide-ranging battery of tests. Offspring of mothers subjected to restraint stress alone were significantly retarded on a number of developmental measures including growth, ear-opening, cliff avoidance response, auditory startle response and mid-air righting reflex. When adult these offspring also showed significantly impaired learning ability in a swimming maze. However, the rate of development and learning ability in the restraint plus diazepam or diazepam alone groups was comparable to or slightly advanced of that in untreated controls. It is concluded that concurrent administration of a low dose of the tranquiliser diazepam during restraint stress prevents the adverse postnatal effects of maternal restraint stress.", 
    "42": "Pigeons were intermittently given grain reinforcement for key pecks. Occasional 30-sec keylight changes (warning stimulus) were followed by a brief electric shock, which suppressed responding during the warning stimuli. This suppression was reduced by diazepam and ethanol, yet combinations of the two drugs did not reduce suppression (antagonistic effect). Each drug reduced responding in the absence of the warning stimulus, and combinations of the drug produced still greater reductions in this safe-period responding (synergistic effect).", 
    "43": "A case of intermittent spasm of the oculo-palpebral motility present features which permit its inclusion among oculogyric crisis. The therapy with clonazepam gave good results supporting the etiological hypothesis of an alteration of the neurons at level of the mesencephalic reticular system.", 
    "44": "66 patients were subjected to nitrous oxide narcosis after various types of premedication. The premedication with phentanyl and seduxen or droperidol proved to be more effective than the routine premidication. The authors consider endotracheal narcosis with nitrous oxide combined with fractional injections of phentanyl and seduxen of phentanyl and droperidol to be a method of choice."
