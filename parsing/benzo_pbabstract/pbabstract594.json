    "0": "An EEG study was carried out in 4 epileptic patients. In each case, Ro 15-1788 caused the disappearance or marked reduction of the epileptic potentials. In 1 case the patient had been pretreated with diazepam; in the other cases there had been no prior benzodiazepine treatment. In the first case, it is possible that Ro 15-1788 acted by abolishing a paradoxical effect of diazepam; in the other cases, we postulate an intrinsic anticonvulsant effect of Ro 15-1788. This investigation would suggest further study of Ro 15-1788 in epileptic patients for clarification of its anticonvulsant properties. In addition, evaluation of its action on the sedation caused by benzodiazepine antiepileptic medication is suggested.", 
    "1": "The effect of diazepam was tested on self-stimulation in 21 mice with a bipolar electrode in lateral hypothalamus (HL), dorsolateral hippocampus (HPC) or lateral entorninal cortex (CEL). Diazepam at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg significantly increased self-stimulation rates in HL while 4 and 8 mg/kg had no significant effect. Similar increases were seen in CEL mice but high doses produced a significant suppression. HPC animals showed a drastic suppression of self-stimulation beginning at 2 mg/kg of diazepam, lower doses having no significant effect. The results demonstrate that entorhinal and hippocampal self-stimulation involve at least partly independent neuronal mechanisms and point to a possible inhibitory influence of HPC and CEL.", 
    "2": "35 patients with a mean seizure frequency of 15 attacks per months were studied. 19 were taking a 2-drug combination, 13 a 3-drug combination and 3 patients a 4-drug combination. Treatment was reduced to monotherapy in 21 patients and to a 2-drug combination in 8 patients. There was an increase in seizure frequency in 6 patients taking a 2-drug combination when an attempt was made to reduce the treatment to monotherapy. Reduction in polypharmacy resulted in an improvement in seizure control in 54% of patients. Carbamazepine replaced polypharmacy as monotherapy in 19 patients and phenytoin and sodium valproate in 2 other patients. Improvement in seizure control was associated with optimal blood levels in 17 patients taking carbamazepine and in the 2 patients taking sodium valproate and phenytoin. Serum levels in all patients taking 2-drug combination were within the optimal range.", 
    "3": "Acquisition of conditioned lever-press avoidance behavior on a continuous avoidance schedule (response-shock interval = 30 s and shock-shock interval = 5 s) and on a discrete avoidance schedule (intertrial interval = 25 s and duration of the warning presentation = 5 s with an escape contingency) in dd mice was investigated. When the behavioral baseline had stabilized, the effects of diazepam on avoidance behaviors were examined. About 60% and 80% of the mice achieved criterion levels of avoidance behavior under continuous avoidance (shock rate being less than 0.5/min) and discrete avoidance (avoidance rate being higher than 75%), respectively. Diazepam (0.5--4 mg/kg SC) dose-dependently impaired avoidance behavior of mice which had a low baseline shock rate and a high baseline avoidance rate under continuous and discrete avoidances, respectively. The changes in avoidance behavior in mice after diazepam were almost identical with those previously found in rats.", 
    "4": "In eight monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops), previously treated with haloperidol for 4-14 months, we have examined the behavioral effect of: (1) methylphenidate vs apomorphine; (2) 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo-(5,4-c)-pyridin-3-ol(THIP, a GABA agonist) vs diazepam; and (3) THIP and diazepam in methylphenidate-induced behavior. Methylphenidate (0.5-5.0 mg/kg) and apomorphine (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) both increased locomotion, but otherwise exhibited different behavioral profiles. Methylphenidate induced repetitive movements of head, limbs, and trunk, and hallucinatory-like behavior, but not oral hyperkinesia (licking and gnawing), whereas apomorphine preferentially caused oral hyperkinesia. THIP produced a syndrome of bradykinesia, dystonia, ataxia, myoclonus, sedation, and decreased responsiveness, whereas diazepam produced only bradykinesia, ataxia, sedation, and decreased responsiveness, but not dystonia and myoclonus. Methylphenidate-induced locomotion and repetitive movements were reduced by THIP and diazepam, whereas hallucinatory-like behavior was markedly aggravated by THIP, but not by diazepam.", 
    "5": "Four patients with cortical myoclonus were studied. All had reflex muscle jerking and grossly enlarged somatosensory evoked responses (SEPs) following electrical stimulation of the digital nerves. In addition, three of the patients had spontaneous or action-induced myoclonus. Back-averaging the EEG from these spontaneous muscle jerks showed a large positive wave over the contralateral somatomotor cortex which preceded the jerk by about 20 ms. Administration of lisuride (0.1 mg iv) reduced the severity of the reflex and spontaneous myoclonus, but had no effect on, or increased the size of the SEP. Two of the patients also received 1 mg clonazepam iv. As with lisuride, the severity of myoclonic jerking was reduced although the size of the SEP was increased. It is concluded that the usual association between giant SEPs and reflex muscle jerking can be abolished by acute administration of lisuride and clonazepam in patients with cortical myoclonus.", 
    "6": "The protein binding of diazepam (D) and its major active metabolite N-desmethyl diazepam (DD) was investigated in vitro in the serum of 14 mothers at birth, 21 foetuses at birth, in 100 neonates between 1 and 11 days of age and in 16 control subjects. The free (unbound) fractions of D and DD in the foetus were similar to those in the controls, but lower than those in the mothers. During the first day of life the free fractions of D and DD doubled in the neonates and subsequently declined slowly to reach near control levels at 1 week of age. The sharp increase and slow decrease of the free fractions of D and DD during the first postnatal week was closely paralleled by sharply increasing and decreasing free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations. Bilirubin and albumin levels were of lower importance in regard to the protein binding of D and DD. These results indicate that the greatly increased FFA levels shortly after birth result in increased free fractions of D and DD. Because of the known immaturity of the neonatal hepatic elimination capacity, these elevated free fractions may result in elevated free concentrations of the two compounds, which may help to explain the adverse effects observed clinically in some D-exposed neonates.", 
    "7": "The pharmacokinetics of oxazepam, a drug mainly eliminated by a single step glucuronidation reaction, were studied in seven hyperthyroid and six hypothyroid patients before and after treatment. Oxazepam elimination half-life was shorter and apparent oral clearance higher in untreated hyperthyroid patients than after treatment. There was no significant change in oxazepam elimination in hypothyroid subjects. Time to peak concentration (tmax) was reduced in the hyperthyroid state. Hypothyroidism had no significant effect on tmax. Serum bilirubin concentration was lower in the patients while hyperthyroid before treatment than when euthyroid and also lower than in the hypothyroid patients. There was no significant correlation between serum bilirubin concentrations and oxazepam elimination. These results suggest that glucuronyl transferase activity is increased in hyperthyroidism but is not altered in most patients with hypothyroidism. The extent of increase in glucuronyl transferase activity is similar to that produced by enzyme inducing drugs.", 
    "8": "Nightly ingestion of diazepam, 10mg, alleviated some or all symptoms of intractable sleepwalking in several otherwise healthy adults. Some other patients did not respond as well. The results of this double-blind, crossover study suggest that diazepam is effective for the treatment of adult sleepwalking in some individuals. Data from this study are consistent with uncontrolled case reports of such treatment. Serious side effects or tolerance to the medication did not develop in any of the subjects studied. Other benzodiazepines, which may be more or less effective, remain unstudied. Psychiatric and social histories of these adult sleepwalkers are consistent with earlier work by the authors, which indicates little evidence for an association between uncomplicated sleepwalking and serious psychopathology.", 
    "9": "Neurotransmitters and neuromodulators involved in the function of vestibular nuclei were reviewed with special reference to drugs used for treatment of motion sickness and vertigo. Biochemical, histochemical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated that acetylcholine is a transmitter candidate from the afferent vestibular nerve to the lateral vestibular nucleus (LVN), because acetylcholine satisfies most criteria for a chemical transmitter in the central nervous system. It is unlikely, however, that monoamines such as noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin are transmitters in the vestibular neurons, since cell bodies and nerve terminals containing the monoamines have not been detected yet in the vestibular nuclei. Although histamine and H1-receptor blockers inhibit neuron activities in the vestibular nuclei, it is unclear at present whether histaminergic system is directly related to the function of vestibular neurons. It has been established that GABA is an inhibitory transmitter from the cerebellar Purkinje cells to the LVN neurons. Diazepam is considered to enhance the GABA effect on the LVN, thereby modifying the vestibular neuronal firing. Enkephalin-containing cell bodies and nerve terminals are found in the medial vestibular nucleus, and a few substance P-containing neurons have been observed in the vestibular nuclei. However, the functional role of these peptides on the vestibular system remains to be determined. Unlike histamine H1-receptor blockers, vasodilators such as cinnarizine, ifenprodil and adenosine triphosphate, which are effective in treatment of vertigo, produce an enhancement of responsiveness of neuron activities in the vestibular nuclei, probably as a result of an increase in blood flow in the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "10": "A new formulation of oxazepam especially designed to increase the speed of absorption and eliminate the need to use water (freeze-dried dosage formulation; FDDF) was compared in double-blind and crossover conditions with the standard tablets of the same compound. 5 inpatients with generalized anxiety disorder received at 1-week intervals a single 30 mg dose of one of the compounds. Every 8 min for 96 min after drug intake, they completed a battery of visual analogue scales and had an EEG recording with computerized spectral analysis. Results showed a significantly more rapid onset of activity of FDDF oxazepam for both the self-reports of anxiety level (p less than 0.005) and the specific beta 2 EEG changes (p less than 0.0001), which were significantly correlated (r = -0.73; p less than 0.01). Moreover, all patients rated FDDF oxazepam as having faster onset of action in clinical change than regular tablets (p less than 0.05). This study shows the value of visual analogue scales, pharmaco-EEG, and crossover design in well-selected anxious inpatients in substantiating clinical differences between anxiolytic pharmacotherapies.", 
    "11": "The gastric cytoprotective effects of vitamin A, De-Nol and sucralfate were compared with the effectiveness of pirenzepine in healing ulcer in patients with chronic gastric ulcer. A total of 100 patients was randomized into different groups: the patients were treated with antacids, vitamin A (3 X 50.000 IU), De-Nol liquid (4 X 5 ml), sucralfate (4 X 1 g) or pirenzepine (3 X 50 mg). The treatment was continued for 4 weeks. At the beginning, 2 and 4 weeks after starting treatment the patients were subjected to endoscopy and the size of the ulcer was measured planimetrically. The ulcer-healing effect of De-Nol liquid was significantly better than that of the antacids (p less than 0.01). Ulcer size was reduced significantly in all groups (p less than 0.01), however, at the end of the study the gastric ulcers were smallest in the De-Nol treated group (p less than 0.001). The dynamics of ulcer healing in the second week was most favourable in the patients receiving vitamin A (p less than 0.01). The present data point to the cytoprotective effects of De-Nol liquid, vitamin A and sucralfate and to their ability of healing chronic gastric ulcers.", 
    "12": "The efficacy of chlordiazepoxide and tiapride in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal syndrome was compared in a randomized, parallel-group, double-blind trial. The mean daily dose for both preparations on the first two days was four capsules, i.e., 200 mg for chlordiazepoxide and 400 mg for tiapride. Thereafter the patients were treated according to the relief of symptoms obtained. The treatment periods lasted 3-5 days. Both drugs effectively alleviated alcohol withdrawal symptoms, especially anxiety, fear, hallucinations, insomnia, sweating, tremor, abdominal pain and vertigo. Seventy percent of the patients in the chlordiazepoxide and 42% in the tiapride group considered the drug effective. The difference was statistically significant in favour of chlordiazepoxide (p less than 0.05). Tiapride is an alternative drug in the treatment of this condition, if benzodiazepines are to be avoided.", 
    "13": "Both pirenzepine and cimetidine have been shown to be beneficial in the healing of duodenal ulcers. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of 50 mg of pirenzepine BID and 600 mg of cimetidine BID, either alone or in combination, on 24-hour intragastric acidity, nocturnal gastric secretory volume and acid output, and serum gastrin profile in patients with duodenal ulcers. Eight asymptomatic patients with healed duodenal ulcers received placebo, pirenzepine, cimetidine, or cimetidine plus pirenzepine for one week each in a sequential order. All measurements were performed over a 24-hour period on the last day of each treatment week. Compared with pirenzepine, cimetidine was associated with lower hydrogen ion (H+) activities after breakfast, during the night, and over the 24-hour period. Pirenzepine alone failed to suppress H+, but the combination of cimetidine plus pirenzepine resulted in more prolonged acid suppression, with lower H+ after lunch, than did cimetidine alone. The effect of cimetidine on the suppression of nocturnal acid secretory volume and acid output was further enhanced by the addition of pirenzepine. The fasting serum gastrin concentrations were similar in all treatments, excluding one patient with antral G-cell hyperplasia; the postprandial gastrin responses were similarly higher with cimetidine and cimetidine plus pirenzepine than with pirenzepine. The findings suggest an added benefit of combination therapy with cimetidine and pirenzepine that may be useful in patients who fail to respond to single-agent therapy.", 
    "14": "Since 1978 the Swedish catalogue of registered pharmaceutical specialties (FASS) has carried a special section entitled \"Pregnancy and breast-feeding\" in each product presentation, intended to form an aid for the prescription of drugs to women during childbearing and lactation. After a brief review of transplacental transport and milk secretion, reproduction-toxicology studies in animals, and methods for clinical evaluation of drugs for use during pregnancy, the classification system is presented. On the basis of available data with regard to effects on early and late stages of pregnancy and labour, all the pharmaceutical specialties concerned are assigned to one of the following pregnancy categories: A, B 1, B 2, B 3, C or D. The letters refer to information based on findings in man, and the figures to information based on animal data. For drugs in categories B 3, C or D any harmful effects observed or likely to occur in man or animals are to be specified. The pregnancy categories are defined as follows: Category A. Drugs which may be assumed to have been used by a large number of pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, without any form of definite disturbance in the reproductive process having been noted so far, e.g. an increased incidence of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus. Category B. Drugs which may be assumed to have been used by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, without any form of definite disturbance in the reproduction process having been noted so far, e.g. an increased incidence of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus. Category C. Drugs which by their pharmacological effects have caused, or must be suspected of causing disturbances in the reproduction process that may involve risk to the fetus without being directly teratogenic. Category D. Drugs which have caused an increased incidence of fetal malformations or other permanent damage in man or which on the basis of e.g. reproduction-toxicology studies must be suspected of doing so. This category comprises drugs with primary teratogenic effects. If the drug also has pharmacological effects that may directly or indirectly have a harmful effect on the fetus, this must also be stated. As experience of effects of drugs in Category B is limited, results of reproduction-toxicology studies in animals are indicated by allocation to one of three subgroups according to the following definitions: Category B 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "15": "Since 1978, the Swedish catalogue of registered pharmaceutical preparations (FASS) has classified drugs in terms of their effects on reproduction and breastfeeding. On the basis of available data concerning effects on pregnancy and labor, pharmaceutical specialties are asigned to 1 of the following pregnancy categories: A--drugs that have been used by large numbers of pregnant women and women of childbearing age with no evidence of any disturbance in the reproductive process; B--drugs that have been used by only a limited number of pregnant and reproductive age women, yet have not been noted to cause any harmful effects on fetal development; C--drugs whose pharmacological effects are suspected to cause disturbances in the reproductive process that may involve risk to the fetus without being directly teratogenic; and D--drugs that, on the basis of reproduction-toxicology studies, are suspected to have caused an increased incidence of fetal malformations. Of the 675 active substances identified in the drugs included in FASS 1984, 205 have been allocated to Category A, 183 to Category A, 183 to Category B, 118 to Category C, and 70 to Category D. Category C includes beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents, benzothiadiazines and related diuretics, dicoumarl, sufonamides, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, glucocorticoids, antithyroid substances, benzodiazepines, narcotic analgetics, ergotamine, and inhibitors of prostglandin synthesis; Category D includes ethanol, quinine and quinidine, chloroquine and hydroxycloroquine, warfarin, cytostatic drugs, tetracyclines, aminoglycosides, androgens and other anabolic steriods, gestagens, diethylstilbestrol, penicillamine, phenobarbital, and anticonvulsants. With respect to use during breastfeeding, drugs are allocated to the following 4 groups: Group I--does not enter breast milk; Group II--enters breast milk but is unlikely to affect the infant; Group III--enters breast milk in such quantities that there is risk of affecting the infant; and Group IV--not known whether it enters breast milk. Group IV comprises over 50% of the drugs listed.", 
    "16": "This study evaluated the analgesic efficacy of baclofen in relation to specific pain stimuli in 83 women (27 nulliparas and 56 multiparas) undergoing voluntary abortion (clamping of the cervix and dilatation and curettage). The patient population was divided into five treatment groups as follows: group 1, placebo; group 2, baclofen, 0.3 mg/kg, administered intravenously (IV); group 3, baclofen, 0.6 mg/kg IV; group 4, baclofen, 0.3 mg/kg IV, and fentanyl, 1.5 mg IV; and group 5, baclofen, 0.3 mg/kg IV, and diazepam, 5 mg given orally and 5 mg IV. In each case the surgical intervention was started using analgesia only. When the first sensation of pain was recorded, a paracervical anesthetic block was performed to provide pain relief for completion of the operation. The results showed that baclofen had significantly better analgesic properties than did placebo, with no important side effects. Its analgesic action seemed to be dose-dependent, since better results were obtained with the higher dose. The analgesic effect was slightly potentiated when baclofen was combined with fentanyl, but not when it was combined with diazepam. Factors independent of the pain stimuli and drugs used--the most important being parity--influenced the results.", 
    "17": "To examine whether and how muscarinic or serotoninergic properties might contribute to the hormone stimulating action of the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide, the effect of oral single-dose pretreatment with pirenzepine (Gastrozepin) 50 mg, a muscarinic antagonist, pizotifen (Sandomigran) 1 mg, a serotonin antagonist, or placebo on the responses of prolactin, aldosterone, plasma renin activity (PRA), cortisol (hydrocortisone) and human growth hormone (HGH) to the i.v. injection of metoclopramide 10 mg was studied in 6 young healthy volunteers. For comparison, a mere placebo study was added. Whereas aldosterone response to metoclopramide and PRA remained unchanged, prolactin response was decreased by pizotifen from 43 +/- 6.5 to 24 +/- 9 ng/ml, p less than 0.05. Pizotifen decreased base-line cortisol from 10.5 +/- 0.5 to 6.6 +/- 0.6 microgram/dl and prevented the increase in cortisol after metoclopramide in responsive subjects. Both pizotifen and pirenzepine decreased HGH responsiveness to metoclopramide. It is concluded that cortisol and, partly, prolactin stimulation by metoclopramide are due to its serotoninergic properties and that HGH responsiveness to metoclopramide becomes explainable by both the serotoninergic and muscarinic potencies of the drug.", 
    "18": "A rational management of alcoholic patients requires an understanding of alcohol interactions with other drugs. In this discussion, the influence of alcohol on benzodiazepine and cocaine metabolism is examined. The effect of alcohol may be indirect by producing liver disease and secondary impairment of drug metabolism, or direct following acute or chronic alcohol administration. The acute administration of alcohol suppresses the oxidative metabolism of chlordiazepoxide and diazepam and their principal metabolites. This finding may account partly for the enhanced psychomotor impairment following combined benzodiazepine-alcohol ingestion. The conjugation of lorazepam is also decreased, but for unclear reasons that of oxazepam remains normal. Data are insufficient to establish the effect of chronic alcohol administration on benzodiazepine disposition, especially in man. On the other hand, with respect to cocaine, chronic alcohol exposure causes induction of hepatic microsomal enzyme activity and enhances the production of metabolites that prove injurious to the liver, thereby augmenting the hepatotoxic effect of alcohol.", 
    "19": "Anxiolytic effects and tolerance of a four weeks treatment with prazepam (single dose of 40 mg in the evening) and with lorazepam (3 daily doses of 1.25 mg) are compared in a double blind study. Patients were treated by psychiatrists and were suffering from neurotic anxiety. Evaluation for therapeutic efficacy used a clinical global improvement scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. Evaluation for side effects used the side effects symptoms check list. Anxiolytic effects of prazepam and lorazepam are not significantly different. Tolerance of the two treatments is comparable. The side effects are essentially an undesirable sedative action.", 
    "20": "The effects of oral doses of diazepam (single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg/day for 2 weeks) and propranolol (single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg/day for 2 weeks) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and agoraphobia were investigated in a double-blind, randomized and crossover design. Both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than propranolol. Delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not differ. Patients tapped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than propranolol. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients tested 5-8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of performance. These results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjects. Accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged behavioral impairment.", 
    "21": "A theoretical and practical scheme for the measurement of change in psychological performance is presented. An information processing paradigm is used as the basis for the model while personality, memory, motivational and experiential variables are shown to be amenable to control via the application of standard experimental methodologies. The model is realised in practical experimental terms in the use of measures of choice reaction time and critical flicker fusion threshold. The reliability and sensitivity of these parsimonious indices of performance change is illustrated in a brief review of the effects of benzodiazepine hypnotics on early morning performance.", 
    "22": "Over the last 20 years standardized techniques have been employed for the investigation of intravenous hypnotics, psychotropic and neuroleptic drugs. Sleep has been studied with the help of EEG measures and side-effects have been evaluated by psychometric tests. The EEG is a proven parameter with regard to dosage determination and as objective means to find sleep-inducing quantities of drugs. By means of vigilosomnograms we have established dose-effect curves and have made comparisons between related drugs in the form of equivalence studies. From an anaesthesiological point of view controllability of a substance is determined by duration of effect (short- or long-acting) and by depth of sleep (light or deep states) achieved. By these criteria midazolam displays good controllability with regard to duration, but not in terms of depth of sleep, since it follows the \"all-or-nothing\" rule, even with 0.1 mg/kg following both intravenous or intramuscular injection. Lormetazepam, on the other hand, shows good controllability of depth of sleep from tranquillity via sedation to hypnosis, but duration of effect is less well controllable in that patients remain lightly asleep even after 2 h. According to the vigilosomnograms the lormetazepam/oxygen/nitrous oxide combination produced a super-added increase in the depth of the hypnotic effect. After droperidol the specific nitrous oxide component of the depth of sleep at Bo stage was not exceeded. The development of benzodiazepine antagonists, which immediately counteract the benzodiazepine induced sleep and respiratory obstruction is a milestone in the area of CNS research.", 
    "23": "Most people attribute a restorative function to sleep. This is because experimental or clinical sleep disturbance is usually followed by annoying symptoms of fatigue and sleepiness the following day. Can these daytime changes be documented objectively? In the past several years, the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) has been developed and validated as an objective quantitative measure of sleepiness. Multiple assessments of sleep latency yield a profile of sleepiness across the day. This profile changes in the predicted direction with acute total and partial sleep deprivation, chronic sleep deprivation, sleep satiation, and in comparisons between hypersomnia patients and controls. Sleep and wakefulness are complementary phases in the daily cycle of human existence. Adequacy of sleep and energetic wakefulness next day are interacting phases in this cycle. Insomnia can be seen as a perception of disturbed sleep with daytime consequences, but is essentially also a symptom. This paper reviews a number of issues in the diagnosis and treatment of insomnia. The dimensions, daytime consequences and longitudinal aspects of insomnia are considered. Most investigations to date have been geared towards the problem of chronic insomnia and yet we are all likely to suffer from transient insomnia at some point. Psychiatric and psychophysiological disorders have been shown to be the most frequent causes of disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep. Moreover, there is an apparent disparity between subjective and objective sleep parameters with, for example, objectively disturbed sleep in noncomplaining subjects. The criteria of hypnotic efficacy and the effects of triazolam and flurazepam on sleep and daytime alertness have been investigated in normals, chronic insomniacs and the elderly. In general, chronic insomniacs showed all degrees of daytime alertness regardless of nocturnal sleep parameters. About one-third could be classified as fully alert all day long in spite of their complaints. The effect of flurazepam and triazolam on sleep (improvement) was essentially the same. Daytime effects were most closely related to half-life. The long-acting benzodiazepine, flurazepam, impaired daytime alertness although nocturnal sleep was improved. Triazolam improved not only nighttime sleep but also daytime alertness.", 
    "24": "Thioridazine was compared with placebo or diazepam or both in 610 elderly, nonpsychotic inpatients in geriatric wards of state hospitals or nursing homes. All patients manifested disruptive and difficult-to-manage behavior that interfered with adjustment to their environment and with proper care and treatment of their medical and emotional problems. Target symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, tension, apprehension, depressed mood, and sleep disturbances showed consistently marked improvement throughout the four-week study, as measured by the modified Hamilton Anxiety Scale, the modified Nurses' Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE), and global ratings. Significantly greater improvement on all measures was achieved with thioridazine than with placebo. In addition, greater improvement in the majority of symptoms assessed by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and NOSIE were seen in patients who received thioridazine than in those given diazepam.", 
    "25": "Lormetazepam (1 and 2 mg) was tested against flurazepam (30 mg) and placebo in 60 patients (15 per treatment group) with initial, intermediate, or late insomnia. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment groups, and a double-blind protocol was followed. The four-week study included one week of use of the placebo, followed by two weeks of treatment with the active drug (in three groups) or continued use of the placebo (one group), and one week of use of the placebo (all four groups). Results showed that the active drugs were efficient in controlling insomnia. In some subjective parameters, only 2 mg of lormetazepam was significantly better than placebo. Tolerability of the drugs was considered good, with no interruption of treatment required because of adverse reactions. There was a rebound effect in one patient receiving 1 mg of lormetazepam and in three patients receiving flurazepam.", 
    "26": "In a Finnish general practice 120 patients with psychosomatic disorders, manifest as syndromes of tension headache, cardiac neurosis, dizziness or muscular tension, were randomly allocated to treatment over a 4-week period with either flupenthixol (1 to 2 mg per day) or diazepam (5 to 10 mg mg per day). The 4 syndromes and 12 associated symptoms (anxiety, fatigue, depression, pain, asthenia, muscle fatiguability, tension, dyspnoea, restlessness, palpitations, sleep disorders, and vertigo) were rated on a 4-point scale on entry, at 2 weeks and at 4 weeks. Both drugs reduced significantly the average total scores for syndromes and single symptoms after 2-weeks' treatment. Flupenthixol was the more effective in relieving fatigue and vertigo; diazepam in relieving headache, anxiety, tension, restlessness and sleep disturbance. Cardiac neurosis, palpitations and general muscular tension responded poorly to both drugs. After 4 weeks, relief of vertigo, pain and fatigue was more evident in the flupenthixol group, and of anxiety, tension and restlessness in the diazepam group. Side-effects were complained of at some stage by 17 patients in the flupenthixol group (9 of fatigue, 5 of sleep disturbance, 1 of constipation, 1 of extrapyramidal symptoms, and 1 of weight gain) and by 16 patients in the diazepam group (10 of fatigue, 4 of sleep problems and 2 of diarrhoea).", 
    "27": "A multi-centre, double-blind trial was carried out in general practice to compare the effectiveness and tolerability of clomipramine and diazepam in patients with agoraphobia or social phobia. Patients were allocated at random to receive one or other of the trial drugs over a period of 12 weeks and dosage was adjusted to need. During the last 4 weeks daily dosage ranged from 25 to 150 mg clomipramine and from 10 to 30 mg diazepam. Analysis of results from 33 patients (15 clomipramine, 18 diazepam) showed that clomipramine was significantly superior to diazepam in improving and maintaining improvement in situational anxiety, interference in lifestyle, accompanied travel distance and total score on an agoraphobia inventory. Tolerability of clomipramine was comparable to that of diazepam.", 
    "28": "Randomly taken postmortem urine samples (170) were analyzed by the Emit-dau system for their barbiturate and benzodiazepine content. Of the samples, 23% and 25% were found positive for barbiturate and benzodiazepine, respectively. The percentages of the positive samples were reduced by a heating process to 9% and 11%, respectively. TLC and Emit-st were used for reference procedures. The relative high percentage (above 30%) of the urine samples analyzed exhibited elevated lysozyme activity and protein value. It was found that the disturbing proteins in the Emit-dau system contained not only endogene lysozyme but other thermolabile fractions with higher molecular weight.", 
    "29": "Thirty-six patients with generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks, diagnosed by DSM-III criteria, were treated with a new non-benzodiazepine anti-anxiety drug, buspirone, and with diazepam and placebo, in a cross-over design. Each patient took buspirone, diazepam and placebo for one week each in flexible dosage and balanced order. Ratings of symptomatology using the Comprehensive Psychopathological Rating Scale were made after each week's treatment and a sub-scale used for measuring anxiety change alone was used separately. There was no overall difference in efficacy between the drugs, but when the scores for individual symptoms were analysed, diazepam was significantly superior to the other treatments for the symptom of muscle tension only. The results suggest that the common practice of giving short-term therapy with tranquilising drugs for anxiety in primary care is pharmacologically suspect.", 
    "30": "One of the major changes in the clinical treatment of anxiety has been the substitution of benzodiazepines for less safe sedative-hypnotic drugs. A second major change has been the finding that antidepressants suppress panic attacks. The evidence for this is reviewed in this paper. It appears that panic anxiety is qualitatively different from other kinds of anxiety; this has important implications for diagnosis and treatment. Other clinical issues presented in this symposium are a review of benzodiazepine and new, non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic drugs, the treatment of separation anxiety, and the relationship of mitral valve prolapse to anxiety. Further advances are likely to depend both on our understanding of benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors and on drug models for inducing anxiety. The fact that antidepressants suppress panic attacks, and the ability to produce panic attacks in the laboratory opens up a number of possibilities for the investigation of the physiological basis of panic attacks. All of these topics are taken up in this symposium.", 
    "31": "Clonazepam has been reported to be of some value in the treatment of benign essential tremor in open trials. The efficacy of clonazepam was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study using up to 4 mg/day. By a variety of objective measures, clonazepam was not found to be an effective form of therapy.", 
    "32": "To evaluate the clinical potential of sulpiride for the treatment of schizophrenic patients, a double-blind study was performed comparing fixed doses of sulpiride (800 mg daily) and chlorpromazine (400 mg daily). Twenty-five schizophrenic (RDC) patients participated in each treatment group. Antipsychotic effects were evaluated by CPRS and NOSIE ratings before and after 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. Interrater reliabilities for CPRS items and subscales were satisfactory. Treatment with sulpiride or chlorpromazine resulted in a significant reduction of psychotic morbidity as estimated by CPRS and global ratings. CPRS scores reflecting autism were significantly reduced in all ratings of sulpiride-treated patients, but only after four weeks in the chlorpromazine group. Total NOSIE scores indicated improvement in both treatment groups. A significant difference in favour of sulpiride was obtained for the NOSIE subscale \"retardation\". Extrapyramidal side effects occurred at a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Autonomic side effects occurred to a greater extent in chlorpromazine-treated patients. Lactation was reported only in four sulpiride-treated patients. Liver transaminase enzymes in serum were markedly elevated only in chlorpromazine-treated patients. The results indicate that sulpiride has a marked antipsychotic effect which is at least not inferior to that of chlorpromazine. A better effect on autistic components of behaviour was demonstrated for sulpiride. The results indicate a higher risk of lactation but a lower risk of anticholinergic side effects and liver toxicity for treatment with sulpiride than with chlorpromazine.", 
    "33": "This study examined the feasibility of detecting drugs using saliva samples obtained from impaired drivers. Screening procedures on 1- to 2-mL samples were for cannabinoids, volatiles, benzodiazepines, and other acidic/neutral/basic drugs. Methodology consisted of enzyme multiple immunoassay technique (EMIT) and temperature programmed gas chromatography with confirmation by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Fifty-six samples were obtained from drivers arrested for suspicion of impaired driving. Other than alcohol, the major drugs detected were cannabinoids and diazepam. Cocaine was found in one case.", 
    "34": "The characteristics of vertigo in the pathology of vestibular peripheral lesions are differentiated and described. Symptomatological and clinical aspects are also discussed in the light of the physiopathological mechanisms of vestibular compensation. The therapeutic problem of vertigo is treated on the basis of experimental research on the inhibitory effect of some drugs on the vestibulo-ocular reflex.", 
    "35": "Since Hess's first conclusive experiment of a sleep-inducing effect by median thalamic low-frequency stimulation, many studies have shown that this is due to the activity of the thalamic diffuse projection system. Activation of this system results in an augmentation of thalamo-cortical IPSP. Benzodiazepines, generally considered as GABAergic mediators, increase the system's activity. Therefore it seemed reasonable to postulate a GABAergic transmission within this system. In support of this hypothesis, micro-injections of SL 75.102 (a specific GABAergic agonist) in the rabbit thalamus increase the spindle-rich slow wave sleep, producing a sleep graph similar to those induced by anesthetics. When injected intravenously to rabbits, at doses between 80 and 300 mk/kg, SL 75.102 shows potent anesthetic qualities.", 
    "36": "GABA- modulin , a regulatory component of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, is phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-, Ca/calmodulin-, and Ca/phospholipid-dependent protein kinases at distinct sites in the molecule. Phosphorylation of GM by the cyclic-AMP-dependent process results in a complete loss of GM inhibitory activity on specific 3H-GABA binding to synaptic membrane recognition sites. The effect of the Ca2+-dependent phosphorylation, dependent on CaM or PS, of GM is presently unknown but may involve a synergistic or antagonistic action on the cyclic-AMP-dependent phosphorylation. Alternatively, the Ca2+-dependent protein kinases may regulate another function of GM, perhaps its postulated role as a coupler of the GABA/benzodiazepine recognition sites. The results of these experiments strongly implicate a role for protein phosphorylation in the regulation or modulation of GABA receptor function, and such a mechanism may be extrapolated to other neurotransmitter receptor complexes.", 
    "37": "Both biological aging and chronic exposure to alcohol may cause impaired learning and memory in man and animals. The chains of processes beginning with molecular changes that in turn alter electrophysiology and morphology and finally culminate in changes of behavior (individual and social) are largely unknown. While these chains originating with molecular events leading to the same behavioral end result may be totally different, they may also overlap at any one of these levels of biological organization, accentuate, attenuate each other, to branch again and to develop parallel to each other. There is currently some evidence from observations in humans and animals that both aging and chronic alcohol toxicity induce the following changes: brain atrophy measured in vivo by computerized tomography, histological loss of the dendritic tree of neurons in various brain regions including hippocampus and cerebellum, and a variety of chemical changes of brain synaptic function, such as loss of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "38": "Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a copper-deficient diet for 40 days. Copper-deficient rats weighed significantly (p less than 0.001) less (175 +/- 7 g) than copper-supplemented rats (230 +/- 6 g). Hematocrits were also significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased in deficient as compared to control animals from 43 +/- 0.6 to 30 +/- 2.7%. The binding of 3H-QNB to striatal and cerebellar membrane muscarinic receptors from control and deficient rats increased from 594 +/- 25 to 704 +/- 31 (p less than 0.02) and from 19 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 3 (p less than 0.01) pmol/g protein, respectively. Similarly, 3H-muscimol binding to GABA receptors (cerebellum) also increased from 39 +/- 5 to 58 +/- 3 (p less than 0.02) pmol/g protein. 3H-diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors in deficient versus control animal frontal cortex membranes decreased from 92 +/- 8 to 75 +/- 5 (p less than 0.02) pmol/g protein, respectively. These results may help explain CNS manifestations of copper deficiency.", 
    "39": "In vitro inhibiton of [3H]-diazepam binding to developing rat brain synaptosomal membranes has been studied. Adenosine, inosine, and hypoxanthine display approximately equal potencies as inhibitors of [3H]-diazepam binding to young rat brain membranes. In adult, inosine and hypoxanthine exhibit greater inhibitory potency. Data are also presented which show that the xanthine stimulants caffeine and theophylline competitively inhibit [3H]-diazepam binding with an equal potency throughout the development. In vivo study is also reported which shows that [3H]-diazepam binding to membranes from 5-day-old rats is displaced when female rats have been daily injected with caffeine or theophylline during gestation and lactation.", 
    "40": "The benzodiazepine Ro 5-4864 (60 mg/kg) produced convulsions in mice that could be antagonised either by diazepam (2-4 mg/kg) or by Ro 15-1788 (10-20 mg/kg). In mice and rats subconvulsant doses of Ro 5-4864 were proconvulsant when combined with subconvulsant doses of picrotoxin or pentylenetetrazole. Ro 15-1788 antagonised the tonic convulsions triggered by the drug combinations when it was given at the same time as Ro 5-4864; this antagonism was not observed when the drugs were injected at different times. In contrast to a previous report, we could find no evidence that Ro 5-4864 antagonised seizures induced by electroshock. Using two different ligand-binding techniques, no evidence was seen for the existence in rat brain of the previously reported \"micromolar\" benzodiazepine receptor, a suggested site of action of Ro 5-4864.", 
    "41": "The potencies of seven benzodiazepines (BDZs) were established by three tests: inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding, inhibition of [3H]adenosine uptake, and prevention of pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures in mice. There is a high correlation between the potency for inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding and the antipentylenetetrazol potencies of benzodiazepines (r = 0.941; p less than 0.01). The antipentylenetetrazol potencies of benzodiazepines correlate well with their ability to inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake (r = 0.860; p less than 0.05 and greater than 0.01). However, there is no significant correlation between the potency for the inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam receptor binding and the potency for inhibition of [3H]adenosine uptake (r = 0.751; p greater than 0.05). In addition, there is a marked difference in BDZ potency as measured by these two tests in vitro. The ratios of the Ki values (Ki2/Ki1) range from 98 for BDZ I to 64615 for clonazepam. The data presented indicate that antipentylenetetrazol activity of benzodiazepines results from an interaction between BDZ and nanomolar affinity BDZ receptors.", 
    "42": "3',4'-Dihydroxynomifensine, 8-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-methylisoquinoli ne (1a), is an agonist of dopamine receptors in central and peripheral systems. Since this dopamine receptor agonist bears an asymmetric center at position 4, its synthesis and resolution were undertaken as part of a study directed toward determining the mode of interaction of these agents with the receptor(s). The enantiomers of 3',4'-dihydroxynomifensine are of particular interest, as they provide additional probes of present conceptual models of the dopamine receptor(s). Initial attempts to prepare 1a were inefficient or unsuccessful; instead, an isomeric compound, 1,2,4,5-tetra-hydro-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-4- methyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepine (9), was obtained. For this reason, a new route to 3',4'-dihydroxynomifensine was employed. The racemic dimethoxy intermediate 1d, thus obtained, was resolved. Methoxyl cleavage of the isomers of 1d afforded the enantiomers of 1a. Enantiomeric excess of these antipodes or appropriate derivatives was examined by NMR, CD, and HPLC methods. CD analysis suggests an enantiomeric excess greater than 99%. Determination of the absolute configuration of the enantiomers of 1a was determined by single-crystal X-ray diffractometric analysis. Examination of the isomers in several pharmacological test systems revealed a high degree of enantioselectivity. D-1 dopaminergic activity resides almost exclusively in the S enantiomer. The findings of the study have been employed to suggest an accessory binding site on the dopamine receptor(s) that differs from that advanced earlier. This accessory binding site may be specific for the D-1 subpopulation of dopamine receptors.", 
    "43": "The role of receptors in the central nervous system and effects of aging on the four neurotransmitter receptors most often studied in the context of aging--beta-adrenergic, cholinergic, benzodiazepine, and dopamine--are discussed.", 
    "44": "Scrapie is a transmissible disease that results in progressive degeneration of the central nervous system and death. Although scrapie has been studied histopathologically, relatively little is known concerning neurotransmitter alterations. Specific [3H]muscimol binding to whole brain crude synaptic membranes (CSM) from mice clinically affected with scrapie was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced, to approximately 73% of that of the controls. Of the brain regions examined, binding to only cerebral CSM was significantly (p less than 0.0001) decreased. Scatchard analyses of saturation curves revealed that the high-affinity (KD = 8 +/- 3 nM) site for muscimol was abolished in cerebral CSM from scrapie-infected mice, while the low-affinity site was unaffected. Binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to cerebral CSM was unaffected by scrapie and was stimulated by GABA to the same extent in both scrapie and control mice. These results suggest that scrapie agent 139A in C57BL/6J mice manifests a portion of its CNS pathology via a high-affinity GABA binding site that is unassociated with the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "45": "In vitro autoradiographic techniques combined with computer assisted microdensitometry were used to analyze the characteristics and distribution of multiple recognition sites for the neurotransmitters acetylcholine (M1 and M2) and serotonin (5-HT1A and 5-HT1B). For this purpose, binding competition experiments were performed using non-subtype selective 3H-labeled ligands and selective unlabeled compounds. Consecutive tissue sections were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of displacers. By using this approach, maximal densities of binding sites, as well as competition profiles of several drugs could be analyzed and quantified in microscopic brain areas. Our results reveal the presence of brain structures enriched in one class of muscarinic or serotonergic-1 recognition sites. This provides a tool for better characterization of the proposed \"subtype-selective\" ligands and suggests physiological functions for these receptor subtypes. It is concluded that quantitative autoradiographic techniques provide a level of anatomical and pharmacological information on neurotransmitter receptor subtypes, which is difficult to attain using membrane binding studies.", 
    "46": "The effects of synthetic antiepileptic drugs (phenobarbital and diazepam) and vitamins (nicotinamide, pyridoxal-5 phosphate and alpha-tocopherol) were investigated on the model of the chronically epileptized brain in the form of corasole kindling in inbred and noninbred mice. It has been shown that both series of drugs inhibit the epileptic activity developing at the peak of brain epileptization and prevent its further development. The results of the study demonstrate the benefit of the multimodality pathogenetic therapy of epilepsy and suggest the advisability of its practical application.", 
    "47": "We report here that diazepam (Valium, Roche) has an inhibitory effect on proliferation of synchronously dividing cultures of Dunaliella, whenever the drug is added during the cell cycle. The drug induced an accumulation of abnormal mitotic figures after 17 to 24 hr of treatment with the chromosomes distributed around the nuclei and a monopolar spindle, although the pole-to-chromosome microtubules were well-formed. Diazepam seemed to affect mitosis by inhibiting the separation of the basal bodies, whose duplication was perturbed in a dose-related manner. After 48 hr of treatment, the nucleus returned to interphase without having undergone mitosis, but cytokinesis might have taken place. The mechanism of this action of diazepam on mitosis remains to be elucidated. However, it does not appear to act in the same way here as it does on the central nervous system.", 
    "48": "The spinal nociceptive system is the target of various pain depressing agents. It is capable to function without control from the brain. It is activated by tissue damage which, by excitation of nociceptive afferents, evokes activity in axons ascending to the brain (sensory nociceptive response) and in spinal reflex pathways (motor and autonomic responses). The prototype of an analgesic agent, morphine, suppresses nociceptive responses by binding to opiate receptors; it imitates the effect of the transmitter(s) released from endorphinergic neurones. Pentobarbital and diazepam reduce nociceptive (and non-nociceptive) responses by acting on the GABA receptor complex; both drugs facilitate the effect of the transmitter GABA which mediates presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord. Pentobarbital may produce its effects by an additional action on postsynaptic neurone membranes. Clonidine depresses nociceptive responses, probably by imitating the action of the inhibitory transmitter, noradrenaline. Substance P acts as a \"synaptic modulator\"; it may facilitate or inhibit nociceptive responses. Ceruletide and cholecystokinin octapeptide depress nociceptive motor responses but do not affect the nociceptive sensory response. This indicates that motor and sensory responses of the spinal nociceptive system are not rigidly linked together. With the help of appropriate drugs, it is possible to manipulate them separately.", 
    "49": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 0.4 mg/kg/day, per os) was administered to cats during either the acquisition (CDP 21-22 days) of a go-nogo successive discrimination task (SD) or the performance (CDP 10 days) of the previously learned SD task. Endogenous levels of serotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, noradrenaline and dopamine were assayed in 12 brain areas, in trained as well as in untrained cats. This study has shown that (1) CDP strongly impaired the acquisition but not performance of the SD task, revealing a dissociation of the effects of CDP on these two stages of training; (2) the CDP administration, as well as the SD training, produced regional changes in brain levels of biogenic amines, suggesting the involvement of particular monoaminergic neurons in the behavioral effects of CDP and in operant behavior; and (3) in particular brain areas, interactions were observed between the effects of the SD training and those of the CDP administration on monoamines, indicating that the behavioral state may interfere with the neurochemical effects of CDP.", 
    "50": "The appearance of newer, short-acting benzodiazepines has produced misconceptions regarding the potential addictive quality of these drugs. Following a review of the Smith and Wesson (1983) barbiturate withdrawal technique, application of this procedure to the withdrawal of individuals addicted to short-acting benzodiazepines is reviewed. Attention is also given to the emergence of \"look-alike\" drugs, and the resultant implications for substance abuse treatment personnel.", 
    "51": "The acute administration of the 1,5 benzodiazepine clobazam (20 and 100 mg/kg orally) reduces the sulpiride-induced release of prolactin in the male rat. The decrease in prolactin plasma level is respectively of 66 and 75% for the two doses, whereas it has minimal effects on the gonadotropins (FSH and LH). The clobazam induced prolactin lowering effect is compared to the one observed after diazepam administration. Finally, we have shown that the two benzodiazepines have no effect either on prolactin or on gonadotropins, when administered alone.", 
    "52": "The effects of zopiclone 7.5 mg in comparison to flunitrazepam 1 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg and lormetazepam 1 mg on stages of information processing in a memory-scanning task were investigated in 10 normal volunteers using a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. Overall reaction times for the test were significantly increased 1 h following treatment with zopiclone, flunitrazepam and triazolam and in the morning following nighttime medication with flunitrazepam. The effects of zopiclone, flunitrazepam and triazolam were found to be located in the serial comparison and response-selection organization stages of the reaction process although both flunitrazepam and triazolam caused additional impairment of stimulus encoding.", 
    "53": "Cyclobarbital inhibited diazepam metabolism by rat liver supernatant only at concentrations of 1 mM. Ethylmorphine N-demethylation is strongly inhibited by diazepam in a non-competitive manner whereas cyclobarbital shows a competitive inhibition type. Both cyclobarbital and oxazepam are weak inhibitors. Hexobarbital- evokes typical type I spectral changes with rat liver microsomes whereas cyclobarbital and diazepam-induced spectral changes are similar to type II or inverse type I. Barbital evoked the same type of spectral changes as diazepam and cyclobarbital. With the usual concentration in vivo the metabolism of diazepam and other drugs can scarcely be influenced by cyclobarbital.", 
    "54": "Clorazepate dipotassium is rapidly decarboxylated to yield desmethyl diazepam. The antiepileptic effect of clorazepate was studied in 29 epileptic children with refractory seizures. Their ages were ranged from one year 9 months to 20 years (mean 11 years 6 months). Serum clorazepate levels were also determined in 16 patients. The mean initial dose was 0.91 mg/kg/day, and the dose was increased up to 3 mg/kg/day. Within several days after initiation of clorazepate therapy, a decrease in seizure frequency was seen in patients in whom clorazepate was effective. Excellent results (decrease in seizure frequency by more than 80%) were obtained in 7 patients (24.1%), a moderate improvement with a 50 to 80% decrease was seen in 7 patients (24.1%), and a partial improvement with less than 50% decrease was seen in 7 patients (24.1%). No benefit was seen in 8 patients (27.7%). Serum clorazepate levels in patients with excellent results were 31 to 77 ng/ml (mean 55 ng/ml), those in patients with a moderate improvement were 130 to 225 ng/ml (mean 163 ng/ml), and those in patients with a partial improvement were 142 to 518 ng/ml (mean 273 ng/ml). Serum clorazepate levels in patients with no benefit were 34 to 97 ng/ml (mean 56 ng/ml). There was no direct relationship between serum clorazepate levels and clinical response. The results of this study indicate the efficacy of clorazepate for epileptic children with refractory seizures.", 
    "55": "The acute and subchronic actions of the benzodiazepines triazolam, oxazepam and diazepam have been examined using three behavioural tests. In the accelerating rotarod motor coordination test both diazepam and oxazepam on acute administration produced dose-related discoordination or motor impairment in mice. After chronic administration (50 mg/kg per day i.p. for 14 days) the corresponding dose-response lines were shifted to the right suggesting tolerance development. In a test for conflict behaviour in rats (conditioned suppression of drinking) oxazepam (20 mg/kg i.p.), triazolam (1 mg/kg i.p.) and diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) all augmented punished responding rates with no effect on unpunished responses and this has been speculated to reflect anxiolytic activity. These initial elevations in punished responding displayed a gradual decline during repeated daily administration over 20 days, there being little alteration in the unpunished response levels. In separate studies, chronic treatment of mice with triazolam in the drinking water over 30 days showed diminished pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure latencies compared to the level of protection afforded by triazolam at the beginning of the schedule. In additional experiments, mice injected daily with triazolam (1 mg/kg i.p. for 14 days) exhibited a higher seizure susceptibility than their corresponding controls. The results are discussed in relation to tolerance to the anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and neurological impairment properties of benzodiazepines.", 
    "56": "In summary, cimetidine is a potent inhibitor of liver microsomal activity, which may also decrease hepatic blood flow. Other effects of the drug include inhibition of gastric secretion and intrinsic toxic properties. These effects, combined with the common use of cimetidine in clinical practice, make the risk of adverse drug interactions a relatively frequent risk in the clinical setting. Although a multitude of interactions with cimetidine has been evaluated, many of these are incompletely described or understood. At the present time, a potentially significant alteration of absorption appears to exist with only ketoconazole, elemental iron, vitamin B12 (long-term therapy), and pancreatic enzyme supplements (increased activity). Significant metabolic inhibition or decreased excretion appears to exist with warfarin, propranolol, theophylline, phenytoin, quinidine, possibly lidocaine and procainamide, and certain benzodiazepines. Other potential, but less well ascertained interactions may involve the narcotic analgesics, caffeine, ethanol, pentobarbital, imipramine, chlormethiazole, and metronidazole. In these settings, the clinician must be aware of interaction potential, and astutely monitor the patient during combination therapy. Other data indicate that concomitant administration of antacids may reduce the absorption of cimetidine, that the drug may protect against the toxic effects of acetaminophen overdose, and that combination with certain other myelosuppressants may carry a significant risk. Thus, in regard to these reports, cimetidine is a drug with complex effects on the absorption, elimination, and toxicity of other drugs. When used in the setting of multiple drug therapy, the clinician must be alert to potentially increased or decreased effects of the drugs mentioned in this review. In addition, one must be aware that other hepatically metabolised agents not mentioned here may be affected by the addition of cimetidine therapy. Because of the therapeutic successes demonstrated in the treatment of various disorders with cimetidine, one cannot disregard this agent. Thus, the responsibility for understanding and monitoring for the complex effects of this drug falls with the practicing physician.", 
    "57": "Decreases of 40 to 50% in striatal dopamine release by diazepam in doses above 5 mg/kg were elicited. Similar actions were observed with clonazepam and nitrazepam. No tolerance to these actions was evident after 3 weeks of chronic treatment. These data are consistent with a potent inhibitory GABAergic regulation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons.", 
    "58": "The hypothesis that inhibition of adenosine uptake may play an important role in the central actions of the benzodiazepines is presented. The evidence supporting this hypothesis is discussed. Brain concentrations of the benzodiazepines are adequate for inhibition of adenosine uptake. Benzodiazepines, such as RO15-1788 and RO5-4864, which do not enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid binding, may exert some of their central effects by inhibiting the uptake of adenosine.", 
    "59": "Six fasting male subjects (20-32 years of age) received an oral tablet and an IV 1.0-mg dose of alprazolam in a crossover-design study. Alprazolam plasma concentration in multiple samples during 36 h after dosing was determined by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. Psychomotor performance tests, digit-symbol substitution (DSS), and perceptual speed (PS) were administered at 0, 1.25, 2.25, 5.0, and 12.5 h. Sedation was assessed by the subjects and by an observer using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale and a Nurse Rating Sedation Scale (NRSS), respectively. Mean kinetic parameters after IV and oral alprazolam were as follows: volume of distribution (Vd) 0.72 and 0.84 l/kg; elimination half-life (t1/2) 11.7 and 11.8 h; clearance (Cl) 0.74 and 0.89 ml/min/kg. There were no significant differences between IV and oral alprazolam in Vd, t1/2, or area under the curve. The mean fraction absorbed after oral administration was 0.92. Performance on PS and DSS tests was impaired at 1.25 and 2.5 h, but had returned to baseline at 5.0 h for both treatments. Onset of sedation was rapid after IV administration and the average time of peak sedation was 0.48 h. Sedation scores were significantly lower during hour 1 after oral administration than after IV, but were not significantly different at later times. Alprazolam is fully available after oral administration and kinetic parameters are not affected by route of administration. With the exception of rapidity of onset, the pharmacodynamic profiles of IV and oral alprazolam are very similar after a 1.0-mg dose.", 
    "60": "Diazepam 5 mg, promethazine 25 mg, propiomazine 25 mg, and placebo as sleeping aids were studied in 40 elderly inpatients. The drugs were administered in a random order, double-blind, on 21 nights. All active drugs were found effective in the mentally normal elderly, but in the psychogeriatric group of 20 patients, only propiomazine very significantly reduced the number of nocturnal awakenings and only diazepam almost significantly shortened the initial sleep latency, although duration of sleep was prolonged in both groups. There was neither loss of efficacy of the trial drugs nor rebound on withdrawal. Psychomotor skills and serum prolactin levels remained unaffected.", 
    "61": "A GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex was purified from bovine cerebral cortex. The receptor fraction displayed binding sites for benzodiazepines as well as high and low affinity binding sites for GABA which are characteristics of the membrane-bound receptor. Two monoclonal antibodies of which one was directed against the 50 kd and the other against the 55 kd subunit were used for immunoprecipitation studies. Both of them were shown to quantitatively precipitate the entire receptor population. These results indicate that the binding sites for benzodiazepines and GABA (high and low affinity sites) reside on the same receptor complex containing a mixture of 50 kd and 55 kd subunits. Reconstitution of the receptor in phospholipid vesicles was achieved.", 
    "62": "A GABA/benzodiazepine/barbiturate receptor complex has been purified from bovine cerebral cortex by affinity chromatography on a benzodiazepine column. Depending on the detergent present during the isolation of the receptor (deoxycholate/Triton X-100 or CHAPS/Asolectin), and during the binding assays (Triton X-100 or CHAPS), the receptor displays different binding properties for the GABAA agonist [3H]muscimol and for the chloride ion channel blocking agent [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS), whereas the binding properties for the benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam are independent of isolation and assay conditions. Both methods of isolation yield a protein complex consisting of the same two subunits of Mr 53 000 and Mr 57 000. Therefore the different binding properties reflect different conformations of the isolated receptor protein. [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the CHAPS-purified receptor is stimulated by GABA and the barbiturate pentobarbital in a dose-dependent manner. Photo-affinity labeling of the purified receptor with [3H]flunitrazepam leads to incorporation of radioactivity into both subunits, but predominantly into the Mr 53 000 band, as shown by fluorography. Proteolytic degradation by trypsin of the isolated photo-affinity labeled receptor in detergent solution proceeds via a labeled Mr 48 000 polypeptide. Proteolytic destruction of the reversible [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding activities requires greater than 100 fold higher concentrations of trypsin than the decomposition of the receptor polypeptides into fragments less than Mr 10 000.",

    "65": "A solid state activity monitor worn on the wrist was used to study the effect of flunitrazepam, flurazepam, temazepam, triazolam and midazolam. All compounds reduced motor activity in the first half, but only flunitrazepam and flurazepam had an effect during the second half of the bed rest period. Ambulatory activity monitoring is an unobtrusive and simple method for investigating timecourse of action.", 
    "66": "Analysis of human horizontal saccadic eye movements can provide measurements of central nervous system depression and stimulation. Effects on saccadic eye movements have been observed in normal volunteers with barbiturates, benzodiazepines, opiates and related compounds, carbamazepine, amphetamine and ethanol. A suite of programmes have been developed to allow the generation, collection and analysis of saccadic eye movements using a CBM 3032, 8032 or BBC B microcomputer. The system allows almost continuous sampling and rapid analysis of movements.", 
    "67": "Benzodiazepines possess anterograde amnesic properties, disrupting both short-term and long-term memory function. The amount of amnesia is systematically related to dose effects and half-life differences among the benzodiazepines. Memory deficits are found for episodic, semantic, and iconic memory function. The deficits in long-term memory are probably the result of a disruption of consolidation of information in memory and not retrieval from memory. The disruption is produced by rapid sleep onset. Thus the long-term amnesia is really a retrograde effect of sleep and not the anterograde effect of the drug.", 
    "68": "Interactions of centrally active drugs are difficult to analyse in man due to methodological and ethical problems. Alcoholic and methylxanthine beverages are the most common centrally active agents that might modify the effects of benzodiazepines on performance. In sufficiently large doses ethanol enhances the effects of benzodiazepines, even those that are not metabolized by mixed function oxidases sensitive to blockade by ethanol. Consequently, the combined effect of ethanol and benzodiazepines may occur at the receptor level and/or result from altered binding of benzodiazepines to plasma proteins. Newer benzodiazepines may differ from the older in their interactions. Caffeine and theophylline counteract benzodiazepine effects on performance, resulting perhaps from the blockade of adenosine receptors which could be linked with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor system. Central stimulants of the amphetamine type also counteract benzodiazepine effects in a somewhat selective way. New stimulant antidepressants rather counteract than increase benzodiazepine effects. Central antimuscarinics in combination with benzodiazepines are detrimental for memory. Specific benzodiazepine antagonists are effective also in man but without known clinical applications.", 
    "69": "The literature on pencil and paper tests and the effects of psychotropic drugs is reviewed. Performance at digit symbol substitution, symbol copying, letter cancellation, arithmetic, logic and cognitive processing with a relatively constant level of triazolam was compared with placebo. Analysis of variance, covariance analysis and principal component analysis were applied to the data. Pencil and paper tests which measure various skills are useful for detecting drug effects. Letter cancellation, arithmetic and DSST appear to be most sensitive, although logic and symbol copying may be useful.", 
    "70": "Mental illness and the use of psychotropic drugs are considered to influence driving skills of patients. However, studies which indicate the relative contributions of these factors are rare. It is emphasized that for measuring the effects of psychotropic drugs on driving performance of patients, real driving tests are needed. Actual driving and psychomotor performance of patients receiving diazepam, and patients and healthy volunteers receiving mebhydrolin were measured to illustrate the use of real driving tests. The results of both studies are discussed in terms of problems associated with the application of these tests. Patient recruitment is considered to be a major problem. To draw conclusions under these circumstances is extremely difficult, but still acceptable in comparison with the limitations and methodological difficulties of the more commonly used laboratory tests. Some guidelines for driving tests with patients are given.", 
    "71": "A study was carried out in order to compare the effects of 40 mg of temazepam (Euhypnos) and 30 mg of flurazepam on sleep experience, and the residual effects on mood and performance of normal volunteers. The effects of the doses were compared with the identical placebos. A sleep experience questionnaire, an activation questionnaire and a rapid information processing test were administered in the morning, 10 h after ingestion. Both drugs produced the same subjective experience. However, large significant, residual effects of flurazepam were seen on activation and performance (correct detections and reaction times) while temazepam had little effect on activation and produced only a small significant residual impairment of reaction times.", 
    "72": "Balanced heterokarions were grown from Penicillium cyclopium aux-glu 1, a glutamic acid auxotroph producing benzodiazepine alkaloids of the cyclopenin-cyclopenol group, and P. viridicatum aux-met 1, a methionine auxotroph forming these alkaloids in traces only. In contrast to the hyphae of the parent strains, the hyphae of the heterokarions were dark orange-brown and grew well on media without the auxotrophic factors. In surface cultures they synthesized the benzodiazepine alkaloids cyclopenin and cyclopenol in amounts similar to those formed by the hyphae of P. cyclopium aux-glu 1. From the monokariotic conidiospores of the heterokarions homokariotic daughter strains were obtained which were similar to the parent strains in every respect. Hence no exchange of features of cyclopenin-cyclopenol biosynthesis took place between the parent strains at the stage of the heterokarion. This result indicates that the formation of cyclopenin and cyclopenol in P. cyclopium aux-glu 1 and the nearly complete lack of biosynthesis of these compounds in P. viridicatum aux-met 1 is encoded within the nucleus and is not influenced by plasmic genetic material.", 
    "73": "Certain psychiatrists systematically use benzodiazepines to treat psychosis. Are these substances efficient in this indication? In order to answer this question, the authors propose the following protocol which appreciates the efficiency of benzodiazepines in anxious schizophrenic states.", 
    "74": "In this double-bind randomized study involving 35 depressed female inpatients, Indalpine proved significantly superior to placebo on all the criteria used: Hamilton scales for depression and anxiety, clinician's vectorial ratings. Its rapid onset of action was further confirmed by the rapid appearance of significance relative to placebo: as early as the third day of treatment, that is, during the optimum placebo effect period. The results are all more valuable if one considers the magnitude of the placebo effect obtained with daily infusions of isotonic sodium chloride-dextros solution, the possible adjunction of a benzodiazepine and the availability of placebo tablets as an adjunct to the infusions upon request. Acceptabilit\u00e9 was found to be good, especially at the cardiovascular and cholinergic levels.", 
    "75": "A number of studies have found that the perinatal exposure of rodents to various tranquilizing agents alters their adult behaviour. Given the known anti-aggressive influence of acute doses of diazepam it was hypothesized that, when administered during pregnancy, this drug would change the adult social behaviour. The social interactions of adult male mice whose mothers were treated with diazepam or appropriate controls during pregnancy were video-taped and subjected to an ethological analysis that involved counting the incidences of 43 distinct postures. Prenatal but not postnatal diazepam treatment was associated with a large increase in the incidence of the sideways offensive posture. No significant differences resulted, however, in the case of other postures; in general exposure to prenatal diazepam produced few changes in adult social behaviour.", 
    "76": "Benzodiazepines are often used as premedication or intravenous sedative agents for endoscopies. The present study included 74 patients. It compared the sedative and amnestic properties of midazolam and diazepam, their relative potencies as well as the comfort of both the patient and the endoscopist during gastroscopy. The comparison has shown some statistically significant differences, allowing the following conclusions: amnesia was more frequent with midazolam; the dose requirement (in mg X kg-1) for adequate sedation was more important with diazepam, confirming the greater potency of midazolam; generally speaking, sedation was excellent with both drugs.", 
    "77": "Triazolam, a new benzodiazepine hypnotic agent with an ultra-short duration of action, was given preoperatively to 251 outpatients who underwent plastic surgical procedures under local anesthesia. Satisfactory sedation was obtained in 96% of the patients, all of whom received intravenous diazepam primarily for its amnesic action. There were no untoward results attributed to triazolam and no residual effects postoperatively. Triazolam may be preferable over other benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agents used for outpatient surgery because of its rapid onset and short half-life."
