The occurrence and fate of 15 selected psychiatric pharmaceuticals, including eight benzodiazepines, four antidepressants, one antiepileptic and two metabolites of benzodiazepines were investigated in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influents and effluents, surface water, and final drinking water in Shanghai. Psychiatric pharmaceuticals were in WWTPs influents ranging from low ng L(-1) to 68.2 ng L(-1), dominated by carbamazepine, doxepin, diazepam and lorazepam. Target analytes were still detected in effluents from low ng L(-1) range to 47.3 ng L(-1), with carbamazepine, diazepam, and oxazepam as most prevalent. WWTPs were low effective (<50%) in removing most of them, excluding amitriptyline (mean 60%), doxepin (mean 70%), temazepam (mean 78%) and lorazepam (mean 93%). In addition, carbamazepine, diazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam were detected in low ng L(-1) to 75.5 ng L(-1) in the surface water of Huang Pu Rive. The pattern of contaminants in surface water is similar to the effluent wastewater, which suggested the main source of organic trace pollutants might be WWTPs. Furthermore, carbamazepine (0.8-2.5 ng L(-1)), diazepam (0.5-3.2 ng L(-1)) and alprazolam (2.3 ng L(-1)) were also detected in drinking water and the concentrations were below the health based precautionary value. The investigation was within the range of those results reported in other countries. Our results indicate ubiquity of the investigated compounds in the aquatic system. These pollutants may potentially reach drinking water via WWTP effluents and/or surface waters and require constant attention.",

    "11": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the modulation of GABA-evoked currents by the flavonoid viscosine at recombinant GABA(A) receptors, and subsequently to study its anxiolytic, sedative and anticonvulsant activities. Viscosine (1-300\u03bcM) positively modulated GABA-evoked currents at human \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32L and \u03b12\u03b22\u03b32L GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes in a flumazenil insensitive manner. In behavioral studies, viscosine at doses of 10-100mg/kg (i.p.) exerted significant anxiolytic effects in the elevated plus maze, light-dark and open field tests (*P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001 n=6, One-way ANOVA post-Dunnett's test), and sedative effects at high doses (100mg/kg i.p.) in hole board and thiopental induced sleep time tests. The anxiolytic effect in the elevated plus maze test was not blocked by flumazenil whereas pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) completely attenuated the effect, indicating that the activity was mediated via the non-benzodiazepine sites of GABA(A) receptors. Furthermore, viscosine at doses of 10-100mg/kg (i.p.) exerted anticonvulsant effects in a dose-dependent manner in PTZ, picrotoxin and bicuculline induced seizure paradigms (*P<0.05, **P<0.01,***P<0.001 n=6, One-way ANOVA post-Dunnett's test). In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions of viscosine are likely mediated via its positive allosteric modulatory action of GABA at different GABA(A) receptor subtypes.",

During 20min of each anesthesia we recorded both the EEG and respiratory movements. For sleep and EEG analysis, Fourier analysis was applied on 6-h recordings, and each 10-s epoch was differentiated as a state of wakefulness (Wake), non-rapid eye movement (NREM) or rapid eye movement (REM). Additionally, the group probability density distributions of all EEG frequency band relative amplitudes were calculated for each state, with particular attention during anesthesia.

Prophylactic treatment, including midazolam, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, fentanyl and propofol, has been used to prevent EA. However, the question of which prophylactic treatment should be preferred to decrease the incidence of EA is still unclear. We conducted a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials to investigate the comparative efficacy of midazolam, dexmedetomidine, ketamine, fentanyl, and propofol for the prevention of sevoflurane-related EA in children. First, we used the odds ratios and 95% confidence interval as effect size. The results revealed that dexmedetomidine 0.19 (0.14-0.27), midazolam 0.22 (0.07-0.60), ketamine 0.28 (0.16-0.51), propofol 0.23 (0.10-0.53), and fentanyl 0.25 (0.17-0.36) led to a significant reduction of the incidence of EA when compared with placebo. With placebo as the standard of comparison, the degree of incoherence (a measure of how closely the entire network fits together) was small (\u03c9 = 8.66728e-08). The logor were dexmedetomidine -1.75 (-2.11 to -1.39), midazolam -1.07 (-1.54 to -0.60), ketamine -1.292 (-1.92 to -0.66), and fentanyl -1.13 (-1.56 to -0.70). When compared with dexmedetomidine, the logor were placebo 1.75 (1.39-2.11), midazolam 0.67 (0.09-1.25), ketamine 0.45 (-0.25-1.15), propofol 0.75 (0.19-1.31), and fentanyl 0.617 (0.13-1.11). When compared with ketamine, the logor were placebo 1.29 (0.66-1.92), midazolam 0.22 (-0.56 to 1.00), dexmedetomidine -0.45 (-1.15-0.25); propofol 0.29 (-0.45-1.03); and fentanyl 0.16 (-0.59-0.92). The study that showed dexmedetomidine, midazolam, ketamine, propofol, and fentanyl could significantly decrease the incidence of EA when compared with placebo. One interesting finding of this network meta-analysis is that dexmedetomidine might be the best choice to prevent EA. However, there is weak evidence that dexmedetomidine is better than ketamine for the prevention of sevoflurane-related EA in children. As a result, more studies are needed to compare dexmedetomidine with ketamine.",

However, they have some undesired effects including memory problems. In continuing our research on novel benzodiazepine ligands, we are looking for ligands with less adverse effects. Previously, 4 novel derivatives of 2-phenoxy phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole were synthesized as agonists of BZD receptors. In this study, the pharmacological effects of novel compounds were evaluated. Pentobarbital induced loss of righting reflex, elevated plus maze, open-field locomotor activity and passive avoidance test were used to evaluate the sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic and amnesic effects of compounds respectively. The results revealed that the novel compounds with NH2, SH and SCH3 substituents at the 2-position of the oxadiazole ring increase righting reflex time significantly. In the elevated plus maze test none of the derivatives increased open arm duration and open arm entry indicating no anxiolytic properties. Moreover, the novel compounds didn't influence step-down latencies in the mice. The fact that the hypnotic activity of these compounds were significantly reduced by flumazenil, confirmed that this effect is mediated by BZD receptors.",

These outcomes include mere retrieval, destabilization-reconsolidation, a transitional period (which is insensitive to amnestics), and extinction learning. However, little is known about the interaction between initial learning conditions and these outcomes during a reinforced or nonreinforced reactivation. Here we systematically combined temporally specific memories with different reactivation parameters to observe whether these four outcomes are determined by the conditions established during training. First, we validated two training regimens with different temporal expectations about US arrival. Then, using Midazolam (MDZ) as an amnestic agent, fear memories in both learning conditions were submitted to retraining either under identical or different parameters to the original training. Destabilization (i.e., susceptibly to MDZ) occurred when reactivation was reinforced, provided the occurrence of a temporal prediction error about US arrival. In subsequent experiments, both treatments were systematically reactivated by nonreinforced context exposure of different lengths, which allowed to explore the interaction between training and reactivation lengths. These results suggest that temporal prediction error and trace dominance determine the extent to which reactivation produces the different outcomes.", 
    "33": "Seizures are a common complication of drug intoxication, and up to 9% of status epilepticus cases are caused by a drug or poison. While the specific drugs associated with drug-induced seizures may vary by geography and change over time, common reported causes include antidepressants, stimulants and antihistamines. Seizures occur generally as a result of inadequate inhibitory influences (e.g., gamma aminobutyric acid, GABA) or excessive excitatory stimulation (e.g. glutamate) although many other neurotransmitters play a role. Most drug-induced seizures are self-limited. However, status epilepticus occurs in up to 10% of cases. Prolonged or recurrent seizures can lead to serious complications and require vigorous supportive care and anticonvulsant drugs. Benzodiazepines are generally accepted as the first line anticonvulsant therapy for drug-induced seizures. If benzodiazepines fail to halt seizures promptly, second line drugs include barbiturates and propofol. If isoniazid poisoning is a possibility, pyridoxine is given. Continuous infusion of one or more anticonvulsants may be required in refractory status epilepticus. There is no role for phenytoin in the treatment of drug-induced seizures.

    "34": "As all visual information is represented in the spatio-temporal dynamics of transmitter release from photoreceptors and the combined postsynaptic responses of second-order neurons, appropriate synaptic transfer functions are fundamental for a meaningful perception of the visual world. The functional contribution of horizontal cells to gain control and organization of bipolar and ganglion cell receptive fields can only be evaluated with an in-depth understanding of signal processing in horizontal cells. Therefore, a horizontal slice preparation of the mouse retina was established to record from horizontal cell bodies with their dendritic fields intact and receiving functional synaptic input from cone photoreceptors. Horizontal cell bodies showed spontaneous excitatory currents (spEPSCs) of monophasic and more complex multi-peak waveforms. spEPSCs were induced by quantal release of glutamate from presynaptic cones with a unitary amplitude of 3 pA. Non-stationary noise analysis revealed that spEPSCs with a monoexponential decay were mediated by 7-8 glutamate receptors with a single-channel amplitude of 1.55 pA. Responses to photopic full-field illumination were characterized by reduction of a tonic inward current or hyperpolarization, inhibition of spEPSCs, followed by a fast and transient inward current at light offset. The response to periodic dark/light transitions of different frequencies was dependent on the adaptational status of the cell with a limiting frequency of 10 Hz. Both on and off components of the light response were mediated by AMPA and kainate receptors.

The specimens dealt with were femoral vein blood, right heart blood, left heart blood, bile, brain, lung, heart muscle, liver, spleen, kidney, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. By tentative drug screening, we found a high concentration of 7-aminoflunitrazepam in the femoral vein blood, which lead us to examine the postmortem distribution of flunitrazepam and its metabolite 7-aminoflunitrazepam in her body fluids and solid tissues. The extraction of flunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam and internal standard nimetazepam was performed by a modified QuEChERS method, followed by the analysis by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Because this study included various kinds of human matrices with quite different properties, we used the standard additional method to overcome the matrix effects. The concentration of 7-aminoflunitrazepam were generally much higher than those of the parent drug flunitrazepam for most specimens except for the adipose tissue, showing that flunitrazepam is readily metabolized to its 7-amino metabolite after absorption into the body both antemortem and postmortem. The outstandingly highest concentration of 7-animoflunitrazepam was found in the bile, followed by the kidney, pancreas, left heart blood, spleen and liver. Although a majority of flunitrazepam was converted to 7-aminoflunitrazepam, the flunitrazepam concentration was highest in the pancreas, followed by the spleen, bile, left heart blood, and brain. In contrast to the results on synthetic cannabinoids, the levels of flunitrazepam and 7-animoflunitrazepam in the adipose tissue were relatively low.

No significant increase, in comparison with placebo, was shown with eszopiclone (21 (22 to 37) vs 28.0 (15 to 36); P value = NS), zolpidem (0.81 \u00b1 0.29 vs 1.46 \u00b1 0.53; P value = NS), flurazepam (18.6 \u00b1 19 vs 19.6 \u00b1 15.9; P value = NS) and temazepam (6.53 \u00b1 9.4 vs 6.56 \u00b1 8.3; P value = 0.98).A significant decrease in minimum nocturnal peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) was observed with zolpidem 20 mg (76.8 vs 85.2; P value = 0.002), flurazepam 30 mg (81.7 vs 85.2; P value = 0.002), remifentanil infusion (MD -7.00, 95% CI -11.95 to -2.05) and triazolam 0.25 mg in both rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep (MD -14.00, 95% CI -21.84 to -6.16; MD -10.20, 95% CI -16.08 to -4.32, respectively.One study investigated the effect of an opiate (remifentanil) on patients with moderate OSA. Remifentanil infusion did not significantly change AHI (MD 10.00, 95% CI -9.83 to 29.83); however it did significantly decrease the number of obstructive apnoeas (MD -9.00, 95% CI -17.40 to -0.60) and significantly increased the number of central apnoeas (MD 16.00, 95% CI -2.21 to 34.21). Similarly, although without significant effect on obstructive apnoeas, central apnoeas were increased in the sodium oxybate 9 g treatment group (MD 7.3 (18); P value = 0.005) in a cross-over trial.Drugs studied in this review were generally well tolerated, apart from adverse events reported in 19 study participants prescribed remifentanil (n = 1), eszopiclone (n = 6), sodium oxybate (n = 9) or ramelteon (n = 3).", 
    "49": "The findings of this review show that currently no evidence suggests that the pharmacological compounds assessed have a deleterious effect on the severity of OSA as measured by change in AHI or ODI. Significant clinical and statistical decreases in minimum overnight SpO2 were observed with remifentanil, zolpidem 20 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg. Eszopiclone 3 mg and sodium oxybate 4.5 g showed a beneficial effect on the severity of OSA with a reduction in AHI and may merit further assessment as a potential therapeutic option for a subgroup of patients with OSA. Only one trial assessed the effect of an opioid (remifentanil); some studies included CPAP treatment, whilst in a significant number of participants, previous treatment with CPAP was not stated and thus a residual treatment effect of CPAP could not be excluded. Most studies were small and of short duration, with indiscernible methodological quality.Caution is therefore required when such agents are prescribed for patients with OSA, especially outside the severity of the OSA cohorts and the corresponding dose of compounds given in the particular studies. Larger, longer trials involving patients across a broader spectrum of OSA severity are needed to clarify these results.", 
    "50": "The aim of the study was to determine whether or not dexmedetomidine- (DEX-) based intravenous infusion in dental implantation can provide better sedation and postoperative analgesia via suppressing postoperative inflammation and oxidative stress. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive either DEX (group D) or midazolam (group M). Recorded variables were vital sign (SBP/HR/RPP/SpO2/RR), visual analogue scale (VAS) pain scores, and observer's assessment of alertness/sedation scale (OAAS) scores. The plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the lipid peroxidation product malondialdehyde (MDA) were detected at baseline and after 2, 4, and 24\u2009h of drug administration. The VAS pain scores and OAAS scores were significantly lower for patients in group D compared to group M. The plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MDA were significantly lower in group D patients than those in group M at 2\u2009h and 4\u2009h. In group M, SOD levels decreased as compared to group D at 2\u2009h and 4\u2009h. The plasma levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and MDA were positively correlated with VAS pain scores while SOD negatively correlated with VAS pain scores. Therefore, DEX appears to provide better sedation during office-based artificial tooth implantation. DEX offers better postoperative analgesia via anti-inflammatory and antioxidation pathway.", 
    "51": "Novel 2,3-benzodiazepine and related isoquinoline derivatives, substituted at position 1 with a 2-benzothiophenyl moiety, were synthesized to produce compounds that potently inhibited the action of GABA on heterologously expressed GABAA receptors containing the alpha 5 subunit (GABAA \u03b15), with no apparent affinity for the benzodiazepine site. Substitutions of the benzothiophene moiety at position 4 led to compounds with drug-like properties that were putative inhibitors of extra-synaptic GABAA \u03b15 receptors and had substantial blood-brain barrier permeability. Initial characterization in vivo showed that 8-methyl-5-[4-(trifluoromethyl)-1-benzothiophen-2-yl]-1,9-dihydro-2H-[1,3]oxazolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepin-2-one was devoid of sedative, pro-convulsive or motor side-effects, and enhanced the performance of rats in the object recognition test. In summary, we have discovered a first-in-class GABA-site inhibitor of extra-synaptic GABAA \u03b15 receptors that has promising drug-like properties and warrants further development.",

Patients with newly diagnosed adverse respiratory events (pneumonia, COPD with acute exacerbation, acute respiratory failure, and cardiopulmonary arrest) were included in the case group. Patients with COPD and no history of adverse respiratory events were randomly selected for the control group, which was frequency-matched with the case group according to index date, age (per 10 years), and sex. Patients who had used hypnotics within 1 month meant active users. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of were calculated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.Most of the study participants were male (71.6%), and the mean ages of the participants in the case and control groups were 69.2 (\u00b112.4) and 67.5 (\u00b112.3) years, respectively. After potential confounding factors were adjusting for, the adjusted ORs of adverse respiratory events were 12.0 for active users of benzodiazepines (95% CI, 8.11-17.6) and 10.5 for active users of nonbenzodiazepines (95% CI, 7.68-14.2) compared with the adjusted ORs of those who never used hypnotics.The results of this epidemiological study suggested that hypnotics increased the risk of adverse respiratory events in patients with COPD.",

    "62": "A woman in her thirties was found dead on a bed. Considerable amounts of \"aroma liquid\" and \"bath salt\" products and hypnotic drug tablets were scattered beside the bed. Autopsy showed pulmonary congestion and edema. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyses of \"aroma liquid\" and \"bath salt\" products showed the presence of new cathinone designer drugs, 4-methoxy PV8 (4-methoxy PHPP), PV9 (\u03b1-POP), and 4-methoxy PV9 (4-methoxy \u03b1-POP), and a dissociative agent, diphenidine. Drug screening in stomach contents, blood and hydrolyzed urine of the woman by GC-MS and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) revealed the presence of the above 4 types of drugs and 3 types of benzodiazepines, triazolam, flunitrazepam, and nitrazepam, and their metabolites. The above 7 drugs and 3 benzodiazepine metabolites were simultaneously determined by LC-MS/MS after modified QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, Safe) extraction using diazepam-d5 as the internal standard. The concentrations of 4-methoxy PV8, PV9, 4-methoxy PV9, and diphenidine in the femoral blood were 2.69, 0.743, 0.261, and 1.38\u03bcg/ml, respectively, which were significantly higher than concentrations reported in previous cases. Alcohol concentration in the femoral blood was 1.52mg/ml. Based on the pathological and toxicological findings, the cause of death was determined to be 3 types of cathinone drugs, 4-methoxy PV8, PV9, and 4-methoxy PV9, and diphenidine poisoning under the influence of 3 benzodiazepines and alcohol.", 
    "63": "The C57BL/6J mouse as a model of seizure/epilepsy is challenging due to high mortality and huge variability in response to kainate. We have recently demonstrated that repeated administration of a low dose of kainate by intraperitoneal route can induce severe status epilepticus (SE) with 94% survival rate. In the present study, based on continuous video-EEG recording for 4-18 weeks from epidurally implanted electrodes on the cortex, we demonstrate that this method also induces immediate epileptogenesis (<1-5 days post-SE). This finding was based on identification of two types of spontaneous recurrent seizures; behavioral convulsive seizures (CS) and electrographic nonconvulsive seizures (NCS). The identification of the spontaneous CS, stage 3-5 types, was based on the behaviors (video) that were associated with the EEG characteristics (stage 3-5 epileptiform spikes), the power spectrum, and the activity counts. The electrographic NCS identification was based on the stage 1-2 epileptiform spike clusters on the EEG and their associated power spectrum. Severe SE induced immediate epileptogenesis in all the mice. The maximum numbers of spontaneous CS were observed during the first 4-6 weeks of the SE and they decreased thereafter. Mild SE also induced immediate epileptogenesis in some mice but the CS were less frequent. In both the severe and the mild SE groups, the spontaneous electrographic NCS persisted throughout the 18 weeks observation period, and therefore this could serve as a chronic model for complex seizures. However, unlike rat kainate models, the C57BL/6J mouse kainate model is a unique regressive CS model of epilepsy. Further studies are required to understand the mechanism of recovery from spontaneous CS in this model, which could reveal novel therapeutic targets for epilepsy.",

    "68": "Podocytes are specialized, highly differentiated epithelial cells in the kidney glomerulus that are exposed to glomerular capillary pressure and possible increases in mechanical load. The proteins sensing mechanical forces in podocytes are unconfirmed, but the classic transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6) interacting with the MEC-2 homolog podocin may form a mechanosensitive ion channel complex in podocytes. Here, we observed that podocytes respond to mechanical stimulation with increased intracellular calcium concentrations and increased inward cation currents. However, TRPC6-deficient podocytes responded in a manner similar to that of control podocytes, and mechanically induced currents were unaffected by genetic inactivation of TRPC1/3/6 or administration of the broad-range TRPC blocker SKF-96365. Instead, mechanically induced currents were significantly decreased by the specific P2X purinoceptor 4 (P2X4) blocker 5-BDBD. Moreover, mechanical P2X4 channel activation depended on cholesterol and podocin and was inhibited by stabilization of the actin cytoskeleton. Because P2X4 channels are not intrinsically mechanosensitive, we investigated whether podocytes release ATP upon mechanical stimulation using a fluorometric approach. Indeed, mechanically induced ATP release from podocytes was observed. Furthermore, 5-BDBD attenuated mechanically induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Altogether, our findings reveal a TRPC channel-independent role of P2X4 channels as mechanotransducers in podocytes.", 
    "69": "The present study investigated the validity of a novel pup-based repeated elevated plus maze task to detect reduced anxiety and increased maternal responsiveness in postpartum female rats and explored the roles of dopamine D2, serotonin transporter and GABA/benzodiazepine receptors in the mediation of these processes. Sprague-Dawley postpartum or nulliparous female rats were tested 4 times every other day on postpartum days 4, 6 and 8 in an elevated plus maze with 4 pups or 4 pup-size erasers placed on each end of the two open arms. When tested with erasers, untreated postpartum mother rats entered the open arms proportionally more than nulliparous rats. They also tended to spend more time in the open arms, indicating reduced anxiety. When tested with pups, postpartum rats retrieved pups into the closed arms, entered the open arms and closed arms more and had a higher moving speed than nulliparous rats, indicating increased maternal responsiveness. Both haloperidol (0.1 or 0.2 mg/kg, sc) and fluoxetine (5 or 10 mg/kg, ip) dose- and time-dependently decreased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and speed, but did not affect the percentage of open arm entries. Diazepam (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg, ip) did not affect pup retrieval, open arm time/entry in lactating rats. Thus, the percentage of open arm entries appears to be the most sensitive measure of anxiety in postpartum female rats, while speed could be used to index maternal responsiveness to pups, which are likely mediated by the dopamine D2 and serotonin transporter systems.",

Sixty-four patients undergoing CABG were randomly assigned to one of two study groups: midazolam-fentanyl (MF, N=32) or propofol-remifentanil (PR, N=32). The BIS was measured before induction of anesthesia, five minutes after induction of anesthesia, at skin incision, sternotomy, pericardiotomy, aorta cannulation, onset of cardiopulmonary bypass, during rewarming, five minutes after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass, at thorax closure, and at the end of the surgery. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to age and gender. The difference in mean BIS between the two groups was significant (P<0.05) at all times, except before induction, five minutes after induction, at skin incision and on rewarming.

    "84": "Antipsychotic agents are used for the treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with several brain disorders, such as schizophrenia. Atypical and typical antipsychotics differ regarding their clinical and side-effects profile. Haloperidol is a representative typical antipsychotic drug and has potent dopamine receptor antagonistic functions; however, atypical antipsychotics have been developed and characterized an important advance in the treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Purine nucleotides and nucleosides, such as ATP and adenosine, constitute a ubiquitous class of extracellular signaling molecules crucial for normal functioning of the nervous system. Indirect findings suggest that changes in the purinergic system, more specifically in adenosinergic activity, could be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We investigated the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics on ectonucleotidase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities, followed by an analysis of gene expression patterns in zebrafish brain. Haloperidol treatment (9 \u00b5M) was able to decrease ATP hydrolysis (35%), whereas there were no changes in hydrolysis of ADP and AMP in brain membranes after antipsychotic exposure. Adenosine deamination in membrane fractions was inhibited (38%) after haloperidol treatment when compared to the control; however, no changes were observed in ADA soluble fractions after haloperidol exposure. Sulpiride (250 \u00b5M) and olanzapine (100 \u00b5M) did not alter ectonucleotidase and ADA activities. Haloperidol also led to a decrease in entpd2_mq, entpd3 and adal mRNA transcripts. These findings demonstrate that haloperidol is an inhibitor of NTPDase and ADA activities in zebrafish brain, suggesting that purinergic signaling may also be a target of pharmacological effects promoted by this drug.",

The aim of the study was to pharmacologically evaluate the beneficial effect of andrographolide on stress-induced thermoregulatory and other physiological responses in mice. A stress-induced hyperthermia test was conducted in mice. The test agents were orally administered once daily for 11 consecutive days, and treatment effects on body weight changes, basal rectal temperature, and foot-shock-triggered hyperthermic responses were quantified on Day 1, Day 5, Day 7, and Day 10 of the experiments. Pentobarbital-induced hypnosis was quantified on the 11(th) day of treatment. Observations made during a pilot dose finding experiment revealed that, like A.\u00a0paniculata extracts, pure andrographolide also possess adaptogenic properties. Observed dose-dependent efficacies of 3\u00a0mg/kg/d, 10\u00a0mg/kg/d, and 30\u00a0mg/kg/d andrographolide in the pilot experiment were reconfirmed by conducting two further analogous experiments using separate groups of either male or female mice. In these confirmatory experiments, efficacies of andrographolide were compared with that of 5\u00a0mg/kg/d oral doses of the standard anxiolytic diazepam. Significantly reduced body weights and elevated core temperatures of the three vehicle-treated control groups observed on the 5(th) day and subsequent observational days were completely absent even in the groups treated with the lowest andrographolide dose (3\u00a0mg/kg/d) or diazepam (5\u00a0mg/kg/d). Benzodiazepine-like potentiation of pentobarbital hypnosis was observed in andrographolide-treated animals. These observations reveal that andrographolide is functionally a diazepam-like desensitizer of biological mechanisms, and processes involved in stress trigger thermoregulatory and other physiological responses.",

Here, we further analyze the roles of 5-HT and another biogenic amine, dopamine (DA), on the crayfish response to stress. We show that the intensity of crayfish ALB depends on the intensity of stressful stimulation and is associated with increased concentrations of 5-HT in the brain. These 5-HT levels were significantly correlated, before, as well as after stress, with those of DA, which were approximately 3- to 5-times less abundant. However, whereas the degree of ALB was clearly correlated with brain 5-HT concentrations, it was not significantly correlated with DA. Moreover, in contrast to injections of 5-HT, DA injections were not able to elicit a stress response or ALB. In addition, 5-HT and DA levels were not modified by treatment with the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide, confirming that suppression of ALB by this GABA-A receptor ligand acts downstream and is independent of changes in crayfish bioamine levels. Our study also provides evidence that the anxiogenic effect of 5-HT injections can be prevented by a preliminary injection of 5-HT antagonists. Altogether, our results emphasize that the rises in brain concentrations of 5-HT, but not DA, play a role in controlling the induction and the intensity of crayfish ALB.",

The first mandatory step in the therapeutic strategy remains withdrawal of the abused drug, preferably abrupt, in concomitance with a detoxification pharmacological regimen to lessen withdrawal symptoms. Intravenous hydration, antiemetics, corticosteroids (prednisone), tranquilizers (benzodiazepine), neuroleptics, and rescue medication (another analgesic than the overused) should be delivered in various combinations, on an inpatient (hospitalization and day hospital) basis or outpatient basis, depending on the characteristics of the specific patient and type of overuse. Inpatient withdrawal should be preferred in barbiturate and opioid overuse, in concomitant depression, or, in general, in patients who have difficulty in stopping the overused medication as outpatients. In contrast, in overuse limited to simple analgesics in highly motivated patients, without high levels of depression and/or anxiety, home detoxification should be chosen. Re-prophylaxis should immediately follow detoxification, ideally with local injections of onabotulinumtoxinA every 3\u00a0months or topiramate orally for at least 3\u00a0months.

The mean concentrations in the emergency, general effluent and water course-receptor were as follows: 433.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.7, 349.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0 and 485.0\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6 ng L(-1), for carbamazepine and 550.0\u2009\u00b1\u20094.3, 441.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 and 586.6\u2009\u00b1\u20099.3 ng L(-1), for diazepam, respectively. Liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (LC-QqLIT-MS) proved to be a method fit-to-purpose. The determination of carbamazepine and diazepam, and the identification of active metabolites showing environmental persistence (carbamazepine-10-11-epoxide, nordiazepam and oxazepam) revealed the need for a more effective treatment of the HUSM effluent. As far as we know, no similar study has been carried out on the wastewater of Brazilian hospitals.", 
    "148": "An integrative population pharmacokinetics (PPK)-based approach was used to characterize the effect of hepatic impairment on clobazam PK and its major metabolite in systemic circulation, N-desmethylclobazam (N-CLB). At therapeutic clobazam dosages, N-CLB plasma concentrations are 3-5 times greater than the parent compound. PK data from clinical trials in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS; OV-1002 and OV-1012), healthy participants (OV-1016), and participants with and without renal impairment (OV-1032), as well as those from a publication describing the effects of hepatic impairment on clobazam PK, were merged to create the PPK model. Individual patient clobazam PK parameters from the publication were used to generate patient plasma-concentration data. Clobazam PK was linear and the formation of N-CLB was elimination-rate limited. Hepatic impairment did not affect the total apparent clearance of clobazam but may affect the PK of N-CLB. Because the formation of N-CLB is elimination-rate limited and the total apparent clearance of clobazam is unaffected by hepatic impairment, the PPK model suggests that patients with LGS and hepatic impairment may not require clobazam dosage modification.",

Thirty-eight percent of participants engaged in an individual behavioral intervention. Benzodiazepines were prescribed in 36% of discharges. Contrary to our hypothesis, individual behavioral interventions did not influence discharge benzodiazepine prescriptions. However, several other factors did, including having a substance use disorder [odds ratio (OR)=0.40].

Effects of intoxication are variable, more severe neurological symptoms can be observed following ingestion, thus hospital or intensive care unit admission is often required. Usually cannabinoids intoxicated patients are treated with administration of benzodiazepines or opioids, accepting the related risk of intubation and mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, with no effect on the respiratory drive and pattern and produces a good level of sedation, allowing to avoid the administration of other sedatives. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of dexmedetomidine use to support a cannabis intoxicated patient.",

    "160": "Post-translational modifications of the nucleosomal histone proteins orchestrate chromatin organization and gene expression in normal and cancer cells. Among them, the acetylation of N-terminal histone tails represents the fundamental epigenetic mark of open structure chromatin and active gene transcription. The bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins are epigenetic readers which utilize tandem bromodomains (BRD) modules to recognize and dock themselves on the acetylated lysine tails. The BET proteins act as scaffolds for the recruitment of transcription factors and chromatin organizers required in transcription initiation and elongation. The recent discovery of small molecules capable of blocking their lysine-binding pocket is the first paradigm of successful pharmacological inhibition of epigenetic readers. JQ1 is a prototype benzodiazepine molecule and a specific BET inhibitor with antineoplastic activity both in solid tumours and haematological malignancies. The quinolone I-BET151 and the suitable for clinical development I-BET762 benzodiazepine were introduced in parallel with JQ1 and have also shown potent antitumour activity in preclinical studies. I-BET762 is currently being tested in early phase clinical trials, along with a rapidly growing list of other BET inhibitors. Unlike older epigenetic therapies, the study of BET inhibitors has offered substantial, context-specific, mechanistic insights of their antitumour activity, which will facilitate optimal therapeutic targeting in future. Here, we review the development of this novel class of epigenetic drugs, the biology of BET protein inhibition, the emerging evidence from preclinical work and early phase clinical studies and we discuss their potential role in the treatment of haematological malignancies.",

Here, we aim to investigate the influence of vasopressin on anxiety during the early postnatal age. As a sign of distress, rat pups emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) when they are separated from their mother. This USV was detected in 7- to 8-day-old vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro pups, and they were compared to their heterozygote littermates and wild-type pups. The results were confirmed by V1b antagonist treatment (SSR149415 10 mg/kg ip 30 min before test) in wild-types. Chlordiazepoxide (3 mg/kg ip 30 min before test)-an anxiolytic-was used to test the interaction with the GABAergic system. At the end of the test, stress-hormone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Vasopressin-deficient pups vocalized substantially less than non-deficient counterparts. Treatment with V1b antagonist resulted in similar effect. Chlordiazepoxide reduced the frequency and duration of the vocalization only in wild-types. Reduced vocalization was accompanied by smaller adrenocorticotropin levels but the level of corticosterone was variable. Our results indicate that the anxiolytic effect of vasopressin deficiency (both genetic and pharmacological) exists already during the early postnatal age. Vasopressin interacts with the GABAergic system. As mood regulation does not go parallel with glucocorticoid levels, we suggest that vasopressin might have a direct effect on special brain areas.",

    "178": "Perinatal generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has a high prevalence of 8.5%-10.5% during pregnancy and 4.4%-10.8% postpartum. Despite its attendant dysfunction in the patient, this potentially debilitating mental health condition is often underdiagnosed. This overview will provide guidance for clinicians in making timely diagnosis and managing symptoms appropriately. A significant barrier to the diagnosis of GAD in the perinatal population is difficulty in distinguishing normal versus pathological worry. Because a perinatal-specific screening tool for GAD is nonexistent, early identification, diagnosis and treatment is often compromised. The resultant maternal dysfunction can potentially impact mother-infant bonding and influence neurodevelopmental outcomes in the children. Comorbid occurrence of GAD and major depressive disorder changes the illness course and its treatment outcome. Psychoeducation is a key component in overcoming denial/stigma and facilitating successful intervention. Treatment strategies are contingent upon illness severity. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), relaxation, and mindfulness therapy are indicated for mild GAD. Moderate/severe illness requires pharmacotherapy and CBT, individually or in combination. No psychotropic medications are approved by the FDA or Health Canada in pregnancy or the postpartum; off-label pharmacological treatment is instituted only if the benefit of therapy outweighs its risk. SSRIs/SNRIs are the first-line treatment for anxiety disorders due to data supporting their efficacy and overall favorable side effect profile. Benzodiazepines are an option for short-term treatment. While research on atypical antipsychotics is evolving, some can be considered for severe manifestations where the response to antidepressants or benzodiazepines has been insufficient.

Sixty-three patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) who had been treated with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; fluoxetine, citalopram or sertraline) were included in the study. The patients' depression had improved [Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) <10] but they were complaining of sleeping problems [Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) >5; Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) >8]. Patients were randomized to receive a flexible dose of gabapentin (100-600 mg/day) or clonazepam (0.5-2 mg/day) beside their current antidepressant medication for a period of 4 weeks. Outcome measures were PSQI, ISI and Clinical Global Impression (CGI).", 
    "206": "Our results demonstrated that similar to the clonazepam group, sleeping problems improved significantly in the gabapentin group at the end of the trial (PSQI: P = 0.001, Z = 3.549; ISI: P = 0.001, Z = 3.347). The two groups did not show a significant difference in treating residual sleep disturbances (PSQI: P = 0.234, Z = 1.432; ISI: P = 0.456, Z = 1.347).", 
    "207": "This study revealed that gabapentin is comparable to clonazepam for treating sleeping problems associated with major depression.", 
    "208": "Several factors may influence the efficacy of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in patients with epilepsy, and treatment resistance could be related to genetics, neuronal network alterations, and modification of drug transporters or targets. Consequently, preclinical models used for the identification of potential new, more efficacious AEDs should reflect at least a few of these factors. Previous studies indicate that induction of status epilepticus (SE) may alter drug efficacy and that this effect could be long-lasting. In this context, we wanted to assess the protective effects of mechanistically diverse AEDs in mice subjected to pilocarpine-induced SE in another seizure model. We first determined seizure thresholds in mice subjected to pilocarpine-induced SE in the 6-Hz model, 2 weeks and 8 weeks following SE. We then evaluated the protective effects of mechanistically diverse AEDs in post-SE and control animals. No major differences in 6-Hz seizure susceptibility were observed between control groups, while the seizure threshold of pilocarpine mice at 8 weeks after SE was higher than at 2 weeks and higher than in control groups. Treatment with AEDs revealed major differences in drug response depending on their mechanism of action. Diazepam produced a dose-dependent protection against 6-Hz seizures in control and pilocarpine mice, both at 2 weeks and 8 weeks after SE, but with a more pronounced increase in potency in post-SE animals at 2 weeks. Levetiracetam induced a potent and dose-dependent protection in pilocarpine mice, 2 weeks after SE, while its protective effects were observed only at much higher doses in control mice. Its potency decreased in post-SE mice at 8 weeks and was very limited (30% protection at the highest tested dose) in the control group. Carbamazepine induced a dose-dependent protection at 2 weeks in control mice but only limited effect (50% at the highest tested dose) in pilocarpine mice. Its efficacy deeply decreased in post-SE mice at 8 weeks after SE. Perampanel and phenytoin showed almost comparable protective effects in all groups of mice. These experiments confirm that prior SE may have an impact on both potency and efficacy of AEDs and indicate that this effect may be dependent on the underlying epileptogenic processes.

    "218": "This study aimed to explore the impact of depression caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) on in vivo activity of six kinds of CYP450 isoforms in rats. According to 'Katz' method, the model of CUMS was established. Tolbutamide, chlorzoxazone, theophylline, midazolam, omeprazole and dextromethorphan were chosen as probe substrates of CYP2C6, CYP2E1, CYP1A2, CYP3A2, CYP2D1 and CYP2D2 of rats. Plasma concentration of six kinds of CYP450 in control group and model group were determined by LC-MS/MS and computed pharmacokinetic parameters. Consequently, metabolism of theophylline and chlorzoxazone accelerated significantly (P < 0.01), but tolbutamide, dextromethorphan, omeprazole and midazolam had no significant difference. The present study proved that depression caused by CUMS had strong induction to CYP1A2 and medium induction to CYP2E1.", 
    "219": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs), including diazepam (DZP) and midazolam (MDZ), are drugs of choice for rapid treatment of seizure emergencies. Current approved use of these drugs involves administration via either intravenous or rectal routes. The former requires trained medical personnel, while the latter is socially unacceptable for many patients and caregivers. In recent years, efforts have been made to formulate BZDs for nasal administration. Because of the low solubility of these molecules, organic vehicles have been used to solubilize the drugs in the nasal products under development. However, organic solvents are irritating, potentially resulting in injury to nasal tissue. Here we report preliminary studies supporting a strategy in which water-soluble BZD prodrugs and a suitable converting enzyme are coadministered in an aqueous vehicle. Diazepam and midazolam prodrugs were synthesized and were readily converted to their active forms by a protease from Aspergillus oryzae. Using a permeation assay based on monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney II-wild type cells, we found that enzymatically produced BZDs could be maintained at high degrees of supersaturation, enabling faster transport across the membrane than can be achieved using saturated solutions. This strategy not only obviates the need for organic solvents, but it also suggests more rapid absorption and earlier peak concentrations than can be otherwise achieved.

    "258": "Recent evidence favors the view of catatonia as an autonomous syndrome, frequently associated with mood disorders, but also observed in neurological, neurodevelopmental, physical and toxic conditions. From our systematic literature review, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) results effective in all forms of catatonia, even after pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines has failed. Response rate ranges from 80% to 100% and results superior to those of any other therapy in psychiatry. ECT should be considered first-line treatment in patients with malignant catatonia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, delirious mania or severe catatonic excitement, and in general in all catatonic patients that are refractory or partially responsive to benzodiazepines. Early intervention with ECT is encouraged to avoid undue deterioration of the patient's medical condition. Little is known about the long-term treatment outcomes following administration of ECT for catatonia. The presence of a concomitant chronic neurologic disease or extrapyramidal deficit seems to be related to ECT non-response. On the contrary, the presence of acute, severe and psychotic mood disorder is associated with good response. Severe psychotic features in responders may be related with a prominent GABAergic mediated deficit in orbitofrontal cortex, whereas non-responders may be characterized by a prevalent dopaminergic mediated extrapyramidal deficit. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that ECT is more effective in \"top-down\" variant of catatonia, in which the psychomotor syndrome may be sustained by a dysregulation of the orbitofrontal cortex, than in \"bottom-up\" variant, in which an extrapyramidal dysregulation may be prevalent. Future research should focus on ECT response in different subtype of catatonia and on efficacy of maintenance ECT in long-term prevention of recurrent catatonia. Further research on mechanism of action of ECT in catatonia may also contribute to the development of other brain stimulation techniques.",

    "267": "Reportedly, negative modulation of \u03b15 GABAA receptors may improve cognition in normal and pharmacologically-impaired animals, and such modulation has been proposed as an avenue for treatment of cognitive symptoms in schizophrenia. This study assessed the actions of PWZ-029, administered at doses (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg) at which it reached micromolar concentrations in brain tissue with estimated free concentrations adequate for selective modulation of \u03b15 GABAA receptors, in three cognitive tasks in male Wistar rats acutely treated with the noncompetitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, MK-801 (0.1 mg/kg), as well in tests of locomotor activity potentiated by MK-801 (0.2 mg/kg) or amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). In a hormetic-like manner, only 5 mg/kg PWZ-029 reversed MK-801-induced deficits in novel object recognition test (visual recognition memory), whereas in the Morris water maze, the 2 mg/kg dose of PWZ-029 exerted partial beneficial effects on spatial learning impairment. PWZ-029 did not affect recognition memory de\ufb01cits in social novelty discrimination procedure. Motor hyperactivity induced with MK-801 or amphetamine was not preventable by PWZ-029. Our results show that certain MK-801-induced memory deficits can be ameliorated by negative modulation of \u03b15 GABAA receptors, and point to the need for further elucidation of their translational relevance to cognitive deterioration in schizophrenia.", 
    "268": "Release from prison is a period of elevated risk for drug-related harms, particularly among people who inject drugs (PWID). Non-fatal overdose can cause serious morbidity and predicts future fatal overdose, however neither the incidence nor the risk factors for non-fatal overdose following release from prison are well understood.", 
    "269": "Structured health-related interviews were conducted with 1051 adult prisoners in Queensland, Australia prior to release and approximately 1, 3 and 6 months post-release. Incidence of self-reported overdose in the community was calculated for PWID and all prisoners for three discrete time periods. Negative binomial regression with robust error variance was used to identify pre-release predictors of overdose among PWID.", 
    "270": "The incidence of reported overdose was highest between 1 and 3 months post-release (37.8 per 100 person-years (PY) among PWID; 24.5/100 PY among all ex-prisoners). In adjusted analyses, the risk of post-release non-fatal overdose was higher for PWID who reported: being unemployed for >6 months before prison, having been removed from family as a child, at least weekly use of benzodiazepines and/or pharmaceutical opiates in the 3 months prior to prison, and ever receiving opioid substitution therapy (OST). Pre-release psychological distress and a lifetime history of mental disorder also predicted overdose, whereas risky alcohol use in the year before prison was protective.", 
    "271": "PWID have a high risk of overdose following release from prison. Imprisonment is an opportunity to initiate targeted preventive interventions such as OST, overdose prevention training and peer-delivered naloxone for those with a high risk profile."
