This agent is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. Preclinical studies have shown that the benzodiazepines triazolam and Ro17-1812 can substitute for zaleplon in animals trained to distinguish zaleplon from saline. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil can antagonise the discriminative stimulus effect of zaleplon. These findings suggest that zaleplon is recognised by animals as a benzodiazepine agent. Zaleplon is active after ip. and oral administration in a variety of motor performance tests, including locomotor activity, rotarod and the loaded grid. Zaleplon has been shown to be active in a number of different anticonvulsant models, including the pentylenetetrazole, isoniazid and electroshock models. The compound is also reported to be active against convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and strychnine. Studies in anxiolytic models suggest that zaleplon may have weak anxiolytic activity. From preclinical studies, it appears zaleplon possesses a reduced risk of tolerance compared to triazolam, is less likely to potentiate the effects of ethanol and is unlikely to produce amnestic effects. In man, zaleplon is rapidly absorbed and undergoes extensive presystemic metabolism. The compound has a plasma half-life of approximately one hour and is metabolised primarily via the aldehyde oxidase system to form 5-oxo-zaleplon. This metabolite, along with other minor metabolites formed in vivo, do not appear to contribute to the activity of zaleplon. Metabolites of zaleplon are excreted primarily via the urine. Phase I studies suggest that single daytime doses of zaleplon up to 15 mg are well-tolerated. Short-term impairment of performance occurs when zaleplon is administered during the day at doses epsilon 20 mg. However, given the short half-life of the compound, significant impairment of daytime performance is unlikely if zaleplon is administered at bedtime or shortly after retiring for the evening. Results from Phase II/III studies suggest that zaleplon (5 - 20 mg) produces a dose-dependent reduction in sleep latency in patients suffering from primary insomnia. The clinical efficacy of zaleplon persists for at least four weeks at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg. Studies in patients with a history of drug abuse suggest that the abuse potential of zaleplon (at doses above the therapeutic dose range) is similar to that seen with the benzodiazepine triazolam.", 
    "1": "The benzodiazepine, lorazepam enhances the efficiency of local, inhibitory GABA(A) synapses in the cortex, which stabilize postsynaptic, excitatory activity by synchronizing their own discharges at around 40 Hz. Treatment with lorazepam has also been shown to adversely influence detection performance in perceptual tasks, suggesting a role for GABA(A)-mediated synchronization during visuo-perceptual organization. Consistent with these findings we report that reaction times to target stimuli were slower following lorazepam treatment. However, when targets followed presentation of a synchronized prime, presented within a flickering 40-Hz display matrix, the effects of priming were amplified relative to baseline and control conditions. We conclude that enhanced GABA(A)-induced inhibition enhances stimulus-evoked synchronization with differential effects upon mechanisms of perceptual segmentation and grouping.", 
    "2": "The aim of the study was to assess the diagnoses and pharmacological treatment in 80 patients with symptoms of depression in reference to the psychiatric examination due to disability pension proceedings. Diagnoses were often not in accordance with the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10). Twenty two per cent of outpatients were treated using benzodiazepines only. In the group of antidepressants, mianserin, fluoxetine and doxepine were used most often (in 12%, 12% and 11% of outpatients respectively). Inpatients were usually treated with doxepine (24%) and mianserin (18%). As many as 15% of patients received benzodiazapines as the only drug during the hospitalisation. In contrast to the newer generation of drugs (moclobemide, fluoxetine), tricyclic antidepressants were usually used in low, not therapeutic doses. Further studies on the quality of treatment of depression in Poland, based on the more representative groups are necessary.", 
    "3": "Several studies have provided evidence that antagonists and partial agonists of glycine(B) receptors exhibit an anxiolytic-like activity in different animal models.", 
    "4": "Using the conflict-drinking Vogel test in rats as a model, in the present study we examined the anxiolytic-like activity of D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist of the glycine(B) site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex. Diazepam was used as a reference drug.", 
    "5": "DCS (200 and 300 mg/kg) and diazepam (5 mg/kg) produced an anxiolytic-like effect in rats by increasing the number of shocks accepted. We also demonstrated that NMDA (15 mg/kg) reduced the anxiolytic-like activity of DCS (200 mg/kg), whereas glycine (800 mg/kg) and flumazenil (10 mg/kg) did not affect the anticonflict effect of DCS (200 mg/kg). The anticonflict effect of diazepam (5 mg/kg) was totally blocked by flumazenil (10 mg/kg).", 
    "6": "The obtained results have shown that DCS exhibits an anxiolytic-like activity which depends on NMDA receptors rather than on glycine(B) or benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "7": "Administration of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine (BZD) antagonist, has therapeutic efficacy against some anxiogenic effects of ethanol withdrawal. This observation has led to the suggestion that anxiety associated with ethanol withdrawal is related to release in brain of an endogenous BZD inverse agonist.", 
    "8": "The present studies further tested this hypothesis by assessing the effect of flumazenil on withdrawal-induced changes in a behavioral task and on the expression of the neuronal protein, Fos.", 
    "9": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were withdrawn from a chronic ethanol regimen and tested, with or without flumazenil pretreatment, for either ultrasonic vocalization in response to air puff or for the induction of Fos protein-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in brain. In addition, flumazenil effects on Fos-LI were measured in a group of animals treated with the BZD inverse agonist DMCM (0.75 and 1.0 mg/kg).", 
    "10": "Flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the number of ultrasonic vocalizations observed following withdrawal from chronic ethanol. In contrast, flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg), given either 14 h before withdrawal from chronic ethanol, or during hours 3 and 5 following withdrawal, did not attenuate the effects of withdrawal on Fos-LI. Subsequent testing with DMCM confirmed that a benzodiazepine inverse agonist can induce Fos-LI in most of the same brain regions as observed following ethanol withdrawal, and that this change in Fos protein can be attenuated by pretreatment with flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg).", 
    "11": "Overall, these results demonstrate that specific behavioral indices of anxiety, but not measures of Fos-LI, support the contribution of an endogenous BZD inverse agonist in the ethanol withdrawal syndrome.",

    "13": "To characterize the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol, pentobarbital, midazolam, muscimol and morphine in male and female monkeys under different ethanol training conditions.", 
    "14": "Adult male (n=8) and female (n=10) Macaca fascicularis monkeys were divided into four groups and trained to discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol (n=8) versus water or 2.0 g/kg ethanol (n=10) versus water in a 2x2 design with training dose and sex as main group factors. Solutions were administered intragastrically (20% ethanol w/v) and responding was maintained under a fixed-ratio schedule of food reinforcement. Dose-response determinations of ethanol, pentobarbital, midazolam, muscimol and morphine were made under the training condition of 30 min pretreatment interval. The ethanol pretreatment interval in training sessions was then increased to 60 min and the effects of ethanol, pentobarbital and midazolam were redetermined.", 
    "15": "Training dose influenced the ED50 of ethanol to produce substitution under both pretreatment intervals and pentobarbital to produce substitution under the 30-min pretreatment training interval. There were no group differences in sensitivity to midazolam. The potency of the ligands to produce ethanol substitution was consistent across groups with midazolam>pentobarbital>ethanol. There were no sex differences in substitution of the ligands for ethanol. Blood ethanol concentrations at the onset of ethanol training sessions were higher in the 2.0 g/kg groups and under longer pretreatment times, but were not different on the basis of sex.", 
    "16": "Pentobarbital and midazolam produce ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects in male and female cynomolgus monkeys suggesting a significant GABA(A) component mediating the behavioral effects of ethanol. There was limited evidence that training dose of ethanol influenced substitution pattern of the GABA(A) ligands in cynomolgus monkeys, unlike previous findings in rats. Finally, there appear to be no sex differences in the profile of GABA(A) mechanisms involved in the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol.", 
    "17": "The effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists on the emotional behavior of naive or stressed mice were examined and compared with those of benzodiazepine anxiolytics.", 
    "18": "Changes in the emotional state of mice were evaluated in terms of changes in exploratory activity, i.e. total locomotor activity, numbers and duration of rearing and head-dipping and latency to the first head-dipping, using an automatic holeboard apparatus.", 
    "19": "The 5-HT(1A) receptor full agonists flesinoxan (0.03-1 mg/kg, IP) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.03-1 mg/kg, IP), and the partial agonist buspirone (0.3-10 mg/kg, IP) dose-dependently decreased all of the exploratory behaviors. Significant decreases in both the number and duration of head-dips, and an increase in the latency to head-dipping were observed at 30 min after exposure to acute restraint stress (60 min). These emotional changes were scarcely improved by post-stress treatment with 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists, at doses that alone did not produce a significant behavioral effect. In contrast, pretreatment with flesinoxan (0.1-1 mg/kg, IP) or 8-OH-DPAT (0.1-1 mg/kg, IP) 24 h prior to exposure to stress dose-dependently suppressed the decrease in various exploratory behaviors that was observed immediately after the exposure to acute restraint stress. Moreover, pretreatment with buspirone (1-10 mg/kg, IP) 24 h prior to exposure to stress also significantly suppressed the decrease in rearing behavior and the increase in head-dip latency. However, changes in the emotional response to stress stimuli were not observed in mice that had been pretreated with the benzodiazepine anxiolytics diazepam (0.1-1 mg/kg, IP) and chlordiazepoxide (2-8 mg/kg, IP).", 
    "20": "The present study clearly demonstrates that the behavioral effects of 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists in both naive and stressed mice were quite different from those of benzodiazepine anxiolytics, as previously reported by us. Notably, 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists but not benzodiazepine anxiolytics protect against various emotional changes produced by stress stimuli, and the results suggest that activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors may facilitate some mechanism(s) involved in the recognition of and/or ability to cope with stressful situation.", 
    "21": "Benzodiazepines are used to treat the anxiety associated with cocaine withdrawal, as well as cocaine-induced seizures. Since cocaine exposure was shown to affect BZ binding density, abuse liability, subjective hypnotic actions and seizure susceptibility, we assessed whether chronic cocaine alters diazepam's anxiolytic and anticonvulsant actions. Changes in GABA(A) receptor subunit protein expression were also assessed as they may relate to BZ activity at the receptor. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with cocaine-HCl (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily for 14 days. One day after the last injection, DZP (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increased time spent on and entries into open arms of an elevated plus maze in both saline- and cocaine-treated groups, yet the effect was greater in cocaine-treated rats. Eight days after cessation of treatment DZP did not have a significant anxiolytic effect in either group. To assess the effect of cocaine on DZP's anticonvulsant actions, PTZ was infused at a constant rate via the lateral tail vein and clonus onset was recorded in the presence and absence of DZP (5 mg/kg, i.p). DZP significantly elevated seizure threshold in both groups of rats. Chronic cocaine also had no effect on the beta-CCM seizure threshold. Quantitative immunohistochemistry of GABA(A) receptor subunit protein demonstrated significant regulation of alpha2 (-10%) and beta3 (+9%) subunits in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and CA1 regions, respectively. Small changes in GABAR subunit expression in specific brain areas may relate to DZP's enhanced anxiolytic effectiveness whereas it's anticonvulsant actions likely remain intact following cocaine administration.", 
    "22": "We investigated the roles of kainate-, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-propionate (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors in mediating striatal kainate injection-induced decrease in the binding of acetylcholine M(1) receptors in rat forebrain. After unilateral intrastriatal injection of kainate (4 nmol), the bindings of [3H]kainate (10 nM), [3H]MK-801 (4 nM) and [3H]pirenzepine (4 nM) to the rat ipsilateral forebrain membranes declined, reaching the lowest on day 2 to 4 and recovering on day 8. Saturation binding studies, performed on day 2 post-injection, showed that kainate (1, 2, 4 nmol) dose-dependently decreased B(max) and K(d) of the three ligands. (+)-5-Methyl-10, 11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801), a selective NMDA receptor channel blocker, antagonised (from a dose of 4 nmol) kainate-induced decreases in the bindings of [3H]kainate (up to approximately 20%), [3H]MK-801 (up to approximately 90%) and [3H]pirenzepine (up to approximately 70%). In contrast, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), a selective non-NMDA receptor antagonist, almost completely abolished (from a dose of 12 nmol) kainate-induced decreases in the bindings of all the three ligands (up to approximately 95-98%). Cyclothiazide, a selective potentiator that enhances AMPA receptor-mediated responses, significantly enhanced (from a dose of 4 nmol) kainate-induced decrease in the binding of [3H]kainate but not that of [3H]pirenzepine or [3H]MK-801. In summary, these results indicate that striatal kainate injection-induced decrease in the binding of acetylcholine M(1) receptors in rat forebrain is dependent on activation of kainate receptors and, to a certain extent, a consequent involvement of NMDA receptors. These and previous studies provide some evidence showing that kainate receptors might play a crucial role in regulating excitatory amino acids (EAA)-modulated cholinergic neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS).", 
    "23": "Individuals chronically exposed to low levels of organophosphate insecticides may present with subtle impairments in cognition. In addition, low level diisopropylflurophosphate (DFP) exposure (0.25 mg/kg per day for 2 weeks) in rats resulted in protracted working memory impairment [29]. The current studies attempt to show a temporal relationship between the DFP-induced impairment in performance of a spatial memory task and the protracted decrease in the expression of cholinergic receptors and acetylcholinesterase in specific brain regions. Cholinergic receptors labeled with the ligands [(3)H]epibatidine and [(3)H]AFDX-384 were affected to a much greater extent and for a longer period of time than were both acetylcholinesterase activities and cholinergic receptors labeled with [(3)H]QNB. Pre-testing administration of nicotine was shown to completely reverse this DFP-induced impairment in memory-related task performance. Additionally, prophylaxis with pyridostigmine bromide (PB) caused DFP-treated animals to exhibit near normal levels of memory-related task performance. These results are consistent with the development of a protracted phase of learning impairment to sub-acute DFP exposure, which may involve the loss of hippocampal nicotinic receptors, and may be prevented or reversed by PB or nicotine, respectively.", 
    "24": "The influence of naloxone and naltrexone on the motor-impairing effects of diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam and estazolam were studied in the aerial righting reflex test (mice, rats), and the first two drugs were examined in the rota-rod test (mice). Benzodiazepine-induced motor incoordination was significantly decreased by naloxone and naltrexone (4-16 mg/kg) in mice and rats in aerial righting reflex test. The motor-impairing effects of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide observed in rota-rod test were significantly diminished only by naltrexone (8-16 mg/kg). These data seem to confirm some interactions between benzodiazepines and opioid system.", 
    "25": "The correlation of vitamin A with the binding characteristics of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in testes have been implicated on the basis of findings of involvement of vitamin A in testicular physiology and the abundance of PBRs in testicular tissue. Both vitamin A and PBRs are involved in the control of cell proliferation and differentiation but no data exists regarding the relationship between them. In the present study, we have examined the effects of vitamin A deficiency on the affinity and density of PBRs in testes of guinea pigs. Weanling guinea pigs were divided into three groups: control, pair-fed control and vitamin A deficient. They were fed a complete semipurified diet. The vitamin A deficient diet was similar to the control diet except vitamin A palmitate was omitted. Vitamin A deficiency status was achieved after 90 days of feeding. Binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864, a specific ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors was determined in whole homogenate of testicular tissue. There was a 77% decrease in the receptor density (B max) in vitamin A deficient group compared to control. The Bmax values for control, pair-fed control and vitamin A deficient groups were: 12.4 +/- 0.4, 8.8 +/- 0.2 and 3.0 +/- 0.6 pmol/g, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant (K(D)) values were also 86% decreased in the vitamin A deficient group compared to the other groups. The K(D) values for control, pair-fed control and vitamin A deficient groups were: 3.4 +/- 0.7, 2.8 +/- 0.5 and 0.5 +/- 0.01, respectively. The decrease in the binding characteristics of PBRs in testes due to vitamin A deficiency was accompanied with a corresponding decrease in the levels of testosterone in plasma. These results suggest a close functional relationship of vitamin A with PBRs in testes.",

    "27": "To report the first published case of olanzapine-induced acute pancreatitis.", 
    "28": "A 72-year-old white woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis and unintentional verapamil overdose. The patient did not consume alcohol and had undergone a cholecystectomy in the past; other medical causes of pancreatitis had been ruled out. She was taking several medications chronically, but olanzapine was started six days prior to the onset of acute abdominal symptoms. According to the Naranjo probability scale, olanzapine was considered the probable cause of acute pancreatitis in this patient. Following a 12-day stay in the ICU, the patient was transferred to the ward where she died a few days later of unrelenting peritonitis secondary to acute pancreatitis.", 
    "29": "A literature search (1966-July 2000) and contact with the manufacturer failed to detect any published reports of acute pancreatitis associated with olanzapine. The contribution of concomitant medications taken prior to ICU admission in initiating or worsening the pancreatitis was deemed unlikely. More common causes of acute pancreatitis, such as ethanol consumption and gallstones, were also ruled out in this patient. Therefore, olanzapine was rated as a probable cause for acute pancreatitis in our patient. The mechanism of this adverse reaction is unknown.", 
    "30": "This is believed to be the first published report suspecting olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent, to have caused acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis in a patient, leading to admission to the ICU and, eventually, death secondary to unrelenting peritonitis.", 
    "31": "The restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a condition characterized by unpleasant limb sensations occurring at rest and associated with an irresistible urge to move. Several treatments are used to treat RLS including benzodiazepines, opioids, dopaminergic agents, clonidine and anticonvulsant drugs such as carbamazepine and gabapentine. Dopaminergic agents are now considered the treatment of choice for RLS. Levodopa is effective in treating RLS; however, several patients treated with levodopa at bedtime developed morning or late afternoon restlessness. Recently, more attention has been paid to dopamine receptor agonists. Ergoline derivatives, bromocriptine and pergolide were found effective, but require concomitant administration of domperidone, a peripheral dopamine antagonist. In a recent study, we studied the efficacy and innocuity of pramipexole, a new dopamine agonist with a higher affinity for the D3 receptor subtype of the D2 family, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. Pramipexole had major effects on RLS symptoms without severe side-effects. The present study aimed to assess the long-term efficacy of pramipexole. Seven patients were treated with the drug for a mean follow-up duration of 7.8 months. Treatment was started at a dosage of 0.25 mg, and progressively increased until the optimal therapeutic effect was obtained. Home questionnaires were completed for 7 consecutive days, after one month and after a mean of 7.8 months of treatment with pramipexole, assessing leg restlessness during the daytime, in the evening, at bedtime and during the night. There was no evidence of a decrease in the therapeutic effect of pramipexole in these patients, even 7.8 months after the initiation of treatment. The optimal dosage was 0.25 mg for one patient, 0.5 mg for five patients and 0.75 mg for one patient. While there was a progressive increase in severity of leg restlessness from daytime to nighttime before treatment, a suppression of leg restlessness was observed throughout the 24 h with a single dose of pramipexole at bedtime. The remarkable efficacy of pramipexole raises the possibility that the D3 receptors of the mesolimbic system may be more specifically involved in the physiopathology of RLS.", 
    "32": "Receptor characterization in human esophageal smooth muscle is limited by tissue availability. We used human esophageal smooth muscle cells in culture to examine the expression and function of muscarinic receptors. Primary cultures were established using cells isolated by enzymatic digestion of longitudinal muscle (LM) and circular muscle (CM) obtained from patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer. Cultured cells grew to confluence after 10-14 days in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and stained positively for anti-smooth muscle specific alpha-actin. mRNA encoding muscarinic receptor subtypes M(1)-M(5) was identified by RT-PCR. The expression of corresponding protein for all five subtypes was confirmed by immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry. Functional responses were assessed by measuring free intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) using fura 2 fluorescence. Basal [Ca(2+)](i), which was 135 +/- 22 nM, increased transiently to 543 +/- 29 nM in response to 10 microM ACh in CM cells (n = 8). This response was decreased <95% by 0.01 microM 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine, a M(1)/M(3)-selective antagonist, whereas 0.1 microM methoctramine, a M(2)/M(4)-selective antagonist, and 0.1 microM pirenzepine, a M(1)-selective antagonist, had more modest effects. LM and CM cells showed similar results. We conclude that human smooth muscle cells in primary culture express five muscarinic receptor subtypes and respond to ACh with a rise in [Ca(2+)](i) mediated primarily by the M(3) receptor and involving release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores. This culture model provides a useful tool for further study of esophageal physiology.", 
    "33": "M-mode and Doppler echocardiographic values were obtained from 30 normal adult ferrets (14 neutered females, 13 neutered males, 3 intact males) sedated with an intramuscular combination of ketamine hydrochloride and midazolam. Routine M-mode measurements of the left and right ventricle, left atrium (LA) and aorta (AO) and Doppler measurements of aortic and pulmonic outflow, and mitral inflow were recorded. The following values were calculated: LA:AO diameter, ratio of peak E: peak A wave velocity (E:A ratio) for mitral inflow, and stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and cardiac index (CI) for both pulmonary and aortic outflow tracts. Maximal aortic velocities (AOmax) and velocity-time integral values (AO VTI) were significantly less than corresponding pulmonary outflow tract values (PAmax, PA VTI) but there was no difference in calculated values for SV, CO or CI. Calculated CO values were in the range expected based on the size of the species. Difficulties in aligning the aortic outflow tract for Doppler imaging may make pulmonary outflow Doppler values more consistent for use in estimating volume flow in ferrets.", 
    "34": "To survey the characteristics of epilepsy in patients with juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (JNCL) and determine the antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment most suitable for these patients.", 
    "35": "The study included 60 patients with JNCL; their mean age was 16.5 years (range 5-33). The age at onset of epilepsy, type of seizures, effect of the first AED on seizures, and the current seizure frequency and AED therapy were studied. The side effects of the AEDs were also clarified.", 
    "36": "Fifty of the 60 patients had epilepsy. Patients' first epileptic seizure occurred at a mean age of 10.0 years (range 5-16), the most common type being generalized seizures. As the first AED tried, valproate (VPA) and lamotrigine (LTG) appeared equally effective, with 80% of the patients responding to these AEDs. During the study year, the median seizure frequency was four seizures a year (range 0-120), and 72% of the patients had good or satisfactory seizure control (0-6 seizures a year). In the different AED therapy groups, the proportion of patients with good or satisfactory seizure control ranged from 25% to 100%. LTG in monotherapy or in combination with clonazepam (CZP) was superior to other AEDs or combinations, but VPA also seemed effective. Adverse effects leading to the discontinuation of an AED were observed in 25% of the patients, most frequently in patients receiving phenobarbital (PB). No patient receiving LTG had to discontinue the drug due to adverse effects.", 
    "37": "Epilepsy in JNCL can usually be successfully treated with the current AEDs. In Finnish patients with JNCL, treatment is based on LTG, or, secondarily, VPA. In combination therapy, CZP seems a valuable add-on AED.", 
    "38": "Emotional changes can influence feeding behavior. Previous studies have shown that chronically stressed animals present increased ingestion of sweet food, an effect reversed by a single dose of diazepam administered before testing the animals. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the response of animals chronically treated with midazolam and/or submitted to repeated restraint stress upon the ingestion of sweet food. Male adult Wistar rats were divided into two groups: controls and exposed to restraint 1 h/day, 5 days/week for 40 days. Both groups were subdivided into two other groups treated or not with midazolam (0.06 mg/ml in their drinking water during the 40-day treatment). The animals were placed in a lighted area in the presence of 10 pellets of sweet food (Froot loops). The number of ingested pellets was measured during a period of 3 min, in the presence or absence of fasting. The group chronically treated with midazolam alone presented increased ingestion when compared to control animals (control group: 2.0 +/- 0.44 pellets and midazolam group: 3.60 +/- 0.57 pellets). The group submitted to restraint stress presented an increased ingestion compared to controls (control group: 2.0 +/- 0.44 pellets and stressed group: 4.18 +/- 0.58 pellets). Chronically administered midazolam reduced the ingestion in stressed animals (stressed/water group: 4.18 +/- 0.58 pellets; stressed/midazolam group: 3.2 +/- 0.49 pellets). Thus, repeated stress increases appetite for sweet food independently of hunger and chronic administration of midazolam can decrease this behavioral effect.", 
    "39": "Systemic administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a prompt anticonvulsant effect in pilocarpine-induced seizures in freely moving rats. The anticonvulsant effect was associated with significant attenuation of pilocarpine-evoked increases in extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels to below the baseline levels. The purpose of the present microdialysis study, therefore, was to investigate if the effect of diazepam on glutamate release was mediated at the level of the benzodiazepine gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex to preclude any non-GABAergic mechanisms. Systemic administration of the specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg, i.p. )-elicited complete reversal of diazepam-evoked anticonvulsant action and concomitant attenuation of extracellular glutamate efflux below the baseline levels. This provides evidence that under the given experimental conditions, diazepam-evoked alterations in glutamate overflow associated with the anticonvulsant action were indeed mediated at the level of benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptor complex, possibly involving the modulation of both pre- and post-synaptic sites of the receptor complex.", 
    "40": "The neurotransmitters at synapses in taste buds are not yet known with confidence. Here we report a new calcium-imaging technique for taste buds that allowed us to test for the presence of glutamate receptors (GluRs) in living isolated tissue preparations. Taste cells of rat foliate papillae were loaded with calcium green dextran (CaGD). Lingual slices containing CaGD-labeled taste cells were imaged with a scanning confocal microscope and superfused with glutamate (30 micromter to 1 mm), kainate (30 and 100 micrometer), AMPA (30 and 100 micrometer), or NMDA (100 micrometer). Responses were observed in 26% of the cells that were tested with 300 micrometer glutamate. Responses to glutamate were localized to the basal processes and cell bodies, which are synaptic regions of taste cells. Glutamate responses were dose-dependent and were induced by concentrations as low as 30 microm. The non-NMDA receptor antagonists CNQX and GYKI 52466 reversibly blocked responses to glutamate. Kainate, but not AMPA, also elicited Ca(2+) responses. NMDA stimulated increases in [Ca(2+)](i) when the bath medium was modified to optimize for NMDA receptor activation. The subset of cells that responded to glutamate was either NMDA-unresponsive (54%) or NMDA-responsive (46%), suggesting that there are presumably two populations of glutamate-sensitive taste cells-one with NMDA receptors and the other without NMDA receptors. The function of GluRs in taste buds is not yet known, but the data suggest that glutamate is a neurotransmitter there. GluRs in taste cells might be presynaptic autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors at afferent or efferent synapses.", 
    "41": "This study identifies by microautoradiography activated microglia/macrophages as the main cell type expressing the peripheral benzodiazepine binding site (PBBS) at sites of active CNS pathology. Quantitative measurements of PBBS expression in vivo obtained by PET and [(11)C](R)-PK11195 are shown to correspond to animal experimental and human post-mortem data on the distribution pattern of activated microglia in inflammatory brain disease. Film autoradiography with [(3)H](R)-PK11195, a specific ligand for the PBBS, showed minimal binding in normal control CNS, whereas maximal binding to mononuclear cells was found in multiple sclerosis plaques. However, there was also significantly increased [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding on activated microglia outside the histopathologically defined borders of multiple sclerosis plaques and in areas, such as the cerebral central grey matter, that are not normally reported as sites of pathology in multiple sclerosis. A similar pattern of [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding in areas containing activated microglia was seen in the CNS of animals with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). In areas without identifiable focal pathology, immunocytochemical staining combined with high-resolution emulsion autoradiography demonstrated that the cellular source of [(3)H](R)-PK11195 binding is activated microglia, which frequently retains a ramified morphology. Furthermore, in vitro radioligand binding studies confirmed that microglial activation leads to a rise in the number of PBBS and not a change in binding affinity. Quantitative [(11)C](R)-PK11195 PET in multiple sclerosis patients demonstrated increased PBBS expression in areas of focal pathology identified by T(1)- and T(2)-weighted MRI and, importantly, also in normal-appearing anatomical structures, including cerebral central grey matter. The additional binding frequently delineated neuronal projection areas, such as the lateral geniculate bodies in patients with a history of optic neuritis. In summary, [(11)C](R)-PK11195 PET provides a cellular marker of disease activity in vivo in the human brain.", 
    "42": "We used the benzodiazepine GABA(A) marker [(11)C] flumazenil to study cerebral dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with PET. Seventeen non-demented patients with clinically definite or probable ALS were scanned and statistical parametric maps were derived to localize changes in regional flumazenil volumes of distribution (FMZVD), which correlate closely with receptor density (B(max)), and the results were compared with those of 17 controls. The ALS group showed statistically significant decreases in relative FMZVD in the prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10 bilaterally), parietal cortex (area 7 bilaterally), visual association cortex (area 18 bilaterally) and left motor/premotor cortex (including area 4) (P < 0.001). Relative reductions in FMZVD were also seen in the left ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (areas 45, 46 and 47), Broca's area and the right temporal (area 21) and right visual association cortex (area 19). These observations suggest that cerebral dysfunction in ALS involves motor/premotor and extramotor areas, particularly the prefrontal regions.", 
    "43": "We examined memory during sedation with target-controlled infusions of propofol and midazolam in a double-blinded five-way, cross-over study in 10 volunteers. Each active drug infusion was targeted to sedation level 1 (asleep) and level 4 (lethargic) as determined with the Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale. At the target level of sedation, drug concentration was clamped for 30 min, during which time neutral words were presented. After 2 h, explicit memory was assessed by recall, and implicit memory by using a wordstem completion test. Venous drug concentrations (mean +/- SD) were 1350 ng/mL (+/-332 ng/mL) for propofol and 208 ng/mL (+/-112 ng/mL) for midazolam during Observer Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale level 4; and 1620 ng/mL (+/-357 ng/mL) and 249 ng/mL (+/-82 ng/mL) respectively during level 1. The wordstem completion test frequencies at low level sedation were significantly higher than spontaneous frequencies (8.7% + 2.4%; P: < 0.05 in all cases), and lower than during placebo (33.6% + 23%) (P: < 0.05 in all cases, except P: = 0.076 for propofol at level 4). Clinically distinct levels of sedation were accompanied by small differences in venous propofol or midazolam concentrations. This indicates steep concentration-effect relationships. Neutral information is still memorized during low-level sedation with both drugs. The memory effect of propofol and midazolam did not differ significantly.", 
    "44": "Implicit memory can occur during different states of consciousness and might lead to psychological damage. In 10 volunteers, implicit memory was investigated during sedation with propofol and midazolam in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study. To compare the effects of both drugs, they were titrated using a computer-controlled infusion system to produce similar high and low levels of sedation.", 
    "45": "A series of novel pyrrolo[2,1-c][l,4]benzodiazepine (PBD)-polyamide conjugates (1 and 2) and 2,2'-PBD dimers (3, 4 and 5) were synthesized and evaluated for cytotoxicity in >60 human tumor cell lines. In general PBD-polyamide conjugates (1 and 2) exhibit higher cytotoxic potency compared with 2,2'-PBD dimers (3, 4 and 5). Compound 2 exhibits a wide spectrum of anticancer activities against 17 cell lines in six cancer panels with LC50 values of <9 microM, and is especially effective against colon cancer, melanoma, renal cancer and breast cancer. Compound 1 selectively affects cell growth against renal cancer A 498 cell line and compound 4 affects cell growth against breast cancer MDA-MB-231/ATCC cell line with an LC50 value 0.06 microM. Increases in the chain length of the linker in 2,2'-PBD dimers significantly increase the cytotoxic potency and increases in the number of pyrrole groups in the PBD-polyamide conjugates similarly increase the cytotoxic potency.", 
    "46": "Driving at night time increases accident risk due to visual conditions, fatigue and impaired performance. In addition, the use of alcohol and benzodiazepines may enhance the risks related to night-time driving. We studied these aspects of traffic safety in a simulated driving test with young and older drivers.", 
    "47": "In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study, nine young subjects, aged 22-24 years, performed simulated driving in both 'light' and 'dark' conditions, before and 1.5 h and 4 h after 0.8 g x kg(-1) ethanol (EOH) or 15 mg diazepam (DZ). Further, nine older subjects, aged 55-77 years, were similarly tested, but their EOH dose was 0.7 g x kg(-1) and the DZ dose was 10 mg. The tests were vigilance assessment on visual analogue scales (VAS), simulated driving under light and dark conditions for 6 min each and digit symbol substitution (DSS).", 
    "48": "In the young subjects, both EOH and DZ similarly impaired DSS, with DZ causing more subjective drowsiness, clumsiness, mental slowness and poor overall performance than EOH. During simulated driving, both EOH and DZ impaired simple and complex tracking (EOH > DZ) and prolonged reaction times (EOH = DZ). Impairment of performance was practically identical under light and dark conditions. In the older subjects, objective performance on DSS was poorer (-30%) than that of the young ones, and subjective impairment was marginal. During simulated driving, the baseline levels of variables in older subjects showed definite impairment (errors +100% to +500%) when compared with young subjects. Active drugs impaired several variables (EOH > DZ), but the statistical significances were fewer than in young subjects. Increase in reaction errors reached statistical significance, especially while driving in the dark. Otherwise the driving results in light and dark were not notably different.", 
    "49": "Young subjects drew good baselines but were sensitive to EOH and DZ, whilst the older subjects showed poor baselines but were less sensitive to EOH and DZ. Although the baseline driving and responses to treatments were different in young and older subjects, their driving and psychomotor impairment were unaffected by light conditions.",

Magnitude of response, dose dependency, time course, effects of sex and age, and response to switching from haloperidol to olanzapine are assessed.", 
    "52": "The effects of olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol on PRL were assessed in patients with schizophrenia or related psychoses participating in 3 double-blind clinical trials: (1) a 6-week acute trial comparing olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 1,336) and haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 660), with a 1-year, open-label olanzapine extension for responders; (2) a 54-week study comparing olanzapine 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 21), risperidone 4 to 10 mg/d (n = 21), and haloperidol 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 23) in early illness; and (3) a 28-week study comparing olanzapine 10 to 20 mg/d (n = 172) and risperidone 4 to 12 mg/d (n = 167).", 
    "53": "PRL elevations were significantly greater with risperidone than with either olanzapine or haloperidol in study 2. and significantly greater than with olanzapine in study 3 (all, P < 0.001). PRL elevations were significantly greater with haloperidol than with olanzapine in study 1 (P < 0.001 ). A dose-response relationship was not consistently confirmed with any of the drug treatments. Risperidone-associated PRL elevations peaked relatively early in treatment. In haloperidol- and risperidone-treated patients, the mean change in PRL was greater in women than in men. PRL decreased significantly when treatment was switched from haloperidol to olanzapine.", 
    "54": "This side-by-side analysis of 3 independent studies suggests that with the 3 antipsychotic drugs studied, PRL is elevated moderately by olanzapine (mean change, 1-4 ng/mL), intermediately by haloperidol (mean change, approximately 17 ng/mL), and strongly by risperidone (mean change, 45-80 ng/mL). No consistent dose-response relationship was observed, and the time course and sex-dependency of the response differed between the 3 agents. Patients with haloperidol-induced hyperprolactinemia may benefit from a switch to olanzapine. Long-term studies examining the health consequences of chronic hyperprolactinemia during antipsychotic treatment are needed.",

The primary efficacy measure was change in the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) from baseline to end point. Secondary efficacy measures were the total score on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS); the PANSS positive, negative, general psychopathology, and mood subscores; and the Clinical Global Impression improvement score. Also recorded were spontaneously reported adverse events; extrapyramidal symptoms (assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, and Barnes Akathisia Scale); vital signs; and clinical laboratory test results.", 
    "57": "Forty-eight patients were treated with olanzapine; of these, 45 were assessable over the full 18-week study period. Total scores on the PANSS and BPRS were reduced from baseline by an average of 17.7 (14.2%) and 9.8 points (20.2%), respectively. Eighteen patients (40.0%) experienced a treatment response, defined as a reduction in PANSS total score of > or = 20%. A total of 25 patients (55.6%) achieved a similar reduction in BPRS total score. Significant reductions were seen in both the positive and negative symptom scores on the PANSS (P < 0.001). Olanzapine was well tolerated, with minimal treatment-emergent adverse events or clinically relevant changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory test results. No clinically significant blood dyscrasias were observed in olanzapine-treated patients, including those who had discontinued clozapine because of treatment-associated leukopenia or neutropenia.",

    "59": "Expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes including cytochrome P450 (CYP) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) in various tissues of Suncus murinus (Suncus) were examined. Northern blot analysis showed that mRNAs hybridizable with cDNAs for rat CYP1A2, human CYP2A6, rat CYP2B1, human CYP2C8, human CYP2D6, rat CYP2E1, human CYP3A4 and rat CYP4A1 were expressed in various tissues from Suncus. The mRNA level of CYP2A in the Suncus lung was very high. Furthermore, it was found that the level of CYP2A mRNA in the Suncus lung was higher compared to the Suncus liver. The expression level of mRNA hybridizable with cDNA for human CYP3A4 was very low. The presence of CYP3A gene in Suncus was proven by the induction of the CYP with dexamethasone. Very low expression levels of mRNAs hybridizable with cDNAs for rat FMO1, rat FMO2, rat FMO3 and rat FMO5 were also seen in Suncus liver. No apparent hybridization band appeared when human FMO4 cDNA was used as a probe. The hepatic expression of mRNAs hybridizable with cDNAs for UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1*6, aryl sulfotransferase, glutathione S-transferase 1, carboxyesterase and microsomal epoxide hydrolase in the Suncus were observed. These results indicate that the Suncus is a unique animal species in that mRNAs for CYP3A and FMO are expressed at very low levels.", 
    "60": "Norepinephrine transporters (NETs) terminate the neuronal transmission of norepinephrine, which is released from noradrenergic neurons. To investigate the interaction with NET, the authors examined the effects of short- and long-term treatment with anesthetics on the activity and mRNA level of NET.", 
    "61": "To assay [3H]norepinephrine uptake, bovine adrenal medullary cells in culture were incubated with [3H]norepinephrine in the presence of intravenous anesthetics, including propofol, thiamylal, and diazepam. To study the direct interaction between the anesthetics and NET, the effect of propofol on the binding of [3H]desipramine to the plasma membrane was examined. To study the long-term effect of anesthetics, [3H]norepinephrine uptake by cells pretreated with propofol for 6-24 h and [3H]desipramine binding after pretreatment for 12 h were measured. Simultaneously, we examined the effect of anesthetics on the expression of NET mRNA using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.", 
    "62": "All of the intravenous anesthetics inhibited [3H]norepinephrine uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The active concentrations of propofol (1-3 microm) and thiamylal (< or = 30 microm) were similar to those encountered clinically. The kinetic analysis revealed that all the anesthetics noncompetitively inhibited [3H]norepinephrine uptake. Propofol inhibited [3H]desipramine binding with a potency similar to that observed in [3H]norepinephrine uptake. Scatchard analysis showed that propofol competitively inhibited [3H]desipramine binding. On the other hand, long-term treatment of cells with propofol (10 microm) enhanced the NET functional activity and [3H]desipramine binding, and also increased the level of NET mRNA.", 
    "63": "These results suggest that intravenous anesthetics have a dual effect on NET; short-term treatment causes inhibition, whereas long-term treatment leads to up-regulation. The interaction of intravenous anesthetics with NET may modulate the neuronal transmission of norepinephrine during anesthesia.", 
    "64": "Results of previous studies of rectal ketamine as a pediatric premedication are clouded because of lack of dose-response relation, inappropriate time of assessing sedative effects, and previous administration or coadministration of benzodiazepines. Therefore, the authors reevaluated the efficacy of rectally administered ketamine in comparison with 1 mg/kg rectal midazolam.", 
    "65": "Sixty-six infants and children (age, 7-61 months) who were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I and who were undergoing minor surgeries as in-patients were randomized to receive 5 mg/kg ketamine (n = 16), 7 mg/kg ketamine (n = 16), 10 mg/kg ketamine (n = 17), or 1 mg/kg midazolam (n = 17) via rectum. A blinded observer scored sedation 45 min and 15 min after administration of ketamine and midazolam, respectively, when children were separated from parent(s) for inhalational induction. All children underwent standardized general anesthesia with sevoflurane, nitrous oxide, and oxygen with endotracheal intubation. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxyhemoglobin saturation were determined before, during, and after anesthesia. Postoperative recovery characteristics and incidence of adverse reactions were also assessed.", 
    "66": "Most children (88%) who received rectally 10 mg/kg ketamine or 1 mg/kg midazolam separated easily from their parents compared with those (31%) who received 7 or 5 mg/kg rectal ketamine (P < 0.05). Similarly, more children who received 10 mg/kg ketamine or 1 mg/kg midazolam underwent mask induction without struggling or crying compared with those who received 7 or 5 mg/kg ketamine (P < 0.05). There were no clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, and oxyhemoglobin saturation after administration of either drug. Immediately after surgery, more children receiving midazolam or 5 mg/kg ketamine were agitated compared with 7 or 10 mg/kg ketamine. Ketamine, 7 and 10 mg/kg, provided postoperative analgesia, but the largest dose of ketamine was associated with delayed emergence from general anesthesia.", 
    "67": "The results indicate that rectally administered ketamine alone produces dose-dependent sedative effects in children, when evaluated at its predicted peak plasma concentration. Ketamine, 10 mg/kg, has a delayed onset but is as effective as 1 mg/kg midazolam for sedating healthy children before general anesthesia. However, 10 mg/kg rectal ketamine is not recommended for brief surgeries because of prolonged postoperative sedation.", 
    "68": "Diazepam, a drug of high intrinsic clearance, was studied in the in situ rat liver dually perfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing human serum albumin (HSA; 0-1%) and unlabeled diazepam (1 mg/l) under constant hepatic arterial (3 ml/min) and portal venous (PV; 12 ml/min) flow rates. Events after a unit impulse (using [(14)C]diazepam) and at steady state (using unlabeled diazepam) were evaluated. In the absence of HSA the fractional effluent recovery (F) after hepatic arterial infusion (0.046 +/- 0.013) was about twice that after PV infusion (0.019 +/- 0.006). With HSA present, regardless of input route, F increased as unbound diazepam fraction in perfusate decreased (e.g., for PV, F = 0.58 +/- 0.05 and 0.69 +/- 0.02 for unbound diazepam fraction values of 0.18 +/- 0.01 and 0.037 +/- 0.01 at 0.25% and 1% HSA). The effluent [(14)C]diazepam profile was also dependent upon HSA. On decreasing HSA from 1 to 0.25% the early sharp peak (at 12-20 s) was replaced by a flatter unimodal profile with a later peak (at 60-80 s). Comparison of estimated effective permeability-surface area product to perfusate flow ratios (4.4 for 1% HSA and 21 for 0.25% HSA) indicated a shift from a perfusion rate-limited uptake with 0.25% HSA to one intermediate between permeability and perfusion at 1% HSA. Recognizing that orally absorbed drug enters the liver only via PV and i.v. drug via both vascular routes, this study emphasizes the difference in hepatic extraction of compounds depending on route of input, and the role that alteration in perfusate binding has on hepatic drug disposition.", 
    "69": "Chronic benzodiazepine treatment can produce tolerance and changes in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors. To study the effect of treatment on a selected population of receptors, assays were performed using [(3)H]RY-80, which is selective for GABA(A) receptors with an alpha 5 subunit. Rats were given a flurazepam treatment known to produce tolerance and down-regulation of benzodiazepine binding, or a diazepam treatment shown to produce tolerance but not receptor down-regulation. Quantitative receptor autoradiography using sagittal brain sections bound with [(3)H]RY-80 showed binding in areas known to express alpha 5 mRNA. Brains from flurazepam-treated rats showed significantly decreased 1 nM [(3)H]RY-80 binding in hippocampal formation (e.g., 32% decrease in CA1) and superior colliculus, but not other areas. Using 5 nM [(3)H]RY-80 showed similar decreases in hippocampus. A corresponding 29% decrease in B(max) but no change in K(d) was found with a filtration binding assay using hippocampal homogenates. Down-regulation of [(3)H]RY-80 binding had returned to control by 2 days after withdrawing flurazepam treatment. The magnitude of down-regulation of [(3)H]RY-80 binding suggested that GABA(A) receptors with an alpha 5 subunit may play a prominent role in the adaptive responses associated with benzodiazepine tolerance. Chronic diazepam treatment also resulted in decreased [(3)H]RY-80 binding. However, the regional selectivity was even more pronounced than in flurazepam-treated rats, and only the hippocampal CA1 region showed decreased binding (27%). This localized down-regulation persisted for several days after the end of diazepam treatment. These data indicate that synapses in the hippocampal CA1 region are particularly involved in the adaptive response to chronic benzodiazepine treatments.", 
    "70": "Pharmacophore/receptor models for 6 recombinant GABA(A)/BzR subtypes (alphax beta3gamma2, x = 1-6) have been established via an SAR ligand mapping approach. This study was based on the affinities of 166 BzR ligands at 6 distinct (alpha1-6beta3gamma2) recombinant GABA(A)/BzR receptor subtypes from at least twelve different structural families. Examination of the included volumes indicated that the shapes of binding pockets for alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 subtypes are very similar to each other. Region L2 for the alpha5 containing subtype appeared to be larger in size than the analogous region of the other receptor subtypes. Region L(Di), in contrast, appeared to be larger in the alpha1 subtype than in the other subtypes. Moreover, region L3 in the alpha6 subtype is either very small or nonexistent in this diazepam insensitive \"DI\" subtype as compared to the other subtypes. Preliminary results for the alpha4-containing receptor subtype (DI) indicate that L3 in the alpha4 subtype suffers a similar fate. Use of the pharmacophore/receptor models for these subtypes have resulted in the design of novel BzR ligands selective for the alpha5beta3gamma2, receptor subtype.", 
    "71": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) mRNA levels were measured in lymphocytes obtained from a cohort of university students and clinically diagnosed anxious patients. The average level of PBR mRNA was decreased in anxious patients compared to a control group. This data confirms previously published results, but it also indicates that PBR mRNA levels cannot be used as a sole diagnostic measure of anxiety because the range of the individual PBR mRNA levels of the anxious group overlapped the range of the PBR mRNA levels of the control group. PBR mRNA levels in students following academic examinations were increased in some individuals and decreased in others. In the same cohort of students individual levels of cortisol and prolactin were predominantly increased and decreased respectively. There was no correlation between the individual changes in the hormone levels or PBR mRNA, which suggests that each of these parameters is affected by different environmental and physiological factors. Lymphocyte PBR mRNA measurement is a useful additional methodology for studying human stress responses however, its use in clinical studies would require the elucidation of PBR's physiological role.", 
    "72": "The medical records of 20 tetanus patients who were treated at a university teaching hospital in Taiwan during the period from October 1991 to July 1999 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 18 adults (six males and 12 females) with unknown previous immunization status and ages ranging from 34 to 87 years old (mean 63 years). Two patients were children, aged 3 and 5 years old, respectively; both of them had incomplete tetanus immunization. Of the 17 patients reporting previous acute injury, 10 had tetanus-prone wounds. Four of six patients who sought medical help for wound management received tetanus toxoid, but none received tetanus immunoglobulins. The most common symptoms were trismus, dysphagia, and muscular rigidity. Specific treatment consisted of active and passive immunization, wound management, parenteral antibiotics, and benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants or neuromuscular blockades for control of spasms and sedation. All adults were admitted to the intensive care unit and an artificial airway was established. Fourteen of them required ventilator support during the illness. Prophylactic tracheostomy was performed within 24 h after arrival in 12 (92%) of 13 patients. Two patients died with an overall mortality rate of 10%. Sequelae were rare in the patients who survived. Because of inclusion of the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) vaccine in the national Children's Vaccine Program and improvement in obstetrical practices and neonatal care in Taiwan, tetanus mainly occurs in people older than 65 years instead of neonates or children. Waning immunity to tetanus in the elderly and poor wound management practices by primary care physicians were contributory factors.", 
    "73": "Studies reporting the quantity of benzodiazepines used are purely descriptive and cannot comment on the quality or appropriateness of prescribing benzodiazepines. An indicator to assess the appropriateness of prescribing benzodiazepines was developed from published literature. The applicability of the indicator was discussed in a multidisciplinary forum. The indicator uses clinical data currently available to the prescriber. The indicator, in the form of an algorithm, was applied to assess the appropriateness of prescribing of benzodiazepines to medical in-patients aged < or =65 years at 17 hospitals in England and Wales. Prescribing data were collected on 1391 patients. Appropriateness of prescribing of 311 benzodiazepines were assessed. Benzodiazepines were prescribed appropriately for 110/311 (35%) prescriptions and inappropriately for 201/311 (65%) prescriptions. Initiation of benzodiazepine for no acceptable indication was the commonest reason for inappropriate prescribing. The instrument identifies the appropriateness of prescribing of benzodiazepines and can be utilised by non-physicians.", 
    "74": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a gut hormone that regulates pancreatic endocrine functions via CCK(A) receptors. CCK(4) (Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH(2)) has an insulinotropic effect, but is 1,000-fold less potent than CCK(8) in rodents. The in vitro potencies with respect to binding, the biological effects and the selectivity of newly synthesized CCK(4) analogs constructed by computer modelling experiments were investigated in vitro in rat pancreas and brain, INS-1 cells, and guinea pig ileum. Exchanging various amino acids, e.g. Met by either Pro or Nle, and modifying Phe by adding various substituents in different positions led to compounds which were more effective as insulin secretagogues than CCK(4) itself and even show insulinotropic effects comparable with those of CCK(8) (e. g. compounds M1 and M2 being substituted at Phe). Some compounds which possess electron withdrawing groups on the C-terminal Phe and possess a Pro instead of a Met were especially effective. The CCK(A) receptor antagonist L-364,718, but not by the CCK(B) receptor antagonist L-365,260, inhibited the insulinotropic effects. The synthetic CCK(4) compounds were not selective for the endocrine pancreas: e.g. M1 and M2 had binding activity with respect to rat brain homogenates but no activity with respect to contraction of the guinea pig ileum. The data indicate that some of the newly synthesized CCK tetrapeptides exhibit a high affinity for the CCK receptor of beta-cells and have an insulinotropic effect much higher than CCK(4).",

    "76": "A community-based substance dependence program for seniors was established, and referrals were accepted from a wide variety of sources (self-referral, families, emergency departments, family physicians, community agencies, etc). The service typically included several home visits by a nurse and/or social worker trained in recognizing and treating substance dependence in the elderly, medical assessment by a geriatrician and generation of a client-directed treatment plan. Treatment plans included individual and family counselling, recommendations regarding medication changes and involvement in a peer support/education group. Medication use, health care utilization, functional status, cognition and depression scales were collected before and six months after intervention.", 
    "77": "Of the 95 elderly patients with substance dependence that were seen over a period of 12 months, 55 agreed to participate in the program. Substance dependence included alcohol dependence in 23 participants, benzodiazepine dependence in 20 participants, narcotic dependence in six participants and mixed dependence in six participants. Involvement in the program was associated with significant reductions in depression scale scores (P=0.02), number of daily prescription medications (P=0.002), benzodiazepine use (P=0.01), narcotic use (P=0.04) and number of acute hospitalizations (P=0.001).

    "79": "The aim of this study was to measure the expression of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) as well as mitochondria content in different phases of the cell cycle of BT-20 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, using two-parameter flow cytometric analyses. The PBR expression as well as mitochondria mass, were found to increase as cells pass through different stages of the cell cycle, whereas the amount of PBR in quiescent cells was very low. Binding capacity for the PBR ligand [3H]-Ro5-4864 was strongly related to the phase of the cell cycle with a positive correlation (r=0.98) with a high percentage of cells in S phase. Incubation of BT-20 cells in serum-deprived medium with nanomolar concentrations of Ro5-4864 caused an increase in S phase cells. This effect was not observed in MCF-7 cells. Using micromolar concentrations of Ro5-4864, both BT-20 and MCF-7 cells were reversibly arrested in the G(0/1) phase.", 
    "80": "There is a growing body of evidence that social phobia may be treated effectively by either pharmacologic or cognitive-behavioral interventions. but few studies have examined the relative benefits of these treatments. In this study, we examined the relative efficacy of pharmacotherapy with clonazepam and cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) for treating social phobia. In addition, we examined potential predictors of differential treatment response. Outpatients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd ed., revised) criteria for social phobia were randomly assigned to treatment. Clinician-rated and patient-rated symptom severity was examined at baseline and after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. All clinician-rated assessments were completed by individuals blind to treatment condition. Patients in both conditions improved significantly, and differences between treatment conditions were absent, except for greater improvement on clonazepam on several measures at the 12-week assessment. Symptom severity was negatively associated with treatment success for both methods of treatment, and additional predictors-sex, comorbidity with other anxiety or mood disorders, fear of anxiety symptoms, and dysfunctional attitudes-failed to predict treatment outcome above and beyond severity measures. In summary, we found that patients randomized to clinical care with clonazepam or CBGT were equally likely to respond to acute treatment, and pretreatment measures of symptom severity provided no guidance for the selection of one treatment over another.", 
    "81": "A 26-year-old female presented psychomotor seizures, deja vu and amnestic syndrome after meningitis at the age of 14 years. Repeated electroencephalograms (EEG) demonstrated occasional spikes localized in the right temporal region in addition to a considerable amount of theta waves mainly in the right fronto-temporal region. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed a marked hypoperfusion corresponding to the region in which the EEG showed abnormal findings, although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated no abnormal findings associated with the clinical features. Treatment with clonazepam in addition to sodium valproate resulted in a remarkable improvement of clinical symptoms (i.e. psychomotor seizures and deja vu), as well as of the EEG and SPECT findings. The present study suggests that SPECT is a useful method not only to determine the localization of regions associated with temporal lobe epilepsy but also to evaluate the effect of treatment in temporal lobe epilepsy.", 
    "82": "High-temperature headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with simultaneous (\"in situ\") derivatisation (acetylation or silylation) is a new sample preparation technique for the screening of illicit drugs in urine and for the confirmation analysis in serum by GC-MS. After extraction of urine with a small portion of an organic solvent mixture (e.g., 2 ml of hexane-ethyl acetate) at pH 9, the organic layer is separated and evaporated to dryness in a small headspace vial. A SPME-fiber (e.g., polyacrylate) doped with acetic anhydride-pyridine (for acetylation) is exposed to the vapour phase for 10 min at 200 degrees C in a blockheater. The SPME fiber is then injected into the GC-MS for thermal desorption and analysis. After addition of perchloric acid and extraction with n-hexane to remove lipids, the serum can be analysed after adjusting to pH 9 as described for urine. Very clean extracts are obtained. The various drugs investigated could be detected and identified in urine by the total ion current technique at the following concentrations: amphetamines (200 microg/l), barbiturates (500 microg/l), benzodiazepines (100 microg/l), benzoylecgonine (150 microg/l), methadone (100 microg/l) and opiates (200 microg/l). In serum all drugs could be detected by the selected ion monitoring technique within their therapeutic range. As compared to liquid-liquid extraction only small amounts of organic solvent are needed and larger amounts of the pertinent analytes could be transferred to the GC column. In contrast to solid-phase extraction (SPE), the SPME-fiber is reusable several times (as there is no contamination by endogenous compounds). The method is time-saving and can be mechanised by the use of a dedicated autosampler.", 
    "83": "Loxapine is a dibenzoxazepine tricyclic compound used to treat schizophrenia in the United States since 1976. Metabolism includes demethylation to its primary metabolite, amoxapine. There are few documented reports of the disposition of loxapine in deaths due to overdose. This report discusses the overdose suicide of a 69-year-old white female found dead in her home by her husband. A prescription for loxapine (50-mg capsules) was found near the body. An autopsy was performed and heart blood, bile, vitreous humor, and gastric contents were submitted for toxicological analysis. The blood specimen was subjected to comprehensive testing that included volatile analysis by headspace gas chromatography (GC); acidic/neutral and basic drug screening by GC; benzodiazepine screening by high-performance liquid chromatography; opiate screening by modified immunoassay; and acetaminophen, salicylate, and ethchlorvynol screening by colorimetry. Loxapine and amoxapine were detected in the basic drug screen. No other drugs were detected in the case specimens. The respective concentrations of loxapine and amoxapine in each specimen were as follows: heart blood, 9.5 and 0.6 mg/L; bile, 28.8 and 4.7 mg/L; gastric, 278 mg/L and negative; and vitreous, 1.5 mg/L and negative. A review of the literature showed that the heart blood concentration of loxapine measured in this case was the highest reported to date. Based on the autopsy findings, patient history, and toxicology results, the cause of death was determined to be acute intoxication of loxapine and the manner, suicide.", 
    "84": "Clonazepam (CLO) is an anticonvulsant benzodiazepine approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the treatment of seizures. It produces pharmacological effects (depression, amnesia) similar to other compounds from the same therapeutic class, and in combination with alcohol, its CNS-depressant action can be significantly potentiated. As with some other benzodiazepines, CLO is a drug possibly used in \"date-rape\" situations. A method using solid-phase extraction followed by a highly sensitive negative chemical ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the simultaneous quantitation of CLO and its major metabolite 7-aminoclonazepam (7-ACLO) in hair was developed and validated. The method has potential application to alleged drug-facilitated rape cases. To determine the feasibility of detecting 7-ACLO and CLO in hair, specimens were collected from 10 psychiatric patients treated with CLO, divided into 2-cm segments, and analyzed. Standard curves for 7-ACLO (1-1000 pg/mg) and CLO (10-400 pg/mg) had correlation coefficients of 0.998. All precision and accuracy values were within acceptable limits. 7-ACLO was present in measurable quantities (1.37-1267 pg/mg) in 9 out of 10 patient samples. CLO concentrations in hair were much lower (10.7-180 pg/mg). In 4 out of 10 cases, CLO was not detected in hair. Two patients who had never been treated with CLO before received a single 2-mg dose of the drug. Approximately three weeks later, hair samples were collected, and measurable quantities of 7-ACLO (4.8 pg/mg) were detected in the first segment (proximal) of one of those samples, and traces of the drug were present in the other sample. We concluded that the 7-ACLO is being deposited in hair in much higher quantities than the parent drug and remains there for extended periods of time. Our study also indicates that it is possible to detect 7-ACLO after a single dose of CLO as in the typical date-rape scenarios.", 
    "85": "On-site drug tests are becoming increasingly more popular because of their easy test protocols and instantaneous results. This study evaluates the performance of four on-site drug testing devices that use competitive binding immunoassays to qualitatively determine the presence of drugs in urine: Triage Panel for Drugs of Abuse plus TCA, QuickScreen Pro-Multi Drug Screening Tests, Syva Rapid Test d.a.u. 5 and d.a.u. 2, and Rapid Drug Screen. All devices simultaneously determine the presence of the following drugs of abuse: amphetamine (AMP), benzoylecgonine (BE), 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THCA), opiates (OPI), and phencyclidine (PCP). Triage and Rapid Drug Screen also simultaneously test for benzodiazepines (BZB) and barbiturates (BRB), whereas QuickScreen and Rapid Test require separate devices for the BZB and BRB analyses. Urine specimens (222) containing drug concentrations around or above cutoff values were screened by ONLINE or EMIT II immunoassays. Of these, 199 yielded positive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry results with at least 17 positive specimens in each drug class. Specimens with the target drugs added at 16.7% above and below the cutoff, 33.3% above and below the cutoff, and 66.7% above the cutoff were also used to evaluate the test devices. Sensitivity and specificity calculations demonstrated that Triage performed most predictably in the donor urine specimens and the drug-added specimens. In addition, it required the least amount of test volume and was the only device in which the appearance of a colored line indicated a positive result. Therefore, of the devices studied, Triage was the most dependable and reproducible on-site drug-screening device.", 
    "86": "We have compared the efficacy of cromakalim and nifedipine to inhibit acetylcholine (ACh) and pilocarpine-induced tonic contractions in control preparations and in tissues where a fraction of the muscarinic receptor population had been removed by alkylation with phenoxybenzamine (PBZ). Both agonists induced contractions by stimulating pharmacologically similar receptors, probably of the M3 muscarinic subtype. The receptor reserve was larger, and the coupling between stimulation and contraction (E-C coupling) more efficient when ACh was the stimulating agonist. For stimulations that produced equal levels of muscle response, cromakalim was more efficacious in inhibiting contractions induced by pilocarpine. The efficacy of cromakalim in relaxing contractions induced by ACh increased when the number of functional receptors decreased. Cromakalim and nifedipine decreased the efficiency of E-C coupling for ACh and pilocarpine. Cromakalim efficacy decreased in a sigmoid manner when stimulating concentrations of ACh (and receptor occupancy) increased, and there was an inverse relationship between receptor occupancy by ACh and cromakalim efficacy. In the presence of TEA, a K+ channel blocker, nifedipine almost completely inhibited contractions induced by the M3 muscarinic agonist bethanechol. These data indicate that in bovine tracheal smooth muscle, electro-mechanical coupling is an inherent part of muscarinic E-C coupling, but its functional expression is dependent upon the efficacy of stimulation. The data also suggest that the M3 receptor is coupled to a cellular pathway linked with the activation of K+ channels that exerts a potent functional antagonism against activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry.",

Somatic and psychopathological changes were assessed using the following rating scales: ASI, HAMD, SCL-90-R, and SOWS. Eighteen of 27 patients (67%) completed the study. Four dropouts (27%) were treated with buprenorphine/carbamazepine (BPN/CBZ) and the other five dropouts (42%) were treated with oxazepam/carbamazepine (OXA/CBZ). Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that SOWS scores were significantly less pronounced with BPN-CBZ than with OXA/CBZ. On the first day of admission, no significant difference in HAMD scores was detected (BPN/CBZ 11.6, BPN/CBZ 1.0). On day 14, HAMD was significantly less pronounced in BPN/CBZ (3.0) than in OXA/CBZ (6.1). BPN/CBZ showed a significant improvement in the ASI score on days 7 and 14 compared with OXA/CBZ. Three of nine items of the SCL-90-R showed a trend toward less pronounced outcome in BPN-CBZ. No severe side effects occurred during treatment in either group. The buprenorphine/carbamazepine regimen provided significantly more effective relief from affect disturbances and withdrawal syndromes than the oxazepam/carbamazepine regimen. The pharmacological basis of these effects of buprenorphine (kappa-antagonism activity,mu-agonism activity) are discussed.",

Nine patients (six boys, three girls; age range 6 months to 9 years) with prolonged convulsions lasting more than 10 min were treated with intranasal midazolam, 0.3 mg/kg. The success rate was 100% with only one case requiring a second dose. Estimated duration of seizures was 12-30 min (mean 18.6) while mean time elapsed until cessation of seizures was 139.6 s (range 60-480). No significant adverse effects were noted except for one patient who had seizures secondary to serious CNS infection and respiratory depression after intranasal midazolam.", 
    "89": "1. The goals of the work reported here were to further characterize benzodiazepine/GABA(A) (BDZR) receptor heterogeneity in the cerebellum and to measure the affinities and selectivities of structurally diverse benzodiazepines at each site identified. 2. Five chemical families were included in these studies. These were 1,4-benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam), imidazobenzodiazepines (RO15-1788 and RO15-4513 and RO16-6028), beta-carbolines (Abecarnil) and pyrazoloquinolines (CGS 8216, CGS 9895 and CGS 9896). 3. Saturation and competition binding assays were combined with powerful data analysis software developed in our laboratory. Among the capabilities of this software is the identification of multiple binding sites for a cold ligand using a non-selective labeled ligand that binds with equal, but high, affinity to all the binding sites 4. Saturation binding assays using either [3H]-RO15-1788 or [3H]-RO15-4513 revealed only one apparent binding site, with a higher affinity for RO15-4513 than for RO15-1788. However, using [3H]-RO15-4513 for the competition binding studies in the cerebellum, together with our data analysis software, led to the identification of two distinct binding sites with equal densities for the diverse benzodiazepines studied. 5. In rat cerebellum one of the sites identified corresponds to GABA(A) receptors exhibiting alpha1 subunit pharmacology and the other to GABA(A) receptors exhibiting alpha6 subunit pharmacology. In general, the diverse families of BDZR ligands studied had much lower affinities for the alpha6 containing receptors.", 
    "90": "1. Zolpidem (ZPD, 10 mg) was directly compared with triazolam (TRZ, 0.25 mg), a benzodiazepine hypnotic of a short action comparable to ZPD. The compounds were given to healthy young subjects for three nights, in a crossover design. 2. Polysomnographic data of three 150-min sections of the nights as well as the whole nights were analyzed, to clearly detect the proper effects of the very short acting hypnotics, which might be missed in the analysis of whole night. 3. Time courses were significantly different between the two compounds in the ratios (%) of stage wake (SW), stage 2 (S2), slow wave sleep (SWS) and stage REM (SR). 4. Compared to the baseline, SWS was increased by ZPD on the first night, not by TRZ. The separate analysis of the three 150-min sections revealed an increase of SWS during the first 150-min of the ZPD night, suggesting a proper action of ZPD to augment SWS. An increase of S2 and a decrease of SR were caused by TRZ, not by ZPD. However, the separate analysis indicated that ZPD might reduce SR during the first 150-min, which was cancelled by a subsequent rebound increase in the whole night analysis. 5. During the withdrawal period, TRZ, not ZPD, increased SW and SR with worsening of mood in the morning. ZPD did not affect sleep latency in the morning, while TRZ caused a trend of the reduction.",

In the SI test, S15535 similarly mimicked the anxiolytic-like effect of diazepam and was active over a broad dose range. Buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT again showed biphasic dose-response curves, as did SB206,553. In both the Vogel and SI tests, the anxiolytic-like effects of S15535 were abolished by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100,635, which was inactive alone. S15535 exerted its anxiolytic-like effects with a more pronounced separation to motor-disruptive doses than the other drugs. Finally, S15535 suppressed dialysate levels of 5-HT in the dorsal hippocampus, an action abolished by WAY100,635. Buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and diazepam, but not SB206,553, also reduced 5-HT levels.",

    "101": "The plus-maze discriminative avoidance paradigm is a new animal model of learning/memory that provides simultaneous information about anxiety. Mice are conditioned to choose between the two enclosed arms (in one of which light and noise are presented as aversive stimuli) while avoiding the two open arms of the apparatus. The test has the advantage of measuring, at the same time and in the same animals, learning/memory (by the percent time spent in aversive enclosed arm - PTAV) and anxiety (by the percent time spent in the open arms - PTO). The effects of chlordiazepoxide and caffeine on learning/memory and anxiety of mice tested in this paradigm were investigated. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) significantly increased and caffeine (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased PTO during the training session, suggesting an anxiolytic and an anxiogenic effect, respectively. In the test session, chlordiazepoxide- or caffeine-treated mice presented higher PTAV, suggesting amnestic effects. Given together, chlordiazepoxide plus caffeine did not alter PTO, and the amnesic effect produced by each drug was no longer observed. It is concluded that learning/memory depends on an optimum emotional level. The plus-maze discriminative avoidance model appears to be a useful test to investigate this critical relationship between learning/memory and anxiety.",

    "106": "Benzodiazepine binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors allosterically modulates GABA binding and increases the currents induced by submaximal GABA concentrations. Benzodiazepines induce conformational changes in the GABA-binding site in the extracellular domain, but it is uncertain whether these conformational changes extend into the membrane-spanning domain where the channel gate is located. Alone, benzodiazepines do not open the channel. We used the substituted-cysteine-accessibility method to investigate diazepam-induced conformational changes in the region of the alpha(1)-subunit M3 membrane-spanning segment. In the absence of diazepam or GABA, pCMBS(-) did not react at a measurable rate with cysteine-substitution mutants between alpha(1)Phe296 and alpha(1)Glu303. In the presence of 100 nM diazepam, pCMBS(-) reacted with alpha(1)F296C, alpha(1)F298C, and alpha(1)L301C but not with the other cysteine mutants between alpha(1)Phe296 and alpha(1)Glu303. These three mutants are a subset of the five residues that we previously showed reacted with pCMBS(-) applied in the presence of GABA. The pCMBS(-) reaction rates with these three cysteine mutants were similar in the presence of diazepam and GABA. Thus, diazepam, which binds to the extracellular domain, induces a conformational change in the membrane-spanning domain that is similar to a portion of the change induced by GABA. Because diazepam does not open the channel, these results provide structural evidence that the diazepam-bound state represents an intermediate conformation distinct from the open and resting/closed states of the receptor. The diazepam-induced conformational change in the M3 segment vicinity may be related to the mechanism of allosteric potentiation.",

    "108": "Expression of the immediate-early gene, NGFI-B (nerve growth factor inducible gene B), was examined in the amygdala, hippocampus, and neocortex following contextual fear conditioning. Rats were either handled, placed within the testing context without receiving the footshock, received a footshock immediately upon placement within the context, or received a footshock after a 3-min delay (delayed-shock). Only the delayed-shock group displayed a fear response (freezing) in the post-shock period and in a retention test 24 h after fear conditioning. Expression of NGFI-B mRNA was increased in the dorsolateral part of the lateral nucleus of the amygdala (LaDL) and the neocortex 30 min following conditioning in the delayed-shock group compared to the other three groups. In addition, following a retention test conducted 24 h after fear conditioning, NGFI-B mRNA expression was increased in the neocortex of the delayed-shock group compared to the handled group. In a subsequent experiment, the effects of pretreatment with the anxiolytic drug, diazepam, on fear conditioning and the concomitant increases in NGFI-B mRNA were investigated. Rats administered a 2.5 mg/kg, i.p. dose of diazepam before fear conditioning did not acquire contextual fear as demonstrated by a lack of freezing in a retention test. Although diazepam blocked fear conditioning while the 40% propylene glycol, 10% ethanol vehicle solution did not, both diazepam and the vehicle reduced the conditioning-induced increase in NGFI-B expression in the LaDL. In contrast, the fear-conditioning-induced NGFI-B increase in the neocortex was blocked by diazepam, but not by the vehicle. The data suggest that the transcriptional factor NGFI-B in the LaDL and neocortex may play a functional role in learning and memory of contextual fear, but blocking the increase in NGFI-B expression in the LaDL is not essential for diazepam to interfere with fear conditioning.",

In higher doses no enhancement of ketamine activity were found. After morphine and ketamine (3.0 mg/kg) or morphine, midazolam and ketamine co-administration. higher antinociceptive effects compared to ketamine activity were found. Rats administered midazolam and ketamine (3.0 mg/kg) showed a decrease of the effect of ketamine analgesia, and the antinociceptive effect of the three-component mixture was lower than after co-injection of morphine and ketamine. The interaction of these two compounds with ketamine (5.0 mg/kg) occurred in a different manner, because midazolam led to a strong enhancement of ketamine analgesia. After morphine and ketamine (5.0 mg/kg) administration, very weak increase of ketamine analgesia was observed. The results of this study allow better understanding of the alteration of the analgesic effects of low doses of ketamine under the influence of morphine and midazolam.", 
    "110": "Patients with generalized anxiety disorder experience worry or anxiety and a number of physical and psychologic symptoms. The disorder is frequently difficult to diagnose because of the variety of presentations and the common occurrence of comorbid medical or psychiatric conditions.

It is often chronic, and patients with this disorder are more likely to be seen by family physicians than by psychiatrists. Treatment consists of pharmacotherapy and various forms of psychotherapy. The benzodiazepines are used for short-term treatment, but because of the frequently chronic nature of generalized anxiety disorder, they may need to be continued for months to years. Buspirone and antidepressants are also used for the pharmacologic management of patients with generalized anxiety disorder. Patients must receive an appropriate pharmacologic trial with dosage titrated to optimal levels as judged by the control of symptoms and the tolerance of side effects.

    "111": "Substance P (SP) stimulates striatal dopamine outflow through a cholinergic muscarinic link. SP-induced increase in acetylcholine (Ach) is concentration-dependent, whereas the stimulation of dopamine outflow is seen only over a limited concentration range. M(1) and M(2) receptor stimulation has opposite effects on dopamine outflow. We postulated that the effect of SP on dopamine outflow depends on the M(1)/M(2) balance. We show that Ach (10-2500 microM) stimulates dopamine outflow in striatal slices in a biphasic manner, similar to SP (0.01-100 nM). An inactive SP concentration (10 nM) which was higher than the active concentration range, became active in the presence of the M(2) antagonist methoctramine (100 microM). Conversely, the effect of 1 nM SP was reversed by the M(1) antagonist pirenzepine (1 microM). Our observations show that SP modulation of dopamine outflow is determined by a balance between M(1) and M(2) receptors.", 
    "112": "Tryptophan substitutions were made in the second transmembrane domain of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor alpha and beta subunits and the resulting mutant receptors, containing alpha(2)(S270W) and/or beta(1)(S265W), were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Mutation of either or both subunits resulted in receptors that exhibited enhanced sensitivity to agonist and were spontaneously active in the absence of GABA. The spontaneous activity was blocked by picrotoxin or bicuculline. The enhancement of GABA-induced currents by pentobarbital, by the neurosteroid 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one, and by the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam was dramatically reduced in the mutant receptors. These results are consistent with the idea that a mutation that promotes gating behavior in a ligand-gated ion channel will also show reduced effects of all positive allosteric modulators in a generalized manner, even when these modulators act at distinct sites on the receptor.", 
    "113": "Recent animal experiments show that the application of an electrical stimulus to the amygdala or hippocampus following the kindling stimulus produced a significant and long-lasting suppressive effect on this experimental model of epilepsy. This is a preliminary report on the development of a surgical neuromodulatory procedure by chronic electrical stimulation of the hippocampus (CHCS) for control of intractable temporal lobe seizures in patients in whom anterior temporal lobectomy is not advisable, i.e., patients with bilateral temporal foci or a unilateral focus spreading to surrounding cerebral regions of the dominant hemisphere. This work was divided in two main consecutive stages. In the first stage, we demonstrated that subacute hippocampal stimulation (SAHCS) blocks intractable temporal lobe epileptogenesis with no additional damage to the stimulated tissue, and in a second stage, we attempt to demonstrate that CHCS may produce a sustained, long-lasting antiepileptic condition without additional undesirable effects on language and memory. In addition, taking advantage of this unique and ethically permissible situation, we attempt to determine whether or not the antiepileptic effects of SAHCS and CHCS are due to inhibition of the stimulation of hippocampal tissue by means of a number of electrophysiological, single photon computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion, and autoradiographic techniques.SAHCS during 3-4 weeks prior to anterior temporal lobectomy applied to a critical area located either at the anterior Pes hippocampus close to the amygdala or at the parahippocampal gyrus close to the entorhinal cortex abolished clinical seizures and significantly decreased the number of interictal spikes at focus after 5-6 days. Microscopy analysis of the stimulated tissue showed no evident histopathological differences between stimulated vs. non-stimulated hippocampal tissues. Additionally, CHCS persistently blocked temporal lobe epileptogenesis for 3-4 months with no apparent additional undesirable effects on short memory. Also, inhibition of the stimulated hippocampus seems to be one of the possible mechanisms underlying the beneficial antiepileptic effects of SAHCS and CHCS. This was revealed by increased threshold and decreased duration of the afterdischarges induced by hippocampal stimulation, flattening of the hippocampal-evoked response recovery cycles, SPECT hypoperfusion of the hippocampal region, and increased hippocampal benzodiazepine receptor binding. Future studies increasing the number and time of follow-up of patients under hippocampal stimulation are necessary before considering CHCS a reliable procedure for controlling intractable temporal lobe seizures.",

    "127": "A variety of stressful events, including emotional stress, cause a marked increase in noradrenaline release in several brain regions, and especially in the hypothalamus, amygdala and locus coeruleus, in the rat brain. These findings suggest that an increased noradrenaline release could be closely related to the provocation of negative emotions such as anxiety and/or fear. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we carried out several studies. Diazepam, a typical benzodiazepine anxiolytic, significantly attenuated not only the immobilization stress-induced increase in noradrenaline release in the three rat brain regions but also the emotional changes of these animals, and these effects were antagonized by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. Naloxone and opioid agents, such as morphine, beta-endorphin and [Met(5)]-enkephalin, significantly enhanced and attenuated the stress-induced increase in noradrenaline release in these regions and the stress-induced emotional change, respectively. Two stressful events which predominantly involve emotional factors, i.e., psychological stress and conditioned fear, caused significant increases in noradrenaline release selectively in these three brain regions and these increases were also significantly attenuated by pretreatment with diazepam in a flumazenil reversible manner. Yohimbine, an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist which caused a marked increase in noradrenaline release in the several brain regions, had an anxiolytic action in the two behavioral tests involving anxiety, i.e., the conditioned defensive burying test and the modified forced swim test. beta-Carbolines, which possess anxiogenic properties, significantly increased noradrenaline release in the hypothalamus, amygdala and locus coeruleus. Taken together, these findings suggest that the increased release of noradrenaline in the hypothalamus, amygdala and locus coeruleus is, in part, involved in the provocation of anxiety and/or fear in animals exposed to stress, and that the attenuation of this increase by benzodiazepine anxiolytics acting via the benzodiazepine receptor/GABAA receptor/chloride ionophore supramolecular complex may be the basic mechanism of action of these anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "128": "In the present study, we have investigated the effects of prolonged inhibition of NMDA receptor by infusion of subtoxic dose of MK-801 to examine the modulation of GABA(A) receptor binding and GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA level in rat brain. It has been reported that NMDA-selective glutamate receptor stimulation alters GABA(A) receptor pharmacology in cerebellar granule neurons in vitro by altering the levels of selective subunit. However, we have investigated the effect of NMDA antagonist, MK-801, on GABA(A) receptor binding characteristics in discrete brain regions by using autoradiographic and in situ hybridization techniques. The GABA(A) receptor bindings were analyzed by quantitative autoradiography using [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam, and [35S]TBPS in rat brain slices. Rats were infused with MK-801 (1 pmol/10 microl per h, i.c.v.) for 7 days, through pre-implanted cannula by osmotic minipumps (Alzet, model 2 ML). The levels of [3H]muscimol binding were highly elevated in almost all of brain regions including cortex, caudate putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum. However, the [3H]flunitrazepam binding and [35S]TBPS binding were increased only in specific regions; the former level was increased in parts of the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus, while the latter binding sites were only slightly elevated in parts of thalamus. The levels of beta2-subunit were elevated in the frontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, and cerebellar granule layers while the levels of beta3-subunit were significantly decreased in the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellar granule layers in MK-801-infused rats. The levels of alpha6- and delta-subunits, which are highly localized in the cerebellum, were increased in the cerebellar granule layer after MK-801 treatment. These results show that the prolonged suppression of NMDA receptor function by MK-801-infusion strongly elevates [3H]muscimol binding throughout the brain, increases regional [3H]flunitrazepam and [35S]TBPS binding, and alters GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA levels in different directions. The chronic MK-801 treatment has differential effect on various GABA(A) receptor subunits, which suggests involvement of differential regulatory mechanisms in interaction of NMDA receptor with the GABA receptors.", 
    "129": "Although physiological functions of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor are well explored, little is known about its role during healing. Here, we evaluated the role of this receptor in the rat oxyntic mucosa following the introduction of a cryoulcer. In this model, we located and quantified CCK-B/gastrin receptors by reverse transcriptase PCR and receptor autoradiography. Rats with cryoulcers were treated with placebo, omeprazole, the CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist YF-476, omeprazole plus YF-476, gastrin-17, and gastrin 17 plus YF-476. During wound healing, CCK-B/gastrin receptors were specifically expressed and localized to the regenerative mucosal ulcer margin. This high expression was limited in time, and the pattern of expression of CCK-B/gastrin receptors correlated closely with the proliferative activity of the regenerative mucosa. Functionally, omeprazole and gastrin-17 caused profound hypergastrinemia, increased cell proliferation in the mucosal ulcer margin and accelerated the late ulcer healing phase. These effects were completely reversed by cotherapy with YF-476. These in vivo and vitro data suggest that CCK-B/gastrin receptors in regenerative rat gastric oxyntic mucosa enhance trophic effects during wound healing.", 
    "130": "(+)-ROD188 was synthesized in the search for novel ligands of the GABA binding site. It shares some structural similarity with bicuculline. (+)-ROD188 failed to displace [(3)H]-muscimol in binding studies and failed to induce channel opening in recombinant rat alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptors functionally expressed in Xenopus oocytes. (+)-ROD188 allosterically stimulated GABA induced currents. Displacement of [(3)H]-Ro15-1788 indicated a low affinity action at the benzodiazepine binding site. In functional studies, stimulation by (+)-ROD188 was little sensitive to the presence of 1 microM of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, and (+)-ROD188 also stimulated currents mediated by alpha1beta2, indicating a major mechanism of action different from that of benzodiazepines. Allosteric stimulation by (+)-ROD188 was similar in alpha1beta2N265S as in unmutated alpha1beta2, while that by loreclezole was strongly reduced. (+)-ROD188 also strongly stimulated currents elicited by either pentobarbital or 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (3alpha-OH-DHP), in line with a mode of action different from that of barbiturates or neurosteroids as channel agonists. Stimulation by (+)-ROD188 was largest in alpha6beta2gamma2 (alpha6beta2gamma2>alpha1beta2gamma2=alpha5beta2gamma2++ +>alpha2beta2ga mma2= alpha3beta2gamma2), indicating a unique subunit isoform specificity. Miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSC) in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, caused by spontaneous release of GABA showed a prolonged decay time in the presence of 30 microM (+)-ROD188, indicating an enhanced synaptic inhibitory transmission.", 
    "131": "Spontaneously opening, chloride-selective channels that showed outward rectification were recorded in ripped-off patches from rat cultured hippocampal neurons and in cell-attached patches from rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in slices. In both preparations, channels had multiple conductance states and the most common single-channel conductance varied. In the outside-out patches it ranged from 12 to 70 pS (Vp=40 mV) whereas in the cell-attached patches it ranged from 56 to 85 pS (-Vp=80 mV). Application of GABA to a patch showing spontaneous channel activity evoked a rapid, synchronous activation of channels. During prolonged exposure to either 5 or 100 microM GABA, the open probability of channels decreased. Application of GABA appeared to have no immediate effect on single-channel conductance. Exposure of the patches to 100 microM bicuculline caused a gradual decrease on the single-channel conductance of the spontaneous channels. The time for complete inhibition to take place was slower in the outside-out than in the cell-attached patches. Application of 100 microM pentobarbital or 1 microM diazepam caused 2 - 4 fold increase in the maximum channel conductance of low conductance (<40 pS) spontaneously active channels. The observation of spontaneously opening GABA(A) channels in cell-attached patches on neurons in slices suggests that they may have a role in neurons in vivo and could be an important site of action for some drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and general anaesthetics.",

    "142": "For the treatment of primary fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) the low dose application of tri- and tetracyclic antidepressive drugs was often studied. Up to now from all those drugs the effects of amitriptyline (AMI) are best documented. Because of its sedative properties it doesn't only influence pain but also improves the often disturbed sleep. Its use in patients with FMS is limited by the occurrence of side effects and the lack of response in a substantial number of patients. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors alone seem to be of little value. Nevertheless there is evidence that they may improve pain in combination with other antidepressive agents. Regarding pain moclobemide a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase seems to be inferior to AMI. In controlled studies corticosteroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) also failed to improve FMS. The combination of NSAIDs with benzodiazepines gave inconsistent results. Although often used, we have only small information about the effectiveness of opioids. No beneficial effect could be attributed to the muscle relaxant chlormezanone. In conclusion, although only about 1/3 of the patients respond, AMI remains the drug of first choice in the conventional medication treatment of FMS.",

    "144": "The relationship between characteristics of benzodiazepine exposure and health-status was examined in order to investigate risk profiles of benzodiazepine users. In the only pharmacy of a Dutch community of 13,500 inhabitants, all current benzodiazepine users that presented with a benzodiazepine prescription in November 1994 were invited to participate. On the basis of the RAND-36 questionnaire, summary scores for both physical and mental health were calculated, the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental Component Summary (MCS). After dichotomization with a cut-off point indicating seriously impaired health and after the combination of the PCS and MCS, four different categories of health status could be identified. We used logistic regression to study the relation between these four different groups with respect to benzodiazepine exposure. In total a group of 360 current benzodiazepine users was studied. Results showed that almost one-third of the participants had no significant impaired health; this group was further classified as reference group. We classified three other groups: one with physical problems (31%), one with mental problems (18%), and one with a combination of the two (22%). Multivariate analysis showed differences in risk factors for an impaired health status. The group with impaired physical health was associated with self-reported indication for muscle relaxation, hypnotic use, and a high CDS (Chronic Disease Score). The group with impaired mental health was associated with more frequent consulting of a mental health care specialist and with a low sense of self-efficacy. The group with both impaired physical as well as mental health was associated with a higher incidence of widowhood, a lower sense of self-efficacy, a high CDS, using benzodiazepines more than prescribed, and reporting depression as reason for their benzodiazepine use. In particular, two groups need critical examination: a group of apparently healthy users with long-term benzodiazepine use; and a frail group with impaired physical and mental health and using a higher dose than prescribed. Patient counseling and management of these four groups can be tailored to the specific needs of each group.", 
    "145": "Though being a sedative, diazepam increases beta-activity in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Diazepam also affects auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). We investigated if the effect of diazepam on AEPs could be ascribed to its beta-increasing effect. Eight rats received vehicle and diazepam counterbalanced. AEPs were ranked in ten categories according to the percentages of beta-activity in the pre-stimulus electroencephalogram (EEG). With vehicle, the P(29), N(51) and P(67) AEP components increased and cross-correlation coefficients (CCCs) declined with increasing beta-activity. With diazepam AEP components and CCCs remained unchanged. All AEPs with diazepam closely resembled the AEP of the lowest beta-category obtained with vehicle. We conclude that the effect of diazepam on AEPs can not be ascribed to its beta-enhancing effect. Diazepam disrupts the normal AEP-EEG relation such that diazepam-effects on AEPs seem to reflect the sedative effects of diazepam and not its beta-increasing effects.", 
    "146": "Urea-induced structural transitions in different domains of bovine serum albumin (BSA) were studied fluorometrically using domain specific ligands; chloroform, bilirubin, and diazepam. Urea denaturation of BSA showed a two-step, three-state transition with the accumulation of an intermediate around 4.8-5.2 M urea. During first transition (0-5.0 M urea), a continuous decrease (starting from 1.0 M urea) in diazepam (a ligand for domain III) binding and a late (from 3.0 M urea onward) decrease in chloroform (a ligand primarily for domain I) binding suggested major conformational changes in domain III and partial but significant loss of native conformation in domain I prior to intermediate formation. Absence of any decrease in bilirubin (a ligand for domain II) binding up to 4.5 M urea indicated non-involvement of domain II in the unfolding of BSA in this region. However, decrease in bilirubin binding during second transition reflected the unfolding of domain II and its separation from domain I.",

Therapy comprised drug treatment with low dose antipsychotics and benzodiazepines coupled with hypnosis and marital therapy to explore and treat the underlying pathology. Both psychotic states resolved. Follow-up at 12 months revealed stable mental condition in one subject; however, the second patient was lost to follow up.

The number of intertrial crosses was not affected and no catalepsy was observed. These experimental results indicate, in principle, an antipsychotic effect of AMPA receptor antagonists with a low liability for extrapyramidal side effects and, consequently, a pharmacological profile consonant with atypical antipsychotic drugs.",

In fasted rats, bilateral microinfusion of CCK(8) at doses of 1.5 and 3.0 microg/rat into the PVN stimulated colonic transit, as shown by a significant increase in the geometric center by 47 and 54%, respectively. This effect of CCK(8) was site-specific to the PVN, since microinjection of the peptide into sites outside of but adjacent to PVN had no effect. In non-fasted rats, L-365,260 bilaterally microinjected into the PVN at a dose of 1.5 microg/rat inhibited propulsive colonic motor function; colonic transit time significantly increased by 73% in comparison to the control condition. Microinfusion of the CCK-A antagonist into in the PVN did not affect colonic transit. These results show that the PVN is a responsive site for the central CCK(8)-induced modulation of colonic motility. The data suggest, that endogenous CCK in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus unfolds a stimulatory effect on colonic transit through action on CCK-B receptors.", 
    "155": "Since a previous study indicated that the water extract of Scutellariae radix (SR) had high affinity for the benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding site of GABA(A) receptors, the present study examined whether SR water extract has an anticonvulsant effect in vivo and an enhancing effect on gamma-amino-n-butyric acid (GABA)-stimulated uptake of 36Cl(-) in cortex preparation in vitro in mice. The results showed that SR water extract had little effect on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 85 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced clonic seizures but significantly inhibited maximal electroshock-induced tonic seizures with an ED(50) of 3.6 g/kg. The BDZ agonist chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, i.p.) had anticonvulsant activity on both types of seizures. In 36Cl(-) uptake assay, SR water extract (1-500 microg/ml) had no significant effect on 25 microM GABA-stimulated 36Cl(-) uptake, whereas chlordiazepoxide (10 microM) increased the 36Cl(-) uptake to 125% of control. Therefore, the present results showed for the first time that SR water extract had anticonvulsant activity against maximal electroshock-induced tonic seizures, and suggested that this anticonvulsant effect might be not via the activation of the BDZ binding site of GABA(A) receptors, but probably via the prevention of seizure spread.", 
    "156": "When the vertebrate retina is stimulated by light, a class of amacrine or interplexiform cells release dopamine, a modulator responsible for neural adaptation to light. In the intact retina, dopamine release can be pharmacologically manipulated with agonists and antagonists at GABA(A) receptors, and dopaminergic (DA) cells receive input from GABAergic amacrines. Because there are only 450 DA cells in each mouse retina and they cannot be distinguished in the living state from other cells on the basis of their morphology, we used transgenic technology to label DA cells with human placental alkaline phosphatase, an enzyme that resides on the outer surface of the cell membrane. We could therefore identify DA cells in vitro after dissociation of the retina and investigate their activity with whole cell voltage clamp. We describe here the pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptors of solitary DA cells. GABA application induces a large inward current carried by chloride ions. The receptors are of the GABA(A) type because the GABA-evoked current is blocked by bicuculline. Their affinity for GABA is very high with an EC(50) value of 7.4 microM. Co-application of benzodiazepine receptor ligands causes a strong increase in the peak current induced by GABA (maximal enhancement: CL-218872 220%; flunitrazepam 214%; zolpidem 348%) proving that DA cells express a type I benzodiazepine-receptor (BZ1). GABA-evoked currents are inhibited by Zn(2+) with an IC(50) of 58.9 +/- 8.9 microM. Furthermore, these receptors are strongly potentiated by the modulator alphaxalone with an EC(50) of 340 +/- 4 nM. The allosteric modulator loreclezole increases GABA receptor currents by 43% (1 microM) and by 107% (10 microM). Using outside-out patches, we measured in single-channel recordings a main conductance (29 pS) and two subconductance (20 and 9 pS) states. We have previously shown by single-cell RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry that DA cells express seven different GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha1, alpha3, alpha4, beta1, beta3, gamma1, gamma2(S), and gamma2(L)) and by immunocytochemistry that all subunits are expressed in the intact retina. We show here that at least alpha1, beta3 and gamma2 subunits are assembled into functional receptors."
