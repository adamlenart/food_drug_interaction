    "0": "Alcohol withdrawal therapy can be simplified with a loading dose of diazepam, taking advantage of the kinetic tapering afforded by the drug's long t 1/2s and its metabolites, and of the effectiveness of nonpharmacologic maneuvers. In a double-blind trial, 50 inpatients in moderate to severe alcohol withdrawal received 20 mg oral diazepam and supportive care (n = 25) or placebo and supportive care (n = 25) every 2 hr until they were asymptomatic. Fifty-six percent of patients responded to placebo within 5 +/- 2.9 hr (mean +/- SD), whereas 72% responded to initial diazepam within 6.3 +/- 3.9 hr. Patients treated with diazepam had more rapid and greater improvement than those treated with placebo. Patients who did not respond to six doses of diazepam received further (unblinded) diazepam, 20 mg, every 1 to 2 hr. All patients who did not initially respond (n = 18) improved after more diazepam. Thus all patients who received diazepam (n = 36), during the experimental phase or subsequently, were effectively treated. There were no adverse effects. The median number of 20-mg diazepam doses to treat alcohol withdrawal were three, given over a period of 7.6 hr (range = 1 to 12 and 0.33 to 45 hr). Complications occurred only in those who received placebo during the experimental phase, indicating that delay in therapy may be responsible for the appearance of complications in alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "1": "The cardiovascular and respiratory effects of three common intravenous premedicants were examined noninvasively in a population of 20 dental outpatients scheduled for surgical removal of third-molars. Two third molars from one side of the mouth were removed at each appointment. Group 1 received a diazepam titration (mean dose = 25.6 mgs) at one appointment and placebo at the other appointment. Group 2 received a combination of diazepam (12.5 mg), fentanyl (0.1 mg), and methohexital (mean dose = 18.0 mg) at one appointment and the combination of diazepam (15.0 mg) and methohexital (mean dose = 27.0 mg) at the other appointment. Noninvasive measurement of cardiac output revealed little change during intravenous drug administration, but a significant increase was seen in all groups following local anesthesia and during surgery. Heart rate was elevated and stroke volume decreased during administration of the two-drug combinations. Oxygen saturation was greatly decreased following the combination of diazepam, fentanyl, and methohexital. These findings indicate that the combination of diazepam, fentanyl, and methohexital results in decreased oxygen saturation, a transient decrease in stroke volume, and an elevated heart rate when used as an intravenous premedicant for dental outpatients.", 
    "2": "Midazolam, which induces anaesthesia in humans at intravenous doses of 0.3 mg/kg, did not anaesthetize cats at doses of 20 mg/kg. Nevertheless, intravenous doses as small as 0.3 mg/kg enhanced spinal primary afferent depolarization and presynaptic inhibition of spinal monosynaptic reflexes, and both intravenous and microelectrophoretic administration of midazolam enhanced the inhibitory effect of GABA on spinal neurones and the depolarization of Ia afferent terminations by GABA and piperidine-4-sulphonate. Some degree of specificity was demonstrated for the inhibitory effect of GABA in relation to those of glycine and noradrenaline, and the enhancement by midazolam of inhibition by GABA was blocked by R015-1788, which alone was inactive. Although these results are consistent with proposals that depressant benzodiazepines enhance the effectiveness of GABA as a central transmitter, such an effect alone may not fully account for the anaesthesia produced by midazolam in humans.", 
    "3": "The effects of flunitrazepam 15 micrograms kg-1, on left ventricular (LV) performance, coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF), myocardial oxygen uptake and myocardial lactate balance were studied in nine patients with coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization. Flunitrazepam produced a decrease in mean aortic pressure (MAP) and in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) with maximal changes from control value observed at 15 min for MAP and at 5 min for SVR. No change in cardiac index was observed. The following changes in variables related to LV performance were observed: (1) a transient increase in heart rate and left ventricular contractility (Vmax); (2) a sustained decrease of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, maximum at 15 min. Myocardial oxygen consumption was decreased at 15 min but CSBF did not change, whereas total coronary vascular resistance was decreased. Since myocardial lactate extraction was increased and no change in ECG was observed, a coronary steal induced by coronary vasodilatation did not appear to take place.", 
    "4": "Increased episodes and duration of apnea during sleep associated with arterial oxygen desaturation have been reported after administration of flurazepam. We postulated that an alteration in respiratory control during sleep might be the underlying mechanism of this observation. Accordingly, we measured isocapnic hypoxic and hyperoxic hypercapnic ventilatory and arousal responses during natural (NS) and during flurazepam-induced (FS) sleep. We found no significant difference in the ventilatory response to hypoxia during FS compared with that during NS in 8 normal subjects. Similarly, although the ventilatory response to hypercapnia was performed in only 4 of the 8 subjects during FS, no significant difference from that during NS was noted in these subjects. There was, however, a significant decrease in the number of hypercapnic response tests in which arousal occurred after flurazepam administration (85% in NS versus 54% in FS; p less than 0.005). Additionally, an increase was seen in the mean PACO2 level at which arousal occurred during FS (51 +/- 1.6, means +/- SEM) as compared with that during NS (49 +/- 0.9; p less than 0.07). A similar but not significant decrease was noted in the number of hypoxic response tests in which arousal occurred (28% during NS versus 17% during FS). We conclude that while ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia are normal during sleep after flurazepam administration, a decrease in arousal response is seen after administration of this drug in normal subjects. This alteration in arousal response may be the pathogenic mechanism of the increased duration of apnea reported in association with flurazepam.", 
    "5": "The binding of [3H]diazepam and [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline carboxylate (beta-CCE) to rat brain membranes has been studied following injection of the ligand via a tail vein. \"Ex vivo\" binding was avoided by homogenising the tissue in an excess of unlabelled ligand. The dissociation rate constant for [3H]diazepam and [3H]beta-CCE was approximately 0.46 min-1 at 0 degree C. Displacement of [3H]diazepam by beta-CCE in vivo showed regional variation: the dose of beta-CCE required to inhibit 50% of [3H]diazepam binding in the cerebellum was one quarter of that required in the cortex, hippocampus, or striatum. However, when diazepam was used to displace [3H]beta-CCE in vivo the converse occurred: the dose needed for 50% inhibition in the cerebellum was more than four times that required in the other three regions. These findings support suggestions from in vitro experiments that two receptors exist with different affinities for benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 did not differentiate between the two receptor subtypes.", 
    "6": "The genetic activity of the structurally similar antitumor antibiotics anthramycin, tomaymycin and sibiromycin was evaluated in the standard Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay, a Salmonella typhimurium forward-mutation assay and the micronucleus test. None of the test drugs showed any significant genetic activity in forward or reverse Salmonella mutation assays. The ability of mouse-liver enzymes to produce mutagens from the drugs was examined in the Salmonella reverse-mutation assay and was generally negative. As the concentrations of sibiromycin increased, some activity was detected in the presence of liver S-9 fractions from Aroclor-induced mice. This observation could not be verified at higher concentrations in the reverse-mutation assay due to cytotoxicity, and in the forward-mutation assay due to interference with the selection process by S-9. Cytogenetic evaluation of anthramycin and tomaymycin in the micronucleus test also gave negative results. However, significant increases in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were observed in the bone marrow of sibiromycin-treated mice. The results suggest that, except for some possible activity of sibiromycin, these drugs are generally devoid of any marked genetic activity in the test systems employed.", 
    "7": "The safety and hypnotic efficacy of quazepam 30 mg vs placebo in 57 insomniac outpatients were assessed in a randomized, controlled comparison. Patients received placebo during a 3-night, single-blind baseline period, and then quazepam 30 mg or placebo during a 5-night, double-blind treatment period. Quazepam-treated patients reported significantly better sleep quantity and quality on the first treatment night and for the overall treatment period than did placebo patients. No clinically significant change was seen in pre- and posttreatment physical examinations, electrocardiograms, or routine laboratory tests. Of the 57 subjects, 20 (16 quazepam, 4 placebo) reported adverse experiences. All 20 reported daytime somnolence (drowsiness, lethargy, or sleepiness), and one quazepam-treated patient also had hypokinesia. Overall, quazepam 30 mg was a safe and effective hypnotic, with significant hypnotic activity on the first night of administration.", 
    "8": "A double-blind parallel group study was done on 80 men undergoing cystoscopy for the first time to compare the sedative and amnesic properties of midazolam and diazepam, administered with and without meperidine as an adjunct to local anesthesia for cystoscopy. Patients tolerated cystoscopy better with intravenous sedation. Premedication with 25 to 50 mg. meperidine does not add significant analgesia or sedation to intravenous diazepam or midazolam, nor does it substitute for intravenous sedation. Midazolam is superior to diazepam in increasing sedation, and decreasing pain and procedure recall. If midazolam continues to be as safe clinically as diazepam it certainly would seem superior for intravenous sedation in the patient undergoing urologic instrumentation.", 
    "9": "Recently, compounds which bind avidly to benzodiazepine binding sites have been shown to possess diazepam antagonist properties. For example, the benzodiazepine RO 15-1788 and the pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216 can antagonize the anxiolytic, sedative, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties of diazepam. The beta-carbolines have also been shown to antagonize several actions of diazepam. Other compounds including physostigmine, naloxone, bicuculline, picrotoxin, caffeine and theophylline, lack appreciable affinity for benzodiazepine binding sites but do antagonize at least some of the behavioral actions of diazepam. Their antagonist properties are probably the result of opposing pharmacological actions rather than direct receptor antagonism. Clinically, a potent safe diazepam antagonist could be used to reverse effects of diazepam overdose and to speed recovery of diazepam-treated patients after various out-patient procedures.", 
    "10": "The administration of benzodiazepines to rats is associated with alterations in the secretion of anterior pituitary hormones. Although basal secretion of prolactin and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was not changed by benzodiazepines, the secretory response to physiological and pharmacological stimuli was attenuated. Diazepam reduced the rise in secretion of prolactin during proestrus and the increase in release induced by stress, administration of fluoxetine plus 5-hydroxytryptophan and haloperidol. Diazepam also blocked the rise in release of TSH induced by exposure to cold. To establish haloperidol. Diazepam also blocked the rise in release of TSH induced by exposure to cold. To establish the site at which benzodiazepines act, anterior pituitary binding for [3H]diazepam was characterized. Scatchard analysis indicated a Kd of 11 nM and a Bmax of 27 fmol/10(6) cells. In cultures of anterior pituitary cells diazepam enhanced the inhibition of prolactin secretion produced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and dopamine. The potency of benzodiazepine analogues established that the benzodiazepine binding site in the pituitary belonged to the peripheral subtype of benzodiazepine receptors. However, the potency of analogues for inhibition of the release of prolactin and TSH following systemic administration indicates that benzodiazepines with affinity for the central subtype of receptors were the most potent. These data are interpreted to suggest that the actions of benzodiazepines on the neuroendocrine system result from their actions within the CNS on the neurons involved in the regulation of pituitary function. In addition, peripheral benzodiazepine receptors are present on cells of the anterior pituitary and these binding sites can modulate secretion of prolactin in response to its inhibitory regulators.", 
    "11": "The pharmacological consequences of the occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors have been a recent area of active research. There is good agreement between the electrophysiological effects of benzodiazepines and their binding to benzodiazepine receptors when both are studied in vitro under identical conditions. Compounds of different structure from the benzodiazepines can occupy the receptor in a way, which produces little overt effect (imidazodiazepines) or actually causes actions opposite to the benzodiazepines (beta-carbolines, inverse agonists). Several biochemical tests (GABA-shift, photo-shift) for distinguishing these different behavioral properties are described. A model is described for the interactions at membranes of agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists with benzodiazepine receptors in the GABA receptor complex.", 
    "12": "Stimulation of benzodiazepine recognition sites by various ligands can elicit opposite types of responses such as proconvulsant and anticonvulsant or proconflict and anticonflict actions. The study of the pharmacological profile of various ligands makes it possible to distinguish three classes of compounds: (1) those that elicit anticonflict responses in the Vogel test, inhibit the convulsions due to an impairment of GABAergic transmission and increase the Bmax of the high affinity recognition site for GABA; (2) those that displace benzodiazepines from specific binding sites, facilitate convulsions due to impairment of GABAergic mechanisms, elicit proconflict responses in Vogel's test and inhibit the facilitation by benzodiazepines of GABA binding and (3) those that displace benzodiazepines and beta-carboline-derivatives from specific binding sites, antagonize the anticonflict, the proconflict, the anticonvulsant and the proconvulsant actions of the two preceding groups of substances and in very large doses elicit a small proconvulsant action. Examples of the latter are an imidazobenzodiazepine (RO 15-1788) and a pyrazolquinolinone derivative (CGS 8216). The nomenclature for these three classes of drugs should be kept flexible until the action of the endogenous ligand that functions as the physiological effector of the benzodiazepine/beta-carboline recognition site is known. A putative ligand for this site (DBI = diazepam binding inhibitor) has been isolated and purified to homogeneity. It includes 104 amino acid residues, the sequence of the last 45 amino acids has been determined. This compound elicits a proconflict action, displaces beta-carboline derivatives more than anxiolytic benzodiazepines, but its high molecular weight and relative low affinity for the binding sites in brain might suggest that it is a precursor, rather than the putative effector for benzodiazepine and/or beta-carboline recognition sites.", 
    "13": "Extraneurally released gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interacts with specific recognition sites associated with proteins located in postsynaptic neuronal membranes that function as chloride (Cl-)ionophores. As a result of the interaction between GABA and the recognition sites, Cl- ionophores are opened causing an influx or an efflux of Cl-, depending on the values of the Cl- equilibrium potential and of the membrane potential. Hyperpolarization or depolarization will result from inward or outward Cl- fluxes, respectively. Independently of the change in conductivity elicited by GABA, this amino acid transmitter will reduce the effectiveness of the sodium ion (Na+) excitatory potential. In attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanism, whereby benzodiazepines facilitate the action of GABA on membrane conductance without changing the activity of Cl- or other ionophore, a basic protein (GABA-modulin, GM) has been isolated from rat brain which is similar in structure to the small molecular weight myelin basic protein, found in rodent brain. While GABA-modulin is located in synaptosomes, the small molecular weight myelin basic protein is located in the myelin fraction: more important, GABA-modulin inhibited the high affinity binding of GABA to crude synaptic membranes while the basic myelin protein did not. Also, amino acid composition and molecular weight differentiate the two proteins. The GABA-modulin can be phosphorylated with different stoichiometry by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (4 mol PO4(-3)) or Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (1 mol PO4(-3)). Only cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation inhibited the action of GABA-modulin on GABA binding.", 
    "14": "The benzodiazepine--gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor--ionophore system is an oligomeric complex, composed of at least three interacting components. These three components have been well characterized in vitro by radioreceptor binding assays. A variety of centrally acting anxiolytic, depressant, anticonvulsant and convulsant drugs, which affect GABAergic transmission, bind to one of the sites and modulate the binding of ligands at the other sites. Thus, depressant barbiturates, nonbarbiturate hypnotics (like etomidate) and pyrazolopyridines (like etazolate), while inhibiting the binding of alpha-dihydropicrotoxinin (DHP), enhance the binding of GABA and benzodiazepines. These enhancing effects are blocked by convulsant drugs that inhibit the binding of dihydropicrotoxinin and also by bicuculline. These interactions involving barbiturates and other modulatory drugs, exhibit stereoselectivity, anion dependence and brain regional selectivity. Several classes of drugs which facilitate GABAergic transmission appear to interact with the sites for GABA and benzodiazepines allosterically via the dihydropicrotoxinin site of the oligomeric complex. The GABA system has also been implicated in a variety of pathological conditions, including anxiety, seizure activity, movement disorders, cardiovascular control, pain and in drug dependence. Since most of the GABA agonists do not pass the blood-brain barrier, future trends in the pharmacology of GABA may be the development of drugs that will activate the GABA receptor system via picrotoxinin or benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "15": "Recent studies have shown that benzodiazepine receptors can be affected not only by benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists but also by a new class of ligands which produce effects opposite to those of benzodiazepines, that is they produce convulsions and anxiety. These ligands can be described as having a negative efficacy at the receptor; tentatively they are named \"inverse agonists\". Pharmacological experiments indicate that agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists comprise a whole continuum of agents with a graduated variety of efficacy at the receptor. Biochemical studies, supported by published electrophysiological data, indicate that the benzodiazepine receptor allosterically up- or down-regulates the gain in the GABAergic system depending on the nature of the ligand.", 
    "16": "Receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are phylogenetically old and extensive GABA receptor multiplicity had already evolved in invertebrate species. High affinity, \"brain specific\", benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, present in the central nervous systems of virtually all vertebrate species, represent a heterogeneous sub-class of GABA receptors. Functional GABA-BZ-ion receptor complexes are aggregates consisting of different kinds of sub-units which are probably coded for by separate genes. These sub-units may be combined in different ways to yield different benzodiazepine receptor complexes. Different GABA-BZ-ion receptor complexes probably subserve different physiological functions and more selective drugs modifying these functions will probably be found.", 
    "17": "An assortment of drugs was injected into one or both ventromedial nuclei of the thalamus, to see how these influenced stereotypy, locomotion and posture in spontaneously behaving and actively rotating rats. Unilateral intrathalamic muscimol promoted weak ipsiversive circling, while bilateral treatment gave catalepsy. Similar injections of 4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid, which inhibits gamma-aminobutyrate metabolism, raised gamma-aminobutyrate levels in the ventromedial nuclei more than three-fold yet had none of these behavioural effects. The indirectly acting gamma-aminobutyrate agonists flurazepam and cis-1,3-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid had little effect on posture and locomotion and, like muscimol and 4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid, elicited only very weak stereotypies. Procaine behaved like the gamma-aminobutyrate antagonist bicuculline, provoking vigorous locomotor hyperactivity and teeth chattering if given uni- or bilaterally. Pretreatment of one ventromedial nucleus with muscimol or 4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid, and to a lesser extent flurazepam or cis- 1,3-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid, gave rise to pronounced ipsilateral asymmetries when combined with a large systemic dose of apomorphine. Contraversive rotations were initiated by unilateral stereotaxic injection of muscimol into the substantia nigra pars reticulata, or with apomorphine from the supersensitive striatum in unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats. Drug treatments in the ipsilateral ventromedial nucleus showed a similar rank order of potency at inhibiting these circling behaviours, seemingly by reducing apomorphine-induced posture and muscimol-induced hypermotility. The suppression of circling by muscimol in these tests was highlighted by introducing the compound into the ventromedial nucleus at the height of circling activity. Both types of circling stimulus lost the capacity to increase locomotion, but still caused head turning and stereotypy in rats made cataleptic with bilateral ventromedial muscimol. Treating one ventromedial thalamus with muscimol greatly intensified any pre-existing posture directed towards that side, and vice versa. These data suggest that the ventromedial nucleus is not involved with the expression of stereotyped behaviours, but can profoundly influence posture and locomotion, especially in the presence of some other motor stimulus. The recovery of circus movements in rats with impaired ventromedial nucleus function implies this nucleus is not essential for the execution of circling in these models.", 
    "18": "The recently reported potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) evoked depolarizations by caffeine in the frog spinal cord might involve an interaction with GABA-linked benzodiazepine receptors. This possibility was investigated using a new potent benzodiazepine, midazolam, and a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 147437. Caffeine or midazolam enhanced the amplitude of submaximal GABA responses by about 50%; when equieffective enhancing doses of these compounds were simultaneously applied, GABA depolarizations were usually depressed below control levels. It was however possible to detect a narrow range of concentrations of midazolam which had an additive effect to the enhancement by caffeine. Ro 147437 did not block caffeine-induced potentiations of GABA responses. It is suggested that caffeine and benzodiazepines have distinct modes of action in modulating GABA-induced depolarizations in the in vitro spinal cord of the frog.", 
    "19": "The discriminative stimulus properties of nalorphine were studied in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate i.m. injections of nalorphine (1 mg/kg) from saline. During training, a two-lever paradigm was employed where a single, 3-min extinction schedule was followed by fixed-ratio-20 schedules of food presentation. During the fixed-rate schedules, responses on one of the two levers produced food when nalorphine had been administered and responses on the other lever produced food when saline had been administered. During stimulus generalization tests, responses on either lever produced food under the fixed-ratio schedule. The discriminative stimulus effects of nalorphine were antagonized by naloxone which, by itself, did not generalize to nalorphine. The kappa opiate agonists, ethylketocyclazocine, U-50,488, bremazocine, tifluadom, as well as two mixed kappa-sigma agonists, dl-cyclazocine and dl-N-allylnormetazocine (SKF-10047), generalized to nalorphine with the following potency ranking order: bremazocine greater than ethylketocyclazocine greater than tifluadom greater than cyclazocine greater than U-50,488 greater than N-allylnormetazocine greater than nalorphine. The levo-isomers of cyclazocine, N-allylnormetazocine or U-50,488 generalized to nalorphine whereas the dextroisomers did not. Generalization to nalorphine did not occur with the mu opiate agonists, morphine, methadone and meperidine, or the nonopiate compounds, phencyclidine, ketamine and chlorpromazine. The results suggest that a kappa opiate receptor mechanism mediates the discriminative effects of nalorphine in the rhesus monkey, which may also be involved with the naloxone-sensitive, sedative and dysphoric effects of nalorphine in humans.", 
    "20": "Cocaine poisoning has increased recently, and survival is rare because of its sudden onset and rapidly fatal course. A patient is described in whom cocaine poisoning developed. This condition was manifest by the findings of acute agitation, diaphoresis, and tachycardia, and was complicated by grand mal seizures, severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis, apnea, and accelerated idioventricular rhythm. After control of the seizures with diazepam and treatment of the acidosis with ventilation and bicarbonate, the ventricular dysrhythmia abated, and the patient made a quick recovery. Recently reported experiments suggest that seizures are a major determinant of lethality in cocaine poisoning. Treatment of the seizures is of prime importance, and correction of the acidosis can normalize cardiac rhythm and function in these critically ill patients.", 
    "21": "PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide] is a new ligand for the \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine binding sites, chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines. It displaces with a very high potency (IC50 congruent to 10(-9) M) [3H]-RO5-4864 (a benzodiazepine which specifically labels the peripheral-type sites) from its binding sites. [3H]PK 11195 binds to a membrane fraction from rat brain cortex and rat olfactory bulb in a saturable and reversible manner with a very high affinity (KD = 10(-9) M). The number of maximal binding sites was ten times greater in the olfactory bulb than in the brain cortex. The order of potency of several compounds as displacers at 25 degrees C (PK 11195 greater than RO5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than dipyridamole greater than clonazepam) demonstrates that [3H]PK 11195 binds to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. The KD value for the [3H]PK 11195 binding is not affected by temperature changes, whereas RO5-4864 and diazepam affinities decrease with increasing temperatures. Autoradiographic images of [3H]PK 11195 binding to rat brain sections show that binding sites are mainly localized in the olfactory bulb, median eminence, choroid plexus, and ependyma. This ligand could be a useful tool to elucidate the physiological and pharmacological relevance of these binding sites.", 
    "22": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a syndrome of generalized neural inhibition, which complicates both acute and chronic liver failure. Since gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter of the brain and HE is associated with increased responsiveness to certain drugs (benzodiazepines and barbiturates) that mediate neural inhibition by binding to the GABA receptor complex on postsynaptic neural membranes, the status of this receptor complex in HE was investigated. Fulminant hepatic failure was induced in rabbits by the intravenous injection of galactosamine hydrochloride. Neural membranes were isolated from the brains of normal rabbits, rabbits in hepatic coma, and rabbits with another type of metabolic encephalopathy, uremic coma. To characterize GABA and benzodiazine receptors, measurements were made of the specific binding to neural membranes of 3H-GABA and 3H-flunitrazepam, respectively. Computer-assisted Scatchard plot analysis of the binding data suggested the presence of two independent receptors for GABA and a single class of receptor for benzodiazepines. Hepatic coma was associated with no changes in the affinities of these receptors but with significant increases in their densities: 0.34 vs. 0.60; 1.1 vs. 2.2; and 4.6 vs. 7.3 pmol/mg of membrane protein for the high-affinity GABA, low-affinity GABA and benzodiazepine receptors, respectively. Uremic coma was associated with no changes in the affinities or densities of GABA receptors. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that (1) increased numbers of GABA receptors in liver failure may potentiate neural inhibition by increasing the sensitivity of the brain to GABA and (2) increased responsiveness to the sedative-hypnotic effects of benzodiazepines in liver failure may be mediated by increased numbers of receptors for this class of drug, permitting increased drug effect.", 
    "23": "Three experiments failed to provide consistent evidence for an effect of 2.70 GHz pulsed microwave radiation up to 20 mW/cm2 on pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures or on the efficacy of chlordiazepoxide for counteracting such seizures. Microwave radiation counteracted the hypothermic effects of chlordiazepoxide without altering its antiseizure efficacy. This underscores the dissociation between thermal and pharmacological effects of microwaves.", 
    "24": "[3H]-N6-cyclohexyladenosine and [3H]-1,3-diethyl-8-phenylxanthine label the A1 subtype of adenosine receptor in brain membranes. The affinities of methylxanthines in competing for A1 adenosine receptors parallel their potencies as locomotor stimulants. The adenosine agonist N6-(phenylisopropyl) adenosine is a potent locomotor depressant. Both diazepam and N6-(L-phenylisopropyl)adenosine cause locomotor stimulation in a narrow range of subdepressant doses. Combined stimulant doses of the two agents depress motor activity, as do larger doses of either one, given separately. Evidence supporting and against the hypothesis that some of the actions of benzodiazepines are mediated via the adenosine system is reviewed. A number of compounds interact with both systems, probably because of physico-chemical similarities between adenosine and diazepam. It is concluded that of the four classic actions of benzodiazepines, the sedative and muscle relaxant (but not anxiolytic or anticonvulsant) actions could possibly be mediated by adenosine.", 
    "25": "Effects of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) on conflict behavior were studied using a punished water-lick (conflict) paradigm in rats. PTZ (5-20 mg/kg, ip) produced a dose-related enhancement of conflict behavior as demonstrated by a suppression of lick responding in low shock intensity (1.3-2.0 mA). Furthermore, PTZ (2-20 mg/kg, ip) clearly antagonized the release of punished responding induced by diazepam (5 mg/kg, ip), chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.) or meprobamate (75 mg/kg, ip) when a high intensity of shock (2.5 or 3 mA) was used. Bemegride also showed a similar suppressive effect on the anticonflict action of diazepam. However, bicuculline, picrotoxin or strychnine neither enhanced conflict behavior nor inhibited the anticonflict action of diazepam, even in high doses. In addition, PTZ (10 or 20 mg/kg, ip) did not show any significant effect on unpunished drinking or flinch-jump threshold, suggesting that the conflict enhancing action of PTZ may not be due to the secondary action including decrease in drive for drinking or increase in sensitivity to shock. These results suggest that PTZ may exert facilitation of conflict behavior or suppression of the anticonflict action of anxiolytics via an activation of the conflict generating mechanisms.", 
    "26": "Nineteen healthy volunteers were studied to investigate whether or not muscarinic receptors of different exocrine glands could be distinguished from one another by the use of pirenzepine. A simultaneous evaluation of lacrimation, salivation and gastric secretion was carried out, bethanechol (80 micrograms/kg/hr) being used as a stimulant and pirenzepine (10 or 5 mg i.v.) as an inhibitor. Bethanechol increased salivation significantly and the volume of gastric juice, and non-significantly increased lacrimation and total acid output. Pirenzepine abolished the hypersecretion induced by bethanechol, and decreased the basal level of the exocrine secretions, to approximately the same extent. These experiments seem to demonstrate that if there is a difference among the muscarinic receptors of lacrimal, salivary and gastric oxyntic glands, pirenzepine is unable to discriminate them from one another, at least under the experimental conditions of this investigation.", 
    "27": "Preclinical studies in laboratory rodents and non-human primates have led to the hypothesis that noradrenergic hyperactivity is associated with some human anxiety states. This hypothesis has recently received support from a variety of clinical investigations. Drugs which increase noradrenergic function induce anxiety in human subjects. Increased turnover of norepinephrine has been shown to occur with naturally occurring anxiety conditions. The mechanism of action clonidine and tricyclic antidepressants as antianxiety agents may be due to their ability to reduce central noradrenergic function. Future studies will need to evaluate, in addition to central noradrenergic function, other neuronal systems in brain involving endogenous opioids, benzodiazepine receptors, purines and gamma-aminobutyric acid in human anxiety disorders.", 
    "28": "Several new non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics are reported. These include tracazolate, zopiclone, CL218,872, CGS9896, buspirone, MK-801 and fenobam. A comparison of anticonflict effects and propensity to cause sedation and potentiate the actions of ethanol is given as well as their effects upon the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam in vitro. Their anxiolytic properties after treatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist, RO15-1788, are reported also. Tracazolate shows a wide separation between anxiolytic activity and ability to cause sedation and to potentiate alcohol. It enhanced binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam in contrast to benzodiazepines which displace it. Buspirone was without anticonflict activity and had no effect on benzodiazepine binding while fenobam and MK-801, also without effect on binding, showed large and small differences on causing sedation and potentiating alcohol respectively. Among the displacers of [3H]flunitrazepam zopiclone showed diminished sedation liability, compared to diazepam, as did CL218,872 and CGS9896. Zopiclone caused potentiation of ethanol however, at doses close to anxiolytic doses, while CL218,872 and CGS9896 showed a wider safety margin for potentiation of ethanol compared to anxiolytic doses. The drug RO15-1788 antagonised the anticonflict effects of benzodiazepine displacers and had no effects upon the other agents studied.", 
    "29": "In the absence of fully characterized biological indexes, anxiety is at present measured as unpleasant effects reported verbally by patients. Because of the subjective nature of the syndrome, animal analogues have been difficult to design, but quests for new anxiolytics and a deeper understanding of the neurobiology of anxiety have fostered the development of several animal models. Usually, animals are exposed to exteroceptive or interoceptive stimuli which can be interpreted as capable of causing anxiety in humans. Then, the animals are observed for responses or behavioral deficits resulting from those stimuli in order to provide an index of anxiety. Behavioral responses that are reliably produced by those stimuli and that are also antagonized by anxiolytic drugs are accepted as analogues of anxiety. Exteroceptive stimuli, useful in this respect, consist of a variety of noxious treatments such as exposure to conflict-situations or unavoidable electric shock, whereas interoceptive stimuli consist of treatment with anxiogenic drugs or electrical stimulation of selected brain areas. Elicitation of unconditioned behavior or changes in the rate of conditioned (learned) responding have been employed as measures of anxiety responses following application of either exteroceptive or interoceptive stimuli. These measures, although useful in detecting anxiolytic drugs, possess several weaknesses. They suffer from difficulties in obtaining quantitative and objective data, they do not differentiate between anxiety and stress or fear, they are unable to measure further deterioration of behavior expected to occur when more potent anxiogenic stimuli are tested and they often present difficulty in differentiating direct motor effects of a number of stimuli are not related to anxiety. More recently, interest in the development of other analogues of anxiety has led to the use of drug-discrimination paradigms. In this approach, interoceptive discriminative stimuli, produced by anxiogenic drugs, are used as analogues of anxiety in animals. As an example of this approach, data are reviewed showing that pentylenetetrazol, an anxiogenic drug in humans, produces interoceptive stimuli which can be readily discriminated by rats. Further, these stimuli can be easily quantified through dose-response analysis. All known anxiogenic drugs generalize to pentylenetetrazol-induced interoceptive discriminative stimuli. Similarly, other anxiety-provoking situations in humans, such as withdrawal from dependence on benzodiazepines, also generalize to the pentylenetetrazol-induced stimuli. Alternatively, all known anxiolytic drugs antagonize these stimuli with a relative potency similar to", 
    "30": "The effects of phenazepam and sodium hydroxybutyrate on the somatic manifestations, ultrastructure of the cortex and lipid content of the adrenals in rats exposed to immobilization were examined. Both the drugs had the stress-protective effect, decreasing the stress manifestations at alarm and resistance stages.", 
    "31": "It was shown in experiments on mice that 25 hours after chronic treatment with fenibut (100 mg/kg, twice daily for 10 days) was discontinued the number of benzodiazepine and GABAA (bicucullin-sensitive) receptor sites was increased and 48 hours after treatment discontinuation the number of GABAB (bicucullin nonsensitive) sites was decreased. The enhanced binding to GABAA and GABAB receptor sites and the decreased binding to benzodiazepine receptors was observed 24 hours after discontinuation of chronic treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg, twice daily). Forty-eight hours after diazepam chronic treatment was discontinued the number of benzodiazepine receptor sites was increased. The involvement of the increased benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity in the mechanism of therapeutic activity of fenibut is suggested.", 
    "32": "Healthy volunteers received a single dose of triazolam (0.5 mg) or oxazepam (30 mg) on two occasions, once in the control state and again during coadministration of isoniazid (INH) base, 180 mg day. INH coadministration prolonged triazolam half-life (3.3 vs 2.5 h, P less than 0.05) and increased total area under the curve (38.6 vs 26.5 ng ml-1 h, P less than 0.01) consistent with a reduction of apparent oral clearance (3.9 vs 6.8 ml min-1 kg-1, 0.05 less than P less than 0.1). INH coadministration had no influence on the kinetics of oxazepam. INH impairs hepatic microsomal oxidation of triazolam, leading to reduced first-pass hepatic extraction as well as prolonged half-life. However INH had no influence on oxazepam conjugation.", 
    "33": "Midazolam given orally the night before and on the morning of operation had a distinct subjective pre-operative sedative effect as compared with placebo. Patients receiving midazolam also experienced less apprehension and excitement before surgery, but in relation to quality of sleep, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) concentrations were determined just before induction of anaesthesia and were significantly lower in the midazolam group (2.14 pg/ml, SD 0.96) than in the placebo group (3.07 pg/ml, SD 1.73). Our results show that midazolam is a useful sedative anxiolytic oral premedicant, which appears to prevent initiation of a stress reaction before induction of anaesthesia.", 
    "34": "20 patients under therapy or intoxicated by benzodiazepines were studied. A partial inhibition of (Ca2+, Mg2+)ATPase on 'B' membranes (CaM rich membranes) was evident in 2 cases. A total inhibition of (Ca2+, Mg2+) ATPase on both 'B' and 'A' (CaM depleted) membranes was noted in 1 case: the patient who was severely intoxicated had pronounced hemolysis. As an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of this action, the effect of diazepam chosen as model compound was studied on 'B' and 'A' membranes prepared from normal human RBC previously incubated with diazepam. A high concentration of diazepam, corresponding to a 20-fold therapeutic level results in a 50% inhibition of the maximal activity of the enzyme on 'B' membranes. It may be speculated from these experiments that the effect of high concentration of benzodiazepines on CaM dependent (Ca2+, Mg2+) ATPase leads to accelerated RBC destruction.", 
    "35": "Healthy adults (N = 10) were given oral doses of lorazepam (1 and 2 mg), diazepam (5 and 10 mg), clorazepate (7.5 and 15 mg), or placebo and tested 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes later on a word-recall memory task. All subjects received each drug dose once and placebo twice in randomized order at weekly intervals. Testing was double-blind. Lorazepam was found to have a significantly greater effect on memory than placebo. Diazepam and clorazepate did not differ significantly from placebo in their effect on word recall. High doses of lorazepam produced more pronounced memory effects than did low doses; neither diazepam nor clorazepate was found to exert a dose-related effect on memory.", 
    "36": "Presented here are four cases of catatonic reactions which were felt to be neuroleptic induced. Intravenous lorazepam was rapidly effective in reversing the catatonia and attendant symptoms. Lorazepam's previous uses and pharmacological profile are discussed. Reviewed briefly are catatonia and its neuroleptic-induced forms. Possible mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effect of intravenous lorazepam in these cases are then examined.", 
    "37": "The author provides an overview of the literature on benzodiazepine abuse to define and assess the nature and extent of abuse. Researchers generally use four criteria for recognizing benzodiazepine abuse: taking the drug after the medical or psychiatric need has passed; taking the drug in amounts greater than those prescribed; taking the drug to get high; and taking the drug to further psychological regression. After reviewing the literature on each of these criteria, the author concludes that the overall incidence of benzodiazepine abuse is low, and that physicians can act to minimize its occurrence.", 
    "38": "Rats were exposed to a two-lever drug discrimination procedure using the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonists N'-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142) or methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). FG 7142 (30 mg/kg) failed to acquire discriminative stimulus control, although it did suppress responding. The same group of animals was trained successfully to discriminate diazepam (DZP, 2.5 mg/kg) from vehicle. The DZP cue was potentiated by the GABA agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c] pyridin-3-ol (THIP, 1,3 mg/kg); THIP alone produced vehicle-appropriate responding. In addition, clonazepam (0.2 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) substituted for DZP (with potencies of 7.5 and 0.25 times that of DZP, respectively). In antagonism tests, FG 7142 (5-17.5 mg/kg), methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM, 2.5 mg/kg) did not effect, bicuculline (2 mg/kg) and DMCM (1 mg/kg) partially blocked, and the BZ receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (40 mg/kg) completely blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of DZP. In animals trained to discriminate DMCM (0.2 mg/kg) from vehicle, 95.2% substitution occurred with bicuculline (2 mg/kg); DZP (1-5 mg/kg) completely antagonized DMCM. These results indicate that the DZP cue is mediated by GABA-coupled BZ receptors and that GABA may modulate the efficacy of a BZ at its receptor site. However, since inverse BZ receptor agonists (FG 7142, DMCM and beta-CCM) were, at best, only marginally effective in antagonizing DZP, the DZP cue may be mediated by a distinct subclass of BZ receptors.", 
    "39": "The effects of 5-MeODMT (2.5 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), methysergide and the stereoisomers of propranolol (6 mg/kg) on hyponeophagia were studied in both sexes of the Roman strains of rats, selectively bred for acquisition of a two-way conditioned avoidance response. Diazepam, methysergide and 1-propranolol increased feeding in a novel environment whilst 5-MeODMT decreased it and d-propranolol was inactive. Several strain differences in drug responsiveness occurred, the Roman Low Avoidance subjects being most sensitive to all drugs tested as well as being most neophobic. A sex difference in 5-MeODMT sensitivity was also found, female rats of the Roman High and Control Avoidance strains being more sensitive than males. The findings are discussed in connection with differences in arousal and biochemical parameters between these strains.", 
    "40": "A withdrawal syndrome occurred in two patients after substitution of a short-acting benzodiazepine for a long-acting benzodiazepine. Both patients had used long-acting benzodiazepines on a daily basis for many years. In one case, oxazepam was substituted for diazepam, and in the other, temazepam was substituted for flurazepam hydrochloride. In both cases the short-acting benzodiazepine was substituted in a once-daily dosage. Withdrawal symptoms followed and persisted for at least one month. Relative advantages and disadvantages of short-acting and long-acting benzodiazepines are discussed.", 
    "41": "The hypothesis that in utero exposure to diazepam increases the risk of oral-cleft anomalies was evaluated in a case-control study, in which 445 infants with cleft lip with or without cleft palate and 166 with cleft palate without cleft lip (cleft palate alone) were compared with 2498 control infants having other birth defects. For exposure to diazepam during lunar months 1 through 4 relative to no exposure during pregnancy, the estimated relative risks were 1.0 for cleft lip with or without cleft palate (95 per cent confidence interval, 0.5 to 2.1) and 0.8 for cleft palate alone (0.3 to 2.7). After control for all identified potential confounding factors, the corresponding estimates were 0.8 (0.4 to 1.7) and 0.8 (0.2 to 2.5), respectively. The findings were unchanged when maternal suspicion that diazepam might be a teratogen was taken into account. The data suggest that first-trimester exposure to diazepam does not materially affect the risk of cleft lip with or without cleft palate or of cleft palate alone.", 
    "42": "The development of tolerance to the protective effects of diazepam (4 mg/kg) against seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) were studied in 3 strains of mice. Significant tolerance developed to protection against myoclonic jerks induced by PTZ (90-100 mg/kg) by day 5 in Tuck No. 1 and by day 10 in C3H/HE and CD-1 mice. Tolerance developed to protection against tonic-clonic convulsions by day 10 in Tuck No. 1 mice and by day 30 in the other strains. Diazepam remained protective against tonic-clonic convulsions (but not against myoclonus) induced by threshold doses of PTZ for 30 days in all 3 strains.", 
    "43": "Noradrenaline release from synaptosomes of rat hippocampus is modulated by both GABA and benzodiazepines. GABAA and GABAB receptors are present on these nerve terminals, and agonists at these receptors enhance spontaneous release and depress K+ -evoked release, respectively. Chlordiazepoxide has a dual effect: it enhances the action of GABA at GABAA receptors and depresses K+ -evoked release of [3H]noradrenaline in the absence of GABA. The mechanism of these actions and their in vivo role are discussed.", 
    "44": "We have found high-affinity binding (site-A) and low-affinity binding (site-B) of benzodiazepines to membrane homogenates of embryonic chick brain and spinal cord. A new technique was developed to permit the determination of complete electrophysiological dose-response curves on single neurons in cell culture, eliminating cell-to-cell variability as a problem that complicates the interpretation of pooled data. The electrophysiological potencies and binding affinities of a series of benzodiazepines correlate well for site-A but not for site-B or the micromolar site reported in adult rat brain. Site-A and the electrophysiological response are sensitive to photo-affinity blockade with flunitrazepam (FNZM) by about 75% while site-B is resistant to blockade. The FNZM-photolinked benzodiazepine receptor/GABA receptor complex is not chronically potentiated and thus exists in an 'unpotentiated' state. These experiments suggest that site-A in embryonic CNS membranes corresponds to a functional benzodiazepine receptor/GABA receptor complex in spinal cord cell cultures.", 
    "45": "The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro5-4864 to crude homogenates of amygdala-kindled and 'yoked' control rat brains was evaluated in subjects sacrificed 60 days after the sixth generalized convulsion. Decreases in the Bmax for [3H]flunitrazepam binding to 'central-type' benzodiazepine receptors were observed in the hypothalamus and ipsilateral cortex of kindled animals. The binding of [3H]Ro5-4864 to 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors was unchanged.", 
    "46": "The characteristics of GABA and benzodiazepine receptors were examined in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebral cortex of female rats at various times (up to 9 months) after the subcutaneous implantation of an estradiol pellet (10 mg). A significant decrease in the Bmax of the high-affinity binding of [3H]muscimol to membranes from these 3 regions was detected as soon as one week after the implantation. Although the characteristics of the high-affinity binding of [3H]flunitrazepam remained unaffected during the whole treatment, the stimulatory effect of GABA (and muscimol) on this binding was significantly reduced by estrogenization. The changes in GABA receptor binding appeared functionally relevant since the elevation of striatal acetylcholine levels normally induced by the peripheral administration of muscimol (5 mg/kg) was significantly lower in estradiol-treated than in control female rats. In contrast to that observed in intact female rats, the implantation of estradiol in hypophysectomized animals did not affect the characteristics of [3H]muscimol binding to hippocampal, striatal and cortical membranes. [3H]muscimol binding was also unchanged in female rats implanted with estradiol and treated chronically with bromocriptine for 3 weeks. Since both hypophysectomy and the chronic administration of bromocriptine suppressed the hyperprolactinemia normally induced by estrogenization, the down-regulation of central GABA receptors very likely involved prolactin in intact animals implanted with 17-beta-estradiol.", 
    "47": "In a recent study the effect of Pirencepine in the treatment of peptic gastric or duodenal ulcers was reported. Relapse rates were investigated one year after the end of these studies. The patients did not receive any treatment to prevent ulcer recurrence. It was found that 20% of the patients who have had ulcer healing after 4 weeks of Pirenzepine treatment, exhibited recurrent ulcers. The relapse rate was higher in these patients who had one or more ulcers prior to the Pirencepine studies. From the results of the present investigation it is concluded that Pirenzepine has a more beneficial effect in the treatment of peptic ulcers than placebo as observed in other studies.", 
    "48": "The intraventricular administration of [3H-methyl]-methionine resulted in a steady increase in carboxyl-[3H]methylated protein formation in the brain of developing rats (2-42 days). The analysis by gel filtration on Sepharose-4B of Lubrol-Px-solubilized membrane proteins, including benzodiazepine receptor proteins, revealed co-migration of carboxyl-[3H]methylated and [3H]flunitrazepam-binding protein species. The latter displayed a single peak at 2 days and 2-3 peaks subsequently. At 26 days the lighter of the two [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol-binding peaks associated with the principal carboxyl-[3H]-methylated protein peak. The findings suggest the participation of carboxyl-methylation in the maturation of benzodiazepine receptor proteins.", 
    "49": "Ro5-3663, a convulsant benzodiazepine and a ligand for CNS picrotoxin sites, but not for benzodiazepine sites, had a significant dose-related (2 and 4 mg/kg) anxiogenic action in the social interaction test of anxiety. This anxiogenic effect was reversed by chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg).", 
    "50": "Diazepam (70-150 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibits oxygen consumption by pig kidney embryo cells and causes the cellular ATP level to fall. The maximum inhibitory effect develops after 1.5-2.5 h of diazepam treatment. In isolated mitochondria diazepam inhibits respiration in state 2 and 3u with glutamate and in state 3u with succinate. Ethylrhodamine staining and electron microscopic study reveal fragmentation of mitochondria in living cells.", 
    "51": "Synaptic junction (SJ) fractions have been isolated from rat cerebellum which are similar to forebrain SJs on the basis of morphology and enrichment of synaptic structures. The polypeptide compositions of SJ fractions were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional SDS-gel electrophoresis and stained by the silver technique. Equivalent numbers of proteins that possess similar relative mobilities (Mr), isoelectric points and staining intensities were present in cerebellum and forebrain synaptic fractions. A few prominent differences were observed between cerebellum and forebrain synaptic fractions; cerebellum SJs contained a 240 K protein that was not detected in the forebrain and the 52,000 K, major PSDp protein was present in forebrain SJs in amounts that are approximately 5-fold greater than in cerebellum SJ fractions. The identity of the cerebellum mPSDp was verified by electrophoretic mobility, peptide fingerprinting and [125I]calmodulin binding. Differences between various synaptic fractions in mannose containing glycoproteins were examined by the binding of [125I]concanavalin A (Con A) to gels. On the basis of apparent molecular weights, the glycoproteins in forebrain and cerebellum SPMs were very similar. In contrast, however, the prominent glycoproteins that reside in the postsynaptic junctional membrane of forebrain SJs were undetectable in SJ fractions isolated from cerebellum. SJ fractions from cerebellum contained their own distinct group of Con A binding glycoproteins. SPM and SJ fractions from forebrain and cerebellum were examined for receptors for excitatory (aspartate, glutamate and kainic acid) and inhibitory (GABA) neurotransmitters and the benzodiazepine analog flunitrazepam. On the basis of relative receptor contents, SJ fractions isolated from either brain region were qualitatively similar and bound significant amounts of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters. These findings support the notion that SJs from cerebellum contain a distinct class of synaptic elements that are in large part derived from asymmetric, type I synapses.", 
    "52": "In agreement with other workers we report increased [3H]R05-4864 binding in kainate-lesioned rat striatum. [3H]R05-4864 binding, a possible glial marker, was also increased in temporal cortex obtained post-mortem from patients with Alzheimer's disease. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding was decreased in these brain samples, possibly indicative of neuronal cell loss. It is suggested that the poor binding characteristics of [3H]R05-4864 in human brain samples may limit its usefulness in assessing gliosis.", 
    "53": "The benzodiazepine receptor ligand methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate was applied by micropressure-ejection in the course of extracellular recordings of spontaneously firing rat brain hippocampal pyramidal cells in vivo. Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate was found to attenuate the depressant effects of GABA, increase the spontaneous firing rate and increase the tendency to fire in bursts. The possibility that both firing rate and burst firing in the hippocampus are controlled by the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA is discussed. Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate is a convulsant and this action on GABA could explain the mechanism. Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate seems to have effects on the firing of CA1 neurons which are similar to the effects reported for ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and opposite to those reported for the benzodiazepines midazolam and diazepam.", 
    "54": "The effects of wisanine and dihydrowisanine were studied on stereotyped and aggressive behaviour induced by apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) in chicks. Pretreatment of chicks with wisanine (0.3-0.6 g/kg i.p.) and dihydrowisanine (0.2-0.4 g/kg i.p.) dose dependently antagonised fighting episodes and pecking of the chick's own feet and those of other chicks. It has been suggested that the antagonism is due to dopaminergic receptor blockade and demonstrates the antipsychotic effect of these drugs.", 
    "55": "The methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide FG 7142 (10 mg/kg i.p.) produced a pronounced state of alertness, attentive behavior and fearfulness in the cat. Electroencephalographic (EEG) desynchronization in the cortex and theta rhythms in the hippocampus occurred concomitantly. Behavioral and hippocampal EEG actions of FG 7142 were reduced by Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg i.p.). The benzodiazepines diazepam and quazepam produced behavioral and EEG effects which were completely antagonized by FG 7142. The pentobarbital effects also were partially antagonized. These findings suggest that the cat provides an interesting model to study the anxiogenic properties of beta-carbolines.", 
    "56": "In screening neuroactive compounds for their possible interaction with rat thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors, some benzodiazepines were found to compete relatively potently for specific [3H](3-Me-His2)TRH [( 3H]MeTRH) binding. The profile of activity (chlordiazepoxide greater than diazepam greater than flurazepam greater than lurazepam greater than flunitrazepam) was almost identical for washed pituitary, retina and amygdala preparations. Corresponding Ki values for the latter region were (microM): 0.33, 3.24, 17.4 for the 3 most active inhibitors. Other (47) neuroactive substances exhibited little activity on [3H]MeTRH binding. All benzodiazepines tested were competitive inhibitors in the three tissues. These data support previous evidence for a close similarity of TRH receptors in the pituitary gland and central nervous system, and invoke the possibility of TRH receptor-mediated effects for some benzodiazepines.", 
    "57": "The Scatchard graph for estimating molecular receptor capacity was recently criticized for its subjectivity, by means of several examples in which graphical methods yielded meaningless estimates of receptor capacity. We applied mathematical binding models and statistical estimation to the same examples and derived quantitative measures of the uncertainty in receptor capacity. The uncertainty was within such bounds that an approximate picture of the nature and number of sites was recoverable.", 
    "58": "The incidence of accidents over five years in a group of patients who had taken benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, and antidepressants for more than a year was compared with that in control patients who had not been taking tranquilizers. The patients taking benzodiazepines had a statistically significantly increased risk of having an accident compared with controls, though this was not true when they were not taking the drugs.", 
    "59": "A number of studies have suggested the existence of multiple benzodiazepine binding sites in the brain. We have recently reported the physical separation of two apparent benzodiazepine binding site subtypes, the pharmacological properties, and distribution in tissue sections of which correspond to the putative type I and type II sites. Benzodiazepine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors have been shown to interact, and lesions of the GABAergic striatonigral pathway, which lead to GABA supersensitivity, both increase the numbers of GABA binding sites and enhance GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine binding. We demonstrate here that degeneration of striatonigral fibres increases the density of putative type I benzodiazepine binding sites in the substantia nigra and decreases the density of the putative type II sites. This suggests that type I sites that increase after denervation are postsynaptic, whereas the type II sites reduced by the lesion may be localized to axons or terminals of the striatonigral pathways.", 
    "60": "The effects of pirenzepine (Gastrozepin), a new anti-ulcer drug, on skeletal muscle contractility and on neuromuscular transmission have been examined in some experimental models in vitro and in vivo. Pirenzepine (5-500 micrograms/ml) inhibited agonist-(acetylcholine-, carbachol- or nicotine-) induced contractions of the toad isolated rectus abdominis muscle, and depressed electrically provoked twitches of the rat phrenic nerve-hemidiaphragm muscle preparation in vitro. Pirenzepine (5-25 mg/kg i.v.) also depressed indirect electrical stimulation-evoked twitches of the cat tibialis anterior and soleus muscle preparations in vivo. The neuromuscular blockade elicited by the anti-ulcer drug was not reversed by physostigmine, which reversed the depressant effects of d-tubocurarine on the electrically induced muscle twitches. Pirenzepine potentiated the depressant effects of d-tubocurarine on electrically evoked twitches of all skeletal muscles examined, and caused 'recurarisation' of partially curarised muscles. While the clinical significance of the neuromuscular blockade produced by the anti-ulcer agent is highlighted, it is concluded that the mechanism of skeletal muscle paralysing action of pirenzepine still remains speculative.", 
    "61": "The effects of intravenous injections of lorazepam, scopolamine and propranolol upon hippocampal potentiation produced by commissural stimulation have been investigated in rats anaesthetized with urethane. Administration of 250 micrograms/kg or 500 micrograms/kg lorazepam significantly delayed the onset of secondary potentiation (frequency potentiation) of the population spikes recorded in subfields CA1 and CA3 of the dorsal hippocampus. Scopolamine also delayed the onset of frequency potentiation in CA1, but only at high dose (10 mg/kg). No other measured parameters of frequency potentiation, paired-pulse potentiation or post-tetanic potentiation were affected by any of the drugs. Lorazepam (greater than or equal to 250 micrograms/kg) and propranolol (3 mg/kg) reduced the severity of hippocampal after-discharge. Rhythmic entrainment of after-discharges was occasionally observed. The results are discussed in relation to the possible link between hippocampal potentiation and memory processes.", 
    "62": "N-Acylated derivatives of 2-methyl-2-ethoxycarbonyl-4-phenyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepine (1) and 2-cyano-4-methyl-1H-tetrahydro-1,5-benzodiazepine (3-12) were obtained. From among compounds 3-12, compound 3 have shown a strong synergism with hexobarbital and antiserotonin and anticonvulsant activity, and compounds 5 and 7 have displayed antiserotonin properties. A strong antireserpine action, comparable with imipramine, has been found for compound 12, which also have antagonized electrogenic seizures.", 
    "63": "Liver tissue specific enzymes histidase and urokinase were found in blood of 160 rats after intraperitoneal administration of phenazepam at the doses of 1.0 and 2.5 mg/200 g of body weight as well as of diazepam at the dose of 2.0 mg/200 g. Administration of products of diazepam enzymatic degradation caused also the liberation of these enzymes from liver tissue into blood.", 
    "64": "PK 11195 [1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinec arboxamide] is a compound chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines with a high affinity for the \"peripheral type\" binding sites for benzodiazepines (Le Fur et al., 1983a). [3H]PK 11195 binds to the adrenal membranes with a high affinity (KD congruent to 3 nM) in a specific, reversible and GABA-independent manner. Binding is also characterized by very high Bmax (34 pmol/mg protein). These binding sites are the \"peripheral type\" benzodiazepine binding sites as demonstrated by the potency order of displacement of the [3H]PK 11195 bound: PK 11195 greater than R05-4864 greater than diazepam greater than dipyridamole greater than clonazepam. The biochemical characteristic of the binding to rat adrenal sections has also been studied. In these conditions the affinity for [3H]PK 11195 is ten times smaller, but the potency order of displacing agents was the same, demonstrating the identity of the section binding sites. Using tritium sensitive film these sites have been visualized in adrenal sections. [3H]PK 11195 binding sites are localized in the adrenal cortex with some spare labelling in the medulla.", 
    "65": "Spectral analysis techniques provide high resolution of the beta frequency range and, if a logarithmic transformation is used, also of lower level intensity. This is in contrast to the generally poor resolution of fast activity in the time domain, an effect which may be compared with that of a magnifying glass applied to beta activity. In the frequency domain several different types of beta activity may be distinguished, i.e., (1) narrow; (2) medium; (3) broad-band beta; (4) harmonic beta where the beta component shows a harmonic relationship to a lower frequency component; (5) complex beta as a mixture of 2 or more of the foregoing types; and (6) undefined beta, where the relative increase of beta power is the only assessable feature. If observed, significant coherence occurs most frequently between antero-posterior leads in activities of types 1 and 2, whereas coherence between hemispheres is generally low. Broad-band beta seems to be essentially non-coherent. Coherence of harmonic beta depends largely on the features of the underlying component. Bi-coherence analysis may be of help to further analysis of harmonic or complex beta activity.", 
    "66": "Abundance of beta activity in epileptic patients under clonazepam (Rivotril) treatment shows a significant correlation with the suppression of epileptic seizures and/or of epileptic EEG activity such as spikes and spike/wave complexes. In a longitudinal two-year study in 21 children with severe epilepsy treated with clonazepam, relative spectral peak power (RSPP) of beta activity was correlated with daily dose and serum concentration as well as with its effect on seizures and on epileptic EEG activity. Eight cases showed significant correlation of beta RSPP to daily dose, but only 4 to serum concentration. A significant (inverse) correlation was found between beta RSPP and the relative occurrence of epileptic EEG activity. Most illustrative were the individual follow-ups, with beta RSPP as an interesting additional parameter regarding the course of the epileptic condition. Quantitative measurement of beta activity by means of spectral analysis during long-term antiepileptic treatment promises important additional information on specific aspects in the individual case.", 
    "67": "The influence of diazepam treatment following prolonged ethanol administration was toxicologically examined in rhesus monkeys and rats. In the monkey, ethanol was intragastrically administered through a chronically implanted catheter by programmed infusions at doses of 1.5 g/kg 4 times daily every 6 hours over a period of 5 or 10 weeks and followed by intragastric administration of diazepam 4 mg/kg twice a day for 5 weeks. In the rat, ethanol was administered by gavage at doses of 8 g/kg once a day or 4 g/kg twice a day for 5 weeks after which diazepam 300 mg/kg was intragastrically administered once daily for 5 weeks. In the monkey, ethanol produced such toxic changes as hypertriglyceridaemia, fatty metamorphosis of the hepatocytes associated with megamitochondria, proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and vacuolation in the hepatocytes, and gastritis. Diazepam did not aggravate but mostly alleviated these changes. In the rat, on the contrary, the serum GPT level slightly elevated due to the ethanol administration, and remained at the elevated level with the diazepam treatment in contrast with the complete recovery with non-treatment for 5 weeks after the ethanol administration. However, such changes as increase of fat droplets in the hepatocytes and the triglyceride concentration in the liver which had been developed by ethanol administration recovered during the diazepam treatment period. In spite of the recovery, the elevation of the serum GPT level being remained by diazepam may indicate possible influence of diazepam on the liver function when the drug is administered after prolonged administration of ethanol.", 
    "68": "This study was designed to differentiate possible amnesic effects of diazepam, flunitrazepam and fentanyl into impairment of storage, retention or retrieval of information and to correlate them with alterations in a vigilance task. 4 groups of 7 volunteers each were studied in a double-blind, random fashion. They performed a quasi continuous word recognition task i.e. after a preload list of 150 words played on a tape they had to indicate if the following words (grouped into 10 blocks of 100 words each) were new ones or had occurred already. Interposed were measurements of reaction time to a visual stimulus, and of concentration and short-time memory. During the experiment, unknown to the test person, diazepam 10 mg/70 kg, flunitrazepam 1 mg/70 kg, fentanyl 0.15 mg/70 kg or placebo were infused over 3 min. For evaluation of the word recognition task the d' index drawn from signal detection theory was employed. The results clearly indicated that both benzodiazepines specifically impair memory function the effect of flunitrazepam being more pronounced and longer in duration. Since retrieval of information learnt before administration of either drug was completely unaffected it was concluded that both drugs specifically influence encoding and registration of information. Reaction times were not significantly altered after diazepam, whereas they were prolonged by more than 50% after flunitrazepam indicating a pronounced sedative action of this drug. However, even during this period of maximal effect of flunitrazepam, recognition of words first presented prior to injection was not impaired.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "We used diazepam, a mild mitotic arrestant, as a model chemical to develop a cytogenetic assay protocol for aneuploid induction in a diploid Chinese hamster cell system. At 100 micrograms/ml, diazepam almost completely arrested mitosis at metaphase. However, mitotic block could be quickly reversed when diazepam was removed from the medium. When the duration of arrest was relatively short (2 h), anaphases in the recovering cell population were essentially normal; but when the arresting period was prolonged (7 h), anaphases in the recovering cell populations exhibited a high rate of multipolar spindles and lagging chromosomes. Filial cell populations (18-24 h after removal of the drug) showed a high frequency of aneuploid elements. Mitotic cells shaken off from monolayer cultures as starting cell populations for enumeration of aneuploidy proved to be superior to non-shaken-off cell populations.", 
    "70": "The use of a commercially available cell harvester in radioreceptor binding assays is described. Scatchard analyses of data acquired using the cell harvester is presented for [3H]clonidine, [3H]prazosin, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), and [3H]flunitrazepam. Dissociation constants (Kd) and maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) obtained for each ligand are in good agreement with those published by others and there is excellent intra- and interassay agreement. Apparent inhibition constants for various common drugs are also included. Analyses of precision, efficiency, and cost support the use of this cell harvester in binding assays.", 
    "71": "A number of clinically effective muscle relaxants and structurally related compounds were examined in three animal models of muscle relaxant activity in order to determine the utility of these models in predicting clinical activity. The methods used were attenuation of morphine-induced rigidity in rats, decerebrate rigidity in cats, and the polysynaptic linguomandibular reflex in cats. Specificity of the compounds was assessed by comparing these data to the ability of the compounds to induce rotarod failure in rats and to inhibit the monosynaptic patellar reflex in cats. Diazepam and chlordiazepoxide were of limited potency in morphine-induced rigidity and decerebrate rigidity, but were potent on the polysynaptic reflex. Mephenesin, cyclobenzaprine, and the newer benzodiazepine, midazolam, were effective and moderately specific in all three models. Baclofen and dantrolene were effective but were of little or no specificity in all models. Analysis of the data yielded poor correlation between clinical muscle relaxant potency and the potencies obtained in these animal models. The correlation coefficients of 0.54, 0.50, and 0.70 for the linguomandibular reflex, decerebrate rigidity, and morphine rigidity, respectively, were not statistically significant, in contrast with a coefficient of 1.0 using previously reported data on these compounds in inhibiting morphine-induced Straub tail in mice. Thus, the three models used in this study may possess utility in the study of sites and mechanisms of action and structure-activity relationships of potential muscle relaxants, but they do not appear to be as useful as morphine-induced Straub tail in potency comparisons between different chemical classes.", 
    "72": "It has been shown in experiments on white rats that administration of diazepam in a dose of 5 mg/kg reduces the emotional stress and activation of noradrenergic terminals during reproduction of conditioned avoidance responses. The role of the central noradrenergic system in the emotional stress control is discussed.", 
    "73": "By using operant conditioning techniques one group of 8 rats was trained to reach through a hole in the wall of an operant chamber, and to exert downward responses on a force-sensing circular disk. Eight other rats learned to reach through the hole and grasp and pull toward them a wire bail attached to a force transducer. Both behaviors were maintained on a fixed ratio 20 schedule of water reinforcement. The effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg) on response force and rate were assessed for both groups. CDP significantly increased response force in a dose-related manner in both groups; regardless of topography, response rate was little affected by the 2.5- and 5.0 mg/kg doses but was decreased by the highest dose. Results were discussed in terms of CDP's antipunishment and neuromuscular effects.", 
    "74": "A stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) assay for oxazepam in capsules and tablets was developed. The material was extracted with 2% aqueous methanol and chromatographed on a C18 reverse-phase column, which was eluted with methanol-water-acetic acid (60:40:1). A wavelength of 254 was used for detection. This assay separated oxazepam from all degradation products mentioned in the literature or observed in stress-degraded samples. Degradation products could be detected at the 0.1% level. Degradation of oxazepam to 6-chloro-4-phenyl-2-quinazolinecarboxaldehyde and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone was observed after either acid or base treatment. Acidic conditions also afforded 2'-benzoyl-4'-chloroglyoxanilide and 6-chloro-4-phenyl-2(1H)-quinazolinone.", 
    "75": "The presentations and treatment of anxiety as 1) a reaction to catastrophic illness, 2) an intrinsic symptom of a physical disorder, and 3) part of a chronic disease are reviewed. Educative and supportive psychotherapy in group settings is recommended, accompanied when indicated by the judicious short-term use of antidepressants or antianxiety agents such as the benzodiazepines or the new nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytics.", 
    "76": "In a prospective, double-blind placebo controlled trial, the effect of oral diazepam premedication on post-succinylcholine fasciculations and myalgia was studied. Forty patients undergoing septoplasty procedures received orally identical capsules containing either 10 mg of diazepam or a placebo 90 minutes preoperatively. A standardized anaesthetic regimen included induction with 5 mg X kg-1 of thiopental and 1 mg X kg-1 of succinylcholine. The diazepam and control groups did not differ significantly in extent of fasciculations or ease of intubation. However, only 15 per cent of the diazepam premedicated patients had myalgias postoperatively compared to 50 per cent of the control patients, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.04)."
