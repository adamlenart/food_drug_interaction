Since its discovery, the rate of diagnosis of new cases has increased rapidly and several epidemiological studies now confirm that NMDA-R encephalitis may be as common as many other prominent infectious etiologies of encephalitis. We describe a case of a young woman presenting initially with psychotic and mood symptoms who was found to have anti-NMDA-R encephalitis. We further provide details of her treatment and prolonged recovery process after hospital discharge with a review of the literature and discussion of the epidemiology, symptomology, diagnosis, and management of both the neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of this condition. Last, we contextualize the importance of anti-NMDA-R encephalitis for psychiatrists, highlighting the role for psychiatrists in establishing the initial diagnosis as well as in providing ongoing psychiatric care.", 
    "1": "This study characterizes drug-related deaths according to ethnicity in Utah during 2005-2010, based on data from the Utah Violent Death Reporting System (UTVDRS). Hispanics made up 12.1% (12.5% male and 11.7% female) of deaths. The most frequently identified drugs among decedents were opiates, then illicit drugs, benzodiazepines, over-the-counter medication, and antidepressants. Death rates for each drug were significantly greater in non-Hispanics than Hispanics. Most decedents used a combination of drugs. For each combination, rates were significantly greater for non-Hispanics than Hispanics, with an exception for opiates and illicit drugs combined, where there was no significant difference. Approximately 79% of non-Hispanics and 65% of Hispanics had one or more of the selected problems (e.g., mental, physical, or crisis related). Rates for each combination of problems were significantly greater in non-Hispanics, with the exception of crisis. Hispanics were less affected by the rise in prescription drug abuse. Hispanic decedents had a greater proportion of illegal drugs, consistent with it being more difficult to obtain prescription drugs. Hispanic decedents were less likely to have physical and mental health problems, which may be related to a smaller chance of diagnosis of such problems through the healthcare system.",

    "6": "Antihistamines (AH) have been classified into first and second generation according to their pharmacokinetic properties, structural characteristics and adverse effects. The effects on the central nervous system (CNS) are determined basically by their capacity to cross the hematoencephalic barrier and attach to central H1 receptors. Benzodiazepines (BZD) are drugs with effects on the CNS following their union to the specific location of GABA receptors type A. At low doses, the BZD have sedative and anticonvulsive effects, and as the dose increases it leads to sedation, amnesia and finally unconsciousness. Various studies have been made on the possible interaction between the BZD and the AH H1 with special attention to their effect on the CNS. In some cases these were studies to assess the safety of this association and in others, the aim was different: to see if their joint administration gives a better therapeutic result in pathology related with anxiety syndrome or insomnia. In general it can be said that first generation AH interact with the BZD increasing the sedative effects of the latter. However, second generation AH do not increase these sedative effects, which makes them the chosen drugs to treat allergic rhinitis/rhino-conjunctivitis and urticaria in patients also receiving BZD.", 
    "7": "Clonazepam as an addictive drug is studied to elucidate its destructive effects on rats' immune system. The aim of the current work was to study the immunologic changes induced by sub-chronic administration of clonazepam for three weeks followed by a withdrawal period in adult male albino rats. Seventy-two Sprague Dawley rats were divided into three equal groups. The first group was used as control; the second and third groups were treated with clonazepam. Six rats from each group were sacrificed weekly. Data showed that clonazepam induced a significant suppression in the level of IFN-gamma cortisol production, total splenocytes count and lymphocytes transformation induced by PHA mitogen along the experimental period especially in the third group. However, subchronic doses of clonazepam increased the production of IL-10 in both treated groups. Moreover, significant DNA damage in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of both treated groups was observed along the duration of the study. In conclusion, the immune system responses can be adversely affected to a greater extent by sub-chronic administration of clonazepam and should be prescribed cautiously as patients may turn addict to it.",

This adds a thermodynamic dimension to previously reported geometric analysis in the erythrocyte model. LDC decreased the enthalpy and temperature for dpPC pre- and main-transitions (\u0394Hp, \u0394Hm, Tp, Tm) and decreased the cooperativity of the main-transition (\u0394T(1/2,m)). FNZ decreased \u0394Hm and, at least up to 59 \u03bcM, also decreased \u0394Hp. In conjunction with LDC, FNZ induced a recovery of \u2206T(1/2,m) control values and increased \u0394Hm even above the control level. The deconvolution of the main-transition peak at high LDC concentrations revealed three components possibly represented by: a self-segregated fraction of pure dpPC, a dpPC-LDC mixture and a phase with a lipid structure of intermediate stability associated with LDC self-aggregation within the lipid phase. Some LDC effects on thermodynamic parameters were reverted at proper LDC/FNZ molar ratios, suggesting that FNZ restricts the maximal availability of the LDC partitioned into the lipid phase. Thus, beyond its complexity, the lipid-LDC mixture can be rationalized as an equilibrium of coexisting phases which gains homogeneity in the presence of FNZ. This work stresses the relevance of nonspecific drug-membrane binding on LDC-FNZ pharmacological interactions and would have pharmaceutical applications in liposomal multidrug-delivery.",

    "38": "Although a large number of studies have been devoted to establishing correlations between changes in amplitude and frequency of EEG alpha oscillations and cognitive processes, it is currently unclear through which physiological mechanisms such changes are brought about. In this study we use a biophysical model of EEG generation to gain a fundamental understanding of the functional changes within the thalamo-cortical system that might underly such alpha responses. The main result of this study is that, although the physiology of the thalamo-cortical system is characterized by a large number of parameters, alpha responses effectively depend on only three variables. Physiologically, these variables determine the resonance properties of feedforward, cortico-thalamo-cortical, and intra-cortical circuits. By examining the effect of modulations of these resonances on the amplitude and frequency of EEG alpha oscillations, it is established that the model can reproduce the variety of experimentally observed alpha responses, as well as the experimental finding that changes in alpha amplitude are typically an order of magnitude larger than changes in alpha frequency. The modeling results are also in line with the fact that alpha responses often correlate linearly with indices characterizing cognitive processes. By investigating the effect of synaptic and intrinsic neuronal parameters, we find that alpha responses reflect changes in cortical activation, which is consistent with the hypothesis that alpha activity serves to selectively inhibit cortical regions during cognitive processing demands. As an example of how these analyses can be applied to specific experimental protocols, we reproduce benzodiazepine-induced alpha responses and clarify the putative underlying thalamo-cortical mechanisms. The findings reported in this study provide a fundamental physiological framework within which alpha responses observed in specific experimental protocols can be understood.", 
    "39": "The activation of adenosine A(2B) receptors in human mast cells causes pro-inflammatory responses such as the secretion of interleukin-8. There is evidence for an inhibitory effect of benzodiazepines on mast cell mediated symptoms in patients with systemic mast cell activation disease. Therefore, we investigated the effects of benzodiazepines on adenosine A(2B) receptor mediated interleukin-8 production in human mast cell leukaemia (HMC1) cells by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The adenosine analogue N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, 0.3-3 \u03bcM) increased interleukin-8 production about 5-fold above baseline. This effect was attenuated by the adenosine A(2B) receptor antagonist MRS1754 (N-(4-cyanophenyl)-2-{4-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purin-8-yl)phenoxy}-acetamide) 1 \u03bcM. In addition, diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam and flunitrazepam (1-30 \u03bcM) markedly reduced NECA-induced interleukin-8 production in that order of potency, whereas clonazepam showed only a modest inhibition. The inhibitory effect of diazepam was not altered by flumazenil 10 \u03bcM or PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide) 10 \u03bcM. Diazepam attenuated the NECA-induced expression of mRNA encoding for interleukin-8. Moreover, diazepam and flunitrazepam reduced the increasing effects of NECA on cAMP-response element- and nuclear factor of activated t-cells-driven luciferase reporter gene activities in HMC1 cells. Neither diazepam nor flunitrazepam affected NECA-induced increases in cellular cAMP levels in CHO Flp-In cells stably expressing recombinant human adenosine A(2B) receptors, excluding a direct action of benzodiazepines on human adenosine A(2B) receptors. In conclusion, this is the first study showing an inhibitory action of benzodiazepines on adenosine A(2B) receptor mediated interleukin-8 production in human mast (HMC1) cells. The rank order of potency indicates the involvement of an atypical benzodiazepine binding site.",

All sociodemographic variables, the deprivation score, the number of previous abortions and miscarriages, and poor prenatal monitoring were significantly different for the mothers using four products or more. The uses changed along the years of study: fewer mothers used heroin but more used hashish, combined with other substances. The medical care also changed: greater participation on the part of mothers in neonatal care, more frequent breastfeeding, less medication for neonatal abstinence syndrome with the same severity score: i.e., 45.5% of infants with a Lipsitz score between 8 and 12 received a morphine treatment in 1999-2000 versus only 5.5% in 2005-2006 and none in 2007-2008. The mean gestational age was 38.1weeks. Preterm births (22.2%) and intrauterine growth restriction (18% with birth weight <10th percentile) were mainly correlated with the number of substances at delivery (17.3% preterm if three substances or less and 31.3% if four substances or more; p<0.001), social deprivation, poor prenatal care, and mothers having gained less than 5kg in weight during pregnancy (57.1% of intrauterine growth restriction versus 14.5%). Birth weight, height, and head circumference were significantly different for mothers having drunken alcohol. Among the newborns, seven showed complete fetal alcohol syndrome. The neonatal abstinence syndrome severity (23% with a Lipsitz score>9, one-quarter of whom were medicated with morphine) was correlated with an in-utero exposure to opiates, mainly in combination with benzodiazepines, and with the use of four or more substances. The mean age of infants at discharge was 18.1days (SD 3.39): 21.1% stayed 30 days or more in the hospital, mainly because of prematurity or intrauterine growth restriction, a high neonatal abstinence syndrome score, maternal polydrug use, psychosocial deprivation, or foster care placement decisions.

There are five major DIH syndromes: (1) neuroleptic malignant syndrome, (2) serotonin syndrome, (3) anticholinergic poisoning, (4) sympathomimetic poisoning, and (5) malignant hyperthermia. The differential diagnosis of DIH syndromes can be challenging because symptoms are generally nonspecific, ranging from blood pressure changes and excessive sweating to altered mental status, muscle rigidity, convulsions, and metabolic acidosis. Evidence from the professional literature (per a MEDLINE search for articles published through November 2011) indicates that few currently available treatment options can reduce the duration of hyperthermia; therefore, prompt identification of the provoking agent based on the patient's medication history, the clinical presentation, and the timing of symptom onset is essential to determine the appropriate treatment and mitigate potentially life-threatening sequelae. For all DIH syndromes, appropriate management includes the immediate discontinuation of the suspected offending agent(s) and supportive care (external cooling, volume resuscitation as needed); in some cases, pharmacologic therapy (e.g., a benzodiazepine, bromocriptine, dantrolene) may be appropriate, with the selection of a specific agent primarily determined by the medication history and suspected DIH syndrome.",

In the present study we investigated the effects of PWZ-029 administration in novel object recognition test and Morris water maze, in normal and scopolamine-treated rats. All the three doses of PWZ-029 (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg) improved object recognition after the 24-h delay period, as shown by significant differences between the exploration times of the novel and old object, and the respective discrimination indices.

The present Morris water maze study in adult male Wistar rats was performed in three experiments in which midazolam was administered at doses of 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg intraperitoneally, before or immediately after each of five daily learning sessions, with two trials in a session, as well as before the probe test. Midazolam impaired acquisition and subsequent retention of spatial learning of the position of the hidden platform even at a pre-training dose of 0.5 mg/kg. This low dose was not associated with impairment of the procedural component of learning, manifested by increased time spent in the periphery of the pool. The lack of midazolam effect on consolidation has not been confounded by the observed below-chance performance of the control group since our additional experiment using diazepam also administered immediately after each of five learning sessions has revealed a similar pattern of results. Finally, midazolam administered before the probe test impaired retrieval of reference memory at all tested doses. Hence, induction of retrograde, besides anterograde amnesia should be kept in mind as a possibility when midazolam is used in clinical settings.",

A unique common neural action of different classes of anxiolytic drugs may provide such a biomarker. In rodents, a reduction in low frequency (4-12 Hz; \"theta\") brain rhythmicity is produced by all anxiolytics (even those lacking panicolytic or antidepressant action) and not by any non-anxiolytics. This rhythmicity is a key property of the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS) postulated to be one neural substrate of anxiety.

Results on specific driving outcome domains revealed that the oxazepam condition had significantly slower braking reaction time compared to the placebo condition (p =.002) and the kava condition (p =.003). The kava condition had significantly fewer lapses of concentration compared to the oxazepam condition (p =.033). No significant differences were found between conditions for steering deviation, speed deviation, and number of crashes. Results were not modified by driving experience. On the Bond-Lader visual analogue sub-scale of alertness, a significant Treatment \u00d7 Time interaction (p =.032) was found, with a significant reduction over time for oxazepam decreasing alertness (p <.001), whereas no significant reduction was found in the kava or placebo conditions.",

    "69": "The flavonoid myricetin is found in several sedative herbs, for example, the St. John's Wort, but its influence on sedation and its possible mechanism of action are unknown. Using patch-clamp technique on a brain slice preparation, the present study found that myricetin promoted GABAergic activity in the neurons of hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) by increasing the decay time and frequency of the inhibitory currents mediated by GABA(A) receptor. This effect of myricetin was not blocked by the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine- (BZ-) binding site antagonist flumazenil, but by KN-62, a specific inhibitor of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-stimulated protein kinase II (CaMK-II). Patch clamp and live Ca(2+) imaging studies found that myricetin could increase Ca(2+) current and intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, respectively, via T- and L-type Ca(2+) channels in rat PVN neurons and hypothalamic primary culture neurons. Immunofluorescence staining showed increased phosphorylation of CaMK-II after myricetin incubation in primary culture of rat hypothalamic neurons, and the myricetin-induced CaMK-II phosphorylation was further confirmed by Western blotting in PC-12 cells. The present results suggest that myricetin enhances GABA(A) receptor activity via calcium channel/CaMK-II dependent mechanism, which is distinctively different from that of most existing BZ-binding site agonists of GABA(A) receptor.",

    "82": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine anxiolytic widely prescribed for treatment of panic-disorder and social phobias, although this medication is also subject to abuse. In this paper, the concentrations of alprazolam in venous blood samples from impaired drivers were compared with femoral blood samples from forensic autopsies classified as intoxication or other causes of death (e.g. natural, trauma). After liquid-liquid extraction (n-butyl acetate) alprazolam was determined in blood by capillary gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorous detector. The mean (median) and range of alprazolam concentrations in blood from impaired drivers (n = 773) were 0.08 mg/L (0.05 mg/L) and 0.02-3.9 mg/L, respectively. Many traffic offenders had co-ingested ethanol (13%), amphetamine (46%), cannabis (32%), or heroin (14%), as well as other drugs. In deaths attributed to drug intoxication, the mean (median) and range of alprazolam concentrations in blood (n = 438) were 0.10 mg/L (0.06 mg/L) and 0.02-1.6 mg/L, respectively, which were not much different from other causes of death (n = 278); 0.08 mg/L (0.05 mg/L) and 0.02-0.9 mg/L. Median concentrations of alprazolam in blood from living and deceased persons did not seem to depend on the number of co-ingested substances. The result of this pharmacoepidemiological study suggests that alprazolam is a fairly innocent drug when used as monotherapy, but toxicity problems arise when co-ingested with illicit drugs and/or psychoactive medication.",

Six healthy dogs were administered 0.2 mg/kg midazolam IV, IM, or PR in a randomized, 3-way crossover design with a 3-day washout between study periods. Blood samples were collected at baseline and at predetermined intervals until 480 min after administration. Plasma midazolam concentrations were measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography with UV detection. Rectal administration resulted in erratic systemic availability with undetectable to low plasma concentrations. Arithmetic mean values \u00b1 SD for midazolam peak plasma concentrations were 0.86 \u00b1 0.36 \u03bcg/mL (C0) and 0.20 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcg/mL (Cmax), following IV and IM administration, respectively. Time to peak concentration (Tmax ) after IM administration was 7.8 \u00b1 2.4 min with a bioavailability of 50 \u00b1 16%. Findings suggest that IM midazolam might be useful in treating seizures in dogs when venous access is unavailable, but higher doses may be needed to account for intermediate bioavailability.

This overview evaluates the current role of clonazepam alone or in combination with antidepressants and/or behavioral therapy in the treatment of PD. We review the data establishing the use of clonazepam in the treatment of PD as well as new information, particularly confirmation of longterm efficacy and safety. We also discuss a regimen for safely tapered withdrawal of clonazepam, the characteristics of the respiratory subtype of PD, and CO2-induced panic attacks as a diagnostic measure and predictor for therapeutic success. It has been shown that panic attacks can more readily be induced by CO2 in PD patients with the respiratory subtype than those with the non-respiratory subtype. More than 25 years after the first report of efficacy in PD in 1984, clonazepam, alone or combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and/or behavioral therapy, remains an important therapeutic modality for the management of PD.",

    "87": "The therapeutic potential of pharmacologic inhibition of bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins has recently emerged in hematological malignancies and chronic inflammation. We find that BET inhibitor compounds (JQ1, I-Bet, I-Bet151 and MS417) reactivate HIV from latency. This is evident in polyclonal Jurkat cell populations containing latent infectious HIV, as well as in a primary T-cell model of HIV latency. Importantly, we show that this activation is dependent on the positive transcription elongation factor p-TEFb but independent from the viral Tat protein, arguing against the possibility that removal of the BET protein BRD4, which functions as a cellular competitor for Tat, serves as a primary mechanism for BET inhibitor action. Instead, we find that the related BET protein, BRD2, enforces HIV latency in the absence of Tat, pointing to a new target for BET inhibitor treatment in HIV infection. In shRNA-mediated knockdown experiments, knockdown of BRD2 activates HIV transcription to the same extent as JQ1 treatment, while a lesser effect is observed with BRD4. In single-cell time-lapse fluorescence microscopy, quantitative analyses across ~2,000 viral integration sites confirm the Tat-independent effect of JQ1 and point to positive effects of JQ1 on transcription elongation, while delaying re-initiation of the polymerase complex at the viral promoter. Collectively, our results identify BRD2 as a new Tat-independent suppressor of HIV transcription in latently infected cells and underscore the therapeutic potential of BET inhibitors in the reversal of HIV latency.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that duodenal lipid sensing activates a gut-brain-brown adipose tissue neuraxis to regulate thermogenesis. We demonstrate that direct administration of lipids into the duodenum increases brown fat temperature. Co-infusion of the local anesthetic tetracaine with duodenal lipids abolished the lipid-induced increase in brown fat temperature. Systemic administration of the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide blocked the ability of duodenal lipids to increase brown fat thermogenesis. Parenchymal administration of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blocker MK-801 directly into the caudomedial nucleus of the solitary tract also abolished duodenal lipid-induced activation of brown fat thermogenesis. These findings establish that duodenal lipid sensing activates a gut-brain-brown fat axis to determine brown fat temperature, and thereby reveal a previously unappreciated pathway that regulates thermogenesis.",

Procyanidin B5 was a considerably stronger CYP3A4 inhibitor in vitro than the isomeric procyanidin B2 and comparable to bergamottin, a known CYP3A4 inhibitor from grapefruit juice. The inhibitory activity of proanthocyanidin-containing fractions was correlated to the degree of polymerization. Among the anthocyanins, cyanidin 3-arabinoside showed stronger CYP3A4 inhibition than cyanidin 3-galactoside and cyanidin 3-glucoside.

Alterations in gene expression followed four distinct concentration-dependent patterns: (1) concentration response (e.g. estrogen receptor alpha), (2) inverse-concentration response (e.g. insulin receptor beta), U-shaped (e.g. mineralocorticoid receptor), (3) inverse U-shaped (e.g. benzodiazepine receptor), and (4) concentration-independent responses (e.g. ubiquitin). Temporal trends included: (1) peak gene expression at one of the sewage exposure timepoints with recovery to baseline levels after the depuration phase (e.g. vitelline envelope protein beta), (2) gene expression alterations that did not recover (e.g. glucose transporter 3), and (3) delayed gene expression alterations initiated only at the recovery timepoint (e.g. insulin-like growth factor 2). In summary, patterns in gene expression changes were found across sewage concentrations and exposure timepoints. This study is the first to show gene expression trends of this nature.", 
    "122": "Experimental preconditioning provides beneficial outcomes in conditions such as cardiac surgery, brain surgery and stroke. Here we evaluated the protective effects of low-dose subcutaneous GYKI-52466 preconditioning in a rat model of hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) brain injury. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (postnatal day 26) were administered saline or GYKI-52466 (GYKI; 3-mg/kg, 90 min; 1-mg/kg, twice in 120 min; or 0.5-mg/kg, thrice in 180 min) prior to left common carotid artery occlusion. Animals were allowed to recover for 2h, and then placed in a hypoxia chamber (8% O\u2082/92% N\u2082; 33 \u00b1 1\u00b0C) for 1h. A sham surgery group received saline without HI. Seizure activity was scored during hypoxia and sensorimotor tests performed before surgery and at 1, 7, 14 and 90 days post-HI. On days 14 and 90 brains were fixed and sectioned for the assessment of infarct size and ventricular enlargement. Low-dose GYKI-52466 preconditioning significantly reduced infarct volume and ventricular enlargement relative to saline-treated controls at day 14 after HI. On day 90, tissue loss was significantly reduced by GYKI 3-mg/kg compared to saline. Foot-faults, paw use asymmetry, and postural reflex scores were significantly improved in all GYKI treatment groups. Our results show that GYKI-52466 is effective at doses well-below, and at pre-administration intervals well-beyond previous studies, and suggest that a classical blockade of ionotropic AMPA receptors does not underlie its neuroprotective effects. Low-dose GYKI-52466 preconditioning represents a novel, prophylactic strategy for neuroprotection in a field almost devoid of effective pharmaceuticals.", 
    "123": "Large, \"practical\" or streamlined trials (LSTs) are used to study the effectiveness and/or safety of medicines in real world settings with minimal study imposed interventions. While LSTs have benefits over traditional randomized clinical trials and observational studies, there are inherent challenges to their conduct. Enrollment and follow-up of a large study sample of patients with mental illness pose a particular difficulty. To assist in overcoming operational barriers in future LSTs in psychiatry, this paper describes the recruitment and observational follow-up strategies used for the ZODIAC study, an international, open-label LST, which followed 18,239 persons randomly assigned to one of two treatments indicated for schizophrenia for 1 year. ZODIAC enrolled patients in 18 countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia using broad study entry criteria and required minimal clinical care intervention. Recruitment of adequate numbers and continued engagement of both study centers and subjects were significant challenges. Strategies implemented to mitigate these in ZODIAC include global study expansion, study branding, field coordinator and site relations programs, monthly site newsletters, collection of alternate contact information, conduct of national death index (NDI) searches, and frequent sponsor, contract research organization (CRO) and site interaction to share best practices and address recruitment challenges quickly. We conclude that conduct of large LSTs in psychiatric patient populations is feasible, but importantly, realistic site recruitment goals and maintaining site engagement are key factors that need to be considered in early study planning and conduct.", 
    "124": "We previously reported that a \u03b4 opioid receptor agonist SNC80 produced potent anxiolytic-like effects in rodents. Recently, we succeeded in synthesizing a novel \u03b4 opioid receptor agonist KNT-127. In this study, we investigated the anxiolytic-like effects of KNT-127 using three different rat models of innate anxiety. In an elevated plus-maze test, KNT-127 (0.3, 1, and 3.0\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) significantly and dose-dependently increased the time rats spent in the open arms 30\u00a0min after administration. The magnitude of the KNT-127 (3.0\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.)-induced anxiolytic-like effects was similar to that produced by diazepam (1.0\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.), a benzodiazepine anxiolytic. The anxiolytic-like effects of KNT-127 (3.0\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) were abolished by pretreatment with naltrindole (0.1\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.), a selective \u03b4 opioid receptor antagonist, suggesting that KNT-127-induced anxiolytic-like effects are mediated by \u03b4 opioid receptors. These findings were supported by results obtained from light/dark and open-field tests. Interestingly, in contrast to diazepam (1.0\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.), KNT-127 (3.0\u00a0mg/kg, s.c.) caused no significant performance changes in the Y-maze test, the ethanol-induced sleeping test, and footprint test. This is the first study to demonstrate that the novel \u03b4 opioid receptor agonist KNT-127 produces distinct anxiolytic-like effects in rats, without producing the adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines.",

The validation parameters included limits of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ), linearity, accuracy and precision, selectivity, recovery, matrix effects and process efficiency. To investigate the variables associated with collection of oral fluid, drug stability and drug recovery in/from the collection device were also determined. The LOD ranged from 0.01 ng/ml to 0.5 ng/ml and the LOQ ranged from 0.1 ng/ml to 0.5 ng/ml.

Apart from the antidepressant effect, it has also the sedative and anxiolytic effect, so it is used in the treatment of anxiety disorder in the course of psychosis, organic diseases and alcoholism. Doxepin increases concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain by preventing inactivation and blocking their reuptake. In addition, the drug has an antagonistic effect on receptors in CNS (muscarinic M1, histamine H1, alpha-1adrenergic, serotonergic 5-HT2) and also blocks sodium and potassium channels in cardiomyocytes. In this paper we present a case of severe poisoning by various drugs, including doxepin. The dominating symptom was prolonged toxic coma. Slow return of consciousness was observed from the fifth day after intoxication, logical verbal contact with the patient was possible on the seventh day. It seems that this symptom results from the pharmacokinetic properties of doxepin as well as the high drug dose and a synergistic effect of lorazepam and phenobarbital. Transient anisokoria was an unusual symptom that appeared in the course of intoxication. The patient was examined by a neurologist and underwent CT of the head twice - no organic causes were revealed. This phenomenon can be explained by physiological anisokoria, caused by asymmetry in the sympathetic innervation of pupil rectractor muscle, exacerbated by a complete parasympathetic conduction block as a result of anticholinergic action of doxepin. Tricyclic antidepressants are often used by patients for the purpose of suicide. Because of the serious cardiological and neurological symptoms the course of doxepin intoxication may be severe.",

    "149": "Benzodiazepines have been used for decades as first-line treatment for status epilepticus (SE). For reasons that are not fully understood, the efficacy of benzodiazepines decreases with increasing duration of seizure activity. This often forces clinicians to resort to more drastic second- and third-line treatments that are not always successful. The antiseizure properties of benzodiazepines are mediated by \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A) ) receptors. Decades of research have focused on the failure of GABAergic inhibition after seizure onset as the likely cause of the development benzodiazepine resistance during SE. However, the details of the deficits in GABA(A) signaling are still largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of benzodiazepine resistance so that more effective strategies can be formulated. In this review we discuss evidence supporting the role of altered GABA(A) receptor function as the major underlying cause of benzodiazepine-resistant SE in both humans and animal models. We specifically address the prevailing hypothesis, which is based on changes in the number and subtypes of GABA(A) receptors, as well as the potential influence of perturbed chloride homeostasis in the mature brain.",

    "177": "Previously, we have reported that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist-benzodiazepine veterinary anesthetic combination, zoletil, produced reward and reinforcement, but only in rats repeatedly pretreated with the drug and not in drug-na\u00efve rats. Therefore, we hypothesized that previous drug exposure plays an important role in the abuse of zoletil. In the present study, we examined whether pre-exposure to related substances, NMDA receptor antagonists (tiletamine, ketamine), and benzodiazepines (zolazepam, diazepam) predisposes animals to abuse zoletil. We examined whether animals repeatedly pretreated with tiletamine, ketamine, zolazepam, or diazepam, for 14 days, would show locomotor activation, place preference, and self-administration in response to zoletil. Place preference was observed in groups pretreated with either an NMDA receptor antagonist (ketamine) or a benzodiazepine (diazepam). However, locomotor activation and self-administration were only observed in rats pretreated with NMDA receptor antagonists (tiletamine and ketamine). These results show that pre-exposure to related substances might have induced neurobiological changes that consequently led to the expression of the rewarding and reinforcing effects of zoletil. This provides evidence that zoletil may be used as a substitute drug by abusers of NMDA receptor antagonists or benzodiazepines.", 
    "178": "Myoclonic seizures are sudden, brief, shock-like contractions that can vary in distribution and intensity. They may be present in different epilepsy syndromes, including some idiopathic generalized epilepsy, epileptic encephalopathies and progressive myoclonus epilepsies. Despite the fact that there are many studies about the pathophysiology of myoclonic seizures and clear descriptions of the different myoclonic epilepsy syndromes, relatively little has been written on treatment. Valproate and some benzodiazepines are widely used to treat myoclonic seizures. In addition, more treatment options exist today as there is emerging evidence to support the efficacy of some newer antiepileptic drugs. On the other hand, some myoclonic epilepsies remain refractory to drug treatment and some antiepileptic drugs may exacerbate or even induce myoclonus. In the coming years, better understanding of mechanisms of myoclonic seizures and myoclonic epilepsies could result in great improvement of therapy and the quality of life of patients.",

BZD dosage was reduced every 2-4 weeks by 25% of the initial dose with the optional support of Hydroxyzine or Valerian. The rating measurements were: reduction of BZD prescription, demographic variables, the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) to measure quality of life, the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Sleep Scale, and the Goldberg Depression and Anxiety Scale.By the end of the six-month intervention, 80.4% of the patients had discontinued BZD and 64% maintained abstinence at one year. An improvement in all parameters of the Goldberg scale (p <0.05) and in the mental component of SF-12 at 3.3 points (p = 0.024), as well as in most components of the MOS scale, was observed in the group that had discontinued BZD.

Weight gain has been inconsistent in these studies though, possibly related to the rapid metabolism of antipsychotics in rodents. This study investigates olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic with high liability for weight gain in humans, administered to rats by continuous infusion via osmotic minipump versus daily subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections. We examined body weight, food intake and body composition for olanzapine (7.5mg/kg/day) versus placebo (n=8/group) in female Sprague-Dawley rats using the 3 routes of administration over 14 days. For olanzapine treated animals, weight gain was significantly greater in the minipump sample compared to both s.c. and i.p. injections. Twice as many animals (i.e. 75%) gained \u2265 7% body weight compared to either daily s.c. or i.p. injections. Olanzapine treated animals consumed more kilocalories than vehicle, and the minipump group consumed more than either daily injection group, although the difference with the s.c. sample was nonsignificant. Significantly more visceral fat was amassed in olanzapine treated animals versus vehicle, again greatest in the minipump sample, although differences between groups did not reach significance. The magnitude of increase across all groups fits with other evidence suggesting change in body composition may represent a more sensitive measure than body weight in assessing antipsychotic related changes. We conclude that the rodent model is tenable in evaluating the effects of antipsychotics on weight/body composition.",

    "196": "The balance between glutamate- and GABA-mediated neurotransmission in the brain is fundamental in the nervous system, but it is regulated by the \"tonic\" release of a variety of endogenous factors. One such important group of molecules are the neurosteroids (NSs) which, similarly to benzodiazepines (BDZs), enhance GABAergic neurotransmission. The purpose of our work was to investigate, at in vivo physiologically relevant concentrations, the effects of NSs and BDZs as GABA modulators on dissociated neocortical neuron networks grown in long-term culture. We used a multi-electrode array (MEA) recording technique and a novel analysis that was able to both identify the action potentials of engaged excitatory and inhibitory neurons and to detect drug-induced network up-states (burst). We found that the NSs tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) and allopregnanolone (ALLO) applied at low nanomolar concentrations, produced different modulatory effects on the two neuronal clusters. Conversely, at high concentrations (1 \u03bcM), both NSs, decreased excitatory and inhibitory neuron cluster excitability; however, even several hours after wash-out, the excitability of inhibitory neurons continued to be depressed, leading to a network long-term depression (LTD). The BDZs clonazepam (CLZ) and midazolam (MDZ) also decreased the network excitability, but only MDZ caused LTD of inhibitory neuron cluster. To investigate the origin of the LTD after MDZ application, we tested finasteride (FIN), an inhibitor of endogenous NSs synthesis. FIN did not prevent the LTD induced by MDZ, but surprisingly induced it after application of CLZ. The significance and possible mechanisms underlying these LTD effects of NSs and BDZs are discussed. Taken together, our results not only demonstrate that ex vivo networks show a sensitivity to NSs and BDZs comparable to that expressed in vivo, but also provide a new global in vitro description that can help in understanding their activity in more complex systems.", 
    "197": "Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synapses and the oscillations they orchestrate are altered in autism. GABA-acting benzodiazepines exert in some patients with autism paradoxical effects, raising the possibility that like in epilepsies, GABA excites neurons because of elevated intracellular concentrations of chloride. Following a successful pilot study,(1) we have now performed a double-blind clinical trial using the diuretic, chloride-importer antagonist bumetanide that reduces intracellular chloride reinforcing GABAergic inhibition. Sixty children with autism or Asperger syndrome (3-11 years old) received for 3 months placebo or bumetanide (1 mg daily), followed by 1-month wash out. Determination of the severity of autism was made with video films at day 0 (D0) and D90 by blind, independent evaluators. Bumetanide reduced significantly the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) (D90-D0; P<0.004 treated vs placebo), Clinical Global Impressions (P<0.017 treated vs placebo) and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule values when the most severe cases (CARS values above the mean \u00b1 s.d.; n=9) were removed (Wilcoxon test: P-value=0.031; Student's t-test: P-value=0.017). Side effects were restricted to an occasional mild hypokalaemia (3.0-3.5 mM\u2009l(-1) K(+)) that was treated with supplemental potassium. In a companion study, chronic bumetanide treatment significantly improved accuracy in facial emotional labelling, and increased brain activation in areas involved in social and emotional perception (Hadjikhani et al., submitted). Therefore, bumetanide is a promising novel therapeutic agent to treat autism. Larger trials are warranted to better determine the population best suited for this treatment.",

To date, no study has determined brain and plasma concentrations of GYKI-52466 following subcutaneous administration in animals with or without brain damage. Here we developed and validated a rapid method of high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Chromatographic separation was achieved by a Luna C18 column using a mixture of 25 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)-methanol-acetonitrile (40:37.5:22.5, v/v/v) as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min. The method showed acceptable precision and accuracy and allowed a precise quantification of 25 ng/mL GYKI-52466 in the plasma and brain. Recovery of GYKI-52466 from the plasma and brain was >87%, and GYKI was stable at room temperature and during prolonged storage at -20 \u00b0C. The method was successfully applied in measuring levels of GYKI-52466 following administration of 3 and 20 mg/kg of GYKI-52466 in control and brain damaged rats. A low brain concentration of 0.56 \u03bcM GYKI-52466 was observed with 3mg/kg compared to 10.7 \u03bcM with 20 mg/kg at 90 min post drug administration. Severe ataxia was observed with the 20mg/kg dose for up to 90 min. Furthermore, in ischaemic animals, there was no evidence of a 'surge' in brain GYKI concentrations at the injury site, confirming the integrity of the blood-brain barrier in the region of infarct. Taken together, our findings support a metabotropic mode of action underlying the low-dose neuroprotective efficacy of GYKI-52466.",

A custom oncology population profile was built using the observed relationships among demographic variables and laboratory measurements in Simcyp\u00ae software, a population based ADME simulator. Patients with cancer were older compared with the age distribution in a built-in healthy volunteer profile in Simcyp. Hematocrit and albumin levels were lower and AAG levels were higher in patients with cancer. The custom population profile was used to investigate the disease effect on the pharmacokinetics of two probe substrates, saquinavir and midazolam. Higher saquinavir exposure was predicted in patients relative to healthy subjects, which was explained by the altered drug binding due to elevated AAG levels in patients with cancer. Consistent with historical clinical data, similar midazolam exposure was predicted in patients and healthy subjects, supporting the hypothesis that the CYP3A activity is not altered in patients with cancer. These results suggest that the custom oncology population profile is a promising tool for the prediction of PK in patients with cancer.

Pharmacists working in community pharmacies could use STOPP/START as a guide to conducting medication use reviews; however, community pharmacists do not routinely have access to patients' clinical records.", 
    "231": "To compare the PIM and PPO detection rates from application of the STOPP/START criteria to patients' medication details alone with the detection rates from application of STOPP/START to information on patients' medications combined with clinical information.", 
    "232": "Community Pharmacy.", 
    "233": "Three pharmacists applied STOPP/START to 250 patient medication lists, containing information regarding dose, frequency and duration of treatment. The PIMs and PPOs identified by each pharmacist were compared with those identified by consensus agreement of two other pharmacists, who applied STOPP/START criteria using patients' full clinical records.", 
    "234": "The main outcome measures were: (1) PIM and PPO detection rates among pharmacists with access to patients' clinical information compared to PIM and PPO detection rates among pharmacists using patients' medication information only, and (2) the levels of agreement (calculated using Cohen's kappa statistic (k)) for the three most commonly identified PIMs and PPOs.", 
    "235": "Pharmacists with access to patients' clinical records identified significantly fewer PIMs than pharmacists without (p = 0.002). The three most commonly identified PIMs were benzodiazepines, proton pump inhibitors and duplicate drug classes, with kappa (k) statistic agreement ranges of 0.87-0.97, 0.60-0.68 and 0.39-0.85 respectively. PPOs were identified more often (p < 0.001) when clinical information was considered. The three most commonly identified PPOs were: bisphosphonates, \u03b22-agonists and anti-platelets, with kappa (k) statistic agreement ranges of 0.89-1.0, 0.50-0.80 and 0.5-1.0 respectively.", 
    "236": "PIM detection is likely to be overestimated using STOPP and PPO detection underestimated using START when STOPP/START is used in isolation of clinical information. Agreement for a selected number of criteria for which clinical information is not required is good, suggesting that some criteria may be reliably deployed without clinical information during a medicines use review. However, for STOPP/START criteria to be deployed more effectively by pharmacists, access to the full clinical record is recommended.", 
    "237": "The current study examined the longitudinal effects of clinical and treatment utilization factors on aggressive behavior among 376 help-seeking U.S. veterans recently diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) who were followed for 5-12 months. Participants were sampled from 4 strata: male Iraq/Afghanistan veterans, female Iraq/Afghanistan veterans, male prior-era veterans, and female prior-era veterans. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that changes in PTSD severity were significantly associated with changes in aggressive behavior among veterans who reported any aggression at baseline (\u03b2 = .15). Changes in days of alcohol intoxication also were positively associated with changes in aggressive behavior (\u03b2 = .16). Participants with both a benzodiazepine prescription and any baseline aggression were significantly more likely to increase in aggressive behavior over time (\u03b2 = .14). Contrary to our hypotheses, reductions in aggressive behavior were not related to the number of outpatient mental health visits or to first-line recommended psychotropic medications. Results inform assessment and clinical research on changes in aggressive behavior among veterans with PTSD."
