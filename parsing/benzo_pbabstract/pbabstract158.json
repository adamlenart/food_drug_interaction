Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is expressed in various tissue and organs including macrophages. In this study, we tested whether inflammation characterized by macrophage infiltration can be detected by PBR binding. Six patients diagnosed as carotid atherosclerosis underwent endarterectomy. Using the fresh frozen sections, presence of PBRs and macrophages was examined by in vitro autoradiography using [(3)H]PK 11195 and immunohistochemical staining of CD68, respectively. All sections showed specific binding of [(3)H]PK 11195, and the staining with CD68 indicating macrophage infiltration. Density and distribution of PBR detected by [(3)H]PK 11195 autoradiography were consistent with those of the immunohistochemical staining. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that macrophage and inflammatory activity in atherosclerotic plaque can be imaged specifically by the binding of PBR indicating future application of PET imaging for PBR.", 
    "1": "Antidepressant treatments have been proposed to produce their therapeutic effects, in part, through increasing neurotrophin levels in the brain. The current experiments investigated the effects of acute and chronic treatment with different pharmacologic and somatic antidepressant treatments on protein levels of BDNF in several brain regions associated with depression in the rat. Repeated applications (10 days) of electroconvulsive shock (ECS), but not a single treatment (1 day), produced 40-100% increases of BDNF protein in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, amygdala, and brainstem. Chronic (21 days), but not acute (1 day), treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) desipramine (10 mg/kg), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) fluoxetine (10 mg/kg), and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine (10 mg/kg) increased BDNF protein levels in the frontal cortex (10-30%), but not in the hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and brain stem. To determine whether the regulation of BDNF was unique to antidepressant treatments, drugs used to treat schizophrenia and anxiety were also studied. Chronic administration of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol (1 mg/kg) and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (20 mg/kg) increased BDNF levels by only 8-10% in the frontal cortex. Haloperidol also elevated BDNF levels in the amygdala, while clozapine decreased BDNF in the olfactory bulb. Acute or chronic treatment with the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) did not alter BDNF levels. These results suggest that diverse pharmacologic and somatic antidepressant treatments, as well as antipsychotics, increase levels of BDNF protein in the frontal cortex, even though they have different mechanisms of action at neurotransmitter systems.", 
    "2": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction caused by excessive serotonergic agonism in central and peripheral nervous system serotonergic receptors (Boyer EW, Shannon M. The serotonin syndrome. N Engl J Med 2005;352:1112-1120). Symptoms are characterized by a triad of neuron-excitatory features, which include (a) neuromuscular hyperactivity -- tremor, clonus, myoclonus, hyperreflexia and, in advanced stages, pyramidal rigidity; (b) autonomic hyperactivity -- diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia and tachypnea; (c) altered mental status -- agitation, excitement and, in advanced stages, confusion (Gillman PK. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, opioid analgesics and serotonin toxicity. Br J Anaesth 2005;95:434-441). It arises when pharmacological agents increase serotonin neurotransmission at postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A and 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors through increased serotonin synthesis, decreased serotonin metabolism, increased serotonin release, inhibition of serotonin reuptake or direct agonism of the serotonin receptors (Houlihan D. Serotonin syndrome resulting from coadministration of tramodol, venlafaxine, and mirtazapine. Ann Pharmacother 2004;38:411-413). The etiology is often the result of therapeutic drug use, intentional overdosing of serotonergic agents or complex interactions between drugs that directly or indirectly modulate the serotonin system (Boyer EW, Shannon M. The serotonin syndrome. N Engl J Med 2005;352:1112-1120). Due to the increasing availability of agents with serotonergic activity, physicians need to more aware of serotonin syndrome. The following case highlights the complex nature in which serotonin syndrome can arise, as well as the proper recognition and treatment of a potentially life-threatening yet easily avoidable condition.",

    "7": "North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) were trapped in a managed marsh in northern California between July and November of 1998. Five trap types using several set configurations were utilized in this study. Otters were successfully captured with minimal injury and a relatively high trap rate (1 capture per 48 trap nights), with the use of No. 1.5 and No. 1.75 double-coil spring traps, and No. 11 double long spring traps on short chains in blind land sets, or in bank sets on one-way cables leading to land-buried stakes. Only 3 of 14 captures incurred more than minimal injuries, and all 3 of these were exacerbated by complications from traps attached to long chains. Otters were captured at any time of day, although activity appeared lowered between 0900 and 1900 hours. Otters were anesthetized for handling. Monitoring results and anesthetic complications are reported for 14 captures. Ketamine (15 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) provided a wide margin of safety, rapid induction at low injection volume, good anesthetic quality, handling time of about 30 min, and few complications. White blood cell counts were taken and appeared high relative to reported values in other studies. This trend is likely attributable to blood draws immediately after the animal had been held in a trap for several hours, in contrast to most other studies, in which blood was drawn days to weeks after being held in captivity.",

None of the five solely isoflurane-sedated patients reported hallucinations/delusions from the ICU. There was no difference in groups in long-term psychological morbidity as measured with HADS and IES.

In this study, we separately monitored ligand-induced structural changes in the BZD binding site (alpha/gamma interface) and at aligned positions in the alpha/beta interface. alpha(1)His101 and surrounding residues were individually mutated to cysteine and expressed with wild-type beta2 and gamma2 subunits in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The accessibilities of introduced cysteines to modification by methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA)-Biotin were measured in the presence and absence of GABA-site agonists, antagonists, BZDs, and pentobarbital. The presence of flurazepam or the BZD-site antagonist flumazenil (Ro15-1788) decreased the rate of modification of alpha(1)H101C at the BZD binding site. GABA and muscimol each increased MTSEA-Biotin modification of alpha(1)H101C located at the BZD-site, gabazine (SR-95531, a GABA binding site antagonist) decreased the rate, whereas pentobarbital had no effect. Modification of alpha(1)H101C at the alpha/beta interface was significantly slower than modification of alpha(1)H101C at the BZD site, and the presence of GABA or flurazepam had no effect on its accessibility, indicating the physicochemical environments of the alpha/gamma and alpha/beta interfaces are different. The data are consistent with the idea that GABA-binding site occupation by agonists causes a GABA binding cavity closure that is directly coupled to BZD binding cavity opening, and GABA-site antagonist binding causes a movement linked to BZD binding cavity closure. Pentobarbital binding/gating resulted in no observable movements in the BZD binding site near alpha(1)H101C, indicating that structural mechanisms underlying allosteric coupling between the GABA and BZD binding sites are distinct.",

    "54": "Urinary retention is a condition in which impaired emptying of the bladder results in postvoidal residual urine. It is generally classified into 'acute' or 'chronic' urinary retention. Because of the complex mechanism of micturition, many drugs can interact with the micturition pathway, all via different modes of action. Although the incidence of urinary retention, in particular acute urinary retention, has been well studied in observational studies and randomized controlled trials, data on the incidence of drug-induced urinary retention are scarce. Data from observational studies suggest that up to 10% of episodes might be attributable to the use of concomitant medication. Urinary retention has been described with the use of drugs with anticholinergic activity (e.g. antipsychotic drugs, antidepressant agents and anticholinergic respiratory agents), opioids and anaesthetics, alpha-adrenoceptor agonists, benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, detrusor relaxants and calcium channel antagonists. Elderly patients are at higher risk for developing drug-induced urinary retention, because of existing co-morbidities such as benign prostatic hyperplasia and the use of other concomitant medication that could reinforce the impairing effect on micturition. Drug-induced urinary retention is generally treated by urinary catheterization, especially if acute, in combination with discontinuation or a reduction in dose of the causal drug. Studies have been carried out examining the effects of preventive measures for anaesthesia-related urinary retention, both during and after surgery, particularly into the effect of using opioids in combination with non-opioid analgesic drugs on the incidence of postoperative urinary retention. Although combination therapy reduces the opioid-related adverse events, the effect on urinary retention yields contradictory results. This article reviews the literature on drug-induced urinary retention and focuses on its incidence, the different classes of drugs that have been associated with it, and options for its management and prevention.",

Only the parasomnias have been studied as such in the newborn period. The parasomnias that occur in this age group are infant sleep apnea, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, sudden infant death syndrome, and benign neonatal sleep myoclonus. Infant sleep apnea includes three entities: (1) apnea of prematurity, (2), apparent life threatening episodes with apnea and (3) obstructive sleep apnea. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome can be associated with other autonomic system illness, such as Hirschsprung disease (Haddad syndrome) and neuroblastoma. The implementation of the supine sleep position and smoking free homes has diminished the frequency of sudden infant death syndrome. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus should be considered in all newborns with a normal exam between the episodes when they always occur during sleep. This entity may be mistaken for status epilepticus, because it is associated with increases in heart rate. Benzodiazepines prolongs the duration of the episodes.",

    "61": "We investigated whether fluoxetine, a widely prescribed medication for treatment of depression, restores neuronal plasticity in the adult visual system of the rat. We found that chronic administration of fluoxetine reinstates ocular dominance plasticity in adulthood and promotes the recovery of visual functions in adult amblyopic animals, as tested electrophysiologically and behaviorally. These effects were accompanied by reduced intracortical inhibition and increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the visual cortex. Cortical administration of diazepam prevented the effects induced by fluoxetine, indicating that the reduction of intracortical inhibition promotes visual cortical plasticity in the adult. Our results suggest a potential clinical application for fluoxetine in amblyopia as well as new mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of antidepressants and for the pathophysiology of mood disorders.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the ability of single midazolam concentrations to predict midazolam AUC in the presence and absence of CYP3A modulation by Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE). Subjects received oral midazolam 8 mg before and after 28 days of GBE administration. Postdose blood samples were collected during both study periods and midazolam AUC determined. Linear regression was used to generate measures of predictive performance for each midazolam concentration. The geometric mean ratio (90% confidence intervals) of midazolam AUC(0-infinity) post-GBE/AUC(0-infinity) pre-GBE was 0.66 (0.49-0.84) (P = .03). Before and after GBE administration, optimal midazolam sampling times were identified at 3.5 to 5 hours and 2 to 3 hours, respectively. Single midazolam concentrations between 2 and 5 hours correctly predicted the reduction in midazolam AUC following GBE exposure, but confidence intervals were generally wide. Intersubject variability in CYP3A activity (either inherent or from drug administration) alters the prediction of optimal midazolam sampling times; therefore, midazolam AUC is preferred for assessing CYP3A activity in drug-drug interaction studies.", 
    "68": "The pharmacological treatment of mood and anxiety disorders has for long relied on the serendipitous findings of monoaminergic and benzodiazepine drugs more than 50 years ago. These treatments, however, are therapeutically insufficient and even though more recently developed drugs are particularly improving side effects, the efficacy or response rate of the drugs has fundamentally not improved. Therefore it is necessary to develop new methods to identify novel mechanisms not based on merely the symptomatology, but on biologically relevant (endo) phenotypes. This review examines the option of integrating mouse and human behavioural genetics to aid the identification of the putative underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and pharmacological targets for psychiatric disorders.", 
    "69": "In alcoholic patients, ethanol is often consumed in a repeated cyclic pattern of intoxication followed by abstinence and the emergence of withdrawal symptoms. Repeated cycles of ethanol intoxication and withdrawal lead to a sensitization of central nervous system hyperexcitability as a result of an imbalance between inhibitory GABAergic transmission and excitatory glutamatergic transmission. Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal are usually treated pharmacologically with either benzodiazepines or anticonvulsant medications. However, recent evidence suggests that inhibition of glutamate transmission by stimulation of presynaptic inhibitory metabotropic glutamate receptors (i.e., mGluR2/3 receptors) or inhibition of mGluR5 receptors produces anticonvulsant effects. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the effects the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 and the mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) on ethanol withdrawal-induced seizure activity. Adult male C3H/He mice received chronic 16 h of ethanol vapor exposure in inhalation chambers followed by 8 h of withdrawal daily for 4 consecutive days. During the final (fourth) withdrawal cycle, mice were evaluated hourly for handling-induced convulsions (HIC), and were treated with vehicle, LY379268 (0.3, 1, and 3mg/kg) or MPEP (1, 3, and 10mg/kg) treatment at 4 and 8h into withdrawal. Significant reductions in overall HIC activity were not observed following administration of either compound. These results suggest that inhibition of glutamate transmission by mGluR2/3 agonists or mGluR5 antagonists does not alter HIC activity during withdrawal from repeated ethanol exposure, and as such these compounds may have limited usefulness in the treatment of central nervous system hyperexcitability during alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "70": "Numerous biological functions are attributed to the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) recently renamed translocator protein (TSPO). The best characterized function is the translocation of cholesterol from the outer to inner mitochondrial membrane, which is a rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. TSPO drug ligands have been shown to stimulate pregnenolone formation by inducing TSPO-mediated translocation of cholesterol. Until recently, no direct structural data on this membrane protein was available. In a previous paper, we showed that a part of the mouse TSPO (mTSPO) C-terminal region adopts a helical conformation, the side-chain distribution of which provides a groove able to fit a cholesterol molecule. We report here on the overall structural properties of mTSPO. This study was first undertaken by dissecting the protein sequence and studying the conformation of five peptides encompassing the five putative transmembrane domains from (1)H-NMR data. The secondary structure of the recombinant protein in micelles was then studied using CD spectroscopy. In parallel, the stability of its tertiary fold was probed using (1)H-(15)N NMR. This study provides the first experimental evidence for a five-helix fold of mTSPO and shows that the helical conformation of each transmembrane domain is mainly formed through local short-range interactions. Our data show that, in micelles, mTSPO exhibits helix content close to what is expected but an unstable tertiary fold. They reveal that the binding of a drug ligand that stimulates cholesterol translocation is able to stabilize the mTSPO tertiary structure.",

The analyzed stress hormones showed little variation in 14 patients who were given midazolam at 10 minutes and 4 hours after CPR. Notably, 24 hours after CPR, they were decreased below the levels which were observed at the beginning of CPR (all P<0.01).

In this paper, we show that these three families were present before the split of the animal lineage and that they are likely to share a common decent. We also show that the APF transporters found in plants are most likely homologous to the mammalian beta-group, suggesting that this type of transporters arouse early in the evolution of eukaryotes. We performed detailed tissue expression analysis of all the members of the beta-group in rat and found several examples of highly specific expression patterns, with SLC38A7 being exclusively found in liver, SLC38A5 in blood, and SLC38A4 in muscle and liver. Moreover, we found that SLC38A10 is expressed in several endocrine organs. We also found that SLC38A1 is highly up regulated in the cortex from rats treated with diazepam and that SLC38A2 is significantly down regulated in the same tissue. In addition, we performed a detailed expression analysis of SLC38A1 and SLC38A6 in mouse brain using in situ hybridization, which showed that both these transporters are widely expressed in the brain.",

In highly comorbid, high risk patients this catheter-linked regional anaesthesia combines the advantages of avoiding controlled ventilation with decreased cardiovascular depression, as conveyed by the use of general anaesthesia or neuraxial techniques. Furthermore, improved postoperative analgesia may be achieved for several days. In our retrospective study, 65 patients who were scheduled for amputation of the lower limbs were analysed. In 58 patients (89%), a regional anaesthesia technique employing only a catheter technique was performed and only 7 patients (11%) required additional general anaesthesia. For postoperative pain management, local anaesthetics were administered via an indwelling nerve block catheter and excellent pain scores were achieved in these patients.

Organic diseases may be associated and need to be investigated though no specific recommendations and guidelines are available. We extensively reviewed the literature of all the cases of organic catatonia in children and adolescents from January 1969 to June 2007. We screened socio-demographic characteristics, organic diagnosis, clinical characteristics and treatment. We found 38 cases of children and adolescents with catatonia due to an organic condition. The catatonic syndrome occurred in 21 (57%) females and 16 (43%) males. The mean age of patients was 14.5 years (+/-3.39) [range=7-18 years], and three died from their condition. The organic conditions included infectious diseases (N=10), neurological conditions (N=10), toxic induced states (N=12) and genetic conditions including inborn errors of metabolism (N=6). The onset was dominantly acute, and the clinical presentation most frequently stuporous. Although benzodiazepines were recommended as primary symptomatic treatment, they were rarely prescribed. In several cases, therapeutic approach was related to organic cause (e.g., plasma exchange in lupus erythematosus; copper chelators in Wilson's disease). Based on this review and on our own experience of catatonia in youth, we proposed a consensual and multidisciplinary diagnostic strategy to help practitioners to identify underlying organic diseases.",

The radiofluorination of DPA-714 was achieved by nucleophilic (18)F-fluoride displacement of the tosylate precursor. (18)F-DPA-714 was assessed in rats harboring unilateral quinolinic acid (QA) lesions.

In this field, there is no evidence that reaches the level of a standard: there are guidelines on the use of methylphenidate, donepezil and bromocriptine for the treatment of cognitive disturbances, for the non-use of phenytoin and for the use of beta-blockers for controlling aggressiveness. Resolving a single symptom is not relevant in a rehabilitation project if it is not in the context of a more complex picture of neurobehavioural recovery, in which the positive and negative effects of every therapeutic choice are considered. For example, phenytoin could be used for the positive control of epileptic crises but is not advised since it impedes the recovery of cognitive functions in general. Analogous effects not yet identified may concern benzodiazepine, neuroleptics and other sedatives usually prescribed in cases of cranial trauma. Psychotropic drugs are considered to be able to influence the neuronal plasticity processes. Studies on animals have shown that the administration of D-amphetamine combined with sensorial-motor exercise produces the steady acceleration of motor recovery, which acts as a catalyst to the neurological recovery process. On the other hand, alpha1-NA receptor antagonist drugs produce negative effects; these include clonidine (antihypertension) and haloperidol (neuroleptic).

The reproducibility of a single bolus [(11)C]flumazenil measurements was studied by scanning eight healthy volunteers twice during the same day. Grey matter regions were analyzed using both regions-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-based analysis methods. Compartmental kinetic modelling using both arterial and reference region input function were applied to derive the total tissue distribution volume (V(T)) and the binding potential (BP) (BP(P) and BP(ND)) of [(11)C]flumazenil. To measure the reproducibility and reliability of each [(11)C]flumazenil binding parameter, absolute variability values (VAR) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. Tissue radioactivity concentration over time was best modelled with a 2-tissue compartmental model. V(T) showed with all methods good to excellent reproducibility and reliability with low VARs (mean of all brain regions) (5.57%-6.26%) and high ICCs (mean of all brain regions) (0.83-0.88) when using conventional ROI analysis.

The new atypical antipsychotics are thought to be at least as effective as first-generation drugs and to cause fewer adverse effects. These drugs, however, are currently not US FDA-approved for use among elderly demented subjects due to a slight increase in the risk of death and serious cardiovascular events within this population. However, their favourable adverse effect profile has led many physicians to prescribe these drugs as first-line therapy for behaviourally disturbed patients with Alzheimer's disease. Clinical trials to evaluate the use of atypical antipsychotics have produced varying results, and clarity has not yet been achieved. Thus, a quantitative summary of the risks and benefits may help inform complex decisions that must be made in this area.

    "115": "During development, when inhibitory and excitatory synapses are formed and refined, homeostatic mechanisms act to adjust inhibitory input in order to maintain neural activity within a normal range. As the brain matures, synaptogenesis slows and a relatively stable level of inhibition is achieved. Deficits in inhibitory neurotransmission are associated with increased anxiety-related behavior and drugs that potentiate GABA function, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, are effective anxiolytics. These observations raise the possibility that transient perturbations in the activity of neural circuits during development might induce compensatory changes in inhibition that could persist into adulthood and contribute to changes in anxiety-related behavior. To test this hypothesis, we treated mice continuously during the major period of forebrain synaptogenesis (P14-28) with the GABA-A receptor positive modulator diazepam and assessed anxiety-related behavior in adulthood. Control experiments confirmed anxiolytic effects of the drug following one day of treatment and the development of tolerance following two weeks of treatment. When tested in adulthood, one month after the end of treatment, diazepam-treated mice exhibited significantly increased behavioral inhibition in the open-field, elevated-plus maze, and novel object behavioral paradigms. Levels of benzodiazepine binding sites in amygdala and frontal cortex were specifically decreased in diazepam-treated mice demonstrating that homeostatic adjustments in GABA function persist into adulthood.

Although a subgenual part of ACC (sACC) may be vulnerable in depression and area 25 is cytologically unique, there are no assessments that contrast this region with pregenual ACC (pACC). Thus, we undertook independent multimodal verifications of architectural differences among subregions and areas. Areas 24a and 24b have pregenual and subgenual components. The latter have a thin layer III. Area 24c has dorsal (pd24c) and ventral (pv24c) parts. Area pd24c has larger neurofilament-expressing neurons in layer Va, and neurons in Vb form aggregates in area pv24c. Area pd24c occupies both banks of the cingulate sulcus, with pv24c on the ventral bank. Layer III of pd24cd has many larger neurofilament-expressing neurons and a richer dendritic plexus. Area 32 has pregenual (p32) and subgenual (s32) components. Layer II in s32 is of particular note because it has a neuron-dense IIa and sparse IIb. Area 25 has anterior (25a) and posterior (25p) parts; 25p has the thinnest layer III in the cingulate gyrus. Area 25a contains significantly higher AMPA, kainate, NMDA, GABA(A), GABA(B), and alpha(1) densities than 25p. Area 33 continues around the genu and ventrally to encompass the full caudal extent of area 25. Subgenual ACC has significantly higher GABA(A), GABA(B), benzodiazepine (BZ), alpha(1), and 5-HT(1A) densities than pACC. GABA(B), BZ, and alpha(1) binding confirms the subdivision of area pd24c. In conclusion, ACC comprises two parts that are unique in terms of their cytoarchitecture and neurotransmitter receptor organization.",

Morbidity and mortality are increased in children due to narrow airways and immature protective mechanisms. Factors to consider in pediatric dentistry are: (1) the patient's age and behavior; (2) presence and extent of disability; (3) local anesthesia; (4) body positioning; and (5) loose teeth. FBA requires prompt recognition and early treatment to minimize potentially serious and sometimes fatal consequences. The purpose of this case report was to describe the aspiration of a stainless steel crown in a 5-year-old boy during conscious sedation.

    "118": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (transient apical ballooning of the left ventricle) is a recently described and often underdiagnosed entity. The syndrome is observed predominately in postmenopausal women and the clinical signs are similar to those of an acute anterior myocardial infarction. In most of the reported cases an emotional or physical stress event has been identified as a trigger, and perioperative stress has been suggested as the trigger in some of these cases. Outcome is favorable with the right treatment, though recurrences are possible. We report the anesthetic management of a 79-year-old woman with a previously diagnosed episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, who was admitted to our hospital for total hip replacement. Care was taken to provide proper preoperative sedation before provision of hyperbaric spinal anesthesia, followed by sedation with intravenous propofol. Surgery and the early postoperative period were uneventful. We believe that minimizing perioperative anxiety should be a priority in these patients due to the possibility that a catecholamine discharge might trigger an episode of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.", 
    "119": "Approximately half of patients with sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) also experience insomnia. The relationship between these two common sleep disorders is complex and unclear but patients with both SDB and insomnia have poorer sleep quality and are more likely to have psychiatric disorders than those with SDB alone. SDB is more common in men than women; however, the incidence of comorbid insomnia is greater in women with SDB than in men. The management of comorbid SDB and insomnia involves the screening of patients with insomnia or psychiatric disorders for SDB; although interviews may be effective in diagnosing SDB in patients with insomnia, polysomnography can diagnose veiled SDB. To address comorbid SDB and insomnia therapies should be aimed at both disorders. Patients should first be encouraged to improve their sleep hygiene and make lifestyle changes to improve sleep. Treatments for SDB include continuous positive airway pressure and oral appliances, while upper airway surgery may improve sleep outcomes in some patients. The use of pharmacological drugs such as hypnotics for the treatment of insomnia in patients with SDB remains controversial.",

Concomitant use may lead to accidents and other serious consequences. The aim of this study was to analyze the drinking behavior of psychotropic drug users in an aging Finnish population. This study is part of the ongoing epidemiologic FinDrink study. Self-reported data on alcohol consumption and psychotropic drug use were collected from the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study examinations conducted in 1998-2001. Overall, 854 men and 920 women participated in the study. A total of 204 (11.5%) individuals used psychotropic drugs regularly (14.2% of women and 8.5% of men; P<.001). Three quarters of the study population had used alcohol weekly during the preceding year (68.9% of women and 87.5% of men; P<.001). Men who use anxiolytics and sedatives were more likely to drink alcohol at least twice a week (odds ratio=2.42; 95% confidence interval=1.30-4.51), to be binge drinkers (odds ratio=1.86; 95% confidence interval=1.01-3.43) and to be heavy alcohol consumers (odds ratio=2.22; 95% confidence interval= 1.13-4.39) than men not using psychotropics. In women, alcohol consumption and drinking patterns were same between the groups. Our results indicate the potential for alcohol-related health risks among aging Finnish men and women using psychotropic drugs.",

The main explanatory covariates were age on k(a), bodyweight on CL/F and V(d)/F, and enzyme-inducing AED on CL/F, of which bodyweight was the most influential covariate. Dosing can be carried out with either 10 mg/kg of oral solution twice daily in children weighing <50 kg and a 500-mg tablet twice daily in those weighing >50 kg or, when patients favour a solid formulation, 10 mg/kg of oral solution twice daily in children weighing <20 kg, a 250-mg tablet twice daily in those weighing 20-40 kg, and a 500-mg tablet twice daily in those weighing >40 kg.

PBMEC/C1-2 and ECV304 cells were cultured in several media with different compositions on Transwell inserts. Inducibility and functionality of tightness were investigated by transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) and by transport studies with transcellular marker diazepam, glycine antagonist Bu101 and paracellular marker APTS-dextran. Inducibility, expression and localization of tight junctional proteins were assessed by western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. Presence of factors derived from glioma cell line C6 resulted in increased TEER in both cell lines. Comparison to APTS-dextran data across Caco-2 layers emphasized that correlations between permeability of the paracellular marker and TEER are dependent on each investigated cell line and the corresponding growth medium. Presence and inducibility of tight junctional proteins ZO-1 and Occludin were proven for ECV304 layers. Cell line ECV304 seemed to be suitable for TEER dependent transport studies, whereas PBMEC/C1-2 showed higher potential for P-gP studies.",

The primary analysis compared the group taking olanzapine with the group taking any other antipsychotics, while the secondary comparison was performed between those treated with olanzapine and those with risperidone. Efficacy analysis was carried out based on changes in Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale (CGI-S), which was performed at a global symptom level, as well as with respect to the patients' positive, negative, cognitive and depressive symptoms. In addition, adverse events were also evaluated. Results of the analysis of the 3- and 6-month data from Hungary are disclosed in this publication. 200 patients were enrolled in the country. Demographics of the treatment groups were not significantly different. At 3 and 6 months after treatment initiation, there were no significant between-group differences in improvement of global symptomatology, however, cognitive symptoms improved more in the Olanzapine-group compared to those taking other antipsychotics (p<0.05). In patients showing Extrapyramidal Symptoms (EPS) at baseline, these symptoms finished to a greater extent among those receiving olanzapine than in those receiving other antipsychotics (after 6 months D<0.0001). Half a year later, significantly less patients showed extrapyramidal adverse events (p=0,0007), and the previous EPS terminated to a greater extent (p=0.0016) in the olanzapine group, as compared to those taking risperidone. No between-group differences were found in changes of sexual functions, as well as of weight and Body Mass Index measures. Switching antipsychotic initiated at study baseline, and adding-on one or more other antipsychotic to the initial one, were significantly less frequent in the Olanzapine-group compared to those initiated other antipsychotics. In the first 3 months, treatment compliance was significantly higher with olanzapine therapy than with other antipsychotic treatments, and with risperidone respectively. Results from the Hungarian sample correspond with results from higher analysis levels of wider patient populations of IC-SOHO study. Olanzapine showed outstanding efficacy in lessening cognitive disturbances and global clinical symptomatology associated with schizophrenia.

Drug discrimination procedures were used to determine whether the novel GABA(A) receptor efficacy profiles would be reflected in a model of subjective effects of BZ-site ligands. Rats were trained to discriminate TPA023, TPA023B, the nonselective BZ anxiolytic lorazepam, or the alpha(1)-selective hypnotic zolpidem. The lorazepam, zolpidem, and TPA023 discriminations were learned in < 50 sessions. The TPA023B training group showed no evidence of acquiring the TPA023B discrimination after 160 sessions despite various procedural manipulations. Neither zolpidem- nor lorazepam-trained rats generalized to TPA023B. Within the same dose range, however, TPA023-trained rats generalized fully and dose-dependently to TPA023B. Number of training sessions to regain criterion discrimination performance following TPA023B tests in the lorazepam, zolpidem, and TPA023 groups increased as a function of dose, likely due to effects of residual TPA023B. Together with previous data, the present results suggest that elimination of alpha(1) efficacy plus reductions in alpha(2/3) efficacy permits anxiolysis but decreases BZ-like interoceptive stimulus effects.",

    "153": "Benzodiazepine (BZ) site ligands affect vigilance, anxiety, memory processes, muscle tone and epileptogenic propensity through modulation of neurotransmission at GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3 or alpha5 subunits, and may have numerous experimental and clinical applications. The ability of non-selective BZ site inverse agonists to enhance cognition, documented in animal models and human studies, is clinically not feasible due to potentially unacceptable psychomotor effects. Most investigations to date have proposed the alpha1 and/or alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors as comprising the memory-modulating population of these receptors. The novel ligand PWZ-029, which we synthesized and characterized electrophysiologically, possesses in vitro binding selectivity and moderate inverse agonist functional selectivity at alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors. This ligand has also been examined in rats in the passive and active avoidance, spontaneous locomotor activity, elevated plus maze and grip strength tests, primarily predictive of the effects on the memory acquisition, basal locomotor activity, anxiety level and muscle tone, respectively. The improvement of task learning was detected at the dose of 5 mg/kg in the passive, but not active avoidance test. The inverse agonist PWZ-029 had no effect on anxiety or muscle tone, whereas at higher doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) it decreased locomotor activity. This effect was antagonized by flumazenil and also by the lower (but not the higher) dose of an agonist (SH-053-R-CH3-2'F) selective for GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha5 subunit. The hypolocomotor effect of PWZ-029 was not antagonized by the antagonist ss-CCt exhibiting a preferential affinity for alpha1-subunit-containing receptors. These data suggest that moderate negative modulation at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha5 subunit is a sufficient condition for eliciting enhanced encoding/consolidation of declarative memory, while the influence of higher doses of modulators at these receptors on motor activity shows an intricate pattern whose relevance and mechanism await to be defined.",

    "162": "The concentrations of HSA and FFA increased significantly (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 1.18 +/- 0.10, 5.46 +/- 4.91), the concentrations of IS and HA decreased significantly (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 0.69 +/- 0.10, 0.33 +/- 0.15) and CMPF concentrations did not alter significantly (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 0.97 +/- 0.12, P = 0.471). The free fractions of (14)C-warfarin decreased in all 14 patients at site I at post-HD compared to pre-HD (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 0.59 +/- 0.13). The free fractions of (14)C-diazepam at site II remarkably decreased in 10 of 14 patients (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 0.61 +/- 0.17) and unexpectedly increased in 4 (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 1.08 +/- 0.06) post-HD compared to pre-HD. In these four patients, when we investigated the influences of these variation factors on the reduction of the binding capacities of site II, [FFA]/[HSA] increased significantly post-HD, compared to pre-HD (post-HD/pre-HD ratio: 6.91 +/- 6.58). ([FFA]/[HSA] ratios of the 4 patients were from 1.22 to 3.55, the highest for the 14 patients post-HD, but the ratios of the other 10 were below 1.2 post-HD.)", 
    "163": "The binding capacity of site II was unexpectedly decremented by the effects of the remarkable elevation of FFA. Therefore, monitoring the binding capacity of site II in HD is important for patients with end-stage renal disease in the efficacious administration plan using the binding inhibition of HSA.",

The discussion is based on the pharmacological properties and adverse effects of benzodiazepines in the elderly subjects. The conclusions are that benzodiazepines should be rarely prescribed in elderly people; many patients treated by benzodiazepines should be withdrawn and other therapeutic strategies than benzodiazepines should be considered to treat anxiety and insomnia in the elderly patients.", 
    "165": "A 37-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency room because of an autointoxication with hydroxychloroquine, leading to haemodynamic instability. Treatment consisted of the rapid administration of intravenous diazepam, after which the hypotension recovered rapidly even though no vasoactive medication was given. Treatment with diazepam has been advised in the Netherlands for many years in case of severe hydroxychloroquine intoxication, despite the fact that convincing evidence for its use is lacking. On the basis of the experience with the relevant cases, the administration of diazepam, 2 mg/kg initially followed by 2 mg/kg/24 hours as a continuous infusion, should certainly be considered for supportive treatment in the ICU in case of severe haemodynamic instability.",

We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman with asthma admitted to Emergency Department after complaining acute respiratory failure and coma. The improvement of respiratory failure, after administration of high concentration of oxygen, beta-2 agonist and corticosteroids, wasn't associated at improvement of consciousness. The deterioration of blood gases dont justified coma. Having a suspicion the patient takes some benzodiazepines, we administered flumazenil and the patient improved adequately.",

Despite the dentist's best efforts to employ traditional techniques, the behavioral management of challenging pediatric dental patients often requires more than \"tell, show, do\". Consequently, pre-operative pharmacological intervention may be necessary. Enteral sedation may be the optimal adjunct for the dental treatment of such a challenging patient population. However it must be utilized with caution and is not an appropriate treatment modality for all. This paper will present various considerations for the safe, appropriate and effective use of enteral sedation in contemporary pediatric dentistry. With the strong demand for this service, properly trained practitioners can broaden their practice and provide a win-win scenario for themselves and their patients.",

Information was collected regarding demographics, family history, personal history, suicidal ideation, current stressors, the act of DSH and its management.", 
    "175": "The most common age group was 21-25 years of age. The majority were females (60.3%). 95.1% of patients used self-poisoning as a method of deliberate self-harm. 47.3% used benzodiazepines for self-poisoning. Precipitating factors included conflict with family, marital problems, chronic illnesses, and unemployment. Comorbid psychiatric disorders were present in 76.4% patients.", 
    "176": "Despite the difference in socio-cultural background of our patients, many of our results were found to be consistent with Western data. Our findings suggest that problem-solving therapy, stress management and improved mental health care may be effective interventions in preventing DSH. Prescription of medications should be regulated. Further studies are suggested at the community level.", 
    "177": "We studied the association between polymorphisms of genes coding for dopamine D(2) (DRD2), dopamine D(3) (DRD3), serotonin 2(a) (HTR2A), and serotonin 2(c) (HTR2C) receptors and Antipsychotic-Induced Parkinsonism (AIP), rigidity, bradykinesia, and rest-tremor in African-Caribbeans treated with antipsychotics. Polymorphisms of DRD2 (-141CIns/Del, TaqIA, 957C > T), DRD3 (Ser9Gly), HTR2A (-1438A > G, 102T > C, His452Tyr), and HTR2C (-759C > T, Cys23Ser) genes were determined according to standard protocols. The Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale was used for the measurement of AIP, rigidity, bradykinesia, and rest-tremor. Chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests were applied for the association analyses. The t-test was applied for continuous data. Ninety nine males and 27 females met the inclusion criteria (Schizophr Res 1996, 19:195). In males, but not in females, there were significant associations between -141CDel-allele carriership (DRD2) and rigidity (Fisher's Exact Test: P = 0.021) and between 23Ser-allele carriership (HTR2C) and bradykinesia (P = 0.026, chi(2) = 5.0) or AIP (P = 0.008, chi(2) = 7.1). Rest-tremor was not associated with any of the polymorphisms studied. Analyses of the age, chlorpromazine equivalents, benztropine equivalents, the number of patients using anticholinergic medication, and the utilization patterns of the antipsychotic medication did not show statistically significant differences between patients with and without AIP, rigidity, bradykinesia, rest-tremor. Conducting the analysis without gender stratification did not affect our findings considerably, except for the association between bradykinesia and 23Ser-allele which failed to reach statistical significance in the total sample (P = 0.0646, chi(2) = 3.41). Since AIPs subsymptoms (rigidity, bradykinesia, and rest-tremor) may differ pharmacogenetically, our data strongly support symptom-specific analysis of AIP. However, further research is warranted to confirm our findings.", 
    "178": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by disturbances of mood and affect, but also by a distinct pattern of psychomotor and cognitive deficits such as motor retardation and impaired executive functioning. An important aspect of executive functioning is performance monitoring, i.e., a continuous checking whether intended action goals have been reached and whether correction of the applied strategy is necessary. A well-known marker for action monitoring is the error negativity (Ne) or error-related negativity (ERN), an event-related potential (ERP) component generated in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) following erroneous responses. To date, Ne/ERN amplitudes have been investigated in moderately depressed patients only. The present study is the first to investigate action monitoring in severely depressed patients (mean Hamilton score=28.4). In addition, the patients' psychomotor performance was assessed to see whether there is a relationship between action monitoring and psychomotor retardation. Behavioural and ERP measurements were obtained during performance on a speeded two-choice reaction task in 26 patients with MDD and 25 healthy, matched controls. Psychomotor performance measures were speed of simple movements in various psychomotor tasks and the score on the Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re retardation rating scale (SRRS). Relative to the controls, the patients' behavioural results revealed a similar, but slower performance pattern. Overall between-group differences were demonstrated for the error positivity (Pe) amplitudes, but not for the Ne/ERN amplitudes. However, correlations of the Ne/ERN amplitude with several psychomotor variables were strong. In the depressed patients taking benzodiazepines an additional attenuation of Ne/ERN amplitudes was observed. Only severely depressed patients manifesting retardation showed impeded action monitoring. The correlations between action monitoring and psychomotor performance indicate that in MDD these two processes are highly interdependent, both being deregulated. Moreover, the same network of brain regions is likely to be implicated in both processes.",

All patients received no benzodiazepine premedication and fentanyl 1 microg/kg was given 3 minutes before propofol injection. The propofol 1 mg/kg was manually injected at 0.5 mL/sec. The verbal rating score (VRS 0-10) was recorded on pain of injection. VRS > 4 indicates a significant response to pain.",

Either midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV (Group I) or meperidine 0.3 mg/kg IV followed by midazolam 0.05 mg/kg (Group II) IV were used for sedation. Data of noninvasive hemodynamic and cardiac parameters were recorded before and at the 1st minute after medication, and at the 1st minute and 2-min intervals during the procedure. Endoscopists assessed the comfort of patients according to pre-determined criteria. Statistical analysis was performed for both inter-group and in-group comparisons of parameters.",

Blood pressures and oxygen saturation decreased significantly with sedation in both groups during endoscopy (p<0.05), without significant difference between the groups for the changes in these parameters (p>0.05). Patient compliance was significantly better in Group II than in Group I, for all measured criteria.", 
    "187": "We observed that heart rate increases significantly whereas SAP, DAP and SpO2 decrease significantly with both sedation methods. Groups did not differ except for the significantly higher increase in heart rate in Group I. Patient compliance was significantly better with combined sedation. We believe that combined sedation in selected patients provides a safe sedation with a mild to moderate increase in heart rate and a better patient compliance during gastroscopy.", 
    "188": "Children with psychiatric illness may display pathologic aggression (PA) that is destructive, severe, chronic, and unresponsive to psychosocial and psychopharmacological treatment of their underlying condition(s) and psychosocial interventions specifically targeting PA. For this subset of children with PA, pharmacotherapy may be an appropriate treatment option to optimize their functioning. This article reviews pharmacological treatment studies for PA in children and the safety and efficacy of risperidone, olanzapine, lithium, divalproex sodium, methylphenidate, and typical antipsychotics in this patient population. While safety needs to be emphasized when prescribing medication for these patients, serious health and safety risks are also raised when PA is not effectively treated. Future research is needed to evaluate whether the long-term risks associated with the pharmacological treatment of PA outweigh the potential benefits to the child.",

More patients complained about throat pain after the procedure (AMS vs. SMS=37 vs. 45%; p=NS). More patients in the SMS group remembered the scope being placed in the mouth versus AMS (33 vs. 10%; p<0.02). More patients remembered gagging during the procedure in the SMS group versus the AMS group, but this did not reach statistical significance (24 vs. 10%; p=0.06).

    "193": "An exceptional epidemic of poisonings due to the highly potent opioid designer drug 3-methylfentanyl (TMF) was revealed among Estonian drug users in 2005-2006 by post-mortem forensic toxicology. Quantitative analysis of cis-TMF, trans-TMF, and fentanyl was performed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Comprehensive toxicological analysis was performed using a multi-technique approach. The number of TMF-related fatal accidental poisonings identified was 46 and 71 for 2005 and 2006, respectively. The proportion of male victims was 91.5% and the mean age of all victims was 26 years at death. TMF was used predominantly by intravenous injection. There was no significant difference in the blood concentrations of cis-TMF and trans-TMF between pure TMF poisonings and mixed TMF poisonings. The mean combined concentration of TMF stereoisomers among pure TMF cases (1.9 microg/l) was more than ten times lower than the mean fentanyl concentration in fentanyl-related fatalities. Concomitant use of other drugs involved alcohol, amphetamines, benzodiazepines, and cannabis, but very rarely other opioids.", 
    "194": "An efficacious, reliable, and non-invasive route of administration for midazolam, a drug used for sedation and pre-anaesthetic medication, would have obvious advantages. This study compares two potential methods of administering midazolam by the nasal and nebulized routes.", 
    "195": "Midazolam (0.2 mg kg(-1)) was given by both nebulizer and nasally by liquid instillation to 10 healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind crossover study. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, Ramsay sedation scores, visual analogue scores, critical flicker fusion frequency, and parameters of cardiovascular and respiratory function were measured over 60 min and summarized using 'area under the curve'.", 
    "196": "Nasal instillation caused more sedation than nebulized administration. This was demonstrated by higher Ramsay sedation scores (P=0.005), lower visual analogue scores (P<0.001), and lower critical flicker fusion frequency (P<0.02). Nasal instillation was associated with higher plasma concentrations of midazolam (P<0.001). Unpleasant symptoms were recorded by six volunteers in the intranasal and one in the nebulized group (P=0.06).", 
    "197": "There was some evidence that midazolam caused less discomfort when given by nebulizer compared with intranasally. Comparative bioavailability of midazolam, estimated by the ratio (nebulized:nasal) of area under the 60 min plasma concentration curve, was 1:2.9. A higher dose may need to be administered for adequate pre-anaesthetic medication when midazolam is given by nebulizer.", 
    "198": "Our recent study has shown that the intracerebroventricular administration of d-serine, an endogenous and selective agonist for the glycine site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor, alone or in combination with morphine, leads to the potentiation of antinociception on the tail-flick response. Although there is a variety of information concerning the effects of benzodiazepines on opioid-induced antinociception, little is known about the effect of benzodiazepines on the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor agonist-induced antinociception. To clarify the analgesic interactions among the benzodiazepine/GABA(A), N-methyl-d-aspartate and opioid receptors at the supraspinal level, we investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular administration of midazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, on the antinociception evoked by the intracerebroventricular application of d-serine or morphine. The intracerebroventricular administration of midazolam alone produced hyperalgesia on the tail-flick response in a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil-reversible manner. The antinociception induced by the intracerebroventricular application of d-serine or morphine was attenuated by the intracerebroventricular administration of midazolam. In addition, this inhibitory effect of midazolam on the antinociception of d-serine or morphine was antagonized by the intracerebroventricular administration of flumazenil. Together with the facts that d-serine and midazolam act as selective agonists for the glycine site of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor and benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptor, respectively, these observations suggest a functional interaction between the NMDA and benzodiazepine/GABA(A) receptors in the regulation of antinociception at the supraspinal level.", 
    "199": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) remain important agents in the management of epilepsy. They are drugs of first choice for status epilepticus and seizures associated with post-anoxic insult and are also frequently used in the treatment of febrile, acute repetitive and alcohol withdrawal seizures. Clinical advantages of these drugs include rapid onset of action, high efficacy rates and minimal toxicity. Benzodiazepines are used in a variety of clinical situations because they have a broad spectrum of clinical activity and can be administered via several routes. Potential shortcomings of BZDs include tolerance, withdrawal symptoms, adverse events, such as cognitive impairment and sedation, and drug interactions. Benzodiazepines differ in their pharmacologic effects and pharmacokinetic profiles, which dictate how the drugs are used. Among the approximately 35 BZDs available, a select few are used for the management of seizures and epilepsy: clobazam, clonazepam, clorazepate, diazepam, lorazepam and midazolam. Among these BZDs, clorazepate has a unique profile that includes a long half-life of its active metabolite and slow onset of tolerance. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of clorazepate (particularly the sustained-release formulation) could theoretically help minimize adverse events. However, larger, controlled studies of clorazepate are needed to further examine its role in the treatment of patients with epilepsy.", 
    "200": "Borderline personality disorder is a disorder with important social and clinical repercussions, which has been treated mainly by psychotherapy. In recent years, the syndromic analysis of this disorder has allowed us to identify different symptoms capable of being improved with psychopharmacology treatment. Thus, its complex symptomatology could be included in four clinical dimensions: impulsive-aggressive, affective instability, cognitive- perceptive and anxiety-inhibition. Antidepressants, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, or more recently omega-3 fatty acids have shown efficacy in the treatment of symptomatic dimensions of this disease. We have reviewed scientific articles (reviews, clinical trials or clinical guidelines) published over the last ten years and have proposed therapeutic algorithms for psychopharmacology management in these patients."
