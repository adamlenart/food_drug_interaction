Slow excitatory postsynaptic potentials (sEPSPs) were evoked by electrical stimulation of an interganglionic fibre tract. The effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists on the sEPSPs was investigated in 11 neurons. Application of the CCK receptor antagonists L-364,718 and L-365,260 (each 250 nM) markedly attenuated the sEPSPs in five of 11 neurons. The amplitude of the sEPSP reduced from 15 +/- 3 to 7 +/- 2 mV and the change in membrane resistance during the sEPSP was reduced from 28 +/- 9 to 11 +/- 8 MS. In six of 11 neurons the CCK antagonists had no effect on the sEPSPs. The results provide evidence that neurally released CCK is involved in the mediation of sEPSPs in some enteric neurons.", 
    "1": "Home parenteral nutrition (HPN) is used to treat intestinal failure. A minority of HPN patients are dependent on opiates and benzodiazepines to control pain and anxiety. The aim of this study was to determine what effects such drug dependence had on patient outcomes.", 
    "2": "Ten dependent patients were prospectively compared with 10 well-matched, nondependent HPN patients for the same 12-month period. Episodes of line sepsis and other complications were documented and the cost of treatment estimated. Health status was measured using the SF36 and EuroQol instruments.", 
    "3": "The dependent group had significantly more episodes of central line sepsis (p = .0007) as well as other complications (p = .0002). This led to significantly longer periods of inpatient care (p = .0004) and therefore higher costs of treatment. Health status was lower in the dependent group; they reported more pain (p = .04) and less energy (p = .04).", 
    "4": "The complication rate and increased cost of treatment for opiate- and sedative-dependent patients receiving HPN significantly detract from the overall outcome of this therapy.", 
    "5": "The benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, inhibits cAMP production in the rat brain. Since cAMP influences c-fos activity, we examined the effects of diazepam on expression of this immediate early gene, as indicated by Western blot analysis. Intraperitoneal administration of diazepam increased Fos protein levels in the striatum, but not in the hippocampus. In contrast, pretreatment with diazepam blocked the potent inducing effect of amphetamine, in both brain regions. Similar induction and blockade effects were also observed for a 90 kDa Fos related antigen (Fra), in the striatum and hippocampus. The possible mechanisms underlying the modulatory effects of diazepam on c-fos expression in the brain are discussed.", 
    "6": "Eighteen patients with poor risk Ewing's sarcoma (including 11 patients with metastatic disease at presentation) received consolidation therapy of busulphan and melphalan with autologous stem cell rescue. There were nine females. The median age at diagnosis was 14.2 years (range 2.75-30 years). There was one early death due to cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. One patient developed a single generalised convulsion during busulphan therapy. Severe renal toxicity was not encountered. One patient developed veno-occlusive disease of the liver (VOD) which eventually resolved. With a median follow up of 2 years, 13 patients survive including six with initial metastatic disease. We conclude that high-dose busulphan/melphalan is well-tolerated and should be evaluated for efficacy in a larger series of patients with high risk Ewing's sarcoma.", 
    "7": "The effect of diazepam (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and buspirone (5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on the burying behaviour latency (denoting actions on the animals' reactivity) and on the cumulative burying behaviour (directly reflecting the experimental anxiety levels), were analyzed in male-, intact females, at proestrus and metoestrus, and in neonatally-androgenized-rats. Androgenization was performed by injecting 60 micrograms/rat of testosterone propionate on day 5 after delivery. Two main groups of neonatally-androgenized rats were established: A group of animals showing permanent oestrus from the vaginal opening (acyclic females) and a group presenting the delayed anovulatory syndrome. Diazepam produced a clear reduction in experimental anxiety in males and neonatally-androgenized-females. Particularly important was the anxiolytic effect of diazepam on acyclic females that was accompanied by a significant increase in burying behaviour latency. Conversely, buspirone induced a clear reduction in burying behaviour, without modifying its latency, in all groups regardless of the gender and the neonatal treatment. Data are discussed on the basis of the androgen participation on the anxiolytic drug effects. A possible age-related benzodiazepine actions in females is suggested.", 
    "8": "To investigate the effect of regional cerebral blood flow on the effect of midazolam, we evaluated 99mTc-hexamethylpropylene-amine-oxime-single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in 37 cases of childhood moyamoya disease. They were divided into two groups according to the findings of SPECT; one group showed hypoperfusion in the bifrontal regions (n = 20), and the other did not (n = 17). Both groups received 1 mg.kg-1 of midazolam transrectally 30 min before the anesthesia induction and level of sedation was measured with six point scales. Significantly lower level of sedation score was recognized in the group that showed hypoperfusion in bifrontal regions (P < 0.05). Our finding may suggest that regional cerebral hypoperfusion may modify the sedative effect of midazolam in children with moyamoya disease.", 
    "9": "Onset as well as many symptoms of asthma are said to be related to autonomic dysfunction which often appear as a result of actual daily stress of the patients. Minor tranquilizers and anti-depressants are often successful in treating such symptoms, though precise effect of these drugs on asthma is not yet available, while many still hesitate to use these drug for fear of the anticholinergic effect which may hinder the efficient expectoration of sputum which could be critical during severe asthma attacks. In this study, these drugs were evaluated by the asthma score, peak flow, acetylcholine provocation test and the suppressive effect on lymphocytes. They could be beneficial in increasing the quality of asthma therapy if employed with necessary care.", 
    "10": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors (PBRs) have been identified in various peripheral tissues as well as in glial cells in in the brain. PBRs are located mainly on the outer mitochondrial membrane and bind with high affinity the BZ Ro 5-4864 (4'-cholorodiazepam) and the non-BZ PK 11195 (an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative), but bind with very low affinity the BZ clonazepam. PBRs have been cloned from various species. PBRs are multimeric receptors composed of the 18-kDa binding site for isoquinolines, the 32-kDa voltage-dependent anion channel, and the 30-kDa adenine nucleotide carrier (which binds BZs). The expression of PBRs is especially high in steroidogenic organs. Steroid administration affects PBR density, whereas depletion of hormones by hypophysectomy in female rats, or castration (surgical or chemical) in male rats, decreases PBR density in endocrine organs, which can be elevated to normal values after administration of the appropriate hormone. PBRs are probably involved in several functions, including cell proliferation, respiration, and steroidogenesis. It has been suggested that PBRs are involved in the translocation of cholesterol from the outer to the inner membrane of the mitochondria and have an effect on the biosynthesis of steroids.", 
    "11": "Intravenous diazepam has been advocated as an appetite stimulant in anorexic cats. Diazepam has also been used to stimulate the intake of radiographic contrast medium-food mixture to determine the gastric emptying time of a solid meal. Diazepam has been suspected to delay gastric emptying in cats. One study found diazepam combined with valium to have little effect on gastric transit times in cats while diazepam alone accelerates gastric emptying in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine if diazepam influences gastric emptying times in normal cats. The gastric emptying half-time of solid food in normal, non-diazepam treated cats has been previously determined using a scintigraphic technique using 99mTc-sulfur colloid to radiolabel solid dry food. The median gastric emptying half-time was 2.3 hours and the mean meal size was 16.1 grams. Gastric emptying half-times were determined in this study using diazepam as an appetite stimulant. The median gastric emptying half-times of diazepam treatment groups given both a 16.1 gram meal and a large meal were both significantly longer than the normal non-treated group (P < 0.05). Solid phase gastric emptying is therefore significantly delayed when diazepam is used as an appetite stimulant, irrespective of the volume of the meal.", 
    "12": "The present study was designed to characterize the postjunctional muscarinic receptors mediating contraction in rat anococcygeus muscle by means of a series of muscarinic agonists and subtype-preferring key muscarinic antagonists. Cumulative addition of muscarinic agonists elicited concentration-dependent contractions with the following rank order of potency (pD2 values): (+)-muscarine (6.36) > or = oxotremorine M (6.21) > or = arecaidine propargyl ester (APE) (6.18) > carbachol (5.68) = (+/-)-methacholine (5.65) > 4-(4-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (4-Cl-McN-A-343) (4.28) > 4-(3-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (McN-A-343) (3.89). (+)-Muscarine, oxotremorine M, carbachol and (+/-)-methacholine behaved as full agonists, whereas APE, 4-Cl-McN-A-343 and McN-A-343 displayed partial agonism. The contractile responses of the rat anococcygeus muscle to (+/-)-methacholine were competitively antagonized by pirenzepine (pA2 = 6.92), 11-[[4-[4-(diethylamino)butyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl] 5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3-b) (1,4)-benzodiazepine-6-one (AQ-RA 741; pA2 = 6.75), himbacine (pA2 = 7.11), (+/-)-p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (p-F-HHSiD; pA2 = 7.68) and the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of hexahydro-difenidol [(R)-HHD: pA2 = 8.52; (S)-HHD: pA2 = 6.06]. A comparison of the pA2 values derived from studies of contraction in rat anococcygeus muscle with literature binding (pKi values) and functional affinities (pA2 values) obtained at native M1-M4 receptors strongly suggests that the postjunctional muscarinic receptors mediating contraction in rat anococcygeus muscle are of the M3 subtype.", 
    "13": "We recently developed a simple and fast assay technique, providing the possibility of monitoring of midazolam (M) during sedation. We compared HPLC vs FPIA for the measurement of the sum M plus alpha 1-hydroxymidazolam (OM), its main and pharmacologically active metabolite, in the serum of sedated ICU patients; this activity referred to as M-like. We identified certain patients in whom M-like activity appeared abnormally high in comparison with HPLC assays. Their common denominators were: long-term sedation with M, and seriously impaired renal function. Further, the conjugates of OM (OMG) accumulated in patients with acute renal failure could contribute to the sedation. We compared the metabolic and analytic behavior of M, OM, and OMG in 2 groups of sedated patients either presenting with normal renal functions (group 1) or with a picture of acute renal failure (group 2). Blood samples were assayed by HPLC and by FPIA and analysis was performed before and after hydrolysis of OMG. Before hydrolysis there was a dramatic accumulation of OMG in the patients of group 2, HPLC vs FPIA results were not different within group 1, while in group 2 the FPIA response exceeded that of HPLC. After hydrolysis, measurement by HPLC was greatly increased in group 2, in each group (vs HPLC) and from one group to another, the FPIA signal (the M-like activity) showed a significant increase. It would be important to take OMG into account as a coprotagonist in sedation whenever circumstances predispose to its accumulation.", 
    "14": "1. The ability of 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists to modify the disinhibitory profile of diazepam and other agents was investigated in male BKW mice in the light/dark test box. 2. The 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor antagonists ritanserin, MDL11939 and RP62203 and also methysergide, which failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone, caused dose-related enhancements (4 to 8 fold) in the potency of diazepam to disinhibit behavioural responding to the aversive situation of the test box. 3. Ritanserin was shown to enhance the disinhibitory potency of other benzodiazepines, chlordiazepoxide (4 fold), temazepam (10 fold) and lorazepam (10 fold), the 5-HT1A receptor ligands, 8-OH-DPAT (25 fold), buspirone (100 fold) and lesopitron (500 fold), the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron (100 fold) R(+)-zacopride (100 fold) and S(-)-zacopride (greater than a 1000 fold), the substituted benzamides, sulpiride (10 fold) and tiapride (5 to 10 fold) and the cholecystokinin (CCK)A receptor antagonist, devazepide (100 fold). It also reduced the onset of action of disinhibition following treatment with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor parachlorophenylalanine. Ritanserin failed to enhance the disinhibitory effects of the CCKB receptor antagonist CI-988, the angiotensin AT1 receptor antagonist losarten or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor ceranapril. 4. The 5-HT4 receptor antagonists SDZ205-557, GR113808 and SB204070 caused dose-related reductions in the disinhibitory effect of diazepam, returning values to those shown in vehicle treated controls. The antagonists failed to modify mouse behaviour when administered alone. 5. GR113808 was also shown to cause a dose-related antagonism of the disinhibitory effects of chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, lesopitron, ondansetron, R(+)-zacopride, sulpiride, tiapride, devazepide, CI-988, losarten, ceranapril and parachlorophenylalanine. 6. It was concluded that in BKW mice (a) the failure of 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists when administered alone to modify behaviour in the light/dark test indicates an absence of an endogenous 5-HT tone at the 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 receptors and (b) the enhancement by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists and attenuation by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonists of drug-induced disinhibition indicates a plurality of 5-HT receptor involvement in the mediation of drug-induced disinhibitory profiles in the mouse.", 
    "15": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) respond with exaggerated pressor responses of central origin in response to pharmacologic stimulation of brain muscarinic receptors when compared with those to normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. At least part of the enhanced response to central muscarinic stimulation may be due to alterations in the expression of one or more of the five subtypes of muscarinic receptors. SHR are also known to exhibit regional alterations in the levels of mRNA encoding the M1, M2 and M4 receptors. In this study, we estimated the number of specific muscarinic receptor binding sites in 12-week-old SHR and WKY by measuring the binding of M1- and M2-selective ligands. Using standard autoradiographic techniques, coronal sections obtained from 12-week-old SHR and WKY were incubated with [3H]pirenzepine or [3H]AFDX 384 to label M1 and M2 receptors, respectively. Although both strains exhibited similar distribution patterns for both binding sites, sections derived from SHR expressed a significant increase in the number of [3H]pirenzepine binding sites compared to normotensive WKY in caudate putamen, CA3 region of the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, substantia nigra, posterior hypothalamic area and tuberomammillary nucleus. An increased number of [3H]AFDX 384 binding sites in SHR were observed in the olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens, basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, rostroventrolateral medulla and nucleus paragigantocellularis. Decreases in the number of [3H]AFDX 384 binding sites in SHR were also observed in the parietal cortex, medial geniculate, and lateral hypothalamic area. Statistically significant site-selective differences in binding densities between strains ranged from 4.0% to 35.5% of WKY means. These alterations in the expression of M1 and M2 binding sites in cardiovascular regions may contribute to the strain's hyper-responsiveness to cholinergic drugs and possibly to the appearance of other autonomic or behavioral phenotypes exhibited by SHR, including the hypertensive state itself.",

    "17": "Subjects were assessed on admission and discharge. DSM-III-R diagnoses for major depression and anxiety disorders were established using CIDI-Auto; comorbid anxiety disorders were coexistent in time with the major depression, with both conditions meeting diagnostic criteria at the time of assessment. Severity of illness was assessed using the Hamilton Depression/Melancholia Scale, the revised Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the revised Beck Depression Inventory.", 
    "18": "For the analysis, the study cohort was divided into three groups: depression alone (n = 33), one comorbid anxiety disorder (n = 15), and two or more comorbid anxiety disorders (n = 24). No particular anxiety disorder predominated. Interestingly, the presence or absence of comorbid anxiety with severe major depression made no significant difference to treatment choice or outcome results. Specifically, there was no significant difference between the three groups in the utilisation of electroconvulsive therapy and pharmacotherapy (including antidepressants, benzodiazepines and neuroleptics); all subjects improved significantly on both depression and anxiety ratings, and length of inpatient stay did not vary significantly between the three groups.", 
    "19": "The existence of comorbid anxiety disorders in those patients who presented for treatment of a primary major depressive episode did not significantly effect choice of treatment or treatment outcome, suggesting that there is a close interrelationship between the two conditions.", 
    "20": "Naltrexone hydrochloride is the first medication approved in the United States for the treatment of alcohol dependence in almost 50 years. This study was designed to collect safety data in a setting that reflected the expected clinical use of naltrexone.", 
    "21": "This was a 12-week, nonrandomized, open-label usage study conducted in 40 alcoholism treatment centers throughout the United States, including free-standing alcoholism treatment programs, university clinics, Veterans Administration hospitals, and office-based primary care practices. Eligible patients were assigned, at the investigators' discretion, to a naltrexone treatment group or to a reference group that did not receive study medication. At study entry, patients must have been abstinent from alcohol for 1 to 6 weeks and enrolled in a psychosocial treatment program for alcoholism. Patients often underrepresented in controlled clinical trials, including women and patients with comorbid medical and psychiatric illness, were eligible. Patients with polysubstance abuse or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus were not excluded.", 
    "22": "Of 865 patients enrolled, 570 received naltrexone and 295 were in a reference group. The most common new-onset adverse clinical events in the naltrexone group were nausea (9.8%) and headache (6.6%). Naltrexone was discontinued in 15.0% of patients because of adverse events, most frequently nausea. The results of liver function tests in the naltrexone group were similar to those in the reference group. No death occurred during the study.", 
    "23": "This is the largest study to date describing the safety of naltrexone in a heterogeneous population of persons with alcoholism. No new safety concerns were identified.", 
    "24": "Data obtained from animal and human brain imaging studies indicate that frontal cortex and medial temporal lobe are involved in experiencing and controlling fear and anxiety. We tested the hypothesis that benzodiazepine receptor binding is decreased in the left temporal pole and increased in the right prefrontal area among patients suffering from anxiety. We studied 10 drug-naive female patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and 10 age- and gender-matched healthy controls with MRI and with SPET by using a new (123)I-labelled specific benzodiazepine receptor radioligand, NNC 13-8241. Blindly analyzed results showed that the benzodiazepine receptor binding of [(123)I]NNC 13-8241 was significantly decreased in the left temporal pole among patients with GAD when compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. This hemispheric asymmetry was studied further with a fractal analysis of the SPET images. The fractal dimension of the left hemispheric benzodiazepine receptor binding in patients with GAD was significantly higher than that of controls (1.28 +/- 0.09 and 1.17 +/- 0.07, respectively), whereas the intercept was decreased by 43 +/- 23% reflecting more homogeneous cerebral benzodiazepine receptor density distribution in patients with GAD. The finding is analogous to the decreased heterogeneity of myocardial blood flow observed in patients with ischemic heart disease. The results are consistent with the general hypothesis that high regional heterogeneity of perfusion, metabolism and receptor density is necessary to maintain adaptation ability in the living organism.", 
    "25": "At critical doses of PCP (10 mg/kg i.p. in the present studies), locomotor stimulation in mice is initially suppressed by short-lasting ataxia, albeit at higher levels of activity than controls. This provides a time-activity baseline of PCP-stimulated locomotion potentially sensitive to i) pharmacological antagonism indicated by a change in the time-activity relationship to that seen at lower PCP doses, ii) interaction with the ataxic phase resulting in further decreases in activity similar to that seen at higher PCP doses and iii) reductions in activity without a change in the time-activity relationship. This baseline was explored using three manipulations employed in the clinical management of PCP toxicity: treatment with a neuroleptic (haloperidol), a benzodiazepine (chlordiazepoxide) and modification in environmental stimulation (changing of lighting conditions). Both haloperidol (0.125-0.5 mg/ kg, i.p.) and chlordiazepoxide (5-20 mg/kg i.p.) further reduced activity during the ataxic phase of the PCP time-activity relationship qualitatively similar to the effects of pentobarbital (20-40 mg/kg i.p.). Changing of lighting conditions from red to white light resulted in significant reductions in levels of activity of PCP-treated animals but no change in the time-activity relationship. No manipulation resulted in true reversal of the PCP induced time-activity relationship. The results parallel the clinical findings that neuroleptic and benzodiazepine administration have no specific effects upon PCP-intoxication and that environmental manipulation may modify the degree of PCP stimulation. The time-activity baseline described may prove useful in the evaluation of the effects of pharmacological and non-pharmacological manipulations of PCP-induced activity in rodents.", 
    "26": "Two experiments examined dose-related effects of 200, 400 and 600 micrograms scopolamine (n = 24, s.c.) and 5 and 10 mg diazepam (n = 6, PO) on parallel tests of visual memory and learning taken from the CANTAB battery. Scopolamine significantly impaired accuracy of performance on a delayed matching to sample test of visual recognition memory in a dose- and delay-dependent manner, but had only marginal decremental effects on a test of visuospatial paired associates learning. Scopolamine significantly lengthened decision times in a visual search matching to sample task at the 400 and 600 micrograms doses, without significantly affecting accuracy. The drug also impaired performance on tests of spatial (on accuracy and response time measures) and pattern (on response time only) memory. Most of the deleterious effects on scopolamine were removed by covariance analyses with indices of subjective sedation, but the effects of delayed matching accuracy and latency remained. By contrast, diazepam significantly impaired paired associates learning but affected delayed matching to sample in a delay-independent manner. These results suggest that scopolamine can produce selective deficits in tests of short-term visual recognition memory which do not depend on overall impairments in arousal and which contrast with deficits in visual associative learning produced by diazepam. They have implications for the pharmacological modelling of dementia and memory disorders in man and for the neurochemical substrates of the short-term recognition memory and associative learning for visual stimuli.", 
    "27": "Endogeneously occurring neuroactive steroids, metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, have been shown previously to interact with the GABAA receptor with great specificity in vitro and to have anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and sedative activity in vivo. However, these endogenously occurring steroids are not useful as therapeutic agents due to their potential metabolism to hormonally active steroids and their poor oral bioavailability. In an attempt to develop therapeutic agents which would maintain the pharmacological profiles of endogeneous neuroactive steroids but with increased oral bioavailability and reduced metabolic liability, we explored simple substitutions at the 3 beta-position of the endogenous neuroactive steroid, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-P). This report describes part of the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of a 3 beta-substituted analog, 3 beta-ethenyl-3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (Co 3-0593). The compound exhibited anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetrazol-induced seizures in mice and rats (ED50 = 5.6 and 11.5 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). Co 3-0593 showed robust anxiolytic effects, comparable to benzodiazepines in the Geller-Seifter test after both SC and oral administration. Furthermore, the anxiolytic activity was maintained after chronic administration suggesting an absence of tolerance. The compound did not affect the acquisition of a learned response at both anticonvulsant and anxiolytic doses. However, at higher doses the compound showed rotorod deficit which was further enhanced by ethanol. In summary, 3 beta-ethenyl-substituted 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P appeared to maintain the pharmacological activities of the endogenous neuroactive steroid with apparent oral activity.", 
    "28": "Drug reinforcement may represent the primary behavioral-pharmacological mechanism underlying two types of problematic use of benzodiazepines--recreational abuse by polydrug abusers and inappropriate chronic use by patients. High dose polydrug abuse for the purpose of getting high is readily recognized as a significant social problem. Inappropriate chronic benzodiazepine use is more subtle but relatively common: for anxiolytics, 36% of past-year users (3% of the adult population in the US) report using these drugs for 4 consecutive months or longer. The risks of such long-term use are much better documented than the benefits. This paper provides a current review of various problems that have been identified with the long-term use and the recreational abuse of benzodiazepines, including memory impairment, risk of accidents, falls and hip fractures in the elderly, a withdrawal syndrome, brain damage, overuse in the elderly, overuse by chronic pain patients, overuse by alcoholics and recreational abuse among alcoholics and polydrug abusers. A comprehensive review of the literature on benzodiazepine reinforcing effects in humans and laboratory animals is also provided. Drug self-administration studies in humans and laboratory animals provide models of both types of problematic benzodiazepine use. Recreational abuse of benzodiazepines has been modeled in human research with polydrug abusers and in laboratory animal studies, which show that the reinforcing effect of benzodiazepines is intermediate relative to other sedative compounds and is increased in subjects with histories of previous sedative drug self-administration. The problem of inappropriate long-term use of benzodiazepines by people without histories of drug abuse has been partially modeled in human studies showing that benzodiazepines function as reinforcers in subjects with anxiety, insomnia, and histories of moderate alcohol consumption, and in preclinical studies showing stable, low-rate benzodiazepine self-injection with concurrent physical dependence under conditions of continuous availability. Both human and animal research suggests that the drug history and current behavioral context may be important in the establishment of benzodiazepines as reinforcers. Limited human and animal research provides little support for the common belief that physical dependence enhances benzodiazepine reinforcement.", 
    "29": "A series of new 5-substituted tricyclic 5,10-dihydro-11H-dibenzo[b,e][1,4]-diazepin-11-ones was identified as potential antiarrhythmic agents against bradyarrhythmias [1, 2]. The in vitro and in vivo interactions of the compounds with muscarinic receptors and the antiarrhythmic activity were examined. In receptor binding studies some derivatives showed a high affinity to the cardiac M2 receptor (Ki 10 nmol/l), an equal or smaller affinity to cortical M1 receptor and a lower affinity to the glandular M3 binding site. Functional experiments showed the derivatives as competitive antagonists with high affinity to the cardiac and smaller affinity to the intestinal muscarinic receptor. In vivo experiments correspond with the M2 selectivity. First the vagal or agonist-induced bradycardia was inhibited in rats and guinea pigs while the McNA-343 induced increase of blood pressure, methacholine-induced bronchi and bladder constriction as well as the salivation were inhibited only at higher doses. In conscious cats the tachycardia was examined in comparison with pupillomotoricity. The effect duration and the therapeutical range were determined in comparison to the M2 selective blocking agent AF-DX116. The antiarrhythmic activity was examined compared to quinidine sulfate in CaCl2-arrhythmia of rats, in atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in dogs according to Scherf [2] and in electric induced atrial fibrillation under vagal stimulation in cats. In the atrial arrhythmias the derivatives are clearly longer effective than quinidine sulfate. The antiischemic activity was examined in the two-stages coronary ligature in dogs according to Harris. The long-running regularization of ectopies (about 2 h after i.v. injection) occurred without decrease of the heart rate, an effect particularly convenient to therapy of bradycardic dysrhythmias.", 
    "30": "Benzodiazepine discontinuation is characterized by a syndrome of increased activity and reduced seizure threshold that is similar to effects mediated by the glutamatergic system. To elucidate the involvement of the glutamatergic system in benzodiazepine tolerance and discontinuation, we administered lorazepam, the NMDA antagonist CPP, and the combination of these compounds either concomitantly or consecutively to mice via osmotic pumps and evaluated pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure threshold, open-field activity, and benzodiazepine receptor binding during and after chronic administration. Animals receiving lorazepam alone developed partial tolerance at 7 days and complete tolerance at 14 days to the anticonvulsant effects of lorazepam. This effect was partly attenuated by CPP coadministration with lorazepam. This combination produced only partial tolerance. A reduction in seizure threshold was observed 4 days after discontinuation of lorazepam alone. This effect was abolished by coadministration of CPP with lorazepam and by CPP administration during the withdrawal period. Benzodiazepine binding in most structures examined was significantly reduced at 14 days during chronic lorazepam administration (versus 1 day), and coadministration of CPP did not alter this decrement. After lorazepam discontinuation, binding was increased at 4 and 7 days versus chronically treated animals and versus vehicle within the cerebral cortex. This effect was abolished by coadministration of CPP as well as by CPP administration during the lorazepam withdrawal period. These data support the involvement of the glutamatergic system in benzodiazepine tolerance and discontinuation.", 
    "31": "Accidental or suicidal poisonings due to benzodiazepines have been previously reported. A case of fatal, homicidal poisoning with benzodiazepines, antipyretic analgesics (anti-inflammatory drugs), and beer is described here. In this homicidal poisoning, the drugs and beer were given to the decedent by his wife. Autopsy findings showed no clinically significant macroscopic findings except for slight postmortem change. Capillary gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was employed to quantitate the drugs in biological fluids and stomach contents. Six drugs (brotizolam, triazolam, ibuprofen, dihydrocodeine, phenylpropanolamine, and chlorpheniramine) were identified and quantitated in blood, urine, and stomach contents. Although each drug was present in a very small quantity, the cause of death was determined to be the combination of these drugs and alcohol poisoning.", 
    "32": "Three commercial immunoassay systems (EMIT, EPIA, Online) for the screening of benzodiazepines in urine were evaluated using authentic patient samples with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as the reference method. The Online system (kinetic interaction of microparticles in solution) gained in performance by applying a 100-ng/mL cutoff limit and by incorporating beta-glucuronidase treatment, which could be automated on the Cobas Mira Plus instrument. When using enzymatic hydrolysis, all three immunoassay systems had high levels of sensitivity, including samples containing only flunitrazepam and nitrazepam metabolites. A high degree of concordance was observed between the Online and FPIA (fluorescence polarization immunoassay) systems when analyzing 138 randomly selected patient samples. The EMIT II and EMIT d.a.u. (enzyme multiplied immuno technique) systems gave a higher number of positive results, but the presence of benzodiazepines could not be verified by GC-MS in a substantial number of these cases. The rate of unconfirmed positive results was increased when enzyme hydrolysis was incorporated in the EMIT II assay. Although differences in the performances of the investigated assay systems were observed, they all seem appropriate for clinical use in detecting benzodiazepine intake in drug abusers when enzymatic hydrolysis is included.", 
    "33": "Alcohol withdrawal is a common problem encountered by emergency physicians, with delirium tremens (DT) as the extreme manifestation. DT is a true medical emergency. Although benzodiazepines are the mainstay of therapy, some patients require massive amounts to control their symptoms. We report the successful use of propofol for DT refractory to benzodiazepines in a 42-year-old alcoholic man. We briefly discuss alcohol withdrawal, as well as the pharmacokinetics and adverse affects of propofol. The use of propofol in treating DT refractory to benzodiazepines has previously not been reported.", 
    "34": "A double-blind test battery was administered to 24 human subjects (8 control, 16 drug) to assess the effects of 0.125 mg triazolam (oral) on memory encoding and retention across delay intervals ranging from seconds to 1 week after presentation. Although the drug reduced immediate psychomotor performance, it did not impair recall of previously learned information, nor did it significantly impair encoding of new information. The drug enhanced immediate recall of the location and identity of playing cards, without affecting 4-h delayed recall. The drug treatment impaired correct recall of object names after a delay of 20 min. At 4 h delay, the drug impaired olfactory recognition and free-recall of object names. At both 1 day and 1 week delay, the drug impaired recall of biographical information and correct identification of picture-photographer pair associations. The drug also impaired the daily improvement of the drug group as compared with the control group in a geometric puzzle solving task. The time course of these memory impairments compares well with the known effects of triazolam on long-term potentiation (LTP), a candidate biological mechanism underlying telencephalic memory formation and expression.", 
    "35": "Systemically administered kainate (10 mg.kg-1) caused neuronal loss in both the hippocampus and the entorhinal regions of the rat brain. This resulted in a loss of 68.3 +/- 13.8 and 53.3 +/- 12.8% of pyramidal neurones in the hippocampal CA1 and CA3a regions, respectively. Chlormethiazole attenuated the loss of neurones in the hippocampal cell layers CA1 (cell loss 10 +/- 3.2%) and CA3a (cell loss 10 +/- 7.7%). The neuroprotective activity of chlormethiazole was apparent in the presence or absence of a low dose of clonazepam (200 micrograms.kg-1 i.p.). The kainate-induced damage could also be measured by the increase in binding of the peripheral benzodiazepine ligand ([3H]PK11195) in the hippocampus. In kainate-treated rats there was a 350-500% increase in binding indicative of reactive gliosis. Chlormethiazole prevented this elevation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with an ED50 of 10.64 mg.kg-1 and an effective therapeutic window from 1 to 4 h posttreatment. Dizocilpine also attenuated damage significantly. The GABAA agonist muscimol was also able to attenuate the increase in [3H]PK11195 binding in a dose-dependent manner, with an ED50 of approximately 0.1 mg.kg-1. If muscimol, dizocilpine, or the adenosine A1 receptor agonist R-N6-phenylisopropyl-adenosine were administered together with chlormethiazole at their respective ED25 doses, a potentiation was apparent in the degree of neuroprotection. It is concluded that the combination of neuroprotective agents with different mechanisms of action can lead to a synergistic protection against excitotoxicity.", 
    "36": "Flurazepam is a benzodiazepine (BZD) derivative and a category IV controlled substance. It is a widely prescribed hypnotic drug for use in sleep disorders. Two dogs were maliciously poisoned with this drug and died. Flurazepam was detected in the urine of 1 dog by thin-layer chromatography. Flumazenil, an antagonist for BZD receptors, is currently used in humans to reverse the effects of intoxication with BZD. It may also be of use in treating companion animals.", 
    "37": "Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) depends on gonadal hormones produced by the corpus luteum. Given the facilitory actions on GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission exerted by certain progesterone metabolites, further studies on the GABAA receptor system in premenstrual syndrome are warranted. This study evaluated the benzodiazepine sensitivity in PMS patients and control subjects, using saccadic eye velocity (SEV) and visual analogue ratings of sedation as dependent measures. PMS patients displayed a significantly reduced SEV responsiveness to benzodiazepines compared to control subjects in the follicular phase, whereas there was no difference between groups in the luteal phase. In the luteal phase, the sedation response to benzodiazepines was significantly reduced in PMS patients compared to control subjects. There was also an influence of PMS symptom severity on these measures, as high-severity PMS patients displayed blunted SEV and sedation responses to benzodiazepines compared to low-severity patients. These results indicate that PMS patients have a reduced functional sensitivity at the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex throughout the menstrual cycle.", 
    "38": "Using [11C]flumazenil-PET and statistical parametric mapping (SPM), we have shown recently that regions of increased and decreased benzodiazepine receptor density may be seen in patients with localization-related epilepsy due to malformations of cortical development. These abnormalities were seen both within and beyond lesions visually apparent on high-resolution MRI. We have also shown, using an interactive anatomical segmentation technique and volume-of-interest measurements, that subtle and unsuspected abnormalities of cortical grey matter volume were found in the same group of patients on high-resolution MRI, beyond the lesions visually apparent. In 10 patients with localization-related epilepsy and malformations of cortical development, we have now applied the automated and objective technique of SPM to the analysis of high-resolution structural MRI. Each individual patient was compared with 16 normal control subjects. We have then simultaneously compared the structural and functional data obtained for each individual patient with normal control high-resolution MRI and [11C]flumazenil-PET image using a novel technique. This comparison allowed the detection of functional abnormalities that were not accounted for by either visible or unsuspected structural abnormalities, in an automated and statistically rigorous manner. Five patients had abnormalities of cortical grey matter volume detected using SPM; only these five patients had been found abnormal using the previous volume-of-interest technique. Six of the 10 patients showed regions of cerebral cortex with disproportionate flumazenil binding compared with local grey matter volume. This included regions not found to have abnormal flumazenil binding on analysis of the PET data alone. Furthermore, regions found to have abnormal binding on examination of the PET data alone were, in some instances, shown to be accounted for by abnormalities of cortical grey matter volume. We conclude that the analysis of ligand PET data should always include a comparison with structural MRI; such comparisons are greatly facilitated by the novel approach described.", 
    "39": "Gastrin stimulates rat stomach enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells via activation of cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptors. The stimulation is manifested in the activation of the histamine-forming enzyme histidine decarboxylase and in the secretion of histamine and pancreastatin, a chromogranin A-derived peptide. We have examined the short-term effects of three novel cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor antagonists (YF476, JB93182 and AG041R) on the ECL cells in intact fasted rats. The drugs and/or gastrin were infused intravenously for 3 hr and the oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity and the serum pancreastatin concentration were measured. We also studied the effects of the three drugs on gastric emptying in mice, a cholecystokinin-A receptor-mediated response. YF476, JB93182 and AG041R antagonized the gastrin-evoked histidine decarboxylase activation in a dose-dependent manner. YF476, JB93182 and AG041R induced maximal inhibition at 0.03, 0.1 and 0.1 mumol kg-1 hr-1, respectively; the corresponding ID50 values were 0.002, 0.008, and 0.01 mumol kg-1 hr-1. YF476 was selected for further analysis. It produced a rightward shift of the gastrin dose-response curve, consistent with competitive inhibition. Moreover, it antagonized the omeprazole-evoked histidine decarboxylase activation and the gastrin- and omeprazole-induced rise in the circulating pancreastatin concentration. None of the three drugs tested inhibited gastric emptying or prevented the cholecystokinin-8s-induced inhibition of gastric emptying at the doses tested. The results show that YF476, JB93182 and AG041R are potent and selective cholecystokinin-B/ gastrin receptor antagonists, and that YF476 is 4-5 times more potent than JB93182 and AG041R.", 
    "40": "Ras-transformed cells often show high levels of expression of activating protein-1 and Ets and of genes regulated by these transcription factors. In analogy with the effects of transient stimulation of Ras, it is assumed that the increase in transcription-factor transactivation in stably transformed cells is due to Ras-induced constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. However, this has not been extensively studied. Using specific substrate peptides, we have examined here the activities of two types of mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), in [Val12]Ras-transformed rat embryo fibroblast cell lines. These activities were elevated 2-3-fold in Ras-transformed cells compared with non-transformed cells with a similar growth rate. Increased ERK activity was not necessarily accompanied by a similar increase in JNK activity. In transformed cells, ERK and JNK activities could be stimulated fourfold and ninefold by phorbol ester and ultraviolet-light treatment, respectively, indicating that only a fraction of these enzymes were constitutively activated in these cells. It has been suggested that inactive JNK downregulates c-Jun transcriptional activity by binding to the c-Jun delta-domain. No decrease in delta-inhibitor activity could be demonstrated in Ras-transformed cells compared with control cells, consistent with the presence of mainly inactive JNK in transformed cells. Treatment of transformed cells wih benzodiazepine 5B, an inhibitor of Ras farnesylation, decreased ERK and JNK activities, and concomitantly caused morphological reversion, reduced growth rate, and normalization of transformation-related gene expression. We conclude that in stably Ras-transformed cells the moderately increased ERK/JNK activities are not coregulated, and that ERK rather than JNK activity correlated with transformation-related gene expression.", 
    "41": "The essential criteria of internal validity have not been sufficiently evaluated for any mania rating scale, although the fulfillment of such criteria is a prerequisite for summing the item scores to give a total score reflecting the severity of mania, and for comparing total scores across patient groups that differ with regard to variables such as age and sex. This study investigated the internal validity of the Bech-Rafaelsen Mania Scale (MAS), based on the ratings of 100 consecutively admitted drug-free DSM-III-R manic patients. Application of logistic latent structure models did not statistically confirm the additivity of the MAS. However, a modified MAS (the MAS-M) arising from the analyses fulfilled the measurement model. Transferability of the MAS-M across age and sex was also confirmed. The MAS-M showed an acceptable concurrent validity and an adequate sensitivity in discriminating between responders and non-responders among patients participating in a drug trial. The MAS-M presented here is the first mania rating scale that has been shown to fulfil statistical criteria for internal validity.",

    "43": "A retrospective study compared the course of alcohol withdrawal, including delirium tremens, in women and men hospitalized in the Nowowiejski Hospital in Warsaw from 1973 to 1987. Medical records pertaining to 1179 patients were analyzed; 13.8% of these patients were women and 86.2% were men. The study showed that women began intensive alcohol drinking later than men (p < 0.0001), but the period between the onset of alcohol abuse and the first occurrence of alcohol withdrawal was shorter in women than in men (p < 0.0001). In the period of heavy drinking before hospitalization, women consumed significantly less alcohol then men (p < 0.0001); moreover, women drank nonbeverage alcohol less frequently than men (p < 0.05). Women were hospitalized substantially longer than men (p < 0.0001), whereas the duration of alcohol withdrawal symptoms at the time of hospitalization was comparable in both groups. Withdrawal seizures were significantly more frequent among men than among women (p < 0.001). Significant differences in the patients' somatic conditions were not noted between the groups, with the exception of anemia and decreased potassium concentration, which were more frequently observed in women (both p < 0.0001), and of increased concentration of ALT and hypoproteinemia, which were more frequent in men (respectively, p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Co-existing personality disorders, depressive disorders, and anxiety disorders--as well as abuse of benzodiazepines and barbiturates--were more frequently observed in women (p < 0.0001). The period between the first hospitalization due to alcohol withdrawal and the time of death was significantly shorter in men than in women (p < 0.05). The results point to differences in the conditions and the course of alcohol dependence and alcohol withdrawal between women and men.", 
    "44": "The combination of midazolam and nitrous oxide is commonly used to achieve sedation and analgesia during pediatric oral procedures, yet there are few, if any, data that illustrate the ventilatory effects of N2O in children, especially when used in combination with additional central nervous system (CNS) depressants. It was hypothesized that the addition of N2O inhalation to oral midazolam premedication would enhance the sedative effects of the midazolam and add analgesia without causing significant respiratory depression. The purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis.", 
    "45": "Thirty-four healthy children about to undergo restorative dental treatment under general anesthesia were premedicated with oral midazolam, 0.7 mg/kg, and were then exposed to 40% N2O for 15 minutes after a 5-minute control period. The effect of adding N2O on SpO2, respiratory rate, PETCO2, VT, and VT/TI was examined and the levels of consciousness (conscious vs deep sedation) before and during N2O inhalation were determined.", 
    "46": "During the course of the study, no child developed hypoxemia (SpO2 < 92%) nor clinically significant upper airway obstruction. Four children who did not develop hypoventilation (defined as PETCO2 > 45 mm Hg) during the control period did so after initiation of N2O. Overall, there were no significant differences in SpO2, PETCO2, VT, or VT/TI between the control and study periods. However, respiratory rates were significantly higher in the first 10 minutes of N2O inhalation when compared with the control period. Before starting N2O administration, 14 children were not clinically sedated, 19 children met the criteria for conscious sedation, and one child met the criteria for deep sedation. At the end of 15 minutes of N2O inhalation, 12 children were not clinically sedated, 17 children met the definition of conscious sedation, three were deeply sedated, and one child had no response to IV insertion, implying a state of general anesthesia. There were no differences in sedation scores between the control and study periods (P = .6). Overall, seven children had an increase in their sedation score while breathing N2O, four had a decrease in their sedation score, and 22 had no change.", 
    "47": "The addition of 40% N2O to oral midazolam, 0.7 mg/kg, did not result in clinically meaningful respiratory depression nor upper airway obstruction, but did, in some children, cause an increase in the level of sedation beyond simple conscious sedation.", 
    "48": "Electrophysiological studies are often distressing for patients. We devised a regime of continuous infusion of midazolam and fentanyl during electrophysiological studies without the presence of a specialist anaesthetist. The effects on key hemodynamic and respiratory variables and level of sedation were evaluated in detail in the first 775 patients. The safety of this practice was evaluated in 1,344 consecutive patients. Doses were calculated according to patients' weight and age. A mean total dose of 26 mg of midazolam and 115 mcg of fentanyl were infused. Satisfactory sedation was achieved in 97% of patients. The mean duration of procedure was 188 +/- 90 minutes. Complete amnesia of the procedure was obtained in 87% of patients. Sedation caused clinically insignificant changes in respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, end-tidal CO2 and blood pressure. There were no major complications related to sedation. Upper airway obstruction, usually minor, occurred in 42% and some restlessness in 20% of sedated patients. The assistance of a specialist anesthetist was required in 0.3% of sedated patients for management of restlessness, hypoventilation, or obstructive sleep apnea. The amount of distress experienced by sedated patients (n = 775) was significantly less compared to a previous series of nonsedated patients (n = 775) undergoing electrophysiological studies (P < 0.001). The degree of distress experienced by patients during electrophysiological studies can be reduced significantly by sedation with intravenous midazolam and fentanyl. Continuous infusion is an efficient, safe, and effective way of administering midazolam and fentanyl.", 
    "49": "Many clinicians are confronted by the use of illicit drugs on a daily basis. The unsanctioned use of opioids, psychostimulants, benzodiazepines, alcohol and nicotine is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Multiple factors have inhibited the scientific study of these agents including prohibition, public denial and lack of commercial interests. In dealing with problems related to these drugs, clinicians need a scientific understanding of their pharmacology, quantifiable effects and potential adverse effects. Illicit drug users select drugs with particular pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic properties. Generally, rapid absorption, rapid entry into the central nervous system, high bioavailability, short half-life, small volume of distribution and high free drug clearance are pharmacokinetic characteristics which predict a high potential for harmful use because these factors increase positive reinforcement. Drug users adapt the method and route of drug administration to optimise the delivery of the drug to the brain while attempting to maximise the bioavailability of the drug. Inhalation and smoking are the routes of administration which allow the most rapid delivery of drug to the brain, while intravenous injection maximises the bioavailability of an administered drug. Each route of administration results in attendant complications related to mucosal damage, carcinogenesis and risk of infection. Negative reinforcement or withdrawal is a major drive to recurrent use. Many illicit drugs have pharmacological features that promote dependence, including long half-life, low free drug clearance and sufficient drug exposure to allow development of tolerance. The preventive or reductive pharmacotherapeutics of illicit drug use makes use of several subsets of agents: those which act on the same receptor or system as the illicit drug (such as methadone), those which produce an adverse reaction on consumption of the illicit drug (such as disulfiram) and those which symptomatically attenuate illicit drug withdrawal symptoms (such as clonidine). Many new agents are being trialled as potential preventive or reductive agents. It is important to consider pharmacotherapy as only one potential part of the treatment of illicit drug users. The complications of illicit drug use present many therapeutic challenges. As with all patients consuming multiple drugs, illicit drug users are prone to developing drug interactions. The most common interactions seen in practice are pharmacodynamic in nature, most often due to the additive effects of different drugs on the central nervous system. However, alcohol, cocaine, disulfiram, methadone and tricyclic antidepressants may be involved in important pharmacokinetic interactions. Of these the effect of long term alcohol consumption in increasing the hepatotoxicity of paracetamol and of cytochrome P450 3A microsomal enzyme stimulating drugs in diminishing the efficacy of methadone are the most commonly encountered.",

    "62": "Delirium is an acute confusional state with a fluctuating course. Since the syndrome of delirium is associated with derangements of cognition, attention and level of consciousness, it can cause behaviors that are difficult to manage. Hallucinations, agitation, insomnia and anxiety are common in the delirious patient. Behavioral and pharmacologic interventions can be used while the underlying etiology of delirium is sought. Nonpharmacologic measures include frequent reassurance, environmental cues to reorient the patient and the judicious use of physical restraints. Haloperidol, which has negligible anticholinergic effects, is the drug most often used to treat the symptoms of delirium. Short-acting benzodiazepines may be useful in patients with delirium caused by alcohol withdrawal, but these agents may cause increased agitation in elderly patients and patients with hepatic dysfunction.", 
    "63": "Although drug costs are a small fraction of the total direct costs of treating schizophrenia, managed care has focused on drug acquisition costs as an area of concern. There is pressure to demonstrate by outcome measures that the increased cost of the newer atypical antipsychotics versus traditional neuroleptics is justified. Decision makers want to be convinced that newer, more expensive treatment translates to value. Evidence accumulated to date suggests that the atypical agents are cost-effective. Studies show patients taking atypical antipsychotics have an improved quality of life, are more easily rehabilitated and reintegrated into the community, return to full- or part-time work more often, and prefer the newer agents to conventional antipsychotics. These benefits have been shown in studies of olanzapine versus haloperidol. Just as important, patients taking atypical antipsychotics show decreased medical care resource utilization, which results in cost savings.",

We tested the effect of the non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist LY 300168 (GYKI 53655; E. Lilly) (0.25 or 2.5 mg/kg per dose i.p. x 3 doses vs. vehicle) on AMPA-induced excitotoxic injury in postnatal day 7 (P7) rats. To assess specificity, we tested the effect of LY 300168 (2.5 mg/kg per dose x 3 doses) on NMDA-induced excitotoxic injury. P7 rats received right intrahippocampal injections of either (S)-AMPA (2.5 nmol, n = 67) or NMDA (12.5 nmol, n = 11). Injection of AMPA resulted in right hippocampal atrophy with pyramidal cell loss. LY 300168 treatment produced dose-dependent attenuation of AMPA-induced right hippocampal injury; based on comparisons with left hippocampal volumes, 2.5 nmol AMPA resulted in 42 +/- 3% (mean +/- SEM) right hippocampal volume loss in controls, but only 10 +/- 5% after LY 300168 2.5 mg/kg per dose (P < 0.001; ANOVA). LY 300168 had no effect on NMDA-induced hippocampal injury. The data support the hypothesis that drugs that allosterically regulate AMPA receptor activity can modulate the response of immature brain to AMPA-mediated injury.", 
    "65": "We previously demonstrated that repeated treatment of rats with the standardized extract of Ginkgo biloba leaves, EGb 761, and its bioactive component ginkgolide B (GKB), specifically reduces the ligand binding, and protein and messenger RNA expression of the adrenal mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a key element in the regulation of cholesterol transport, resulting in decreased circulating corticosterone levels. Adrenocortical cells were isolated from rats treated with EGb 761 or GKB and cultured for 2 and 12 days. The effect of ACTH on normal and metabolically labeled cells was examined. Corticosterone levels were measured by RIA, and protein synthesis was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Ex vivo treatment with EGb 761 and GKB resulted, respectively, in 50% and 80% reductions of ACTH-stimulated corticosterone production by adrenocortical cells cultured for 2 days compared with that by cells isolated from saline-treated rats. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that in cells from both control and drug-treated animals, ACTH induced the synthesis, at the same level, of a 29-kDa and pI 6.4-6.7 protein identified as the adrenal steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR). In addition, treatment with EGb 761 and GKB specifically altered the synthesis of seven proteins, including inhibition of synthesis of a 17-kDa, identified as PBR. After 12 days in culture, ACTH-stimulated adrenocortical cell steroid synthesis was maintained, and it was identical among the cells isolated from animals treated with GKB or saline. Under the same conditions, the expression of PBR was recovered, whereas no effect of ACTH on the 29-kDa and 6.4-6.7 pI protein (StAR) or other protein synthesis could be seen. A comparative analysis of the effects of GKB and EGb 761 on adrenocortical steroidogenesis and protein synthesis identified, in addition to the 17-kDa PBR, target proteins of 32 kDa (pI 6.7) and 40 kDa (pI 5.7-6.0) as potential mediators of the effect of EGb 761 and GKB on ACTH-stimulated glucocorticoid synthesis. In conclusion, these results 1) validate and extend our previous in vivo findings on the effect of EGb 761 and GKB on ACTH-stimulated adrenocortical steroidogenesis, 2) demonstrate the specificity and reversibility of EGb 761 and GKB treatment, 3) question the role of the 29-kDa, 6.4-6.7 pI protein (mature StAR) as the sole mediator of ACTH-stimulated steroid production, and 4) demonstrate the obligatory role of PBR in hormone-regulated steroidogenesis.",

The drug was extracted from decomposed human muscle using three-step liquid-liquid extraction and HPLC which was performed isocratically on a conventional ODS column with a mobile phase of 0.01 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.5)-acetonitrile (7:3). Estazolam was used as an internal standard. GC-MS analysis was performed on a DB-5 capillary column. Excellent linearity was obtained over the concentration range 1-200 ng/g.

    "67": "This study retrospectively examines the one-month concomitant use of cytochrome P450 2D6 or 3A4 metabolized medications in 544,309 patients who were also receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Overall, 25.53% of SSRI patients experienced concomitant use with at least one of the 33 studied CYP 2D6 or 3A4 metabolized medications. Certain drugs and drug classes were more likely to be used concurrently among SSRI patients (e.g., benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers). Similarly, of the SSRI patients experiencing concomitant use, this concurrent use was twice as likely with cytochrome P450 medications metabolized by the 3A4 isoenzyme as with those metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme. Finally, the vast majority (80.9%) of SSRI patients experiencing concomitant use did so with one CYP 2D6 or 3A4 metabolized medication. In sum, concomitant use generally was not extensive and did not appear to be differential among the fluoxetine, paroxetine, or sertraline patient comparison groups.", 
    "68": "Inclusion of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) as an anxiety disorder in DSM-i.v. assumes that anxiety is the primary symptom of OCD; however, persuasive empirical evidence in support of this view has not been presented yet. In the present study we hypothesized that provoked anxiety symptoms respond better to intravenous diazepam than would provoked obsessions. We, therefore, reasoned that anxiety symptoms are secondary symptoms of OCD.", 
    "69": "To test the hypothesis we designed a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study. Patients underwent four experimental conditions in which the sequence of symptom provocation and i.v. injection of (placebo or diazepam) were alternated. Baseline and i.v. injection-induced symptom changes were assessed using visual analogs.", 
    "70": "Obsessions and anxiety correlated strongly for all four experimental conditions in which the sequence of the symptom provocation and diazepam i.v. injections was alternated. i.v. diazepam injection before and after symptom provocation failed to preferentially modulate anxiety symptoms over obsessions. Unexpectedly, in the group in which i.v. diazepam injection preceded the symptom provocation, reduction of mean obsessions was even more pronounced.", 
    "71": "Strong correlations between anxiety and obsessions at baseline, during symptom provocation, and after i.v. diazepam infusion suggest that anxiety and obsessions are tightly coupled phenomena in OCD.",

Seventy-one of 93 (76%) patients with a baseline OAA/S score < or = 3 (1 = deep sleep, 5 = alert) experienced an increase of > or = 2 points at 10 minutes after flumazenil administration, and 81 of 93 (87%) had a score of 4 or 5 after flumazenil administration. Seven patients, all within the 1- to 5-year age range, experienced resedation after initially responding to flumazenil. Thirty-seven of 107 patients (35%) experienced a total of 56 adverse events, most of which were considered to be unrelated to flumazenil administration. The most frequently occurring adverse events were abnormal crying, dizziness, nausea, fever, and headache. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or ECG tracings. No adverse events resulted in premature termination of drug administration.",

In seven patients, the CBF and oxygen metabolism were measured by the 50 steady-state method. In two patients, the CBF and glucose metabolism were measured by 99mTc-HMPAO SPECT and 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-PET, respectively. The brain was initially classified into 18 regions, and abnormalities in the BZD receptor distribution, CBF and cerebral metabolism were visually evaluated.

    "83": "A recently introduced technique of [gamma-35S]GTP autoradiography was used to localize and characterize muscarinic receptor-dependent activation of G-proteins in tissue sections of the chick optic tectum, a brain region with relatively high expression of G-protein-coupled receptors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Within the highly stratified tectal structure, the bulk of muscarinic receptor-mediated [gamma-35S]GTP signal was localized to the stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale with considerably lower binding responses in other tectal layers. Quantitative comparison of [gamma-35S]GTP binding responses in tectal sections and membranes revealed a close match between the two tissue preparations for the response elicited by the cholinergic agonist carbachol, its dose-dependent reversal with the non-selective muscarinic antagonist atropine, its approximately 100-fold sensitivity towards blockade with M1-type (pirenzepine) over M2-type (gallamine) muscarinic antagonists, as well as absolute requirement for micromolar concentrations of GDP (EC50 approximately 10 microM) for the receptor-mediated [gamma-35S]GTP response. The pharmacological profile is consistent with that of cm4, a recently cloned chicken homolog of the mammalian m4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. Moreover, the strict GDP-dependence of the binding response suggest activation of Gi/o, the inhibitory class of G-proteins. These data provide the first functional characterization of the chick tectal muscarinic receptors. A close match between [gamma-35S]GTP responses in membranes and tissue sections strongly suggest that [gamma-35S]GTP autoradiography offers great potential for studies on G-protein-mediated signaling, with particular use within anatomically restricted regions that are not readily approached with more conventional techniques. It is anticipated that [gamma-35S]GTP autoradiography should greatly facilitate studies on signaling capacity of an individual receptor subtype whilst in its native cellular environment.", 
    "84": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine sedative-hypnotic which interacts with central benzodiazepine-receptors. To examine its effects on uterine smooth muscle we have compared with those obtained by diltiazem, papaverine and diazepam on different experimental models. The IC50 values obtained indicate similar behaviour of zolpidem and diazepam. They showed more active against the spontaneous contractions and those induced by KCl (60 mM) or by CaCl2 (0.01-10 mM) in Ca(2+)-free depolarizing medium than against acetylcholine (0.1 mM)-induced contractions. Both of them also showed more effectiveness against the tonic component of the acetylcholine-evoked contraction than against the phasic one. All the drugs tested were less powerful against contractions induced by oxytocin than against those induced by other agonists. This observation let us speculate that the mechanism of action of zolpidem may be related to an action on Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels due to an interaction with low affinity receptor located at the plasmalemma as has been suggested for diazepam.", 
    "85": "The effects of chronic corticosterone treatment (100 mg pellet implanted for 1 week) were assessed in animal tests of anxiety, exploration and motor activity, and changes in binding to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, and the 5-HT transporter, were measured. At the end of the week's treatment, the corticosterone concentration was significantly elevated and there were significant decreases in adrenal, thymus and body weights. However, there were no changes in the measures of anxiety in the social interaction test or on trials 1 and 2 of the elevated plus-maze. Also supporting a dissociation between anxiety and elevated corticosterone concentrations are previous findings that benzodiazepine withdrawal causes increased anxiety but no change in corticosteroid concentrations. Therefore these two situations provide a double dissociation between anxiety and elevated corticosteroids. Decreased 5-HT1A receptor binding in the dentate gyrus and increased 5-HT2A receptor binding in the parietal cortex was found following chronic corticosterone treatment. This reciprocal relationship between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors has been proposed to be important in mediating depression. The significant decreases in motor activity observed in all the test situations would be compatible with this proposal. Thus the constellation of behavioural and biochemical changes detected after chronic corticosterone treatment is more pertinent to depression than anxiety. One week after removal of the pellets, the behavioural and neurochemical changes had disappeared and the only differences to remain were decreased adrenal, thymus and body weights in the animals that had been treated chronically with corticosterone.", 
    "86": "The purpose of the present study was to study gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptor function in alcohol-dependent subjects during withdrawal, using the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. In particular, we wanted to examine the hypotheses that an endogenous inverse agonist ligand at the GABA-A benzodiazepine receptor (GBzR) is active during withdrawal (in which case flumazenil should be anxiolytic), or whether chronic alcohol intake results in a shift in sensitivity of the receptor in the inverse agonist direction (in which case flumazenil should be anxiogenic). Results from 15 alcohol-dependent subjects in a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study showed that flumazenil was neither anxiolytic nor anxiogenic, although withdrawal scores were reduced during the course of the study. The fact that flumazenil was not anxiogenic, as it is in panic disorder, suggests that the GBzR is functioning differently in these two clinically similar conditions.", 
    "87": "It is a well-known fact that alcohol affects sex hormone levels in males. Even in the absence of liver dysfunction, there is still a direct toxic effect of ethanol on testosterone synthesis resulting in acutely decreased values. This study is based on 29 male alcoholics without severe signs of liver disease treated on the alcohol detoxification ward at Huddinge hospital in Stockholm, Sweden during 1995. The aim was to study levels of sex hormones in male alcoholics during detoxification with benzodiazepines and after 3 weeks of sobriety. Blood samples were taken three times: one day after admission (day 2) when the patient was sober, at discharge (day 5) and after 3 weeks of sobriety (day 21). Levels of testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) showed the same pattern during detoxification and follow-up. They were both low, but generally within normal limits, on days 2 and 5, but raised after 3 weeks of sobriety. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were initially high, but were substantially depressed during detoxification. Levels of FSH recovered after 3 weeks, whereas LH remained at the same level. Most patients exhibited generally low levels of both FSH and LH, however. Levels of oestrone decreased steadily. There were no correlations between levels of sex hormones and the number of milligrams of oxazepam administered to the patients during detoxification either at admission, at discharge or at follow-up. In summary, the endocrinological response to alcohol intake is complex. This study suggests that the duration of endocrinological recovery after drinking is a quite long-lasting process, that different hormones need different times to recover and that the normal glandular-pituitary feed-back processes may be partly put out of order.", 
    "88": "Treatment of acutely infected human brain cell and enriched microglial cell cultures with diazepam inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) p24 antigen expression. Similarly, diazepam suppressed HIV-1 expression in chronically infected promonocytic (U1) cells and acutely infected monocyte-derived macrophages, and this antiviral activity was associated with decreased activation of nuclear factor kappa B.", 
    "89": "Forty-eight patients undergoing day-case anaesthesia were asked to complete pre- and postoperative tests of psychomotor function in order to study the influence of co-induction with midazolam in conjunction with propofol/alfentanil anaesthesia on postoperative psychomotor recovery. The study was placebo controlled and double blind with patients receiving either 0.03 mg.kg-1 of midazolam or saline 2 min before induction of anaesthesia with propofol and alfentanil. Patients who underwent co-induction with midazolam had significantly impaired concentration and rapidity of response but improved accuracy and vigilance when compared with those who received saline. The study confirmed that co-induction with a subanaesthetic dose of midazolam reduced the induction dose of propofol by up to 50%. We conclude that co-induction with midazolam reduces psychomotor recovery in the immediate postoperative phase following propofol infusion anaesthesia.", 
    "90": "We have studied the inhibitory effects of propofol on the metabolism of midazolam using human liver microsomes. In addition, we also investigated whether the lipid in which propofol is solubilised inhibits the metabolism of midazolam. Only high concentrations of propofol (> 100 mmol), greater than those found in clinical practice, inhibited the metabolism of midazolam. The lipid had no effect on the metabolism of midazolam. This study differs from other laboratory studies looking at the inhibitory effects of propofol. These showed inhibition at concentrations similar to those seen in patients. The reasons for the differences may be explained by the use of different substrates or methodology. Propofol may be an enzyme inhibitor, but this remains to be shown to be important in patients.", 
    "91": "This study was undertaken to determine if the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), is a competitive antagonist of muscarinic receptors in vivo. Cats were anesthetized with pentobarbital (36 mg/kg, i.p.). Five peripheral muscarinic responses were characterized based on their sensitivity to intravenous administration of atropine (1-100 microg/kg), pirenzepine (1-100 microg/kg) or gallamine (30-3000 microg/kg) as follows: (1) muscarinic ganglionic transmission through the superior cervical ganglion to the nictitating membrane (M1), (2) electrically elicited vagal bradycardia (M2), (3) neurally evoked sudomotor responses (M3; non-endothelial), (4) basal pupil tone in sympathectomized cats (M3; non-endothelial) and (5) methacholine-induced depression of arterial blood pressure (M3; endothelial). Additional groups of animals were administered L-NAME (50 mg/kg, i.v.) to determine if this agent would alter activation of these muscarinic systems. L-NAME was devoid of effect on responses elicited by stimulation of muscarinic M1, M2 and M3 (non-endothelial) receptors. In contrast, L-NAME significantly reduced the depressor responses to i.v. methacholine (M3; endothelial), as did its non-alkyl ester congener, L-NA (NG-nitro-L-arginine; 25 mg/kg, i.v.). These results support the conclusion that although L-NAME inhibits synthesis of nitric oxide in vascular endothelial cells, it is not a generalized muscarinic receptor antagonist in vivo.", 
    "92": "The dopamine D4 receptor has been implicated in the therapeutic effects of the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine. As it has been proposed that anxiolytic-like activity may contribute to the efficacy of this agent in ameliorating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, the current study employed ethological methods to fully characterize the acute behavioural profiles of clozapine and two more selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonists, L-745,870 (3-[{4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)]methyl}-1 H-pyrrolo[2,3b]pyridine) and L-741,742 (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)is oxazole), in the mouse elevated plus-maze test. Results showed that while clozapine (0.3-6.0 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited all active behaviours (arm entries, exploration, rearing) and increased grooming and immobility, it failed to alter the major anxiety indices (percent open entries and open time). In contrast, L-745,870 (0.02-1.5 mg/kg) and L-741,742 (0.04-5.0 mg/kg) did not produce any significant behavioural changes under present test conditions. These data, which contrast markedly with the robust anxiolytic profile of the reference compound, chlordiazepoxide (10.0 mg/kg), provide little support for the suggestion that clozapine possesses anxiolytic-like properties and further indicate that selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonists are ineffective in the modulation of anxiety-related behaviours in the plus-maze.", 
    "93": "Neurosteroids bind to unique sites on the GABA(A) receptor complex and modulate receptor function. The effects of neurosteroids on GABA(A) receptors have been well characterized in forebrain regions. However, little is known about their effects on GABA(A) receptors in the medulla, especially those areas involved in autonomic reflex pathways. Stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the GABA(A) receptor by two progesterone metabolites, 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha-OH-DHP) and 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3beta-OH-DHP), was studied using autoradiographic methods in the medulla and cerebellum of female rats at estrus. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding was enhanced by 3alpha-OH-DHP in every nucleus examined in the medulla and cerebellum. This effect was stereoselective since 3beta-OH-DHP had no effect on binding in any region. No differences were observed in the degree of stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 3alpha-OH-DHP among medullary brain regions. However, in the cerebellum, the stimulation of binding was significantly greater in the granular layer than in the molecular layer. Stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 3alpha-OH-DHP in nuclei involved in the baroreflex pathways supports previous studies which report that neurosteroids modulate autonomic regulation of blood pressure. These actions may also underlie alterations in autonomic function during pregnancy.", 
    "94": "Previous studies demonstrated that DBA/2J (DBA) mice performed poorly while C57BL/6J (C57) mice performed normally on a number of complex learning and memory tasks. Chronic oxiracetam treatment dramatically improved the performance of DBA mice but not that of C57 mice on the Morris water task and in contextual fear conditioning. The present study demonstrates that acute treatment with nootropics, oxiracetam (10-1000 mg/kg) or aniracetam (10-100 mg/kg), and N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, (+)-MK-801 (0.1-3 microg/kg), CPP (0.01-0.3 mg/kg), and (+)-HA-966 (0.1-3 mg/kg), administered prior to training and testing, reversed the contextual learning impairment in DBA mice in a dose-dependent manner without affecting auditory cue conditioning. These effects appeared to be independent of testing order (context vs. auditory cue tests) and were not due to state-dependent learning. The inactive stereoisomers, (-)-MK-801 and (-)-HA-966, were incapable of increasing contextual freezing in DBA mice. In DBA mice, the effects of 30 mg/kg oxiracetam and 100 mg/kg aniracetam were inhibited by the (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, NBQX, and GYKI-52466. The combined administration of 30 mg/kg oxiracetam and 1 microg/kg (+)-MK-801 produced an additive response. None of the pharmacological treatments altered performance in C57 mice at doses that were effective in DBA mice. These results suggest that DBA mice may be learning impaired due to altered glutamatergic receptor function.", 
    "95": "We chose five sedatives for premedication and investigated the effect of these drugs on the induction doses of propofol. One hundred patients were allocated into one of five groups of 20. These groups consisted of control group (C) given only atropine 0.5 mg i.m.; CL group (plus clonidine 0.15 mg orally); H group (plus hydroxyzine 25 mg i.m.); M group (plus midazolam 3 mg i.m.) and D group (plus diazepam 10 mg orally). The induction dose was measured using loss of count technique. Arterial pressure and heart rate were measured, before and after propofol induction as well as after intubation. We also calculated rate pressure products (RPP) at each point. The induction doses were significantly lower in M-group than those in C-group. On the other hand, in hemodynamic responses, RPP was unchanged in any groups after propofol induction and after the intubation. Both propofol and midazolam have been known to have a depressive effect on the central nervous system via GABA-A receptor-mediated inhibition, although the exact receptor for propofol is unknown. We thought, therefore, that when the interaction occurred, both midazolam and propofol had the same effect on the GABA-A receptor and increased chloride ion flux through the channels. Hydroxyzine and clonidine, however, do not share a common receptor or exert effect on the GABA-A receptor. We consider that this was one of the reasons why induction doses of both H and CL group could not decrease significantly. We concluded that midazolam 3 mg decreased propofol induction dose significantly. Both midazolam 3 mg and clonidine 0.15 mg decreased RPP before induction and hemodynamic responses to induction and intubation were stable.", 
    "96": "We studied the effects of melatonin and diazepam on eye movement and muscle activity in decerebrate cats, and results were compared with those obtained from carbachol injection into the pontine reticular formation which was supposed to be a model of REM sleep. In precollicular postmammillary decerebrate cats, the horizontal eye movement and the activity of bilateral triceps surae muscles were recorded under three conditions: (1) microinjection of carbachol into the rostral pontine reticular formation; (2) intravenous administration melatonin; and (3) diazepam. Both rapid eye movement and reduction of muscle activity were induced by carbachol injection, while only reduction of muscle activity was induced by diazepam administration. Neither rapid eye movement nor reduction of muscle activity was induced by melatonin administration in this animal preparation. From these results, we speculated that the inhibitory effect of diazepam on muscle tonus was not manifested through activation of the brainstem REM generating system. It is known that the melatonin receptors are located in several sites of central nervous system, such as suprachiasmatic nucleus, and not in the brainstem and spinal cord. The present results of melatonin administration may support this fact in view of behavioral aspects.", 
    "97": "Betotastine besilate (betotastine CAS 125602-71-3, TAU-284) is a novel antiallergic agent with histamine H1 receptor antagonistic activity. As the classical antihistamines are known to produce drowsiness, the present study was conducted to assess a possible influence of betotastine on the central nervous system (CNS). Measurement of the drug concentration in brain and plasma after i.v. administration revealed that betotastine, as well as cetirizine and epinastine, poorly penetrate into the CNS, while terfenadine do so slightly more and ketotifen remarkably more. In vitro receptor binding assays demonstrated that betotastine is a highly specific histamine H1 receptor ligand, having no significant binding affinity for histamine H3, adrenergic alpha 1, alpha 2, beta, dopamine D2L, serotonin 5-HT2, muscarinic, and benzodiazepine receptors. On global behavior of mice, oral administration of betotastine did not produce any marked changes at the doses of 100-1000 mg/kg, but suppressed huddling behavior at 1000 mg/kg and caused slight mydriasis at 300 mg/kg and more. Betotastine did not significantly affect spontaneous motor activity (SMA) and hexobarbital-induced anesthesia in mice up to 300 mg/kg p.o. In the sleep-wakefulness pattern of cats, it reduced the total duration of sleep at 10 mg/kg p.o., but did not show significant effect at 30 and 100 mg/ kg p.o. Cetirizine showed a similar profile as betotastine in these experiments, whereas ketotifen and epinastine induced sedative signs or toxic symptoms in lower doses, and terfenadine affected SMA and the anesthesia at a high dose. These results suggest the very low liability of betotastine to produce sedative side-effect in a therapeutic dose range.", 
    "98": "Wnt genes are involved in tumour growth and regulate cell adhesion. Some (Wnt5a and Wnt7b) are more highly expressed in human breast cancer compared to normal tissues. Wnt5a is involved in the regulation of cell movement in Xenopus and is upregulated in several human cancers. Factors regulating Wnt gene expression in human breast epithelium are poorly understood, but c-erbB2 is amplified in many breast cancers and associated with rapid growth and metastasis, as is high expression of c-Ha-ras. To further understand the regulation of Wnt gene expression, this study investigated the effect of proto-oncogenes c-Ha-ras and c-erbB2, and collagen on Wnt mRNA expression, in a normal spontaneously immortalised human mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Out of nine human Wnt genes investigated, Wnt5a and Wnt7b were expressed in the parental cell line, and neomycin-, c-Ha-ras- and c-erbB2-transfected cell lines. The level of Wnt5a mRNA expression was decreased 40-fold and 3-fold when parental cells were grown on collagen and in collagen, respectively. This downregulation correlated with cell branching. However, Wnt7b was not regulated by collagen. In the presence of activated c-Ha-ras, the level of Wnt5a mRNA expression was markedly decreased (> 200-fold) and cell growth rate was elevated. When treated with p21ras inhibitor, BZA-5B, there was a moderate reversal of Wnt5a mRNA expression (2-fold) with a parallel decrease in cell growth. The data indicate that c-Ha-ras is an upstream inhibitory regulator of Wnt5a, and provide further evidence of an inverse relationship between Wnt5a mRNA expression and cell branching. This demonstrates selectivity of regulation of individual members of the Wnt gene family by the ras pathway. Overexpression of c-erbB2 had no effect on Wnt5a or Wnt7b mRNA expression. Thus, extracellular matrix and ras regulate Wnt5a, providing a mechanism for feedback of morphogenetic movements, which is relevant also to cancer biology.", 
    "99": "Chronic ethanol exposure has been reported to alter NMDA and GABA(A) receptor function and gene expression in brain regions of animals and mammalian cultured cortical neurons. In the present study, we investigated the effects of another model of chronic, but intermittent, ethanol treatment (CIE) on GABA(A) and NMDA receptor systems in cortical neurons. CIE (50 mM ethanol, 12 h exposure/12 h withdrawal, 5 cycles) exposure produced increased [3H]MK-801 binding and diazepam insensitive binding sites as measured by [3H]Ro15-4513 binding to cortical cultured neuronal membranes, at 0 h following the last treatment cycle relative to control neurons. The NMDA mediated increase in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i was also increased following similar CIE treatment. CIE treatment also increased the ability of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) to inhibit GABA mediated 36Cl- influx relative to control neurons. These effects were not reversible following 1 week ethanol withdrawal, implying enhanced sensitivity of PTZ to inhibit GABA(A) receptor mediated inhibition, and an increased NMDA receptor function in CIE treated cortical neurons. These alterations are consistent with the behavioral studies in animals, and suggest that both GABA(A) and NMDA receptors play an important role in ethanol withdrawal following either chronic or CIE exposure. Furthermore, this provides a feasible in vitro model for further biochemical and molecular studies of the mechanism underlying the CIE induced kindling-like phenomenon observed in humans.", 
    "100": "A HPLC method was developed for determination of risperidone and its therapeutically active main metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone in serum. After a single-step liquid-liquid extraction the analytes were separated on a C18 column and measured by UV detection at 280 nm. Inter-day coefficient of variation was <7% for both compounds at serum levels occurring in patients treated with ordinary doses. Studies of analytical interference showed that the most commonly coadministered antidepressants and benzodiazepines did not interfere. Some conventional low dose neuroleptics and clozapine did interfere, but this is of minor importance, because risperidone is intended as an alternative to these drugs.",

Midazolam decreased global CBF by 12% from 39.2 +/- 4.1 to 34.4 +/- 6.1 ml x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) (P < 0.02 at a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 40 mmHg). The rCBF changes in the low-effect group were a subset of the high-effect group. Decreased rCBF (P < 0.001) occurred in the insula, the cingulate gyrus, multiple areas in the prefrontal cortex, the thalamus, and parietal and temporal association areas. Asymmetric changes occurred, particularly in the low-effect group, and were more significant in the left frontal cortex and thalamus and the right insula. Relative rCBF was increased in the occipital areas.",

    "109": "Using statistical parametric mapping and [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) PET we have previously shown reduction of central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZR) binding restricted to the hippocampus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to unilateral hippocampal sclerosis. However, bilateral hippocampal pathology can be present in up to 50% of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Additionally, the limited spatial resolution of PET results in a partial volume effect that affects quantitative analysis of cBZRs and such an effect can mask hippocampal dysfunction. We analysed changes in the [11C]FMZ volume of distribution (FMZ-Vd) before and after correction for partial volume effect in six patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and a quantitative MRI diagnosis of bilateral hippocampal sclerosis, which appeared either symmetrical on MRI (bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis; three patients) or bilateral but asymmetrical (asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis; three patients), and in nine patients with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and unilateral hippocampal sclerosis on MRI than was subsequently histologically verified. Fifteen healthy controls were also studied for comparison. Before correction for partial volume effects, significant unilateral reductions of FMZ-Vd were found in one of the three patients with bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis, in one of the three asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis patients and in six of the nine unilateral hippocampal sclerosis patients. No significant bilateral reductions of hippocampal FMZ-Vd were detected. After correction for partial volume effect, all three patients with bilateral symmetrical hippocampal sclerosis showed significant bilateral reductions of FMZ-Vd, and these were asymmetrical in two. All three patients with asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis and all nine patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis on MRI showed unilateral reductions of FMZ-Vd concordant with the side of the EEG focus. In addition one of the three patients with asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis and three of the nine patients with unilateral hippocampal sclerosis showed significant reductions of FMZ-Vd in the hippocampus contralateral to the side of the EEG focus. Absolute quantification of [11C]FMZ-PET, corrected for partial volume effect, within multiple hippocampal volumes of interest was necessary in order to detect bilateral changes of cBZR in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy due to hippocampal sclerosis with optimal sensitivity. This [11C]FMZ-PET approach was able to demonstrate subtle contralateral abnormalities in one-third of patients thought to have unilateral or bilateral asymmetrical hippocampal sclerosis on MRI. Reduction of cBZR binding was consistently over and above loss of hippocampal volume indicating that atrophy is not the sole determinant of cBZR loss in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy.", 
    "110": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) are expressed in a variety of tissues but are normally found at low levels in the brain. Following various types of nerve injury, a reactive gliosis results that exhibits a high expression of this receptor. To further characterize the expression of PBRs following neuronal injury, we evaluated PBR expression in the facial nucleus following facial nerve axotomy (FNA). Injury to a peripheral nerve results in a complex series of metabolic and morphological changes around the injured neuron. Transections of the facial nerve results in a rapid activation of both astrocytes and microglia around axotomized motor neurons. FNA resulted in an increase in the staining for both astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and activated microglia (OX42). There was also a reduction in synaptic contacts with the motor nucleus as evidenced by reduced staining for the synaptic marker, synaptophysin. In sections labeled with [3H]-PK11195, the subsequent autoradiograms displayed marked increases in the labeling for PBRs. This increase was observed at 5, 7 and 10 days after nerve transection. The increase was primarily in the level of expression (Bmax), with no change in the affinity of the ligand (Kd). The increase in PBR expression after FNA supports the hypothesis that PBRs can be used as a sensitive marker for CNS injury.", 
    "111": "The effects of a chronic treatment with pefloxacin on aminophylline-induced seizures in genetically epilepsy-prone rat have been investigated. Two series of experiments were performed. In the first, animals received pefloxacin orally twice a day for five days, then were administered aminophylline intraperitoneally and the occurrence of seizures was evaluated. In the second series of experiments, theophylline serum concentration was evaluated in rats subject to the same experimental protocol. Pefloxacin significantly, and in a dose-dependent manner, increased the occurrence of seizure phases induced by aminophylline, but did not influence theophylline serum levels measured at different times after the injection of aminophylline. We suggest that additive neurotoxic effects of both pefloxacin and aminophylline might contribute to the increased severity of seizure score. The possible role of GABA-benzodiazepine, excitatory amino acid and purinergic mechanism, and the role of pharmacokinetic factors are discussed.", 
    "112": "The aim of this survey was to review the practice of sedation for adult artificially ventilated patients in Australian intensive care units. In particular, the survey sought to investigate the drugs used, how they were administered, who was responsible for the administration, how sedation was assessed, and if, in the opinion of charge nurses, complications were occurring as a result of their practice. Questionnaires were sent by post to the clinical nurse consultants (CNCs) in charge of 72 units containing five or more beds, as identified in the Hospital Health Services Yearbook. By June 1996, 65 questionnaires had been returned (a 90 per cent response rate). Results showed that the most common form of sedation is a combination of benzodiazepines and narcotics (88 per cent); in particular, morphia (92 per cent) and midazolam (94 per cent). In 79 per cent of units, these drugs are administered by continuous infusion. Neuromuscular blocking agents are no longer commonly used in conjunction with sedation, with the majority of units (88 per cent) indicating occasional use only. Also in the majority of units (94 per cent), nurses are responsible for titrating and administering sedation. The experience of these nurses varied; in 61 per cent of units it ranged from first year post-graduation to the holding of a critical care certificate. In most units (63 per cent), the aim is to lightly sedate patients. Methods of assessing sedation vary, with few units using sedation scales (17 per cent). Twenty six CNCs (40 per cent) reported that, in their opinion, there were no complications related to their practice of sedation. The most common complication reported (by 21 CNCs or 32 per cent) was over-sedation. It appears that there is no consistent method of assessing the level of sedation in critically ill ventilated patients and that over-sedation is common. Therefore, it is recommended that clinicians investigate the possibility of introducing sedation scales in their units. However, the efficacy of such scales in ensuring a more appropriate level of sedation needs to be researched.", 
    "113": "To investigate the influence of cholinergic pathways on somatostatin (SS) tone in type I diabetes mellitus, we studied the effect of the muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine ([PZP] 100 mg orally) on spontaneous nocturnal growth hormone (GH) and thyrotropin (TSH) secretion and on their response to GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) in the morning in a group of nine insulin-dependent diabetic patients with poor diabetic control. When the nocturnal period was divided into two phases (11:00 PM to 2:30 AM and 3:00 AM to 6:00 AM), both GH and TSH mean concentrations during the first phase were higher than those seen in the second half of the night following placebo administration (GH, 13.4 +/- 1.1 v 4.15 +/- 0.9 ng/mL, P < .001; TSH, 1.9 +/- 0.21 v 1.57 +/- 0.1 microU/mL, P < .05). Pretreatment with PZP induced a significant reduction of GH secretion (3.17 +/- 1.1 v 13.4 +/- 1.1 ng/mL, P < .001) and TSH secretion (1.61 +/- 0.21 microU/mL, P < .05) in the first phase of the night, accounting for a 64% and 11% reduction in the GH and TSH nocturnal peak, respectively. PZP reduced the GH response to GHRH in the morning (17.9 +/- 2.7 v 36.7 +/- 6.3 ng/mL, P < .05), but did not induce any change in TSH values at that time. A positive relationship (r = .73, P < .01) was observed between the percent reduction of the GH response to GHRH and that of the nocturnal GH peak following PZP administration. PZP caused a significant reduction in glucose levels during the second phase of the night (6.4 +/- 0.92 v 9.81 +/- 0.85 mmol/L, P < .05). These results demonstrate that administration of PZP reduces GH and TSH secretion, providing further support for the involvement of SS in the inhibition of GH secretion induced by cholinergic antagonists in type I diabetics. The inhibitory effect of PZP on GHRH-induced GH secretion may help to predict nocturnal GH behavior following administration of the drug.", 
    "114": "The aim of the present investigation was to examine benzodiazepine sensitivity in abstinent alcoholics. For this purpose, two escalating doses of the benzodiazepine midazolam were i.v. administered to nine alcohol-dependent patients after 2-3 weeks of abstinence and 12 healthy, non-alcoholic volunteers. A variety of dependent measures were examined, including the power spectrum of the resting electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked EEG responses, saccadic eye movements, self-reported sedation, and vigilance task performance. Analyses revealed a significant association between plasma midazolam levels and changes in EEG beta power, pattern shift visual evoked potential amplitude, heart rate, and saccade amplitude and velocity. The patient and control groups differed significantly in the onset latencies of their saccadic eye movements, and marginally in EEG beta power, both before and after midazolam. However, no differences were detected between the groups in the dose of midazolam required to produce sedation or in midazolam's neurophysiological effects.", 
    "115": "The present study compared the effects of ethanol and diazepam on a task that allows for the assessment of both spatial working memory and the acquisition of spatial information within each day. During the first trial of each day, subjects were shown the spatial location of a food reward on a six-arm radial-arm maze. During nine subsequent free-choice trials, subjects were reinforced for returning to that same spatial location. The location of the food reward varied across days. Thus, choosing correctly on any given trial required subjects to remember where food had been received during the previous trials of that day. The effects of ethanol and diazepam on working memory were assessed by analyzing the overall number of errors committed during the nine free-choice trials of each day. The effects of ethanol and diazepam on within-day acquisition were assessed by comparing the number of errors committed during the first three trials of each day to the number of errors committed during the last three trials of each day. Ethanol and diazepam both produced dose-dependent increases in working memory errors, and both did so without impairing within-day acquisition. The results of the present study provide further evidence of the similarities between the effects of ethanol and benzodiazepine receptor agonists on learning and memory, and are consistent with the hypothesis that ethanol's potentiation of GABA at GABAA receptors contributes to the learning and memory impairments produced by ethanol.", 
    "116": "The effects of single doses of haloperidol (2, 4 and 6 mg) were compared with lorazepam 2.5 mg and placebo in 15 healthy subjects. Visual search strategy was measured, along with a range of psychomotor and eye movement tests. Patients with Parkinson's disease have been shown to exhibit a shift from parallel to serial processing in visual search, but we demonstrated that this does not occur following administration of either haloperidol or lorazepam. Haloperidol was detected by visual analogue rating scales and peak saccadic velocity, the latter being the more sensitive measure. Haloperidol had no statistically significant effect on smooth pursuit position error, velocity error or saccadic intrusions. Digit symbol substitution performance was clearly diminished by haloperidol, but there was no effect on the continuous attention test. Lorazepam decreased performance in all tests apart from saccadic latency.", 
    "117": "The abilities of the central (CBR) and the peripheral (PBR) benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, flumazenil (FLU) and PK 11195 (PK), to precipitate an abstinence syndrome in diazepam (DZ)-dependent rats have been evaluated. Female rats were exposed for 5 weeks to DZ slowly released from SC implanted silastic capsules (90 mg/capsule per week) and thereafter they were challenged in weekly intervals with IV injections of FLU (10, 20, 40 mg/kg) or PK (5, 10, 20 mg/kg), respectively. The maximum abstinence scores tended to increase with the dose of FLU but not with the dose of PK. Although FLU and PK precipitated some common abstinence signs, there were marked differences between these antagonists. FLU evoked dose-related tonic-clonic and clonic convulsions (five out of six rats), whereas PK (10 mg/kg) induced convulsions in only one rat (out of five); tachypnea tended to increase with the dose of both FLU and PK; twitches and jerks, backing and writhing had a significant regression on the dose of FLU; rearing tended to decrease with the dose of PK whereas FLU-evoked head bobbing and PK-evoked twitches and jerks had inverse U-shaped dose-response curves. In comparison to FLU, similar doses of PK (10 and 20 mg/kg) induced a lower precipitated abstinence score (P < 0.05) and a less intense tachypnea (P < 0.05). The data indicate that the chronic continuous exposure to DZ (and/or its active metabolites) affects both CBR and PBR in the rat; however, the abstinence syndromes produced by the CBR and PBR antagonists, FLU and PK, differ in overall intensities and in the diversity of evoked abstinence signs.", 
    "118": "Diazepam is widely prescribed for persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) to treat muscular spasticity. To assess the current usage of diazepam in those persons with SCI being followed by the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (DVAMCs), a survey was mailed to all 23 DVAMCs that have specialized SCI Services. We discovered that no policy regarding the prescription of benzodiazepines existed at 65 percent of the SCI Services. At 70 percent of the SCI Services, diazepam or another benzodiazepine was routinely prescribed. One-third of patients were estimated to have taken diazepam for greater than 10 years and an additional 37 percent for six to 10 years. Despite the potential for addiction, only 10 of the 23 SCI Services reported having a program to encourage discontinuation of diazepam use; a 20 percent success rate was reported in withdrawing this medication. A need for greater understanding with regard to the prescription of diazepam exists and strategies for its withdrawal should be considered. Appropriate guidelines for its use in patients with SCI and spasticity should be developed.",

    "123": "The management of acute extrapyramidal effects (EPEs) induced by antipsychotic drugs is reviewed. EPEs associated with antipsychotics include acute dystonias, pseudoparkinsonism, and akathisia. Acute dystonias consist of abnormal muscle spasms and postures and usually occur three to five days after antipsychotic therapy begins or the dosage is increased. Acute dystonias should be treated with anticholinergic medications or benzodiazepines. Antipsychotic-induced pseudoparkinsonism has the same clinical appearance as idiopathic parkinsonism. Symptoms generally appear within the first three months. Pseudoparkinsonism is managed by lowering the anti-psychotic dosage or by adding an anticholinergic agent or a mantadine; switching to a low-potency agent or an atypical antipsychotic may also help. Akathisia is characterized by subjective feelings of restlessness and anxiety and objective signs of motor activity, such as inability to sit still. This EPE appears days to weeks after antipsychotic exposure begins and can be difficult to manage. If reduction of the antipsychotic dosage or a switch to a less potent antipsychotic is not practical or effective, an anticholinergic, beta-blocker, or benzodiazepine may be added. Lipophilic beta-blockers, especially propranolol and metoprolol, appear to be the most effective treatments. Anticholinergic agents are commonly given to prevent acute dystonias, especially in high-risk patients, but long-term prophylaxis is controversial. Atypical antipsychotics may have less potential to induce EPEs. Options in the management of antipsychotic-associated EPEs include using the lowest effective dosage of antipsychotic, treating the reactions with medications, and changing the antipsychotic to one with less potential for inducing EPEs.",
