I.p. injection of clobenpropit caused dose-dependent inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures. GABAmimetic drugs such as diazepam, sodium valproate and muscimol also inhibited amygdaloid kindled seizures in a dose-dependent manner. Diazepam at doses of 0.2 and 0.5 mg/kg, which showed no significant effect on amygdaloid kindled seizures when used separately, significantly potentiated the effect of clobenpropit. Similar findings were observed with sodium valproate and muscimol at doses of 100 mg/kg and 5 ng, respectively, although neither showed any significant effects when administered separately. Bicuculline caused significant antagonism of the inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures induced by clobenpropit, while the effect of diazepam was not antagonized by diphenhydramine. These results suggested that inhibition of amygdaloid kindled seizures induced by histamine is closely associated with the actions of GABA.", 
    "1": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that manifests clinically with variable degrees of tremor, muscle rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease is characterised by prominent tremor of one or more limbs with a relative lack of significant rigidity and bradykinesia. Despite the lack of other disabling motor symptoms, the tremor of tremor-predominant Parkinson's disease can be very disabling, especially if a postural and kinetic component exists. A wide variety of treatments for Parkinson's disease tremor are currently available and include use of oral medications, injections with botulinum toxin and neurosurgical procedures. Some of the first line medications (levodopa, dopamine agonists, anticholinergics) are very effective in controlling tremor. However, some patients with Parkinson's disease tremors are unresponsive to first line drugs and treatment with second line medications (clozapine, amantadine, clonazepam, propranolol, neurontin) should be attempted. In the small number of patients with disabling tremor that is refractory to all medications, neurosurgical intervention should be considered. Both thermocoagulation and deep brain stimulation at several different neuroanatomical sites (thalamus, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus) offer good to excellent tremor control with relatively low risk to the patient.",

    "3": "Inhibition of flunitrazepam metabolism by buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine were determined in three human liver microsome preparations carrying the CYP2C19*1/*1 allele. Omeprazole metabolism mediated by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 was used as a control reaction. Apparent K(i) values were determined.", 
    "4": "Norbuprenorphine did not inhibit the metabolism of flunitrazepam or omeprazole. Buprenorphine inhibited the formation of CYP3A4-mediated pathways of 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam and omeprazole sulfone formation (K(i) 118 and 16 microM) in human liver microsomes. Corresponding values were 38 and 90 microM in cDNA-expressed CYP3A4 microsomes. Projected in vivo inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of flunitrazepam by buprenorphine is 0. 1%-2.5%. Estimated inhibition of buprenorphine N-dealkylation by flunitrazepam in vivo is 0.08%.",

No studies have examined central benzodiazepine receptor binding in patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The purpose of this study was to examine measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding in PTSD.", 
    "7": "From 13 patients with Vietnam combat-related PTSD and 13 case-matched healthy comparison subjects, a quantitative measure related to benzodiazepine receptor binding (distribution volume) was obtained with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of [(123)I]iomazenil binding and measurement of radioligand concentration in plasma. Distribution volume image data were analyzed by means of statistical parametric mapping.", 
    "8": "Lower distribution volumes were found in the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) of PTSD patients than in comparison subjects.", 
    "9": "These findings of lower values for the benzodiazepine receptor binding measure of distribution volume are consistent with fewer benzodiazepine receptors and/or reduced affinity of receptor binding in the medial prefrontal cortex in patients with PTSD. Alterations in benzodiazepine receptor function in this area may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD.", 
    "10": "6,3'-dibromoflavone and 6-nitro-3'-bromoflavone inhibited [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine binding site of the gamma amino butyric acid receptor complex with K(i) values between 17 and 36 nM in different brain regions. Their gamma amino butyric acid ratio for [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebral cortex membranes indicated partial agonistic properties. Both compounds had similar pharmacological effects: they produced anxiolytic-like effects at low doses but did not alter locomotor activity or muscle tonicity; sedation was caused only at doses higher than 30 mg/kg in mice. These synthetic flavone derivatives join an existing family of 6,3'-disubstituted flavone compounds with high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site and partial agonistic profiles.",

A myasthenia syndrome was induced by lithium in 3 cases and underlying myasthenia was disclosed by lithium in the last one. The long-term course in our patient was in favor of an induced syndrome rather than underlying myasthenia. We discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms. Lithium is a commonly prescribed drug. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of neuromuscular junction disorder in patients taking lithium who develop muscle fatigue.", 
    "14": "A 22-year-old male with more than 28 needle marks on his right arm was found dead. First, he was suspected as a drug abuser. Blood, urine, spleen, and injection-site tissue was collected during autopsy. The blood and urine specimens were screened for drugs. Immunoassay studies did not show any illegal drugs. However, two unidentified peaks were isolated in both of these biological fluids by routine gas chromatography-flame-ionization detection (GC-FID) and thermionic specific detection. Additional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis determined these two peaks to be tiletamine and zolazepam. These two agents are used in combination as veterinary anesthesia. The concentrations of these drugs in blood were quantitated by GC-FID and found to be 0.85 mg/L of tiletamine and 3.3 mg/L of zolazepam. In urine, tiletamine and its metabolite, 2-(ethylamino)-2-(2-thionyl) cyclohexanol, were identified to be present along with zolazepam. The concentrations of tiletamine and zolazepam in spleen were revealed to be 0.92 and 3.5 mg/kg, respectively. Injection-site tissue concentrations were determined to be 25.1 mg/kg tiletamine and 23.3 mg/kg for zolazepam. The cause of death in this case was determined to be due to the multiple drug intoxication of tiletamine and zolazepam.", 
    "15": "The objective of this study was to develop an immunoassay that would be capable of detecting flunitrazepam and/or cross-reacting metabolites in urine and comparing the results with those obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Doses of Rohypnol varying between 0.5 and 4 mg were given to volunteers, and urine was collected for up to two weeks postingestion. These samples were analyzed by an ELISA that was developed using an antibody raised to flunitrazepam and a drug-enzyme conjugate prepared by attaching 7-aminoflunitrazepam to horseradish peroxidase. Significant levels of flunitrazepam and/or cross-reacting metabolites were detected in urine for up to one week after ingestion. The immunoassay is selective with only diazepam cross-reacting at a level of 1000 microg/L.",

However, the effects of panic on cancer treatment and cancer patients' quality of life are not well understood. To examine more closely the occurrence of panic attacks and panic disorder in cancer patients, we retrospectively reviewed charts of 106 consecutive psychosomatic consultations of inpatients with cancer at a regional cancer center. Approximately one-fifth of the patient sample presented with panic attacks or panic disorder at the time of the consultation. We present four case examples to demonstrate the potential effect of panic on cancer patients, including requests for cancer treatment discontinuation. We report resolution of panic with benzodiazepine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.", 
    "17": "The effects of acute intravenous administration of several new, atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs): olanzapine (0.05 and 1.0 mg/kg), sertindole (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) and quetiapine (0.25 and 2.5 mg/kg), a selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist, M100907 (0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg), and an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.3 mg/kg), on regional dopamine output were examined in the two subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the core and shell, which seem associated with motor control and limbic functions, respectively, by using in vivo differential normal pulse voltammetry in anaesthetised, pargyline-pretreated rats. Both quetiapine and sertindole, in the two doses used, caused a more pronounced dopamine release in the shell than in the core region of the NAC. In contrast, the low dose of olanzapine increased dopamine output almost to the same extent in both regions, whereas the high dose increased dopamine output to a greater extent in the core. M100907 selectively increased dopamine output in the shell. Also, prazosin significantly increased dopamine output in the shell, but not in the core. The results indicate that both 5-HT(2A) and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonism may play an important role in the preferential effect of atypical APDs on dopamine output in the shell versus the core of the NAC.", 
    "18": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and it acts at the GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors. A possible role for the GABA(A) receptors in alcohol action has been derived from in vitro cell models, animal studies and human research. GABA(A) subunit mRNA expression in cell models has suggested that the long form of the gamma2 subunit is essential for ethanol enhanced potentiation of GABA(A) receptors, by phosphorylation of a serine contained within the extra eight amino acids. Several animal studies have demonstrated that alterations in drug and alcohol responses may be caused by amino-acid differences at the GABA(A)alpha6 and GABA(A)gamma2 subunits. An Arg(100)/Glu(100) change at the GABA(A)alpha6 subunit conferring altered binding efficacy of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513, was found between the AT (alcohol tolerance) and ANT (alcohol non-tolerance) rats. Several loci related to alcohol withdrawal on mouse chromosome 11 which corresponds to the region containing four GABA(A) subunit (beta2, alpha6, alpha1 and gamma2) genes on human chromosome 5q33-34, were also identified. Gene knockout studies of the role of GABA(A)alpha6 and GABA(A)gamma2 subunit genes in mice have demonstrated an essential role in the modulation of other GABA(A) subunit expression and the efficacy of benzodiazepine binding. Absence of the GABA(A)gamma2 subunit gene has more severe effects with many of the mice dying shortly after birth. Disappointingly few studies have examined the effects of response to alcohol in these gene knockout mice. Human genetic association studies have suggested that the GABA(A)beta2, alpha6, alpha1 and gamma2 subunit genes have a role in the development of alcohol dependence, although their contributions may vary between ethnic group and phenotype. In summary, in vitro cell, animal and human genetic association studies have suggested that the GABA(A)beta2, alpha6, alpha1 and gamma2 subunit genes have an important role in alcohol related phenotypes (300 words).", 
    "19": "The pharmacodynamic (PD) interaction between the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam and the alpha(2)-adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine was characterized for defined measures of anesthetic action and cardiovascular and ventilatory side effects in 33 rats. For various combinations of constant plasma concentrations of midazolam (0.1-20 microg/ml) and dexmedetomidine (0.3-19 ng/ml) obtained by target-controlled infusion, the whisker reflex (WR), righting reflex (RR), startle reflex to noise (SR), tail clamp response (TC), and corneal reflex (CR) were assessed. EEG (power in 0.5-3.5-Hz frequency band), mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were recorded continuously. Blood gas values and arterial drug concentrations were determined regularly. The nature and extent of PD interaction was quantified by the model parameter synergy (SYN < 0, antagonism; SYN = 0, additivity; and SYN > 0, synergy). With increasing drug concentrations WR was lost first, followed by RR, SR, TC, and CR. These effects were accompanied by an increase of the EEG measure. The drug interaction was synergistic for all stimulus-response measures and the degree of synergy increased with deeper levels of central nervous system depression (SYN was 7.3, 145, 560, 374, and 1490 for WR, RR, SR, TC, and CR, respectively). The cardiovascular side effects of dexmedetomidine, evaluated at similar PD endpoints, were reduced in the presence of midazolam. Ventilatory side effects were minor for all drug combinations. The nature and extent of the PD interactions were not reflected in the EEG measure.",

    "21": "HLM or REC was preincubated with erythromycin in the presence of NADPH and then triazolam was added. alpha- and 4-hydroxy (OH) triazolam were quantified after a 3 min incubation and the kinetic parameters for enzyme inactivation (k(inact) and K('app)) were obtained. Drug-drug interaction in vivo was predicted based on a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model, using triazolam and erythromycin pharmacokinetic parameters obtained from the literature and kinetic parameters for the enzyme inactivation obtained in the in vitro studies.", 
    "22": "Whichever enzyme was used, triazolam metabolism was not inhibited without preincubation, even if the erythromycin concentration was increased. The degree of inhibition depended on preincubation time and erythromycin concentration. The values obtained for k(inact) and K('app) were 0.062 min(-1) and 15.9 microM (alpha-OH, HLM), 0.055 min(-1) and 17.4 microM (4-OH, HLM), 0.173 min(-1) and 19.1 microM (alpha-OH, REC), and 0.097 min(-1) and 18.9 microM (4-OH, REC). Based on the kinetic parameters obtained using HLM and REC, the AUCpo of triazolam was predicted to increase 2.0- and 2.6-fold, respectively, following oral administration of erythromycin (333 mg t.i.d. for 3 days), which agreed well with the reported data.",

    "24": "Some studies suggest that obsessive-compulsive symptoms may be common (7.8-46%) in schizophrenic patients and seem to be poorly responsive to drug therapy. Conventional neuroleptics are of limited value, but adjunctive anti-obsessive agents (clomipramine, fluvoxamine) may be an option. Although novel atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone) reportedly aggravate the obsessive-compulsive symptoms, a recent trial has shown that olanzapine did not induce new-onset obsessive-compulsive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. We report our experience with three schizophrenic patients with obsessive-compulsive symptoms who were unsuccessfully treated with various conventional neuroleptics in combination with anti-obsessive agents and subsequently showed resistance or intolerance to clozapine. All of them were switched to olanzapine (10-20 mg/ day). All patients demonstrated a significant improvement in both schizophrenic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS). Within 5-8 weeks of initiation of olanzapine, the BPRS scores of the three patient decreased by 53%, 51% and 48%, and the Y-BOCS scores by 68%, 73% and 85%. Olanzapine was well tolerated. These preliminary results suggest that olanzapine may be a therapeutic option in schizophrenic patients with obsessive-compulsive symptoms.", 
    "25": "The efficacy and safety of three doses of zaleplon, a novel non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, were compared with those of placebo in outpatients with insomnia in this 4-week study, using zolpidem 10 mg as active comparator. Postsleep questionnaires were used to determine treatment effects on the patient's perception of sleep, as well as any development of pharmacological tolerance during therapy or rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation of therapy. During week 1, sleep latency was significantly shorter with zaleplon 5, 10, and 20 mg compared to placebo. The significant decrease in sleep latency persisted through week 4 with zaleplon 20 mg, and was again evident with zaleplon 10 mg at week 3. Zaleplon 20 mg also had significant effects on sleep duration, number of awakenings, and sleep quality compared to placebo. No pharmacological tolerance developed during treatment with zaleplon and there were no indications of rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms after treatment discontinuation. Zolpidem 10 mg had significant effects on sleep latency, sleep duration, and sleep quality compared to placebo. However, a significantly greater incidence of withdrawal symptoms and a suggestion of sleep difficulty after treatment discontinuation (rebound insomnia) for all sleep measures was seen with zolpidem compared to placebo. There was no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events with active treatment compared to placebo. These results show that zaleplon provides effective treatment of insomnia with a favourable safety profile.", 
    "26": "To carry out a bibliographic review of articles indexed in MEDLINE over the past 20 years concerning the pharmacological treatment of agitation in head injury.", 
    "27": "Head injury may cause different behaviour changes, of which agitation is the most dramatic. The incidence of agitation after severe head injury varies from 11% to 50% depending on the study involved. This incidence is high enough to warrant specific management. Drug treatment has variable results. When there is imminent danger of harm to the patient himself or to others, or when aggressive behaviour makes medical management difficult, the benzodiazepines have been found useful. Antipsychotic drugs are only indicated in head injury when the agitation causes a clinical emergency, and in such a case the more potent drugs such as haloperidol are best, since they have less sedative effect. They are also effective when the clinical features are similar to those of classical schizophrenia. Antiepileptic drugs have been used successfully for treating agitation-aggressiveness, specially in paroxystic behaviour disorders. We also consider other treatments used for posttraumatic agitation.", 
    "28": "There is no general agreement amongst doctors as to the best treatment for posttraumatic agitation in head injury. However, with regard to certain characteristics of agitation different drugs may be recommended for treatment.", 
    "29": "The single dose pharmacokinetics of olanzapine in rats, following an oral dose and its distribution in the brain and other tissues after repeated oral and intra-peritoneal (i.p.) administration, were studied. Olanzapine in plasma, brain, liver, lung, kidney, spleen and fat was assayed at predose, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 12, 24, 36, 48 h postoral dose of 6 mg/kg and after daily oral and i.p. doses of 0.25, 1, 3, and 6 mg/kg/day of olanzapine for 15 consecutive days by a sensitive and specific HPLC method with electrochemical detection. Olanzapine was readily absorbed and distributed in plasma and tissues as the peak concentrations were reached within approximately 45 min after the oral dose. The terminal half-life of olanzapine in plasma was 2.5 h and in tissues it ranged from 3 to 5.2 h. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(last)) was lowest in plasma and largest in liver and lung. The AUC(last) of olanzapine was eight times larger in brain and three to 32 times larger in other tissues than that in plasma. After repeated oral doses, the plasma and tissue concentrations of olanzapine were generally higher than those after repeated i.p. doses. The liver and spleen had the highest concentrations after oral and i.p doses, respectively. In both cases, the tissue concentrations were four- to 46-fold higher than that in plasma and correlated with administered doses. Likewise, plasma concentrations strongly correlated with the simultaneous brain and tissue concentrations (r(2)>0.908, p<0.0001). On average, the brain levels were 6.3-13.1 and 5.4-17.6 times higher than the corresponding plasma level after oral and i.p. doses, respectively. The tissue to plasma level ratio of olanzapine was higher in other tissues. The data indicated that olanzapine is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed in the tissues of rats after oral and i.p. administration. The plasma concentration appears to predict the simultaneous concentration in brain and other tissues. There was no marked localized accumulation of olanzapine in any of the regions of the rat brain.", 
    "30": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic with potent antimuscarinic properties in vitro (K(i) = 2-25 nM). We studied in vivo muscarinic receptor occupancy by olanzapine at both low dose (5 mg/dy) and high dose (20 mg/dy) in several regions of cortex, striatum, thalamus and pons by analyzing [I-123]IQNB SPECT images of seven schizophrenia patients. Both low-dose and high-dose olanzapine studies revealed significantly lower [I-123]IQNB binding than that of drug-free schizophrenia patients (N = 12) in all regions except striatum. [I-123]IQNB binding was significantly lower at high-dose than low-dose in the same regions. Muscarinic occupancy by olanzapine ranged from 13% to 57% at 5 mg/dy and 26% to 79% at 20 mg/dy with an anatomical pattern indicating M(2) subtype selectivity. The [I-123]IQNB data indicate that olanzapine is a potent and subtype-selective muscarinic antagonist in vivo, perhaps explaining its low extrapyramidal side effect profile and low incidence of anticholinergic side effects.", 
    "31": "The ability of full and partial benzodiazepine receptor agonists to prevent DNA fragmentation and neuronal death after transient cerebral ischemia was investigated in the Mongolian gerbil. Diazepam (10mg/kg, i.p.) or the partial agonist imidazenil (3mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 30 and 90min after transient forebrain ischemia produced by occlusion of the carotid arteries for 5min. Treatment with diazepam completely protected CA1b hippocampal pyramidal neurons in 94% of the animals and partially protected pyramidal neurons in 6% of the animals, as assessed with a standard Nissl stain three and four days after ischemia. DNA fragmentation was examined by the terminal dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) reaction. Prior to cell death, there were no TUNEL-positive neurons in area CA1b. By three days after ischemia, when neuronal degeneration was nearly complete, 14 out of 16 gerbils exhibited a positive TUNEL reaction throughout area CA1b stratum pyramidale. In 13 out of 14 gerbils treated with diazepam, no TUNEL-positive neurons were observed in this region. Imidazenil was less effective than diazepam with respect to both neuroprotection and prevention of DNA fragmentation. Three days after ischemia, six out of eight gerbils treated with imidazenil showed partial to complete neuroprotection. Imidazenil completely prevented DNA fragmentation in only one of the animals; varying degrees of TUNEL reaction persisted in the remainder. To determine whether the neurons protected by diazepam had a normal ultrastructure, gerbils were killed two to 30 days after ischemia and the hippocampal neurons in area CA1b were examined by electron microscopy. Within the first 48h after ischemia, early cytoplasmic changes of varying degrees (e.g., vacuolation, rough endoplasmic reticulum stacking, swollen mitochondria) and electron-dense dendrites were observed in gerbils not treated with diazepam. Degeneration was nearly complete by three days after ischemia. In contrast, pyramidal neuron ultrastructure appeared normal in gerbils that exhibited complete area CA1b neuroprotection (defined at the light microscope level) by diazepam when studied two, seven or 30 days after ischemia. In gerbils with partial protection of area CA1b, most of the remaining neurons exhibited varying degrees of necrosis when studied 30 days after ischemia. No apoptotic bodies were observed. We conclude that: (i) diazepam can fully protect CA1 pyramidal cells from the toxic effects of transient cerebral ischemia; (ii) when diazepam affords only partial neuroprotection, the residual CA1 pyramidal cells exhibit ultrastructural abnormalities consistent with necrotic damage; and (iii) diazepam is a more efficacious neuroprotectant than the partial benzodiazepine receptor agonist, imidazenil.", 
    "32": "During the course of an infection, profound metabolic and behavioral changes are observed. The resulting decrease in food intake can be reproduced by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or the proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin-1 [IL-1] and tumor necrosis factor it induces. To test the possibility that cholecystokinin (CCK) mediates anorexia induced by IL-1 beta and LPS, mice trained to poke their noses in a hole to obtain a food reward according to a fixed ratio (1 reward per 20 actions) were pretreated with the CCK-A receptor antagonist L364,718 (at 1 mg/kg) or with the CCK-B receptor antagonist L365,260 (50 microg/kg) before being injected with LPS (100 microg/kg) or IL-1 beta (20 microg/kg). All injections were given via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. In spite of its ability to block the effects of exogenous CCK-8 on food-motivated behavior in mice, the CCK-A receptor antagonist did not block the depressive actions of LPS and IL-1 beta on food-motivated behavior. The CCK-B receptor antagonist was not more effective at blocking. These results do not support a role for CCK in the anorexic effect of LPS and IL-1 beta.", 
    "33": "Previously, we generated gastrin-releasing peptide receptor null mutant mice (GRP-R-deficient mice), and found that these animals displayed increased non-aggressive social responses in an ordinary social interaction test using a resident-intruder method. In the present study, we examined in more detail the social behaviors of GRP-R-deficient male mice. In social interaction tests, GRP-R-deficient mice showed more social responses, such as sniffing and nosing, relative to wild-type mice, and similar results were obtained whether GRP-R-deficient mice served as intruders or residents. In the same way, they showed more contact behaviors toward an anesthetized conspecific, and less locomotor activity than wild-type mice in a social investigation test toward an anesthetized male mouse. Since olfactory systems play important roles in the social behavior of rodents, olfactory preference tests were conducted in order to evaluate the olfactory properties of GRP-R-deficient mice. The results suggest that no differences exist between wild-type mice and GRP-R-deficient mice in the preference between a novel sawdust odor and their own odor, or that of other male mice. However, GRP-R-deficient mice preferred the odor of other male mice to their own, in contrast to wild-type mice. Furthermore, the preferences of GRP-R-deficient and wild-type mice were not disrupted by intraperitoneal infusion of diazepam (1.5 mg/kg). These results indicate that neither the motion, nor the behavior of conspecifics, nor reduced anxiety lead to the increased non-aggressive social responses and/or social investigatory behaviors in GRP-R-deficient mice. Rather, these latter behaviors may be a consequence of altered cognition of conspecific odors in the mutant mice.", 
    "34": "Many hypnotics, such as benzodiazepines, are agonistic modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors. Such compounds increase the ability to fall and stay asleep, but inhibit rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep and deep non-REM sleep. However, tolerance to their hypnotic action may develop rapidly. Previous findings in rats and humans demonstrate that the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) agonist 4, 5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) promotes deep non-REM sleep and increases non-REM sleep continuity. To investigate the effects of repeated administration, we assessed sleep in rats before, during, and after chronic dosing of THIP (3 mg/kg, once daily for 5 days; n = 9) or of placebo (n = 8). The substances were administered i.p. at the onset of darkness. The electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram were recorded during the first 6 h after injection. During baseline recording, the placebo and the THIP group exhibited similar sleep patterns. After the first THIP injection, rats displayed more non-REM sleep, longer non-REM episodes, and higher levels of slow wave activity in the EEG within non-REM sleep than the placebo group rats. The effects were sustained during all treatment days. REM sleep was not affected. After drug withdrawal, the sleep patterns of the THIP and the placebo group were practically identical again. These observations suggest that THIP does not rapidly produce tolerance toward its sleep effects and abrupt drug withdrawal may not be associated with sleep disturbances. These findings confirm and extend the existing information suggesting that THIP may be promising for treatment of insomnia.",

The initial and overall mean daily doses for the 3 groups were as follows: OLZ, 12.2 and 13.0 mg, respectively; RIS, 5.2 and 5.4 mg; and HAL, 13.9 and 13.6 mg. Initial and overall median daily doses were the same in each group: OLZ, 10 mg; RIS, 6 mg; and HAL, 10 mg. A significantly lower proportion of OLZ-treated patients (36.9%) experienced EPS compared with RIS-treated (49.6%) and HAL-treated (76.0%) patients (P < or = 0.001). A significantly lower proportion of patients in the OLZ group (47.8%) experienced adverse events compared with patients in the RIS (57.2%) and HAL (79.8%) groups (P < or = 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of OLZ-treated patients (37.3%) were responders compared with RIS-treated patients (31.5%) (P < 0.05). In all 3 groups, patients who had an initial CGI score > or = 5 received significantly higher overall mean daily doses than did patients with an initial CGI score < 5 (P < 0.001).

In addition, we wrote to pharmaceutical manufacturers and 10 practising clinicians to ask them to provide other relevant reports known to them.", 
    "41": "Eighty reports mentioning change in body weight were retrieved. Data relating to weight changes were of variable quality. Weight changes were indicated by a variety of measures. The majority of reports related to short-term changes.", 
    "42": "All atypical drugs, with the exception of ziprasidone, have been associated with weight increases. Clozapine seems to have the highest risk of weight gain, followed by olanzapine and quetiapine. There is probably a lower risk with risperidone, sertindole and zotepine and a still lower risk with amisulpride. Ziprasidone appears not to be associated with weight gain. In the absence of more compelling data, these rankings must be considered approximate and preliminary. Longer, more robust trials are needed.", 
    "43": "In this study, the authors evaluate the pharmacodynamics, safety, and acceptability of a new cherry-flavored oral syrup formulation of midazolam. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-ranging clinical trial of oral midazolam was conducted at seven U.S. health care institutions focused on pediatric clinical pharmacology research (i.e., the PPRU Network). Pediatric patients (n = 85, ages 6 months through 15 years) underwent invasive procedures and were randomized to a single oral dose of midazolam syrup (0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg). Patient taste acceptability of midazolam syrup was evaluated at the time of oral administration. Pharmacodynamic measurements included (1) sedation score using a 5-point scale at baseline and 10-, 20-, and 30-minute postdose intervals and (2) anxiety score using a 4-point scale at the time of separation from caretakers and, when applicable, at the time of mask anesthetic induction. Midazolam and alpha-hydroxymidazolam plasma concentrations were measured at all pharmacodynamic measurement time points. Adverse events were monitored continuously during the study. Most patients (99%) accepted the syrup without difficulty. Satisfactory sedation was achieved within 30 minutes by 81% of patients. The anxiety score at the time of caretaker separation and mask anesthetic induction was satisfactory for 87% and 91% of patients, respectively. A significant linear relationship between plasma drug concentration and maximal sedation score, but not anxiety score, was observed. The occurrence of adverse events was consistent with the known safety profile of midazolam. The most commonly reported adverse events were hiccoughing, hypoxemia, nausea, and emesis. It was concluded that a new oral syrup formulation of midazolam, 0.25 to 1.0 mg/kg, effectively induced rapid-onset, dose-related, adequate, and safe sedation and anxiolysis in pediatric patients who underwent operative procedures. Sedative effects were related to plasma concentrations of both midazolam and the primary metabolite, alpha-hydroxymidazolam. Oral midazolam, 1.0 mg/kg, administered within 30 minutes of the expected procedure or anesthetic induction should provide safe and effective sedation to a majority of children ages 6 months to 16 years.",

    "47": "Exposure to socio-psychological stress for 5, 10 and 15 min produced duration-dependent antinociception in diabetic mice. However, in non-diabetic mice, no appreciable antinociception was found even in the case of socio-psychological stress for 15 min. Pretreatment with diazepam (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated socio-psychological stress-induced antinociception in diabetic mice (vehicle: 62.9 +/- 5.5%, n = 10; diazepam: 22 +/- 1%, n = 10). Furthermore, pretreatment with flumazenil (1 mg/kg, i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, also significantly reduced socio-psychological stress-induced antinociception in diabetic mice (vehicle: 77.9 +/- 5.0%, n = 10; flumazenil: 5.8 +/- 1.2%, n = 10). In contrast, pretreatment with methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM, 2 mg/kg, i.v.), a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, significantly enhanced socio-psychological stress-induced antinociception in non-diabetic mice (vehicle: 4.9 +/- 0.6%, n = 10; beta-CCM: 61.5 +/- 5.9%, n = 10), but not in diabetic mice (vehicle: 50.7 +/- 4.5%, n = 10; beta-CCM: 64.4 +/- 7.2%, n = 10).", 
    "48": "These results indicate that emotional stress can readily induce antinociception in diabetic mice. Furthermore, this enhanced emotional stress-induced antinociception might be attributable to an increase in the production and/or release of endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptors, such as diazepam binding inhibitor, which act as inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonists.",

    "51": "Two groups of rats were trained to discriminate either PTZ (20 mg/kg, s.c.) or CDP (10 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline using an operant drug discrimination procedure. After prolonged training, half of each group was used to assess biochemical changes induced by both drugs in different sub areas of the PFC. For the remaining rats, discrimination training continued and generalization tests with PTZ and CDP were performed. Rats were then provided with bilateral guide cannulae aimed at the ventromedial (vm) PFC, and the effects of local infusions of DAergic drugs on discriminative performance were evaluated.", 
    "52": "CDP did not affect PFC DA activity, but PTZ increased the DOPAC/DA ratio in the vmPFC selectively. Generalization tests showed that the cues of PTZ and CDP were dose dependent. In PTZ-trained rats, infusions of the DA receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol into the vmPFC blocked the PTZ cue dose dependently, whereas the agonist apomorphine partially generalized to this cue. In CDP-trained rats, neither drug antagonized or generalized to the CDP cue, showing that PFC DA is not critically involved in the CDP cue and that local pharmacological manipulations of PFC DA do not affect discriminative abilities per se.",

Combined administration of ethanol (0.50 g/kg) and allopregnanolone (5.0 mg/kg), doses which were ineffective alone, decreased N1 amplitude in the amygdala by 60%. Allopregnanolone and ethanol had dissimilar EEG effects. Allopregnanolone increased high frequency power in the cortex and amygdala by 25-30%. Ethanol decreased cortical and amygdalar power in the same high frequency bands by 25-45%. Allopregnanolone, but not ethanol, also shifted cortical frequency in the 32- to 50-Hz band. Combined administration of allopregnanolone and ethanol had no effect on EEG power but enhanced allopregnanolone's effect on cortical frequency.", 
    "58": "These data suggest that allopregnanolone's macro-electrophysiological profile resembles barbiturates and benzodiazepines more than ethanol.

    "59": "The triblock copolymer based on poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) as hydrophobic part and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as hydrophilic one was synthesized and characterized. Core-shell type nanoparticles of poly(epsilon-caprolactone)/poly(ethylene glycol)/poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (CEC) block copolymer were prepared by a dialysis technique. According to the amphiphilic characters, CEC block copolymer can self-associate at certain concentration and their critical association concentration (CAC) was determined by fluorescence probe technique. CAC value of the CEC-2 block copolymer was evaluated as 0.0030 g/l. CAC values of CEC block copolymer decreased with the increase of PCL chain length, i.e. the shorter the PCL chain length, the higher the CAC values. From the observation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the morphologies of CEC-2 core-shell type nanoparticles were spherical shapes. Particle size of CEC-2 nanoparticles was 32.3+/-17.3 nm as a monomodal and narrow distribution. Particle size, drug loading, and drug release rate of CEC-2 nanoparticles were changed by the initial solvents and the molecular weight of CEC. The degradation behavior of CEC-2 nanoparticles was observed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. It was suggested that clonazepam (CNZ) release kinetics were dominantly governed by diffusion mechanism.", 
    "60": "We examined the potentiation by ketamine of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor function using convulsive and anesthetic behavioral models in adult male ddY mice. General anesthetic potencies were evaluated by a rating scale, which provided the data for anesthetic scores, loss of righting reflex, duration, and recovery time. All drugs were administered intraperitoneally. Small subanesthetic doses of ketamine did inhibit tonic seizures induced by a large dose of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (8 mg/kg). The 50% effective dose value was 15 (95% confidence limits 10-22) mg/kg. Even large anesthetic doses (100-150 mg/kg) did not suppress clonic seizures in 50% of the animals. The GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol (0.32-1.12 mg/kg), potentiated ketamine-induced anesthesia in a dose-dependent fashion (P < 0.05). Similarly, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (1-3 mg/kg), augmented ketamine anesthesia in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). Bicuculline (2-5 mg/kg) dose-dependently antagonized ketamine-induced anesthesia (P < 0.05). Neither the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (2-20 mg/kg), nor the GABA synthesis inhibitor, L-allylglycine (200 mg/kg), affected the anesthetic action of ketamine. These results suggest that ketamine has GABA(A) receptor agonistic properties and that ketamine-induced anesthesia is mediated, at least in part, by GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "61": "We examined the potentiation by ketamine of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor function using convulsive and anesthetic behavioral models in mice. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine-inhibited tonic convulsions induced by the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. The gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, potentiated ketamine-induced anesthesia. Bicuculline antagonized ketamine anesthesia, but the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid synthesis inhibitor, L-allyglycine, did not. The effects of ketamine on the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors appear to correlate with its anesthetic actions.", 
    "62": "To test the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) and N-methyl-D-aspartate-nitric oxide (NMDA-NO) systems in the development of acute tolerance to analgesia during alfentanil IV infusion, we conducted experiments in rats with the use of an infusion algorithm designed to maintain a constant plasma level of the opioid for 4 h. The degree of acute tolerance was determined on the basis of decline in the level of analgesia measured with a tail compression test. CCK(B) receptor antagonists (proglumide, CI-988, and L-365,260) and NMDA-NO cascade inhibitors (dizocilpine and NO synthase inhibitor) were administered before the start of alfentanil infusion. Use of 30 mg/kg proglumide, 10 mg/kg CI-988, and 1 mg/kg L-365,260 attenuated acute tolerance at 1 h of alfentanil infusion by approximately 60%, 55%, and 70%, respectively, and by the end of 4-h infusion by 50%, 50%, and 25%, respectively. Use of 0.1 mg/kg dizocilpine and 10 mg/kg N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester attenuated acute tolerance at 1 h of alfentanil infusion by approximately 65% and 65% and by the end of 4-h infusion by 30% and 0%, respectively. Comparison of the results with CCK(B) receptor antagonists and inhibitors of NMDA-NO cascade demonstrates that both groups of drugs provide more or less similar degrees of attenuation of acute tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of alfentanil, and none of these drugs completely prevents tolerance development.", 
    "63": "The mechanism of acute tolerance to the analgesic effect of alfentanil depends on participation of multiple systems of adaptation that include cholecystokinin(B) receptors and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid-nitric oxide cascade. Drugs that inhibit function of these systems attenuate tolerance development.", 
    "64": "This study compared the effects of flibanserin, a novel 5-HT(1A) agonist/5-HT(2A) antagonist; diazepam, a traditional anxiolytic; and imipramine, a traditional antidepressant, on separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), locomotor behaviour, negative geotaxis and body temperature of 7 - 8-day-old rat pups. Flibanserin (5, 10, 25 and 50 mg kg(-1) s.c.) reduced USVs but had no effects on locomotor behaviour or negative geotaxis. Lower doses of flibanserin (0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg kg(-1) s.c.) had no effect on any behaviour. Diazepam (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mg kg(-1) s.c.) not only reduced the USVs but also increased rolling and increased the latency of the negative geotaxic response. Imipramine (10, 15, 20 and 30 mg kg(-1) s.c.) reduced USVs, increased total locomotor activity and rolling but had no effect on negative geotaxis. None of the drugs altered body temperature. Our data showed that flibanserin is as effective in reducing the USVs as diazepam and imipramine but has a lower incidence of motor side effects. This suggests that flibanserin might be effective for the treatment of mood disturbances such as anxiety.", 
    "65": "By mobilizing histamine in response to gastrin, the ECL cells in the oxyntic mucosa play a key role in the control of the parietal cells and hence of gastric acid secretion. General anaesthesia suppresses basal and gastrin- and histamine-stimulated acid secretion. The present study examines if the effect of anaesthesia on basal and gastrin-stimulated acid secretion is associated with suppressed ECL-cell histamine secretion. A microdialysis probe was implanted in the submucosa of the ventral aspect of the acid-producing part of the stomach (32 rats). Three days later, ECL-cell histamine mobilization was monitored 2 h before and 4 h after the start of intravenous infusion of gastrin (5 nmol kg(-1) h(-1)). The rats were either conscious or anaesthetized. Four commonly used anaesthetic agents were given 1 h before the start of the experiments by intraperitoneal injection: chloral hydrate (300 mg kg(-1)), pentobarbitone (40 mg kg(-1)), urethane (1.5 g kg(-1)) and a mixture of fluanisone/fentanyl/midazolam (15/0.5/7.5 mg kg(-1)). In a parallel series of experiments, basal- and gastrin-induced acid secretion was monitored in six conscious and 25 anaesthetized (see above) chronic gastric fistula rats. All anaesthetic agents lowered gastrin-stimulated acid secretion; also the basal acid output was reduced (fluanisone/fentanyl/midazolam was an exception). Anaesthesia reduced gastrin-stimulated but not basal histamine release by 55 - 80%. The reduction in gastrin-induced acid response (70 - 95%) was strongly correlated to the reduction in gastrin-induced histamine mobilization. The correlation is in line with the view that the reduced acid response to gastrin reflects impaired histamine mobilization. Rat stomach ECL cells were purified by counter-flow elutriation. Gastrin-evoked histamine mobilization from the isolated ECL cells was determined in the absence or presence of anaesthetic agents in the medium. With the exception of urethane, they inhibited gastrin-evoked histamine secretion dose-dependently, indicating a direct effect on the ECL cells. Anaesthetized rats are widely used to study acid secretion and ECL-cell histamine release. The present results illustrate the short-comings of such an approach in that a number of anaesthetic agents were found to impair not only acid secretion but also the secretion of ECL-cell histamine - some acting in a direct manner.", 
    "66": "This article explores the literature concerning responses to pain of both premature and term-born newborn infants, the evidence for short-term and long-term effects of pain, and behavioral sequelae in individuals who have experienced repeated early pain in neonatal life as they mature. There is no doubt that pain causes stress in babies and this in turn may adversely affect long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. Although there are methods for assessing dimensions of acute reactivity to pain in an experimental setting, there are no very good measures available at the present time that can be used clinically. In the clinical setting repeated or chronic pain is more likely the norm rather than infrequent discrete noxious stimuli of the sort that can be readily studied. The wind-up phenomenon suggests that, exposed to a cascade of procedures as happens with clustering of care in the clinical setting in an attempt to provide periods of rest for stressed babies, an infant may in fact perceive procedures that are not normally viewed as noxious, as pain. Pain exposure during lifesaving intensive medical care of ELBW neonates may also affect subsequent reactivity to pain in the neonatal period, but behavioral differences are probably not likely to be clinically significant in the long term. Prolonged and repeated untreated pain in the newborn period, however, may produce a relatively permanent shift in basal autonomic arousal related to prior NICU pain experience, which may have long-term sequelae. In the long run, the most significant clinical effects of early pain exposure may be on neurodevelopment, contributing to later attention, learning, and behavior problems in these vulnerable children. Although there is considerable evidence to support a variety of adverse effects of early pain, there is less information about the long-term effects of opiates and benzodiazepines on the developing central nervous system. Current evidence reviewed suggests that judicious use of morphine for adjustment to mechanical ventilation may ameliorate the altered autonomic response. It may be very important, however, to distinguish stress from pain. Animal evidence suggests that the neonatal brain is affected differently when exposed to morphine administered in the absence of pain than in the presence of pain. Pain control may be important for many reasons but overuse of morphine or benzodiazepines may have undesirable long-term effects. This is a rapidly evolving area of knowledge of clear relevance to clinical management likely to affect long-term outcomes of high-risk children.", 
    "67": "It can be concluded from the present study that ketamine showed dose-dependent anticonvulsant effect on MES in mice. It is presumed that this anticonvulsant effect of ketamine could be due to blockade of excitatory amino acid NMDA receptors. It was potentiated by anticonvulsants like diazepam and DPH but was found to be insensitive to naloxone. These findings suggest the involvement of NMDA receptors and their antagonists in epilepsy. Ketamine thus can be given as add-on therapy in refractory cases, and may prove to be useful as an anticonvulsant in future.",

Throughout the first postoperative week, subjects in the treatment group reported a greater reduction in postoperative pain compared with subjects in the placebo group (F1,50= 3.5; P = 0.035). Moreover, at 1 week, ibuprofen use was reported by less subjects in the treatment group than in the placebo group (0% vs 17.2%; P = 0.026).

    "72": "Two distinct benzodiazepine binding sites have been identified, (i) a central site restricted to brain and (ii) a ubiquitously expressed mitochondrial binding site, the so-called peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). In this paper, we show that a benzazepine referred to as BBL22 (2-amino 9-chloro-7-(2-fluorophenyl)-5H-pyrimidol[5,4-d][2]benzazepine), which is classified as a PBR ligand based on structure, induces arrest in G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle in human tumor cell lines of both epithelial and hematopoietic cellular origin. After G(2)/M arrest, several tumor types, notably prostate and certain breast cancer lines exhibited significant apoptosis. Ideally, cancer therapies should selectively target tumor cells while sparing normal cell counterparts. BBL22 exhibited such selectivity, as it did not affect the growth and survival of nonmalignant breast and prostate epithelial lines. Moreover, BBL22 demonstrated structural requirements for this selective antitumor activity as 11 structurally related PBR ligands, including high-affinity ligands Ro5-4864 and PK11195, failed to induce tumor cell growth arrest or apoptosis. The in vivo antitumor activity of BBL22 was examined in a human xenograft model of androgen-independent prostate cancer where BBL22 significantly reduced the growth of PC3 prostate tumors without eliciting overt toxicity. Identification of BBL22 represents a tumor selective therapeutic strategy for a variety of human tumors.", 
    "73": "The mechanism of the alteration in marble burying behavior-isolated housing (MBB-IH) mice was investigated. The determination of hypothalamus monoamine and serum corticosterone contents indicated that MBB-IH mice readily responded to the stress stimuli in conditioned fear stress. Six drugs, such as buspirone (10 mg/kg, p.o.), zimelidine (10 mg/kg, p.o.), clomipramin (10 mg/kg, p.o.), yohimbine (5 mg/kg, p.o.), ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE, 5 mg/kg, p.o.) and flumazenil (15 mg/kg, p.o.) were singly and/or three times administered to MBB-IH mice. Their inhibitory activity on the MBB-IH mice was considered by the use of activity profiles consisting of spontaneous locomotor activity, marble burying behavior and hypothalamus monoamine content. Using these profiles, we calculated the activities as vector in three-dimensional space, and compared the distance from the control point (DCP). DCPDOPAC and DCP5-HIAA were shortened by single administration of beta-CCE and flumazenil. Oren-gedoku-to (30 and 300 mg/kg, p.o.) shortened the DCPDOPAC and DCP5-HIAA similarly to beta-CCE. The blended crude drugs in Oren-gedoku-to, Coptis rhizome (636.0 mg/kg, p.o.), Scutellaria root (644.4 mg/kg, p.o.) and Gardenia fruit (894.8 mg/kg, p.o.) shortened the DCPDOPAC. Coptis rhizome and Scutellaria root also shortened the DCP5-HIAA. These results suggest that GABA neuron function intensely affects the alteration of MBB-IH and Oren-gedoku-to has the intrinsic benzodiazepine-like activity.",

    "81": "The existence of endogenous benzodiazepines such as diazepam and nordiazepam has been provided in human blood and brains as well as in medicinal plants and foods. It must be stressed, however, that in plasma and brain tissue there are also other benzodiazepine-like compounds termed 'endozepines' which are not halogenated. A synthetic pathway for the production of benzodiazepine-like compounds and endozepines has not yet been found, hence it may be surmised that these compounds could be of exogenous source. Changes in the level of endogenous circulating benzodiazepines due to food or drug ingestion could be responsible for pathological conditions. Clinical experiments were designed in order to study the levels of the endogenous benzodiazepines in vegetables and in the blood of control subjects and of cirrhotic patients. These patients accumulate benzodiazepines because of decreased liver metabolization capacity and impaired renal secretion, reaching plasma concentrations similar to those recorded in commercial benzodiazepine consumers.", 
    "82": "We determined whether pancreatic adaptation to a high-protein diet depends on ingested protein in the intestinal lumen and whether such adaptation depends on a CCK or capsaicin-sensitive vagal afferent pathway in pancreaticobiliary-diverted (PBD) rats. Feeding a high-casein (60%) diet but not a high-amino acid diet to PBD rats increased pancreatic trypsin and chymotrypsin activities compared with those after feeding a 25% casein diet. In contrast, feeding both the high-nitrogen diets induced pancreatic hypertrophy in PBD rats. These pancreatic changes by the diets were abolished by treatment with devazepide, a CCK-A receptor antagonist. Protease zymogen mRNA abundance in the PBD rat was not increased by feeding the high-casein diet and was decreased by devazepide. Perivagal capsaicin treatment did not influence the values of any pancreatic variables in PBD rats fed the normal or high-casein diet. We concluded that luminal protein or peptides were responsible for the bile pancreatic juice-independent induction of pancreatic proteases on feeding a high-protein diet. The induction was found to be dependent on the direct action of CCK on the pancreas. Pancreatic growth induced by high-protein feeding in PBD rats may depend at least partly on absorbed amino acids.", 
    "83": "We examined the effects of kainic acid (KA)-induced seizure on the expression of the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) gene in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of rats using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Subcutaneous administration of KA (12 mg/kg) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats caused a progressive development of seizure behavior. An induction of the PACAP gene expression in the medial parvocellular part of the PVN (mpPVN) was observed 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h after subcutaneous administration of KA. From a nearly undetectable level, PACAP gene expression increased in the mpPVN and reached maximum 12 h after subcutaneous administration of KA. PACAP gene expression returned to near basal level 48 h after stimulation with KA. Using a specific monoclonal PACAP antibody, PACAP immunoreactivity (-IR) gradually increased during the following 24 h after KA administration. In controls, PACAP-IR was located exclusively in nerve fibers of the mpPVN, whereas KA administration induced PACAP-IR in cell bodies of the mpPVN, and a dense accumulation of PACAP-IR nerve fibers in the external zone of the median eminence was observed. Induction of the PACAP gene expression following KA-induced seizure was significantly reduced by pretreatment with diazepam or MK-801 (nonselective N-methly-D-aspartate receptor antagonist). These results suggest that PACAP in the hypothalamo-adenohypophysial system may have a hypophysiotropic role during KA-induced seizure.",

The BIOMED-system [8] was used for statistical evaluation.", 
    "86": "Neither midazolam nor flunitrazepam caused any statistically important alteration of lysozyme activity. However, clinically relevant concentrations of both benzodiazepines significantly enhanced beta-glucuronidase activity. The additives of flunitrazepam did not play any role.", 
    "87": "Surprisingly enough, midazolam and flunitrazepam increased the activity of beta-glucuronidase released from PMNL in vitro. At present, this result can neither be explained nor can its importance be estimated. On the other hand, the benzodiazepines did not relevantly influence lysozyme activity.", 
    "88": "This study was undertaken to investigate simultaneously the influence of coinduction with propofol and midazolam on sympathoadrenergic and hemodynamic reactions and stress response during the extended induction period of TIVA.", 
    "89": "2 x 20 patients over the 60th year of life with major visceral surgery were investigated in a prospective randomized design. All patients received about 0.1 mg/kg BW midazolam for oral premedication. In the midazolam-group, induction of TIVA was undertaken with 0.05 mg/kg BW midazolam, 2.5 micrograms/kg BW fentanyl and 1.0 mg/kg BW propofol (1 min later). Controls received 2.5 micrograms/kg BW fentanyl and 2.0 mg/kg BW propofol. After muscle relaxation with 0.1 mg/kg BW vecuronium, TIVA was conducted in both groups with 8-5 mg/kg BW/h propofol and bolus injections of fentanyl with respect to clinical demands. Beyond consumption of anesthetics and recovery, sympathoadrenergic and hemodynamic reactions and SEF90 were investigated at 6 time points before induction of anesthesia and at skin incision. Plasma levels of ADH, ACTH and cortisol were measured twice before induction and at skin incision.", 
    "90": "Biometric data of both groups were comparable, and mean age was over 65 years. In the midazolam-group, co-induction with a mean dosage of 3.8 mg midazolam halved the induction dose of propofol and reduced the propofol demand during the following course of anesthesia as well, achieving a significant over all reduction of 200 mg propofol (p = 0.04). With respect to recovery from anesthesia more than 90 min later, no significant differences were found. Plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and adrenaline dropped significantly in both groups (p < 0.0001), as well as mean arterial pressure and heart rate (Fig. 1 and 2). For ADH, ACTH, cortisol and SEF90, no statistical differences were observed. Plasma-concentrations of midazolam were significantly higher in the midazolam-group.", 
    "91": "In elderly patients, co-induction with 0.05 mg/kg BW midazolam halved the induction dose of propofol and led to a further dose reduction with maintained hypnotic potency. However, the halvage of propofol induction dose had no effect on the reduction of the sympathoadrenergic tone with decrease of blood pressure and heart rate. The overall moderation of the stress response was comparable as well. Thus, both induction regimens investigated in this study cannot be recommended in patients with severe hemodynamic disorders like hemorrhagic or cardiac shock. The propofol reduction should be primarily considered under economic aspects.",

In 1998, treatment with olanzapine was started when he suffered acute decompensation on top of his disorganized condition which had an adverse effect on his symptoms. In a short space of time, a very satisfactory improvement was seen, not only in his symptoms but also in his social integration. This improvement has been sustained throughout two and a half years of follow-up. The perspectives offered by the new antipsychotic drugs in the management of acute episodes of schizophrenia are discussed in the light of recent data from the literature and lead to a reconsideration of our therapeutic practices.",

This combination takes advantage of the ability of EMLC to manipulate retention and enhance separation efficiency solely through changes in the potential applied to a conductive stationary phase, thereby minimizing complications because of possible changes in analyte ionization efficiencies when gradient elution techniques are used. Three examples are presented that demonstrate the attributes of this EMLC/electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS) coupling. The first two examples involve the separation of mixtures of corticosteroids or of benzodiazepines, showing the general utility of the union for eluent identification and low-level detection. The ability to identify products from on-column redox transformations is also demonstrated using the benzodiazepine mixture. The third example investigates the electrooxidation of aniline by utilizing an EMLC column as an on-line electrochemical reactor and product separator and ES-MS for detection and product identification.",

    "106": "Erection is a rare event during lower urinary tract surgery. When it is extremely refractory, endoscopy is impossible and the lower urinary tract surgery may need to be deferred. The development of erection during spinal anaesthesia is due to manipulations before complete installation of sensory block or incomplete blockade of sacral segments (S2 to S4) supplying the nervi erigentes. The mechanism of erection during general anaesthesia remains poorly elucidated. General anaesthesia may suppress central or peripheral sympathetic control of flaccidity. The peripheral target could be the smooth muscle of the cavernous tissue, either by a direct action or via alpha-adrenergic receptors. Psychogenic and reflexogenic stimuli have also been proposed, possibly facilitated by amplification of sensations during stage II anaesthesia. The various treatments are based on experience acquired in the field of priapism. Systemic treatments such as ketamine an beta 2 mimetics or benzodiazepines are not always effective and are associated with considerable adverse effects. Intracavernous injections of alpha-adrenergic drugs constitute the treatment of choice. Phenylephrine and etilefrine are preferred because of their rapid efficacy and particularly their only moderate cardiovascular adverse effects.", 
    "107": "Peripheral benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor (PBR) and diazepam-binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA-binding protein (DBI/ACBP) characterized as a ligand at central BDZ receptors, at PBR with involvement in the regulation of steroidogenesis, and as an intracellular acyl-CoA transporter, are both known to interact with BDZ in adult systems. We investigated their expression after prenatal exposure to BDZ. Diazepam (1.25 mg/kg per day s.c.) was administered to time-pregnant Long Evans rats from gestational day (GD) 14 to 20. Expression of mRNAs encoding for PBR and for DBI/ACBP was studied in the same animals with (33)P-labeled 60 mer oligonucleotides (oligos) by in situ hybridization at GD20, and with (32)P-labeled oligos by Northern blot in steroidogenic and immune organs at postnatal day (PN) 14 and in adult offspring. Prenatal diazepam increased DBI/ACBP mRNA expression in male fetal adrenal and in fetal and PN14 testis. Thymus exhibited increased DBI/ACBP mRNA in male fetuses and in adult female offspring, and reduced organ weight at PN14 in both sexes. In female spleen, an increase in DBI/ACBP mRNA and a decrease in PBR mRNA was seen at PN14. Apart from the finding in spleen, no drug-induced changes in PBR mRNA were observed. The effects of prenatal diazepam were superimposed on treatment-independent sex differences in DBI/ACBP mRNA and PBR mRNA expression. Our data indicate that expression of DBI/ACBP mRNA in steroidogenic and immune organs can be affected by exposure to BDZ during ontogeny, while PBR mRNA expression appears to be less sensitive. They further reveal marked sex differences in the developmental patterns of the two proteins during pre- and postpubertal ontogeny.", 
    "108": "Previous work from our laboratory has demonstrated the presence of high-affinity binding sites for [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine ([3H]NBTI), a marker of adenosine uptake systems, in the mitochondrial fraction of rat testis. Here, we characterize this system functionally through [3H]adenosine uptake assays. This system (K(m)=2+/-1.3 microM; V(max)=86.2+/-15.5 pmol/mg protein/min) was found to be saturable, non sodium-dependent and sensitive to temperature, pH and osmolarity. [3H]Adenosine incorporation was potently inhibited by hydroxynitrobenzylthioguanosine (HNBTG, IC(50)=3 nM) although NBTI inhibited this uptake weakly (IC(50)=72. 7+/-37.1 microM). Dilazep>dipyridamole>/=hexobendine inhibited [3H]adenosine incorporation at low micromolar concentrations. The nucleosides inosine and uridine were weak inhibitors of this system. The adenosine receptor ligands N(6)-phenylisopropyladenosine (PIA) and 2-chloroadenosine inhibited the uptake only at micromolar concentrations. Neither 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)-adenosine (NECA) nor theophylline inhibited adenosine uptake by more than 60% but the mitochodrial benzodiazepine receptor ligands 4'-chloro-diazepam (Ro 5-4864) and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl) isoquinoline carboxamide (PK 11195) were able to inhibit it. The lack of inhibition by the blockers of the mitochondrial adenine-nucleotide carrier, atractyloside and alpha, beta-methylene-ATP, indicates that [3H]adenosine uptake occurs via a transporter other than this carrier. All these results support the existence of an equilibrative adenosine transport system, which might mediate the passage of adenosine formed in the mitochondria to the cytoplasm.", 
    "109": "In this study, we examined the effect of clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol on the neuropathology (i.e. neuronal vacuolization) and the expression of Fos-like protein and c-fos mRNA in the retrosplenial cortex of female Sprague-Dawley rats induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine. Pretreatment (15 min) with clozapine or olanzapine, but not risperidone or haloperidol, blocked the neuronal vacuolization produced by dizocilpine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in the rat retrosplenial cortex in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, pretreatment (15 min) with clozapine or olanzapine, but not risperidone or haloperidol, significantly attenuated the expression of Fos-like protein in the retrosplenial cortex induced by dizocilpine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in a dose-dependent manner. The marked expression of c-fos mRNA in the rat retrosplenial cortex induced by the administration of dizocilpine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) was significantly attenuated by pretreatment (15 min) with clozapine (10 mg/kg) or olanzapine (10 mg/kg), but not risperidone (10 mg/kg) or haloperidol (10 mg/kg). The present results suggest that pharmacologically relevant doses of clozapine or olanzapine, but not risperidone or haloperidol, block the neuropathological changes and the expression of Fos-like protein and c-fos mRNA in the rat retrosplenial cortex elicited by the administration of dizocilpine. It is possible that the blockade of dizocilpine-induced neuropathological changes by clozapine and olanzapine may be related to the unique antipsychotic actions of these drugs in schizophrenic patients, although this remains to be verified.", 
    "110": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) agonist [(3)H]Ro5-4864 has been shown to bind with high affinity to the human breast cancer cell line BT-20. Therefore, we investigated different human breast cancer cell lines with regard to binding to [(3)H]Ro5-4864 and staining with the PBR-specific monoclonal antibody 8D7. Results were correlated with cell proliferation characteristics. In flow cytometric analysis, the estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cell lines BT-20, MDA-MB-435-S, and SK-BR-3 showed significantly higher PBR expression (relative fluorescence intensity) than the ER-positive cells T47-D, MCF-7 and BT-474 (P<0.05). Accordingly, BT-20 and MDA-MB-435-S had the highest capacity for binding [(3)H]-Ro5-4864, while the ER-positive cells exhibited only low binding of the benzodiazepine. PBR expression correlated inversely with cell doubling time (r = 0.78) and positively with Ki-67 expression (r = 0.77). The amount of mitochondria was significantly higher in cells with high PBR expression. As PBR could be demonstrated only after permeabilization of cells, PBR is suggested to be localized within the cytoplasm. Moreover, colocalization of PBR and mitochondria was shown by confocal microscopy analysis. The highest amounts of both PBR and mitochondria were found in cell lines with high mitotic activity. Therefore, it is concluded that the level of PBR is dependent on the number of mitochondria. PBR and its putative endogenous ligand diazepam-binding inhibitor are possibly involved in the regulation of cell proliferation of human breast cancer cell lines.",

Most suicides occurred in people over 60 years of age, with older women making up a considerable proportion of cases as compared with other methods of suicide. In 40% of cases the deceased was suffering from a serious illness. Autopsy findings were usually minimal, with facial, conjunctival and visceral petechiae present in a minority of cases. One or more drugs were detected in the blood in 92.6% of cases where toxicologic testing was performed. Benzodiazepines, diphenhydramine and antidepressants were the most common drugs found, with diphenhydramine the most common drug present at an elevated concentration. Information at the scene from \"right to die\" societies was uncommon. One quarter of decedents took additional measures, besides the use of drugs or alcohol, to ensure the rapidity, certainty or comfort of their death. This study further elucidates the characteristics of this uncommon method of suicide.

Olanzapine, a new antipsychotic drug, shares many pharmacological and clinical properties with clozapine. However, in patients treated with olanzapine, no case of seizure induction has been reported so far, and the EEG has not been studied systematically. We examined the EEGs of patients with schizophrenia treated with either olanzapine (N = 9) or clozapine (N = 9) prior to medication and 3 to 7 weeks afterwards. Clozapine induced significant EEG slowing present in 78% of the patients, and definite epileptiform activity appeared in 33%. Olanzapine also induced significant EEG slowing, but less frequently (in 44% of the patients) and less pronounced than clozapine. Olanzapine had no significant effect an epileptiform activity, but in one patient, an isolated sharp/slow-wave complex was observed. These preliminary data suggest that olanzapine induces EEG slowing to a lower extent than clozapine. Olanzapine's possible effect an the seizure threshold deserves further attention.",

    "127": "We have investigated the effects of 2-ethylamino-6-chloro-4-methyl-4-phenyl-4H-3,1-benzoxazine hydrochloride (etifoxine) on GABA(A) receptor function. Etifoxine displaced [(35)S]TBPS (t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate) from GABA(A) receptors of rat cortical membranes with an IC(50) of 6.7+/-0.8 microM and [(3)H]PK11195 from peripheral (mitochondrial)-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) of rat heart homogenates with an IC(50) of 27.3+/-1.0 microM. Etifoxine displayed anxiolytic properties in an anticonflict test in rats, and potentiated GABA(A) receptor-mediated membrane currents elicited by submaximal (5-10 microM) but not saturating (0.5 mM) concentrations of GABA in cultured rat hypothalamic and spinal cord dorsal horn neurones. In hypothalamic cultures, etifoxine induced a dose-dependent inward current for concentrations >1 microM which reflected the post-synaptic potentiation of a small ( approximately 20 pA) tonic and bicuculline-sensitive GABA(A) receptor-gated Cl(-) current. Etifoxine also increased the frequency of spontaneous and miniature GABAergic inhibitory post-synaptic currents without changing their amplitude and kinetic characteristics. Both effects of etifoxine were insensitive to flumazenil (10 microM), an antagonist of central-type benzodiazepine sites present at GABA(A) receptors, but were partly inhibited by PK11195 (10 microM) an antagonist of PBRs which control the synthesis of neurosteroids. Our results indicate that etifoxine potentiates GABA(A) receptor-function by a direct allosteric effect and by an indirect mechanism involving the activation of PBRs.", 
    "128": "Electrophysiological investigation of cultured cerebellar murine granule cells revealed differences between the GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory synapses and those on the cell body. Specifically, mIPSCs decayed more rapidly than cell body receptors deactivated, the mean single channel conductance at the synapse (32 pS) was greater than that at cell body (21 pS) and only cell body receptors were sensitive to Zn(2+) (150 microM), which depressed response amplitude by 82+/-5% and almost doubled the rate of channel deactivation. The GABA(A) receptor alpha6 subunit is selectively expressed in cerebellar granule cells. Although concentrated at synapses, it is also found on extrasynaptic membranes. Using a mouse line (Deltaalpha6lacZ) lacking this subunit, we investigated its role in the somato-synaptic differences in GABA(A) receptor function. All differences between cell body and synaptic GABA(A) receptors observed in wild-type (WT) granule cells persisted in Deltaalpha6lacZ cells, thus demonstrating that they are not specifically due to the cellular distribution of the alpha6 subunit. However, mIPSCs from WT and Deltaalpha6lacZ cells differed in both their kinetics (faster decay in WT cells) and underlying single channel conductance (32 pS WT, 25 pS Deltaalpha6lacZ). This provides good evidence for a functional contribution of the alpha6 subunit to postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in these cells. Despite this, deactivation kinetics of mIPSCs in WT and Deltaalpha6lacZ granule cells exhibited similar benzodiazepene (BDZ) sensitivity. This suggests that the enhanced BDZ-induced ataxia seen in Deltaalpha6lacZ mice may reflect physiological activity at extrasynaptic receptors which, unlike those at synapses, display differential BDZ-sensitivity in WT and Deltaalpha6lacZ granule cells (Jones, A.M., Korpi, E.R., McKernan, R.M., Nusser, Z., Pelz, R., Makela, R., Mellor, J.R., Pollard, S., Bahn, S., Stephenson, F.A., Randall, A.D., Sieghart, W., Somogyi, P., Smith, A.J.H., Wisden, W., 1997.

    "129": "It has been shown that enhancing the function of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA decreases glutamatergic activity in the brain. Since increased glutamatergic activity is the major primary event that results in cell death following an acute hypoxic-ischaemic stroke, GABAmimetic drugs might therefore be expected to be neuroprotective. This review examines the evidence that GABAergic function is acutely depressed following an ischaemic insult, and also reviews the data that suggest that increasing cerebral GABA concentration has a neuroprotective effect, as does the administration of some (but not all) GABAmimetic agents. The GABA uptake inhibitor CI-966, the GABA(A) agonist muscimol and the GABA(A)mimetic clomethiazole have all been shown to be neuroprotective in animal models of stroke when given after the ischaemic insult. In contrast, benzodiazepines and particularly barbiturates, although potent GABA(A) potentiators, have shown little promise as neuroprotectants. The diversity of GABA(A) receptor subtypes and the in vivo efficacy of certain GABA(A) receptor ligands in animal models of stroke suggests that GABAmimetic drugs are an undervalued approach to stroke therapy.", 
    "130": "We examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous (1-5 mg/kg) and oral clozapine (2.5-10 mg/kg) in rats (terminal half-life=81.8 min; oral bioavailability=5.32%). Both dose- and concentration-effect relations of clozapine were characterized. Clozapine's effects were similar to those of benzodiazepines because of the similarity in effect-time profiles between the two classes of drugs. The IC(50) value increased as a function of dose; consequently, clozapine's relative potency decreased linearly with the logarithm of AUC((0-infinity)), or bioavailable dose regardless of route of administration. The IC(50) is an index for the sensitivity of behavioral performance to clozapine; relative potency provides an index for estimating the extent of acute tolerance. As IC(50) increases, relative potency decreases, and consequently, acute tolerance increases. Our results demonstrated that greater acute tolerance was observed for i.v. clozapine than for p.o. clozapine; however, clozapine exhibited a single concentration-effect relation across dose and route of administration after correcting for relative potencies.",

The potency of each antagonist was determined, expressed as a ratio of the potency of each other antagonist and compared with the potency ratios of the antagonists for each of the defined muscarinic receptors (M(1)-M(4)), as recorded in the literature.

Hippocampal slices were prepared from rats administered flurazepam orally for 1 week, 2 days after ending drug treatment. Slices were superfused with HCO(3)(-)-aCSF or with HEPES-aCSF (without HCO(3)(-)) plus 50 microM APV and 10 microM DNQX. The micropipette contained 130 mM CsCl and 1 microM QX-314. GABA(A) receptors located on pyramidal cell somata or dendrites were activated monosynaptically by maximal stimulation of GABAergic terminals at the stratum oriens-pyramidale (SO-SP) or stratum lacunosum-molecular (S-L-M) border, respectively. In HCO(3)(-)-aCSF, there was a significant reduction in synaptic-conductance in flurazepam-treated neurons following both SO-SP (control: 1058 pS, flurazepam: 226 pS, P<0.01) and S-L-M (control 998 pS, flurazepam: 179 pS, P<0.01) stimulation, as well as the total charge transfer, indicating a decreased HCO(3)(-)-Cl(-) flux. In HEPES-aCSF, the synaptic conductance and total charge transfer, and thus Cl(-) flux, was unchanged in flurazepam-treated neurons (SO-SP: control 588 pS, flurazepam: 580 pS, P>0.05; S-L-M: control 595 pS, flurazepam: 527 pS, P>0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that a reduction in HCO(3)(-) flux may play a prominent role in mediating the action of GABA and that a loss of HCO(3)(-) conductance may significantly contribute to impaired GABA(A) receptor function after chronic benzodiazepine treatment.",

The paucity of data available regarding the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism of ET hinders the development of innovative approaches to pharmacotherapeutic treatments. Options for drug therapy include the use of primidone, beta-adrenergic blockers, such as propranolol, alcohol, and other drugs, such as benzodiazepines, gabapentin, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, clozapine, flunarizine, clonidine, and the methylxanthine derivative theophylline. Chemodenervation with botulinum toxin type A may be a therapeutic option for selected patients with ET.

    "140": "We review recent findings pertaining to several environmental agents (ethanol, phencyclidine, ketamine, nitrous oxide, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, halothane, isoflurane, and propofol) that have the potential to delete large numbers of neurons from the developing brain by a newly discovered mechanism involving interference in the action of neurotransmitters [glutamate and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) at (italic)N(/italic)-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)] and GABA(subscript)A(/subscript) receptors during the synaptogenesis period, also known as the brain growth-spurt period. Transient interference (lasting >= 4 hr) in the activity of these transmitters during the synaptogenesis period (the last trimester of pregnancy and the first several years after birth in humans) causes millions of developing neurons to commit suicide (die by apoptosis). Many of these agents are drugs of abuse (ethanol is a prime example) to which the human fetal brain may be exposed during the third trimester by drug-abusing mothers. Ethanol triggers massive apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain by interfering with both the NMDA and GABA(subscript)A(/subscript) receptor systems, and this can explain the reduced brain mass and lifelong neurobehavioral disturbances associated with intrauterine exposure of the human fetus to ethanol (fetal alcohol syndrome). Exposure of the immature brain in a medical treatment context is also of concern because many of these agents are drugs used frequently as sedatives, tranquilizers, anticonvulsants, or anesthetics in pediatric and/or obstetrical medicine. Because this is a newly discovered mechanism, further research will be required to fully ascertain the nature and degree of risk posed by exposure of the developing human brain to environmental agents that act by this mechanism.",

All goats received all treatments with at least a 7-day interval between treatments. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) changes were observed in some of the measured cardiopulmonary variables for xylazine and midazolam/ ketamine. Xylazine administration resulted in statistically significant decreases in minute volume, arterial partial pressure of oxygen, heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. The increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide was not statistically significant. For the midazolam/ketamine combination, the decrease in tidal volume was statistically significant, but not the decrease in minute volume and increase in arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide. The decrease in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen was also statistically significant. The mean arterial blood pressure for the combination was statistically significantly higher compared to xylazine. The changes in cardiopulmonary variables after midazolam administration were not statistically significant, such as tidal and minute volume, arterial partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide. However, clinically significant effects such as hypoventilation and hypoxia were observed after its administration. The change in mean arterial blood pressure was minimal.",

Using performance-based standard criteria, reproducible spectra can be obtained by CID in the electrospray-transport region and searched using a database created using the same performance criteria. To generate library-searchable mass spectra, the instrument was tuned to standard conditions that correspond to low, mid, and high fragmentation energies. The instrument was tuned using ion ratios relative to a given peak in a tune compound for each energy level. The library was evaluated using a set of 22 benzodiazepines. The CID libraries were found to be reproducible, both on the same instrument and on different instruments of the same type. Also, the libraries were found to be independent of flow rate and solvent system. The library was expanded to include 16 sulfonylurea herbicides and tested using spiked water samples.

SR146131 inhibited [125I]CCK-8-S binding to IMR-32 cells at nanomolar concentrations. SR146131 and CCK-8-S increased intracellular free Ca(2+) levels ([Ca(2+)](i)) in the same concentration range (EC(50)=6+/-2.3 and 1.3+/-0.14 nM, respectively). Although the shape of the [Ca(2+)](i) increase induced by CCK-8-S and SR146131 was slightly different, extracellular Ca(2+) removal affected the response of both compounds to a similar degree, and the response of both compounds was essentially due to Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. This was also confirmed by measuring the [Ca(2+)](i) response of single cells: both compounds induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations at subnanomolar concentrations and elicited a large peak increase in [Ca(2+)](i) at higher concentrations (EC(50)=0.5+/-0.04 and 5.7+/-1.9 nM for CCK-8-S and SR146131, respectively). Both CCK-8-S and SR146131 induced a sustained increase of phosphoinositide turnover in these cells, and acted at similar concentrations (EC(50)=2.7+/-0.7 and 6+/-3.1 nM, respectively), although the maximal effect of SR146131 was somewhat lower than the effect of CCK-8-S. These data show that SR146131 activates human CCK(1) receptors on IMR-32 cells in a manner and with a potency similar to that of CCK-8-S.",

The negative modulator, (-)1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7, 8-methylenedioxy-4,5-dihydro-3-methylcarbamoyl-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53784), dose-dependently suppressed AMPA responses. Its concentration-response curve was shifted to the right in a parallel fashion by all positive modulators, indicating a competitive type of interaction. However, the relative potencies of the positive modulators were different with regard to the enhancement of AMPA responses and the reversal of GYKI 53784-induced inhibition, respectively.

    "151": "The molecular pathogenesis of hepatoblastomas in the B6C3F1 mouse is unclear but may involve alterations in the beta-catenin/Wnt signaling pathway as was recently described for chemically induced hepatocellular neoplasms and human liver cancers. The objective of this study was to characterize the mutation frequency and spectrum of beta-catenin mutations and the intracellular localization of beta-catenin protein accumulation in chemically induced hepatoblastomas. In this study, beta-catenin mutations were identified in all 19 anthraquinone-induced hepatoblastomas and all 8 oxazepam-induced hepatoblastomas examined. Although several hepatoblastomas had multiple deletion and/or point mutations, the pattern of mutations in the hepatoblastomas did not differ from that identified in hepatocellular neoplasms. In a majority of the hepatoblastomas (six of seven) examined by immunohistochemical methods, both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of beta-catenin protein were detected, whereas in hepatocellular adenomas, carcinomas, and normal liver only membrane staining was observed. Our data suggest that beta-catenin mutations and the subsequent translocation of beta-catenin protein from the cell membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus may be critical steps in providing hepatocellular proliferative lesions with the growth advantage to progress to hepatoblastoma.",

In autoradiographic studies, high level specific binding of [3H]PK11195 was observed in the olfactory bulb. Intravenous administration of PK11195 dose-dependently (0.03-3 mg/kg) inhibited ex vivo binding of [3H]PK11195 in the olfactory bulb. Likewise, N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (DAA1106), a newly identified peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-specific ligand, dose-dependently (0.1-100 mg/kg) reduced ex vivo binding of [3H]PK11195, when administered intraperitoneally. In contrast, clonazepam, a central benzodiazepine receptor-specific agonist, had negligible effects on ex vivo binding of [3H]PK11195. We propose that the ex vivo receptor binding technique we used will facilitate determination of in vivo receptor occupancy of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor.",

The authors confront this difficulty by using an injured subject population that had extensive psychiatric and medical evaluations. Those who developed somatoform pain disorder (SPD) were compared with a control group who did not. The SPD group had distinctive associated factors: more sites of pain, spread of pain beyond area of original injury, and substantially more opiate and benzodiazepine use. Compensation/litigation influenced symptoms more in the SPD group. Psychotherapists often supported the patient's viewpoint that the pain was physical and to be endured.", 
    "163": "Decreased activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in CNS can be epileptogenic. Manipulation of the GABA system has been a target for development of antiepileptic drugs. The different ways for augmenting gabaergic inhibition by conventional and new AEDs are presented in this paper. Among the I generation, barbiturates and benzodiazepines are potent anticonvulsants that act as GABA modulators in postsynaptic GABA-A receptor complex but their usefulness is limited by dependence and tolerance to antiseizure activity. The II generation drugs vigabatrin and tiagabine, and to some extent gabapentin have been developed by a rationale strategy and none of them exert direct action in GABA receptors. Only two former drugs exhibit selective, strictly defined activity: vigabatrine is an irreversible inhibitor of GABA-aminotransferase and tiagabine acts as a GABA-uptake inhibitor from synaptic cleft into neurons and glia. Gabapentin binds to a novel receptors in epileptogenic areas in CNS and enhances GABA turnover. Drugs with multiple mechanisms of action, felbamate and topiramate not only potentiate gabaergic inhibition in several ways but also diminish the activity of excitatory amino acids at their NMDA or AMPA receptors; the later mechanism seems to be essential for their potential neuroprotective activity in epileptogenesis. None of gabamimetic drugs provide optimal seizure control but better tolerability of newer ones and well-established mechanisms of action provide possible harmless therapy.",

To investigate the effect of the hypnotic zolpidem, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, drug or placebo were administered to eight young, healthy men prior to bedtime. The subjects were sleep-deprived to promote sleep during the 4-h recording period in the positron emission tomography scanner. Intravenous injections of labelled water were administered during pre-drug wakefulness, and during Stage 2, Stage 4 and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, each injection being followed by an emission scan. Statistical parametric mapping was used to investigate the effects of treatment and sleep states. During sleep (combined Stages 2 and 4, and REM sleep) relative rCBF was lower after zolpidem than after placebo in the basal ganglia and insula, and higher in the parietal cortex. A 'multiple study' analysis of REM sleep revealed that rCBF in the anterior cingulum was lower after zolpidem than after placebo, whereas rCBF in the occipital and parietal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus and cerebellum was higher. When the pooled data (drug and placebo) of Stages 2 and 4 were compared with wakefulness, rCBF was lower in prefrontal cortex and insula, and higher in the occipital and parietal cortex. The results indicate that some differences in rCBF from wakefulness to non-REM sleep are further augmented by zolpidem.",
