    "0": "Pretreatment of patients with diazepam has been reported to reduce the plasma half-life of epidurally administered bupivacaine. The concentrations of bupivacaine used to estimate its plasma half-life may be influenced by input into the vascular system (rate and extent of absorption from the epidural space) and disposition (distribution and elimination). We conducted a study in Rhesus monkeys in which the input function was known and the influence of intravenous diazepam on the disposition of intravenous bupivacaine could be delineated. Results indicated no differences in the primary pharmacokinetic parameters (i.e., total clearance and volume of distribution) for the disposition of bupivacaine. To determine whether the apparent disparity between these results and a previous study might be due to a diazepam-induced alteration in the input function, the influence of intravenous diazepam or saline on the mean absorption time of epidurally administered bupivacaine was also studied in monkeys. Epidural bupivacaine was completely absorbed whether the animals received intravenous saline or intravenous diazepam. No significant differences in pharmacokinetic parameters were found between animals pretreated with intravenous saline or intravenous diazepam and receiving an epidural injection of bupivacaine. The mean residence time of bupivacaine in the body (P less than 0.01) and plasma elimination half-life (P less than 0.005) were significantly longer after epidural administration than after intravenous administration. Intravenous diazepam does not alter the pharmacokinetics of intravenously or epidurally administered bupivacaine.", 
    "1": "Three groups of water-deprived male rats were given the choice of 0.05% sodium saccharin solution and water; 0.0005% quinine solution and water; water in both containers. N'-Methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG 7142), a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, dose-dependently (2.5-10 mg X kg-1 i.p.) reduced intake of fluid in each group. The saccharin-choice group were most sensitive, showing a significant reduction at 2.5 mg X kg-1. Preference for the saccharin solution was reduced by FG 7142 but it did not increase aversion to the quinine solution. Hence, FG 7142 did not generally increase the rejection of flavoured solutions in a two-bottle test. A previously proposed \"proconflict\" effect of FG 7142 is discussed, in the light of these results.", 
    "2": "The binding of pirenzepine to digitonin-solubilized rat myocardial muscarinic acetylcholine receptors has been examined at 4 degrees C. Solubilization produced only small changes in the binding of N-methylscopolamine and atropine. In contrast to the low affinity binding of pirenzepine found to be present in in the membranes, high affinity binding was detected in the soluble preparation. In both preparations, pirenzepine binding was complex. High affinity pirenzepine binding (KD approximately 3 X 10(-8)M) to the soluble myocardial receptors could be monitored directly using [3H]-pirenzepine. [3H]-pirenzepine-labelled soluble myocardial receptors have a sedimentation coefficient of 11.1 s. This indicates that [3H]-pirenzepine binds predominantly to the uncoupled form of the receptor. However, [3H]-pirenzepine-agonist competition experiments indicated that the high affinity pirenzepine binding sites are capable of coupling with a guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein. Pirenzepine affinities for the soluble myocardial receptors were unaffected by their state of association with the GTP-binding proteins found in the heart. The equilibrium binding properties of the soluble cortical and myocardial receptors were very similar. However, the binding kinetics of the myocardial receptor were much slower. It appears that the membrane environment can affect the affinity of pirenzepine for the rat myocardial muscarinic receptor. Removal of the constraint by solubilization allows the expression of high affinity pirenzepine binding.", 
    "3": "Muscimol microinjected into the lateral septum of the rat produced a dose dependent increase in punished responding over the dose range of 100 pg-5 ng. The higher doses used (10 ng and 1 microgram) produced sedation and ataxia, markedly reducing the number of approaches to the water spout. This steep, biphasic dose response curve for the anticonflict actions of muscimol may explain contradictory findings in the literature concerning GABAergic involvement in the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines. The low dose of muscimol needed to produce a significant anticonflict effect in the lateral septum suggests that this nucleus may be a critical site in anxiety-related behaviors.", 
    "4": "A mirror-covered staircase was erected to study screening methods, and several basic experiments were carried out using it. The staircase consisted of 5 steps each measuring 15 cm long by 20 cm wide by 6 cm high, fabricated in a wooden device measuring 95 cm by 20 cm by 30 cm high. The inner surfaces were all mirrored, including steps, floors and walls. At the foot of the stairs, a rat weighing about 200 g was placed quietly with the back toward the stairs. The frequencies of rearing and climbing on the stairs were recorded for the subsequent 3 and 10 min. The recordings were also performed using 2 rats placed simultaneously and in a non-mirrored device of the same structure. When mirrored, the frequencies of rearing and climbing were much higher, and the average duration lasted also longer than when non-mirrored. To compare the results among the following 3 qualifications: i) a rat in the mirrored device, ii) 2 rats in the mirrored device, and iii) 2 rats in the non-mirrored device, the highest frequency of rearing for the first 3 min was observed in i). Effects of nitrazepam, phenobarbital and morphine were compared between mirrored and non-mirrored qualifications. No significant differences between them were observed in the drug-induced changes in the behaviors. Although the mirrored-staircase test as a screening method was almost identical to the non-mirrored test, it was superior in the point of continuation of augmented frequencies. As a fact arousing interest, the subject received more potent stimulation from its self image exposed on the mirrors than the image of another individual of the same species (within the same device).", 
    "5": "This study explored the relation between the reinforcing properties of different drugs and their subjective effects. Preference for a drug (amphetamine or diazepam) over placebo was measured in a choice procedure, and mood changes after drug administration were monitored by self-report questionnaires. Individual differences in behavioral drug preferences were then examined for their relationships to subjective drug responses as well as other subject variables. In Part I, the subjective effects of amphetamine were compared in those subjects who consistently preferred (i.e. chose) amphetamine over placebo, and those who preferred placebo over amphetamine. The two subject groups showed markedly different subjective responses to the stimulant drug: the choosers reported increased positive mood and euphoria, whereas the non-choosers reported only increased anxiety and depression. In Part II, the subjective effects of diazepam in consistent choosers of diazepam were compared to the subjective effects in consistent non-choosers of the drug. The non-choosers showed appreciable subjective effects, which were predominantly sedative in quality. In contrast to the results with amphetamine, the choosers showed negligible subjective drug effects. These results underline the importance of considering more than one response measure when attempting to characterize the reinforcing effects of drugs.", 
    "6": "Photosensitivity as a side effect in treatment with systemic drugs occurs both as a phototoxic, non-immunologic phenomenon and as a photoallergic, immune-dependent reaction. The former principle is the more common one, and is seen with a number of non-related, widely used drug groups such as the tetracyclines, the phenothiazines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, nalidixic acid, amiodarone and griseofulvin. For some of these drugs, for quinidine/quinine, and for the sulfonamides and related drugs, the reactions are probably also photoallergic. The majority of photosensitizing drugs have an action spectrum within UVA. Experimental studies have revealed that photoproducts and metabolites in some instances make important contributions to the biological photoreaction. For several of these drug groups, progress is presently underway in elucidating their mechanisms of action, as well as the relationship between chemical structure and in vivo photoactivity.", 
    "7": "The effect of pirenzepine, a specific muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist, on insulin and glucagon responses to an intravenous injection of glucose was investigated in eight normal adult subjects. These volunteers received two iv glucose tolerance tests (0.33 g/kg) before and after the oral administration of 125 mg of pirenzepine (three doses of 25 mg during the day before the experiment and a fourth dose of 50 mg 2 h before glucose injection). Treatment with pirenzepine neither altered basal blood glucose levels nor affected glucose tolerance after the injection of the glucose load. In addition, it did not modify basal plasma insulin and glucagon levels and the decrement of glucagon in response to glucose injection. In contrast, pirenzepine significantly decreased insulin release induced by glucose administration. In man, during the present experimental conditions, the muscarinic cholinergic system modulates insulin, but not glucagon response to an iv glucose injection.", 
    "8": "A modified Geller-Seifter paradigm was employed to test in male albino rats the effects of subthreshold doses of amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide (CDP), administered separately or in combination, on shock induced suppression of food-reinforced lever-pressing. MK-801, a newly synthesized sympathomimetic with anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, was also tested. dl-Amphetamine in doses of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg had no anxiolytic nor anxiogenic effects, but at 1.0 mg/kg it increased non-conflict responding. CDP in doses of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg had no significant effect on conflict and non-conflict responding. CDP in the dose of 0.8 mg/kg tended to increase conflict responding. Coadministration of amphetamine (0.2 mg/kg) and CDP (0.4 mg/kg) had a significant anti-conflict effect. MK-801 at 50 micrograms/kg and 100 micrograms/kg caused a significant increase in non-conflict responding. MK-801 at 50 micrograms/kg exerted also a significant anti-conflict effect. The disinhibitory effects of amphetamine coadministered with CDP were discussed in terms of a possible enhanced noradrenergic or dopaminergic activity and their interaction with GABA neurotransmission at GABA-benzodiazepine coupled sites.", 
    "9": "Sleep, a vital ingredient in life, is often taken for granted until something goes awry and sleep no longer comes easily. Occasional bouts of sleeplessness are normal, but for some persons, perhaps as much as 20% of the adult population, insomnia is a recurring problem for which they may turn to over-the-counter or prescription sleeping pills as a solution. In all but the most extreme cases, however, medication is not necessary and nondrug remedies are sufficient for lulling the patient back to sleep. In this article, Dr Fletcher describes what everyone should know about the complex process of sleep and offers suggestions, including some familiar old-fashioned home remedies, on what to do when sleep is evasive.", 
    "10": "Results of previous laboratory studies in humans suggest that the benzodiazepine diazepam has greater abuse liability than the benzodiazepine oxazepam. The validity of these laboratory-based experimental data were examined by analyzing Swedish data on drug abuse. Sales and prescription data showed that use of diazepam was somewhat lower than oxazepam, but of the same general order of magnitude (0.8:1). Prescription data showed that the drugs were prescribed for the same diagnostic indications. After adjustment for differences in use, 'prescription forgeries' and 'mentions in theft and loss reports' were found to be more frequent for diazepam than for oxazepam (2.3:1 and 2.5:1 for forgeries and theft/loss reports, respectively). This effect was consistent for each year examined (1982, 1983, 1984) and occurred when the data were recalculated to exclude Valium, the original and most widely known brand of diazepam. Finally, this pattern with prescription forgeries occurred across different geographical regions in Sweden (1982, 1983).", 
    "11": "An endogenous brain neuropeptide with 104 amino acid residues that modulates gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor function was termed DBI because it displaces diazepam from its specific brain binding sites. Tryptic digestion of DBI generates an octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) that is more potent than the parent compound in the displacement of specifically bound beta-[3H]carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester [( 3H]BCCM) and in proconflict action (Vogel test in thirsty rats). The proconflict action of ODN is antagonized by the imidobenzodiazepinone Ro 15-1788, which is a specific antagonist of beta-carboline and benzodiazepine recognition sites. The ODN amino acid sequence is Gln-Ala-Thr-Val-Gly-Asp-Val-Asn-Thr-Asp-Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys. The pharmacological properties associated with this sequence were confirmed by comparing the activity of ODN generated from tryptic digestion of DBI with that of ODN obtained by synthesis. Amidation of the terminal lysine of ODN produces a peptide (ODN-NH2) devoid of pharmacological activity. Three peptides containing the COOH-terminal segment of ODN were synthesized. All these peptides [Arg-Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys (octapeptide), Pro-Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys (heptapeptide), and Gly-Leu-Leu-Asp-Leu-Lys (hexapeptide)] express the displacing and proconflict actions of ODN. In primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells of rat, DBI, ODN, octapeptide, heptapeptide, and hexapeptide preferentially displace [3H]BCCM over [3H]flunitrazepam; moreover, they displace bound [3H]BCCM completely but [3H]flunitrazepam only by 50%. These data suggest that ODN includes a specific ligand for the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor regulatory site occupied by beta-carbolines. Using rabbit antibodies directed against the NH2-terminal portion of ODN, we detected ODN-like material in rat brain homogenates. However, whether this material is identical to the ODN generated by tryptic digestion of DBI remains to be established.", 
    "12": "The tolerance to the hypnotic effect of diazepam developed after a single exposure to diazepam in the presence or absence of cycloheximide, which blocks liver enzyme induction, was studied. At the high dose (30-35 mg/kg) used in this study, diazepam was found to be metabolized very rapidly in mice, consistent with previous findings using a much smaller dose (5 mg/kg). There was no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of diazepam in control and tolerant mice as observed by monitoring the plasma and brain concentrations of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam. It is concluded that acute tolerance to diazepam in mice may not be attributed to changes in pharmacokinetic factors.", 
    "13": "It has been postulated that esophageal retention of diazepam tablets is a problem of clinical significance, and that rectal administration is an advantageous alternative. To test this hypothesis, 100 patients were randomly allocated to premedication with either 15 mg diazepam orally or 10 mg diazepam as a rectal solution. A double dummy technique was used. A sedative effect was seen in 23 (50%) of the patients premedicated by mouth (O-group), but only in eight (20%) of those premedicated rectally (R-group) (P less than 0.05). Four patients (9%) in the O-group and seven (18%) in the R-group were unacceptably anxious before induction (n.s.). The plasma concentrations in the tablet group were nearly twice the concentrations found in the rectal-solution group, but no correlation between premedication effect and plasma concentration was found. Timing of premedication was very inaccurate, and this favored oral administration because of a more prolonged effect. No evidence of persistent esophageal retention was found.", 
    "14": "The kappa opioids tifluadom and U-50,488 H, when tested on spinal neurones of rats in vivo and frogs in vitro, had no selective effect on responses to microelectrophoretically or bath applied N-methyl-D-aspartate, quisqualate or kainate. In the same preparations ketamine selectively reduces responses to N-methyl-D-aspartate. Amino acid antagonism by dissociative anaesthetics and sigma opioids is thus not mediated by that binding site which kappa and sigma opioids have been reported to have in common.", 
    "15": "GABA activates specific ion channels in post-natal cerebellar neurons in primary culture generating Cl- currents that can be recorded with the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Evoked and spontaneous GABA-mediated synaptic activity can be recorded from cells kept in culture for a few days. Benzodiazepine and beta-carboline derivatives which bind with high affinity to the domains for allosteric regulation of GABA receptors facilitated and inhibited directly applied GABA responses and synaptically evoked Cl- currents recorded under voltage-clamp.", 
    "16": "The effects of selected modulators of GABAergic transmission, either alone or in combination, were tested for their potency on the seizure pattern and mortality induced by convulsant drugs in rat. Pentobarbital and diazepam were effective against both tonic and clonic seizure components induced by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The anticonvulsant profile of ethanol closely resembled that of pentobarbital. Pentobarbital, diazepam and ethanol did not modify seizures induced by strychnine. In contrast, progabide, a central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor agonist, caused significant protection only against convulsions induced by strychnine and its lethality, but did not protect against seizures induced by bicuculline or picrotoxin. Data on interaction of drugs with subprotective doses of these agents clearly demonstrated potentiation of the anticonvulsant actions of these modulators. Thus, seizures induced by bicuculline were more sensitive to the inhibition by pentobarbital in combination with diazepam or ethanol, while pentobarbital with progabide was equally effective against convulsions induced by GABA antagonists. Diazepam, in combination with progabide, blocked only convulsions induced by picrotoxin. Ethanol, in combination with either pentobarbital or with diazepam, was effective against all the three convulsant drugs. These results are consistent with the concept that drugs which facilitate GABAergic transmission are effective against seizures related to an impairment of GABA transmission. Further, the present data indicate that tonic seizures are more susceptible to the actions of drugs than the clonic component. Smaller doses of these drugs, alone or in combination, modified the seizure patterns and mortality, whereas at larger doses, the possible involvement of a nonspecific depressant action cannot be ruled out.", 
    "17": "Circadian rhythms, evident in a wide variety of physiological and behavioural parameters, are under the control of central neural pacemakers, the best characterized of which is the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus. The neurophysiological mechanisms involved in central pacemaker function are unknown. Recent biochemical, pharmacological and behavioural evidence suggests that the inhibitory transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), present in the small interneurones of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, plays an important role in circadian timekeeping. This has enabled the formulation of strategies for treatment of patients with manic depressive illness and certain sleep disorders in which disorders of circadian timekeeping may be fundamental.", 
    "18": "Light microscopic autoradiography of bound radiolabeled ligands was used to describe the distribution of six receptor types in the dorsal and ventral mouse cochlear nuclei: Glycine receptor ([3H]strychnine); GABA receptor ([3H]muscimol); benzodiazepine receptor ([3H]flunitrazepam); adenosine receptor ([3H]cyclohexyladenosine); muscarinic ACh receptor ([3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate); histamine receptor ([3H]mepyramine). The most intense [3H]strychnine labeling was observed in the deep region of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN), with slightly lower levels in the molecular and pyramidal layers. Highest density of [3H]muscimol binding sites was observed in the granule cell layer of the posterior ventral nucleus (PVCN) and in the pyramidal layer of the DCN. Diffuse [3H]flunitrazepam labeling was distributed over all laminar regions of the DCN; the highest grain density was observed over the granule cell layer of the PVCN. Intense [3H]cyclohexyladenosine labeling was seen over the molecular layer, possibly extending into the pyramidal layer, of the DCN. The granule cell layer of the PVCN was also densely labeled. High concentrations of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate sites were seen in the molecular layer, possibly extending into the pyramidal layer, of the DCN. A thin band of high grain density was also visible over the granule cell layer of the PVCN. Moderate, diffuse [3H]mepyramine labeling was visible throughout the DCN, with slightly higher grain density over the molecular, and possibly the pyramidal layers, than over the deep region of the DCN.", 
    "19": "A series of 1-aryl-3,5-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-ones (2a-e) and 1-aryl-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,5-c]quinolines (3-7a-e) bearing different substituents at position 4 were prepared and tested for their ability to displace specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding from bovine brain membranes. The 5-N-methyl derivatives 2a-c,e were the compounds that bound with the highest affinity within this class. The replacement of the carbonyl group with other substituents and the resulting aromatization of the pyridine moiety greatly decreased the binding affinity. From a Lineweaver-Burk analysis on the most active compound 2b, it appears that the inhibition is a competitive one.", 
    "20": "The ontogeny of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor complex in the chick brain was studied by specific binding of [3H]muscimol, [3H]flunitrazepam (Flu) and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to isolated membranes. During development in ovo, the specific binding of muscimol and flunitrazepam increased from day 8 and reached 50% of adult levels of day 20, while a comparable level of TBPS binding was achieved by day 17. The increases in TBPS and Flu binding were reflected in Bmax rather than Kd changes. In embryonic brain, only a low-affinity site for muscimol (Kd = 23 nM) was observed while an additional high-affinity site (Kd = 0.4 nM), as well as the low-affinity site, was found in adult tissue. Similar studies were carried out with cultures of cerebral neurons prepared from 8-day embryos. The level of specific binding of muscimol, Flu and TBPS increased in culture, achieved one half of the maximum level by days 4-5, maximal levels by day 10 and decreased slowly thereafter. The maximal levels in culture corresponded, respectively, to 27%, 67% and 57% of these found in the 18-day embryo. The binding of Flu to membranes from neurons, embryos and adults was enhanced by addition of GABA while TBPS binding was inhibited. The EC50 and IC50 values for these effects corresponded to those for gating of chloride channels. These findings indicate a coordinated expression of receptors for GABA, benzodiazepines and convulsant/TBPS during neuronal maturation both in vivo and in vitro. The schedule for this postsynaptic ontogeny is very similar to that for presynaptic markers of GABAergic neurons (see companion paper).", 
    "21": "The effect of physostigmine on the loss of consciousness and respiratory depression induced in rabbits by flunitrazepam, 1 mg/kg, was studied to demonstrate whether the restoration of consciousness and respiration rate results from an increase in central cholinergic activity or from an interference by physostigmine with specific binding of flunitrazepam to its receptors. Physostigmine, 0.1-0.4 mg/kg iv, caused a dose-related reversal of consciousness and respiration rate within 15 min of its injection, which lasted 15-30 min depending on the dose. This was associated with peak inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in the frontal cortex and medulla, at 15 min, ranging from 35-51%. The analeptic effect of physostigmine in flunitrazepam-treated rabbits was prevented by pretreatment with scopolamine, 1 mg/kg. The effective dose range for physostigmine, 3-12 mumol/kg, is close to concentrations of this agent that inhibit activity in solubilized preparations of AChE from rabbit cortex, 1-3 X 10(-8) M. However, physostigmine, 10(-9) -10(-4) M, failed to displace 3H flunitrazepam from specific binding sites on membranes prepared from rabbit cerebral cortex. It is concluded that physostigmine antagonizes the somnolence and respiratory depression induced by benzodiazepines by restoring cholinergic transmission to normal levels. The effective dose range of physostigmine is small, and serious side effects from overdose can occur as a result of excess cholinergic activity at neuromuscular synapses.", 
    "22": "The irritable bowel is one of the most common complaints facing clinicians. Its management is difficult but a strategy is proposed that is useful in most instances. It is well to remember that most people with these symptoms do not complain to a doctor. The reason for the visit to the physician may, therefore, hold a clue as to the best course of management. The physician must first establish his credibility through a careful history, physical examination, and sigmoidoscopy. He needs to identify the precipitating factors such as dysentery, drugs, diet, emotion, or an important life event. In accordance with the patient's needs, the physician should comfort and reassure. Bran appears to be a safe method of treatment and many are satisfied with it. A follow-up visit is important to ensure compliance and comprehension. The biggest risk of the IBS lies in uncertainty, which generates needless anxiety, costly investigation, fruitless drug side effects, and even the hazards of surgery. If the patient is unimproved at the second visit, one must consider diagnostic alternatives while resisting the temptation to order irrevelant investigative procedures. Continued empathy with the patient is important and certain drugs might be considered either for their placebo effect or because of their effect on a specific complaint such as diarrhea. In the patient who continues to be dissatisfied, the physician must offer continued support and reassurance. Certain referral options may be considered but if possible, the physician should retain the initiative.", 
    "23": "Maprotiline, which differs from other typical tricyclic antidepressants for its tetracyclic structure, is a highly selective inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake. Despite its in vitro and in vivo inhibitory activity on NE uptake, 21 repeated daily injections of maprotiline (20 mg/kg i.p.) neither attenuated the norepinephrine-stimulated cAMP accumulation nor reduced the number of beta adrenergic recognition sites in rat frontal cortex. Also, the number of brain serotonin2 recognition sites labeled by [3H]ketanserin remained virtually unchanged in rats receiving 21 daily injections of maprotiline. [3H]Desmethylimipramine and [3H]mianserin specific binding sites were also unmodified by repeated maprotiline injections. However, after 3 weeks of daily administrations, maprotiline elicited a significant decrease in the number of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites and a decrease in the apparent affinity of [3H]beta-carboline ethylester binding to crude synaptic membranes prepared from hippocampal and hypothalamic homogenates. These changes appear to be unrelated to modifications in the concentration of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid present in the membrane preparation, since the addition of 100 microM bicuculline to the incubation mixture decreases [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the same extent in saline- and maprotiline-treated rats. It is suggested that repeated maprotiline injections may elicit an increase in the hypothalamic and hippocampal tissue levels of an endogenous substance(s) which binds to the benzodiazepine/beta-carboline recognition sites.", 
    "24": "Six healthy volunteers were given in an open study 15 mg of midazolam orally, and a couple of weeks later the same treatment preceded by 400 mg of cimetidine orally. We followed midazolam serum concentrations and the following pharmacodynamic parameters for five hours: subjective sedation, Maddox wing readings, critical flicker fusion frequency and peak velocity of saccadic eye movements. A statistically significant change was found in Cmax and total AUC between the two sessions. The pharmacodynamic responses differed also clearly from each other suggesting a significant change in midazolam effect even after a single oral dose of cimetidine.", 
    "25": "The influence of non-opioid (NO) and opioid (O) premedication on ventilation and ventilatory CO2 response was studied in 18 spontaneously breathing children during halothane anaesthesia. Eight patients in Group NO and 10 in Group O were comparable in age, body weight and type of surgery performed. The sedative effect was evaluated and measurements by pneumotachography and in-line capnography were made immediately after induction of sleep, just before the start of surgery, during surgery and after surgery both before and after 3 min of about 2% CO2 inhalation. Immediately after induction the mean value (+/- s.e. mean) of end-tidal CO2 concentration (ETCO2) was 4.86 +/- 0.21% in Group NO and 5.28 +/- 0.22% in Group O. Before and during surgery, minute ventilation (VE) was higher in Group NO (P less than 0.05) mainly due to higher respiratory rates. ETCO2 was similar in the two groups before, during and after surgery. The ratio of VE to CO2 elimination (VCO2) and of dead space (VD) to tidal volume (VT) was higher in Group NO, but ventilatory response to CO2 inhalation immediately before the postoperative period was similar in both groups. It was concluded that opioid premedication resulted in more efficient ventilation during anaesthesia and surgery, and that CO2 response at the end of surgery was maintained in both groups.", 
    "26": "Exposure of young rats (9-10 weeks) to chronic summer heat (36 degrees C) or acute heat (38 degrees C, 4 hr) increased the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to Evans blue albumin complex and [131I]sodium in different regions of the brain, which correlated well with the increased level of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in plasma and brain. This increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier and the increased level of 5-HT were prevented by pretreatment with para-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA), indomethacin and diazepam. Pretreatment with cyproheptadine and vinblastine, however, prevented only the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier; the plasma and level of 5-HT in brain continued to remain high. These results indicate a probable role of 5-HT as one of the factors leading to the increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier in young rats following heat stress.", 
    "27": "The initial level of PL-beta-ED-ir was significantly lowered in a group of 14 patients with gastroduodenal ulcer disease as compared with healthy volunteers (P less than 0.05). Immediately after i.m. administration of 20 mg gastrozepin (G) the PL-beta-ED-ir level increased but not significantly. Given orally over two weeks, G (50 mg/day) led to a more than doubling of the initial level (P less than 0.05). Controls showed no significant changes. A further meaningful change represented the time relationship of PL-beta-ED-ir during 5-hour observation to i.m. administration of 20 mg G before the start and after the end of the 2-week oral therapy. The placebo character of the above findings rules out the absence of any deviations of PL-beta-ED-ir in the diseased and healthy group after i.m. injection of saline. The study deals with the findings in relation to the pathophysiology of ulcer disease, and with a potential interference of G in the interrelation of the cholinergic and endogenous opiate systems.", 
    "28": "Two hundred patients requiring sedation for minor oral surgery were randomly allocated to receive either midazolam or diazepam as Diazemuls intravenously through a 23-gauge indwelling needle in the dorsum of the hand. The site of injection was inspected at 7 days and 14 days post injection and assessed for pain, tenderness, redness, induration, painless thrombosis, and thrombophlebitis. The mean dose administered was 0.119 mg/kg of midazolam and 0.298 mg/kg of Diazemuls. At 7 days there was no significant difference in venous complications. At the 14 day follow up, the midazolam group had a significantly greater incidence of tenderness and redness (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05 respectively using Chi squared test). The incidence of thrombophlebitis in the midazolam group was 2% at 7 days and 1% at 14 days, the corresponding figures in those given Diazemuls being none and 1% respectively. We conclude that the dorsum of the hand is a satisfactory site of injection for administration of these drugs. The higher incidence of minor complications at 14 days following midazolam was offset by its more reliable amnesic properties.", 
    "29": "Midazolam kinetics and psychomotor function were studied after an intravenous dose of 0.075 mg/kg body weight in seven patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and eight control patients. Four of the seven cirrhotics died of complications of their liver disease within six months of the study. The metabolism of midazolam was significantly impaired in the cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.025). These patients also had evidence of greater sedation than the control group for up to six hours after the dose was administered (p less than 0.05). The clearance of midazolam did not correlate significantly with the serum albumin, or bilirubin, or with the kinetics of antipyrine, or indocyanine green. This study shows significant delay in the elimination of midazolam and decreased psychomotor function in patients with severe alcoholic liver disease. Caution is needed in using this drug for premedication in such patients before endoscopy.", 
    "30": "The effects of midazolam on coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF), myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and myocardial lactate balance were investigated in eight patients with stable coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization. Coronary sinus blood flow was measured by continuous thermodilution. Arterial and coronary sinus blood were analyzed for oxygen and lactate content. The determinants of left ventricular (LV) performance were obtained from the cardiac output measured by thermodilution and from left heart catheterization data. All data were obtained before, and 5 and 15 min after midazolam, 0.2 mg X kg-1 iv. Sleep was induced in all patients after administration of midazolam and persisted throughout the entire study period. Mean aortic and LV end-diastolic pressure were decreased from control values (-15 and -44%, respectively), as well as cardiac index and stroke index (-10 and -15%, respectively). Heart rate increased moderately (+8%), while no change in systemic vascular resistance and maximum velocity of shortening (Vmax) were observed. Midazolam administration was followed by a decrease of CSBF (-24%) and of MVO2 (-26%). Coronary vascular resistance did not change, but coronary sinus oxygen tension increased slightly, suggesting a mild alteration in normal autoregulation. However, no evidence of myocardial ischemia occurred, as judged by the absence of changes in the: 1) ECG, 2) myocardial lactate extraction, and 3) relaxation time constant. These results suggest that midazolam may be used safely in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "31": "Eight healthy volunteers received a single 5-mg intravenous dose of the imidazobenzodiazepine derivative midazolam on three occasions in random sequence: a, control, with no other treatment; b, during coadministration of cimetidine, 300 mg every 6 hr; c, during coadministration of ranitidine, 150 mg every 12 hr. Midazolam kinetics in each trial were determined from multiple plasma midazolam levels measured by gas chromatography for 24 hr after each dose. High pressure liquid chromatography analysis of plasma also verified compliance with cimetidine (mean level, 0.61 microgram/ml) and ranitidine (mean level, 0.36 microgram/ml) regimens. Analysis of variance indicated no significant differences in mean values for trials a, b, and c in midazolam elimination half-life (2.25 vs 2.02 vs 2.05 hr), volume of distribution (2.13 vs 2.14 vs 2.16 L/kg) or total clearance (10.8 vs 12.2 vs 12.3 ml . min-1 . kg-1). In a second study, six subjects received a 15-mg oral dose of midazolam on three occasions identical to those described above. Again, there were no significant differences among trials a, b, and c in midazolam peak plasma level (90 vs 95 vs 117 ng/ml), time of peak level (0.65 vs 1.45 vs 0.90 hr after dose), elimination half-life (3.04 vs 3.38 vs 3.30 hr), or apparent oral clearance (16.2 vs 14.3 vs 13.8 ml . min-1 . kg-1). Thus the usual therapeutic doses of cimetidine or ranitidine do not significantly alter the kinetics of intravenous or oral midazolam in healthy individuals.", 
    "32": "The effects of induction of anesthesia with diazepam and midazolam on baroreflex control of heart rate and on plasma levels of catecholamines were investigated in this study. Group 1 subjects (n = 10) received diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg. Group 2 subjects (n = 10) received midazolam, 0.3 mg/kg. Baroreflex function was assessed using a pressor test (phenylephrine). In addition, samples for subsequent determination of plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine levels and plasma diazepam or midazolam concentrations were collected before and 5, 10, and 15 min after intravenous drug administration. The pressor baroreflex slope declined significantly after diazepam or midazolam administration with the maximal changes (-45 and -43%, respectively) observed when plasma diazepam or midazolam concentrations were the highest. Norepinephrine plasma concentrations decreased at each measurement with both drugs. In contrast, epinephrine concentration decreased only after midazolam. The authors conclude that diazepam or midazolam used for induction of anesthesia results in a transient depression of baroreflex function and a sustained decrease of sympathetic tone. This study also indicates that the depression of arterial baroreflex heart rate responses under diazepam or midazolam anesthesia are less pronounced than the depression of baroreflex responses reported by other investigators with potent inhalational anesthetics. However, this disruptive effect of diazepam and midazolam on sympathetic control of circulation might induce a limited ability to compensate for hemodynamic alterations related to hypovolemia.", 
    "33": "Anxiolytic therapy with benzodiazepines and their potential for dependence are reviewed. Relaxation training and biofeedback have been used for chemically dependent anxious patients. These techniques have been recommended for benzodiazepine-dependent patients, but not investigated. Previous withdrawal studies offer only limited follow-up data. Stress management treatment was based on a successful case study. Recruitment difficulties were encountered. However, seven patients were randomly assigned to stress management or brief psycho-therapy. All showed improvement, but three of four patients available for 1 year follow-up had returned to pretreatment dependence. These withdrawal difficulties suggest the need for more effective treatments and more adequate follow-up studies.",

    "35": "Pretreatment with small doses of fentanyl (100 micrograms) or alfentanil (300 micrograms) was found significantly to reduce the induction dose of thiopentone. Fentanyl 50 micrograms and alfentanil 150 micrograms also significantly reduced the onset time and increased the consistency of action of midazolam. Respiratory depression was not a problem when 50 micrograms fentanyl or 150 micrograms alfentanil were used.", 
    "36": "Monographs prepared by a drug information pharmacist at a government hospital in Northern Ireland were evaluated by hospital and community physicians. The monographs related drug information to both the primary medical problem (e.g., angina) and secondary problems of individual patients (e.g., renal or hepatic dysfunction). The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of various agents in a drug group were compared. The initial monograph about beta blockers was evaluated by 13 pharmacists in government hospitals. The monograph was then revised and two additional monographs were written on the use of benzodiazepines in anxiety and insomnia and the use of organic nitrates in cardiovascular disease. The three monographs were distributed to 122 hospital physicians and 67 community physicians for evaluation of the information and the manner in which it was presented. Questionnaires were returned by 46% of the hospital physicians and 39% of the community physicians. Almost 50% of the responding prescribers said the monographs gave them new information. The lack of cost information in the monographs was cited as a problem by 25% of respondents. The most frequently suggested topics for additional monographs were antibiotics, analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, bronchodilators, and antidepressants. Physicians considered the monographs a useful source of education about selection of appropriate drug therapy.", 
    "37": "The effectiveness of alprazolam in treating symptoms of anxiety and depression in 60 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery was assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The results indicate that alprazolam treatment for anxiety following coronary bypass surgery, particularly symptoms occurring in the immediate postoperative period, can significantly affect patient outcome. Specifically, only modest but statistically significant improvement was observed in the alprazolam-treated groups at 1-month follow-up; however, alprazolam-treated patients were significantly more likely to experience a very rapid anxiolytic effect by postoperative day 8. The implications of this study are discussed with respect to patient management and models for future studies of anxiety in postoperative patient populations.", 
    "38": "An open clinical trial of alprazolam therapy of patients with panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks was undertaken to clarify certain issues not resolved by previous studies. These included the proportion of patients who significantly improve with alprazolam; the relative time courses for improvement in panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and phobic avoidance; whether successful alprazolam treatment alters vulnerability to panic with sodium lactate infusion; and what factors predict response to alprazolam in panic patients. Thirty patients meeting DSM-III criteria for panic disorder or agoraphobia with panic attacks completed a 12-week open clinical trial, and 22 were considered responders. In responders, panic attacks showed rapid improvement, whereas improvement of anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance was more variable. Successful alprazolam therapy appeared to block lactate vulnerability. High pretreatment Hamilton Anxiety Scale scores were associated with poor treatment response. The data suggest that alprazolam is an effective treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia with panic attacks, and acts by directly blocking panic attacks.", 
    "39": "Anxiolytic activity of DSIP, sodium hydroxybutyrate, nicotinoyl-GABA, mebicar, some derivatives of aminoandrostane and beta-carboline was not, like in the case of diazepam and beta C-3CEE, related to benzodiazepine receptors. The degree of the decrease in anxiolytic activity of these compounds did not correspond to increasing Ki binding of 3H diazepam in alcoholic rats.", 
    "40": "Administration of a subparalyzing dose of a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant (priming dose) prior to its intubating dose hastens the onset time (time from muscle relaxant administration to 100% depression of twitch tension) of neuromuscular blockade. This study was undertaken to determine the optimal priming and intubating doses and time interval between these doses (priming interval) of vecuronium during rapid-sequence induction of anesthesia. The authors measured single-twitch tension in 79 healthy, awake, premedicated (fentanyl, 50-150 mu iv, and/or diazepam, 5-10 mg iv) patients. In Part A of the study, the priming dose was varied (0.0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.0015, or 0.02 mg/kg iv). Decrement of twitch tension and symptoms were recorded 3 min later. Four minutes after the priming dose, thiopental, 4-6 mg/kg iv, and vecuronium, 0.1 mg/kg iv, were given. Onset times for the 0.01, 0.015, and 0.02 mg/kg groups were significantly shorter than for 0.005 and 0.0 mg/kg groups. No breathing difficulties were encountered in any of the groups. Decrement of twitch tension greater than 25% of control only occurred in the 0.02 mg/kg group (4 of 11 patients). In Part B, the priming interval was varied (2, 4, or 6 min) after giving the optimal priming dose (0.01 mg/kg). Anesthesia was induced as in Part A. Onset times for the 4-min group were significantly faster than the 2- or 6-min groups. In Part C, the intubating dose was varied (0.07, 0.1, or 0.15 mg/kg iv) after the optimal priming dose and optimal priming interval (4 min). Onset times for the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.15 mg/kg groups were significantly faster than the 0.07 mg/kg group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "41": "Alprazolam treatment is effective for panic disorder, but its major disadvantages include possible dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation.

    "42": "We used in vitro receptor autoradiography to study four cases of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) and three age- and postmortem delay-matched controls. In OPCA, benzodiazepine receptors were unchanged in cerebellar cortex but increased in the dentate nucleus, perhaps related to loss of Purkinje cell or brainstem afferents. Muscimol binding was reduced primarily in the granule cell layer. The density of muscarinic cholinergic receptors was reduced in molecular and granule cell layers, but appeared increased in the dentate.", 
    "43": "The effects of zopiclone (0.1-100 mg/kg) were studied alone and in combination with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 and the inverse agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE). Under one procedure, food-maintained responding of squirrel monkeys was punished during one component of a multiple schedule. Each 30th response during both components produced food and, during the punishment component, also produced electric shock. Intermediate doses of zopiclone (0.3-30 mg/kg) did not affect or decreased unpunished responding and produced large increases in punished responding; higher zopiclone doses decreased responding under both conditions. beta-CCE (0.1-3 mg/kg) reversed both the rate-increasing and the rate-decreasing effects of zopiclone under each condition, producing a dose-dependent shift to the right of the zopiclone dose-effect curves. All doses of beta-CCE higher than 0.1 mg/kg decreased responding when given alone. Ro 15-1788 (0.1 or 1 mg/kg), which had no effect on punished or unpunished responding, reversed both the rate-increasing and the rate-decreasing effects of zopiclone. Under a second procedure, zopiclone increased responding of squirrel monkeys maintained by food under a 5-min fixed-interval schedule at doses that did not affect or decreased responding comparably maintained in an alternate component by response-produced electric shock. These effects were also reversed by both Ro 15-1788 and beta-CCE. When administered alone, beta-CCE produced effects opposite those of zopiclone and the benzodiazepines by decreasing responding maintained by food and increasing shock-maintained responding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "We describe a quantitative screen for hypnotic-sedative drugs in which we use capillary gas chromatography with a nitrogen-phosphorus detector (GC/NPD) as the primary method and capillary gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for confirmation. GC retention times of the acid-extracted underivatized drugs were stable (CVs less than 1%), and the detector response varied linearly over a 20-fold concentration range with a mean correlation coefficient for 11 drugs of 0.989. The limits of detection were satisfactory (0.5 mg/L in a 0.5-mL serum sample and 1-microL injection volume), as were precision (average CV 5.2% within day, 6.4% between day). The complementary use of capillary GC-MS not only unambiguously confirms presumptive peaks identified by GC, but also prevents reports of false positives and identifies compounds not included in the quantitative GC screen that may be listed in the GC-MS library.",

    "46": "Effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDZ), flurazepam (FLU) and diazepam (DZP) were assessed in mice by observation of digging behavior in an escape task. Reliable effects on escape latencies and number of exploratory head pokes were detected at 2 mg/kg for CDZ and FLU. DZP produced dose-dependent effects at 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg/kg. Ro 15-1788 antagonized the effects of DZP (0.6 mg/kg). Ethanol (0.75 and 1.5 g/kg) produced effects similar to those of the benzodiazepines. The dynamics of this naturalistic behavior avoid the need for direct aversive stimulation or food/water deprivation to set up an approach-avoidance or conflict test. Combined with a multivariate (discriminant) analysis, the approach provides a sensitive assessment of anxiolytic drug activity.", 
    "47": "The triazolobenzodiazepine triazolam (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.p.) and quazepam (0.3-30.0 mg/kg i.p.) were administered to non-food-deprived rats which had been partially-satiated on a palatable diet. In a subsequent 30 min feeding test, both compounds produced a significant increase in the level of food consumption. While triazolam had a dose-related effect and produced a 151.5% increase in the level of food intake, quazepam exerted only a partial effect, achieving a 73.9% increase in food intake at 3.0 mg/kg but no additional increase in food intake at higher doses. The two beta-carbolines, ZK 93423 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg i.p.) and ZK 91296 (1.0-30.0 mg/kg i.p.), a full agonist and a partial agonist at benzodiazepine receptors respectively, also produced significant increases in food consumption under the same experimental conditions. ZK 93423 had effects which were similar to those of triazolam, ZK 91296 had effects similar to quazepam. The beta-carboline benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 (10.0 mg/kg i.p.) had an anorectic effect in non-food-deprived rats given 30 min access to the highly palatable diet. This effect was reversed by the beta-carboline benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93426 in a dose-dependent manner. These results emphasize that within the series of beta-carboline ligands for benzodiazepine receptors, their characterization in terms of agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists has validity with respect to the behavioural response of palatable food consumption in non-food-deprived rats.", 
    "48": "In astrocytes, carbachol evoked the turnover of membrane inositol phospholipids prelabelled with [3H]inositol, as revealed by [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation in the presence of 5 mM lithium. This effect was blocked by atropine and by pirenzepine (IC50 2.2 nM and 56 nM, respectively). Carbachol partially attenuated the isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate production in astrocytes by a direct effect on adenylate cyclase, an effect blocked by atropine and pirenzepine. These results suggest that astrocytes express muscarinic receptor subtypes.", 
    "49": "The abuse of flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), a potent benzodiazepine-type hypnotic, cannot be established with the widely used immunoassays for urine analysis owing to lack of specificity.

    "50": "The effects of diazepam on the crossed extensor reflex (CER) were compared between intact and spinally transected rats and also between IVth and lateral ventricular administration. The CER of the chronic spinal rat was not influenced by 0.05-2 mg/kg doses of diazepam, which was 5-200 times larger than the ED50 of the intact preparation. The IVth ventricular injection required only half as much diazepam compared to the lateral ventricular injection and the elapsed time between drug administration to the peak effect was significantly shorter. According to these findings, benzodiazepines seem to act primarily on the supraspinal structure near the IVth ventricle and thus depress the CER.", 
    "51": "Stereoselective binding of oxazepam, lorazepam, temazepam and methyl lorazepam as well as of their acetates to human serum albumin was investigated by different techniques. The 2'-chlorine and the N(1)-methyl substitution exert opposite effects on the antipodes. Enantiomers of oxazepam acetate (OAc) and lorazepam acetate (LAc) displace diazepam. Allosteric interactions with warfarin were manifested by either mutually increased or decreased binding depending on the structure of benzodiazepine and on the configuration of both benzodiazepine and warfarin. The most remarkable effect could be observed in the simultaneous binding of (S)-lorazepam acetate and (S)-warfarin.", 
    "52": "Peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites were characterized in human term placental membranes using [3H]PK 11195, which is a ligand specific for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites. Binding of [3H]PK 11195 to human term placental membranes was found to be saturable. Scatchard analysis revealed a single population of binding sites (r = 0.98). Equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was 2.1 +/- 0.3 nM, and density of binding sites (Bmax) was 920 +/- 105 fmol/mg protein. The KD value calculated from kinetic experiments was 3.6 +/- 0.2 nM. The ability of various drugs to displace [3H]PK 11195 from human term placental binding sites was tested: the inhibition constants (KI) for PK 11195, Ro 5-4864, and diazepam were 2.9, 11.8, and 177 nM, respectively, whereas clonazepam, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, Ro 15-1788, chlordiazepoxide, atropine, and estradiol were inefficient in displacing [3H]PK 11195 (KI greater than 10(-5) M).", 
    "53": "We have investigated the subcellular localization of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor in rat adrenal gland using the high affinity ligand 3H-labeled 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([3H]PK11195). The autoradiographic pattern of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in tissue sections of adrenal gland is similar to the histochemical distribution of the mitochondrial marker enzymes, cytochrome oxidase and monoamine oxidase, which are present in high concentrations only in the cortex. Subcellular fractionation studies of homogenates of adrenal gland indicate that the recovery and enrichment of [3H]PK11195 binding sites in the nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble fractions correlate closely with cytochrome oxidase activity, but not with markers for the nuclei, lysosomes, peroxysomes, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, or cytoplasm, indicating an association of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor with the mitochondrial compartment. Titration of isolated mitochondria with digitonin results in the simultaneous release of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and of monoamine oxidase, but not cytochrome oxidase, indicating association of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor with the mitochondrial outer membrane. Scatchard analysis and drug displacement studies of the binding of [3H] PK11195 to intact mitochondria and to the outer membrane-enriched digitonin extract further confirm the localization of the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor to the mitochondrial outer membrane.", 
    "54": "The effects of ZK 91296, a beta-carboline derivative that potently displaces [3H]benzodiazepines from their CNS binding sites, were examined in two extensively validated animal tests of anxiety and in the holeboard in rats. In the social interaction test of anxiety. ZK 91296 (5 mg/kg) had an anxiolytic effect that was no longer apparent at a higher dose (15 mg/kg). In a test using exploratory activity on an elevated plus-maze as a measure of anxiety, the effects of ZK 91296 (5-15 mg/kg) did not reach significance. In the holeboard. ZK 91296 did not significantly reduce exploratory head-dipping, locomotor activity or rearing until doses of 40 mg/kg. These data suggest that ZK 91296 can reduce anxiety as assessed by animal tests at doses at which it does not induce sedation.", 
    "55": "Five patients are reported who experienced amnestic episodes a short time after oral intake of the recommended dose (7.5-15 mg) of the new benzodiazepine hypnotic midazolam. Patients were able to perform complex activities or to talk freely with other persons, and seemed to be awake and attentive. However, next morning they had complete andero-grade amnesia from intake of the drug. No other psychotropic medication or alcohol was involved. This type of drug-induced amnesia seems to be more frequent than so far reported, since all these episodes were observed in fewer than 30 cases in which the drug was prescribed. This means a considerable risk for patients and for others, and serious questions arise which should be carefully investigated.", 
    "56": "The peripheral control of appetite is effected by two digestive hormones produced by the stomach and intestine. Bombesin, induced by gastric distension, might act as a messenger informing the nervous centres that the subject is satiated. The pharmacological satiating effect of cholecystokinin, probably mediated by the afferent fibres of the vagus nerve, is well established, but its physiological effect has not yet been demonstrated. Centrally, appetite is controlled by neurotransmitters, satiating and orexigenic properties being shared between monoamines, benzodiazepine-receptors and GABA-receptors. Among digestive hormones present in the central nervous system, the most satiating in pharmacological doses seem to be cholecystokinin and calcitonin, but their physiological role remains obscure. Insulin might be the signal informing the hypothalamus on body fat mass. Endorphins exert an orexigenic effect, reversed by naloxone, which is particularly marked in case of stress, in obese subjects and in the presence of highly palatable food. The control of appetite therefore is complex. It cannot be separated from other functions, such as pain and pleasure, which are regulated by intracerebral peptides.", 
    "57": "The analgesic effects of a repetitive stress induced by anticipation of pain (noxious footshock) were studied on both the threshold of a nociceptive flexion reflex and the corresponding pain sensation after a 4-day-treatment of diazepam vs placebo (cross-over and double-blind study) in normal volunteers. During diazepam, the stressor stimulus produced a weaker depression on both nociceptive reflex and pain sensation than that observed during placebo. Furthermore, the reversal effect by naloxone was much more marked during placebo than during diazepam. These data clearly suggest a possible moderating action of benzodiazepine brain type receptors upon the endogenous opiate systems involved in the phenomenon of stress-induced analgesia in humans.", 
    "58": "The distribution and characteristics of M1 and M2 muscarinic cholinergic receptors as defined by their affinity for the antagonist pirenzepine were studied in the human brain using in vitro quantitative autoradiographic techniques. The binding of N-[3H]methylscopolamine ([3H]NMS) to cortical and striatal microtome tissue sections was saturable and presented a Kd of 0.25 nM. The sensitivity of [3H]NMS-binding sites to 100 microM carbachol and 300 nM pirenzepine was analyzed in 30 brain areas. In selected brain regions, complete competition curves using carbachol, pirenzepine and atropine were analyzed. Finally, the regional distribution of M1 sites was studied using [3H]pirenzepine ([3H]PZ) as ligand. The binding of [3H]NMS to striatum, hippocampus and amygdala was very sensitive to pirenzepine but not to carbachol. The opposite situation was found in thalamus, hypothalamus, substantia innominata, pons and medulla, while intermediate sensitivity to both displacers was observed in different layers of the cortex and in the claustrum. Competition experiments showed that [3H]NMS binding was displaced with the same affinity by atropine in all the regions studied, while the IC50 of carbachol varied from 5 microM in the nucleus facialis to 830 microM in the caudate. Pirenzepine IC50 values for [3H]NMS sites varied from 66 nM to 1 microM. Results using [3H]PZ further confirm this pattern of distribution, with high densities of binding observed in the striatum, hippocampus and amygdala and very low in thalamic and brainstem areas. These results show that the putative M1 and M2 muscarinic receptor subtypes present a differential anatomical distribution in the human brain. This differential distribution is comparable to that observed in the rat brain. Some basal ganglia and limbic areas are enriched in M1 sites, while thalamus, brainstem, medulla and also the hypothalamus and substantia innominata contain predominantly receptors of the M2 type. The cerebral cortex is an example of a region containing a mixed population of M1 and M2 sites. These results provide an anatomical description of the distribution of subtypes of the muscarinic receptor in the human brain, which can be related to the known pharmacological effects of muscarinic agents in brain function.", 
    "59": "To investigate the mechanisms of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine-induced growth hormone (GH) release, we studied the effects of GABA and a water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam, on basal immunoreactive somatostatin secretion from fetal rat brain in dispersed cell culture. Both GABA and midazolam in concentrations of 10(-5) or 10(-6) M inhibited basal somatostatin secretion from either diencephalic or cerebral neurons in culture. Midazolam (10(-5) M) produced a 33.2 +/- 8.6% suppression (P = 0.004) and 10(-5) M GABA produced a 46.0 +/- 4.3% suppression (P = 0.0003) in the diencephalon cultures. When GABA and midazolam were used in combination over the 10(-5)-10(-9) M range, the drugs were shown to act independently (positive main effect, P less than 0.0001 for either drug by two-way analysis of variance); there was a simple additive effect with no statistically significant interaction between the two drugs over the 36 combinations tested. These results suggest that suppression of the GH inhibitory peptide, somatostatin, may be one of the mechanisms by which GABA and benzodiazepines stimulate GH secretion. Based on previous studies of GABA and benzodiazepine receptors, it appears likely that these drugs produce this inhibitory effect by interacting with unassociated lower affinity receptors which require micromolar concentrations of the drugs, and act through calcium-dependent pathways.", 
    "60": "Acetylcholine (ACh) is considered to act as a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain by binding to membrane receptors and bringing about a change in neurone excitability. In the case of muscarinic receptors, cell excitability is usually increased; this effect results from a closure of membrane potassium channels in cortical cells. However, some central neurones are inhibited by ACh, and we hypothesized that these two opposite effects of ACh resulted from interactions with different subtypes of muscarinic receptor. We made intracellular recordings from neurones in the rat nucleus parabrachialis, a group of neurones in the upper pons some of which themselves synthesize ACh. ACh and muscarine caused a membrane hyperpolarization which resulted from an increase in the membrane conductance to potassium ions. The muscarinic receptor subtype was characterized by determining the dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) for pirenzepine during the intracellular recording; the value of approximately 600 nM indicates a receptor in the M2 class. This muscarinic receptor is quite different from that which brings about a decrease in potassium conductance in other neurones, which has a pirenzepine KD of approximately 10 nM (M1 receptors). It is possible that antagonists selective for this kind of M2 receptor would be useful in the management of conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, which are associated with a reduced effectiveness of cholinergic neurones.", 
    "61": "Benzodiazepine receptors have been studied on primary neuronal culture of foetal rat brain using different labelled ligands. The agonists [(3)H]flunitrazepam and [(3)H]diazepam, the inverse agonist [(3)H]methyl-?-carboline-3-carboxylate and the antagonist [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 were used. The binding properties of these ligands to homogenate from cultured neurons are very similar to those determined on receptors mediating the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines in the brain. The [(3)H]ligands behaved differently when the binding was performed with intact cells. Among them, [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 offers two advantages making it fitted for binding to intact cells: it shows a low non-specific binding and a specificity for \"central type\" of benzodiazepine receptors. On the contrary, [(3)H]diazepam is useless because of its high non-specific binding. In cultured neurons the benzodiazepine receptors are coupled to GABA receptors: this is shown by the enhancement of [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding by GABA and its reduction by bicuculline.", 
    "62": "The CNS of the cockroach Periplaneta americana contains saturable, specific binding sites for [(3)H]GABA, [(3)H]flunitrazepam and [(35)S]TBPS. The [(3)H]GABA binding site exhibits a pharmacological profile distinct from that reported for mammalian GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors. The most potent inhibitors of [(3)H]GABA binding were GABA and muscimol, whereas isoguvacine, thiomuscimol and 3-aminopropane sulphonic acid were less effective. Bicuculline methiodide and baclofen were ineffective. Binding of [(35)S]TBPS was partially inhibited by 1.0 x 10(?6) M GABA, whilst binding of [(3)H]flunitrazepam was enhanced by 1.0 x 10(?7) M GABA. The pharmacological profile of the [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding site showed some similarities with the peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites of vertebrates, with Ro-5-4864 being a far more effective inhibitor of binding than clonazepam. Thus a class of GABA receptors with pharmacological properties distinct from mammalian GABA receptor subtypes is present in insect CNS.", 
    "63": "The central actions of 1-(2-o-chlorobenzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)-5-glycylaminomethyl-3-dimethylcarbamoyl-1H-1,2,4-triazole hydrochloride dihydrate (450191-S), a potent sleep-inducing and anxiolytic drug, were re-evaluated in terms of the affinity for benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor and the activation of ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor binding. The 450191-S showed only very low capacity to displace the bindings of [(3)H]diazepam, [(3)H]?-carboline-3-carboxylate-ethylester, [(3)H]Rol5-1788, [(3)H]Ro5-4864 and [(3)H]naloxone to cerebral synaptic membranes. Similarly, this drug had a weak and undistinguishable affinity to both BZPtype 1 and 2 receptors determined under the presence of CL 218,872. On the other hand, 450191-S as well as its active metabolites (M-1, M-2, M-A, M-3 and M-4) showed a remarkable activating effect on the GABA receptor binding with low affinity in cerebral synaptic membranes. This enhancement of the low affinity GABA receptor binding was found to be due to the increase of affinity (K(d)) but not to the change in B(max). Furthermore, it has been found that the observed accentuation of low affinity GABA receptor binding is well-correlated with the potency of the central actions of 450191-S such as potentiation of the hypnotic action of barbiturates and muscle relaxation. These results suggest that the central actions of 450191-S may be due to, at least in part, the activation of central GABA receptor binding with low affinity. The present results also suggest that the activation of low affinity GABA receptor binding may be a better criterion than the affinity of BZP receptor for elucidating the central action of a certain type of BZP derivatives.", 
    "64": "In order to examine whether species differences of benzodiazepine receptor subunits exist, we compared the fluorographic pattern of photoaffinity labelled subunits after SDS-PAGE in five species: fish, frog, chicken, mouse and calf. Each species showed a distinct pattern of specifically labelled proteins. We conclude that species variation of benzodiazepine receptor does indeed exist.", 
    "65": "Significant advances in understanding the actions of hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs resulted from the development of new analytical procedures. Among these advances the discovery that, for a given drug (or hormone or neurotransmitter), there exists a receptor site on membranes to which the substance must attach in order to evoke a biological response, led to the setting up of the radioreceptor assays. Thus ligand-binding techniques can be used as assays for measuring drug levels in biological tissues and fluids. Radioreceptor assays are based on the principle of competitive protein-binding methods; when a radioligand and an unlabelled ligand are present together with a specific receptor preparation, the amount of radioactive ligand bound to the receptor is a quantitative function of the amount of unlabelled ligand present in the incubation medium. The technology of the radioreceptor assays is simple and rapid to perform when optimal conditions for binding are determined. Radioreceptor assays are highly sensitive, reliable, precise and accurate. Their chief limitation relates to specificity as any substance having an appreciable affinity for the receptor displaces the specifically bound radioligand. Paradoxically this lack of specificity may be in some cases advantageous in that it allows for the detection of the parent compound and active metabolites in proportion to their affinity for the specific receptor. During recent years, radioreceptor assays have been applied to quantitative determination of hormones, neurotransmitters and drugs. Among these, the radioreceptor assay of benzodiazepines is a typical example. In addition to drug analysis and drug monitoring, radioreceptor assays have been found to be versatile tools for basic studies on the receptor itself, on the endogenous ligand(s) for the receptor and on the discovery and the identification of biologically active chemical entities (pharmacological screening). The future of radioreceptor assays in the pharmacological sciences appears to be promising.", 
    "66": "The importance of anaesthesia as an element of risk at colonoscopy has been examined retrospectively over a 10-year period from 1975 to 1984. The colonoscopic examinations were made by surgical gastroenterologists and anaesthesiologists working in cooperation. In 1242 cases the patients received diazepam/fentanyl anaesthesia during the colonoscopy (Group I) and in 126 cases they received general anaesthesia (Group II). The incidence of perforations of the large bowel in Group I was 0.8% (95% confidence limits: 0.4-1.5%) and in Group II 0.0% (95% confidence limits: 0.0-2.9%). Statistically the difference is not significant (P = 0.38). The groups were comparable with a view to the patients' age, weight, the duration of the colonoscopy and the number of times that polypectomy had been performed. All anaesthesia was administered by staff qualified by training and experience to administer anaesthesia, and did not cause any complications. However, four patients had vasovagal reflexes due to manipulation of the colonoscope. The dosing in the patients in Group I averaged: diazepam as premedication 9.2 mg, intravenous diazepam 12.4 mg, intravenous fentanyl 0.14 mg, and the duration of the colonoscopy was 36.5 min. The medication and the duration of the colonoscopy did not vary significantly in the patients with perforation of the large bowel. Our conclusion is that diazepam/fentanyl anaesthesia, administered by experienced staff, is harmless, and that general anaesthesia for colonoscopy did not involve an increased risk of perforation of the large bowel.", 
    "67": "Inquiries were sent to practising Austrian anesthesiologists to ascertain their premedication-prescribing habits and their assessment of premedicants that they received as patients. The 143 replies received showed meperidine/promethazine (M/P) as most used n = 83 and received (n = 54) drug (combination), followed by fentanyl/droperidol (F/D) n = 33 (n = 21), benzodiazepines (BZ) n = 17 (n = 10) and several other drugs (combinations) n = 10 (n = 14). There was no significant difference in the premedication habits of the 82 anesthesiologists who had received premedication and those (61) who had no personal experience with premedicants. The former judged M/P to be significantly superior to F/D and other schemes; however there was no significant difference from the judgement of the BZ. Unpleasant side effects have been described in 9% of M/P, 10% of BZ, 24% of F/D and 21% of other premedicants. On future occasions 10% of BZ-, 13% of the M/P-, 24% F/D- and 21%-receivers of other combinations would reject the same drug. Seven F/D and five M/P users converted their prescription schemes after they had received the same drug for their own premedication. The prescription habits were not influenced by dependency on departmental or hospital orders. Of those who had received it 75% desired premedication and 25% accepted premedication, suggesting that anesthesiologists believe in the positive effects of premedication. However, the overall incidence of 10% unpleasant side effects, even in the better ranked drugs, shows that the available premedicants do not yet seem to be satisfactory.", 
    "68": "The effect of total drug concentration on the free fraction was studied in vitro using sera of uremic and nonuremic subjects. Both therapeutic and toxic concentrations of radiolabeled phenytoin, diazepam, and propranolol were used. The free fraction was separated by a pressure ultrafiltration method at 37 degrees C and determined from 200-microliters aliquots of serum and the ultrafiltrate. Sera from 11 acutely uremic and 10 chronically uremic patients and from 10 healthy control subjects were used. Only slight increases in the free fraction were found over the concentration range studied in both nonuremic and uremic subjects. The concentration-dependent increases in the unbound fraction of phenytoin and diazepam were quite negligible compared with the two- to threefold increases caused by uremia itself. Thus, variation in total concentrations of phenytoin, diazepam, and propranolol does not change the free fractions to a clinically significant degree even in uremic patients with a compromised binding capacity.", 
    "69": "A familial syndrome of painful nocturnal cramping and jerking in members of three generations is described. All-night polysomnograms demonstrated both myoclonic jerks and sustained muscular activity in three family members, a 4-year-old girl, who presented with frequent episodes of painful awakenings; her 7-year-old brother, who had similar but less severe symptoms; and the 28-year-old mother, who had suffered nocturnal cramping and awakenings for much of her life. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a familial disorder characterized by exclusively nocturnal intermittent cramping and myoclonus of brainstem or spinal origin.", 
    "70": "The in vitro effects of acetaldehyde treatment on the binding of phenytoin and diazepam to human serum albumin (HSA) and human serum proteins (HSP) have been investigated. The incorporation of acetaldehyde into proteins following incubation with different concentrations of [1,2-14 C]-acetaldehyde (0.5, 25, 100 mmol/l) was carried out. The proteins were then dialyzed so that only the stable adduct was retained. Binding of phenytoin and diazepam was then studied. Scatchard plot analysis showed a slight decrease (p less than 0.01 for HSP and 25 mmol/l acetaldehyde) in the number of binding sites for phenytoin when the acetaldehyde/protein ratio was increased. The affinity constant was also increased (p less than 0.01) with 100 mmol/l acetaldehyde. No change could be demonstrated in the number of diazepam binding sites on HSA; an increase in the binding capacity of HSP was shown following incubation with 25 mmol/l acetaldehyde. The fraction of drug bound at therapeutic levels has been also calculated for both drugs. An increase for diazepam but no change for phenytoin can be observed before or after treatment of proteins with acetaldehyde.", 
    "71": "Lorazepam, an anxiolytic drug, was evaluated in a 2-mg dose using a 16-night protocol including 7 nights of drug trial. Initially and with continued use the drug was moderately effective in inducing and maintaining sleep. Side effects included episodes of memory impairment and confusion in 2 subjects and group mean increases in daytime anxiety and tension with continued drug use. Following drug withdrawal, there was a marked and significant worsening of sleep above baseline levels (rebound insomnia) on the third night as well as significant increases in tension and anxiety the next day. The peak degree of withdrawal sleep disturbance was several times the peak degree of sleep improvement with drug administration.", 
    "72": "A therapeutic regimen is described for sedative, analgesic, and anti-emetic effect in patients receiving intra-arterial carmustine (BCNU) for malignant gliomas. This regimen consists of nalbuphine, 30 mg, i.v., and droperidol, 2.5 mg, i.v., given immediately prior to intra-carotid BCNU infusion. Droperidol, 2.5 mg, i.v., is then administered on four hour intervals for sixteen hours post-procedure. This combination provided excellent effect in nine patients treated for twelve intra-carotid infusions. None of the nine patients experienced vomiting, one experienced mild nausea several hours post-infusion, and non complained of severe pain or discomfort. Thirteen additional patients received diazepam, 10 mg, P.O., prior to the intra-carotid BCNU infusion, with fentanyl, 100 mcg, i.v., and prochlorperazine, 10 mg, i.m. at the onset of infusion. All thirteen patients suffered from severe nausea, vomiting, and orbital pain. The nalbuphine/droperidol combination is thought to provide a superior alternative to the traditional narcotic/pheonothiazine/benzodiazepine combination for carotid BCNU infusion. This combination has theoretical advantages for the patient with intracranial mass lesions by providing analgesia and sedation with minimal potential for respiratory depression and carbon dioxide retention.", 
    "73": "Morning urinary norepinephrine (NE) was assessed in 36 patients suffering from panic and phobic disorders according to DSM III. Urinary NE excretion was significantly higher in this group than in a normal control one. Phobic patients excreted lower levels of NE than panic ones. No significant association was found between urinary NE levels and anxiety scores according to Zung's Anxiety Status Inventory or Wittenborn Psychiatric Rating Scale. The NE increase is interpreted as reflecting a sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity in anxiety. A concomitant effect upon NE metabolism of benzodiazepine withdrawal cannot be discarded since the group of patients previously medicated showed the highest NE excretion."
