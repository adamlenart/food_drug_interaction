    "0": "Fifteen minute exposure to a novel environment plus 120 dB sound stimulation produced a three-fold increase in serum corticosterone concentrations in rats. A low dose of intraperitoneally (IP) administered chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (5 mg/kg) attenuated this response, whereas a higher dose (20 mg/kg) elevated corticosterone concentrations in rats not subjected to sound stress. Parallel results were obtained after intracerebroventricular (ICV) drug administration, with a low dose of CDP (5 micrograms) reducing the sound stress response and higher doses (25 and 50 micrograms) increasing corticosterone concentrations in unstressed animals. Thus, despite the presence of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors at every level of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, it appears that BDZs alter the activity of this system via an interaction with BDZ receptors in brain. CL 218,872 (2.5-20 mg/kg), a novel non-BDZ anxiolytic compound, did not attenuate the corticosterone elevation produced by sound stimulation, and also failed to alter baseline corticosterone concentrations in unstressed animals. The fact that CL 218,872 is a selective agonist for brain Type I BDZ receptors suggests that BDZs are not influencing corticosterone secretion through an interaction with this BDZ receptor subtype. Furthermore, these results indicate that stress (as measured by pituitary-adrenocortical activation) can be dissociated from anxiety (as measured by conflict paradigms), thus challenging the validity of the corticosteroid stress test as a screening procedure for anxiolytic activity.", 
    "1": "Psychotropic drug intake by a random sample of citizens of the city of Munich aged 30-69 years has been assessed. A 1-week prevalence of 9.3% for all psychotropic drug users was found, benzodiazepines accounting for approximately two-thirds (6.6%) of the users. Two-thirds of drug users were women. Drug use in both sexes increased with age. The doses of benzodiazepines prescribed in most cases were less than 10 mg diazepam equivalent per day. Intake of benzodiazepines in combination with analgesics or alcohol (greater than or equal to 40 g/day) did not appear to represent a major problem. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the number of chronic diseases was the strongest predictor of benzodiazepine intake in men, whereas stress and age determined intake in women. Long-term use seemed to be relatively rare at 11% of all benzodiazepine users, so it was not considered to be a severe public health problem.", 
    "2": "Various benzodiazepines (BZs) were studied for ulcer protective effect in immobilization stress-induced gastric ulcers in rats. Central type BZ receptor agonists such as clonazepam, chlorodiazepoxide and diazepam shared marked antiulcer effect. The ulcer protective action of these agents was reversed by pretreatment with Ro 15-1788, a central BZ receptor antagonist. However, peripheral BZ receptor binding agent Ro 5-4864 and BZ-micromolar binding agent phenytoin, failed to show any antiulcer effect. Pretreatment with bicuculline also reversed the ulcer protective action of central type BZ receptor agonists. A bicuculline sensitive potentiation was observed in the ulcer protective effect of central BZ receptor agonist, when a subeffective dose was combined with muscimol, a specific GABAA agonist. But no such potentiation was seen with baclofen, a GABAB agonist. These data imply an interaction of central type BZ receptor with GABAA subtype receptor in the ulcer protective effect of benzodiazepines in rats.", 
    "3": "Seventy-two children and adolescents with obsessive movements and tics of residual-organic etiology were treated by combined application of benzodiazepins (diazepam, phenazepam), lithium carbonate and haloperidol. The nature of obsessive syndromes and tics is considered in the light of the theory of generator mechanisms of neuropathological syndromes. The use of the studied combination due to its synergic action on the structures of the pathological system elicited a good therapeutic response while using lower doses of each drug (half to two-thirds of the conventional age-specific dosage). Reduction in drug doses in combined therapy decreases the risk of side effects and complications. The above treatment was followed by disappearance of essential and facultative symptoms in 21 patients, considerable improvement with a marked reduction of facultative symptoms in 22 cases, clear-cut improvement in combination with decreased facultative symptomatology in 14 patients, and insignificant improvement in 6 patients.", 
    "4": "In a randomised, double-blind, parallel groups study, 40 patients undergoing surgical removal of impacted third molar teeth received either midazolam 15 mg orally followed at 35 min by intravenous saline or oral placebo followed by intravenous diazepam 10 mg (Diazemuls). Episodic (event) memory was assessed by showing patients photographs of dental and neutral objects both before and after sedation and by testing subsequent recognition at 1 week. Recall of actual surgical events was assessed by questionnaire. Both treatments induced significant amnesia for visual stimuli and for surgical events. However, the degree of amnesia was more profound for artificial stimuli and no relationship was found between the extent of amnesia for the two types of event. Drilling of bone was found to provoke the greatest cardiovascular stress response and a significant relationship was found between the degree of cardiovascular activation and subsequent memory for drilling. It is concluded that the extent of benzodiazepine-induced event-amnesia may be modified by cognitive factors and especially by the extent to which the event is cognitively encoded and elaborated.", 
    "5": "Pharmacokinetics do not adequately reflect recovery from cognitive neuromotor impairment induced by most benzodiazepines. This paper examines across time the nature of the relationship of effect to serum concentration of three benzodiazepines. Using the same protocol lorazepam, alprazolam, diazepam and placebo were administered to eight healthy males at doses of 0.057, 0.029, 0.286 and 0.000 mg/kg, body weight, respectively for the first study and at 0.028, 0.014, 0.143 and 0.000 mg/kg, respectively, for the second study. After each dose administration multiple measurements were made over a period of 5.5-11.5 h using two different psychomotor performance tests. Serum drug concentrations were also measured. The profiles for diazepam and alprazolam effects demonstrate a stepwise decrement in the slopes of the concentration versus response curves across time, illustrating the rapid development of acute tolerance. In contrast, lorazepam induced a remarkably constant relationship between concentration and effect across testing intervals.", 
    "6": "In mice, intraperitoneally injected chlordiazepoxide and proglumide, both of which are regarded as cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists in the peripheral tissues, dose-dependently inhibited the satiety induced by 200 ng of intracisternally administered CCK octapeptide (CCK8). Intraperitoneally administered diazepam (1 mg/kg) and/or Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine antagonist, both prevented the elevation in the pain threshold induced by 1 microgram of CCK8. However, Ro 15-1788 did not antagonize the effect of diazepam that reversed the CCK-induced antinociception. Ro 15-1788 also inhibited the satiety induced by CCK8. From these results, it was considered that the antagonism, which was observed in the present work, of benzodiazepines and proglumide to CCK8 seemed to occur at the CCK receptor and not at the benzodiazepine receptor in the brain.", 
    "7": "In this communication, I have summarized our studies on the possible roles of cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) in the central nervous system (CNS), from these observations, CSA was suggested to be a neurotransmitter. We reported the presence of CSA in the CNS and subsequently characterized Na+-dependent high affinity uptake and depolarization-induced release of CSA. Depolarization-induced release of [14C]CSA from the preloaded hippocampal slices was specifically attenuated by benzodiazepines and GABA agonists. Synaptic membranes have a Na+-dependent specific binding site for cysteic acid, an analogue of CSA, which may be a possible binding site for CSA. This binding site seemed to be distinct from that for glutamate. To assess CSA as a physiologically active candidate which is distinct from glutamate, two neurochemical experiments were performed: one experiment determined the enhancement by excitatory amino acids of depolarization-induced release of [3H]GABA from the preloaded slices, and the other one monitored the cyclic AMP formation by excitatory amino acids in hippocampal slices. In both studies, differences in the responses to the various antagonists indicate that CSA receptors are distinct from glutamate receptors. Furthermore, we proposed that excitatory amino acid receptors which are subsequently linked to adenylate cyclase are functionally related to the Cl- channel.", 
    "8": "Changes in body composition with age may alter tissue drug uptake and result in altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Four young, 4 middle-aged and 4 old Fischer-344 male rats were given a single intraperitoneal dose of alprazolam (2.5 mg/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg) and triazolam (1.25 mg/kg) and sacrificed after 1 h. Diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, alprazolam, and triazolam concentrations were determined in brain, kidney, liver, spleen, lung, heart, adrenal, muscle, fat and plasma by gas chromatography. Free fraction in plasma was determined by equilibrium dialysis. Drug uptake varied widely among tissues. Highest uptake ratios relative to free (unbound) drug in plasma were in adrenal (56-135), liver (35-116) and kidney (19-50). Free fraction in plasma varied from 0.13 for desmethyldiazepam to 0.30 for triazolam, and was unrelated to age. Tissue drug uptake relative to muscle, total plasma or free plasma concentration showed no significant variation with age or body habitus. In vivo fat uptake was highly correlated (R = 0.95) with in vitro octanol/buffer partition ratio. Muscle and fat were the largest quantitative drug storage sites, with total uptake explained by lipophilicity. Thus, age-related changes in body habitus and clearance do not alter tissue binding of benzodiazepines at distribution equilibrium.", 
    "9": "In order to evaluate the anxiolytic action of drugs, a simple experimental procedure using a corridor-type runway was designed. In this apparatus, five food pellets were set in a row on a plastic platform. Rats with one day food-deprivation take a food pellet and then usually return to the start box. The time required to take 5 pellets (total time) and the number of returns were recorded. Diazepam (DZP) at 1-3.2 mg/kg and zopiclone (ZOP) at 10 mg/kg caused decreases in both parameters. These effects were blocked by the benzodiazepine receptor blocker, Ro15-1788, at 10 mg/kg. However, tracazolate failed to produce any change in both parameters. Haloperidol and imipramine prolonged the total time while reducing the number of returns. In contrast to DZP and ZOP, pentetrazol, well known to possess an anxiogenic effect, prolonged the total time. These results suggest that decreases in both the total time and the number of returns produced by DZP and ZOP may be related to their anxiolytic action which is mediated by a benzodiazepine receptor. Therefore, this procedure would be a simple and selective method for detecting benzodiazepine-type anxiolytics.", 
    "10": "An acute form of \"stress-analgesia\" is evoked by allowing the smoke of a cigarette to envelope the nostrils of unanaesthetized rabbits. The response consists of an immediate and generalized arrest of spontaneous movements, including respiration and expiration, reduced muscular tone, and unresponsiveness to pinching. This motor \"paralysis\" is accompanied by a profound bradycardia. Attempts have been made to identify the neurotransmitters involved in \"the smoke reflex\" by the intervention of antagonists and psychopharmaca. The bradycardia was selectively blocked by atropine, leaving the somatomotor inhibition unaltered. All components of the response were abolished by approximately 60% by clonidine and by 40% by the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline, both of which are known to attenuate the release of noradrenaline as agonsits of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. Yohimbine blocked the clonidine effect. Naloxone (1-2 mg/kg), p-chlorphenylalanine and dexamethasone failed to influence the reflex response, suggesting that opiate, serotonergic and ACTH-systems do not play a critical role. The same applied to the benzodiazepine chlordiapoxide. The results suggest that this acute stress-induced analgesia is mediated via a noradrenergic system. The relationship of the smoke reflex to \"the fear paralysis reflex\", a possible trigger mechanism for the sudden infant death syndrome, is discussed.", 
    "11": "Naloxone reduces the effects of chlordiazepoxide on punishment and on acquisition of differential reinforcement of low rates of response. The present experiments tested whether naloxone also reduces the effects of chlordiazepoxide on a second type of nonreward schedule--successive discrimination. Rats were tested on a variable interval baseline of responding for food with signalled intrusion periods when food was no longer available. Naloxone (3 mg/kg IP) failed to change the effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg IP) on either acquisition or performance of this successive discrimination. DRL and successive discrimination differ both in their timing of events and their use of explicit visual stimuli. If these or similar parametric differences account for the present results they considerably weaken conventional accounts of the control of behaviour by reward omission.", 
    "12": "The opiate antagonist naloxone can completely or partially reverse the effects of the benzodiazepines on appetitive behaviours and conflict tasks involving electric shook. If naloxone changes the anxiolytic action of the benzodiazepines it should theoretically, be effective in tasks employing nonreward as well as those employing shock. We tested naloxone and chlordiazepoxide on acquisition and performance of a nonreward task, DRL. With both continuous administration during acquisition of DRL, and intermittent administration during stable performance, chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg IP) increased burst responding and shifted the peak of the inter-response time (IRT) distribution curve to shorter IRTs. Naloxone (3 mg/kg IP) blocked the effects of chlordiazepoxide on acquisition of DRL. Naloxone (3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg IP) did not change the effects of chlordiazepoxide on well-learned performance of the DRL schedule. These results show that endogenous opiates could mediate some but not all of the actions of the benzodiazepines. They also suggest that state-dependent and \"truly anxiolytic\" effects of the benzodiazepines (McNaughton 1985) may have different pharmacological substrates.", 
    "13": "In rats trained to discriminate nicotine from saline, a single intraventricular injection of a small dose of the quaternary ganglion-blocking drug chlorisondamine blocked the response to nicotine for four weeks. pentolinium was only weakly active and hexamethonium was inactive as a nicotine antagonist under the conditions used, even in doses that were just below those producing myoclonic jerks. Chlorisondamine had no blocking effect in rats trained to discriminate the non-nicotinic drugs midazolam or morphine from saline. Intraventricular injections of chlorisondamine have a specific and unusually persistent nicotine-blocking action, the mechanism of which requires further investigation.", 
    "14": "The relationship between the activity of thieno- or benzo-triazolodiazepines on platelet-activating factor (Paf)-induced effects and on the CNS (central nervous system) was studied in vitro and in vivo. Brotizolam and triazolam inhibited Paf-induced human platelet aggregation. The IC50 -values were 0.54 and 7.6 microM, respectively. This inhibitory effect was not blocked by the specific central-type benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonist, Ro 15-1788, or the specific peripheral-type BDZ ligand, Ro 5-4846. These BDZ ligands also showed an inhibitory effect on Paf-induced platelet aggregation (IC50 = 200 and 560 microM, respectively). Ro 15-1788 or Ro 5-4846 in combination with brotizolam or triazolam enhanced the Paf inhibitory effect of these triazolodiazepines. In guinea-pigs, Ro 15-1788, 100 mg kg-1 p.o. and 10 mg kg-1 i.v. completely inhibited the hypnogenic effect of 10 mg kg-1 p.o. and 1 mg kg-1 i.v. of brotizolam, respectively. Similar results were obtained with triazolam but at higher doses. In anaesthetized guinea-pigs, a dose of 100 mg kg-1 p.o. of Ro 15-1788 did not inhibit bronchoconstriction and hypotension caused by Paf (30 ng kg-1 min-1 i.v.). The combination of brotizolam (10 mg kg-1 p.o.) or triazolam (200 mg kg-1 p.o.) with this BDZ antagonist (100 and 400 mg kg-1 p.o., respectively) did not affect the Paf inhibitory activity of these triazolodiazepines. These results show that the Paf antagonistic properties of the triazolodiazepine can be dissociated from their CNS activity. It is conceivable that compounds of this structural type could be the forerunners of a novel series of potent Paf antagonists.", 
    "15": "A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of clorazepate in the treatment of 189 patients diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of an anxiolytic on the depressed-mood component of anxiety. Clorazepate-treated patients with concomitant high levels of depressed mood, defined as a score of 60 or above on the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), showed significant improvement of anxiety symptomatology, as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, and of depressed mood, as measured by the SDS, compared with placebo-treated patients (all p values less than .01).", 
    "16": "Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride (Librium) or a combination of these drugs, were administered to pregnant mice on gestation days 6 to parturition. Levels of THC in blood were dose-related and approximated levels attained in humans after smoking one to two marijuana cigarettes. Blood cannabinoid levels in mice were elevated by concurrent administration of chlordiazepoxide. Maternal weight gain was significantly reduced by THC but not by chlordiazepoxide. Neither drug affected implantations, but THC significantly increased resorptions. Both THC and chlordiazepoxide decreased fetal weight. There was no indication of synergism between the two drugs for any of the measures examined in this study.", 
    "17": "Circadian rhythms in both the number of peripheral type binding sites for benzodiazepines in platelet membranes and the microviscosity of the erythrocyte membrane were demonstrated in 7 healthy men. Neither variable appeared to be linked to each other, or regulated by the plasma concentrations of total or free cortisol, testosterone, potassium, magnesium, calcium, cAMP, cGMP or proteins or by the erythrocytic concentration of magnesium or potassium or by the plasma cAMP:cGMP ratio or by the ratio of intra-erythrocyte:plasma concentrations of potassium or magnesium. A highly significant negative correlation was found between the microviscosity of the erythrocyte membrane and the activity of the membrane-bound enzyme, methyltransferase I. Such a correlation was validated both on raw data and on 24 hr-means (r = 0.84; P less than 0.01). A circadian rhythm in the activity of this enzyme was also demonstrated. Moreover, a highly significant correlation was also found between plasma transcortin concentration (TRC) and microviscosity (r = 0.50, P less than 0.01), and between TRC and methyltransferase I activity (r = 0.61, P less than 0.01). Such findings may constitute clues towards the understanding of the regulation of the circadian rhythm in the fluidity of the red blood cell membrane in man and guide future steps with regard to the role of this rhythm upon the availability of drug binding sites at the cell surface.", 
    "18": "The regional distribution of binding sites for [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]N-methylscopolamine was studied in human fetal brain of 18 and 23 weeks gestation by in vitro autoradiography. Areas densely labelled by both ligands include the hypoglossal nucleus and the striatum. The latter is characterized by a patchy distribution of both binding sites reminiscent of acetylcholinesterase staining. Similarities with the rat fetus and the occurrence of binding sites in areas of potential significance for fetal behaviour are discussed.", 
    "19": "We investigated the possible existence of endogenous compounds acting on benzodiazepine central receptors in the serum of patients with panic attacks or depression. Our results show the presence of a substance which inhibits the 3H-flunitrazepam binding specifically in the samples taken from the patients' groups, and which is not present in normal controls, in the range of concentrations used. This compound has a molecular weight below 1,000 daltons, is heat-stable, and resistant to proteolytic degradation. The demonstration of this inhibitor opens new perspectives in the study of the biochemistry of anxiety.", 
    "20": "Diazepam (DZP) inhibited in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner superoxide anion generation and chemiluminescence from human neutrophils stimulated by the formylated oligopeptide FMLP and by the calcium ionophore A23187. The dose-dependent inhibitory effect of DZP on A23187-dependent superoxide generation in the presence of Ca++ 0.6 mM was highly antagonized by increasing extracellular Ca++ concentration to 1.5 mM and to 2.0 mM. Ro 5-4864, a specific ligand for peripheral type benzodiazepine (BZ) binding site, inhibited superoxide generation induced by FMLP, while clonazepam (CNZ), which is selective for brain sites, did not possess any activity. Ro 15-1788, a central type BZ receptor antagonist, did not show any antagonistic activity on DZP-dependent inhibition. A new physiological property for substances presenting an affinity for peripheral type BZ binding sites is supposed. The inhibitory effect of BZ on neutrophil functions seemed to be associated with a Ca++-involving mechanism.", 
    "21": "In primates, ovine and human CRH cause ACTH- and cortisol secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. Ovine CRH has a half-life, which is about three times longer than that of human CRH and results in long lasting ACTH- and cortisol responses. Plasma ACTH- and cortisol rises after administration of human CRH mimic the spontaneously occurring secretory episodes of these hormones in man. Pulsatile administration of human CRH restores the diurnal secretory pattern of ACTH and cortisol to normal in patients with apparent CRH deficiency. Facial and upper body flush occur in about 20% of patients receiving intravenously a 1 microgram/kg dose of CRH. Higher doses result in hypotension due to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. The latter is primarily due to dilatation of the superior mesenteric vessels. In in vitro models desensitization of the pituitary corticotroph by continuous, high-dose CRH administration occurs. No down-regulation of ACTH- and cortisol secretion has been shown in vivo, however. Pituitary-adrenal responsiveness to CRH can be modulated by many factors. These factors are involved in the basal regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and in its activation during the stress response. Such factors include AVP, morphine, DAMME, and drugs modulating the endogenous serotoninergic and GABA/benzodiazepine system. Glucocorticoid feedback inhibition of the pituitary is one of the most important factors modulating ACTH- and cortisol responses to CRH. A negative correlation exists between the net ACTH- and cortisol response to exogenous CRH and the basal cortisol plasma concentration. Replacement doses of glucocorticoid result in a drastic decrease of basal plasma concentrations of cortisol and adrenal androgens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "22": "Phylogenetic studies will help to evaluate the structure and function of receptors. We were able to show that the regional heterogeneity of the central benzodiazepine receptor previously described in mammals also applies to avians. In addition, a systematic species comparison of the subunit patterns revealed a certain phylogenetic relationship suggesting evolution by gene duplication and subsequent divergence. In analogy to isozyme systems, these results possibly indicate that the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor is an isoreceptor complex. The implications for neuropsychiatric genetics are discussed.", 
    "23": "The beta-carboline ZK 93,426, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, was administered intravenously to human volunteers at two different doses (0.01 mg/kg, 0.04 mg/kg) according to a double-blind, placebo controlled design. Vital functions (i.e. blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, EEG), peripheral (finger) skin temperature and performance in psychometric tests for psychotropic and cognitive effects were evaluated. Blood samples were collected in addition and certain pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated. ZK 93,426 in both doses was well tolerated and exhibited no side effects. A decrease in peripheral skin temperature and heart rate was observed. In a general estimation of behavioural changes, volunteers experienced a stimulant and activating effect of the drug. An improvement in performance was observed in two cognitive tasks, the \"logical reasoning task\" and \"pictures differences task\" which estimated concentration and attention, respectively. No effects were found in time estimation. Plasma levels 5 min after intravenous administration of ZK 93 426 were 16 +/- 10 ng/ml and 52 +/- 31 ng/ml for 0.01 mg/kg and 0.04 mg/kg, respectively. Total clearance was calculated as 46 +/- 22 ml/min/kg (0.04 mg/kg).", 
    "24": "The effects of Ro 16-6028 and Ro 17-1812, two novel benzodiazepines with mixed agonist and antagonist properties, were studied in rats trained to discriminate either chlordiazepoxide or the benzodiazepine receptor ligand zolpidem. In rats discriminating 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide from saline both Ro 16-6028 and Ro 17-1812 produced responding on the drug lever. At a dose of 10 mg/kg both compounds gave rise to 100% responding on the lever associated with chlordiazepoxide. The dose-response curve produced by Ro 16-6028 was flatter than that for Ro 17-1812, however. The discriminative cue produced by 2 mg/kg zolpidem did not generalise to either Ro 16-6028 or Ro 17-1812. In contrast, both of those compounds antagonised the zolpidem cue and also antagonised the reduction in response rates produced by zolpidem. These results are consistent with previous findings that Ro 16-6028 and Ro 17-1812 may exert anxiolytic-like effects typical of benzodiazepines while antagonising the depressant actions of benzodiazepine receptor ligands. The results are also consistent with the suggestion that the discriminative cues produced by chlordiazepoxide and zolpidem may be mediated, at least partially, by activity at different sub-types of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "25": "Social conflict in mice is associated with at least two forms of analgesia. A long-lasting opioid reaction is evident in intruder mice exposed to prolonged attack, whilst an acute non-opioid analgesia is seen in response to either defeat experience per se or the territorial scent-marking of an aggressive conspecific. Recent work from this laboratory has suggested that the non-opioid analgesic reaction to defeat experience may be mediated via benzodiazepine receptor mechanisms. The present studies were designed to further test this tentative hypothesis. Results confirmed that defeat analgesia is dose-dependently blocked by Ro15-1788 (20-40 mg/kg) and diazepam (2-4 mg/kg), and also indicated partial antagonism of the reaction by CGS8216 (2.5 mg/kg). The partial agonists CGS9896 (2.5-20 mg/kg) and ZK91296 (2.5-20 mg/kg) were ineffective in blocking the reaction, a finding also obtained with the full agonist ZK93423 (0.05-10 mg/kg). However, the antagonist/weak inverse agonist ZK93426 was found to possess significant intrinsic analgesic activity (10 mg/kg) and to enhance defeat analgesia (5-10 mg/kg). Although several interpretative frameworks for the current pharmacological profile are considered, it is concluded that full clarification of the substrates of defeat analgesia must await further investigations.", 
    "26": "Several experiments were conducted to establish the role of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands in aggressive behaviour in male and female rats. In particular, the pro-aggressive effects of BDZ agonists was subject of investigation. Predatory aggression (mouse killing) was facilitated by chlordiazepoxide (CDP) when tested in naive female rats, but CDP was unable to induce muricide in non-killing rats with extensive experience with mice. In experiments on maternal aggression in rats a post-hoc analysis revealed that the pro-aggressive action of CDP on maternal aggression was base line dependent: the increase in aggression in spontaneously low aggressive females was significantly higher than in females with a higher base line level. A further study aimed at unravelling the underlying factors contributing to this pro-aggressive action by determining the role of opponent size on the effects induced by CDP. Normally large opponents evoke less aggression from lactating females than smaller opponents and CDP exerted its pro-aggressive effect particularly strongly in the 'large opponent' situation. An ethological analysis was made of lateral display--an ambivalent posture frequently occurring in agonistic behaviour--to establish whether CDP indirectly increases aggression by reducing fear by means of its anxiolytic properties. The data partly support this hypothesis. These findings stress the importance of environmental and experiential factors in the possible outcome of CDP effects on aggression. Moreover, they point to possible explanations of seemingly contradictory data. In two final experiments an inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist (beta-CCE) was tested in maternal aggression. beta-CCE reduced aggression, although not in a completely specific way. A neutral BDZ-receptor antagonist (Ro 15-1788) was tried in an attempt to antagonize the pro-aggressive effects of CDP in maternal aggression. Ro 15-1788 did not counteract the pro-aggressive action of CDP, but antagonized CDP effects on exploration. The modulatory role of the benzodiazepine receptor complex in aggression remains an intriguing area of research in which many subtleties in testing conditions play a role and in which more BDZ agonists, inverse agonists and antagonists have to be tested.", 
    "27": "Studies have shown that benzodiazepines (BZs) both disrupt discrimination and increase resistance to punishment. Using a delayed response task, we provide evidence that effects of BZs on discrimination cannot be fully explained by deficits in either short or long term memory, or by intolerance for delay of reward. A schedule with rewarded, nonrewarded (Time out: TO) and conflict components was used to investigate effects in rats of compounds active at the BZ receptor on successive discrimination and punished responding in parallel. The GABA transaminase inhibitor ethanolamine-O-sulphate exerted additive effects with chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on punished but not TO responding. Both GABA and CDP injected into the amygdala selectively increased conflict rates, but with peripheral treatment CDP also increased TO rates. Two inverse BZ agonists, CGS 8216 and FG 7142 antagonzied the anti-conflict effects of GABA and CDP, given within the amygdala or peripherally, but the increase in TO rates induced by systemic CDP was counteracted only by peripheral treatments. These compounds also reduced rates of conflict responding below baseline, consistent with anxiogenic activity. Effects of the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 were broadly similar to those of the inverse agonists, except that it did not antagonise the anti-conflict action of intra-amygdaloid GABA, nor significantly reduce punished responding at the single dose used. We conclude from these results that the anti-conflict effects of BZs are mediated by a GABAergic amygdaloid mechanism, but that the same mechanism is not involved in BZ effects on discrimination.", 
    "28": "Several categories of compounds active at benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) in the brain have been distinguished: agonists, antagonists and the novel category of inverse agonist. In terms of their effects on ingestional responses (e.g., food, saline and water consumption), agonists increase levels of intake, inverse agonists reduce intake in some, if not all, tests, while antagonists block the effects of both agonists and inverse agonists. Attention is currently focussed upon a range of compounds which fall between full agonists and antagonists. These partial agonists are of particular interest since they act more selectively than full agonists, retaining effects in animal models of anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity, for example, while largely lacking behaviourally-depressant effects. Recent data indicate that tests of ingestional behaviour distinguish between various BZR partial agonists. The benzodiazepines Ro23-0364, Ro16-6028 and Ro17-1812, as well as the beta-carboline ZK 91296, enhanced ingestional responses. The pyrazoloquinolines, CGS 9895 and CGS 9896, did not, but antagonized agonist-induced increases in ingestion.", 
    "29": "Specific binding sites of peripheral-type benzodiazepines were investigated in human iris/ciliary body (8 eyes). Examination of color-coded prints and densitometric quantification of autoradiograms were performed on slides (20 micron) labelled with [3H]PK 11195 (1 nM) at 25 degrees C. Nonspecific binding was determined with PK 11211 (5 microM) or Ro 5-4864 (5 microM). Binding sites were present on all the slides, with equivalent density in the 3 regions of the preparation (ciliary body, iris, and pupil margin). The numbers of binding sites in ciliary body, iris, and pupil margin, respectively, were: 42.7 +/- 0.2, 30.1 +/- 0.5, and 37.4 +/- 0.4 femtomol/mg protein. Labelling on the pupil margin seemed to coincide with the iris sphincter muscle. The presence of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in iris muscular tissue, and particularly in the pupil margin, suggests that the iris preparation may be a valuable tool to detect putative physiological effects of peripheral benzodiazepines on muscular motility.", 
    "30": "Chronic ethanol inhalation produced no change in the number or affinity of flunitrazepam binding sites on well-washed synaptic membranes prepared from male Quackenbush mice, but produced a significant decrease in the capacity of GABA to enhance flunitrazepam binding. This decrease was characterized by a higher EC50 (1.4 microM compared to 0.6 microM) and a lower maximal level of enhancement (162% compared to 172%) for tissue from the chronically treated animals compared to tissue from control animals. Acute ethanol treatment or ethanol incubated in vitro with the brain membranes did not produce changes in any of the flunitrazepam binding parameters. These results support other findings that chronic ethanol may affect the coupling of various sites on GABA-A receptor-ionophore complexes in brain.", 
    "31": "Ethanol interacts allosterically with the picrotoxin binding sites on the oligomeric GABA receptor complex in vitro. Chronic ethanol treatment does not alter the binding properties of [35S]t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothioate or [3H]flunitrazepam to brain membranes. In behavioral studies, ethanol prevents convulsions induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin and maximal electroshock seizures. Further, subprotective dose of ethanol in combination with other facilitators of GABAergic transmission, provide protection against these convulsions. Finally, ethanol potentiates the effect of GABA on 36Cl-influx in cultured spinal cord neurons. These studies indicate a role for GABAAergic transmission in the actions of ethanol.", 
    "32": "1. A high affinity, saturable, stereospecific binding site for Benzodiazepines has been found to be functionally and possibly structurally related to a GABA receptor-chloride ionophore complex. 2. There are both central (CNS) as well as \"peripheral\" binding sites, involving multiple organs. 3. Evidence strongly suggests that mutually exclusive Benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists bind to the same receptor, possibly in an agonist-antagonist-inverse agonist continuum. 4. The search for an endogenous ligand has been inconclusive and the question of such a substance remains open. 5. Although the relationship between this receptor and the Limbic System remains unclear, it seems certain that the Benzodiazepine receptor plays an important role in the modulation of Limbic System excitability.", 
    "33": "Twenty-eight days of neuroleptic treatment of 11 schizophrenics aged 16-23 years did not affect the binding values of 3H-PK 11195 to platelets. This lack of effect was in contrast to reduced peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) observed in platelets of schizophrenics medicated over 2 years. These results may indicate that neuroleptic-induced down-regulation of PBS is a time-dependent phenomenon.", 
    "34": "Recent developments in positron emission tomography and ligand binding techniques have allowed the visualization of regional metabolism and neuroreceptor distributions in the living human brain. For dopamine-D 2 and benzodiazepine receptors it has also been possible to determine neuroreceptor characteristics such as Bmax and Kd by performing in vivo saturation analysis of ligand binding to the receptors. Using 11-C raclopride and 11-C-Ro 15-1788 as ligands for dopamine-D 2 and benzodiazepine receptors respectively we have determined Bmax and Kd-values in healthy volunteers and patients with various types of neuropsychiatric disorders. These ligands were also used in order to determine the degree of receptor occupancy in psychiatric patients treated with different types of drugs interfering with these neuroreceptors. We have administered 11-C-deoxy-glucose, 11-C-raclopride and 11-C-Ro 15-1788 to patients with Alzheimer's disease in order to examine possible alterations of glucose utilization and neuroreceptor distribution and quantities in these patients. The preliminary results indicate that this approach may be useful for the analysis of degenerative alterations of neuron populations and neuroreceptor systems in Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "35": "Benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding characteristics were determined from glial cultures prepared from the cerebral hemispheres of newborn mice. Receptor binding and saturation analyses were performed at various ages in culture on intact cells. Utilizing 5 nM 3H-diazepam at 0.4 degrees C, specific binding reached a plateau at 16-21 days after plating. A single high-affinity binding site was identified with Kd 25.3 +/- 2.6 nM and Bmax 7,575 +/- 410 fmol/mg protein. Inhibition studies utilizing clonazepam indicated that this ligand, thought to have affinity exclusively for neurons, displaces more than 20% of the specific BDZ binding at concentrations as low as 300 nM, although the IC50 was 1.5-2.0 microM. In contrast, the IC50 for Ro5-4864 was 10-20 nM.", 
    "36": "Regional development of beta-adrenergic binding sites in the rat fetal central nervous system and pineal gland were studied in relation to the ontogeny of different drug and neurotransmitter binding sites. 3H-dihydroalprenolol labels the olfactory bulb very early in fetal life. A comparatively early development of binding sites is also seen for benzodiazepines during late gestation. 3H-serotonin, 3H-muscimol, 3H-GABA and 3H-(N)-methylscopolamine additionally label the olfactory bulb, revealing quite different patterns. Around gestational day 16, beta-adrenergic sites were found in the neocortex, then in choroid plexus and in the pineal gland. Besides beta-adrenergic, only 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites are detectable in the fetal eye, the latter with a more restricted regional distribution. In the fetal pineal, beta-adrenergic, muscarinic cholinergic and serotonergic binding sites appear at different times in gestation. In the neocortex a variety of binding site patterns develop. Two more general types can be distinguished: appearance along with caudorostral maturation of the brain and appearance within distinct brain regions, possibly related to local differentiation processes. The simultaneous onset of various binding sites in distinct areas of the fetal brain might result in higher sensitivity of individual brain areas to drugs.", 
    "37": "Different aspects on the structure-activity relationships, the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic properties of the benzodiazepines (BDZs) are briefly outlined, followed by a more thorough description of the current hypothesis on the mode of action of these drugs, focusing on the supramolecular GABA-BDZ-chloride-ionophore receptor complex. The existence of different synthetic ligands for the receptor exerting opposite effects is discussed together with the recent finding in mammals of an endogenous ligand with anxiogenic-like effects. The possibility of the anxiolytic effects of the BDZs being related to actions on monoaminergic systems is also briefly mentioned. A new group of BDZs, the triazolo-BDZs, is described. One of these compounds, alprazolam (APZ), exhibits a different clinical profile as compared to traditional BDZs. Apart from being effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety, it has been proven effective also in the treatment of panic disorder. Some studies also indicate anti-depressant effects of the compound. The reason for these apparent unique effects of APZ is not clear. A brief description of a commonly applied animal model (the Vogel conflict model) for the study of anxiety-related mechanisms is given and original animal data from experiments aiming at elucidating the mechanism behind the anti-panic effect of APZ are presented. The results indicate that tolerance to different pharmacodynamic effects of APZ and the traditional BDZ diazepam (DIZ) develop to different extents. Thus, tolerance development to the ataxic/sedative effects of APZ was pronounced, whereas no significant tolerance developed to the anxiolytic-like effects. For DIZ, however, tolerance development was pronounced to both the anxiolytic-like and the ataxic/sedative effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The effect of atropine (1-10 micrograms . kg-1) on neuromuscular transmission in humans was studied by analysing its effects on the amplitude of indirectly-elicited twitch (0.2 Hz) and tetanic (50 and 100 Hz for 1 s duration) contractions. Six patients, free from any neuromuscular disorders, undergoing orthopaedic surgery, were included in the present study. The patients received either no premedication or the oral benzodiazepine, temazepam, 30 mg 1-2 h pre-operatively. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol (1-2 mg . kg-1, i.v., over 20 s). The patients breathed no less than 30% oxygen in nitrous oxide, halothane (1%) or enflurane (1-2%). Incremental doses of fentanyl (50-100 micrograms) were given to provide additional analgesia. The ulnar nerve was stimulated, supramaximally, at the wrist, and control mechanical responses of the adductor pollicis muscle, to nerve stimulation at 50 and 100 Hz for 1 s duration, were recorded. Theses responses were repeated at 2, 5 and 10 min intervals, after injection of atropine (1-10 micrograms . kg-1). At the same time, heart rate and blood pressures (systolic and diastolic) were recorded. The results showed that atropine enhanced the tetanic contractions, elicited at 50 and 100 Hz for 1 s duration, by 27 +/- 1.2% (50 Hz and atropine, control 220 +/- 13 g tension), and by 43 +/- 7% (100 Hz and atropine, control 333 +/- 26 g tension) at the 5 min intervals (mean +/- S.E., n = 6).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In the tottering mutant mouse, which suffers from epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia, we examined whether possible changes in GABA, benzodiazepine receptors and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity are implicated in the pathophysiology of these animals. 2. No alteration in GABAA and GABAB binding could be detected in cerebellar membranes of epileptic mice as compared to normal mice. 3. Benzodiazepine receptor density and affinity showed no statistical difference in cerebellar membranes of epileptic and normal mice. 4. The activity of ChAT determined in the cortices of epileptic and normal mice did not differ significantly between the two groups.",

    "41": "We have tested the effect of a psychoactive water-soluble derivative of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, SP-111A, on the binding of [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam to rat brain membranes. It was found that SP-111A reduced the specific binding of [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam. The inhibition by SP-111A was dependent not only on the concentration of the ligand but also on the protein content of membrane preparations. The inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]diazepam by SP-111A was found to be competitive with Ki value of 3.1 microM. In the presence of 7.5 microM SP111A the apparent Kd of [3H]diazepam binding increased from 4.3 nM to 12.5 nM, without affecting the Bmax. The inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam by SP-111A was also competitive, however, the IC50 was higher than with [3H]diazepam. The inhibition by SP-111A appeared to be caused by its tight binding to the benzodiazepine binding sites of brain membranes.", 
    "42": "Rats shifted from 32% to 4% sucrose show a negative contrast effect, licking significantly less than animals that receive only 4% sucrose. The effects of morphine sulfate (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 8.0, and 16.0 mg/kg) on negative contrast were investigated in four experiments. Contrast was reduced on both the 1st and 2nd postshift day by the 4.0 and 8.0 mg/kg doses, but the effects were less robust than those seen with the benzodiazepines. The effects of morphine on contrast were dissociable from simple increases in sucrose consumption. Naloxone (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg) had no effect on contrast or sucrose intake. However, the contrast-reducing effect of morphine (4.0 mg/kg) was blocked by pretreatment with naloxone (0.50 mg/kg). The results are discussed in terms of other anxiolytic screening paradigms that have obtained \"partial anxiolytic effects\" using morphine.", 
    "43": "Selective breeding techniques were used to alter allelic frequencies responsible for diazepam sensitivity and resistance. We used the rotarod test to determine the duration of diazepam-induced neurologic deficit in genetically heterogeneous mice. Males were more sensitive than females in the initial population. We then selectively bred for diazepam resistance and sensitivity. A significant difference between the lines was apparent in both sexes after two generations, and divergence has continued over seven generations. Brain benzodiazepine assays indicated that absorption and distribution of diazepam do not differ in the two lines. Differences in brain benzodiazepine concentrations at recovery from ataxia indicated that the two lines differ in central nervous system sensitivity. We found diazepam-induced rotarod impairment to be blocked in a dose-dependent manner by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788, indicating that this effect is mediated through BZ receptors. A dose-response curve obtained from generations 6 and 7 indicates a 9- to 14-fold difference in dose required to obtain similar effects in the two lines. These mice are expected to be useful experimental subjects in studies of benzodiazepine mechanisms.", 
    "44": "The effects of a single dose of oxazepam on seizure threshold, receptor occupancy and brain oxazepam concentration were investigated at several time points after drug treatment in two inbred strains of mice (NIH and C3H/HE). The C3H/HE strain showed a greater sensitivity to the effects of both pentylenetetrazol and oxazepam. Furthermore, the C3H/HE strain showed decreases in both receptor occupancy and seizure threshold across time, whereas the NIH strain showed no change in either measure. Although within-strain correlations were observed between seizure threshold and receptor occupancy, the C3H/HE strain had similar seizure thresholds to the NIH strain throughout but lower percentage receptor occupancies, thus a between-strain correlation was not observed. The C3H/HE strain had a higher number of specific benzodiazepine binding sits and these results may reflect a strain difference in GABA-benzodiazepine receptor coupling. In a further experiment, the development of acute tolerance to the effects of oxazepam was investigated. Brain concentrations of oxazepam and receptor occupancies were determined for each strain of mouse, at two different time points (1.5 and 7.5 h after drug treatment), at which equivalent seizure thresholds were obtained by manipulating the starting dose of oxazepam. For each strain, when equivalent seizure thresholds were observed at different time points, equivalent receptor occupancies were also observed. However, a trend towards higher brain concentrations of oxazepam at the later time point was detected for the two strains, suggesting that there may be some decrease across time in the affinity of the receptor for oxazepam.", 
    "45": "The protective effect of various alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonists such as clonidine, guanfacine, B-HT 920 and ICI 106270 was investigated against Ro 5-4864-induced convulsions in mice and rats. Clonidine and ICI 106270 exhibited a profound anticonvulsant effect while equivalent doses of guanfacine and B-HT 920 were less effective. The anticonvulsant effect of clonidine and ICI 106270 was reversed by pretreatment with yohimbine or idazoxan, indicating the involvement of alpha 2 adrenoceptors in their protective effect. Diazepam, clonazepam, CL 218, 872 and pentobarbitone exhibited a different profile of protective action, as these agents protected the animals from apparent mortality as compared to clonidine and ICI 106270 which prolonged the latencies of jerk and convulsion. Modulatory effects of alpha 2 adrenoceptors in central GABA function and multiple sites for Ro 5-4864-induced seizures are explained.", 
    "46": "The benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonists, FG 7142 (1.25-10.0 mg/kg, IP) and CGS 8216 (2.5-20.0 mg/kg, IP), significantly attenuated the consumption of a palatable sweetened diet by non-deprived male rats in a 30 min test. Adrenalectomy failed to affect the reduction in food intake produced by these two drugs. Similarly, the anorectic effects of the opiate antagonists, naltrexone (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, SC) and diprenorphine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg, SC) in the same feeding paradigm were unaffected by adrenalectomy. So far as palatability-induced feeding in concerned, anorectic effects of BZ inverse agonists and opiate-antagonists appear to be adrenal-independent in the rat. The benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.3 mg/kg, IP) and diazepam (1.0 mg/kg, IP), stimulated food consumption in both adrenalectomized and sham-operated animals.", 
    "47": "The present study investigated the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788 on the ability to resist sleep after 1 night of sleep deprivation. Repeated administrations of RO 15-1788 to 6 subjects significantly decreased their ability to resist sleep in comparison with repeated administration of 100 mg of vitamin C, and with a nontreatment condition. Most of the hypnotic effect occurred 80-100 min after drug ingestion. RO 15-1788 also significantly enhanced sleep stage 2 spindles activity. These results demonstrate that at certain dosages RO 15-1788 has agonist-like effects.", 
    "48": "The beta-carboline FG 7142 and pentylenetetrazole, believed to act at different sites on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, have anxiogenic activity in the social interaction test in the rat. Two compounds that have anti-panic activity in man, the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine and the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, were used to try to antagonise the anxiogenic effects of the 2 drugs. Imipramine (5 and 15 mg/kg) was tested after 0 or 15 days pretreatment. In neither case was it able to reverse the anxiogenic effect of pentylenetetrazole (15 mg/kg). However, after chronic treatment the effects of FG 7142 were reversed. Imipramine itself had an anxiogenic action that was significant after acute treatment, and its effects were not additive with those of FG 7142 or pentylenetetrazole, suggestive of some mutual antagonism between acute imipramine and the 2 drugs. Similar mutual antagonism was obtained after acute treatment with clonidine (0.01 and 0.025 mg/kg).", 
    "49": "In this study, ligands from various chemical classes were investigated with respect to their relative affinities to calmodulin (CaM) and troponin C (TnC), using the fluorescent dye 3,3'-dipropylthiocarbocyanine iodide (diS-C3-5'). In parallel, functional tests were carried out determining the effects of the ligands on the CaM activated cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity and the TnC mediated Ca-sensitivity of skinned myocardial fibres and cardiac myofibrils. The following results were obtained: 1) As a rule, most of the ligands tested had higher affinities to CaM than to TnC. 2) Even within one and the same pharmacological class (e.g. phenothiazines) the relative affinities for CaM and TnC varied considerably, trifluoperazine (TFP) or levomepromazine (LMP) showing low or no CaM specificity, methophenazine (MP) on the other hand being highly selective for CaM by a factor of more than 200. 3) In all cases tested, the functional tests were in good quantitative agreement with the binding data, showing inhibition of CaM stimulated PDE activity and Ca-sensitizing effects in concentrations corresponding well with the respective drug affinities to CaM and TnC, respectively. 4) It is concluded that a) interaction of ligands with TnC can lead to Ca-sensitization of the cardiac contractile system and a positive inotropic effect without a concomitant elevation of the intracellular level of activator Ca. This may result in a novel cardiotonic principle avoiding the common side effects of 'classical' positive inotropic agents due to Ca-overload. b) drug selectivity for TnC or CaM appears chemically achievable.", 
    "50": "The motor impairing effects and central monoaminergic neuronal effects of barbital (120 mg/kg, IP) and lorazepam (3 mg/kg, IP) were studied in the alcohol tolerant (AT) and alcohol non-tolerant (ANT) rat lines developed for low and high sensitivity to motor impairment from ethanol (2 g/kg, IP), respectively. Like ethanol, both barbital and lorazepam impaired the performance of the ANT rats more than that of the AT rats. Ethanol increased the synthesis of catecholamines in the striatum and hypothalamus, but barbital and also lorazepam decreased it in both rat lines. Ethanol increased or did not modify the synthesis of 5-HT in the cerebral cortex and hypothalamus, while barbital and lorazepam decreased it; the rat lines did not differ in these neuronal effects.", 
    "51": "Several different types of chemical compounds are useful as antiepileptic drugs. Their mechanisms of action, as well as their physical structures, differ. Compounds such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and probably valproate act by modifying ionic conductances, particularly sodium and calcium, in excitable membranes, thus limiting sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. In contrast, barbiturates and benzodiazepines tend to affect gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mediation of the chloride channel opening. Knowledge of drug mechanisms is important for choosing the proper drug for various seizures types. In addition, an understanding of antiepileptic drug pharmacokinetics, nontherapeutic effects, and interactions is essential for optimal therapy. The lack of uniform pharmacokinetics among patients and among different formulations of a drug can make it difficult to arrive at uniform criteria for both seizure control and determinations of toxicity. both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions can occur between antiepileptic medications and other drugs. Three major types of side effects with anticonvulsants can be identified: dose-related alterations of neurologic function, idiosyncratic reactions, and nonidiosyncratic function, idiosyncratic reactions, and nonidiosyncratic direct actions on other organ systems. These effects often compromise treatment.", 
    "52": "Alterations in several neurotransmitter systems in brain have been implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatic coma (HC). Studies on human autopsy material are few. We investigated 3H-quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB), 3H-spiperone, 3H-imipramine, 3H-PN-200-110, 3naloxone, 3H-flunitrazepam, 3H-muscimol, 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphothionate and 3H-cyclohexyladenosine binding sites in frontal cortex from seven patients with HC and five controls. The density of 3H-QNB binding sites was significantly decreased and the affinity slightly increased in HC. The functional significance of these selective changes in muscarinic receptor binding sites is unclear. Further studies evaluating cholinergic function in HC are indicated. Acute studies in animals point to an increase in GABA and BZ binding sites in HC. The present results show that the BZ/GABA-receptor-chloride-ionophore complex is unchanged in HC in man. Serotonergic (5HT-2), adenosine (A-1), imipramine (5HT uptake sites), opiate (naloxone) and calcium channel antagonist binding sites are unchanged in HC.", 
    "53": "GABA-gated chloride channels in the central nervous system contain a regulatory site, the benzodiazepine receptor, through which drugs can modulate the efficiency of GABAergic synaptic transmission and thereby affect the degree of anxiety, muscle tension, vigilance and convulsions. The biochemical analysis of the purified receptor complex with monoclonal antibodies shows a heterooligomeric composition of two glycosylated subunits (alpha, beta). The immunoprecipitated complex contains the binding sites for GABA, benzodiazepines and the convulsant TBPS. The receptor complex was located, immunocytochemically, in synapses of brain regions rich in GABAergic nerve terminals.", 
    "54": "CCK-8, bombesin, secretin and urecholine added in various concentrations to the incubation medium of the dispersed pancreatic acini, obtained from rats, resulted in a dose-dependent stimulation of amylase secretion, the half-maximal response being achieved at 3 X 10(-12), 10(-10), 10(-7) and 10(-5) M, respectively. Pirenzepine (selective muscarinic M1 receptor blocker) or atropine failed to affect the amylase responses to all these secretagogues except that to urecholine, which was reduced by both antimuscarinic agents. The inhibition of urecholine-induced half-maximal amylase secretion by both anticholinergics was concentration-dependent, and the inhibitory potency of pirenzepine was about 1,000 times lower than that of atropine.", 
    "55": "Biochemical and electrophysiological studies have shown that ethanol potently inhibits voltage-dependent calcium channels in presynaptic nerve terminals in brain. The ability of ethanol to inhibit calcium channels appears to vary from one brain region to another. Chronic ethanol administration results in adaptation of the calcium channels in certain brain regions such that they become tolerant to the inhibitory actions of ethanol. Other sedative-hypnotic drugs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, also inhibit calcium channels but may differ from ethanol in their brain regional potency. These studies suggest that the pharmacological actions of ethanol and other sedative-hypnotic drugs may be linked with alterations in calcium channel function.", 
    "56": "The effect of short term administration of lithium on the hyperactivity induced by a mixture of d-amphetamine (DEX) and chlordiazepoxide (CDZP) have been examined in the rat and an attempt made to relate this action to changes in brain concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). The DEX-CDZP mixture caused a large increase in Y-maze entries (P less than 0.001). Lithium (2 or 4 mEq/kg) attenuated the increase in entries (P less than 0.001) and activity cage locomotion (P less than 0.01) without significantly affecting these parameters in saline-treated rats. However, the increased 5-HT concentration (P less than 0.05) found in the midbrain after the DEX-CDZP mixture was not modified by prior administration of lithium. In control rats lithium had no effect on the level of 5-HT in the cerebellum, cerebral cortex, midbrain or striatum. Levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in all four brain regions were unaffected by both the DEX-CDZP mixture or pretreatment with lithium. The possible action of the DEX-CDZP mixture on central 5-HT systems and the suitability of the hyperactivity induced by the drug mixture as a model for mania is discussed.", 
    "57": "Midazolam differs from diazepam in that midazolam is water-soluble, more potent and has a shorter elimination half-life (t1/2). To date, it has been used primarily for induction of anesthesia and as an anesthetic supplement. Diazepam has been shown to decrease the catecholamine response to perioperative stress. This study determined the extent to which midazolam influences the physiological and hormonal responses that are evoked by a nitroprusside-induced hypotensive challenge. Plasma levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine (NE), cortisol, and renin activity, as well as hemodynamic performance were measured in dogs anesthetized with enflurane-nitrous oxide-oxygen. Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg i.v. administered prior to a 30% decrease in mean blood pressure statistically attentuates the increase in plasma catecholamines. The cortisol and renin increases that occurred in response to the hypotension were not affected appreciably by midazolam. Hemodynamic changes due to midazolam were minimal, with only a transient 8-10% decrease in mean blood pressure observed. The findings of this study demonstrate that midazolam, like diazepam and fentanyl, can reduce the physiological and hormonal response to hypotensive episodes that occurred during the course of anesthesia and surgery.", 
    "58": "Atropine, pirenzepine (PZ) and the novel antimuscarinic drug [11- [[2-(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) were used to subclassify the pancreatic muscarinic receptor by correlating their effects on carbachol-mediated amylase release with their actions on the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine in rat pancreatic acini. Maximal stimulation of amylase release occurred at 3 microM carbachol. Atropine, PZ and AF-DX 116 inhibited carbachol-mediated amylase release with the following pA2 values: atropine = 9.1, PZ = 6.5 and AF-DX 116 = 5.7. There was parallel inhibition of [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding, with the following inhibition constants: atropine = 2.38 nM, PZ = 426 nM and AF-DX 116 = 3660 nM. Using the same animals, these compounds inhibited [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding in homogenates from both cerebral cortex and heart. The order of potency was the same in the cerebral cortex as in the pancreas: atropine = 0.67 nM, PZ = 85 nM and AF-DX 116 = 440 nM. However, in the cortex, the binding data with PZ also exhibited a high-affinity site with a KH value of 11 nM. In the heart, the order of potency was shifted to atropine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than PZ, with inhibition constants of 1.55, 12 and 110 nM, respectively. Thus, the muscarinic receptors in the pancreas and the heart exhibited the characteristics of the putative M2 receptor subtype, having lower affinities for PZ than the muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex. However, the heart had a significantly higher affinity for AF-DX 116.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "59": "The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, AP7, was evaluated in two animal test procedures known to be sensitive to the effects of diazepam. In rats trained to discriminate diazepam from vehicle, AP7 produced dose-dependent generalization to the diazepam interoceptive stimuli. This NMDA antagonist also increased the rates of conflict responding in a chronic test procedure used to identify compounds with potential anxiolytic effects. A comparison of AP7 with diazepam and two muscle relaxants (methocarbamol and baclofen) showed that excitatory amino acid antagonists (of the receptor site stimulated by NMDA) produce a muscle relaxant effect (drug discrimination) and may represent a new class of compounds for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders (conflict test).", 
    "60": "In a double-blind randomized study on 16 healthy individuals, two groups of subjects (8 in each group) received either midazolam (Dormicum; Roche) 0.1 mg/kg or placebo intravenously for conscious sedation during oral surgical procedures. Oxygen saturation of the blood was measured at different stages. Ten minutes after administration of the drug, the percentage oxygen saturation was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the midazolam group than in the placebo group.", 
    "61": "A new non-benzodiazepine compound proposed as a non-sedating anxiolytic was tested in the mouse exploratory model of anxiety. CGS 9896 significantly increased the number of light dark transitions at doses beginning at 7.5 mg/kg i.p. Analysis of general locomotor activity at these doses revealed no change in spontaneous motor activity in a photocell equipped activity monitor. Pretreatment with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro15-1788, 10 mg/kg i.p., blocked the increase in light dark transitions produced by CGS 9896. These data support the interpretation that CGS 9896 acts as an anxiolytic through the benzodiazepine receptor, and appears to have no sedating properties within the anxiolytic dose range.", 
    "62": "The novel bicyclic compound Wy-45,030 [1-2-(dimethylamino)-1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl cyclohexanol, hydrochloride] exhibited a neurochemical profile predictive of antidepressant activity. Like the tricyclic antidepressants, it inhibited rat brain imipramine receptor binding and synaptosomal monoamine uptake (dopamine as well as norepinephrine and serotonin). It did not inhibit monoamine oxidase. Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, it was not antimuscarinic in the guinea pig ileum, nor did it have any appreciable affinity for brain alpha-1 adrenergic or histamine-1 binding sites. Wy-45,030 was also without affinity for alpha-2 or beta adrenergic, benzodiazepine, serotonin-1, serotonin-2, dopamine-2, and opiate receptors. Such a profile is predictive of antidepressant activity devoid of the side-effects common to tricyclic therapy.", 
    "63": "Some H2-receptor antagonists can interact with the biotransformation of other drugs. This is due to their binding to cytochrome P-450. We tested the in vitro effects of 5 different H2-receptor antagonists cimetidine (C), oxmetidine (O), ranitidine (R), famotidine (F) and nizatidine (N) on arylhydrocarbon-hydroxylase, 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase and 7-ethoxy-resorufin-O-deethylase activity using liver microsomes from man as well as from untreated, phenobarbital and 3-methylcholanthrene treated rats. In addition their binding to human microsomal cytochrome P-450 was evaluated. The in vivo effects of these antagonists were investigated on the hepatic elimination of diazepam in healthy volunteers. In vitro O was found to be the most effective inhibitor of the enzyme activities studied. C showed a clear inhibitory effect only with rat liver microsomes whereas the remaining drugs were more than 10 times less potent. The binding affinities of these antagonists showed a similar tendency: the Ks-values for O, C and R were 0.2, 0.9 and 5.1 mM, respectively; for F and N no binding up to 4 mM could be observed. However, in man, only C inhibited the hepatic elimination of diazepam by about 45% while R, O, N and F did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diazepam. Thus, it could be concluded from our studies that one cannot extrapolate in vitro data of the inhibitory potency of H2-receptor antagonists in every case to human in vivo drug metabolism.", 
    "64": "Using a specific radioimmunoassay we have investigated the distribution of octadecaneuropeptide (a putative endogenous ligand at the benzodiazepine receptor)-like immunoreactivity (ODN-IR) in rat brain and peripheral tissues. Highest concentrations in brain were found in the hypothalamus, cerebellum and substantia nigra. Significant concentrations of ODN-IR were found in all peripheral tissues studied and in plasma. Chromatographic analysis revealed several molecular forms; one major form, indistinguishable from the synthetic peptide, was found predominantly in peripheral tissues and in plasma, while another major form, of higher molecular weight, was found in brain, peripheral tissues and plasma. Although ODN-IR was present in the synaptosomal fraction, concentrations in the microsomal fraction were higher than for other neuropeptides studied.", 
    "65": "Tifluadom, a benzodiazepine kappa-opiate agonist, stereoselectively inhibited the binding of 125I-CCK to pancreatic membranes (IC50 = 47 nM). Several other opiate agonists were ineffective. Scatchard analysis indicated the inhibition of CCK binding by tifluadom was competitive in nature. Tifluadom (1 microM) did not displace 125I-CCK binding to brain tissue or 125I-gastrin binding to fundic glands. In the isolated guinea pig gallbladder, tifluadom antagonized CCK-8 induced contractions with an estimated pA2 of 6.8. These data demonstrate that tifluadom is a peripherally selective CCK antagonist. This unique action could contribute to its reported analgesic and appetite stimulatory properties.", 
    "66": "Activation of muscarinic receptors caused an alteration of the configuration of action potentials in the isolated sympathetic ganglion cells of rabbits, e.g. elimination of the shoulder in the falling phase and depression of the afterspike-hyperpolarization and after-depolarization. The responsible receptors appeared to be of the M2-type since the above changes by the low concentration (greater than or equal to 10 nM) of muscarinic agonists were potently antagonized by AF-DX 116. Similar changes were induced by removing the external Ca2+ and no more changes were produced by further application of muscarinic agonists in the absence of external Ca2+. The action potential in sympathetic neurons is thus shown to be modulated via the M2 receptor possibly by regulating the Ca entry.", 
    "67": "GABA-gated chloride ion influx was measured in brain 'microsac' preparations of young (20-22-day-old) and older (40-42-day-old) C57BL6J and DBA2J mice. The young DBA2J mice are susceptible to audiogenic seizures. GABA sensitivity was reduced in young DBA2J mice as compared to age-matched C57BL6J mice or older mice of either strain. Age and strain differences in ligand binding to GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex and glutamate receptor could not account for this finding. These results provide evidence for a defect in GABA-gated chloride ion influx in audiogenic seizure-susceptible DBA2J mice.", 
    "68": "Ethanol, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations of 20 to 100 mM, stimulates gamma-aminobutyric (GABA) receptor-mediated uptake of 36Cl-labeled chlorine into isolated brain vesicles. One drug that acts at GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513, has been found to be a potent antagonist of ethanol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into brain vesicles, but it fails to antagonize either pentobarbital- or muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake. Pretreatment of rats with Ro15-4513 blocks the anticonflict activity of low doses of ethanol (but not pentobarbital) as well as the behavioral intoxication observed with higher doses of ethanol. The effects of Ro15-4513 in antagonizing ethanol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake and behavior are completely blocked by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. However, other benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists fail to antagonize the actions of ethanol in vitro or in vivo, suggesting a novel interaction of Ro15-4513 with the GABA receptor-coupled chloride ion channel complex. The identification of a selective benzodiazepine antagonist of ethanol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in vitro that blocks the anxiolytic and intoxicating actions of ethanol suggests that many of the neuropharmacologic actions of ethanol may be mediated via central GABA receptors.", 
    "69": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic compound that does not produce the sedation often associated with the use of benzodiazepines. The present study evaluated the effects of this anxiolytic on sleep in rats surgically prepared for long-term recordings. Buspirone, at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.p., produced a significant increase in total wake time (P less than 0.05) compared with drug-free controls. At a dose of 10 mg/kg i.p., rats displayed altered sleep patterns with the most significant effects observed in the first third of recording period. These animals displayed increased wakefulness (P less than 0.001), decreased non-REM sleep (P less than 0.001), and an obliteration of REM sleep (P less than 0.02). These data support the suggestion that the clinically useful anxiolytic buspirone, unlike the benzodiazepines, does not induce sleep.", 
    "70": "Daily administration of diazepam (1.5 or 6 mg/kg) in Rhesus monkeys results in the progressive development of physical dependence, as evidenced by Ro15-1788 (5 mg/kg i.m.) precipitated withdrawal symptoms including retching, vomiting, face and limb tremors. Every third day administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro15-1788, during a similar period of continuous diazepam exposure, significantly decreases withdrawal behaviors. During the course of diazepam exposure (with or without periodic Ro15-1788 administration) effects of chronic diazepam on spontaneously elicited sedative and active behaviors were not altered. It is postulated that physical dependence reverts to a drug naive state after each exposure to the benzodiazepine antagonist. This treatment may represent a possible therapeutic approach for preventing the (time dependent) development of physical dependence and the accompanying severe withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "71": "Calea zacatechichi is a plant used by the Chontal Indians of Mexico to obtain divinatory messages during dreaming. At human doses, organic extracts of the plant produce the EEG and behavioral signs of somnolence and induce light sleep in cats. Large doses elicit salivation, ataxia, retching and occasional vomiting. The effects of the plant upon cingulum discharge frequency were significantly different from hallucinogenic-dissociative drugs (ketamine, quipazine, phencyclidine and SKF-10047). In human healthy volunteers, low doses of the extracts administered in a double-blind design against placebo increased reaction time and time-lapse estimation. A controlled nap sleep study in the same volunteers showed that Calea extracts increased the superficial stages of sleep and the number of spontaneous awakenings. The subjective reports of dreams were significantly higher than both placebo and diazepam, indicating an increase in hypnagogic imagery occurring during superficial sleep stages.", 
    "72": "The effects of pirenzepine and ranitidine alone and combined, on gastric acid secretion and gastrin release stimulated by liquid peptone meal were evaluated in 12 duodenal ulcer patients. Six patients received placebo and ranitidine 150 mg per os and the other six patients were given placebo, pirenzepine 50 mg and pirenzepine 50 mg plus ranitidine 150 mg per os, according to randomized sequences. In the first experiment ranitidine markedly inhibited (69%) gastric acid secretion for entire two hours period (p less than 0.01). In the second experiment acid secretion after pirenzepine, was reduced by 39% while the combination of pirenzepine plus ranitidine almost completely inhibited the meal stimulated acid secretion (99%). Mean integrated gastrin responses after pirenzepine and ranitidine alone as well as pirenzepine plus ranitidine were not significantly different from placebo. The results of these studies show that in duodenal ulcer patients, the simultaneous block of muscarinic and H2-receptors, suppresses meal stimulated gastric acid secretion, without affecting gastrin release. This therapeutic combination might be used in clinical situations (non-responders, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) in which complete inhibition of gastric acid secretion is needed.", 
    "73": "The response to pirenzepin, a new acetylcholine receptor blocking agent, was assessed and compared to placebo in patients with reversible bronchoconstriction. A single intravenous injection of 20 mg of pirenzepin induced a significant reduction of airway resistance compared to placebo (p less than 0.05). The anticholinergic substance pirenzepin appears to be useful in the treatment of bronchospasm.", 
    "74": "Forty newly admitted alcohol-dependent patients were randomly allocated to equivalent 6-day regimes of either lorazepam or diazepam, to compare involvement in physical, emotional and cognitive state during the first 8 days in hospital. Diazepam provided a more comfortable withdrawal period and was associated with slightly better cognitive functioning on the eighth day.", 
    "75": "The effects of naloxone on acetylcholine (ACh) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) outflow from the cerebral cortex of freely moving, morphine-dependent guinea-pigs was studied. The cortical efflux of ACh in chronically-treated guinea-pigs was about half of that of normal animals. GABA efflux was unaffected. During opioid withdrawal precipitated by naloxone (0.1-10 mg kg-1, i.p.) the guinea-pigs showed jumping, hyperactivity and wet dog shakes, the intensity of which was directly related to the dose of naloxone. The withdrawal syndrome was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in ACh release and reduction in GABA outflow; ACh release was increased by naloxone at doses lower (0.1-3 mg kg-1) than those acting on GABA efflux (1-10 mg kg-1). Atropine (10 mg kg-1) and diazepam (5 mg kg-1) did not prevent GABA and ACh changes.", 
    "76": "Hyperkin\u00e9sie volitionnelle is one of the involuntary movements discriminated from intention tremor. It occurs idiopathically and with cerebral infarction, head trauma, brain tumors, multiple sclerosis, hepatolenticular degeneration and polyneuropathy. Here, we report a case of toluene intoxication presenting hyperkin\u00e9sie volitionnelle. A 28-year-old painter noticed a tremor of the upper extremities on December 1979. The tremor occurred both in posture and in voluntary movements. The tremor gradually developed and appeared in the legs in May 1980. Slight titubation of the trunk and head was marked in sitting posture. He showed staggering of gait. On August 1980, he exhibited slurred speech. He was admitted to the Department of Neurology of Chiba University Hospital on January 19th, 1981. Neurological examination revealed slight mental deterioration, pendular nystagmus, bradylalia, 4-5 c/s violent postural tremor of the upper extremities, action myoclonus, head and truncal titubation, mild leg tremor in sitting posture. The tremor increased terminally on finger to nose testing, and showed fast, coarse, convulsive movement (movement oppositionniste). But there was no dysmetria. The involuntary movements, above mentioned, were summarized as hyperkin\u00e9sie volitionnelle. Muscle tone was hypotonic. Muscle weakness and atrophy were not seen. Deep tendon reflexes were all exaggerated, but there was no pathological reflex. He showed wide-based ataxic gait. Sensory and autonomic functions were normal. Blood, urine and cerebrospinal fluid analysis appeared normal. Electroencephalography showed 40-50 microV, 9-10 c/s alpha waves with a few fast waves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "The Mongolian gerbil is known to develop delayed neuronal death in the hippocampus following brief forebrain ischemia (Brain Res 239: 57-69). Morphological, biochemical, or electrophysiological studies on this neuronal injury have shown that neurons still retain potential reversibility at the earlier period of alteration. To examine this possibility, immediately following 5 min of ischemia in the gerbil, pentobarbital, diazepam, or nizofenone was injected. Seven days following ischemic insult, animals were perfusion fixed and neuronal density in the hippocampal CA1 subfield was counted. Most of the neurons in the CA1 sector survived ischemic insult when a drug was given, whereas most of them were lost without the treatment. The average neuronal density of treated groups showed a statistically significant (p less than 0.01) persistence compared with that of control group. The effective dosage of the drugs were 20-40 mg/kg in pentobarbital, 10-20 mg/kg in diazepam, and 12.5-25 mg/kg in nizofenone. On the other hand, when pentobarbital was injected 1 hr following ischemia, while neurons still remain intact morphologically, it showed no effect. This result indicates that the neuronal damage of \"delayed neuronal death\" type is reversible if treatment is instituted at an early period of cell change."
