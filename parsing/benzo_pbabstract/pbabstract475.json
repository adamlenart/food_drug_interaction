    "0": "In slices of frontal cortex and hippocampus from rats that had been habituated to handling for 21 days, there was significantly less 20 mM K(+)-evoked release of [14C]GABA ([14C]gamma-aminobutyric acid) compared with rats naive to handling. Handling for 21 days also significantly increased the uptake of [14C]GABA into frontal cortex and hippocampus. The change in uptake in the hippocampus was independent of any changes in release and could account for the apparent change in evoked release; in the cortex there were no independent changes in uptake and K(+)-evoked release. When the changes in uptake were taken into account, there were no independent changes in basal release of GABA in either region. HPLC analysis showed the change in uptake was not due to differences between the groups in endogenous GABA concentrations. Acute administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP 7.5 mg/kg i.p.) to handling naive rats also significantly reduced K(+)-evoked [14C]GABA release from the cortex and hippocampus, but basal release and GABA uptake were unchanged. Neither handling nor CDP administration significantly changed the K(+)-evoked [3H]5-HT release, however, the uptake of 5-HT and its basal release in both regions were both significantly and independently increased in animals habituated to handling, compared with handling naive animals. In the hippocampus, the endogenous 5-HT concentrations were significantly lower in the rats that had received 21 days of handling, compared with handling naive rats. In the cortex the endogenous 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentrations were significantly lower in the group that had been handled for 21 days. Thus both the GABA and 5-HT systems were responsive to handling habituation.", 
    "1": "The protein binding and pharmacokinetics of diazepam, ACC-9653 (a phenytoin prodrug), and phenytoin were evaluated in nine healthy male volunteers following administration of diazepam and ACC-9653, alone or concomitantly, in a randomized crossover design. No significant differences were observed in the fraction unbound or pharmacokinetic parameters of ACC-9653, phenytoin, or diazepam when ACC-9653 was administered alone compared to concomitant administration with diazepam. The phenytoin fraction unbound increased significantly with increased concentrations of ACC-9653, indicating displacement of phenytoin from its binding sites by ACC-9653. ACC-9653 also demonstrated concentration dependent binding. The lack of a significant pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ACC-9653 and diazepam suggests that these drugs may be safely administered together, although this conclusion should be confirmed in the intended patient population.", 
    "2": "Reports of the withdrawal syndrome following discontinuation of diazepam and drug dependence fears have contributed to diazepam's displacement as the most popular anxiolytic agent. Reports of the withdrawal syndrome, the factors involved in withdrawal, and the remedies proposed for diazepam withdrawal symptoms are reviewed.", 
    "3": "Surface-negative DC shifts, arising from depolarization of apical dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, represent excitability of cortical neuronal networks. Hyperventilation, used in epilepsy diagnosis to provoke epileptiform discharges, is thought to increase excitability of neuronal tissue; correspondingly, hyperventilation produces negative DC shifts. Extreme negative DC shifts, accompanying epileptiform EEG patterns, have been observed in epileptic patients during hyperventilation. Anticonvulsants, supposed to dampen cortical excitability, should inhibit the development of overexcitability and, hence, also of pronounced negative DC shifts. The present study examined DC shifts induced by hyperventilation in healthy human subjects under the influence of the benzodiazepine, clonazepam, which is used as anticonvulsant. In a double-blind setting, 36 male student volunteers received 4.5 mg clonazepam or the equivalent amount of placebo. DC-EEG and respiration rate were measured during 3 periods each of 3 min: baseline, hyperventilation, and recovery. Compared to baseline, hyperventilation produced a negative DC shift of an average 36 +/- 8 microV under placebo conditions. Clonazepam reduced the hyperventilation-induced negativity to 13 +/- 5 microV. Negativity suppression became weakened with increasing blood plasma levels of the drug. Respiration depth and frequency, increasing under hyperventilation, did not differ among the groups. Clonazepam treatment gave rise to beta-waves and prevented the increase in alpha and theta activity that was found in placebo subjects during the recording period; this was only true, however, for low to moderate plasma concentrations of clonazepam. Results are consistent with the notion that a hyperventilation-induced increase in neuronal excitability can be measured by cortical DC shifts. The reduction of negative shifts under anticonvulsants might indicate dampening of cortical neuronal excitability which is intended by antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "4": "An animal model was developed to evaluate the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and MK-801 in soman poisoning and to examine the possible mechanism of soman-induced convulsions. The oxime HI-6 (125 mg/kg, i.p.) was given to male rats, to increase survival, 30 min prior to 180 micrograms/kg, s.c. (equivalent to 1.6 x LD50) of soman, which produced 100% occurrence of convulsions. Initially, diazepam was studied with or without the concomitant administration of various doses of atropine sulfate 30 min prior to soman challenge. Diazepam (1.25-10.0 mg/kg, i.m.) alone did not prevent soman-induced convulsions. In the presence of 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg/kg of atropine, the anticonvulsant ED50 doses of diazepam were 0.490, 0.257, 0.132 and 0.136 mg/kg, respectively. Atropine sulfate at a dose of 16 mg/kg prevented the soman-induced hypersecretion, showed some anticonvulsant activity and provided a good motor recovery. MK-801 by itself, at or above 1 mg/kg, prevented convulsions, but markedly potentiated the lethal effects produced by soman. With atropine (16 mg/kg), the anticonvulsant ED50 for MK-801 was 0.037 mg/kg, which indicated that MK-801 was about 4 times as potent as diazepam, and the lethal interactions between MK-801 and soman were suppressed. The findings indicate that, in soman poisoning, diazepam and MK-801 are effective anticonvulsants in the presence of the anticholinergic atropine sulfate. The possible sequence of events and neuropharmacological mechanism of soman-induced convulsions are discussed.", 
    "5": "In a previous study we found that the intrinsic excitability of the hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells increased under helium pressure (80 bar). We presently show that drugs inhibiting gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake or facilitating GABA binding partially reversed the pressure-induced hyperexcitability of the CA1 pyramidal cells. When these drugs were simultaneously applied with 2-D,L-aminophosphonovaleric acid, a specific antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the effect of pressure on the neuronal excitability was nearly abolished. These results suggested that the observed pressure-induced hyperexcitability of pyramidal cells resulted from reduced efficiency of GABA transmission and facilitated excitation mediated by NMDA receptors.", 
    "6": "This survey of doctors' attitudes took place against the background of professional concern over litigation in the field of benzodiazepine prescribing and the prospect of imposed audit of General Practitioner's (GP's) work. One hundred and thirty-three GPs in the Argyll and Clyde Health Board Area responded to a postal questionnaire (44% response rate) asking about their opinions on the reasons for benzodiazepine over-prescribing. Further statements suggested possible interventions to reduce this acknowledged problem. The study group appear representative of the population from which they are drawn. Benzodiazepine over-prescribing appeared to be a meaningful term to the doctors who replied to this survey. In their replies, GPs acknowledged this to be a multifactorial problem with complex social and psychological roots. Those who responded appear to have a positive attitude to reducing the problem and appear willing to use the alternative strategies which would be required.", 
    "7": "In recent years concern has been frequently expressed that a long-term treatment with fluspirilene 1.5 mg/week might induce tardive dyskinesia, yet there are no empirical data from controlled studies available. In 11 private practices 276 patients under long-term treatment with either fluspirilene or benzodiazepines for reasons of anxiety or psychoneurotic or psychosomatic disorders were investigated by an independent and specially trained physician from our hospital with regard to symptoms to tardive dyskinesia, parkinsonism, and akathisia. Of these patients, 155 had received fluspirilene 1.5 mg/week with a mean duration of treatment of 17.5 months (s = 13.3), and 121 had received benzodiazepines with a mean duration of treatment of 45.7 months (s = 44.6). The mean total scores of the AIMS, the Simpson Angus Scale, and an akathisia scale did not differ significantly between the two groups. In the fluspirilene group a positive correlation of age and psychotropic comedication with the total scores of the AIMS and the akathisia scale could be found, but there was no correlation between duration or continuity of treatment with fluspirilene and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia. In each of the two groups 10 patients (6.9% of the fluspirilene group and 8.3% of the benzodiazepine group) showed abnormal involuntary movements, which corresponds to the incidence of spontaneous dyskinesia. The results of this study do not indicate an increase in tardive dyskinesia for patients with a mean duration of treatment with fluspirilene 1.5 mg/week of 18 months.", 
    "8": "One of the core problems in clinical research is the detection of early changes in target symptoms that predict future therapeutic outcome. To analyze potential predictors of outcome, data of a multicenter study on patients with panic disorder were used. A total of 1010 patients were randomly allocated either to alprazolam, imipramine or placebo treatment. Early improvement in the number of spontaneous panic attacks within the first week of treatment predicted outcome exclusively in the alprazolam group. In contrast, placebo responders and nonresponders were differentiated by early changes in anticipatory anxiety intensity. For tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine an evaluation period of more than one week is required to allow conclusions about outcome.", 
    "9": "Six groups of common drugs of abuse (cannabinoids, benzoylecgonine, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and amphetamines) were determined in whole blood after acetone precipitation, using enzyme multiplied immunoassay (EMIT dau) and fluorescence polarisation immunoassay (FPIA--Abbott TDx and ADx) methods. Both methods, designed primarily for urine, allowed the determination of all above mentioned class of drugs but amphetamine. Only 1 ml of a pre- or postmortem blood sample was needed. The sensitivity of cannabinoids determination was higher by FPIA. The FPIA method gave more precise results, particularly in the case of autopsy blood. The method was applied for drug screening in autopsy and police blood samples. The results (both positive and negative) were in agreement with those obtained with chromatographic methods.", 
    "10": "The efficacy of flunitrazepam (0.04 mg.kg-1) as a premedicant was evaluated in 40 young children of less than 5 years of age in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Flunitrazepam was given by the rectal route 15 min prior to an inhalational mask induction with halothane. Sedation score, mask acceptance and induction score were significantly better in premedicated children than in the placebo group. There were no hypoxic episodes, prolonged sedation or other complications in either group. This suggests that flunitrazepam administered rectally in a low dose is an acceptable premedication in young children.", 
    "11": "The aim of this study was to compare recovery assessed with the Newman, deletion af a's and postbox tests after total intravenous anaesthsia for procedures lasting more than 90 min, with either propofol (PPF) or midazolam (MDZ), reversed or not by flumazenil (FMZ). Thirty patients scheduled for peripheral surgery were randomly allocated to 3 groups of 10, receiving by continuous infusion until the end of surgery either PPF (n = 10) or MDZ (n = 20) combined with alfentanil. FMZ was administered thereafter to 10 patients receiving MDZ until they opened their eyes on command or to a maximum dose of 1 mg. Recovery tests were performed 45, 90 and 180 min after the end of anaesthesia. Results were analysed with non-parametric tests. Recovery scores were significantly better in the PPF group at all times, reaching control values at 180 min for the three first tests. FMZ reversal did not improve the scores compared to those resulting from MDZ alone. This study provides further data in favour of PPF as far as rapid and complete recovery is concerned. The efficiency of FMZ is incomplete and only transient when administered in a single dose.", 
    "12": "Food effects on adinazolam absorption from sustained release (SR) adinazolam mesylate tablets were assessed in 28 healthy male volunteers. Subjects received 15 mg SR tablets, 15 mg immediate release tablets, 15 mg oral solution, administered after an overnight fast, and 15 mg SR tablets after a high fat breakfast. Treatments were administered in a crossover design. Plasma adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD) concentrations were determined by HPLC. Adinazolam and NDMAD AUC values were unaffected by food. Cmax for SR tablets was increased 33 per cent and 18 per cent for adinazolam and NDMAD, respectively, when administered postprandially. Tmax occurred later in the fed state; no dose dumping was observed. Meal timing effects on adinazolam absorption from SR tablets were assessed in 24 healthy subjects, who received 30 mg SR tablets 1 h before, 0.5 h after, 2 h after a high fat meal, and in the fasted state. Postprandial administration had no effect on AUC, but resulted later and higher adinazolam and NDMAD Cmax. Differences in these values were less than 11 per cent. Administration of SR tablets before meals yielded Cmax and Tmax values which were similar to the fasted state. Results suggest that meal timing does not substantially affect adinazolam absorption from the SR tablet.", 
    "13": "1. The effect of severe hypothyroidism on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxazepam 15 mg given orally (n = 10) and the metabolism of paracetamol 750 mg given intravenously (n = 8) was investigated before and after treatment with levothyroxine. 2. The median total and unbound clearance of oxazepam increased significantly during the study period from 0.78 ml min-1 kg-1 (0.40-1.25) to 1.22 ml min-1 kg-1 (0.66-1.94) and from 9.3 ml min-1 kg-1 (5.2-14.2) to 15.9 ml min-1 kg-1 (7.8-21.8), respectively (P less than 0.01). 3. The elimination half-life of oxazepam was prolonged by hypothyroidism to a median (range) value of 9.3 h (5.4-21.9) compared with 7.5 h (4.8-10.5) in the euthyroid state (P less than 0.05). 4. Hypothyroidism did not affect the protein binding of oxazepam; median values of the free percentage being 8.2% as compared with 7.7% when euthyroid. 5. The median (range) clearance of paracetamol under hypothyroid conditions was 3.12 ml min-1 kg-1 (1.64-4.40) and 4.70 ml min-1 kg-1 (3.18-5.70) following replacement therapy (P less than 0.01). This increase was associated with a comparable increase in the partial clearance to the glucuronide metabolite: 1.86 ml min-1 kg-1 to 2.70 ml min-1 kg-1. 6. Hypothyroidism was associated with decreased performance in a finger tapping test that was exacerbated by oxazepam. When the patients were euthyroid oxazepam did not produce any effect.", 
    "14": "Adult female, Fischer-344 rats were exposed to 275 mg/kg of tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TRCP) by gavage. TRCP produced consistent signs of convulsive activity within 60-90 min after dosing and extensive loss of CAT hippocampal pyramidal cells when examined 7 days after dosing. At the light microscopic level, toxic effects of TRCP on pyramidal cells in the CA3 and CA4 regions and on granule cells in the dentate gyrus were less severe than those on the CA1 cells. The seizure-related and neurohistological effects of TRCP were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with atropine or chlordizepoxide, suggesting that the hippocampal damage was related to the seizures produced by TRCP. In a second experiment designed to assess the potential health risk associated with TRCP, exposed rats were mildly impaired in the acquisition of a reference memory task in a water maze. However, TRCP-exposed rats were consistently impaired in performing a repeated acquisition task in the water maze. These data underscore the potential health risk associated with exposure to TRCP and support the conclusion that the hippocampus is intimately involved in spatial memory in rats.",

Trichloroethylene is no longer manufactured in the United Kingdom and halothane is not recommended for closely repeated anaesthetics.

    "16": "A 39-year-old patient was found to be unconscious after having taken 2.5 g of chloroquine. Treatment consisted mainly of gastric lavage and diazepam. Experimental and clinical evidence is presented to show that diazepam in varying doses significantly decreases the mortality rate.", 
    "17": "A double-blind, parallel group study using flumazenil and placebo was carried out to determine whether patients who received flumazenil would awake more quickly and whether this drug would reverse the protection conferred by midazolam on the psychic sequelae of ketamine. Fifty female patients were studied. The results showed that there was a significant reduction in awakening time (p = 0.02) and a very significant increase (p = 0.001) in the incidence of dreams in the flumazenil group.", 
    "18": "A need exists for a safe and effective oral preanesthetic medication for use in children undergoing elective surgical procedures. We evaluated the effectiveness of three different doses of oral midazolam when administered in combination with atropine prior to ambulatory surgery. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 124 children, ages 1-10 yr, received midazolam, 0.25, 0.50, or 0.75 mg.kg-1 po, and atropine, 0.03 mg.kg-1 po, mixed with apple juice, or a placebo (containing the midazolam vehicle, atropine, and apple juice). A blinded observer noted the child's level of sedation, the quality of separation from parents, and the degree of cooperation with an inhalation induction of anesthesia. Picture-recall was used to assess the amnesic effect of midazolam in children over 5 yr of age. Midazolam 0.75 mg.kg-1 produced significant sedation at 30 min. After procedures lasting an average of 106-113 min, recovery was not prolonged by the oral midazolam-atropine combination. We concluded that oral midazolam 0.5-0.75 mg.kg-1 is an effective preanesthetic medication for pediatric outpatients.", 
    "19": "Recent morphologic and behavioral studies of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid agents on transsynaptic degeneration after cortical and striatal damage are reviewed and discussed. Following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex, mild atrophy appears in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Long-term diazepam administration greatly enhances this degeneration, extends the degeneration into the thalamus, and severely disrupts recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Following unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the striatum, progressive degeneration of neurons occurs in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and efferent targets in the thalamus. This degeneration can be prevented by chronic infusion of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist. Unexpectedly, this treatment did not facilitate recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Recovery in muscimol-treated animals was impaired relative to saline-treated controls. Thus, gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists either may enhance or prevent neural atrophy secondary to brain damage, but the behavioral outcome appears to depend importantly on the excitatory and inhibitory characteristics of the affected networks.", 
    "20": "When L-platelet-activating factor (PAF) or alprazolam (a PAF antagonist) was administered to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice, the level of plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF alpha) determined by either ELISA or a cytotoxic assay using WEHI cells was significantly lowered. The inactive stereoisomer, D-PAF, was not effective in lowering plasma TNF alpha levels in LPS-treated mice. The decrease in plasma TNF alpha induced by L-PAF or alprazolam was partly reversed by indomethacin. Despite a decrease in plasma TNF alpha, L-PAF or alprazolam caused an increase in the amount of TNF alpha mRNA present in the kidneys and the livers of LPS-treated mice, suggesting that a posttranscriptional event leading to the synthesis or release of TNF alpha was inhibited by these agents.", 
    "21": "Diagnostic criteria for panic disorder have been well defined; but treatment modalities, less so. Combined psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy is the most effective treatment for these disorders. Benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and other medications have been found effective in clinical studies. Alprazolam, a triazolo analog of the 1,4 benzodiazepine class, recently was proved effective in a cross-national study involving approximately 1700 patients, with minimal side effects. Therapy with the medication is advised for at least 6 months. Medications should be tapered over a prolonged period, at least 8 weeks, especially where high doses are employed.", 
    "22": "Adjustment disorder with anxious mood can be difficult to differentiate from other anxiety disorders or personality disorders. Particular care must be taken to distinguish between the reasonable, expected response to psychosocial stressors and the inordinate response that may indicate the diagnosis of adjustment disorder. Once the diagnosis has been established, options for the management of these patients include nonpharmacologic approaches, pharmacotherapy, and combinations of both. The ultimate goals of treatment are to mobilize the patient's stress-coping mechanisms and to prevent the adjustment disorder from developing into another, more chronic condition, such as generalized anxiety disorder.", 
    "23": "Nine of 11 patients with social phobia of both the generalized and performance type responded to treatment with clonazepam in total daily doses ranging from 0.75 to 3 mg. Only 2 of these 9 had comorbid panic disorder; the benefit for social phobic symptoms appears independent of clonazepam's putative efficacy for panic disorder.", 
    "24": "Current studies have begun to elucidate the pathophysiology of alcoholism and its withdrawal syndrome. Newer benzodiazepines, beta-blockers, alpha-agonists, butyrophenones and calcium channel blocking agents, alone and in combination, have been studied recently in alcohol withdrawal. This article discusses evaluation and therapy for delirium tremens, major alcohol withdrawal, mild alcohol withdrawal, adjunct therapy, and admission criteria.", 
    "25": "The comparative pharmacodynamics of midazolam and diazepam were examined by use of the electroencephalogram as a measure of drug effect on the central nervous system. Intravenous doses of 7.5, 15, and 25 mg midazolam and 15, 30, and 50 mg diazepam were given on repeated occasions to three volunteers. Arterial plasma concentration and electroencephalogram voltage were related with nonparameteric and parametric pharmacodynamic models. The peak increases in voltage (maximal effect) and the slopes of the plasma concentration versus effect curve were similar for both drugs. The half-time of blood:brain equilibration was significantly longer for midazolam than diazepam (4.8 minutes versus 1.6 minutes). Midazolam was found to have an intrinsic steady-state potency that was approximately five times greater than that of diazepam (152 ng/ml versus 958 ng/ml).", 
    "26": "The goal of this investigation was to determine a numerical electroencephalographic parameter that best indicated the degree of the effect of midazolam, administered in hypnotic doses, on the central nervous system. This electroencephalographic parameter could then be used to relate midazolam plasma concentrations and electroencephalographic drug effect (pharmacodynamic modeling). Intravenous doses of midazolam (3.75 to 25 mg) were given to five men at an infusion rate of 5 mg/min. A cortical electroencephalogram was continuously recorded. Two waveform analysis approaches were examined: fast Fourier transformation and aperiodic analysis. From fast Fourier transformation and aperiodic analysis a set of parameters were examined as measures of drug effect. We conclude that the voltage per second from aperiodic analysis provided the electroencephalographic parameter that optimally measured the effect of midazolam on the central nervous system.", 
    "27": "A single oral 5 mg dose of diazepam was given to 16 healthy native Chinese Han volunteers. Eight volunteers were extensive metabolizers of S-mephenytoin, and eight were poor metabolizers of S-mephenytoin. Plasma levels of diazepam and its demethyl metabolite were determined by HPLC in blood samples drawn during 4 weeks. There was no difference in diazepam disposition between the two phenotypes. However, the plasma half-life of demethyldiazepam was longer in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers of mephenytoin (mean +/- SD: 161 +/- 37 and 116 +/- 29 hours, respectively; p less than 0.02). The plasma concentrations of demethyldiazepam at 7, 14, and 21 days after intake of diazepam were significantly higher in poor metabolizers than in extensive metabolizers. We compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam in Chinese subjects with our previously reported data from white subjects. The mean plasma half-life values of diazepam in Chinese extensive metabolizers (85.1 hours) and poor metabolizers (88.3 hours) were very similar to those in white subjects who were poor metabolizers (88.3 hours), and more than twice those in white subjects who were extensive metabolizers (40.8 hours). In parallel, the mean clearance of diazepam in Chinese subjects (independent of phenotype) was similar to that in white subjects who were poor metabolizers, but half that in white subjects who were extensive metabolizers. Chinese subjects had a slightly larger volume of distribution of diazepam than white subjects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Central type benzodiazepine receptors were studied in 9 patients with Friedreich's ataxia and 12 healthy subjects using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]Ro 15-1788, a specific antagonist of the central type benzodiazepine receptors, as radioligand. A standard PET procedure was used in 5 patients and 8 controls to obtain brain kinetics of the total binding of the radioligand. The remaining subjects were intravenously injected with a saturating dose of unlabeled Ro 15-1788, 30 minutes after the tracer injection, to determine the nondisplaceable binding of [11C]Ro 15-1788. A semi-quantitative method was used to quantify the [11C]Ro 15-1788 data. None of the quantification indices in the cerebellar hemispheres, or in the other brain areas investigated, was significantly modified in patients with Friedreich's ataxia. These findings suggest that brain benzodiazepine receptors are unaffected in Friedreich's ataxia.", 
    "29": "Impaired cortical inhibition may be involved in epileptogenic mechanisms. In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated a reduction of the cortical benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density in the epileptic foci of patients with partial epileptic seizures. In the present study, we used the same method in 10 patients with primary generalized epilepsy to determine whether an altered BZD receptor binding could also be demonstrated in this patient group. The [11C]-labeled BZD receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 was used as ligand. Receptor affinities and densities were calculated in various cortical regions and then compared with the values from corresponding \"nonepileptic\" regions in the previously examined partial epilepsy patients. Focal alterations of the BZD receptor density or affinity were not demonstrated in patients with generalized epilepsy. This patient group had a slight tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density, however, as compared with corresponding values from 10 patients with partial epilepsy. Our results strongly suggest that a focal alteration of cortical inhibition is not a prominent feature of human generalized epilepsy. The observed tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density may be a consequence of diffusely impaired cortical inhibition. Further investigations of this issue are therefore indicated.", 
    "30": "The effects of benzodiazepines on learning and memory were investigated, using passive avoidance and latent learning tasks, with particular attention being paid to the possible involvement of benzodiazepine receptors and the cholinergic neuronal system. Benzodiazepines such as diazepam, nitrazepam and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) impaired the passive avoidance response when administered before training, but not when administered immediately after training or before the retention test. CDP also impaired latent learning in the water finding task. State-dependent learning was not observed with CDP at the dose used. A benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, and a benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788, completely and partially reversed, respectively, the disruptive effects of CDP on learning and memory at the doses which did not enhance learning and memory. The disruptive effects of CDP on learning and memory were partially antagonized by a choline esterase inhibitor, physostigmine, and by a blocker for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, scopolamine, at the doses which increase acetylcholine release. These results suggest that benzodiazepines induce disruptive effects on learning and memory through benzodiazepine receptors, and that benzodiazepine-induced impairment of learning and memory is, at least in part, the result of the dysfunction of the cholinergic neuronal system.", 
    "31": "The present study compares the effects of different hypnotics acting at omega 1/omega 2 sites (zolpidem, zopiclone, flunitrazepam and triazolam) on 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding to well-washed rat cerebral membranes, in the presence of 1M NaCl. Under these conditions, all compounds enhanced 35S-TBPS binding in the 0.05 to 10 microM range with EC50 values and maximal enhancement of: zolpidem, 84 nM and 36%; flunitrazepam, 8 nM and 41%; zopiclone, 171 nM and 51%; triazolam, 2 nM and 42%. Under these conditions, gamma-aminobutyric acid enhanced 35S-TBPS binding with an EC50 of 240 nM and a 38% maximal increase. The EC50 values for the stimulation of 35S-TBPS binding are well correlated, with (r = 0.97) the affinity of these compounds at omega 1/omega 2 sites, and are in the same concentration range. This enhanced binding was due to an altered apparent affinity for the 35S-TBPS recognition site without any change in the number of sites (Scatchard analysis). The effect of zolpidem and other hypnotics was antagonized by flumazenil. This was an apparently competitive antagonism in the case of zolpidem or flunitrazepam, whereas for zopiclone, increasing the concentration of the hypnotic did not overcome the antagonism. Bicuculline only partially antagonized the hypnotic-induced enhancement of 35S-TBPS binding. This antagonism was more effective for zopiclone (-57%) than for either zolpidem (-33%) or flunitrazepam (-30%). Zolpidem and the other hypnotics studied induced a fast component of dissociation which was not observed in the control membranes. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that omega 1/omega 2 agonists increase the frequency of openings of the chloride ionophore, with both gamma-aminobutyric acid-A receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms.", 
    "32": "The binding affinities of selective muscarinic antagonists were compared with their ability to block receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase and stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the longitudinal muscle of the rat ileum. When measured by competitive inhibition of the binding of N-[3H]methylscopolamine, the binding properties of selective muscarinic antagonists were consistent with a two-site model. Approximately 84% of the binding sites (major sites) had high affinity for the M2-selective antagonists methoctramine and AF-DX 116 (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1- piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), whereas the remainder of the sites (minor sites) had high affinity for hexahydrosiladifenidol and its para-fluoro derivative. There was good agreement between the estimates of the dissociation constants of muscarinic antagonists for the major binding site and those measured by antagonism of the adenylate cyclase response. There was also good agreement between the dissociation constants of muscarinic antagonists for the minor binding site and those measured by antagonism of the phosphoinositide response and the contractile response. Our data indicate that there are at least two types of muscarinic receptors in the longitudinal muscle of the ileum, the more abundant being an M2 receptor, which mediates an inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, and the less abundant being an M3 receptor, which triggers contraction and phosphoinositide hydrolysis.", 
    "33": "Endogenous proteolysis of the major central benzodiazepine (BZ) binding protein of 53K occurs rapidly postmortem and leads to a fragment of 47K. To determine indirectly the protease responsible for this proteolysis, membranes of porcine cortex were prepared from homogenates, which were either frozen immediately or left at room temperature for 12 h in the presence or absence of various representative protease inhibitors. Membranes were subsequently photolabeled with [3H]flunitrazepam, and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography or immunoblotted using an alpha-subunit-specific monoclonal antibody bd-24. Both fluorographs and immunoblots revealed that calpain inhibitor I, Ep-459 (E-64 analogue), and EDTA (greater than or equal to 1 mM) prevent endogenous proteolysis. In future studies one of these inhibitors should be added to receptor preparations. The results indicate that calpain is the responsible protease.", 
    "34": "We performed a survey concerning the use of psychotropic drugs among 223 patients admitted to a university hospital in November 1986. 39% of patients were receiving some psychotropic drug, and 73% of these corresponded to benzodiazepines. Insomnia and anxiety were reported as the main causes for drug use. Patients above age 50 were most affected. 61% of drugs had been in use for more than 6 months. These results confirm previous findings regarding psychotropic drug use in adults.",

    "36": "During a 4-week period the rats received ethanol (EtOH), as their only drinking fluid, in a concentration ranging from 6% to 20%. In the period of 72 hours after EtOH withdrawal the rats received diazepam (DZP), imipramine (IMI) or caffeine (CAFF) i.p. twice a day in a 12-hours interval. In the experiments carried out on the livers isolated from these rats, we observed the diminution of the rate of EtOH elimination from the perfusate by the livers of DZP and IMI treated rats. CAFF did not change the rate of EtOH elimination.", 
    "37": "The effects of different manipulations of brain serotonergic (5-HT) systems were investigated in Montgomery's conflict test, an animal anxiety model based on the animal's inborn urge to explore a new environment and its simultaneous fear of elevated, open spaces. The putative 5-HT1A receptor agonists buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone and 8-OH-DPAT all produced anxiolytic-like effects in narrow low dose-ranges, while in higher doses the behavior returned towards that seen in controls and, after the highest doses of buspirone and gepirone, was suppressed below that of controls. The 5-HT precursor L-5-HTP produced a biphasic dose-response curve. In a single low dose an anxiolytic-like action was obtained, while in the highest dose a clear-cut anxiogenic-like action was observed. The 5-HT depleting agents parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) both produced anxiolytic-like effects. Thus, anxiolytic-like and anxiogenic-like effects after various manipulations of brain 5-HT neurotransmission can be obtained also in an animal anxiety model involving neither consummatory behavior nor punishment. The anxiolytic-like effects after all these treatments are suggested to be due to decreased brain 5-HT neurotransmission, while the anxiogenic-like effect obtained after the highest dose of L-5-HTP is suggested to derive from increased 5-HT neurotransmission. Furthermore, using a modified Vogel's conflict model it was investigated whether the anxiolytic-like effects obtained after PCPA and 5,7-DHT involve the GABAA/benzodiazepine (BDZ) chloride ionophore receptor complex. Both the BDZ receptor antagonist flumazenil and the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline counteracted the PCPA induced anticonflict effect in doses which did not affect the behavior per se.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "38": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the DHP Ca2+ antagonist nimodipine in human AWS and post-AWS. Ten hospitalized alcoholics of both sexes with a diagnosis of AWS according to the DSM-III criteria were treated for 3 weeks in monotherapy with nimodipine p.o. at flexible daily dosages. Evaluation of AWS symptoms was performed at baseline and after 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 and 21 days. A statistically significant improvement of AWS was seen at evaluation on day 3, particularly in neurovegetative and psychopathological symptoms, and lasted up to the end of the study. The treatment was well tolerated and no side effects were observed or reported. In this pilot, open study nimodipine proved effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate AWS. If these data are confirmed in a double-blind study nimodipine could be a rational alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of AWS.", 
    "39": "Four guanidino compounds that have been found to be markedly increased in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of uremic patients, namely, guanidine, methylguanidine, creatinine, and guanidinosuccinic acid, were applied to mouse spinal cord neurons in primary dissociated cell culture to evaluate their effects on postsynaptic responses to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glycine. Intracellular microelectrode recording techniques were used. Guanidine, methylguanidine, creatine, and guanidinosuccinic acid reversibly and in a dose-dependent manner inhibited both GABA and glycine responses. Guanidinosuccinic acid was the most potent inhibitor of the amino acid responses, followed in decreasing potency by methylguanidine, guanidine, and creatinine. Guanidinosuccinic acid inhibited responses to GABA and glycine, at concentrations similar to those found in cerebrospinal fluid and brain tissue of patients with terminal renal insufficiency. The other guanidino compounds tested exerted their effects only at concentrations higher than those found in uremic biological fluids and tissues. The inhibitory effect of guanidine and methylguanidine on responses to GABA was additive. The effect of the guanidino compounds on GABA responses was not antagonized by coapplication of the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist CGS 9896. The results suggest that guanidine, methylguanidine, creatinine, and guanidinosuccinic acid inhibited responses to the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine by blocking the chloride channel. The observed action of the studied guanidino compounds might contribute to the pathogenesis of the complex neurological symptomatology encountered in uremia.", 
    "40": "In vitro studies have suggested that peripheral binding sites (PBR) for benzodiazepine (BZD) could be coupled to the voltage operated calcium channel (VOC) in the heart and that PK11195, an non-BZD ligand with antagonistic activity at this receptors, could inhibit the electrophysiological and mechanical properties of both \"peripheral\" benzodiazepines and calcium channel blockers. This study evaluates the antidotal value of PK11195 against the cardiovascular depression and arrhythmias in a canine model of acute verapamil intoxication. Although sinus activity is more often preserved or restored (7/8 vs 1/6) in the animals treated with PK11195, this compound, administered in doses able to saturate heart PBR, is unable to prevent or correct the haemodynamic alterations induced by acute verapamil intoxication and the improvement of survival (8/8 vs 3/6) is not significant.", 
    "41": "The results of the analysis of the Prolonged Treatment Cards (PTC) for 1988 are presented. The total PTC cases for which care was provided numbered 15,643, which means a 24.3% reduction in the volume of demands for medical attention, with an average decrease of 10.5 patients/day in each one of the family practices. The breakdown of the PTC into age groups revealed that it is the patients over 60 years of age who are in possession of the greatest number of these cards (58.8%). Essential hypertension (40.5%) is the most frequent diagnosis, followed by diabetes (13.8%) and osteoarthritis (13.3%). By subgroups according to treatment, the most frequently used medications are antihypertensives, with diuretics being the ones ranked in the top position (40.72%). The existing discrepancy between the high degree to which benzodiazepines are prescribed and the low percentage of cases diagnosed which can be treated using said medications is also stressed. The conclusion is drawn that the PTC's are of great use to patients and to the Primary Care Teams.", 
    "42": "In an attempt to approach the quantification of the dynamics of drug effects and the prediction of the long-term effects of drugs, a grey dynamic model was proposed and it was applied to predict the long-term effects of pirenzepine on pupils and peripheral leukocytes in dogs. The inconsiderable relative errors between the predicted and observed values suggest that the model-based equations for pupil diameter, neutrophils (%) and lymphocytes (%) which, obtained by fitting the data measured before and during initial 16 wk experiment, are acceptable for predicting the effects after 20- and 24-wk treatment with the drug.", 
    "43": "The purpose of this study was to compare the child's behavior between the two groups of oral sedative drugs: a) Chloral hydrate and Promethazine and b) Hydroxyzine and Diazepam. Fourteen healthy children, aged 3 to 5 years old, participated in this study. All children exhibited negative behavior and required at least two restorative appointments with the use of oral sedative drugs and nitrous oxide-oxygen inhalation sedation. The drugs were randomly administered in a double-blind manner. The degree of sleep, crying, movement and overall behavior were evaluated during the operative procedures. With respect to sleeping, there was no significant difference in the child's behavior between the two drug groups. With respect to crying, the children who had Hydroxyzine and Diazepam cried significantly less than when they had Chloral hydrate and Promethazine at the time of injection and rubber dam placement (P less than 0.05). With respect to movement, the children who had Hydroxyzine and Diazepam moved significantly less than when they had Chloral hydrate and Promethazine at the time of injection, rubber dam placement, and the 60 minute interval (P less than 0.05). For overall behavior, the children who had Hydroxyzine and Diazepam behaved better than when they had Chloral hydrate and Promethazine (P less than 0.05).", 
    "44": "As with 20 krad-irradiated infections in mice, the present study shows that the immunity induced by Ro11-3128 termination of unattenuated infections at the skin stage is species specific, not operating against S. japonicum. Treatment with the drug Ro15-5458, also effective at the skin stage, however, resulted in significantly lower levels of resistance than Ro11-3128. Sera from mice immunized by infection plus Ro11-3128 treatment on days 1 or 2 (Ro11S) coprecipitated essentially the same pattern of 125I-labelled surface antigens as the 20 krad vaccine serum (VMS), viz. Mr 38,000, 32,000, 23,000 and 15,000. However, recognition by Ro11S was markedly stronger. Sera from the infected and Ro15-5458-treated mice (Ro15S) failed to recognize the Mr 23,000 antigen and produced a weaker response than Ro11S or VMS against the Mr 38,000 or 32,000 antigens but a comparable response to VMS against the Mr 15,000 antigen. Ro11S and VMS also recognized the Mr 16,000 surface antigen seen by Western blotting but its recognition by Ro15S was weaker. Compared with sera from animals treated at the skin stage, sera from animals treated at the lung stage (day + 6) showed weaker recognition of the Mr 32,000 and 15,000 antigens and no recognition of the Mr 23,000 antigen. In contrast, sera from mice treated at 15 days recognized both the Mr 32,000 and 23,000 antigens but not the Mr 15,000 antigen. Mice treated at these times show progressively less immunity than at the skin stage. Infected but untreated animals only showed significant recognition of the Mr 32,000 antigen. Thus compared with infections treated with Ro11-3128 on days 1 or 2, treatment at later times or with the drug Ro15-5458 resulted in selective and differential absence or diminution of response against either the Mr 38,000, 32,000, 23,000, 16,000 or 15,000 antigens. In vitro, Ro11-3128, in contrast to Ro15-5458, caused multiple vesicle formation at the surface of skin stage schistosomula but this was progressively less pronounced with lung and liver stage worms. The vesicles were shown to express surface membrane antigens but were apparently not derived from the existing outer leaflet of the surface membrane. It is suggested that this altered antigen expression might explain the optimum immunity induced.", 
    "45": "The influence of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was investigated in ten healthy, alert volunteers. The design was a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over study. rCBF was measured by 133-Xe inhalation and single photon emission computerized tomography, SPECT, immediately before, and 5 and 35 min after intravenous injection of flumazenil 1.0 mg or placebo. In addition, mean arterial blood pressures or PaCO2, rCBF were analysed for changes in various regions of interest (RoI). No alterations were found either in the global CBF or in rCBF in RoI after flumazenil injection. The results showed that a clinically active dose of flumazenil did not directly affect the cerebral circulation in the normal brain and indicated absence of significant intrinsic activity of the drug.",

The day after anesthesia and surgery, each patient was asked to assess the degree of discomfort experienced during the procedure. In 54 of 61 patients, the end-tidal carbon dioxide monitor facilitated awake blind nasotracheal intubation. End-tidal carbon dioxide was significantly higher in patients given both fentanyl and diazepam than in those given fentanyl alone (7.4% +/- 1.4% vs 5.9% +/- 0.9%, respectively; p less than 0.05), but no patient in either group recalled the awake intubation as extremely uncomfortable.",

Anesthesia was maintained with halothane for 30 minutes. Heart rate, respiratory rate, direct arterial blood pressure, arterial blood gas, and pH measurements were made before, and at set intervals after, induction of anesthesia. Quality and characteristics of induction and recovery were evaluated objectively by an independent observer unaware of the protocol used. There were no significant differences among the three protocols from pre-induction values for arterial blood pressure, blood gas values, and pH. There was significantly greater ataxia at induction with the use of guaifenesin. The nature of induction, transition to and recovery from general anesthesia were comparable between guaifenesin and the higher dose of diazepam. Because of movements and difficulty with intubation, the lower dose of diazepam was considered unsatisfactory. It was concluded that diazepam (0.10 mg/kg) could be substituted for guaifenesin (100 mg/kg) to produce comparable quality of anesthesia in horses.", 
    "54": "More than 80 deaths have occurred after the use of midazolam (Versed), often in combination with opioids, to sedate patients undergoing various medical and surgical procedures. We investigated the respiratory effects of midazolam (0.05 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (2.0 micrograms.kg-1) in volunteers. The incidence of hypoxemia (oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 90%) and apnea (no spontaneous respiratory effort for 15 s) and the ventilatory response to carbon dioxide were evaluated. Midazolam alone produced no significant respiratory effects. Fentanyl alone produced hypoxemia in half of the subjects and significant depression of the ventilatory response to CO2, but did not produce apnea. Midazolam and fentanyl in combination significantly increased the incidence of hypoxemia (11 of 12 subjects) and apnea (6 of 12 subjects), but did not depress the ventilatory response to CO2 more than did fentanyl alone. Adverse reactions linked to midazolam and reported to the Department of Health and Human Services highlight apnea- and hypoxia-related problems as among the most frequent adverse reactions. Seventy-eight per cent of the deaths associated with midazolam were respiratory in nature, and in 57% an opioid had also been administered. All but three of the deaths associated with the use of midazolam occurred in patients unattended by anesthesia personnel. We conclude that combining midazolam with fentanyl or other opioids produces a potent drug interaction that places patients at a high risk for hypoxemia and apnea. Adequate precautions, including monitoring of patient oxygenation with pulse oximetry, the administration of supplemental oxygen, and the availability of persons skilled in airway management are recommended when benzodiazepines are administered in combination with opioids.",

    "56": "The antagonism of acetylcholine-induced contractions of guinea-pig gallbladder and ileum smooth muscle strips via various antagonists has been investigated in order to find out the muscarinic receptor subtype(s) of gallbladder smooth muscle. Atropine, pirenzepine, 4-DAMP and AF-DX 116 were used as nonselective, M1-selective, M1- and smooth muscle M3-selective and cardiac M2-selective muscarinic antagonists, respectively. All the muscarinic antagonists examined displaced the concentration-response curves to the right parallelly in a concentration-dependent manner without affecting the maximum response in both tissues. Schild analysis of data was consistent with competitive antagonism. pA2 values of the antagonists were as follows: a) gallbladder: atropine: 8.43; pirenzepine: 7.81; 4-DAMP: 8.10; AF-DX 116: 6.71; b) ileum: atropine: 9.62; pirenzepine: 6.94; 4-DAMP: 9.41; AF-DX 116: 6.55. It may be concluded that the muscarinic receptors of the guinea-pig gallbladder, which mediate acetylcholine-induced contractions, are not of the cardiac M2-subtype and may be distinguished from ileal smooth muscle M3-receptors because 4-DAMP has a 20.4 times greater affinity for ileal smooth muscle muscarinic receptors.", 
    "57": "We report the effects of flumazenil as reversion agent of the effects of diazepam at high doses as a part of short-duration general anesthesia. We have studied ten women in ASA I general condition who received anesthesia with fentanyl, 2.5 micrograms/kg-1, diazepam, 0.4 mg/kg-1 and O2/N2 at 60%. At the end of the operation, flumazenil, 0.2 mg, was administered. Hemodynamic, respiratory and adrenergic effects were evaluated. The degree of awareness and subjective feeling of the patient at awakening were also evaluated. After administration of flumazenil, awareness state was significantly higher (p less than 0.001) and it persisted during the duration of the study (120 minutes). Respiratory rate and pO2 increased significantly with administration of flumazenil (p less than 0.25 and p less than 0.01, respectively) and pCO2 decreased from 42.2 mmHg to 37.9 mmHg (p less than 0.05). Neither hemodynamic parameters nor plasma concentration of catecholamines changed significantly. As secondary effects attributable to flumazenil, four patients complained of nausea and one patient referred anxiety. We conclude that flumazenil allows to carry out anesthetic techniques with high doses of benzodiazepines even in short duration interventions with safety and without cardiocirculatory nor sympathetic-adrenal alterations.",

A satisfactory improvement was obtained with diazepam, but the complete recovery from stiffness was achieved only after chemotherapy was started.

Group A children received midazolam 0.25 mg/kg, Group B 0.35 mg/kg and Group C 0.45 mg/kg. The results from this trial show no statistical significant difference between the treatment groups as to the effect on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure, respiration, or pulse rates at either pre- or post-sedation levels.

Each subject received midazolam 0.08 mg/kg, to a maximum of 5 mg, by the SM and IM routes at two week intervals. Vital signs and arterial oxygen saturation levels were monitored every five minutes throughout the 180 minute study period.

The mean absorption rates and the mean elimination times of the two routes were not significantly different. The mean peak absorption was reached at 10 minutes by the SM route (80.4 ng/ml) and at 20 minutes (92.0 ng/ml) by the IM route, with considerable individual variability. Vital signs were stable throughout the study period in all subjects with both routes. All subjects reported pain at the injection site during SM injection which continued for up to 48 hours. No pain related to the IM injection was reported.", 
    "61": "Rats were injected intraperitoneally with loreclezole (R 72063), diazepam, or scopolamine 60 min prior to acquisition of a passive avoidance task and tested 18 h later for retention of the learned (passive) behavior. The known impairment of performance produced by diazepam in this test is believed to be a model for the clinically observed diazepam-induced anterograde amnesia in humans. We report in this study that (1) consistent with the literature, pretreatment with diazepam (2.0-16.0 mg/kg i.p.) or scopolamine (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) produced impairment in passive avoidance performance of rats (anterograde amnesia), but (2) pretreatment with loreclezole (R 72063) (2.0-80.0 mg/kg i.p.) did not impair the acquisition, retention, or the retrieval (tested 18 h later) of passive avoidance behavior by rats at any dose. The results suggest that the anticonvulsant activity of loreclezole is mediated by a mechanism distinct from the one coupled to diazepam-like disruption of cognitive functions involved in the acquisition or posttraining information processing of passive avoidance behavior.", 
    "62": "Rabbit atria were isolated with the extrinsic right vagus and sympathetic nerves intact and perfused with Tyrode solution. Noradrenaline overflow evoked by sympathetic nerve stimulation (SNS) at 3 Hz for 3 min was determined before, during, and after vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), also at 3 Hz and for 3 min. The VNS pulses preceded the SNS pulses by 3, 100 and 233 ms. Acetylcholine overflow was determined after labelling of the transmitter stores with [14C]choline. Pirenzepine 80 nmol/l failed to alter the muscarinic inhibition of noradrenaline overflow when the vago-sympathetic impulse intervals were 3 and 233 ms. At an interval of 100 ms VNS did not significantly inhibit noradrenaline overflow in the absence of pirenzepine but produced an inhibition in the presence of the drug. When the pirenzepine concentration was varied (0.4-300 nmol/l) the largest inhibition of noradrenaline overflow was observed at 5.7 nmol/l whereas 300 nmol/l fully antagonized the inhibition. Acetylcholine overflow evoked by VNS was not altered by pirenzepine 0.4-300 nmol/l. AF-DX 116 (11-[(2[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)-acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido-[2,3-b]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one), an M2 receptor selective antagonist, concentration-dependently (100-800 nmol/l) inhibited the decrease of tension development elicited by VNS. At the 100 ms vago-sympathetic impulse interval noradrenaline overflow was enhanced in the presence of AF-DX 116 400 and 800 nmol/l. However, already 100 nmol/l of the drug caused a maximum (fourfold) increase of acetylcholine overflow. It is concluded that acetylcholine released onto noradrenergic nerve fibres causes a small facilitation of noradrenaline overflow at a vago-sympathetic impulse interval of 100 ms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "64": "Intracerebroventricular administration of SMS 201-995 (5 micrograms/rat), a somatostatin analogue, induced barrel rotation in rats. Pretreatment with ceruletide (40 micrograms/100 g b. wt., IP) 3 days or 7 days prior to the injection of SMS 201-995 significantly inhibited the response rate of barrel rotation induced by SMS 201-995, but not that induced by arginine-vasopressin (1 microgram/rat, ICV). The suppressive effect of ceruletide on barrel rotation could be partially countered by MK-329, a selective peripheral CCK (CCK-A) receptor antagonist. Desulfated cerulein did not affect the barrel rotation induced by SMS 201-995. These findings suggest that ceruletide specifically suppresses the barrel rotation evoked by SMS 201-995 in a long-lasting manner possibly acting through CCK-A receptor.", 
    "65": "These experiments examined the effects of the bilateral injection of fasciculin-2 (FAS), a natural acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory peptide, into the amygdala of rats on acquisition and retention of two avoidance behaviors. Intraamygdala injection of FAS (150 ng/amygdala) produced a pronounced and long-lasting inhibition of AChE activity: 85% and 74% on day 2 and day 5, respectively. After 48 hr, FAS-treated animals showed no changes in training or test session performance in a step-down inhibitory avoidance task (training-test interval was 24 hr). In a 2-way shuttle avoidance task, intraamygdala FAS slightly reduced retention test performance without modifying training session scores. Two and five days after FAS injections into the amygdala, the density of muscarinic receptor decreased about 50% as measured by the specific bindings of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate and 3H-oxotremorine. No alterations were observed in the apparent dissociation constants. On the other hand, the central-type benzodiazepine receptor population of the amygdala remained unchanged, suggesting that FAS microinjection did not produce damage to neuronal components of these nuclei. In conclusion, the results presented have indicated that a clear-cut and long-lasting inhibition of AChE activity in the amygdala is not accompanied by a facilitation of learning and memory of two different avoidance tasks. Compensation of the increased cholinergic activity by a down-regulation of muscarinic receptors could account for these findings.", 
    "66": "Rats were given morphine as an agent of putative conditioning to establish a place preference. Doses of 4 and 8 mg/kg of morphine did establish reliable conditioned place preferences (CPP's). Other rats were given one of the doses of morphine and one of a number of antagonists in procedures designed to assess which antagonists would specifically block morphine's ability to establish a CPP indicative of positivity. Doses of naloxone and larger doses of naltrexone but not smaller ones did antagonize morphine's effects. A dose of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 did not attenuate morphine's effects. It was concluded that morphine's positivity is dependent upon actions by way of receptors sensitive to naloxone and naltrexone, but that morphine's positivity is less sensitive to naltrexone's effects than morphine's analgesia.",

The pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the new selective muscarinic M1-antagonist telenzepine (BY 803; CAS 80880-90-6) were studied in 10 patients with compensated liver cirrhosis who were treated over 4 weeks with 3 mg at night. 3 mg telenzepine was well tolerated. There was no deterioration of laboratory parameters during the 4 weeks treatment course. Following a single oral dose of 3 mg telenzepine the mean maximal plasma level (cmax) averaged 5.7 (1.9-10.1) ng/ml. After repeated dosing 3 patients displayed different kinetic behaviour resulting in higher values of AUC on day 14/15 in comparison to day 1/2. tmax and cmax remained unchanged. It can be concluded that even in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis no significant accumulation of the compound will occur.", 
    "69": "It is known that some derivatives of the benzodiazepine group act not only as antipsychotic drugs but also have inhibitory effects on the growth of protozoa. The influence of imipramine and its derivatives clomipramine and desipramine on the multiplication of Crithidia luciliae, Leishmania mexicana amazonensis, Trypanosoma cruzi and Trichomonas vaginalis was investigated using in vitro cultivation of the parasites and compared with the effects of chlorpromazine and metronidazole. All trypanosomatides used were inhibited by imipramine and its derivatives with clomipramine having the strongest influence on the growth of parasites (ID50 12.5-35 micrograms/ml). The Trichomonas vaginalis strain used was susceptible to metronidazole but it was nearly resistant to the tricyclic compounds tested (ID50 greater than 100 micrograms/ml).", 
    "70": "The summary levels of diazepam and its metabolites in the mouse serum, brain and liver tissues were determined by the radioreceptor assay after single intraperitoneal administration of seduxen in a dose of 4 mg/kg. The results showed synchronism of changes of the concentrations in the brain and liver and in the serum. The correlation coefficients between the brain or liver concentrations and the serum one were 0.82 and 0.91, respectively. The second peak of the tissue concentrations of diazepam active forms and the local minimum at this time in the serum were observed 2.5 hours after the drug administration. The results obtained may be considered as the experimental basis of using the blood diazepam active form concentrations measured by RRA for the therapeutic control of diazepam application in the clinic.", 
    "71": "A multicentric study has been conducted with a new prazepam formulation (drop) which has been compared with 10 mg tablets. The aim of the study was to check the clinical equivalence of the two formulations. Nine generalists and 9 psychiatrists participated in this double blind study. One hundred fifty four patients with DSM III generalized anxiety criteria were included in this study and received prazepam at an average dosage of 20 mg per day. There were 11 drop outs: 6 in the tablet group and 5 in the drop group. The statistical analysis was done on 143 patients. Before treatment the two groups were equivalent. There was a very significant decrease (p less than 10(-4) in Hamilton anxiety scale scores, physician visual analogic scale and patient visual analogic scale with no difference between both groups. The vigilance, measured by the Mini-Folstein scale, was significantly increased (p less than 10(-4) in both groups. The tolerance was also similar: 14 patients in the tablet group and 10 in the drop one complained of asthenia and somnolence.", 
    "72": "In a study to assess the efficacy of and safety of vacuum aspiration syringe in the management of incomplete abortion 300 patients with non septic abortion were evacuated by the method in the ward. A control group 285 patients was evacuated in theatre by sharp currettage. All patients were followed up for 21 days. 54.7% of the study patients were evacuated without any need for analgesia while all the control patients were given intravenous pethidine and valium. 2.3% of vacuum aspiration and 3.5% of control patients needed revacuation (p greater than 0.05). 70.3% of vacuum aspiration cases were dry by day 7 compared to 64.6% of the control group (p greater than 0.05). Immediate complications of nausea and vomiting were seen in 5.3% study patients (p less than 0.001). There was one uterine perforation in the control group. 5.4% of study and 6.0 of control patients developed mild to severe sepsis (p greater than 0.05). Vacuum aspiration is a safe, simple and quick method of treating incomplete abortion. Its wider use in developing countries is highly recommended.", 
    "73": "The effect of pirenzepine (50 mg p.o.) vs placebo on the fasted gallbladder emptying after a test meal was examined in a double-blind study on 14 healthy male volunteers by means of an ultrasonographic method. Pirenzepine inhibited significantly the meal-induced gallbladder emptying, whereas no significant effect of this drug on the fasted gallbladder volume was observed.", 
    "74": "The purpose of this article is to review the risks of pharmacological treatments of anxiety, mainly those due to benzodiazepines. Many mildly anxious patients do not need pharmacotherapy and psychological support is always an important component of treatment. The risks of benzodiazepine treatment increase with the doses used and the length of treatment, especially the risk of dependence. However, people who abuse benzodiazepines are a minority. Usually they also abuse alcohol and other drugs, probably reflecting underlying personality disorders. There are several alternative pharmacological treatments for anxiety. Tricyclics and MAO inhibitors are effective in panic disorders. Buspirone is useful in generalized anxiety disorder and in patients who are prone to substance abuse. All these alternative treatments may have disadvantages that need to be considered.", 
    "75": "The relative role of beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism in the management of anxiety symptoms is not clear. We studied the effect of ICI 118,551, a selective beta 2-antagonist, in 51 patients presenting with acute anxiety symptoms and fulfilling DSM-III criteria for anxiety disorder. All patients received placebo during the first week of treatment followed by thrice daily diazepam (2 mg) or ICI 118,551 (50 mg) or placebo for 4 weeks with double-blind, random allocation. Hamilton anxiety scale scores improved on all treatments but there was no significant difference between treatments. Beta 2-adrenoceptor antagonism does not appear to be effective in acute anxiety neurosis. Some earlier literature suggests that beta 1-antagonism may be more important.", 
    "76": "The actions of the 5-HT1A receptor ligands, MDL 73005EF and 8-OH-DPAT, were assessed in mice. They were confronted with a free exploratory test especially adapted to reveal sedation, and with a two-box light/dark choice situation validated for the detection of anti-anxiety agents. Both drugs were found to have sedative properties at high doses and anxiolytic-like effects at lower doses. The results show that both drugs have a comparable profile of action to that of benzodiazepines in the two-box light/dark procedure. These findings are in line with earlier reports describing anxiolytic effects of 5-HT1A receptor ligands in different animal models of anxiety.", 
    "77": "The object of this investigation was to study the effect of a benzodiazepine upon the cycle wakefulness-sleep. Wistar rats received 0.9 mg/kg of the chlorate derivative of beta lactam 1.5 benzodiazepine intraperitoneally and the action was analyzed by means of continuous polygraphic registers for ten hours long. Results indicate that this substance decreases wakefulness and slightly increases slow wave sleep. Paradoxical sleep increases significantly (p less than 0.05). Latency of the first phase of paradoxical sleep decreases considerably. These effects suggest that this compound favors sleep under present experimental conditions.", 
    "78": "The elimination of the extreme fear reported by dental phobic patients traditionally involves psychologic interventions such as systematic desensitization. Observations resulting from a conscious sedation approach, as outlined in two case histories, suggest that a desensitization phenomena is occurring. This pharmacologic desensitization appears to mimic elements of systematic desensitization. Optimal management of fearful patients may sometimes require conjunctive support from both dental behavioral scientists and dental anesthesiologists.", 
    "79": "The mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine antagonism of opioid antinociception were studied using the tail flick test and the hot plate test in mice. Both single-dose and repeated diazepam treatment antagonized the antinociceptive effect of morphine. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil completely reversed the antagonism between diazepam and morphine. Mid-thoracic spinalization also abolished the antagonism, indicating that the antagonism takes place at higher levels in the CNS. Neither diazepam nor midazolam showed any affinity for opioid mu or kappa receptors in membranes prepared from mouse forebrain. Taken together with the results of other studies of interactions between GABAergic drugs and opioids, the results indicate that a benzodiazepine receptor-mediated mechanism at higher levels in the CNS, possibly in the brainstem, blocks the effect of opioids on nociceptive transmission.", 
    "80": "Previous studies have shown that rats' positive, palatability-dependent consummatory reactions to infused tastes are selectively facilitated by a benzodiazepine agonist (chlordiazepoxide), and that this effect can be blocked by the coadministration of benzodiazepine antagonists (e.g., Ro 15-1788). The purpose of the present study was to determine whether agents acting at other receptor sites (dopaminergic, serotonergic), which have been shown to modulate food consumption, might also modify rats' palatability-dependent reactivity to infused tastes. In this experiment, the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, facilitated positive palatability reactions, while dopaminergic agents (haloperidol, apomorphine, amphetamine) had no significant effects on either positive or aversive reactions. The putative 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone and gepirone, had a general inhibitory action on both positive and aversive palatability reactions. These results are surprising in view of the effects of serotonergic and dopaminergic agents on food and fluid intake. Our results suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor system may play a special role in the neural control of appetite through its enhancement of the positive palatability of tastes. Dopamine systems, by contrast, appear to control food intake by modulating processes that are independent of food affect evaluation.", 
    "81": "The low doses of neuroleptics restored the ability of 1-DOPA treated rats to escape behaviour from acute stress situation (in the extrapolation escape test). Non-antipsychotic benzamides and phenothiazine, antidepressants and benzodiazepine tranquilizers were inactive. On the whole, the effectiveness of neuroleptics was in accordance with clinical data. The loss of ability to escape in 1-DOPA treated rats was accompanied by stereotypes hyperlocomotion in the water. Various psychotropic drugs decreased only hyperactivity without the influence on escape behaviour. Both forms of behavioral pathology were prevented by central aromatic acid decarboxylase inhibitor. However, the loss of ability to escape behavior only is selective and sensitive to neuroleptics action.", 
    "82": "The pharmacokinetics of a single iv dose of 10 mg diazepam and the renal excretion of its metabolites resulting from N-demethylation and C-3-hydroxylation were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers when diazepam was administered alone and on day 3 of administration of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice per day). No significant changes in the diazepam half-life, its volume of distribution, the total body clearance, or the renal clearance were observed. In addition, the renal excretion of the metabolites desmethyldiazepam, 3-hydroxydiazepam (temazepam), and 3-hydroxydesmethyldiazepam (oxazepam) were not altered by ciprofloxacin co-medication. These data demonstrate that in a 500 mg twice per day oral dosage, ciprofloxacin does not influence the metabolic clearance of diazepam in young healthy volunteers.", 
    "83": "Since absorption rates, volumes of distribution and elimination rates differ greatly among the benzodiazepine derivatives, each benzodiazepine has a unique plasma concentration curve. Although the time to peak plasma levels provides a rough guide, it is not equivalent to the time to clinical onset of effect. Two half-lives can be described: the alpha half-life, the rate of decline in plasma concentrations due to the process of drug redistribution from the central to the peripheral compartment, and the beta half-life, the rate of decline due to the process of drug elimination due to metabolism. The frequent classification of benzodiazepines into long, intermediate, and short-\"acting\" categories based on their terminal beta half-lives is unfounded; the duration of action is much more dependent on the alpha half-life. Benzodiazepines with short beta half-lives are commonly thought to be preferable because they accumulate less. However, with repeated use, sedation and cognitive neuromotor impairment usually diminish progressively despite stable or even rising benzodiazepine plasma concentrations, whereas anxiolytic effects generally persist over time.", 
    "84": "We studied 12 normal subjects who underwent four 99Tcm-HIDA examinations. Imaging was performed with 111 MBq at 1 image/min for 60 min, and was registered on a computer on a 64 x 64 word matrix. Normalized and background corrected time-activity curves on the gallbladder were obtained from which total and cumulative 10 min interval emptying was calculated. During the first examination (control), 10 min after the beginning of acquisition, 1 ml saline solution was injected subcutaneously. The second examination was performed injecting 5 mg bethanechol subcutaneously instead of saline solution. During the third and fourth examinations 10 mg pirenzepine and 0.15 mg/10 kg atropine were injected i.v. respectively, 5 min before bethanechol injection. Wilcoxon's test was used to compare the first and second studies and the latter with the third and fourth studies. The median value of gallbladder emptying at 60 min was 2% with saline solution injection and 27.5% with bethanechol. This difference was significant from minute 30 onwards. Atropine administration inhibited gallbladder emptying completely in all cases, with significant differences (P less than 0.01) in relation to bethanechol values following the first 30 min of the examination. Gallbladder emptying was observed in the study with pirenzepine, but was significantly inferior to the bethanechol values after the first 30 min.", 
    "85": "1. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled sleep laboratory study single doses of suriclone, a new non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic binding to benzodiazepine receptors, were investigated with respect to sleep and awakening. 2. Sixteen healthy young volunteers spent 10 nights in the sleep laboratory: 1 adaptation night, 1 baseline night and 4 drug nights (placebo; 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg suriclone; 2 mg lorazepam as reference drug) and 4 subsequent wash-out nights (drug-interval: 1 week). Somnopolygraphic investigations (22.30 h to 06.00 h) were commenced 0.5 h after drug-intake. A self-rating scale for sleep and awakening quality as well as psychometric tests were completed in the morning. 3. Hypnotic effects were most pronounced after lorazepam in regard to total sleep time and sleep efficiency. After lorazepam as well as after 0.4 mg suriclone nocturnal awakenings decreased significantly as compared with placebo, which was reflected in an improved subjective sleep quality after both dosages. Suriclone 0.2 mg did not induce any alterations in all night sleep. 4. In the morning, well-being, drowsiness and reaction time performance deteriorated after lorazepam as compared with placebo but not after suriclone. The latter was significantly superior to lorazepam with respect to subjective awakening quality, well-being, emotional rapport, drowsiness and attention. 5. Blood pressure and pulse remained unchanged after all of the drugs. Critical flicker frequency and muscle strength decreased only after lorazepam as compared with placebo.", 
    "86": "The critically ill patient is at increased risk for developing erosive injury of the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus. To date, the most effective way to prevent and treat this problem is by assuring excellent intensive care support and by reducing gastric acid secretion. The histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in both prevention and treatment of such gastric mucosal injury. Newer agents are available that have potential for use in this setting, although none have been studied as extensively in critically ill patients as have the H2RAs. These new agents include proglumide, pirenzepine, misoprostol, omeprazole, and somatostatin. To date, only the latter has been extensively studied in critically ill patients. Omeprazole, which suppresses acid very effectively, may be problematic in the critically ill, limited by its oral dosage form, acid-labile properties, and potential drug interactions.", 
    "87": "Benzodiazepines in clinical use have a range of pharmacological activities. Some, e.g. sedation, tolerance and addiction, are not welcome. Undesirable side-effects of drugs are often controlled by developing compounds that bind more selectively to one particular receptor subtype. An alternative approach, discussed here by Willy Haefely and colleagues, is the development of partial agonists which exploit regional differences in receptor reserve to tease apart biological responses. Partial agonists for the benzodiazepine modulatory site on the GABAA complex have been developed and their pharmacological profiles can be interpreted to suggest that neurons mediating anticonvulsant and anti-anxiety effects do indeed have a higher receptor reserve than neurons mediating other unwanted effects. This suggests that benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists may have important therapeutic potential.", 
    "88": "The ability of graded doses of flumazenil (2, 6, 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg) and a lactose placebo to precipitate abstinence was studied in dogs treated chronically with diazepam, nordiazepam, flunitrazepam, alprazolam, oxazepam, halazepam and lorazepam by oral dosing. A scale comprised of 10 precipitated abstinence signs, the Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale, was developed, which yielded linear flumazenil log-dose response lines with significant slopes in dogs dependent on diazepam, nordiazepam and flunitrazepam. The effects of 18, 36 and 72 mg/kg of flumazenil in otherwise drug naive dogs were studied. In naive dogs, the most prominent effect of flumazenil was to reduce activity. All benzodiazepines studied produced dependence that was characterized by signs of precipitated abstinence; however, the intensity and quality of abstinence varied from one benzodiazepine to another. Precipitated abstinence in dogs treated chronically with diazepam and flunitrazepam was characterized by a dose-related increase in clonic convulsions and Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. This pattern differed from that seen in nordiazepam- and alprazolam-dependent dogs, which showed a comparable flumazenil dose-related increase in clonic convulsion but only a modest increase in Benzodiazepine Precipitated Abstinence Scale scores. Oxazepam and lorazepam produced dependence that was less intense than that seen with the other benzodiazepines. Plasma levels of the benzodiazepines and their metabolites were repeatedly determined after single doses and during addiction cycles. Nordiazepam accumulated in diazepam- and nordiazepam-dependent dogs and alpha-OH alprazolam accumulated in alprazolam-dependent dogs. Other drugs and metabolites did not. These observations suggest that: 1) different benzodiazepines or their metabolites produce different types of physical dependence, suggesting that they or their metabolites have different mechanisms and sites of action; 2) plasma cumulation of the benzodiazepines or their active metabolites is an important factor in the genesis of physical dependence; and 3) metabolism of benzodiazepines plays an important role in their dependence-producing capacity, and because of differences in the way species metabolize benzodiazepines, the type of dependence produced in different species may differ.", 
    "89": "Abecarnil (ZK 112119; isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), a novel beta-carboline with high affinity for central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, has been shown recently to be a potent anxiolytic and anticonvulsant in animal models whereas lacking ataxia-producing effects, a profile typical for a partial agonist at BZ receptors. In the present study abecarnil was tested in dogs after acute and chronic administration. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that abecarnil was eliminated rapidly after i.v. or p.o. administration, but elimination was delayed substantially after s.c. injection. After i.v. injection, the drug penetrated rapidly into the cerebrospinal fluid, but maximum concentrations reached in cerebrospinal fluid were only 6 to 8% of those in plasma. Anticonvulsant potency of abecarnil in dogs was studied by means of seizures induced by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol. After i.v. administration of single doses, abecarnil was about half as potent as diazepam, dose-dependently increasing the pentylenetetrazol threshold by doses of 0.1-1 mg/kg. In contrast to diazepam, most dogs injected with abecarnil at anticonvulsant doses showed no ataxia. During chronic s.c. administration of abecarnil for 6 weeks, the anticonvulsant efficacy of the drug increased markedly during the first week(s) of treatment, possibly indicating drug accumulation in the brain. During the subsequent weeks of treatment, there was a slight reduction in anticonvulsant potency. No withdrawal symptoms were observed after cessation of the 6-week administration period. Furthermore, injection of the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil), 1 mg/kg i.v., after 5 weeks of treatment did not precipitate withdrawal symptoms except slight tremor in two of seven dogs studied.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "90": "We reported previously that benzodiazepines, widely prescribed for their anxiolytic properties, bind to specific receptors on macrophages and modulate in vitro their metabolic oxidative responsiveness. This study was designed to investigate the in vivo effects of benzodiazepine molecules on several macrophage functions. Benzodiazepines injected i.p. exerted a long-lasting inhibition on phagocyte oxidative responsiveness, still detectable 48 hr after injection. This action was dose-dependent, optimally effective at 1 mg/kg and observed at the site of injection within peritoneal cells as well as at a distance, within splenocytes. It was restricted to peripheral and mixed-type molecules whereas the central-type compound, clonazepam, was ineffective, in good keeping with the molecular specificity of the receptor present on murine macrophages. The fact that benzodiazepines exerted similar effects in Nude mice highly suggests that their in vivo inhibitory activity was not T cell-dependent. The peripheral benzodiazepine Ro5-4864 injected i.p. inhibited the capacity of macrophages to produce interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-6. Clonazepam remained ineffective. These results demonstrate an in vivo immunosuppressive property of peripheral and mixed but not central -type benzodiazepines affecting characteristic phagocyte functions involved in host-defense mechanisms as well as in inflammatory response.", 
    "91": "In the course of studies on tranquilizers, new non-benzodiazepine-like compounds were synthesized. These are 1-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenoxy)-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]prop an-2-ol (INN: enciprazine) and derivatives thereof which were screened pharmacologically in order to evaluate their central nervous system activity. Compounds with marked antiaggressive and anxiolytic properties but without dependence potential could be detected. Enciprazine was selected for clinical investigations."
