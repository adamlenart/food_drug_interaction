    "1": "Conduct disorders are the most frequent psychiatric diagnosis in the pediatric and adolescent population, with different etiology and difficult to treat. Delinquent, aggressive, and impulsive behavior, lack of empathy and inability to predict possible consequences of the behavior lead to significant desadaptation and danger for these patients. In clinical practice, focus is usually given on social and psychological causes of conduct disorders ignoring possible biological factors in etiology and pathophysiology. A clinical case described in this article shows the linkage between frontal brain dysfunction and behavioral symptoms. The first clues of organic brain disorder were multiple and severe symptoms of disinhibition resistant to treatment with dopaminergic drugs and the results of neuropsychological testing. Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imagining, and single-photon emission computed tomography findings were minor and not supported by associated neurological symptoms. However, the location of alterations of brain structure and perfusion significantly correlated with psychopathology. Clarification of the organic cause of the conduct disorder allowed choosing an effective strategy of psychopharmacologic treatment. A positive clinical effect was achieved after switching the treatment from dopaminergic antipsychotic drugs to carbamazepine, which modulates the GABAergic system. Presenting this clinical case, we intended to emphasize the importance of careful attention to the findings of neurovisual and neuropsychological testing diagnosing conduct disorders and individually choosing the most effective psychopharmacologic treatment.",

Neither of the most widely used classes of antidepressants, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, have particularly beneficial effects on sleep and, among the medications that reliably improve sleep efficiency, including mirtazapine and the tricyclic antidepressants, problems with daytime sedation can offset therapeutic benefit. Despite relatively widespread use, trazodone has not been demonstrated to be an effective and safe hypnotic in patients taking other antidepressants. For many patients, ongoing concomitant treatment with benzodiazepines and related drugs is the preferred option, again without convincing empirical support of longer-term efficacy. Among newer and investigational antidepressants, agomelatine shows promise with respect to both overall safety and effects on insomnia, although possible negative effects on liver function warrant further study.",

    "15": "Sulpiride is a benzamide neuroleptic used in the treatment of some psychiatric and gastroenterological disorders. Its antipsychotic, antiautistic, activizing and antidepressive properties result from antagonistic action to dopaminergic D2, D3 and D4 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS). The oral bioavailability of sulpiride is poor and it does not appear to have an extensive first-pass metabolism, nor is it extensively protein-bound. Elimination of sulpiride appears to depend primarily on the kidneys. The acute sulpiride poisoning includes mainly neuropsychiatric (i.e., agitation, hallucinations, and CNS depression) as well as cardiac effects (i.e., hypotension, dysrhythmias, and sinus tachycardia). The life-threatening conditions with sometimes fatal outcome after sulpiride poisoning are prolongation of QTc interval with consequent torsade de pointes (TdP) and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The quantitative methods for the measurement of sulpiride blood concentration are not routinely available and the toxic blood concentration is probably higher than 2 mg/L. Treatment of acute sulpiride poisoning includes standard protocols of gastrointestinal decontamination and further symptomatic and supportive measures, among them TdP (magnesium sulphate, isoproterenol, electrotherapy) and NMS treatment (benzodiazepines, bromocriptine, dantrolene, physical cooling).",

The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics battery and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were used to assess selective cognitive functions at baseline and endpoint (6 weeks). Clinical assessment was also performed. No between-group differences were found in neurocognitive tests, suggesting that reboxetine did not significantly change patients' cognitive performance compared to placebo. Reboxetine was well-tolerated and did not interfere with the therapeutic effect of olanzapine.

    "32": "The effects of EEHb were demonstrated by the open field, elevated-plus-maze, forced swimming, pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, PTZ-induced seizure, and inhibitory avoidance tests. EEHb did not show a protective effect against PTZ-induced convulsions. In the plus-maze test, EEHb (100mg/kg, i.p.) exhibited an anxiolytic effect through the effective enhancement of the frequency and time spent in the open arms of the maze. Conversely, the time spent and the number of entrances to the closed arms were decreased. All these effects were also completely reversed by pre-treatment with flumazenil (2.5mg/kg, i.p./a benzodiazepine receptor agonist), similar to the results observed with diazepam used as a positive standard. In this test, the anxiolytic effect of EEHb was also totally blocked by pre-treatment with reserpine (2.0mg/kg, i.p.), a drug known to induce depletion of biogenic amines. In the forced swimming test, the treatment of EEHb (100mg/kg, i.p. or 100mg/kg, p.o.) given in acute and chronic form (10, 50 and 100mg/kg), produced a decrease in immobility time, similar to that of imipramine (10mg/kg, i.p.), the positive control. The dichloromethane and hexane fractions (100mg/kg, p.o.) also produced a decrease in immobility time. In addition, the two isolated compounds tested in a single dose (10mg/kg, i.p.), the antidepressant effect was observed only with the compound podoandin, which also caused a decrease in immobility time.

Therefore, better identification and management of insomnia is required for this patient population. The etiology and magnitude of insomnia due to changes in circadian rhythms, comorbid conditions, and pharmaceutical agents are not well documented, and the utilization of over-the-counter and non-Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agents to induce sleep (including antihistamines and ethyl alcohol) have not been studied in a natural setting. Evaluating the actual type of insomnia remains much more art than science for the majority of patients and providers. Another issue to consider in this population involves the relationship between patient and physician and the traditional passive patient role. Nonpharmacologic approaches (ie, cognitive behavioral therapy) for insomnia management are effective and usually are first-line therapy. However, the challenges to implementing these approaches may limit their use, thus necessitating pharmacologic therapy. There are currently 3 FDA-approved drug classes for the treatment of insomnia: benzodiazepines, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin receptor agonists. Although all agents in these classes are efficacious, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are associated with adverse events that must be considered when treating insomnia in the elderly. Melatonin agonists have a mechanism of action that regulates normal sleep-wake cycles and readjusts circadian rhythms, which may confer a better safety profile than traditional sedative-hypnotics that target gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. Because the 3 currently approved drug classes for insomnia have similar efficacy, safety considerations should be of paramount importance for the elderly patient; however, additional data are needed to appropriately assess the risk-benefit ratios of each.", 
    "35": "Panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder with recurrent, debilitating panic attacks. In individuals with panic disorder there is evidence of decreased central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activity as well as marked increases in autonomic and respiratory responses after intravenous infusions of hypertonic sodium lactate. In a rat model of panic disorder, chronic inhibition of GABA synthesis in the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus of rats produces anxiety-like states and a similar vulnerability to sodium lactate-induced cardioexcitatory responses. The dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus is enriched in neurons containing orexin (ORX, also known as hypocretin), which have a crucial role in arousal, vigilance and central autonomic mobilization, all of which are key components of panic. Here we show that activation of ORX-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model, and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding ORX (Hcrt) with RNAi or systemic ORX-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses. Moreover, we show that human subjects with panic anxiety have elevated levels of ORX in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to subjects without panic anxiety. Taken together, our results suggest that the ORX system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that ORX antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder.", 
    "36": "The three hydroxybenzodiazepines oxazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam used for their anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant properties are metabolized by glucuronidation, which is the predominant pathway in the clearance mechanism of exogenous and endogenous substances during phase II metabolism. The aim of this study was the synthesis of benzodiazepine-O-glucuronides as analytical reference substances. All benzodiazepines are prescribed clinically as racemic formulations. The resulting conjugates from the coupling reactions with glucuronic acid are epimeric pairs of glucuronides. Due to the importance of stereochemical factors in drug disposition it is necessary to separate the diastereomeric forms after synthesis. An enzyme-assisted synthesis was developed and optimized by using microsomal UGT from fresh swine liver to receive multimilligram amounts of the benzodiazepine glucuronides, which were not accessible by standard synthetic procedures, like the Koenigs-Knorr- and Williamson-ether-synthesis. Swine liver microsomes were prepared by homogenization and differential centrifugation of liver tissue. In the presence of liver microsomes the benzodiazepines and cofactor UDPGA were incubated for 24h. After incubation the microsomes were removed by protein precipitation and the residual benzodiazepines by liquid-liquid extraction (dichloromethane). The epimeric pairs of benzodiazepine glucuronides were separated by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) followed by solid phase extraction (SPE) to obtain the pure benzodiazepine glucuronide epimers. The synthesis products were characterized by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.", 
    "37": "This study compared the potencies of epidurally delivered muscimol, lidocaine, midazolam, pentobarbital and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to prevent focal neocortical seizures induced by locally applied acetylcholine (Ach), in rats (n=5). An epidural cup was chronically implanted over the right somatosensory cortex in each animal, with epidural EEG electrodes placed posterior to the edge of the cup. After recovery, either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF; control solution) or one of the five drugs was delivered into epidural cup, followed by Ach administration into the cup to induce seizures. EEG seizure duration ratio was calculated for each drug delivery/seizure induction session to determine the potency of ACSF and the drugs to prevent the focal Ach-seizures. The concentration of all examined drug solutions was 1.0mM. ACSF, lidocaine, midazolam, pentobarbital and GABA all failed to prevent the Ach-induced neocortical EEG seizures, yielding EEG seizure duration ratios ranging from 0.41 to 0.80. In contrast, muscimol pretreatment fully prevented the development of ictal EEG in all animals. These results suggest that when used at low concentration muscimol was the best of the five drugs for transmeningeal pharmacotherapy trials for focal neocortical epilepsy.",

Acceptance of drug mixture and onset of action were monitored over the next 30 min. Induction of anaesthesia was carried out using sevoflurane 8 vol% in 100% oxygen via face mask. Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.5-2 vol% in oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture. Following extubation, standard scoring scale was used for assessing quality of emergence. Agitation parameters were measured using a five-point scale. Agitated children were managed by giving intravenous increments of fentanyl 1 microg kg(-1).

These compounds 4a-f and 5a-f were prepared in good yields by linking C-8 of DC-81 with quinazolinone moiety through different alkane spacers. These conjugates were tested for anticancer activity against 11 human cancer cell lines and found to be very potent anticancer agents with GI(50) values in the range of <0.1-26.2microM. Among all the PBD conjugates, one of the conjugate 5c was tested against a panel of 60 human cancer cells. This compound showed activity for individual cancer cell lines with GI(50) values of <0.1microM. The thermal denaturation studies exhibited effective DNA binding ability compared to DC-81 and these results are further supported by molecular modeling studies. The detailed biological aspects of these conjugates on A375 cell line were studied. It was observed that compounds 4b and 5c induced the release of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, cleavage of PARP and subsequent cell death. Further, these compounds when treated with A375 cells showed the characteristic features of apoptosis like enhancement in the levels of p53, p21 and p27 inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) and suppression of NF-kappaB. Moreover, these two compounds 4b and 5c control the cell proliferation by regulating anti-apoptotic genes like (B-cell lymphoma 2) Bcl-2. Therefore, the data generated suggests that these PBD conjugates activate p53 and inhibit NF-kappaB and thereby these compounds could be promising anticancer agents with better therapeutic potential for the suppression of tumours.",

As expected, the presence of dementia and adverse drug effects had the strongest associations with dementia-associated and drug-induced delirium, respectively, in the cohort hospitalizations.", 
    "57": "Drug-induced delirium and NDND delirium had the strongest associations with lower extremity orthopaedic surgery hospitalizations and urinary tract/kidney infection hospitalizations, respectively. Among the NDND co-morbid conditions, volume depletion and sodium imbalance had the strongest, albeit modest, associations with delirium. The association between decade of age and delirium was strongest for NDND delirium (adjusted odds ratio 1.53; 95% CI 1.52, 1.53), but age had significant associations with drug-induced and dementia-associated delirium as well. In the cohort, the most frequent adverse effects codes were for opioids and for benzodiazepines or other sedatives, which were noted in 21.3% and 15.2% of drug-induced delirium hospitalizations, respectively. Drug-induced delirium is being increasingly identified in hospitalized patients. Administrative hospitalization databases constitute a resource to explore factors and trends associated with delirium. The findings suggest that interventions focusing on adverse drug effects have the greatest potential for preventing delirium.",

The median age of patients was 80 years (interquartile range: 75-84 years); 65.1% were women. The most represented ADRs were those responsible for CNS disorders (17.0%), gastrointestinal disorders (16.2%) and cardiac rhythm disorders (11.2%). Factors associated with an increased risk of SADRs were: age (odds ratio [OR] 1.92; 95% CI 1.22, 3.02 for subjects aged 85 years and over), use of atypical antipsychotics (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.04, 4.46), use of conventional antipsychotics (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.10, 3.85), use of antihypertensive drugs (OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.47, 3.02) and use of drugs targeting the alimentary tract and metabolism (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.06, 2.46). The use of benzodiazepines (long-acting or others), antidepressants (tricyclic or others) or antiarrhythmic drugs was not associated with the reporting of SADRs.",

It was not associated with the use of other psychotropic drugs, other non-psychotropic CNS drugs or with the use of antiarrhythmic agents. The association with drugs targeting the alimentary tract and metabolism could result from a protopathic bias or reflect the particular sensitivity to serious nausea and vomiting in patients already treated for gastrointestinal disorders. These results confirm that attention needs to be paid to patients receiving both cholinesterase inhibitors and antipsychotics.", 
    "63": "Microglia in the brain are no longer quiescent but active by extending their dendrite and villi to their vicinity, so that microglia play roles in immune surveillance in a similar way as macrophages in the periphery. Changing their shapes from ramified to ameboid forms is a sign of neuroinflammation triggered by damaged neurons or astrocytes. This microgliosis is caused not only by direct brain injury or vascular damage but neurodegeneration, the latter of which was first shown in Alzheimer's disease in vivo by PET with widely-used peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) tracer [11C] (R)-PK11195. The number of the PRB is reportedly increased on the surface of mitochondrial adventitia of the activated microglia, but the affinity to the tracer is shown stable. Using this tracer is advantageous to depict the level of neuroinflammation in vivo in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the weak point of the tracer is no capacity to differentiate protective microglia from proinflammatory ones. So, a new tracer with its segregation capacity would be expected to come in the near future. This talk is going to cover the application of the PBR tracer to image the neuroinflammation in vivo in neurological and psychiatric diseases.",

In period 1, subjects received a single oral dose of midazolam 7.5 mg on day 1. In period 2, subjects received 30 mg, 4-hour infusions of rolofylline (intended clinical dose and duration) once daily for 4 consecutive days; midazolam 7.5 mg was coadministered on day 4. The geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals for AUC0-infinity and Cmax of midazolam in the presence/absence of rolofylline were 1.20 (1.12-1.29) and 1.17 (1.03-1.32), respectively.

For all reports, cases were defined as those reports corresponding to \"drug abuse,\" \"physical or mental drug dependence,\" and \"pharmacodependence,\" whereas \"non-cases\" were defined as all the remaining SED reports. The method's reliability was assessed by calculating the risk associated with a negative (amoxicillin) and a positive (benzodiazepines) control. The risk of dependence associated with each drug and control was evaluated by calculating the odds ratio (OR) with a confidence interval of 95%.",

The risk of dependence was similar for triptans and ergot derivatives and did not differ from that of benzodiazepines. In the triptan group, the risk (odds ratio [95% CI]) ranged from 10.3 [4.8-22.3] for sumatriptan to 21.5 for eletriptan [10.1-45.6], while in the ergot derivative group, it ranged from 12 [8-17.9] for ergotamine to 20.6 [8-53] for dihydroergotamine.",

The original study was conducted from November 2003 to August 2004. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in a set of 19 candidate genes corresponding to known sites of activity for olanzapine and fluoxetine or previously associated with antidepressant or antipsychotic response.

    "90": "Many dopamine antagonists are proven acute migraine treatments. Genetic studies also imply that polymorphisms in dopamine genes (DRD2 receptors) in persons with migraine may create dopamine hypersensitivity. However, treatment is limited by the adverse event profiles of conventional neuroleptics including extrapyramidal symptoms, anticholinergic and antihistaminergic effects, hyperprolactinemia, and prolonged cardiac QT interval. Atypical neuroleptics cause less extrapyramial symptoms and some atypical neuroleptics, including olanzapine and quetiapine, may be beneficial as both acute and preventive migraine treatment. The combination of prochlorperazine, indomethacin, and caffeine is effective in the treatment of the acute migraine attack. The mechanism of action by which neuroleptics relieve headache is probably related to dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. Other actions via serotonin (5HT) receptor antagonists may also be important, particularly for migraine prevention. Additional studies to clarify the mechanism of action of neuroleptics in migraine could lead to new drugs and better management of migraine.", 
    "91": "Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), a member of the serine/threonine kinase family, is an attractive therapeutic target for anticancer combination therapy. A structure-based modeling approach complemented with shape components was pursued to develop a reliable pharmacophore model for ATP-competitive Chk1 inhibitors. Common chemical features of the pharmacophore model were derived by clustering multiple structure-based pharmacophore features from different Chk1-ligand complexes in comparable binding modes. The final model consisted of one hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA), one hydrogen bond donor (HBD), two hydrophobic (HY) features, several excluded volumes and shape constraints. In the validation study, this feature-shape query yielded an enrichment factor of 9.196 and performed fairly well at distinguishing active from inactive compounds, suggesting that the pharmacophore model can serve as a reliable tool for virtual screening to facilitate the discovery of novel Chk1 inhibitors. Besides, these pharmacophore features were assumed to be essential for Chk1 inhibitors, which might be useful for the identification of potential Chk1 inhibitors.",

TSPO expression in glial cells increases in response to cytokines and pathological stimuli. Accordingly, [(11)C]-PK 11195 and [(11)C]-DAA1106 are recognized molecular imaging (MI) agents capable of monitoring changes in TSPO expression occurring in vivo and in response to various neuropathologies.Here we tested the pharmacological characteristics and TSPO-monitoring potential of two novel MI agents: NIR-conPK and NIR-6T. NIR-conPK is an analogue of PK 11195 conjugated to the near-infrared (NIR) emitting fluorophore: IRDye 800CW. NIR-6T is a DAA1106 analogue also conjugated to IRDye 800CW.We found that NIR-6T competed for [(3)H]-PK 11195 binding in astrocytoma cell homogenates with nanomolar affinity, but did not exhibit specific binding in intact astrocytoma cells in culture, indicating that NIR-6T is unlikely to constitute a useful MI agent for monitoring TSPO expression in intact cells. Conversely, we found that NIR-conPK did not compete for [(3)H]-PK 11195 binding in astrocytoma cell homogenate, but exhibited specific binding in intact astrocytoma cells in culture with nanomolar affinity, suggesting that NIR-conPK binds to a protein distinct, but related to, TSPO. Accordingly, treating intact astrocytoma cells and microglia in culture with cytokines led to significant changes in the amount of NIR-conPK specific binding without corresponding change in TSPO expression. Remarkably, the cytokine-induced changes in the protein targeted by NIR-conPK in intact microglia were selective, since IFN-gamma (but not TNFalpha and TGFbeta) increased the amount of NIR-conPK specific binding in these cells.Together these results suggest that NIR-conPK binds to a protein that is related to TSPO, and expressed by astrocytomas and microglia. Our results also suggest that the expression of this protein is increased by specific cytokines, and thus allows for the monitoring of a particular subtype of microglia activation.",

Although it is established that an Na(+)-dependent mechanism mediates mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux, the molecular identity of this transporter has remained elusive. Here we show that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger NCLX is enriched in mitochondria, where it is localized to the cristae. Employing Ca(2+) and Na(+) fluorescent imaging, we demonstrate that mitochondrial Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) efflux is enhanced upon overexpression of NCLX, is reduced by silencing of NCLX expression by siRNA, and is fully rescued by the concomitant expression of heterologous NCLX. NCLX-mediated mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport was inhibited, moreover, by CGP-37157 and exhibited Li(+) dependence, both hallmarks of mitochondrial Na(+)-dependent Ca(2+) efflux. Finally, NCLX-mediated mitochondrial Ca(2+) exchange is blocked in cells expressing a catalytically inactive NCLX mutant.

To evaluate behaviors potentially related to anxiety, the present experiments assessed the CB1 inverse agonist AM251 (2.0-8.0mg/kg), the CB1 antagonist AM4113 (3.0-12.0mg/kg), and the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG-7142 (10.0-20.0mg/kg), using the open field test and the elevated plus maze. Although all three drugs affected open field behavior, these effects were largely due to actions on locomotion. In the elevated plus maze, FG-7142 and AM251 both produced anxiogenic effects. FG-7142 and AM251 also significantly increased c-Fos activity in the amygdala and nucleus accumbens shell. In contrast, AM4113 failed to affect performance in the plus maze, and did not induce c-Fos immunoreactivity. The weak effects of AM4113 are consistent with biochemical data showing that AM4113 induces little or no intrinsic cellular activity.

The main reasons for discontinuation were insufficient response (28.5%), patient/family choice (26.1%), adverse events (9.6%) and unacceptable tolerability (6.0%). At baseline, compared to completers, discontinuers were younger (37.4 vs. 39.6 years, p = 0.01), had schizophrenia for a shorter time (10.2 vs. 11.9 years, p = 0.02), had lower Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scores (43.5 vs. 48.0, p = 0.0001), higher utilization of benzodiazepines (56.5 vs. 43.3%) and more initiated therapy as inpatients (30 vs. 16%). With RLAI therapy GAF scores improved significantly (p < 0.001) for both groups but the 24-month value for discontinuers was lower than that of completers (55.4 vs. 67.2). Compared to the pre-RLAI initiation period, at 12 months post-initiation completers had greater reductions than discontinuers in the percent of patients hospitalized (66.2% reduction vs. 29.2%) and in the length (68% reduction vs. 0%) and number (80.0 vs. 14.3%) of hospital stays, differences that remained at 24 months.

    "115": "Slow-wave sleep is defined as sleep stages 3 and 4 that characteristically show slow delta EEG activity during polysomnography. The percentage of slow-wave sleep normally declines with age. Sleep disorders are a common symptom of many psychiatric disorders. In polysomnographic recordings they mostly manifest as disturbances of sleep continuity. In some disorders changes in REM sleep are also found. A reduction of slow-wave sleep has most often been described in patients with depression and addictive disorders. More recent research implicates slow-wave sleep as an important factor in memory consolidation, especially the contents of declarative memory. Psychotropic drugs influence sleep in different ways. Hypnotic substances can reduce the deep sleep stages (e.g. benzodiazepines), whereas 5-HT2C antagonists increase the percentage of slow-wave sleep. Whether a selective impairment/alteration of slow-wave sleep is clinically relevant has not yet been proved.",

The present study was designed to explore the modulation of the effects of propoxur over cognitive function by progesterone (PROG) and 4'-chlorodiazepam (4CD). Cognitive function was assessed using step-down latency (SDL) on a passive avoidance apparatus, transfer latency (TL) on a plus maze and spatial navigation test on Morris water maze. Oxidative stress was assessed by examining brain malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and catalase (CAT) activity. A significant reduction in SDL and prolongation of TL and spatial navigation test was found for the propoxur (10 mg/kg/d; p.o.) treated group at weeks 6 and 7 as compared with control. One-week treatment with 4CD (0.5 mg/kg/d; i.p.) antagonized the effect of propoxur on SDL, spatial navigation test as well as TL; whereas, PROG failed to modulate this effect at a dose of 15 mg/kg/d, i.p. Propoxur produced a statistically significant increase in the brain MDA levels and decrease in the brain GSH levels and CAT activity. Treatment with 4CD at the above dose attenuated the effect of propoxur on oxidative stress whereas PROG (15 mg/kg/d; i.p.) failed to influence the same. The results of the present study thus show that 4-CD has the potential to attenuate cognitive dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by toxicants like propoxur in the brain.",

Current approaches primarily probe cell-based variables, such as cytosolic calcium or membrane potential, but not cell-to-cell signaling. We devised cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporters (CNiFERs) to address this challenge and monitor in situ neurotransmitter receptor activation. CNiFERs are cultured cells that are engineered to express a chosen metabotropic receptor, use the G(q) protein-coupled receptor cascade to transform receptor activity into a rise in cytosolic [Ca(2+)] and report [Ca(2+)] with a genetically encoded fluorescent Ca(2+) sensor. The initial realization of CNiFERs detected acetylcholine release via activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. We used chronic implantation of M1-CNiFERs in frontal cortex of the adult rat to elucidate the muscarinic action of the atypical neuroleptics clozapine and olanzapine.

Outcome measures included the incidence of akathisia, time to onset, duration, severity, and discontinuation due to akathisia, concomitant use of benzodiazepines and/or anticholinergics, Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) scores, and the correlation between antipsychotic efficacy and akathisia. The results for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were as follows: akathisia in 9% of aripiprazole- and 6% of placebo-treated patients; 12.5% of aripiprazole- versus 24% of haloperidol-treated patients; 11% of aripiprazole- versus 6% of olanzapine-treated patients. Bipolar I disorder: akathisia in 18% of aripiprazole- and 5% of placebo-treated patients. The clinical characteristics of akathisia were similar between each data set, regardless of disease.

    "132": "Treatment of neuropathic pain is a major clinical challenge that has been met with minimal success. After peripheral nerve injury, a decrease in the expression of the K-Cl cotransporter KCC2, a major neuronal Cl(-) extruder, leads to pathologic alterations in GABA(A) and glycine receptor function in the spinal cord. The down-regulation of KCC2 is expected to cause a reduction in Cl(-) extrusion capacity in dorsal horn neurons, which, together with the depolarizing efflux of HCO(3)(-) anions via GABA(A) channels, would result in a decrease in the efficacy of GABA(A)-mediated inhibition. Carbonic anhydrases (CA) facilitate intracellular HCO(3)(-) generation and hence, we hypothesized that inhibition of CAs would enhance the efficacy of GABAergic inhibition in the context of neuropathic pain. Despite the decrease in KCC2 expression, spinal administration of benzodiazepines has been shown to be anti-allodynic in neuropathic conditions. Thus, we also hypothesized that spinal inhibition of CAs might enhance the anti-allodynic effects of spinally administered benzodiazepines. Here, we show that inhibition of spinal CA activity with acetazolamide (ACT) reduces neuropathic allodynia. Moreover, we demonstrate that spinal co-administration of ACT and midazolam (MZL) act synergistically to reduce neuropathic allodynia after peripheral nerve injury. These findings indicate that the combined use of CA inhibitors and benzodiazepines may be effective in the clinical management of neuropathic pain in humans.",

    "142": "We have found repeatedly that medial septal (MS) infusions of glucose impair memory when co-infused with the gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) agonist muscimol. The present experiments sought to determine whether the memory-impairing effects of this concentration of glucose would generalize to another GABA(A) receptor agonist and to an agonist from another neurotransmitter system that is known to impair memory. Specifically, we determined whether the dose of glucose that produces memory deficits when combined with muscimol in the MS would also impair memory when co-infused with the GABA(A) receptor modulator chlordiazepoxide (CDP) or the opiate morphine. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given MS co-infusions and then 15 min later tested for spontaneous alternation or given shock avoidance training (retention tested 48 h later). The results showed that MS infusions of the higher dose of glucose with morphine did not produce memory deficits, whereas, the performance of rats given MS co-infusions of CDP with glucose was impaired. These findings suggest that the memory-impairing effects of brain glucose administration may involve an interaction with the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "143": "Decades after ethanol was first described as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mimetic, the precise mechanisms that produce the acute effects of ethanol and the physiological adaptations that underlie ethanol tolerance and dependence remain unclear. Although a substantial body of evidence suggests that ethanol acts on GABAergic neurotransmission to enhance inhibition in the central nervous system, the precise mechanisms underlying the physiological effects of both acute and chronic ethanol exposure are still under investigation. We have used in vitro ethanol exposure followed by recording of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) to determine whether acute or chronic ethanol exposure directly alters synaptic GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) function or GABA release in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. Acute ethanol exposure slightly increased the duration of mIPSCs in hippocampal neurons but did not alter mIPSC kinetics in cortical neurons. Acute ethanol exposure did not change mIPSC frequency in either hippocampal or cortical neurons. One day of chronic ethanol exposure produced a transient decrease in mIPSC duration in cortical neurons but did not alter mIPSC kinetics in hippocampal neurons. Chronic ethanol exposure did not change mIPSC frequency in either hippocampal or cortical neurons. Chronic ethanol exposure also did not produce substantial cross-tolerance to a benzodiazepine in either hippocampal or cortical neurons. The results suggest that ethanol exposure in vitro has limited effects on synaptic GABA(A)R function and action potential-independent GABA release in cultured neurons and that ethanol exposure in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons may not reproduce all the effects that occur in vivo and in acute brain slices.", 
    "144": "Although dental board regulations for the provision of in-office enteral conscious (oral) sedation vary widely with respect to training and pharmacologic strategies, they agree on the use of drugs that are inherently safe, the use of pulse oximetry and the availability of emergency equipment, including pharmacologic antagonists. Patient safety is of greatest concern and is best addressed by appropriate selection of patients, adequate training of personnel and appropriate monitoring of patients. Readings from bispectral index system (BIS) monitors, which use electroencephalographic signals, correlate accurately with depth of sedation during nondissociative general anesthesia of adults and children in the operating room setting. The usefulness of such monitoring as an adjunct to other forms of monitoring of in-office enteral sedation in the dental setting may represent the next important application of this tool, adding a further level of safety for the patient and another level of predictability for the practitioner. This paper reviews the current evidence supporting this new technique, presenting data from 20 procedures in which BIS monitoring during in-office enteral sedation was employed in a community dental practice.", 
    "145": "Clinically, SSRIs are widely prescribed in the treatment of several anxiety disorders, although very few pre-clinical studies have observed a beneficial effect of this class of drugs in animal models of anxiety. Furthermore, the biphasic pattern observed clinically, an exacerbation of anxiety followed by beneficial effects, is rarely observed in animal studies. In the present study we document this clinical phenomenon in several behavioural paradigms. While a single injection of citalopram induced anxiogenic effects, three administrations of citalopram were sufficient to elicit anxiolytic effects. Congruent with these data, we observed that short-term repeated administration of citalopram was accompanied by increased activation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) in the hippocampus and desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors, two phenomena well associated with chronic rather than acute actions of antidepressants. Moreover, effects of citalopram were abolished in CREBalphaDelta mutant animals in the elevated zero maze (EZM) and tail suspension test (TST), but not in novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH). Further, the desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors elicited by citalopram was not affected by CREB deficiency. The significance of the EZM and TST paradigms in predicting therapeutic efficacy is well known while effects in NIH and 5-HT1A sensitization are less well-established. These data demonstrate that behavioural responses to citalopram are dependent on the frequency of its administration, and that these responses are differentially dependent on CREB function.",

    "171": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is synthesized in brain by two isoforms of glutamic acid decarboxylase (Gad), Gad1 and Gad2. Gad1 provides most of the GABA in brain, but Gad2 can be rapidly activated in times of high GABA demand. Mice lacking Gad2 are viable whereas deletion of Gad1 is lethal. We produced null mutant mice for Gad2 on three different genetic backgrounds: predominantly C57BL/6J and one or two generations of backcrossing to 129S1/SvimJ (129N1, 129N2). We used these mice to determine if actions of alcohol are regulated by synthesis of GABA from this isoform. We also studied behavioral responses to a benzodiazepine (flurazepam) and a GABAA receptor agonist (gabaxadol). Deletion of Gad2 increased ethanol palatability and intake and slightly reduced the severity of ethanol-induced withdrawal, but these effects depended strongly on genetic background. Mutant mice on the 129N2 background showed the above three ethanol behavioral phenotypes, but the C57BL/6J inbred background did not show any of these phenotypes. Effects on ethanol consumption also depended on the test as the mutation did not alter consumption in limited access models. Deletion of Gad2 reduced the effect of flurazepam on motor incoordination and increased the effect of extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist gabaxadol without changing the duration of loss of righting reflex produced by these drugs. These results are consistent with earlier proposals that deletion of Gad2 (on 129N2 background) reduces synaptic GABA but also suggest changes in extrasynaptic receptor function.", 
    "172": "Early life experience impacts emotional development in the infant. In rat pups, repeated, brief (i.e., 15 min) maternal separation (MS15) during the first 1-2 postnatal weeks has been shown to increase active maternal care and to reduce later anxiety-like behavior in the offspring. We hypothesized that the anxiolytic effect of MS15 is partly due to increased intestinal release of cholecystokinin (CCK) in rat pups as a result of increased maternal contact. We predicted that rats with a history of MS15 would display less anxiety in the elevated plus maze (EPMZ) and novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) tests, as compared with nonseparated (NS) controls, and that the anxiolytic effect of MS15 would be attenuated in rats in which daily MS15 was accompanied by systemic administration of a CCK-1 receptor antagonist (i.e., devazepide). Treatment groups included NS control litters, litters exposed to MS15 from postnatal days (P)1-10, inclusive, and litters exposed to MS15 with concurrent subcutaneous injection of devazepide or vehicle. Litters were undisturbed after P10 and were weaned on P21. Subsets of adolescent males from each litter were tested in the EPMZ on P40-41, while others were tested for NSF on P50-52. As predicted, rats with a developmental history of MS15 displayed reduced anxiety-like behavior in the EPMZ and NSF tests. The anxiolytic effect of MS15 was preserved in vehicle-treated rats, but was reversed in devazepide-treated rats. These results support the view that endogenous CCK-1 receptor signaling in infants is a potential pathway through which maternal-pup interactions regulate the development and functional organization of emotional circuits that control anxiety-like behavior in the offspring.", 
    "173": "Maternal aggression (maternal defense) is a fierce aggression produced by lactating females toward intruders that plays an important role in protection of vulnerable offspring. Enhancement of GABA(A) receptor signaling by benzodiazepines increases maternal aggression, and we recently found indirect evidence that lateral septum (LS) could be a key site where benzodiazepines elevate aggression. In this study, we directly tested the hypothesis that activation of GABA(A) receptors in LS would promote maternal aggression while inhibition of this receptor would decrease aggression. Site-directed injections to LS were made using the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (3-30 ng), or the GABA(A) receptor agonists, chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine (2.5-5 microg), and muscimol (0.05-5 ng). Maternal aggression and other behavioral measures were then evaluated in lactating mice. Neither GABA(A) receptor agonist elevated aggression, which could reflect a ceiling effect. However, 7 ng of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, in LS significantly decreased maternal aggression without altering other maternal behaviors or light-dark box performance, suggesting some GABA(A) receptor signaling in LS is required for full maternal aggression expression. Together, these results confirm a role for GABA(A) receptor signaling in LS in the regulation of maternal aggression.",

Birds in group KX were anesthetized with ketamine (15 mg/kg i.m.) and xylazine (2.5 mg/kg i.m.), whereas the birds anesthetized in group KXM received midazolam (0.3 mg/kg i.m.) in addition to the ketamine and xylazine protocol. The onset of anesthesia, duration of analgesia, duration of recumbency, and recovery time were determined. Heart and respiratory rates as well as cloacal temperatures were recorded immediately after drug administration and at 10-minute intervals until the birds were sternally recumbent. Analgesia was assessed as a response to artery forceps applied to the digit and skin proximal to the tarsal joint. The mean (SD) duration of analgesia in the group KXM birds was 37.4 +/- 23.5 minutes, whereas no analgesia was apparent with the group KX birds. The duration of recumbency was significantly longer and respiratory rates were significantly lower in group KXM birds compared with those in group KX. Adverse effects were minimal and included diarrhea (n = 1) and hypersalivation (n = 2) in group KX birds, and regurgitation (n = 2) in group KXM birds. Midazolam administered intramuscularly appeared to improve the anesthetic quality of ketamine and xylazine in guinea fowls without adversely affecting safety.",

Between September of 2003 and April of 2006, all 90 newly admitted patients to a MMT clinic in Tel Aviv were studied and followed up for one year. A SOC (inner resources) questionnaire was done at baseline and after one year. Use of opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, cannabis and amphetamines in the 13 months after admission was recorded, and defined as positive if at least one urine test for any drug was positive. After one year, 77 (85.6%) stayed in treatment. SOC scores were similar at baseline and after one year, but were lower among 42 patients who still abused any drugs (118.8 + 27.4), compared with the 35 patients who did not (128.5 + 26.5, Repeated measures, Groups p = 0.003, Time effect p = 0.5, Time*Group p = 0.003).

Since 2005 to 2007, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of ketamine to control pain induced by diagnostic procedures in pediatric oncology patients. Eight hundred fifty procedures were carried out in 125 patients aged 2 to 16 years. We associated EMNO (inhaled equimolar mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen), atropin (oral or rectal), midazolam (oral or rectal) and ketamin (intravenous). An anesthesiologist injected ketamin. Average dose of ketamine was 0.33 to 2 mg/kg depending on number and invasiveness of procedures. This method requires careful monitoring and proper precautions. With these conditions, no complication was observed. All patients were effectively sedated. These results indicate that ketamine - in association with EMNO, atropine and midazolam - is safe and effective in pain management induced by diagnostic procedures in pediatric oncology patients. The sedative regimen of intravenous ketamine has greatly reduced patient, family and practitioners anxiety for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.",

Little is known about the ITX activity on the function of the central nervous system and cerebral neurotransmitters. Using behavioural, biochemical, and electrophysiological tests, the authors have found that: (1) ITX did not exert an in vivo anxiolytic or sedative effect when administered orally to rats; (2) ITX did not affect the binding characteristics of central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors studied in vitro; and (3) ITX did not influence the ability of gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) to increase the chloride channel permeability studied by patch clamp technique in a single neuron of cultured cerebellar granule cells.",

However, the gap between the results obtained in controlled clinical trials and everyday clinical practice exists. Therefore, the importance of naturalistic studies in psychiatry is becoming recognized. The aim of present naturalistic study was to acquire data on efficacy, safety, and preference of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets during a 17-week treatment of depression. This prospective, open-label, multicenter study in patients with mild to severe depression was conducted at 47 mental health centers of Lithuania by 78 psychiatrists. Patients were initially given 15 mg or 30 mg of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets; the maximum allowed dose was 45 mg per day. The primary efficacy measure was the total score on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD-17), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I) scales. Tolerability was primarily measured by assessing the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events. Patients were evaluated at baseline, at weeks 1, 5, 9, 13, and 17. A total of 779 patients (595 women [76.4%] with a mean [SD] age of 50.2 [13.65] and 184 men [23.6%] with a mean [SD] age of 52.4 [14.6] years) were enrolled into the study; 687 (88.2%) patients completed the study. The mean (SD) daily dose of mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablets was 29.0 (3.8) mg. The mean total (SD) HAMD-17 score improved significantly from 25.7 (4.6) to 7.3 (4.3) (P<0.005). At each visit, the mean HAMD-17 score was significantly lower than that at the preceding visit. At week 17, remission (HAMD-17 score < or =7) was observed in 436 (56%) patients. The mean (SD) CGI-S score improved significantly from 4.9 (1.0) at baseline to 1.5 (0.6) at endpoint (P<0.001). According to the CGI-I assessments, 621 patients (89.4%) improved and improved very much. The vast majority of patients (80%) preferred the new formulation of mirtazapine - mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablet. Treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 106 patients (13.6%). The most frequent adverse events were weight gain, sedation, dizziness, and dry mouth. In this study conducted in Lithuania with depressed patients, a significant improvement was shown in all efficacy measures. In addition, mirtazapine orally disintegrating tablet was a well-tolerated and preferable formulation for the treatment of depressed patients.",

This review synthesizes over 20 years of original research and comprehensive review articles with attention to the most recent findings. Though catatonia is common and highly treatable, there have been few research studies investigating the syndrome. Pooled case reports suggest that catatonia due to an underlying general medical condition and catatonia due to a psychiatric illness can be treated similarly and that the catatonic symptoms and the underlying illness must be addressed in both types.

The syndrome of catatonia, however, remains in a diagnostic limbo, acknowledged predominantly as a subtype of schizophrenia. Yet, catatonia is present in about 10% of acutely ill psychiatry patients, only a minority of whom have schizophrenia. Among those with comorbid affective disorders, who comprise the largest subgroup of catatonic patients, the catatonic signs typically resolve dramatically and completely with benzodiazepine therapy. Those with schizophrenia respond less reliably, suggesting that the underlying processes causing the catatonia may be different in this group. The majority of patients with catatonia have concurrent psychosis. Failure to treat the catatonia before institution of antipsychotic medication may increase the risk of inducing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. At this point of time, the pathobiology of catatonia is unknown; the major reason for considering catatonia as a separate diagnostic entity would be to increase recognition of this eminently treatable neuropsychiatric syndrome.",

Previous data have indicated that omega-3 fatty acids lead to prevention of status epilepticus-associated neuropathological changes in the hippocampal formation of rats with epilepsy. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has resulted in extensive preservation of GABAergic cells in animals with epilepsy. This study investigated the interplay of these effects with neurogenesis and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). The results clearly showed a positive effect of long-term omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on brain plasticity in animals with epilepsy. Enhanced hippocampal neurogenesis and BDNF levels and preservation of interneurons expressing parvalbumin were observed. Parvalbumin-positive cells were identified as surviving instead of newly formed cells. Additional investigations are needed to determine the electrophysiological properties of the newly formed cells and to clarify whether the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on brain plasticity are accompanied by functional gain in animals with epilepsy.",

Thus, we believe that this pheromone may increase anxiety levels in rats. In the current study, we evaluated the predictive validity of this alarm pheromone-induced anxiogenic effect in detail by investigating whether six types of human anxiolytics, each of which has a different mechanism of action, were efficacious in reducing anxiety, using changes in the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) as an index. The alarm pheromone-enhanced ASR was not affected by vehicle pretreatment but was dose-dependently attenuated by pretreatment with midazolam, phenelzine, propranolol, clonidine, and CP-154,526-although not buspirone. These results may reflect some aspects of the predictive validity of the alarm pheromone-induced anxiety in rats as an animal model of human anxiety.",

The total number of arousals per hour decreased with zolpidem use, 24.0 +/- 11.6 to 15.1 +/- 7.7 (p < 0.001), leading to a significant improvement in sleep efficiency. There was a positive correlation between the decrease in CAHI and the arousal index. Consistent with the hypnotic effect of zolpidem, sleep latency decreased, stage 1 sleep percentage decreased, and stage 2 percentage increased (all significant), without changes in stage 3-4 or REM sleep.
