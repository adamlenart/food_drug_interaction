    "0": "Increased serotonergic activity is discussed as an important pathogenetic factor in schizophrenia. Further support for this hypothesis is difficult to obtain due to the lack of valid indicators of the brain's serotonin system. A great deal of evidence discovered through human and animal studies suggests that a weak loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials (LDAEP) indicates high serotonergic activity and vice versa. The LDAEP is a measure of auditory cortex activity, reflecting increase or decrease of auditory evoked potential amplitudes with increasing tone loudness, which is probably modulated by the serotonergic innervation there. This is true only for the LDAEP of the primary auditory cortex, since this region is more highly innervated by serotonergic fibers than the secondary auditory cortex. The LDAEP (N1/P2 component) of 25 inpatients with schizophrenia free of medication and 25 healthy controls matched by age and gender, were recorded. Using dipole source analysis, the LDAEP of primary (tangential dipole) and this of secondary auditory cortex (radial dipole) was separately analyzed. Following a 4-week treatment with the 5-HT(2) antagonists clozapine or olanzapine, patients were once again studied. The LDAEP of the primary, but not of the secondary auditory cortex, was significantly weaker in the patients with schizophrenia than in healthy volunteers, indicating enhanced serotonergic neurotransmission. After treatment with the 5-HT(2) antagonists, the LDAEP (of the right hemisphere) tended to be increased, indicating normalization of serotonergic function in the patients with schizophrenia. These results suggest that the loudness dependence of primary auditory cortex evoked activity is well suitable to assess serotonergic dysfunction in schizophrenia.", 
    "1": "Benzodiazepines are used for their sedative/hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects. They exert their actions through a specific high affinity binding site on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, the gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)) receptor channel, where they act as positive allosteric modulators. To start to elucidate the relative positioning of benzodiazepine binding site ligands in their binding pocket, GABA(A) receptor residues thought to reside in the site were individually mutated to cysteine and combined with benzodiazepine analogs carrying substituents reactive to cysteine. Direct apposition of such reactive partners is expected to lead to an irreversible site-directed reaction. We describe here the covalent interaction of alpha(1)H101C with a reactive group attached to the C-7 position of diazepam. This interaction was studied at the level of radioactive ligand binding and at the functional level using electrophysiological methods. Covalent reaction occurs concomitantly with occupancy of the binding pocket. It stabilizes the receptor in its allosterically stimulated conformation. Covalent modification is not observed in wild type receptors or when using mutated alpha(1)H101C-containing receptors in combination with the reactive ligand pre-reacted with a sulfhydryl group, and the modification rate is reduced by the binding site ligand Ro15-1788. We present in addition evidence that gamma(2)Ala-79 is probably located in the access pathway of the ligand to its binding pocket.", 
    "2": "The diagnosis of pneumonia in the critically ill patient is very difficult because the usual signs and symptoms are unreliable in the intensive care setting. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a diagnostic tool with a reported sensitivity of 70%. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and specificity of BAL in severely burned pediatric patients. An analysis was performed in which BAL cultures were compared and correlated to chest radiographs. Patient characteristics, such as age, sex, burn size, depth of burn, and the presence of inhalation injury were evaluated. Over a period of 18 months, 58 thermally injured children were identified who underwent 101 BALs. The mean age was 6.5 +/- 5 years, mean TBSA was 39 +/- 27%, and inhalation injury was diagnosed in 20 patients (35%). Of 101 BALs, 48 were positive, and of the 101 chest radiographs, 20 demonstrated signs of pneumonia. Ten of those were associated with a positive BAL and 10 with a negative BAL. Thus, the positive predictive value of BAL was 21%, whereas the negative predictive value was 81%. Interestingly 80% of patients with tracheobronchitis from inhalation injury demonstrated a positive BAL. We conclude that in pediatric burn patients BAL correlates poorly with radiographic signs of pneumonia.", 
    "3": "Children who require intubation as a component of their burn management generally need heavy sedation, usually with a combination of opiate and benzodiazepine infusions with a target sensorium of light sleep. When extubation approaches, the need for sedation to prevent uncontrolled extubation can conflict with the desire to lighten sedation enough to ensure that airway protective reflexes are strong. The several hours' half-life of these medications can make this period of weaning challenging. Therefore, the hours preceding extubation are among the most difficult in which to ensure safe adequate sedation. The pharmacokinetics of propofol allow for the rapid emergence of a patient from deep sedation. We have had success with an extubation strategy using short-term propofol infusions in critically ill children. In this work, children were maintained on morphine and midazolam infusions per our unit protocol, escalating doses as required to maintain comfort. Approximately 8 hours before planned extubation, these infusions were decreased by approximately half and propofol infusion added to maintain a state of light sleep. Extubation was planned approximately 8 hours later to allow ample time for the chronically infused opiates and benzodiazepines to be metabolized down to the new steady-state level. Thirty minutes before planned extubation, propofol was stopped while morphine and midazolam infusions were maintained at the reduced level. When the children awakened from the propofol-induced state of light sleep, they were extubated while the reduced infusions of morphine and midazolam were maintained. These were subsequently weaned slowly, depending on the child's need for ongoing pain and anxiety medication, per our unit protocol to minimize the incidence of withdrawal symptoms. Data are shown in the text as mean +/- standard deviation. These 11 children (eight boys and three girls) had an average age of 6.6 +/- 5.6 years (range, 1.2-13 years), average weight of 36.9 +/- 28.7 kg (range, 9.3-95 kg), and burn size of 43 +/- 21.4% (range, 10-85%). Three children had sustained scald burns and eight had flame injuries with associated inhalation injury. They had been intubated for an average of 12.7 +/- 10.9 (range, 2-33 days). Morphine infusions immediately before the initiation of propofol averaged 0.26 +/- 0.31 mg/kg/hour (range, 0.04-1.29 mg/kg/hr) and midazolam averaged 0.15 +/- 0.16 mg/kg/hr (range, 0.06-0.65 mg/kg/hr). Morphine infusions after beginning propofol and at extubation averaged 0.16 +/- 0.16 (range, 0.04-0.65 mg/kg/hr) and midazolam averaged 0.09 +/- 0.08 mg/kg/hr (range, 0.02-0.32 mg/kg/hr). Propofol doses after initial titration during the first hour of infusion averaged 3.6 +/- 2.9 mg/kg/hr (range, 0.4-8.1 mg/kg/hr). Nine of the 11 children (82%) were successfully extubated on the first attempt. Two required reintubation for postextubation stridor 2 to 6 hours after extubation but were successfully extubated the next day after a short course of steroids, again using the same propofol technique. All were awake at extubation and went on to survive. Morphine and midazolam infusions were gradually weaned, and there were no withdrawal symptoms noted. Although prolonged (days) infusions of propofol have been associated with adverse cardiovascular complications in critically ill young children and should probably be avoided, short-term (in hours) use of the drug can facilitate smooth extubation.", 
    "4": "In the studies reported here, the ability of atomoxetine hydrochloride (Strattera) to inhibit or induce the metabolic capabilities of selected human isoforms of cytochrome P450 was evaluated. Initially, the potential of atomoxetine and its two metabolites, N-desmethylatomoxetine and 4-hydroxyatomoxetine, to inhibit the metabolism of probe substrates for CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A was evaluated in human hepatic microsomes. Although little inhibition of CYP1A2 and CYP2C9 activity was observed, inhibition was predicted for CYP3A (56% predicted inhibition) and CYP2D6 (60% predicted inhibition) at concentrations representative of high therapeutic doses of atomoxetine. The ability of atomoxetine to induce the catalytic activities of CYP1A2 and CYP3A in human hepatocytes was also evaluated; however, atomoxetine did not induce either isoenzyme. Based on the potential of interaction from the in vitro experiments, drug interaction studies in healthy subjects were conducted using probe substrates for CYP2D6 (desipramine) in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer subjects and CYP3A (midazolam) in CYP2D6 poor metabolizer subjects. Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters of desipramine (single dose of 50 mg) were not altered when coadministered with atomoxetine (40 or 60 mg b.i.d. for 13 days). Only modest changes (approximately 16%) were observed in the plasma pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single dose of 5 mg) when coadministered with atomoxetine (60 mg b.i.d. for 12 days). Although at high therapeutic doses of atomoxetine inhibition of CYP2D6 and CYP3A was predicted, definitive in vivo studies clearly indicate that atomoxetine administration with substrates of CYP2D6 and CYP3A does not result in clinically significant drug interactions.",

They were randomly assigned to undergo either cognitive-behavioural therapy plus gradual tapering of the drug (combined treatment) or gradual tapering only. The cognitive-behavioural therapy was provided by a psychologist in 8 weekly small-group sessions. The tapering was supervised by a physician, who met weekly with each participant over an 8-week period.

Mitochondria plays a central role in this process. Using an autotransplant pig kidney model, changes in renal function and morphology were determined after different periods of cold ischemia in kidneys preserved in the University of Wisconsin solution (UW), high-Na(+) version of UW (HEH) or Celsior (CEL) a newly developed high-Na(+) solution, with or without trimetazidine (TMZ). Kidney function was better preserved in HEH after 24 hr and particularly 48- and 72-hr cold storage than in CEL and UW. TMZ improved the preservation quality when added to the different solutions tested, particularly after 48- and 72-hr cold storage. Interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy were reduced in HEH with TMZ. CD4(+) T-cell infiltration was also modulated by the preservation conditions. Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) positive cells infiltration was also modulated by preservation conditions. TMZ was efficient to reduce IRI when added in the various preservation solutions. These results suggest that protection of the mitochondrial function should be a major target to limit IRI. In addition, this study outlines the role of CD4(+) T cells and PBR expression in inflammatory responses after IRI.", 
    "21": "The sphincter of Oddi (SO) plays an important role in regulating the bile flow into the duodenum. This study was designed to investigate the effect of Chinese Medicinal Herbs Muh-Shiang-Bin-Lang-Wan (MSBLW) and their mechanism of action on regulating the motility of SO in rabbits. The activity of SO in anesthetized rabbits was measured by using a continuously perfused open-tip manometric method. The rabbits were administered with different doses of MSBLW through naso-gastric tubes. The SO motility before and after the administration of MSBLW were recorded, and analyzed with a computer equipped with an off line analysis software. The results showed that the SO activity, in terms of tonic pressure and phasic contraction pressure, were significantly changed. A significant lower tonic pressure and a higher phasic contraction pressure were noticed 40-60 min after administration of MSBLW with a peak response at 0.5-1.0 gm range. The responses were blocked by pretreatment of muscarinic receptors (M1) antagonist, pirenzepine (10 mg/kg, orally). We conclude that MSBLW is effective in increasing the SO motility in rabbits through activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. However, potential application of MSBLW in the treatment of human biliary disorders needs further evaluation.", 
    "22": "Aggressive behavior can serve important adaptive functions in social species. However, if it exceeds the species-typical pattern, it may become maladaptive. Very high or escalated levels of aggressive behavior can be induced in laboratory rodents by pharmacological (alcohol-heightened aggression), environmental (social instigation), or behavioral (frustration-induced aggression) means. These various forms of escalated aggressive behavior may be useful in further elucidating the neurochemical control over aggression and violence. One neurochemical system most consistently linked with escalated aggression is the GABAergic system, in conjunction with other amines and peptides. Although direct stimulation of GABA receptors generally suppresses aggression, a number of studies have found that positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors can cause increases in aggressive behavior. For example, alcohol, benzodiazepines, and many neurosteroids are all positive modulators of the GABAA receptor and all can cause increased levels of aggressive behavior. These effects are dose-dependent and higher doses of these compounds generally shift from heightening aggressive behavior to being sedative and anti-aggressive. In addition, these modulators interact with each other and can have additive effects on the GABAA receptor and on behavior, including aggression. The GABAA receptor is a heteropentameric protein that can be constituted from various subunits. It has been shown that subunit composition can affect sensitivity of the receptor to some modulators and that subunit composition differentially affects the sedative vs anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines. Initial studies targeting alpha subunits of the GABAA receptor point to their significant role in the aggression-heightening effects of alcohol, benzodiazepines, and neurosteroids.", 
    "23": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a highly prevalent and often disabling disorder. This paper reviews the pharmacological treatment of SAD based on published placebo-controlled studies and published meta-analyses. It addresses three specific questions: What is the first-line treatment of SAD? How long should treatment last? What should be the management of treatment-resistant cases? Based on their efficacy for SAD and common comorbid disorders, tolerability, and safety, SSRIs should be considered as the first-line treatment for most patients. Less information is available regarding the optimal length of treatment, although individuals who discontinue treatment after 12-20 wk appear more likely to relapse than those who continue on medication. Even less empirical evidence is available to support strategies for treatment-resistant cases. Clinical experience suggests that SSRI non-responders may benefit from augmentation with benzodiazepines or gabapentin, or from switching to MAOIs, RIMAs, benzodiazepines or gabapentin. Cognitive-behavioural therapy may also be a helpful adjunct or alternative.",

A smaller proportion of young adults with schizophrenia currently had a sexual partner or had ever engaged in sexual relations. They also had sexual relations and sexual desires less often. Whether affected by schizophrenia or not, a smaller proportion of women had ever masturbated, and a smaller proportion of men currently had a sexual partner. Women masturbated less often, felt less sexual desire, and desired sexual relations less often, compared with men. Proportionally more men with schizophrenia treated with risperidone or olanzapine than men in the comparison group had at least one sexual dysfunction, lacked sexual desire, and reported problems with sexual arousal and ejaculation. Women with schizophrenia were more likely to report problems with sexual arousal and galactorrhea, compared with women in the comparison group. Finally, young adults with schizophrenia were more likely to develop negative psychological tendencies associated with sexuality than were young adults in the comparison group. Sexual problems are highly prevalent among young adults with schizophrenia. Sexuality should occupy the space it deserves within psychosocial rehabilitation programs and the treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "25": "This article reviews what causes clinicians to overlook or underdiagnose akathisia. The causes are considered to be related to both the patient's symptoms and the clinician's attitude toward akathisia. The patient factors include mild severity of akathisia, lack of apparent motor restlessness, no voluntary expression of inner restlessness, no clear communication of inner restlessness, restlessness in body parts other than the legs, atypical expressions of inner restlessness, other prominent psychic symptoms, and absence of other extrapyramidal signs. The clinician factors include emphasis on objective restlessness, failure to consider akathisia during antipsychotic therapy, failure to fully implement antiakathisia treatments in ambiguous cases, and strict adherence to research diagnostic criteria. Akathisia is likely to be overlooked or underdiagnosed when both patient and clinician factors are present. Currently, there may be two major problems with underdiagnosis: (1) symptoms that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for akathisia are overlooked, and (2) conditions that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria but can still benefit from antiakathisia measures are underdiagnosed.",

However, there is controversy as to whether the newer \"atypical\" antipsychotics are more diabetogenic than older \"typical\" agents. We undertook a retrospective cohort analysis of 484 patients receiving outpatient prescriptions for either olanzapine (n=312) or one of four typical antipsychotics (n=172) at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center from October 1, 1996 (when olanzapine first became available at our institution) through December 31, 2000. The four typical antipsychotics were haloperidol, fluphenazine, chlorpromazine, and perphenazine.Random plasma glucose values collected over the 4.25-year period were classified as to whether they had been drawn before, during, or after exposure to an antipsychotic. Primary outcome measures were the development of a random plasma glucose > or =160 mg/dl or > or 200 mg/dl while on an antipsychotic. Significant differences were found in the percentages of antipsychotic-treated patients developing a random plasma glucose > or =160 mg/dl (olanzapine 12.5% versus typical antipsychotics 5.2%, P<.01, adjusted odds ratio 3.6) and > or =200 mg/dl (olanzapine 5.4% versus typical antipsychotics 1.7%, P=.02, adjusted odds ratio 5.1). For patients younger than 60 years of age, 10.5% of those taking olanzapine developed a random plasma glucose > or =160 mg/dl compared with 0% of those taking typical antipsychotics, P=.0003. In conclusion, we found that among individuals without a plasma glucose value > or =160 mg/dl at baseline, use of olanzapine was associated with an increased risk of elevation in plasma glucose compared with use of typical antipsychotics.", 
    "28": "Individuals with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) utilize more health care services and are significantly more costly. Drug treatments for TRD may include concomitant administration of multiple antidepressants or augmentation with mood stabilizers or antipsychotic agents. An augmentation strategy currently under investigation is the use of an olanzapine plus fluoxetine combination (OFC) therapy. The objectives for this pilot study were to use claims data to: (1) describe the extent of current use of OFC in patients with depressive disorders, and (2) compare health care utilization patterns and medical costs of patients receiving fluoxetine therapy before and after the initiation of olanzapine treatment. Data source consisted of medical, pharmaceutical, and disability claims from a Fortune 100 manufacturer from 1996 to 1998 (N>100,000). The sample included individuals with medical or disability claims for major depressive disorders treated with OFC (nOFC=36). Resource utilization and costs were compared for fluoxetine patients before and after the initiation of olanzapine treatment. Eleven percent of patients on combination therapy received olanzapine and fluoxetine. For patients on fluoxetine, there was a statistically significant reduction in health care utilization, and overall medical costs (20%), following initiation of olanzapine therapy. Overall, it appears the addition of olanzapine to ongoing fluoxetine therapy is effective in reducing outpatient, office, and inpatient utilization, as well as medical costs of patients treated for depression. Further research is needed to investigate combination therapy more fully.",

There was no evidence of violence, and no needle marks were found by the pathologist. Toxicological analyses, as achieved by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, demonstrated both recent and repetitive buprenorphine exposure in combination with nordiazepam. Buprenorphine concentrations were 1.1 ng/mL and 23 pg/mg in blood and hair, respectively. The boy's death was attributed to accidental asphyxia in a facilitated repetitive sexual abuse situation due to the combination of buprenorphine and benzodiazepines, even at therapeutic concentrations.

The use of larvae for toxicological analyses offers some technical advantages over putrefied tissue. Four sample pretreatment methods for isolating the benzodiazepines out of larvae were evaluated. A simple homogenization, followed by acetonitrile precipitation yielded the highest recoveries. Puparia were pulverized and extracted by ultrasonification in methanol. All extracts were subsequently analyzed using reversed-phase LC-MS-MS. Larvae and puparia calibrators containing benzodiazepines at concentrations ranging from 25 to 750 pg/mg and 50 to 500 pg/mg, respectively, were prepared and analyzed. The method was demonstrated to be linear over the ranges investigated. Limits of detection were from 1.88 to 5.13 pg/mg larva and from 6.28 to 19.03 pg/mg puparium. The developed method was applied to the determination of nordiazepam and its metabolite oxazepam in larvae and puparia of the Calliphora vicina fly that had been reared on artificial foodstuff (beef heart) spiked with 1 microg/g nordiazepam. The larvae were harvested at day 5 for analysis of drug content. The method was sufficiently sensitive to allow the detection of nordiazepam and oxazepam in a single larva or puparium.", 
    "35": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an important morphogenetic role, acting through GABA-A receptors, which are depolarizing in the developing rat brain. Other molecules with major morphogenetic roles are the nitric oxide free radical (NO(.)) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), both of which are involved in the control of synaptic plasticity and apoptosis. In the present work, we investigated the effect of GABA-A receptor activation on neuronal NO(.) synthase (nNOS) and BDNF immunoreactivity in the developing cortex of 5-day-old rats. We also determined the effect of GABA-A receptor activation on phosphorylated cAMP-response element binding protein (pCREB) immunoreactivity in an effort to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved. Our results show that activation of GABA-A receptors leads to increased numbers of nNOS, BDNF and pCREB, as well as nNOS-pCREB and BDNF-pCREB doubly immunopositive cells. This effect is abolished when L-type Ca(2+) channels are blocked. These results indicate that the following mechanism could be operating: depolarization following GABA-A receptor activation leads to opening of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, resulting in an increased Ca(2+) influx, which in turn leads to phosphorylation and, thus, activation, of the transcription factor CREB; the phosphorylated CREB can then induce BDNF, as well as nNOS.",

The first group received 10 mg oral clorazepate dipotassium and the second group, 1 mg intravenous midazolam. The surgeon's subjective experience of patients' cooperation during retrobulbar anesthesia and after surgery was measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The duration of surgery and rate of complications were documented. One day after surgery, the patients' subjective comfort during cataract surgery was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale and the best corrected visual acuity was determined.", 
    "39": "The level of anterograde amnesia tended to be higher in the midazolam group than in the clorazepate dipotassium group (4% versus 0% for anesthesia administration; 14% versus 4% for surgery), but the difference between groups was not significant. There were no significant differences in patient cooperation or complications during surgery. Patient satisfaction scores were not significantly different between the groups (P<.14); however, patients in the midazolam group expected to have significantly less pain during surgery (P<.04).

In particular, 9-fluoro-2-(2-fluorophenyl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3-one (2(2)) showed binding affinity in the subnanomolar concentration range and proved to be in vitro a potent antagonist. This finding allowed the nature of the hydrogen bonding receptor site H(2) to be established, as located between the N-1 nitrogen of the PQ nucleus and the ortho position of the N-2-aryl group. [35S]tert-Butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding assays and electrophysiological measurements of the effects on GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents at recombinant human alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)(L) GABA(A) receptors, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, were used to assess the intrinsic activities of a large series of PQs. With the aim of extracting discriminant information and distinguishing BzR ligands with different profiles of efficacy, 51 PQ derivatives, including full and partial agonists, antagonists, and inverse agonists, were analyzed in a multidimensional chemical descriptor space, defined by the lipophilicity parameter CLOG P and 3-D molecular WHIM descriptors, by means of principal component analysis, k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) method, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The classification methods were applied to subsets of pairs of efficacy classes, and lipophilicity and 3-D size descriptors were detected as the discriminant variables by a stepwise linear discriminant analysis. LDA proved to be superior to k-NN, especially in classifying PQ ligands (60-84% of success in prediction ability) into categories of efficacies which were contiguous and quite overlapped in the hyperspace of variables.",

The objectives of this study were to compare the efficacy of minimum doses of haloperidol with standard doses of risperidone and olanzapine on a 6-month open trial in first psychotic episode patients and to examine the effect of compliance on their outcome. Forty-two patients were recruited and started on flexible doses of these drugs. Olanzapine was given with no cost to the patients. Efficacy and side-effects were monitored every 3 months using standardized assessments. Thirty patients completed the study. All treatment groups showed improvement in positive, negative and depressive symptoms. There were no differences in side-effects among them. The haloperidol group required higher doses of anticholinergics. The rate of treatment discontinuation was higher in the risperidone group due to the direct cost. Minimum doses of haloperidol might prove to be a good choice of treatment for patients with a first episode of psychosis.",

The right MCAs of 13 cats were transiently occluded via a transorbital approach with microvascular clips. CBF was measured before occlusion of MCA, during occlusion, and immediately after reperfusion. After CBF measurement, A1-R, BDZ-R, and (18)F-FDG uptake were serially measured in the order listed.

    "48": "Previous studies have shown that endozepines, i.e. endogenous ligands of benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, stimulate steroidogenesis in adrenocortical and Leydig cells. In the present report, we have investigated the presence and action of endozepines in the human testis. Immunohistochemical labeling revealed the occurrence of endozepine-like immunoreactivity in Leydig, Sertoli, and germ cells. HPLC analysis combined with a specific RIA resolved two immunoreactive peaks that coeluted with synthetic octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) and triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN). RT-PCR amplification showed that the mRNA encoding the endozepine precursor diazepam-binding inhibitor is expressed in the human testis. The action of endozepines on testosterone production was studied in vitro using perifused human testicular fragments. Administration of TTN provoked a dose-dependent increase in testosterone secretion, whereas ODN had no effect. The stimulatory action of TTN on testosterone production was totally blocked by flunitrazepam, a peripheral-type BZD receptor antagonist/central-type BZD receptor (CBR) agonist. Conversely, the CBR agonist clonazepam and the CBR antagonist flumazenil did not affect testosterone secretion. Collectively, these results suggest that, in the human testicular tissue, TTN may exert an intracrine and/or paracrine control of steroidogenesis through activation of a peripheral-type BZD receptor.", 
    "49": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) molecular weight on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of controlled release formulations containing alprazolam. Tablet formulations contained alprazolam, excipients, and either HPMC K4MP or HPMC K100LVP. A ten patient in vivo clinical trial using a randomized, open-label, four-way crossover design was conducted in the fed and fasted states. Plasma alprazolam concentrations were determined for 72 h. The pharmacodynamic effects of alprazolam were monitored using subject rated sedation on visual analogue scale for wakefulness, observer rated sedation, and symbol digit modalities test (SDMT). Results indicated that the tablet formulations containing either HPMC K4MP or HPMC K100LVP had similar dissolution profiles, and the dissolution profiles did not change through 6 months at 40 degrees C/75% RH or 12 months at 25 degrees C/65% Relative Humidity (RH). The area under the plasma concentration-time curve, time to peak concentration, and peak plasma concentration were not significantly different between the two tablet formulations investigated in either the fed or fasted states. Pharmacodynamically, no significant differences in SDMT scores between the two formulations were found. In vitro dissolution results predicted in vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic results irrespective of formulation or diet used in the controlled release tablet. The controlled release tablets were bioequivalent and pharmacodynamically equivalent irrespective of the tablet formulation.", 
    "50": "Postpartum psychic disorders can be mainly divided into 3 groups: The so-called postpartum blues, the postpartum depression and the postpartum psychosis. The postpartum blues occurs 3 - 5 days postpartum in 50 - 70 % of deliveries mostly disappearing after one week without specific therapy. However, 20 - 30 % of patients will develop a depression in their further postpartum course so that a thorough evaluation concerning depression is warranted, if blues symptoms persist more than 2 weeks. Postpartum depression can be found in 10 - 15 % of deliveries and mostly occurs several weeks or months after delivery with symptoms of depressive mood, sleeping disorders, anxiety, loss of interest and accord and feelings of guilt up to suicidal ideas. In order not to misinterpret them as postpartum blues specific questions concerning the mood of the young mother during the postpartum examination - if necessary using the Edinburgh scale - are recommended. In patients with known risk factors for a postpartum depression (i. e. postpartum depression or psychosis in previous pregnancies, depression disorder, anxiety disorder, bipolar illness), a thorough survey is mandatory and - if necessary - a prophylactic treatment in cooperation with the psychiatrist. Less severe forms of postpartum depression can mostly be treated with psychotherapy and sociotherapy on an outpatient basis. In more severe cases, antidepressant drugs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs or some tricyclic drugs) are indicated. Postpartum anxiety and compulsive disorders respond well to psychotherapy; besides in anxiety disorders benzodiazepines are recommended, in compulsive disorders SSRIs. Postpartum psychoses (about 0.1 - 0.2 %) most often occur in bipolar or schizoaffective disorders or after postpartum psychosis. They require a hopitalization mainly because of the danger of suicide and homicide toward the newborn; ideally this is performed in mother-child-units.", 
    "51": "Drug biotransformation and its therapeutic effect may be modified during ageing. Among different causative factors of ageing, the impairment of normal cellular functions by free radicals has been evoked as playing a critical role. The effect of age on the expression and activity of CYP2E1 and CYP3A was investigated in male Wistar rats of 3, 8, 11 and 18 months old. The total cytochrome P450 as well as the expression and the activity (midazolam oxidation) of CYP3A isoforms did not change until 18 months of age. Chlorzoxazone hydroxylation (CYP2E1 activity) increased from 3 to 8 months, remained constant between 8 and 11 months and then progressively decreased until 18 months. Interestingly, CYP2E1 microsomal protein followed the same enzyme activity profile from 3 to 8 months, but remained constant thereafter. The level of CYP2E1 mRNA did not change over the whole period. While the amount of proteins did not change after 8 months, their functionality may be affected by oxidative stress (increase in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, decrease in reduced glutathione level). However, no changes in carbonyl protein content were observed. The decrease in CYP2E1 activity in rats after 11 months is most probably due to post-translational modifications of CYP2E1 proteins. Indeed, it may be correlated with an accumulation of oxidative damage. Since no change was observed in CYP3A activity or in their protein and mRNA content, it seems that such isoforms should be less affected by oxidative stress.",

Of the tested premedicants, Med induced the deepest sedation and the most potent dose-sparing effect. Induction of anesthesia was excellent to good in all dogs except for one dog premedicated with MB. Most dogs premedicated with AB or MB showed temporary apnea.

    "64": "The first mutations of the GABA(A) receptor channel linked to familial epilepsy in humans were reported in the gamma2L subunit. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the gamma2 subunit R43Q mutation abolished current enhancement by the benzodiazepine, diazepam, and the gamma2 subunit K289M mutation decreased current amplitudes. In this study, single channel recording and concentration jump techniques were used to evaluate the effects of these mutations on GABA(A) receptor currents from receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. When co-expressed with alpha1 and beta3 subunits, the mutated gamma2 subunits did not alter current activation rates or rates or extent of desensitization during prolonged (400 ms) GABA application (1 mM). Deactivation following brief (5 ms) or prolonged (400 ms) GABA application was accelerated for the K289M, but not the R43Q mutation. Single channel analysis showed shorter mean open duration, suggesting that the faster deactivation was likely caused by altered gating efficacy. Interestingly, the R43Q mutation did not alter diazepam potentiation. However, significantly smaller current amplitudes were observed that were not explained by decreased single channel conductance or open time, suggesting this mutation resulted in reduced surface expression of functional receptors. These two gamma mutations likely produce disinhibition and familial epilepsy by distinct mechanisms, suggesting that maintenance of normal neuronal inhibition depends on both the peak amplitude of IPSCs and their time course.", 
    "65": "The Fallopian tubes are scarcely innervated with cholinergic nerve fibers. Acetylcholine released from these nerves contracts smooth muscles of the tubes. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of acetylcholine on the Fallopian tubes using selective antagonists in different hormonal settings. We have investigated effects of acetylcholine on isolated ampulla of Fallopian tubes taken from 83 patients during abdominal hysterectomy with adnexectomy. Twenty-eight patients were in follicular, 36 were in luteal phase of menstrual cycle, and 19 patients were in menopause. Selective and non-selective muscarinic and nicotinic receptor blockers were used for investigation of the effects. Acetylcholine (from 1.8 to 658.6 microM/l) produced concentration-dependent tonic contraction of ampulla taken from the patients in follicular phase, luteal phase and menopause. The nicotinic receptor blocker mecamylamine (6.5 microM/l) and local anesthetic lidocaine (230.8 microM/l) did not affect the effect of acetylcholine. While M(1)- and M(2)-selective muscarinic receptor blockers pirenzepine (1.6 microM/l) and methoctramine (0.9 microM/l) did not show specific effect, atropine (0.01 microM/l) and selective M(3)-receptor blocker p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol (pFHHSiD, 0.2 microM/l) effectively blocked contractions caused by acetylcholine (maximal pA(2) values 9.74 and 7.54, respectively). The affinity of pFHHSiD for muscarinic receptors was highest in the follicular phase.

    "79": "The relationship between alcohol and seizures is complex and multifaceted. The prevalence of epilepsy in alcohol-dependent patients of western industrialised countries may be at least triple that in the general population, whereas the prevalence of alcoholism is only slightly higher in patients with epilepsy than in the general population. The seizure threshold is raised by alcohol drinking and declines on cessation of drinking. As a result, during withdrawal from alcohol, usually 6-48 hours after the cessation of drinking, seizures may occur. Alcohol acts on the brain through several mechanisms that influence seizure threshold. These include effects on calcium and chloride flux through the ion-gated glutamate NMDA and GABA receptors. During prolonged intoxication, the CNS adapts to the effects of alcohol, resulting in tolerance; however, these adaptive effects seem to be transient, disappearing after alcohol intake is stopped. Although the relationship of seizures to alcohol use is likely to be dose dependent and causal, the available clinical data do not suggest that alcohol use results in seizure genesis. However, a genetic predisposition to alcohol withdrawal seizures is possible. Other seizures in alcohol-dependent individuals may be due to concurrent metabolic, toxic, infectious, traumatic, neoplastic and cerebrovascular diseases and are frequently partial-onset seizures. Alcohol abuse is a major precipitant of status epilepticus (9-25% of cases), which may even be the first-ever seizure type. Prompt treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures is recommended to prevent status epilepticus. During the detoxification process, primary and secondary preventative measures can be taken. A meta-analysis of controlled trials for the primary prevention of alcohol withdrawal seizures demonstrated a highly significant risk reduction for seizures with benzodiazepines and antiepileptic drugs and an increased risk with antipsychotics. A meta-analysis of randomised, placebo-controlled trials for the secondary prevention of seizures after alcohol withdrawal showed lorazepam to be effective, whereas phenytoin was ineffective. Because withdrawal seizures do not recur if the patient remains abstinent, long-term administration of antiepileptic drugs is unnecessary in abstinent patients. The first seizure not related to alcohol withdrawal should not result in permanent drug treatment in an alcohol-dependent patient, because of poor compliance and the high likelihood of remission. The treatment of alcohol dependence is more important and should be prioritised before the prevention of further seizures.",

The sample comprised patients with a diagnosis of anxiety disorder whose original anxiolytic prescription had been refilled within 120 days. International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes and medical and prescription data identified the existence of comorbidities, and medical and prescription charges. The most common diagnoses of anxiety disorder were anxiety not otherwise specified (67%), panic disorder (14%), and generalized anxiety disorder (13%). The most commonly prescribed anxiolytics were benzodiazepines, such as alprazolam (43%) and lorazepam (27%). Hypertension was the most common nonpsychiatric comorbidity (22%) and depression the most common psychiatric comorbidity (37%). Other comorbidities observed were lipid disorders (17%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9%), and asthma (7%).

    "85": "Exercise training, like diazepam, is commonly employed as a means of reducing anxiety. Both diazepam and exercise training have been shown to modify carbohydrate and lipid metabolism as well as influence calcium metabolism in skeletal muscle. As receptor binding and thereby efficacy of diazepam has been demonstrated to be modulated by the lipid environment of the receptor, and changes in calcium levels can affect a number of intracellular signalling pathways, we sought to determine if the interaction of both chronic diazepam and exercise training would modify selected metabolic indices in an animal model. For this purpose, muscle and liver glycogen, blood glucose and plasma free fatty acids (FFA) were measured in sedentary, exercise trained and exercise trained, acutely exhausted animals. Alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism were observed in all experimental groups. Diazepam treatment alone exerts metabolic consequences, such as elevated muscle glycogen and plasma FFA and depressed blood glucose levels, which are similar to those observed with exercise training. When animals are acutely exercised to exhaustion, however, differences appear, including a reduced rise in plasma FFA, which suggests that long-term diazepam treatment does influence exercise metabolism, possibly as a result of effects on the sympatho-adrenal system.",

The paper presents a case of a 45-year-old man hospitalized in our department of neurology because of trunk muscles rigidity and painful, paroxysmal, immobilizing muscle spasms with excessive sweating. On the neurological examination he presented with a restricted range of active movements of the trunk, increased muscle tone in the shoulder girdle, abdominal and paraspinal muscles, as well as lumbar hyperlordosis. The electromyographic needle examination revealed in all his trunk muscles an excess, continuous motor unit activity at rest, diminishing after benzodiazepine administration. This confirmed our initial diagnosis based on clinical symptoms and signs. No abnormalities were found in other examinations, including the cerebrospinal fluid analysis, CT of the brain, and the spinal cord MRI.

Duration of such states may vary from one hour to a few weeks, with fluctuations and epileptic features in EEG recording (a typical pattern of spikes-slow waves, 3 Hz frequency, symmetrical and synchronical) that disappear after an intravenous injection of benzodiazepines. Absence status epilepticus can be evoked by toxic, metabolic or pharmacological factors as well as by convulsive epileptic seizures. Besides absence epileptic states of middle-cerebral origin there is a rising concern about absence status resulting from simple or complex partial seizures. Generalized non-convulsive status epilepticus following either simple partial or simple complex seizures is characterized by the presence of various focal signs associated with confusion, stupor or coma. The latter may be masking the clinical picture of an underlying cerebral pathology (e.g. brain tumor, hemorrhage, etc.), and epileptic changes can be seen in EEG recording only. Absence status epilepticus can occur in various forms of brain pathology, including stroke, brain tumors, traumatic lesions and other conditions, as well as in systemic diseases affecting the central nervous system function. Therefore, the authors emphasize the importance of electroencephalography in severely ill and unconscious patients, as well as the role of proper anti-epileptic treatment, as this may improve the outcome.", 
    "89": "Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition lasting more than 30 minutes in which continuous or recurrent seizure activity on the electroencephalogram (EEG) is responsible for diverse clinical symptoms including alteration of mental state, abnormal behaviour, perception disturbances or consciousness impairment. Most authors recognize two types of NCSE depending on the ictal electroencephalographic changes: generalized (absence status epilepticus) and complex partial status epilepticus (CPSE). In addition, there is also a simple form of partial status which is likely underdiagnosed because of its frequent progression to CPSE, subtle and varied symptomatology and high proportion of normal electroencephalograms (EEG). Absence status epilepticus (ASE) may occur in different clinical situations including idiopathic generalized epilepsy (typical AS), symptomatic generalized epilepsy (atypical AS), and elderly subjects without antecedents of epilepsy on chronic treatment with psychotropic drugs (de novo AS of late onset). Furthermore, CPSE is more frequent than previously mentioned. Although initially was equated with temporal lobe status epilepticus, extratemporal cases of CPSE have been well-documented, and the electroclinical characteristics of two types (I and II) of frontal CPSE have been recently described. NCSE may occur in patients with diverse clinical diagnosis such as hypoxic-anoxic encephalopathy, cancer, drugs, autoimmune disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, chromosomal alterations, peritoneal dialysis, infections, cerebral hamartomas or head trauma.",

To date, there is minimal published data and limited follow-up regarding the use of melatonin for patients with RBD associated with other neurologic syndromes and disorders.",

The reasons for using melatonin in these cases were incomplete response of RBD to clonazepam in six patients, existing cognitive impairment in five, intolerable side-effects with clonazepam in two, and presence of severe obstructive sleep apnea and narcolepsy in one. With seven patients continuing to use clonazepam at 0.5-1.0 mg/night, RBD was controlled in six patients, significantly improved in four, and initially improved but subsequently returned in two; no improvement occurred in one patient and increased RBD frequency/severity occurred in one patient. The effective melatonin doses were 3 mg in two cases, 6 mg in seven cases, 9 mg in one case, and 12 mg in two cases. Five patients reported side-effects, which included morning headaches (2), morning sleepiness (2), and delusions/hallucinations (1); these symptoms resolved with decreased dosage.

    "99": "The antiepileptic effect of clobazam was first described in 1973. The main advantages of clobazam as an antiepileptic drug are its fast-onset of action and effect against a wide variety of seizures. Despite sometimes losing its effectiveness after a previous period in which it has been effective, clobazam may keep its antiepileptic effect when used intermittently. Tolerance is much more common with benzodiazepines than the other antiepileptic drugs. Although tolerance to clobazam does occur, sustained responders have been identified, and many patients maintain their controlled seizures for several months. Clobazam is a safe drug, and its efficacy is probably equivalent to that of the new antiepileptic drugs. Therefore, it should be considered as add-on medication in the treatment of epilepsy. Clobazam is rapidly and completely absorbed and can be used intermittently, especially for catamenial epilepsy and in patients with clusters of seizures, but only during periods of seizure exacerbation.", 
    "100": "This paper addresses sleep, which to date has been a neglected area within the sociology of health and illness. We explore the extent to which the concepts of medicalization and healthicization provide appropriate models for understanding the management of women's sleep disruption. The prescription of sleeping pills remains as an indicator of the medicalization of sleep, while the trend towards the healthicization of sleep as part of healthy lifestyle practice is reflected in the increased focus of the media, pharmaceutical and complementary health care industries on sleep. The paper analyses qualitative data on women aged 40 and over to argue that the medicalization-healthicization framework fails to encapsulate a complete understanding of how women manage sleep disruption within the social context of their lives. It suggests that by looking inside the world of women's sleep we uncover a hidden dimension of self-directed personalized activity which plays a key role in women's response to sleep disruption. We propose an alternative model for the management of women's sleep which incorporates a core of personalised activity, linked to strategies associated with healthicization and medicalization.",

Data suggest that warfarin can be used as a safe and accurate biomarker for CYP2C9, and if warfarin is administered with vitamin K, the pharmacodynamic effect is ablated. Twelve subjects received the Cooperstown cocktail, warfarin plus vitamin K, and both sets of biomarkers (Cooperstown 5+1 cocktail) in a randomized crossover fashion. On the basis of log-transformed data and a paired t test, no significant difference was seen for S-warfarin area under the serum concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity (P =.09), omeprazole metabolic ratio (P =.374), caffeine metabolic ratio (P =.169 for CYP1A2 activity), midazolam plasma clearance (P =.573), or dextromethorphan metabolic ratio (P =.747) with the Cooperstown cocktail, warfarin plus vitamin K alone, or the Cooperstown 5+1 cocktail. During drug administration, the only side effect was mild and short-lived sedation after intravenous midazolam administration. Phenotypic measurements were in concordance with the subject's CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 genotypes.

The compounds were prepared with varying numbers of pyrrole and imidazole containing polyamides and incorporating glucose moieties in order to improve the water solubility of PBD-polyamide conjugates and probe the structural requirements for optimal in vitro antitumor activity. These compounds were tested against a panel of 60 human cancer cells by the National Cancer Institute, and demonstrated that the water soluble PBD-polyamide compounds exhibited a higher level of cytotoxic activity than the existing natural and synthetic pyrrolo [2,1-c][1,4] benzodiazepines. The cytotoxic activities of these compounds dramatically increase after hydrolysis of their acetylated counterparts. The activity data summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 show that the solubility of the PBD-polyamides and also the type of heterocycle play important roles influencing the cytotoxic activity of the PBD-polyamide conjugates.

However, the presence of PBR has not been examined in mesenchymal stem cells. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of PBR in human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs) and human adipose stromal cells (hATSCs) by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. To determine the roles of PBR in cellular functions of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), effects of diazepam, PK11195, and Ro5-4864 were examined. Adipose differentiation of hMSCs was decreased by high concentration of PBR ligands (50 microM), whereas it was increased by low concentrations of PBR ligands (<10 microM). PBR ligands showed a biphasic effect on glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity. High concentration of PBR ligands (from 25 to 75 microM) inhibited proliferation of hMSCs. However, clonazepam, which does not have an affinity to PBR, did not affect adipose differentiation and proliferation of hMSCs. The PBR ligands did not induce cell death in hMSCs. PK11195 (50 microM) and Ro5-5864 (50 microM) induced cell cycle arrest in the G(2)/M phase. These results indicate that PBR ligands play roles in adipose differentiation and proliferation of hMSCs.",

In all, 88% of subjects treated with olanzapine, 74% treated with risperidone, and 53% treated with haloperidol met response criteria. The primary side effects observed in all patients were mild to moderate sedation, extrapyramidal symptoms, and weight gain. Risperidone and olanzapine acutely reduced psychotic symptoms in this pediatric sample. Exploratory comparisons indicate the magnitude of the antipsychotic response with these atypical agents is comparable to that observed with haloperidol.

    "141": "In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which long-term treatment with clobazam (CLB), 1,5-benzodiazepine, induces thyroid follicular cell tumors in male rats, male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were treated orally with 400 mg/kg of CLB for up to 4 weeks, and the contribution of feedback through elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was investigated. Measurements taken after 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment revealed that thyroxine (T4)-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (T4-UDPGT) activity was higher than that of untreated animals. This change was accompanied by increase in liver weights and centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy. In addition, plasma total triiodothyronine (T3) and T4 levels were lower than in the untreated rats when measured after 1 week of treatment. However, a high plasma TSH level was sustained throughout the 4-week treatment. Thyroid follicular cell hypertrophy began after 1 week of treatment, followed by increased thyroid weight after 2 weeks. Clearance of exogenous [125I] T4 from the blood of treated rats, determined after 4 weeks of treatment, was significantly faster than that in untreated rats, whereas iodine uptake and organification in the thyroid glands were not affected. These results suggest that CLB increases hepatic T4-UDPGT activity leading to acceleration of T4-clearance, which results in decreased plasma thyroidal hormones followed by compensatory increase of TSH biosynthesis and secretion. Chronic high levels of TSH would exert a continuous growth pressure on the thyroid, under which hypertrophic follicular cells can ultimately progress to frank neoplasms.",

BZDs can impair cognitive function and may not aid sleep when taken continuously for years. This study therefore aimed to determine if withdrawing from BZDs leads to changes in patients' cognitive function, quality of life, mood and sleep.", 
    "143": "One hundred and ninety-two long-term users of BZD hypnotics, aged > or = 65 years, were identified in 25 general practices. One hundred and four who wished to withdraw were randomly allocated to one of two groups under double-blind, placebo controlled conditions: group A's BZD dose was tapered from week 1 of the trial; group B were given their usual dose for 12 weeks and then it was tapered. An additional group (C) of 35 patients who did not wish to withdraw from BZDs participated as 'continuers'. All patients were assessed at 0, 12 and 24 weeks and 50% were reassessed at 52 weeks.", 
    "144": "Sixty per cent of patients had taken BZDs continuously for > 10 years; 27% for > 20 years. Of all patients beginning the trial, 80% had successfully withdrawn 6 months later. There was little difference between groups A and B, but these groups differed from continuers (C) in that the performance of the withdrawers on several cognitive/psychomotor tasks showed relative improvements at 24 or 52 weeks. Withdrawers and continuers did not differ in sleep or BZD withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "145": "These results have clear implications for clinical practice. Withdrawal from BZDs produces some subtle cognitive advantages for older people, yet little in the way of withdrawal symptoms or emergent sleep difficulties. These findings also suggest that, taken long-term, BZDs do not aid sleep.",

A family of GABAA receptors has been identified, some of which are targets for therapeutic agents such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates and general anesthetics. Recently, novel transgenic approaches have been used to understand the function of receptor subtypes and, thereby, their therapeutic utility. Additionally, progress has been made in the development of novel receptor subtype-selective compounds. In this review, we will primarily focus on progress achieved in the understanding of the function of this receptor family, and potential exploitation for drug development.",

As a consequence of this expansion of the classification systems, the therapeutic utility of lithium and other mood stabilizing agents has to be defined anew. The majority treatment recommendations differentiate, symptom-related, between euphoric mania, mixed conditions, mania with psychotic symptoms and rapid cycling manic episodes. Current acute treatment includes, in addition to lithium, in particular carbamazepine and valproate, but also newer antiepileptic drugs such as lamotrigine or atypical neuroleptic agents such as olanzapine and risperidone. Due to the high suicidal risk, patients with bipolar depression often need to be given an antidepressant as well. It must, however, be remembered that in patients with rapid cycling, antidepressants may re-trigger mania.",

The present article describes the typical problems encountered by family doctors treating such patients, and offers practical tips and suggestions. Points of special emphasis are, how to relate to acutely ill schizophrenics, depending on the type of schizophrenia presenting (maniform-aggressive, delusional or hallucinatory), emergency psychopharmacological treatment in acute schizophrenic psychosis, detection of emergent schizophrenia as early as possible, local facilities available to help the schizophrenic patient.",

With respect of the different neurobiologic and psychologic factors of panic attacks the therapy should be complex. Psychotherapy (e.g. behavior therapy) and psychopharmacologic treatments were proved very well. For the general practitioner the treatment with SSRI is very helpful. This approach provides a 60% full remission. For an uncomplicated disorder prophylactic treatment is necessary.", 
    "151": "This study examined the effect of the p.o. administration of the putative atypical antipsychotic drug Y-931 (8-fluoro-12-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6H-[1]benzothieno[2,3b][1,5] benzodiazepine maleate) on the activity of spontaneously active dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) in anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. This was accomplished using in vivo electrophysiology. The acute p.o. administration of Y-931 did not significantly alter the number of spontaneously active SNC DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated animals. A single p.o. administration of 3 and 10 mg/kg of Y-931 significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the number of spontaneously active VTA DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated animals. The acute administration of 3 mg/kg of Y-931 significantly altered the firing pattern parameters for all spontaneously active SNC DA. The 3 and 10 mg/kg doses of Y-931 significantly increased the degree of bursting and irregular activity of spontaneously active VTA and SNC DA neurons firing in a bursting pattern. The repeated p.o. administration (21 days) of 1, 3, or 10 mg/kg of Y-931 significantly decreased the number of spontaneously active VTA DA neurons but had no significant effect on SNC DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated animals. The repeated administration of Y-931 did not significantly alter the firing pattern of all spontaneously active SNC or VTA DA neurons. Our findings indicate that the acute and chronic administration of Y-931 significantly alters the activity of midbrain DA neurons in rats and the electrophysiological profile of chronic Y-931 resembles that of atypical antipsychotic agents.",

Behaviors were scored on a 5-point sedation scale before and during procedures. Proportions manifesting successful sedation and postprocedure agitation were compared between the 2 doses.", 
    "154": "Sixty-five patients (32 SDM, 33 HDM) underwent sedated procedures (repair of lacerations, 97%). Behavior scores improved for both groups following medication administration and at best sedation during procedure. HDM produced better sedation at time of first suture (successful sedation: 70%, SDM vs. 91%, HDM; intergroup difference = 21%; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2, 41) and at best point during the procedure (72%, SDM vs. 97%, HDM; Delta = 25%; 95% CI = 8, 43). However, sedative efficacy declined such that only 50% and 73% of the SDM and HDM groups, respectively, had successful sedation at the worst point during the procedures. Postprocedure agitation occurred in 17% of patients (6%, SDM vs. 27%, HDM; Delta = 21%; 95% CI = 3, 39).",

However, inadequate sedation in 27-50% of patients and prolonged agitation in 27% of patients at higher doses counter the advantages of rectal midazolam.", 
    "156": "The purpose of this study was to determine the differences in measurable outcomes following aesthetic procedures performed under intravenous sedation with incremental doses of midazolam and fentanyl and those performed under propofol infusion. The authors' hypothesis was that the differences in these outcome parameters are not significant between these intravenous sedation protocols. All intraoperative and perioperative records of 84 consecutive patients having aesthetic surgery under a conscious sedation protocol using incremental doses of intravenous midazolam and fentanyl were retrospectively reviewed and compared with the records of a second group of 85 patients having aesthetic surgery under a deep sedation regimen based primarily on propofol infusion. All procedures were hospital based and performed by two surgeons. Twenty-eight different parameters were examined by chart review. In addition, a patient questionnaire was used to assess patient satisfaction and patient recall of operative and perioperative pain, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. Multivariate statistical analysis was conducted. The two sedation groups were similar with regard to aesthetic procedures performed and patient demographics. The mean duration of operative time was statistically equivalent (152 minutes and 153 minutes). In both groups, there were minor adverse intraoperative events reported but no significant complications. Transient hypotension was more common in the propofol infusion group (12.9 percent versus 2.4 percent, p = 0.018), but no patient required intervention beyond reducing the sedative agent or increasing intravenous fluids. The amount of supplemental fentanyl given intraoperatively was significantly higher in the group whose primary agent for sedation was propofol infusion than the group who received midazolam/fentanyl (209 mug and 143 mug, respectively). The overall questionnaire response rate was 80 percent for both groups. The midazolam/fentanyl sedation group had more recall of \"unpleasant intraoperative events\" (17 percent versus 3 percent, p = 0.007). However, both groups had low recall of intraoperative pain, anxiety, and nausea. The propofol infusion group experienced significantly more nausea in the recovery room (p = 0.002), nausea at the time of discharge (p = 0.009), and nausea the evening after the operation (p = 0.013). Greater than 90 percent of the patients in both groups would have the same anesthetic in the future rather than undergo general anesthesia. Patient safety, outcomes, and satisfaction are similar in plastic surgery procedures performed under sedation protocols using either incremental doses of midazolam and fentanyl or propofol infusion. All operative and postoperative outcomes for pain, anxiety, and vomiting were similar in the two groups except for immediate postoperative nausea, which was higher in the propofol infusion group. The overall satisfaction of patients undergoing plastic surgery procedures under these intravenous sedation protocols appears very high.", 
    "157": "Melatonin, a major hormone secreted by the pineal gland, is known to play an important role in regulation of the circadian rhythm. (N-[3-(3-cyanopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-7-yl)phenyl]-N-ethylacetamide (zaleplon) is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic that acts via the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor. In the present study, we investigated the effect of zaleplon on melatonin secretion in rabbits using RIA and compared the effect to triazolam and zopiclone. Zaleplon increased a dose-dependent concentration of melatonin in rabbit plasma collected at 30 min after intravenous administration at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg. The zaleplon-induced increase in plasma melatonin level was not blocked by flumazenil, a benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist. In contrast, triazolam and zopiclone failed to affect the plasma melatonin level. We also investigated the effect of zaleplon on intracellular cAMP in rat pinealocytes. Consequently, zaleplon had no effect on the intracellular cAMP levels in rat pinealocytes. These results of the present studies suggest that zaleplon may promote melatonin secretion and the elevation of plasma levels of melatonin may suggest an influence of zaleplon on chronobiology.", 
    "158": "Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a gradual decline in memory. The occurrence of Alzheimer's disease is commonplace among the Asian population, particularly among senior citizens. The present study was undertaken to assess the potential of ascorbic acid as a memory-enhancer. Swiss mice of either sex were employed in the present investigation. Elevated plus-maze and passive-avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models, and diazepam-, scopolamine-, and aging-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. Ascorbic acid (60, 120 mg/kg) injected for 3 and 8 consecutive days improved learning and memory of aged mice as indicated by decreased transfer-latency and increased step-down latency. Furthermore, ascorbic acid provided protection to the young animals from scopolamine- and diazepam-induced impairment of memory. Ascorbic acid was found to be more potent than piracetam as reflected by the smaller dose, more pronounced effect, and quicker onset of action. Ascorbic acid has shown promise as a powerful memory-improving agent particularly effective in aged animals. Hence, ascorbic acid might prove to be a useful memory-restorative agent in the treatment of dementia seen in elderly individuals. The underlying mechanism of action of ascorbic acid may be attributed to its antioxidant property.", 
    "159": "Flumazenil (FLU), a benzodiazepine (BZD) partial agonist with a weak intrinsic activity, was previously found unable to precipitate withdrawal in tolerant subjects submitted to long-lasting BZD treatment. The potential use of FLU to treat BZD withdrawal symptoms has also been evaluated tentatively in clinical studies. In the present experiment, FLU (treatment A) was compared with oxazepam tapering (treatment B) and placebo (treatment C) in the control of BZD withdrawal symptoms in three groups of BZD dependent patients. Group A patients (20) received FLU 1 mg twice a day for 8 days, and oxazepam 30 mg in two divided doses (15 mg + 15 mg) during the first night, oxazepam 15 mg during the second night and oxazepam 7.5 mg during the third night. FLU was injected i.v. in saline for 4 hours in the morning and 4 hours in the afternoon, in association with placebo tablets. Group B patients (20) were treated by tapering of oxazepam dosage (from 120 mg) and with saline solution (as placebo) instead of FLU for 8 days. Group C patients (10) received saline instead of FLU and placebo tablets instead of oxazepam for 8 days. FLU immediately reversed BZD effects on balance task and significantly reduced withdrawal symptoms in comparison with oxazepam and placebo on both self-reported and observer-rated withdrawal scales. The partial agonist also reduced craving scores during the detoxification procedure. In addition, during oxazepam tapering, group B patients experienced paradoxical symptoms that were not apparent in FLU patients. Patients treated with FLU showed a significantly lower relapse rates on days 15, 23 and 30 after the detoxification week. Our data provide further evidence of FLUs ability to counteract BZD effects, control BZD withdrawal and normalize BZD receptor function. The effectiveness of FLU may reflect its capacity to upregulate BZD receptors and to reverse the uncoupling between the recognition sites of BZD and GABA, on the GABA(A) macromolecular complex, that has been reported in tolerant subjects.", 
    "160": "An increase in GABA uptake by isolated rat brain synaptic endings as well as a decrease of pharmacologically active GABA analogue muscimol specific binding have indicated a physiologically drastic failure in realization of GABA-mediated inhibitory effects in CNS induced by diabetic encephalopathy. In spite of the impairment of inhibitory function of GABAergic transmission in diabetes a crucial activation of benzodiazepine receptors was determined, as it is tested by the increase in specific binding of flunitrazepam by synaptic membranes. This increase may play an important role in endogenous control of neural activity associated with the factors undefined so far. Using the approach that GABA, and several synthetic GABA agonists, appear to increase the affinity of the benzodiazepine recognition sites for such ligands, presumably by some allosteric mechanism, the findings concerning the in vitro binding assay technique confirm at least some of the functional characteristics observed between GABA and benzodiazepine receptors in vivo under pathological conditions. Indeed, the absence of activating effect on the affinity of flunitrazepam specific binding in the presence of micromolar concentrations of exogenous GABA implicate diabetes-induced alterations in coupling GABA- and benzodiazepine receptors that might be linked to changes in conformantial state of this membrane-bound complex and could partially explain diabetes-induced impairments of GABAergic transmission evaluated in the present study. Our study suggests that nicotinamide and especially GABA play an important role in improving the functioning of brain GABA-benzodiazepine complex impaired in diabetes through specific ligand-mediated mechanism and can be useful in the management of diabetes-associated brain failures.", 
    "161": "The evidence that ethanol abuse can lead to pancreatitis is overwhelming, but the mechanism(s) by which ethanol causes pancreatic injury and pancreatitis are not known. Many studies have focused on short-term effects of ethanol administration on exocrine pancreatic function, but the results reported have been variable and no clear picture has emerged. Attempts to induce pancreatitis by long-term ethanol administration have, for the most part, failed. We evaluated the effects of ethanol administration on pancreatic secretion of digestive enzymes. These studies indicate that administration of ethanol results in a transient increase in pancreatic amylase output and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) levels. This phenomenon is mediated by a trypsin-sensitive CCK-releasing factor that is present within the duodenal lumen. These observations lead us to speculate that repeated CCK-mediated, ethanol-induced stimulation of pancreatic digestive enzyme secretion may play a role in the events that link ethanol abuse to the development of pancreatic injury.", 
    "162": "KCNQ1 alpha-subunits coassemble with KCNE1 beta-subunits to form channels that conduct the slow delayed rectifier K+ current (IKs) important for repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in KCNQ1 reduce IKs and cause long-QT syndrome, a disorder of ventricular repolarization that predisposes affected individuals to arrhythmia and sudden death. Current therapy for long-QT syndrome is inadequate. R-L3 is a benzodiazepine that activates IKs and has the potential to provide gene-specific therapy. In the present study, we characterize the molecular determinants of R-L3 interaction with KCNQ1 channels, use computer modeling to propose a mechanism for drug-induced changes in channel gating, and determine its effect on several long-QT syndrome-associated mutant KCNQ1 channels heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Scanning mutagenesis combined with voltage-clamp analysis indicated that R-L3 interacts with specific residues located in the 5th and 6th transmembrane domains of KCNQ1 subunits. Most KCNQ1 mutant channels responded to R-L3 similarly to wild-type channels, but one mutant channel (G306R) was insensitive to R-L3 possibly because it disrupted a key component of the drug-binding site.", 
    "163": "This study analyzed the effects of acute and long-term diazepam treatments on rat peripheral blood neutrophil activity and cortisol serum levels. Rats were acutely and long-term (21 days, once daily) treated with diazepam (10 mg/kg) or its vehicle (1.0 ml/kg). Blood was collected 1 h after treatments for flow cytometric analysis of neutrophil oxidative burst and phagocytosis. Corticosterone and diazepam concentrations were also determined. Results showed that: (1) both diazepam treatments increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced neutrophil oxidative burst; (2) the increase in oxidative burst after Staphylococcus aureus induction in acutely treated animals was higher than that observed after long-term treatment; (3) phagocytosis is increased by acute diazepam treatment and decreased by a long-term regimen; (4) acute, but not long-term, diazepam treatment increased corticosterone levels; (5) diazepam plasmatic levels after acute and long-term treatments were not different. These results indicate the development of tolerance to diazepam effects on corticosterone serum levels but not on neutrophil activity.", 
    "164": "The anxiolytic-like effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) and its four terpenoid components (ginkgolide-A, ginkgolide-B, ginkgolide-C, and bilobalide) were assessed using the elevated plus-maze test in mice. Administration of GBE as a single oral dose (0.5 or 1 g/kg, po) caused a state of suppressed motor activity and, thus, shortened the time spent in the open-sided arms. However, when GBE (0.063-1 g/kg, po) was administered daily for 7 days and the plus-maze test was carried out 24 h after the final administration, the time spent in the open-sided arms was prolonged, with the peak anxiolytic-like effect at 0.125 g/kg. A combination of seven-day administration of GBE (0.125 g/kg) and a single dose of diazepam (1 mg/ kg, po, 10 min before testing) enhanced the anxiolytic-like effect. Flumazenil (0.3 mg/kg, ip, 10 min before testing) blocked the effect of diazepam, but not of GBE. Daily administration of ginkgolide-A (1 or 2 mg/kg, po) resulted in an anxiolytic-like effect by the third treatment, with the maximal effect observed after the fifth administration. Neither ginkgolide-B, ginkgolide-C, nor bilobalide produced any anxiolytic-like effects. At doses higher than 0.5 g/kg, GBE not only inhibited motor activity but also suppressed active avoidance behavior, reduced caffeine-induced stimulation, and enhanced pentobarbital-induced sleep, while ginkgolide-A (up to 20 mg/kg) did not exhibit these effects. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) is known to enhance pentobarbital-induced sleep. These results suggest that GBE produces a significant anxiolytic-like effect following repeated administration and that ginkgolide-A is most likely responsible for this effect. There are also indications that although GBE exerts a sedative effect at comparatively higher doses, ginkgolide-A has a relatively weak tendency to produce benzodiazepine-like side effects.",

    "169": "To describe an institutional procedure for ventilator withdrawal and to analyze patient responses to terminal extubation, the medical records of 21 patients who underwent withdrawal of mechanical ventilation according to the process followed by an interdisciplinary palliative care team were retrospectively reviewed. The cohort was a convenience sample of sequentially treated patients in a 1048-bed urban university-affiliated medical center. Sixteen of the 21 patients were on medical or surgical floors and five patients were in critical care units. Patients were assessed for discomfort, such as dyspnea, agitation, or anxiety. Sedative and analgesic medications were administered based on clinical parameters. Palliative care clinician observations of patient reports, tachypnea,use of accessory muscles, and signs of discomfort such as agitation or anxiety were recorded for the first 4 hours after extubation. Medication use and length of survival were recorded. Fifty-seven percent were symptomatic during the extubation process and required administration of either a benzodiazepine or opioid medication. The median survival of the 18 patients who died post-extubation was 0.83 hours (interquartile range 0.5-43.8). Bolus doses of opioid or benzodiazepine medications were effective for management of symptoms in about two-thirds of patients. One-third of patients required continuous infusions. Eighteen patients died following extubation in the medical center, and three of these patients were transferred to an inpatient hospice unit. Three patients (14%) survived to discharge from the hospital. The procedure followed provides a foundation for collaboration between palliative care and critical care services to ensure continuity of care across clinical settings/units."
