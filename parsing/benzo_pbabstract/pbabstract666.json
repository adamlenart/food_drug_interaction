The compound showed sleep-inducing effect at both 0.2 and 5 mg/kg (p.o.) in cynomolgus monkeys or at 3 mg/kg (p.o.) in rats. CS-430 showed selective conflict attenuating in rats or anticonvulsant effects in mice. Furthermore, CS-430 blocked non-discriminated (Sidman) avoidance response without severe impairment of the motor function but not discriminated (shuttle-box) avoidance response in rats. CS-430 also blocked selectively electroshock-induced fighting behavior of mice but not isolation-induced fighting behavior of mice and muricidal behavior induced by ablation of the olfactory bulbs. In addition, CS-430 produced specific potentiation of chlorprothixene-induced sleep and particular potentiation of thiopental sleep in mice. These effects of CS-430 were similar to those of nitrazepam, but differed from those of phenobarbital. The effect of CS-430 on the motor function was roughly 1/2 as potent as that of nitrazepam in the various tests.", 
    "1": "The neuroleptics chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, triflupromazine and thioridazine seem to effect the aggregation of glutamate dehydrogenase by binding to one single site of the polypeptide chain, possibly the GTP site. This interaction could biologically be of importance for the degree of activity at high enzyme concentrations found in vivo. Amitriptyline and fluorazepam also bind to a specific single site of the polypeptide chain without effecting the aggregation of the oligomers. Because of the rather low affinity of these sites the binding of these drugs in vivo does not seem to cause a concentrating effect in the mitochondria.", 
    "2": "The effect of a barbiturate, Sodium thiopental (Nesdonal), on the cerebral circulation in 13 patients with a cerebral ischemic attack is studied. Its action is compared to the action of other intravenous anesthetics (Alfat\u00e9sine - Etomidate - diazanalg\u00e9sie) used in neuro-anesth\u00e9sia. The study is on a total of thirty patients. The regional cerebral blood flow (RCBF) is measured by the intra-carotid injection of Xe133. The anesthetics studied acted like vasoconstrictive agents on the healthy brain. They diminish the RCBF. At the leel of ischemic lesions the response is abolished, even inversed : the flow remains unchanged, even increases. It is the inverse steal syndrome. This action, comparable to the action of hypocapnia, has both a diagnostic and a prognostic value.", 
    "3": "A series of compounds endowed with gastric antisecretory activity were examined for their possible effects on histamine H2 receptors in different experimental conditions. The data obtained suggest that, apart from cimetidine, all the other compounds are devoid of antagonistic properties on H2 receptors. The inhibitory effect observed in some of the examined preparations is probably connected with unspecific actions.", 
    "4": "The authors studied salivary pH at different sites in 172 patients receiving psychotropic therapy in hospital. For statistical purposes, the study was limited to individuals receiving a \"moderate\" dose of: --a benzodiazepine derivative --a neuroleptic and benzodiazepine --antidepressant, neuroleptic and benzodiazepine. Regardless of the type of psychotropic therapy and of the site of measurement, acidification of salivary pH which was statistically significant in comparison with values found in healthy subjects was noted. This acidification was particularly marked with regard to \"lingual\" pH. In addition, regardless of the site of measurement, a higher degree of acidification of salivary pH was seen in individuals receiving a combination of psychotropic agents. This acidification was particularly striking with regard to salivary pH in patients given a combination of antidepressant, neuroleptic and a benzodiazepine derivative. The cause of this acidification is not definitely known. A number of hypotheses may be put forward: decrease in salivary volume (Laudenbach, 6, and Vermeil, 7), excretion of acid metabolites by the salivary glands, effect of psychotropic agents upon the action itself of the salivary glands.", 
    "5": "The authors present a method of estimation of dipotassium clorazepate by gas chromatography with a detector for electron capture. It requires 2 ml of blood. Two separate extractions are necessary, including one immediately after the sampling to determine the nordiazepam present at the time of the blood sample. The second extraction permits one to determine the total nordiazepam obtained by transformation of all the dipotassium clorazepate. This method is simple and rapid and permits one to determine with precision, specificity and good reproducibility (CV -- 3%) the therapeutic concentrations of this drug.", 
    "6": "The therapeutical effect of Tranxilium was studied in an open multicenter study by 66 general practitioners and 26 specialists. 1.027 patients were treated with Tranxilium 20, given in a single dose at night, for a period of three weeks. During this time, the patient's psychic status and functional organic disorders were assessed by means of rating scales. A complete medical assessment followed at the end of the study. States of anxiety, restlessness, depressive mood, irritation and insomnia as well as functional organic disorders improved significantly (p is less than 0.001) already after the first week of treatment. At the end of treatment, with the majority of patients the above symptoms had either completely disappeared or were found only to a small extent. In 85% of the patients, all investigators rated the stabilization and brightening effect on psychic conditions as well as the harmonizing effect on disturbed organic functions as \"very good\" to \"good\". In 89% of the patients, the overall therapeutic success was judged as \"very good\" to \"good\". The overall tolerance was excellent in 96% of the cases.", 
    "7": "A double-blind crossover trial was carried out in 31 hospitalized elderly patients receiving night-time sedation to compare the effects of flunitrazepam (0.5 mg) and meprobamate (200 mg). After 1 week on placebo, patients received 1-week's treatment with each drug in random order. Quality of sleep was assessed by a nurse at hourly intervals over 8 hours each night. In 11 patients, the results were compared with those from kymographic recordings measuring patient restlessness (motility index). No statistically significant difference was found between the two active drug treatments, and there was a close correlation between the two methods of assessment. It is suggested that the kymograph may well be a useful and economic method of evaluating the effectiveness of hypnotics.", 
    "8": "An open study was carried out in 21 chronic alcoholics with severe withdrawal symptoms and incipient delirium tremens to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant treatment with intramuscular lorazepam (5mg). All symptoms subsided within 2 hours after a single injection and remained under control with oral lorazepam (mean daily dose 7 mg). No adverse reactions attributable to lorazepam were observed.", 
    "9": "The report contains data concerning clinical studies of a new Soviet tranquilizer of benzodiazepine derivative--phenazepam. Treatment of 100 patients gave a good therapeutical effect in 82%. The best results were attained in the treatment of generalized hystero-neurotical states, somewhat less in the group of neurotic states with a prevalence of affective disorders and the less effective in the obsessive-phobic syndrome. On the basis of comparative studies, the conclusion is made that phenazepam is not worse by its psychotropic activity than ativan (lorazepam) and exceeds diazepam (seduxen), most likely because of its myorelaxing action. The drug exerted an expressed hypnotic effect being not less than eunoctin and other eunectics.", 
    "10": "Seventy-six out-patient insomniacs participated in three different two-night, double-blind crossover trials investigating the hypnotic efficacy andsafety of triazolam. Triazolam 0.5 mg was compared to placebo in one trial conducted K Kay Okawa, MD, and triazolam 0.5 mg was compared to secobarbital 100 mg in trials conducted by K Kay Okawa, MD and George S Allen, MD. The results of the later two studies were combined and the data analyzed jointly. Triazolam 0.5 mg was found to be preferred and to be significantly better than both placebo and secobarbital 100 mg in the treatment of insomnia. Analysis of sleep questionnaire data showed triazolam to be superior to either placebo or secobarbital on the following parameters: how much the medication helped the patients sleep; onset of sleep; duration of sleep; and number of nocturnal awakenings. No differences were observed between treatments in any trial with regard to the patient's feeling of alertness the next morning. The side-effects reported for all treatments did not significantly interfere with the patient's ability to function.", 
    "11": "The short-term hypnotic efficacy of triazolam was compared to that of flurazepam and placebo in 120 out-patient insomniacs. Each patient was studied with a two-night, double-blind crossover trial. Triazolam (0.5 mg) was compared to placebo and flurazepam (30 mg). Triazolam (0.25 mg) was compared to flurazepam (15 mg and 30 mg). Triazolam (0.5 mg) was preferred to both placebo and flurazepam (30 mg). Triazolam (0.5 mg) was superior to placebo in improving quality of sleep, shortening sleep onset, increasing sleep duration, and reducing the number of night-time awakenings. Triazolam (0.5 mg) was superior to flurazepam (30 mg) in speeding sleep onset and increasing the quality of sleep. Triazolam (0.25 mg) was preferred to flurazepam (15 mg) and was significantly better than flurazepam on all sleep questions. Triazolam (0.25 mg) was preferred by more patients than flurazepam (30 mg) and was judged equally efficacious on individual sleep questions. Reports of side-effects were minimal for both drugs.", 
    "12": "The effectiveness of benzodiazepines and anticholinergics administered alone or in combination in preventing restraint-immersion and forced exertion-induced gastric mucosal erosion was investigated in mice. The benzodiazepines used were diazepam and chlordiazepoxide HCI and the anticholinergics were propantheline bromide and clidinium bromide. The administratio of a benzodiazepine with an anticholinergic resulted in additive or supra-additive protective effects in both systems. In the restraint-immersion system, diazepam combined with propantheline bromide at a ratio of 1 to 13.7 yielded a 4.53-fold supra-additive effect. At ratios of 4.6 or 1.5 parts of propantheline bromide to 1 part of diazepam an additive effect was observed. One part of diazepam, when combined with 1.4 to 12.0 parts of clidinium bromide resulted in supra-additive effects of about 1.5-fold. The co-administration of chlordiazepoxide HCI and clidinium bromide in ratios of 2 to 1 or 2.5 to 1 resulted in supra-additive effects of 2.4- and 1.85-fold, respectively. At higher and lower ratios additive effects were demonstrated. In the forced exertion system, diazepam combined with either anticholinergic resulted in supra-additive effects of 2- to 3-fold which occurred at ratios of diazepam to the anticholinergic varying over an 8-fold range. The co-administration of 2 parts of chlordiazepoxide HCI and 1 part of clidinium bromide resulted in a 2.84-fold supra-additive effect in the forced exertion system. These results are discussed in relation to the use of benzodiazepine anticholinergic combinations in the treatment of human gastric and duodenal ulcer disease.", 
    "13": "Administration of a single dose (10 mg/kg) of a relatively new benzodiazepine, bromazepam to rats markedly suppressed their spontaneous locomotor activity. Hypomobility became apparent 15 min after the injection and remained significantly lower during the period of observation for 6 hours when locomotor activity was 27% of controls. Following 2 hours after bromazepam treatment, no change was noted in tyrosine levels and tyrosine hydroxylase activity in striatum or rate of catecholamine synthesis in synaptosomal preparation (P2 pellet). However, the endogenous levels of norepinephrine, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine were significantly increased not only in several brain areas examined, but also in P2 pellet. Bromazepam failed to change 3H-norepinephrine and 3H-5-hydroxytryptamine uptake in synaptosomes suggesting that the increased levels of monoamines are not related to laterations in uptake mechanisms, but probably to a diminished release. This is supported by the data on striatal homovanillic acid and whole brain 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl glycol whose concentrations were significantly lowered following a single injection of this benzodiazepine. However, bromazepam increased 5-hydroxyindole-acetic acid levels in hypothalamus, mid-brain and pons-medulla. The present study demonstrates that bromazepam elicits its tranquilizing action by lowering the release of catecholamines in brain; however, its anti-anxiety action might be associated with a reduction in 5-hydroxytryptamine turn over. Our data also suggest that bromazepam is almost as potent as diazepam in altering the metabolism of certain putative neurotransmitters in brain.", 
    "14": "In 156 experiments performed on 41 cats with adequate experimental models of pseudoneurotic conditions, states of anxiety due to an electrostimulation of the hypothalamus through implanted electrodes and an emotional stress due to a conflict situation the authors compared the individual traits of the psychotropic activity of lorazepam, diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, nirazepam. These experiments permitted to display significant differences of psychophysiological structures in the tranquilizing effect of 5 benzodiazepine derivatives.", 
    "15": "Following 4 weeks of treatment with ORF-8063 a polyfluorinated benzodiazepine derivative, 8 hospitalized patients manifesting a primary pathology of anxiety showed marked general improvement. 2 other persons were treated, but for shorter periods: 9 and 14 days. Both are included in the pre-post analysis. Mean optimal dosage was 66.5 mg. The five instruments used to measure therapeutic effect showed pre- to posttreatment change with high level of statistical significance in serveral of the pathological factors. When measures of change are considered, patients showed more improvement related to psychic than somatic components of anxiety. Change data also indicates more patients improvement in anxiety than depression. Side effects reported more were dizziness, faintness and insomnia; these were reported in 8 patients. 6 patients noted drowsiness, and 4 noted excitement. 5 persons tolerated optimum dosages with no extreme reactions; 5 others (including the 2 subjects who terminated treatment early) were unable to maintain optimum dosages because of side effects.", 
    "16": "A multiple step-search regression procedure was applied to data obtained with 37 diazepam and 42 halazepam treated anxious outpatients. Good treatment outcome was predicted for those patients who reported a more adequate family adjustment, the presence of precipitating stress, and who either had no prior psychotropic drug treatment, or if they had received such treatment, had experienced a good response. Probably of greatest interest to the practicing clinician was the observation that patients high in initial anxiety but low in initial interpersonal problems improved the most with both medications. Differential drug effects indicated halazepam to do particularly poorly in less anxious patients and in those patients given a good prognosis by the doctor. Diazepam response was much less affected by these variables. It is speculated that the excessive sedating effect of the daily halazepam dosage (160 mg/d) used in this study may explain these differential drug effects. In the dosages employed, namely, diazepam 20 mg/d and halazepam 160 mg/d, diazepam produced the more consistent anti-anxiety effects. The indication that halazepam 160 mg/d was more effective than diazepam 20 mg/d in the initially sicker patients, while of interest, is probably simply a dose-related phenomenon, indicating that diazepam 20 mg/d was too low a daily dosage for severely anxious patients, a fact well known by most clinicians.", 
    "17": "Diazepam (8 mg/kg) quickly and effectively reduced the incidence of withdrawal symptoms in phenobarbital dependent C57BL/6J male mice. In contrast, the neuroleptic agents employed (chlorpormazine, haloperidol, or reserpine) or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine tended to exacerbate the withdrawal syndrome. Chlorpromazine and haloperidol were approximately equally potent in their effects; this would suggest that their antidopaminergic effects were not the primary mechanism of action for the increased incidence of withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "18": "The pharmacological differences between the behavioural effects of 7-chloro-1-propargyl-5-phenyl-3H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (pinazepam) and diazepam were investigated in rats. Pinazepam was more than twice as active as diazepam at a dose range between 1.25--10 mg/kg in reducing the conditioned emotional response (CER). Only at doses of 2.5 and 5 mg/kg prevented pinazepam the disruption of the avoidance responses induced by inverting the conditioned stimulus (CS). On the other hand pinazepam was less active than diazepam in reducing the number of avoidance responses in a conditioned avoidance situation. Neither pinazepam nor diazepam disrupted the conditioned responses in a fixed-interval operant behaviour.", 
    "19": "After the preliminary successful use of injectable lorazepam in calming 20 patients who presented with acute anxiety crises, a formal study of 115 other such patients was carried out. All were seen either in a hospital emergency room or on an emergency out-patient basis in private practice. Treatment consisted of an initial intravenous injection of lorazepam (3mg) followed, if necessary, by up to three further injections within a 24-hour period. The result was usually dramatic: complete abolition or reasonable control of symptoms within 30 minutes in all but 2 patients. The major effect was relaxant and sedative; 62 patients slept following the injections. although 55 could be easily aroused, 7 could not. Of the other patients, 49 remained awake but relaxed; only 4 remained tense and were regarded as treatment failures. No significant side-effects or changes in vital signs were noted. The results support and extend those reported by other invesigators in a recent controlled, double-blind (but otherwise similarly conducted) trial.", 
    "20": "Efficacy and side effects of flurazepam 15 mg, fosazepam 60 mg, and nitrazepam 5 mg were studied in 17 psychogeriatric patients. The drugs were equipotent in maintaining sleep but nitrazepam had more side effects than the other hypnotics, and it induced a rebound insomnia after withdrawal. All hypnotics lost some of their efficacy towards the end of 7 days' administration. Patients with evident cerebrovascular disease were vulnerable to the side effects of the benzodiazepine hypnotics. The side effects did not correlate with the age of a patient. In addition, no correlations were found between the serum levels of fosazepam or its main metabolite and the side effects.", 
    "21": "Pentobarbital (30 and 60 mg/kg) and chloral hydrate (300 and 600 mg/kg) administered in anesthetic/hypnotic doses produced significant increases in acetylcholine concentration in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus and brainstem. Hypnotic/anxiolytic agents like diazepam, flurazepam (100 mg/kg each) and triazolam (30 mg/kg) significantly increased the acetylcholine concentration only in the cerebral cortex and striatum. Alprazolam and ketazolam had no significant effect on regional distribution of acetylcholine in the brain. The results have been discussed with respect to the role of central cholinergic system in anesthetic and hypnotic actions of these drugs.", 
    "22": "Plasma lorazepam levels were studied following single doses of 2 mg and 4 mg in patients and volunteers. There was a slightly more rapid uptake of drug following deep intramuscular injection than when taken by mouth. Plasma levels declined rapidly following intravenous injection (t1/2 of approximately 2-3 hours). Two hours after giving the drug the plasma levels were similar irrespective of the route of administration. The second phase decline was very slow and one third of the peak concentration was still in the blood at 24 hours.", 
    "23": "Moderate or severe depression is now one of the most common diseases of our time with a prevalence of nearly 3%. It seems likely that this prevalence has increased as a result of the wider use of drugs which have an effect on the neurotransmitters. Changes in the levels of these neurotransmitters in the central nervous system are thought to be the biochemical basis for the development of at least some depressive illnesses. Drug-induced depressions are more likely to occur in those individuals who are genetically predisposed to depression or who have had a previous depressive illness. Other groups who are particularly susceptible to these effects are the elderly. Many groups of drugs have a primary or secondary action on the central nervous system neurotransmitter function. Some 200 drugs have been claimed to cause depression in certain patients, but only a relatively small number precipitate depressive symptoms with any frequency. Those most commonly implicated are the long-acting antipsychotics, barbiturates, ethanol, oral contraceptives and antihypertensive agents. It is important to remember that some drugs, such as reserpine, cause depression as a side-effect during their therapeutic use whereas others, such as fenfluramine, cause depression mainly when they are withdrawn too rapidly. In those patients presenting with depression, it is important to review the current drug therapy in order to assess the part played by these drugs in the development of the depression. Following this assessment, drug therapy should be adjusted appropriately. However, a distinction must be made between the symptoms of depression, those physiological changes which occur during treatment with a variety of drugs, and the patient's reaction to the disease for which they are being treated.", 
    "24": "A previously established rat model has been utilized to demonstrate that an acute inflammatory response occurs after high intravenous doses of lorazepam. This occurs only with high concentrations of drug equivalent to 20 times the normal clinical dosage in man. In contract, water soluble RO 21-3981 produces no vascular pathology in any dosage evaluated. It appears that propylene glycol may play a role in the pathogenesis of the intravascular injury observed.", 
    "25": "A sensitive and specific electron-capture gas--liquid chromatographic (GLC--ECD) assay was developed for the determination of 8-chloro-6-(2'-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo(1,5a)(1,4)benzodiazepine (I) or 8-chloro-1,4-dimethyl-6-(2'-fluorophenyl)-4H-imidazo (1,5a)(1,4)benzodiazepine (II) in blood. The assay for both compounds involves extraction into benzene--methylene chloride (9:1) from blood buffered to pH 12.6 The overall recovery of I and II from blood is 86% +- 5.0 (S.D.) and the sensitivity limit of detection is of the order of 2 to 3 ng of I or II per milliltre of blood. The major urinary metabolite of I is 8-chloro-6-(2'-fluorophenyl)-1-hydroxymethyl-4H-imidazo(1,5a)(1,4)benzodiazepine, (IA) present as a glucuronide conjugate while 8-chloro-6-(2'-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxyl-1-methyl-4H-imidazo(1,5a)(1,4)benzodiazepine, (IB) and 8-chloro-6-(2'-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-1-hydroxymethyl-4H-imidazo(1,5a)(1,4) benzodiazepine, (IC) are minor metabolites. The major metabolite IA is extracted into benzene--methylene chloride (9:1) from urine buffered to pH 11.0 (after incubation with glucuronidase--sulfatase as pH 5.0), and analyzed by differential pulse polarography (DPP) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer PH 3). The overall recovery of IA is 84 +- 3.0% (S.D.) with a sensitivity limit of 50 ng per millilitre of urine. The metabolites of compound II have not as yet been elucidated. The GLC--ECD and DPP assays were applied to the determination of blood levels and urinary excretion in dogs following single 10 mg/kg intravenous and oral doses of I and following single 6 mg/kg intravenous and 10 mg/kg oral doses of II. Blood levels of compound I were also evaluated in man following intravenous infusion of single 10 mg doses.", 
    "26": "1. The effects of clazepam, a new benzodiazepine (30 mg orally) on performance tests and the cardiovascular system have been compared to those of chlordiazepoxide (30 mg orally) and a placebo in a double-blind trial involving six healthy volunteers. Simultaneously, the pharmacokinetics of clazepam were investigated. 2. While clazepam itself could be detected neither in plasma nor in urine, it gave rise to two plasma metabolites, the former, an alcoholic derivative with a short half-life, and the second, desmethyldiazepam, with a long half-life. These two metabolites and oxazepam were excreted in urine and, within the 24 h period following drug intake, accounted for 73% of the ingested dose. 3. Seven hours after its administration, clazepam slightly improved performance and reduced anxiety. The kinetics of these effects and the metabolic data suggest that clazepam acts mainly through the formation of desmethyldiazepam. However, owing to the low blood levels of this metabolite, the activity of clazepam was very moderate.", 
    "27": "Volunteer subjects were used to compare a potential antianxiety drug (nabilone, 2-mg single doses) with a standard drug (diazepam, 5-mg single doses). A double-masked design with placebo control was used. Volunteer subjects were selected on the basis of high levels of train anxiety and were tested by two anxiety-inducing procedures--the mirror drawing test and the Stroop color-word test. Anxiety induced by the experimental procedure was alleviated by diazepam and, to a lesser extent, by nabilone. Since doses of the two drugs may not have been equivalent, or the time courses identical, conclusions about their relative efficacy must be guarded. The experimental model is unusual in that antianxiety drugs can be tested in volunteer subjects for true antianxiety effects rather than for side effects, such as cognitive or motor impairment, sleepiness, or other signs of central nervous system depression.", 
    "28": "The acute effects on sexual behavior of oxazepam (16--64 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (8--64 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (2--8 mg/kg), and d-amphetamine (0.8--3.2 mg/kg) were examined in intact male and female golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus). Intraperitoneal injections were given 45 min before the first behavioral test. In 10-min tests, lordosis was observed in estrous females both before and after copulation, and mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations were observed in males. Dose-response related decrements in male sexual behavior were observed following chlorpromazine and chlordiazepoxide. All dose levels of oxazepam depressed male sexual behavior. The highest dose of chlordiazepoxide and oxazepam attenuated the onset of female sexual behavior, and all dose levels reduced postcopulatory lordosis durations. Amphetamine did not interrupt either male or female sexual behavior, and chlorpromazine disrupted male but not female behavior.", 
    "29": "Plasma levels of temazepam were determined in healthy subjects after single oral administration of soft and hard gelatin capsules, and after 7 consecutive night-time doses in soft capsules. Absorption from soft gelatin capsules was significantly faster and produced earlier and higher peak plasma levels. The two pharmaceutical forms did not show any significant difference in relative availability. The apparent half-life of temazepam after night-time administration was significantly shorter than after morning administration, but no change in half-life was observed between the first and seventh night-time doses.", 
    "30": "Six women from 14 to 17 weeks pregnant, and 12 woman from 36 to 40 weeks pregnant, were given nitrazepam 5 mg orally about 12 h before legal abortion by hysterotomy in the former group and elective caesarean section in the latter group. The concentration of nitrazepam was determined by gas-liquid chromatography. Binding to plasma proteins was evaluated by separation of the protein-free fraction by ultracentrifugation. In the first group (early pregnancy) the level of nitrazepam was found to be lower in the fetal than in the maternal circulation. The concentration in amniotic fluid was still lower. In the latter group (late pregnancy) the concentration both of unbound and total nitrazepam in maternal and fetal plasma were in equilibrium, which indicated an increase in transplancental transfer in late pregnancy. The percentage of unbound nitrazepam in both cases was 12%.", 
    "31": "The effects of acute intravenous injection of acebutolol 25 mg on the EEG were investigated in 5 normal subjects. On-line EEG analysis was carried out by a special purpose mini-computer using normalised slope descriptors (hjorth parameters). No significant changes were found apart from those due to drowsiness in 2 subjects, although minute to minute ECG frequency was significantly lowered (p = 0.031). The EEG, which is considered to be a sensitive tool, failed to show any conclusive evidence of any central action of the drug. The effects of beta-adrenergic blockers on the CNS are not yet fully understood.", 
    "32": "Fifty patients suffering principally from neurotic and psychosomatic disturbances were treated for 6 months with an average of 30 mg clobazam (Frisium) per day. For documentation of the efficacy and tolerance a set of assessment scales and procedures from the ECDEU system (Early Clinical Drug Evaluation Unit) was compiled. The results showed unanimously the anxiolytic efficacy and good tolerance of clobaza. After the second week of treatment there was a significant reduction in the anxiety symptoms in the judgement of the doctor and patient (p less than 0.01). Parallel to the reduction of anxiety symptoms the general condition also improved. The good tolerance of clobazam was shown in the overall clinical assessment and in the recording of specific side effects, which could never be called severe in any case. Moreover, there were no suggestions of changes in tolerance of of dependency.", 
    "33": "Three types of modern psychotropic drugs strongly influenced the practice of psychiatric therapy during the past 25 years: Minor tranquilizers, Antidepressants, and Neuroleptics. 1. From the clinical point of view the effects of tranquilizers are more unspecific as compared to those of neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs. Only with the latter two it is possible to treat manifestations of endogenous psychoses (schizophrenic and affective psychoses). The appraisal of both, the advantages (e.g. effectiveness on the symptomatology of acute psychotic manifestations or prophylactic effect in longtime application) and the risks (e.g. side-effects) have to be the basis of treatment of each single patient. 2. The recovery of biochemical mechanisms of neuroleptic and antidepressant drugs (especially of the effects on biogenic amines in CNS) is the most important advance in clearing up the biochemical disturbances in endogenous psychoses.", 
    "34": "To investigate the safety of anticonvulsants in doses found equipotent in suppressing imipramine induced convulsions, the effects of diazepam (1.8 mg/kg) or phenobarbital (40 mg/kg) following a toxic dose of imipramine (50 mg/kg) on heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature were examined in male Wistar rats. Administration of imipramine alone resulted in significant decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and rectal temperature. Phenobarbital or diazepam alone failed to significantly affect any of these parameters apart from a slight reduction in rectal temperature seen with phenobarbital. Diazepam given after imipramine antagonized the imipramine-induced decrease in heart rate but increased the hypotensive and hypothermic effects. Phenobarbital failed to significantly affect the imipramine-induced changes in any of the physiological parameters studied. The present data suggests that phenobarbital may be preferable to diazepam in treatment of imipramine-induced convulsions.", 
    "35": "In a time-distribution study, the anticonvulsant effects of four benzodiazepine compounds were compared with those of three standard antiepileptics against metrazol-induced seizures in mice and rats. Ethosuximide and trimethadione had the shortest duration of action in mice, but protected the rats up to 6 hr. Phenobarbitone, diazepam, flurazepam and nitrazepam protected the mice up to 12 hr, but the rats were effectively protected only up to 3-4 hr. Clonazepam, the most potent and effective agent, protected the mice from clonic-tonic seizures up to 18-20 hr and the rats up to 6-7 hr. Comparison of the PD50 from clonic seizure at the peak-effect hours revealed that the benzodiazepines were 16 to 96 times more potent than phenobarbitone on a molar basis, while phenobarbitone itself was 12 to 26 times more potent than ethosuximide and trimethadione. Tonic seizures and mortality were largely suppressed by all drugs until 18-20 hr in mice and 6-7 hr in rats. Seizure latency and mortality patterns varied from drug to drug but not in a dose-dependent manner.", 
    "36": "Various doses (0.1-1 mg/kg) of diazepam were given to chloralose anesthetized rats, with both systemic (i.p.) and central injections being tested. Arterial pressure, heart rate, respiration depth and frequency were recorded. Diazepam caused a dose-dependent decrease in the arterial pressure after systemic administration and also decreased it after central administration. However, only intraventricular but not intracisternal injections of diazepam were effective. The hypotensive effect of systemic diazepam was competitively counteracted by pretreatment with picrotoxin, a putative gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor blocking agent. The hypotensive effect of the centrally acting alpha-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine was not influenced by picrotoxin pretreatment. The effect of diazepam on heart rate was inconsistent. Diazepam caused a reduction of respiratory frequency, which was not counteracted by picrotoxin pretreatment. It is concluded that central gabergic mechanisms are to some extent involved in the hypotensive effect of diazepam, probably at a supramedullary level. The hypotensive effect of a threshold dose of diazepam was blocked by a small dose of clonidine. Likewise, diazepam pretreatment could counteract the hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory frequency reduction caused by a threshold dose of clonidine. These results suggest that gabergic and/or other benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors may interact with alpha-adrenoreceptors in the control of central cardiovascular and respiratory mechanisms.", 
    "37": "The responses of primary cultures of rat myocardial cells to diazepam (Valium) were evaluated. The cells were exposed to 4, 16 or 32 microgram/ml of diazepam for 1, 4 or 24 h. The cultures were evaluated for changes in beating activity and morphology and for cytotoxic effects. After the 1-h treatment exposure, the cultures exhibited tachycardia which was dose-dependent. The longer durations of treatment either produced arrhythmias or caused a loss of beating. Major morphological alterations observed were the formation pseudopodia and increased cytoplasmic granulation. Cytotoxicity was measured quantitatively by leakage of lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) from the cells into the media and by cell viability. Moderate amounts of LDH were leaked from the cells after exposure to diazepam for 4 h. After 24 h of treatment with the higher concentrations of diazepam, cell viability was greatly reduced.", 
    "38": "s-Triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines bearing various substituents in the 1 position were prepared by oxidative cyclization of the appropriate aldehyde hydrazones of 2-hydrazinobenzodiazepines. Diethyl azodicarboxylate and activated manganese dioxide were used as oxidizing agents. The new triazolo compounds were active in the CNS tests but none of them reached the potency of the known triazolobenzodiazepines.", 
    "39": "Interictal spikes with a configuration similar to that occurring in grand mal epilepsy were generated by the application of penicillin to a hippocampal slice preparation. This slice preparation has potential value for screening anticonvulsant drugs and for studying epileptic activity. The effect of anticonvulsant drugs on seizure activity was tested at concentrations comparable to reported clinical serum concentrations. Phenytoin and diazepam were maximally effective at concentrations of 20 microgram/ml and 3-4 microgram/ml, respectively, in good agreement with their effective concentrations in clinical practice. Phenobarbital was more potent (5 microgram/ml) and mesuximide (50% potent at 80 microgram/ml) was least effective."
