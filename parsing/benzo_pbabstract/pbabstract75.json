    "1": "Three infusion devices connected to a single-lumen catheter were studied: a standard set with 2-port manifold and 1-m extension set and 2 multilumen infusion access devices: a 3-lumen extension set and a 9-lumen extension set (Edelvaiss-Multiline\u2122; Doran International, Toussieu, France). For the 9-lumen extension set, 3 infusion access combinations were studied. Furosemide, midazolam, and saline were infused simultaneously through 3 infusion devices. Three concentrations of furosemide were tested. The infusion rate of saline (carrier) was initially set at 100 mL/h and stepwise decreased by 10 mL/h until precipitate formation. Physical incompatibility was assessed by 2 tests: visual inspection and the subvisible particle count test according to the European Pharmacopeia. The lowest saline infusion rate to prevent visible precipitate and attain an acceptable particle count (i.e., to pass \"the 2 tests\") was reported for each infusion set.", 
    "2": "The standard set revealed visible precipitate even at the highest saline flow rate (100 mL/h). The 3-lumen device prevented drug precipitation using the 2 lowest furosemide concentrations with a saline infusion rate that decreased with furosemide concentration. The 9-lumen infusion access device prevented drug precipitation whatever the furosemide concentration for 2 access combinations using saline infusion rates of between 20 and 60 mL/h but not for a third access combination, despite saline infusion rates equal to 100 mL/h.", 
    "3": "Infusion device characteristics appear to have an impact on the physical compatibility of the 2 drugs. Under specified conditions, the 9-lumen infusion access device prevents physical furosemide-midazolam incompatibility.",

Parents report an upper-airway infection a few days before the development of acute encephalopathy, mild facial palsy, and seizures. The patient needed mechanical ventilation for 10 days, and after extubation, he presented hypotonia, ataxia, dysarthria, as well as weak gag and cough reflexes. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed hyperintense lesions on T2- and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences on the right subcortical occipital and parietal region, left posterior arm of the internal capsule, and in the medulla oblongata. Borrelia burgdorferi was identified in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid by polymerase chain reaction and in the plasma by Western blotting. He was treated with ceftriaxone, methylprednisolone, and human immunoglobulin. Recovery was partial.",

Timed blood and urine samples were obtained for PK analyses. Forty mg of oral furosemide was administered to 13 RYGB recipients and 14 controls, and urine and blood samples were collected for assessing furosemidePK, and urine volume and urine sodium excretion for PD analyses.",

    "11": "A nested case-control study using 29 697 controls and 4964 cases of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) from The Health Improvement Network, a UK primary care patient database (2001-2002), investigated the association between benzodiazepines and pneumonia occurrence using conditional logistic regression. Cox regression was then used to determine the impact of benzodiazepines on mortality in the 4964 cases of CAP. Results are presented as adjusted OR, adjusted HR and 95% CI.", 
    "12": "Exposure to benzodiazepines was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.42 to 1.67). Individually diazepam, lorazepam and temazepam, but not chlordiazepoxide, were associated with an increased incidence of CAP. As a class, benzodiazepines were associated with increased 30-day (HR 1.22 (95% CI 1.06 to 1.39)) and long-term mortality (HR 1.32 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.47)) in patients with a prior diagnosis of CAP. Individually diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam and temazepam affected long-term mortality in these patients.",

    "14": "A 14-year-old boy presented with acute visual loss due to cortical blindness. Two weeks after the visual symptoms, the patient developed behavioral abnormalities. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed hyperintense lesions at parieto-occipital lobes on T2-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. Sleep and awake electroencephalography (EEG) were normal, but diazepam administration revealed bilateral periodic synchronous complexes occurring every 20 to 30 seconds. Elevated measles antibody titers in cerebrospinal fluid confirmed the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. We conclude that visual loss due to cortical blindness is an important finding of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Diazepam administration during EEG should be a part of investigation in cases with unexplained cortical blindness.",

The extract did not influence the expression of hGR target genes, including tyrosine aminotransferase (hTAT), constitutive androstane receptor (hCAR), or pregnane X receptor (hPXR), in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Moreover, hGR antagonism by mifepristone (also known as RU486) did not attenuate the extent of induction of hCAR- and hPXR-regulated target genes CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 by Ginkgo biloba extract.", 
    "19": "Ginkgo biloba extract, ginkgolide A, ginkgolide B, ginkgolide C, ginkgolide J, and bilobalide are not activators of hGR. Furthermore, the extract does not influence the hGR-hCAR or the hGR-hPXR signaling pathway in primary cultures of human hepatocytes.", 
    "20": "The aim of this paper is to underline the need of a systematic monitoring (1) of atypical antipsychotics and (2) of catatonic symptoms in child psychiatry. We present in this paper the clinical history of a 16-year-old adolescent inpatient needing a prescription of atypical antipsychotic drug. We present the most relevant results of our clinical monitoring over 7 months.", 
    "21": "A 16-year-old Caucasian male adolescent, by the name of Paul, was admitted in August 2009 to an Adolescent University Psychiatry Unit for an acute psychotic disorder. On admission, he presented paranoid delusion, auditory hallucinations and impulsive movements. The score on the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale (BFCRS) was 17 (the threshold score for the diagnosis of catatonic symptoms is 2). Laboratory tests showed the lack of blood toxic levels, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level was 684 IU/L. Paul was treated with clonazepam (0.05 mg/kg/d). This particular day was considered to be day #1 of the clinical drug monitoring. Immediately after, regular follow-up of catatonic symptoms was performed. On day #15, the CPK level returned to normal with improvement of clinical catatonia but with still a score of 4 on the BFCRS scale. Auditory hallucinations and delusion persisted. Risperidone treatment was begun (1mg/d and 1.5mg/d after 24 hours), associated with oral clonazepam (0.05 mg/kg/d). On day #17, after 48 hours of improvement of delusion, the catatonic symptoms rapidly worsened. Risperidone was stopped; Paul was transferred to intensive care where he was treated with clonazepam IV (0.1mg/kg/d). The score on BFCRS scale was 20, Paul presented no fever and the CPK level was below 170 IU/L. The diagnosis was a relapse of the catatonic episode, which was caused by the administration of risperidone. On day #24, no improvement in the state of catatonia was obtained. The treatment was changed with the following combination of medicine: clonazepam (0.1mg/kg/d)-lorazepam (5mg/d)-carbamazepine (10mg/kg/d). With this combination, the state of catatonia improved quickly and on day #31, he was transferred to the adolescent psychiatry unit. However, delusion and hallucinations persisted; a treatment with olanzapine was started at 5mg/d and then progressively increased to 20mg/d for 10 days. On day #115, after 3 months with olanzapine, no improvement of the hallucinatory and delusional symptoms was observed; the diagnosis of early-onset refractory schizophrenia was established. The Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM) confirmed the good compliance; clozapine was introduced and progressively increased up to 250 mg/d. On day #199, after 3 months under clozapine (250 mg/d), the speech was coherent and delusion was rare. During this period, no relapse of the catatonic state was observed.", 
    "22": "In this case, the BFCRS scale was sensitive to catatonic symptom diagnosis. CPK levels vary differently for each atypical antipsychotic and are not a specific complication indicator. In complex cases, the TDM seems useful when choosing atypical antipsychotics.", 
    "23": "The association of two benzodiazepines (clonazepam-lorazepam) with carbamazepin allowed the improvement of catatonic symptoms. Plasma levels of atypical antipsychotics helped the practitioner in deciding the type of care required: plasma levels confirmed the patient's treatment adherence and thus reinforced the choice of clozapine.", 
    "24": "Here we report that indazole is characterized as a potential anticonvulsant, inhibiting pentylenetetrazole-, electroshock- and strychnine-induced convulsions in mice (ED50's: 39.9, 43.2 and 82.4 mg/kg, respectively) but not bicuculline- and picrotoxin-induced convulsions. The median toxic dose (TD(50)) of indazole was 52.3 mg/kg by the minimal motor impairment test. Therefore, nontoxic doses produced anticonvulsant activity against pentylenetetrazole- and electroshock-induced seizures. Indazole (50 mg/kg) had no effect on spontaneous activity but induced hypothermia. It also inhibited the metabolism of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in the brain in vivo and the activities of monoamine oxidase A and B in vitro, with IC(50) values of 20.6 \u03bcM and 16.3 \u03bcM, respectively. However, these inhibitory effects do not account for the anticonvulsant activity because treatment with typical monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as pargyline or tranylcypromine did not completely reproduce the anticonvulsant activity of indazole. In the animal seizure models tested, the anticonvulsant profile of indazole most resembled that of gabapentin and somewhat resembled those of the AMPA/kainate antagonist NBQX and the sodium channel inhibitor phenytoin, but differed from that of benzodiazepine. The isobolographic analyses showed that the interactive mode of indazole with gabapentin, NBQX or phenytoin is additive. These results suggest that indazole has anticonvulsant activity and multiple mechanisms.", 
    "25": "Clobazam (CLB) was recently approved by the FDA, but has not been evaluated in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We retrospectively reviewed a cohort of patients with TSC and refractory epilepsy who started CLB over a 5-year period. Clinical characteristics and number of tubers on MRI were assessed. Duration of therapy, therapeutic response and adverse events were recorded. CLB was prescribed in 29 adults and children of whom 72% were cognitively impaired, with a median age at seizure onset of 5 months. Mean duration of CLB therapy was 17.3 months with a 12 and 24-month estimated retention rate of 82% and 68%, respectively. Twenty patients (69%) reported a good response (>50% seizure reduction) at the end of the titration, and six patients (21%) remained good responders after 12 months of CLB therapy. Adverse events occurred in 13 patients, predominantly somnolence and behavioral disorders. One quarter of the responders reported improvement in behavior. No predictive factor for a good response could be identified. CLB appears to be a well-tolerated and valuable option for treatment of refractory epilepsy in TSC.", 
    "26": "Aiming at identifying new scaffolds for BACE-1 inhibition devoid of the pharmacokinetic drawbacks of peptide-like structures, we investigated a series of novel peptidomimetics based on a 1,4-benzodiazepine (BDZ) core 1a-h and their seco-analogues 2a-d. We herein discuss synthesis, molecular modeling and in vitro studies which, starting from 1a, led to the seco-analogues (R)-2c and (S)-2d endowed with BACE-1 inhibition properties in the micromolar range both on the isolated enzyme and in cellular studies. These data can encourage to pursue these analogues as hits for the development of a new series of BACE-1 inhibitors active on whole-cells.", 
    "27": "Selective modulation of specific benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) gamma amino butyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptor ion channels has been identified as an important method for separating out the variety of pharmacological effects elicited by BzR-related drugs. Importantly, it has been demonstrated that both \u03b12\u03b2(2/3)\u03b32 (\u03b12BzR) and \u03b13BzR (and/or \u03b12/\u03b13) BzR subtype selective ligands exhibit anxiolytic effects with little or no sedation. Previously we have identified several such ligands; however, three of our parent ligands exhibited significant metabolic liability in rodents in the form of a labile ester group. Here eight analogs are reported which were designed to circumvent this liability by utilizing a rational replacement of the ester moiety based on medicinal chemistry precedents. In a metabolic stability study using human liver microsomes, four compounds were found to undergo slower metabolic transformation, as compared to their corresponding ester analogs. These compounds were also evaluated in in vitro efficacy assays. Additionally, bioisostere 11 was evaluated in a rodent model of anxiety. It exhibited anxiolytic activity at doses of 10 and 100mg/kg and was devoid of sedative properties.",

Similar results were found for remission and relapse rates. No differences were identified for levels of depression and mania symptoms (low-quality evidence) and incidence of mania (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects were more common in patients treated with OFC than in those treated with lamotrigine (RR=1.13; 95% CI: 1.04, 1.23), but no difference was found relative to the patients treated with olanzapine (low-quality evidence).",

    "32": "OFC therapy improved the response, remission, and relapse rates among other outcomes. However, a worse profile of adverse reactions was observed in some comparisons. These data clarify the therapeutic use of OFC as an option to olanzapine in bipolar depression. The quality of the evidence could be improved by additional comparisons and higher rates of treatment adherence.",

The patients met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria and were taking no antipsychotic medication or taking clozapine, olanzapine, or risperidone. OCS severity was measured with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. We compared patients to a sample of 575 healthy controls.",

    "40": "Because of a high incidence of serious adverse events, quetiapine was discontinued midway through the trial. There were significant differences among patients willing to be randomized to different atypical antipsychotics (P < .01), suggesting that treating clinicians tended to exclude olanzapine and prefer aripiprazole as one of the possible choices in patients with metabolic problems. Yet, the atypical antipsychotic groups did not differ in longitudinal changes in metabolic parameters or on most other outcome measures. Overall results suggested a high discontinuation rate (median duration 26 weeks prior to discontinuation), lack of significant improvement in psychopathology, and high cumulative incidence of metabolic syndrome (36.5% in 1 year) and of serious (23.7%) and nonserious (50.8%) adverse events for all atypical antipsychotics in the study.",

    "43": "Lipid rafts have been shown to play an important role for G-protein mediated signal transduction and the function of ligand-gated ion channels including their modulation by psychopharmacological compounds. In this study, we investigated the functional significance of the membrane distribution of NMDA and GABAA receptor subunits in relation to the accumulation of the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine (DMI) and the benzodiazepine diazepam (Diaz). In the presence of Triton X-100, which allowed proper separation of the lipid raft marker proteins caveolin-1 and flotillin-1 from the transferrin receptor, all receptor subunits were shifted to the non-raft fractions. In contrast, under detergent-free conditions, NMDA and GABAA receptor subunits were detected both in raft and non-raft fractions. Diaz was enriched in non-raft fractions without Triton X-100 in contrast to DMI, which preferentially accumulated in lipid rafts. Impairment of lipid raft integrity by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrine (M\u03b2CD)-induced cholesterol depletion did not change the inhibitory effect of DMI at the NMDA receptor, whereas it enhanced the potentiating effect of Diaz at the GABAA receptor at non-saturating concentrations of GABA. These results support the hypothesis that the interaction of benzodiazepines with the GABAA receptor likely occurs outside of lipid rafts while the antidepressant DMI acts on ionotropic receptors both within and outside these membrane microdomains.",

The recognition of catatonia within the neuroleptic malignant syndrome offered effective treatments of high doses of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), again questioning the tie. A verifying test for catatonia (the lorazepam sedation test) was developed. Soon the syndromes of delirious mania, toxic serotonin syndrome, and the repetitive behaviors in adolescents with autism were recognized as treatable variations of catatonia.",

At admission (subsequently to a suicidal attempt) he was ambivalent, ambitendent and--periodically--agitated.

    "76": "Phenobarbital has been in clinical use as an antiepileptic drug (AED) since 1912. The initial clinical success of phenobarbital and other barbiturates affected the design of subsequent AEDs (e.g., phenytoin, primidone, ethosuximide), developed between 1938 and 1962, the chemical structures of which resemble that of phenobarbital. However, the empirical discovery of carbamazepine (1962) and the serendipitous discovery of valproic acid (1967) led to subsequent AEDs having chemical structures that are diverse and completely different from that of phenobarbital. Sixteen AEDs were introduced between 1990 and 2012. Most of these AEDs were developed empirically, using mechanism-unbiased anticonvulsant animal models. The empirical nature of the discovery of these AEDs, coupled with their multiple mechanisms of action, explains their diverse chemical structures. The antiepileptic market is therefore crowded. Future design of new AEDs must have a potential for treating nonepileptic central nervous system (CNS) disorders (e.g., bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain, migraine prophylaxis, or restless legs syndrome). The barbiturates were once used as sedative-hypnotic drugs, but have been largely replaced in this role by the much safer benzodiazepines. In contrast, phenobarbital is still used worldwide in epilepsy. Nevertheless, the development of nonsedating phenobarbital derivatives will answer a clinical unmet need and might make this old AED more attractive.",

Stimulants to improve waking function include amphetamine derivatives, modafinil, and caffeine. Sleep aids encompass several classes, from benzodiazepine hypnotics to over-the-counter antihistamines. Other medications used in sleep medicine include those initially used in other disorders, such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and psychiatric disorders. As these medications are prescribed or encountered by providers in diverse fields of medicine, it is important to recognize the distribution of adverse effects, drug interaction profiles, metabolism, and cytochrome substrate activity. In this paper, we review the pharmacological armamentarium in the field of sleep medicine to provide a framework for risk-benefit considerations in clinical practice.",

Concomitant use with antiretroviral drugs has generated concerns of herb-drug interaction (HDI). This study investigated the inhibitory effects of the crude extracts of S. frutescens on the major cytochrome P450 isozymes with the use of pooled human liver microsomes. Its effect on the metabolic clearance of midazolam using cryopreserved hepatocytes was also monitored. The potential of S. frutescens to inhibit human ATP-binding cassette transporters (P-gp and BCRP) and the human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) activity was assessed using cell lines overexpressing the transporter proteins. S. frutescens showed inhibitory potency for CYP1A2 (IC(50) = 41.0 \u00b5g/ml), CYP2A6 (IC(50) = 160 \u00b5g/ml), CYP2B6 (IC(50) = 20.0 \u00b5g/ml), CYP2C8 (IC(50) = 22.4 \u00b5g/ml), CYP2C9 (IC(50) = 23.0 \u00b5g/ml), CYP2C19 (IC(50) = 35.9 \u00b5g/ml), and CYP3A4/5 (IC(50) = 17.5 \u00b5g/ml [with midazolam1'-hydroxylation]; IC(50) = 28.3 \u00b5g/ml [with testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation]). Time-dependent (irreversible) inhibition by S. frutescens was observed for CYP3A4/5 (K(I) = 296 \u00b5g/ml, k(inact) = 0.063 min(-1)) under the conditions of this study. S. frutescens also delays the production of midazolam metabolites in the hepatocytes, decreasing its clearance by 40%. Furthermore, S. frutescens inhibited P-gp (IC(50) = 324.8 \u00b5g/ml), OATP1B1 (IC(50) = 10.4 \u00b5g/ml), and OATP1B3 (IC(50) = 6.6 \u00b5g/ml).

To assess the pharmacokinetics of selective substrates of human cytochrome P450s in Microminipigs, caffeine (human P450 1A2), warfarin (P450 2C9), omeprazole (P450 2C19), metoprolol (P450 2D6), and midazolam (P450 3A) were administered in combination, intravenously (0.20 mg kg(-1))( )or orally (1.0 mg kg(-1)). Plasma samples obtained, up to 24 hr after dosing, from four male and four female Microminipigs were analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to estimate typical pharmacokinetic parameters for each analyte. Bioavailabilities were approximately 80% for caffeine and warfarin, but less than 10% for omeprazole, metoprolol, and midazolam. No significant differences were noted, for the five probes, in area under the plasma concentration-time curve and peak plasma concentration values obtained from male and female Microminipigs. Clearance of caffeine, warfarin, omeprazole or midazolam in vivo, mediated mainly by cytochrome P450s 1A, 2C or 3A in Microminipigs, was similar to data reported for human. However, metoprolol metabolism, mediated by P450 2D enzymes in Microminipigs, was faster than reported for in vivo human kinetic parameters and in vitro in a human liver microsomal system. The results of this study suggest that the Microminipig is a suitable animal model for use in biological experiments for comparisons of pharmacokinetics of drugs in humans. The five-probes in combination used in this study demonstrate the disposition of typical P450 drugs in Microminipigs in vivo, with the aim of use in non-clinical pharmacological/toxicological studies.", 
    "87": "The present study was designed to clarify whether the arachidonic acid cascade contributes to the decreased threshold for pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure under benzodiazepine withdrawal in mice. The seizure threshold for pentylenetetrazole was significantly decreased by the discontinuation of chronic treatment with diazepam. The decrease in the seizure threshold for pentylenetetrazole during diazepam withdrawal was significantly suppressed by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) pretreatment with the phospholipase A(2) inhibitor quinacrine (30, 100\u2009nmol) and the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10, 30\u2009nmol). In contrast, the decreased seizure threshold in the diazepam-withdrawal group was intensified by pretreatment with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor diclofenac (56\u2009nmol). These compounds did not alter the threshold for seizure in a control group. These findings suggest that enhancement of the arachidonic acid cascade may contribute to the hypersusceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizure during diazepam withdrawal.",

Based on the observed clinical effects, it has been speculated that lavender oil may exert benzodiazepine-like action including the known dependence and abuse potential of this class of drugs. Although no evidence for such an activity was generated during the long-standing medicinal use of lavender oil, further preclinical investigations were now conducted to evaluate this potential side effect in more detail. Twelve adult, male, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate the benzodiazepine drug diazepam (2 mg/kg i.p.) from saline using a two-lever operant procedure. After approximately 40 training sessions the majority of rats learned the discrimination and pre-treatment with ascending doses of diazepam (0.3-2 mg/kg i.p.) produced a dose related generalization to the diazepam cue. In these same animals Silexan was administered to see if animals recognized the drug as \"diazepam-like\" i.e. generalized to diazepam or \"saline-like\". Silexan tested at doses 3-30 mg/kg i.p. produced almost exclusively (>90%) saline-like responding. Also there was no effect of Silexan on response rate, i.e. rate of lever pressing, at any dose suggesting that the test article is well tolerated and does not exert a sedating effect. In sum, Silexan has no diazepam-like interoceptive property in adult, male rats. This suggests that Silexan does not share the potential of benzodiazepines to induce the development of tolerance, dependence and addiction.",

Since the intensity of pain perception is low during dark hours of the night when melatonin levels are high, this hormone has been implicated as one of the prime antinociceptive substances. A number of studies have examined the antinociceptive role of melatonin in acute, inflammatory and neuropathic pain animal models. It has been demonstrated that melatonin exerts antinociceptive actions by acting at both spinal cord and supraspinal levels. The mechanism of antinociceptive actions of melatonin involves opioid, benzodiazepine, \u03b1(1)- and \u03b1(2)-adrenergic, serotonergic and cholinergic receptors. Most importantly however, the involvement of MT(1)/MT(2) melatonergic receptors in the spinal cord has been well documented as an antinociceptive mechanism in a number of animal models of pain perception. Exogenous melatonin has been used effectively in the management of pain in medical conditions such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome and migraine and cluster headache. Melatonin has been tried during surgical operating conditions and has been shown to enhance both preoperative and post-operative analgesia.

Regional preferences, patient history, institutional bias, and individual patient and practitioner variability, however, create a wide discrepancy in the approach to sedation of critically ill patients. Untreated pain and agitation increase the sympathetic stress response, potentially leading to negative acute and long-term consequences. Oversedation, however, occurs commonly and is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including longer time on mechanical ventilation, prolonged stay in the intensive care unit, and increased brain dysfunction (delirium and coma). Modifying sedation delivery by incorporating analgesia and sedation protocols, targeted arousal goals, daily interruption of sedation, linked spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, and early mobilization of patients have all been associated with improvements in patient outcomes and should be incorporated into the clinical management of critically ill patients. To improve outcomes, including time on mechanical ventilation and development of acute brain dysfunction, conventional sedation paradigms should be altered by providing necessary analgesia, incorporating propofol or dexmedetomidine to reach arousal targets, and reducing benzodiazepine exposure.",

Most notably, we find that the translocator protein ligands PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 are glucose-lowering agents despite a strong inductive effect on pck1 expression. We show that these drugs are activators of a fasting-like energy state and, notably, that they protect high-fat diet-induced obese mice from hepatosteatosis and glucose intolerance, two pathological manifestations of metabolic dysregulation.

However, benzodiazepines present some limitations: they are ineffective for some subtypes of anxiety disorders. Moreover, they entail side effects such as dependency, somnolence, and memory disturbances. Since 1980s, several clinical trials have shown that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which have no dependency, are effective for most subtypes of anxiety disorders. Consequently, SSRIs are now anti-anxiety drugs as well as antidepressants. In a recent guideline for the pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders developed by the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) Task Force, SSRIs are first-line drugs for the treatment of most subtypes of anxiety disorders. However, SSRIs do not improve symptoms in all patients with anxiety disorders. Therefore, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants are used even now for the treatment of anxiety disorder. Furthermore, off-label pharmacotherapies, supportive and other psychotherapies, and psychoeducation are applied to the treatment of anxiety disorders. Pharmacotherapy is part of integrative therapy of anxiety disorders. The treatment and pathogenesis of treatment-resistant anxiety disorders have not been elucidated sufficiently. Future studies must be conducted to elucidate the pathogenesis and to develop a new treatment for treatment-resistant anxiety disorders. In contrast to those for other emotions, the neurocircuits related to anxiety and fear have been clarified in detail. The author and others have investigated the mechanisms and target brain regions of the anti-anxiety action of SSRIs using an animal model of anxiety: conditioned fear stress. Results show that SSRIs inhibit glutamatergic neurons of the amygdala through increased extracellular serotonin levels. This inhibition engenders anti-anxiety action. Benzodiazepines also inhibit the amygdala, thereby reducing fear or anxiety. The inhibitory action on the amygdala might be a common mechanism of anti-anxiety action of SSRIs and benzodiazepines.",

    "124": "Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that controls energy balance by acting primarily in the CNS, but its action is lost in common forms of obesity due to central leptin resistance. One potential mechanism for such leptin resistance is an increased hypothalamic expression of Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (Socs3), a feedback inhibitor of the Jak-Stat pathway that prevents Stat3 activation. Ample studies have confirmed the important role of Socs3 in leptin resistance and obesity. However, the degree to which Socs3 participates in the regulation of energy homeostasis in nonobese conditions remains largely undetermined. In this study, using adult mice maintained under standard diet, we demonstrate that Socs3 deficiency in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) reduces food intake, protects against body weight gain, and limits adiposity, suggesting that Socs3 is necessary for normal body weight maintenance. Mechanistically, MBH Socs3-deficient mice display increased hindbrain sensitivity to endogenous, meal-related satiety signals, mediated by oxytocin signaling. Thus, oxytocin signaling likely mediates the effect of hypothalamic leptin on satiety circuits of the caudal brainstem. This provides an anatomical substrate for the effect of leptin on meal size, and more generally, a mechanism for how the brain controls short-term food intake as a function of the energetic stores available in the organism to maintain energy homeostasis. Any dysfunction in this pathway could potentially lead to overeating and obesity.",

Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine agonist with a high affinity to benzodiazepine receptor subtype \u03c91, has been reported to improve clinical symptoms of dystonia in some cases. We conducted an open-label study to assess the efficacy of zolpidem in 34 patients with primary dystonia patients, The Burke Fahn Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) scores in the patients were decreased from 7.2 \u00b1 7.9 to 5.5 \u00b1 5.0 after zolpidem therapy (P=0.042). Next we evaluated 55 patients with primary and secondary dystonia, 16 of 55 patients (29%) responded to zolpidem, and secondary dystonia, particularly post-traumatic dystonia, was more responsive than primary dystonia (5 of 11 [46%] vs 11 of 44 [25%]). The efficacy of zolpidem was comparable to that of other oral medications in our previous study; 33 of 89 dystonia patients (37%) responded to trihexyphenidil, 13 of 53 (25%) responded to clonazepam, and 4 of 21 (19%) responded to baclofen. In conclusion, our large scale study suggested that zolpidem may be a therapeutic option for dystonia, particularly post-traumatic dystonia.", 
    "126": "The rat exposure test (RET) is a prey (mouse)-predator (rat) situation that activates brain defensive areas and elicits hormonal and defensive behavior in the mouse. Here, we investigated possible correlations between the spatiotemporal [time spent in protected (home chamber and tunnel) and unprotected (surface) compartments and frequency of entries into the three compartments] and ethological [e.g., duration of protected and unprotected stretched-attend postures (SAP), duration of contact with the rat's compartment] measures (Experiment 1). Secondly, we investigated the effects of systemic treatment with pro- or anti-aversive drugs on the behavior that emerged from the factor analysis (Experiment 2). The effects of chronic (21 days) imipramine and fluoxetine on defensive behavior were also investigated (Experiment 3). Exp. 1 revealed that the time in the protected compartment, protected SAP and rat contacts loaded on factor 1 (defensive behavior), while the total entries and unprotected SAP loaded on factor 2 (locomotor activity). Exp. 2 showed that alprazolam (but not diazepam) selectively changed the defensive factor. Caffeine produced a mild proaversive-like effect, whereas yohimbine only decreased locomotor activity (total entries). Fluoxetine (but not imipramine) produced a weak proaversive-like effect. 5-HT(1A)/5-HT(2) receptor ligands did not change any behavioral measure. In Exp. 3, chronic fluoxetine (but not imipramine) attenuated the defensive behavior factor without changing locomotion. Given that the defensive factor was sensitive to drugs known to attenuate (alprazolam and chronic fluoxetine) and induce (caffeine) panic attack, we suggest the RET as a useful test to assess the effects of panicolytic and panicogenic drugs.",

Palmatine (0.1, 0.5, 1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and physostigmine (0.1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) per se were administered for 10 successive days to separate groups of mice. Effect of drugs on learning and memory of mice was evaluated using elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. Brain acetylcholinesterase activity was also estimated. Effect of palmatine on scopolamine- and diazepam-induced amnesia was also investigated. Palmatine (0.5 and 1\u2009mg/kg) and physostigmine significantly improved learning and memory of mice, as indicated by decrease in transfer latency using elevated plus maze, and decrease in escape latency during training and increase in time spent in target quadrant during retrieval using Morris water maze. The drugs did not show any significant effect on locomotor activity of the mice. Memory-enhancing activity of palmatine (1\u2009mg/kg) was comparable to physostigmine. Palmatine (1\u2009mg/kg) significantly reversed scopolamine- and diazepam-induced amnesia in mice. Palmatine and physostigmine also significantly reduced brain acetylcholinesterase activity of mice. Thus, palmatine showed memory-enhancing activity in mice probably by inhibiting brain acetylcholinesterase activity, through involvement of GABA-benzodiazepine pathway, and due to its antioxidant activity.",

The menu for biochemical toxicological analysis in coroners' cases is not prescriptive in Ireland or in the United Kingdom. The aim of the study was to confirm that reliance on the results of an immunoassay screen for drugs of abuse and common analgesics in order to select samples for compound confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is likely to understate the potential role of drugs in suicide. Blood and urine samples were analyzed using enzyme immunoassay, alcohols by gas chromatography and urines were screened by Bio-Rad's Rapid Emergency Drug Identification (REMEDi) system. Laboratory data from analysis of 132 cases of suicide, including 101 cases of hanging revealed that 83 % were male confirming suicide as a male epidemic. Overall, alcohol was a factor in 57 %, benzodiazepines in 26 %, cannabinoids in 11 %, opioids in 19.7 %, sympathomimetics in 7.5 %, cocaine in 4.5 %, antidepressants 22 %, antipsychotics in 10 %, hypnotics in 5 %, and antihistamines in 4 % of these cases. Screening compounds in cases of hanging and other suicides should extend beyond the narrow focus of alcohol and illicit drugs to include a wide spectrum of psychoactive and other compounds as a standard procedure. The wide range of licit and illicit compounds found in these cases reflects current experience and dictates the necessity for chromatographic screening with mass spectroscopy confirmation in all cases as best practice.", 
    "136": "The term non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) refers to a heterogeneous group of diseases with different etiology, prognosis and treatment. The different forms of NCSE comprise about 25-50% of all status epilepticus cases. The most frequent form encountered in clinical practice is complex-partial SE but the rarer conditions of absence status, aura status and subtle SE are also included under this category. A diagnosis of NCSE should be considered in all patients with otherwise unexplained changes in consciousness or behavior and this diagnosis demands rapid further diagnostic work up including clinical examination, a detailed clinical history from the patient or an accompanying person, cranial computed tomography (CCT) and an electroencephalogram (EEG). If signs of an infectious or inflammatory disorder are present, a spinal tap is indicated. The EEG is of high relevance although interpretation can be challenging in NCSE.Absence status is usually treated by benzodiazepines and if necessary a broad spectrum anticonvulsive drug (ACD) such as valproic acid (VPA) can be added. The treatment of complex-partial SE follows the same scheme as that of generalized tonic-clonic SE and an initial benzodiazepine (i.v. lorazepam or intramuscular midazolam) followed by a bolus of one of the ACDs available as i.v. solution (e.g. VPA, phenytoin, phenobarbitol or levetiracetam). The third treatment step is general anesthesia if NCSE fails to be controlled. The aggressiveness of the applied therapy depends on the severity of the NCSE and the general condition of the patient. The prognosis is determined by the subtype of NCSE and the underlying etiology.",

He recently started taking pregabalin (Lyrica capsules) which was prescribed for low-back pain 3 days ago. The day following admission, he discontinued pregabalin.

These cases demonstrate a possible area of use for the antidepressant agomelatine in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal and addiction. The extent to which this effect is due to the anti-craving effects of agomelatine, or its profile of receptor activation, should be further investigated in larger clinical and experimental studies.",

Orlistat is a weight-control medication that is known to induce loose stools as a common side effect. This study aimed to explore whether orlistat used to control clozapine-induced weight gain can simultaneously tackle clozapine-related constipation. In this 16-week randomized-controlled study, clozapine-treated patients received add-on orlistat (n=30) or add-on placebo (n=24). Colonic function was measured using the Bristol Stool Form Scale. There was a significant (P=0.039) difference in the prevalence of constipation in favor of orlistat over placebo in completers (n=40) at the endpoint. A decrease in the prevalence of constipation within the orlistat group (P=0.035) was observed (vs. no statistically significant changes in the placebo group). In clozapine-treated patients, orlistat may be beneficial not only for weight control but also as a laxative.

    "146": "Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) arises in a haemopoietic stem cell and is driven by the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. Abl kinase inhibitors (protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors) represent standard treatment for CML and induce remission in the majority of patients with early disease, however these drugs do not target leukaemic stem cells (LSCs) effectively, thus preventing cure. Previously, we identified the farnesyl transferase inhibitor BMS-214662 as a selective inducer of apoptosis in LSCs of CML patients relative to normal controls; however, the mechanism underlying LSC-specific apoptosis remains unclear. To identify pathways involved in the favourable effects of BMS-214662 in CML, we employed a proteomic approach (based on iTRAQ) to analyse changes in protein expression in response to drug treatment in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of CD34(+) CML cells. The study identified 88 proteins as altered after drug treatment, which included proteins known to be involved in nucleic acid metabolism, oncogenesis, developmental processes and intracellular protein trafficking. We found that expression of Ebp1, a negative regulator of proliferation, was upregulated in the nucleus of BMS-214662-treated cells. Furthermore, proteins showing altered levels in the cytosol, such as histones, were predominantly derived from the nucleus and BMS-214662 affected expression levels of nuclear pore complex proteins. Validation of key facets of these observations suggests that drug-induced alterations in protein localisation, potentially via loss of nuclear membrane integrity, contributes to the LSC specificity of BMS-214662, possibly via Ran proteins as targets.",

Astrocytes specifically synthesize and release endozepines, a family of regulatory peptides including the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN). ODN is the ligand of both central-type benzodiazepine receptors (CBR), and an adenylyl cyclase- and phospholipase C-coupled receptor. We have recently shown that ODN is a potent protective agent that prevents hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced inhibition of SOD and catalase activities and stimulation of cell apoptosis in astrocytes. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the type of receptor involved in ODN-induced inhibition of SOD and catalase in cultured rat astrocytes. We found that ODN induced a rapid stimulation of SOD and catalase gene transcription in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, 0.1 nM ODN blocked H(2)O(2)-evoked reduction of both mRNA levels and activities of SOD and catalase. Furthermore, the inhibitory actions of ODN on the deleterious effects of H(2)O(2) on SOD and catalase were abrogated by the metabotropic ODN receptor antagonist cyclo(1-8)[Dleu(5)]OP, but not by the CBR antagonist flumazenil. Finally, the protective action of ODN against H(2)O(2)-evoked inhibition of endogenous antioxidant systems in astrocytes was protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent, but protein kinase C-independent. Taken together, these data demonstrate for the first time that ODN, acting through its metabotropic receptor coupled to the PKA pathway, prevents oxidative stress-induced alteration of antioxidant enzyme expression and activities. The peptide ODN is thus a potential candidate for the development of specific agonists that would selectively mimic its protective activity.",

Gastric pH recorded during 5\u00a0days in the presence of pentagastrin was 1.83 (\u00b10.06). YF476 raised pH to 3.67 (\u00b10.09) and plasma ghrelin, gastrin, and somatostatin increased. YF476 increased gene expression of somatostatin receptor and gastrin, while ghrelin receptor decreased; transcripts coding ghrelin, somatostatin, and CCK-2R remained unchanged. In the presence of diclofenac, esomeprazole increased expression of all these transcripts and that of iNOS, while YF476 yielded only decreased CCK-2R and increased iNOS transcripts. YF476 is a potential new preventative treatment for patients at risk of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced ulceration. Gastric gene expressions of ghrelin, gastrin, and somatostatin and their receptors differ between esomeprazole and YF476. Despite these differences and different modes of action to raise gastric pH, both drugs acutely increase iNOS, suggesting iNOS expression parallels pH.", 
    "173": "Conventional mammillary models are frequently used for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis when only blood or plasma data are available. Such models depend on the quality of the drug disposition data and have vague biological features. An alternative minimal-physiologically-based PK (minimal-PBPK) modeling approach is proposed which inherits and lumps major physiologic attributes from whole-body PBPK models. The body and model are represented as actual blood and tissue (usually total body weight) volumes, fractions (f ( d )) of cardiac output with Fick's Law of Perfusion, tissue/blood partitioning (K ( p )), and systemic or intrinsic clearance. Analyzing only blood or plasma concentrations versus time, the minimal-PBPK models parsimoniously generate physiologically-relevant PK parameters which are more easily interpreted than those from mammillary models. The minimal-PBPK models were applied to four types of therapeutic agents and conditions. The models well captured the human PK profiles of 22 selected beta-lactam antibiotics allowing comparison of fitted and calculated K ( p ) values. Adding a classical hepatic compartment with hepatic blood flow allowed joint fitting of oral and intravenous (IV) data for four hepatic elimination drugs (dihydrocodeine, verapamil, repaglinide, midazolam) providing separate estimates of hepatic intrinsic clearance, non-hepatic clearance, and pre-hepatic bioavailability. The basic model was integrated with allometric scaling principles to simultaneously describe moxifloxacin PK in five species with common K ( p ) and f ( d ) values. A basic model assigning clearance to the tissue compartment well characterized plasma concentrations of six monoclonal antibodies in human subjects, providing good concordance of predictions with expected tissue kinetics. The proposed minimal-PBPK modeling approach offers an alternative and more rational basis for assessing PK than compartmental models.",

All dogs showed no abnormalities on clinical and echocardiographic examination. Venous blood samples were drawn within 12 h of induction and 12 h after discontinuation of anesthesia. Each dog was premedicated with methadone i.v. and induced with diazepam i.v. and propofol i.v.. Anesthesia was maintained using isoflurane in oxygen in combination with a continuous rate infusion of fentanyl. The cTnI concentrations were measured using a third generation chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay with a detection limit of 0.01 ng/mL (below this level '<0.01 ng/mL'). Ten dogs (55%) had a post-anesthetic increase of cTnI concentration relative to their pre-anesthetic cTnI concentration, whereas a decrease was observed in two dogs (11%). This study shows that cTnI can increase in healthy dogs undergoing general anesthesia.", 
    "175": "Work related psychosocial stress can be accompanied by so called burnout syndrome with symptoms of mental exhaustion, physical fatigue, and cognitive dysfunction. Underlying mechanisms for acquiring burnout syndrome are not clear. Animal studies show that chronic stress is associated with altered release of GABA-A receptor modulating steroids (GAMS), altered composition of the GABA-A receptor and altered sensitivity to GAMS. In the present study we investigated if such changes occur in women with burnout syndrome. We further asked whether flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist, but with positive modulating effects on GABA-A receptors with altered subunit composition) can block the effect of the GAMS allopregnanolone. Ten women with occupational psychosocial stress and burnout syndrome were compared with twelve healthy controls in an experimental setting. Saccadic eye velocity (SEV) was measured after an injection of allopregnanolone, followed by an injection of flumazenil and a second injection of allopregnanolone. The sensitivity to allopregnanolone was significantly higher in the patients compared to controls after the first injection (p=0.04) and the difference increased when the response per allopregnanolone concentration unit was compared (p=0.006). Following the flumazenil injection the burnout patients (p=0.016), but not controls, showed a decrease in SEV and flumazenil acted like a positive modulator that is agonistic. There was no significant difference between the groups after second allopregnanolone injection. In conclusion, patients with work related psychosocial stress and burnout syndrome show a different response to GABA-A receptor modulators than controls suggesting a changed GABA-A receptor function in these patients. More precisely we hypothesize that the \u03b14 and delta subunits are up-regulated elevating the responsiveness to allopregnanolone and change the effect of flumazenil, which provides a potential explanation to the burnout syndrome. Flumazenil does not block the effect of allopregnanolone.", 
    "176": "Mesenteric vascular obstruction is difficult to characterize, since it may produce differing acute or chronic clinical pictures and various organic symptoms, such as ischemic colitis and abdominal angina. The diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is thus still mainly based on historic diagnostic criteria drawn up before non-invasive radiological imaging of the mesenteric vessels became widespread, and before the current demographic developments leading to a rise in the number of older patients with multiple pathologies. With this premise, we studied the clinical condition of 85 patients aged over 65 years of age, submitted to angio-CT scan for reasons other than neoplastic and general pathologies which may cause alterations in mesenteric blood flow, and without the typical symptoms of acute intestinal ischemia. Of these, 34 patients presented occlusion of at least one mesenteric vessel and 13 were affected by multivessel injury. Compared with controls, patients with mesenteric artery disease had lower BMI (24.9+/-3.3 vs 26.8+/-4.5) and longer hospital stays (14 vs 6 days), and were more frequently affected by vasculopathies in other districts (97.1% vs 80.4%), but the only bowel symptom present was diarrhea (21.2% vs 5.9%). These patients also took more benzodiazepines and acetylsalicylic acid. The results of stepwise logistic analysis of length of hospital stay, vasculopathies, diarrhea, and use of benzodiazepines yielded a predictive model with an AUC (area under the curve) of 0.81. Our data show that some features characterizing CMI in the geriatric population differ from those of the general population.",

    "178": "In the hippocampus, extracellular carbonic anhydrase (Car) speeds the buffering of an activity-generated rise in extracellular pH that impacts H(+)-sensitive NMDA receptors (NMDARs). We studied the role of Car14 in this brain structure, in which it is expressed solely on neurons. Current-clamp responses were recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in wild-type (WT) versus Car14 knock-out (KO) mice 2 s before (control) and after (test) a 10 pulse, 100 Hz afferent train. In both WT and KO, the half-width (HW) of the test response, and its number of spikes, were augmented relative to the control. An increase in presynaptic release was not involved, because AMPAR-mediated EPSCs were depressed after a train. The increases in HW and spike number were both greater in the Car14 KO. In 0 Mg(2+) saline with picrotoxin (using a 20 Hz train), the HW measures were still greater in the KO. The Car inhibitor benzolamide (BZ) enhanced the test response HW in the WT but had no effect on the already-prolonged HW in the KO. With intracellular MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate], the curtailed WT and KO responses were indistinguishable, and BZ caused no change. In contrast, the extracellular alkaline changes evoked by the train were not different between WT and KO, and BZ amplified these alkalinizations similarly. These data suggest that Car14 regulates pH transients in the perisynaptic microenvironment and govern their impact on NMDARs but plays little role in buffering pH shifts in the broader, macroscopic, extracellular space.", 
    "179": "The biology underlying excessive daytime sleepiness (hypersomnolence) is incompletely understood. After excluding known causes of sleepiness in 32 hypersomnolent patients, we showed that, in the presence of 10 \u03bcM \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from these subjects stimulated GABA(A) receptor function in vitro by 84.0 \u00b1 40.7% (SD) relative to the 35.8 \u00b1 7.5% (SD) stimulation obtained with CSF from control subjects (Student's t test, t = 6.47, P < 0.0001); CSF alone had no effect on GABA(A) signaling. The bioactive CSF component had a mass of 500 to 3000 daltons and was neutralized by trypsin. Enhancement was greater for \u03b12 subunit- versus \u03b11 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors and negligible for \u03b14 subunit-containing ones. CSF samples from hypersomnolent patients also modestly enhanced benzodiazepine (BZD)-insensitive GABA(A) receptors and did not competitively displace BZDs from human brain tissue. Flumazenil--a drug that is generally believed to antagonize the sedative-hypnotic actions of BZDs only at the classical BZD-binding domain in GABA(A) receptors and to lack intrinsic activity--nevertheless reversed enhancement of GABA(A) signaling by hypersomnolent CSF in vitro. Furthermore, flumazenil normalized vigilance in seven hypersomnolent patients. We conclude that a naturally occurring substance in CSF augments inhibitory GABA signaling, thus revealing a new pathophysiology associated with excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Under optimum conditions, the proposed method allowed the measurement of diazepam over the range of 2.0 \u00d7 10(-6) to 2.0 \u00d7 10(-4) mol/L with a detection limit of 5.0 \u00d7 10(-7) mol/L. The relative standard deviation for 11 parallel measurements of 2.0 \u00d7 10(-5) mol/L diazepam was 2.1%. The method was applied satisfactorily for the determination of diazepam in pharmaceutical preparations, and the results agree well with those obtained by spectrophotometry. The use of the proposed system for the determination of diazepam in urine and plasma samples was also tested. The possible mechanism of the chemiluminescence reaction is discussed briefly.",

    "182": "Weight gain as a result of atypical anti-psychotic treatment is a common issue with different atypical anti-psychotic treatments causing differing magnitudes of weight gain. Although differing amounts of weight gain result from different atypical agents little is known about the temporal course of weight gain in anti-psychotic treatment. Specifically is the time course of weight gain comparable across different agents. Therefore this article reviews the temporal course of weight gain for three common atypical anti-psychotics namely; clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone. It is evident that all three of these agents exhibit similar although at distinct magnitudes temporal courses of weight gain. That is an initial rapid increase from baseline to 3 months (stage 1), a steady increase from 3 months to 18 months (stage 2) and a plateau after this point (stage 3) with continued anti-psychotic treatment. It is postulated that each of these stages of weight gain result from distinct neural mechanisms. The hypothesized neural correlates for each stage of weight gain are reviewed and discussed. The article concludes with recommendations for future research.",

BMS-763534 accelerated the dissociation of (125)I-o-CRF from rat frontal cortex membrane CRF(1) receptors consistent with a negative allosteric modulation of CRF binding. BMS-763534 produced dose-dependent increases in CRF(1) receptor occupancy and anxiolytic efficacy; lowest effective anxiolytic dose\u00a0=\u00a00.56\u00a0mg/kg, PO, which was associated with 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% CRF(1) receptor occupancy of frontoparietal CRF(1) receptors. Sedative/ataxic effects of BMS-763534 were only observed at high dose multiples (54-179\u00d7) relative to the lowest dose required for anxiolytic efficacy. At doses of 5- to 18-fold higher than the lowest efficacious dose in the anxiety assay, BMS-763534 shared subjective effects with the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide. Interestingly BMS-790318, the O-demethylated metabolite of BMS-763534, showed weak affinity for the TBOB site of the GABA(A) receptor (67% inhibition at 10\u00a0\u03bcM) and augmented GABA evoked currents (EC(50)\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u00a0\u03bcM). Thus, the unanticipated signal in the drug discrimination assay may have resulted from an interaction of the metabolite BMS-790318 with the TBOB site on the GABA(A) channel where it appears to behave as an allosteric potentiator of GABA evoked currents.",

However, BZD treatment is negatively affected by seizure duration due to decreases in BZD-sensitive GABA(A) receptors during prolonged SE. Stiripentol (STP) is an anticonvulsant that is used as add-on treatment for Dravet Syndrome. Recent studies have shown that STP is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor. The subunit selectivity of STP at this receptor suggests that it would be anticonvulsant in both brief as well as prolonged SE. We tested this possibility by comparing the ability of STP and diazepam (DZP), a commonly used BZD, to terminate behavioral convulsions in a rodent model of pharmacoresistant SE. We found that STP was anticonvulsant in this model and remained effective during prolonged SE, unlike DZP which exhibited a 14 fold increase in its ED(50). Whole cell recording from hippocampal slices from these animals revealed that STP potentiated GABAergic IPSCs, as well as tonic GABAergic current by acting at a site on the GABA(A) receptor separate from the BDZ binding site. Potentiation of GABAergic currents by STP remained intact during prolonged SE, while potentiation by DZP was lost. Both IPSC potentiation and anticonvulsant activity of STP were greater in younger animals than in adults. These findings suggest that at doses that yield therapeutically relevant concentrations, STP is anticonvulsant by potentiating GABAergic inhibition and that the subunit selectivity profile of STP enables it to remain effective despite GABA(A) receptor subunit changes during prolonged SE.",

The effect of CoQ10 on evoked glutamate release was abolished by blocking the Cav2.2 (N-type) and Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca2+ channels and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK). In addition, CoQ10 decreased the 4-AP-induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and synaptic vesicle-associated protein synapsin I, a major presynaptic substrate for ERK. Moreover, the inhibition of glutamate release by CoQ10 was strongly attenuated in mice without synapsin I. These results suggest that CoQ10 inhibits glutamate release from cortical synaptosomes in rats through the suppression of the presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca2+ entry and ERK/synapsin I signaling pathway.", 
    "218": "Inpatient falls are associated with significant morbidity and increased healthcare costs. Zolpidem has been reported to decrease balance and is associated with falls. Yet, it is a commonly used hypnotic agent in the inpatient setting. Zolpidem use in hospitalized patients may be a significant and potentially modifiable risk factor for falling.",

    "222": "Adult inpatients who were prescribed zolpidem were identified. Electronic medical records were reviewed to capture demographics and other risk factors for falls. The fall rate was compared in those administered zolpidem versus those only prescribed zolpidem. Multivariate analyses were performed to determine whether zolpidem was independently associated with falls.", 
    "223": "The fall rate among patients who were prescribed and received zolpidem (n = 4962) was significantly greater than among patients who were prescribed but did not receive zolpidem (n = 11,358) (3.04% vs 0.71%; P < 0.001). Zolpidem use continued to remain significantly associated with increased fall risk after accounting for age, gender, insomnia, delirium status, dose of zolpidem, Charlson comorbidity index, Hendrich's fall risk score, length of hospital stay, presence of visual impairment, gait abnormalities, and dementia/cognitive impairment (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.34-5.76; P < 0.001).

    "225": "The present study aimed to investigate the distribution of the octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) in the goldfish brain and to look for a possible effect of ODN on somatolactin (SL) release from pituitary cells. A discrete population of ODN-immunoreactive neurones was localised in the lateral part of the nucleus lateralis tuberis. These neurones sent projections through the neurohypophyseal tract towards the neurohypophysis, and nerve fibres were seen in the close vicinity of SL-producing cells in the pars intermedia. Incubation of cultured goldfish pituitary cells with graded concentrations of ODN (10(-9) -10(-5\u00a0) m) induced a dose-dependent stimulation of SL-\u03b2, but not SL-\u03b1, release. ODN-evoked SL release was blocked by the metabotrophic endozepine receptor antagonist cyclo(1-8) [DLeu(5) ]OP but was not affected by the central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. ODN-induced SL release was suppressed by treatment with the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122 but not with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H-89. These results indicate that, in fish, ODN produced by hypothalamic neurones acts as a hypophysiotrophic neuropeptide stimulating SL release. The effect of ODN is mediated through a metabotrophic endozepine receptor positively coupled to the PLC/inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/protein kinase C-signalling pathway.", 
    "226": "Startle syndromes are paroxysmal and show stimulus sensitivity, placing them in the differential diagnosis of epileptic seizures. Startle syndromes form a heterogeneous group of disorders with three categories: hyperekplexia (HPX), stimulus-induced disorders, and neuropsychiatric syndromes. HPX is characterized by an exaggerated motor startle reflex combined with stiffness and is caused by mutations in different parts of the inhibitory glycine receptor, leading to brainstem pathology. The preserved consciousness distinguishes it from epileptic seizures. Clonazepam is the first-choice therapy. The stimulus-induced disorders cover a broad range of epileptic and nonepileptic disorders, and distinguishing the two can be difficult. Additional information from electroencephalography (EEG) and video registration can help. Many stimulus-induced disorders now have an identified gene defect. Antiepileptic drugs, including benzodiazepines, are frequently mentioned as the best treatment option. Neuropsychiatric syndromes are on the borderland of neurology and psychiatry, and their etiology is poorly understood. These syndromes include startle-induced tics, culture-specific disorders such as Latah, and functional startle syndromes. The electromyography (EMG) startle reflex in these syndromes is characterized by variable recruitment patterns and the presence of a second \"orienting\" response. Treatment options are limited, but urgently required. In the clinical setting, the patient's history and a (home) video recording together with genetic and electrophysiologic testing help to classify these challenging disorders.",

    "228": "Two double-blind, double-dummy, randomized controlled trials (Pilot study, European sample(\u2020) of MOTHER-trial) comparing buprenorphine and methadone in opioid-dependent pregnant women were conducted. In both studies, participants received voucher-based incentives for attendance and completion of study assessments. In the MOTHER trial, participants additionally received escalating voucher incentives for drug-free urine samples. Neonatal abstinence syndrome was treated with oral morphine solution based on standardized modified Finnegan scores.", 
    "229": "After a mean treatment period of 13.79 weeks in the Pilot study (PS, n = 18) and 20.78 weeks in the MOTHER-trial (MT, n = 41), respectively (p < 0.001), PS patients delivered at mean doses of 14.00 mg buprenorphine/52.50 mg methadone and MT participants at 13.44 mg buprenorphine/63.68 mg methadone. Nonsignificant differences regarding dropout rates were found (22% in PS versus 10% in MT), but dropout was significantly earlier in the MT (p = 0.013). Significantly higher rates of concomitant consumption of opioids and benzodiazepines occurred in the PS compared with the MT (p < 0.001), however, with no significant differences in neonatal data between both settings.",

    "231": "The study was originally designed to test the hypothesis that the compensatory increase in intestinal P450 (cytochrome P450) expression in the intestinal epithelium-specific P450 reductase (CPR) knockout (IE-Cpr-null) mice was attributable to decreased metabolism of putative P450 inducers present in the diet. Thus, we determined the impact of a dietary change from regular rodent chow to a synthetic diet devoid of phytochemicals on the expression of P450 enzymes in the small intestine (SI) and liver of wild-type (WT) and IE-Cpr-null mice. The dietary change diminished expression of CYP1A, 2B, 2C, and 3A in SI and CYP2B, 2C, and 3A in liver of both WT and IE-Cpr-null mice. However, the compensatory increase in SI P450 expression still occurred in IE-Cpr-null, compared with WT, mice, on the synthetic diet. The diet change-induced decrease in P450 expression was accompanied by decreases in microsomal midazolam-hydroxylase activity in vitro and first-pass clearance of midazolam in vivo in WT mice. Further studies showed that the dietary change, but not Cpr deletion, caused large decreases in bile acid (BA) levels in plasma, liver, SI, and intestinal content and that treatment of WT mice on the synthetic diet with GW4064, a farnesoid-X-receptor agonist, restored the levels of CYP3A expression in both liver and SI to those seen in mice fed with regular chow. Taken together, these results highlight the vital role of diet in maintaining adequate expression of major drug-metabolizing P450s and their associated drug-metabolizing activities in the digestive tract and suggest potential involvement of BA signaling in the regulatory mechanisms.", 
    "232": "Trends in forensic toxicology show the introduction of rapid analytical methods for the simultaneous quantitative analysis of drugs. The authors present a fatal case involving a 32-year-old male, found dead in bed by his mother, with several blue, white and orange pills next to the body. Empty tablets were found in the trash bin and a suicide note was on the desk. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and had been under psychiatric treatment, having repeatedly demonstrated intent to commit suicide. A rapid method was developed to determine 55 different medicines and 32 benzodiazepines in blood by ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) with electrospray ionization source in positive and negative ion mode. Chromatographic analysis was preceded by an optimized solid-phase extraction procedure using Oasis(\u00ae) HLB (3 cc, 60 mg) extraction columns. The extracted analytes were separated by UPLC (Waters) with a reversed-phase Acquity UPLC(\u00ae) HSS T3 (2.1\u00d7100 mm id, 1.8 \u03bcm) column with acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as mobile phase, at 0.5 mL/min flow rate and a chromatographic run-time of 8 min. Analytes detection was achieved with a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer in positive and negative electrospray ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). Two MRM transitions were monitored for each target-compound and one for each deuterated internal standards. Toxicological results showed high blood concentrations of antipsychotics (haloperidol, olanzapine and quetiapine), antidepressants (fluoxetine and paroxetine) and anxiolytics (bromazepam and lorazepam). Risperidone and other benzodiazepines were also present in therapeutic concentrations. Neither alcohol nor illicit drugs were present in the analyzed samples. The UPLC-MS-MS method showed to be appropriate for screening, identification and quantitation of antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics and antiepileptic drugs in blood after intake of therapeutic as well as toxic doses. The autopsy and toxicological results led the pathologist to rule that death was due to a mixed-drug intoxication. The manner of death was determined to be suicide.", 
    "233": "Better treatment of status epilepticus (SE), which typically becomes refractory after about 30 min, will require new pharmacotherapies. The effect of sec-butyl-propylacetamide (SPD), an amide derivative of valproic acid (VPA), on electrographic status epilepticus (ESE) was compared quantitatively to other standard-of-care compounds. Cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from rats during ESE induced with lithium-pilocarpine. Using a previously-published algorithm, the effects of SPD on ESE were compared quantitatively to other relevant compounds. To confirm benzodiazepine resistance, diazepam (DZP) was shown to suppress ESE when administered 15 min after the first motor seizure, but not after 30 min (100mg/kg). VPA (300 mg/kg) also lacked efficacy at 30 min. SPD (130 mg/kg) strongly suppressed ESE at 30 min, less after 45 min, and not at 60 min. At a higher dose (180 mg/kg), SPD profoundly suppressed ESE at 60 min, similar to propofol (100mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg). After 4-6h of SPD-induced suppression, EEG activity often overshot control levels at 7-12h. Valnoctamide (VCD, 180 mg/kg), an SPD homolog, was also efficacious at 30 min. SPD blocks pilocarpine-induced electrographic seizures when administered at 1h after the first motor seizure. SPD has a faster onset and greater efficacy than DZP and VPA, and is similar to propofol and pentobarbital. SPD and structurally similar compounds may be useful for the treatment of refractory ESE. Further development and use of automated analyses of ESE may facilitate drug discovery for refractory SE."
