On the basis of this structure, a novel derivative bearing a [(13)C]butynoate moiety has been designed and synthesized (three steps-42% overall yield) providing, upon rapid and quantitative para-hydrogenation, the corresponding hyperpolarized [(13)C]alkene. Para-hydrogen-induced polarization effects have been detected in both (1)H and (13)C-NMR spectra. Upon applying a field cycling procedure, the spin order of para-H(2) added hydrogens is transferred on the (13)C carboxylate moiety yielding a signal enhancement of approximately 4500 times. T(1) of the carboxylate carbon atom is approximately 21.9 s (at 9.37 T). A (13)C-MR image has been acquired by using the (13)C RARE (Rapid Acquisition by Relaxation Enhancement) acquisition protocol on a 10-mM solution. The main limitation to the in vivo use of this novel para-hydrogenated [(13)C]derivative is its relatively low solubility in aqueous systems.", 
    "1": "Pharmacoepidemiology investigates associations between time-varying medication use/dose and risk of adverse events. Applied research typically relies on a priori chosen simple conventional models, such as current dose or any use in the past 3\u2009months. However, different models imply different risk predictions, and only one model can be etiologically correct in any specific applications. We first formally defined several candidate models mapping the time vector of past drug doses (X (t), t \u2009=\u2009 1,\u2009\u2026\u2009,u) into the value of a time-varying exposure metric M(u) at current time u. In addition to conventional one-parameter models, we considered two-parameter models accounting for recent dose increase or withdrawal and a flexible spline-based weighted cumulative exposure (WCE) model that defines M(u) as the weighted sum of past doses. In simulations, we generated event times assuming one of the models was correct and then analyzed the data with all candidate models. We demonstrated that the minimum AIC criterion is able to identify the correct model as the best-fitting model or one of the equivalent (within 4 AIC points of the minimum) models in a vast majority of simulated samples, especially with 500 or more events. We also showed how relying on an incorrect a priori chosen model may largely reduce the power to test for an association. Finally, we demonstrated how the flexible WCE estimates may help with model diagnostics even if the correct model is not WCE. We illustrated the practical advantages of AIC-based a posteriori model selection and WCE modeling in a real-life pharmacoepidemiology example.", 
    "2": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients often develop psychotic symptoms that severely affect quality of life and limit the use of medications to ameliorate motor symptoms. Psychotic symptoms are a major cause for nursing home placement. While these symptoms do not always require treatment, they often do but antipsychotic drugs all share the common pharmacological mechanism of blocking dopamine D2 receptors which may worsen motor problems in this very vulnerable population. Double blind, placebo controlled trials (DBPCT) have shown that clozapine is effective at controlling the psychotic symptoms at doses far below those used in schizophrenia, without worsening motor function, even improving tremor. DBPCT have demonstrated that olanzapine worsens motor function without improving psychosis. Quetiapine has been shown in DBPCT to be free of motor side effects in PD patients but not effective, whereas many open label studies have indicated that quetiapine is effective. The other atypical have been the subjects of conflicting open label reports. The effects of the atypicals in PD psychosis is reviewed.",

Most trials did not describe baseline traumatic brain injury prognostic factors or important cointerventions. Eight trials possibly or definitely concealed allocation and six were blinded. Insufficient data exist regarding the effects of sedative agents on neurologic outcome or mortality. Although their effects are likely transient, bolus doses of opioids may increase intracranial pressure and decrease cerebral perfusion pressure. In one study, a long-term infusion of propofol vs. morphine was associated with a reduced requirement for intracranial pressure-lowering cointerventions and a lower intracranial pressure on the third day. Trials of propofol vs. midazolam and ketamine vs. sufentanil found no difference between agents in intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure.",

Various drugs have been used in attempting to treat BMS, but there is insufficient evidence to show the effect of any effective treatment. The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of therapies for BMS. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients with a diagnosis of BMS were identified by searching Pubmed and Scoppus databases. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed on the basis of the method of allocation concealment, blindness of the study, loss of participants, size sample, and outcome concealment. A total of 12 relevant articles were analyzed. Therapies that used capsaicin, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), and clonazepam were those that showed more reduction in symptoms of BMS. However, many studies of therapeutic interventions in BMS lack consistency in their results, because they use in their methodology, sample and a relatively short time of therapy and often do not provide a follow-up of patients treated. Thus, future studies are required to establish the treatment for patients suffering from this chronic and painful syndrome.",

However, all those studies have been performed using competitive group II non-selective orthosteric antagonists. In this study we extensively characterized a group II selective negative allosteric modulator (4-[3-(2,6-Dimethylpyridin-4-yl)phenyl]-7-methyl-8-trifluoromethyl-1,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]diazepin-2-one, namely RO4491533, Woltering et al., 2010) in several in vitro biochemical assays and in vivo models of depression. In vitro, RO4491533 completely blocked the glutamate-induced Ca(2+) mobilization and the glutamate-induced accumulation in [(35)S]GTP(\u03b3S) binding in cells expressing recombinant human or rat mGluR2 and in native tissues. Results from Schild plot experiments and reversibility test at the target on both cellular and membrane-based assays confirmed the negative allosteric modulator properties of the compound. RO4491533 was equipotent on mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors but not active on any other mGluRs. RO4491533 has acceptable PK properties in mice and rats, is bioavailable following oral gavage (F = 30%) and brain-penetrant (CSF conc/total plasma conc ratio = 0.8%). RO4491533 appeared to engage the central mGluR2 and mGluR3 receptors since the compound reversed the hypolocomotor effect of an mGluR2/3 orthosteric agonist LY379268 in a target-specific manner, as did the group II orthosteric mGluR2/3 antagonist LY341495. RO4491533 and LY341495 dose-dependently reduced immobility time of C57Bl6/J mice in the forced swim test. Also, RO4491533 and LY341495 were active in the tail suspension test in a line of Helpless (H) mice, a putative genetic model of depression.

    "62": "The maintenance dose of a drug is dependent on drug clearance, and thus any biochemical and physiological changes in obesity that affect parameters such as cardiac output, renal function, expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and protein binding may result in altered clearance compared with that observed in normal-weight subjects (corrected or uncorrected for body weight). Because of the increasing worldwide incidence of obesity, there is a need for more information regarding the optimal dosing of drug therapy to be made available to prescribers. This is usually provided via clinical studies in obese people; however, such studies are not available for all drugs that might be used in obese subjects. Incorporation of the relevant physiological and biochemical changes into predictive bottom-up pharmacokinetic models in order to optimize dosage regimens may offer a logical way forward for the cases where no clinical data exist. The aims of the current report are to apply such a 'systems approach' to identify the likelihood of observing variations in the clearance of drugs in obesity and morbid obesity for a set of compounds for which clinical data, as well as the necessary in vitro information, are available, and to provide a framework for assessing other drugs in the future.",

These libraries, together with mechanistic in vitro-in vivo extrapolations (IVIVE) within the Simcyp Population-based Simulator\u2122, were used to predict the clearance of oral alprazolam, oral caffeine, oral chlorzoxazone, oral ciclosporin, intravenous and oral midazolam, intravenous phenytoin, oral theophylline and oral triazolam. The design of the simulated studies was matched as closely as possible with that of the clinical studies. Outcome was measured by the predicted ratio of the clearance of the drug in obese and lean subjects\u2009\u00b1\u2009its 90% confidence interval, compared with observed values. The overall statistical measures of the performance of the model to detect differences in compound clearance between obese and lean populations were investigated by measuring sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV). A power calculation was carried out to investigate the impact of the sample size on the overall outcome of clinical studies.",

The overall statistical measures of the performance of the Simcyp Simulator were 100% sensitivity, 66% specificity, 60% PPV and 100% NPV.

    "75": "Behavioral flexibility, the ability to modify responses due to changing task demands, is detrimentally affected by aging with a shift towards increased cognitive rigidity. The neurobiological basis of this cognitive deficit is not clear although striatal cholinergic neurotransmission has been implicated. To investigate the possible association between striatal acetylcholine signaling with age-related changes in behavioral flexibility, young, middle-aged, and aged F344 X Brown Norway F1 rats were assessed using an attentional set-shifting task that includes two tests of behavioral flexibility: reversal learning and an extra-dimensional shift. Rats were also assessed in the Morris water maze to compare potential fronto-striatal-dependent deficits with hippocampal-dependent deficits. Behaviorally characterized rats were then assessed for acetylcholine muscarinic signaling within the striatum using oxotremorine-M-stimulated [(35)S]GTP\u03b3S binding and [(3)H]AFDX-384 receptor binding autoradiography. The results showed that by old age, cognitive deficits were pronounced across cognitive domains, suggesting deterioration of both hippocampal and fronto-striatal regions. A significant decline in oxotremorine-M-stimulated [(35)S]GTP\u03b3S binding was limited to the dorsomedial striatum of aged rats when compared to young and middle-aged rats. There was no effect of age on striatal [(3)H]AFDX-384 receptor binding. These results suggest that a decrease in M2/M4 muscarinic receptor coupling is involved in the age-associated decline in behavioral flexibility.", 
    "76": "Centrosome amplification (also known as centrosome overduplication) is common in cancer cells and can be induced by DNA damaging agents. However, the mechanism and significance of centrosome amplification during carcinogenesis or after DNA damage are not clear. Previously, we showed that centrosome amplification could be induced by 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. In this paper, we determined if the effect of 3-AB on centrosome amplification was dependent on DNA damage in CHO-K1 cells. We used the well-known mutagen/carcinogen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Ten micromolar MNNG and 10 mM 3-AB induced significant centrosome amplification in 18.1 \u00b1 1.1% and 19.4 \u00b1 1.8% of CHO-K1 cells, respectively, compared to 7.0 \u00b1 0.5% of untreated CHO-K1 cells. AG14361, another potent inhibitor of PARPs, also induced centrosome amplification. We then used \u03b3-H2AX analysis and alkaline comet assays to show that 10 \u03bcM MNNG induced a significant number of DNA lesions and cell cycle arrest at the G(2) /M phase. However, 10 mM 3-AB neither induced DNA lesions nor altered cell cycle progression. In the umu test, 10 \u03bcM MNNG was mutagenic, but 10 mM 3-AB was not. In addition, 10 \u03bcM MNNG induced significant accumulation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated protein in the nuclei, but 10 mM 3-AB did not. Thus, we found no association between apparent DNA lesions and centrosome amplification after 3-AB treatment. Therefore, we propose the presence of a novel pathway for centrosome amplification that does not necessarily require DNA lesions but involves regulation of epigenetic changes or post-translational modifications including polyADP-ribosylation.",

For patients at high risk of addiction, opioids should be reserved for well-defined nociceptive or neuropathic pain conditions that have not responded to first-line treatments. Opioids should be titrated slowly, with frequent dispensing and close monitoring for signs of misuse. Suspected opioid addiction is managed with structured opioid therapy, methadone or buprenorphine treatment, or abstinence-based treatment. Patients with mood and anxiety disorders tend to have a blunted analgesic response to opioids, are at higher risk of misuse, and are often taking sedating drugs that interact adversely with opioids. Precautions similar to those for other high-risk patients should be employed. The opioid should be tapered if the patient's pain remains severe despite an adequate trial of opioid therapy. In the elderly, sedation, falls, and overdose can be minimized through lower initial doses, slower titration, benzodiazepine tapering, and careful patient education. For pregnant women taking daily opioid therapy, the opioids should be slowly tapered and discontinued. If this is not possible, they should be tapered to the lowest effective dose. Opioid-dependent pregnant women should receive methadone treatment. Adolescents are at high risk of opioid overdose, misuse, and addiction. Patients with adolescents living at home should store their opioid medication safely. Adolescents rarely require long-term opioid therapy.",

A low initial dose and slow upward titration is recommended, with patient education and close monitoring. Physicians should watch for the development of complications such as sleep apnea. The optimal dose is one which improves function or decreases pain ratings by at least 30%. For by far most patients, the optimal dose will be well below a 200-mg morphine equivalent dose per day.

A 71-year old woman diagnosed with SPS complained of marked stiffness of trunk and lower limb muscles with sudden painful spasms. She was unable to walk and she could not lean on her right leg. Cortical silent period (CSP) duration evaluated from right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) with transcranial magnetic stimulation was shortened. Polygraphic electromyographic (EMG) evaluation from paraspinal and leg muscles disclosed continuous motor unit activity at rest with interference muscular pattern. Symptomatic treatment with diazepam was withdrawn because of excessive sedation. In order to relieve the intense lumbar pain, she was prescribed pregabalin; since the day after, rigidity and painful spasms dramatically improved and she could walk without assistance. The clinical benefit persisted at 3 months follow-up and was paralleled by almost complete disappearance of EMG activity at rest and prolongation of CSP.

    "111": "As the armamentarium for sedation in the critically ill expands, opportunities will develop to modulate the immune responses of patients by way of the direct immune and neural-immune interactions of the sedatives. Control of autonomic activity through the use of appropriate sedation may be critical in this matter. Likewise analgesic-based sedation, with increased opioid dosage, may not prove beneficial in the setting of infection; whether avoidance of morphine in preference for a fentanyl derivative will help is unclear. However, as the immune effects seem dependent on the m receptor, it is improbable that a significant difference would be uncovered. Similarly, the present evidence suggests benzodiazepines are deleterious in infection; further studies are required urgently to evaluate this evidence. As an alternative to benzodiazepine-based sedation, dexmedetomidine has shown a remarkable 70% mortality benefit in a small secondary analysis of septic patients from the MENDS trial. Further powered clinical studies should now be undertaken to investigate the potential benefit of the \u03b12-adrenoceptor agonist in this setting, with comparisons with propofol.", 
    "112": "Limitations are inherent to surveys. Most surveys have low response rates, which raises the issue of responder bias. Another limitation of self-report surveys stems from the possible differences between stated and actual practice. That is, what physicians report that they do in surveys often contrasts significantly with what they do in observational studies, as highlighted by the Canadian surveys conducted in 2002 and 2008. Some surveys report estimates provided by ICU nurse managers or physician directors, potentially resulting in inaccurate estimates or data reflecting the individuals practice rather than the entire ICU. Surveys may not reflect how different specialists practice; for example, the German surveys collected data only in ICUs run by anesthesiologists.Notwithstanding these limitations, surveys provide a wealth of information on current practice and determinants of practice, and serve as a useful tool to guide future research and educational interventions. The authors identified substantial international variation in the use of sedative and analgesic drugs, and marked changes over the last 10 years. Overall, there is a trend toward lighter sedation, along with a shift from benzodiazepines toward propofol, and from morphine toward fentanyl and remifentanil. Despite the publication of numerous studies and guidelines for sedation and analgesia, actual practice differs from recommended practice, suggesting that the impact of clinical trials and guidelines on physician practice is quite low. It is clear that there remain substantial barriers to the incorporation of sedation scales, protocols,and daily interruption into routine ICU care.", 
    "113": "The ideal sedative or analgesic agent should have a rapid onset of activity, a rapid recovery after drug discontinuation, a predictable dose response, a lack of drug accumulation,and no toxicity. Unfortunately, none of the earlier analgesics, the benzodiazepines,or propofol share all of these characteristics. Patients who are critically ill experience numerous physiologic derangements and commonly require high doses and long durations of analgesic and sedative therapy. There is a paucity of well designed clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of earlier sedative and analgesic agents in the ICU. In addition, the ever-changing dynamics of patients who are critically ill makes the use of sedation a continual challenge during the course of each patient\u2019s admission. To optimize care, clinicians should be familiar with the many pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and pharmacogenetic variables that can affect the safety and efficacy of sedatives and analgesics.",

When coupled with liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, the procedure often involves large numbers of fibers in, for example, both pharmacokinetic and pharmadynamic studies as well as other bioapplications. In this regard, appropriate and adequate precaution will be critical in preventing the fibers firstly from any possible external contamination and damage to maintain high analytical data integrity. In addition, improving the offline desorption of fibers specifically for in vivo SPME will not only help in improving data quality, but will also significantly decrease the overall analysis time. This article introduces a prototype multi-fiber handling device capable of simultaneous extraction/desorption of multiple solid phase microextraction (SPME) fibers on a 96-deep well plate format. This device thus provides an alternative approach to improving higher sample throughput for in vivo SPME liquid chromatography mass spectrometry applications. The portable design of the device ensures effective protection and prevention of fibers against damage and possible contamination and thus maintains analytical data reliability. To ensure its suitability for parallel extraction/desorption, the device was carefully evaluated using four benzodiazepines (diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam and lorazepam) as model drugs by monitoring inter- and intra-well variability. The effect of agitation speed on data precision and accuracy, effect of device weight on data precision, and comparison of the overall performance of the device with traditional manual desorption approach were also assessed. Results obtained from evaluation of the device with particular focus on the desorption process indicated that the weight of the device has no effect on the reliability and reproducibility of data acquired using the device. The average amount of diazepam obtained for 20 selected wells with and without device was 48.8pg and 49.4pg, respectively. Intra-, inter-well, and inter fiber variations recorded were all \u226413% indicating an excellent precision and reproducibility can be attained with the device.",

The chemical profile of essential oil was determined by GC-MS. Applied doses of PO were 0.1 and 0.2\u2009mL/kg. Chronic PO intake (in both doses) led to significant decrease of analgesic effect of codeine, while acute intake of PO did not change this effect. Acute PO pretreatment in higher dose caused significant prolongation of pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time, while it was significantly shortened by chronic PO pretreatment at the same dose. Midazolam effect was enhanced and prolonged significantly by chronic PO intake at higher dose, while acute intake of PO did not change this effect. Gut motility was increased only by acute intake of higher PO dose.

Caco-2 cells and everted gut sacs were used as models of intestinal mucosa to assess intestinal absorption of R-123, while rat intestinal microsomes were utilized to examine the effect of P123 and F127 on in vitro midazolam metabolism. P123 and F127 were observed to increase the intracellular accumulation of R-123 in Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. P123 significantly lowered the efflux ratio of R-123 at two concentrations in Caco-2 monolayers, whereas F127 lowered the efflux ratio only at 1%. Moreover, both pluronics markedly enhanced mucosal to serosal absorption of R-123 in excised ileum of rats. However, no significant difference in relative enzyme activity were observed between P123- or F127-treated and control groups, regardless of the concentrations of P123 and F127 studied. Collectively, these results obtained from the present study demonstrated that P123 and F127 were capable of inhibiting the intestinal P-gp activity, but had little or no effect on intestinal cytochrome P450 3A activity, indicating that P123 and F127 can potentially be used as pharmaceutical ingredients to improve the oral bioavailability of coadministered P-gp substrates via P-gp efflux pump inhibition.",

    "136": "GABA(A) receptors are ligand-gated chloride channels composed of five subunits that can belong to different subunit classes. The existence of 19 different subunits gives rise to a multiplicity of GABA(A) receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition; regional, cellular and subcellular distribution; and pharmacology. Most of these receptors are composed of two \u03b1, two \u03b2 and one \u03b32 subunits. GABA(A) receptors are the site of action of a variety of pharmacologically and clinically important drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neuroactive steroids, anaesthetics and convulsants. Whereas GABA acts at the two extracellular \u03b2(+) \u03b1(-) interfaces of GABA(A) receptors, the allosteric modulatory benzodiazepines interact with the extracellular \u03b1(+) \u03b32(-) interface. In contrast, barbiturates, neuroactive steroids and anaesthetics seem to interact with solvent accessible pockets in the transmembrane domain. Several benzodiazepine site ligands have been identified that selectively interact with GABA(A) receptor subtypes containing \u03b12\u03b2\u03b32, \u03b13\u03b2\u03b32 or \u03b15\u03b2\u03b32 subunits. This indicates that the different \u03b1 subunit types present in these receptors convey sufficient structural differences to the benzodiazepine binding site to allow specific interaction with certain benzodiazepine site ligands. Recently, a novel drug binding site was identified at the \u03b1(+) \u03b2(-) interface. This binding site is homologous to the benzodiazepine binding site at the \u03b1(+) \u03b32(-) interface and is thus also strongly influenced by the type of \u03b1 subunit present in the receptor. Drugs interacting with this binding site cannot directly activate but only allosterically modulate GABA(A) receptors. The possible importance of such drugs addressing a spectrum of receptor subtypes completely different from that of benzodiazepines is discussed.",

For all quality indicators, the proportion of patients with poor QDT was greater in patients with MDD than in patients with OP (all P<0.0001). Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for poor QDT (MDD patients vs. OP patients) ranged from 1.47 (1.30-1.65) to 7.08 (6.30-7.96) and from 1.36 (1.18-1.57) to 5.48 (4.76-6.30), respectively.", 
    "173": "Patients with MDD have poorer QDT than patients with OP. This cannot be explained by differences in age, sex, burden of disease, or residence. These findings must be taken into account when designing alternative prescribing systems. Further research is needed to evaluate causative factors and if the findings also apply to other dose dispensing systems.", 
    "174": "Studies of the neurocognitive effects of long-term benzodiazepine use have been confounded by the presence of neurocognitive deficits characterizing the clinical conditions for which these medications are taken. Similarly, studies of the neurocognitive effects of anxiety disorders have been confounded by the inclusion of chronically benzodiazepine-medicated patients. This study was designed to tease apart the potentially confounding effects of long-term benzodiazepine use and panic disorder (PD) on memory and visuoconstructive abilities.", 
    "175": "Twenty chronically benzodiazepine-medicated and 20 benzodiazepine-free patients with PD with agoraphobia were compared with a group of 20 normal control participants, group-matched for age, education, and gender on a battery of neuropsychological tests assessing short-term, episodic long-term, and semantic memory, as well as visuoconstructive abilities.", 
    "176": "Results indicated that benzodiazepine-free panic patients were relatively impaired in nonverbal short-term and nonverbal episodic long-term memory and visuoconstructive abilities, whereas verbal short-term and verbal episodic memory and semantic memory were preserved. Only limited evidence was found for more pronounced impairments in chronically benzodiazepine-medicated PD patients.", 
    "177": "This study provides evidence that patients with PD are characterized by relative impairments in nonverbal memory and visuoconstructive abilities, independent of benzodiazepine use. Nonetheless, we found evidence that chronic treatment with benzodiazepines is associated with intensification of select relative impairments in this realm. Documentation of these deficits raises questions about the broader etiology of neurocognitive impairment in PD as well as its impact on daily functioning.",

    "180": "Use of screening tools, routine structured diagnostic interviews, and practice guidelines was infrequent. Over one-third of patients did not receive their initial psychiatric consultation within a month after referral. A total of 45% of patients had symptoms for 2 years or longer before being diagnosed and treated. Most patients had been treated with benzodiazepines before referral. 80% of respondents always or often prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), 43% serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or pregabalin (35%) as first-line treatments. The most frequently recommended second-line treatments were SNRIs (41%) and pregabalin (36%). Concentration difficulties, fatigue, excessive worrying and pain were reported as the symptoms most difficult to manage.", 
    "181": "Patients with GAD have frequently been treated with benzodiazepines before referral to a psychiatrist. SSRIs were the preferred first-line treatment, and SNRIs and pregabalin preferred second-line treatments. Reported practice in this sample appears largely consistent with recent evidence-based treatment guidelines.", 
    "182": "The use of benzodiazepines is associated with increased risk of fall-related injuries in the elderly. However, it is unclear if the risks vary across the products and how they depend on the pattern of use and dosage. Specifically, the possibility of cumulative effects of past benzodiazepine use has not been thoroughly investigated.", 
    "183": "We used the administrative database for a cohort of 23,765 new users of benzodiazepines, aged 65 years and older, in Quebec, Canada, between 1990 and 1994. The associations between the use of seven benzodiazepines and the risk of fall-related injuries were assessed using several statistical models, including a novel weighted cumulative exposure model. That model assigns to each dose taken in the past a weight that represents the importance of that dose in explaining the current risk of fall.", 
    "184": "For flurazepam, the best-fitting model indicated a cumulative effect of doses taken in the last two weeks. Uninterrupted use of flurazepam in the past months was associated with a highly significant increase in the risk of fall-related injuries (HR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.45-4.34). The cumulative effect of a 30-day exposure to alprazolam was 1.27 (1.13-1.42). For temazepam, the results suggested a potential withdrawal effect.", 
    "185": "Mechanisms affecting the risk of falls differ across benzodiazepines, and may include cumulative effects of use in the previous few weeks. Thus, benzodiazepine-specific analyses that account for individual patterns of use should be preferred over simpler analyses that group different benzodiazepines together and limit exposure to current use or current dose.", 
    "186": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed in Australia, despite concerns about their potential for abuse and dependence. Paradoxical reactions, disinhibition and amnesia are all associated with benzodiazepine use, misuse and intoxication. While violent and aggressive behaviour may be a consequence of such disinhibition, there is limited information available regarding the links between benzodiazepine use and violence.", 
    "187": "This article aims to examine the existing evidence on the relationship between benzodiazepines, violence and aggression.", 
    "188": "While current evidence suggests that benzodiazepines rarely induce violence, it is important to note that the available literature is limited in its scope and that benzodiazepine related violence is often severe and of potential concern to frontline workers. Mediating risk factors for benzodiazepine related violence include concurrent alcohol use, benzodiazepine dose, a history of aggression and underlying impulsivity. Comprehensive assessment and alternate nonpharmacological treatment options should be considered before prescribing benzodiazepines within primary care.", 
    "189": "Pregabalin is gaining popularity in the perioperative period for its usefulness in treating neuropathic pain and its apparent opioid- sparing effect. The present report describes the perioperative course of three patients who received pregabalin and experienced significant respiratory depression in the postoperative period. All three patients consented to the report and publication of the present case series. The first patient was elderly with borderline renal dysfunction. She experienced respiratory arrest in the immediate postoperative period following a craniotomy for tumour excision. The second patient presented with severe respiratory depression 12 h after receiving a spinal anesthetic for joint replacement, and was later found to have clinically significant obstructive sleep apnea. The third patient, who was an otherwise healthy elderly individual on benzodiazepines for anxiety, experienced respiratory arrest in the postanesthesia care unit after an uneventful anesthesia for lumbar spine decompression. All of these patients were treated successfully with standard resuscitation measures. Although other causes of respiratory depression in these patients were considered, there appears to be an association between pregabalin and this complication. The present article briefly reviews the evidence regarding the perioperative use of pregabalin. Based on the authors' experience and the available evidence, they believe that pregabalin may be useful in the management of acute pain in carefully selected patients undergoing certain surgeries. A clinical algorithm has been developed to guide the perioperative use of pregabalin. This algorithm may be helpful in increasing the safety of perioperative pregabalin use.", 
    "190": "2,3-Benzodiazepine derivatives are synthesized as drug candidates for a potential treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases involving the excessive activity of AMPA receptors. Here, we describe a rapid kinetic investigation of the mechanism of inhibition of the GluA2Q(flip) AMPA receptor channel opening by two 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives, i.e. the prototypic 2,3-benzodiazepine compound GYKI 52466 [(1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine)] and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7,8-methylenedioxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one (BDZ-2). GYKI 52466 and BDZ-2 are structurally similar in that the 4-methyl group in the diazepine ring of GYKI 52466 is replaced by a carbonyl group, yielding BDZ-2. Using a laser-pulse photolysis technique with \u223c60 \u03bcs time resolution, we characterize the effect of the two compounds individually on the channel-opening process of the GluA2Q(flip) receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells. We find that BDZ-2 preferentially inhibits the open-channel state, whereas GYKI 52466 is more selective for the closed-channel state of the GluA2Q(flip) receptors. Each inhibitor binds independently to its own noncompetitive site, yet the two sites do not interact allosterically. The significance of these results in the context of both the structure-activity relationship and the properties of the GluA2Q(flip) receptor channels is presented.", 
    "191": "Benzodiazepines belongs to one of the most commonly used anxiolytic and anticonvulsant drugs in the world. Full description of toxic effects on different organs is lacking for nearly all the current benzodiazepines. The aim of the current work was to study the immunologic and vascular changes induced by sub-chronic administration of alprazolam and clonazepam in non-stressed and stressed adult male albino rats. Forty-two adult male albino rats were divided into 6 groups (I): (Ia) Negative control rats, (Ib): Positive control rats received distilled water, (II): Stressed rats, (III): Non-stressed rats received daily oral dose of clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg), (IV): Stressed rats received daily oral dose of clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg), (V): Non-stressed rats received daily oral dose of alprazolam (0.3 mg/kg). (VI): Stressed rats received daily oral dose of alprazolam (0.3 mg/kg). At the end of the 4th week, total leukocyte count (WBCs) and differential count were determined, anti-sheep RBC antibody (Anti-SRBC) titer and interleukin-2 (IL-2) level were assessed, thymus glands, lymph nodes, spleens and abdominal aortae were submitted to histopathological examination. Alprazolam was found to induce a significant increase in neutrophil count and a significant decrease in lymphocytes, anti-SRBC titer and IL-2 level with severe depletion of the splenic, thymal and nodal lymphocytes, accompanied by congestion and eosinophilic vasculitis of all organs tested in comparison to clonazepam treated rats. Stress enhanced the toxic effects. It was concluded that the immune system and blood vessels can be adversely affected to a greater extent by short-term chronic administration of alprazolam than by clonazepam, and these toxic effects are aggravated by stress.", 
    "192": "Aromatic radiofluorination of the diaryliodonium tosylate precursor with [(18)F]fluoride ions has been applied successfully to access [(18)F]flumazenil in high radiochemical yields of 67.2 \u00b1 2.7% (decay corrected). The stability and reactivity of the diaryliodonium tosylate precursor plays a key role in increasing the production of (18)F-labelled molecules under the fluorine-18 labelling condition. Various conditions were explored for the preparation of [(18)F]flumazenil from different diaryliodonium tosylate precursors. Optimum incorporation of [(18)F]fluoride ions in the 4-methylphenyl-mazenil iodonium tosylate precursor (5f) was achieved at 150 \u00b0C for 5 min by utilizing 4 mg of the precursor, K(2.2.2)/K(2)CO(3) complex, and the radical scavenger in N,N-dimethylformamide. This approach was extended to a viable method for use in automated synthesis with a radiochemical yield of 63.5 \u00b1 3.2% (decay corrected, n = 26) within 60.0 \u00b1 1.1 min. [(18)F]Flumazenil was isolated by preparative HPLC after the reaction was conducted under improved conditions and exhibited sufficient specific activity of 370-450 GBq \u03bcmol(-1), with a radiochemical purity of >99%, which will be suitable for human PET studies.", 
    "193": "Functional status is the cornerstone of geriatric care and serves as an indicator of general well-being. A decline in function can increase health care use, worsen quality of life, threaten independence, and increase the risk of mortality. One of several risk factors for decline in functional status is medication use.", 
    "194": "Our aim was to critically review published articles that have examined the relationship between medication use and functional status decline in the elderly.",

Search terms included aged, humans, drug utilization, polypharmacy, inappropriate prescribing, anticholinergics, psychotropics, antihypertensives, drug burden index, functional status, function change or decline, activities of daily living, gait, mobility limitation, and disability. A manual search of the reference lists of the identified articles and the authors' article files, book chapters, and recent reviews was conducted to retrieve additional publications. Only articles that used rigorous observational or interventional designs were included. Cross-sectional studies and case series were excluded from this review.", 
    "196": "Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Five studies addressed the impact of suboptimal prescribing on function, 3 of which found an increased risk of worse function in community-dwelling subjects receiving polypharmacy. Three of the 4 studies that assessed benzodiazepine use and functional status decline found a statistically significant association. One cohort study identified no relationship between antidepressant use and functional status, whereas a randomized trial found that amitriptyline, but not desipramine or paroxetine, impaired certain measures of gait. Two studies found that increasing anticholinergic burden was associated with worse functional status. In a study of hospitalized rehabilitation patients, users of hypnotics/anxiolytics (eg, phenobarbital, zolpidem) had lower relative Functional Independence Measure motor gains than nonusers. Use of multiple central nervous system (CNS) drugs (using different definitions) was linked to greater declines in self-reported mobility and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) scores in 2 community-based studies. Another study of nursing home patients did not report a significant decrease in SPPB scores in those taking multiple CNS drugs. Finally, 2 studies found mixed effects between antihypertensive use and functional status in the elderly.", 
    "197": "Benzodiazepines and anticholinergics have been consistently associated with impairments in functional status in the elderly. The relationships between suboptimal prescribing, antidepressants, and antihypertensives and functional status decline were mixed. Further research using established measures and methods is needed to better describe the impact of medication use on functional status in older adults.", 
    "198": "Poor sleep quality is very common among maintenance hemodialysis patients and has negative impacts on patients' quality of life. Benzodiazepines have traditionally been used in this population; however, they may induce physical dependence and sleep apnea. Nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic medications with less side effects are introduced as alternatives. This study was designed to compare the effect of zolpidem and clonazepam on sleep quality of hemodialysis patients.", 
    "199": "In a randomized crossover study on 23 hemodialysis patients, sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index at baseline, at the initiation of a 1-week washout period after a 2-week treatment with zolpidem (1 mg) and clonazepam (5 mg to 10 mg), and after the second 2 weeks of treatment. Patients who suffer from any concurrent situations that may affect sleep quality or psychiatric disorders and those on medications affecting sleep quality were excluded.", 
    "200": "The prevalence of poor sleep quality was 87.8% of the 88 hemodialysis patients who were initially approached. There was a significant negative correlation between iron deficiency and poor sleep quality. Both clonazepam and zolpidem significantly improved sleep quality; however, clonazepam was more effective in decreasing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores (P = .03). Zolpidem was better tolerated in the hemodialysis patients.", 
    "201": "Clonazepam was more effective than zolpidem in the improvement of sleep quality of hemodialysis patients, while zolpidem was better tolerated in these patients.", 
    "202": "Treatment of acute illness in older adults is frequently complicated by the presence of delirium. Delirium is characterized by the development of an altered mental status over the course of hours to days, and can have a fluctuating course. Patients with delirium have difficulty paying attention to their environment, have disorganized thinking, and usually have an altered level of consciousness. While scientists continue to elucidate the pathophysiologic mechanisms associated with delirium, clinicians can identify patients at risk for delirium and diagnose it using valid instruments, such as the Confusion Assessment Method and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Delirium is an independent risk factor for death, institutionalization, and dementia, and resolves in many patients by the time of hospital discharge. For patients admitted to medical units, optimal management of delirium includes reassessment of medications, pain, sleep, nutrition, mobility, need for physical restraints, and bowel and bladder function. The use of antipsychotic medication to sedate delirious patients should be restricted to patients in danger of harming themselves or others and should be used when nonpharmacologic means fail. Multicomponent interventions performed by the hospital care team that address risk factors can prevent delirium in patients in medical units and those undergoing hip fracture repair. This includes attention to the depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia and the addition of regional nerve blocks to patient-controlled analgesia in orthopedic patients, both of which may reduce postoperative delirium. Perioperative use of antipsychotics may further reduce the incidence of delirium, although hospital length of stay has not been routinely reduced. Appropriate management of analgesia, sedation, and delirium in the intensive care unit is also associated with reduced duration of mechanical ventilation, as well as intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. The use of dexmedetomidine, an \u03b1-adrenergic receptor agonist, for sedation may reduce intensive care unit length of stay when compared with use of benzodiazepines.", 
    "203": "A set of sulfamides designed, synthesized and evaluated against maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and pentilenetetrazol (PTZ) tests with promising results, were tested for their affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptor. The most active compounds, N,N'-dicyclohexylsulfamide (7) and N,N'-diphenethylsulfamide (10), competitively inhibited the binding of [(3)H]-flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine binding site with K(i)\u00b1SEM values of 27.7\u00b14.5\u03bcM (n=3) and 6.0\u00b11.2\u03bcM (n=3), respectively. The behavioral actions of these sulfamides, i.p. administered in mice, were examined in the plus-maze, hole-board and locomotor activity assays. Compound 7 exhibited anxiolytic-like effects in mice evidenced by a significant increase of the parameters measured in the hole-board test (at 1 and 3mg/kg) and the plus-maze assay (at 1 and 3mg/kg). Compound 10 evidenced anxiolytic activity in the plus-maze and the hole-board tests at 1mg/kg. Locomotor activity of mice was not modified by compound 7 or 10 at the doses tested. Flumazenil, a non selective benzodiazepine binding site antagonist, was able to completely reverse the anxiolytic-like effects of these sulfamides, proving that the GABA(A) receptor is implicated in this action. Anxiety represents a major problem for people with epilepsy. The use of anxiolytic and anticonvulsant sulfamides would be beneficial to individuals who suffer from both disorders.", 
    "204": "Based on a pharmacophore model of the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptors, developed with synthetic flavones and potent 3-carbonylquinolin-4-ones, 3-alkyl- and 3-amido-6-methylisothiazoloquinolin-4-ones were designed, prepared and assayed. The suggestion that the interaction between the hydrogen bond donor site H1 with the 3-carbonyl oxygen in 3-carbonylquinolin-4-ones can be replaced by an interaction between H1 and N-2 in the isothiazoloquinolin-4-ones, was confirmed. As with the 3-carbonylquinolin-4-ones, the length of the chain in position 3 is critical for an efficient interaction with the lipophilic pockets of the pharmacophore model. The most potent 3-alkyl derivative, 3-pentyl-6-methylisothiazoloquinolin-4-one, has an affinity (K(i) value) for the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA(A) receptors of 13 nM. However, by replacing the 3-pentyl with a 3-butyramido group an even more potent compound was obtained, with a K(i) value of 2.8 nM, indicating that the amide function facilitates additional interactions with the binding site.",

Concerns about the abuse liability of carisoprodol are increasing, but evidence that carisoprodol produces tolerance and a significant withdrawal syndrome has yet to be established. The purpose of the current study was to determine if repeated administration of carisoprodol produces tolerance and withdrawal signs in a mouse model.", 
    "206": "Carisoprodol (0, 100, 200, 300, or 500 mg/kg bid, i.p.) was administered to Swiss-Webster mice for 4 days and loss-of-righting reflex was measured 20-30 min following each administration. On the fourth day, bemegride (20 mg/kg), flumazenil (20 mg/kg), or vehicle was administered following carisoprodol and withdrawal signs were measured. Separate groups of mice receiving the same treatment regimen and dose range were tested for spontaneous withdrawal at 6, 12 and 24 h after the last dose of carisoprodol.", 
    "207": "The righting reflex was dose-dependently impaired following the first administration of carisoprodol. A 75-100% decrease in the magnitude of the impairment occurred over the four days of exposure, indicating the development of tolerance to the carisoprodol-elicited loss-of-righting reflex. Withdrawal signs were not observed within 24h following spontaneous withdrawal; however, bemegride and flumazenil each precipitated withdrawal within 15-30 min of administration.", 
    "208": "Carisoprodol treatment resulted in tolerance and antagonist-precipitated withdrawal, suggesting it may have an addiction potential similar to that of other long-acting benzodiazepine or barbiturate compounds.", 
    "209": "Impairment of spinal GABAergic inhibition is demonstrated to contribute to pathologic chronic pain states. We investigated spinal and peripheral GABAergic regulation of incisional pain in rats. We found that intrathecal but not peripheral administration of muscimol (GABA-A receptor agonist) and baclofen (GABA-B receptor agonist) reduced mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia after plantar incision in rats. Nonevoked pain behavior after incision was unaffected by these agonists. Similarly, nociception in unincised rats was not reduced by the same dose of agonists. Thus, GABA-A and GABA-B receptors are involved in mediating incision-induced hyperalgesia (but not nonevoked pain). Intrathecal and systemic application of L-838,417, a subtype-selective benzodiazepine site agonist (\u03b12, \u03b13, \u03b15), reduced mechanical and heat hyperalgesia after incision, indicating a role of these subunits in mediating incision-induced hyperalgesia. Interestingly, the effects of all agonists were more intense and prolonged on the day after surgery than on the day of incision. Similarly, spinally administered GABA-A and GABA-B antagonists increased pain behavior, again with a greater effect 1 day after incision. One possible explanation for this finding might be that an incision modulates GABA-mediated inhibition 1 day after incision. However, expression of GABA-A receptor subunits \u03b12 and \u03b13 and GABA-B receptor subunits within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord were unchanged after incision, indicating that receptor expression cannot explain a possible modulation of GABAergic inhibition after incision. Thus, other mechanisms need to be considered. In conclusion, GABA-A and GABA-B receptors are promising targets for postoperative, incisional pain in humans.",

    "227": "2-Methyl-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine, C(17)H(20)N(4)S, commonly known as olanzapine, is a psychotropic agent that belongs to the thienobenzodiazepine class of drugs. A new polymorph form IV was obtained upon attempted cocrystallization with nicotinamide in a 1:1 ratio from an ethyl acetate solution. Two butterfly-like molecules form centrosymmetric dimers stabilized by weak C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 interactions between the 4-methylpiperazin-1-yl fragment and the benzene/thiophene aromatic system. Form IV consists of a herringbone arrangement of dimers, whereas the previously reported form II has parallel dimers. Both crystal structures are sustained by an N-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7N hydrogen bond.", 
    "228": "Quantitative assessment of behavioural patterns is frequently used in rodent toxicity studies, however only limited approaches are available for monkeys. Often qualitative behavioural scoring using functional observation batteries (FOBs) is performed, with difficulties like poor reproducibility or lack of sensitivity. In this study, we investigated whether quantitative behavioural monitoring can be applied to group-housed cynomolgus monkeys. Video-tracking EthoVision\u00ae XT system and special analysis software were used to evaluate diazepam (i.v. 1mg/kg) related behavioural changes in group-housed animals. Recordings were made predose and at the anticipated time of maximum drug exposure (T(max)). General parameters such as distance travelled and velocity did not reveal the known sedative effects of diazepam. However, inspection of the automatically generated track images indicated that diazepam-treated animals had more a meandering movement pattern suggesting that diazepam induced a loss of balance which was regained by corrective movements. Therefore, parameters revealing specific aspects of the meandering movement pattern such as velocity profiles and turn angles have been analyzed and revealed an increase in the curvature and in the number of directional changes of the movement path.",

    "230": "Ten hospitals in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network enlisted patients 3 months to 17 years with convulsive SE (status cohort) or for a traditional pharmacokinetics study (elective cohort). Sparse sampling was used for the status cohort, and intensive sampling was used for the elective cohort. Non-compartmental analyses were performed on the elective cohort, and served to nest compartmental population pharmacokinetics analysis for both cohorts.", 
    "231": "A total of 48 patients in the status cohort and 15 patients in the elective cohort were enrolled. Median age was 7 years, 2 months. The population pharmacokinetics parameters were: clearance, 1.2 mL/min/kg; half-life, 16.8 hours; and volume of distribution, 1.5 L/kg. On the basis of the pharmacokinetics model, a 0.1 mg/kg dose is expected to achieve concentrations of approximately 100 ng/mL and maintain concentrations >30 to 50 ng/mL for 6 to 12 hours. A second dose of 0.05 mg/kg would achieve desired therapeutic serum levels for approximately 12 hours without excessive sedation. Age-dependent dosing is not necessary beyond using a maximum initial dose of 4 mg.",

    "233": "Ammonia is a major player in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and affects astrocyte function by triggering a self-amplifying cycle between osmotic and oxidative stress. We recently demonstrated that hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling rapidly stimulates nitric oxide (NO) production and increases intracellular free Zn(2+) concentration ([Zn(2+)](i)). Here we report effects of ammonia on [Zn(2+)](i) homeostasis and NO synthesis. In cultured rat astrocytes, NH(4)Cl (5 mm) increased within 6 h both cytosolic and mitochondrial [Zn(2+)]. The [Zn(2+)](i) increase was transient and was mimicked by the nonmetabolizable CH(3)NH(3)Cl, and it was dependent on NO formation, as evidenced by the sensitivity toward the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine. The NH(4)Cl-induced NO formation was sensitive to the Ca(2+) chelator 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl) ester and increases in both NO and [Zn(2+)](i) were blocked by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist MK-801. The NH(4)Cl-triggered increase in [Zn(2+)](i) was followed by a Zn(2+)-dependent nuclear appearance of the metal response element-binding transcription factor and metallothionein messenger RNA (mRNA) induction. Metallothionein mRNA was also increased in vivo in rat cerebral cortex 6 h after an NH(4)Ac challenge. NH(4)Cl increased peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) protein expression, whereas PBR mRNA levels were decreased in a Zn(2+)-independent manner. The Zn(2+)-dependent upregulation of metallothionein following ammonia intoxication may reflect a cytoprotective response, whereas the increase in PBR expression may augment HE development.",

Mean age of first exposure was 17.94 (Confidence interval: 17.91-17.97). There was significant difference in the useof tobacco and cannabis amongst final year students than first year students. Male and female differed significantly in use of every substance except for benzodiazepine. Medical college, college and school were place of first exposure in 17.26%, 15.92% and 13.23% of the cases respectively. Family history was associated with substance use in medical students and was statistically significant (P<0.0001).Experimentation was the major reason for the use of most of the substances.",

Following administration of intravenous haloperidol, both patients developed catatonic and extrapyramidal signs. Both patients developed catatonia, rigidity, hyperthermia, leukocytosis, and elevations in creatine kinase. In both cases, the patients met the criteria for catatonia as evidenced by motoric immobility, stupor, mutism, and negativism. The syndrome resolved within a few days of stopping haloperidol and initiation of lorazepam.",

    "241": "This phase II trial was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of TLN-4601 in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) at first progression. TLN-4601 inhibits the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway, and in animal models crosses the blood-brain barrier and accumulates in implanted gliomas, possibly by binding specifically to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. A maximum of 40 patients with recurrent GBM were to be enrolled in this study. TLN-4601 was administered at a dose of 480 mg/m(2)/day by continuous intravenous (CIV) administration. Each 21-day cycle consisted of a 14-day CIV administration and a 7-day recovery period. Samples were obtained from all patients for pharmacokinetic evaluations (PK) and for Raf-1 and pERK biomarker assessment using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. Following enrollment of 20 patients, this study was terminated due to a lack of efficacy. Of 17 evaluable patients, 14 had MR scans performed after two cycles of TLN-4601. Of these 14 patients, three had stable disease and 11 had disease progression. Only three patients had MR scans performed after four cycles and all had evidence of radiographic progression. Serum PKs confirmed that patients were exposed to TLN-4601 at targeted drug levels. TLN-4601 was generally well tolerated although two patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Biomarker analysis did not show consistent changes. TLN-4601 infused via CIV at 480 mg/m(2)/day for 14 of 21 days is well tolerated by patients with progressive GBM. However, this agent is ineffective in progressive GBM when administered as monotherapy in this schedule.",

    "243": "Thirty-five patients were recruited with a diagnosis of temporomandibular disorder based on standard clinical diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorder. The patients were put in to one of the two groups: placebo or diazepam at random. The average pain intensity was recorded with visual analog scale (VAS) at pretreatment, at weekly interval till the completion of a three-week trial and at post-treatment visit on the eighth week from baseline. The secondary outcome measures were changes in masticatory muscle tenderness, viz. massater muscle, lateral pterygoid muscle, medial pterygoid muscle and temporalis muscle and changes in mouth opening.",

The inter-group comparison demonstrated no statistically significant difference between the groups.", 
    "246": "This study suggests that the placebo can give near similar results as diazepam can. So the role of placebo should also be considered as one of the important management strategies. In the short term, reduction in the masticatory muscle tenderness and significant improvement in the mouth opening in both the groups were observed.", 
    "247": "The allosteric effect of fluconazole (effector) on the formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1'-OH-MDZ) and 4-hydroxymidazolam (4-OH-MDZ) from midazolam (MDZ), a substrate of CYP3A4/5--members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes--was examined in healthy volunteers. Following pretreatment with fluconazole, the ratio of the areas under the curve (AUCs) for 4-OH-MDZ and MDZ (AUC(4-OH)/AUC(MDZ)) increased by 35-62%, whereas the ratio AUC(1'-OH)/AUC(MDZ) decreased by 5-37%; the ratio AUC(1'-OH)/AUC(4-OH) decreased by 46-58% after fluconazole administration and had no association with the CYP3A5 genotype. The in vitro formation of 1'-OH-MDZ was more susceptible to inhibition by fluconazole than that of 4-OH-MDZ. Fluconazole decreased the intrinsic formation-clearance ratio of 1'-OH-MDZ/4-OH-MDZ to an extent that was quantitatively comparable to in vivo observations. The elimination clearance of MDZ metabolites appeared unaffected by fluconazole. This study demonstrated that fluconazole alters formation of MDZ metabolites, both in vivo and in vitro, in a manner consistent with an allosteric interaction. The 1'-OH-MDZ/4-OH-MDZ ratio may serve as a biomarker of such interactions among MDZ, CYP3A4/5, and other putative effectors.", 
    "248": "Baclofen is approved for muscle spasms and cerebral spasticity. Several studies have recently investigated the use of baclofen for alcohol withdrawal symptoms and as an abstinence-promoting agent in alcohol-dependent subjects. The evidence is too weak to recommend baclofen for alcohol withdrawal, and drugs with better documentation such as benzodiazepines and carbamazepine should be preferred for this indication. The evidence for the use of baclofen to prevent relapse to drinking in alcohol dependence is somewhat conflicting, but the drug could be considered as a therapeutic option in case of conservative measures and approved drugs such as disulfiram and acamprosate having insufficient effect. Despite enthusiastic appraisal in case reports, the use of baclofen in high doses to suppress alcohol craving cannot be recommended due to insufficient evidence. Trials that may resolve this issue are underway.", 
    "249": "The features of sickle cell disease (SCD) are described. Two case reports of patients treated in a Dental Institute are presented and the dental management of patients with SCD discussed. Since infection is one of the major risk factors for sickle cell crisis, the prevention of oral disease and infection is vital for this group of patients and there is no contra-indication to the delivery of dental treatment under local anaesthetic with inhalational sedation if required in the primary care setting. Since patients with sickle cell disease are particularly vulnerable to the effects of periods of hypoxia, which may produce significant morbidity, and because of the additional practical challenges in sedating this group of patients, intravenous sedation should be undertaken in a specialist unit.",

    "253": "The onset of sedation was rapid with K as compared to M and MK. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01) between K and M. The overall success rate was 89% with K, MK was 84% and 69% with M. The difference between the overall success rates of K and M was statistically significant (P < 0.01).
