    "0": "1 The methodology of clinical trails of anxiolytic drugs carried out in general practice conditions is discussed. Particular problems include: the selection of suitable patients; placebo effects; the influence of non-specific variables such as life-events; and patient compliance. 2 Clobazam, a novel 1,5 benzodiazepine, and diazepam were compared with placebo in a double-blind group comparative trial in general practice, which was designed to avoid as many confounding variables as possible. Anxiety-reducing effects were evaluated and at the same time the effects of the drugs on psychomotor performance were examined. 3 Both clobazam and diazepam produced significant improvements in anxiety ratings on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the Morbid Anxiety Inventory, whereas placebo did not. 4 The placebo group demonstrated a significant improvement in performance on a pursuit rotor and digit symbol substitution test (DSST), whereas the diazepam group's performance did not change. The clobazam group showed improvement in both tests, significantly so in the DSST. This suggests that diazepam produces impairment in performance, which had negated the practice effects seen in the placebo group, whereas clobazam did not seem to produce similar impairment.", 
    "1": "1 The results so far published in the literature, together with our own results, show that in clobazam (Frisium) we have a daytime tranquilizer which is comparable to the newest benzodiazepine derivatives. 2 It is particularly indicated in disorders of the sleeping-waking rhythm, and sometimes also in psychovegetative disorders associated with epilepsy. 3. Its tranquillizing profile of action, the low incidence of side-effects and the absence of interactions with other drugs mean that its applications are varied, not only in neuropsychiatry but also in other medical disciplines. 4 The fact that therapeutic doses do not seem to impair driving ability to render patients incapable of carrying on their profession, means that it is suitable for the treatment of outpatients.", 
    "2": "Sedative drugs are intended to cause various degrees of drowsiness. Animal experiments indicate that barbiturates induce these effects primarily by depression of the reticular activating system in the rostral brainstem. This in turn potentiates the thalamic recruiting system, thereby inducing 'barbiturate bursts' in the EEG. Anxiolytic drugs are intended to reduce anxiety or tension at doses which do not cause sedation or sleep. Propanediols may depress deactivating centers in the caudal brainstem, thereby releasing the activating centers in the rostral brainstem and depressing the thalamic recruiting response. These drugs may also act on the amygdala. Benzodiazepines have depressant effects on the amydala or hippocampus. These effects may release the reticular formation from inhibition. Enhanced activity of the activating and deactivating centers, to a different extent in different animals, would produce restlessness in some animals and sedation in others, accompanied by a mixture of fast and slow waves in the EEG. Sedative and anxiolytic agents also have central relaxant effects. The barbiturates act directly on the spinal cord, depressing both monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes. Propanediols and benzodiazepines act primarily on the descending facilitatory influence of the brainstem. Reduction of this influence depresses spinal polysynaptic but not monosynaptic reflexes. Biochemical studies suggest that barbiturates may act by antagonizing synaptic excitation induced by glutamate. Benzodiazepines may act by enhancing presynaptic inhibition mediated by GABA. The mechanism of action of propanediols is unknown.", 
    "3": "Midazolam is a short-acting water soluble benzodiazepine derivative. It is a hypnotic used for intravenous anaesthesia induction. The present investigation was designed in a prospective double-blind fashion to compare midazolam with thiopentone as hypnotic components in balanced anaesthesia. The study included 50 healthy patients undergoing relatively short surgical procedures. The results revealed that thiopentone is faster in onset than midazolam for induction of anaesthesia, with less variation of dose response. However, maintenance of anaesthesia was superior with midazolam, requiring fewer supplemental anaesthetic drugs, having better patient acceptance and providing more amnesia. Postoperative complications were very low with both techniques. Midazolam was surprisingly similar to thiopentone in most parameters including emergence time from anaesthesia. Midazolam is a new drug with potential both for induction of anaesthesia and maintenance of balanced anaesthesia.", 
    "4": "Analysis of sleep effects of flurazepam hydrochloride on four normal subjects confirmed that this drug substantially suppresses both REM and stage 4 sleep. Computer analysis disclosed that delta wave amplitude was greatly reduced by flurazepam. However, low density delta wave activity (ie, stage 2 sleep, which was increased in duration beyond the reduction in stage 4), permitted the number of delta waves and the time they occupied per night to remain at baseline levels. This finding suggests that sedative-hypnotics increase total sleep time by slowing the metabolic processes of sleep so that a longer sleep duration is required for the same biological effects. New observations on the induction times of REM and stage 4 effects are also presented. In general, the distortions in sleep EEG produced by flurazepam qualitatively resemble, but are quantitatively greater than, those produced by barbiturates in equivalent hypnotic doses.", 
    "5": "We describe a rapid and sensitive radioreceptor assay for measuring benzodiazepines in plasma. This method is based on the competition between tritiated diazepam and pharmacologically active benzodiazepines present in plasma, for binding sites on rat brain synaptosomal membranes. No interference is obtained with drug-free plasma or plasma samples containing high concentrations of other commonly used drugs. High correlations (r = 0.98; P less than .001) were obtained between the \"diazepam equivalents\" measured in plasma with the radioreceptor assay and the levels of diazepam and nordiazepam obtained by gas-liquid chromatography. The radioreceptor assay is rapid, sensitive, specific, and requires no sophisticated equipment or methods. It should therefore prove useful in monitoring blood benzodiazepine levels for both therapeutic and toxicologic purposes.", 
    "6": "Lormetazepam (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 mg)--a new benzodiazepine--was tested versus Pentobarbital (100 mg) under double blind conditions on 240 preoperative inpatients for night-time sedative and side effects after acute oral intake. Results are based on p less than 0.05. Additionally p less than 0.125 in binomial-two-sample-tests was accepted. Lormetazepam shows dose dependent increase in hypnotic effects (e.g. reduction in sleep latency and number of awakenings, increase of total sleep duration), and side effects (e.g. dopiness, dizziness), but no relevant change in vital signs. About 0.5 mg of Lormetazepam are equivalent to 100 mg of Pentobarbital. 2 mg of Lormetazepam seem to be the optimum dose regarding the relation between hypnotic and side effects. In the view of anaesthesists Lormetazepam is preferable to Pentobarbital because of more favorable safety aspects.", 
    "7": "Investigations carried out in volunteers showed that when compared with physiological saline the solubilizer of diazepam caused hyperventilation. Among the constituents of the solubilizer propylene glycol and ethyl alcohol have to be excluded, likely benzyl alcohol was due to the respiratory response. Benzyl alcohol has local anesthetic properties and its action on respiration has never been examined up to now. Therefore a further study was performed to compare ampoule solutions of diazepam with or without benzyl alcohol in the solubilizer used. The solutions were given intravenously, the dose of diazepam was 0.35 mg/kg, that of benzyl alcohol 1.1 mg/kg respectively. The measurements showed that solutions containing benzyl alcohol produced a statistical significant increase of respiratory rate and of minute volume. In case of intravenous administration of Valium using ampoule solutions diazepam and in addition a second active substance are applicated. The latter defined as benzyl alcohol has stimulating effects on respiration.", 
    "8": "The effects of representative antipsychotic and antianxiety drugs on the abstinence syndrome in morphine-dependent rats were compared. Groups of 10 to 22 male albino Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were individually implanted s.c. with either two 75-mg morphine base pellets or two placebo pellets. After 72 hr, chlorpromazine (CPZ 1,2 and 4 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), thioridazine (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (2,4 and 8 mg/kg), diazepam (DPM, 1, 2 and 4 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected s.c. 55 min before precipitation of abstinence with naloxone (1 mg/kg s.c.). Jumping was exacerbated by CPZ (4 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (4 and 8 mg/kg) and DPM (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg); haloperidol and thioridazine had no significant effect on this sign. Weight less over 1 hr was decreased by CPZ (4 mg/kg) and DPM (4 mg/kg). Wet-dog shakes were decreased by all doses of haloperidol but increased by chlordiazepoxide (8 mg/kg) and DPM (1, 2 and 4 mg/kg). CPZ (2 and 4 mg/kg) significantly increased the incidence of teeth chattering. Other abstinence signs were not affected in a dose-related manner. Although the antipsychotic agents each decrease dopamine availability at the postsynaptic receptor, this mechanism alone cannot explain their actions on individual signs of abstinence. Perhaps it is therefore time to question how modifying agents can be meaningfully compared in morphine-abstinent rats.", 
    "9": "The effect of daily, oral administration of diazepam on plasma corticosterone responses to stressors of varying intensity was investigated. In rats exposed to the mild stress of noise, diazepam, 10 mg kg-1 but not 1.0 or 0.1 mg kg-1, reduced plasma corticosterone concentrations by 30% in comparison with controls. However, in rats exposed to the more severe stressors, foot-shock or immobilization, none of these doses of diazepam reduced plasma corticosterone responses. In unstressed rats, diazepam 10 mg kg-1 raised plasma corticosterone concentrations. It is suggested that plasma corticosterone concentrations are not a reliable indicator of the tranquillizing effect of diazepam during stress.", 
    "10": "Intranigral injection of muscimol induced hyperactivity in rats and antagonized haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Intranigral injection of gabaculine, an inhibitor of GABA transaminase, induced similar effects 5h after injection, when the nigral GABA content was increased 7-fold. On the other hand, injections of muscimol (30 ng) into the globus pallidus potentiated the cataleptic effect of haloperidol, and muscimol alone in high doses (100 and 200 ng) induced catalepsy. Gabaculine also induced catalepsy of medium intensity and potentiated the effect of haloperidol 24h after injection, when GABA was increased in the globus pallidus as well as in the substantia nigra. Injections of muscimol into either the globus pallidus or substantia nigra increased striatal HVA and enhanced haloperidol-induced elevation of HVA. Three benzodiazepines, nitrazepam, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide administered orally, potentiated the effect of muscimol (30 ng) injected into the globus pallidus and induced catalepsy. A similar effect was not obtained with phenobarbital. It is suggested that stimulation of GABA receptor or increase of GABA content in the sustantia nigra antagonize haloperidol-induced catalepsy by activation of nigral dopaminergic system, and that enhancement of pallidal GABA function induces catalepsy by non-dopaminergic mechanisms. Potentiation of haloperidol-induced catalepsy by benzodiazepines may be due to enhancement of GABA-ergic transmission within the globus pallidus.", 
    "11": "In an unrandomised uncontrolled study on boats and trains, capsules of flurazepam (30 mg) and temazepam (20 mg), when chewed, but not when swallowed whole (even with the ends pricked), gave a better night's sleep than 'Mandrax' (methaqualone 250 mg/diphenhydramine 50 mg) and a better night's sleep than nitrazepam 7.5 mg.", 
    "12": "The effects of single oral doses of terfenadine, diphenhydramine and placebo, alone or in combination with diazepam or alcohol, on psychomotor performance and subjective feelings were evaluated in a double-blind, crossover study in 20 normal male volunteers. Terfenadine 60, 120 and 240 mg had no effect on psychomotor skills and subjective feelings, whereas diphenhydramine 100 mg slightly impaired certain features of psychomotor performance and severely worsened subjective feelings. Terfenadine 120 mg did not influence the adverse effects of oral diazepam 10 mg or of alcohol 0.75 g/kg on psychomotor performance and subjective feelings. In contrast, diphenhydramine 100 mg significantly enhanced these effects of diazepam and alcohol.", 
    "13": "We present a preliminary report of an anaesthetic technique for abdominal surgery involving a combination of flunitrazepam induction and continuous ketamine maintenance of anaesthesia, specifically avoiding the use of any inhalational agents. Standard techniques of muscle relaxation, intubation and ventilation with oxygen-enriched air were employed.", 
    "14": "In rats working in a behavioural schedule of differential reinforcement of low rates (6 or 10 sec), picrotoxin (1 mg kg-1) decreased the number of premature responses and increased (in DRL 10 sec only) the number of rewarded responses. The effect of picrotoxin was antagonized by diazepam (2 mg kg-1). In contrast to picrotoxin, strychnine (1.5 mg kg-1) increased the number of premature responses.", 
    "15": "The relative degrees to which aversive oral (presumably gustatory) and postingestional variables attenuate the voluntary drinking of morphine, methamphetamine, and chlordiazepoxide solutions by rats were assessed by comparing immediate acceptability with subsequent acceptability. Results indicated that morphine solutions (0.01--0.05%) are avoided primarily because of unpalatability, while methamphetamine (0.005--0.02%) and chlordiazepoxide solutions (0.02--0.08%) are avoided primarily because of aversive postingestional effects.", 
    "16": "Our previously published gas chromatography chemical ionization mass spectrometry stable isotope dilution assay for clonazepam and its 7-amino metabolite in plasma has been modified to obtain more consistent recoveries of the amine metabolite and to permit the determination of the 7-acetamido metabolite of clonazepam. In addition, the manuscript describes the details of a method for a least squares analysis of the nonlinear standard curves associated with the use of certain stable isotope labeled analogs as internal standard.", 
    "17": "Although acute alcohol intoxication can cause death, hepatic metabolism of ethanol is usually rapid, and in most cases general supportive care of the intoxicated patient is all that is required. Abrupt cessation of prolonged excessive alcohol intake gives rise to the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The fundamentals of treatment are careful assessment of the patient and judicious use of a benzodiazepine.", 
    "18": "Measurements of platelet count and platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate and epinephrine were made before and after administration of preanesthetic medications and at intervals during induction of anesthesia, before and after thoractomy, and before and after systemic heparinization in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass operations. Substantial decreases in circulating platelet count occurred only after induction of anesthesia and following thoracotomy. There was no notable change in the percent of platelets involved in aggregation over the period studied, but the reactivity of platelets was increased after induction of anesthesia and after thoracotomy.", 
    "19": "The efficacy of electroimpulsive therapy with low energy discharges (up to 50 joules) in various paroxysmal arrhythmias was studied. A mild tranquilizer, seduxen (diazenam), was used as the anesthetic. Electroimpulsive therapy with low-energy discharges was found to produce a high effect in ventricular tachycardia and atrial flutter but a poor restorative effect in atrial fibrillation. The possibility of successful anesthesia with seduxen in electrical cardioversion of paroxysmal disorders of cardiac rhythm is concretized.", 
    "20": "Evidence is presented suggesting that potent water-insoluble antipentylenetetrazol agents triturated in porcelain mortars and pestles are not removed from this mixing device by the usual laboratory washing procedure. Moreover, amounts sufficient to contaminate the next substance triturated in this vessel can be demonstrated by the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold test. The data show that a rigorous washing routine must be followed to achieve a \"clean\" mortar and pestle. Attention is also directed to the importance of using disposable hypodermic syringes, test tubes, etc., whenever possible and of designing an internal control test to determine when implements that must be reused are \"clean.\"", 
    "21": "A double-blind randomized multicenter parallel group comparison of prazepam in divided doses vs. placebo was conducted by 15 investigators among 847 patients presenting with anxiety alone or concurrent with other medical illnesses. Study groups were well matched for age, sex and level of pre-treatment symptomatology. Efficacy evaluation by a physician questionnaire included serial assessment of global improvement plus 10 target signs/symptoms during the 2 to 4 weeks of treatment. Prazepam was statistically significantly superior to placebo as shown on final on-treatment scores for global improvement ratio and for the target symptoms of anxiety, tension, irritability/hostility, depressive mood, insomnia and somatization.", 
    "22": "Conray (meglumine iothalamate), the contrast media frequently used in shuntograms for diagnosing malfunctioning ventriculo-peritoneal shunts, will occasionally cause severe muscular spasms and seizures. In this article, the authors describe anesthetic and critical care management of a case with this complication.", 
    "23": "The absorption of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam after administration of diazepam solution for parenteral injection per rectum and intramuscularly was studied in 9 children (ages 3--12 years). Rectal administration of diazepam 1 mg/kg led to rapid absorption with plasma levels of 270--320 ng/ml within 5 min, and peak levels of 600--1300 ng/ml 10--60 min after administration. The absorption was comparable to that after intramuscular administration. A second peak in plasma diazepam concentration 6--12 h after dosing was observed in 6 children, which may have been due to mobilization of diazepam from the gastrointestinal mucosa produced by feeding 4 h after administration of the drug. A slowly increasing plasma level of N-desmethyldiazepam was observed during the first 24 h after administration of diazepam.", 
    "24": "Increased urinary excretion of indican was detected in earlier studies of patients with the form of progressive myoclonus epilepsy (PME) where no Lafora bodies are present in the brain and other tissues. Since then, all PME patients have been given sodium valproate and/or clonazepam. In a series of 10 patients now examined the mean excretion was on the same level as that of other epileptic and non-epileptic neurological patients (53 +/- 27 mg/g creatinine). Alternate reduction of the two drugs in one patient over a period of 24 days increased the excretion up to the high level measured earlier (96 mg/g creatinine) and caused marked worsening of the clinical condition while no remarkable changes were observed in another PME patient who received her normal medication. The highest values ever measured were found in one PME patient just before his death. In two patients who had no medication the excretion was also high but returned to the normal level during medication with sodium valproate. It is unknown at the moment whether this change is due to the improved clinical condition of the patients or to the compound itself.", 
    "25": "The authors offer a critical review of eight cases of hemorrhagic colorectitis and Crohn's disease (regional ileitis) managed with medical treatments, and eleven like cases treated surgically, during the last ten years. After a discussion of the resources and limitations of medical therapy, the authors describe the various surgical strategies adopted in their cases; they define the possibility of obtaining final cures in Crohn's disease with extended ileocolectomy; and concerning ulcerative forms, they point out the greater efficacy of surgical procedures involving sacrifice of the rectum compared to those in which the terminal segment of the gut is used immediately or later for restoring continuity of the intestinal canal.", 
    "26": "Bronchoscopy was undertaken in 79 outpatients using local anaesthesia plus an i.v. injection of flunitrazepam 0.01 mg kg-1. The co-operation of the patients and the ease of bronchoscopy were good regardless of the age of the patient. There was an increase in amnesia for the bronchoscopy with increasing age, but the most distinct difference between different age groups was that the amnesic action of flunitrazepam was evident earlier and persisted longer in patients of more than 60 yr. Eye co-ordination and ability to stand steadily and walk on a line returned to normal more slowly in patients more than 60 than in those less than 60 yr, but no differences in recovery were noted between patients less than 40 and those of 40--59 yr, or between those 60--69 and those more than 70 yr.", 
    "27": "The in vitro and in vivo ability of benzodiazepines to inhibit specific 3H-diazepam binding correlated with their ability to increase punished responding in a conflict situation. Conflict and foot shock, the punishing stimulus used in most conflict procedures, also altered 3H-diazepam binding. These data implicate 3H-diazepam binding sites in mediating at least some of the anxiolytic properties of benzodiazepines and suggest the existence of some endogenous substance which might be involved in the etiology of anxiety.", 
    "28": "SQ 65,396, a clinically active anti-anxiety agent, enhanced the binding of 3H-diazepam at 1.5 nM. This effect was due to an increase in the affinity for the ligand, without a change in the number of 3H-diazepam binding sites. This action of SQ 65,396 may mediate its anti-anxiety effects by affecting the action of an endogenous modulator of the \"benzodiazepine receptor.\" Several other substances and treatments increase the affinity of 3H-diazepam for its receptors by mechanisms which may be related to the effect produced by SQ 65,396.", 
    "29": "In a double-blind study the influence of Pirenzepin on ulcer healing was studied in 28 in-patients with gastric ulcer under endoscopic control. The ulcer size was reduced by Pirenzepin significantly quicker, and the number of ulcers healed after three weeks treatment with Pirenzepin was significantly higher than under placebo. As to accompanying symptoms appetite stimulation was significantly more frequent with Pirenzepin compared to placebo. No patient complained of dryness of the mouth.", 
    "30": "Fractions of porcine cerebral cortex extract separated by molecular weight on a Sephadex G-75 column were tested for their activities and potencies to inhibit [3H]benzodiazepine binding to rat brain homogenates. The fractions spanned molecular weights from 500 to 100,000. A potent inhibitor (benzodiazepine-competitive factor I, BCF-I) was discovered in the fraction containing substances with molecular weights from 40,000 to 70,000. Equilibrium binding studies indicated that BCF-I was a competitive inhibitor, making it a candidate as a benzodiazepine endogenous factor or profactor. BCF-I was heat stable, but trypsin digestion destroyed its activity. Another inhibitory fraction (BCF-II) was 1/5th as active as BCF-I and contained substances with molecular weights from 1000 to 2000.", 
    "31": "A simple, one-step chemical oxidation of triazolam (7) to its 4-hydroxy analogue, 7a, has been developed and applied to other triazolo- and imidazobenzodiazepines. The reaction may be used to convert diazepam to temazepam. 4-Hydroxytriazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepines have low central nervous system sedative and anticonvulsant activity in sharp contrast to metabolites of diazepam which remain active. While 10, an alpha-hydroxy metabolite of triazolam, retains much of the activity of 7, 10a, and alpha,4-dihydroxy metabolite of triazolam, is 250 times less potent than 7 on the nicotine-antagonism assay and over 300 times less potent on the traction assay.", 
    "32": "Polarographic investigation of clorazepate monopotassium and dipotassium showed two cathodic waves at about -1.28 and -1.66 v. The cathodic wave associated with clorazepate monopotassium or dipotassium at about -1.66 v was a pH-independent, diffusion-controlled wave. This wave was used to develop a specific stability-indicating procedure for clorazepate monopotassium and dipotassium in the presence of their degradation products, namely, nordiazepam, 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, and glycine. The method involves a 10(-2) M LiOH-10(-1) M LiCl extraction of the active ingredient from the formulation, filtration, dilution with the same supporting electrolyte, and then use of the standard addition technique for drug quantitation in capsules. Typical fomulation excipients did not interfere with the analysis. Accuracy and precision of the procedure were 99.55 +/- 0.68%.", 
    "33": "The properties of six adsorbents for Haemoperfusion were investigated in vitro: Amberlite XAD-2; Amberlite XAD-4; Haemocol; collodion coated charcoal; albumine-collodion encapsulated charcoal and activated carbon fibers. Carbromal and diazepam are most quickly removed from aqueous solutions by Amberlite XAD-2 and XAD-4. Of the charcoal containing materials, Haemocol eliminates most rapidly carbromal and diazepam; while activated carbon fibers remove phenobarbital faster. When heparinized blood is perfused, a remarkable reduction in platelet count is observed. The drop is most pronounced with Amberlite XAD-2 and XAD-4, but even when using charcoal preparations the platelet depletion can reach 10% of the original number over 5 hours. Haemolysis is most pronounced with Amberlite XAD-2, XAD-4 and Haemocol. As the efficiency of the adsorbents towards the various drugs differ and as their adverse effects also vary, the decision for a particular material will have to be made according to the individual case.", 
    "34": "Seizures induced in the rat by electroshock or by injections of pentylenetetrazol increase the specific binding of diazepam to putative receptor sites in cerebral cortical membranes. The enhancement of diazepam binding results from a rapid increase in the number of available binding sites rather than a change in receptor affinity. The postictal increase in cortical benzodiazepine receptors suggests that the cerebral cortex might be more sensitive to the anticonvulsant effects of the benzodiazepines after seizures. This observation may be related to the mechanism of action of these drugs in the treatment of recurrent seizures such as status epilepticus.", 
    "35": "Two procedures for the detection of ethchlorvynol are presented. Procedure I involves the use of SA-2-cation-exchange resin loaded paper. The use of multiple ion-exchange resin papers is proposed in a sequence that enables the detection of amphetamines, barbiturates, phenothiazines, propoxyphene (Darvon), phencyclidine, cocaine (benzoyl ecgonine), pentazocine (Talwin) and benzodiazepines in addition to ethchlorvynol. This procedure discusses the details of detecting ethchlorvynol in combination with the entire array of drugs of abuse depending on the needs of a clinical program. Procedure II involves the principle of liquid-liquid extraction using either raw or spent urines.", 
    "36": "To find out about the medical and parental management of children having their first febrile convulsion a hospital-based questionnaire study was carried out in which parents were asked what they did at the time. Fifty-four out of 89 parents brought their child directly to hospital while the remainder attempted to contact their general practitioner, usually successfully, and were then referred to hospital. Whichever course of action the parents chose the outcome was satisfactory. Eighty-seven per cent of convulsions lasted for less than 15 minutes and in only two instances did they last longer than 30 minutes. One child who had convulsions for an hour was given intramuscular phenobarbitone at home without success, and the fit was finally terminated with intravenous diazepam. Parental management of the fit was often widly inappropriate. Only a few parents laid the child on his side and waited for the fit to stop. The parents were bewildered and frightened--30% thought their child was dying or dead. Education of patents of young children is needed. Simply written instructions on how to reduce the temperature of a febrile child and manage a convulsion might help.", 
    "37": "Behavioral effects of Flutazolam (MS-4101), a new derivative of benzodiazepines, was investigated and compared with effects of diazepam in mice and rats. MS-4101 suppressed hyperemotionality in septal rats, fighting behavior in long-term isolated mice and pentylenetetrazol convulsion and potentiated thiopental sleep. These effects of MS-4101 were the same in potency as those of diazepam. MS-4101 was more potent than diazepam in reducing the spontaneous locomotor activity in the open-field test and potentiating the stimulant effect of methamphetamine on locomotor activity. On the other hand, suppression of hyperemotionality in O. B. rats, potentiation of ethanol-induced anesthesia, prevention of maximal electroshock, prevention of strychnine convulsin and muscle relaxant effect of MS-4101 were less potent than in the case of diazepam. MS-4101 had also an anticonflict effect, which was less potent than that seen with diazepam. Suppression of locomotor activity was potentiated by chronic administration of MS-4101, but disappeared with chronic administration of diazepam. MS-4101 inhibited considerably both scratching and head-twitch induced by mescaline in mice. Scratching was increased with small doses of diazepam and decreased with high doses. Head-twitch was decreased with small doses of diazepam and increased with high doses.", 
    "38": "Five anesthetic agents (C1744, etorphine, fentanyl, ketamine hydrochloride, and halothane) were tested to establish the dosage of a safe, effective, short-acting anesthetic for use in the sea otter. Etorphine, at a dosage of 0.75 mg per adult otter and used in conjunction with diazepam, at a dosage of 1.25 mg per adult otter, met most of the requirements for use under field conditions. Halothane, administered through an anesthetic machine, proved to be effective for use in a veterinary hospital."
