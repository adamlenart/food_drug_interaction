    "0": "The assay methods used to determine the concentrations of the newer benzodiazepines include electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography, high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, radioassay and radioreceptor assay. The method used frequently is the highly sensitive and specific electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography. Other methods are associated with limitations. The triazolo- and imidazolebenzodiazepines differ structurally from the 'classical' benzodiazepines such as diazepam, and offer distinct differences in pharmacological activity and in time-course of effect. Alprazolam and triazolam, both 1,4-triazolobenzodiazepines, have high affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor as do midazolam and loprazolam, which are 1,4-imidazolebenzodiazepines. Absorption is characteristically rapid, with peak alprazolam and triazolam concentrations occurring within 1 hour after oral administration. Sublingual administration results in peak alprazolam and triazolam concentrations that are higher and occur earlier than with the oral route. The volume of distribution of alprazolam and triazolam is approximately 1L. Alprazolam is 70% bound to plasma proteins and the extent of binding is independent of concentration. Similarly, triazolam is approximately 85% bound to plasma proteins, variability in binding being explained by variations in alpha 1-acid glycoprotein concentration. The 1,4-triazolo ring prevents the oxidative metabolism of the classical benzodiazepines which results in formation of active metabolites with long elimination half-lives. Alprazolam is extensively metabolised: 29 metabolites have been identified in the urine, and its major metabolite, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, has pharmacological activity. alpha-Hydroxyalprazolam and 4-hydroxyalprazolam are detectable in plasma in amounts which account for less than 10% of the administered dose. Mean alprazolam elimination half-life in healthy adult subjects ranges from 9.5 to 12 hours; liver disease prolongs alprazolam elimination, but renal insufficiency does not. Triazolam also undergoes oxidation and subsequent glucuronidation. alpha-Hydroxytriazolam is the major metabolite, in addition to which 4-hydroxyalprazolam and alpha-4-hydroxytriazolam have been identified in plasma and urine. The elimination half-life of triazolam ranges between 1.8 and 5.9 hours, while that of the conjugated metabolites is short, approximately 3.8 hours. Accumulation of triazolam or its metabolites after multiple doses does not occur. Liver disease prolongs triazolam elimination from the body, but renal disease does not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) exposed to 1 or 10 mg/l chlordiazepoxide showed normal alarm behavior during the presentation of alarm pheromone. Fish exposed to 20 mg/l drug, however, showed little or no behavioral alarm and did not appear sedated. A food extract stimulus presented after alarm pheromone led to a large foraging response by fish exposed to 20 mg/l chlordiazepoxide. Control fish or fish exposed to 1 to 10 mg/l drug showed less tendency to begin foraging. Exposure to 1, 10, or 20 mg/l chlordiazepoxide for 3 hr did not affect whole-brain concentrations of tryptophan, 5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, tyrosine, or dopamine. The binding of [3H]diazepam to specific brain receptor sites (KD = 10 nM, estimated Bmax = 3.3 fmol/mg wet weight) could be displaced by chlordiazepoxide (IC50 = 1.6 microM). These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors in the central nervous system of lower vertebrates may function in ways similar to those in mammals, i.e., in the modulation of behavior in anxiety-like states.", 
    "2": "The effects of kappa-opioid receptor agonists, bremazocine, U-50, 488H and tifluadom and of a mu-opioid receptor agonist, morphine, on food intake and urinary output in food-deprived and nondeprived Sprague-Dawley rats was determined. In food-deprived animals, intraperitoneal administration of bremazocine at 0.1 mg/kg increased food intake but at 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg doses decreased it. Tifluadom (0.1-10.0 mg/kg) had no effect on food intake. U-50,488H at 1.0 mg/kg increased food intake, whereas 10.0 mg/kg dose decreased the food consumption. In nondeprived rats, the kappa-opioid receptor agonists failed to produce any effect on food consumption. In food-deprived rats, all the three kappa-opioid receptor agonists increased the urinary output at the highest dose (10 mg/kg). In nondeprived rats similar effects as in food-deprived rats were observed except bremazocine increased urinary output at all the doses used. These results with kappa-opioid agonists may be related to either the existence of more than one population of kappa-opioid receptors or their differential actions at the opioid receptor types.", 
    "3": "Some 2,6,8-trisubstituted dipyrazolo[5,4-b:3',4'-d]pyridin-3-ones related to the CGS series were synthesized and tested for their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam binding from bovine brain membranes. However the affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor of the tested compounds was lower than that of the CGS series, although it was comparable to that of chlordiazepoxide. It follows that some structure-activity relationships on the tested compounds can be drawn.", 
    "4": "The present paper investigated the differential effects of 5 mg, 60 mg and 120 mg of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788 on the ability to resist sleep of sleepy and alert subjects. Repeated administrations of 5 mg potentiated the hypnotic effects of sleep-deprivation in alert subjects and decreased the hypnotic effects in sleepy subjects. Similar differential effects were found with respect to two factors of subjective mood. The two higher levels of the drug decreased sleepiness more in sleepy than in alert subjects. These results are interpreted to support the hypothesis that the effects of RO 15-1788 may be dependent on the level of an endogenous benzodiazepine-like sleep factor.", 
    "5": "1. Spin-trapping techniques have been used to examine the metabolism of three xenobiotics known to produce free radicals during their metabolism. Reaction with oxygen generated superoxide, the location of which was dependent upon the xenobiotic. 2. Paraquat was metabolized by dog trachea epithelial cells under anaerobiosis to the paraquat free radical, some of which diffused into the extracellular milieu. With the addition of oxygen, superoxide was spin-trapped both intra- and extracellularly. 3. When menadione was metabolized by epithelial cells, superoxide was spin-trapped within the cell and in the surrounding media. However, in this case, extracellular superoxide arose as the result of the disproportionation reaction of menadione and menadiol, resulting from DT-diaphorase reduction of menadione followed by diffusion into extracellular space, to give the menadione semiquinone. Reduction of oxygen resulted in formation of superoxide. 4. For nitrazepam, only intracellular superoxide was generated, resulting from the one-electron reduction of this drug to its corresponding nitro anion free radical. Reaction with oxygen produced superoxide.", 
    "6": "We studied the effect of bleed rate on survival time and hemodynamics in a continuous hemorrhage model of fatal hemorrhagic shock in lightly anesthetized swine. Fasted immature swine (12-16 kg) were sedated with intramuscular (i.m.) ketamine, endotracheally intubated, anesthetized with halothane (0.75%), nitrous oxide, and oxygen, and then prepared for experimentation by placement of a pulmonary artery thermodilution catheter, femoral arterial and venous catheters, and by splenectomy. After instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and sedation was maintained with nitrous oxide and intravenous lorazepam. Thirty minutes later, the animals were bled continuously at 1.0 ml/kg per min (n = 8, Group I) or 1.25 ml/kg per min (n = 8, Group II) by a roller pump connected to the femoral arterial catheter. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded every 15 min until death occurred. Mean survival time was 50.2 +/- 3.0 min in Group I and 39.8 +/- 3.2 min in Group II (P less than 0.001). There was a stepwise decrease in blood pressure and cardiac index consistent with progressive hemorrhagic shock. This model results in reproducible survival times with small standard deviations. Although the animals are lightly anesthetized and the experiments are performed acutely, the hemodynamic responses and survival times observed are similar to those reported in previous studies of chronically instrumented, unanesthetized swine. This model may be more practical than unanesthetized, chronically instrumented swine models for evaluating the effects of various interventions on survival time and hemodynamics in acute hemorrhagic shock.", 
    "7": "Some 1,5-diaryl-3-methyl-1H-pyrazolo[4,5-c]isoquinolines were synthesized and tested for their ability to displace [3H]clonazepam or [3H]Ro 5-4864 from their specific binding on the central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. None of the tested compounds showed any activity as central binding inhibitors, while most of them were specific as peripheral binding inhibitors, although they were not very potent.", 
    "8": "It is currently controversial whether all the brain damage in alcohol abusers in the result of thiamine deficiency (Wernicke-Korsakoff's disease) or whether, in addition, alcohol abuse may affect the brain by other mechanisms as well. The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol abuse affects muscarinic cholinergic and benzodiazepine receptors in histologically normal brains obtained at autopsy in a general hospital population. Patients were excluded from this study if they had clinical brain diseases (including Wernicke's disease), died in coma, or had liver disease, significant brain atrophy, or dementia severe enough to require institutionalization. We found that muscarinic cholinergic synaptic receptor density determined with [3H] quinuclidinly benzilate was decreased by 40% in homogenates of the tempeoral cortex of 26 alcohol abusers compared with 26 matched nonalcoholic controls. The affinities of the muscarinic receptors were not significantly different between the two groups. In contrast, receptor densities and affinities of benzodiazepine receptors determined with [3H]flunitrazepam were not significantly different in the two groups. Age and death-autopsy time interval had no significant effects on either wet tissue protein concentrations, yields of protein after centrifugation, or receptor binding. The contributions of age and time interval were each less than 2% of the total variance of protein concentrations and receptor binding. When patients were excluded or included who had received cholinergic, anticholinergic, or benzodiazepine medications before death, no significant effects on the final results were observed. Pneumonia, known to be associated with acute hypoxia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, known to be associated with chronic hypoxia, where approximately equally distributed between the two groups and had no significant effects on the results reported here. The loss of muscarinic and the sparing of benzodiazepine receptors occurs in the temporal cortex of histologically normal brains in the absence of significant atrophy and of gross dementia. This means that these changes are early in the development of an alcohol encephalopathy. We have previously reported a decrease in both muscarinic and benzodiazepine receptor binding in the frontal cortex and a decreasing muscarinic but not benzodiazepine receptors in the temporal cortex of alcohol abusers. Taken together, these findings suggest that alcohol neurotoxicity does not simply result in a random loss of neurons and or their associated synapses with their receptors. Instead, different types of receptors, depending upon their location in different brain regions, are specifically affected or spared. This suggests the involvement of region- and receptor-specific mechanisms in chronic alcohol toxicity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "9": "The distribution of 3 GABAA receptor alpha-subunit mRNAs in various regions of bovine brain has been investigated using in situ hybridization. Whereas the alpha 2- and alpha 3-transcripts are of low abundance in all regions except striatum, the alpha 1-transcript is considerably enriched in the inferior colliculus, olfactory bulb and substantia nigra, and appears to be correlated with benzodiazepine type I receptor localization.", 
    "10": "The specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam was studied to biochemically specify the morphological alterations induced in mouse cerebellum by a single injection of an antimitotic agent, methylazoxymethanol (MAM) performed at the beginning of the postnatal life. The MAM injection causes a general reduction of the benzodiazepine receptors in the adult mice which is particularly severe in mice having been injected the 1st day of postnatal life (so-called MAM0 mice) as compared to animals injected the 5th day (MAM5 mice): in MAM0 mice the benzodiazepine receptor is reduced to half of the control value. The affinity of the benzodiazepine towards its receptor was not affected and the topographic and biochemical action of MAM in the central nervous system was ascertained. Correlations could be made between the biochemical modifications and the morphological alterations otherwise described.", 
    "11": "Carr and Coons (1982a, 1982b) found that lateral hypothalamic (LH) stimulation ameliorates the aversiveness of stimulation of pain-implicated nucleus gigantocellularis (NGC), but this finding disagrees with other findings. To resolve this disagreement, we tested whether amelioration is differentially associated with the ability of LH stimulation to support self-stimulation (SS), to support responding to escape LH stimulation (LH escape), or to elicit stimulation-bound feeding (SBF). LH stimulation not yielding SBF always increased responding to escape from NGC stimulation (NGC escape) and was reward-escape in nature in supporting LH escape as well as SS. By contrast, LH stimulation yielding SBF always reduced NGC escape and was purely rewarding in that it only supported SS and never LH escape. In an additional experiment, the anxiolytic diazepam augmented the ability of LH stimulation yielding SBF to reduce NGC escape.", 
    "12": "The effects of repeated swim stress on brain benzodiazepine receptors were examined in the mouse using both an in vivo and in vitro binding method. Specific in vivo binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 to benzodiazepine receptors was decreased in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, midbrain and striatum after repeated swim stress (7 consecutive days of daily swim stress) when compared to nonstressed mice. In vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding was unaltered after repeated swim stress in the cerebellum and pons medulla. The stress-induced reduction in in vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding did not appear to be due to altered cerebral blood flow or to an alteration in benzodiazepine metabolism or biodistribution because there was no difference in [14C]iodoantipyrine distribution or whole brain concentrations of clonazepam after repeated swim stress. Saturation binding experiments revealed a change in both apparent maximal binding capacity and affinity after repeated swim stress. Moreover, a reduction in clonazepam's anticonvulsant potency was also observed after repeated swim stress [an increase in the ED50 dose for protection against pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures], although there was no difference in pentylenetetrazol-induced seizure threshold between the two groups. In contrast to the results obtained in vivo, no change in benzodiazepine receptor binding kinetics was observed using the in vitro binding method. These data suggest that environmental stress can alter the binding parameters of the benzodiazepine receptor and that the in vivo and in vitro binding methods can yield substantially different results.", 
    "13": "2-(5-Alkylthien-3-yl)-(1),2-(4-alkylthien-2-yl)-(2), and 2-(5-alkylthien-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolines (3) were prepared in four steps starting from ethyl 4-chloroquinoline-3-carboxylate (4) and hydrazinothiophene-carboxylates 5, 8, and 9. All the assayed compounds possessed high affinities for benzodiazepine receptors (Ki = 0.3-2.6 nM). The activities of agonists and inverse agonists were assessed on the basis of inhibition or facilitation of pentylenetetrazole-induced convulsions, respectively. Introduction of alkyl groups of different sizes into the unsubstituted inverse agonistic compounds results in a corresponding shift in the activity from an inverse agonist to an antagonist to an agonist. The susceptibility of such a shift increases in the order of 1 less than 2 less than 3. This tendency may be explained by slight differences in the geometry of the alkyl substituents among the three series.", 
    "14": "Two monoclonal antibodies, bd-17 and bd-24, specific for the beta- and alpha-subunit of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride channel complex, respectively, were used to determine the subcellular distribution of immunoreactivity in the cerebellum by electron microscopy. The 2 antibodies showed similar antigen distribution on the plasma membrane (except in the rat; bd-24 does not recognize the rat antigen), but intracellular immunoreactivity was more prevalent for the alpha-subunit. The plasma membrane of all neuronal types was immunopositive. The degree of immunoreactivity varied greatly between different types of cell, but it was stereotyped among individual cells of the same type. Granule cells showed the strongest immunoreactivity, not only on their dendrites which receive synapses from GABA-containing Golgi cell terminals, but also on their somata which do not receive synapses. Stellate and basket cells were somewhat weaker in immunoreactivity. Purkinje cells were only weakly positive on their somatic membrane but stronger on their dendritic shafts and spines. Golgi cells showed negligible if any immunoreactivity. Neurons of the deep cerebellar nuclei were strongly immunopositive along their plasma membrane. Immunoreactivity was strong in cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi saccules of stellate and basket cells, variable in Purkinje cells, while granule cells were rarely immunoreactive intracellularly. It is suggested that these differences reflect differences in the turnover of the receptor complex in the different cell types. The synaptic clefts established by boutons of the GABAergic stellate, basket, and Golgi cells were immunopositive, as were many synapses in the deep cerebellar nuclei. However, immunoreactivity was also present along the nonjunctional plasma membrane, and it was concluded that this reflected the distribution of the antigen. The synaptic clefts at the presumed glutamate-releasing parallel and mossy fiber terminals were almost always immunonegative. No immunoreactivity was detected on axons, nerve terminals, or glial cells. The results demonstrate that different neuronal types express the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor/chloride channel complex to different degrees. The distribution of the receptor complex suggests that the cellular topography of GABAergic influence is not governed by the precise spatial arrangement of the receptors but by the precise placement of the GABA-releasing terminals, a characteristic of the cerebellar circuit.", 
    "15": "The distribution and mobility of GABA/benzodiazepine receptors has been examined on living nerve cells by fluorescence digital imaging and fluorescence photobleach recovery with 2 novel fluorescent derivatives of the benzodiazepines Ro7-1986 and 1012S. These fluorescent derivatives retain their high affinity for the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex with Ks of 79 and 85 nM, respectively. Digital fluorescence imaging of GABA/benzodiazepine receptors on rat spinal cord neurons maintained in culture reveal that, even in the absence of observable synaptic contact, GABA/benzodiazepine receptors are localized on the cell body in clusters of very high density. Receptor density on processes is lower than on cell bodies, although occasional areas of intense fluorescence were observed. Fluorescence photobleach recovery measurements show that 70% of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptors on the cell body and greater than 85% on the processes of rat spinal cord neurons are immobile. In comparison, voltage-gated sodium channels are diffusely distributed and very mobile on the cell body (D = 10(-9) cm2/sec). The results suggest that even in the absence of nerve-nerve cell contact, there are specific mechanisms that segregate GABA/benzodiazepine receptors to the neuronal cell body and control their lateral mobility.", 
    "16": "In studying the role of serotonin (5-HT) in the mechanism of action of benzodiazepine (BDZ)-induced wet-dog shakes (WDS), only certain 1,4-substituted BDZ agonists were found to induce WDS at doses up to 60 mg/kg in the rat with the rank order of potency at peak dose effect clonazepam greater than nitrazepam = flunitrazepam much greater than nimetazepam = lorazepam. BDZs evoking WDS at lowest doses contained an R7 nitro group on the A ring. Non-BDZ agonists (CL 218,872), inverse agonists (beta-CCE), peripheral type receptor agonists (Ro 5-4864), and BDZ antagonists (Ro 15-1788) did not induce shaking behavior. Several 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 agonists and antagonists were tested as blockers, but only putative 5-HT1A agonists reduced WDS, 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone but not PAPP and 5-MeO-DMT having a significant effect. The effect of 8-OH-DPAT was dose dependent, with an ID50 of 0.86 mg/kg, but it was not reversed by 5-HT or adrenergic antagonists at the doses studied. Intracisternal 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions did not alter frequency, latency, or time course of BDZ-induced WDS. BDZ-evoked WDS were enhanced by Ro 15-1788 (which inhibited ataxia) but were unaffected by the various types of BDZ agonists. Several BDZ agonists induced both WDS and ataxia, but ataxia was not blocked by serotonergic drugs. No significant correlation with ataxia, BDZ radioligand binding, antipentylenetetrazol activity, or other BDZ property was found. BDZ-evoked WDS may relate to the unique predominance of BDZ II and 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus, an important site for WDS, but 5-HT1A agonists appear to modulate WDS by opposing pharmacologic actions rather than by direct receptor antagonism. These data indicate a species difference in the shakes induced by BDZs in rats (5-HT2 independent) and in mice (5-HT2 related).", 
    "17": "The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT increased serum corticosterone concentration in rats in a dose-dependent manner. The synthetic corticoid dexamethasone lowered the serum corticosterone level and abolished its rise induced by 8-OH-DPAT. The corticosterone response to 8-OH-DPAT was also antagonized by spiperone, (+/-)- and (-)-pindolol and (+/-)-propranolol, all of which have been shown to have a high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors, though in most cases no complete blockade was found. A partial antagonism of the response was also observed after flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist. On the other hand, the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist 21009, the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists ketanserin and pirenperone, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan, the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with no affinity to 5-HT1 receptors, atenolol, the dopaminergic antagonist pimozide, the histamine receptor blocker chloropyramine and the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone did not affect the hormonal response to 8-OH-DPAT. The 8-OH-DPAT-induced corticosterone secretion was not affected either in rats pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase) or p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, a drug-inducing lesion of serotonergic nerve terminals). It is concluded that 8-OH-DPAT-induced increase in serum corticosterone concentration results from its action at a site different than the adrenal cortex and is mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, whereas other subtypes (5-HT1B, 5-HT2, 5-HT3) of 5-HT receptors do not participate in this response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "18": "We hypothesized that the dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (DHEA-S)/cortisol ratio, which has been used as an index of adrenocortical function, would be altered in panic disorder patients and would change after treatment. We evaluated 10 male and 14 female outpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder. Of these 24 subjects, 13 were treated with clonazepam, 8 were treated with alprazolam, and 3 were treated with placebo as part of a double-blind study. The DHEA-S/cortisol ratio values in the 24 patients with panic disorder (mean = 20.5, SD = 11.6) were significantly higher than those of a group of 60 normal controls (mean = 11.5, SD = 6.01) and were also significantly higher than those of a group of 22 depressed patients (mean = 10.6, SD = 6.33). Although there was no significant difference in the pretreatment DHEA-S/cortisol ratio values between male (mean = 23.6, SD = 11.8) and female (mean = 18.2, SD = 11.3) panic disorder patients, the effects of treatment on this ratio differed between the two sexes. In fact, in the female patients there was a significant decrease in the DHEA-S/cortisol ratio at the end of the study (mean = 15.1, SD = 7.9), while in the male patients there was no significant change in this ratio at the end of the study (mean = 30.2, SD = 21.4). No significant differences were noted between pretreatment and posttreatment DHEA-S/cortisol ratio values in patients treated with alprazolam (n = 8), in patients treated with clonazepam (n = 13), or in patients treated with placebo (n = 3).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Benzodiazepines are widely used as neuroleptics in anaesthesia, but they give rise to drowsiness at the end of surgery. Anexate is an imidazobenzodiazepine with specific antagonistic activity for benzodiazepines. We have administered 0.2 mg i.v. of the drug to 20 adult patients after anaesthesia with tiopentale (250 mg), pancuronium bromide (0.07 mg.kg-1), flunitrazepam (2 mg) and fentanyl (0.10 mg); after the first dose fentanyl was administered (0.10 mg) about every 30 minute. Analgesia was supplemented with nitrous oxide 66%. Blood pressure and heart rate did not changes significantly after Anexate; respiratory volume increased significantly in all cases (ANOVA P less than 0.001). Consciousness was rapidly resumed in all cases and patients demonstrated to be oriented in time and space soon after Anexate. In 14 out of 20 patients drowsiness reappeared after about 30 minute and further doses of 0.1 mg of the drug (to a maximum of 0.4 mg in some cases) were necessary. Side effects were rare and slight, their occurrence depending on the speed of administration. In our opinion a total dose of 0.3 to 0.4 mg Anexate is need to fully antagonize the sedative effect of 2 mg flunitrazepam.", 
    "20": "The effect of diazepam on activation of the mesoprefrontal dopamine (DA) system by an emotional stress model without direct physical stimuli was examined. Environmental stimuli previously paired with inescapable footshock (conditioned fear) elicited increases in levels of the DA metabolite, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), in the medial prefrontal cortex and of plasma corticosterone in rats. The increases in both levels were blocked by pretreatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg, IP); such blocking effects were reversed by Ro 15-1788 (15 mg/kg, IP), the benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist. These data suggest that diazepam can block activation of mesoprefrontal DA neurons as well as hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical system elicited by the conditioned fear paradigm. This action appears to be a specific action of BZDs mediated through BZD receptors. We suggest that blocking effects of BZDs on the hyperactivity of the mesoprefrontal DA neurons may be one neural mechanism of their anxiolytic actions.", 
    "21": "Drinking of 0.85% saline by nondeprived rats was significantly enhanced by chlordiazepoxide (5 or 10 mg/kg) and by valproate (100 or 300 mg/kg), drug effects being strongest in the earlier parts of a 30-minute test. When given alone, both bicuculline and picrotoxin significantly reduced saline drinking at 2.5 mg/kg, but not 1.5 mg/kg. Administration of valproate at either dose or of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg) completely prevented bicuculline action and 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide reduced it. Picrotoxin, however, largely prevented the actions of both chlordiazepoxide and valproate. The increase in saline drinking induced by valproate (300 mg/kg) was also blocked by RO15-1788 (10 or 25 mg/kg). These findings are discussed in the context of the three-site model of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. It is concluded that drugs acting at the benzodiazepine site or the chloride ion channel affect saline drinking, but that there is little evidence of an important functional role for the GABAa site at present.", 
    "22": "A close correlation between purpuric reaction and drugs was observed in seven cases of chronic pigmented purpura. The patients developed purpuric lesions after taking certain drugs for more than 3 years, were thiamine propyldisulfide in 2 cases, and chlordiazepoxide in 1 case. The purpuric lesions stopped recurring after removal of the drugs in the rest of the cases. It is suggested that drugs are among the etiological factors in chronic pigmented purpura.", 
    "23": "This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of diazepam in the presence and absence of glibenclamide, metformin or their combination on serum levels of glucose, insulin and chromium in rats. Results indicated that diazepam (10 mg/kg i.p.) induced marked hyperglycaemic effects in hyperglycaemic rats. This effect was associated with significant reductions in serum chromium levels and insignificant reduction in serum insulin levels. Diazepam-induced hyperglycaemia was counteracted by concurrent administration of glibenclamide (5 mg/kg orally), metformin (500 mg/kg orally) or their combination. The effect of diazepam on serum chromium level was counteracted partially by administration of glibenclamide and augmented in the presence of metformin or its combination with glibenclamide. It is concluded that the diazepam-induced hyperglycaemia, as well as the hypoglycaemic effect of glibenclamide, might be related to changes in serum chromium levels.", 
    "24": "Whereas in adults the use of Innovar for premedication has been abolished, the combination of midazolam and Innovar is still recommended for the premedication of children. This combination may lead to an additional depressive effect on respiration. A prospective, randomized study was performed to evaluate the risk of ventilatory depression. In 36 infants capillary blood gas values were measured pre- and postmedication with either rectal midazolam (0.4 mg/kg) and i.m. Innovar (0.04 ml/kg) or after oral chlorprothixene (2.0 mg/kg). After chlorprothixen the blood gas values did not change, whereas after the combination of midazolam and Innovar pCO2 rose significantly from 35.5 to 43.0 mmHg. In 7 of 22 cases pCO2 reached values above 45 mmHg. This difference compared to the chlorprothixene group was significant (p less than 0.05). The pH fell significantly from 7.42 to 7.36 in the combination group. Clinical signs of respiratory depression could not be observed in this group. The combination of midazolam with Innovar is therefore not useful for premedication in infants and young children.", 
    "25": "In dwarf goats fasted for 2 h, i.v. administration of the benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists diazepam (60 micrograms/kg), brotizolam (2 and 4 micrograms/kg) and climazolam (100 micrograms/kg) induced hyperphagic effects, whereas i.v. injections of the BZ-antagonist flumazenil (R degrees 15-1788; 0.5 mg/kg), the anthelmintic ivermectin (0.1 mg/kg), the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserine (0.1 mg/kg), ACTH (10 micrograms/kg) and prednisolone (1 mg/kg) were inactive in a 30-min feeding test. Both the BZ-antagonist R degrees 15-3505 (greater than or equal to 0.1 mg/kg) and the opiate receptor antagonist naloxone (0.1 mg/kg) had anorectic effects in dwarf goats given 30 min access to a palatable pelleted concentrate. The hyperphagic effects of climazolam and brotizolam were not antagonized by flumazenil, whereas similar doses of this drug completely reversed muscle incoordination and ataxia induced by much higher doses of these BZ-agonists. In the combination experiments with naloxone and BZ-agonists, naloxone antagonized the hyperphagic effects of both diazepam and brotizolam. Similarly, in the diazepam-R degrees 15-3505 study, there was a significant effect of diazepam and a significant inhibition of this effect by R degrees 15-3505 (50 micrograms/kg). In the diazepam-ivermectin combination experiment no evidence for drug potentiation was found. These results and the mode of action of the above mentioned drugs are discussed in relation to feeding behaviour.", 
    "26": "The amnestic effects of flunitrazepam (2 mg intravenously) were studied in normal volunteers with emphasis on their relationship to sleep and their reversal by two specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-3505). The test battery was based on available clinical tests to assess various aspects of encoding and recall. The results suggest that flunitrazepam impairs acquisition of new information by interfering with encoding, and that these effects are clearly independent of sleep. Flunitrazepam effects on memory were fully reversed by both antagonists, as were the subjective and objective signs of sedation. This speaks against the hypothesis of different receptors for sedative and amnestic effects. Ro 15-3505 had shorter lasting effects than Ro 15-1788 and interfered with some tests; this is discussed in relation to its inverse agonistic effects.", 
    "27": "Ten patients with severe disabling myoclonus were treated with clonazepam, sodium valproate, primidone and piracetam alone, or in different combinations. Electrophysiological assessment indicated a cortical origin for the myoclonus in every case. Considerable improvement of myoclonus was achieved with combinations of these drugs in all patients, but this was not possible with monotherapy. In one patient two drugs were necessary (clonazepam and piracetam); in the others more than two drugs were required. The combination of sodium valproate, clonazepam and primidone (3 patients), or piracetam, clonazepam and primidone (3 patients), or the four drugs together (3 patients) was necessary to provide substantial relief of myoclonus. Such polytherapy generally was tolerated well. The benefits of treatment continued for more than 1 year in all cases, although progressive underlying pathology often caused other increasing disability.", 
    "28": "Reversal of the sedative and amnesic effects of intravenous diazepam by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was investigated in 30 patients undergoing conscious sedation for dental surgery. Verbal memory tasks were administered and patients' subjective ratings of mood were obtained before and after diazepam and then periodically after intravenous administration of flumazenil or placebo under double-blind conditions. Immediate and delayed recall and recognition tests showed that diazepam impaired memory and that flumazenil partially reversed this impairment. The subjective ratings showed that diazepam produced physical and mental sedation and that flumazenil reversed this sedation. The reversal produced a return to presurgery scores for mental sedation but not for physical sedation or memory. For physical sedation, the difference between flumazenil and placebo was not demonstrable for more than 15 min after flumazenil administration; for mental sedation, it was demonstrable for as long as 60 min. The reversal by flumazenil of diazepam-induced memory impairment did not change significantly over time.", 
    "29": "Bile acids have experimentally been found to damage the gastric mucosa and, thus, may be involved in stress lesion pathogenesis. We therefore measured intragastric bile acid concentrations in 26 critically ill, artificially ventilated patients. The control group consisted of eight healthy volunteers, whose treatment was similar to that of the patients with respect to bed rest, enteral feeding, and administration of H2-blockers. Gastric contents were aspirated via a gastric tube every hour for 24 h. Patients had higher intragastric bile acid concentrations than healthy controls, whether fasting [median 1.3 mmol/L (range 0.7-2.5) versus 0.3 (0.2-0.5) (p less than 0.05)] or fed via a gastric tube [1.3 (0.4-4.0) versus 0.4 (0.2-0.7) (p less than 0.05)]. Physiotherapy, nursing, and drugs (opiates, benzodiazepines, dopamine, pirenzepine, and metoclopramide) had no detectable influence on intragastric bile acid concentrations and pH in patients. We conclude that patients at risk to develop stress lesions have largely increased gastric bile acid concentrations that probably are due to increased duodenogastric reflux. This might be relevant for stress lesion pathogenesis.", 
    "30": "Pharmacodynamic and quantitative autoradiographic studies were performed to characterize the muscarinic receptors on the endothelium and smooth muscle of the rabbit thoracic aorta. The antagonistic effect of atropine and pirenzepine on the relaxation induced by acetylcholine showed that the relaxation was mediated by muscarinic receptors with pA2 values of 9.4 and 6.6, respectively, suggesting the presence of muscarinic receptors on the endothelium with low affinity for pirenzepine. The quantitative autoradiographic study using [3H]-propylbenzilylcholine mustard (3H-PrBCM) showed that the specific 3H-PrBCM binding was time dependent and saturable. Saturation times of the bindings were not significantly different between the receptors on the endothelium and those on the smooth muscle layer. The density of the receptors was higher in the smooth muscle layer than in the endothelium. The specific [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (3H-QNB) binding was displaced by atropine or pirenzepine dose dependently. IC50 of pirenzepine for the receptors on the endothelium was not significantly different from that for the receptors on the smooth muscle layer. These findings suggest that there is a smaller density of muscarinic receptors on the endothelium than on the smooth muscle layer of the rabbit thoracic aorta. The muscarinic receptors on the endothelium can be subclassified into the same subtype as the receptors on the smooth muscle layer, which have low affinity for pirenzepine.", 
    "31": "The activity of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GT) in duodenal mucosa both in healthy rats and in rats experimentally ulcerated with indomethacin increases significantly after oral administration of pirenzepine as well as ranitidine but not after oral administration of sucralphate. These increase in gamma-GT activity may contribute to the cytoprotective effects already described for pirenzepine and ranitidine.", 
    "32": "Chronic treatment with benzodiazepine receptor agonists increases sensitivity to the convulsant action of FG 7142, an inverse agonist. We investigated whether or not changes in the number and function of GABA-gated chloride channels accompanies this increased sensitivity. Diazepam, 5 mg.kg-1, was administered to mice daily for five days, and mice were then tested with a single injection of FG 7142, 40 mg.kg-1, at several intervals thereafter. At 24 hours after the last diazepam dose, 10 of 15 mice had clonic seizures following FG 7142 and four of the remaining five had myoclonic jerks. At 48 hours, only one of six mice developed a clonic seizure, and none were observed in mice tested at 96 or 144 hours. Muscimol-stimulated chloride flux was reduced in cortical synaptosomes from diazepam-treated mice at 24 hours but not at 48 or 96 hours. However, the binding of [35S]TBPS, a ligand closely associated with the chloride channel, was unchanged at 24 hours. These results suggest that a transient diminution in GABA-gated chloride channel function; unaccompanied by a reduction in channel number, may underlie the sensitization to the convulsant action of FG 7142 observed after withdrawal from chronic diazepam treatment.", 
    "33": "Several findings suggest that barbiturates and alcohol produce their sedative effects through a common neural and possibly a common genetic mechanism. We tested this hypothesis by examining the correlation between ethanol and pentobarbital sedative effects in individual animals from a genetically heterogeneous population. The duration of pentobarbital-induced hypnosis (sleep-time) was unrelated to the sleep-time produced by ethanol in heterogeneous stock (HS) mice. Therefore, the present study also examined the effect of ethanol, pentobarbital, and flunitrazepam on muscimol-stimulated chloride flux into brain membranes prepared from HS mice selected for differences in pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced sleep-time. Brain membranes from mice selected for differences in ethanol sleep-time were differentially responsive to ethanol- and flunitrazepam-, but not to pentobarbital-induced augmentation of muscimol-stimulated chloride flux. No differences in augmentation of chloride flux by ethanol, pentobarbital, or flunitrazepam were found in membranes prepared from mice differentially sensitive to pentobarbital hypnosis. The ability of muscimol to stimulate chloride uptake was not related to ethanol or pentobarbital sensitivity. These findings suggest that sensitivity to ethanol is not likely to be genetically linked to pentobarbital sensitivity.", 
    "34": "D,L-4-(3,4-dichlorobenzoylamino)-5-(N-3-methoxypropyl-pentylami no)-5- oxopentanoic acid (CR 1505; loxiglumide) is a newly developed analog of proglumide. We examined the inhibitory effects of loxiglumide on pancreatic exocrine function in the isolated pancreatic acini and the isolated perfused pancreata of rats. Loxiglumide inhibited cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8)-stimulated amylase release and, similarly, binding of [125I]CCK-8 to isolated rat pancreatic acini. Loxiglumide was about 3000 times more potent than the reference substance proglumide, but was about 1000 times less potent than L-364,718, another new CCK antagonist having benzodiazepine ring, in inhibiting CCK-8-stimulated amylase release. The inhibitory effect of loxiglumide displayed competitive kinetics and was specific for CCK in that the effects of other receptor secretagogues or agents bypassing receptors were not altered. The inhibitory effect of loxiglumide was fully reversible in isolated acini. However, the pancreata perfused with 10 microM loxiglumide for 20 min did not respond to CCK-8 for more than 20 min even after the removal of loxiglumide infusion. In contrast, an immediate increase in pancreatic exocrine secretion was observed after proglumide removal. Loxiglumide appeared to be bound to the receptors on acinar cells in a slowly dissociating state. These results indicate that loxiglumide acts as a potent, competitive, and specific CCK antagonist on the exocrine pancreas and, because of its prolonged inhibitory action, may be useful as a therapeutic agent in pancreatic disease.", 
    "35": "Diazepam acts as an inhibitor of the carnitine translocation through the mitochondrial inner membrane. Diazepam needs however to be added during the phase of exchange. If added during the loading phase and washed during the usual washing the diazepam still found in the mitochondrial fraction is not sufficient to exert any inhibition. Kinetic studies indicate a non-competitive inhibition and a complex carnitine-diazepam-translocase is likely to be formed.", 
    "36": "The 5-HT1A receptor subtype agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (50-1000 micrograms/kg s.c.) dose dependently increased rat plasma corticosterone. Tube restraint for 30 min also increased plasma corticosterone; this effect was completely blocked by (-)-pindolol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Increases of corticosterone following either 8-OH-DPAT injection or restraint were significantly greater in female animals. The restraint stress-induced changes but not those due to 8-OH-DPAT were decreased by pretreatment with the tranquiliser chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.). In anaesthetized rats, restraint no longer significantly affected corticosterone levels but 8-OH-DPAT caused increases which (though much attenuated) were significantly greater in the females. Dose-dependent increases of plasma corticosterone also resulted on infusing 8-OH-DPAT (500-1500 ng) into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; increases were significantly greater in the females. As mentioned in the discussion, these results may be relevant to the greater incidents of depression in women and the possible role of adrenal corticoids in the illness.", 
    "37": "The effects of various benzodiazepines on chronotropic responses were assayed in spontaneously beating rat isolated atria. The increases in atrial rate obtained from concentration-response curves to noradrenaline were reduced dose dependently by both the peripheral agonist, Ro 5-4864 5 and 10 microM, and the mixed agonist, diazepam 5, 10 and 50 microM, but not by the central benzodiazepine agonist, clonazepam 10 and 30 microM. The inhibitory effects of the benzodiazepines on the atrial responses to noradrenaline were not counteracted by either the peripheral benzodiazepine antagonist, PK 11195 10 microM, or the central benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 10 and 100 microM. Both 10 microM Ro 5-4864 and 10 microM diazepam also reduced the increases in atrial rate produced by either the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, or the adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin. On the contrary, diazepam and Ro 5-4864 did not modify the chronotropic responses of the atria either to direct exposure to CaCl2 or to the calcium agonist, BAY K 8644. The increases in the intracellular levels of cAMP induced by noradrenaline were not modified by Ro 5-4864 and were even increased by 50% in the presence of diazepam. It is concluded that benzodiazepines probably reduce the chronotropic responses to noradrenaline in rat isolated atria through the interaction with the cAMP-linked chain of events that follows the activation of beta-adrenoceptors.", 
    "38": "The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNpr), a brain area rich in GABA and benzodiazepine receptors, is thought to be involved in the regulation of seizure activity. It has been shown to be a site of anticonvulsant action of substances that affect GABA transmission. The anti-pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) activities of intranigral of muscimol, a GABAA receptor agonist; two benzodiazepines, midazolam and flurazepam; and GABA were examined. Microinjection of a wide dose range of both GABA and muscimol into the SNpr failed to show anti-PTZ seizure activity. Intranigral injections of midazolam and flurazepam showed clear, dose-dependent anti-PTZ effects. Ro15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reversed the anticonvulsant effects of midazolam when both were infused intranigrally. Intranigral infusion of muscimol or flurazepam protected rats from bicuculline-induced tonic seizures. The results suggest that the anti-PTZ effects of benzodiazepines in SNpr might not be mediated through GABAA receptors. Another possibility is that nigral neurons bearing GABAA receptors functionally linked to benzodiazepine sites may not be representative of the whole population of nigral neurons inhibited by GABA agonists. This could result in different patterns of inhibition of nigral efferent activity by GABAA agonists and benzodiazepines.", 
    "39": "The object of the investigation is to describe the consumption of psychopharmaca and hypnotics in nursing homes and, simultaneously, to describe the environment in the nursing homes. Five nursing homes supervised by the same practitioner participated. The medicine consumed by 125 residents was registered. Ninety-two residents were interviewed. Psychopharmaca were administered to 37% of the residents. The consumption varied only slightly between the five nursing homes (from 30% to 42%). The consumption was not associated with proportion of patients who had been referred on account of mental incapacity. Hypnotics in the form of benzodiazepines were employed by 50% of the residents (variations from 36% to 65%). The duration of administration of nocturnal sedatives was, on an average, 21 months. This consumption was not associated with mental incapacity or the duration of the stay in the home. The nursing home environment was assessed by interviews with the residents. Considerable satisfaction was expressed concerning order and organisation and also community spirit. On the other hand, only limited feelings of frankness existed among the residents. Many residents felt more frequently lonely after placement in nursing homes. The two nursing homes where the residents had the greatest feeling of frankness and community spirit had the lowest consumptions of nocturnal sedatives.", 
    "40": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) synaptic pharmacology was studied in cultured mouse spinal cord using various biochemical techniques. The intact cultures were used to study GABA uptake, benzodiazepine (BZ) binding and GABA-stimulated 36Cl-influx, all under similar physiological conditions. The cultures appear to contain a population of GABAergic neurons, since there was evidence of neuronal active transport of [3H]GABA by these cells. There also was a significant population of neuronal BZ receptors based on the finding of clonazepam-displaceable [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) binding. In addition, the presence of GABA receptors coupled to the BZ receptors was shown by the enhancement of FLU binding by GABA (10-100 microM). GABAA and glycine-coupled Cl- channels were also demonstrated using 36Cl-influx. GABA-induced 36Cl-influx was specific for GABAA agonists, since GABAB receptor agonist, baclofen and other excitatory neurotransmitters did not alter the 36Cl-influx. Both GABA (Km = 9.1 microM) and muscimol (Km = 2.0 microM) produced concentration-dependent increases in 36Cl-influx in the cultures. The GABA-stimulated Cl-influx was blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist (+)bicuculline (IC50 = 4.5 microM) and by the Cl- channel antagonist picrotoxinin (IC50 = 25 microM). These results indicate that spinal cord cultures are a useful model for comparing the binding characteristics of the GABA receptor complex to the activation of the coupled Cl- channels using the 36Cl-influx assay.", 
    "41": "Excitatory postsynaptic field potentials (termed U1 and U2 waves) were extracellularly recorded from superficial layers of the frog optic tectum in vitro following stimulation of the contralateral optic nerve. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) largely enhanced the U1 and U2 waves, an effect which was progressively diminished by lowering the extracellular Cl- content. Muscimol or 3-aminopropanesulphonic acid (3-APS) was more potent than GABA in enhancing the U1 and U2 waveforms, whereas trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (TACA) was equipotent, its cis isomer (CACA) being less active. The action of GABA, TACA and CACA was relatively insensitive to bicuculline (100 microM). Pentobarbitone increased the U1 and U2 waves and antagonized the action of GABA. Midazolam did not change the GABA-induced responses. Picrotoxin antagonized both pentobarbitone and GABA effects. It is suggested that in the frog optic tectum GABA can activate an atypical receptor mechanism blocked by picrotoxin but comparatively insensitive to bicuculline.", 
    "42": "Possible development of anticonvulsant tolerance to three benzodiazepine receptor ligands was assessed in mice using an i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol as the convulsive stimulus. Extensive tolerance developed rapidly in the case of diazepam (0.35 mg/kg b.d. or 1.5 mg/kg b.d.). No significant tolerance was seen with the imidazopyrimidine derivative RU 32698 (9 mg/kg b.d.) or the partial agonist benzodiazepine Ro 17-1812 (1 mg/kg b.d.) These results provide further support for the hypothesis that partial agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor induce less tolerance than full agonists.", 
    "43": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes in human and guinea pig lung membranes were characterised using selective muscarinic antagonists. Competition experiments were carried out against [3H](-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding at 25 degrees C in Tris-HCl buffer; non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 microM atropine. Of all the antagonists examined, only the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine exhibited a heterogeneous binding profile (nH less than 1.0), best described by two-binding sites of high and low affinity. Binding of [3H]pirenzepine confirmed the presence of a high proportion of high affinity (M1) receptors (60% of total) in human peripheral lung. The high potency of M3-selective antagonists 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) and hexahydrosiladifenidol suggested the presence of M3 receptors, but the low potency of AF-DX 116 and methoctramine indicated that there was no significant population of M2 receptors present. The existence of muscarinic receptor subtypes in lung may have important clinical implication but their cellular localisation remains to be determined.", 
    "44": "Isoniazid, administered to rats one hour before killing produced a dose-dependent enhancement of [35S]t-butylbiciclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS, 2 nM) measured ex vivo in unwashed membrane preparation of the cerebral cortex. Saturation experiments revealed that the effect of isoniazid was due to an increase (+36%) in the total number of [35S]TBPS binding sites. Diazepam (3 mg/kg i.p.) administered 15 min after isoniazid antagonized the enhancement of [35S]TBPS binding elicited by isoniazid. Moreover, diazepam itself induced a significant decrease (-30%) in the total number of [35S]TBPS binding sites. These results provide the first direct evidence that 'in vivo' alterations in the function of the GABA-dependent chloride channel can be detected in vitro by studying the binding of [35S]TBPS to its recognition sites in the GABAA receptor complex. Our finding suggests a new model suitable to study biochemically the function of GABAergic synapses under various physiological and pharmacological conditions.", 
    "45": "The effect of diazepam and its interaction with adenosine on evoked endplate potentials (e.p.p.s) and on twitch tension were investigated in innervated sartorius muscles of the frog. Diazepam (100 microM) reversibly decreased the amplitude of the e.p.p.s and the twitch responses evoked by indirect stimulation, and reversibly increased the resting membrane potential recorded from the endplates. In a concentration (30 microM) virtually devoid of an effect on the e.p.p.s, twitch responses, or resting membrane potential of the muscle fibres, diazepam potentiated the inhibitory action of adenosine on neuromuscular transmission, but not that induced by the stable analogue of adenosine 5'-N-ethylcarboxamide adenosine (NECA), which is not a substrate for the adenosine uptake system. The potentiating effect of diazepam was not observed in the presence of dipyridamole, an adenosine uptake blocker which potentiated the effect of adenosine on neuromuscular transmission. Diazepam shifted to the left the concentration-response curve obtained for adenosine in the presence of the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-phenyltheophylline (8-PT). The results suggest that diazepam acts at the frog neuromuscular junction by increasing the level of adenosine at the junction level; this increase probably results from inhibition in the uptake of the nucleoside.", 
    "46": "Diazepam (DZ) was used as a substrate in drug metabolism studies to characterise the differences in metabolite profiles in hepatocytes isolated from four species: Wistar rat, cynomolgus monkey, beagle dog and man. Hepatocytes were incubated with DZ (20 microM) for 180 min at 3 hr post isolation in culture, and the disappearance of parent compound and appearance of its metabolites determined. DZ disappearance was found to be monoexponential in rat, monkey and human cells, but that DZ disappearance in dog hepatocytes was best described by a two compartment process. There were considerable differences in both the rates of formation and the profiles of metabolites produced from DZ in each species. Drug metabolism of DZ was determined in five human hepatocyte preparations. The rates of formation of both the major metabolites, temezepam (TEM) and nordiazepam (NOR) were highly variable between samples, and oxazepam (OX) was detected in only three of the preparations. There was no evidence of further metabolism of these metabolites, and the profiles were comparable with in vivo findings. In a single case, human hepatocytes were cultured for five days, and DZ was used as substrate to characterise the changes in drug metabolising activities. There was a rapid loss in the production of OX in the initial 24 hr, and a complete loss of 3-hydroxylation activities in the succeeding 120 hr. N-demethylation activities, however, were well maintained, and the appearance of NOR declined to 47% of initial rate. The hepatocytes of all species were found to produce NOR and TEM as metabolites; NOR representing the principal metabolite in the dog, monkey and human cells. In the dog, TEM was found only as a minor metabolite. OX was a significant metabolite in the monkey and a minor metabolite in the dog and human hepatocytes, but was not detected in rat cultures. The principal metabolite in rat cells was 4'-hydroxy diazepam, which was rapidly further metabolised to its glucuronide. The drug metabolising activities of the hepatocyte cultures towards DZ were comparable with the drug metabolism of DZ found in vivo in each species. These findings substantiate hepatocytes as an in vitro model of hepatic metabolism.", 
    "47": "Intravenous administration of etomidate, a nonbarbiturate sedative hypnotic, induced excitement, myoclonus, pain on injection, vomiting, and apnea during induction of anesthesia in 20 experimental dogs and 70 hospitalized dogs. The dogs had excitement and purposeless muscle movements during recovery from anesthesia. The frequency and severity of the side effects were markedly attenuated or eliminated by the administration of diazepam, acepromazine, or morphine prior to etomidate administration.", 
    "48": "Following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex, recovery from somatosensory asymmetry reliably occurs within about 10 days. Chronic exposure to diazepam significantly delays this recovery. In the present study, co-administration of Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist (i.e. it blocks the negative and positive allosteric modulation of GABA), prevented diazepam-induced retardation of recovery from somatosensory asymmetry. Nocturnal ambulatory (motor) activity was not different between rats receiving diazepam-alone and those receiving Ro 15-1788 in combination with diazepam. These data suggest that the benzodiazepine receptor is importantly involved in the detrimental effects of diazepam on recovery, and that non-specific behavior sedation plays little or no role.", 
    "49": "Rats exposed to inescapable tailshock exhibit deficits in learning a simple shuttlebox escape task 24 h later. This syndrome has been termed 'behavioral depression' or 'learned helplessness', and is a model of stress-induced depression. In the present study a significant (25%) decrease in GABA receptor-mediated chloride ion flux as measured by muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in synaptoneurosomes was found in the cerebral cortices of rats that failed the shuttlebox task as compared to naive control rats. Rats which were exposed to tailshock and subsequently learned the escape task did not show a significant difference in muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake as compared to naive control rats. Similarly, rats that failed to learn the shuttlebox escape task had significantly lower in vivo [3H]Ro15-1788 specific binding in cerebral cortex (43%), hippocampus (35%) and striatum (33%) as compared to naive control rats. In cerebellum and hypothalamus, there were significant reductions in specific [3H]Ro15-1788 binding in both animals that failed and animals that learned the shuttlebox escape task as compared to naive controls. To control the stress of the footshock associated with the shuttlebox escape task, we investigated the effect of gridshock in which total footshock received was equivalent to that received by rats who failed the shuttlebox task. There were no differences in muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake or in vivo [3H]Ro15-1788 specific binding between naive controls and rats administered footshock independent of a learning task. These data suggest that the development of stress-induced behavioral depression may be associated with a decrease in GABA receptor-mediated chloride channel function.", 
    "50": "Ethanol has a pharmacological profile similar to that of classes of drugs like benzodiazepines and barbiturates, which enhance GABAergic transmission in the mammalian CNS. Several lines of behavioral, electrophysiological and biochemical studies suggest that ethanol may bring about most of its effects by enhancing GABAergic transmission. Recently, ethanol at relevant pharmacological concentrations has been shown to enhance GABA-induced 36Cl-fluxes in cultured spinal cord neurons, synaptoneurosomes and microsacs. These enhancing effects of ethanol were blocked by GABA antagonists. Ro15-4513, an azido analogue of classical BZ antagonist Ro15-1788, reversed most of the behavioral effects of ethanol and other effects involving 36Cl-flux studies. The studies summarized below indicate that most of the pharmacological effects of ethanol can be related to its effects on GABAergic transmission.",

    "58": "During the period 23.11.1987-6.12.1987, the medical offices of health in the County of Copenhagen and in Frederiksberg undertook an analysis of prescriptions with the object of illustrating the prescriptions of benzodiazepines by ten general practitioners. The investigation included a total of 260 prescriptions for benzodiazepines. On an average, 92 defined daily doses were prescribed per 1,000 women over 15 and 52 defined daily doses per 1,000 men over 15 years. An age-corrected review of the prescriptions revealed scatter in the prescriptions by the practitioners of approximately 300% (29-102 defined daily doses per 1,000 patients per day). All of the practitioners prescribed most for women in the age group 40-70 years. Compared with a corresponding investigation in Roskilde County in 1986, the general practitioners prescribed fewer defined daily doses at a time, after the possibility for repeated issue of prescriptions for benzodiazepines was annulled as from 1.1.1987.", 
    "59": "A number of environmental and pharmacological stimuli capable of inducing phase shifts and/or period changes in the circadian clock of mammals have now been identified. Agents that can alter circadian clocks provide a means for investigating the cellular and neural mechanisms responsible for their generation, regulation and entrainment. Two stimuli that have been used to probe the basis of circadian rhythmicity are pulses of darkness on a background of constant light and injections of short-acting benzodiazepines, such as triazolam. Surprisingly, these two very different stimuli have remarkably similar phase-shifting effects on the circadian clock of hamsters. The observation that a short-term increase in locomotor activity occurs when the circadian activity rhythm of hamsters is shifted by dark pulses or triazolam injections, coupled with the finding that activity bouts themselves are capable of shifting this rhythm, raises the possibility that dark pulses or triazolam alter the circadian clock by inducing acute hyperactivity. Here we demonstrate that the phase-advancing and phase-delaying effects of dark pulses or triazolam on the circadian activity rhythm can be totally suppressed by immobilization of the animals during treatment. These results indicate that behavioural events mediate the phase-shifting effects of both dark pulses and triazolam on the circadian activity rhythm and question present hypotheses regarding the pathways by which light-dark information and pharmacological agents influence circadian pacemakers.", 
    "60": "Chlormethiazole has been extensively employed as a sedative/hypnotic and anticonvulsant for more than 25 years. While pharmacological and electrophysiological studies have implicated the GABAA receptor complex in these actions, neurochemical findings have not been consistent with this conclusion. We now present evidence that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of chlormethiazole perturb the GABAA receptor complex. Chlormethiazole was found to increase 36Cl- uptake into rat cortical synaptoneurosomes in a concentration-dependent (EC50 = 48 +/- 3 microM; Emax = 8.9 +/- 0.8 nmol Cl-/mg protein per 5 s), picrotoxin-sensitive fashion. Chlormethiazole was also found to inhibit the binding of the 'cage' convulsant [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate to rat cortical membranes (IC50 = 58.6 +/- 0.6 microM) through an increase in the apparent KD of this radioligand. Moreover, at these concentrations chlormethiazole did not affect pentobarbital-enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding, but inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding with a low potency (IC50 = 1.6 +/- 0.2 mM). These findings provide neurochemical evidence that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of chlormethiazole can perturb the GABAA receptor complex, and suggest that this compound acts at a distinct locus from other sedative/hypnotics such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and GABAmimetics.", 
    "61": "Pretreatment with the GABA antagonist picrotoxin attenuated the development of an ethanol-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA), while no effect of this compound was observed on the development of an amphetamine-induced CTA. These findings suggested some specificity of the effects of picrotoxin to the psychopharmacological properties of ethanol related to CTA. On the other hand, the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro15-4513, purported to a specific ethanol antagonist, was shown to attenuate both an ethanol- and amphetamine-induced CTA. The results support the notion that ethanol intoxication may be mediated in part by GABAergic mechanisms. These GABA-mediated properties of ethanol may in fact underlie the development of an ethanol-induced CTA.", 
    "62": "Preference for diazepam was assessed in 18 light and 12 moderate social drinkers using a cumulative dosing procedure. The 7-session procedure consisted of: 1) four sampling sessions, during which participants ingested color-coded capsules containing either diazepam (five 4-mg capsules administered at 30-min intervals; total dose 20 mg) or placebo, and 2) three choice sessions, during which they could ingest up to 7 capsules of their preferred color of capsule, each separated by 30 min. Subjective (mood) and behavioral (performance) measures were obtained throughout the 4-hour sessions. The light social drinkers chose diazepam over placebo on 66% of the choice sessions, and ingested a mean dose per session of about 16 mg. The moderate drinkers chose diazepam on 100% of the choice sessions, and ingested an average dose of 25 mg per session. Diazepam produced sedation in both groups, but in the moderate drinkers it also increased measures of subjective effects suggestive of \"euphoria.\" The results indicate that diazepam can serve as a positive reinforcer under laboratory conditions in nondrug-abusing individuals who are moderate users of alcohol and other drugs. Greater reinforcing efficacy may be indicative of higher risk of abuse. The results illustrate the usefulness of the cumulative dosing procedure to measure both drug preference and dose preference.", 
    "63": "This study was undertaken to examine the effects of mianserin (MIA), a tetracyclic antidepressant, and adinazolam (ADI), a new benzodiazepine antidepressant on cardiac function and electrocardiogram in normal and infarcted hearts of anesthetized dogs, and to compare the effects with those of amitriptyline, a commonly used tricyclic antidepressant. The parameters measured were: heart rate (HR); mean arterial blood pressure (MP); aortic flow (AF); maximal rate of increase of left ventricular pressure (LV dp/dt); blood flow of left circumflex of left coronary artery (CAF) and PQ and QRS intervals. The double product (DP) was calculated from HR and the arterial pressure. AMI increased HR, DP, LV dp/dt and CAF in the normal group, while in the infarcted group, AMI increased HR, DP and CAF, but decreased LV dp/dt at 3 mg/kg. AMI at 2 and 3 mg/kg prolonged QRS intervals in the infarcted groups. MIA increased HR and DP in the normal group at doses of 1 mg/kg or more, while in the infarcted group it produced only slight effects in hemodynamic parameters and PQ and QRS intervals. ADI had little effect on hemodynamics and PQ and QRS intervals in the normal group. However, it decreased LV dp/dt, CAF, MP at 3 mg/kg in the infarcted group. In conclusion, AMI markedly influenced cardiac hemodynamics and QRS interval in the myocardial infarcted group, while, on the other hand, MIA and ADI, in clinical doses, had only a slight effect on hemodynamics and PQ and QRS intervals in the infarcted group. Thus MIA and ADI were safer than AMI in the animals with myocardial infarction.", 
    "64": "The action of clonazepam (CZP) against after-discharges (ADs) induced by perforant path stimulation was studied in 11 rats with implanted electrodes. The animals passed 4 sessions: one control, one with the solvent injection, and two with the administration of CZP (either 0.1 or 1 mg/kg i.p.). The ADs were always induced 4 times with 20 min intervals, the injections took place 10 min before the second stimulation. The EEG pattern of ADs was not changed by either dose of CZP and the duration was transiently shortened by the high dose only. Incidence of recurrent ADs tended to decrease after the lower dose of CZP, the higher dose blocked them for at least 30 min. As concerns behavioral concomitants of ADs, wet dog shakes remained uninfluenced by CZP while orienting reaction was either fully blocked (by the high dose of CZP) or significantly suppressed (by the lower dose).", 
    "65": "Five healthy young volunteers were given flunitrazepam 1 mg, triazolam 0.25 mg or placebo at 2 a.m. or 9 a.m. in a double blind, cross-over study. The aim was to investigate the cyclic variations mainly in residual effects of the drugs, but also in sleep onset latency and pharmacokinetics. The study suggested cyclic variations in mood, psychometric tests and in sleep onset latency.", 
    "66": "Quinolone antibiotics, which can be proconvulsant in susceptible patients, were found to inhibit the specific binding of the adenosine receptor ligands L-3H-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine (L-3H-PIA) and 3H-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (3H-NECA) to rat brain synaptic membranes. The inhibitions were concentration dependent, and for both ligands the order of potency was rosoxacin greater than nalidixic acid greater than oxolinic acid greater than or equal to ciprofloxacin greater than norfloxacin greater than enoxacin: IC20 values (concentrations causing a 20% inhibition of specific binding) ranged from 30-35 microM to 1-3 mM. Hill coefficients were approximately 0.5, suggesting that the compounds are probably antagonists at these sites. Most of the compounds did not alter 3H-diazepam binding directly, although rosoxacin showed relatively strong, and enoxacin weak, concentration-dependent inhibition. At 50 microM the compounds enhanced the maximal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) activation of 3H-diazepam binding to varying degrees, without altering the EC50 of activation, whereas at 200 microM they tended to reduce GABA activation. Most noteworthy was the large increase in GABA-stimulated 3H-diazepam binding caused by 50 microM nalidixic acid. The compounds did not alter the Ca2+/Cl- -dependent binding of 3H-glutamate, nor of the binding of the glutamate site-selective ligands 3H-kainate and alpha-3H-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (3H-AMPA); the uptake of the non-metabolized glutamate analogue D-3H-aspartate by cortical homogenates was also unaffected. The CNS side effects of these antibiotics may result, in part, from interaction with sites which mediate the inhibitory neurotransmission of adenosine and, possibly, GABA.", 
    "67": "A sensitive radioimmunoassay was developed for the determination of diazepam. Detection of diazepam in tissues of rats and in blood from unnatural death victims and traffic accident victims was examined by this procedure. Antisera capable of binding [3H] diazepam were obtained by repeated immunization of rabbits with temazepam (oxydiazepam)-3-hemisuccinate conjugated to bovine serum albumin. The antibody of a 1: 10000 dilution could bind approximately 50% of the added radioactivity. The level at least as low as 1 pg of diazepam could be detected by this procedure. This antibody strictly recognized the existence of the methyl group at the position-1 and of the keto group at the position-2 of the benzodiazepine ring, and was highly specific for temazepam and diazepam among benzodiazepine derivatives. But other benzodiazepine derivatives had no cross-reactivity with this antibody. The distribution of diazepam in biological fluids and tissues of rats 1, 2, 4 and 8 hr after intraperitoneal injection was examined. The level of diazepam in serum, saliva, brain and bone marrow declined within 2 hr, while the level in liver and kidney was maximum 2 hr after administration. The concentration of diazepam in each tissue leveled off 4 hr after administration. Among these results the remarkable finding was that the concentration in the bone marrow is much higher than that in serum, saliva and brain, appearing to be due to a high accumulation of diazepam in this tissue. This result indicates that the bone marrow is a very useful material for the detection of diazepam in skeletonized remains. There ware good correlations (gamma = 0.8595-0.9973) in the concentrations of diazepam between serum, saliva and brain, and bone marrow. Detection of diazepam in blood from unnatural death victims and traffic accident victims were examined. Diazepam was identified in 3 cases of 50 unnatural death victims and in 4 cases of 48 traffic accident victims.", 
    "68": "We report the intraarterial injection of a flunitrazepam tablet dissolved in water in a patient with intravenous drugs addiction. Several ecchymotic lesions were present at different sites of the arm. In order to achieve analgesia and the sympathetic blockade of the arm, we performed an axillary perivascular block of the brachial plexus by means of the intermittent injection through a catheter of 0.25% bupivacaine with a 1:200,000 epinephrine solution. In addition, an anticoagulant treatment with heparin was started as prophylaxis of the thrombosis of the vessel. There was a satisfactory clinical course even though a distal phalange had to be amputated on the 18th day. We propose the continuous perivascular block as the method of choice of this type of medical problem.", 
    "69": "104 patients suffering from neurotic or reactive depression were treated with either alprazolam or amitriptyline in randomised, double-blind fashion. Seventeen patients were either lost to follow-up or withdrawn before week 2 (13 due to side effects and 1 because she was feeling better). A further 7 patients did not comply with the protocol, giving a total of 24 patients whose data were not considered suitable for inclusion in the analysis of therapeutic assessments. Evaluation of the 80 patients (40 in each group) who completed at least 2 weeks of the 4-week study demonstrate that both treatments produced a statistically significant response rate. There was a more rapid effect in those patients who received amitriptyline, but there was no significant difference in response between the treatment groups after 4 weeks treatment. Analysis of safety and side effect data on 101 patients (50 treated with alprazolam and 51 with amitriptyline) shows no statistically significant difference in the overall number of side effects experienced in each group, although 11 of those patients who received amitriptyline withdrew because of adverse reactions before completing the study compared to 6 in the alprazolam group. These results suggest that alprazolam may be a useful treatment for patients with neurotic or reactive depression not requiring hospitalisation.", 
    "70": "Twenty patients undergoing clinically indicated elective colonoscopy were prospectively monitored noninvasively for alterations in cardiorespiratory function. Most of the patients were elderly and many had either cardiac or pulmonary disease. All subjects were premedicated with intramuscular meperidine and continuously monitored with ECG, blood pressure, earlobe pulse oximetry, nasal air flow by thermistor probe, and impedance pneumography. Any use of additional analgesic or sedative was determined by the endoscopist, who was blinded to the physiologic tracings, and dosages of medications given were titrated to each patient's tolerance of the procedures as assessed by the endoscopist. Seventeen patients (85%) required additional sedation with the benzodiazepine, midazolam. These patients exhibited frequent episodes of hypotension (reductions in mean arterial blood pressure of 23 +/- 12 mm Hg from baseline, means +/- SD) and respiratory depression (as noted by the greater number of apneas and arterial oxygen desaturation as low as 7.1 +/- 2% from baseline, means +/- SD). In addition, elderly patients and patients with an underlying history of cardiac or pulmonary disease had a greater incidence of potentially untoward cardiorespiratory events.", 
    "71": "We report a reliable, rapid, sensitive, and quantitative method for the N- and O-trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives of the diazolo- and triazolobenzodiazepines after enzymatic incubation (2 h) and liquid-liquid extraction of 0.5-mL urine volumes. Each analyte was identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry through the retention time for the total ion current (TIC) and selected ion monitoring (SIM) of four ion currents. Quantitation of the diazolobenzodiazepines was obtained by the ratio of the base peak ion of the TMS analyte to that of the internal standard bromazepam in the concentration range 50-500 ng/mL (1-10 ng injected into the GC/MS). The limit of detection (LOD) at p less than 0.01 was 50 ng/mL for all the diazolobenzodiazepines. The assay was not quite as sensitive for triazolobenzodiazepines (5-20 ng injected in the GC/MS). The extraction efficiency of the assay ranged from 75 to 92% for all the analytes. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the diazolobenzodiazepines ranged from 5.4 to 9.4% for within-day runs and from 11.1 to 13.9% for between-day runs. For the triazolobenzodiazepines the values were 3.8 to 18.9% for a single day and 3.4 to 19.9% between days. The selected ion current ratio for each analyte was determined for a single day and over a one-week period. There was no statistical difference in the ratios during this time. The confirmation of diazolobenzodiazepines in urine by this method was relatively easy after screening by the immunoassay technique. Identification of triazolobenzodiazepines appeared to be more difficult by both the screening technique and the GC/EI/MS analysis.", 
    "72": "Recently described microcolumn cleanup and high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical reductive mode detection have facilitated the determination of benzodiazepines in contaminated and degraded blood samples. Examples from an extensive application of the procedure to British forensic science casework are given here.", 
    "73": "Male Wistar rats with an initial weight of 170g were maintained on a nutritionally adequate diet, and diazepam was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d. Control animals were pair-fed an adequate diet. The feeding was continued for 180 d, and the effects on brain lipid contents were studied. It was found that the contents of the phospholipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, the monogalactosyl glycolipids, hydroxy and nonhydroxy fatty acyl galactocerebroside, sulfoglycolipids, and the gangliosides, GM1, GD1a, GD1b, and GT1b, were significantly reduced in the brain of diazepam-treated rats. There was a significantly increased content of phosphatidylinositol after 180 d of diazepam treatment. The results suggest that changes in brain lipid content may mediate the adaptive changes that occur upon prolonged exposure to diazepam.", 
    "74": "To test further the conclusions of preliminary reports that regular use of a rapidly-eliminated hypnotic might cause daytime anxiety, 82 women and 38 men, mean age 53, who claimed to be poor sleepers, took a capsule nightly for 45 nights. On 25 consecutive nights the capsule contained triazolam 0.5 mg (40 subjects), lormetazepam 2 mg (40 subjects) or continued placebo (40 subjects). Both drugs improved sleep, but compared with placebo or lormetazepam-takers, triazolam-takers became more anxious on self-ratings, were judged more often to have had a bad response by an observer, more often wrote down complaints of distress, and suffered weight loss. After about 10 days of regular triazolam they tended to develop panics and depression, felt unreal, and sometimes paranoid. The very short life of triazolam, leading to daytime withdrawal symptoms, may account for some of the observations, but enhancement of benzodiazepine inverse agonist activity is also hypothesized.", 
    "75": "This investigation was designed to determine the effect of experimental hyperthyroidism on the hypnotic activity of a benzodiazepine and on the binding characteristics of the benzodiazepine receptor complex. Rats were made hyperthyroid by subcutaneous implantation of slow release pellets containing L-thyroxine. This treatment produced the characteristic symptoms of hyperthyroidism: increased serum thyroxine concentrations, increased heart weight and body temperature, and decreased serum protein concentrations. The hyperthyroid rats and a parallel group of normal animals (with drug-free pellets implanted subcutaneously) were slowly infused intravenously with oxazepam until they lost their righting reflex. The hyperthyroid rats required a significantly larger dose of the benzodiazepine and their total serum and cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of oxazepam (but not the serum concentration of free drug and the brain concentration) at the onset of loss of the righting reflex were modestly but statistically significantly lower than those of the normal rats. The receptor density and affinity for diazepam in hyperthyroid rats were not significantly different from those of the normal animals. Hyperthyroidism apparently affects the pharmacokinetics of oxazepam but has, at best, only a small effect on the pharmacodynamics (hypnotic activity) of the drug.", 
    "76": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam (AD) were evaluated in 21 elderly subjects (mean age, 69 +/- 4 years) at four dose levels during a placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose escalation regimen in which the oral dose was varied from 10 to 60 mg daily, in divided doses. Fifteen subjects received adinazolam mesylate; six received placebo. Plasma samples collected during a single dosing interval in each dosing period (3 days) were assayed for adinazolam and monodesmethyl adinazolam (NDMAD) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Urine samples were collected during a single interval during the 20- and 40-mg daily dose periods and assayed for NDMAD by HPLC. Pharmacologic effects of adinazolam were assessed using psychomotor performance tests and sedation ratings. Adinazolam pharmacokinetics were linear over the dosage range studied. Daily dose had no significant effect on dose-normalized AUC and Cmax for AD. Dose-normalized NDMAD AUC values as well as beta values were not significantly affected by the daily dose of adinazolam. The ratio NDMAD/AD was not substantially affected by the dose. Renal clearance of NDMAD for the 20- and 40-mg daily doses were 5.6 +/- 2.1 and 5.5 +/- 2.2 liters/hr, respectively, and did not correlate with creatinine clearance. Adinazolam and NDMAD did not substantially accumulate in elderly subjects, even upon multiple dosing at 8-hr intervals. The dosing regimens in this experiment appeared to be well tolerated in the elderly, as performance tests and sedation scores indicated no substantial dose-related effects of adinazolam on psychomotor performance.", 
    "77": "Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), was effective in suppressing self-mutilation of a peripherally deafferented hind paw in rats ('autotomy'). This effect was not due to the drug's sedative effect, since locomotor activity was not lower in treated than untreated rats. Daily injections of normal saline also suppressed autotomy, but for a shorter period of time than amitriptyline. This effect was not apparent in diazepam-treated rats, suggesting that the saline injection delayed autotomy as a result of stress-induced anti-nociception. Since amitriptyline is effective in humans in alleviating certain chronic pain disorders, these results further corroborate the suggestion that autotomy is a model of chronic pain, sensitive to centrally acting analgesics and to some forms of stress.", 
    "78": "We retrospectively reviewed all allegations of inappropriate prescribing investigated by the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners from 1981 through 1986. Inappropriate prescription writing accounted for 51% of all investigations during this period, with controlled drugs, primarily opiates and benzodiazepines, accounting for most complaints. Of 130 physicians investigated, more than half had previous complaints; 50 were ultimately restricted or disciplined by the board. Inappropriate prescribing of controlled drugs is probably underdetected and frequently repeated. Available literature suggests that inappropriate prescribing of other drugs, especially antibiotics, is extremely common, but such problems were rarely identified by the current discovery and review processes of the Oregon board. Inappropriate prescribing will require increased attention from physician educators and licensing boards.", 
    "79": "Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery in children with seizure disorders is often complicated by difficulties in administering oral anticonvulsant medications in the preoperative and postoperative periods. Because many newer anticonvulsants do not have parenteral formulations, intravenous phenobarbital, phenytoin, and benzodiazepines may appear necessary in the perioperative period. Eight children with neurologic disease with severe seizure disorders underwent gastrostomy placement and Nissen fundoplication. Perioperatively, their anticonvulsants were given successfully via the rectum. Rectal administration of anticonvulsants is a useful alternative route for drug therapy in seizure patients who are undergoing GI surgery.", 
    "80": "Four case reports are described in which adjunctive alprazolam was administered to schizophrenic or schizoaffective patients who satisfied criteria for the syndrome of \"negative symptoms\". The addition of alprazolam to ongoing neuroleptic and antiparkinsonian drug treatment produced substantial clinical benefit in only one of these cases, and that benefit was not replicated in a second trial in this case. These results are discussed in comparison to previously reported findings in other alprazolam-treated \"negative symptom\" patients.", 
    "81": "Alternating hemiplegia in childhood (Verret, 1971) is a disorder presenting with frequent episodes of alternating hemiplegia from early infancy. We report a patient with this disorder, along with a pathophysiological study and a discussion about the available therapies for this disorder. The patient, an 11-year-old boy, visited our hospital with episodes of alternating hemiplegia from early infancy. His family history showed that many members suffered from migraine. He was born with asphyxia. Mental and motor developmental delays were seen from early infancy. The hemiplegic episodes with ipsilateral facial palsy had occurred frequently from early infancy. The episodes were frequently induced by emotional stress. The duration of hemiplegia varied from 10 minutes to 3 days. From the age of 11 years, he had begun to have migrainous attacks with or without hemiplegic episodes. Neurological examination revealed slight muscle hypotonia, choreoathetosis and dystonic movements induced by locomotion, positive Myerson sign, increased deep tendon reflexes and Babinski reflex. CAG, VAG and CAT revealed normal findings. EEG revealed diffuse generalized slowing during hemiplegic episodes. Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) by 133Xe inhalation method revealed a slight decrease of bilateral CBF during a quadriplegic episode. Positron emission tomography using C15O2 revealed a slight decrease of CBF at the insula, putamen and claustrum of the left side during a right sided episode. Increased excretion of urinary 5-HIAA was seen during one episode. From our clinical and laboratory findings, we think this disorder may be a special type of migraine. Therapeutic trials of diazepam and flunarizine were both effective, but the initial effectiveness was decreased after 5 months.", 
    "82": "Two patients with panic disorder received therapeutic doses of antidepressants. They developed endogenomorphic symptoms of major depression according to DSM-III-R criteria despite remission of their panic attacks. Treatment-emergent depression in panic disorder has been previously associated with high potency benzodiazepines. Whether antidepressant medications may unmask a depressive diathesis or are coincidentally associated with depression is discussed in this report.", 
    "83": "Tetrahydroaminoacridine (THA) and a variety of other nonclassical antagonists of muscarine receptors were studied for their ability to bind to primary and allosteric sites on muscarine receptors in rabbit hippocampal membranes. Competition curves between 13 antagonists and 1 nM [3H]pirenzepine (Kd = 3 nM) were simple mass action curves, but THA produced steeper curves, indicating positive cooperativity. Nonetheless, THA inhibited the binding of low concentrations of [3H]pirenzepine, [3H]N-methylscopolamine, and [3H]oxotremorine-M to M1 receptors with similar IC50 values, indicating competition for primary sites. Antagonists were also compared for their ability to bind to allosteric sites and to slow the dissociation of [3H]pirenzepine from primary sites. THA was 6-8-fold more potent than verapamil, d-tubocurare, quinidine, and secoverine, the next most effective allosteric agents, and THA was more effective. McN-A-343, gallamine, pancuronium, and pirenzepine showed weaker allosteric effects. The large size and considerable rigidity of these compounds suggest large allosteric sites. The Hill coefficient for the allosteric effects of THA was 1.7, indicating more than one allosteric site. Solubilization of receptors did not alter steep inhibition curves between THA and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate or THA-induced slowing of the dissociation of this ligand. Hence, cooperative allosteric effects of THA are probably exerted on receptor monomers. Inhibition curves between THA and [3H]oxotremorine-M were not steep, and THA had no (allosteric) effect on the dissociation of this ligand from M1 or M2 receptors. Thus, the high affinity agonist conformation of muscarine receptors, once formed, may not bind THA readily. The present results indicate that compounds that can act allosterically may compete with acetylcholine for primary receptor sites but that allosteric effects of these drugs on muscarine receptors are not likely to be important clinically.", 
    "84": "Benzodiazepines are effective anticonvulsants, but long-term clinical usefulness is limited by development of tolerance. Tolerance to the actions of three prototype anticonvulsant benzodiazepines (BZDs)--diazepam (DZP), clonazepam (CZP), and clobazam (CLB)--was studied in amygdala-kindled rats. Fully kindled rats were dosed three times daily for 2 or 4 weeks. Amygdala stimulation was given 30 min after drug administration on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 of chronic treatment and then three times weekly. During treatment, tolerance was observed as a loss of drug effect to suppress behavioral and EEG manifestations of seizure activity. Seizure activity remained stable in rats treated with vehicle. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects developed most rapidly during CLB treatment and most slowly during CZP treatment. Tolerance to the motor impairment caused by the drugs developed more rapidly. Assay of the amount of drug in brain extracts, using a BZD receptor assay, showed that tolerance was functional, not metabolic. Doubling the dose did not readily restore full anticonvulsant activity. The response to amygdala stimulation 24 h after treatment was stopped showed no residual BZD effect, but there was a rebound in duration of some seizure measures in rats that had been treated with CLB or DZP. Retesting 48 h after treatment was stopped showed that rats were still tolerant. The amygdala-kindled rat is a reliable and sensitive model for studying long-term actions of anticonvulsant BZDs.", 
    "85": "The disposition parameters and placental transfer of diazepam were determined from blood and both plasma total and free concentration data in five women who had not undergone labor and who received diazepam (5 mg intravenously for 2 minutes) 1 1/2 to 3 hours before cesarean section at term. All patients exhibited smooth log plasma free concentration-time profiles. In contrast, marked increases in plasma total (approximate 50% increase) and blood (approximate 40% increase) diazepam concentrations occurred at delivery. The plasma total and blood concentration fluctuations were associated with reciprocal variations in diazepam percent free in plasma. For each patient there was a substantial increase in plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration during the surgical period. There was a significant correlation (p less than 0.02) between diazepam percent free and plasma NEFA concentration on the day of delivery, suggesting that the fluctuations in percent free, and hence plasma total and blood diazepam concentrations, were mediated in part by variations in plasma NEFA concentration. Disposition parameters were calculated for four of the patients; the mean free plasma clearance of diazepam was 42.5 ml/min/kg, similar to the mean value reported previously for nonpregnant women of comparable age. For each mother-infant pair at delivery the ratio of total plasma diazepam concentration in umbilical vein plasma to that in maternal vein plasma was considerably greater than unity (mean +/- SD = 1.73 +/- 0.47), whereas the corresponding ratio for free plasma diazepam concentration was near unity (0.92 +/- 0.09).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, clinical trial of atenolol compared with placebo in the outpatient management of patients with the alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In addition to receiving customary therapy, 88 patients were randomly assigned to receive atenolol and 92 to receive placebo. Outcome during the next 14 days was assessed using two main measures: the patient's clinical course as assessed by an alcohol withdrawal severity index; and the occurrence of treatment failure (composite measure including return to drinking, dropouts, and withdrawal lasting longer than 5 days). In addition, levels of craving for alcohol were assessed as an associated response variable. Overall, treatment failure occurred for 37% of the patients receiving atenolol and 52% of those receiving placebo. Among patients who had withdrawal symptoms at baseline, vital signs became normal more rapidly in the patients receiving atenolol, and their abnormal behavioral characteristics also resolved more rapidly. Levels of craving for alcohol were strongly associated with treatment failure; the group of patients who received atenolol included significantly fewer who reported high levels of craving 24 hours after treatment began (7% of patients receiving atenolol and 20% of those receiving placebo). We conclude that the outpatient management and treatment outcomes of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are improved in patients who receive atenolol, and that the beneficial effects are associated with reduced levels of craving for alcohol. If these results are confirmed by other investigators, atenolol may prove to play an important role in the outpatient management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome.", 
    "87": "Rats were exposed to high-dose intraperitoneal cocaine. Pretreatment with diazepam was found to be highly effective in reducing observed seizures from 90% to 0% and reducing the incidence of death from 85% to 10%. Furthermore, diazepam treatment after cocaine exposure was also effective in decreasing deaths, from 80% to 21%, even when given after the onset of seizures. Although diazepam pretreatment was shown to prevent clinically overt seizures, cortical EEGs in these rats demonstrated a continuum of convulsantlike electrical activity. Our study points to the protective effects of diazepam when given before or after cocaine exposure. Together, these data suggest that diazepam has significant efficacy against cocaine intoxication even though it does not totally suppress cocaine-induced cortical EEG seizure activity.", 
    "88": "The effects of intrathecal midazolam and fentanyl on electrical current threshold for pain were measured using stimulating electrodes in the neck and tail of rats with chronically implanted lumbar subarachnoid catheters. This involved the measurement of the minimum current (50 Hz 2 ms pulses 0-5 mA), which made the rat squeak when applied alternately to electrodes at each skin site. The responses measured in milliamperes were expressed as a number of times control readings. Equieffective doses of both midazolam and fentanyl produced a significant increase in electrical threshold for pain in the tail (mean +/- SEM 3.14 +/- 0.51 and 2.89 +/- 0.35: P less than 0.05; Wilcoxon sum rank test) in the absence of any change in the neck (mean +/- SEM 1.28 +/- 0.13 and 0.96 +/- 0.12, NS), thus demonstrating a spinal effect. Fentanyl caused a significant simultaneous increase in tail flick latency (mean +/- SEM 67.8 +/- 20.1%, P less than 0.05), but midazolam did not (mean +/- SEM 4.22 +/- 2.76%, NS). Intraperitoneal injections of naloxone (0.25 mg/kg) blocked the response to fentanyl in both tests and did not affect the response to midazolam. Intraperitoneal flumazenil (5 mg/kg) blocked the midazolam antinociceptive effect but did not affect the response to fentanyl in either test. Tail withdrawal in response to non-noxious stimulation was preserved in all animals with spinal analgesia, indicating that myelinated afferent and efferent pathways were still functioning. Righting reflex, coordination, motor power, and alertness were also preserved in the presence of both drugs. Both drugs caused spinally mediated antinociceptive effects that were qualitatively different.", 
    "89": "The feasibility of self-premedication with intravenous diazepam was examined in an open study of 50 preoperative patients. Using a Bard 'Harvard PCA' patient-controlled analgesia system, patients were instructed to deliver the drug in a dose sufficient to remove their anxiety for the scheduled surgical procedure. Aliquots of diazepam 2 mg were delivered on demand up to a total dose of 20 mg over a 30 minute premedication period. The mean dose administered was 8.1 mg (range 0-16 mg) producing a highly significant reduction in both patient- and anaesthetist-assessed anxiety rating. Neither the patient's sex nor the nature of the surgical procedure influenced the dose administered. Although poor, the best predictor of self-premedicating dose was patient's own preoperative anxiety rating with the anaesthetist's assessment of patient anxiety not correlating with the dose administered. No patient was considered excessively sedated by the premedication. Patient-administered anxiolysis is suggested as a useful research tool in the examination of anxiety and of value in premedicating patients with high preoperative anxiety levels.", 
    "90": "Recent studies have demonstrated that cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors are heterologous in peripheral tissues and in the central nervous system and that CCK-gastrin (CCK-G) peptides are potent trophic factors for the gastrointestinal tract. In the present study we used 125I-labeled gastrin and 125I-labeled CCK to demonstrate the heterogeneity of CCK receptors on a rat pancreatic acinar cell line (AR4-2J) and analyze the role of these receptors in increasing the activity of ornithine decarboxylase. Pharmacological analysis of radioligand binding fit well with the presence of two different receptors: 1) a CCK-selective receptor having the characteristics of the CCK receptor present on normal pancreatic cells and 2) a high-affinity, low-selectivity CCK-G binding site that interacts with all CCK-G peptides sulfated and nonsulfated. CCK-G peptides stimulate ornithine decarboxylase activity with the following order of potencies (EC50): G-(2-17)-ds (0.1 nM) greater than or equal to CCK-9 (0.25 nM) greater than or equal to pentagastrin (0.4 nM) greater than CCK-4 (6 nM). This stimulation was not inhibited by CCK antagonist (asperlicin) at a concentration range that blocks the CCK receptor but does not compete with 125I-labeled gastrin binding to the CCK-G receptor. These results, obtained with CCK-G agonists and antagonists, demonstrate that ornithine decarboxylase stimulation in these cells is mediated via the CCK-G receptor."
