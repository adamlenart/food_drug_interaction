    "0": "The effect of diazepam on thyroid function tests was examined in 12 euthyroid patients requiring the drug for psychiatric reasons and in six patients with thyrotoxicosis. Assessment was made before and after four weeks' therapy.There was no significant difference in results from tests of thyroid iodide trapping and binding (thyroid radioiodine uptake, thyroid clearance, and absolute iodine uptake) except in the one-hour thyroid uptake in the euthyroid group, which was increased after diazepam. This increase occurred without alteration in serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels. No change occurred in either group in tests of thyroid hormone release (protein-bound iodine, T-3 resin uptake, or Thyopac-3 and free thyroxine index).Patients with suspected thyroid disease who are taking diazepam do not need to stop therapy while their thyroid status is being determined.", 
    "1": "The characteristics, circumstances, and treatment of 450 pyrexial reactions occurring in 468 patient-months over a period of two and a half years, using a warm single-pass Kiil system, were studied. There is a wide variation in severity of symptoms and morbidity. The incidence of pyrexial reactions has an epidemic pattern within the hospital unit. Patients on dialysis at home have reactions much less often than patients in hospital.Blood cultures taken from patients during each of the 450 reactions showed a growth on 38 occasions, but this was not significantly different from the incidence of positive cultures taken simultaneously from control patients during haemodialysis. Reactions were not correlated with bacterial growth from the blood compartment of the kidney before dialysis. There was no difference in incidence of reactions when using different types of equipment which were either a central tank distribution system with bedside monitors or chemically- or heat-sterilized individual proportioning pump systems. Reactions were also noted with the disposable coil kidney and recirculating single-pass (R.S.P.) system, but presented different features from those of the Kiil kidney.The incidence of reactions was not related to the albuminoid nitrogen content of the water supply. Reactions were not abolished by deionization of the tap-water.", 
    "2": "An oscillating decerebrate tonicity following the clonus phase in electroplexy was found to occur in the upper limbs, their tendon reflexes and the jaw; this increased with each expiration and decreased with inspiration. The times of these occurrences in the upper limbs were measured in groups where no anaesthesia, diazepam or methohexital were used. The mean times of their onset and end were related to other phenomena of ECT. The times of occurrence and duration of decerebrate tonicity were established and compared in the three cohorts. There was a definite relationship to the onset of respiratory rhythmicity in all three groups. The evidence for the existence of decerebrate tonicity and atonicity are discussed from experimental contributions and more recent clinical evidence of the clonus phase as an example of an oscillation between tonic and atonic decerebrate states. Further clinical and experimental data are discussed which show connections between the decerebrate state, cerebral and cerebellar functions, respiratory centres, brain-stem and gravity afferents during rest and locomotion. An explanation is offered that the oscillatory phenomena are probably a mechanism to aid respiration and motor efficiency."
