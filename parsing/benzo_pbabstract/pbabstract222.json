Only midazolam and Ro 5-4864 led to significant changes in the dynamic PMN free amino- and alpha-keto acid pools. Concerning PMN immune function markers, midazolam and Ro 5-4864 significantly decreased O(2)(-) and H(2)O(2) formation and released MPO. When midazolam and Ro 5-4864 were applied together they appeared to act additively. Pre-incubation with PK 11195 partially neutralized the midazolam effects whereas flumazenil or naloxone showed no effects. We therefore believe that pBR are involved in the signal transmission of anesthetic-induced cellular metabolic changes in PMN.", 
    "1": "Anxiety disorders may result from an overexpression of aversive memories. Evidence suggests that the hippocampal cholinergic system could be the point of convergence of anxiety and memory. We propose that clinically effective anxiolytics may exert their effect by interfering with this integration mechanism. To assess anxiety and aversive memory, we used the shock-probe burying test. A reduction in anxiety in this test is indicated by decreased burying, whereas impaired cognition is reflected by an increased number of probe-contacts and/or reduced retention latency. Both an aversive stimulus and the memory of that stimulus significantly increased hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) levels (Experiment 1). In fact, the memory of the event seemed to be more important than the event itself since the aversive memory induced a greater increase in hippocampal ACh. Injections (i.p.) of fluoxetine (Prozac) reduced burying behavior, while not affecting probe contacts or retention latency (Experiment 2). Although injections of fluoxetine did not affect basal hippocampal ACh efflux (Experiment 3), fluoxetine abolished the increase in ACh induced by the aversive stimulus and the memory of that stimulus (Experiment 4), emphasizing the significance of aversive memories in anxiety disorders. These actions may be mediated by a decrease in the event-related enhancement in cholinergic neurotransmission through M1 cholinergic receptors (Experiment 5). Therefore, anxiety disorders may stem from an unopposed formation of aversive memories and clinically effective anxiolytics hinder the association between emotional and cognitive processing. This reduces the emotional impact of aversive memories, thereby opposing consequent anxiety.", 
    "2": "Recent experiments from our laboratory have demonstrated that drug states can signal when environmental cues will be followed by rewarding outcomes (ie Pavlovian conditioning). However, little is known about the generality of this approach and whether it can be used for studying the pharmacological properties of drug states. Accordingly, the present experiments tested the pharmacological specificity of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg), amphetamine (1 mg/kg), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) in this Pavlovian drug discrimination procedure. Following drug administration, presentation of a conditional stimulus (CS) was followed by brief access to sucrose. When saline was administered, the same CS was presented but sucrose was withheld. In substitution tests, rats in each condition received varying doses of all training drugs and caffeine. Anticipatory food seeking developed during the CS on drug sessions but not on saline sessions for all drug features (ie drug state-specific conditional response (CR)). In generalization tests, this CR decreased as a function of decreases in the training dose. Median effective doses (ED50s) were calculated for nicotine (0.054 mg/kg), amphetamine (0.26 mg/kg), and CDP (2.48 mg/kg). No compound tested substituted for the CDP training drug. Partial substitution was evident between nicotine and amphetamine; CDP did not substitute for either of these drug features. Caffeine fully substituted for nicotine (ED50 = 15.45 mg/kg) and amphetamine (ED50 = 3.70 mg/kg), but not for CDP. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that drug states can occasion appetitive Pavlovian CRs in a pharmacologically specific manner.", 
    "3": "The main objective of this study was to compare 1-year outcome on symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) , positive and negative symptoms, and domains of cognition in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients. Drug-naive FEP patients, who were similar on a number of characteristics likely to affect outcome, were treated with only one antipsychotic (risperidone or olanzapine) for at least 1 year and compared at baseline and after 1 year of treatment. Differences in outcome were assessed using an analysis of co-variance with change scores between initial assessment and after 1 year of treatment on levels of psychotic, disorganization and psychomotor poverty symptoms, EPS (parkinsonism, akathesia and dyskineisa) and domains of cognition as the dependent variable, respective baseline scores as covariates, and drug group as the independent variable. While patients in both groups showed substantial improvement, there were no significant differences in the magnitude of change in reality distortion, disorganization and psychomotor poverty symptoms. Trends in change in EPS favouring olanzapine and on some domains of cognition (processing speed and executive functions) favouring risperidone failed to reach statistical significance. The failure to confirm previous claims of greater improvement on either risperidone or olanzapine in patients with a first episode of psychosis may be the result of methodological bias introduced by unequal dosing between the two drugs or the use of chronically ill and treatment-refractory patients in previous studies.", 
    "4": "Fifty clinically stable, schizophrenic outpatients, suffering from residual schizophrenic symptoms and/or neurological side effects, were randomised to either continue their conventional neuroleptic(s) or change it to olanzapine. After 12 weeks patients on olanzapine exhibited significant improvement in neurological side effects and psychotic symptomatology as compared to patients on conventional antipsychotics.", 
    "5": "HG1 is a new 5-HT-moduline antagonist which is itself an endogenous tetrapeptide specifically acting as an antagonist of 5-HT(1B) auto- and heteroreceptors. Blockade of endogenous 5-HT-moduline might provoke anxiolysis, so it could be a new therapeutic target in anxiety disorders. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of HG1 in three mouse models of anxiety: the four plates test (FPT), the black and white (B&W) model and the elevated plus maze (EPM). Male Swiss mice were intraperitoneally and acutely administered HG1 at the doses of 8, 16, 32 and 64 mg/kg. In these three tests, HG1 exhibited an anxiolytic profile similar to that of diazepam, the referential benzodiazepine compound, without affecting locomotor activity. In the three models used, HG1 was as efficient as benzodiazepine and may consequently exert its anxiolytic effects via the GABA-ergic system. We cannot exclude that it might also act through 5-HT receptors and rather have the profile of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor.", 
    "6": "Frequency of adverse reactions (ARs) related with antipsychotics usage is high. Along with clinical implications, economic impact might be important. The purpose of this study was to model the economic consequences of ARs related with ziprasidone, olanzapine, risperidone, and haloperidol in Spain, by means of a cost-effectiveness model developed using a Markov modeling approach. The model simulated treatment of a cohort of 1000 schizophrenics for 12 months, initiating treatment with one of four antipsychotic drugs; haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone. Conditional probabilities of developing any of four adverse events were calculated. Treatment was modified (decrease dose, switch medication) according to incidence of ARs and physician judgments, obtained from a local cross-sectional study and clinical trials previously published. The analysis was conducted in year 2002 from a third party payer perspective. Results are shown as annual cost per month with psychotic symptoms controlled and included univariate sensitivity analysis. The therapeutic strategy starting with ziprasidone showed the lower costs and the greater number of months with symptoms controlled in most scenarios evaluated versus the other options considered, although the differences were weak: 9.6, 9.3, 9.5 and 9.5 controlled months per patient in base scenario, with annual cost per patient per month with symptoms controlled of 1035 Euros, 1084 Euros, 1087 Euros and 1090 Euros for ziprasidone, haloperidol, risperidone and olanzapine, respectively. Results were robust to one-way sensitivity analysis. Despite the unlike drug prices of antipsychotics, a considerable economic impact due to adverse reactions was seen in our setting. These results should be taken into account by health decision makers and clinicians in the management of patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "7": "Previously, it was shown that subchronic application of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (Ket) induces schizophrenia-related alterations, e.g. decreased non-aggressive behaviour in the social interaction test, which might be a useful animal model in the study of negative symptoms of this disease. In order to further evaluate the predictive validity of this model, the anxioloytic diazepam, the classic neuroleptic haloperidol and the atypical neuroleptics clozapine and risperidone were tested after acute and subchronic treatment. The experiments demonstrated that haloperidol did not normalise the behavioural effects of Ket. After acute administration, diazepam was ineffective in control animals but increased non-aggressive behaviour in Ket-treated animals. Similar effects were found in animals injected with either clozapine or risperidone. Twenty-four hours after discontinuation of subchronic treatment with both substances, there was an increase in the percentage of non-aggressive behaviour in the ketamine group and a decrease in the control animals. This decrease was explained in terms of withdrawal. Different effects in the control groups and the Ket groups were found when the test was performed 1 h after subchronic clozapine or risperidone treatment. The data suggest that atypical antipsychotic drugs (APD) effectively counteract Ket-induced alterations in social behaviour. Regarding false-positive effects by anxiolytic drugs without antipsychotic efficacy, this model may have some predictive validity for identifying anxiolytic effects of novel antipsychotic compounds.", 
    "8": "The effect of funding source on the outcome of randomized controlled trials has been investigated in several medical disciplines; however, psychiatry has been largely excluded from such analyses. In this article, randomized controlled trials of second generation antipsychotics in schizophrenia are reviewed and analyzed with respect to funding source (industry vs. non-industry funding).", 
    "9": "A literature search was conducted for randomized, double-blind trials in which at least one of the tested treatments was a second generation antipsychotic. In each study, design quality and study outcome were assessed quantitatively according to rating scales. Mean quality and outcome scores were compared in the industry-funded studies and non-industry-funded studies. An analysis of the primary author's affiliation with industry was similarly performed.", 
    "10": "Results of industry-funded studies significantly favored second generation over first generation antipsychotics when compared to non-industry-funded studies. Non-industry-funded studies showed a trend toward higher quality than industry-funded studies; however, the difference between the two was not significant. Also, within the industry-funded studies, outcomes of trials involving first authors employed by industry sponsors demonstrated a trend toward second generation over first generation antipsychotics to a greater degree than did trials involving first authors employed outside the industry (p=0.05).", 
    "11": "While the retrospective design of the study limits the strength of the findings, the data suggest that industry bias may occur in randomized controlled trials in schizophrenia.

    "12": "This is the first study of hypnotic activity of tetrandrine (a major component of Stephania tetrandrae) in mice by using synergism with pentobarbital as an index for the hypnotic effect. The results showed that tetrandrine potentiated pentobarbital (45 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced hypnosis significantly by reducing sleep latency and increasing sleeping time in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was potentiated by 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). In the subhypnotic dosage of pentobarbital (28 mg/kg, i.p.)-treated mice, tetrandrine (60 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly increased the rate of sleep onset and also showed synergic effect with 5-HTP. Pretreatment of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 300 mg/kg, s.c.), an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, significantly decreased pentobarbital-induced sleeping time and tetrandrine abolished this effect. From these results, it should be presumed that serotonergic system may be involved in the augmentative effect of tetrandrine on pentobarbital-induced sleep.", 
    "13": "Baicalein may act on the benzodiazepine binding sites to exert an anxiolytic-like effect in mice. Since many benzodiazepine drugs have amnesic side-effect and baicalein can protect cultured cortical neurons from beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced toxicity, this study examined the amnesic effect of baicalein and its effects on beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35) (3 nmol/mouse, i.c.v.)-induced amnesia in mice. Using the step-through passive avoidance test, the results showed that baicalein (10-100 mg/kg, i.p.), unlike the benzodiazepine drug chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg, i.p.), had no significant amnesic effect. Baicalein (10-50 mg/kg, i.p.) also had no facilitating effect on the learning and memory. However, one dosage pretreatment, but not post-treatment, of baicalein (5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. Interestingly, post-treatment for 7 or 13 days of baicalein (10-15 mg/kg/day, i.p.), like melatonin (10 mg/kg/day, i.p.), also attenuated beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia. Therefore, this study demonstrated that baicalein has protective effect on beta-amyloid peptide-(25-35)-induced amnesia.",

Despite this, more than 10 million prescriptions for hypnotics continue to be dispensed each year in England alone, mostly for benzodiazepines and drugs with similar actions such as zaleplon, zolpidem and zopiclone (so called 'Z-drugs'). Around 80% of all such prescriptions are for people aged 65 years or over, and many patients remain on the drugs for months or years. Such prescribing carries many potential hazards for patients, including risk of dependence, accidents and other adverse effects on health. Here we review how the risks from hypnotic drugs can be minimised.",

    "22": "There was no statistical difference for overall behavior (F3,27 = 0.407; P = .749). The planned contrasts showed significant interactions between time and route (IN vs PO) between 25 and 30 minutes after starting sedation. The time of onset (P = .000) and the working time (P = .007) were significantly different between IN and PO midazolam. There were no statistically significant differences in vital signs (O2 sat, HR, RR, BP) between PO and IN (P = .595). IN subjects showed more movement and less sleep toward the end of the dental procedures, and faster onset time but shorter working time than PO. Vital signs were stable throughout the procedures with no significant differences.",

All vital signs were stable throughout the procedures and showed no significant differences between PO and IN administration.", 
    "24": "Adoption of standard input function (SIF) has been proposed for kinetic analysis of receptor binding potential (BP), instead of invasive frequent arterial samplings. The purpose of this study was to assess the SIF method in quantitative analysis of [123I]iomazenil (IMZ), a central benzodiazepine antagonist, for SPECT. SPECT studies were performed on 10 patients with cerebrovascular disease or Alzheimer disease. Intermittent dynamic SPECT scans were performed from 0 to 201 min after IMZ-injection. BPs calculated from SIFs obtained from normal volunteers (BPs) were compared with those of individual arterial samplings (BPo). Good correlations were shown between BP(o)s and BP(s)s in the 9 subjects, but maximum BP(s)s were four times larger than the corresponding BP(o)s in one case. There were no abnormal laboratory data in this patient, but the relative arterial input count in the late period was higher than the SIF. Simulation studies with modified input functions revealed that height in the late period can produce significant errors in estimated BPs. These results suggested that the simplified method with one-point arterial sampling and SIF can not be applied clinically. One additional arterial sampling in the late period may be useful.", 
    "25": "In the present study, individual differences in spatial memory in aged Fischer 344 (F344) rats were associated with the extent of G-protein coupling of the M1 muscarinic receptor and the dendritic-to-somal ratio of hippocampal PKCgamma (d/sPKCgamma) immunogenicity. Following testing in the eight-arm radial maze task, 7 young and 13 aged rat brains were sectioned through the dorsal hippocampal formation (HF). G-protein coupling of the M1 receptor was assessed autoradiographically using competition binding studies in the presence and absence of a G-protein uncoupler to determine high (K(H)) and low (K(L)) affinity states for agonist in the HF, neocortex, and amygdala. In aged animals, a relationship between choice accuracy in the maze and K(H), a measure of M1 receptor-G-protein coupling was seen in the dentate gyrus, CA3, CA1, and neocortex. Furthermore, choice accuracy and d/sPKCgamma immunogenicity showed a significant relationship in CA1. Lastly, a correlation was seen in the CA1 of aged animals between K(H) and d/sPKCgamma. These relationships did not hold for the amygdala. Thus, individual differences in a naturally occurring age-dependent disruption of cholinergic-PKCgamma signal transduction is associated with spatial memory dysfunction.",

    "27": "The effects of the physical properties (viscosity, surface tension, fluid density) of fluids and the angle of a dropper upon the accuracy and precision of dispensing were investigated under standard laboratory conditions. Dose delivery was then assessed using a number of volunteers who were either given no instructions on the use of containers or were instructed to hold the droppers vertically.", 
    "28": "Viscosity, surface tension, fluid density and residual volume had little or no effect upon the volume of liquid delivered by a dropper clamped in the vertical position. However, when the angle of the dropper was moved towards 45 degrees from the vertical, the volume dispensed declined and became more variable to a point where the requirements of the European Pharmacopoeia were no longer fulfilled. This finding applied to a variety of products. When volunteers used the same droppers manually, the mean volumes dispensed were lower than when the droppers were vertically clamped and the variability was greater. It appeared that these problems were associated with volunteers failing to hold the dropper vertically and the precision and accuracy were indeed increased if the volunteers were instructed as to how the dropper should be held. The results from volunteers were more precise and accurate with the most viscous of the fluids tested and it was speculated that this may have been because the volunteers could more easily use the droppers vertically as there was less fear of dispensing too many drops.", 
    "29": "The key factor in achieving satisfactory dispensing from droppers is to ensure that the dropper is held vertically and this should form the basis of instructions to patients. Formulators should consider increasing the viscosity of prepared dropper solutions to reduce further errors in dose.", 
    "30": "The study was undertaken to examine the ratio of mental to somatic disorders in patients with autonomic sinus nodal dysfunction (ASND) and the capacities of correction of revealed disorders with the atypical benzodiazepine drug clonazepam. Thirty-two patients with ASND were examined. The diagnosis of ASND was verified by 24-hour ECG monitoring and transesophageal atrial pacing, by performing autonomic cardiac block with atropine and obsidan. In addition to physical examination, heart rhythm variability was studied during relaxed and intensive wake; psychological studies using the conventional tests were conducted, and autonomic disorders were explored by means of original scored somatic, hyperventilation) questionnaires. After examination, the patients received a 1.5-to-2-month course of therapy with clonazepam in a daily dose of 1.5-2 mg. The study has revealed that clinical symptomatology in ASND is greatly determined by psychosomatic disorders. ASND was marked by anxious depressions in combination with inadequate peripheral (to a greater extent, sympathetic) neurovegetative exposures with the simultaneous activation of cerebral ergotropic effects. The use of clonazepam in ASND greatly improved its clinical picture, by eliminating, in the overwhelming majority of cases, clinical symptoms, including rhythm and conduction disturbances that are characteristic of ASND.",

We investigated whether conscious sedation using a low dose of intravenous midazoram was safe and useful during the examination.", 
    "35": "We asked 55 consecutive patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography (44 with midazoram, mean age 59 +/- 16 years, and 11 without midazoram, mean age 62 +/- 8 years) and the examiners about the effects of midazoram using a questionnaire.", 
    "36": "The mean dose of midazoram was 2.2 mg (range 1-3.5 mg). All examinations were done without any adverse events. Eighty-two percent of the patients with midazoram considered the examination under conscious sedation tolerable, whereas 91% without midazoram felt it untolerable. Most examiners felt manipulation of the echo probe was easier in patients with midazoram than in those without (69% vs 27%).",

    "38": "The acute effect of Ambrosia paniculata was studied in several animal models of epilepsy. Intraperitoneal injections (0.01 mL/g body wt) of a decoction of the dry leaves significantly enhanced the latency to the first convulsion and survival time in mice injected with picrotoxin (7 mg/kg) or isoniazid (210 mg/kg). Epileptic spikes were induced by topical application of penicillin through a glass electrode filled with a penicillin-agar-saline mixture and recorded in sensorimotor and occipital cortices, in rats immobilized with d-tubocurarine. The plant decoction reduced significantly the spike amplitude in both sites. The mentioned effects were elicited at doses that also reduced general motor activity (Irwin test) and exploratory behavior. The decoctions were not effective against electroshock-induced convulsions in mice. The convulsions induced by isoniazid, picrotoxin, and penicillin differed from those induced by electroshock implicating selective disruption of GABAergic neurotransmission. The results suggest that A. paniculata, like several conventional antiepileptic drugs, might act by enhancing GABAergic neurotransmission, a hypothesis that requires further demonstration. These results explain and justify the traditional use of the plant in epilepsy.", 
    "39": "Melatonin, a primary secretory product of pineal gland, is known to produce many of its pharmacological actions via benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA)ergic mechanisms. Recently, we showed that benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms play an important role in U-50,488H (U50) analgesia and its tolerance. Hence, in the present study, the effect of melatonin on U50 analgesia and its tolerance was investigated. Furthermore, the possible role of benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms in the actions of melatonin on U50 analgesia was investigated. All experiments were performed using the radiant tail-flick test for mice. Melatonin [0.2, 1 and 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.)] neither produced analgesia nor affected the acute U50 (40 mg/kg, i.p.) analgesia. Tolerance to U50 analgesia was induced by administering U50 (40 mg/kg, i.p.) twice daily over 6 days. Treatment with melatonin (1 and 5 mg/kg, i.p) 15 min prior to each dose of U50 inhibited the development of tolerance, whereas a low dose of melatonin (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.) did not. The inhibition of U50 tolerance by melatonin was reversed by the chronic treatment with flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), a GABAA-gated chloride channel blocker. Flumazenil and picrotoxin neither affected tail-flick latencies nor altered acute U50 analgesia and its tolerance. Interestingly, chronic 6-day melatonin treatment in a vehicle (U50-naive) group did not alter U50 analgesia measured on day 7. Together, these findings suggest that melatonin interferes with the neural mechanisms involved in the development of tolerance to U50 analgesia. The inhibition of U50 tolerance by melatonin was reversed by flumazenil and picrotoxin treatment, suggesting that benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms play an important role in the development of tolerance to U50 analgesia and that melatonin inhibits the development of U50 tolerance via benzodiazepine-GABAAergic mechanisms.", 
    "40": "Sex steroids exert pleiotropic effects in the nervous system, preserving neural function and promoting neuronal survival. Therefore, the age-related decrease in sex steroids may have a negative impact on neural function. Progesterone, testosterone and estradiol prevent neuronal loss in the central nervous system in different experimental animal models of neurodegeneration. Furthermore, progesterone and its reduced derivatives dihydroprogesterone and tetrahydroprogesterone reduce aging-associated morphological abnormalities of myelin and aging-associated myelin fiber loss in rat peripheral nerves. However, the results from hormone replacement studies in humans are thus far inconclusive. A possible alternative to hormonal replacement therapy is to increase local steroidogenesis by neural tissues, which express enzymes for steroid synthesis and metabolism. Proteins involved in the intramitochondrial trafficking of cholesterol, the first step in steroidogenesis, such as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, are up-regulated in the nervous system after injury. Furthermore, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein expression is increased in the brain of 24-month-old rats compared with young adult rats. This suggests that brain steroidogenesis may be modified in adaptation to neurodegenerative conditions and to the brain aging process. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that local formation of estradiol in the brain, by the enzyme aromatase, is neuroprotective. Therefore, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor and aromatase are attractive pharmacological targets to promote neuroprotection in the aged brain.", 
    "41": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine which binds to certain benzodiazepine receptor types with varying degrees of affinity. The effect of zolpidem on successive negative contrast was investigated in three experiments. In each experiment, a contrast group was given brief access to 32% sucrose for 10 days, then shifted to 4% sucrose for 2 days; a procedure that elicits anxiety primarily on the second postshift day. One control group was given only 4% sucrose. Experiments 2 and 3 included a 2% sucrose group as an intake rate-dependent control. In Experiment 1, zolpidem (4.0 and 0.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced contrast on the two postshift days. Contrast occurred during the first postshift consummatory burst. Zolpidem prolonged the first postshift burst equally in both shifted and unshifted groups, suggesting a general facilitation of intake masked by a ceiling effect in controls. In Experiment 2, zolpidem's (4.0 mg/kg) anti-contrast action was equivalent to its hyperphagic effect in the 2% control group. Zolpidem prolonged the first postshift burst equally in all three groups, again consistent with general intake facilitation. In Experiment 3, 8.0 mg/kg zolpidem produced an anti-contrast effect not present in 2% controls on both postshift days. This does not appear attributable to anxiolysis, however, as the effect was equivalent during stressful and non-stressful phases of the postshift period, and zolpidem extended the duration of the first postshift burst equally in all three sucrose groups. Thus, unlike benzodiazepines, zolpidem is not anxiolytic in this paradigm.", 
    "42": "The Michaelis-Menten model, and the existence of a single active site for the interaction of substrate with drug metabolizing enzyme, adequately describes a substantial number of in vitro metabolite kinetic data sets for both clearance and inhibition determination. However, in an increasing number of cases (involving most notably, but not exclusively, CYP3A4), atypical kinetic features are observed, e.g., auto- and heteroactivation; partial, cooperative, and substrate inhibition; concentration-dependent effector responses (activation/inhibition); limited substrate substitution and inhibitory reciprocity necessitating sub-group classification. The phenomena listed above cannot be readily interpreted using single active site models and the literature indicates that three types of approaches have been adopted. First the 'nai ve' approach of using the Michaelis-Menten model regardless of the kinetic behaviour, second the 'empirical' approach (e.g., employing the Hill or uncompetitive inhibition equations to model homotropic phenomena of sigmoidicity and substrate inhibition, respectively) and finally, the 'mechanistic' approach. The later includes multisite kinetic models derived using the same rapid equilibrium/steady-state assumptions as the single-site model. These models indicate that 2 or 3 binding sites exist for a given CYP3A4 substrate and/or effector. Multisite kinetic models share common features, depending on the substrate kinetics and the nature of the effector response observed in vitro, which allow a generic model to be proposed. Thus although more complex than the other two approaches, they show more utility and can be comprehensively applied in relatively simple versions that can be readily generated from generic model. Multisite kinetic features, observed in isolated hepatocytes as well as in microsomes from hepatic tissue and heterologous expression systems, may be evident in substrate depletion-time profiles as well as in metabolite formation rates. Failure to adequately account for multisite kinetic phenomena will compromise any attempts to predict human drug clearance and drug-drug interaction potential from in vitro data.", 
    "43": "The release of [3H]dopamine was measured in rat corticostriatal slice preparations that contained the striatum and the adjacent prefrontal cortex to maintained glutamatergic corticostriatal afferentation. These slices were prepared from either nontreated or 6-hydroxydopamine-pretreated rats. The slices were loaded with [3H]dopamine, submerged in a two-compartment bath so that the cortical region was contained in one compartment, the corpus callosum was passed through a silicone greased slot, and the striatal region was contained in the other compartment. The cortical and the striatal parts were superfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer independently. The release of [3H]dopamine was determined from the striatal part at rest and in response to electrical stimulation of the cortical area. Electrical stimulation of the cortical part increased the release of [3H]dopamine from the striatal part of the slices, and this release was found to be higher after lesion of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway with 6-hydroxydopamine. Cortically evoked [3H]dopamine release was even higher in the presence of the dopamine precursor L-DOPA after 6-hydroxdopamine lesion. Perfusion of GYKI-53405, a noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist, in combination with L-DOPA further increased both basal and stimulation-evoked [3H]dopamine release, whereas GYKI-53405 by itself did not influence basal [3H]dopamine outflow from striatum. These findings indicate that, in parkinsonian striatum, the stimulatory effect of L-DOPA on dopamine release is potentiated by AMPA receptor blockade, and the antiparkinsonian effect of GYKI-53405 may be due to its L-DOPA sparing effect.", 
    "44": "Several lines of evidence support the role of an epigenetic-induced GABAergic cortical dysfunction in schizophrenia psychopathology, which is probably dependent on an increase in the expression of DNA-methyltransferase-1 occurring selectively in GABAergic neurons. The key enzyme regulating GABA synthesis, termed glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) and the important neurodevelopmental protein called reelin are coexpressed in GABAergic neurons. Upon release, GABA and reelin bind to postsynaptic receptors located in dendrites, somata, or the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons. Because GAD67 and reelin are downregulated in schizophrenia, it is suggested that schizophrenics may express GABAergic deficit-related alterations of pyramidal neuron function. A reduction of dendritic spines is a finding reported in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients. Because dendritic spines are innervated by glutamatergic axon terminals, very probably this reduction of dendritic spine expression is translated into a functional deficit of glutamatergic transmission. Plastic modifications of neuronal circuits are probably dependent on GABAergic transmitter tone, and it is likely that GABAergic dysfunction is at the root of synaptic plasticity deficits in schizophrenia. Thus, a possible avenue for the treatment of schizophrenia would be to address this GABAergic functional deficit using positive allosteric modulators of the action of GABA at GABAA receptors. Benzodiazepines (BZ) such as diazepam are effective in treating positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, but because they positively modulate GABAA receptors expressing alpha1 subunits, these BZs cause sedation and tolerance. In contrast, imidazenil, a full allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors expressing alpha5 subunits may reduce psychotic symptomatology without producing sedation. Hence, imidazenil should be appropriately studied as a prospective candidate for a pharmacological intervention in schizophrenia.", 
    "45": "Fast excitatory transmission in the nervous system is mostly mediated by alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors whose subunit composition governs physiological characteristics such as ligand affinity and ion conductance properties. Here, we report that AMPA receptors at inner hair cell (IHC) synapses lack the GluR2 subunit and are transiently Ca2+-permeable before hearing onset as evidenced using agonist-induced Co2+ accumulation, Western blots and GluR2 confocal microscopy in the rat cochlea. AMPA (100 microM) induced Co2+ accumulation in primary auditory neurons until postnatal day (PND) 10. This accumulation was concentration-dependent, strengthened by cyclothiazide (50 microM) and blocked by GYKI 52466 (80 microM) and Joro spider toxin (1 microM). It was unaffected by D-AP5 (50 microM), and it could not be elicited by 56 mM K+ or 1 mM NMDA + 10 microM glycine. Western blots showed that GluR1 immunoreactivity, present in homogenates of immature cochleas, had disappeared by PND12. GluR2 immunoreactivity was not detected until PND10 and GluR3 and GluR4 immunoreactivities were detected at all the ages examined. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the GluR2 immunofluorescence was not located postsynaptically to IHCs before PND10. In conclusion, AMPA receptors on maturing primary auditory neurons differ from those on adult neurons. They are probably composed of GluR1, GluR3 and GluR4 subunits and have a high Ca2+ permeability. The postsynaptic expression of GluR2 subunits may be continuously regulated by the presynaptic activity allowing for variations in the Ca2+ permeability and physiological properties of the receptor.", 
    "46": "The pharmacokinetics of L-838417, a GABAA receptor subtype selective benzodiazepine site agonist, were studied in rats and mice after single oral (p.o.), intraperitoneal (i.p.) and intravenous (i.v.) doses. In both species L-838417 was well absorbed following i.p. administration and whilst in rats p.o. bioavailability was good (41%), in mice it was negligible (<1%), precluding this as a route of administration for mouse behavioural studies. Despite having a similar volume of distribution (ca 1.4 l/kg) in rats and mice, L-838417 was cleared at twice liver blood flow in mice (161 ml/min/kg) and moderately cleared in rats (24 ml/min/kg), potentially explaining the poor oral bioavailability in mice. Finally, as a pharmacodynamic readout the benzodiazepine binding site occupancy was determined in rats (0.3-3 mg/kg, p.o.) and mice (1-30 mg/kg, i.p.) using a [3H]Ro 15-1788 in vivo binding assay. Although the resulting dose-occupancy relationship for both species demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in receptor occupancy, appreciable variability was observed at low dose levels, potentially making interpretation of behavioural responses difficult. In contrast, a clear relationship between plasma and brain concentrations and receptor occupancy were determined suggesting the observed dose-occupancy variability is a consequence of the pharmacokinetic properties of L-838417. The plasma and brain concentrations required to occupy 50% of the benzodiazepine binding sites were similar in both rats (28 ng/ml and 33 ng/ml g, respectively) and mice (63 ng/ml and 53 ng/ml g, respectively), with a non-linear concentration response observed with increasing doses of L-838417. These studies demonstrate the importance of utilizing pharmacokinetic/receptor occupancy data when interpreting pharmacodynamic responses at a given dose.",

Although a decreasing clinical level of sedation after rewarming was not associated with a significant change in Nb latency (61 ms [42-78 ms]), the MLAEP NaPa amplitude increased from 0.9 muV (0.4-1.6 microV) to 1.3 muV (0.8-3.9 microV; p = 0.01).

The ERN is an event-related potential (ERP) elicited immediately after an erroneous response and is thought to originate in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Although the ACC has a central role in the brain, only a few studies have been performed to investigate directly the effects of drugs on action monitoring. A recent theory argues that the mesencephalic dopamine system carries an error signal to the ACC, where it generates the ERN.", 
    "55": "ERPs and behavioral measurements were obtained from 12 healthy volunteers performing an Eriksen Flankers task.

    "57": "Administration of amphetamine leads to stimulated action monitoring, reflected in increased ERN amplitudes. This result provides evidence for dopaminergic involvement in action monitoring and is in line with differences in ERN amplitude found in neuropsychiatric disorders also suggesting dopaminergic involvement. The different effects for lorazepam and mirtazapine are probably caused by the neurobiological characteristics of these two types of sedation. Action monitoring is suppressed after administration of lorazepam, because the GABAergic pathways directly inhibit ACC functioning, whereas the histaminergic pathways of mirtazapine do not innervate the ACC directly.", 
    "58": "In a group of elderly patients over 65 years of age with at least two cardiovascular diagnoses requiring chronic medication (n=424), drug therapy at hospital discharge and at home thereafter was followed for a 1-year period. Two home visits took place at 3 months and 12 months after initial discharge. A median of six prescriptions had already been given at the time of discharge; this number increased slightly during ambulatory follow-up. After 1 year, about 30% of the patients had to take more than ten dosing units per day. After discharge, about 50% of all prescriptions were subject to changes in the choice of the preparation (brand-generic) or the agent used [within a class of similar agents, e.g. angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACIs)]. The prescription of some problematic agents (benzodiazepines, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents) increased during the ambulatory follow-up, but pivotal medications for cardiovascular indications (e.g., ACI) given at discharge were maintained. Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs-which were not part of the discharge medication-contributed to 12% of all drugs taken at V4. The majority of the prescriptions (95% of about 2,000 prescriptions surveyed at each visit) was in agreement with the drug's approval status and was appropriate in terms of absence of contraindications. At home visits, therapy with ACI or beta-blocking agents was in agreement with clinical guidelines, although under-dosing was obvious. Blood pressure control (<140/90 mmHg) was achieved in 61% of the patients at discharge and deteriorated to 45% after 1 year; international normalized ratio control in patients with oral anticoagulation also declined (control rate 57% at discharge, 46% after 1 year). Statins as secondary prevention were given at discharge in only 60% of suitable patients, declining to about 50% in ambulatory visits. Diabetic control was not present in 35% of the patients at discharge or at home. Properties of or reason for their medication could be given for the majority (70-80%) of the prescriptions; these quotations were, however, cursory and almost nothing was known about medication risks. At home visits, non-compliance was admitted for approximately 8% of the prescriptions. In conclusion, for pivotal indications, family doctors widely followed the discharge recommendations, but deficits in ambulatory prescriptions and poor performance of the medication were in part already employed at the time of discharge from the hospital. The lack of a patient's knowledge about their own medication is precarious.", 
    "59": "Combined serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) and dopamine-2 (D2) receptor blockade has been proposed as a candidate mechanism by which second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) improve both cognition and negative symptoms in schizophrenic patients, in contrast to antipsychotics of the first generation. The SGA amisulpride, however, only binds to D2/D3 receptors, which makes it an interesting tool to test this assumption. In a randomized controlled trial, 52 schizophrenic patients were allocated to treatment with either olanzapine (10-20 mg/day) or amisulpride (400-800 mg/day). A comprehensive neuropsychological test battery and clinical ratings were used to assess participants at inclusion and after 4 and 8 weeks. Cognitive improvements of moderate size were observed, with effect sizes similar to those obtained in previous studies on the cognitive effects of SGAs. Importantly, amisulpride was not inferior to olanzapine for any cognitive domain. Combined 5-HT(2A)/D2 receptor blockade is probably not necessary for cognitive improvement by SGAs.",

    "64": "Three-choice discrimination procedures are used to characterize how similar the discriminative stimulus effects of two drugs are in relation to each other. This procedure has suggested similarities between ethanol and ligands that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex. As an extension to these studies, male Long-Evans rats were trained to discriminate midazolam (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) from ethanol (1.0 g/kg, i.g.) from water (2.3 ml, i.g.) in a three-lever, food reinforced task. Substitution tests were conducted following administration of GABAA-positive modulators, noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, 5-HT1B agonists and isopropanol. Among the GABAA-positive modulators, diazepam was the only drug that completely substituted for midazolam; both pentobarbital and the neurosteroid allopregnanolone showed partial midazolam substitution. The NMDA antagonist dizocilpine substituted for ethanol, while phencyclidine showed no substitution for either ethanol or midazolam. The serotonin agonists tested also showed no substitution for either ethanol or midazolam. Isopropanol was the only other drug that completely substituted for ethanol. These data extend previous findings from an ethanol-pentobarbital-water discrimination and further define training conditions that result in a conditional basis for the ethanol discrimination where only those drugs with pharmacological heterogeneous effects similar to ethanol produce a full ethanol-like effect.", 
    "65": "Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) show behavioural differences when compared to their strain-matched controls. These differences include decreased anxiety-like behaviour in SHR, while both improved performance and behavioural deficits have been reported in learning/memory studies. Considering that alterations in anxiety levels during the training session can modify retention performance in animal models of memory, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of anxiety levels in the performance of SHR rats in the plus-maze discriminative avoidance task (PM-DAT), in which memory and anxiety are evaluated simultaneously. Adult (5-month-old) and young (45-day-old) SHR and normotensive Wistar rats (NWR) were treated with chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) or saline. Thirty minutes later, rats were submitted to the PM-DAT training session. After 24 h, the test session was performed. The results showed that: (1) adult SHR showed lower anxiety levels compared to adult NWR; (2) adult SHR and NWR, as well as young NWR, showed significant retention of the task, while young SHR showed impaired performance; (3) 5.0 mg/kg CDZ decreased anxiety levels in adult NWR and young and adult SHR; (4) 5.0 mg/kg CDZ impaired retention in adult SHR and NWR and increased retention in young SHR. Our data suggest an important role of anxiety levels in the performance of SHR in a plus-maze discriminative avoidance task.", 
    "66": "The present study investigated the effects of midazolam and pentylenetetrazole upon repeating and varying sequences of responses. Rats were exposed to a multiple schedule with two components. Under the VARY component, water was provided if the current sequence of four responses differed from each of the five previous ones; under the REPEAT component, water delivery was contingent upon a particular four-response sequence. Each component was signaled by specific exteroceptive stimuli. Overall, sequence variability was affected by midazolam, and to a lesser degree, by pentylenetetrazole. With the REPEAT contingency, drug administration increased behavior variation, thus reducing accuracy; with the VARY contingency, behavior variation and accuracy were not altered. These results were explained on the basis of the disruptive effects of both drugs upon the discriminative control exerted by previous responses within a sequence and by exteroceptive stimuli.", 
    "67": "The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of the selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP 94253, the selective 5-HT1B receptor antagonist SB 216641, and the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR 127935 in behavioral tests commonly used to predict anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activity. Diazepam and imipramine were used as reference drugs. In the Vogel conflict drinking test, CP 94253 (1.25-5 mg/kg), SB 216641 (2.5-5 mg/kg) and GR 127935 (5-10 mg/kg) showed anxiolytic-like effects comparable to that of diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg). In the elevated plus-maze test, antianxiety-like activity of all the compounds tested was also observed: the effects of CP 94253 (2.5 mg/kg) and SB 216641 (5 mg/kg) were similar to that of diazepam (5 mg/kg), while GR 127935 (up to 40 mg/kg) was less active. In the four-plate test, the compounds tested (5-10 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects which were weaker than that of diazepam (2.5-5 mg/kg). In the forced swimming test, CP 94253 (5-10 mg/kg), like imipramine (30 mg/kg), showed anti-immobility action, whereas SB 216641 (2.5-10 mg/kg) and GR 127935 (20-40 mg/kg) did not affect the immobility time in mice. The results indicate that the selective agonist (CP 94253) and antagonists (SB 216641 and GR 127935) of 5-HT1B receptors produce effects that are characteristic of anxiolytics, in the preclinical models used; however, CP 94253 also behaves like an antidepressant drug.", 
    "68": "Bz-423 is a new benzodiazepine that has cytotoxic and cytostatic effects against a number of cell types in culture, and recent studies have shown efficacy in experimental lupus models in rodents. The present study demonstrates that treating human skin in organ culture with Bz-423 suppresses retinoid-induced epidermal hyperplasia. Bz-423 suppresses hyperplasia in organ culture at concentrations that also inhibit keratinocyte proliferation in monolayer culture but that are not cytotoxic for keratinocytes and do not inhibit fibroblast growth. Under conditions in which keratinocyte proliferation is inhibited, there is no measurable effect on epidermal growth factor receptor activation, but there is reduced signaling at the level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase. Suppression of keratinocyte growth by Bz-423 is associated with generation of intracellular oxidants. However, antioxidant treatment reduces keratinocyte cytotoxicity that occurs at high concentrations of Bz-423, but it does not inhibit growth suppression. Together, these data suggest that Bz-423 has the potential to limit the untoward effects associated with topical retinoid treatment, and in addition, may have therapeutic effects against other forms of epidermal hyperplasia.",

Many patients with chronic insomnia, including primary insomnia and insomnia secondary to a variety of medical and psychiatric disorders, also benefit from pharmacotherapy. Relatively few individuals receive prescription medication to help them sleep, and the majority use medication for a few nights to several weeks, as opposed to continuous use for months or years. The hypnotics available on the U.S. market today are benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZRAs). The BZRAs are efficacious in reducing sleep latency, increasing total sleep time, reducing awakenings, and improving sleep quality without the development of tolerance in studies as long as 6 months. Side effects of the BZRAs are infrequent, dose-related, and related to the sedative properties of the drug. Sedating antidepressants are also frequently prescribed to promote sleep despite inadequate data to support their efficacy for this indication and a greater potential for clinically troublesome side effects.",

    "92": "We have recently shown that the abrupt discontinuation of chronic diazepam (DZM) administration facilitated ethanol consumption and enhanced the anxiolytic properties of ethanol. Tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine have been shown to reduce alcohol intake in rodent models of alcoholism and in alcoholics who are depressed. In the present study, we tested whether desipramine (1.25; 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) treatment affect both ethanol intake in a free-choice test and the anxiolytic effect induced by ethanol in DZM withdrawn rats. Adult male Wistar rats were submitted to a chronic DZM treatment (2 mg/kg per day) or vehicle (VEH) for 21 days. Twenty-four hours after the last DZM injection, rats were subjected to a free-choice paradigm between water and increasing ethanol concentrations with or without concurrent desipramine or fluoxetine administration (ethanol concentration (v/v) was increased every 4 days as follows: 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10% for the final 8 days). Chronic treatment with desipramine (24 days, twice a day, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and fluoxetine (24 days, once a day; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the amount of ethanol intake in DZM withdrawn rats. Furthermore, subchronic treatments with desipramine (4 days, twice a day, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) and fluoxetine (4 days, once a day, 5 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked the anxiolytic-like behavior in the elevated plus maze induced by ethanol (1 g/kg; i.p.) in DZM withdrawn rats at day 5 of withdrawal. The present findings suggest that desipramine and fluoxetine could be effective pharmacological tools to prevent the subsequent development of ethanol dependence in rats previously exposed to DZM withdrawal.", 
    "93": "In a randomized, double-blind trial, patients with acute bipolar mania received 1-6 mg/day of risperidone, 2-12 mg/day of haloperidol, or placebo for 3 weeks, followed by double-blind risperidone or haloperidol for 9 weeks. Of 438 patients, 154 were randomized to risperidone, 144 to haloperidol, and 140 to placebo. The mean+/-S.D. modal doses were 4.2+/-1.7 mg/day of risperidone and 8.0+/-3.6 mg/day of haloperidol during the initial 3-week phase and 4.1+/-1.8 and 7.4+/-3.7 mg/day during the 12-week period. At week 3, mean Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score reductions from baseline were significantly greater in patients receiving risperidone than placebo (p<0.001). Differences between risperidone and haloperidol on this efficacy measure were not significant. Further reductions in YMRS scores were seen in patients receiving risperidone or haloperidol during the subsequent 9 weeks. No unexpected adverse events were reported. Extrapyramidal disorder and hyperkinesias, the most commonly reported adverse events with antipsychotic use, occurred less frequently with risperidone than haloperidol. We conclude that risperidone monotherapy was an effective and well-tolerated treatment for bipolar mania and that efficacy was maintained over the long term.",

    "95": "Line-ends, corners and junctions are important singularities for form analysis, object recognition, depth ordering or motion processing. In this study, we investigate the extent to which processing the motion of line ends depends on the spatial configuration of their immediate surround. To that aim, we used two vertical collinear line segments, translating clockwise or anti-clockwise along a circular path, together with a direction discrimination task. Direction discrimination was measured independently for outer line-ends--at both segments extremities--and inner line-ends--in between collinear segments--using line segments partially occluded by invisible masks such that the direction of either inner or outer line-ends' motion was restricted to a sinusoidal translation along a horizontal axis, and thus irrelevant for the motion task. Under these conditions, access to the direction of inner line-ends is longer and more difficult than it is for outer line-ends. Subsequent experiments show that these effects depend on the degree of collinearity between line segments. Similar experiments were performed after volunteers took a dose of Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine that facilitates the fixation of GABA on GABAA receptors. The results show that the differences between the processing of inner and outer line-ends is reduced, suggesting that the effect of the surround is modulated by inhibitory mechanisms. Using a simple model, we propose that this effect can be explained by a competition between a segmentation process based on surround suppression and contour integration through long-range horizontal connections, at or prior to motion processing stages.",

After switch from conventional neuroleptics to olanzapine patients showed an increase of step length and decrease of cadence at the low (p </= 0.01) and the intermediately low treadmill velocity (p </= 0.05), whereas the parameters remained stable at the normal gait velocity. Significant differences between the untreated state and treatment with olanzapine were not detectable.

    "108": "During a 5-year period, 1997 to 2002, therapeutic drug monitoring of midazolam plasma concentrations in combination with the level of sedation as assessed by the Ramsay sedation scale was performed in 648 critically ill patients requiring artificial ventilation. In a subgroup of 189 patients sepsis-related organ failure assessment procedure was additionally performed. A total number of 3354 samples were analyzed. Significantly reduced clearance of midazolam was observed within the first 4 days of midazolam treatment of critically ill patients. As a result, accumulation of midazolam and its metabolites occurred within the first week of treatment. In contrast, parameters such as serum bilirubin or creatinine, which are commonly used to adapt drug therapy to organ dysfunction, showed significant changes with a delay of more than 10 days as compared with the findings of midazolam monitoring. Midazolam plasma concentrations showed a good correlation with the sedative capacity of the drug (r2 = 0.906). However, a great variability of the drug effect between patients could be demonstrated, which, as a consequence, may complicate the development of dosing strategies based on midazolam plasma concentrations to better control sedation in critically ill patients. Furthermore, patient age seems to be an important factor for the considerable variability of the sedative effect of midazolam. To achieve a certain levels of sedation, significantly lower midazolam infusion rates as well as plasma concentrations were required as the patients age increased. No significant sex-related differences could be observed for any pharmacologic parameter obtained in this study. Our findings suggest that midazolam therapeutic drug monitoring might be a useful tool to individualize midazolam therapy, especially in critically ill patients developing organ dysfunction and requiring long-term sedation to minimize the risk of drug accumulation and excessive sedation.", 
    "109": "Administration of fluvoxamine with concomitant benzodiazepines is common in clinical situations. This study investigated the effects of the coadministration of fluvoxamine on plasma concentrations of etizolam and evaluated the effects of various fluvoxamine doses on drug interactions with etizolam. Subjects were 18 Japanese outpatients concomitantly treated with fluvoxamine before or after monotherapy with etizolam. Plasma concentrations of etizolam were measured using a column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection. In 17 subjects treated concomitantly with fluvoxamine at 25 mg or 50 mg, the ranges of plasma concentrations of etizolam corrected for the dose increased from 2.0-13.3 (mean 6.3 +/- 3.6, n = 17) in monotherapy to 2.7-18.2 (mean 9.6 +/- 5.1, n = 17) ng/mL/mg in concomitant doses. Wide variations were observed in the drug interactions; however, coadministration with fluvoxamine produced significant changes in the plasma concentrations of etizolam (P < 0.0001) with a median of 42.9% (range 0.0 to 235.0%). Although the sleepiness of the subjects was evaluated using the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, no changes in sleepiness were found between the etizolam-monotherapy and the fluvoxamine-concomitant states. Of the 12 subjects treated concomitantly with fluvoxamine at 25 mg, 2 subjects received fluvoxamine at a dose increased up to 150 mg, and another received fluvoxamine at a dose increased up to 200 mg. They showed an increase in the plasma concentrations of etizolam in a fluvoxamine dose-dependent manner; more particularly, the increased dose of fluvoxamine (150 mg and 200 mg) resulted in about a twofold variation in plasma concentrations of etizolam.", 
    "110": "Hepatic CYP3A enzymes were studied in weanling male Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to diets from gestational d 4 in which the sole protein source was either casein (CAS) or soy protein isolate (SPI). At age 25 d, rats were gavaged with corn oil or one of the CYP3A inducers, dexamethasone (DEX) and clotrimazole (CLT), at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Little CYP3A1 (CYP3A23), CYP3A2, or CYP3A9 mRNA was observed in CAS-fed weanling rats but CYP3A18 mRNA was readily detectable in Northern blots. In contrast, consumption of SPI without inducer treatment resulted in the expression of CYP3A1 (CYP3A23), and CYP3A2 mRNAs, expression of CYP3A apoprotein in hepatic microsomes, and a 2-fold greater turnover of the CYP3A substrate midazolam (P < 0.05). DEX induced CYP3A1, CYP3A2, and CYP3A9 (P < 0.05), but not CYP3A18 mRNA expression in rats fed both diets. Hepatic CYP3A apoprotein expression and midazolam 4-hydroxylation in SPI-fed rats was greater than that of CAS-fed rats after DEX treatment (P < 0.05). CLT also induced CYP3A2 mRNA 2-fold in rats fed both diets but CYP3A apoprotein expression in microsomes from SPI-fed CLT rats was double that of CLT-treated rats fed CAS (P < 0.05). The elevation of CYP3A apoprotein due to SPI and the CYP3A apoprotein induction by DEX and CLT treatment yielded no significant diet x inducer interaction. Analysis of heterologous nuclear RNA expression by RT-PCR using intron-specific primers for CYP3A1 revealed a 14-fold increase in RNA transcription in CAS-fed rats after treatment with DEX (P < 0.05) but no increase in rats fed SPI compared with rats fed CAS even though CYP3A1 mRNA and CYP3A apoprotein were significantly elevated. These data demonstrate that exposure to SPI during early development can increase CYP3A expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms and suggest that early soy consumption has potential effects on the metabolism of a wide variety of CYP3A substrates.", 
    "111": "Disturbances in the metabolism of the brain amino acid transmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) may contribute to the pathophysiology of human anxiety disorders. Animal studies indicate that deletions or reductions in the expression of the gene for the GABA synthetic enzyme, glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD(65)), reduce basal cortical GABA levels or stress-induced release of GABA in the cerebral cortex and increase fear behaviors. Complementing these findings, the authors recently observed lower than normal cortical GABA levels in patients with panic disorder. In the current study, the authors tested the hypothesis that panic disorder patients have a deficient GABA neuronal response to benzodiazepine (clonazepam) administration.",

    "113": "Panic disorder patients had a deficient GABA neuronal response (blunted reduction of occipital cortex GABA level) to acute benzodiazepine administration, compared to the healthy subjects, who exhibited a significant decrease in occipital cortex GABA levels after this intervention. The patients also appeared to have persistently low occipital cortex GABA after chronic benzodiazepine treatment.",

    "115": "It was found that a collapse of the mitochondrial calcium buffering caused by the protonophoric uncoupler CCCP, antimycin A plus oligomycin, or the inhibitor of the mitochondrial Ca2+/Na+ exchanger led to a strong inhibition of thapsigargin-induced capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) into Jurkat cells suspended in a medium at pH 7.2. The effect of these inhibitors was markedly less significant at higher extracellular pH. Moreover, dysfunction of the mitochondrial calcium handling greatly decreased CCE sensitivity to extracellular Ca2+ when the pH of extracellular solution was 7.2 (apparent Kd toward extracellular Ca2+ rose from 2.3 +/- 0.6 mm in control cells to 11.0 +/- 1.7 mM in CCCP-treated cells) as compared with pH 7.8 (apparent Kd toward extracellular Ca2+ increased from 1.3 +/- 0.4 mM in control cells to 2.4 +/- 0.4 mM in uncoupler-treated cells). Changes in intracellular pH triggered by methylamine did not influence Ca2+ influx. This suggests that, in Jurkat cells, store-operated calcium channels sense extracellular pH change as a parameter that modifies their sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+. In contrast, in human osteosarcoma cells, changes in extracellular pH as well as mitochondrial uncoupling did not exert any inhibitory effects on CCE.",

Defining global cognitive impairment as a 3MS score < 80, a cut-point of 60 on the KDQOL-CF accurately classified 76% of subjects, with 52% sensitivity and 81% specificity. On multivariable analysis, cerebral and peripheral vascular disease, benzodiazepine use, and higher serum phosphorus concentrations were associated with lower KDQOL-CF scores, while beta blocker use, education, and higher serum albumin concentrations were associated with higher KDQOL-CF scores.",

    "120": "Sleep and wakefulness are both active processes regulated by complex neural networks, the precise mechanisms of which are not yet fully understood. Patients with insomnia, particularly primary insomnia, often exhibit hyperarousal and may receive therapies to reduce wakefulness and promote sleep. Apart from standard sleep hygiene measures, physicians can offer patients behavioral therapy (if available) or pharmacologic therapy, or both. Both provide relief for insomnia symptoms; however, that relief appears durable on cessation of behavioral therapy only. Practice parameters for the treatment of insomnia are available for the use of behavioral therapy, but those for pharmacologic therapy are dated and do not reflect the current state of clinical practice. Hypnotic agents currently approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration may be used for only 4 weeks and are limited by variable efficacy and concerns about safety profiles. This situation has prompted many physicians to prescribe antidepressants and other agents for their sedating properties, despite a paucity of efficacy and safety data in patients with insomnia. Of the hypnotic agents currently under clinical investigation, so far only eszopiclone has been studied in regard to efficacy over a prolonged period (6 months) with no evidence of significant tolerance. Although reports suggest that other hypnotics may also provide longer-term benefits, further research is needed to determine the optimal duration of treatment in chronic insomnia.", 
    "121": "Primary care physicians are often the first healthcare providers to encounter insomnia in their patients. However, they face many obstacles to diagnosis and treatment of insomnia that stem from patient- and physician-related factors. During consultations, most patients do not mention their sleep difficulties because they believe that insomnia is a trivial concern that does not have serious health consequences. Physicians also face diagnostic obstacles related to conflicting or vague diagnostic definitions, office-based time constraints, and a lack of training in sleep medicine in medical school and residency programs. Once a diagnosis is made, initiating appropriate treatment is also complicated because of outdated treatment guidelines and US Food and Drug Administration prescribing constraints. These factors may have contributed to the perception that there are no good treatment options for insomnia and that all available medications have a poor risk-benefit ratio. For example, benzodiazepines are known to carry a risk of tolerance and abuse. Until recently, few long-term data were available on the safety and efficacy of current agents, which may have contributed to reticence to treat chronic insomnia. Furthermore, there is limited evidence that treating insomnia is associated with improved patient outcomes, and this may have discouraged active treatment programs for insomnia. Increased awareness that insomnia can precede and exacerbate coexisting illnesses, including depression and chronic pain syndromes, is needed. As data emerge from recent clinical trials with newer, promising nonbenzodiazepine medications, it should become easier for primary care physicians to take a proactive role in diagnosing and treating insomnia and thus improve patient functioning.",

Fifteen children (6 weeks-28 months of age) with complex congenital heart disease and/or respiratory failure who received opioids and benzodiazepines for 4 days or greater were evaluated for withdrawal symptoms using a standardized assessment tool. Thirteen children showed moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms a median 3 days after commencement of tapering. Symptom intensity was not related to prior opioid or benzodiazepine exposure, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy or length of tapering. Children who received fentanyl in addition to morphine more often exhibited signs of withdrawal. This study demonstrated that significant withdrawal symptoms occur in critically ill children even with the use of a standardised assessment tool and tapering management protocol. The predictive validity and utility of the Opioid and Benzodiazepine Withdrawal Score (OBWS) was adequate for clinical use, but areas for further improvement of the tool were identified. Problems with the clinical withdrawal prevention and management guidelines were also identified. More research is needed to establish the optimal methods for prevention and management of iatrogenic opioid and benzodiazepine withdrawal in paediatric critical care.",

Eighty-three subjects were assessed using the LUNSERS, the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), before and after a 6-week treatment with olanzapine. Significant correlations were found between the changes in scores of parkinsonism items of LUNSERS and SAS. The changes in scores of akathisia item (restlessness), extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) subscale and psychic side-effects subscale of LUNSERS were significantly correlated with those of the BARS. 'Shakiness', one item of the EPS subscale of LUNSERS, correctly classified between parkinsonism and non-parkinsonism groups with 81.0% accuracy. A combination of four items included in EPS and psychic side-effect subscales of LUNSERS identified akathisia and non-akathisia groups with 76.2% accuracy. These results suggest that the EPS and psychic side-effect subscales of LUNSERS may be useful in screening for drug-induced parkinsonism and akathisia.",

    "133": "Ethanol enhances GABAergic synaptic inhibition, and this interaction contributes to many of the behavioral and cognitive effects of this drug. Most studies suggest that ethanol enhances GABAergic neurotransmission via an allosteric potentiation of the postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors that mediate fast synaptic inhibition in the mammalian CNS. Despite widespread acceptance of this hypothesis, direct support for such a mechanism has been difficult to obtain. Ethanol does not enhance GABA(A) receptor function in all brain regions or under all experimental conditions, and factors responsible for this variability remain mostly unknown. Notably, blockade of GABA(B) receptors dramatically enhances ethanol potentiation of hippocampal GABA(A) IPSPs and IPSCs, suggesting that some unknown GABA(B) receptor mechanism limits the overall potentiating effect of ethanol on GABAergic synapses. In this study, we demonstrate that, at perisomatic synapses in the rat hippocampus, ethanol enhances presynaptic GABA(B) autoreceptor function and that this interaction reduces the overall potentiating effect of ethanol at these synapses. We further show that ethanol significantly elevates basal presynaptic GABA(B) receptor tone, possibly via an increase in spontaneous GABA release, and that pretreatment with a subthreshold concentration of the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen blocks ethanol but not flunitrazepam or pentobarbital potentiation of GABA(A) IPSCs. These data suggest that an interaction between ethanol and presynaptic GABA(B) autoreceptor activity regulates the ethanol sensitivity of GABAergic synapses. Given that the in vitro ethanol sensitivity of these synapses correlates with in vivo ethanol responsiveness in a number of rodent lines, our data further suggest that presynaptic GABA(B) receptor activity may play a role in regulating behavioral sensitivity to ethanol.", 
    "134": "Supraclavicular uptake of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) scan is attributed to lymph node, muscle, or brown fat activity. Differentiation between physiological or pathological etiologies is necessary. Benzodiazepine premedication to reduce physiological uptake has been attempted with variable success. A relationship between brown-fat FDG uptake and cold temperature has also been established. To our knowledge, no case reports or studies have been published to demonstrate whether controlling the temperature can alter the physiological uptake in these regions.",

    "137": "Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, we propose that the control of temperature reduces the metabolism of glucose by brown fat. Further studies are warranted to confirm the above observations, and, if confirmed, to determine the most efficient and effective use of temperature control to minimize supraclavicular and axillary FDG uptake.",

    "139": "The chromatography was performed using a CN column with acetontrile-0.1 mol L(-1) sodium heptasulfonate solution (7:3) and (5:5) as the mobile phases. The detection wavelength was 267 nm for reserpine, chlordiazepoxide and hydrochlorothiazide, 310 nm for dihydralazine sulfate, 360 nm for triamterene.", 
    "140": "The linear range of each component was tested, and the recovery and stability of each component was satisfactory, three lots of samples were determined using the method.", 
    "141": "This is an accurate and credible quality control method for compound hypotensive tablet.", 
    "142": "Three methods for estimation of the equilibrium tissue-to-plasma partition ratios (Kp values) in the presence of tissue concentration time data have been investigated. These are the area method, the open loop (tissue specific) method and the whole body model(closed loop) method, each with different model assumptions. Additionally, multiple imputations, a technique for dealing with deficiencies in data sets (i.e., missing tissues) is used. The estimated Kp values by the three methods have been compared and the limitations and advantages of each approach drawn. The area method, which is essentially model free, gives only a crude estimate of Kp without making any statement of its uncertainty; whereas both the open and closed loop methods provide an estimate of this. The closed loop method, where the most assumptions are made, is the approach that gives the best overall estimates of Kp, which was confirmed by comparing the predicted concentration-time profiles with experimental data. Although the estimates from the closed loop method, as well as the other two methods, are conditioned on the data, they are the most reliable for both propagating parameter variability and uncertainty through a whole body physiologically based model, as well as for extrapolation to human. A series of benzodiazepines, namely alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clobazam, diazepam, flunitrazepam, midazolam and triazolam in rat is used as a case study in the current investigation.", 
    "143": "The purpose of this double-masked study was to evaluate effects of intravenous sedation (IVS) using midazolam or diazepam during periodontal procedures on patient recall, psychomotor response, oxygen saturation, and hemodynamic factors.", 
    "144": "Seventeen patients received either two or three scheduled periodontal surgeries under IVS with midazolam, diazepam, or placebo control. Patients were monitored throughout the procedure for hemodynamic variables, percent oxygen saturation, level of recall of common objects presented at baseline, and psychomotor function via the perceptual speed test (PST).", 
    "145": "Fifteen patients completed the study with average titrated dosages of 3.3 and 12.1 mg for midazolam and diazepam, respectively. Within the limitations of the study, there were few differences observed between the drugs with regard to hemodynamic variables, oxygen saturation, and overall percentage of objects recalled by patients sedated with either drug. However, midazolam was found to cause a greater incidence of amnesia lasting up to 30 minutes when compared to placebo. Patients on diazepam required an average of 15 minutes longer to recover accuracy as measured by the PST.", 
    "146": "The results suggest that diazepam and midazolam each may have advantages for IVS. In procedures lasting over 45 minutes, diazepam appears to be more clinically advantageous including a wider margin of safety during titration and gradual recovery. Midazolam may be used for shorter procedures for faster onset of action, predictable amnesic effects, and relatively rapid recovery.", 
    "147": "Using positron emission tomography and [(11)C](R)-PK11195, a marker of \"peripheral benzodiazepine sites\" that is upregulated on activated microglia during progressive tissue pathology, we show increased binding of [(11)C](R)-PK11195 in frontotemporal lobar degeneration in the typically affected frontotemporal brain regions. This implies the presence of an active glial response reflecting progressive neuronal degeneration. It also suggests that increased [(11)C](R)-PK11195 binding, previously demonstrated for Alzheimer's disease, may occur independently from increased amyloid plaque formation, given that it is not a characteristic feature of frontotemporal lobar degeneration.", 
    "148": "We investigated the relationship between postoperative confusion and duration of benzodiazepine exposure, preoperative anxiety, depressive state, and cognitive function in elderly patients regularly taking benzodiazepines. We studied 328 patients ranging in age from 65 to 80 yr who underwent orthopedic surgery. Information on benzodiazepine use was obtained by face-to-face interview and visual assessment of the patient's medicine chest. Postoperative confusion was assessed by using a confusion-assessment method. The patients were divided into two groups: those who regularly took benzodiazepines and those who did not. Fifty-seven (17%) of 328 patients were treated with benzodiazepines. There were no significant differences in preoperative Mini-Mental State (MMS) scores, anxiety scores, or depression scores between benzodiazepine users and nonusers. Postoperative confusion occurred in 15 (26%) of 57 benzodiazepine users and in 34 (13%) of 271 nonusers (P < 0.01). The patients who had a score <23 on the MMS were 5 (9%) of 57 benzodiazepine users and 8 (3%) of 271 nonusers (P < 0.05). Postoperative confusion occurred in 13 (35%) of 37 long-term benzodiazepine users (daily use for >1 yr) and in 2 (10%) of 20 short-term users (daily use for <1 yr). The incidence of postoperative confusion was significantly more frequent in long-term than in short-term benzodiazepine users or nonusers of benzodiazepines. The patients who developed a score <23 on the MMS were 5 (14%) of 37 long-term benzodiazepine users and 0 (0%) of 20 short-term benzodiazepine users. In conclusion, the incidence of postoperative confusion was significantly more frequent in long-term benzodiazepine users.", 
    "149": "In France, since 1996, any general practitioner (GP) can prescribe high-dosage buprenorphine maintenance treatment (BMT) for opioid-dependent patients. The health authorities initially provided mandatory specific training, but since 1998, such training is only delivered by specialized networks and the pharmaceutical industry. Among a random sample of GPs from southeastern France (N=345), we found that many untrained GPs, as well as a significant minority of trained GPs, were likely to prescribe an ineffective dosage of buprenorphine or a potentially dangerous treatment (BMT+a short half-life benzodiazepine). These results highlight the necessity to edit clear guidelines, especially concerning situations of polyaddiction and psychiatric comorbidity, and to extend and improve BMT training in France with a renewed involvement of health authorities for quality control of such training. They even suggest that GPs' participation to specialized training sessions should become a mandatory prerequisite for prescribing BMT.", 
    "150": "All patients who were admitted within one year to the Department of Traumatology of the Innsbruck University Hospital as a result of an accident were included in this epidemiological study: a total of 1611 patients. 18.9% (n = 304) of these patients were injured as a result of a work-related accident and the remaining 81.2% (n = 1307) were involved in accidents due to other causes. Within the group of patients involved in work-related accidents, alcohol consumption was more frequent in males (13.3%) than in females (1.8%) (p = 0.016) and clearly lower than in patients injured by accidents due to other causes. In work--related accidents we found a correlation between the educational standard of patients and the frequency of alcohol consumption. The mean blood alcohol concentration was lower in patients involved in work-related accidents (0.76 +/- 0.58 g/l) compared to other injuries (1.63 g/l +/- 0.74 g/l). No correlations were found concerning benzodiazepine use and demographic variables and all measured benzodiazepine plasma levels were within the therapeutic range.", 
    "151": "This article summarizes the short-term physiological toxicity and the adverse behavioral effects of four substances (GHB, ketamine, MDMA, and Rohypnol) that have been used at latenight dance clubs. The two primary data sources were case studies of human fatalities and experimental studies with laboratory animals. A safety ratio was calculated for each substance based on its estimated lethal dose and its customary recreational dose. GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) appears to be the most physiologically toxic; Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) appears to be the least physiologically toxic. The single most risk-producing behavior of club drug users is combining psychoactive substances, usually involving alcohol. Hazardous drug-use sequelae such as accidents, aggressive behavior, and addiction were not factored into the safety ratio estimates.", 
    "152": "This preliminary descriptive study was designed to assess the reasons, primary contexts, and consequences (physical, psychological, lifestyle) of club drug use in a sample of young adults in a mid-size U.S. city. Fifty young adults (18 to 30 years old) reported on their use of club drugs (Ecstasy, GHB, ketamine, Rohypnol, methamphetamine, LSD) in face-to-face interviews that included quantitative and qualitative measures. Ecstasy was the most frequently used club drug followed by ketamine, LSD and methamphetamine. All of the participants reported using club drugs to \"experiment\" and most reported using these drugs to feel good and enhance social activities. Club drugs were frequently used at raves, in bars or clubs, and at home with friends. An average of 16 negative physical, psychological, and lifestyle consequences were reported for club drug use. Despite substantial negative consequences, participants perceived several positive consequences of regular recreational club drug use. These findings corroborate descriptions of club drug use in other countries (e.g., Australia, United Kingdom) and provide additional information on perceived positive consequences that users experience with club drug use. Further exploration of the reasons and positive consequences that are associated with use of each of the club drugs may provide important information on the growing trend in use of these drugs."
