    "0": "One hundred seven acutely ill ventilated patients were prospectively studied to ascertain the severity and frequency of alterations in gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters during brief bronchoscopy. Sedation was performed using midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV) without topical anesthesia. An average decline in PaO2 of 26 percent was observed at the end of the procedure, compared to the baseline value, and this was associated with a mild increase in PaCO2 in spite of the use of a special adapter. Alterations in mean systolic blood pressure appeared to be modest, consisting of a 10 percent decrease from the control level, related to sedation, and a 10 percent rise from baseline during the procedure, associated with a concomitant mild tachycardia. At that time, central hemodynamic measurements performed in a subset of 31 patients showed a significant increase in cardiac output associated with higher pulmonary wedge pressure. Fourteen patients developed hypoxemia of less than 60 mm Hg on FIO2 adjusted to 0.8. Of the ten risk factors univariately associated with hypoxemia, only the presence of ARDS (p less than 0.001) and \"fighting\" the ventilator during the procedure (p less than 0.05) remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. Attempts to prevent hypoxemia in critically ill patients should focus on inducing complete sedation, with careful attention to hemodynamic status, or providing maximal levels of oxygen to the ventilator (or both).", 
    "1": "Oxiracetam, a nootropic drug, could be of potential use in the treatment of memory disturbances in patients with epilepsy who are using antiepileptic drugs. The half-life of oxiracetam appears to be influenced by the concomitant use of carbamazepine or valproic acid, necessitating more frequent administration of oxiracetam than is recommended for other conditions. No effect was observed on the serum concentrations of these antiepileptic drugs by oxiracetam. Long term concurrent use of oxiracetam and antiepileptic agents does not appear to be contraindicated.", 
    "2": "Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy can be performed without intravenous sedation but the evidence suggests that, in the United Kingdom and United States, most patients and endoscopists prefer that some form of premedication is given. Intravenous diazepam or midazolam are used by the majority of endoscopists. In the UK, the ratio of diazepam to midazolam users is approximately 2:1, while in the USA more endoscopists are now using midazolam. Midazolam is approximately twice as potent as diazepam but, when allowance is made for this, there is probably little or no difference in the propensity of the two drugs to produce respiratory depression. The antegrade amnesic effect of midazolam is significantly superior to that of diazepam. A benzodiazepine/narcotic combination can achieve a smoother and more rapid induction with less gagging and choking, but the incidence of adverse outcomes--particularly respiratory depression--is increased significantly. Over 50% of the deaths that are associated with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy are due to cardiopulmonary problems. Hypoxia is very common if measured using non-invasive monitoring equipment, such as a pulse oximeter. Methods of preventing oxygen desaturation and thus, by inference, most cardiac arrhythmias associated with endoscopy are discussed, as is the role of flumazenil, the new benzodiazepine antagonist.",

    "4": "Diazepam and pro-diazepam (2-benzoyl-4-chloro-N-methyl-N-lysylglycin anilide) have been used as adjunct antidotes to pyridostigmine and atropine against the organophosphate, soman, in the guinea-pig. Both added significant protection to the pyridostigmine/atropine treatment. Animals pretreated with diazepam, 60 min before soman, were \"better\" protected than animals given an equimolar dose of pro-diazepam therapeutically 1 min after soman. A pretreatment with diazepam for three days further increased the protection. A therapeutic dose of pro-diazepam, 1 min after soman, gave no further protection, to the three day diazepam pretreatment. The serum concentrations of diazepam (given i.p.) and desmethyldiazepam (given i.m.) were determined by GLC after diazepam (i.p.) and pro-diazepam (i.m.) were given. The protection, relative to the control, provided by the diazepam pretreatment (60 min before and for three days before soman) correlated linearly, r = 0.9898, with the serum values of diazepam achieved at these times. Our data suggest that diazepam as adjunct to pyridostigmine and atropine administered as pretreatment gives a \"safer\" protection, than an equimolar dose of pro-diazepam given therapeutically.", 
    "5": "Seven days of isolation induce in mice a social behavioral deficit (decrease in escape attempts) reversed by TFMPP acting through activation of 5-HT1B receptors. The present experiments were performed to investigate the interaction between tranquillizing drugs and one aspect of the serotonergic functioning through the TFMPP-induced increase in escape attempts. The benzodiazepines diazepam, alprazolam, triazolam and chlordiazepoxide impaired significantly TFMPP-induced increase in escape attempts at behaviorally inactive doses. Buspirone opposed TFMPP effect, but the active doses 4 and 16 mg/kg alone decreased the number of escape attempts. ICS 205-930 in a large dose range (0.001-1 mg/kg) modified neither the number of escape attempts nor the increase induced by TFMPP. Chronic (11 days) treatment with buspirone (16 mg/kg) or ICS 205-930 (1 mg/kg) modified neither the number of escape attempts of isolated mice nor the increase induced by TFMPP. These results suggest that tranquillizing drugs of the benzodiazepines group, but not of other groups, interact with the 5-HT1B receptors; they add to the knowledge of relations between benzodiazepines and serotonin by specifying the involvement of 5-HT1B receptors.", 
    "6": "The brain uptake of a number of benzodiazepines with different lipophilic and protein binding characteristics was investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats using the rapid intracarotid artery injection technique. When the compounds were administered as a solution in Ringer's buffer, pH 7.4, the uptake was in the order of [14C]diazepam greater than [14C]L-663,581 (anxiolytic agent) greater than [3H]L-364,718 (morphine analgesia potentiator) greater than [14C]L-365,260 (anxiolytic agent) and their extraction ratio values were 71.0 +/- 6.8, 65.0 +/- 12.0, 42.0 +/- 5.0 and 6.0 +/- 2.0%, respectively. The respective permeability-surface product values were 0.755 +/- 0.152, 0.647 +/- 0.180, 0.329 +/- 0.05 and 0.035 +/- 0.011 ml/min/g. The rank order of brain extraction did not correlate well with the drugs' lipophilicity determined by octanol-buffer partition coefficient. For example, L-365,260 had the highest octanol/buffer partition coefficient, but the lowest brain extraction. Plasma protein binding significantly decreased the uptake by the brain but to a lesser extent than that predicted from the unbound drug fraction in vitro, suggesting that drug binding to plasma protein did not limit the transport of drug through the blood-brain barrier. For one compound, L-364,718, the extraction ratio and permeability-surface product values were increased markedly in CC1(4)-induced hepatic injury. Other disease states, uranyl nitrate-induced renal failure and streptozotocin-induced diabetes, had no apparent effect on the uptake of the compounds tested. The effect of disease state on the brain uptake of drug appeared to be dependent on the type of disease and the type of drug studied.", 
    "7": "Abecarnil (ZK 112119; isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboxylate) is a metabolically stable beta-carboline derivative with potent anxiolytic and few sedative and ataxic effects in rodents. The anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant actions of abecarnil have been evaluated in mice, rats, gerbils and baboons. Abecarnil raised the threshold for tonic electroconvulsions in mice after corneal but not after auricular application, had no effect on maximal electroshock-induced tonic convulsions triggered by either method, protected mice against the tonic hindlimb extension in PTZ-, picrotoxin- and 3-mercaptopropionate-induced seizures and blocked clonus after PTZ, DMCM (methyl-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-9H-pyrido-(3,4-b)-indol-3-carboxylate) and 3-mercaptopropionate. Abecarnil had no effect on convulsions induced by bicuculline and strychnine. Furthermore, abecarnil blocked kindled seizures after chronic administration of PTZ and FG 7142 (beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid methylamide) and protected mice and rats against limbic convulsions induced by pilocarpine. Severity and afterdischarge duration of amygdala-kindled seizures were reduced in rats treated with abecarnil. Abecarnil also antagonized selectively convulsions induced by i.c.v. administration of kainate, but not those triggered by N-methyl-D-aspartate or quisqualate. In genetic models of reflex epilepsy, abecarnil was effective against sound-induced convulsions in DBA/2 mice, against air blast-induced generalized seizures in gerbils and against myoclonus in baboons Papio papio. The anticonvulsant effect of abecornil in a PTZ seizure model in mice was potentiated by ethosuximide, whereas no significant potentiation was found with diazepam, clonazepam, diphenylhydantoin, carbamazepine and phenobarbital. Electromyographic monitoring in a etorphine model of muscle rigidity in rats showed no or little muscle relaxant effect of abecarnil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "8": "Abecarnil (isopropyl 6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) is a novel ligand for central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, possessing anxiolytic and anticonvulsant properties, but with considerably reduced muscle relaxant effects in comparison to diazepam (DZP). In vitro, abecarnil inhibited the binding of the BZ [3H]lormetazepam to rat cerebral cortex membranes with an IC50 value of 0.82 nM in comparison to 56 nM for DZP. The ability of abecarnil to displace [3H]lormetazepam was enhanced 1.24-fold in the presence of 30 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid; the corresponding value for DZP was 2.8-fold. DZP and abecarnil were equally effective in enhancing the binding of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate to rat cortical membranes. In vivo, abecarnil exhibited a 3- to 6-fold higher affinity to forebrain BZ receptors than DZP. Abecarnil was from 2 to 10 times more potent than DZP in most rodent tests of anxiolytic activity, and in reducing locomotor activity in mice and rats thoroughly habituated to the test chamber. However, in rats newly exposed to a novel cage, abecarnil was less potent than DZP in reducing locomotor activity. In tests of motor coordination, abecarnil, in contrast to DZP, showed no or only weak activity, and in potentiating the effects of ethanol and hexobarbital on motor performance abecarnil was 4 to 25 times less potent than DZP. Abecarnil antagonized the effects of BZs in the chimney and loss of righting reflex tests, but not in the rotarod test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "10": "Because of the efficacy of specific gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists in tardive dyskinesia, the authors tested the benzodiazepine clonazepam in a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover trial in 19 chronically ill patients with tardive dyskinesia who were being treated with neuroleptics. They found a 35% decrease in dyskinesia ratings with clonazepam treatment. The six patients with predominantly dystonic symptoms showed greater benefit than the 13 patients with predominantly choreoathetoid dyskinesias. Tolerance developed to the antidyskinetic effect of clonazepam in the five patients whose long-term use of the drug was followed, but a 2-week clonazepam-free period recaptured its antidyskinetic effect.", 
    "11": "1. Affinity constants for 15 non-selective or putatively selective muscarinic antagonists were determined at muscarinic autoreceptors and postsynaptic receptors (linked to phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis) in rat hippocampal slices, at muscarinic receptors mediating contractility in guinea-pig atria or ileal smooth muscle and at binding sites in rat cerebral cortical membranes labelled with [3H]-1-quinuclidinyl benzilate or [3H]-pirenzepine. 2. Comparison of the affinities of these antagonists at central M1 receptors (inositol-monophosphate formation in rat hippocampal slices) with their affinities at peripheral M1 receptors (inhibition by McN-A-343 of electrically stimulated twitches in rabbit vas deferens) provides support for the suggestion that these receptors may differ pharmacologically. 3. Comparison of affinity constants obtained by displacement of specifically bound [3H]-pirenzepine from rat cerebral cortical membranes with those obtained in functional tests showed poor correlations between affinities for binding sites and for functional atrial receptors or for hippocampal autoreceptors. A significant correlation was found between affinities for [3H]-pirenzepine binding and those determined at muscarinic receptors linked to PI turnover in rat hippocampus. A significant correlation was also obtained between the affinities for specific [3H]-pirenzepine binding sites in cortical membranes and the affinities at ileal receptors. 4. Comparison of the affinity values for muscarinic autoreceptors in rat hippocampus with affinity values obtained from in vitro models of muscarinic receptor subtypes showed no significant correlations between these autoreceptors and either M1 or M3 receptors. A significant correlation was found between antagonist affinities for hippocampal autoreceptors and muscarinic receptors in the heart. Therefore, muscarinic autoreceptors in rat hippocampus are pharmacologically similar to the M2 (cardiac) muscarinic receptor subtype.", 
    "12": "The hypothesis that endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) released from the small intestine during feeding causes satiety was tested in rat pups, 9 to 12 days old. Intragastric administration of soybean trypsin inhibitor, a procedure that releases CCK from the small intestine, decreased the subsequent intake of a test meal. This effect was reversed by prior treatment with MK-329, a selective antagonist of CCK at alimentary-type CCK (CCK-A) receptors. Thus, endogenous, small intestinal CCK can cause satiety in the neonatal rat and this effect involves CCK-A receptors.", 
    "13": "GABAA-benzodiazepine receptors and epilepsy. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is quantitatively one of the most important neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Since the predominant action of GABA on neurons is inhibitory, activation of GABA receptors, and especially of GABAA receptors, causes an anticonvulsive effect. GABAA receptors can be activated either directly by GABA or GABA-agonists, or indirectly by allosteric modulation of these receptors. For instance, benzodiazepines enhance the postsynaptic actions of GABA by binding to benzodiazepine receptors which are allosteric modulatory binding sites on GABAA receptors. Conversely, there are compounds which bind to the same benzodiazepine receptors, but reduce the postsynaptic actions of GABA. These compounds cause convulsions and are called \"inverse agonists\" of the benzodiazepine receptors. Recent evidence indicates the existence of several different benzodiazepine receptor (and, thus, GABAA receptor) subtypes. Since these receptor subtypes exhibit a different regional distribution in the central nervous system, the development of subtype-selective GABAA receptor agonists or benzodiazepine receptor agonists should result in anticonvulsants with less side effects.", 
    "14": "An association between the ingestion tryptophan and a syndrome characterized by scleroderma-like skin abnormalities, fasciitis, and eosinophilia has recently been recognized in the United States. We report the clinical and histopathological findings in nine patients and the results of biochemical analyses of tryptophan metabolism in seven patients with this syndrome. Edema of the extremities, frequently accompanied by pruritus, paresthesia, and myalgia, developed in the nine patients (six women and three men; age range, 30 to 66 years) 1 to 18 months after the start of therapy with tryptophan (1.5 to 3.0 g daily) for insomnia, depression, or obesity. Five patients were taking drugs (benzodiazepines) known to inhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function, and one had adrenal insufficiency. All had blood eosinophilia in the acute phase of their illness (mean eosinophil count [+/- SD], 3.62 +/- 2.87 X 10(9) cells per liter). All had histopathological changes in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue typical of scleroderma, and seven patients had eosinophils. The fascia was inflamed and fibrotic, and adjacent skeletal muscle often showed perifascicular inflammation. Tryptophan was discontinued in all patients, and eight received prednisone. The cutaneous symptoms improved, but only two patients had complete resolution of their illness. The patients had plasma levels of tryptophan before and after an oral dose of tryptophan that were similar to those in normal subjects. Plasma levels of L-kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which are metabolites of tryptophan, were significantly higher in four patients with active disease than in three patients studied after eosinophilia had resolved or in five normal subjects (P less than 0.001)--findings consistent with the activation of the enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase. This illness resembles eosinophilic fasciitis and probably represents one aspect of the recently reported eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. The development of the syndrome may result from a confluence of several factors, including the ingestion of tryptophan, exposure to agents that activate indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, and possibly, impaired function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.", 
    "15": "Recently in pediatric intensive care, sedative and analgesic drugs are being used more frequently, not only for painful and stressful procedures, but also to improve the techniques of intensive care and the patient's comfort.

    "16": "The diazepam withdrawal syndrome in rats was characterized behaviorally by an increase in spontaneous motor activity, slight body tremor and a lack of convulsions. The 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) technique was used to measure quantitatively cerebral glucose utilization during diazepam withdrawal and revealed changes in glucose utilization in 30% of the 54 structures evaluated. Areas of increased glucose utilization included medial geniculate, inferior colliculus, visual cortex, mammillary body, dorsal hippocampus, cerebellar flocculus, and zona reticulata and globus pallidus, olfactory cortex, nucleus accumbens and internal capsule. There was no single or consistent relationship between reported benzodiazepine receptor densities and glucose utilization.", 
    "17": "Binding parameters of [3H]muscimol ([3H]MUS) and [3H]flunitrazepam ([ 3H]FLU) were determined in the thalamic area of overlap of nigro- and pallidothalamic pathways at short- (1-10 weeks) and long-term (6-11 months) survival times after kainic acid lesioning of substantia nigra pairs reticularis (SNr) and/or entopeduncular nucleus (EPN). No statistically significant lesion-induced changes in Kd could be established in any of the lesioned groups. Bmax values for both binding sites, when corrected for nerve cell densities, revealed some changes in all but one instance (no statistically significant changes in the number of [3H]MUS binding sites were detected after SNr lesions). Significant bilateral increase in the number of [3H]MUS binding sites was found after unilateral EPN and combined EPN + SNr lesions. In the first group the changes were transient; in the second, the number of binding sites appeared to be still on the rise at 8 months postlesion. The latter increase was interpreted as resulting from plasticity type changes in GABAergic local circuit neurons in response to massive deafferentation from extrinsic inhibitory inputs. Changes in [3H]FLU binding sites were of different character and of extremely low magnitude compared to changes in [3H]MUS binding sites. Subtle, but statistically significant, ipsilateral increase in the number of [3H]FLU binding sites as a function of time postlesion was found in the SNr lesioned group. In two other lesioned groups small magnitude increase occurred bilaterally, although in the EPN lesioned group it was more pronounced on the operated side. The results are consistent with earlier suggestion that [3H]MUS and [3H]FLU binding sites in the motor thalamus appear to be associated with different types of GABAergic synapses with none of them being directly associated with the basal ganglia thalamic pathways.", 
    "18": "The mode of action of methylxanthines and benzodiazepines are not yet fully elucidated. Interaction with antagonizing effect occurs between these two preparations, probably with influence upon some of the same cellular systems. At least two types of benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebrum have been described. These are presumed to be placed in the neighbourhood of gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) receptors and they probably modify the functions of these. In addition, influence on other transmitter systems in the CNS occurs with release of adenosine and reduction of the acetyl choline content. It has been demonstrated that methylxanthines are adenosine-blocking but they also release catecholamines from the suprarenal cortex and sympathetic nerve-ends both centrally and peripherally. In clinical practice, the antagonistic effect of employing methylxanthines in patients sedated with benzodiazepines has been demonstrated. Administration of 1-2 mg/kg of aminophyllin usually results in immediate effect and these patients woke up immediately after injection. When benzodiazepines and methylxanthines are administered simultaneously the total result will be difficult to predict.", 
    "19": "Molecular mechanics simulations have been presented on the covalent complexes between anthramycin and the decanucleotides d(GCGCGCGCGC)2 and d(GCGCGTGCGC).d(GCGCACGCGC) in the novel Z form, with the drug docked in the minor groove. The simulations predict that anthramycin binds to Z-DNA almost as well as it does to B-DNA, but with a few key differences in the structural aspects of binding. In particular, the 5' orientation of the drug is preferred in the Z form, contrasting with the preference for 3' orientation in the B form and the drug has a left-handed twist. While no experimental studies have been published on the binding of pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepines to left-handed forms of DNA, the energy refined stereochemically satisfactory models provide valuable information which will hopefully simulate high resolution 2-D NMR/NOE studies in solution.", 
    "20": "We reviewed the charts of 476 patients admitted to a university teaching hospital to determine whether sedative-hypnotic drugs (SHDs) were being used excessively and to examine the use of SHDs as hypnotics. The frequency of medical and surgical indications for barbiturates and benzodiazepines or other minor tranquillizers as well as the use of such drugs were compared among different groups of patients and specialty wards. Of the patients 29% had a regular order and 40% had a PRN order; only 77% of the PRN orders were administered. A total of 215 patients (45%) received an SHD during their hospital stay, and 160 (34%) received the drug as a hypnotic. Medical indications accounted for 49% of the regular orders but only 2% of the PRN orders; moreover, 89% of all the PRN orders were for insomnia. On average, patients receiving SHDs as hypnotics were older (p less than 0.05) and stayed longer in hospital (p less than 0.01) than those who did not; however, no patient on the geriatric or pediatric ward received an SHD as a hypnotic during the hospital stay. The differences in use between patient groups may have been influenced by orientation of ward staff. Physicians should review their rationale for prescribing hypnotics and avoid routine orders on admission.",

    "22": "The Authors consider the problems involved in dental treatment of the handicapped patients. Accuracy in diagnosis of the handicap factor, knowledge about its consequences on pathophysiological status and about chronically assumed drugs are the first step: in fact these patients may be affected by a wide variety of physiopathologic and mental diseases. Failure of cooperation requires general anesthesia or sedation techniques. General anesthesia can be dangerous (malignant hyperthermia in myopathies, difficult intubation in facial anomalies, pharmacological interactions); furthermore, its frequent application even in order to perform minimal treatment is often unsuitable. Sedation techniques offer a more convenient possibility, but must be practised by trained operators. Nitrous oxide alone rarely produces in fact a sufficient degree of sedation and is suitable only in patients affected by very slight mental insufficiency. In the other cases, association with various drugs (as benzodiazepines, barbiturates etc) is needed. In such a situation, the active and continuous presence of the anesthesiologist becomes mandatory.", 
    "23": "The effect of the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine-M has been studied on the surface-negative field potential (N-wave) evoked by orthodromic stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract in slices of guinea-pig olfactory cortex. Bath-application of oxotremorine-M (5-80 microM) or carbachol (10-300 microM) produced a reversible depression of the N-wave amplitude without affecting the lateral olfactory tract compound action potential. Oxotremorine-M was approximately 5 times more potent than carbachol in this respect, and the effects of both agonists were competitively blocked by telenzepine (5-100 nM), a selective M1-receptor antagonist. In contrast, methoctramine or AF-DX 116, two 'cardioselective' M2-receptor antagonists, had little or no blocking effect on the agonist responses. It is suggested that oxotremorine-M (like carbachol) inhibits the evoked field potential by activating presynaptic M1-type muscarinic receptors in the olfactory cortex slice.", 
    "24": "The effects of muscarinic ligands on acid secretion were examined by estimating the accumulation of [14C]aminopyrine in gastric glands isolated from guinea pigs. The accumulation of [14C]aminopyrine in the presence of 0.1 mM histamine was potentiated by 1 microM carbachol but suppressed by 1 mM. These two effects of carbachol were abolished by atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. Assuming that the binding of carbachol to one site (Site 1) increases [14C]aminopyrine accumulation but its binding to the other site (Site 2) reduces [14C]aminopyrine accumulation, we analysed the dose-response curves for the carbachol effects in the absence and presence of different concentrations of atropine, pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. The dissociation constants determined for these ligands at Sites 1 and 2 were as follows: carbachol, 0.28 and 7.1 microM; atropine, 0.28 and 0.54 nM; pirenzepine, 45 and 560 nM; and AF-DX 116, 380 and 4400 nM, respectively. The binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine to the gastric glands indicated the presence of two populations of binding sites with different affinities for the above ligands, other than atropine. The apparent dissociation constants, which were estimated by analysing the displacement curves for [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding, were as follows: carbachol, 0.18 microM (10%) and 31 microM (90%); atropine, 1.24 nM; pirenzepine, 15 nM (16%) and 220 nM (84%); and AF-DX 116, 370 nM (10%) and 2970 nM (90%). These results suggest that there are two kinds of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the guinea pig gastric gland, one potentiating and the other inhibiting the acid secretion induced by histamine.",

    "26": "Prolactin (PRL) and other trophic factors rapidly activate a nuclear pool(s) of protein kinase C (nPKC) in purified splenocyte nuclei. The PRL also enhanced [2-3H]glycerol incorporation into nuclear mono- and triacylglycerol. An assay was devised which not only probed the ability of the hormone to activate protein kinase C (PKC) but also demonstrated the presence of nuclear substrates. Using this methodology, a biphasic concentration-response curve to PRL was observed. Heterologous species of PRL and various growth factors also activated nPKC. The PRL-induced nPKC stimulation was antagonized by various immunomodulators, G protein-coupling inhibitors, PKC inhibitors, a calmodulin inhibitor, and a peripheral benzodiazepine agonist and antagonist. A monoclonal antibody to PKC, anti-rat PRL antiserum and a monoclonal anti-rat PRL receptor antibody antagonized PRL-induced PKC-dependent nuclear phosphorylation, further implicating nPKC and a PRL receptor-mediated activation process. Nuclear PKC may be a major target for trophic regulation in response to both positive and negative growth signals.", 
    "27": "The receptor subtypes involved in muscarinic-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and adenylate cyclase inhibition in rat submandibular acinar cells were characterized by comparing the inhibitory potencies of four muscarinic antagonists on the two signal transduction responses. Carbachol-induced phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis was inhibited by all antagonists with a potency rank order of 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) = atropine much greater than pirenzepine much greater than AF-DX 116 (P less than 0.01). The same rank order was observed in antagonist-reversal of the reduction of cAMP caused by carbachol in the model. These findings suggest that muscarinic effects are mediated by M3 receptors in both the phosphoinositide and adenylate cyclase pathways in the submandibular gland.", 
    "28": "Rats were trained to discriminate flumazenil (15 mg/kg i.p.) from vehicle in a two-lever, food-reinforced, operant conditioning procedure. Substitution tests were performed with a wide dose range of flumazenil and of several benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine compounds possessing behavioural effects similar to or opposite to those of benzodiazepine agonists. The results indicate that low doses of flumazenil have behavioural effects, that the flumazenil cue has a low degree of specificity and is most strongly related to the stimulus properties of benzodiazepines.", 
    "29": "The mechanisms underlying tolerance to benzodiazepines were investigated by injecting diazepam (5 mg/kg) twice daily for 23 days in WAG/Rij rats (an animal model for non-convulsive absence epilepsy). After this the rats received either the agonist, diazepam, or the antagonist, flumazenil (Ro 15-1788). EEG analyses showed that both compounds increased the amount of absence epilepsy-like phenomena. This suggests that repeated administration of diazepam moves the benzodiazepine receptor spectrum towards the inverse agonist end.", 
    "30": "Rats treated for 3 days with diazepam demonstrated a clear anxiolytic action of the drug as assessed in the elevated plus-maze. However, in a chronic experiment, in which all rats were handled for 28 days, no anxiolytic effect of diazepam could be shown either in rats treated for 3 days or in those treated for 28 days. These results suggest that there is an interaction between handling and the anxiolytic effect of diazepam.", 
    "31": "Tomaymycin is a member of the pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine [P(1,4)B] antitumor antibiotic group. This antibiotic is proposed to react with the exocyclic 2-amino group (N2) of guanine to form a covalent adduct that lies snugly within the minor groove of DNA. While DNA-footprinting experiments using methidiumpropyl-EDTA have revealed the favored bonding sequences for tomaymycin and related drugs on DNA, the stereochemistry at the covalent bonding site (C-11) and orientation in the minor groove were not established by these experiments. In previous studies using a combined fluorescence, high-field NMR, and molecular modeling approach, we have shown that for tomaymycin there are two diastereomeric species (11R and 11S) on both calf thymus DNA and d(ATGCAT)2. Although we were able to infer the identity (stereochemistry at C-11 and orientation in the minor groove) of the two species on d(ATGCAT)2 by high-field NMR and fluorescence studies, in combination with molecular mechanics calculations, definitive experimental evidence was lacking. We have designed and synthesized a self-complementary 12-mer [d(CICGAATTCICG)2] based on the Dickerson dodecamer [d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2] that bonds identically two tomaymycin molecules, each having a defined orientation and stereochemistry. Thus the bis(tomaymycin)-12-mer adduct maintains the self-complementarity of the original duplex molecule. Two-dimensional proton J-correlated spectroscopy (COSY) of the bis(tomaymycin)-d(CICGAATTCICG)2 adduct (I = inosine) unequivocally shows that C-11 of tomaymycin covalently bonds through N2 of guanine with an 11S stereochemistry in the sequence 5'-CGA-3'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "32": "Intraperitoneal administration of thymopentin, a thymopentin II-derived pentapeptide, had no stable and evident effect in the two anxiety models (elevated plus-maze and licking-conflict test) studied. However, in the elevated plus-maze test thymopentin antagonized the behavioral effects of DMCM, a beta-carboline derivative with anxiogenic properties. Further, it was demonstrated that the licking-conflict test procedure itself produced a significant elevation of plasma corticosterone levels, increased the number of [3H]flunitrazepam and decreased the number of [3H]muscimol binding sites in rat hippocampus. The forced-swimming stress similarly to the licking-conflict test also caused an increase in hippocampal [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites. Although ineffective behaviorally in the tests for anxiety, thymopentin pretreatment effectively reversed the changes in corticosterone levels caused by the licking-conflict test. Moreover, it normalized the changed number of benzodiazepine and GABA receptors after stressful stimuli. It is well known that not all anxiolytic drugs (i.e. buspirone) are equally active in behavioral tests for anxiety. According to our data we propose that thymopentin has stress-protective activity. As in vivo and in vitro thymopentin did not change [3H]-flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding, the direct effect of this peptide on the GABA-benzodiazepine-Cl- ionophore receptor complex is unlikely. The action of this peptide on GABA release and/or metabolism can be suggested.", 
    "33": "Polyclonal antibodies were raised against synthetic peptides whose sequences were from unique regions of the bovine gamma-aminobutyrateA receptor alpha 1, alpha 2, and alpha 3 subunits. The anti-alpha 1 324-341, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424, and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibodies all specifically immunoprecipitated [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding activities in parallel from Na+ deoxycholate extracts of bovine cerebral cortex. The maximum number of benzodiazepine binding sites immunoprecipitated by each antibody in three brain regions, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and hippocampus, was investigated. Differences were found for both the maximum number of sites immunoprecipitated by each antibody in one brain region and for the percentage of benzodiazepine binding sites immunoprecipitated by one specificity antibody between the different brain regions. Furthermore, it was found that co-immunoprecipitation with either anti-alpha 1 324-341, anti-Cys alpha 2 414-424, and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 or anti-alpha 1 324-341 and anti-Cys alpha 3 454-467 antibodies resulted in an increase in the percentage of benzodiazepine binding sites immunoprecipitated, the sum of which was equal to the percentages pelleted by the individual antibodies. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence in mammalian brain of gamma-aminobutyrateA receptor alpha subunit iso-oligomers.", 
    "34": "Testicular mitochondria were previously shown to contain an abundance of peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition site(s)/receptor(s) (PBR). We have previously purified, cloned, and expressed an Mr 18,000 PBR protein (Antkiewicz-Michaluk, Mukhin, A. G., Guidotti, A., and Krueger, K. E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 17317-17321; (Sprengel, R., Werner, P., Seeburg, P. H., Mukhin, A. G., Santi, M. R., Grayson, D. R., Guidotti, A., and Krueger, K. E. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20415-20421); and in this report, we present evidence that PBR are functionally linked to Leydig cell steroid biosynthesis. A spectrum of nine different ligands covering a range of over 4 orders of magnitude in their affinities for PBR were tested for their potencies to modulate steroidogenesis in the MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cell line. The Ki for inhibition of [3H]1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide binding and the EC50 for steroid biosynthesis for this series of compounds showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0.95. The most potent ligands stimulated steroid production by approximately 4-fold in these cells. This stimulation was not inhibited by cycloheximide, unlike human chorionic gonadotropin- or cyclic AMP-activated steroidogenesis. The action of PBR ligands was not additive to stimulation by human chorionic gonadotropin or cyclic AMP, but was additive to that of epidermal growth factor, another regulator of MA-10 Leydig cell steroidogenesis. Moreover, PBR ligands stimulated, in a dose-dependent manner, pregnenolone biosynthesis by isolated mitochondria when supplied with exogenous cholesterol. This effect was not observed with mitoplasts (mitochondria devoid of the outer membrane). Cytochrome P-450 side chain cleavage activity, as measured by metabolism of (22R)-hydroxycholesterol, was not affected by PBR ligands in intact cells. Similar results were also obtained with purified rat Leydig cells. In conclusion, PBR are implicated in the acute stimulation of Leydig cell steroidogenesis possibly by mediating the entry, distribution, and/or availability of cholesterol within mitochondria.", 
    "35": "The effects of bombesin on the growth of the gastroduodenal mucosa and the pancreas have been examined in adult rats with intact or resected antrum and following administration of somatostatin or CCK-receptor antagonist L-364,718. The peptides were administered three times daily for 7 consecutive days, and then the animals were sacrificed and growth parameters (organ weight and RNA and DNA contents) were determined, and plasma gastrin and CCK were assayed. Compared with the control (saline) values, bombesin significantly stimulated the growth of the oxyntic and duodenal mucosa and the pancreas. These effects were partly reduced but not abolished by somatostatin, antrectomy and L-364,718, suggesting that bombesin may enhance the growth partly by releasing gastrin and CCK and partly by direct action on these tissues.", 
    "36": "The development of inhibitory receptors in rat spinal cord was investigated by autoradiography using [3H]flunitrazepam as a ligand for benzodiazepine receptors and [3H]strychnine as a ligand for glycine receptors. The development of benzodiazepine receptors follows a similar pattern at all levels of the spinal cord. The density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites is already high at birth, increases 2-fold by days 3-7 and thereafter declines to levels already present at birth. In contrast, [3H]strychnine binding sites are weakly expressed at birth and increase up to 7-fold between days 4 and 21. A craniocaudal gradient in the development of glycine receptors is not apparent. However, maturation of [3H]strychnine binding in the ventral horn precedes that in the dorsal horn for 3-4 days. In summary, the developmental expression of these two inhibitory receptors in the spinal cord appears to be regulated differently.", 
    "37": "Incubation of membrane preparations from rat brain with S-adenosyl-L-methionine resulted in methylation of the lipid fraction. Neither [3H]diazepam nor [3H]muscimol (a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist) binding was affected by this incubation. In contrast, when [3H]diazepam binding was stimulated by GABA, the methylation caused both a decrease of the minimal GABA concentration needed to produce its effect (10(-9) M instead of 10(-7) M) and an enhancement (from 36 to 66% over basal) of the GABA-stimulated [3H]diazepam binding.", 
    "38": "Binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor-chloride channel complex has been shown to be altered by Tyr-MIF-1 (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2). This raised the possibility of allosteric binding interactions between Tyr-MIF-1 sites and the GABAA receptor complex. We tested this possibility in rat brain by examining the binding of Tyr-MIF-1 to brain membranes in the presence of clonazepam, GABA, a combination of clonazepam and GABA, RO15788, or picrotoxinin. None of the tested substances affected Tyr-MIF-1 binding. We also tested mouse cortex for changes in Tyr-MIF-1 binding in the presence of ligands that bind to the GABA/benzodiazepine/chloride channel complex. Clonazepam, flunitrazepam, RO15788, and picrotoxinin at concentrations ranging from 10(-13) to 10(-5) M, each in the absence or presence of GABA at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-5) M, each in the absence or presence of GABA at concentrations ranging from 10(-9) to 10(-6) M, did not significantly alter the binding of Tyr-MIF-1. The results indicate that simple bidirectional allosteric interactions between Tyr-MIF-1 binding sites and benzodiazepine, GABA or chloride channel binding sites are not likely to be the mechanism by which Tyr-MIF-1 affects binding at this complex.", 
    "39": "The hypnotic efficacy of estazolam, a triazolobenzodiazepine, has been established in well-controlled sleep laboratory and outpatient clinical trials. Estazolam 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg significantly improves sleep latency, total sleep time, number of nocturnal awakenings, depth of sleep, and sleep quality in adults with chronic insomnia. Long-term studies indicate that estazolam 2.0 mg remains an effective hypnotic for at least six weeks of continuous nightly administration with no evidence of clinically significant tolerance. Estazolam is an effective treatment for situational insomnia and significantly improves sleep in patients with insomnia associated with moderately severe anxiety or depression.", 
    "40": "Evaluation of the effects of hypnotics on waking behavior has primarily focused on two issues: (1) how these drugs affect performance the day after a nightly dose; and (2) how they affect memory processes, with special emphasis on anterograde amnesia. In terms of the relations between pharmacologic properties and residual effects, three conclusions can be drawn. First, dose is a major determinant of the presence or absence of morning effects. Every drug studied to date, if given in high enough dose, has produced morning performance decrements. Second, the longer-acting a compound, the more likely it is that a performance decrement will be observed. Finally, some data suggest that behavioral tolerance to the residual effects of hypnotics develops. The observation that benzodiazepines produce amnesia emerged from reports of their clinical use as presurgery medications. Although the initial reports involved intravenous diazepam and were anecdotal in nature, subsequent studies have demonstrated that amnesia is a characteristic of all the benzodiazepines, with the magnitude of the effect being a function of route of administration, dose, and the pharmacokinetics of the particular drug.", 
    "41": "Rebound insomnia is a sleep disturbance that occurs on discontinuation of benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs. It has been reported in both patients and healthy normal subjects and is characterized by increased wakefulness above the person's baseline levels. This article reviews that available information regarding determinants, possible mechanisms, and clinical significance of rebound insomnia. It is concluded that rebound insomnia is a disturbance of one or two nights' duration that primarily follows discontinuation of short- to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines. It occurs at high doses of a given drug, beyond which no additional hypnotic efficacy is evident. There seem to be clear individual differences in the experience of rebound insomnia, but no prospective studies have established which differences predict rebound. It is likely to be avoided by initiating treatment with the lowest effective dose and tapering the dose upon discontinuation.", 
    "42": "General practice physicians commonly deal with patients who report experiencing insomnia. Advances in our understanding of insomnia should result in much more effective diagnosis and therapeutic intervention for insomnia patients at the primary care level. This presentation highlights the new knowledge of insomnia pertinent to general practice physicians and discusses the rational use of hypnotic medications in primary care.", 
    "43": "Complaints of insomnia and disordered sleep are pervasive among the elderly, and reduced total sleep time and changes in sleep architecture are considered to be normal in the aging process. Additionally, numerous medical and psychiatric disorders that are highly prevalent in the geriatric population are known to affect sleep adversely. Epidemiologic data indicate that at least 5 million older adults suffer severe disorders of sleep and that most people with severe insomnia receive no treatment for this troubling symptom. However, although the elderly comprise only about 12 percent of the American population, between 35 and 40 percent of all prescriptions for sedative hypnotics are written for people over the age of 60. Moreover, approximately 23 percent of Americans over age 85 reside in long-term care facilities, and institutionalization is an important risk factor for disordered sleep and for sedative hypnotic prescription. Consequently, the evaluation of any sedative hypnotic agent must include substantial assessment of efficacy, safety, and tolerance in geriatric patients.", 
    "44": "The benzodiazepines are sedative hypnotic drugs, i.e., central nervous system depressant drugs, that may adversely affect the control of ventilation during sleep. Prescription of these drugs may worsen sleep-related breathing disorders, especially in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiac failure. The most frequent users of sedative hypnotics are the polymorbid elderly with a secondary complaint of insomnia. Although the benzodiazepines may reduce sleep fragmentation, their long-term use may also cause health problems, such as complete obstructive sleep apnea in heavy snorers or short repetitive central sleep apnea in patients with recent myocardial infarction. Since drugs of this class vary in their effects, it is crucial to note the action of a given benzodiazepine on the control of vital functions during sleep.", 
    "45": "The pharmacokinetics of estazolam were examined in 17 healthy male subjects. Plasma concentration-time profiles were compared following the oral administration of one 1-mg tablet, two 1-mg tablets, and one 2-mg tablet. No statistically significant differences were detected among the mean time of maximal plasma concentration (Tmax), maximal plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to 72 hours (AUC), or half-life values for the 2-mg doses. Mean Cmax was 97.7 and 98.6 ng/ml and mean Tmax was 1.9 and 1.6 hours for two 1-mg tablets and one 2-mg tablet, respectively. Proportionately decreased Cmax and AUC were observed following the 1-mg dose. Mean Cmax was 54.7 ng/ml for the 1-mg dose. Mean Tmax and elimination half-life values were similar to those observed after the 2-mg doses. The overall harmonic mean half-life was 14.4 hours.", 
    "46": "Benzodiazepine derivatives are presumed to exert their pharmacologic activity via interaction with specific molecular recognition sites, termed benzodiazepine receptors, within the brain. The various benzodiazepines used in clinical practice differ considerably in their intrinsic receptor affinity, but the qualitative character of the drug-receptor interaction is similar or identical among this class of drugs. All benzodiazepines are lipophilic (lipid-soluble) substances that relatively rapidly cross the blood-brain barrier and equilibrate with brain tissue. After equilibrium is attained, a constant brain:plasma ratio is maintained, such that plasma concentrations proportionately reflect concentrations of drug in brain. Brain concentrations are proportional to the extent of receptor occupancy, which in turn determines the acute behavioral effect. Clinical differences among benzodiazepines largely reflect differences in pharmacokinetic properties. The onset of action after single oral doses reflects the rate of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, whereas the duration of action is determined by the rate and extent of drug distribution to peripheral tissues, as well as by the rate of elimination and clearance. During multiple dosage, long half-life drugs accumulate, with the concurrent possibility of daytime sedation. However, a benefit of long half-life drugs is that rebound insomnia on abrupt termination is unlikely. Short half-life drugs accumulate minimally and have a lower likelihood of producing daytime sedation. However, they may be more likely to produce rebound insomnia on abrupt discontinuation.", 
    "47": "The safety profile of estazolam, a new triazolobenzodiazepine hypnotic medication, has been developed in 1,320 normal volunteers and patients with insomnia. No clinically significant effects of estazolam on vital signs or laboratory values were detected. Drug-specific adverse effects such as somnolence, dizziness, hypokinesia, and abnormal coordination occurred, but these are expected extensions of benzodiazepine pharmacologic activity. No consistent effects on psychomotor performance, including memory, were seen at the recommended hypnotic doses in insomniac subjects. These data, combined with the evidence for hypnotic activity, indicate that estazolam is a safe and effective treatment for insomnia.", 
    "48": "The present review deals with preventive and treatment strategies for sleep and wake disorders, and the other problems of shift workers. Management must take into account the direction, speed and other parameters of the rotation schedule. Good sleep-wake hygiene may alleviate the problems. Further, additional napping may compensate - at least partially - for sleep deprivation and fatigue. Hypnotics must be avoided as much as possible. Finally, new techniques for manipulation of circadian rhythms are discussed: light, melatonin and benzodiazepines.", 
    "49": "While adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute to excessive health care costs through increased patient morbidity and mortality, most hospital ADR reporting programs are ineffective in documenting the adverse reactions to drugs that occur in their institutions. Furthermore, the ADR reporting programs have an untapped potential as a quality assurance (QA) tool; ADR reports provide a means of identifying potential problems in patient care. If 10-20% of hospitalized patients develop adverse effects while taking medications and over 50% of the iatrogenic events are avoidable, educational strategies and prospective monitoring could reduce this significant cause of patient morbidity. At Memorial Hospital (Ormond Beach, FL), routine QA screening detected a potential problem with the use of Halcion (triazolam). A plan of action, which included a drug use evaluation (DUE), educational efforts, and hypnotic prescribing guidelines was developed to address and resolve the concerns raised by initial ADR reports.", 
    "50": "Thirty women who met DSM-III-R criteria for late luteal phase dysphoric disorder completed a double-blind, randomly assigned crossover treatment study comparing alprazolam with placebo. Alprazolam was found to be superior to placebo. The outcome measures included physicians' global ratings as well as patients' prospective (daily) ratings and retrospective assessments. Improved study design, which addressed methodologic flaws of most previous studies of treatment outcome of \"premenstrual syndrome\" may account, in part, for our ability to demonstrate significant drug/placebo differences. This includes extensive screening to eliminate women who had premenstrual exacerbations of a more persistent mental illness rather than a discrete premenstrual disorder, use of prospective ratings to confirm retrospective reports of symptom patterns, placebo washout before randomization, and use of patients as their own controls.", 
    "51": "Immediately before they underwent femoral angiography, 45 patients were given one of three types of audiotapes: a relaxation response tape recorded for this study, a tape of contemporary instrumental music, or a blank tape. All patients were instructed to listen to their audiotape during the entire angiographic procedure. Each audiotape was played through earphones. Radiologists were not told the group assignment or tape contents. The patients given the audiotape with instructions to elicit the relaxation response (n = 15) experienced significantly less anxiety (P less than .05) and pain (P less than .001) during the procedure, were observed by radiology nurses to exhibit significantly less pain (P less than .001) and anxiety (P less than .001), and requested significantly less fentanyl citrate (P less than .01) and diazepam (P less than .01) than patients given either the music (n = 14) or the blank (n = 16) control audiotapes. Elicitation of the relaxation response is a simple, inexpensive, efficacious, and practical method to reduce pain, anxiety, and medication during femoral angiography and may be useful in other invasive procedures.", 
    "52": "A Cyclic voltammetric study was made of lorazepam. The best defined cyclic voltammograms were found to be those obtained at pH = 7 with a sweep rate of 600 mv/s. A method is proposed for the determination of lorazepam and was applied to such determination in pharmaceutical preparations; relative errors of less than 3% and relative standard deviation less than 2% were obtained.", 
    "53": "The effects of the classical benzodiazepine (BDZ) anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and the non-BDZ anxiolytic agent buspirone (BUSP) on basal and stress-induced plasma noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A) and corticosterone (CS) release were investigated. Male Wistar rats provided with a permanent heart catheter and a permanent stomach catheter were used. Placement of rats into an unfamiliar cage (novel environment stress; NES), that elevated CS, NA and A, was used as a stressor. Acute administration of CDP (1-27 mg/kg) produced dose-related increases in basal plasma CS secretion but was without effect on basal NA content. The largest dose of CDP caused a slight short-term A elevation. The CDP effect on basal CS secretion tolerated with repeated drug treatment and was completely blocked after acute pretreatment with the BDZ receptor antagonist flumazenil. Acute treatment with BUSP (2-20 mg/kg) caused a marked and dose dependent increase in the plasma levels of A, NA and CS. A medium dose of CDP (9 mg/kg) attenuated the NES-induced CS and A elevations. A high dose of CDP (27 mg/kg), that elevated basal CS release, prevented a further CS increase by NES and inhibited the NA and A response to NES. BUSP (2 or 20 mg/kg) was not effective in attenuating the NES-elicited rise of CS, NA and A. However, the 20 mg/kg dose of BUSP actually enhanced the NES-induced A response. In conclusion, BUSP did not show the BDZ-like property to inhibit stress-induced elevations in CS, NA and A. Furthermore, the findings suggest that CDP and BUSP differentially affect the mechanisms controlling CS, NA and A release during basal and stress conditions.", 
    "54": "In acute alcohol intoxication, treatment is symptomatic and consists of correcting any physiological dysfunctions, as possible acid-basic or electrolytic disorders hypoglycemia, hypovitaminosis changes and of maintaining respiratory tracts open. Recently, in some cases of acute intoxication, metadoxine has been used with success, being capable of accelerating the urinary elimination of ethanol and acetaldehyde. Moreover, further studies have shown that Ro 15-4513 (an inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors) reduces the anaesthesia time induced by high doses of ethanol in rats. On the other hand, as far as the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is concerned, drugs commonly used are: alcohol itself, chloral hydrate, paraldehyde, barbiturates, chlormetizole and benzodiazepines (administered at high doses). Very recent experiments have been carried out using gammahydroxybutyric acid (GHB), which can produce a rapid and complete suppression of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. In epileptic patients, it is suitable to administer anticonvulsivant drugs together with the above compounds. In alcohol dependence two main treatment strategies are followed, the first is the administration of inhibitory drugs of aldehyde dehydrogenase (disulfiram, calciumcyanamide) which, if given before alcohol consumption, produce unpleasant and avversive reactions, due to the accumulation of acetaldehyde in the blood. Other drugs, recently used with great success, remove the desire to drink without producing those unpleasant reactions described for disulfiram; amongst these are GHB and serotonin uptake inhibitors (fluoxetine, zimelidine).", 
    "55": "1. The effects of muscarine upon intracardiac neurones cultured from ganglia within the atria and interatrial septum of the newborn guinea-pig heart were studied using intracellular recording techniques. 2. Muscarine applied to the neuronal soma typically produced a biphasic change in membrane potential which consisted of a small hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization. In addition, muscarine (0.01-10 microM) inhibited the calcium-dependent, after-hyperpolarization (AHP) and greatly increased the number of action potentials that could be evoked by a given depolarizing current. 3. The hyperpolarization was associated with a decrease in input resistance and it reversed to become a depolarization at a potential of -86.5 mV. This response was antagonized by 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP; 100 nM) and AF-DX 116 (500 nM), but was unaffected by pirenzepine (0.1-5 microM). 4. Two types of slow depolarization were observed in the presence of muscarine. The most common was associated with an increase in input resistance in the potential range -70 to -40 mV. Pirenzepine (100 nM) selectively antagonized this response, 4-DAMP (100 nM) similarly antagonized the response, but was non-selective. AF-DX 116 (0.5-5 microM) showed no antagonist effect. The less common depolarization (5% of cells) had a long latency and was associated with a decrease in input resistance. 5. Muscarine reduced the duration of the action potential and inhibited the AHP. Cadmium chloride (100 microM) mimicked these actions of muscarine. Application of muscarine immediately following a train of action potentials did not inhibit the AHP, suggesting that muscarine did not directly inhibit the calcium-activated potassium current (IK(Ca)). Muscarine-induced depression of the slow AHP was antagonized by 4-DAMP (100 nM) but was not antagonized by either pirenzepine (0.1-0.5 microM) or AF-DX 116 (0.5-5 microM). 6. It is concluded that the muscarine-induced depolarization of guinea-pig intracardiac neurones results from reduction of a potassium conductance similar to the M-conductance, through activation of M1 muscarinic receptors. The hyperpolarization results from an increase in potassium conductance, through activation of M2 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "56": "To study the long-term effects of prenatal diazepam (DZ) exposure, 31P NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectra and levels of thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive material were measured in the brains of rats from 3 to 26 months of age. In control rats, there were aging-related increases in levels of TBA-reactive material, decreases in intracellular pH (pHi) and alterations in phosphocreatine (PCr) utilization. Prenatal (late gestational) DZ exposure induced lasting, dose-related and age-related alterations in levels of TBA-reactive material and pHi. The results indicate that the prenatal chemical environment can influence cellular metabolism throughout the lifetime of the organism, and that the process of aging can in turn interact with the consequences of prenatal drug exposure.", 
    "57": "Inclusion complexes of clobazam with alpha-, beta-, gamma-cyclodextrins (CyDs) and heptakis(2.6-di-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin (DM-beta-CyD) in aqueous solution and in the solid phase were studied by the solubility method, infrared (IR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffractometry. In addition, inclusion complex of clobazam with heptakis(2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-beta-cyclodextrin and the solid dispersion of clobazam with methyl cellulose (MC) in a ground mixture were investigated by IR, DSC and X-ray diffractometry. It was observed that DM-beta-CyD had the highest stability constant among the four CyDs in solution. Thermal and X-ray diffraction analyses showed that clobazam molecules existed in a molecularly dispersed state in the ground mixture of CyDs. Infrared spectra showed lower frequency shifts in the case of the ground mixtures of clobazam with natural CyDs, which can be attributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the two carbonyl groups of clobazam and hydroxyl groups of natural CyDs. In contrast, higher frequency shifts were observed in the case of the ground mixtures of clobazam with methylated CyDs and MC and these were considered to be due to the monomolecular dispersion of clobazam in a hydrophobic environment. The mode of interaction of clobazam with DM-beta-CyD was different from that with natural CyDs in the ground mixtures. Furthermore, the crystalline inclusion complex of clobazam with DM-beta-CyD was obtained by heating of the coprecipitate in vacuo at 120 degrees C for 1 h.", 
    "58": "The effects of mianserin, a tetracyclic antidepressant, and adinazolam, a new triazolobenzodiazepine which has antidepressant activity, on intraventricular conduction and the incidence of arrhythmias induced by programmed ventricular stimulation were studied in the dog heart after myocardial infarction and compared to the effects of amitriptyline, a standard tricyclic antidepressant. Amitriptyline at a dose of 1 mg/kg significantly slowed ventricular conduction in a frequency-dependent manner and at doses of 2 and 3 mg/kg significantly slowed ventricular conduction in infarcted ventricular myocardium. Amitriptyline also significantly slowed ventricular conduction in normal myocardium. Amitriptyline increased the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias induced by the programmed ventricular stimulation and prolonged the intraventricular delayed conduction resulting in re-entrant ventricular arrhythmia. On the other hand, mianserin and adinazolam at doses of 1-3 mg/kg had no significant effects on intraventricular conduction in infarcted and normal myocardium and on the incidence of arrhythmias induced by programmed ventricular stimulation. From these results, we can expect that mianserin and adinazolam may have a much lower cardiac toxicity than amitriptyline.",

    "60": "The effects of unilateral cortical infarction on subcortical (striatal) muscarinic receptors in rat brain were studied by means of in vitro receptor autoradiography using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate ([3H]QNB) and [3H]pirenzepine. The cortical lesions could be produced without compromising subcortical structures. A dramatic (20 to 59 per cent) increase in striatal [3H]QNB binding was observed ipsilateral to the damaged cortex. The increase in binding was greatest in the caudate-putamen, but was also noted in the nucleus accumbens. [3H]Pirenzepine binding (labeling M1 receptors) was also increased but to a lesser degree, as was [3H]QNB binding in the presence of 100 nM (unlabeled) pirenzepine (an indirect means of labeling M2 receptors). The results show that unilateral cortical infarction results in an upregulation of striatal muscarinic receptors, and suggest that both the M1 and M2 subtypes contribute to this effect. These findings provide evidence for cortical modulation of intrastriatal cholinergic transmission.", 
    "61": "Selective outbreeding for high and low acute alcohol sensitivity has produced two rat lines (alcohol-sensitive ANT and alcohol-insensitive AT lines) that also differ in their sensitivity to GABAergic drugs, benzodiazepines and barbiturates. These rats were now compared in two behavioral tests believed to involve central GABAergic mechanisms, in elevated plus-maze test and in 3-mercaptopropionate-induced seizure test. The AT animals spent more time in the open arms of the plus-maze than the ANT rats, suggesting that the AT's behave less anxiously. The ANT's were more susceptible to seizures induced by 3-mercaptopropionate (50 mg/kg, IP) than the AT's, suggesting the ANT's having greater sensitivity to a decrease in brain GABA concentration. At the time of the first seizure signs, there was a tendency, though a nonsignificant one, to greater decreases in brain GABA in the ANT's than AT's. These results suggest that there are differences in GABA-related behaviors between ethanol-naive rats of the lines produced by selective outbreeding for differences in alcohol sensitivity. In theory, these behavioral line differences might physiologically counteract alcohol effects in the ANT's and enhance them in the AT's. In elevated plus-maze test, however, an acute dose of ethanol (1 g/kg, IP) significantly changed the behavior of the ANT animals, but only up to level of the AT rats. The apparent sensitivity to ethanol may thus be dependent on the naive behavior of the alcohol-insensitive AT and alcohol-sensitive ANT rats.", 
    "62": "Age-related changes in central cholinergic muscarinic receptors were measured in young (3-6 month), middle-aged (15-17 month), and aged (22-26 month) male Fisher 344 rats by receptor binding techniques. Using [3H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate as the ligand, a significant decrease (14-19%) in the number of muscarinic cortical receptors was measured in aged rats compared to both young and middle-aged rats. With the selective M1 antagonist, [3H]-pirenzepine, a 17% decrease in receptor density was observed in the cortex of aged animals compared to young rats. For both ligands no differences were observed in the striatum or hippocampus between any age group and there was no change in affinity (Kd) in any of the three brain regions for the three age groups. Additionally, there was no difference in choline acetyltransferase activity measured in cortex, hippocampus, or striatum of young and aged rats. Thus, there is a loss of M1 muscarinic receptors in the cerebral cortex of aged male Fisher 344 rats.", 
    "63": "Pigeons were trained in a cumulative dosing procedure to emit one response in the presence of 15 mg/kg phenytoin and another response in the absence of phenytoin. After reliable discrimination was established, generalization tests with other anticonvulsant drugs were conducted. Ethosuximide (20-120 mg/kg) and methsuximide (25-100 mg/kg) engendered very little phenytoin-appropriate responding. Clonazepam (0.125-1 mg/kg) engendered more phenytoin-appropriate responding, but less than the training dose of phenytoin. Similar results were obtained when these drugs were administered in conventional single dose per session generalization tests. When tested in that fashion, mephenytoin (80 and 160 mg/kg) engendered some phenytoin-appropriate responding, but less than the training dose of phenytoin. Administering 10 mg/kg pentylenetetrazol in combination with 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg/kg cumulative doses of phenytoin reduced phenytoin-appropriate responding relative to levels obtained with these doses of phenytoin alone.", 
    "64": "Although narcotics and benzodiazepines are widely used as premedications for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures, we have found a significant number of patients in whom this combination is either inadequate for sedation or results in paradoxical agitation. Over the last 54 months, we have administered droperidol, a neuroleptic, as an adjunct to narcotics and benzodiazepines in 764 patients undergoing 1,102 procedures. The most common indication for droperidol usage was active alcohol abuse or withdrawal (45%). The most frequent dose administered was 2.5 mg (41.1%) followed by 3.75 mg (25.8%). The level of sedation and cooperation was adequate in all but 22 procedures (2.0%). Complications related to droperidol use were infrequent, occurring in 17 procedures (1.5%). There was no mortality or major morbidity resulting from droperidol usage. In our endoscopic population, we find droperidol to be a safe and efficacious adjunctive agent for conscious sedation.", 
    "65": "Natural killer cell activity was compared in the Long-Sleep and Short-Sleep mouse lines. These mice, initially selected for their sensitivities to a hypnotic dose of ethanol, are also differentially sensitive to other agents which act through the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex. Natural killer cell activity was 40-59% lower in Short-Sleep when compared to Long-Sleep mice. Flow cytofluorometric analysis demonstrated that the number of Nk-1+ cells was also lower in the spleens of Short-Sleep than Long-Sleep mice. In addition, the incidence of 3-methylcholanthrene-induced tumors was significantly greater in Short-Sleep (85.7%) than in Long-Sleep (14.3%) mice. These results suggest that the Long-Sleep and Short-Sleep mouse lines may represent a unique model to assess the physiological role of the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor chloride ionophore complex in the neural modulation of immune function.", 
    "66": "The hemodynamic effects of a mixture of midazolam (1.0 mg/kg), xylazine (0.44 mg/kg), and butorphanol (0.1 mg/kg) were evaluated in six adult dogs. The dogs were anesthetized with isoflurane for instrumentation. As the dogs returned to consciousness, baseline values were recorded and the midazolam-xylazine-butorphanol mixture and glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg) were administered intravenously (IV). Hemodynamic data were recorded 3, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes after injection. Mean arterial pressure (AP), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP), heart rate (HR), rate-pressure product (RPP), mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), systemic vascular resistance (SVR), and right ventricular stroke work index (RVSWI) were increased significantly above baseline values. Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), cardiac index (CI), stroke index (SI), mean central venous pressure (CVP), and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) were decreased significantly below baseline values. When administered IV at the dosages used in this study, midazolam-xylazine-butorphanol-glycopyrrolate induced profound acute alterations in several critical hemodynamic variables.", 
    "67": "Rats were trained to discriminate toluene (100 mg/kg, IP) from vehicle in a two-lever operant task. Acquisition of the discrimination required a range of 85-219 training days. Injections of either methohexital (0.5-10 mg/kg) or oxazepam (0.5-20 mg/kg) produced toluene-lever responding in a dose-dependent fashion in most animals. The discriminative stimulus properties of toluene were not found to generalize to chlorpromazine (0.3-10 mg/kg). These results are consistent with those obtained in the mouse and provide further evidence that toluene has stimulus properties similar to those of CNS depressant drugs. These results further suggest that toluene may have drug abuse potential of the CNS depressant type.", 
    "68": "On six occasions spaced at least a week apart, two groups of rats were subjected to a variety of stressful conditions consisting of a restraint/bright light complex, either alone or in combination with a tail pinch, whole-body inversion, or partial immersion in cold water. One of these groups was injected with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg) 30 min prior to the stressors, while the other group experienced the drug in their home cages the following day. A third group also received the diazepam but was not exposed to the stressors. In three test sessions all animals were injected with either diazepam or saline and were then exposed to a novel stressor: a plus-maze used as a screening device for anxiolytic drugs. This was immediately followed by a tail-flick measure of analgesia. The longest tail-flick latencies, indicating stress-induced analgesia (\"autoanalgesia\"), were observed in the group that had not been exposed to stress prior to testing. The other two groups exhibited substantially shorter latencies but did not differ from one another, thus showing a \"stress inoculation\" effect that was uninfluenced by diazepam. In the plus-maze, diazepam tends to increase the amount of time rats will spend in the two exposed arms of the maze relative to the two enclosed arms. This effect was significantly attenuated in the group that had previously experienced the variety of stressors after a diazepam injection, suggesting a learned association between drug and stress that resulted in a diminution of the drug's anxiolytic property.", 
    "69": "Memory function was assessed with a recognition memory test in 40 dental patients before and after sedation with i.v. midazolam or inhalation of isoflurane. The two groups were comparable, but there was a significant impairment of memory (P less than 0.001) at the time of discharge for both words and faces after midazolam, but not after isoflurane.", 
    "70": "A number of anticonvulsant drugs were studied for their efficacy in preventing seizures and death from intoxication with cocaine. Rats were first pretreated with the test drug then subjected to large doses of intraperitoneally administered cocaine. In this model, control animals developed seizures in approximately 6 min, followed by death in approximately 10 min. Statistically significant protection against seizures and death was afforded by pretreatment with diazepam, phenobarbitol and the blocker of the uptake of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), SKF 100330A. Only partial protection was afforded by the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist MK 801, the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil and the novel aminobenzamide, LY 201116. Valproic acid and phenytoin demonstrated limited efficacy against cocaine-induced seizures, without consistently reducing death. Carbamazepine and ethosuximide did not significantly reduce seizures or death. In this model of acute cocaine toxicity, the anticonvulsants diazepam, phenobarbital and the blocker of the uptake of GABA, SKF 100330A were the most effective in protecting rats from cocaine-induced seizures and death. These data offer insight into future approaches for the treatment of patients with the acute toxic effects of cocaine.", 
    "71": "This study was performed to assess the severity and duration of hypoxia during and after prolonged upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Twenty patients were studied using a non-invasive pulse oximeter. Significant reductions in oxygen saturation were noted during endoscopy and remained below the preexamination level during the one hour period after the examination. This study indicates that pulse oximetry is a useful monitor for detection of hypoxia during and after endoscopy.", 
    "72": "The effects of midazolam on the EEG were related to plasma midazolam concentrations in 8 healthy male volunteers in order to develop a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. The EEG parameters were derived by aperiodic analysis. The EEG was recorded between Fp1-M1 and Fp2-M2. Following a 15-minute baseline EEG registration, midazolam 15 mg was given intravenously over 5 minutes. Venous blood samples were taken until 8 hours after the start of the infusion. Within 2 to 4 minutes of starting the infusion all subjects became asleep, with loss of eyelid reflex. The most obvious EEG changes, in the beta frequency range (12 to 30 Hz), were observed within 2 minutes of the start of drug administration. Seven subjects awoke 60 to 70 minutes after the start of the infusion and 1 awoke after 45 minutes. The EEG parameter that best characterised the effect of midazolam was the total number of waves per second in the frequency range 12 to 30 Hz (TNW12-30). This was used as the effect parameter in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modelling. The plasma concentration-time data were characterised by a triexponential function for all subjects. To allow for a possible delay between plasma midazolam concentration and EEG effect, a hypothetical effect compartment was included in the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model. A sigmoid maximum effect (Emax) model was used to characterise the effect compartment midazolam concentration-TNW12-30 data. The plasma drug concentration corresponding to half the maximum increase in TNW12-30 (EC50) was 290 +/- 98 micrograms/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "73": "In conscious dogs with a gastric fistula we compared the action of different doses of telenzepine (ranging from 1 to 243 nmol/kg/h) and pirenzepine (ranging from 4.7 to 1170 nmol/kg/h) on gastric acid output in response to pentagastrin (1 to 8 micrograms/kg/h). Pentagastrin caused a dose-dependent increase in gastric acid output. A dose of 27 nmol/kg/h and all subsequent doses of telenzepine and a dose of 130 nmol/kg/h and all higher doses of pirenzepine significantly inhibited (up to 74% of control values) the gastric acid response to pentagastrin. Doses above 27 nmol/kg/h of telenzepine and doses above 130 nmol/kg/h of pirenzepine did not further inhibit the gastric acid output. Only the highest doses of telenzepine (243 nmol/kg/h) and pirenzepine (1170 nmol/kg/h) significantly increased heart rate from 66 +/- 3.1 to 77.1 +/- 3.9 and 72.5 +/- 3.2, respectively (beats/min, chi +/- SEM, n = 6). Differences between both drugs were not found with regard to cardiovascular responses of equipotent doses. We conclude that in conscious dogs with an intact stomach, the new M1-receptor antagonist telenzepine is, on a molar basis, more than 4.7 times more potent than pirenzepine in inhibiting pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid output. This inhibition occurs at doses that do not increase heart rate, and, therefore, probably cause few systemic effects.", 
    "74": "Midazolam is a new ultra short-acting benzodiazepine whose physical dependence properties have not been well characterized. Our laboratory has demonstrated previously that physical dependence to the long-acting chlordiazepoxide in the rat is inducible by a single intoxicating dose, whereas maximal dependence required chronically equivalent maximally tolerable dosing b.i.d. for 5 weeks. Based on the methods developed in our laboratory to quantify benzodiazepine intoxication and withdrawal, Trs were designed to evaluate midazolam's capacity to induce dependence in the rat after definable acute (120 mg/kg p.o.), sub-acute (120 mg/kg q.i.d. x 3 days) and chronic (120-180 mg/kg bid. x 5 weeks) dosing that was near maximally tolerable. A single dose of midazolam failed to produce withdrawal signs. Tolerance and dependence increased as a function of midazolam dose and duration of Tr.", 
    "75": "Cimetidine is a commonly prescribed histamine 2-receptor antagonist used in the treatment of gastric acid-related disorders. Cimetidine can interact with a number of drugs, including theophylline, benzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, warfarin, and antiarrhythmics. Problems may occur in patients receiving drugs with a narrow therapeutic index when combined with cimetidine. Contrasting reports have been published on the potential interaction between digoxin and cimetidine. This study focuses on cimetidine's effect on the pharmacokinetic disposition of chronic digoxin usage. Six hospitalized patients with stable congestive heart failure received their usual maintenance dose of digoxin 0.125-0.25 mg/d po. After confirming steady-state digoxin concentrations, cimetidine 300 mg po q6h was administered. Two patients were dropped from the study. Analysis of digoxin serum concentrations, area under the curve, and the rate of elimination suggested no significant differences in digoxin parameters when combined with cimetidine.", 
    "76": "A man experienced one hour and 40 minutes of continual, inappropriate, uncontrollable laughter. The onset was preceded by a single-inhalation exposure to an insecticide of very low toxicity. The episode was terminated by a single dose of IV diazepam. A discussion of pathological laughter, including its proposed pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, clinical relevance, and management, is presented.", 
    "77": "Neuropathologic changes associated with perinatal hypoxic-ischemic events in the human infant most often result from chronic hypoxia rather than from acute asphyxia. To characterize the effects of acidosis associated with chronic hypoxia in developing neurons, cerebral cortical cultures obtained from fetal mice were exposed to 5% O2 continuously for either 24 or 48 h at 10 days after plating. At the conclusion of the hypoxic insult (HI), neuronal morphology was relatively intact for both conditions even though culture medium reflected significant reductions in pH and bicarbonate with elevation of lactate; cultures exposed to the longer HI manifested statistically greater aberrations from control values. Total benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding and clonazepam (CLO)-displaceable BDZ binding, reflecting the neuronal component of the receptor, were only modestly reduced immediately after HI, but were thereafter significantly and progressively lower over the 72 h normoxic recovery period. Although neuronal integrity was progressively diminished with both insults, morphology was always more normal and CLO higher in cultures subjected to 48-h HI compared to the 24-h HI (34.0 +/- 9.8 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1% of control values at 72 h, respectively; P less than 0.001). In contrast, values obtained for the glial marker Ro5-4864-displaceable BDZ binding were higher than control values for both conditions. Outcome was not influenced by removal of acidotic medium, nor by normalization of lactate. These data suggest that, with time, neurons in vitro adapt to severe hypoxia and that alterations in pH, lactate, and bicarbonate by themselves are probably not neurotoxic since the most acidotic cultures exhibited improved survival."
