    "1": "The subjects consisted of 42 patients with panic disorder and 42 normal gender- and age-matched controls. Among the patients, 21 were randomly assigned to a combined treatment of cognitive-behavioral therapy and the benzodiazepine antianxiety agent ethyl loflazepate (2 mg daily), and 21 were assigned to the antianxiety agent only. The treatment lasted for 6 weeks. Cell-mediated immune function was measured by the lymphocyte proliferative response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. The anxiety level was assessed by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety and the anxiety subscale of the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised.", 
    "2": "Prior to treatment, the panic disorder patients had significantly lower IL-2 production and blastogenic response to PHA than the normal controls. However, no significant differences in CMI were found between the pretreatment and posttreatment period in either the patient group receiving medication only or the combined treatment group, though after treatment, patients were significantly less anxious than before treatment in both intervention groups. The delta change (posttreatment value minus pretreatment value) in the self-reported anxiety level was significantly associated with the delta change in the blastogenic response in the combined treatment group.", 
    "3": "These findings suggest that panic disorder may be associated with decreased CMI, and the reduced level of self-reported anxiety in the patients who underwent combined therapeutic intervention is likely to increase the blastogenic response. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of treatment on immune function.",

The objective of this study was to compare glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA(1c)) levels of patients who had type 2 diabetes and schizophrenia with those of patients who had type 2 diabetes and major mood disorders and those who had type 2 diabetes but who did not have severe mental illness.", 
    "5": "A sample of 300 patients with type 2 diabetes was recruited from community mental health centers in the greater Baltimore region and nearby primary care clinics. Of these, 100 had schizophrenia, 101 had a major mood disorder, and 99 had no identified severe mental illness. HbA(1c), the main outcome measure, was compared between the group with schizophrenia and the other two groups.", 
    "6": "All three groups had HbA(1c) values above recommended levels. HbA(1c) levels were significantly lower among patients with schizophrenia than among patients who did not have severe mental illness but were not significantly different from those of patients who had major mood disorders. Patients for whom olanzapine was prescribed had higher HbA(1c) levels than those for whom other antipsychotic agents were prescribed.", 
    "7": "All three groups of patients require improved diabetes treatment to achieve acceptable HbA(1c) levels. There may be previously unrecognized benefits for diabetes management among persons with severe mental illnesses who are receiving regular mental heath care, but these individuals may also have risk factors that can influence diabetes outcomes and HbA(1c) levels.",

Prospective (Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF]) along with retrospective (Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement [CGI-I] and -Severity of Illness scales) ratings were completed for each patient. Analyses were conducted in an attempt to identify factors that appeared to correlate with response, including order of administration and Thase-Rush staging of treatment resistance.", 
    "10": "In this study of 76 medication trials in 49 patients, the overall response rate based on the CGI-I ratings was 65% (32/49). Individual rates of response were 57% (21/37) for olanzapine, 50% (7/14) for risperidone, 33% (6/18) for quetiapine, and 10% (1/10) for ziprasidone. None of the differences between neuroleptics in rates of response were significant. The difference between baseline and final GAF scores was statistically significant only in the olanzapine (p <.001) and risperidone (p =.047) groups. Rates of discontinuation did not vary significantly between agents, though trends were present. Crossover trials from one atypical neuroleptic to another in the event of nonresponse appeared to be effective.",

Data were collected from August 2001 through March 2003.", 
    "14": "Fourteen subjects were randomized to fluoxetine; 16, to olanzapine; and 15, to OFC. Forty-two of these subjects (93.3%) completed all 8 weeks of the trial. Using random-effects regression modeling of panel data of change-from-baseline scores and controlling for time, olanzapine monotherapy and OFC were associated with a significantly greater rate of improvement over time than fluoxetine on both outcome measures. However, it should be noted that fluoxetine treatment led to a substantial reduction in impulsive aggression and severity of depression. Weight gain was relatively modest in all 3 groups but significantly greater in the olanzapine-treated group than in the groups treated with fluoxetine alone or OFC.", 
    "15": "All 3 compounds studied appear to be safe and effective agents in the treatment of women with borderline personality disorder, significantly ameliorating the chronic dysphoria and impulsive aggression common among borderline patients. However, olanzapine monotherapy and OFC seem to be superior to fluoxetine monotherapy in treating both of these dimensions of borderline psychopathology.",

    "20": "Since the introduction of SSRIs, pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders has significantly changed. Although the SSRIs are considered to be a first-line treatment for the most of anxiety disorders benzodiazepines are still widely used in clinical practice despite the risk of dependence and strong recommendation for their use as a second-line. The SSRIs only replaced tricyclic antidepressants and the MAO inhibitors especially in the treatment of panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and social phobia. Combination of the SSRIs and the benzodiazepines is widely used. Recently it has been suggested that the combination of SSRI and benzodiazepine is rational, because each drug has a different mechanism of action, the benzodiazepines enhancing GABAergic transmission, and the SSRIs stimulating the 5-HT1A receptor that may inhibit the postsynaptic neuronal excitability in the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex that comprise the brain circuit of fear and anxiety. Recent imaging studies suggested the hyperactivity of the amygdala in the patients with generalized social anxiety disorder and successful treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy or SSRI might significantly reduce the hyperactivity of the amygdala. It was suggested that the rational combination of SSRIs and benzodiazepines seems to be an effective and practical way of treatment for most anxiety disorders.", 
    "21": "Neuronal GABA(A)/benzodiazepine and monoamine receptors participate in anxiety. Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous anxiogenic neuropeptide, significantly increases in brains only after treatment with psychological stress, and this increase is completely abolished by benzodiazepines. Therefore, it is through that DBI may be involved in anxiogenesis produced by psychological stress. Furthermore, increases in cerebral DBI are observed in patients with several disorders accompanying anxiety and fear, which suggest that cerebral DBI may be an essential factor for anxiogenesis, and that it may be, at least in part, a biological index to evalulate anxiety.", 
    "22": "In considering characteristics of action of anxiolytic drugs and the mechanism of drug action in the brain, it may be necessary to study not only the behavioral pharmacology but also the brain site. In the present study, anxiolytic drugs have been examined in various kinds of behaviors induced by stimulating the brain areas with regard to emotional expression such as reward (pleasure) or aversion in rats. First, the low rate responding on lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior was induced by schedules of low current brain stimulation, variable interval (VI) and differential reinforcement of low rate (DRL). Anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines facilitated these low rate responses. The drug susceptibility was high in the order of the low current stimulation > VI > DRL schedules. Furthermore, it was found by the auto-titration method on intracranial self-stimulation behavior that anxiolytic drugs decreased the threshold of stimulation reward. Second, it was recognized using the decremental lever pressing (DLP) paradigm that anxiolytic drugs increased the threshold of aversive stimulation of mesencephalic dorsal central gray (DCG), and this increasing effect of the drug was antagonized by GABA receptor blockers such as biccuculline. Third, it has been examined whether the conflict situation is established by combining with brain stimulation reward and aversion such as foot-shock or DCG stimulation. As a result, the conflict behavior was established by combining with not only the brain stimulation reward and foot shock aversion, but also the brain stimulation reward and DCG stimulation aversion. Further anxiolytic drugs exhibited the anti-conflict action to both situations. The susceptibility of anxiolytic drugs to the conflict behavior by intracranial reward and aversion was higher than the conventional method based on milk reward and foot shock aversion. Indeed, in the present brain stimulation behavioral study, anxiolytic drugs such as benzodiazepines increased the stimulation threshold in lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation and inhibited the DCG aversive stimulation, i.e. resulting in an anticonflict action of the drugs. Recently we have preliminarily established a new model for evaluating the drug which may facilitate the motivation contributing to result in various behaviors, using the priming stimulation paradigm in intracranial self-stimulation behavior. Diazepam, benzodiazepine, and nomifensine, an dopamine uptake inhibitor, exhibited a delay of the extinction process which included non-reinforcing stimulation and pretrial electric stimulation (priming stimulation) in the self-stimulation behavior. This action may be related to the brain-mechanism of motivation.", 
    "23": "Benzodiazepine hypnotic agents were the mainstream pharmacotherapy for insomnia from the 1960s to the 1980s, but their safety profile proved to be not quite as perfect as originally expected with regard to daytime performance and cognition, and above all the risk of dependence. These risks are substantially diminished in the non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents developed and marketed during the past two decades, but the fears engendered by certain benzodiazepines still greatly influence the attitude of both physicians and the general public to the treatment of insomnia. For this reason, as well as in the interests of matching the pharmacotherapy of insomnia more closely to the often fluctuating nature of this disorder, the possibility of the discontinuous or 'as needed' use of hypnotic drugs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Current recommendations strongly favour the use of hypnotic drugs for a limited period of time. However, some insomniac patients need sleep medication for longer periods in spite of a non-pharmacological approach, whereas other patients become dependent on drugs as a result of rebound insomnia, withdrawal symptoms, or the recurrence of insomnia. The pharmacological properties of zolpidem make it feasible for non-nightly use. A double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study of continuous treatment with either zolpidem or estazolam, followed by an observation of the discontinuation of drug treatments combined with the non-pharmacological management of primary insomnia, showed a carry-over benefit for zolpidem treatment.", 
    "24": "The new generation hypnotic drugs, zolpidem, zopiclone and zaleplon, are at least as efficacious in the clinic as benzodiazepines and may offer advantages in terms of safety. These drugs act through the BZ binding sites associated with GABAA receptors, but show some differences from benzodiazepines in pharmacological effects and mechanisms of action. Of particular interest is the finding that zolpidem shows a wide separation between doses producing sedative effects and those giving rise to other behavioural actions, and induces less tolerance and dependence than benzodiazepines. Zolpidem also demonstrates selectivity for GABAA receptors containing alpha1 subunits. Recent studies using genetically modified mice have confirmed that receptors containing alpha1 subunits play a particularly important role in mediating sedative activity, thus providing an explanation for the pharmacological profile of zolpidem.", 
    "25": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine which produces a dense anterograde amnesia, while permitting relatively well-preserved short-term memory, semantic retrieval, and other higher cognitive functions. Given these preserved abilities, we were interested in whether or not participants given midazolam would be aware of this anterograde amnesia.", 
    "26": "In the present experiment, participants were given midazolam in one testing session and a saline placebo in another. Participants provided judgments-of-learning (JOLs) immediately following study of cue-target pairs. During the test phase of the experiment, confidence levels and feeling-of-knowing (FOK) judgments were collected.", 
    "27": "Although cued recall performance was substantially impaired in the midazolam condition, mean JOLs were unaffected, indicating participants had little insight into their impairment during the study phase. Participants were relatively accurate in confidence levels and FOK judgments in the midazolam condition.",

    "29": "The novel antidepressant agent, agomelatine, behaves as an agonist at melatonin receptors and as an antagonist at serotonin (5-HT)(2C) receptors.", 
    "30": "To determine whether, by virtue of its antagonist properties at 5-HT(2C) receptors, agomelatine elicits anxiolytic properties in rats.", 
    "31": "Employing a combined neurochemical and behavioural approach, actions of agomelatine were compared to those of melatonin, the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist, SB243,213, and the benzodiazepine, clorazepate.", 
    "32": "In unfamiliar pairs of rats exposed to a novel environment, agomelatine enhanced the time devoted to active social interaction, an action mimicked by clorazepate and by SB243,213. In a Vogel conflict procedure, agomelatine likewise displayed dose-dependent anxiolytic activity with a maximal effect comparable to clorazepate, and SB243,213 was similarly active in this procedure. In a plus-maze procedure in which clorazepate significantly enhanced percentage entries into open arms, agomelatine revealed only modest activity and SB243,213 was inactive. Further, like SB243,213, and in contrast to clorazepate, agomelatine did not suppress ultrasonic vocalizations emitted by rats re-exposed to an environment associated with an aversive stimulus. Whereas clorazepate reduced dialysate levels of 5-HT and noradrenaline in hippocampus and frontal cortex of freely moving rats, agomelatine did not affect extracellular levels of 5-HT and elevated those of noradrenaline. SB243,213 acted similarly to agomelatine. Melatonin, which did not modify extracellular levels of 5-HT or noradrenaline, was ineffective in all models of anxiolytic activity. Furthermore, the selective melatonin antagonist, S22153, did not modify anxiolytic properties of agomelatine in either the social interaction or the Vogel Conflict tests.", 
    "33": "In contrast to melatonin, and reflecting blockade of 5-HT(2C) receptors, agomelatine is active in several models of anxiolytic properties in rodents. The anxiolytic profile of agomelatine differs from that of benzodiazepines from which it may also be distinguished by its contrasting influence on corticolimbic monoaminergic pathways.",

The pharmacokinetic profile of intravenous midazolam was characterized before and after itraconazole administration (200 mg once daily for 4 days) and also after rifampin (INN, rifampicin) pretreatment (600 mg once daily for 10 days), with a washout period of 2 weeks in between.", 
    "36": "The pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam and of its hydroxy metabolites did not show differences between the genotype groups under basal and induced metabolic conditions. However, during the inhibited metabolic state, the CYP3A5*3/*3 group showed a greater decrease in systemic clearance than was seen in the CYP3A5*1/*1 group (8.5 +/- 3.8 L. h(-1). 70 kg(-1) versus 13.5 +/- 2.7 L. h(-1). 70 kg(-1), P =.027). The 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to-midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratio was also significantly lower in the CYP3A5*3/*3 group (0.58 +/- 0.35 versus 1.09 +/- 0.37 for the homozygous wild-type group, P =.026).", 
    "37": "The CYP3A5 genotype did not affect the pharmacokinetics of intravenous midazolam in the basal or induced states. However, during cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A inhibition by itraconazole, individuals carrying the CYP3A5*1 allele were found to be less susceptible to changes in systemic clearance and showed higher 1'-hydroxymidazolam-to-midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve ratios, probably resulting from the relatively CYP3A4-specific inhibition caused by itraconazole.", 
    "38": "Benzodiazepines can shift the phase of circadian rhythms in mammalian species, but few data are available on their phase-response effects in humans, and on possible links between timing of administration and hypnotic efficacy. Using a placebo-controlled, cross-over design, we evaluated the hypnotic effect of lormetazepam 0.03 mg/kg and placebo in 38 inpatients who were affected by a major depressive episode. Patients were divided into three groups, receiving treatment at 18.00 h, 20.00 h or 22.00 h, respectively. Sleep and psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with self-administered scales and a sleep diary. The results demonstrate that active treatment significantly improved insomnia independent of the severity of depression, which remained unchanged. Timing of treatment influenced changes in timing of sleep observed with active treatment. Although sleep duration was equally improved in all treatment groups, patients who received treatment at 20.00 h showed an acute advance of sleep onset, with no changes in morning awakening. Patients who received treatment at 22.00 h showed an acute delay in morning awakening, with no changes of sleep onset. Finally, patients who received treatment at 18.00 h showed a non-significant trend in the same direction. These effects reverted with cross-over return to placebo. The perceived degree of improvement of insomnia was proportional to the advance in timing of sleep onset obtained with treatment. Our results suggest that the effects of lormetazepam on the subjective sleep of patients affected by a major depressive episode depend upon the timing of administration, and that improvement in subjective sleep is related to advance of sleep onset, and not to delay of morning awakening.", 
    "39": "Although atypical antipsychotics are now considered first line treatments for schizophrenia, intramuscular (i.m.) conventional neuroleptics are often still considered necessary in emergency treatment of acute psychoses. This European, multicentre, open-label, active-controlled trial compared oral risperidone plus oral lorazepam to standard care with i.m. conventional neuroleptics with or without lorazepam in the emergency treatment of acutely psychotic patients. Patients were allowed to choose either oral risperidone (a single dose of 2 mg and 2.0-2.5 mg lorazepam; 121 patients) or standard i.m. treatment (conventional neuroleptic with or without lorazepam; 105 patients). No additional treatment was allowed for 2 h. Primary outcome was the percentage of patients with treatment success (asleep or at least much improved on Clinical Global Impression-global improvement scale) 2 h after treatment initiation. Baseline characteristics were similar in both treatment groups. Oral risperidone plus oral lorazepam was more successful at 2 h (66.9%) and significantly non-inferior compared to standard i.m. care (54.3%; P=0.0003), and the incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was lower (1.7%) compared to standard i.m. care (9.5%). In acutely psychotic patients requiring emergency treatment, oral risperidone/oral lorazepam was at least as effective as i.m. conventional neuroleptic treatment with or without lorazepam. Oral risperidone plus lorazepam rapidly reduces symptoms, including aggression, and causes fewer EPS.",

The method involves the extraction of diazepam with ethanol at room temperature, and the extract is filtered, evaporated to dryness, and redissolved in the mobile phase, methanol-acetonitrile-tetrahydrofuran-water (15 + 55 + 4 + 26, v/v). The separation is achieved on a C18 reversed-phase column with the mobile phase and diode array detection (lambda(max)) at 230 nm. Medazepam is used as the internal standard is for quantification. The calibration plot for the determination of diazepam is based on linear regression analysis (y = 0.6687x + 0.0372; r2 = 0.995). The limit of detection for diazepam in the biscuit samples was estimated as 600 ng/mL. The limit of quantitation for diazepam was estimated as 1.75 microg/mL.

Both PARP-1 and DNA-PK have been identified as therapeutic targets for anticancer drug development. Here we investigate the effects of specific inhibitors on enzyme activities and DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The enzyme activities were investigated using purified enzymes and in permeabilized cells. Inhibition, or loss of activity, was compared using potent inhibitors of DNA-PK (NU7026) and PARP-1 (AG14361), and cell lines proficient or deficient for DNA-PK or PARP-1. Inactive DNA-PK suppressed the activity of PARP-1 and vice versa. This was not the consequence of simple substrate competition, since DNA ends were provided in excess. The inhibitory effect of DNA-PK on PARP activity was confirmed in permeabilized cells. Both inhibitors prevented ionizing radiation-induced DSB repair, but only AG14361 prevented single-strand break repair. An increase in DSB levels caused by inhibition of PARP-1 was shown to be caused by a decrease in DSB repair, and not by the formation of additional DSBs. These data point to combined inhibition of PARP-1 and DNA-PK as a powerful strategy for tumor radiosensitization.",

A significant correlation between high-dose lorazepam infusion rate and serum propylene glycol concentrations was observed (r =.557, p =.021). Osmol gap was the strongest predictor of serum propylene glycol concentrations (r =.804, p =.001). Propylene glycol accumulation was observed in six of nine patients at 48 hrs. No significant correlation between duration of lorazepam infusion and serum propylene glycol concentrations was observed (p =.637).",

    "77": "Although extended exposure to ethanol induces CYP3A metabolism in-vivo, the acute effects of ethanol on CYP3A metabolism have not been fully evaluated in-vitro. We assessed the effect of ethanol on CYP3A-mediated biotransformation using human liver microsomes in-vitro with three prototypic CYP3A-mediated reactions: nifedipine to oxidized nifedipine, triazolam to its 1-hydroxy (1-OH TRZ) and 4-hydroxy (4-OH TRZ) metabolites, and testosterone to 6beta-hydroxytestosterone (6beta-OH TST). Ethanol inhibited metabolism of nifedipine (oxidized nifedipine IC50 3 mg dL(-1), where the IC50 value is the inhibitor concentration corresponding to a 50% reduction in metabolite formation velocity), triazolam (1-OH TRZ IC50 1.1 mg dL(-1), 4-OH TRZ IC50 2.7 mg dL(-1)) and testosterone (6beta-OH TST IC50 2.4 mg dL(-1)). The inhibitory potency of ethanol was similar for the three substrates representing the three hypothetical CYP3A substrate categories. The IC50 values obtained were lower than clinically relevant blood alcohol concentrations. In conclusion, ethanol is an inhibitor of human CYP3A metabolism and may contribute to clinically important interactions.", 
    "78": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a critical component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, which is involved in the regulation of cell death. In the present study we investigated the role of PBR in the regulation of signaling pathways leading to apoptotic and necrotic damage and renal dysfunction in a rat model of ischemia-reperfusion. Renal ischemia-reperfusion led to extended tubular apoptosis and necrosis that were associated with peroxidative damage, high levels of proapoptotic Bax expression, and low levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 expression, cleavage of death substrate, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and activation of a key effector of apoptosis, caspase-3. Rat pretreatment with a novel PBR antagonist, SSR180575, significantly decreased postreperfusion oxidative stress and tubular apoptosis and necrosis. This effect was associated with inhibition of caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, upregulation of Bcl-2, and downregulation of Bax. Furthermore, inhibition of PBR accelerated the recovery of normal renal function, as assessed by measurement of levels of plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. These findings reveal a role for PBR as a modulator of necrotic and apoptotic cell death induced by ischemia-reperfusion and suggest that regulation of PBR may provide new therapeutic implications for the prevention of acute renal failure.", 
    "79": "It is generally considered that mitochondria regulate cardiac cell contractility by providing ATP for cellular ATPases and by participating in Ca2+ homeostasis. However, other possible mechanisms by which mitochondria can influence contractility have been largely overlooked. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain strongly increases Ca2+-dependent and independent isometric force development in rat ventricular fibers with selectively permeabilized sarcolemma. This effect is unrelated to the ATP-generating activity of mitochondria or Ca2+ homeostasis. Furthermore, various conditions that increase K+ accumulation in the mitochondrial matrix (activation of ATP- or Ca2+-dependent K+ channels as well as inhibition of the K+ efflux pathway via the K+/H+ exchanger) induce a similar mechanical response. Modulators of mitochondrial function that augment isometric force also cause swelling of mitochondria in the vicinity of myofibrils in situ, as shown by confocal microscopy. Osmotic compression of intracellular structures abolishes the effect of mitochondria-induced force modulation, suggesting a mechanical basis for the interaction between the organelles. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for cellular regulation of myofibrillar function, whereby increases in mitochondrial volume can impose mechanical constraints inside the cell, leading to an increase in force developed by myofibrils.", 
    "80": "Quantitative information on drug metabolites with pharmacological or toxicological activities is of great interest during the drug discovery and development process. Because the analyte response with mass spectrometry can change significantly due to small variations in chemical structure, pure standards are required to construct standard curves for quantitation. However, for most programs at the discovery stage, pure metabolite standards are not available. In this work, an evaluation was conducted using a chemiluminescent nitrogen detector (CLND) as a calibrator to obtain the response factor ratio on a mass spectrometer generated from a metabolite and its parent compound in biological fluids. Using the response factor ratio obtained from the CLND, the metabolite could be quantified with the liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) response obtained from the parent drug's standard curve. For this evaluation, oxazepam and temazepam were chosen as a 'drug/metabolite' pair. Temazepam was treated as the methylated metabolite of oxazepam. A spiked dog urine sample with a known concentration of oxazepam and unknown concentration of temazepam was injected onto the HPLC system and detected by both the CLND and MS/MS. Taking advantage of the equimolar response feature of the CLND, a response factor ratio between temazepam and oxazepam on the mass spectrometer was obtained by comparing the peak areas generated on the CLND and the mass spectrometer. From this ratio, temazepam was quantified using the oxazepam standard curve. The difference between the concentration of temazepam obtained from the reconstructed standard curve and the concentration obtained directly from a real temazepam standard curve was within 13% except the least concentrated standard (31%). This methodology has been successfully applied to measure quantities of the metabolite of a proprietary compound in a dog pharmacokinetic (PK) study.", 
    "81": "Despite its pharmacological relevance, the mechanism of the development of tolerance to the action of benzodiazepines is essentially unknown. The acute sedative action of diazepam is mediated via alpha1-GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, we tested whether chronic activation of these receptors by diazepam is sufficient to induce tolerance to its sedative action. Knock-in mice, in which thealpha1-,alpha2-,alpha3-, oralpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors had been rendered insensitive to diazepam by histidine-arginine point mutation, were chronically treated with diazepam (8 d; 15 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and tested for motor activity. Wild-type, alpha2(H101R), and alpha3(H126R) mice showed a robust diminution of the motor-depressant drug action. In contrast, alpha5(H105R) mice failed to display any sedative tolerance. alpha1(H101R) mice showed no alteration of motor activity with chronic diazepam treatment. Autoradiography with [3H]flumazenil revealed no change in benzodiazepine binding sites. However, a decrease in alpha5-subunit radioligand binding was detected selectively in the dentate gyrus with specific ligands. This alteration was observed only in diazepam-tolerant animals, indicating that the manifestation of tolerance to the sedative action of diazepam is associated with a downregulation of alpha5-GABA(A) receptors in the dentate gyrus. Thus, the chronic activation of alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors is crucial for the normal development of sedative tolerance to diazepam, which manifests itself in conjunction with alpha1-GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "82": "High-performance affinity chromatography was used to study the binding of phenytoin to an immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) column. This was accomplished through frontal analysis and competitive binding zonal elution experiments, the latter of which used four probe compounds for the major and minor binding sites of HSA injected into the presence of mobile phases containing known concentrations of phenytoin. It was found that phenytoin can interact with HSA at the warfarin-azapropazone, indole-benzodiazepine, tamoxifen, and digitoxin sites of this protein. The association constants for phenytoin at the indole-benzodiazepine and digitoxin sites were determined to be 1.04 (+/-0.05) x 10(4)M(-1) and 6.5 (+/-0.6) x 10(3)M(-1), respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C. Both allosteric interactions and direct binding for phenytoin appear to take place at the warfarin-azapropazone and tamoxifen sites. This rather complex binding system indicates the importance of identifying the binding regions on HSA for specific drugs as a means for understanding the transport of such substances in blood and in characterizing their potential for drug-drug interactions.",

Those lucrative incentives offered an opportunity to accelerate the pace of FDA approval for pediatric drug marketing. FDAMA resulted in a radical shift in federal policy to accommodate an expansion of pediatric trials. Children who are precluded from exercising a human adult's right to informed consent to research are increasingly sought as test subjects even when the trials offer no potential benefit for them. Prior to FDAMA children were protected under federal regulations that prohibited their recruitment for experiments that were not in their best interest. This article discusses eight cases and controversies demonstrating that children have been subjected to experiments that exposed them to pain, discomfort, and serious risks of harm. Babies have died testing a lethal heartburn drug; children have been subjected to \"forced dose titration\" in antidepressant drug trials that resulted in several suicide attempts. Toddlers are currently being subjected to methylphenidate dose tolerance tests without evidence of any pathological condition. Healthy teenagers are being exposed to antipsychotic drugs known to induce severe pathological side effects in speculative \"schizophrenia prevention\" experiments.",

Though the benzodiazepines are widely used in this population and are considered relatively safe given appropriate dosing and safety monitoring, important liabilities remain with the use of these agents. Antidepressants also are widely used in elderly patients, but there are no randomized controlled anxiety disorder treatment trials in this population.

    "101": "The objectives of this research were to (1) determine the incidence and prevalence of alcohol and other drug use among motor vehicle crash (MVC) victims admitted to a regional Level-I trauma center, and (2) to examine the utility of using a rapid point-of-collection (POC) drug-testing device to identify MVC patients with drug involvement. Blood and urine specimens were routinely collected per clinical protocol for each MVC victim at the time of admission. Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) levels were determined per standard clinical protocol. Clinical urine specimens were routinely split so that a POC drug-testing device for the detection of commonly abused drugs (Marijuana, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Methamphetamines, and Opiates) could be compared to that of the standard hospital laboratory analysis of each urine specimen (which also included Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines). In the six-month period of this study, nearly two-thirds of trauma center admissions were victims of motor vehicle crashes. During this time, blood and urine was collected from 322 MVC victims. Toxicology results indicated that 59.3% of MVC victims tested positive for either commonly abused drugs or alcohol. More patients tested positive for drug use than tested positive for alcohol, with 33.5% testing positive for drug use only, 15.8% testing positive for alcohol use only, and 9.9% testing positive for both drugs and alcohol. Less than half (45.2%) of the substance-abusing patients in this study would have been identified by an alcohol test alone. After alcohol, marijuana and benzodiazepines were the most frequently detected drugs. Point of collection (POC) test results correlated well with laboratory results and provide important information to initiate rapid intervention/treatment for substance use problems among injured patients.", 
    "102": "In the past century we have learned that driving performance is impaired by alcohol even in low dosage, and that many other drugs are also linked to impairment. This paper is a summary of some of the more relevant studies in the past fifty years--an overview of our knowledge and unanswered questions. There is no evidence of a threshold blood alcohol (BAC) below which impairment does not occur, and there is no defined category of drivers who will not be impaired by alcohol. Alcohol increases not only the probability of collision, but also the probability of poor clinical outcome for injuries sustained when impaired by alcohol. This review samples the results of the myriad studies that have been performed during the last half century as experiments have moved from examination of simple sensory, perceptual and motor behaviours to more complex measures of cognitive functioning such as divided attention and mental workload. These more sophisticated studies show that significant impairment occurs at very low BACs (< 0.02 gm/100 ml). However, much remains to be determined regarding the more emotional aspects of behaviour, such as judgment, aggression and risk taking. Considering that the majority of alcohol related accidents occur at night, there is a need for increased examination on the role of fatigue, circadian cycles and sleep loss. The study of the effects of drugs other than alcohol is more complex because of the number of substances of potential interest, the difficulties estimating drug levels and the complexity of the drug/subject interactions. The drugs of current concern are marijuana, the benzodiazepines, other psychoactive medications, the stimulants and the narcotics. No one test or group of tests currently meets the need for detecting and documenting impairment, either in the laboratory or at the roadside.", 
    "103": "It is hypothesized that atypical antipsychotic drugs have neuroprotective effects which may be one of the mechanisms in treatment of schizophrenia. We investigated the neuroprotective effects of olanzapine (OLA), an atypical antipsychotic drug, on methamphetamine (METH)-induced neurotoxicity in rats. After pretreatment with OLA (2 mg/kg/day) by intraperitoneal injection for 2 weeks, rats were administered METH (7.5 mg/kg, four times at 2-h intervals) by subcutaneous injection while their body temperature was monitored. The rats were sacrificed 24 h after the last injection of METH for immunohistochemistry. METH-induced 24 h mortality was effectively reduced and METH-induced decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in caudate putamen (CPu) was significantly attenuated by OLA chronic pretreatment. Furthermore, we showed that the above neuroprotective potential of OLA might be associated with its attenuating effects on METH-induced hyperthermia and with its preventative actions on METH-induced decrease of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic gene product, in the CPu. Our results suggest that OLA may be a neuroprotective agent and that its neuroprotective potential may contribute to its therapeutic effects in treatment of schizophrenia.", 
    "104": "From among the few human experimental models that can be used to predict the clinical activity of new anxiolytic drugs, the video-recorded Stroop Color-Word Test (VRSCWT), which uses subjective scales to evaluate anxious states, is notable for its simplicity. However, considering that the choice of treatment for anxiety disorders is heavily dependent on the level of somatic symptomatology, a quantitative evaluation of the physiological alterations elicited by the anxiogenic situation of the VRSCWT would also be of great interest. In the present study, 36 healthy male and female volunteers were submitted to either the VRSCWT or to a nonanxiogenic test. The results showed that, as well as a sensation of anxiety, the VRSCWT elicited increases in heart rate and gastrocnemius tension. Subsequently, a further 48 healthy men and women were randomly assigned to three treatments: placebo, 5 and 10 mg of diazepam, and were submitted to the VRSCWT. The results showed that in men, diazepam blocked the feeling of anxiety elicited by the test, although it did not prevent the physiological alterations, while in women, there was no response to the anxiolytic action of the drug. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the VRSCWT is an efficient method of inducing anxiety experimentally. It is able to elicit observable psychological and physiological alterations and can detect the blocking, by an anxiolytic, of the feelings of anxiety in healthy men. Furthermore, the results suggest that the neural pathways for the control of the psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety may be separate. This study also draws attention to the fact that gender is an important variable in the evaluation of anxiolytic drugs.", 
    "105": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor is found primarily on the outer mitochondrial membrane and consists of three subunits: the 18kDa isoquinoline binding protein, the 32kDa voltage-dependent anion channel, and the 30kDa adenine nucleotide transporter. The current study evaluates the potential importance of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor expression in glioma cell tumorigenicity. While previous studies have suggested that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-binding may be relatively increased in tumor tissue and cells, so far, little is known about the relationships between peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor density and factors underlying tumorigenicity. In the present study, we found in glioma cell lines (C6, U87MG, and T98G), that peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand-binding density is relatively high for C6 and low for T98G, while U87MG displays intermediate levels. Cell growth of these cell lines in soft agar indicated that high levels of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-binding were associated with increased colony size, indicative of their ability to establish anchorage independent cell proliferation. Potential causes for differences in tumorigenicity between these cell lines were suggested by various cell death and proliferation assays. Cell death, including apoptosis, appeared to be low in C6, and high in T98G, while U87MG displayed intermediate levels in this respect. Cell proliferation appeared to be high in C6, low in T98G, and intermediate in U87MG. In conclusion, our study suggests that relatively high peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor-binding density is associated with enhanced tumorigenicity and cell proliferation rate. In particular, apoptosis appears to be an important tumorigenic determinant in these glioma cell lines. Moreover, application of PBR-specific ligands indicated that PBR indeed are functionally involved in apoptosis in glioma cells.", 
    "106": "The aim of this study was to compare and contrast the properties of gamma oscillations induced by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine or metabotropic glutamate receptors in the CA3 region of rat hippocampal slices. Both carbachol and the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), induced network oscillations in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz). The M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist, pirenzepine, blocked carbachol-, but enhanced DHPG-induced oscillations, whereas LY 341495, an antagonist at metabotropic glutamate receptors, abolished DHPG-, but left carbachol-induced oscillations unchanged. There were significant differences in the peak frequency, maximal power, and spectral width of the two oscillations. Pharmacological experiments showed that both types of oscillation depend on fast excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Interestingly, activation of neurokinin-1 receptors by substance P fragment or enhancement of inhibitory synaptic currents by the benzodiazepine ligand, zolpidem, boosted DHPG-, but reduced the power of carbachol-induced oscillations. These results suggest that, although carbachol and DHPG might activate similar conductances in individual pyramidal cells, the oscillations they induce in slices involve different network mechanisms, most likely by recruiting distinct types of GABAergic interneuron.", 
    "107": "Kainate receptors are implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological processes in the CNS. Previously we demonstrated that (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (ATPA), a selective agonist for the GLU(K5) subtype of kainate receptor, depresses monosynaptically evoked inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in the CA1 region of the rat hippocampus. In the current study, we provide a more detailed characterisation of this effect. Firstly, our data demonstrate a rank order of potency of domoate>kainate>ATPA>alpha-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxalolyl)propionic acid Secondly, we confirm that the effects of ATPA are not mediated indirectly via the activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (i.e. either GABA(A) or GABA(B)). Thirdly, we show that the small increase in conductance induced by ATPA is insufficient to account for the depression of monosynaptic inhibition. Fourthly, we show that the effects of ATPA on IPSPs are antagonised by the GLU(K5)-selective antagonist (3S, 4aR, 6S, 8aR)-6-(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY382884).

    "108": "Several lines of evidence suggest a crucial involvement of glutamate in the mechanism of action of anxiolytic drugs including the involvement of group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. Given the recent discovery of a selective and brain penetrable mGlu5 receptor antagonists, the effect of 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP), i.e. the most potent mGlu5 antagonist, was evaluated in established models of anxiety after single or repeated administration. We also studied if the anxiolytic effect of MTEP is mediated by mechanism involving the GABA-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor complex. Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats or male Albino Swiss mice. The anxiolytic-like effects of MTEP were tested in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats as well as in the four-plate test in mice. MTEP (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) induced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test (after single and repeated administration) and in the elevated plus-maze test in rats. In the four-plate test in mice, it exerted anxiolytic activity at a dose of 20 mg/kg. MTEP had no effect on the locomotor activity of animals. The anxiolytic-like effect of MTEP was not changed by BZD antagonist flumazenil. Moreover, a synergistic interaction between non-effective doses of MTEP and diazepam was observed in the conflict drinking test. These data suggest that selective mGlu5 receptor antagonists mediated anxiolysis is not dependent on GABA-ergic system and that these agents may play a role in the therapy of anxiety.", 
    "109": "Gabapentin alleviates and/or prevents acute nociceptive and inflammatory pain both in animals and volunteers, especially when given before trauma. Gabapentin might also reduce postoperative pain. To test the hypothesis that gabapentin reduces the postoperative need for additional pain treatment (postoperative opioid sparing effect of gabapentin in humans), we gave 1200 mg of gabapentin or 15 mg of oxazepam (active placebo) 2.5 h prior to induction of anaesthesia to patients undergoing elective vaginal hysterectomy in an active placebo-controlled, double blind, randomised study. Gabapentin reduced the need for additional postoperative pain treatment (PCA boluses of 50 microg of fentanyl) by 40% during the first 20 postoperative hours. During the first 2 postoperative hours pain scores at rest and worst pain score (VAS 0-100 mm) were significantly higher in the active placebo group compared to the gabapentin-treated patients. Additionally, pretreatment with gabapentin reduced the degree of postoperative nausea and incidence of vomiting/retching possibly either due to the diminished need for postoperative pain treatment with opioids or because of an anti-emetic effect of gabapentin itself. No preoperative differences between the two groups were encountered with respect to the side effects of the premedication. However, 15 mg oxazepam was more effective in relieving preoperative anxiety than 1200 mg gabapentin.", 
    "110": "A capillary electrochromatographic (CEC) method was applied to the simultaneous separation of barbiturates (barbital, phenobarbital, secobarbital and thiopental) and benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, diazepam and triazolam). The separation was performed in a 75 microm i.d. capillary, packed with 3-(1,8-naphthalimido)propyl-modified silyl silica gel (NAIP), studying the effects of buffer pH and mobile phase composition. Using an applied voltage of 20 kV and the short-end injection method (9 cm capillary effective length), the mobile phase of 1.0 mM citrate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 45% methanol provided the baseline separation of seven toxic drugs in less than 9 min. In CEC with NAIP, the benzodiazepines were separated by the combination of hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions, whereas the separation of the barbiturates was based on the hydrophobic interaction.",

In this study the frequency of parasuicidal drug intoxication, the distribution of age and gender, as well as the kind and origin of used drugs were evaluated. Furthermore the knowledge about used drugs and possible adverse effects of a previously given medication were analysed.", 
    "112": "Over a period of 2 years (January 1998-December 1999) 155 patients (41 males, 114 females, average age 40.5 years) with drug intoxication by attempted suicide were recruited at the University Hospital of Dresden, Germany, for further retrospective analysis.", 
    "113": "74 % of these patients were women. Sedatives and hypnotics were most frequently used for parasuicide (44 %), followed by analgesics (18 %) and antidepressants (12 %). Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-agonists were the most commonly used drugs (32 %). Moreover, 80 % of all drugs used had been prescribed by physicians. Approximately half of the patients were well-informed about drugs taken. In 43 (47 %) of 92 patients with long-term medication an adverse effect was considered as a possible cause of the attempted suicide.", 
    "114": "Our data underline the importance of attempted suicide in view of the frequency of their use, the need of hospitalization, the required intensive care and possible relapses. Because the majority of drugs used were prescribed by physicians, before giving any medication to their possible suicidal use should be considered.",

Burn injuries can potentially disrupt sleep for a variety of reasons, including the physiological effects of trauma as well as ramifications of treatment (ie, intensive care unit environment, pain, itching, medications). The literature on sleep disorders and burn injuries is reviewed, and suggestions for treatment are provided. Treatment is divided into two major types: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic. Nonpharmacologic treatment, also referred to as behavioral techniques, may include any one or combination of the following: sleep hygiene, stimulus control, sleep restriction, relaxation techniques, cognitive, and light therapy. Pharmacologic therapies may include hypnotics (benzodiazepine, nonbenzodiazepine, or benzodiazepine receptor agonists), antidepressants, over-the-counter preparations, hormone replacement therapy, herbs, and melatonin.",

The proposed representations of the molecules are obtained by a topological analysis of their electron density maps at medium resolution, leading to graphs of critical points. The distribution of the different types of critical points are compared at various levels of resolution for a training set of 22 molecules in order to define the optimal resolution level leading to the best representation of the various chemical functions. The reduced representations can in the future be used for molecular similarity research and pharmacophore proposals.", 
    "117": "The causes of death in tetanus are muscle spasms and spasm of the larynx, which are caused by blocking the release of inhibitory neurotransmitters in the spinal synapses, causing the uncontrolled spread of impulses. Diazepam controls the spasms by blocking the polysynaptic reflexes, working peripherally, without depressing the cortical center and has no cardiovascular or endocrine effects. High dose diazepam had been used and proved to be a good muscle relaxant. Diazepam seems to work better with tetanus than pancuronium bromide, but both drugs need mechanical ventilation. In cases where the dose exceeds 240 mg per day in a child, a ventilator should be on hand, and if the dose required is more than 480 mg per day, other drugs should be considered. In three cases of severe tetanus presented here, the first two were managed by diazepam and pancuronium bromide and the last case by high dose diazepam only. In the first case, the dose of diazepam was up to 480 mg/day. By using high dose diazepam in severe tetanus, management of the clinical manifestations of autonomic nerve involvement and the weaning process become easier. Most complications of severe tetanus became more manageable.", 
    "118": "The volume of literature concerning sedation and analgesia for procedures outside the operating room has increased greatly over the past several years. Information relating to sedation risks and complications, the development of sedation guidelines, and now specific sedation techniques has appeared. The following section will trace the development of the most recent sedation guidelines and identify the key elements for inclusion into institutional sedation guidelines. The risks and complications associated with sedation will be addressed and an approach to providing sedation and analgesia for procedures outside the operating room will be presented. The important characteristics of several common drugs used for sedation and analgesia will also be discussed.", 
    "119": "Cardiac surgery has been associated with a significant incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). To assess the antiemetic property of midazolam, we undertook this double-blinded, randomized trial in 200 patients undergoing cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass, and we compared its efficacy with that of ondansetron in preventing PONV. Assessments on the occurrence of PONV were made at regular intervals for the first 24 h after tracheal extubation, along with sedation and pain scoring. We report a 6% incidence of nausea and no incidence of vomiting in the midazolam group, compared with a 21% incidence of PONV in the ondansetron group (P < 0.001). All 21 patients (18 women and 3 men) in the ondansetron group and none of the 6 patients (all women) in the midazolam group required a rescue antiemetic drug (P < 0.001). The sedation scores and postoperative pain scores were comparable in both groups. We conclude that midazolam, instituted as a continuous infusion in a dose of 0.02 mg. kg(-1). h(-1), is a more effective antiemetic than ondansetron in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg IV every 6 h for the prevention of PONV after cardiac surgery.", 
    "120": "Earlier cross-sectional studies with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in treated patients with schizophrenia have reported abnormalities of cortical motor processing, including reduced lateralization of primary sensory motor cortex. The objective of the present longitudinal study was to evaluate whether such cortical abnormalities represent state or trait phenomena of the disorder.", 
    "121": "Seventeen acutely ill, previously untreated patients were studied after 4 weeks and after 8 weeks of olanzapine therapy. Seventeen matched healthy subjects served as control subjects. All subjects underwent two fMRI scans 4 weeks apart during a visually paced motor task using a simple periodic block design. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were analyzed in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM99). Region of interest analyses were used to determine a laterality quotient (an index of lateralization) of motor cortical regions.", 
    "122": "The fMRI data indicated that patients had reduced activation of the primary sensory motor cortex at 4 weeks but not at 8 weeks; however, the laterality quotient in the primary sensory motor cortex was reduced in patients at both time points.", 
    "123": "These results suggest that some cortical abnormalities during motor processing represent state phenomena, whereas reduced functional lateralization of the primary sensory motor cortex represents an enduring trait of schizophrenia.", 
    "124": "Acceptability of the atrial defibrillator is partly limited by concerns about shock related anxiety and discomfort. Sedation and/or automatic cardioversion therapy during sleep may ease shock discomfort and improve patient acceptability. Three atrial cardioversion techniques were compared: patient-activated cardioversion with sedation, automatic night cardioversion with sedation, and automatic night cardioversion without sedation. Sedation was oral midazolam (15 mg). Fifteen patients aged 60 +/- 13 years were assigned each strategy randomly for three consecutive episodes of persistent atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion. Patients completed questionnaires for multiple parameters immediately and again at 24 hours postcardioversion. Atrial cardioversion strategies with oral sedation (patient-activated and automatic) significantly reduced shock recall by 77% (P < 0.005), therapy dissatisfaction by 57%-71% (P < 0.03), shock discomfort by 61%-73% (P < 0.01), shock pain by 79%-83% (P < 0.001), and shock intensity by 73%-77% (P < 0.03), compared to automatic night cardioversion without sedation (P < 0.02). Atrial shock pain was short-lived and caused little disruption to the patients' daily routines. Automatic night cardioversion without sedation, resulted in sleep disturbances not seen with the other strategies (42% vs 0%, P < 0.001) as well as concerns about future pain or discomfort. Twelve patients (80%) chose patient-activated cardioversion with sedation as their preferred treatment, and three (20%) remainder chose automatic night cardioversion with sedation. Ninety percent of patients chose automatic night cardioversion without sedation as the least acceptable therapy. Sedation significantly increases atrial shock acceptability regardless of cardioversion method. Shocks without sedation are significantly less acceptable to patients using the atrial defibrillators.", 
    "125": "The study examined the consistency between retrospective self-reported drug use and urinalysis data among 281 male opioid dependent subjects attending out patient clinic of National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre from January 2001 to December 2001 at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Preliminary analysis indicated that there was moderate to high concordance between the two measures among different drug types. On an average 85% of urine test results matched with self-report. Subject's over-reported drug use as indicated by the low positive predictive value. In contrast, subjects were more accurate when they were reporting no drug use as suggested by the high negative predictive value. The study suggests that urine analysis is a critical variable in substance abuse treatment programs. Clinicians should be cautious while prescribing agonist drug due to frequent over-reporting of drug use by patients in our setting. This will make the substance abuse program more meaningful.", 
    "126": "Cellular and humoral immunological parameters have been studied in 59 schizophrenic patients and 38 healthy controls. Immunological indices (CIC, autoantibodies to cardiolipin) were found to be significantly elevated in patients in the acute disease stage before the treatment. After olanzapin therapy, a level of these parameters decreased and did not differ from that of controls. In patients, irrespective of clinical condition and treatment, functional activity of immunocompetent cells (phagocyte activity of neutrophils and monocytes, cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes natural killers, interleukin-2, interleukin-10 and gamma-interferon production), was significantly lower both before the treatment as after therapy, i.e. did not change during the whole study (28 weeks). In responders, a level of IL-1B production was higher than in controls before and during the treatment. In non-responders, it was similar to that in controls before the therapy, and increased during the treatment to a higher level.",

    "129": "PD is a common and debilitating psychiatric disease in which a person experiences sudden and unpredictable panic attacks, or PAs, with symptoms of overwhelming anxiety, chest pain, palpitations and shortness of breath. Persistent concern about having another attack and worry that it may indicate a heart attack or \"going crazy\" impairs the person's social, family and working lives. Frequently accompanying the disorder is agoraphobia, depression and mitral valve prolapse, or MVP.", 
    "130": "In patients with PD, the prevalence of dental disease may be extensive because of the xerostomic effects of psychiatric medications used to treat it. Dental treatment consists of preventive dental education and prescribing saliva substitutes and anticaries agents. Precautions must be taken when prescribing or administering analgesics, antibiotics or sedative agents that may have an adverse interaction with the psychiatric medications. Because there is a connection between PAs and MVP, the dentist needs to consult with the patient's physician to determine the presence of MVP and whether there is associated mitral valve regurgitation. Patients with MVP and accompanying mitral valve regurgitation require prophylactic antibiotics when undergoing dental procedures known to cause a bacteremia and heightened risk of endocarditis.", 
    "131": "Tuberous sclerosis (TS) is an autosomal dominant disease that affects the brain, skin, eye, heart and kidney. The diagnostic criteria for tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) have recently been revised. There are relatively few Indian studies on this disorder. Twenty-six patients diagnosed as having TS over a period of 18 years are being reported. The onset of seizures ranged from infancy to adolescence. The patterns of epilepsy encountered were generalized tonic clonic seizures (13), complex partial seizures (10), simple partial seizures (9) and myoclonic jerks (4) including infantile spasms (3). Patients often had more than one seizure type. Nineteen patients were mentally subnormal. Cutaneous manifestations were facial angiofibroma i.e. adenoma sebaceum (20), shagreen patches (7), hypopigmented macules (6), ash leaf spots (4), caf\u00e9-au-lait spots (2), facial hypoplasia (2) and periungual fibromas (1). One patient each had retinal phakoma and renal angiomyolipoma. CT scan revealed sub-ependymal calcifications (12), parenchymal tubers (3), cerebral edema (3) and cortical atrophy (1). One patient had enhancement of peri-ventricular sub-ependymal lesions on MRI. Anticonvulsants prescribed were phenobarbitone (20), diphenyl hydantoin (14), carbamazepine (8), sodium valproate (4), benzodiazepines (4), ACTH (2), prednisone (1), mysoline (1) and vigabatrin (1). Most patients were on combinations of anti-convulsants and response to therapy was usually not very satisfactory. However, the child treated with vigabatrin did well.", 
    "132": "An interaction with the GABA type A (GABA(A)) receptor has long been recognized as one of the main neurochemical mechanisms underlying many of the pharmacological actions of ethanol. However, more recent data have suggested that certain behavioral and electrophysiological actions of ethanol are mediated by an increase in brain concentration of neuroactive steroids that results from stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Neuroactive steroids such as 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) are, in fact, potent and efficacious endogenous positive modulators of GABA(A) receptor function. Because neurosteroids can be synthesized de novo in the brain, we have investigated whether ethanol might affect both neurosteroid synthesis and GABA(A) receptor function in isolated rat hippocampal tissue. Here, we show that ethanol increases the concentration of 3alpha,5alpha-THP as well as the amplitude of GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSCs recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons in isolated hippocampal slices. These effects are shared by the neurosteroid precursor progesterone, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor-selective agonist CB34, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate, all of which are known to increase the formation of neuroactive steroids in plasma and in the brain. The action of ethanol on GABA(A) receptor-mediated IPSC amplitude is biphasic, consisting of a rapid, direct effect on GABA(A) receptor activity and an indirect effect that appears to be mediated by neurosteroid synthesis. Furthermore, ethanol affects GABA(A) receptor activity through a presynaptic action, an effect that is not dependent on neurosteroid formation. These observations suggest that ethanol may modulate GABA(A) receptor function through an increase in de novo neurosteroid synthesis in the brain that is independent of the HPA axis. This novel mechanism may have a crucial role in mediating specific central effects of ethanol.", 
    "133": "Human mitochondrial complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the oxidative phosphorylation system is a multiprotein assembly comprising both nuclear and mitochondrially encoded subunits. Deficiency of this complex is associated with numerous clinical syndromes ranging from highly progressive, often early lethal encephalopathies, of which Leigh disease is the most frequent, to neurodegenerative disorders in adult life, including Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy and Parkinson disease. We show here that the cytosolic Ca2+ signal in response to hormonal stimulation with bradykinin was impaired in skin fibroblasts from children between the ages of 0 and 5 years with an isolated complex I deficiency caused by mutations in nuclear encoded structural subunits of the complex. Inhibition of mitochondrial Na+-Ca2+ exchange by the benzothiazepine CGP37157 completely restored the aberrant cytosolic Ca2+ signal. This effect of the inhibitor was paralleled by complete restoration of the bradykinin-induced increases in mitochondrial Ca2+ concentration and ensuing ATP production. Thus, impaired mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation during agonist stimulation is a major consequence of human complex I deficiency, a finding that may provide the basis for the development of new therapeutic approaches to this disorder.",

In addition, the chronic prostatitis symptom index (CPSI) of each patient was evaluated. All patients were treated for 6 to 8 weeks, type III A with antibiotics and alpha1 receptor inhibitor, type III B with alpha1 receptor inhibitor, diazepam diclogenatis and other narcotics.

    "143": "The present study revealed the effect of diazepam, a benzodiazepine, and progesterone, a pregnane precursor of neurosteroids, which act via modulating GABA-A chloride channel complex on the isolation stress-induced free choice ethanol consumption in adult rats. Isolation stress for 24 hr over a period of 6 days produced a significant increase in ethanol consumption, which persisted during the 6-day recovery period. Pretreating the animals with diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or progesterone (5 mg/kg, i.p.), blocked the isolation stress-induced increase in ethanol consumption. Bicuculline (2 mg/kg, i.p.), a GABA-A receptor antagonist significantly attenuated the effect of both diazepam and progesterone on stress-induced modulation of ethanol consumption. Isolation stress also caused an increase in total fluid consumption, which was antagonised by both diazepam and progesterone. Like ethanol consumption, this effect of diazepam and progesterone on isolation stress-induced increase in total fluid consumption was attenuated by bicuculline. Neither diazepam nor progesterone produced an increase in ethanol consumption in non-stressed rats. However, unlike diazepam, progesterone administration to non-stressed rats caused a significant increase in total fluid consumption. Results of the present study thus show that GABAergic mechanisms may be playing an important role in isolation stress-induced increase in ethanol consumption.", 
    "144": "There are no reports on the effect of 7-nitroindazole (7-NI) on chemically-induced convulsions. Hence, in the present study, its (100 and 200 mg/kg) action was tested alone and in combination with phenobarbitone (20 mg/kg) and diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) on picrotoxin (PCT)-induced convulsions in rats. The changes produced by 7-NI on nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and nitric oxide (NO) concentration were determined in the brain. The effect of 7-NI was tested in L-arginine (1000 mg/kg) pretreated (30 min) animals. The smaller dose (100 mg/kg) of 7-NI did not alter NOS activity and NO concentration, but inhibited PCT-induced convulsions indicating that its anticonvulsant action was devoid of an involvement of NO. But, an inhibition of NOS activity, by a larger (200 mg/kg) dose of it, resulted in a promotion of the convulsant action of PCT and in an impairment of the anticonvulsant effect of both phenobarbitone and diazepam. The proconvulsant action of 7-NI was reverted by L-arginine. These results suggest that 100 and 200 mg/kg of 7-NI produce distinguishable action on PCT-induced convulsions because NOS activity is inhibited by 200 mg/kg and not by 100 mg/kg of it. The results further suggest that NO acts as anticonvulsant and that the NOS inhibitors, like 7-NI, cannot be used as an anticonvulsant either alone or in combination with other anticonvulsants.", 
    "145": "We investigated postischemic alterations in benzodiazepine receptor, D1 dopamine receptor, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor binding after transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion in rats using [3H]-flumazenil, [3H]-SCH23390, and [3H]-N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilate ([3H]-NMPB), respectively, as radioligand. These ligand bindings were determined at 3 and 24 h and at 3 and 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA by using autoradiographic methods. Ischemic cell injury was clearly detected from 3 h after ischemia/reperfusion and progressively increased from 3-24 h after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. The area of cell injury reached maximum at 24 h after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. [3H]-SCH23390 binding was reduced to 47% of the contralateral side at 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. After 7 days, [3H]-SCH23390 binding was further reduced by 20% in the striatum. [3H]-NMPB binding was slightly decreased in both the striatum and cerebral cortex at 3 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA, and [3H]-NMPB binding in the striatum and cerebral cortex were reduced to 42 and 62% of the contralateral side at 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. [3H]-NMPB was also decreased at 24 h. In contrast, [3H]-flumazenil binding was not decreased in the striatum and cerebral cortex within 7 days after ischemia/reperfusion of MCA. These results suggest that [3H]-SCH23390 and [3H]-NMPB binding do not correlate with cell injury by ischemia/reperfusion, although vulnerability to ischemia/reperfusion was observed with these receptors. In addition, central benzodiazepine receptor imaging might be essentially stable to neuronal cell injury induced by transient focal cerebral ischemia in rats, in contrast to the results of PET studies.",

People allocated bromperidol decanoate required additional antipsychotic medication somewhat more frequently than those taking fluphenazine decanoate and haloperidol decanoate but the results did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance (n=77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.72 CI 0.7 to 4.2). The use of benzodiazepine drugs was very similar in both groups (n=77, 2 RCTs, RR 1.08 CI 0.68 to 1.70). People left the bromperidol decanoate group with the same frequency as those allocated other depots (n=97, 3 RCTs, RR 1.92 CI 0.8 to 4.6). Anticholinergic adverse effects were equally common between bromperidol and other depots (n=47, RR 3.13 CI 0.7 to 14.0) and additional anticholinergic medication was needed with equal frequency in both depot groups, although results did tend to favour the bromperidol decanoate group (n=97, 3 RCTs, RR 0.80 CI 0.64 to 1.01).

Compared with haloperidol or clotiapine, people allocated zuclopenthixol did not seem to be at more risk of a range of movement disorders (<20%). Three studies found no difference in the proportion of people getting blurred vision/ dry mouth (n=192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 0.90 CI 0.48 to 1.70). Similarly dizziness was equally infrequent for those allocated zuclopenthixol acetate compared with haloperidol (n=192, 2 RCTs, RR at 24 hours 1.15 CI 0.46 to 2.88). There was no difference between treatments for leaving the study before completion (n=522, RR 0.85 CI 0.31 to 2.31).", 
    "159": "Recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. Most trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. This review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. Well-conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trials are needed.", 
    "160": "Withdrawal from 1-week oral administration of the benzodiazepine (BZ), flurazepam (FZP) is associated with enhanced AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated and reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitation in CA1 pyramidal neurons 2-days after cessation of FZP administration. The present study examined temporal regulation of glutamate receptor-mediated whole-cell currents in CA1 neurons from hippocampal slices prepared from 0-, 1-, 2-, and 4-day FZP-withdrawn rats in relation to expression of anxiety-like behavior during BZ withdrawal. AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude was significantly increased in CA1 neurons from 1- and 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats, while evoked NMDAR EPSC amplitude was reduced only in neurons from 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. Withdrawal-anxiety, measured in the elevated plus-maze, was observed 1 day, but not 0, 2, or 4 days, after FZP treatment with 1-day withdrawn rats spending significantly reduced time in open arms compared to controls. CA1 neuron hyperexcitability was evident from the significant increase in the frequency of extracellular, 4-AP-induced spike discharges in slices from 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats. Systemic injection of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg) on day 1 of withdrawal prevented reduced NMDAR-mediated currents in CA1 neurons from 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats, whereas AMPAR-mediated currents remained upregulated. Furthermore, MK-801 'unmasked' withdrawal-anxiety in the same 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. Systemic injection of the AMPAR antagonist GYKI-52466 (0.5 mg/kg) at the onset of withdrawal blocked increased AMPAR-mediated currents and withdrawal-anxiety in 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats. These findings suggest that increased CA1 neuron AMPAR-mediated excitation may contribute to hippocampal hyperexcitability and expression of withdrawal-anxiety after prolonged BZ exposure via NMDAR-mediated neural circuits.", 
    "161": "Among the different pharmacological approaches that could be adopted in the treatment of myofascial pain of masticatory muscles, attention has to be paid to muscle relaxants drugs, since very few studies evaluated their efficacy, despite most authors suggest their use. The present paper is a critical review of the literature on the use of the most common drugs with muscle relaxant effects (benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants) and of a muscle relaxant drug (tizanidine hydrochloride) in the treatment of such condition. From literature data it emerged that these drugs had phases of alternate enthusiasm, characterized by a not constant clinical use and a fair interest in research. Nevertheless, within all the limitations that have been discussed in this paper, the use of muscle relaxants in patients with myofascial pain of masticatory muscles seems to be justifiable, even though further research is needed to verify their usefulness in terms of risk-benefit ratio.", 
    "162": "Improvement in some but not all domains of cognition during treatment with the atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine, quetiapine, olanzapine, and risperidone has been reported in some but not all studies. It has been recently suggested that these reports are an artifact, related to lessening of the impairment due to typical neuroleptic drugs and anticholinergic agents. The purpose of this study was to further test the hypothesis that olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug reported to have anticholinergic properties, improves cognition in patients with schizophrenia, including domains of cognition related closely to work and social function (ie, verbal learning and memory) and that this improvement is independent of improvement in psychopathology. Thirty-four patients with schizophrenia who were partial responders to typical antipsychotic drug treatment were evaluated with a comprehensive neurocognitive battery, including measures of executive functioning; verbal and visual learning and memory; working memory; immediate, selective, and sustained attention; perceptual/motor processing; and motor skills prior to and following treatment with olanzapine for 6 weeks. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was used to assess psychopathology in patients treated with typical antipsychotic drugs. Subjects were switched to olanzapine (average dose 13.4 mg, range 5-20 mg) and reassessed following 6 weeks and 6 months of treatment. Significant improvement was noted in 9 of 19 cognitive tests, including measures of selective attention, verbal learning and memory, and verbal fluency. No cognitive test was worsened by olanzapine treatment. Improvements in the BPRS Total and Positive Symptom Subscale scores were noted. Improvements in verbal learning and memory, sustained attention, and psychomotor tracking were independent of improvement in psychopathology. These data suggest that olanzapine improved some but not all cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, including verbal memory, a cognitive domain impaired by anticholinergic drugs. The basis for the improvement in cognitive scores, which should lead to improvement in role functioning if real, is discussed.", 
    "163": "The early postnatal brain development, when many potentially sensitive processes occur, has been shown to be vulnerable to different pharmacological and environmental compounds. In the present investigation, four groups of neonatal NMRI male mice were administered the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.), or the GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or co-administered ketamine (50 mg/kg, s.c.) and diazepam (5 mg/kg, s.c.), or vehicle (0.9% saline, s.c.) on day 10 after birth. On day 11, mice from each treatment group were sacrificed and brains were taken for analysis of neuronal cell degeneration, using Fluoro-Jade staining technique. Ketamine, but not diazepam, induced a severe degeneration of cells in the parietal cortex. The opposite was observed for diazepam in the laterodorsal thalamus. The most pronounced cell degeneration was seen in parietal cortex of mice exposed to both ketamine and diazepam. At 2 months of age each treatment group was tested for motor activity and learning performance. Ketamine and ketamine + diazepam treated mice displayed severe deficits of habituation to the test chamber in the spontaneous motor activity test, marked deficits of acquisition learning and retention memory in the radial arm maze-learning task and less shift learning in the circular swim maze-learning task. This study indicates that the observed functional deficits can be related to cell degeneration induced during a critical stage of neonatal brain development. The potentiated apoptosis induced by ketamine and diazepam may have implications for the selection of drugs used in neonatal paediatric anaesthesia.",

    "165": "New arrivals to altitude commonly experience poor-quality sleep. These complaints are associated with increased fragmentation of sleep by frequent brief arousals, which are in turn linked to periodic breathing. Changes in sleep architecture include a shift toward lighter sleep stages, with marked decrements in slow-wave sleep and with variable decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Respiratory periodicity at altitude reflects alternating respiratory stimulation by hypoxia and subsequent inhibition by hyperventilation-induced hypocapnia. Increased hypoxic ventilatory responsiveness and loss of regularization of breathing during sleep contribute to the occurrence of periodicity. Interventions that improve sleep quality at high altitude include acetazolamide and benzodiazepines.",

    "167": "The integrated medical and pharmacy claims of a large, geographically diverse, commercially insured population of 1.6 million employees, retirees and dependents were used to conduct this analysis. Patients who initiated outpatient treatment with either olanzapine or risperidone (no prescription for olanzapine or risperidone during a 1-year period prior to the initiation) and with uncontrolled schizophrenia were included. Drug treatment course and associated health care costs (calculated based on charges) during the subsequent 12-month period were examined using univariate and multivariate methods.",

Olanzapine was associated with more favorable drug treatment course than risperidone. Although pharmaceutical costs were significantly higher, medical costs were significantly lower for patients on olanzapine compared to those on risperidone. Univariate and multivariate analyses (controlling for potential confounding factors including demographic and clinical characteristics) consistently demonstrated that olanzapine patients had significantly lower schizophrenia related costs (2839 US dollars less, p < 0.011), lower mental health care costs (3744 US dollars less, p < 0.004) and lower total health care costs (4674 US dollars less, p < 0.001) than those patients initiated on risperidone.", 
    "169": "The findings revealed significant differences between olanzapine and risperidone in the treatment of uncontrolled schizophrenia patients in clinical practice. Olanzapine patients experienced a favorable drug treatment course and incurred lower overall costs. The lower costs were hospital-treatment driven. Further studies are needed to examine if these results hold for different patient populations.",

Subsequently, we classified a 'clear responsibility', 'possible responsibility' or 'not causative' role for buprenorphine or methadone in the death process, or 'no explanation of death'. Buprenorphine and methadone can be regarded as being directly implicated in, respectively, four of 34 death cases (12%) and three of 35 death cases (9%), and their participation in the lethal process is strongly plausible in eight (buprenorphine) and 11 (methadone) additional deaths.",

    "175": "Paroxetine is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor useful in the treatment of a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterised by excessive persistent anxiety and worry about a number of events and activities occurring on more days than not for at least 6 months. GAD is the most common anxiety disorder in primary care settings. Paroxetine was the second antidepressant to receive an FDA indication for the treatment of GAD. In contrast to benzodiazepines, which had been the mainstay of treatment for anxiety disorders for many years, antidepressants, such as paroxetine, are more effective for the psychic symptoms of anxiety, which include worry, tension, irritability and concentration difficulties, and carry a more tolerable and safe side effect profile.", 
    "176": "Lewy body dementia, also referred to as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), is a neurodegenerative disorder now considered to be the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Postmortem findings suggest that DLB accounts for 20% to 34% of all dementia cases and is often underdiagnosed. Salient features of DLB include fluctuations in cognition, perceptual abnormalities (e.g., visual hallucinations), and mild parkinsonism. Other symptoms include frequent falls, nighttime agitation, and depression. DLB symptomatology can be partly explained by the extensive destruction of dopaminergic and acetylcholinergic pathways caused by neurodegeneration. For this reason, DLB patients are especially vulnerable to the antidopaminergic and anticholinergic actions of most conventional antipsychotics, which makes treatment of the psychotic symptoms of DLB extremely difficult. Patients are particularly sensitive to developing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and also to the potentially fatal complication of neuroleptic sensitivity, which affects approximately 50% of DLB patients. Therefore, a need exists for antipsychotic drugs with less propensity to induce EPS and reduced affinity for dopamine and acetylcholine receptors. Here we review studies evaluating the efficacy and tolerability of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychoses associated with DLB. Olanzapine appears to be poorly tolerated, and risperidone has been associated with high risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Clozapine use remains controversial because of its potent anticholinergic action and risk of agranulocytosis. Quetiapine has been shown to reduce psychiatric manifestations of DLB without causing neuroleptic sensitivity or increasing EPS. Hence, quetiapine is an attractive candidate for the treatment of psychoses in DLB and other dementias.", 
    "177": "Pharmacotherapy in patients with dementia aims to improve distressing behavioral and psychological signs of dementia after nonpharmacologic interventions fail, without causing unacceptable side effects or exacerbating underlying cognitive impairment. We review data describing risperidone (3 published placebo-controlled trials), olanzapine (1 abstract regarding a placebo-controlled trial and a published placebo-controlled trial), quetiapine (1 published open-label trial and an abstract regarding a placebo-controlled trial), and aripiprazole (1 abstract regarding a placebo-controlled trial). For example, a 12-week study of risperidone in patients with Alzheimer's disease showed a dose-related improvement in psychosis and agitation. The frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) was also significantly greater in patients receiving the highest doses. A 6-week study of olanzapine showed greater improvement than placebo in agitation/aggression and psychosis with doses of 5 and 10 mg/day, but not 15 mg/day, with side effects including gait disturbance and sedation at all doses. A 52-week, open-label trial of quetiapine (median dose = 138 mg/day) in elderly patients with psychosis suggested good tolerability with apparent behavioral benefit; EPS improved or remained unchanged in most patients. Limited data describing aripiprazole have shown inconclusive evidence regarding relief of psychosis in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease-related dementia, with apparently good tolerability over the short term. It appears that, in the aggregate, atypical antipsychotics are efficacious for treatment of agitation in dementia, with less clear impact on psychosis, but their tolerability profiles clearly differ. The National Institute of Mental Health-funded Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness in Alzheimer's Disease project will provide the first head-to-head comparisons of atypicals in dementia and will examine possible drug-drug differences between efficacy and effectiveness.",

    "185": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) characteristically presents with early memory loss. Regulation of K(+) channels, calcium homeostasis, and protein kinase C (PKC) activation are molecular events that have been implicated during associative memory which are also altered or defective in AD. PKC is also involved in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a central element in AD pathophysiology. In previous studies, we demonstrated that benzolactam (BL), a novel PKC activator, reversed K(+) channels defects and enhanced secretion of APP alpha in AD cells. In this study we present data showing that another PKC activator, bryostatin 1, at subnanomolar concentrations dramatically enhances the secretion of the alpha-secretase product sAPP alpha in fibroblasts from AD patients. We also show that BL significantly increased the amount of sAPP alpha and reduced A beta 40 in the brains of APP[V717I] transgenic mice. In a more recently developed AD double-transgenic mouse, bryostatin was effective in reducing both brain A beta 40 and A beta 42. In addition, bryostatin ameliorated the rate of premature death and improved behavioral outcomes. Collectively, these data corroborate PKC and its activation as a potentially important means of ameliorating AD pathophysiology and perhaps cognitive impairment, thus offering a promising target for drug development. Because bryostatin 1 is devoid of tumor-promoting activity and is undergoing numerous clinical studies for cancer treatment in humans, it might be readily tested in patients as a potential therapeutic agent for Alzheimer's disease.",
