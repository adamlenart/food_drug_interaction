    "0": "The involvement of nitric oxide (NO) in stress-induced neurobehavioral changes in rats was evaluated using the elevated plus maze and open field tests. Restraint stress (1 h) reduced both the number of entries and time spent in open arms, with both expressed as percent of controls (no restraint stress), and these changes were reversed with diazepam (1 mg/kg) and the NO precursor, L-arginine (500 and 1000 mg/kg) pretreatment. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (50 mg/kg), aggravated restraint stress effects in the elevated plus maze test, whereas the lower dose (10 mg/kg) of the drug attenuated the same. In the open field test, the restraint stress-induced (a) increased entry latency and (b) decreased ambulation and rearing were reversed by diazepam and L-arginine and L-NAME (10 mg/kg), whereas L-NAME (50 mg/kg) aggravated restraint stress effects. The neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (10 and 50 mg/kg), did not influence these restraint stress-induced behavioral changes to any significant extent. Biochemical data showed that L-NAME (10 and 50 mg/kg.) induced opposite effects on the total brain nitrate/nitrite content during restraint stress. The results indicate a possible involvement of NO in stress-induced neurobehavioral effects.", 
    "1": "The nonserotonergic benzodiazepine, triazolam, was compared with two 5-HT1A receptor agonists, 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone, in squirrel monkeys responding under a repeated-acquisition procedure. In each session, subjects acquired a 4-response sequence by responding sequentially on 3 keys in the presence of 4 discriminative stimuli (colors). Response sequences for each session were maintained by food presentation under a second-order fixed-ratio schedule. Errors produced a brief time-out but did not reset the sequence. In general, all of the drugs produced dose-dependent decreases in overall response rate and increases in the percentage of errors as the cumulative dose was increased. Together, these results indicate that 5-HT1A receptor agonists disrupt learning in squirrel monkeys by producing rate-decreasing and error-increasing effects in a manner comparable with the nonserotonergic benzodiazepine triazolam.", 
    "2": "We assessed the impact of real danger on several aspects of the panic disorder (PD) patients' psychopathology and level of disability. At the time of the NATO air strikes on Belgrade, 84 PD patients who were in partial or complete remission were administered the Panic and Agoraphobia Scale (PAS). All had been treated previously, and the majority (58.3%) were taking antipanic medications. The PAS, which was used as part of the regular follow-up assessment battery for PD patients, measures the overall severity of PD and the severity of key aspects and components of PD. Compared to the PAS assessments made before the onset of air strikes, the PAS assessments made at the time of air strikes showed significant differences in terms of decreased overall severity of PD, fewer health concerns, decrease in the level of disability, and greater intensity and frequency of anticipatory anxiety. Differences on the measures of panic attacks and agoraphobic avoidance were negligible. These results suggest that there is no relationship between panic attacks and real danger and lend support to the notion that panic attacks and fear induced by real danger are different phenomena. Contrary to the expectations of many PD patients, the presence of real danger does not seem to be associated with deterioration in their functioning, and PD patients can be reassured that they are not likely to cope worse under conditions of danger.", 
    "3": "The putative role of dopamine in the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia (TD) makes the genes coding for dopamine receptors the appropriate candidates for study. We investigate the association of the polymorphism of the Ser311Cys and Ser9Gly of the dopamine D2 (DRD2) and D3 receptor (DRD3) genes respectively with TD in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. In a case-control study, 117 Chinese patients with TD were compared to 200 patients without TD. Patients were diagnosed to have schizophrenia according to DSM-IV criteria. Dyskinesia was assessed by the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), whereas extrapyramidal side-effects (EPSE) were assessed by the Simpson-Angus Rating Scale. Genotype groups were comparable in age, gender, duration of illness, daily neuroleptic and benzodiazepine dose as well as the mean scores for EPSE. We failed to find an association between the polymorphism of the DRD2 gene with TD but found an increased risk of developing TD among those with D3 serine/serine genotype. Our results did not indicate that the D2 genotype has a role in the pathophysiology of TD in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. The association of TD with the serine/serine genotype of the DRD3 may be an epiphenomenon of patients with a subtype of schizophrenia who had more exposure to neuroleptics.", 
    "4": "This double-blind, randomized, multicenter study investigated the use of divalproex with an antipsychotic agent in patients hospitalized for acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Patients (n = 249) who met DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia were randomly assigned to receive olanzapine monotherapy, risperidone monotherapy, divalproex plus olanzapine, or divalproex plus risperidone for 28 days. Divalproex was initiated at 15 mg/kg/day and titrated over 12 days to a maximum dosage of 30 mg/kg/day. Olanzapine and risperidone, were, respectively, initiated at 5 and 2 mg/day and were titrated over the first 6 days to respective target fixed daily dosages of 15 and 6 mg/day. Improvements from baseline were observed at all evaluation points throughout the 28-day treatment period in the two combination therapy and the two antipsychotic monotherapy groups, with statistically significant treatment differences favoring combination therapy as soon as day 3 for Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score, derived Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRSd) total score, as well as PANSS and BPRSd subscales. These findings were confirmed in post hoc repeated-measures analyses of variance in which treatment differences favoring combination therapy were observed for PANSS total (p = 0.020) and PANSS positive scale scores (p = 0.002). Both combination therapy and antipsychotic monotherapy were well tolerated. Treatment with divalproex in combination with an atypical antipsychotic agent resulted in earlier improvements in a range of psychotic symptoms among acutely hospitalized patients with schizophrenia. Further evaluation is warranted to confirm these findings.", 
    "5": "The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone is a potent gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor modulator with anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. Olanzapine and clozapine also have anxiolytic-like effects in behavioral models. We therefore postulated that olanzapine and clozapine would elevate allopregnanolone levels, but risperidone and haloperidol would have minimal effects. Male rats received intraperitoneal olanzapine (2.5-10.0 mg/kg), clozapine (5.0-20.0 mg/kg), risperidone (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), or vehicle. Cerebral cortical allopregnanolone and peripheral progesterone and corticosterone levels were determined. Adrenalectomized animals were also examined. Both olanzapine and clozapine increased cerebral cortical allopregnanolone levels, but neither risperidone nor haloperidol had significant effects. Olanzapine and clozapine also increased serum progesterone and corticosterone levels. Adrenalectomy prevented olanzapine- and clozapine-induced elevations in allopregnanolone. Allopregnanolone induction may contribute to olanzapine and clozapine anxiolytic, antidepressant, and mood-stabilizing actions. Alterations in this neuroactive steroid may result in the modulation of GABAergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission, potentially contributing to antipsychotic efficacy.",

    "10": "Determination of hepatic and intestinal cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity is important, because CYP3A substrates show substantial variability in plasma concentrations as a result of variations in both hepatic and intestinal metabolism. The goals of this study were (1) to determine whether the hepatic and intestinal extraction ratios (ER(H) and ER(G), respectively) of the CYP3A probe drug midazolam are different when determined after semisimultaneous administration, as compared with administration on separate occasions (traditional method), and (2) to evaluate the hepatic and intestinal metabolism of midazolam in the presence and absence of ketoconazole by the semisimultaneous method.",

The patients were suffering from chronic obstructive bronchopneumopathy, subjected to mechanical ventilation and sedated with remifentanil. The sample was then compared with another 2 groups (homogeneous with the first) of 20 patients each, treated with propofol and midazolam as the only drug. Following an initial bolus of 2 mg/kg (+/-0.04) for propofol and 0.15 mg/kg (+/-0.03) for midazolam (no bolus for remifentanil), the doses of subsequent continuous infusion (initial doses in the case of remifentanil) were: 0.05 mcg/kg/m (+/-0.01) for remifentanil; 1 mg/kg/h (+/-0.04) for propofol; 0.03 mg/kg/h (+/-0.006) for midazolam. In order to assess the level and quality of sedation, 2 subjective evaluation scales (Ramsey score and the Sedation-Agitation Score: SAS) and one system of objective evaluation (Bispectral Index; BIS) were employed.

We examined this hypothesis by administering diazepam to rats subjected to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) using the intraluminal thread method. Diffusion MRI (DWI) and perfusion imaging (PI) were acquired during MCAO to assess brain tissue status and haemodynamics, respectively. Rats were intraperitoneally injected with either 10 mg kg(-1) diazepam (n = 5) or vehicle (n = 5) both 30 min and 90 min after the onset of MCAO. To exclude the possibility that neuroprotection was due to the hypothermic action of the drug, body temperature was maintained at 37-38 degrees C for up to 7 h postischaemia with a feed-back controlled thermoregulatory unit. Infarct volumes quantified 2 days after MCAO from T(2)-weighted images were similar in ischaemic control rats and in ischaemic rats treated with diazepam. We conclude that diazepam-induced enhancement of GABA(A) activity does not effectively protect against neuronal damage that occurs after transient MCAO in normothermic rats.",

Signs and symptoms of abuse in older adults vary from those presented in younger persons and this variation can complicate the diagnosis. Validated screening tools, such as CAGE and MAST-G, can aid diagnosis, but primary care physicians also need to be alert to suspicious medical conditions often associated with substance use disorders. Treatment goal is almost always abstinence; although efficacy remains uncertain, brief interventions by primary care physicians are recommended when patients are identified as at-risk. Pharmacotherapies may be used, but caution is advised due to associated side effects.

    "30": "Although [(11)C]Ro15-4513 and [(11)C]flumazenil both bind to the central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors, the distributions of the two ligands are not identical in vivo. Moreover, the in vivo pharmacological properties of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 have not been thoroughly examined. In the present study, we examined the pharmacological profile of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in the monkey brain using positron emission tomography (PET). [(11)C]Ro15-4513 showed relatively high accumulation in the anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and insular cortex, with the lowest uptake being observed in the pons. Accumulation in the cerebral cortex was significantly diminished by the BZ antagonist flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), but not that in the pons. Using the pons as a reference region, the specific binding of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 in most of the cerebral cortex including the limbic regions clearly revealed two different affinity sites. On the other hand, specific binding in the occipital cortex and cerebellum showed only a low affinity site. Zolpidem with affinity for alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 subunits of GABA(A)/BZ receptor fully inhibited [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in the occipital cortex and cerebellum, while only about 23% of the binding was blocked in the anterior cingulate cortex. Diazepam with affinity for alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5 subunits inhibited the binding in all brain regions. Since Ro15-4513 has relatively high affinity for the alpha5 subunit in vitro, these in vivo bindings of [(11)C]Ro15-4513 can be interpreted as the relatively high accumulation in the fronto-temporal limbic regions representing binding to the GABA(A)/BZ receptor alpha5 subunit.",

Investigation of the neurobiological basis of GAD has provided suggestive evidence to implicate dysfunction of serotonergic and noradrenergic systems in the expression of GAD, as well as the depressive disorders. Hence, there may be a neurobiological link between GAD and depression through the activity of the serotonin and norepinephrine systems. The use of various anxiolytics and antidepressants, including benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in the treatment of GAD is reviewed.

Outpatients, who were actively receiving treatment with olanzapine, were evaluated for peripheral oedema. Twenty-eight (57%) out of 49 subjects exhibited oedema, including five (10.2%) to a severe degree. There were no significant differences regarding gender, time/dose on olanzapine, concomitant diagnoses or psychotropic medication. There was a tendency (P < 0.10) for older age and greater frequency of thyroid abnormalities in those individuals with oedema. In the oedema group, there was a positive correlation (P < 0.05) between age and severity. Our finding, far from demonstrating that olanzapine causes oedema at this frequency, suggests that there maybe patients who are vulnerable to developing this side-effect.", 
    "61": "Risperidone and olanzapine-administration data were collected for schizophrenia patients treated at four Taiwanese medical centres. Only stable patients maintained on a medication at a dose that had remained unchanged for more than 1 month were included in the analysis. Of the 268 cases, 175 were treated with risperidone and 93 with olanzapine at mean daily doses of 3.56 +/- 1.54 mg and 12.21 +/- 4.99 mg, respectively. The majority of the risperidone-treated patients (73.2%) received 2-4 mg per day, with another 19.0% receiving 5-6 mg. A daily dose of 10-20 mg was received by 82.9% of the olanzapine group. Although the mean daily doses for both drugs were slightly higher for inpatients than outpatients, statistical significance was not achieved. Further, no gender or age-group dose differences were demonstrated for either drug.", 
    "62": "The superiority of olanzapine to haloperidol with respect to a decreased incidence of treatment-emergent extrapyramidal syndromes (EPS) in patients with schizophrenia was demonstrated in studies conducted in both Japan and Western countries. EPS measurements used in Western countries included the Simpson-Angus, Barnes akathisia and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale, while the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptom Scale (DIEPSS) was used in Japan. The aim of this study was to clarify how the DIEPSS captures EPS profiles. The baseline prevalence and treatment-emergent incidence of EPS in Japanese schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or haloperidol were retrospectively compared as assessed by the DIEPSS to the prevalence and incidence of EPS in primarily Caucasian schizophrenic patients who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol. Specifically, the prevalence and incidence of dyskinesia, akathisia and parkinsonism were compared between the Japanese trial and an international trial to examine if appropriate definitions using the DIEPSS can be derived assuming that a comparable prevalence and incidence of the syndromes would be observed when any differences in residual antipsychotic exposure at the initiation of study treatment were accounted for. For the incidence of all EPS syndromes, odds ratios were observed to be similar between the two studies, indicating that appropriate criteria for the clinical diagnosis of the EPS syndromes could be established based on the DIEPSS. This preliminary and retrospective work suggests that the DIEPSS can be used to operationally define the presence or absence, and make the clinical diagnosis, of specific EPS syndromes.", 
    "63": "This study was designed to investigate the effects of the cholinesterase inhibitors soman and pyridostigmine bromide (PB) on synaptic transmission in the CA1 field of rat hippocampal slices. Soman (1-100 nM, 10-15 min) decreased the amplitude of GABAergic postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and recorded from CA1 pyramidal neurons. It also decreased the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous IPSCs recorded from pyramidal neurons. Whereas the maximal effect of soman on evoked GABAergic transmission was observed at 10 nM, full cholinesterase inhibition was induced by 1 nM soman. After 10-15-min exposure of hippocampal slices to 100 nM PB, GABAergic transmission was facilitated and cholinesterase activity was not significantly affected. At nanomolar concentrations, soman and PB have no direct effect on GABA(A) receptors. The effects of soman and PB on GABAergic transmission were inhibited by the m2 receptor antagonist 11-[[[2-diethylamino-O-methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl]-5,11-dihydrol-6H-pyridol[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6- one (1 nM) and the m3 receptor antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine (100 nM), respectively, and by the nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 microM). Thus, changes in GABAergic transmission are likely to result from direct interactions of soman and PB with m2 and m3 receptors, respectively, located on GABAergic fibers/neurons synapsing onto the neurons under study. Although the effects of 1 nM soman and 100 nM PB were diametrically opposed, they only canceled one another when PB was applied to the neurons before soman. Therefore, PB, acting via m3 receptors, can effectively counteract effects arising from the interactions of soman with m2 receptors in the brain.", 
    "64": "Positive GABAA modulators and other sedatives, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants were used to evaluate mechanisms underlying the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam in untreated monkeys and of flumazenil in monkeys treated with diazepam (5.6 mg/kg/day). Positive GABAA modulators at benzodiazepine (e.g., flunitrazepam and abecarnil) and neuroactive steroid sites (e.g., androsterone) substituted for midazolam in all monkeys; the neuroactive steroids dihydroandrosterone and epipregnanolone substituted for midazolam in two of three monkeys. All positive GABAA modulators attenuated flumazenil in diazepam-treated monkeys; doses of flunitrazepam and abecarnil larger than doses substituting for midazolam were required to attenuate flumazenil, whereas doses of neuroactive steroids smaller than doses substituting for midazolam attenuated flumazenil. Drugs with mechanisms that do not predominantly involve allosteric modulation of GABA (e.g., buspirone, ketamine, valproic acid, and diphenhydramine) did not substitute for midazolam or flumazenil. However, valproic acid enhanced the midazolam discriminative stimulus and attenuated the flumazenil discriminative stimulus; diphenhydramine attenuated the midazolam discriminative stimulus. These results suggest that drugs not sharing a mechanism of action with benzodiazepines can modulate the behavioral effects of benzodiazepines. In addition, this study demonstrates that endogenous ligands, presumably by acting at neuroactive steroid sites on the GABAA receptor complex, share discriminative stimulus effects with benzodiazepines. This study also suggests that positive GABAA-modulating neuroactive steroids are especially potent in attenuating behavioral effects that are related to diazepam withdrawal.", 
    "65": "A mechanism-based pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model for neuroactive steroids, comprising a separate characterization of 1) the receptor activation process and 2) the stimulus-response relationship, was applied to various nonsteroidal GABAA receptor modulators. The EEG effects of nine prototypical GABAA receptor modulators (six benzodiazepines, one imidazopyridine, one cyclopyrrolone, and one beta-carboline) were determined in rats in conjunction with plasma concentrations. Population PK/PD modeling revealed monophasic concentration-EEG effect relationships with large differences in potency (EC50) and intrinsic activity between the compounds. The data were analyzed on the basis of the mechanism-based PK/PD model for (synthetic) neuroactive steroids on the assumption of a single and unique stimulus-response relationship. The model converged yielding estimates of both the apparent in vivo receptor affinity (KPD) and the in vivo intrinsic efficacy (ePD). The values of KPD ranged from 0.41 +/- 0 ng.ml(-1) for bretazenil to 436 +/- 72 ng.ml(-1) for clobazam and the values for e(PD) from -0.27 +/- 0 for methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate to 0.54 +/- 0.02 for diazepam. Significant linear correlations were observed between KPD for unbound concentrations and the affinity in an in vitro receptor bioassay (r = 0.93) and between e(PD) and the GABA-shift in vitro (r = 0.95). The findings of this investigation show that the in vivo effects of nonsteroidal GABAA receptor modulators and (synthetic) neuroactive steroids can be described on the basis of a single unique transducer function. In this paradigm, the nonsteroidal GABAA receptor modulators behave as partial agonists relative to neuroactive steroids.", 
    "66": "Enhancement of the activation of GABAA receptors is a common feature of many sedative and hypnotic drugs, and it is probable that the GABAA receptor complex is a molecular target for these drugs in the mammalian central nervous system. We set out to elucidate the role of the two predominant (alpha1 and beta2) subunits of GABAA receptor in sedative drug action by studying mice lacking these two subunits. Both alpha1 (-/-) and beta2 (-/-) null mutant mice showed markedly decreased sleep time induced by nonselective benzodiazepine, flurazepam, and GABAA agonist, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo(5,4-c)pyridin-3-ol. The sleep time induced by the beta-selective drug etomidate was decreased only in beta2 (-/-) knockout mice. In contrast, alpha1 (-/-) mice were more resistant to the alpha1-selective drug zolpidem than beta2 (-/-) or wild-type animals. Knockout mice of both strains were similar to wild-type mice in their responses to pentobarbital. The duration of loss of the righting reflex produced by ethanol was decreased in male mice for both null alleles compared with wild-type mice, but there were no differences in ethanol-induced sleep time in mutant females. Deletion of either the alpha1 or beta2 subunits reduced the muscimol-stimulated 36Cl36 influx in cortical microsacs suggesting that these mutant mice have reduced number of functional brain GABAA receptors. Our results show that removal of either alpha1 or beta2 subunits of GABAA receptors produce strong and selective decreases in hypnotic effects of different drugs. Overall, these data confirm the crucial role of the GABAA receptor in mechanisms mediating sedative/hypnotic effects.", 
    "67": "Eight patients with refractory GERD symptoms were controlled over a mean of 15.4 years only by the addition of a benzodiazepine to once-daily or twice-daily PPI therapy. In selected patients with refractory GERD, as defined by continued reflux symptoms despite twice-daily PPIs, the addition of a benzodiazepine to the PPI regimen may provide additional control of GERD symptoms.", 
    "68": "Pulmonary inflammation induced in the rabbit lung by the intravenous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) increases the lung uptake of 14C-diazepam from the pulmonary circulation. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which mitochondrial (or peripheral) benzodiazepine receptors (mBRs) may contribute to this increased uptake. To this end, we measured the pulmonary venous effluent concentration versus time for 14C-diazepam following its injection into the pulmonary artery of isolated perfused normal and CFA inflamed lungs with and without an inhibitor (PK11195) of diazepam binding to mBRs. The results demonstrate that this model of pulmonary inflammation is associated with an increase in lung tissue mBR. Lung tissue caspase-3 activity was also measured as one index of lung inflammation, and we found that in inflamed lungs, there was an inverse correlation between mBR density and lung tissue capase-3 activity. This is consistent with observations in other organs and a role for mBRs in apoptotic elimination of inflammatory cells in the resolution of this inflammatory response. The results suggest the potential utility of mBR ligands for noninvasive detection and/or characterization of pulmonary inflammation, e.g., via nuclear medicine methods.", 
    "69": "Cannabinoids such as delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta(9)-THC) or WIN-55,212-2 (WIN-2) have psychoactive effects on cognition. As a result, the reinforcing properties of delta(9)-THC or WIN-2 may confound learning and memory tests with false negative results. It therefore seems advisable to assess the reinforcing properties of the drugs in the same behavioural model used for learning experiments.", 
    "70": "We therefore developed conditioned place preference protocols in the open-field water maze and tested both delta(9)-THC (2 mg/kg) and WIN-2 (1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg). Given that previous reports on cannabinoids have revealed conflicting data and that this was a novel behavioural test, we also tested the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam (2.5 mg/kg). Some methodical refinements were appropriate in order to determine the behavioural strategy implemented by the animals.", 
    "71": "All animals were injected intraperitoneally 30 min prior to training/testing. In experiment 1, male hooded Lister rats injected with drug were repeatedly placed on the drug-related platform and subsequently tested for place preference. In experiment 2, rats were trained to swim to the drug platform on drug days and to the vehicle platform on vehicle days. A series of probe trials was introduced to delineate what had been learned. Experiment 3 studied the effect of WIN-2 on spatial learning in the water maze.", 
    "72": "Neither WIN-2 nor delta(9)-THC induced place preference in the water maze. When trained in the swim procedure, however, WIN-2 was neutral, but Delta(9)-THC resulted in place aversion. Conversely, diazepam consistently produced place preference in both procedures. WIN-2 (3 mg/kg), however, produced a small learning deficit in the spatial water maze task.", 
    "73": "It appears that the reinforcing properties of delta(9)-THC and WIN-2 in the doses used here are different, despite them both being agonists at cannabinoid receptors within the central nervous system. The fact that delta(9)-THC may be aversively related to a particular context has implications for previous work reporting deficits in spatial learning.", 
    "74": "One of the pharmacological targets of ethanol is the GABAA receptor (GABAR), whose function and expression are altered after chronic administration of ethanol. The details of the changes differ between experimental models. In the chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) model for alcohol dependence, rats are exposed to intermittent episodes of intoxicating ethanol and withdrawal, leading to a kindling-like state of behavioral excitability. This is accompanied by presumably causal changes in GABAR expression and physiology. The present study investigates further the effect of CIE on GABAR function and expression. CIE is validated as a model for human alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) by demonstrating increased level of anxiety; diazepam improved performance in the test. In addition, CIE rats showed remarkably reduced hypnotic response to a benzodiazepine and a steroid anesthetic, reduced sensitivity to a barbiturate, but not propofol. Immunoblotting revealed decrease in alpha1 and delta expression and increase in gamma2 and alpha4 subunits in hippocampus of CIE rats, confirmed by an increase in diazepam-insensitive binding for ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo(1,5-alpha)(1,4)benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro15-4513). Elevated mRNA levels were shown for the gamma2S and gamma1 subunits. Recordings in hippocampal slices from CIE rats revealed that the decay time of GABAR-mediated miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in CA1 pyramidal cells was decreased, and potentiation of mIPCSs by positive modulators of GABAR was also reduced compared with control rats. However, mIPSC potentiation by the alpha4-preferring benzodiazepine ligands bretazenil and Ro15-4513 was maintained, and increased, respectively. These data suggest that specific alterations in GABAR occur after CIE and may underlie the development of hyperexcitability and ethanol dependence.", 
    "75": "In the hippocampus, two distinct forms of GABAergic inhibition have been identified, phasic inhibitory postsynaptic currents that are the consequence of the vesicular release of GABA and a tonic conductance that is activated by low ambient concentrations of extracellular GABA. It is not known what accounts for the distinct properties of receptors that mediate the phasic and tonic inhibitory conductances. Moreover, the physiological role of the tonic inhibitory conductance remains uncertain because pharmacological tools that clearly distinguish tonic and phasic receptors are lacking. Here, we demonstrate that GABAA receptors that generate a tonic conductance in cultured hippocampal neurons from embryonic mice have different pharmacological properties than those in cerebellar granule neurons or pyramidal neurons in the dentate gyrus. The tonic conductance in cultured hippocampal neurons is enhanced by the benzodiazepine, midazolam, and is insensitive to the inhibitory effects of the competitive antagonist, gabazine (< or =10 microM). We also identify penicillin as an uncompetitive antagonist that selectively inhibits the synaptic but not tonic conductance. GABA was applied to hippocampal neurons to investigate the properties of synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. GABA-evoked current was composed of two components: a rapidly desensitizing current that was blocked by penicillin and a nondesensitizing current that was insensitive to penicillin blockade. The potency of GABA was greater for the penicillin-insensitive nondesensitizing current. Single-channel studies show that the gabazine-insensitive GABAA receptors have a lower unitary conductance (12 pS) than that estimated for synaptic receptors. Thus, specialized GABAA receptors with an apparent higher affinity for GABA that do not readily desensitize mediate the persistent tonic conductance in hippocampal neurons. The receptors underlying tonic and phasic inhibitory conductances in hippocampal neurons are pharmacologically and biophysically distinct, suggesting that they serve different physiological roles.",

One patient had to take 90 mg/day. One patient was excluded because of poor performance in the methadone maintenance program (MMP). In the pre-treatment evaluation, 22% of the patients did not use BZP and 40% used only cocaine. Sixty three percent used cocaine in higher dose than 0.5 g/day. (Range: 0.5-2 g). Abusive alcohol drinkers or patients with severe organic or psychiatric impairment were discarded.", 
    "78": "MTZ is well tolerated and its adverse effects are welcome in this kind of patients. Adherence to treatment was quite good for these reasons and because MTZ has a short latency time. No dose adjustments or interactions with other prescriptions (e.g., HAART), were shown. Hamilton-17, GCI, stress and craving scales were employed. Drug use was monitored with enzyme immune assay.

    "80": "1. Midazolam is metabolized in the rat by CYP3A enzymes to 4-OH-midazolam (4-OH-MDZ) and 1'-OH-midazolam (1'-OH-MDZ). The induction of midazolam metabolism was studied in male Wistar rats treated with dexamethasone (50 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) during 4 days via the oral or intravenous routes. Microsomes were prepared from the liver and the proximal small intestine and in vitro metabolism of midazolam was determined. In addition, CYP3A1- and CYP3A2-like protein levels were measured by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. 2. The V(max)'s (mean SEM) for 4-OH-MDZ and 1'-OH-MDZ formation were much lower in intestinal (0.078 +/- 0.002 and 0.074 +/- 0.002 microM min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively) compared with hepatic microsomes prepared from the uninduced rat (0.870 +/- 0.007 and 0.310 +/- 0.020 microM min(-1) mg(-1) protein, respectively). Induction by oral or intravenous dexamethasone pretreatment led to significant increases in V(max) for 4-OH-MDZ and 1'-OH-MDZ by both intestinal and hepatic microsomes. Oral dexamethasone pretreatment via the oral route resulted in a more pronounced increase in V(max) compared with intravenous administration of the inducer. 3. CYP3A1 and CYP3A2 protein levels in liver microsomes were significantly increased following oral (3.7- and 3.2-fold, respectively) or intravenous (2.6- and 2.1-fold, respectively) pretreatment with dexamethasone. On the contrary, only oral dexamethasone pretreatment resulted in a significant change in intestinal CYP3A2-like protein (7.3-fold). A slight difference in the migration distance of the immunoreactive band for CYP3A2 was also observed for intestinal microsomes. 4. These results suggest that intestinal CYP3A enzymes in the rat differ from hepatic CYP3A1 and CYP3A2. They also demonstrate that systemic dexamethasone administration can induce intestinal microsome activity.", 
    "81": "1. The aim was to compare the metabolic activity of human CYP3A4 expressed in bacteria (E. coli), yeast (S. cerevisiae) and human lymphoblastoid cells (hBl), with the native CYP3A4 activity observed in a panel of human livers. 2. Three CYP3A4 substrates were selected for study: dextromethorphan (DEM), midazolam (MDZ) and diazepam (DZ). The substrate metabolism in each of the four systems was characterized by deriving the kinetic parameters K(m) or S(50), V(max) and intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) or maximum clearance (CL(max)) from the kinetic profiles; the latter differing by 100-fold across the three substrates. 3. The K(m) or S(50) for the formation of metabolites 3-methoxymorphinan (MEM), 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1'-OH MDZ) and 3-hydroxydiazepam (3HDZ) compared well in all systems. For CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of DEM, MDZ and DZ, the V(max) for hBl microsomes were generally 2-9-fold higher than the respective yeast and human liver microsomes and E. coli membrane preparations, resulting in greater CL(int) or CL(max). In the case of 3HDZ formation, non-linear kinetics were observed for E. coli, hBl microsomes and human liver microsomes, whereas the kinetics observed for S. cerevisiae were linear. 4. The use of native human liver microsomes for drug metabolic studies will always be preferable. However, owing to the limited availability of human tissues, we find it is reasonable to use any of the recombinant systems described herein, since all three recombinant systems gave good predictions of the native human liver enzyme activities.", 
    "82": "Enzyme load in pancreas has been considered a risk factor in the development of acute pancreatitis. In order to confirm this hypothesis our aim was to analyze the development and evolution of acute pancreatitis (AP) induced by bile-pancreatic duct obstruction (BPDO) after reducing the pancreatic enzyme content. L-364,718 - a potent CCK-receptor antagonist - was administered (0.1 mg/kg/day) for 7 days before inducing AP by BPDO. The course of AP was evaluated at different times from 1.5-48 h after BPDO. Amylase and trypsinogen contents and cytosolic calcium levels were measured by flow cytometry using specific antisera against pancreatic enzymes labelled with isothiocyanate of fluorescein and Fluo 3, respectively. The severity of the disease at the different stages was evaluated by measurements of amylase activity in ascites and plasma, percentage of pancreatic fluid and haematocrit. Electron microscopy study of the pancreas showed an increased number of zymogen granules spread through the acinar cells of control rats treated with L-364,718 for 7 days, however, total enzyme content in individual acinar cells was significantly (p < 0.01) diminished. AP significantly increased intracellular amylase and trypsinogen load from 3-12 h after BPDO, and prior L-364,718 treatment enhanced the blockade of enzyme secretion. As a result, acinar enzyme content was significantly increased from earlier stages (1.5 h after BPDO). In parallel, increased cytosolic calcium levels observed up to 24 h after BPDO appeared earlier in L-364,718-treated rats than in those not treated. The severity of AP seems to have been higher in rats previously treated with the CCK-receptor antagonist as indicated by the significantly higher pancreatic fluid and amylase activity in ascites and plasma observed at different times after BPDO. Our results indicate that there is no correlation between the severity of pancreatitis and the amount of enzymes accumulated in the pancreas before the disease is induced.", 
    "83": "Semi-micro column high-performance liquid chromatographic method with ultraviolet detection for the determination of triazolam (TZ) in rat plasma and brain microdialysate is described. The separation was achieved on a 250 x 1.5 mm, i.d. C(18) column and the column effluent was monitored at 222 nm. The detection limits at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 obtained using spiked plasma and artificial cerebrospinal fluid were 2.1 and 0.7 ng/ml, respectively. The method was applied to drug-drug interaction study of TZ with itraconazole (ITZ). The peak concentration (C(max)) and the area under the curve (AUC) of TZ in brain microdialysate after simultaneous administration of TZ (2.5 mg/kg, intravenously (i.v.)) and ITZ (25 mg/kg, p.o.) to rats increased 3.4-folds (P<0.001) and 2.9-folds (P<0.001), respectively, compared to those of TZ alone. Also, the AUC of TZ in plasma increased 2.6-folds and remarkable delay in its elimination half-life (t(1/2)) was observed. The concentrations of TZ in brain microdialysate and plasma were also measured after single administration of TZ (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats pretreated with daily administration of ITZ (25 mg/kg, p.o.) once a day for a week. There was no significant difference in TZ's C(max) in both ITZ treatments (P>0.2) however its t(1/2) after the daily pretreatment with ITZ was significantly increased (P<0.05). In plasma, the AUC of TZ after daily pretreatment of ITZ was lower than the single combined treatment, but significantly different from TZ's AUC in the absence of ITZ (P<0.05). As a result, single simultaneous administration of TZ with ITZ and single administration of TZ after daily pretreatment with ITZ to rats, ITZ seriously interfered with the pharmacokinetic parameters of TZ in plasma and brain micodialysate.", 
    "84": "Sensitive determination of benzodiazepines i.e., alprazolam (ALP), estazolam (EST), and midazolam (MDZ), and their metabolites, was carried out by reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS). The chromatography separations were achieved using a semi-micro HPLC column (3 microm particle size; 100 x 2.0 mm, i.d.) with acetonitrile-water containing 1% acetic acid as eluent. The mass spectrometer was operated in selected-ion monitoring mode at protonated-molecular ions [M+H](+) of parent drugs and the metabolites. The proposed procedure was applied to the determination in hair shaft of Dark Agouti rats after intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of benzodiazepines twice a day for 5 days. Various metabolites together with parent drugs were identified in the hair shaft, 1-hydroxyalprazolam (1-HA) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4-HA) from ALP administration; 8-chloro-6-phenyl-4H-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a][1,4]benzodiazepine-4-one (K-EST) from EST administration; 1-hydroxymidazolam (1-HM) and 4-hydroxymidazolam (4-HM) from MDZ administration. A few unknown metabolites were also detected in the hair samples. These structures were elucidated with acetylation using acetic anhydride and pyridine. The time course studies of parent drugs and the metabolites in both hair root and plasma were also carried out after single i.p. administration of benzodiazepines. The results suggested that the concentrations of parent drugs and the metabolites in the hair samples were mainly dependent upon those in the plasma.", 
    "85": "It should be clear from this discussion that coma cocktails are a bad idea and should be immediately abandoned. In fact, the indiscriminate use of the coma cocktail may indeed harm patients, EMS has evolved to a point where any EMS provider should be able to reasonably determine the most likely cause of coma, or, in a worst-case scenario, narrow the cause to but a few possibilities. Certainly, patients with bona fide hypoglycemia should receive IV glucose. Because the consequences of prolonged hypoglycemia are severe, if there's a doubt about whether hypoglycemia is present, then glucose should be empirically administered. Naloxone should be used only for those cases in which a narcotic overdose appears likely. Similarly thiamine administration should be limited to patients suspected of chronic alcohol abuse and who exhibit at least one of the three symptoms of WE described above. Flumazenil has no role in the routine treatment of coma unless the patient is known to not be benzodiazepine dependent and the overdose is known to result only from benzos--two very difficult requirements to verify in the back of an ambulance at 2 a.m. Coma cocktails are bad medicine. Let's banish them from our EMS armamentarium.",

    "102": "A comprehensive review of the most recent publications in English assessing inappropriate prescriptions for elderly patients in the United States using the 1997 version of the Beers explicit criteria. The reviewed articles were obtained via an electronic search of the MEDLINE database for articles published between 1997 and 2001 and a manual search through major journals for articles referenced in those located through MEDLINE. Search terms were Beers, explicit criteria, inappropriate drug use, prescribing, prescriptions, medication use, elderly, and health outcomes.", 
    "103": "Using the updated explicit criteria, a total of 11 empirical studies were identified, all of which were conducted using observational surveys or claims databases. The reported prevalence of elderly patients using at least one inappropriately prescribed drug ranged from a high of 40% for a population of nursing home patients to 21.3% for community-dwelling patients over age 65. Propoxyphene, amitriptyline, long-acting benzodiazepines (e.g., chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, flurazepam), and dipyridamole are among the most commonly occurring inappropriate prescriptions. With a few exceptions, the most significant patient-related predictors of inappropriate prescribing include polypharmacy, poor health status, and female sex. Other potential risk factors include prescribing location, ethnicity, age, and referral status. Limited evidence was found of increased health care utilization and poorer quality of life resulting from inappropriate drug use in the elderly in Medicare health maintenance organization and emergency department settings.",

    "105": "HA14-1 is a small molecular compound that was identified based on the structure of Bcl-2. HA14-1 interacts with Bcl-2 and inhibits the antiapoptotic effect of Bcl-2. We investigated the mechanism of HA14-1-induced apoptosis and found that HA14-1 induces translocation of Bax from cytosols to the mitochondria. Cells deficient in Bax were much more resistant to HA14-1-induced apoptosis, suggesting that Bax is required for this process. A pan-caspase inhibitor failed to inhibit the apoptotic effect of HA14-1, indicating that this is through a caspase-independent pathway. To eliminate the effect of cytosolic Bax, we incubated cell-free mitochondria with HA14-1 to study its effect on cytochrome c release. HA14-1 was ineffective in causing cytochrome c release from the purified mitochondria. However, the combination of HA14-1 and PK11195, an antagonist of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor of the mitochondria, enhanced the cytochrome c release by HA14-1. The combination of PK11195 and HA14-1 could therefore serve as a potentially useful approach to enhance apoptosis in cancer.", 
    "106": "GABA(A) receptor sites were characterised in cerebral cortex tissue samples from deceased neurologically normal infants who had come to autopsy during the third trimester of pregnancy. Pharmacological parameters were obtained from homogenate binding studies which utilised the 'central-type' benzodiazepine ligands [3H]diazepam and [3H]flunitrazepam, and from the GABA activation of [3H]diazepam binding. It was found that the two radioligands behaved differently during development. The affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam for its binding site did not vary significantly between preparations, whereas the [3H]diazepam K(D) showed marked regional and developmental variations: infant tissues showed a distinctly lower affinity than adults for this ligand. The density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites increased approximately 35% during the third trimester to reach adult levels by term, whereas [3H]diazepam binding capacity declined slightly but steadily throughout development. The GABA activation of [3H]diazepam binding was less efficient early in the trimester, in that the affinity of the agonist was significantly lower, though it rose to adult levels by term. The strength of the enhancement response increased to adult levels over the same time-frame. The results strongly suggest that the subunit composition of cortical GABA(A) sites changes significantly during this important developmental stage.",

In addition, the possible mechanism by which Rf may affect U50-induced analgesia was investigated. Intraperitoneal administration of U50 (40 mg/kg) produced analgesia. Rf (10(-14)-10(-10) mg/kg) on co treatment dose-dependently potentiated the U50 (40 mg/kg)-induced analgesia. Rf (10(-12)-10(-2) mg/ml) did not alter the binding of [3H] naloxone, a opioid ligand and [3H]PN200-110, a dihydropyridine ligand to mice whole brain membrane. Twice daily administration of U50 (40 mg/kg) for six days induced tolerance to its analgesia. Chronic treatment (day 4-day 6) of Rf (10(-14)-10(-10) mg/kg) to U50-tolerant mice, dose-dependently inhibited the tolerance. The inhibition of tolerance to U50-induced analgesia by Rf was not altered by flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist and picrotoxin (1 mg/kg), a GABA(A)-gated chloride channel blocker on chronic treatment. In conclusion, these findings for the first time demonstrated that ginsenoside Rf potentiates U50-induced analgesia, inhibits tolerance to its analgesia, and suggests that Rf affects U50-induced analgesia via non-opioid, non-dihydropyridine-sensitive Ca(+2) and non-benzodiazepine-GABA(A)ergic mechanisms in mice.", 
    "112": "Muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus are relevant to learning and memory, but the role of each subtype is poorly understood. Muscarinic toxins (MTs) from Dendroaspis snakes venom are selective for muscarinic receptor subtypes. MT2, a selective agonist for M(1) receptors, given into the hippocampus immediately after training, improved memory consolidation of an inhibitory avoidance task in rats, whereas the antagonist pirenzepine was amnestic, supporting a facilitatory role of M(1) receptors. Instead, MT3, a selective antagonist at M(4) receptors, caused amnesia. Neither M(1) nor M(4) receptor appeared involved in habituation to a new environment. Thus, our results suggest that memory consolidation of an inhibitory avoidance task in the rat involves the participation of both M(1) and M(4) hippocampal receptors, with a positive modulatory role.", 
    "113": "The influence of the first exposure length upon the effect of midazolam (MDZ) administration prior to the second exposure in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) was investigated. Drug-free rats were assigned to freely explore the EPM for 1, 2 or 5 min (Trial 1). Twenty-four hours later, each group was subdivided in two further groups, which were retested in the EPM for 5 min, 30 min after either saline or MDZ (1.5 mg kg(-1)) administration (Trial 2). The data showed that during Trial 2, the percentage of entries (%Open arm entries) and time spent in the open arms (%Open arm time) were decreased if rats were pre-exposed to the EPM for 2- or 5-min Trial 1, while the group submitted to 1-min Trial 1 length displayed decreased %Open arm time only. The anxiolytic effect of MDZ prior to Trial 2 was present in the group submitted to 1-min, impaired in the group submitted to 2-min and absent in the group submitted to 5-min Trial 1 length. Data are analyzed taking into account the emotional learning which underlies the exploratory behavior during the EPM Trial 2.", 
    "114": "Indorenate (5-methoxytryptamine beta-methylcarboxylate, INDO) is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) agonist that has affinity for 5-HT(1A/1B/2C) receptors. Unlike other anxiolytics such as 5-HT receptor agonists, INDO may not share tolerance or dependency with the benzodiazepine anxiolytics. It has been reported that the discriminative stimulus properties of 5-HT(1A/1B/2C) agonists, but not those of 5-HT(3/4) agonists, generalize to INDO. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to obtain further evidence on the differential involvement of 5-HT(1A/1B/2C) receptors in the discriminative stimulus properties of INDO by evaluating its interactions with antagonists of the 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(2C), and 5-HT(3/4) receptor subtypes. Rats were trained to discriminate INDO from saline in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm. For Group D(+)S(-), administration of INDO signalled that saccharin flavour was followed by LiCl, while injection of vehicle signalled safe consumption of saccharin solution. Group D(-)S(+) had the contingencies reversed. After this training, rats had generalization tests where INDO administration was preceded by different doses of the following antagonists: WAY100635 (5-HT(1A)), NAN190 (5-HT(1A)), methiothepin (5-HT(1A/1B/2C)), GR127935 (5-HT(1B/1D)), ketanserin (5-HT(2A/2C)), ritanserin (5-HT(2C/2A)), mesulergine (5-HT(2C/2A)), metergoline (5-HT(2C/2A)), SB206553 (5-HT(2B/2C)), and tropisetron (5-HT(3/4)). In Group D(+)S(-), the order of potency to block the discriminative stimulus properties of INDO was WAY100635>ketanserin>ritanserin>GR127935>mesulergine congruent with SB206553>metergoline>methiothepin>NAN190, while in Group D(-)S(+), the order was WAY100635>GR127935>ketanserin>ritanserin>mesulergine congruent with SB206553>metergoline>methiothepin>NAN190. Tropisetron did not produce any alteration of the discriminative control by INDO. These results suggest that the discriminative signal of INDO is mediated by 5-HT(1A/2C/1B) receptors and that blockade of any of its components produces a degradation of its discriminative effects.", 
    "115": "The study was designed to examine the effect of butorphanol, a classical opioid on convulsive behaviour using maximal electroshock (MES) test. An attempt was also made to investigate the role of possible receptor mechanisms involved. MES seizures were induced in mice via transauricular electrodes (60 mA, 0.2 s). Seizure severity was assessed by the duration of tonic hindlimb extensor phase and mortality due to convulsions. Intraperitoneal administration of butorphanol produced a dose-dependent (0.25-2 mg/kg) protection against hindlimb extensor phase. The anticonvulsant effect of butorphanol was antagonized by all the three opioid receptor antagonists (i.e., naloxone [mu], MR2266 [kappa], and naltrindole [delta], respectively). Coadministration of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic drugs (diazepam, GABA, muscimol, and baclofen) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, dizocilpine (MK801), with butorphanol augmented the anticonvulsant action of the latter drug. In contrast, flumazenil, a central benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor antagonist, reversed the facilitatory effect of diazepam on the anti-MES effect of butorphanol. Similarly, delta-aminovaleric acid (DAVA), a GABA(B) receptor antagonist, antagonized the facilitatory effect of baclofen, a GABA(B) agonist on anti-MES action of butorphanol. These BZD-GABAergic antagonists, flumazenil or DAVA, per se also counteracted the anti-MES effect of butorphanol given alone. These data exemplify the benefits of using the MES test, which is sensitive to opioidergic compounds and distinguished convulsive behavioural changes associated with GABAergic and NMDAergic effects. Taken together, the results implicate a role for multitude of neurotransmitter systems, i.e., opioid (mu, kappa, delta), NMDA channel, BZD-GABA(A) chloride channel complex, and GABA(B) receptors in the anti-MES action of butorphanol.",

Patients with the greatest baseline severity (CGI-S) had the greatest improvement. Fifteen of 25 (60%) patients responded. Time to consistent response was bimodal, with five early (by 0.5 +/- 0.3 weeks) and 10 late (by 7.0 +/- 1.9 weeks) responders.

    "124": "Typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, though both effective, act on different neurotransmitter receptors and are dissimilar in some clinical effects and side effects. The typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol has been shown to cause a decrease in the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays an important role in neuronal cell survival, differentiation, and neuronal connectivity. However, it is still unknown whether atypical antipsychotic drugs similarly regulate BDNF expression. We examined the effects of chronic (28 days) administration of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on BDNF mRNA expression in the rat hippocampus using in situ hybridization. Quantitative analysis revealed that the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol (1 mg/kg) down-regulated BDNF mRNA expression in both CA1 (P < 0.05) and dentate gyrus (P < 0.01) regions compared with vehicle control. In contrast, the atypical antipsychotic agents clozapine (10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (2.7 mg/kg) up-regulated BDNF mRNA expression in CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus regions of the rat hippocampus compared with their respective controls (P < 0.01). These findings demonstrate that the typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs differentially regulate BDNF mRNA expression in rat hippocampus.",

On day 11, shifted animals had access to a devalued incentive (4% sucrose) and subgroups of each group received doses of amisulpride (10 or 60 mg/kg, i.p.) or its vehicle before a 10-min access period to sucrose solutions. Lick frequency was measured both pre- and post-shift. A high dose of amisulpride reduced successive negative contrast (SNC) after a brief period of exposure to the devalued stimulus, whereas a low dose had no effect. The acute effects of high doses of amisulpride seem to act on contrast effects in a similar way to anxiolytic compounds such as the benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide.",

While alcohol (0.80 g/kg) and triazolam (0.25 mg/70 kg) produced comparable levels of psychomotor performance impairment, a dissociation was observed, such that the magnitude of memory impairment (measured by d', participants' sensitivity in discriminating between old and new words in the recognition memory paradigm) was greater with triazolam than with alcohol, whereas subjective ratings of the overall strength of drug effect were higher with alcohol than with triazolam. Participants also adopted a more conservative response bias in the recognition memory paradigm in the alcohol (0.80 g/kg) condition relative to both placebo and triazolam (0.25 mg/70 kg). In addition to characterizing the adverse effects of two widely used psychoactive substances, the present results may also contribute to the understanding of underlying neurochemical mechanisms.", 
    "127": "Hyperforin, the main antidepressant component of Hypericum extract, is not stable with regard to heat and light. Therefore, we investigated a newly synthetized derivative, hyperforin acetate. Herein we demonstrate its efficacy in animal models sensitive to antidepressant and anxiolytic drugs. In the forced swimming test, triple administration of hyperforin (5-20 mg/kg) significantly reduced the immobility time of rats, while in the learned helplessness test a daily treatment of 10 mg/kg for seven consecutive days was necessary to elicit an antidepressant effect. In the elevated plus-maze and in the light-dark test, the acute administration of hyperforin acetate (3-5 mg/kg) exerted an anxiolytic activity, which, however, was smaller than that of diazepam. The effect was inhibited by the pretreatment of rats with metergoline, a serotoninergic antagonist, but not with CGS-8216, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Hyperforin acetate (3-10 mg/kg) was also able to reduce locomotion in rats without eliciting myorelaxant activity. As Hypericum extract was claimed to exert a potential influence on the liver drug metabolizing system, we showed that neither acute nor repeated oral doses of hyperforin acetate altered pentobarbital sleeping time in rats. Taken together, the present results show that hyperforin acetate is a pharmacologically active derivative of hyperforin and may be a starting point from which to develop new compounds for therapeutic purposes.",

We did not found common anaesthesia methodics that can fullfil that requirements, so we decided to prepare new common anaesthesia methodics, which could fullfil requirements mentioned above. We choose medicaments according to their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics action. For methodics optimization we've used 2 groups of dogs (mongrel dogs males weight 7-15 kg) (n = 10). We've applied different anaesthesia schemas on each group. Premedication in the I-st group was performed with intramuscle (i.m.) combination of diazepam, ketamine and phentanyl and for anaesthesia continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion of thiopental and ketamine. In II-nd group premedication was performed with i.m. injection of ketamine/phentanyl combination and for anaesthesia--continuous i.v. infusion of thiopental.

Rf values for drugs: aminazine 0.23-0.25; barbamylum 0.85-0.9; nitrazepam 0.75-0.8. 2. Diethyl ether: NH3 (25%): benzenum--80:10:10. Rf values for drugs: aminazine 0.55-0.58; barbamylum 0.32-0.35; nitrazepam 0.17-0.2.", 
    "145": "A recent case report suggested that olanzapine resulted in improved weight gain and maintenance, as well as decreased anxiety and agitation, for two hospitalized inpatients with anorexia nervosa (AN). However, a subsequent larger case study did not show a relationship between the use of olanzapine and rate of weight gain among a primarily adult population. The aim of this case report was to clinically examine the therapeutic benefit and tolerability of olanzapine as an adjunctive treatment for four children with AN in a pediatric inpatient setting.", 
    "146": "Olanzapine use was associated with considerable weight gain and maintenance, with an average rate of weight gain during hospitalization of 0.99 kg per week. In addition to weight gain, olanzapine was associated with a clinically notable decrease in levels of agitation and premeal anxiety and almost immediate improvement in sleep, general functioning, and overall compliance with treatment. Olanzapine was also well tolerated in these young patients.", 
    "147": "These case report findings warrant more controlled research, including randomized controlled studies, to better determine the therapeutic benefits and safety of olanzapine use in children with AN.",

    "149": "The effects of a small molecule selective CRF(1) antagonist DMP696 on anxiety-like behaviors and stress-induced increases in corticosterone in rats exposed to a novel environment and on locomotor activity and motor coordination were determined in rats. These effects of DMP696 were compared with those produced by the classical benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide (CDP).", 
    "150": "DMP696 or CDP were administered PO, 60 minutes before behavioral testing in rats. Their effects on latency to exit a dark chamber and stress-induced increase in corticosterone in the Defensive Withdrawal test (an animal model of anxiety), locomotor activity, and rotorod performance (measure of ataxia) were determined.", 
    "151": "DMP696 significantly reduced exit latency and reversed the stress-induced increase in corticosterone in the Defensive Withdrawal test at doses of 3.0-10 mg/kg and higher. In contrast, CDP significantly decreased exit latency at 10 and 30 mg/kg, but not at 100 mg/kg, due to concurrent non-specific side effects. Unlike DMP696, CDP had no effect on the stress-induced increase in corticosterone at lower doses, but resulted in a significant increase at higher doses. DMP696 did not reduce locomotor activity or impair motor coordination at doses up to 30-fold higher than doses effective in the Defensive Withdrawal model. In contrast, CDP produced significant sedation and ataxia at the same doses that were effective in reducing exit latency.",

Each session consisted of ten pairings of the light in a distinctive chamber (CS) with the electrical stimulation of this structure at the escape threshold. On the next day, each animal was exposed only to the CS (testing) and the duration of freezing, number of rearing and grooming episodes were recorded for 5 min. Before and after the testing session, animals were submitted to the tail-flick test. Fifteen minutes before the exposure to the CS, animals received injections into the dPAG of midazolam (a positive modulator of benzodiazepine sites), alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (alpha-Me-5-HT; an agonist of 5-HT(2) receptors), naltrexone (an opioid antagonist), or vehicle.", 
    "156": "Conditioning with dPAG electrical stimulation caused significant increases in the time of freezing and conditioned antinociception. Injections of midazolam into the dPAG significantly inhibited freezing behavior and antinociception due to conditioning. Injections of alpha-Me-5-HT inhibited the effects of conditioning on freezing without affecting conditioned antinociception. Injections of naltrexone (13 nmol/0.2 micro l) did not change any of the conditioned responses studied.", 
    "157": "(1) Conditioned freezing and antinociception are modulated by benzodiazepine mechanisms into dPAG. (2) 5-HT(2) receptors seem to regulate conditioned freezing behavior. However, conditioned antinociception was not affected by 13 nmol naltrexone. (3) Opioid mechanisms do not seem to be involved in the conditioned responses using electrical stimulation of the dPAG as unconditioned stimulus. Further studies with other opioid and 5-HT(2) receptor antagonists are still needed to confirm the conclusions drawn from the present work.",

We used a previously developed paradigm to examine whether lorazepam affects visual processes involved in the coding of contour information or conceptual/lexical representations.", 
    "159": "Three groups were tested (lorazepam, diazepam and placebo). In the study phase, participants named line drawings, presented for 500 ms, in which 50% of the contour was deleted by removing every other line and vertex from each part. In the test phase, participants saw the identical picture, its complement (the other 50% of the contour), or a samename/different-shape picture, each presented for 200 ms.", 
    "160": "For all three groups, the magnitude of priming, as assessed by naming RTs and error rates, was equivalent in the identical and in the complementary conditions and the amount of facilitation was reduced in the same-name condition. Perceptual priming occurred both in the lorazepam and in the diazepam groups, though reduced, compared to placebo, for RTs. No conceptual priming (i.e. facilitated performance in the same-name condition) was observed in the benzodiazepine groups.", 
    "161": "Equivalent priming for identical and complementary pictures in the three groups suggests that benzodiazepines do not affect the activation of the geon structural description. The lack of priming for same-name pictures suggests that benzodiazepines affect access, retrieval or selection of conceptual/lexical information.",

Different factors such as ammonia, inflammatory cytokines, benzodiazepines and electrolyte imbalances may precipitate or aggravate glia edema, thereby explaining precipitation of HE episodes by a variety of unrelated factors. Recognition and rigorous treatment of these precipitating factors is the most important measure in HE therapy which may be augmented by dietary and medical approaches. Among these approaches, evidence for proven therapeutical efficacy in HE on the basis of placebo-controlled trials is existing only for transplantation, protein restriction, administration of vegetable proteins, ornithine-aspartate, oral branched-chain amino acid treatment as well as lactulose enemas. The efficacy of oral lactulose has not been demonstrated on the basis of placebo-controlled trials.", 
    "168": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric syndrome during the course of acute or chronic liver disease. It is functional in nature, potentially reversible and precipitated by rather heterogeneous factors. At the neurophysiological level HE is characterized by a low frequent cortico-cortical electrical coupling, which may explain the cognitive deficits and a low frequent corticomuscular coupling, which may explain the fine motor deficits. Current evidence suggests that HE is the consequence of a low grade chronic glial edema with subsequent alterations of glioneuronal communication. Different factors, such as ammonia, benzodiazepines, inflammatory cytokines can induce or aggravate astrocyte swelling, which results in the activation of osmosignaling cascades, protein modifications, alterations in gene expression and neurotransmission. Among the protein modifications nitration of critical tyrosine residues in glial proteins may play an important role. Several proteins, which are nitrated in response to ammonia, benzodiazepines, hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling or inflammatory cytokines have been identified, including glutamine synthetase and the peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor.",

The reactions of the children during administration were noted. Anaesthesia was induced by facemask with incremental sevoflurane administration. All children received alfentanil (15 micro g x kg(-1)). Tracheal intubation was facilitated by mivacurium (0.2 mg x kg(-1)). Anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and an additional dose of alfentanil, if necessary. During recovery, the time interval between discontinuation of anaesthesia and arousal (spontaneous ventilation, extubation) were recorded.",

Average sedation and anxiolysis increased with time, achieving a maximum at 20 min in group I and at 30 min in groups II-IV. Patient mask acceptance was good for more than 75% of the children. Although the intranasal route provides a faster effect, it causes significant nasal irritation. Seventy-seven percent of the children from this group cried after drug administration. Most parents in all groups (67-73%) were satisfied with the premedication.",

    "181": "Many fundamental advances in our understanding of basic neural function have been made using bird song learning and performance as a model system. These advances have included a greater understanding of higher-order neural processing, developmental and hormonal influences on behavior, and the realization that neurogenesis plays an important role in normal adult brain function. The great diversity of passerine birds and song-related behaviors they exhibit suggest that oscine songbirds are ideally suited for comparative studies. While the comparative approach has been used successfully in the past to study song-related phenomena at anatomical and behavioral levels, it has been underutilized in addressing questions at the neurophysiological level. Most neurophysiological studies of songbird auditory and motor processing have been performed in one species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). We present and compare neurophysiological studies we have performed in zebra finches and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia), species that differ markedly in their singing behavior and song repertoire characteristics. Interspecific similarities, and striking differences, in song neural processing are apparent. While preliminary, these data suggest that comparative neurophysiological studies of species carefully chosen for their vocal repertoire and singing behavior will contribute significantly to our understanding of vertebrate sensory and motor neural processing.", 
    "182": "Mice lacking ClC-3 chloride channels, encoded by the Clcn3 gene, undergo neurodegeneration of the hippocampal formation and retina [Neuron, 29 (2001) 185-196; Genes Cells, 7 (2002) 597-605]. We independently created a mouse lacking the Clcn3 gene which demonstrated similar central nervous system abnormalities, including early postnatal degeneration of retinal photoreceptors. However, we observed a characteristic spatial-temporal sequence of hippocampal neurodegeneration that differs from the pattern previously reported. Anterior-to-posterior degeneration and astrogliosis of the dentate gyrus and hippocampus progressed over months. Sequential loss of hippocampal neuronal subpopulations began in the dentate gyrus and progressed to CA3, followed by CA1 neurons. Projection neurons of the entorhinal cortex degenerated, secondary to the loss of their synaptic targets within the hippocampal formation. Other characteristics of the Clcn3(-/-) mice included an abnormal gait, kyphosis, and absence of hindlimb escape extension upon tail elevation. Spontaneous seizures were observed in four adult Clcn3(-/-) mice, and one mouse died during the event. We hypothesized that neuronal injury may be related to recurrent seizures. Clcn3(-/-) mice had normal serum electrolytes and pH, and exhibited neither hyperglycemia nor rebound hypoglycemia following a glucose load. They displayed a greatly reduced susceptibility to pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures and an abnormally prolonged sedation to benzodiazepines. There was no change in vulnerability to kainic acid-induced seizures. Immunostaining revealed a progressive loss of GABA synthesizing cells in the dentate gyrus. The death of these cells was preceded by increased GABA(A) receptor immunoreactivity. These data suggest that GABA(A) inhibitory neurotransmission is altered in Clcn3(-/-) mice. The increase in GABA(A) receptor density may represent a compensatory response either to chronic excessive excitatory stimuli or reduced inhibitory input from local GABAergic interneurons within the dentate gyrus.",

    "184": "Ninety-six adults 18 years or older with acute repetitive seizures, 70 of whom received treatment, were randomized into the 2 studies. Active and placebo medications were supplied in prefilled, identical-appearing delivery systems. In study 001, patients received a second dose 4 hours after the initial treatment. Patients in study 003 received only 1 treatment. Patients were observed for 12 hours after the first dose.",

The median number of seizures per hour in the group treated with DZP rectal gel was 0.00, vs 0.13 in the placebo group (P =.002). In addition, significantly more DZP rectal gel-treated patients remained seizure-free during the 12-hour observation period (71% [22/31] vs 28% [11/39]). Using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis, time to the next seizure was found to be significantly longer in DZP rectal gel-treated than placebo-treated patients (P<.001). Global assessment as provided by the caregivers was in favor of DZP rectal gel for both study 001 (P =.17) and study 003 (P =.02).

    "187": "The GABA(A) receptor system is implicated in a number of neurological and psychiatric diseases, making GABA(A) receptor ligands interesting as potential therapeutic agents. Only a few different classes of structures are currently known as ligands for the GABA recognition site on the hetero-pentameric GABA(A) receptor complex, reflecting the very strict structural requirements for GABA(A) receptor recognition and activation. Within the series of compounds showing agonist activity at the GABA(A) receptor site that have been developed, most of the ligands are structurally derived from the GABA(A) agonists muscimol, THIP, or isoguvacine, which we developed in the initial stages of the project. Using recombinant GABA(A) receptors, functional selectivity was demonstrated for a number of compounds, including THIP, showing highly subunit-dependent potency and maximal response. In light of the interest in partial GABA(A) receptor agonists as potential therapeutics, structure-activity studies of a number of analogs of 4-PIOL, a low-efficacy partial GABA(A) agonist derived from THIP, have been performed. In this connection, a series of GABA(A) ligands has been developed that exhibit pharmacological profiles from moderately potent low-efficacy partial GABA(A) agonist activity to potent and selective antagonist effects. Very little information is available on direct-acting GABA(A) receptor agonists in clinical studies. However, the results of clinical studies on the effect of the partial GABA(A) agonist THIP on human sleep patterns show that the functional consequences of a direct-acting agonist are different from those seen after the administration of GABA(A) receptor modulators, such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates.",

The clinical management of this challenging presentation is discussed, including both the anesthetic and psychiatric approaches.", 
    "189": "In this report two cases of localised tetanus in two young (<1 year) intact male and outdoor DSH cats, which had been missing, are described. Clinical examination revealed severe muscular spasms on the right (case 1) or both thoracic limbs (case 2). In the latter cat, wrinkling of the forehead and mild trismus were also seen. The routine diagnostic workup (CBC, survey radiographs of the spine, CSF analysis) did not reveal any abnormalities in both cats. EMG testing on the affected muscles in the second animal showed persistent spontaneous motor unit potentials, strongly indicating tetanus. The treatment, that was symptomatic (diazepam, metronidazole) and supportive (physical therapy, assist feeding and intravenous fluid therapy) resulted in the progressive improvement of limb rigidity and the restoration of motor dysfunction in a period of 5- (case 1) and 2- (case 2) month duration.", 
    "190": "Behavioral evidence suggests that muscarinic/cholinergic inhibition of brain dopaminergic activity may be a useful principle for developing novel antipsychotic drugs (APDs). Thus, oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist, attenuates amphetamine-induced locomotor activity in rodents, an effect also produced by a wide variety of proven APDs, whereas scopolamine, a muscarinic antagonist, has the opposite effect. Since atypical APDs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, ziprasidone and quetiapine, increase brain acetylcholine as well as dopamine (DA) release in a region-specific manner, their effects on cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission may also contribute to various actions of these drugs. Oxotremorine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) dose-dependently and preferentially increased DA release in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), compared to the nucleus accumbens (NAC). However, S-(-)-scopolamine (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) produced similar increases in DA release in the mPFC, but the effect was much less than that of oxotremorine. Whereas a dose of S-(-)-scopolamine of 0.5 mg/kg comparably increased DA release in the mPFC and NAC, 1.5 mg/kg had no effect on DA release in the NAC. Oxotremorine-M (0.5 mg/kg), a M(1/4)-preferring agonist, also increased DA release in the mPFC, but not the NAC, an effect completely abolished by telenzepine (3 mg/kg), a M(1/4)-preferring antagonist, which by itself had no effect on DA release in either region. Oxotremorine (0.5, but not 1.5, mg/kg) attenuated amphetamine (1 mg/kg)-induced DA release in the NAC, whereas S-(-)-scopolamine did not. Oxotremorine (1.5 mg/kg) and S-(-)-scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg) modestly but significantly potentiated amphetamine (1 mg/kg)-induced DA release in the mPFC. These results suggest that stimulation of muscarinic receptors, in particular M(1/4), as indicated by the effect of oxotremorine-M and telenzepine, may preferentially increase cortical DA release and inhibit amphetamine-induced DA release in the NAC."
