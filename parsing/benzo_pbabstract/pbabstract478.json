    "0": "The authors reviewed pharmacologic treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), particularly treatment with benzodiazepine agents, and compared the antianxiety effects and dependence risks of these agents with those of nonGABAergic compounds such as buspirone--a new psychotropic drug--in the treatment of chronic anxiety. Forty outpatients who met DSM-III criteria for GAD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with buspirone or lorazepam. After 8 weeks, treatment was abruptly stopped and withdrawal reactions were evaluated at Weeks 9 and 10. After 3 to 4 weeks, buspirone's efficacy in treating GAD symptomatology was found to be comparable with lorazepam's, except for sleep disturbances, which were minimally affected by buspirone. After treatment was discontinued, buspirone-treated patients were free from withdrawal symptoms, while the symptoms of lorazepam-treated patients worsened at Week 9.", 
    "1": "In a prospective open trial conducted on a general psychiatric ward, the authors diagnosed catatonic syndrome 15 times in 12 patients over a 1-year period. These 12 patients represented 9% of all admissions. The following signs were present in two thirds or more of the episodes studied: immobility (100%), staring (92%), mutism (85%), withdrawal/refusal to eat (78%), posturing/grimacing (73%), and rigidity (66%). Other signs of catatonia were seen less frequently. Lorazepam 1 to 2 mg was administered in every case, and patients were evaluated at hourly intervals. Of the 15 episodes, 12 responded completely and dramatically to lorazepam treatment within 2 hours, 1 responded partially, and 2 had no response. Adverse effects were infrequent. A CNS abnormality or dysfunction was evident in 8 of the 12 responders, suggesting that a beneficial response to lorazepam is not limited to patients with pure psychogenic catatonia. The prompt recognition and treatment of catatonia may reduce morbidity in and length of stay for hospitalized psychiatric patients.", 
    "2": "Neurodegenerative diseases may result from excessive stimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors by endogenous ligands. Because neuronal degeneration is associated with glial proliferation and hypertrophy, the degenerative changes throughout rat brain following the systemic administration of kainic acid (12 mg/kg) were mapped with quantitative autoradiography of [3H]PK 11195. This radioligand binds to a mitochondrial benzodiazepine binding site (MBBS) on microglia and astrocytes. Analysis of eight horizontal and four coronal brain levels revealed up to 16-fold increases in [3H]PK 11195 binding from 1 to 5 weeks but not 1 day after kainate injection. Increases in [3H]PK 11195 binding were predominantly in ventral limbic brain regions and olfactory projections to neocortical areas, with the olfactory cortex greater than subiculum/CA1 greater than anterior olfactory nucleus, medial thalamic nucleus, and piriform cortex greater than cingulate cortex and rostral hippocampus greater than dentate gyrus, septum, and amygdala greater than entorhinal cortex and temporal cortex. Little or no enhancement of [3H]PK 11195 binding was observed in numerous regions including the caudate-putamen, substantia nigra, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle, cerebellum, thalamic nuclei, choroid plexus, medulla, parietal or occipital cortex, or pons. A 2-fold greater extent of neurodegeneration was obtained in ventral portions of the olfactory bulb, entorhinal cortex, temporal cortex, and dentate gyrus compared with the dorsal portions of these structures. The pattern of increase in [3H]PK 11195 binding closely matched the patterns of neuronal degeneration reported following parenteral kainate injection. These findings strengthen the notion that quantitative autoradiography of [3H]PK 11195 is a valuable tool to quantify the extent of neuronal degeneration. Furthermore, the quantitative changes in [3H]PK 11195 binding in different limbic structures parallel their relative variation in neuropathology observed in Alzheimer's disease but not Huntington's chorea. These findings are in agreement with the idea that excessive stimulation of excitatory amino receptors may contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "3": "A 44-year-old man was admitted with acute abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea and dry retching, with tenderness and rigidity of the abdominal wall. Exploratory laparotomy revealed generalized peritonitis. He developed delerium tremens soon after operation and dehiscence of the abdominal wound 36 hours postoperatively. When the wound was closed and reinforced his recovery was uneventful. This case was unusual because he did not have ascites or cirrhosis, which are commonly associated with the disease.", 
    "4": "The effect of MK-329, a potent, orally active, nonpeptidal cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist, was measured on the gastric emptying rate of a solid meal in cats. External scintigraphy of cats that had been fed a meal of technetium-99m-(99mTc) labeled rabbit liver and light cream allowed the measurement of the emptying rates of either the liquid or solid portion of a meal under physiologic conditions. In cats, liquids emptied 2.6 times faster than solids [163 +/- 11 min vs. 62 +/- 3 min (mean +/- s.e.)]. At 3 or 10 mg/kg p.o., MK-329 gastric emptying was significantly accelerated, with the mean half-time of emptying being decreased by 34 +/- 11% (mean +/- s.e.) of the control half-times (p less than 0.02). Using only responders (five of six animals), mean half-time was decreased by 55 +/- 4% of the control half-times. CCK is important in regulating the emptying of solid food from the stomach because the CCK antagonist MK-329 accelerates that emptying.", 
    "5": "Preschool age children often experience marked anxiety and physical pain during laceration repair. Locally infiltrated anesthetics or topical tetracaine, adrenaline, and cocaine (TAC) usually control the physical pain but have little or no effect on anxiety. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic, hypnotic, and antegrade amnestic effects. In a double-blind, randomized clinical trial, we evaluated the efficacy of midazolam in alleviating anxiety during laceration repair in children less than 6 years old. On admission to the emergency department, anxiety level was determined on a scale of 1 to 4 based on a predetermined behavior criteria. Patients with high anxiety level (3 or 4) received a single oral dose of either midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) or placebo. The anxiolytic effect of midazolam was considered adequate if the anxiety level decreased two or more points (from 4 to less than or equal to 2 or from 3 to 1) during laceration repair. In the midazolam group (30), 70% of the children had a two-point or more decrease in anxiety level compared with 12% in the placebo group (25) (P less than .0001). No respiratory depression or other complications were noted in the midazolam group. We conclude that a single oral dose of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) is a safe and effective treatment for alleviating anxiety in children less than 6 years old during laceration repair in the ED.", 
    "6": "An application of the neural network to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis has been studied. The new method was compared with the linear multiregression analysis in various ways. It was found that the neural network can be a potential tool in the routine work of QSAR analysis. The mathematical relationship of operation between the neural network and the multiregression analysis was described. It was shown that the neural network can exceed the level of the linear multiregression analysis.", 
    "7": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of intermittent oral administration of diazepam during hyperthermia for reducing the recurrence of febrile seizure: 185 children, between 8 months and 3 years of age, with a first febrile seizure and normal neurologic development, were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to receive orally administered diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, then 0.20 mg/kg, every 12 hours) or placebo, whenever the rectal temperature was more than 38 degrees C. The main criterion of efficacy was the seizure recurrence rate 1 year after the first seizure. The duration of the study was 3 years; eight different centers in France participated. There were 462 febrile episodes and 1000 days with prophylactic treatment. The recurrence rates did not differ between the diazepam group (16%) and the placebo (19.5%) group. The children with recurrent seizures were significantly younger at the time of the first seizure (17 +/- 6.9 months) than children without a recurrent seizure (21 +/- 8.5 months). In children with recurrent seizures, prophylactic treatment was correctly administered to only 1 of 15 children in the diazepam group and to 7 of 18 children in the placebo group. The following were the reasons for this poor cooperation: convulsion being the first manifestation of the fever (seven cases in each group), parents neglecting to give treatment (nine cases), and refusal to take treatment by two children. Side effects were similar in the two groups except for hyperactivity, which was more frequent in the diazepam (138 days) than in the placebo (34 days) group. Intermittent oral administration of diazepam at the onset of fever offered no advantage over placebo in preventing recurrence of seizure. This finding probably reflects a lack of efficacy of the intermittent method rather than of diazepam itself.", 
    "8": "The ability of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists to interact with CCK receptors in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells was investigated. L-365,260, CCK-8, L-364,718, CBZ-CCK(27-32)-NH2 and proglumide analogue 10 inhibited specific 125I-CCK-8 binding to SCLC cells with IC50 values of 0.2, 2, 500, 100,000 and 500,000 nM, respectively. Gastrin-I and CCK-8 elevated the cytosolic Ca2+ when SCLC cells were loaded with Fura 2-AM. L-365,260 inhibited the cytosolic Ca2+ increase caused by 10 nM CCK-8 in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of 10 nM L-365,260 were reversed by high concentrations of CCK-8. These data indicate that L-365,260 functions as a reversible CCK-8 antagonist using SCLC cells.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepine receptors and subtypes were examined in El mice and normal ddY mice with a quantitative autoradiographic technique. Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding in stimulated El mice, which had experienced repeated convulsions, was significantly lower in the cortex and hippocampus than in ddY mice and unstimulated El mice. In the amygdala, specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding in stimulated El mice was lower than in ddY mice. There was a tendency for the [3H]flunitrazepam binding in these regions in unstimulated El mice to be intermediate between that in stimulated El mice and that in ddY mice, but there was no significant difference between unstimulated El mice and ddY mice. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding displaced by CL218,872 was significantly lower in the cortex of stimulated El mice than in that of the other two groups, and in the hippocampus of stimulated than of unstimulated El mice. These data suggest that the decrease in [3H]flunitrazepam binding in stimulated El mice may be due mainly to that of type 1 receptor and may be the result of repeated convulsions.", 
    "10": "Animal seizure models, in vitro preparations of cell cultures and tissue slices, and an unravelling of some of the basic mechanisms underlying epileptogenesis and epilepsy have furthered the understanding of mechanisms of action of antiepileptic drugs at the cellular and subcellular levels. Nevertheless, the mechanism of action of most antiepileptic drugs in clinical use is incompletely understood. Multiple physiologic mechanisms are altered by antiepileptic drugs. Some of these drugs, such as phenytoin and carbamazepine, decrease sustained repetitive firing and post-tetanic potentiation through their blocking effects on the sodium channel. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates enhance GABA-mediated inhibition. Many antiepileptic drugs inhibit calcium influx and calcium-mediated secondary effects at supratherapeutic concentrations. Newer drugs that inhibit excitatory receptors or enhance various forms of inhibition are presently under investigation.", 
    "11": "In rats, amygdala benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity decreases by 29% immediately after the animals step down from the platform of an inhibitory avoidance apparatus and decreases by a further 45% immediately after they receive a training footshock. The decrease is attributable to a release of diazepam or diazepam-like molecules. The immediate post-training intraamygdala injection of the central benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (10 nmole/amygdala) causes memory facilitation, and that of the GABA-A agonist muscimol (0.005 to 0.5 nmole) causes retrograde amnesia. Pretraining ip flumazenil administration (2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg) attenuates the effect of post-training muscimol by a factor of at least 100. The higher dose of pretraining flumazenil also causes memory facilitation. The data suggest that post-training consolidation is down-regulated by a GABA-A mechanism in the amygdala modulated by endogenous benzodiazepines released during training and at the time of consolidation.", 
    "12": "The anesthetic effects of morphine-diazepam and fentanyl-diazepam combinations as characterized by abolition of the movement response to noxious stimulation were studied in rats to test the hypothesis of antagonistic interactions between the components of these combinations. Noxious pressure on the tail was used to induce the response. Dose-effect curves were constructed for the drugs given alone and in combination. With the use of probit procedure ED50 values for single drugs and their combinations were determined, and the interactions were analyzed with algebraic (fractional) and isobolographic methods. It was found that both morphine and fentanyl have a less than additive (antagonistic) interaction with diazepam. In combination the sum of fractional doses was higher than a single-drug fractional dose, 1.67 versus 1.00 (P less than 0.05) for morphine-diazepam and 1.61 versus 1.00 (P less than 0.05) for fentanyl-diazepam. The observed antagonism is a relative one that does not increase the requirement for one agent upon the addition of another agent.", 
    "13": "The synthesis, ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam binding from bovine brain membranes, and GABA ratio of some [1]benzopyranopyrroles 1a-i and [1]benzopyrano-1,2,3-triazoles 2a,b are reported. The GABA ratios of some previously synthesized pyrazoloquinolines A and [1]benzopyranopyrazoles C are also presented in order to draw some structure-activity relationships among our benzodiazepine receptor ligands. 1,3-Diarylpyrrole derivatives 1a-h show similar affinity and efficacy to that of diazepam, while the 1-aryltriazoles 2a,b have no receptor affinity. Comparison of the latter results with those on previously reported compounds suggests that there are several hydrophobic regions on the benzodiazepine recognition site whose occupation gives rise to different affinity and efficacy.", 
    "14": "A series of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 10-, and 12-substituted pyridodiindoles were synthesized and screened in vitro against [3H]diazepam for activity at the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR). In vitro, the 2-substituted pyridodiindoles were found to be the most potent (IC50 less than 10 nM) of this new class of BzR ligands. In vivo, 2-methoxypyridodiindole 19a (IC50 = 8 nM) was found to be the most potent partial inverse agonist (proconvulsant) of the series. The parent compound 2 (IC50 = 4 nM) was only slightly less potent. In addition, 2-hydroxypyridodiindole 21a (IC50 = 6 nM) was found to exhibit potent proconvulsant activity when administered as a prodrug derivative, pivaloyl ester 22. 2-Chloropyridodiindole 16a (IC50 = 10 nM) was devoid of preconvulsant activity; however, 16a was found to be the most potent antagonist of the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam in this class of BzR ligands. From the in vivo data available, substitution on ring E of 2 with electron-withdrawing groups results in antagonists at BzR, while replacement of hydrogen at C-2 with electron-releasing groups provides enhanced inverse agonist activity. The pyridodiindoles were used as \"templates\" for the formulation of a model of the inverse agonist/antagonist active site of the BzR. The proposed model consists of a hydrogen bond acceptor site (A1) and a hydrogen bond donor site (D2) disposed 6.0-8.5 A from each other on the receptor protein. The hydrogen-bonding sites are believed to be located at the base of a narrow cleft. A large lipophilic pocket at the mouth of the narrow cleft serves to direct molecules into the binding site, while the presence of a small lipophilic pocket permits substitution only at position 2 of the pyridodiindole nucleus for maximum binding potency.", 
    "15": "The structural requirements for ligand binding to the benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) inverse agonist site were probed through the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of 3-substituted beta-carbolines 6, 7, 11, 12, gamma-carboline 13, and diindoles 18-21, 23-25, 27, 28, and 34. On the basis of the apparent binding affinities of these and other analogues, a hydrogen bond acceptor site (A2) on the receptor is proposed to interact with the N(9) hydrogen atom of the beta-carbolines or the N(7) hydrogen nuclei of the diindoles. Likewise, a proposed hydrogen bond donating site (H1) interacts with the N(2) nitrogen atom of the beta-carbolines or the N(5) nitrogen atom of the diindoles. It appears that interaction with both sites is a prerequisite for high affinity since analogues which have either one or both of these positions blocked exhibit substantial reduction in affinity. Moreover, H1 appears to be capable of engaging in a three-centered hydrogen bond with appropriately functionalized ligands, which explains the increase in potency observed in the following series of 3-substituted beta-carbolines: the n-butyl (12, IC50 = 245 nM), n-propoxy (9, IC50 = 11 nM), and propyl ketone (11, IC50 = 2.8 nM) congeners. In addition to H1 and A2, there appears to be a relatively narrow hydrophobic pocket in the binding cleft that can accommodate substituents at the 3-position of the beta-carbolines which have chain lengths less than or equal to C5. There is a 1 order of magnitude decrease in affinity between n-propoxy analogue 9 (IC50 = 11 nM, chain length = 4) and n-butoxy derivative 7 (IC50 = 98 nM, chain length = 5). Furthermore, alpha- and gamma-branching [e.g. ethoxycarbonyl (2), IC50 = 5 nM and tert-butoxycarbonyl (31) IC50 = 10 nM] but not beta- and delta-branching [e.g. isopropoxy (6), IC50 = 500 nM and (neopentyloxy) carbonyl (48), IC50 = 750 nM] at position 3 are tolerated. Occupation of this hydrophobic pocket is clearly important for high affinity as evidenced by the relatively low affinity of 30, a beta-carboline which possesses a hydrogen atom at the 3-position. This same hydrophobic pocket is partially filled by the D and E rings of the diindoles, which accounts for the high affinity of several members of this series. An excluded volume analysis using selected 3-substituted beta-carbolines and ring-E substituted pyridodiindoles is consistent with the presence of this hydrophobic pocket (see Figure 1).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "16": "To examine the relationship between PKBS, a 17-kD protein covalently photolabeled by [3H]PK 14105, and its association with peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites, rat adrenal mitochondrial fractions were photolabeled with [3H]PK 14105, solubilized in digitonin, and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography over Q-Sepharose. The chromatographic behavior of PKBS was evident as principally two major fractions, signified as Q-I and Q-II. Specific binding sites for [3H]Ro5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 were also assayed and found to cofractionate with each other and in a manner which coincided with the photolabeled PKBS profile. The Q-I and Q-II fractions were further distinguished based on their different molecular sizes observed by gel filtration, yet both fractions were characterized as containing peripheral-type benzodiazepine recognition sites according to the following criteria. Scatchard analysis of both subpopulations revealed a single class of binding sites for [3H]Ro5-4864 with an apparent KD of 14 nM for Q-I and 22 nM for Q-II; these affinities were slightly lower than those found in mitochondrial membrane preparations used as the starting material for solubilization. The rank order of potency to inhibit [3H]Ro5-4864 binding in both subpopulations was PK 11195 greater than Ro5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than clonazepam, in connection with the pharmacological specificity of membrane-associated peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites. These studies provide direct biochemical evidence that the recognition sites for benzodiazepines and isoquinoline carboxamides cofractionate in unison with the 17-kD PKBS protein, demonstrating an intimate relationship between this protein and the binding domains for peripheral-type benzodiazepine ligands.", 
    "17": "Oral lorazepam is a commonly used premedicant both locally and abroad. We studied its effect on recovery time after minor gynaecological procedures. The results showed a significant prolongation of recovery time.", 
    "18": "The prescriptions of all patients who attended an urban general practice from September 1987 to December 1987 were studied. Of the 111 patients (60 females and 51 males) who received a psychotropic prescription the commonest presenting complaint was insomnia (56 patients or 50.5%). This was followed by tension, headache and unexplained aches and pains (19 patients or 17.1%), and anxiety (nine patients or 8.1%). Consistent with these presentations a vast majority (92.8%) received a benzodiazepine. The commonest drugs prescribed were Lorazepam and Bromazepam whereas the longer acting benzodiazepines were rarely used. Polypharmacy was rare.", 
    "19": "Previous studies have demonstrated benzodiazepine-like effects of competitive and noncompetitive antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) type of excitatory amino acid receptor. The present experiment compared the effects of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide and the NMDA noncompetitive antagonist MK-801 upon the behavior of aggressive male mice in dyadic interactions using ethological analysis. OF-1 male mice housed with females were administered either chlordiazepoxide (Vehicle, 3.0, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg IP) or MK-801 (Vehicle, 0.1, 0.3 and 0.3 mg/kg, IP) in a randomised order thirty minutes prior to pairing with unfamiliar male opponents in an unfamiliar environment. It was found that both compounds tended to increase aggressiveness and social behavior and reduce ambivalent activity consistent with approach-avoidance conflict. The increases in aggressiveness and decreases in ambivalent activity were induced by MK-801 at doses lower than those resulting in gross motor effects. These data confirm that noncompetitive antagonists of NMDA may generate a benzodiazepine-like behavioral profile.", 
    "20": "There is now agreement about the clinical features of panic disorder and agoraphobia but less agreement about treatment because of controversy over whether the disorder is primarily biological or psychological. The authors were requested to produce an impartial review for continuing education and peer review. We chose to do this by using a quantitative review procedure, by providing a bibliography of studies, and by a literature review. We found that symptoms of panic and phobia did not change significantly while on wait-list control or while receiving placebo. The evidence for the efficacy of the low-potency benzodiazepines or of monoamine oxidase inhibitors was limited. It was also clear that only limited improvement can be expected from behavior therapies that do not involve exposure to the symptoms of panic or to the feared situation. Symptoms of panic, as well as the frequency of spontaneous panic, were shown to be substantially improved following imipramine, high-potency benzodiazepines such as alprazolam, exposure in vivo (especially if a cognitive anxiety management procedure was used), and the combination of imipramine and exposure in vivo. The effects on panic produced by the exposure therapies (with or without imipramine) were maintained over long follow-up periods. Imipramine, alprazolam, exposure therapy, and imipramine plus exposure each produced significant improvements in phobias. In the short term and in the long term, the larger improvements in phobias were associated with exposure therapy, particularly if used in combination with imipramine. We conclude that it would be unwise to theorize about the etiology of this disorder on the basis of response to a specific treatment because, both at the meta-analytic level and from the review of individual studies, it is clear that both drug and nondrug therapies can produce substantial and long-lasting changes in panic and in phobias.", 
    "21": "The change of variation in R-R interval on electrocardiograms (CVq) was examined in healthy subjects and patients with Graves' disease before and after an intravenous administration of 500 micrograms of Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). CVq was significantly elevated after TRH stimulation and returned to the control level within 120 min. This phenomenon was found not only in healthy subjects but also in patients with untreated Graves' disease whose levels of CVq were lower than in normal subjects. Pretreatment with atropine inhibited the response of CVq to TRH. These data suggest that TRH has a stimulatory effect on the parasympathetic nervous system, determined by the variations in R-R interval.", 
    "22": "Thirty patients aged 1-23 mth received either alfentanil or fentanyl for the induction and maintenance of IV sedation during cardiac catheterization following oral flunitrazepam premedication (0.1 mg.kg-1). Patients breathed spontaneously 30 per cent oxygen in air. Both alfentanil and fentanyl abolished all reaction to pain and discomfort with minimal haemodynamic and respiratory changes. Induction doses of alfentanil and fentanyl were 20 +/- 6 and 2.5 +/- 1.1 (mean +/- SD) micrograms.kg-1, respectively, and maintenance requirements 30 +/- 12 and 1.5 +/- 0.6 micrograms.kg-1.h-1, respectively. These requirements were comparable among younger and older as well as cyanotic and acyanotic patients. The IV sedation described adds an effective method to the armamentarium of an anaesthetist working in the cardiac laboratory.", 
    "23": "Benzodiazepines have been shown to competitively inhibit morphine glucuronidation in rat and human hepatic microsomes. Flunitrazepam exerted a potent competitive inhibition of rat hepatic morphine UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UDPGT) activity (Ki = 130 microM). It has no effect on the activity of p-nitrophenol, 17 beta-hydroxysteroid, 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid, or 4-hydroxybiphenyl UDPGTs. Because flunitrazepam is an effective photoaffinity label for benzodiazepine receptors, studied were performed in solubilized rat hepatic microsomes and with partially purified preparations of morphine UDPGT to determine the enhancement of flunitrazepam inhibition and binding to morphine UDPGT promoted by exposure to UV light. Under UV light, flunitrazepam inhibition was markedly enhanced. UV light exposure also led to a marked increase in binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to microsomal protein, which was protected substantially by preincubation with morphine. Testosterone, androsterone, and UDP-glucuronic acid did not protect against UV-enhanced flunitrazepam binding, and morphine did not reverse flunitrazepam binding once binding had occurred. As morphine UDPGT was purified, a good correlation was found between the increases in specific activity of morphine UDPGT and flunitrazepam binding to protein. Chromatofocusing chromatography showed that flunitrazepam bound only to fractions containing active morphine UDPGT, and no binding to 4-hydroxybiphenyl UDPGT was observed. Fluorography of a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel of solubilized hepatic microsomes that had been treated with [3H] flunitrazepam under UV light revealed a band with a monomeric molecular weight between 54,000 and 58,000. This monomeric molecular weight compares favorably with the reported monomeric molecular weight of homogeneous morphine UDPGT (56,000). These studies suggest that flunitrazepam binds rather selectively to the morphine binding site of morphine UDPGT and may prove to be a useful probe for this enzyme.", 
    "24": "We have studied analgesic and anticonvulsive effect of midazolam by means of tail-flick test and electroshock respectively. The drug was administered via cervical and lumbar intrathecally in chronically implanted rats. Total doses were 50, 125, and 250 microg. Control animals received 0.3125, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg intraperitoneally. Degree of sedation was also measured with a motor activity scale with the purpose of correlating sedation with analgesic and anticonvulsive effect. Tail-flick test was carried out 5 and 30 minutes after the administration of midazolam. Results showed that lumbar intrathecal midazolam has analgesic effect in tail-flick test whereas cervical intrathecal or intraperitoneal midazolam has no analgesic effect and shows a non significant hyperalgesic trend. Cervical intrathecal and intraperitoneal midazolam has anticonvulsive effect. As sedative effect of the administered doses increases, there was also a not significant trend to shorten latency period of tail-flick test and to increase anticonvulsive effect.", 
    "25": "Epileptic afterdischarges were induced by low frequency stimulation of the sensorimotor cortex in rats with implanted electrodes. Stimulations were repeated 4 times with 10 min intervals. Stimulation was always accompanied by clonic jerkings of the forepaws and frequently also by rearing and falling of the animals even in cases when no afterdischarge followed. Afterdischarges formed by a spike-and-wave rhythm prevailed, but a transition to spikes superimposed on delta waves (\"slow waves superimposed with spikes\") as well as a \"slow waves superimposed with spikes\" type since the very beginning of afterdischarges were recorded. Spike-and-wave afterdischarges were accompanied by the same motor pattern as stimulation, i.e., by minimal clonic seizures. During the \"slow waves superimposed with spikes\" type of afterdischarges, the rats sat motionless; wet dog shakes appeared towards the end. Mixed types of afterdischarges were accompanied by both motor patterns closely correlated to the actual EEG pattern. Clonazepam (0.02, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 5 min after the first afterdischarge. The second afterdischarge was shortened in a dose-dependent manner. The shortening was also observed in the third and fourth afterdischarge. Both pure afterdischarge types (spike-and-wave and \"slow waves superimposed with spikes\") could be induced after clonazepam, whereas a mixed type of afterdischarges was abolished. Motor pattern accompanying stimulation was attenuated but never abolished by clonazepam, whereas the same clonic seizures during spike-and-wave afterdischarges were blocked by the highest dose of clonazepam. Dissociation of EEG and motor epileptic phenomena suggests a preferential action of clonazepam on generalization of epileptic activity.", 
    "26": "The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of triazolam to chloral hydrate with hydroxyzine when sedating young children for dental treatment. Twenty children, age 21 to 74 months, with a mean age of 44 months, were given triazolam. Twenty children, age 23 to 64 months, with a mean age of 42 months, were given chloral hydrate with hydroxyzine. The children were given an elixir of either .02 mg/kg triazolam or 40 mg/kg chloral hydrate with 25 mg hydroxyzine. All subjects received 50% nitrous oxide and were restrained with a Papoose Board. The sedations were videotaped and evaluated by two pediatric dentists not involved in the study. They rated the success of the sedations by degree of sleep, crying, body movements, and overall behavior. Time until onset of action of the agents given, oxygen saturation of arterial blood, and heart rate were measured. The vital signs were consistent for the two groups. There was no statistical difference in the effectiveness of sedation between the two groups.", 
    "27": "Treatment of epilepsy in fertile-aged women raises questions of the effect of epileptic episodes on the outcome of the pregnancy, the interaction between antiepileptics and oral contraceptive (OCs), and the possible teratogenic effects of antiepileptic agents. Many antiepileptic agents are enzyme inductors, stimulating the activity of microsomal hepatic enzymes and consequently accelerating the degradation of combined OCs, diminishing their serum levels and their efficacy. Enzyme inductors include phenobarbital, hydantoins, carbamazepine, and primidone. Valproate sodium and the benzodiazepines are not enzyme inductors. Low-dose combined and phasic OCs should be avoided when enzyme inductors are used and a formulation with at least 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol or another method such as an IUD selected. If combined OCs are used, the appearance of metrorrhagia is a sign of insufficient hormonal blocking. During pregnancy, the frequency of epileptic crises is unchanged in about 1/2 of cases, increases in 1/4, and decreases in 1/4. The serum level on antiepileptic medications tends to decline during pregnancy and increase in the postpartum. The decline appears to be due to several factors: modification of binding to proteins, increased volume of distribution, and increases in metabolism of antiepileptics due to hormonal changes. Thus, in case of increased frequency of crises during pregnancy, the serum level of antiepileptic medications are associated with problems of hemostasis and increase the risk of neonatal hemorrhage. Coagulation problems can be prevented by administration of vitamin K to the mother at the end or pregnancy and to the newborn. Antiepileptic medications cross the placental barrier and can cause a withdrawal syndrome. The teratogenic risk of these drugs is very difficult to evaluate with assurance because of the many factors implicated in development of a malformation. All antiepileptics have a teratogenic risk, which increases with the number of drugs taken simultaneously. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and phyenytoin are basically responsible for facial and cardiovascular malformations, while valproate sodium is implicated in malformations of the nervous system. Malformations occur in the 1st 2 months of gestation. The teratogenic risk should be kept in mind, but there is also a risk to the fetus in repeated epileptic crises. Suppression of all treatment is often impossible, but limitation to 1 drug is desirable. Folic acid treatment should be prescribed 2-3 months before conception and during pregnancy. Surveillance is essentially sonographic, with amniocentesis if necessary.", 
    "28": "Domoic acid, an excitatory amino acid structurally related to kainic acid, has recently been identified as being responsible for the severe intoxication presented, in 1987, by more than 150 people having eaten mussels grown in Prince Edward Island. The present in vivo electrophysiological studies, using unitary extracellular recordings obtained from pyramidal neurons of the CA1 and of the CA3 regions of the rat dorsal hippocampus, were undertaken to study the effect of kainic acid and domoic acid applied by microiontophoresis and compare their potencies to that of agonists of the 2 other subtypes of glutamatergic receptors or neuropeptides. The activation induced by domoic acid and kainate was more than 20-fold more potent in the CA3 than in the CA1 region, whereas no such regional difference could be detected with all the other substances tested. In the CA1 as well as in the CA3 region, domoic acid was about 3 times more potent than kainate. A selective lesion of the mossy fibre system originating from the dentate gyrus and projecting to the CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus, drastically reduced the excitatory effect of kainic acid and domoic acid in this later area, without affecting the response to the other substances tested. Several class of pharmacological agents were studied in an attempt to find an antagonist of kainate and domoic acid. Only benzodiazepines could selectively suppress the neuronal activation induced by kainate, however, with a lower efficacy in the CA3 than in the CA1 region. These results demonstrate that domoic acid is a potent agonist of kainate receptors and that, in the CA3 region, it might produce its neurotoxic effects through activation of kainate receptors located on mossy fibre terminals. Finally, in the event of a new wave of intoxication, our results suggest that a rapid treatment with high doses of benzodiazepines could possibly prevent the important and irreversible hippocampal damage.", 
    "29": "Situational in vivo exposure has been widely used in the treatment of agoraphobia. However, only a low to moderate proportion of individuals treated with this approach have shown a high level of therapeutic gain. The recent recognition of panic as central to the development and maintenance of a great many cases of agoraphobic avoidance suggests that treatments focused directly on panic may contribute to a more comprehensive approach to agoraphobia. The present single case demonstrates that whereas two modes of situational exposure produced only limited improvement an approach focused directly on panic had greater effectiveness. The specific effects of the treatment components within the panic control package are analyzed in detail.", 
    "30": "Ipsapirone, a putative non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, was extensively metabolized in rats to 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)piperazine (1-PP) which accumulated in the brain. Neither the route of administration (i.p. or p.o.), nor prolonged administration of ipsapirone or 1-PP affected their accumulation in the rat brain. The cytochrome P450 level and ethylmorphine N-demethylase activity in rat liver microsomes were unchanged by chronic treatment with ipsapirone or 1-PP. The results indicate that 1-PP may contribute to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonism of ipsapirone in rats and that chronic treatment with the drug does not affect its biotransformation to 1-PP.", 
    "31": "The heterogenous psychoses in epilepsies, caused by well known conditions, are not rare but associated with regularly a few of seizure-types not with the nature and development of attacks. Polar transitional ranks and converging courses of schizophrenic (accentuated) syndromes in epilepsies and idiopathic schizophrenias are rather frequent. Also (sub-)acute schizophrenic psychoses are corresponding to the complete palette of first and second rank symptoms (K. Schneider) of idiopathic schizophrenias. After manifestations of epilepsy these syndromes can appear at any time. It is given a profile of risks.

Benzodiazepines are required mostly in prepsychotic syndromes, Lithium compounds in selected cases. There is no more alternative seizures or psychosis.", 
    "32": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method is described for simultaneous quantification of halazepam and its major active metabolite, nordiazepam, in plasma. The method uses a solid-phase extraction procedure to prepare plasma samples. After extraction, the methanolic extract is evaporated, and the residue is then reconstituted in a small volume of mobile phase (a 40:60, v/v, mixture of 0.02 M phosphate buffer, pH 4.0, and methanol) and chromatographed. The total chromatography time for a single sample is approximately 10 min. A sensitivity of 1 ng/mL for halazepam and nordiazepam is attained when 1 mL of plasma is extracted. Analytical recovery of halazepam and nordiazepam added to the plasma ranged from 89 to 96%. The maximum within-day and day-to-day coefficients of variation for each compound at the concentration range of 2 to 100 ng/mL were 8.7 and 10.3%, respectively. Suitability of the method was assessed in a preliminary pharmacokinetic study in which three subjects were given a single 20-mg oral dose of halazepam following an overnight fast. It appeared from our kinetic analysis that halazepam is a drug with a fairly rapid absorption phase that is followed by a slow elimination phase. Mean oral plasma clearance of halazepam was 24 L/h. The mean apparent elimination half-life of nordiazepam (45.22 h) is considerably longer than that of halazepam (21.15 h).", 
    "33": "The anxiolytic effect of diazepam (0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg), buspirone (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg), indorenate (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) and ipsapirone (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) was evaluated in male and female rats during the proestrus and metestrus phases. The burying behavior test was used to measure the anxiety levels. In this test, increases in the behavior latency are interpreted as prolonged reactivity, while reductions in the burying behavior are considered to reflect anxiolytic states. Diazepam increases in burying behavior latency were consistently higher than those observed after serotonergic anxiolytics. Buspirone, at no dose tested, affected the burying behavior latency, while indorenate and ipsapirone had only minor effects. Male individuals were more sensitive than females to the actions of diazepam on burying behavior. The serotonergic anxiolytics produce similar responses in both sexes. Metestrus females were much less sensitive to the action of all anxiolytics on burying behavior latency than proestrus females. Proestrus females were highly sensitive to the actions of diazepam on burying latency as compared both with males and metestrus females. Data show that a larger gender and within females variation occurs after treatment with diazepam as compared with the serotonergic anxiolytics. The results are discussed considering the relationships between ovarian hormones and the GABA-benzodiazepinic and serotonergic systems.", 
    "34": "Flumazenil, a specific antagonist of benzodiazepines, was administered to adult patients receiving treatment at ICU, and its utility to hasten recovery from sedation was evaluated in 40 patients and its usefulness for differential diagnosis of sedated conditions was also evaluated in 5 patients. The efficacy rate for recovery from sedation induced by benzodiazepines was 85.0%. Moreover, flumazenil was considered to be useful for differentiation of sedated conditions when causes were unknown. Depression of respiration improved in association with improvement of consciousness level. In some patients an elevation in blood pressure was also observed with improved consciousness.", 
    "35": "A review of the 2,256 admissions to a general hospital psychiatry unit between April 1982 and December 1987 showed that 129 (6%) had been treated with electro-convulsive therapy (ECT); 91% of these had a diagnosis of mood disorder. Most patients were taking concurrent psychotropic medication and received an average of 9 treatments per course of ECT. Men and patients taking benzodiazepines had shorter convulsions. However, there were no differences in seizure length and number of treatments between younger and older patients and between those taking and not taking tricyclic antidepressants.", 
    "36": "The author briefly outlines the benefits of benzodiazepines and also notes their risks. The usefulness of tricyclic antidepressants as an alternative to long-term benzodiazepines is emphasised.", 
    "37": "In summary, it is proposed that the more frequent or severe side effects associated with the newer triazolo-benzodiazepines are related to an interaction of several factors, including rapid elimination, high receptor-binding affinity, and unique chemical properties. Among benzodiazepine hypnotics, triazolam has a unique side effect profile for CNS adverse reactions in regard to type, frequency, and severity. All of the three factors mentioned contribute to this side effect profile: rapid elimination (the shortest half-life among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); high receptor-binding affinity (the highest among benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics); and unique chemical properties as a triazolo-benzodiazepine. Given these three factors, the drug's side effects can be understood as follows: Hyperexcitability states (daytime anxiety during drug administration and rebound insomnia following withdrawal) are related primarily to its rapid elimination and secondarily to the other two factors, whereas cognitive impairments (amnesia, confusion, and psychiatric symptoms) are related to the high binding affinity and unique chemical properties as well as to its rapid elimination. In contrast, benzodiazepines that are slowly eliminated and have only relatively moderate receptor-binding affinity (flurazepam) are unlikely to produce daytime anxiety and rebound insomnia and CNS adverse reactions such as cognitive impairment. The most common side effect, daytime sedation, is easily recognized and can be managed by dose reduction and/or intermittent use. This safety profile combined with the drug's high degree of efficacy both initially and with continued use provides a high benefit-risk ratio in using the drug in the adjunctive pharmacologic treatment of insomnia. Similarly, temazepam, which has relatively weak receptor-binding affinity produces very few CNS adverse reactions. Furthermore, temazepam (15 mg) is more efficacious than triazolam (0.25 mg). However, temazepam is not as effective as flurazepam, because it is slowly absorbed and therefore has limited efficacy for sleep induction. On the other hand, triazolam's safety profile of frequent and severe adverse reactions combined with the lack of efficacy for the current dose of 0.25 mg limits the drug's usefulness. In fact, the 0.25-mg dose has such a poor benefit-to-risk ratio that there is a real question as to whether the drug should remain on the market.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "38": "PD134308 and PD135158 are potent and selective antagonists at the cholecystokinin type B (CCK-B) receptors with IC50 values of 1.6 nM and 3.5 nM, respectively, in the radioligand binding assay and Ke values of 7.82 and 12.9 nM, respectively, in their blocking action on CCK responses in the rat lateral hypothalamic slice. PD134308 and PD135158 produced potent anxiolytic effects in the mouse black/white box test after either subcutaneous or oral administration. There was no evidence of the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic action of either PD134308 or PD135158 in mice treated twice daily for 7 days, nor was there any sign of withdrawal anxiogenesis after abrupt termination of this treatment. Both CCK-B antagonists were able to suppress the withdrawal anxiogenesis and produce an anxiolytic effect in mice previously made tolerant to diazepam. PD134308 and PD135158 produced potent anxiolytic effects in the rat elevated plus maze test and the rat social interaction test. The effects were comparable in magnitude to those seen with diazepam. However, unlike diazepam, PD134308 and PD135158 did not produce sedation. The CCK-B antagonists also showed powerful anxiolytic activity in the \"marmoset human threat test.\" These results provide evidence of a selective role for CCK-B receptors in the control of anxiety. PD134308 and PD135158 are members of a class of anxiolytic agents that have a greatly improved profile compared with benzodiazepines or serotonin-related anxiolytics.", 
    "39": "A series of pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridines has been synthesized and evaluated as potential anxiolytic agents. Selected compounds from this series show a pharmacological profile of action different from that of diazepam. A number of the compounds possess higher affinity for central benzodiazepine receptors than diazepam, yet show less anticonvulsant activity and are less sedative. The structure-activity relationships of these potential anxiolytic agents are discussed.", 
    "40": "Amiloride (AM) is a well known potassium sparing diuretic. The effects of AM at the cellular level include blockade of Na+/H+ exchange in several tissues and inhibition of passive sodium flux in epithelial cells. In this study we have explored the interactions of amiloride with muscarinic receptors, using isolated rat tracheal rings and compared its effects to those of the muscarinic receptor subtype-selective antagonist pirenzepine (PZ). The results obtained demonstrate the ability of AM (100 microM to 1mM) to inhibit the ACh induced rat tracheal contractions. The inhibition resulted in the reduction of the Emax values of ACh in this preparation, and the apparent Ki for AM was of 478 microM. This effect was also observed in a sodium-free choline medium, indicating that it is independent from sodium transport mechanisms sensitive to AM. In contrast to AM, PZ displayed a surmountable type of antagonism with a pA2 value of 6.52. The results demonstrate a differential antagonism by AM and PZ of the muscarinic receptors present in the smooth muscle of the rat trachea.", 
    "41": "Anticonvulsant tests in mice revealed specific, potent actions of remacemide for protection of mice against maximal electroshock seizures (MES). Comparisons of oral efficacy to reference compounds yielded the following ED50 values (expressed as mg/kg): remacemide = 33, phenytoin = 11, phenobarbital = 20, carbamazepine = 13 and valproate = 631. The duration for protection by remacemide was longer than carbamazepine or valproate, but shorter than phenytoin or phenobarbital. In neural impairment tests (inverted screen or rotorod) to determine the oral toxic dose 50 (TD50) the following therapeutic indices (TD50/ED50) were obtained: (1) inverted screen--remacemide = 17.6, phenytoin = 57.4, phenobarbital = 5.1, carbamazepine = 10.2, and valproate = greater than 3; and (2) rotorod--remacemide = 5.6, phenytoin = 9.6, phenobarbital 4.8, and valproate = 1.9. Remacemide was devoid of sedative actions and possessed a favorable 28.1 margin of safety value (median estimated lethal dose/ED50 for MES). An intermediate potency against either audiogenic- or N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced seizures was exhibited by remacemide. Tolerance to MES was not apparent after 5 days of oral daily dosing of remacemide. Remacemide was inactive in vitro against gamma-aminobutyrate or benzodiazepine receptors and adenosine uptake mechanisms. Therapeutic utility for generalized tonic/clonic seizures is predicted for remacemide.", 
    "42": "1. The effect of several selective muscarine receptor antagonists were evaluated on the responses of carbachol (CCh) and McN-A-343 (McN) during sympathetic nerve stimulation in the rabbit vas deferens. 2. The muscarine M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine exhibited similar apparent pKB values for antagonism of the prejunctional inhibitory response of either CCh (pKB, 8.2) or McN (pKB, 8.5) on sympathetic nerve stimulation. 3. The muscarine M2 receptor antagonists, pancuronium and the bisalkyl ammonium compound 'C7/3-phth' were selective inhibitors of the postjunctional facilitatory response produced by CCh on sympathetic nerve stimulation. They were also 17- and three-fold, respectively, less potent against the inhibitory responses of McN on sympathetic nerve stimulation. The apparent pKB value of pancuronium on the inhibitory response produced by CCh did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) from that using McN. A similar finding was made for C7/3-phth. 4. Selective blockade of the inhibitory response to CCh with pirenzepine (0.03 or 0.5 mumol/L) did not significantly (P greater than 0.05) modify the apparent pKB value for pancuronium on the facilitatory response of CCh. 5. Selective blockade of the facilitatory response to CCh with a low concentration of pancuronium (0.5 mumol/L) did not significantly (P greater than 0.05) modify the apparent pKB value for pancuronium (30 mumol/L) on the inhibitory response of CCh. 6. It is suggested that CCh and McN activate the same prejunctional M1 muscarine receptor and that pancuronium is the most selective of the muscarine M2 receptor antagonists presently tested in this preparation for distinguishing between muscarine M1 and M2 receptors.", 
    "43": "Antidopaminergic drugs delay the pattern-reversal VEP (P-VEP) and the flash VEP (F-VEP) and, in separate studies, reductions in the amplitude and increases in the latencies of scotopic ERGs have been reported. This study investigated the effects of chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the pattern ERG (P-ERG), P-VEP, flash ERGs and VEPs and oscillatory potentials (OPs). Normal volunteers (N = 15) were administered a placebo, or a single dose of CPZ 100 mg or oxazepam (OZP) 15 mg at weekly intervals, in a double-blind crossover design. A gold foil-ipsilateral ear derivation and an Oz'-Fz derivation were used for the ERG and VEP recordings, respectively. The latencies of 'mixed' and cone ERGs were significantly prolonged after CPZ compared to both placebo and to OZP. Amplitudes of rod- and cone-dominated ERGs were reduced following CPZ administration. All components of the OPs were significantly delayed after CPZ administration. No significant intertreatment differences were found in the F-VEP results. The P-ERG P50 peak and the P-VEP N70 and P100 peaks were significantly delayed after CPZ in the case of 28' checks but not 55' checks. Retinocortical times and P-ERG and P-VEP amplitudes were not significantly affected. In contrast to CPZ, the administration of OZP had virtually no significant effects compared to placebo. These findings suggest that the antidopaminergic CPZ has a primary effect on retinal electrophysiology. Similar findings have been reported in Parkinson's disease and in animal models.", 
    "44": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) regulates various gastrointestinal functions through specific receptors. The mechanisms responsible for disorders of these functions could be elucidated by non-invasively localizing CCK receptors and quantifying their number in vivo. MK-329 is a highly selective and very high affinity antagonist at the peripheral CCK receptor. We investigated the in vivo binding of [3H](+/-)-MK-329 in mice to determine if binding to CCK receptors could be detected after systemic administration of the tracer. The uptake of [3H](+/-)-MK-329 increased in the pancreas from 5 min to 4 h after administration. The binding was saturable, stereospecific, and more than 80% specific. A total/non-specific binding ratio of 43 was reached at 8 h post-injection. The pancreas was the only organ where specific binding could be detected. Our results suggest that MK-329 labeled with a positron emitter such as C-11 could be used with positron emission tomography to image and quantify peripheral CCK receptors in man.",

Maximal effects were seen at relatively low doses of these compounds. In contrast, the partial agonists Ro 17-1812 (a benzodiazepine) and ZK 91296 (a beta-carboline), did not modify rectal temperature at doses up to 30 mg/kg i.p. (which would be receptor saturating). Body temperature may therefore be a useful test for discriminating between full and partial agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor.",

    "47": "Effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist GR38032F (ondansetron) on chlordiazepoxide withdrawal were assessed in rats which received chlordiazepoxide b.i.d. for 21 days at doses up to 40 mg/kg per injection. Withdrawal signs recorded were: body weight and food intake, which fell and then recovered over 9 days. Saline or GR38032F (1.0, 0.1 or 0.01 mg/kg) were administered b.i.d. during withdrawal. Clear withdrawal signs were seen in rats treated with saline after chronic chlordiazepoxide. However, GR38032F at 0.1 mg/kg reduced the severity of withdrawal. At 0.01 mg/kg GR38032F shortened withdrawal duration, but did not diminish peak withdrawal signs. At 1.0 mg/kg GR38032F, did not attenuate withdrawal signs at all. GR38032F (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) had no effect on ad lib food intake, therefore the attenuation of withdrawal was probably not simply due to stimulation of appetite. These data support recent claims that GR38032F attenuates benzodiazepine withdrawal, and they indicate that this effect shows an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve.", 
    "48": "Previous studies have shown in the rat that long-term diazepam treatment induces a desensitization of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) benzodiazepine receptors which modulate serotonergic (5-HT) neuron firing activity in the dorsal raphe. We have examined the effect of a 21-day treatment with diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) on the benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) which modulate the efficacy of the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway in suppressing the firing activity of rat dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons. The efficacy of the stimulation was not modified 24 h after the last dose of diazepam. Moreover, the potentiating effect of acute diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.v.) on the efficacy of the stimulation was similar in diazepam- and vehicle-treated rats. These results indicate that GABA-benzodiazepine receptors that modulate the release of 5-HT in the rat dorsal hippocampus are not desensitized by long-term diazepam treatment.", 
    "49": "Binding of the neurosteroid dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) to rat brain synaptosomal membranes was studied in vitro, and the interaction of DHEAS with the GABAA receptor was tested using biochemical and electrophysiological assays. DHEAS bound to two populations of sites, and its binding was inhibited by barbiturates. DHEAS interfered with barbiturate-mediated enhancement of benzodiazepine binding. In cultured neurons from ventral mesencephalon, DHEAS reversibly blocked GABA-induced currents, behaving as an allosteric antagonist of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "50": "Increased inhibition of gastric acid release through simultaneous blockade of H2-receptors and muscarine-receptors or administration of gastroprotective agent is theoretically justified in patients with peptic ulcer unresponsive to cimetidine. The study involved 70 patients with peptic ulcer previously treated with cimetidine in daily dose 1000 mg for 6 weeks without an effect. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 treated with cimetidine plus pirenzepine, and group 2 given sucralfate in daily dose 4.0 g. Pirenzepine to patients of group 1 was given in a single dose of 50 mg before bedtime. Both groups were comparable in age, sex, disease onset, smoking, gastric acid secretion, and ulcer size. Healing was evaluated with endoscopic technique following 2 and weeks of therapy. Ulceration healed up within 2 weeks in 40% of patients treated with cimetidine combined with pirenzepine and in 31.4% patients treated with sucralfate. After 4 weeks, healing of ulceration was 71.4% and 68.6%, respectively. Large ulcers (over 1 cm in diameter) and previous partial gastrectomy did not affect healing rate. The obtained results suggest that administered therapies enable recovery in over 2/3 of patients with peptic ulcer unresponsive to a 6-week therapy with cimetidine alone.", 
    "51": "With [3H]cytidine as a precursor, phosphoinositide turnover can be localized in brain slices by selective autoradiography of the product [3H]cytidine diphosphate diacylglycerol, which is membrane-bound. In the cerebellum, glutamatergic stimulation elicits an increase of phosphoinositide turnover only in Purkinje cells and the molecular layer. In the hippocampus, both glutamatergic and muscarinic cholinergic stimulation increase phosphoinositide turnover, but with distinct localizations. Cholinergic stimulation affects CA1, CA3, CA4, and subiculum, whereas glutamatergic effects are restricted to the subiculum and CA3. Imaging phosphoinositide turnover in brain slices, which are amenable to electrophysiologic studies, will permit a dynamic localized analysis of regulation of this second messenger in response to synaptic stimulation of specific neuronal pathways.", 
    "52": "Benzodiazepines are widely prescribed anxiolytics and anticonvulsants which bind with high affinity to sites on the GABAA receptor/Cl- channel complex and potentiate the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). The heterogeneity of benzodiazepine recognition sites in the central nervous system was revealed by studies showing different classes of GABAA receptor subunits (classes alpha, beta and gamma) and variant subunits in these classes, particularly in the alpha-class. Expression of recombinant subunits produces functional receptors; when certain alpha-variants are coexpressed with beta- and gamma-subunits the resulting receptors have pharmacological properties characteristic of GABAA-benzodiazepine type I or type II receptors. The alpha-variants are differentially expressed in the central nervous system and can be photoaffinity-labelled with benzodiazepines. Here we report a novel alpha-subunit (alpha 6) of cerebellar granule cells. We show that recombinant receptors composed of alpha 6, beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits bind with high affinity to the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol and the benzodiazepine [3H]Ro15-4513 but not the other benzodiazepines or beta-carboniles. The same distinctive pharmacology is observed with GABAA receptors from rat cerebellum immunoprecipitated by an antiserum specific for the alpha 6 subunit. We conclude that this alpha-subunit is part of a cerebellar receptor subtype, selective for Ro15-4513, an antagonist of alcohol-induced motor incoordination and ataxia.", 
    "53": "PK 14105, a photoaffinity ligand specific for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBZR), was photochemically coupled to omega-aminobutyl agarose (ABAg) to yield PK 14105 agarose (PKAg). 19F and 1H NMR spectroscopy were consistent with the proposed site of coupling at the 2'-fluorine of PK 14105 by the primary amine moiety of ABAg. Quantitation of the affinity gel using two different colorimetric assays for primary amines suggests approximately 50% of the available primary amine groups of ABAg were bound by PK 14105. The estimated concentration of PK 14105 bound to ABAg was 2.3 mumols/ml of settled gel (2.3 mM effective ligand concentration). PKAg specifically binds the bovine PBZR solubilized by digitonin. The affinity of PKAg for the soluble PBZR was estimated by varying the concentration of PKAg. PBZR binding to PKAg was saturable and the apparent affinity of PKAg for the bovine receptor was estimated from the saturation data. A PKAg affinity column bound 85% of the solubilized PBZR from rat adrenals partially purified by anion exchange chromatography. These results indicate PKAg is a receptor-specific affinity media which may be useful in the purification of the native PBZR from various species.", 
    "54": "In the present study we identified and characterized the distribution of high-affinity peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBzS) in male rat vas deferens (whole, and prostatic and epididymal portions), prostate, seminal vesicles, and Cowper's glands. [3H]PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide derivative, was used as a radioligand specific for PBzS. Scatchard analysis of saturation curves of [3H]PK 11195 binding in the whole vas deferens, the prostatic and epididymal portions of the vas deferens, the prostate, the seminal vesicles, and Cowper's glands yielded mean maximal numbers of binding sites of 1211 +/- 158, 1012 +/- 311, 1451 +/- 156, 1805 +/- 86, 865 +/- 51, and 2251 +/- 135 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constant values ranged between 1 and 3 mM in all the above tissues. The ability of various drugs to displace the specific binding of [3H]PK 11195 from PBzS in Cowper's gland membranes was also tested. The inhibition constants for Ro 5-4864, diazepam, and PK 11195 were 28, 330, and 4 nM, respectively, whereas clonazepam, Ro 15-1788, and testosterone were inefficient in displacing [3H]PK 11195. The presence of high densities of PBzS in the male genital tract suggests a functional role in these hormone-dependent organs.", 
    "55": "Bath application of two different concentrations of muscarine produced two different effects on evoked responses in the dentate gyrus of rat hippocampal slices. A concentration of 1 microM muscarine did not affect the evoked population spike or excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), but facilitated the induction of LTP. In contrast, a concentration of 10 microM muscarine depressed both the population spike and EPSP, but had no effect on LTP induction. The M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 microM) blocked the muscarine-induced facilitation of LTP, but had no effect on the depression of evoked responses. These data suggest that activation of M1 receptors can facilitate the induction of LTP.", 
    "56": "The effects of intrahippocampal injections to the M1-selective antagonist pirenzepine and the M2-selective antagonist AF-DX 116 were examined on performance of a representational memory task in rats. Although both antagonists impaired performance, pirenzepine was more potent than AF-DX 116. Pirenzepine (70.8 +/- 2.8% correct) produced a greater deficit than AF-DX 116 (83.3 +/- 0.0%) at 70 micrograms, and the deficit at 10 micrograms (83.3 +/- 2.8%) was equal to that produced by 70 micrograms of AF-DX 116. The data provide additional support for the cholinergic hypothesis of memory and new information regarding the subtypes of muscarinic receptors likely to be involved in representational memory. Based on the greater susceptibility of representational memory to the effects of pirenzepine, it is suggested that M1 receptors in the hippocampus play a greater role in memory function than M2 receptors.", 
    "57": "The object of this investigation was to describe and analyse differences in psychiatric training and attitudes to and employment of psychotropic drugs among general practitioners with and without training in psychotherapy, respectively. The investigation was carried out as a multicentre questionnaire investigation in the County of Aarhus with participation of 192 out of 215 (89%) doctors who were invited. Thirty-nine of the participating general practitioners (20%) had participated in a supervised course in psychoanalytically orientated psychotherapy. Doctors who were trained in psychotherapy had more rarely had appointments in psychiatric departments than other doctors. Doctors trained in psychotherapy prescribed fewer benzodiazepines than other doctors (p less than 0.05) and there was psychotherapy chose psychotherapy more frequently (p = 0.02) and more rarely tendency to a lower total prescription of psychotropic drugs. Doctors trained in a psychotropic drugs (p = 0.004) than doctors without this training as treatment for patients with psychosocial conflicts and they more rarely chose psychotropic drugs to supplement psychotherapy (p less than 0.0001). It is concluded that one of the ways of reducing the massive use of psychotropic drugs in Denmark is to improve general practitioners' training in psychotherapy.", 
    "58": "GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, mediates neuronal inhibition by opening a chloride channel integral to the GABAA receptor. This action is potentiated by both benzodiazepine and barbiturate drugs. Since the isolation of cDNAs encoding GABAA receptor alpha 1 and beta 1 subunits, a further eight subunits have been identified. These subunits show GABAA receptor heterogeneity, unpredicted from classical pharmacological studies. I now report the isolation of a mouse cDNA clone encoding a novel GABAA receptor alpha subunit. The striking feature of this subunit is its regional distribution in the mouse brain. Northern hybridization and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrate that the subunit mRNA is expressed only in cerebellar granule cells. This is the first demonstration of the exclusive presence of a neuroreceptor subtype in a single neuronal cell type.", 
    "59": "Although cholecystokinin (CCK) has been reported to stimulate pepsinogen secretion, this action has been poorly characterized. To assess the ability of CCK to regulate mammalian pepsinogen secretion, guinea pig fundic mucosa was incubated in Ussing chambers with CCK-8, carbamylcholine, and pentagastrin, and with cholinergic and CCK antagonists. CCK-8 stimulated pepsinogen secretion at 10(-10) M, with an ED50 of 10(-9) M and maximally (26-fold over basal) at 10(-8) M. Carbachol stimulated pepsinogen and acid secretion with an ED50 of 3 x 10(-7) M and maximally at 10(-6) M. Pentagastrin (10(-9) M-10(-6) M) did not affect acid or pepsinogen secretion, whereas gastrin-I (10(-6) M) stimulated acid secretion slightly but did not alter pepsinogen secretion. L364, 718 (10(-5) M), a specific CCK peripheral receptor antagonist, abolished all pepsigogic effects of 3 x 10(-9) M CCK-8 without altering basal acid or pepsinogen secretion or mucosal electric characteristics. L364,718-treated tissues unresponsive to CCK-8 nevertheless secreted pepsinogen and acid in response to 3 x 10(-7) M carbachol identically to control carbachol-treated preparations. Atropine (10(-5) M) blocked the response to 3 x 10(-7) M carbachol without inhibiting 10(-9) M CCK stimulation. These results support a specific receptor-mediated role for cholecystokinin in the physiologic regulation of guinea pig pepsinogen secretion.", 
    "60": "A series of 15 pyrrolo[2, 1-c] [1, 4]benzodiazepine-5, 11-diones has been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro DNA binding by thermal denaturation and fluorescence quenching studies with calf thymus (CT) DNA. The results indicate that two compounds of the series, 7 and 8, elevate the melting point of DNA by 2.9 +/- 0.6 and 3.3 +/- 0.8 K, respectively. Similarly, a significant quenching of the fluorescence of the dihydroxy analogue 8 was observed upon interaction with CT-DNA. As controls, the dihydroxy isomer 9 with the reverse stereochemistry at C2 and the non-substituted parent dilactam 12, failed to increase the DNA melting point or exhibit significant quenching upon interaction with DNA. In addition, preliminary experiments with GC- and AT-rich polymers suggest some sequence-dependent properties for dilactams 7 and 8. Overall, these results indicate a highly specific structural requirement for DNA binding. Molecular modelling with d(GTAGATC), d(GCAGATC) and d(GCGTAGC) duplex sequences has provided a model based on hydrogen bonding between the dihydroxy dilactam 8 and DNA, that rationalizes some of the results obtained. It is possible that the observed interactions represent the non-covalent (binding) component of the interaction of covalently-bonding anthramycin-type anti-tumour antibiotics with DNA.", 
    "61": "Chlordiazepoxide (CDE) reacts with sodium nitrite at acid pH yielding the genotoxic derivative N-nitrosochlordiazepoxide (NO-CDE). In the present study oral administration of CDE plus NaNO2, previously found to produce DNA fragmentation in the rat liver, was examined for its ability to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. The oral treatment for 6 successive weeks with CDE + NaNO2, added to the diet at the levels of 290 + 270 and 870 + 800 ppm, did not significantly increase the number or volume of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase-positive foci (putative preneoplastic lesions). These findings are in agreement with the negative results previously obtained in rodent carcinogenesis assays and indicate that NO-CDE belongs to the progressively expanding list of genotoxic non-carcinogens.", 
    "62": "In prospective alternative crossover test, we confirmed significant superiority of a three-drug combination of clonazepam (C) lorazepam (L) and dexamethasone (D) to (L) and (D) to control vomiting induced by 50 mg/m CDDP containing chemotherapy for gynecological malignancies (p less than 0.001). Vomiting frequency in initial 24 hours was 2.28 +/- 2.21 and 6.00 +/- 3.80 times a day respectively. According to this result, clonazepam, dexamethasone, metoclopramide and diphenhydramine (B) were used as a second regimen to control the vomiting in 80 mg/m CDDP containing chemotherapy for ovarian cancer patients. Clonazepam (2 mg 2 times p.o. -4 and 0 hrs before CDDP drip), dexamethasone (8 mg 5 times iv from -3 hrs each 3 hrs), metoclopramide (2.5 mg/kg iv loading from -2 hrs with 0.4 mg/kg/hr continuous infusion for 9 hrs) and diphenhydramine (30 mg/body 2 times im -2.6 hrs) were chosen to control CDDP-induced nausea and vomiting. These four drugs (C+L+D+B) prominently inhibited the chemo-induced vomiting up to 0.44 +/- 1.50 times a day, and 87.5% of courses was completely satisfactory.", 
    "63": "To study the relationship of cocaine use to syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infections a blinded urine and serum survey was performed among parturient women at an inner city hospital. Discarded urine samples of 1206 parturient women were saved and given code numbers that were also assigned to data sheets containing nonidentifying information, including prenatal care status and syphilis serologic results. In the latter part of the study blood remaining after syphilis serologic tests were performed (n = 480) were tested for human immunodeficiency virus antibodies. Overall 12.9% of urine samples had cocaine derivatives, 1.4% opiates, 1.5% marijuana, 0.0% benzodiazepine, and 0.3% methadone. The prevalence of positive rapid plasma reagin tests was 18.7% among patients with positive urine toxicologic tests for cocaine and 2.41% for patients with negative urine tests (odds ratio = 9.3, 95% confidence interval 5.2 to 16.5, p less than 0.001). Fluorescent treponemal antibodies were also significantly more frequent among patients with positive urine samples. Four of 53 (7.6%) patients with positive urine toxicologic screens were human immunodeficiency virus antibody positive compared with six of 427 (1.4%) women with negative screens (odds ratio = 5.7, 95% confidence interval = 1.4 to 21.5, p = 0.019). Cocaine patients with positive cocaine screens and with syphilis or human immunodeficiency virus had prenatal care in 6 of 21 (28.6%) and 0 of 4 (0%) cases, respectively, while patients with negative cocaine screens and syphilis or human immunodeficiency virus had prenatal care in 13 of 18 (72.2%) and 5 of 6 (83.3%) cases, respectively (p = 0.010 and p = 0.048). Cocaine use appears to be associated with both the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis and the failure of infected individuals to utilize prenatal services.", 
    "64": "This article describes the use of a subcutaneous infusion of midazolam to control restlessness and agitation in 23 patients during the final stages of advanced cancer. Midazolam effectively controlled symptoms in 22 of the patients at an initial dose of 0.4-0.8 mg/hr rising to a mean maximum dose of 2.9 mg/hr. Midazolam mixed in the same syringe as diamorphine was well tolerated at injection sites. The wide dose range emphasizes the need for careful titration of dose for individual patients. At high doses, the volume of injection required presented some practical difficulties, but otherwise there were no major problems with this technique. Midazolam by subcutaneous infusion is a well-tolerated, safe and effective treatment for terminal restlessness and agitation, and deserves more extensive evaluation.", 
    "65": "A technique of receptor protection that enables selective preservation of one receptor type was used in conjunction with preferential antagonists of cholecystokinin (L364,718) and gastrin (L365,260) to characterize cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin receptors on isolated single muscle cells of the guinea pig stomach and gallbladder. In gastric muscle cells, CCK-8 and gastrin-17 were equipotent and the concentration causing 50% inhibition of response (IC50) values of both antagonists were independent of the agonist, whereas in gallbladder muscle cells, CCK-8 was more potent than gastrin-17 and the IC50 values of the antagonists were dependent on the agonist. In gastric muscle cells, CCK-8, gastrin-17, and L364,718 protected completely the response to CCK-8 or gastrin-17, and L365,260 protected partially but equally the response to both agonists. In gallbladder muscle cells, CCK-8 and L364,718 protected completely and gastrin-17 and L365,260 protected partially the response to CCK-8; conversely, gastrin-17 and L365,260 protected completely and CCK-8 and L364,718 protected partially the response to gastrin-17. The patterns of response in muscle cells from the two regions indicate the presence of one receptor type in gastric muscle cells that interacts equally with gastrin and CCK, and of two receptor types in gallbladder muscle cells, one of which interacts preferentially with CCK and the other preferentially with gastrin.", 
    "66": "ICU physicians generally rely on either narcotics or benzodiazepines to provide analgesia and sedation. We describe five patients in whom ketamine administered as a bolus dose of 0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 to 15 micrograms/kg.min, provided effective sedation and analgesia without significantly compromising cardiorespiratory function. Four of these patients previously experienced deleterious cardiorespiratory effects from either benzodiazepines or narcotics. In three patients who were breathing spontaneously, PaCO2 remained less than 44 torr during the ketamine infusion. With ketamine, no reduction in mean arterial pressure from baseline was noted in any patient. As with any form of iv anesthesia, ketamine can have cardiorespiratory side-effects; therefore, the means to manage these effects should be readily available.", 
    "67": "The midazolam-morphine interactions in relation to the sedative effect and in relation to the hypnotic effect were studied in rats. Two series of experiments (sedative and hypnotic) were performed. In the sedative series, doses that inhibited locomotor activity to 10% or more of the control level were determined when the agents were given singly or in combination. Dose-response curves were determined with a probit procedure. The ED50 values of both agents and their combination were compared with algebraic (fractional) and isobolographic analyses in one subseries of experiments. The effect of a small fixed dose of morphine (1/10 of ED50 value for the sedative effect) on the slope of the sedative dose-response curve for midazolam was determined in the other subseries. In the hypnotic series of experiments, doses (ED50) that blocked the righting reflex with drugs given separately and in combination were determined by a probit procedure and, as in the sedative series, compared with algebraic (fractional) and isobolographic analyses. Sedative interaction between midazolam and morphine was found to have a tendency for synergism (interaction coefficient of 1.56, P greater than 0.05) with decreased individual variability in the sedative response to the combination. Hypnotic midazolam-morphine interaction was highly synergistic with the interaction coefficient of 3.70 (P less than 0.0001). A difference in the outcomes of midazolam-morphine interaction regarding sedation and hypnosis suggests that underlying mechanisms for these two effects are different; therefore, they should not be regarded as only increasing depths of the same action.", 
    "68": "Among 48 patients with diagnoses of depression according to DSM-III, there was a significant relation between therapeutic failure of unilateral ECT, as measured by scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the concomitant use of a benzodiazepine. Of the 34 patients who showed a good therapeutic response to unilateral ECT, those taking benzodiazepines had smaller changes in their Hamilton depression ratings from before treatment to after treatment and were more symptomatic at the end of the course of ECT. Thus, when patients take benzodiazepines during a course of unilateral ECT, the maximum therapeutic response may be compromised.", 
    "69": "It was shown in acute experiments on cats that electrical stimulation (ES) (100-300 Hz, 5.0-10.0 V) of cat's cerebellar vermal cortex (lobules V and VI) was followed by head deviation in the direction opposite to that side on which the animal was laying, posture and movement disturbances and also by simultaneously occurred contraction of musculus-antagonists of extremities. The tonic and posture disturbances were observed during 40-60 s after ES cessation. During this time in the zone of ES in cerebellar cortex the high-amplitude synchronized activity was registered which was due to generator of pathologically enhanced excitation (GPEE) formation. Intraperitoneal diazepam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, 30 min before the observation) pretreatment suppressed GPEE formation that correlated with suppression of syndrome manifestations. The conclusion was made that cerebellar hyperactive cortex, which was due to GPEE induction, might have played the role of pathological hyperactive determinant structure of the described syndrome.", 
    "70": "The introduction of nalbuphine to intravenous sedation with midazolam added little to the quality of sedation for short operative procedures. There was a greater tendency for patients who received nalbuphine and midazolam to sleep in the afternoon after treatment compared with those who received only midazolam. Significantly more patients had nausea and vomiting in the midazolam/nalbuphine group than did patients in the midazolam-only group.", 
    "71": "The Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) Scale was developed to measure the level of alertness in subjects who are sedated. This scale was tested in 18 subjects in a three-period crossover study to assess its reliability and its criterion, behavioral, and construct validity. After receiving either placebo or a titrated dose of midazolam to produce light or heavy sedation, each subject was administered two sedation scales (OAA/S Scale and a Visual Analogue Scale) and two performances tests (Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Serial Sevens Subtraction). Two raters individually evaluated the subject's level of alertness on each of the two sedation scales. The results obtained on the OAA/S Scale were reliable and valid as measured by high correlations between the two raters and high correlations between the OAA/S Scale and two of the three standard tests used in this study. The OAA/S Scale was sensitive to the level of midazolam administered; all pairwise comparisons were significant (p less than 0.05) for all three treatment levels at both test periods.", 
    "72": "A randomized cross-over study was carried out to determine whether midazolam in doses used for conscious sedation had any effect on the potency or duration of diflunisal, a non-narcotic analgesic used for postoperative pain in oral surgery. Thirty-two Hong Kong Chinese patients of either sex, aged between 16 and 28 years, were given either midazolam to supplement local anaesthesia or local anaesthesia alone at one visit and the alternative at the other visit, for surgical removal of bilateral symmetrically impacted third molars. Surgery was carried out on one side only at each visit. Diflunisal was given for postoperative pain relief. Midazolam had no effect on the potency or duration of action of diflunisal. Independent of the method, more patients had better pain relief following the second procedure than following the first, probably due to a degree of adaptation to the pain, at the second visit.", 
    "73": "Both H2-receptor antagonists and pirenzepine are used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. Since we have recently found a higher frequency of non-responders to H2-receptor antagonists among cirrhotics, we tested the effect of the combination of 50 mg pirenzepine and 300 mg ranitidine in 25 patients (12 cirrhotics and 13 controls) in whom a normal 300 mg dose of ranitidine had failed to suppress intragastric acidity. Nocturnal intragastric pH was continuously monitored for 12 hours. A rise in the intragastric pH above 4.0 for more than 6 hours following the oral dose at 18.00 h was considered as response. In all subjects, plasma concentrations of ranitidine and pirenzepine were in the therapeutic range. Coadministration of pirenzepine and ranitidine resulted in sufficient increase of the intragastric pH in only 4 of the 12 patients with cirrhosis, and in 4 of the 13 control patients. This treatment failure in most of our patients does not support the view that excessive vagal drive might play an important role in the non-response to H2-blockers. With regard to the benefit resulting from coadministration of pirenzepine and ranitidine, there seems to be no difference between cirrhotic and control patients.", 
    "74": "Intracellular recording techniques were used to compare the effects of the M2 muscarinic antagonists, AF-DX 116 and gallamine, on membrane potential (Vm), input resistance (Ri), responses induced by methacholine, muscarinic slow postsynaptic potentials and action potentials in the superior cervical ganglion of the rabbit. Gallamine or AF-DX 116 antagonized methacholine-induced or synaptically-evoked muscarinic hyperpolarization, without having significant effect on depolarization induced by methacholine or synaptically. The drug AF-DX 116 reduced evoked muscarinic hyperpolarizing potentials, without significant change in Vm or Ri, recorded in the absence of muscarinic stimulation. In contrast to AF-DX 116, gallamine elicited a concentration-dependent depolarization of the membrane, with a corresponding increase in Ri, when tested in the absence of muscarinic stimulation. These effects of gallamine were accompanied by an increase in duration and decrease in the slope of the descending phase of the action potential. Blockade by gallamine of evoked hyperpolarization was independent of membrane depolarization and readily occurred when gallamine-induced depolarization was prevented by clamping Vm at its pre-gallamine level. The effects of gallamine were maintained during its presence and reversed upon washing with gallamine-free physiological solution. These results indicate that AF-DX 116 and gallamine have a specificity for antagonism of muscarinic responses, mediated by receptors of the M2 type in the superior cervical ganglion. However, gallamine, while an effective antagonist of M2 responses, also has the ability to modify the electrical characteristics of ganglion cells and thus may modify ganglionic transmission by mechanisms other than antagonism of receptors.",

    "76": "The authors monitored the plasma levels of clobazam (CLO) and its principal metabolite, N-desmethylclobazam (NCLO) during chronic treatment of more than 400 epileptic patients receiving different co-medications, such as phenytoin (PH), carbamazepine (CBZ), sodium valproate (VPA) and phenobarbital (PB). This study investigated the influence of age and antiepileptic drugs on plasma levels of CLO and NCLO. Plasma concentrations measured 3 hr after morning administration of CLO varied from 30 to 700 [formula; see text] for CLO, and from 160 to 7000 [formula; see text] for NCLO. Plasma levels of CLO were higher in patients aged 20-30 years. NCLO concentrations increased with age up to 20 years. Coadministered antiepileptic compounds significantly decreased maximal plasma levels of CLO. Moreover, PH and CBZ a significantly increased the plasma levels of NCLO. Results on the influence of CBZ on CLO kinetics were confirmed in a group of ten patients receiving PB and VPA and later PB, VPA and CBZ as CLO associated drugs. The influence of VPA on the pharmacokinetics parameters of CLO was also evaluated in a patient in the latter group.", 
    "77": "The influence of the skeletal muscle tone by flupirtine (D-9998, Katadolon; CAS 56995-20-1), some selected analgesics and muscle relaxants was investigated in conscious rats after intraperitoneal administration. Benzodiazepines (diazepam and tetrazepam), baclofen, dantrolene and mephenesine reduced the tone of the skeletal muscle. Opiate analgesics, such as morphine, codeine and tramadol, enhanced the muscle tone. Flupirtine reduced the skeletal muscle tone at doses comparable with its antinociceptive effective doses. In this dose range no sedative side effects as ataxia or decrease of spontaneous motor activity could be observed. The mode of this muscle relaxing effect of flupirtine is not known in all details. It is, however, likely that flupirtine is able to inhibit the mono- and/or polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal level.", 
    "78": "A transient insomnia model, the \"first night\" effect in the sleep laboratory, was used to assess the dose range for the hypnotic and sleep stage effects of temazepam. 201 healthy, normal subjects (97 men and 104 women), 21 to 49 years old, with no sleep complaints were studied. Each was randomly assigned to receive either placebo, 7.5, 15, or 30 mg temazepam hard gelatin capsules (Restoril) administered double-blind 30 min before bedtime on their first night in the sleep laboratory. Over the 8-h polysomnogram total sleep time and sleep efficiency increased significantly in a linear fashion with increasing doses of temazepam. Sleep tendency was significantly reduced by increasing doses again in a linear manner. Wake time during the sleep period was reduced significantly only by the higher dose. The percentage of stage 1 sleep was reduced and the percentage of stage 2 sleep was increased, each linearly with increasing doses. These data are the first to demonstrate the hypnotic effects of a 7.5 mg dose of temazepam and also support previous studies of 15 and 30 mg temazepam administered to chronic insomniacs. They also illustrate the utility of the \"first night\" effect as a model of transient insomnia."
