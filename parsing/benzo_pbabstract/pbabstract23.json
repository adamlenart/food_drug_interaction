Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating oral CHM alone or in combination with conventional therapies for primary insomnia were identified by searching English and Chinese publications and databases of clinical trial registration. Risk of bias was assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook 5.1. Meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.2.4. Seventy-nine trials (7886 participants) were finally included in the review, and 76 were included in the meta-analysis. Twenty-seven trials reported the methods of random sequence generation, and five of them used the allocation concealment. Blinding of participants and personnel were used in 10 studies. The main meta-analysis showed that CHM alone was more effective than placebo by reducing scores of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (mean difference, MD: -3.06, 95% confidence interval, CI: -5.14 to -0.98, I(2)\u2009=\u200997%) and benzodiazepine drugs (BZDs) (MD: -1.94, 95% CI: -2.45 to -1.43, I(2)\u2009=\u200996%). The effect was also seen when CHM was combined with BZDs compared with placebo plus BZDs (MD: -1.88, 95% CI: -2.78 to -0.97, I(2)\u2009=\u20090%) or cognitive and behavioral therapy (MD: -3.80, 95% CI: -4.91 to -2.68, I(2)\u2009=\u200968%) alone. There was no significant difference between CHM and placebo regarding the frequency of adverse events (relative risk, RR: 1.65, 95% CI: 0.67-4.10, I(2)\u2009=\u20090). Overall, oral CHM used as a monotherapy or as an adjunct to conventional therapies appears safe, and it may improve subjective sleep in people with insomnia. However, the typical effect of CHM for insomnia cannot be determined due to heterogeneity. Further study focusing on individual CHM formula for insomnia is needed. The development of a comparable placebo is also needed to improve the successful blinding in RCTs.", 
    "1": "Acetylcholine (ACh) and ATP are rapidly acting neurotransmitters with a putative role in epileptic seizures. In the present study we investigated extracellular concentrations of both neurotransmitters in parallel by microdialysis in rat hippocampus. We found that infusion of neostigmine increases, while calcium-free perfusion and infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) decreases, ACh levels. Calcium-free perfusion also decreased ATP levels which were, however, not affected by neostigmine or TTX. During status epilepticus, ACh levels were increased threefold but returned to baseline after the termination of seizures by diazepam. ATP levels were unchanged during status epilepticus but a several-fold increase was seen when AOPCP, an inhibitor of 5'-endonucleotidase, was infused. The results demonstrate an increase of ATP levels during epileptic seizures which, however, was not of neuronal origin.", 
    "2": "Based on a similar approach for quantification of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and z-drugs, a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) multi-analyte approach with simple liquid-liquid extraction was extended for fast target screening and quantification of neuroleptics in whole blood, plasma, and serum. As this method is part of a multi-analyte procedure for over 100 analytes from different drug classes and as the extracts were additionally used in the authors' laboratory for gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, one universal stable-isotope-labelled internal standard (SIL-IS) was used to save time and resource. The method was validated with respect to international guidelines. For accuracy and precision, full calibration was performed with ranges from subtherapeutic to toxic concentrations. Selectivity problems could not be observed, but matrix effects ranged from 68 to 211% in all samples. For the low quality control (QC), recovery ranged from 32 to 112%, process efficiency from 31 to 165% and for the high QC recovery from 42 to 141%, process efficiency from 29 to 154%. In addition statistical data evaluation of the variances of the recovery, matrix effects, and process efficiency data between whole blood vs. plasma, whole blood vs. serum, and plasma vs. serum were done. The presented LC-MS/MS approach was applicable for selective detection of 33 neuroleptics as well as accurate and precise quantification of 25 neuroleptics in whole blood, 19 in plasma, and 17 in serum. More significant matrix effects (ME) for neuropletic drugs overall in plasma and serum as compared with whole blood were detected. Copyright \u00a9 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", 
    "3": "Intravenous and intramuscular antiseizure drugs (ASDs) are essential in the treatment of clinical seizure emergencies as well as in replacement therapy when oral administration is not possible. The parenteral formulations provide rapid delivery and complete (intravenous) or nearly complete (intramuscular) bioavailability. Controlled administration of the ASD is feasible with intravenous but not intramuscular formulations. This article reviews the literature and discusses the chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and clinical use of currently available intravenous and intramuscular ASD formulations as well as the development of new formulations and agents. Intravenous or intramuscular formulations of lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam, and clonazepam are typically used as the initial treatment agents in seizure emergencies. Recent studies also support the use of intramuscular midazolam as easier than the intravenous delivery of lorazepam in the pre-hospital setting. However, benzodiazepines may be associated with hypotension and respiratory depression. Although loading with intravenous phenytoin was an early approach to treatment, it is associated with cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, and tissue injury at the injection site. This has made it less favored than fosphenytoin, a water-soluble, phosphorylated phenytoin molecule. Other drugs being used for acute seizure emergencies are intravenous formulations of valproic acid, levetiracetam, and lacosamide. However, the comparative effectiveness of these for status epilepticus (SE) has not been evaluated adequately. Consequently, guidelines for the medical management of SE continue to recommend lorazepam followed by fosphenytoin, or phenytoin if fosphenytoin is not available. Intravenous solutions for carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and topiramate have been developed but remain investigational. The current ASDs were not developed for use in emergency situations, but were adapted from ASDs approved for chronic oral use. New approaches for bringing drugs from experimental models to treatment of human SE are needed.",

They were randomly assigned to either DSI + PS or PS only. Children in both study arms received sedation adjusted on the basis of validated sedation scores. Provided a safety screen was passed, children in the DSI + PS group received daily blinded infusions of saline; children in the PS group received blinded infusions of the previous sedatives/analgesics. If a patient's sedation score indicated distress, the blinded infusions were discontinued, a bolus dose of midazolam was given and the 'open' infusions were resumed: DSI + PS at half of infusion rate, PS at previous infusion rate.

Here, enabled by a recently developed voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) assay in mouse brain slices, we examined the impact of chronic stress and concentration-dependent effects of eight clinically used ADs (belonging to different chemical/functional classes) on evoked neuronal activity propagations through the hippocampal trisynaptic circuitry (HTC: perforant path \u2192 dentate gyrus (DG) \u2192 area CA3 \u2192 area CA1). Exposure of mice to chronic social defeat stress led to markedly weakened activity propagations (\"HTC-Waves\"). In contrast, at concentrations in the low micromolar range, all ADs, which were bath applied to slices, caused an amplification of HTC-Waves in CA regions (invariably in area CA1). The fast-acting \"antidepressant\" ketamine, the mood stabilizer lithium, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) exerted comparable enhancing effects, whereas the antipsychotic haloperidol and the anxiolytic diazepam attenuated HTC-Waves. Collectively, we provide direct experimental evidence that chronic stress can depress neuronal signal flow through the HTC and demonstrate shared opposing effects of ADs. Thus, our study points to a circuit-level mechanism of ADs to counteract stress-induced impairment of hippocampal network function. However, the observed effects of ADs are impossible to depend on enhanced neurogenesis.", 
    "53": "Instrumental identification of drugs with quantification is essential in forensic toxicology, while on-site immunoassay urinalysis drug-screening devices conveniently provide preliminary information when adequately used. However, suitable or sufficient urine specimens are not always available. The present study evaluated the efficacy of a new on-site immunoassay drug-screening device Triage-TOX (Alere Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), which has recently been developed to provide objective data on the one-step automated processor, using 51 urine and 19 pericardial fluid samples from 66 forensic autopsy cases, compared with Triage-Drug of Abuse (DOA) and Monitect-9. For benzodiazepines, the positive predictive value and specificity of Triage-TOX were higher than those of Triage-DOA; however, sensitivity was higher with Monitect-9, despite frequent false-positives. The results for the other drugs with the three devices also included a few false-negatives and false-positives. These observations indicate the applicability of Triage-TOX in preliminary drug screening using urine or alternative materials in routine forensic autopsy, when a possible false-negative is considered, especially for benzodiazepines, providing objective information; however, the combined use of another device such as Monitect-9 can help minimize misinterpretation prior to instrumental analysis.", 
    "54": "The sudden interruption of the increase of the concentration of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), determines an increase in neuronal activity. GABA withdrawal (GW) is a heuristic analogy, with withdrawal symptoms developed by other GABA receptor-agonists such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and neurosteroids. GW comprises a model of neuronal excitability validated by electroencephalogram (EEG) in which high-frequency and high-amplitude spike-wave complexes appear. In brain slices, GW was identified by increased firing synchronization of pyramidal neurons and by changes in the active properties of the neuronal membrane. GW induces pre- and postsynaptic changes: a decrease in GABA synthesis/release, and the decrease in the expression and composition of GABAA receptors associated with increased calcium entry into the cell. GW is an excellent bioassay for studying partial epilepsy, epilepsy refractory to drug treatment, and a model to reverse or prevent the generation of abstinences from different drugs.", 
    "55": "This paper describes the development of an electrochemical assay based on screen-printed carbon sensors for the determination of clonazepam in serum and in wine. The cyclic voltammetric behaviour of the drug was investigated and the effects of pH and scan rate on the peak current and peak potential determined. Two reduction peaks were recorded on the initial negative going scan, which were considered to result from the 2e(-), 2 H(+) reduction of the 4,5-azomethine and from the 4e(-), 4 H(+) reduction of the 7-NO2 to a hydroxylamine. On the return positive going scan an oxidation peak was seen, which was considered to result from the 2e(-), 2 H(+) oxidation (O1) of the hydroxylamine to the corresponding nitroso species. At pH 11 the solution of clonazepam was found to turn from clear to yellow in colour and the voltammetric signal of the O1 oxidation process was found to be adsorptive in nature, this was exploited in the development of an adsorptive stripping voltammetric assay. Experimental conditions were then optimised for the differential pulse adsorptive voltammetric measurement of clonazepam in wine and serum samples. It was shown that these analyses could be performed on only 100\u00b5L of sample which was deposited on the sensor surface. Mean recoveries of 79.53% (%CV=9.88%) and 88.22% (%CV=14.1%) were calculated for wine fortified with 3.16\u00b5g/mL and serum fortified with 12.6\u00b5g/mL.",

We tested whether \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 trafficking and surface expression would be altered by in vitro exposure to flumazenil, a benzodiazepine ligand which reduces \u03b14\u03b2\u03b4 expression in vivo. We first determined that flumazenil (100 nM-100 \u03bcM, IC50=\u223c1 \u03bcM) acted as a negative modulator, reducing GABA (10 \u03bcM)-gated current in the presence of 100 nM THP (to increase receptor efficacy), assessed with whole cell patch clamp recordings of recombinant \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 expressed in HEK-293 cells. Surface expression of recombinant \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 receptors was detected using a 3XFLAG reporter at the C-terminus of \u03b14 (\u03b14F) using confocal immunocytochemical techniques following 48 h exposure of cells to GABA (10 \u03bcM)+THP (100 nM). Flumazenil (10 \u03bcM) decreased surface expression of \u03b14F by \u223c60%, while increasing its intracellular accumulation, after 48 h. Reduced surface expression of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 after flumazenil treatment was confirmed by decreases in the current responses to 100 nM of the GABA agonist gaboxadol. Flumazenil-induced decreases in surface expression of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 were prevented by the dynamin blocker, dynasore, and by leupeptin, which blocks lysosomal enzymes, suggesting that flumazenil is acting to increase endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of the receptor. Flumazenil increased the rate of receptor removal from the cell surface by 2-fold, assessed using botulinum toxin B to block insertion of new receptors. These findings may suggest new therapeutic strategies for regulation of \u03b14\u03b22\u03b4 expression using flumazenil.",

Akathisia was measured with the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS). Ongoing psychotropic treatment was recorded. The global prevalence of akathisia (as defined by a score of 2 or more on the global akathisia subscale of the BAS) in our sample was 18.5%. Patients who received antipsychotic polytherapy were at higher risk of akathisia and this result remained significant (adjusted odd ratio=2.04, p=.025) after controlling the influence of age, gender, level of education, level of psychotic symptoms, substance use comorbidities, current administration of antidepressant, anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines, and daily-administered antipsychotic dose. The combination of second-generation antipsychotics was associated with a 3-fold risk of akathisia compared to second-generation antipsychotics used in monotherapy.

    "81": "Binge-eating disorder is a common psychiatric disorder affecting ~2% of adults. Binge-eating was initiated in freely-fed, lean, adult, female rats by giving unpredictable, intermittent access to ground, milk chocolate over four weeks. The rats avidly consumed chocolate during 2 hr binge sessions, with compensatory reductions of normal chow intake in these sessions and the days thereafter. Bodyweights of binge-eating rats were normal. The model's predictive validity was explored using nalmefene (0.1-1.0mg/kg), R-baclofen (1.0-10mg/kg) and SB-334867 (3.0-30 mg/kg) (orexin-1 antagonist), which all selectively decreased chocolate bingeing without reducing chow intake. Sibutramine (0.3-5.0mg/kg) non-selectively reduced chocolate and chow consumption. Olanzapine (0.3-3.0mg/kg) was without effect and rolipram (1.0-10mg/kg) abolished all ingestive behaviour. The pro-drug, lisdexamfetamine (LDX; 0.1-1.5mg/kg), dose-dependently reduced chocolate bingeing by \u2a7d 71% without significantly decreasing normal chow intake. Its metabolite, D-amphetamine (0.1-1.0mg/kg), dose-dependently and preferentially decreased chocolate bingeing \u2a7d 56%.

    "82": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a serious neuropsychiatric disorder resulting from liver failure. Symptoms of HE include mild cognitive impairment, stupor and coma. Morphological changes to neuroglia (both astrocytes and microglia) occur in HE consisting of cytotoxic brain edema (astrocyte swelling) in acute liver failure and Alzheimer type-2 astrocytosis in cirrhosis. Visual-evoked responses in animals with liver failure and HE manifest striking similarities to those in animals treated with agonists of the GABA-A receptor complex. Neurosteroids are synthesized in brain following activation of translocator protein (TSPO), a mitochondrial neuroglial cholesterol-transporter protein. TSPO sites are activated in both animal models of HE as well as in autopsied brain tissue from HE patients. Activation of TSPO sites results in increased cholesterol transport into the mitochondrion followed by stimulation of a metabolic pathway culminating in the synthesis of allopregnanolone (ALLO) and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), neurosteroids with potent positive allosteric modulatory action on the GABA-A receptor complex. Concentrations of ALLO and THDOC in brain tissue from mice with HE resulting from toxic liver injury are sufficient to induce sedation in animals of the same species and significant increases in concentrations of ALLO have been reported in autopsied brain tissue from cirrhotic patients with HE leading to the proposal that \"increased GABAergic tone\" in HE results from that increased brain concentrations of this neurosteroid. Agents with the potential to decrease neurosteroid synthesis and/or prevent their modulatory actions on the GABA-A receptor complex may provide novel approaches to the management and treatment of HE. Such agents include indomethacin, benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists and a novel series of compounds known as GABA-A receptor-modulating steroid antagonists (GAMSA).",

Whilst investigations have found that early treatment has resulted in some alterations to dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission systems (essential to APD efficacy), there have only been limited studies into potential long-term behavioural changes. This study, using an animal model for childhood/adolescent APD treatment, investigated the long-term effects of aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone on adult behaviours of male and female rats. Open-field/holeboard, elevated plus maze (EPM), social interaction and forced swim (FS) tests were then conducted in adult rats. Our results indicated that in the male cohort, early risperidone and olanzapine treatment elicited long-term hyper-locomotor effects (open-field/holeboard and FS tests), whilst a decrease in depressive-like behaviour (in FS test) was observed in response to olanzapine treatment. Furthermore, anxiolytic-like behaviours were found following testing in the open-field/holeboard and EPM in response to all three drug treatments. Effects in the female cohort, however, were to a far lesser extent, with behavioural attributes indicative of an increased depressive-like behaviour and hypo-locomotor activity exhibited in the FS test following early risperidone and olanzapine treatment. These results suggest that various APDs have different long-term effects on the behaviours of adult rats.",

We conducted a systematic review to examine whether sedation of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) with dexmedetomidine was associated with a lower incidence of delirium as compared to other nondexmedetomidine sedation strategies. A search of PUBMED, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews yielded only three trials from 1966 through April 2015 that met our predefined inclusion criteria and assessed dexmedetomidine and outcomes of delirium as their primary endpoint. The studies varied in regard to population, comparator sedation regimen, delirium outcome measure, and dexmedetomidine dosing. All trials are limited by design issues that limit our ability definitively to conclude that dexmedetomidine prevents delirium. Evidence does suggest that dexmedetomidine may allow for avoidance of deep sedation and use of benzodiazepines, factors both observed to increase the risk for developing delirium. Our assessment of currently published literature highlights the need for ongoing research to better delineate the role of dexmedetomidine for delirium prevention.",

    "114": "High-frequency oscillations in the gamma-band reflect rhythmic synchronization of spike timing in active neural networks. The modulation of gamma oscillations is a widely established mechanism in a variety of neurobiological processes, yet its neurochemical basis is not fully understood. Modeling, in-vitro and in-vivo animal studies suggest that gamma oscillation properties depend on GABAergic inhibition. In humans, search for evidence linking total GABA concentration to gamma oscillations has led to promising -but also to partly diverging- observations. Here, we provide the first evidence of a direct relationship between the density of GABA(A) receptors and gamma oscillatory gamma responses in human primary visual cortex (V1). By combining Flumazenil-PET (to measure resting-levels of GABA(A) receptor density) and MEG (to measure visually-induced gamma oscillations), we found that GABA(A) receptor densities correlated positively with the frequency and negatively with amplitude of visually-induced gamma oscillations in V1. Our findings demonstrate that gamma-band response profiles of primary visual cortex across healthy individuals are shaped by GABA(A)-receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission. These results bridge the gap with in-vitro and animal studies and may have future clinical implications given that altered GABAergic function, including dysregulation of GABA(A) receptors, has been related to psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and depression.",

We synthesized a novel antipsychotic drug (PGW5) possessing an olanzapine moiety linked to sarcosine, a glycine transporter 1 inhibitor. In this study, we compared the metabolic effects of PGW5 and olanzapine in a female rat model of weight gain. Female rats were treated daily with oral olanzapine (4 mg/kg), PGW5 (25 mg/kg), or vehicle for 16 days. Behavioral tests were conducted on days 12-14. Biochemical analyses were performed at the end of the treatment. A significant increase in body weight was observed in the olanzapine-treated group, while the PGW5 group did not differ from the controls. The open field test showed hypo-locomotion in the olanzapine-treated animals as compared to PGW5 and control groups. A significant increase in hypothalamic protein expression of the neuropeptide Y5 receptor and a decrease in pro-opiomelanocortin messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels were detected following PGW5 treatment, but not after olanzapine administration. PGW5 appears to possess minor metabolic effects compared with the parent compound olanzapine. The differential modulation of brain peptides associated with appetite regulation is possibly involved in the attenuation of metabolic effects by PGW5.",

The independent variables were baseline cerebrovascular risk (Framingham Stroke Risk Score), baseline executive function (Stroop interference score and the initiation/perseveration subscale of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale), and baseline processing speed (color and word reading components of the Stroop). The outcome variable was change in severity of depression, measured by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score, during the course of the RCT.",

    "173": "The practice of sedation dosing strategy in mechanically ventilated patient has a profound effect on cognitive function. We conducted a comprehensive review of outcome of sedation on mental health function in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). We specifically evaluated current sedative dosing strategy and the development of delirium, post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSDs) and agitation. Based on this review, heavy dosing sedation strategy with benzodiazepines contributes to cognitive dysfunction. However, outcome for mental health dysfunction is mixed in regard to newer sedatives agents such as dexmedetomidine and propofol. Moreover, studies that examine the impact of sedatives for persistence of PTSD/delirium and its long-term cognitive and functional outcomes for post-ICU patients are frequently underpowered. Most studies suffer from low sample sizes and methodological variations. Therefore, larger randomized controlled trials are needed to properly assess the impact of sedation dosing strategy on cognitive function.", 
    "174": "The primary task of the lungs is to maintain oxygenation of the blood and eliminate carbon dioxide through the network of capillaries alongside alveoli. This is maintained by utilising ventilatory reserve capacity and by changes in lung mechanics. Induction of anaesthesia impairs pulmonary functions by the loss of consciousness, depression of reflexes, changes in rib cage and haemodynamics. All drugs used during anaesthesia, including inhalational agents, affect pulmonary functions directly by acting on respiratory system or indirectly through their actions on other systems. Volatile anaesthetic agents have more pronounced effects on pulmonary functions compared to intravenous induction agents, leading to hypercarbia and hypoxia. The posture of the patient also leads to major changes in pulmonary functions. Anticholinergics and neuromuscular blocking agents have little effect. Analgesics and sedatives in combination with volatile anaesthetics and induction agents may exacerbate their effects. Since multiple agents are used during anaesthesia, ultimate effect may be different from when used in isolation. Literature search was done using MeSH key words 'anesthesia', 'pulmonary function', 'respiratory system' and 'anesthesia drugs and lungs' in combination in PubMed, Science Direct and Google Scholar filtered by review and research articles sorted by relevance.",

Studies have demonstrated that a mean bioavailability (F) of more than 73% can be achieved with IN-administered midazolam. This is due to the high vascularity within the nose. These studies have also demonstrated that peak plasma concentrations can be reached within 10 minutes. This signifies a fast onset of action. The standard bolus dose of IN midazolam is 10mg; this bolus can be reduced or increased depending on the patient's age and susceptibility to benzodiazepines. The bolus can also be repeated if adequate sedation is not reached. A protocol for administering IN midazolam is outlined and two cases are discussed.",

Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate our data.", 
    "178": "In this sample, all participants had developed explanatory models for why they began using BZDs. We identified a multitude of reasons that we grouped into four broad categories, as explaining continued BZD use: (1) to cope with symptoms of psychological distress or mental disorder other than substance use, (2) to manage symptoms of physical or psychological discomfort associated with somatic disorder, (3) to alleviate symptoms of substance-related disorders, and (4) for recreational purposes, that is, sensation-seeking and other social reasons. Subjects often considered BZDs less dangerous than other substances and associated their use more often with harm reduction than as recreational. Specific obtainment strategies varied widely: the majority of participants oscillated between legal and illegal methods, often relying on the black market when faced with treatment termination.", 
    "179": "Irrespective of comorbidity, participants expressed a clear preference for medically related explanatory models for their BZD use. We therefore suggest that clinicians consider patients' motives for long-term, high-dose BZD use when formulating treatment plans for this patient group, especially since it is known that individuals are more compliant with approaches they perceive to be manageable, tolerable, and effective.",

The objectives of the study were to assess compliance with these guidelines in older patients hospitalized in psychiatric units and to identify characteristics associated with compliance. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 117 patients aged 65 years and older hospitalized in two psychiatric departments of a public hospital, at three dates randomly chosen between January and May 2014. Medical and sociodemographic characteristics were collected from electronic medical records. In all, 8% of psychotropic prescriptions were compliant with guidelines. A total of 98% of antidepressant prescriptions complied with guidelines for product selection (no tricyclics) and 72% for initial dosage (half of that recommended for younger adults). Regarding benzodiazepines, short half-life drugs were chosen in 73% of treatments, low maintenance dosage was found in 64% of treatments, and a discontinuous administration rhythm was noted in 33% of treatments. Regarding antipsychotics, initial dosage was a quarter of the allowed initial dosage for younger adults in 39% of prescriptions and metabolic blood testing was performed in 17% of prescriptions. Neurological and cognitive tolerance was monitored in 41% and 61% of prescriptions, respectively. Few clinical factors were found to be associated with compliance or noncompliance with guidelines in older psychiatric inpatients. Practice guidelines on psychotropic drug prescription were partially respected in older inpatients. Practitioners should take into account the risks associated with non-recommended patterns of psychotropic drug use in this vulnerable population.",

Large randomized trials cover only one treatment at early stage and suggest the superiority of benzodiazepines over placebo, of intravenous lorazepam over intravenous diazepam or over intravenous phenytoin alone, and of intramuscular midazolam over intravenous lorazepam. However, many patients will not be treated successfully with the first treatment step. A large randomized trial covering the treatment of established status (ESETT) has just been funded recently by the NIH and will not start before 2015, with expected results in 2018; a trial on the treatment of refractory status with general anesthetics was terminated early due to insufficient recruitment.

Presented here is a simple 2 by 2 way of classifying all of the most commonly used benzodiazepines. This conceptualization is based on the most clinically relevant ways of differentiating these drugs: (a) their affinity for their common and predominant mechanism of action, the benzodiazepine-binding site of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A iontropic receptor (ie, the chloride ion channel); and (b) their pharmacokinetics (ie, their half-lives and metabolism). The science underlying this conceptualization is presented and then its clinical applicability is discussed. This system can help clinicians select the most appropriate benzodiazepine for their patients and better understand how to switch between these medications to minimize withdrawal symptoms; it also provides a rational basis for cautiously using these agents in combination when necessary, in a manner analogous to the combined use of short-acting and long-acting forms of insulin.",

Changes in overdose trends, prescribing practices, antidotes, and dialysis techniques may alter the indications and rates of ECTR use over time. This study analyzed trends in ECTR for poisonings in four countries. A retrospective study of national poison center databases from the United States, Denmark, United Kingdom, and five regional databases within Canada was performed. All cases of patients receiving an ECTR were included. ECTR cases were totalled annually and reported as annual rates per 100,000 exposures with stratification per types of ECTR and toxins. The data collection varied by countries.

Across the United States and Denmark, HD was the preferred modality used. Toxins for which ECTR was most often used were: United States, ethylene glycol; Canada, methanol; United Kingdom, ethylene glycol; Denmark, salicylates. A high number of ECTRs were performed for atypical toxins such as acetaminophen and benzodiazepines.

    "206": "The 18-kDA translocator protein (TSPO) is consistently elevated in activated microglia of the central nervous system (CNS) in response to a variety of insults as well as neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. It is therefore a target of interest for molecular strategies aimed at imaging neuroinflammation in vivo. For more than 20 years, positron emission tomography (PET) has allowed the imaging of TSPO density in brain using [(11)C]-(R)-PK11195, a radiolabelled-specific antagonist of the TSPO that has demonstrated microglial activation in a large number pathological cohorts. The significant clinical interest in brain immunity as a primary or comorbid factor in illness has sparked great interest in the TSPO as a biomarker and a surprising number of second generation TSPO radiotracers have been developed aimed at improving the quality of TSPO imaging through novel radioligands with higher affinity. However, such major investment has not yet resulted in the expected improvement in image quality. We here review the main methodological aspects of TSPO PET imaging with particular attention to TSPO genetics, cellular heterogeneity of TSPO in brain tissue and TSPO distribution in blood and plasma that need to be considered in the quantification of PET data to avoid spurious results as well as ineffective development and use of these radiotracers.",

Extensive pharmacological, biochemical and cell biological research over the years has led to a model of TSPO involvement in mitochondrial cholesterol transport and promotion of steroid synthesis, a model guiding the design of drugs useful in stimulating neurosteroid synthesis and alleviating psychopathological symptoms. The involvement of TSPO in these processes has been called into question; however, with the publication of TSPO-deletion mouse models which saw no changes in steroid production.

(2014) Science 343: , 1363-1366], providing for the first time atomic-level insight into the conformation of this protein, which is up-regulated in various pathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Here, we review the studies which have probed the structural properties of mammalian TSPO/PBR as well as the homologues bacterial tryptophan-rich sensory proteins (TspOs) over the years and provide detailed insight into the 3D structure of mouse TSPO (mTSPO)/PBR in complex with PK11195.",

Many functions have been attributed to TSPO/PBR including a role in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP), steroidogenesis and energy metabolism. In this review, we detail the recent developments in determining the physiological role of TSPO/PBR, specifically based on data obtained from the recently generated Tspo knockout mouse models. In addition to defining the role of TSPO/PBR, we also describe the value of Tspo knockout mice in determining the selectivity, specificity and presence of any off-target effects of TSPO/PBR ligands.", 
    "210": "The mitochondrial 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) was originally discovered as a peripheral binding site of benzodiazepines to be later described as a core element of cholesterol trafficking between cytosol and mitochondria from which the current nomenclature originated. The high affinity it exhibits with chemicals (i.e. PK11195) has generated interest in the development of mitochondrial based TSPO-binding drugs for in vitro and in vivo analysis. Increased TSPO expression is observed in numerous pathologies such as cancer and inflammatory conditions of the central nervous system (CNS) that have been successfully exploited via protocols of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We endeavoured to dissect the molecular role of TSPO in mitochondrial cell biology and discovered a functional link with quality control mechanisms operated by selective autophagy. This review focuses on the current understanding of this pathway and focuses on the interplay with reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), to which TSPO binds, in the regulation of cell mitophagy and hence homoeostasis of the mitochondrial network as a whole.", 
    "211": "At least 120 non-olfactory G-protein-coupled receptors in the human genome are 'orphans' for which endogenous ligands are unknown, and many have no selective ligands, hindering the determination of their biological functions and clinical relevance. Among these is GPR68, a proton receptor that lacks small molecule modulators for probing its biology. Using yeast-based screens against GPR68, here we identify the benzodiazepine drug lorazepam as a non-selective GPR68 positive allosteric modulator. More than 3,000 GPR68 homology models were refined to recognize lorazepam in a putative allosteric site. Docking 3.1 million molecules predicted new GPR68 modulators, many of which were confirmed in functional assays. One potent GPR68 modulator, ogerin, suppressed recall in fear conditioning in wild-type but not in GPR68-knockout mice. The same approach led to the discovery of allosteric agonists and negative allosteric modulators for GPR65. Combining physical and structure-based screening may be broadly useful for ligand discovery for understudied and orphan GPCRs.",

Serum aliquots (100\u03bcL) and internal standard (olanzapine-d3, 25\u03bcL) were pipetted onto an Ostro(TM) 96-well filtration plate and protein precipitated with acidic acetonitrile (300\u03bcL) before removal of endogenous phospholipids by filtration followed by analysis. Chromatography was achieved using an HSST 3 (2.1\u00d7100mm, 1.8\u03bcm) column and gradient elution with acidic water in combination with methanol at a flow rate of 0.5mL/min. The runtime was 1.5min. The mass spectrometer was monitored in positive mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The m/z 313.1>256.1 and 313.1>198.0 transitions were monitored for olanzapine (m/z 316.1>256.1 for olanzapine-d3). The quadratic calibration curves ranged from 5 to 500nM (R(2)\u22650.999). Limit of quantification was 0.5nM (CV 9.6%, accuracy 110%). Within-assay and between-assay inaccuracies were 2.6-11.9% (CV\u22644.8%). Recovery was 84-95% (CV\u22641.4%) and matrix effects ranged from 100 to 103% (CV\u22642.6%). Extensive stability testing showed that at ambient temperature, olanzapine in patient serum samples were stable for at least seven hours on the laboratory bench and for at least 48h in darkness. When exposed to 3000lux, however, significant degradation had occurred after 48h. Notably, olanzapine in spiked serum was unstable already after four hours when exposed to 3000 lux. At 4-8\u00b0C and exposure to 550lux, both patient serum and spiked serum were stable for more than 48h but less than a week, whereas in darkness, the samples were stable for at least 14 days. The cumulative light exposure causing significant degradation of olanzapine in patient serum was 50,000-100,000lux-h. In some individual samples, however, the effect of light exposure was more pronounced. Therefore, it seems pertinent to recommend protecting all samples from light, although we found no indication that a few hours of exposure to standard indoor illumination will affect the olanzapine concentration to any significant degree.", 
    "222": "Febrile seizures are the most common type of convulsive events in children. It is generally assumed that the generalization of these seizures is a result of brainstem invasion by the initial limbic seizure activity. Using precollicular transection in 13-day-old rats to isolate the forebrain from the brainstem, we demonstrate that the forebrain is not required for generation of tonic-clonic convulsions induced by hyperthermia or kainate. Compared with sham-operated littermate controls, latency to onset of convulsions in both models was significantly shorter in pups that had undergone precollicular transection, indicating suppression of the brainstem seizure network by the forebrain in the intact animal. We have shown previously that febrile seizures are precipitated by hyperthermia-induced respiratory alkalosis. Here, we show that triggering of hyperthermia-induced hyperventilation and consequent convulsions in transected animals are blocked by diazepam. The present data suggest that the role of endogenous brainstem activity in triggering tonic-clonic seizures should be re-evaluated in standard experimental models of limbic seizures. Our work sheds new light on the mechanisms that generate febrile seizures in children and, therefore, on how they might be treated.",

    "235": "Translocator protein (18 kDa), formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), has been extensively used as a biomarker of active brain disease and neuroinflammation. TSPO expression increases dramatically in glial cells, particularly in microglia and astrocytes, as a result of brain injury, and this phenomenon is a component of the hallmark response of the brain to injury. In this study, we used a mouse model of Sandhoff disease (SD) to assess the longitudinal expression of TSPO as a function of disease progression and its relationship to behavioral and neuropathological endpoints. Focusing on the presymptomatic period of the disease, we used ex vivo [(3)H]DPA-713 quantitative autoradiography and in vivo [(125)I]IodoDPA-713 small animal SPECT imaging to show that brain TSPO levels markedly increase prior to physical and behavioral manifestation of disease. We further show that TSPO upregulation coincides with early neuronal GM2 ganglioside aggregation and is associated with ongoing neurodegeneration and activation of both microglia and astrocytes. In brain regions with increased TSPO levels, there is a differential pattern of glial cell activation with astrocytes being activated earlier than microglia during the progression of disease. Immunofluorescent confocal imaging confirmed that TSPO colocalizes with both microglia and astrocyte markers, but the glial source of the TSPO response differs by brain region and age in SD mice. Notably, TSPO colocalization with the astrocyte marker GFAP was greater than with the microglia marker, Mac-1. Taken together, our findings have significant implications for understanding TSPO glial cell biology and for detecting neurodegeneration prior to clinical expression of disease.",

However, there is no explicit understanding of what is meant by long-term BZD use in real world. The aim of this study was to assess different definitions, usage patterns, prevalence and other characteristics of long-term BZD use based on published register-based studies.

The relative proportion of long-term BZD users (all definitions) in adult BZD users ranged from 6% to 76% (mean 24%; 95% CL 13-36%). The estimates were higher in studies only on the elderly (47%; 95% CL 31-64%). Long-term use involved typically steady treatment with low BZD doses. However, in elderly patients long-term BZD use and exceeding recommended doses was relatively common. Several characteristics associated with long-term use were found.",

    "244": "Dexmedetomidine, an \u03b12 agonist, has demonstrated its effectiveness as a sedative during awake intubation, but its utility in fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is not clear. We evaluated the effects of midazolam and dexmedetomidine on patient's response to FOB. The patients received either midazolam, 0.02\u2009mg/kg (group M, n=27), or dexmedetomidine, 1\u2009\u00b5g/kg (group D, n=27). A composite score of five different parameters and a numerical rating scale (NRS) for pain intensity and distress were used to assess patient response during FOB. Patients rated the quality of sedation and level of discomfort 24\u2009h after the procedure. Ease of bronchoscopy, rescue medication requirement, and haemodynamic variables were noted. Ideal or acceptable composite score was observed in 15 and 26 patients, respectively, in group M (14.48\u00b13.65) and group D (9.41\u00b13.13), p<0.001. NRS showed that 11 patients in group M had severe pain and discomfort as compared to one patient with severe pain and two with severe discomfort in group D during the procedure, p<0.001. Rescue midazolam requirement was significantly higher in group M (p=0.023). We conclude that during FOB, under topical airway anaesthesia, IV dexmedetomidine (1\u2009\u00b5g/kg) provides superior patient comfort and tolerance as compared to IV midazolam (0.02\u2009mg/kg).", 
    "245": "Olanzapine (OLZ) is an atypical antipsychotic drug that also has mood-stabilizing effects. The mechanism of action of OLZ is not fully understood. Accumulating data suggest that inflammation plays a role in the pathophysiology of mental disorders and that psychotropic drugs exhibit some anti-inflammatory properties. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of OLZ on LPS-induced inflammation in rat primary glia cells. Glia cells were extracted from newborn rat brains. OLZ (1 or 50\u2009\u00b5M) was added to culture medium at 6 or 72\u2009h before addition of LPS for another 18\u2009h, and levels of IL-10, prostaglandin (PG) E2, NO and TNF-\u03b1, and expression of cyclo-oxygensase (COX)-2 and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) were determined. Treatment with 50\u2009\u00b5M OLZ (but not 1\u2009\u00b5M) significantly decreased LPS-induced secretion of IL-10, PGE2 and TNF-\u03b1. In contrast, 50\u2009\u00b5M OLZ significantly increased NO levels. OLZ did not alter the expression of COX-2 or iNOS in LPS-treated cells. These results suggest that OLZ differently affects the secretion of inflammatory mediators. Most of the significant effects of OLZ were obtained when 50\u2009\u00b5M was used, which is a high and probably therapeutically irrelevant concentration. Therefore, under the conditions used in the present study OLZ seemed to lack a potent anti-inflammatory effect.",

Unfortunately, medications traditionally used for sedation in the intensive care unit (ICU) such as benzodiazepines and propofol are associated with significant unwanted effects.

Our primary outcome is the duration of mechanical ventilation. Secondary outcomes include the following, listed by priority: duration of sedation infusions, dose of sedation used, level of sedation, incidence of withdrawal from other sedatives, delirium incidence, ICU and hospital length of stay, use and duration of non-invasive ventilation, and all-cause ICU and hospital mortality.
