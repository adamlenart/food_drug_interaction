In this study, diazepam is compared with midazolam in 25 subacute sclerosing panencephalitis-diagnosed children and 10 children with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis-suggesting symptoms, normal EEG findings and no certain diagnosis. Neither midazolam nor diazepam affected typical periodic slow-wave complexes. However, in the patients with atypical EEG abnormalities, midazolam, like diazepam, attenuated sharp or sharp-and-slow waves, and therefore made the identification of periodic slow-wave paroxysms easier. In the patients with normal EEGs, both midazolam and diazepam revealed typical periodic complexes on EEG recording in the same 3 patients. Cerebrospinal fluid examination verified the diagnosis of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. The findings suggest that midazolam or diazepam administration increases the contribution of EEG recording in atypical cases with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.", 
    "1": "Aside from their pharmacokinetic properties, e.g. their speed of action and the duration of residual effects, benzodiazepines are still considered as equivalent in terms of their effects on cognition. Here we review evidence suggesting that certain benzodiazepines, especially lorazepam, differ in a number of respects, in particular with respect to their effects on cognition. We focus this review on memory, attention and visual perception, where impairments may be brought about by only a subset of benzodiazepines in spite of their administration at doses inducing similar sedative effects. This precludes an explanation in terms of sedation. Differences in the effects of benzodiazepines have also been found in electrophysiological and animal behavioural studies. These studies are important for therapeutic approaches for two reasons: first, effects of benzodiazepine prescription on cognitive functions will differ according to the benzodiazepine, contrary to what is usually believed. Less straightforwardly are the possible therapeutic implications of specific effects on cognition following treatment with lorazepam. Indeed, the specific effects this drug has on cognition may reveal not only side-effects but also effects of potential therapeutic value. Current research concentrates on a fine scale analysis of the effects of GABA on different sub-types of GABA(A) receptors. We suggest that from looking at what makes lorazepam different in a behavioural sense from other benzodiazepines we may be in a position to design innovative treatments for major aspects of complex disorders, including schizophrenia.", 
    "2": "Delphinium nordhagenii belongs to family Ranunculaceae, it is widely found in tropical areas of Pakistan. Other species of Delphinium are reported as anticonvulsant and are traditionally used in the treatment of epilepsy. Delphinium nordhagenii is used by local healer in Pakistan but never used for scientific investigation as anticonvulsant. Thus, Delphinium nordhagenii was subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation and the most active fraction, i.e. DNS II acetone was chosen for further testing in the acute seizure models of epilepsy to study the antiepileptic potential in male mice.", 
    "3": "Different doses (60, 65 and 70mg/kg, i.p.) of DNS II acetone fraction of Delphinium nordhagenii was administered 30min prior the chemoconvulsant's injection in the male mice. Convulsive doses of chemoconvulsants (pentylenetetrazole 90mg/kg, s.c. and picrotoxin 3.15mg/kg, s.c.) were used. The mice were observed 45-90min for the presence of seizures. Moreover, four different doses of DNS II (60, 65, 70 and 100mg/kg, i.p.) were tested in the MES test.", 
    "4": "The DNS II acetone fraction of Delphinium nordhagenii has exhibited the anticonvulsant actions by preventing the seizures against PTZ- and picrotoxin-induced seizure as well as 100% seizure protection in MES test. The results are comparable with standard AEDs (diazepam 7.5mg/kg, i.p. and phenytoin 20mg/kg, i.p.).", 
    "5": "These findings suggest that the Delphinium nordhagenii possesses the anticonvulsant activity. Further analysis is needed to confirm the structure and target the extended activity profile.", 
    "6": "The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate the prognostic value of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification with regard to perioperative variables of cardiac complications, pulmonary complications, and mortality in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures with monitored intravenous sedation and foot and ankle blocks. None of the ASA 3 or 4 patients experienced any pulmonary or cardiac complication; no patient required invasive monitoring or postoperative cardiac care unit admission. We suggest that the performance of peripheral foot and ankle blocks with monitored intravenous sedation appears to be a safe and useful option for ASA 3 and 4 patients undergoing limb-preservation surgery.", 
    "7": "The scototaxis (dark/light preference) protocol is a behavioral model for fish that is being validated to assess the antianxiety effects of pharmacological agents and the behavioral effects of toxic substances, and to investigate the (epi)genetic bases of anxiety-related behavior. Briefly, a fish is placed in a central compartment of a half-black, half-white tank; following habituation, the fish is allowed to explore the tank for 15 min; the number and duration of entries in each compartment (white or black) are recorded by the observer for the whole session. Zebrafish, goldfish, guppies and tilapias (all species that are important in behavioral neurosciences and neuroethology) have been shown to demonstrate a marked preference for the dark compartment. An increase in white compartment activity (duration and/or entries) should reflect antianxiety behavior, whereas an increase in dark compartment activity should reflect anxiety-promoting behavior. When individual animals are exposed to the apparatus on only one occasion, results can be obtained in 20 min per fish.", 
    "8": "Atypical antipsychotic medications like olanzapine (OLZ) induce weight gain and increase the risk of diabetes in patients with schizophrenia. The goal of this study was to assess potential mechanisms of OLZ-induced weight gain and accompanying metabolic effects. Healthy, lean, male volunteers received OLZ and placebo (PBO) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. In periods 1 and 2, subjects received OLZ (5 mg for 3 days then OLZ 10 mg for 12 days) or matching PBO separated by a minimum 12-day washout. Twenty-four hour food intake (FI), resting energy expenditure (REE), activity level, metabolic markers, and insulin sensitivity (IS) were assessed. In total, 30 subjects were enrolled and 21 completed both periods. Mean age and BMI were 27 years (range: 18-49 years) and 22.6 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2), respectively. Relative to PBO, OLZ resulted in a 2.62 vs. 0.08 kg increase in body weight (P < 0.001) and 18% (P = 0.052 or 345 kcal) increase in FI. Excluding one subject with nausea and dizziness on the day of OLZ FI measurement, the increase in FI was 547 kcal, (P < 0.05). OLZ increased REE relative to PBO (113 kcal/day, P = 0.003). Significant increases in triglycerides, plasminogen activator inhibitor-I (PAI-I), leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were observed. No significant differences in activity level or IS were observed. This study provides evidence that OLZ pharmacology drives the early increase in weight through increased FI, without evidence of decreased energy expenditure (EE), activity level, or short-term perturbations in IS.", 
    "9": "Normal lower urinary tract function consists of voiding and storage. During voiding, the pontine micturition reflex center orders the sacral parasympathetic nucleus to increase parasympathetic activity, resulting in urinary bladder detrusor contraction via activation of post-synaptic muscarinic receptors (M2/3) and in the relaxation of both urethral and prostatic smooth muscle by nitric oxide (NO). In addition, the rhabdosphincter relaxes by inhibition of the pudendal nucleus at the sacral portion. During the storage phase, increase in sympathetic activity relaxes the urinary bladder via activation of post-synaptic beta(3)-receptors and in the contraction of both urethral and prostatic smooth muscles via alpha(1)-adrenoceptor. Many factors influence voiding function, including lower urinary tract disorders (benign prostatic hyperplasia in males, urethral stricture) and neurological disorders (central and peripheral). Theories of pharmacotherapy for voiding dysfunction are 1) increase detrusor contractility and 2) decrease urethral resistance. The former includes agonists for muscarinic receptors and cholinesterase inhibitor; and the latter includes alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists, NO donors, benzodiazepines, baclofen, dantrolene, and boturinum toxin.", 
    "10": "Because GABA(A) receptors containing alpha2 subunits are highly represented in areas of the brain, such as nucleus accumbens (NAcc), frontal cortex, and amygdala, regions intimately involved in signaling motivation and reward, we hypothesized that manipulations of this receptor subtype would influence processing of rewards. Voltage-clamp recordings from NAcc medium spiny neurons of mice with alpha2 gene deletion showed reduced synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses. Behaviorally, the deletion abolished cocaine's ability to potentiate behaviors conditioned to rewards (conditioned reinforcement), and to support behavioral sensitization. In mice with a point mutation in the benzodiazepine binding pocket of alpha2-GABA(A) receptors (alpha2H101R), GABAergic neurotransmission in medium spiny neurons was identical to that of WT (i.e., the mutation was silent), but importantly, receptor function was now facilitated by the atypical benzodiazepine Ro 15-4513 (ethyl 8-amido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5-a] [1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate). In alpha2H101R, but not WT mice, Ro 15-4513 administered directly into the NAcc-stimulated locomotor activity, and when given systemically and repeatedly, induced behavioral sensitization. These data indicate that activation of alpha2-GABA(A) receptors (most likely in NAcc) is both necessary and sufficient for behavioral sensitization. Consistent with a role of these receptors in addiction, we found specific markers and haplotypes of the GABRA2 gene to be associated with human cocaine addiction.", 
    "11": "By employing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in combination with high-density electroencephalography (EEG), we recently reported that cortical effective connectivity is disrupted during early non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. This is a time when subjects, if awakened, may report little or no conscious content. We hypothesized that a similar breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may underlie loss of consciousness (LOC) induced by pharmacologic agents. Here, we tested this hypothesis by comparing EEG responses to TMS during wakefulness and LOC induced by the benzodiazepine midazolam. Unlike spontaneous sleep states, a subject's level of vigilance can be monitored repeatedly during pharmacological LOC. We found that, unlike during wakefulness, wherein TMS triggered responses in multiple cortical areas lasting for >300 ms, during midazolam-induced LOC, TMS-evoked activity was local and of shorter duration. Furthermore, a measure of the propagation of evoked cortical currents (significant current scattering, SCS) could reliably discriminate between consciousness and LOC. These results resemble those observed in early NREM sleep and suggest that a breakdown of cortical effective connectivity may be a common feature of conditions characterized by LOC. Moreover, these results suggest that it might be possible to use TMS-EEG to assess consciousness during anesthesia and in pathological conditions, such as coma, vegetative state, and minimally conscious state.", 
    "12": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest family of transmembrane signaling proteins in the human genome. Events in the GPCR signaling cascade have been well characterized, but the receptor composition and its membrane distribution are still generally unknown. Although there is evidence that some members of the GPCR superfamily exist as constitutive dimers or higher oligomers, interpretation of the results has been disputed, and recent studies indicate that monomeric GPCRs may also be functional. Because there is controversy within the field, to address the issue we have used total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) in living cells to visualize thousands of individual molecules of a model GPCR, the M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. By tracking the position of individual receptors over time, their mobility, clustering, and dimerization kinetics could be directly determined with a resolution of approximately 30 ms and approximately 20 nm. In isolated CHO cells, receptors are randomly distributed over the plasma membrane. At any given time, approximately 30% of the receptor molecules exist as dimers, and we found no evidence for higher oligomers. Two-color TIRFM established the dynamic nature of dimer formation with M(1) receptors undergoing interconversion between monomers and dimers on the timescale of seconds.", 
    "13": "A 13-year-old girl with a known diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus presented with seizures and psychosis. An electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed continuous, non-evolving periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges (PLEDs) in the left temporal region, which did not resolve with benzodiazepine. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan demonstrated a focal hyperintensity in the left medial temporal and left occipital lobes, left thalamus and bilateral cerebellar white matter, with evidence of vasculitis in the magnetic resonance angiography. Intravenous immunoglobulin was given because of failed steroid therapy, which resulted in a full resolution of clinical, EEG and MRI abnormalities. Lupus cerebritis should be considered as a possible aetiology in PLEDs, and immunoglobulin can be effective in neuropsychiatric lupus.", 
    "14": "Using a decision-making and treatment checklist developed to facilitate the at-home palliative sedation process, we assessed the incidence and efficacy of palliative sedation for end-of-life cancer patients with intractable symptoms who died at home. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 370 patients who were followed by a palliative home care team. Twenty-nine of 245 patients (12%) who died at home had received palliative sedation. The mean age of the patients who received palliative sedation was 58 +/- 17 years, and the mean age of the patients who did not receive palliative sedation was 69 +/- 15 years (p = 0.002). No other differences were detected between patients who did or did not receive palliative sedation. The most common indications for palliative sedation were delirium (62%) and dyspnea (14%). Twenty-seven patients (93%) received midazolam for palliative sedation (final mean dose of 74 mg), and two (7%) received levomepromazine (final mean dose of 125 mg). The mean time between palliative sedation initiation and time of death was 2.6 days. In 13 of the cases (45%), the palliative sedation decision was made with the patient and his or her family members, and in another 13 patients (45%), the palliative sedation decision was made only with the patient's family members. We concluded that palliative sedation may be used safely and efficaciously to treat dying cancer patients with refractory symptoms at home.", 
    "15": "Negative myoclonus (NM) is a sudden brief atonia in muscle that causes jerky lapses of posture. This study employed an electrophysiological technique (silent-period-locked-averaging (SPLA) electroencephalography (EEG)) and a pharmacodynamic imaging technique (123I-IMZ-SPECT) to examine epileptic NM (ENM). Delayed-phase 123I-IMZ-SPECT images, which reflect the specific binding of the tracers to GABA-A receptors, exhibited significant decrease in the left medial frontal area. The deficit in GABA-A receptors indicated that abnormal synchronization was mediated by the lack of inhibitory postsynaptic mechanism. The SPLA-EEG recorded spike-like notches superimposed on the slope of negative slow activity in the contralateral fronto-central region. The slow activity started around 100 ms before and the peak of the spike-like component was 30 ms before the onset of ENM. Since the 123I-IMZ-SPECT shows the actual distribution of the tracers, the abnormal area associated with ENM in this particular patient was supposed to be on the left medial frontal lobe. Scalp EEG, though it cannot always accurately locate the abnormal area, was highly sensitive to be able to detect electrical activities transmitted through neuronal network or volume conductor. Combined use of the two methods provided high resolution both in spatial and temporal domain.",

He was admitted to the hospital suffering from a withdrawal delirium accompanied by hallucinations and agitation. Use of GHB is increasing in the Netherlands. Along with serious intoxication and dependency, the possibility of withdrawal symptoms should also be taken into consideration. Administration of high doses of benzodiazepines is an effective treatment for these withdrawal symptoms.",

    "20": "Energy expenditure for resting state maintenance upon calcium withdrawal depends on the intracellular rise in both sodium and calcium. Our data are consistent with a mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycling, not detectable under normal calcium diastolic levels. The experimental condition here analysed, partially simulates findings reported under certain pathological situations including heart failure in which mildly increased levels of both diastolic sodium and calcium have also been found. Therefore, under such pathological conditions, hearts should distract chemical energy to fuel processes associated with sodium and calcium handling, making more expensive the maintenance of their functions.",

This review examines the epidemiology of BZD use by opioid users, and the range of harms that are associated with BZD use in this group, including the association of BZD use with opioid-related mortality. Preclinical and clinical data regarding pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between methadone, buprenorphine, and BZDs are reviewed. An overview of treatment approaches for managing BZD use in this population is presented, including strategies for minimizing abuse and addressing BZD dependence.", 
    "22": "Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) encompasses a group of disorders that include obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), central sleep apnoea (CSA) and nocturnal hypoventilation. SDB commonly coexists with sleep disorders such as insomnia and restless legs syndrome, and sleep deprivation has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of SDB. Participants of a workshop, held at the 6th annual meeting of The International Sleep Disorders Forum: The Art of Good Sleep in 2008, evaluated whether the effective management of sleep disorders could result in a reduction in SDB. Following the workshop, a critical review of the literature in the field of sleep and SDB was conducted in order to assess the impact of improving sleep on SDB, and to determine whether measures taken to improve sleep result in a subsequent improvement in SDB. Results showed that studies evaluating the influence of improved sleep on respiratory abnormalities in patients with SDB are lacking. Studies in patients with OSA, with or without obesity-hypoventilation syndrome, show that therapy with continuous positive airways pressure and non-invasive ventilation improves sleep parameters with beneficial effects on SDB. Studies involving small numbers of patients have shown that the antidepressants fluoxetine and mirtazapine produce improvements in sleep parameters and the apnoea-hypopnoea index, and that acetazolamide may improve CSA. The benzodiazepines flurazepam, temazepam and nitrazepam, the hypnotic zolpidem, the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon and gamma-hydroxybutyrate have all been shown to improve sleep, but are not associated with reductions or worsening in SDB. It is clear that there is a distinct knowledge gap with regard to the benefit of improving sleep disturbances for subsequent improvements in SDB. Randomized controlled clinical trials investigating the effect of pharmacological and non-pharmacological improvement of sleep disorders focusing on whether there is improvement in coexisting OSA/SDB are clearly needed. Furthermore, well-designed clinical trials investigating the role of hypnotic agents in improving SDB in certain phenotypes will enable the development of treatment recommendations for primary care physicians managing these patients in routine clinical practice.",

Precipitating factors are just as varied and range from infections, dehydration, and surgical intervention to alcohol and drug withdrawal. Anticholinergic and/or dopaminergic substances may also trigger deliria. This review presents medical treatment options for delirium from current literature and points out substances, which may potentially cause deliria.",

The mean intraoperative dose of fentanyl was lower in the intracameral than in the control group (p < 0.0001). A comparison of intraoperative fentanyl requirements between groups using a multivariate regression analysis for age, gender, surgical time, and preoperative fentanyl levels confirmed the lower need for intraoperative fentanyl in the intracameral compared with the control group (p = 0.0037).

Five patients (6%) had a postoperative hemispheric increase in (123)I-IMZ uptake, and cognitive function improved in all of these 5 patients. Analysis by a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to estimate the ability to discriminate between patients with and without postoperative cognitive improvement. The area under the ROC curve was significantly greater when analyzing the magnitude of postoperative resolution of CCH (0.991; 95% CI 0.984-1.001) or postoperative hemispheric increase in (123)I-IMZ uptake (0.981; 95% CI 0.972-0.999) when compared with the magnitude of postoperative increase in cerebral blood flow (0.929; 95% CI 0.886-0.971) (p < 0.05).",

In twelve health care practices in Denmark a few simple rules to reduce the consumption were established. Telephone recipes were abolished, and prescriptions were issued for only a single month's usage and only following personal consultation. These rules are generally in accordance with recommendations applicable in, for example, England, Norway and Denmark. After 15 months, consumption was roughly halved. There is a general lack of knowledge about whether an intervention as described above leads to a substitution with other medicines. Here, especially antidepressants are in the spotlight.",

Acute dystonia restless legs syndrome (RLS) and manic syndromes are adverse effects of mirtazapine, whereas only few cases of acute akathisia, after the first doses of mirtazapine, are referred.

The total cellular RNA was extracted and the cDNA was synthesized. This process was followed by real-time PCR using primer pairs specific for 5HT(3a) serotonin receptor mRNA and beta-actin as internal control. The results showed the presence of subtype of serotonin receptor in lymphocytes. Serotonin gene expression showed significant changes in Olanzapine treatment group which correlated with Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score improvement. In conclusion, the present study has shown that human PBMC express serotonin receptors 5HT(3a). Moreover, clinical symptom improvement of Olanzapin may be demonstrated by a change in serotonin receptor gene expression.",

Sixteen B6SJLF1/J mice were trained to discriminate 10 min of exposure to 12,000-ppm inhaled TCE vapor from air. Substitution and antagonism tests and TCE blood concentration analysis were subsequently conducted. TCE blood concentrations decreased rapidly after cessation of exposure, falling by 66% within 5 min. TCE vapor concentration-dependently substituted for the 12,000-ppm training stimulus. The volatile anesthetic halothane concentration-dependently and fully substituted for TCE. The benzodiazepine midazolam partially substituted for TCE, producing a maximum of 68% TCE-lever selection. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil attenuated midazolam substitution for TCE, but not the discriminative stimulus effects of TCE itself. The noncompetitive NDMA receptor antagonists phencyclidine and dizocilpine failed to substitute for TCE. Nicotine and the central nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine also failed to produce any TCE-lever selection, nor did they antagonize the discriminative stimulus of TCE. The mu-opioid receptor agonist morphine did not substitute for TCE. The opioid antagonist naltrexone failed to antagonize the discriminative stimulus of TCE. Overall, the present results, combined with previous studies, suggest that the discriminative stimulus effects of TCE are mediated primarily by positive GABAA receptor modulatory effects though a mechanism distinct from the benzodiazepine binding site.",

The addition of medetomidine, but not midazolam, provided muscle relaxation and abolishment of reflexes that was superior to ketamine alone. In addition, medetomidine did not cause clinically relevant effects on cardiovascular and respiratory parameters when compared with ketamine. These 3 protocols did not have significantly different effects on fecal glucocorticoid metabolites. These results suggest that medetomidine can be a valuable addition to ketamine for healthy patients, whereas oral midazolam at the tested dose does not provide additional benefits.", 
    "49": "A study of Section 4 RTOA cases submitted to the SPSA forensic science laboratory in Edinburgh over a 12 year period was carried out. The main aims of the study were to identify the most frequently encountered drugs and to determine if there were any major drugs trends from the data collected. Three groups of cases from 1996 to 2000 (102 cases), 2003 (26 cases) and 2008 (295 cases) were examined. The large increase in submissions was mainly due to the introduction of SPSA, whereby the laboratory began to carry out the analysis for all criminal and RTOA cases in Scotland. The preliminary results for the 8 drug groups (amphetamine and related compounds, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, methadone, methylamphetamine and related compounds, morphine and opiates) identified a number of major trends: cannabinoids were consistently present in 40-50% of cases; benzodiazepines more than doubled in frequency to over 80%; there has been a significant increase in cases positive for morphine and methadone--up from less than 2% each to 31% and 23% respectively; there has been an increase in the number of cases screening positive for opiates (19% to 29%); and the frequency of positive cases for cocaine, amphetamine and methylamphetamine remained unchanged (approximately 22%, 6% and 5% respectively). A significant finding was the huge increase in polydrug use. The number of cases positive for 4 or more drug groups has increased from 4% in 1996-2000 to 25% in 2008. In comparison, in the 1996-2000 group 72% of cases were only positive for one drug group compared to 17% in 2008. For those cases which were negative for all 8 drug groups, a screen for potentially impairing prescription and over the counter medicines was carried out. The most frequently encountered medicines were sedatives, sedative antidepressants, sedative antihistamines and antiemetics. These were often found in conjunction with alcohol below the legal limit for driving.",

    "51": "Therapeutic use, overuse, abuse, and diversion of controlled substances in managing chronic non-cancer pain continues to be an issue for physicians and patients. It has been stated that physicians, along with the public and federal, state, and local government; professional associations; and pharmaceutical companies all share responsibility for preventing abuse of controlled prescription drugs. The challenge is to eliminate or significantly curtail abuse of controlled prescription drugs while still assuring the proper treatment of those patients. A number of techniques, instruments, and tools have been described to monitor controlled substance use and abuse. Thus, multiple techniques and tools available for adherence monitoring include urine drug testing in conjunction with prescription monitoring programs and other screening tests. However, urine drug testing is associated with multiple methodological flaws. Multiple authors have provided conflicting results in relation to diagnostic accuracy with differing opinions about how to monitor adherence in a non-systematic fashion. Thus far, there have not been any studies systematically assessing the diagnostic accuracy of immunoassay with laboratory testing.",

This benzodiazepine was chosen because it forms one major metabolite, 7-aminoclonazepam which is specific for that drug. Patients whose only benzodiazepine medication was clonazepam were selected as the test population. The Millennium Laboratories test database was filtered first to select patients on clonazepam, then a second filter was used to eliminate patients with any other listed benzodiazepine medications. Samples were tested using the Microgenics DRI benzodiazepine assay with a 200 ng/mL cutoff. The same samples were quantitatively assessed for 7-aminoclonazepam by LC-MS/MS with a cutoff of 40 ng/mL.

This low immunoassay positivity rate is inconsistent with the manufacturer's published cross reactivity data for clonazepam and 7-aminoclonazepam. These data illustrate the limitations of using a 200 ng/mL cutoff to monitor clonazepam compliance and suggest that a cutoff of 40 ng/mL or less is needed to reliably monitor use of this drug.",

This effect was blocked by bicuculline, a GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, and enhanced by clonazepam, a central-type benzodiazepine-receptor agonist, and diazepam, a central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine-receptor agonist. Although bicuculline completely blocked the combination effect of GABA(A)-receptor agonist and clonazepam, it did not completely block the combination effect with diazepam. These results suggest that protein secretion is suppressively regulated by GABA(A) receptors coupled with central-type benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "68": "Z-360, a novel cholecystokinin(2) (CCK(2)) receptor antagonist, has been developed as a therapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer and showed pain relief action in phase Ib/IIa clinical trial. This study was attempted to elucidate the analgesic efficacy of Z-360 in mice. Oral administration of Z-360 (30-300 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the late phase of nociceptive responses to formalin. YF476, another CCK(2) receptor antagonist, was without effects at 1 and 10 mg/kg. In contrast, the CCK(1) receptor antagonist devazepide inhibited the nociceptive responses to formalin. In a mouse model of cancer pain, significant anti-allodynic effect of Z-360 was observed after single and repeated oral administration of 100 and 300 mg/kg doses. Anti-allodynic effect was also observed after repeated administration of devazepide. Combined single treatment with morphine and Z-360 caused an increase inhibition of pain-related responses in the pain models produced by formalin and cancer. Although Z-360 has lower affinity for CCK(1) receptor than for CCK(2) receptor, Z-360 exhibited an inhibitory effect on sulfated CCK-8-induced gallbladder emptying, a CCK(1) receptor-mediated effect, at a dose of 100 mg/kg. These results suggest that Z-360 inhibits inflammatory and cancer pain probably through the blockade of CCK(1) receptors.

A previous study shows that the co-administration of Z-360 with gemcitabine significantly prolonged the survival of mice with orthotopically implanted human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines. To clarify the therapeutic effects of Z-360 in combined with gemcitabine, we analyzed gene expression. When gemcitabine was administered, CCK-2/gastrin receptor expression was induced in an orthotropic xenograft model; the result indicating that Z-360 could act on gemcitabine-sensitive cells. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that gemcitabine increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), a prognostic factor for survival in pancreatic cancer, while Z-360 suppressed this induction of VEGFA gene expression. These results help to explain how Z-360 prolongs survival when used in combination with gemcitabine.", 
    "70": "Balb/c mice were exposed to an elevated platform that is extended on two opposite sides with lowered steep slopes. They were tested for 12min per session in 6 successive days. They received i.p. administration of either saline or one dose of diazepam (DZP 0.5, 1, 3mg/kg) in sessions 1-3, and saline in sessions 4 and 5. All groups of mice received a single dose of DZP (1mg/kg) in session 6. DZP produced inverted U-shaped dose-responses on the number of entries into different areas of the apparatus, with a peak in mean response at 1mg/kg whereas its effect on the duration of entries was mostly comparable between the 3 doses. It increased the number of crossings on the surface of the platform and facilitated entries onto the slopes. DZP-treated mice crossed frequently onto and spent longer time on the slopes in sessions 1-3 whereas saline-treated mice remained on the platform in sessions 1-6. Withdrawal of DZP in sessions 4-5 increased the latency of first entry and decreased the number and duration of entries onto the slopes which was reversed with the administration of 1mg/kg of DZP in the next session. This ON-OFF the drug may be due to the half-life of DZP which is very short in mice and rats ( approximately 0.88h). It also indicates that DZP-treated mice did not benefit from previous experience of entries onto the slopes which suggests a possible \"state-dependent\" effect. Administration of DZP after repeated exposures to the test did not facilitate entries onto the slopes but instead increased significantly the number of crossings on the surface of the platform; this increase was much higher than that observed in mice initially treated with DZP and exposed to the test. There is no evidence of habituation in saline-treated mice: the number of crossings on the platform was comparable between the first 5 sessions of the test. These results demonstrate that repeated exposures to the same anxiogenic environment resulted in avoidance responses developing tolerance and approach responses developing sensitization. They suggest that tolerance and sensitization are two opposite sides of the habituation process to the same stimulus and may account for the maintained state of anxiety.", 
    "71": "Many atypical antipsychotic drugs cause weight gain, but the mechanism of this weight gain is unclear. To dissect the role of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), an important receptor in the pharmacology of antipsychotic drugs, we analyzed the effect of olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone on changes in body weight and food intake in male wild-type (WT) and D2R knockout (D2R(-/-)) mice. The oral delivery of atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine (5 and 10mg/kg), risperidone (0.1 and 1.0mg/kg) and ziprasidone (10 and 20mg/kg) in both strains mice for 2 weeks suppressed body weight gain, except for olanzapine treatment in D2R(-/-) mice. Olanzapine treatment suppressed body weight gain and decreased food intake in WT mice, but also reduced fat body mass and locomotor activity, whereas D2R(-/-) mice did not show these changes. Ziprasidone and risperidone treatment produced similar responses in WT and D2R(-/-) mice. These data suggest the involvement of D2R in the effect of olanzapine on metabolic regulation. Further studies are required to explore the implications of D2R activity in antipsychotic-mediated metabolic complications.",

The offences occurred in Paris and its suburbs and in each of the cases there were two distinct periods of activity by the offenders with 2, 8 and 22 victims attributed to each of the perpetrators. To 20mg of decontaminated and cut hair, 100 pg/mg of clonazepam-d4 was added as internal standard. Hair specimens were extracted with CH(2)Cl(2)/ether after incubation overnight at 56 degrees C in pH 7.6 buffer. Extractions were performed on blood and urine using Toxi-tube A with 5 ng/mL of clonazepam-d4. The residues were analyzed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Calibration curves in blood and urine (0.5-500 ng/mL) were prepared by spiking aliquots of blank fluids (r(2)>0.9816 for all drugs). LOD in body fluids ranged 0.5-10 ng/mL. Calibration curves in hair (0.5-100 pg/mg) were prepared by spiking aliquots of blank hair (r(2)>0.9877 for all drugs). LOD in hair ranged 0.5-5 pg/mg. Case #1: Two young women were raped with an interval of approximately 1 year between the incidents. Lorazepam (present, <2 pg/mg) was detected in hair obtained from the first victim, and zolpidem (19 pg/mg) in hair of the second one. The offender was in jail between the two offences. Case #2: The offender approached a total of 8 men and women who were aged over 50 years. The offender was in jail between the two series of respectively 3 and 5 victims. Zopiclone was detected in victims' hair (n=7) at concentrations 13-42 pg/mg. Case #3: The offender stole thousands of Euros using credit cards obtained from 22 different wealthy victims. He employed a cocktail of up to 6 drugs made up of: flunitrazepam, clonazepam, doxylamine, cyamemazine, zolpidem and lorazepam. Drugs were detected in all victims' hair (n=18) at concentrations in the range 1-81 pg/mg for all drugs. Between the two series (of respectively 4 and 16 victims) the offender spent 6 months in jail, and then police spent 6 months looking for him while he was under judiciary control prior to his judgment. Segmental hair analysis permits retrospective information on drug exposure and should be considered in the investigation of drug-facilitated crimes not only to prove single exposure but also when there has been any appreciable delay in samples being obtained for analysis. Indeed, in 56% cases reported in this paper, due to the long time that elapsed between offences and the opportunity to obtain samples for analysis hair analysis was considered the only viable matrix to investigate the possibility of drug involvement in the crimes. Our experience demonstrates that the incidence of re-offending in DFC after a period of inactivity (often due to imprisonment) may be of concern, notably in big cities.",

Following identification of major UGT enzymes for BUP and NBUP glucuronidation, substrates were incubated with drugs (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, lamotrigine, oxazepam, and temazepam), which are extensively cleared by glucuronidation as well as are often used during maintenance treatment. To evaluate the inhibitory potential, the half maximal inhibitor concentration (IC(50)), the inhibition constant (K (i)), and the inhibitor concentration (K (I)) that yield half the maximum rate of inactivation and the enzyme inactivation rate constant (k (inact)) were determined, if appropriate. Amitriptyline and temazepam are inhibitors of NBUP glucuronidation (UGT1A3, HLMs), whereas BUP glucuronidation was affected by amitriptyline (HLMs), oxazepam, and temazepam (UGT2B7). Additionally, BUP inhibits NBUP glucuronidation (UGT1A1, 1A3, HLMs) and vice versa (UGT1A3). A decrease in the metabolic clearance of NBUP may increase the risk of adverse effects such as respiratory depression. Further investigations are needed to evaluate whether inhibition of BUP and NBUP glucuronidation contributes to adverse events.",

The typical patient with cocaine cardiomyopathy is a young male smoker who presents with signs of adrenergic excess. Management of these patients is similar to that of patients with other forms of dilated cardiomyopathy, although beta-blockers should be avoided in patients with cocaine-associated heart failure and benzodiazepines should be given in this setting to blunt adrenergic excess.

The anticonvulsant activity of the extract was assessed in strychnine-induced and isoniazide-induced convulsion models; phenytoin (20mg/kg) and diazepam (1mg/kg) were used as standards, respectively. Percentage protection provided by the drug was accounted as decrease in the number of convulsions within 8h of observation. Mechanism of action was studied by performing GABA transaminase (GABA-T) assay, isolated from rat brain. Active constituent was isolated and characterized from the plant extract.", 
    "101": "The median lethal dose (LD50) of Benkara malabarica was found to be more than 500 mg/kg. It demonstrated 30% and 35% protection against strychnine-induced convulsions and 60% and 80% protection against isoniazide-induced convulsions, at doses of 25mg/kg and 50mg/kg, respectively. Enzyme assay results revealed that Benkara malabarica extract possesses GABA-T inhibitory activity (IC50=0.721 mg/ml). Scopoletin which was identified as the major constituent of the extract was found to be an inhibitor of GABA-T (IC50=10.57 microM).",

L-theanine is a major component of green tea, which has traditionally been used as an herbal remedy in the treatment of many medical conditions, including anxiety. Herbals and supplements and their potential interactions perioperatively are a concern to anesthetists. Fifty-five rats were divided into 5 groups: control (saline); L-theanine (positive control); flumazenil (a known benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) and L-theanine; and midazolam and L-theanine. The behavioral component of anxiety was evaluated using the elevated plus-maze and calculated by the time spent in the open arm of the maze divided by total time in the maze. Data were analyzed using a 2-tailed multivariate analysis of variance and Sheff\u00e9 posthoc test. The data suggest that L-theanine does not produce anxiolysis by modulation of the GABAA receptor; however, in combination with midazolam, a synergistic or additive effect was demonstrated by decreased anxiety and both fine and basic motor movements. These data may provide direction for further studies examining L-theanine and its effects on anxiety and motor activity.",

In a prospective randomized double blind trial, 45 children between 2-8 years old received either oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (group M) or clonidine at 2 microg/kg (group C 2) or 4 microg/kg (group C4). The level of sedation, quality of parental separation, mask acceptance and thermodynamics were recorded. Postoperative analgesia, and perioperative side effects were assessed. In comparison to group M, the scores of sedation, parental separation and mask acceptance were significantly higher in group C2 and group C4 (p < 0.05). Also the level of sedation was significantly better in group C 4 than in group C 2 (p < 0.05). However, the rate of postoperative analgesia decreased significantly in group C 2 and C 4 compared to group M. The incidence of shivering was significantly increased in group M compared to group C 2 and C 4 . Oral clonidine premedication can therefore provide better preoperative sedation and postoperative analgesia with few adverse effects.",

The samples were divided into four groups according to other drugs detected (methadone only, methadone and strong analgesics, methadone and benzodiazepines, or methadone and other drugs). There was no significant difference in any of the R-methadone/total methadone ratios among the four groups. The median R/S ratio was 1.38, which tends to be higher than that reported for the plasma of living subjects. In addition, we investigated whether small nucleotide polymorphisms in the MDR1 gene that encode the drug transporter P-glycoprotein were associated with the concentrations of R- and S-methadone and its metabolite 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine.

On day 4, PET scans were performed after a bolus injection of [(11)C]PK11195. Eleven rats (7 LPS administered rats, 4 LPS non-administered rats) were evaluated. We used uptake ratios of the integral of right and left striatum from 0 to 60 min as an estimate of PBR distribution volume (V (60)).

    "117": "A 69-year-old woman came to the emergency department after four days of experiencing epigastric pressurelike pain that radiated to the left lower quadrant and worsened with ingestion of food. She had started lisinopril three months prior for treatment of hypertension and had been taking olanzapine regularly for bipolar disorder. Upon admission, she was afebrile and hemodynamically stable and exhibited tenderness of the epigastric region. Elevated pancreatic enzymes and abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging findings confirmed the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Common causes of pancreatitis were ruled out, and it was determined that the recent combination of lisinopril and olanzapine was the likely cause. Food and liquids were withheld, and all oral medications were stopped at hospital admission. Her pain resolved completely after two days. She was discharged on hospital day 4, and all of her medications except lisinopril and olanzapine were resumed. During a follow-up visit with her primary care physician, she reported to be doing well and had no systemic complaints. Olanzapine was reinitiated at that time but was discontinued a month later by her psychiatrist, who was concerned about the development of recurrent symptoms of pancreatitis. Valsartan was prescribed to achieve optimal blood pressure control three weeks after discharge. A follow-up CT scan of the abdomen a month later found no residual pancreatic abnormalities.",

No studies that met criteria are available on the use of phenol, alcohol, or botulinum toxin type B injections. For generalized spasticity, diazepam is probably effective in reducing spasticity, but there are insufficient data on its effect on motor function and its side-effect profile. Tizanidine is possibly effective, but there are insufficient data on its effect on function and its side-effect profile. There were insufficient data on the use of dantrolene, oral baclofen, and intrathecal baclofen, and toxicity was frequently reported.",

During evaluation as a potential treatment for asthma and allergic rhinitis, 2MI was identified as a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A4 in vitro. The inactivation was shown to be irreversible by dialysis and accompanied by an NADPH-dependent increase in 2MI covalent binding to a 55- to 60-kDa microsomal protein, consistent with irreversible binding to CYP3A4. Two glutathione (GSH) adducts, G1 and G2, were identified in vitro, and the more abundant adduct (G1) was unambiguously determined via NMR to be GSH adducted to the 3-position of the 2-methylindole moiety. The potential for a clinical drug-drug interaction arising from mechanism-based inactivation of CYP3A4 by 2MI was predicted using a steady-state model, and a 4.3- to 7.5-fold increase in the exposure of midazolam was predicted at anticipated therapeutic concentrations. To better assess the potential for in vivo drug-drug interactions, the Sprague-Dawley rat was used as an in vivo model. An excellent in vitro-in vivo correlation was observed for the reduction in enzyme steady-state concentration (E'(ss/Ess)) as well as the change in the exposure of a prototypical CYP3A substrate, indinavir (area under the curve (AUC) for indinavir/AUC). In summary, 2MI was identified as a potent mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A and was predicted to elicit a clinically relevant drug-drug interaction in humans at an anticipated therapeutic concentration.", 
    "124": "Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) can be detected in environmental matrices and human serum and has been shown to inhibit testicular steroidogenesis in rats. However, the mechanisms that are responsible for the toxic effects of PFDoA remain unknown. The aims of this study were to investigate the mechanism of steroidogenesis inhibition by PFDoA and to identify the molecular target of PFDoA in Leydig cells. The effects of PFDoA on steroid synthesis in Leydig cells were assessed by radioimmunoassay. The expression of key genes and proteins in steroid biosynthesis was determined by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) levels were determined using bioluminescence assays. PFDoA inhibited adenosine 3',5'-cyclophosphate (cAMP)-stimulated steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig tumor cells (mLTC-1) and primary rat Leydig cells in a dose-dependent manner. However, PFDoA (1-100 microM) did not exhibit effects on cell viability and cellular ATP levels in mLTC-1 cells. PFDoA inhibited steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) promoter activity and StAR expression at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels but did not affect mRNA levels of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, or 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in cAMP-stimulated mLTC-1 cells. PFDoA treatment also resulted in increased levels of mitochondrial ROS and H(2)O(2). After excessive ROS and H(2)O(2) were eliminated in PFDoA-treated mLTC-1 cells by MnTMPyP (a superoxide dismutase analog), progesterone production was partially restored and StAR mRNA and protein levels were partially recovered. These data show that PFDoA inhibits steroidogenesis in cAMP-stimulated Leydig cells by reducing the expression of StAR through a model of action involving oxidative stress.",

Formal equivalence analysis using the two one-sided t test method showed that the geometric mean ratios for maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for midazolam coadministered with telavancin versus midazolam coadministered with placebo were close to unity. The 90% confidence intervals (CIs) around the ratios fell within the 0.8-1.25 bioequivalence bounds (geometric mean ratio for AUC from time zero to the last measured plasma concentration 0.95, 90% CI 0.910-0.984; C(max) geometric mean ratio 1.03, 90% CI 0.956-1.11).

Thirteen procedures were performed by manually controlled infusion of 30-75 mg fasudil hydrochloride (1.2-3.75 mg/ml) for approximately 10 minutes. Eighteen procedures were performed by continuous infusion of 60 mg fasudil hydrochloride (1.2 mg/ml) by infusion pump at a constant rate of 3 mg/min. Neurological improvement was observed after 18 of 22 procedures in patients with neurological deterioration due to vasospasm. Convulsion during IAFH developed in 4 patients, all treated by manual infusion (p < 0.05). The manual infusion method (p < 0.05) and infusion rate greater than 3 mg/min (p < 0.01) were significantly associated with the incidence of convulsion during IAFH. IAFH was effective for treating cerebral vasospasm following aneurysmal SAH. IAFH at a constant rate of 3 mg/min delivered by infusion pump improved the symptoms of cerebral vasospasm and prevented convulsions during IAFH.", 
    "130": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AADs) are the standard treatment for both the acute and long-term management of schizophrenia and an augmentation to mood stabilizers for bipolar disorder (BD). Yet many individuals who take AADs do not fully respond to them, while others experience side effects that include weight gain and metabolic disorder. This in vitro pharmacogenetic study examined whether allelic variants in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)(2A) receptor alter the in vitro pharmacology of six AADs (clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole). We selected 4 functional single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for investigation (Thr25Asn, Ile197Val, Ala447Val, and His452Tyr), conducted site-directed mutagenesis studies to induce variants into human HEK-293 cell lines, and screened allelic variants for their effects on 5-HT( 2A) receptors in the cell lines. We conducted numerous binding assays and fluorescence-based assay system (FLEX station) experiments using the six AADs. Our results indicated that three polymorphic 5-HT(2A) receptors (Ile197Val, Ala447Val, and His452Tyr) exhibited statistically significant, though modest, changes in atypical antipsychotic affinity. In addition, three polymorphic receptors (Thr25Asn, Ile197Val, and His452Try) altered AAD potency. Our findings support in vivo evidence that functional SNPs in genes encoding neuroreceptor drug targets could explain interindividual differences in AAD drug response and tolerability. We suggest that more in vivo pharmacogenetic studies of well-characterized patients who are prescribed AADs be indicated. Future pharmacogenetic studies of well-characterized patients will likely involve tagging SNPs and the use of haplotypes related to other genes encoding neuroreceptor drug targets.",

Their effects were compared to those of a 1,4-benzodiazepine agonist, flunitrazepam and the already known 1,5-benzodiazepine antiepileptic clobazam. The effects were evaluated for the two different GABA(A) receptor populations present in these neurons, one mediating phasic inhibition and the other one mediating tonic inhibition. Many such compounds display a profile of inverse agonist to both GABA(A) receptor populations. One of them presents a profile of full agonist at the component mediating phasic inhibition. Interestingly, substitution of just one oxygen atom in that compound with sulphur in a specific position of a morpholine ring resulted in a remarkable change of activity from full agonist to a probable inverse agonist. This indicates such a position as a proton accepting one for the ligand within the benzodiazepine binding pocket of the relevant GABA(A) receptors. In addition, that position appears to be critical for the pharmacological activity.", 
    "137": "High doses of diazepam reduce the inflammatory paw edema in rats. This effect was attributed to an action of diazepam on the Translocator Protein (TSPO). We evaluated the effects of diazepam (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on leukocyte rolling and migration. In carrageenan-induced acute inflammation, diazepam decreased the interaction of leukocytes with endothelial cells (rolling) and the number of leukocytes in the mesentery (migration). RU486 (antagonist of glucocorticoid receptors) reduced the effects of diazepam on leukocyte rolling and migration, suggesting a participation of endogenous corticosteroids. We also showed that the effects of diazepam on leukocyte-endothelium interactions are mediated by nitric oxide (NO), since prior treatment with l-arginine (precursor of NO) partially precludes the inhibitory effects of diazepam; conversely, pretreatment with L-NAME (false substrate of the NO synthase) somewhat potentiates the effects of diazepam. The pathways that underlie the effects of diazepam remain to be further elucidated, but we believe that both local and systemic mechanisms may overlap to explain the influence of diazepam on leukocyte-endothelium interactions.",

A number of reports show that carisoprodol has been abused for its sedative and relaxant effects, to augment or alter the effects of other drugs, and by the intentional combination of carisoprodol and other noncontrolled medications because of the relative ease (as compared to controlled substances) of obtaining prescriptions. The diversion and abuse of carisoprodol and its adverse health effects appear to have dramatically increased over the last several years. Clinicians have begun to see a withdrawal syndrome consisting of insomnia, vomiting, tremors, muscle twitching, anxiety, and ataxia in patients who abruptly cease intake of large doses of carisoprodol. Hallucinations and delusions may also occur. The withdrawal symptoms are very similar to those previously described for meprobamate withdrawal, suggesting that what may actually be occurring is withdrawal from meprobamate accumulated as a result of intake of excessive amounts of carisoprodol. However carisoprodol itself is capable of modulating GABA(A) function, and this may contribute both to the drugs abuse potential and to the occurrence of a withdrawal syndrome with abrupt cessation of intake. Carisoprodol has been classified as a controlled substance in several states in the US and restrictions on the use of the drug have been imposed in some European countries. Carisoprodol is metabolized to a controlled substance, has clear evidence of abuse potential and increasing incidence of abuse, and has shown evidence of a withdrawal syndrome with abrupt cessation from intake. This article will discuss the abuse potential of carisoprodol and the associated withdrawal syndrome, and consider implications for future use of the drug.",

The cerebrovascular plasma volume (assessed by administration of the non-absorbable marker [(14)C]-inulin) was not significantly different in saline-treated compared with PTZ-treated mice and in wild-type compared with mutant R43Q mice. 5. These results demonstrate that although the brain uptake of AEDs may be altered in acute seizure models, similar changes to brain uptake may not be observed in the non-convulsive genetic absence epileptic model.", 
    "208": "Currently, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies of sedatives and analgesics are performed in neonates and children to find suitable dose regimens. As a result, sensitive assays using only small volumes of blood are necessary to determine drug and metabolite concentrations. We developed an ultra-performance liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometry detection for quantification of midazolam, 1-hydroxymidazolam, hydroxymidazolamglucuronide, morphine, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide in 100 microL of plasma. Cleanup consisted of 96 wells micro-solid phase extraction, before reversed-phase chromatographic separation (ultra-performance liquid chromatography) and selective detection using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Separate solid-phase extraction methods were necessary to quantify morphine, midazolam and their metabolites because of each group's physicochemical properties. Standard curves were linear over a large dynamic range with adequate limits of quantitation. Intra- and interrun accuracy and precision were within 85-115% (of nominal concentration using a fresh calibration curve) and 15% (coefficient of variation, CV) respectively. Recoveries were >80% for all analytes, with interbatch CVs (as a measure of matrix effects) of less than 15% over six batches of plasma. Stability in plasma and extracts was sufficient, allowing large autosampler loads. Runtime was 3.00 min per sample for each method. The combination of 96-well micro-SPE and UPLC-MS/MS allows reliable quantification of morphine, midazolam and their major metabolites in 100 microL of plasma.", 
    "209": "In the present study, the effects of prenatal manganese (Mn) intoxication on the anxiolytic-like effects of diazepam and the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist R-(+)-8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were examined.Wistar dams were exposed to MnCl(2).4H(2)O at 5,000 ppm in the drinking water for the duration of pregnancy. On the day of parturition, Mn was discontinued as an additive in the drinking water. Control rats were derived from dams that consumed tap water and had no exposure to Mn. Male offspring were tested at the age of 12 weeks. The anxiolytic-like effect was assessed in an elevated plus maze device and with the Vogel conflict test. The benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (5 mg/kg, ip) increased the percentage of time spent in open arms in control rats (in comparison to saline treatment) (p < 0.05); no such effect was seen in Mn-exposed rats. Conversely, the serotoninergic 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg, ip) increased the percentage of time spent in open arms in both experimental groups. In the Vogel drinking test, an anxiolytic-like effect was also observed in both test groups (in controls this was of borderline significance). In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT did not evoke an anxiolytic-like action in control or in Mn-exposed rats in the anticonflict test. In conclusion, findings indicate that gestational Mn exposure attenuated benzodiazepine-mediated anxiolytic-like effects but not those of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT.", 
    "210": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key neurotrophic factor in the brain. It plays an important role in the etiopathogenesis and pharmacotherapy of mental disorders, such as depression or schizophrenia. In recent years, studies have shown that cognitive processes, which are impaired in the course of mental disorders, significantly change BDNF levels in the brain. Administered to rats at a dose of 20 mg/kg (b.d. for 5 weeks), venlafaxine (VEN) increases BDNF levels in the hippocampus and cortex, compared to controls. Administered at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (b.d. for 5 weeks), olanzapine (OLA) significantly increases BDNF levels in both the cortex and the hippocampus. Similarly, nicotine (NIC) administered at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg (b.d. for 5 weeks) increases BDNF concentrations in both the hippocampus and the cortex. Combined administration of NIC with VEN or OLA does not increase BDNF levels in the hippocampus or the cortex. Based on our study, it can be claimed that BDNF mediates behavioral responses only to drugs used individually and participates in the antidepressant and procognitive effects of the study compounds. BDNF also initiates plastic changes and modulation of synaptic activity in rat brains.", 
    "211": "Huntington disease (HD) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with symptoms of chorea, dystonia, incoordination, cognitive decline, and behavioral difficulties. Abnormal responses to anesthesia have been reported in case reports and raised concerns regarding the safety of anesthesia in this patient population.", 
    "212": "We performed a computerized search of the Mayo Clinic medical records database searching for patients with HD who underwent general anesthesia. Medical records were reviewed for anesthetic technique, medications used, and postoperative complications.", 
    "213": "We identified 11 patients with genetically confirmed HD who underwent 17 general anesthetics. Psychiatric medication use was common, with 6 patients using antipsychotics, 7 patients using antidepressants, and 3 patients using benzodiazepines. Succinylcholine was used in 7 anesthetics, and nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs in 11 anesthetics, all without adverse effects. Patients had normal responses to induction and maintenance of anesthesia without adverse effects. Serious postoperative complications did not occur.", 
    "214": "Contrary to previous case reports, we found that patients with HD have normal responses to general anesthesia. However, the anesthesiologist should be aware of interactions between anesthetics and psychiatric medications frequently used by these patients. Measures should also be taken to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration because bulbar dysfunction may be a manifestation of this disease.", 
    "215": "Benzodiazepines have wide-spread used in pharmacotherapy for their anxiolytic, myorelaxant, hypnotic, amnesic and anticonvulsive properties. Despite benzodiazepines are used in clinics over 50 years, they have not been surprisingly tested for capability to induce major drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450. In the current study, we have examined the potency of Alprazolam, Bromazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Clonazepam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Medazepam, Midazolam, Nitrazepam, Oxazepam, Tetrazepam and Triazolam to induce CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Benzodiazepines were tested in therapeutic concentrations and in concentrations corresponding to their plasma levels in intoxicated patients. We found weak but significant induction of CYP3A4 mRNA by Midazolam and Medazepam, while other benzodiazepines did not induce CYP3A4 expression. None of the tested compounds induced CYP1A2 mRNA in three independent human hepatocytes cultures. In addition, employing gene reporter assays with transiently transfected hepatocarcinoma cells, we found that tested benzodiazepines did not activate aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), whereas Midazolam and Medazepam slightly activated pregnane X receptor (PXR). Consistently, two-hybrid mammalian assay using hybrid fusion plasmids GAL4-PXR ligand-binding domain (LBD) and VP16-SRC-1-receptor-interacting domain (RID) confirmed PXR activation by Midazolam and Medazepam. In conclusion, Alprazolam, Bromazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, Clonazepam, Diazepam, Lorazepam, Nitrazepam, Oxazepam, Tetrazepam and Triazolam can be considered as safe drugs in term of their inability to induce PXR- and AhR-dependent cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4. Medazepam and Midazolam slightly activated pregnane X receptor and displayed weak potency to induce CYP3A4 mRNA in human hepatocytes.", 
    "216": "Injectable lorazepam (IL) is marketed in many countries but in France is only available within the framework of a compassionate use program for refractory status epilepticus. This study aims to evaluate the differences of pediatric use and status of IL in the hospitals of the Mother-Child French-speaking Network (R\u00e9seau m\u00e8re-enfant de la francophonie, i.e., RMEF).", 
    "217": "Inclusion criteria are: firstly, RMEF member; secondly, one site per town; thirdly, all the Assistance publique-H\u00f4pitaux de Paris hospitals. After a phone-recruitment in each selected hospital, a survey was sent by e-mail. The data collected concerned the number of beds in the hospital, the official status of IL, its place in the therapeutic strategy, in hospital consumption in 2008 (in milligram) and the therapeutic alternatives.", 
    "218": "Among the 18 hospitals selected, 17 were contacted and 12 (70%) replied. IL is not marketed in Tunisia and Lebanon. In Switzerland, Canada and Belgium, IL is marketed and used in all the polled hospitals (6.2 to 48.0mg per bed). In France, only the Robert Debr\u00e9 Hospital uses it (3.2mg per bed). In the countries where it is marketed, IL was firstly prescribed for the studied indication. In the other countries, injectable diazepam was the first line treatment (six out of eight hospitals).", 
    "219": "France is the only country where IL is available though not marketed. The pharmacokinetic data favor use of IL instead of its principal therapeutic alternative (injectable diazepam) but no currently available evidence concludes that IL is superior to diazepam in the management of pediatric status epilepticus. The official indication of IL in France (last intention) is in contradiction with its use in the countries where it is marketed and with the data of the literature in favor of the first intention. This works presents the first evaluation on the use of IL in pediatric status epilepticus in the RMEF hospitals. It highlights the discrepancies in the management of status epilepticus in comparable pediatric hospitals.", 
    "220": "Many antipsychotic drugs cause QT prolongation, although the effect differs based on the particular drug. We sought to determine the potential for antipsychotic drugs to prolong the QTc interval (>470 ms in men and >480 ms in women) using the Bazett formula in a \"real-world\" setting by analyzing the electrocardiograms of 1017 patients suffering from schizophrenia. Using logistic regression analysis to calculate the adjusted relative risk (RR), we found that chlorpromazine (RR for 100 mg=1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.14 to 1.64; p<.005), intravenous haloperidol (RR for 2 mg=1.29, 95% CI=1.18 to 1.43; p<.001), and sultopride (RR for 200 mg=1.45, 95% CI=1.28 to 1.63; p<.001) were associated with an increased risk of QTc prolongation. Levomepromazine also significantly lengthened the QTc interval. The second-generation antipsychotic drugs (i.e., olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and zotepine), mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, and antiparkinsonian drugs did not prolong the QTc interval. Our results suggest that second-generation antipsychotic drugs are generally less likely than first-generation antipsychotic drugs to produce QTc interval prolongation, which may be of use in clinical decision making concerning the choice of antipsychotic medication.",

    "222": "Prospective, consecutive, interventional case series in a single tertiary-referral oculoplastic unit.", 
    "223": "A total of 294 patients undergoing 314 isolated oculoplastic procedures, performed under intravenous sedation with periocular local anesthetic from November 2007 to November 2008.", 
    "224": "Prospective data collection on patient demographics, history of photic sneezing, intravenous sedative, depth of sedation, nasal oxygen, and periocular infiltration site. Standard local anesthetic was used in all cases, but the intravenous sedation was at the discretion of the attending anesthesiologist (7 in total).", 
    "225": "Sneezing or attempted sneezing within 5 minutes of injection of the local anesthetic, as determined by agreed observation between attending staff.", 
    "226": "Sneezing was observed in 16% of cases. No association was found between sneezing and patient age or presence of nasal oxygen. A weakly positive association was observed with male gender (55% sneezers vs. 37% non-sneezers, P = 0.03, relative risk [RR] = 1.5, confidence interval [CI], 1.1-2.0), bilateral infiltration (65% vs. 40%, P = 0.005, RR = 1.6, CI, 1.2-2.1), and upper eyelid infiltration (73% vs. 54%, P = 0.01, RR = 1.4, CI, 1.1-1.7). Photic sneezing was described in 47% of sneezers and 19% of non-sneezers (P = 0.0004, RR = 2.6, CI, 1.6-4.0). Because propofol was given to 95% of patients, no association with sneezing could be ascertained. However, opioid derivatives were found to be protective (12% vs. 43%, P<0.0001, RR = 0.3, CI, 0.1-0.6), whereas midazolam doubled the risk of sneezing (45% vs. 22%, P = 0.0008, RR = 2.1, CI, 1.4-3.0). Deep sedation (Ramsay score 5-6) also strongly increased the sneeze risk (65% vs. 23%, P<0.0001, RR = 2.8, CI, 2.1-3.8).", 
    "227": "Propofol-based intravenous sedation, in combination with periocular local anesthetic injections, induces sneezing in approximately one sixth of general oculoplastic cases. Male gender, a history of photic sneezing, bilateral or upper eyelid infiltration, deep sedation, and the concurrent administration of midazolam all increased the risk, whereas adjunctive opioid use reduced the risk."
