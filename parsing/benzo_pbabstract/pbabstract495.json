The rabbit antinociceptive model is highly sensitive and predictive of analgesia in humans. We found that the combination of midazolam with fentanyl enhanced antinociception compared with fentanyl alone. In addition, with this model there were relatively unimportant increases in respiratory depression.", 
    "1": "Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist, has been advocated as a new treatment for hepatic encephalopathy. This drug is extensively metabolized by the liver in normal subjects. In the present study, we examined Ro 15-1788 disposition in eight healthy controls (Group I), eight cirrhotic patients with moderately impaired liver function (Pugh score less than 10, Group II) and eight patients with severe liver dysfunction (Pugh score greater than 10, Group III). The subjects of each group were age and sex matched. After an intravenous infusion of 2 mg Ro 15-1788 over 5 min, blood samples were taken at fixed intervals up to 7 hr after the infusion. Plasma levels of the drug were determined by capillary gas chromatography. In controls, Ro 15-1788 had a high plasma clearance [16.3 +/- 2.6 ml per min per kg (mean +/- S.D.)], a short half-life (45.7 +/- 8.5 min), a large volume of distribution (0.62 +/- 0.09 liter per kg) and a low plasma protein binding (45 +/- 6%). Plasma clearance was reduced markedly in both groups of cirrhotic patients (-57 and -74%, respectively); the volume of distribution was unchanged in Group II and moderately increased in Group III (+37%). The elimination half-life was markedly prolonged in Groups II and III (+66 and +210%, respectively). Plasma clearance and Pugh score were highly correlated in cirrhotic patients (r = 0.830, p less than 0.001). The plasma protein binding of Ro 15-1788 was lower in cirrhotics, resulting in a significant increase in the free fraction of the drug (+16% in Group II; +44% in Group III).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "The aim of this work was to develop and initiate the documentation of an instrument for the assessment of subjective CNS-related symptoms occurring during cardiovascular pharmacotherapy. The self-applied questionnaire developed for minor symptom evaluation (MSE profile) includes 24 items and uses a visual analogue scale to record symptoms. Three different studies were performed using a total of 86 healthy volunteers. Based on a subjective grouping followed by principal component analysis to confirm the grouping, three dimensions-contentment (eight items), vitality (five items), and sleep (three items)-were formed. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient, used to evaluate the internal consistency of these dimensions, was found to be 0.90, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. To validate the MSE profile, the subjective symptoms of two classes of drugs with well-known symptom profiles, a nonselective, beta-blocker (propranolol) and a benzodiazepine (oxazepam), were compared in placebo-controlled randomized double-blind crossover studies. The obtained results indicate that the symptom profiles were different but were compatible with the previously reported effects of these compounds. It can be concluded that the MSE profile is practical, useful, and sensitive enough to also detect subtle drug-induced effects.", 
    "3": "Release of catecholamines, induced by carbachol, from bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, maintained in culture, is potently inhibited by the presence of ethanol (50 mM). This inhibition is prevented by the concomitant presence of bicuculline (1 microM) or by the inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, Ro 15 4513 (50 nM), arguing that the effect of ethanol is, at least, partly due to potentiation of endogenous GABA at the GABAA receptor sites on these cells. Exposing cells to medium containing ethanol (200 mM) for 4 days results in an approximately 100% increase in binding sites for [3H]dihydropyridine on membranes of adrenal chromaffin cells. This increase in binding sites was largely prevented by the presence in the culture medium of Ro 15 4513 (50 nM), the dihydropyridine calcium channel agonist BAY K 8644 (50 nM) or the calcium channel antagonist, nitrendipine (50 nM). The results strongly suggest that the increase in binding sites for [3H]dihydropyridine represents an adaptation of cells to overcome the inhibitory effect of ethanol on the excitability of cells (which is, at least partly, due to some action at the GABAA receptor). The protein containing the receptor site for dihydropyridine drugs is clearly also involved in controlling its up-regulation by ethanol, but this is probably not directly related to its channel function, since both activators and inhibitors of the dihydropyridine-sensitive channel prevented ethanol-induced up-regulation of binding sites for [3H]dihydropyridine.", 
    "4": "Pancreatic exocrine secretion was evoked by electrical stimulation of the vagus nerves (EVS) in dogs to determine whether a gut hormone was responsible for the pancreatic stimulatory activity. In 39 dogs, pancreatic juice was continuously collected to measure volume, bicarbonate, and amylase output, while portal and femoral venous plasma concentrations of gastrin, cholecystokinin (CCK), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were determined by radioimmunoassay. EVS produced a significant increase in the pancreatic secretion. Although concentrations of all four peptides significantly increased in plasma, only CCK at the concentration in venous circulation was bioactive in dispersed rat pancreatic acini preparations. This bioactivity of CCK was completely blocked by CR 1409, a CCK-receptor antagonist. The pancreatic secretion by EVS was reduced significantly by intravenous MK-329 (formerly L364,718) to as low as 22% of control values and was completely suppressed by intravenous atropine. The increment in plasma CCK by EVS was also significantly suppressed by atropine. The present study indicates that increased pancreatic secretion by EVS is in part mediated by endogenous CCK.", 
    "5": "The cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist L 364718 was used to examine the role of CCK in control of food intake. Effects of L 364718 (0.01-1 mg/kg ip) on the feeding response to a maximal inhibitory dose of cholecystokinin COOH-terminal octapeptide (CCK-8; 8 nmol/kg ip) and on food intake alone were determined in rats fed ad libitum during the dark cycle. CCK-8 suppressed feeding by 48%. L 364718 reversed this effect dose dependently; the minimal effective dose was 0.03 mg/kg, and complete reversal occurred at 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg. L 364718 (0.03 mg/kg) caused a parallel, rightward shift in the dose-response curve to CCK-8 [1-128 nmol/kg, half-maximal effective dose (ED50) increased 16-fold] but did not alter the maximal response, consistent with competitive-like kinetics. L 364718 stimulated liquid and solid food intake dose-dependently by 11-35%. The minimal effective dose was 0.1 mg/kg; maximal stimulation occurred at 0.3 mg/kg. Duodenal infusion of bile-pancreatic juice did not alter the response. These results support an important role for CCK in control of food intake.", 
    "6": "Non-dependent volunteers with histories of opioid use were trained in a three-choice drug-discrimination procedure to discriminate the effects of i.m. saline, hydromorphone hydrochloride (3 mg/70 kg) and pentazocine lactate (45 mg/70 kg). In daily sessions, monetary reinforcement was contingent upon correctly identifying by letter code, the drug administered; measures of drug discrimination included an operant procedure and a qualitative and a quantitative choice procedure. Drug effects were assessed concurrently on self reports and physiological indices. After acquisition of the discrimination, subjects were tested for generalization to: 1) a range of doses of the training drugs, 2) p.o. doses of the training drugs and 3) novel drugs. The discrimination was readily learned and all three discrimination measures were comparable. Discrimination performance, as well as self reports and physiological effects, remained stable over the course of the study, suggesting that tolerance did not develop in the daily session procedure. Testing with a range of doses of the training drugs resulted in dose-related effects in discrimination performance, physiological effects and self-reported drug effect. Oral doses of the training drugs resulted in partial generalization to the i.m. training doses, compatible with the attenuated subjective effects of the p.o. doses. Novel drugs (d-amphetamine, 10-20 mg p.o.; Lorazepam, 2-4 mg p.o.; and secobarbital, 100-200 mg p.o.) did not generalize to hydromorphone, but showed partial generalization to both pentazocine and saline. In general, drug-discrimination performance paralleled the patterns of self reports.", 
    "7": "Receptor autoradiography has been employed to investigate the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) preincubation on the interaction of the GABAA receptor with its ligands. [3H]GABA (50 nM) binding to the GABAA receptors is increased by 60% compared to control sections after GABA (100 microM) preincubation. Receptor autoradiography shows that the increase is more pronounced in certain brain areas. The allosteric interactions between the GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites were also examined. An increase in [3H]GABA (50 nM) binding to rat brain sections by co-incubation with the benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam (FNZ) has been observed autoradiographically. This effect has been quantitated in several brain regions; the overall brain increase in [3H]GABA binding induced by 1 microM FNZ was 20%. The increase in [3H]FNZ (1 nM) binding by co-incubation with GABA has also been observed autoradiographically, and the effect quantitated in four brain regions. The overall brain increase in [3H]FNZ binding induced by 100 microM GABA was 34%. After GABA preincubation these allosteric responses are significantly reduced in size. The increase in the [3H]GABAA binding as a consequence of GABA preincubation appears to reflect an increase in receptor affinity for [3H]GABA with no significant change in the maximum number of binding sites. We suggest that GABA preincubation converts the GABAA receptor to a higher affinity desensitised receptor conformation.", 
    "8": "Injection of the partial benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro15-4513 (1-32 mg/kg i.p.) or nonconvulsant i.v. doses of the full benzodiazepine inverse agonist beta-CCE immediately following cessation of exposure of rats to an anesthetic concentration of methoxyflurane significantly antagonized the duration of methoxyflurane anesthesia as measured by recovery of the righting reflex and/or pain sensitivity. This antagonism was inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788 at doses which alone did not alter the duration of methoxyflurane anesthesia. In addition, high-dose Ro15-4513 pretreatment (32 mg/kg) antagonized the induction and duration of methoxyflurane anesthesia but was unable to prevent methoxyflurane anesthesia or affect the induction or duration of anesthesia induced by the dissociative anesthetic ketamine (100 mg/kg). These findings indicate that methoxyflurane anesthesia can be selectively antagonized by the inverse agonistic action of Ro15-4513 and beta-CCE.", 
    "9": "After buprenorphine was introduced as an analgesic, several clinical observations have stimulated the investigation of its potential abuse by heroin addicts. To evaluate the prevalence of buprenorphine use by a group of heroin abusers being treated on an outpatient basis, a cross-sectional study was carried out where the information given by the 188 subjects was verified by urine drug analyses. The patients had three different therapeutic modalities: methadone maintenance program (MMP), antagonist maintenance program (AMP), and drug-free program (DFP). The urine samples were analyzed with an enzyme immunoassay technique for the detection of heroin, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, cannabis and benzodiazepines. Buprenorphine was investigated with a radioimmunoassay technique. Overall 66% of the patients admitted having used buprenorphine throughout their toxicologic history (period prevalence) and 6.7% had positive urine controls for this drug (5% in the MMP group, 0% in the AMP group and 12% in the DFP group) (point prevalence). In 72% of the cases the drug was administered intravenously. In addition, a clinically statistically significant association was found between positivity for heroin and buprenorphine. The possible tolerance to the latter is suggested by the fact that the mean current dose was higher than the mean initial dose. In the study population, the use of cannabis and benzodiazepines was also very high. The results suggest that most patients had a previous history of buprenorphine use. This drug could have a higher potential for abuse than that found in previous experimental studies.", 
    "10": "The effects of seganserin, a specific 5HT2 antagonist, on human sleep were assessed in two experiments and compared to the effects of temazepam and sleep deprivation. During daytime recovery sleep after sleep deprivation, seganserin did not significantly enhance visually scored slow wave sleep (SWS, stages 3 + 4) or the EEG power density in the delta frequencies. Under these conditions temazepam reduced the power density in the delta and theta frequencies. During nighttime sleep after a nap in the evening, seganserin caused an increase in SWS, a reduction in intermittent wakefulness, and an enhancement of the power density in the delta and theta frequencies during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Temazepam induced a reduction in the power density in the delta and theta frequencies. It is concluded that the 5HT2 antagonist, seganserin, can induce SWS. However, since the spectral results showed that the changes in the sleep EEG were not identical to those induced by sleep deprivation it seems premature to conclude that 5HT2 receptors are primarily involved in NREM sleep regulation.", 
    "11": "The effect of the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, on serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission was assessed in in vivo electrophysiological experiments. Diazepam enhanced, in a dose-dependent manner (0.05-2 mg/kg i.v.), the effect of electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway on the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons. This effect was blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. Diazepam did not modify the efficacy of microiontophoretic application of 5-HT and GABA. The results indicate that the activation of benzodiazepine receptors facilitates of 5-HT neurotransmission, presumably through a presynaptic modulatory mechanism.", 
    "12": "Cloned cDNA encoding the bovine alpha 4 subunit of the GABAA receptor has been isolated. The predicted 51 amino acid long mature protein contains an exceptionally long intracellular domain and shares 53-56% sequence similarity to the previously characterized alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 subunits. Co-expression of alpha 4 and beta 1 in Xenopus oocytes resulted in the formation of GABA-gated chloride channels with expected pharmacology, although no benzodiazepine potentiation was observed. Northern analysis indicates that a 4 kb alpha 4 mRNA is expressed in the calf cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus but is barely detectable in the rat brain.", 
    "13": "Various aspects of psychotropic drug use by University of Cape Town 5th-year medical students during the final 4-week block of the year and the ensuing examination period were studied using a questionnaire. The response rate was 96.2%. Twenty-seven (17.8%) of the respondents indicated that they had used a total of 32 psychotropic drugs--18 used benzodiazepines, 6 used stimulants, 4 used beta-blockers and 3 used antidepressants. Fourteen students used the drugs daily or more frequently, while 10 had used psychotropic drugs before the period under investigation. Fourteen drugs were obtained from sources other than the prescription of a medical practitioner. Fourteen students used the drugs for insomnia. In 2 cases the purpose for which the drug was taken was not achieved. Six adverse drug reactions were reported. Implications of these results are explored.", 
    "14": "The major \"male specific\" species of cytochrome P-450 (P-450ml) was purified and an antibody against it used to evaluate the involvement of this isozyme in alterations of drug metabolism in senescence. P-450ml exhibited strikingly high imipramine (IM) N-demethylase activity while it showed no IM 2-hydroxylation, which is an alternate pathway of IM metabolism in rat liver microsomes. The antibody to P-450ml inhibited 80% of imipramine N-demethylation in young male rats. In old male rats, which have been shown to have lower IM N-demethylase activity, a 60% inhibition was observed. The inhibitable portion of this activity in old male rats is about one third of that in young rats, but the remaining portion not inhibited by this antibody is almost identical in young and old rats. IM 2-hydroxylation on the other hand was not inhibited by this antibody at all. It also inhibited about 30% of diazepam(DZ) N-demethylation in young rats but showed no inhibition in old rats, resulting in the loss of the age difference in the remaining portion. DZ 3-hydroxylation was not inhibited by this antibody, in spite of the fact that it showed a markedly higher activity in young male than in young female rats with a subsequent reduction in old age in male rats. This study provides the first direct evidence that differences in the amount of the major male specific P-450 isozyme (P-450ml) are responsible for the age- and sex-associated differences in some of the drug metabolizing activities. It also became apparent that P-450ml may not be the only isozyme responsible for these differences.", 
    "15": "The gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor purified from adult bovine cerebral cortex was photoaffinity-labelled with the agonist benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam and the radioactivity shown to be coincident with a band with Mr 53,000 that was recognized by three anti-(GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit sequence)-specific antibodies. Complete and limited CNBr cleavage of the purified photoaffinity-labelled receptor was carried out. The products of this reaction were analysed for radioactivity, for immunoreactivity with anti-[alpha 1-(1-15)-peptide], anti-[alpha 1-(324-341)-peptide] and anti-[alpha 1-(413-429)-peptide] polyclonal antibodies and for carbohydrate by biotinylated concanavalin A lectin overlay. Complete CNBr cleavage gave a radioactive peptide with Mr 10,000-12,000 that was not recognized by the above-mentioned specific antisera. By using the deduced amino acid sequence of the alpha 1 subunit [Schofield, Darlison, Fujita, Burt, Stephenson, Rodriguez, Rhee, Ramachandran, Reale, Glencorse, Seeburg & Barnard (1987) Nature (London) 328, 221-227], it is proposed that the site of the benzodiazepine-agonist photoaffinity-labelling reaction does not lie within the amino acid sequences alpha 1 1-58 and alpha 1 149-429.", 
    "16": "[3H]Ro 5-4864 binds to Nb 2 node lymphoma cells in a specific saturable and reversible fashion. Scatchard analysis of specific binding data reveals a single, homogeneous class of whole cell binding sites with a Kd of 3.94 +/- 0.22 nM and a Bmax value of 155 +/- 11 fmol (Ro 5-4864 bound)/2 x 10(6) cells. Ro 5-4864, a reported peripheral benzodiazepine receptor agonist both inhibits (10(-6) M) and potentiates (10(-9) M) the mitogenic action of prolactin on the Nb 2 node lymphoma cells. Interestingly, PK 11195, an antagonist, potentiates (10(-9) M) the mitogenic activity of prolactin in these cells. The actions of both Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 seem to be mediated through a common receptor type since a 10(-6) M concentration of either agent will block the others potentiating action. Furthermore, the simultaneous addition of a 10(-9) M concentration of Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 does not further increase the effect on prolactin stimulated mitogenesis. Clonazepam, a central benzodiazepine receptor agonist has no effect on prolactin-stimulated mitogenesis in this system. These data suggest that the Nb 2 node lymphoma cells possess a peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. In these cells, this receptor seems to serve the function of modulating the ability of the growth factor, prolactin to initiate the mitogenic process. These studies also suggest that Ro 5-4864 is functioning as a partial agonist rather than a 'pure' agonist for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in this system.", 
    "17": "The time course of changes in specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding following 2 weeks of treatment with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (2.7 and 4 mg/kg per day in drinking water) was studied in the rat neocortical and hippocampal synaptosomal membranes. Such a treatment produced regional increases in the density of benzodiazepine sites, which remained for up to 24 and 48 h after drug withdrawal in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively; the dissociation constant (Kd) was unchanged. In addition, a significant reduction in GABA enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cortical, but not to hippocampal, membranes from Ro 15-1788-treated animals was found 72 h after drug withdrawal. These data show that there is a regional difference in responses of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex following chronic in vivo exposure to Ro 15-1788 and that, beside the increases in the maximal binding (Bmax) of [3H]flunitrazepam the coupling between the GABA and the benzodiazepine recognition sites was also affected.",

    "19": "Benzodiazepine ligands of differing efficacy including the agonist, diazepam, the partial agonist, Ro 16-6028 and the antagonist, Ro 15-1788, were administered in vivo to rats continuously for 3 weeks. The magnitude of change in various measures of GABA sensitivity could be correlated directly with increasing agonist efficacy: maximal changes were seen following chronic treatment with diazepam, intermediate changes were seen following the partial agonist Ro 16-6028 and no changes were observed following chronic Ro 15-1788 administration. The magnitude of change could also be correlated with increasing potential for tolerance development to anticonvulsant efficacy following chronic exposure to these benzodiazepine ligands.", 
    "20": "Information about benzodiazepines was given during a period of three months in a general practice with two doctors and 2,500 patients in group 1 of the Danish Health Insurance (low income group). The number of requests for repeated prescriptions and the number of defined daily doses of benzodiazepines were registered during periods of one month before and three months after the three month period of information with the object of assessing the patients own wishes for repeated prescription. The investigation revealed an average decrease of 35.4% of requests for repeated prescriptions and a decrease of 55.8% in the defined daily doses prescribed as compared with the month before the information period. The social consequences are discussed.", 
    "21": "Cultures of cerebral neurons were prepared from chick embryos, 8.5 days in ovo, and maintained in vitro. Following chronic exposure of these cells to GABA, the levels of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in situ and electrophysiological responsiveness to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was examined. Treatment with 100 microM GABA for 7 days reduced [3H]flunitrazepam binding in situ by 70 +/- 8% compared to untreated controls. The binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine was unaffected by this treatment. The reduction in [3H]flunitrazepam binding was prevented by concomitant exposure of developing neurons to the GABA antagonist R 5135, suggesting that GABAA receptor occupancy is required. The loss of bezodiazepine receptors was dependent on the GABA concentration in the culture medium and a half-saturation (IC50) value of 11.2 +/- 3.7 microM was estimated. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained to assess the functional properties of the labile receptor pool observed in the binding studies. Neurons cultured with 100 microM GABA for 7 days showed a 60-70% reduction in the peak current amplitudes observed in response to application of 10-100 microM GABA. However, the rate of rapid desensitization, quantified by measuring changes in input conductance, was unchanged by chronic GABA exposure, yielding decay time constants of 27.1 +/- 2.1 and 34.7 +/- 4.7 s for control and treated cells, respectively. The results are consistent with a GABA modulation of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex by means of down-regulation.", 
    "22": "The structural basis of GABA-gated chloride channels in mammalian brain is presently explored by the functional expression of cDNAs coding for the alpha, beta or gamma-subunits of the receptor and their isoforms. In this context, we expressed the cloned cDNA coding for the rat beta 1-subunit of the GABAA receptor in the Xenopus oocyte. Surprisingly, efficient expression of a functional ion channel was found. The channel was anion-selective, and able to open in the absence of GABA. Since this channel could be shunt by the GABA-channel blocker picrotoxin, we conclude that the beta 1-subunit of the GABAA receptor is sufficient to form binding sites for picrotoxin.", 
    "23": "In the course of 1979 the Netherlands Centre for Monitoring of Adverse Reactions to Drugs (NARD) received a remarkably large number of reports on patients with unusual and complex psychic disturbances, attributed to the use of the then recently marketed hypnotic triazolam. The interpretation of the data was difficult, however, and several questions could at that time not be properly answered. In the past 10 years a specific benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been identified, showing many similarities with the disturbances as reported in association with triazolam. In addition similar adverse experiences with triazolam have been reported in many other countries. Tablets containing 1 mg and 0.5 mg triazolam, as were widely used in The Netherlands, have in the mean time been globally removed from the market. It is concluded that the 'triazolam syndrome' may be explained as a combination of strong benzodiazepine effects and withdrawal phenomena. The ultra short half-life of triazolam and the high doses used may have contributed to the problems as observed in The Netherlands. The signal perceived by the NARD appears to have been a valuable warning, rightly casting doubt on the safety of triazolam and the original dosage recommendations.", 
    "24": "Sixty patients with agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder who completed a 4-month combined drug and behavioral group treatment program and were discharged on a regimen of alprazolam were interviewed 1.7 to 4 years (mean, 2.5 years) after discharge. At follow-up (FU), 18 (30%) of the patients had discontinued alprazolam treatment, 36 (60%) continued with a lower dose, 3 (5%) received the same dose, and 3 (5%) received an increased dose compared with discharge. A lower frequency of panic attacks at admission was associated with an increased ability to discontinue alprazolam treatment. There was little evidence of tolerance to the antipanic effects of alprazolam. Panic attack frequency dropped from a mean of 4.4 attacks per week at admission to 1.2 attacks per week at discharge and remained decreased at 1.6 attacks per week at FU. Treatment gains in the program were maintained or enhanced on 11 of 14 behavioral measures at FU and were similar in the groups that were receiving and not receiving alprazolam. Patients receiving nonpharmacologic therapy in the FU period tended to have greater symptom severity, possibly due to self-selection. A lifetime diagnosis of major depression at admission was associated with higher levels of depressive and anxiety symptoms and higher alprazolam doses at FU. Episodes of major depression were common in the FU period and did not appear to be prevented by initial alprazolam and behavioral therapy or by low-dose alprazolam maintenance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "25": "A survey of 794 subjects volunteering for studies of panic disorder with or without phobic avoidance revealed that fewer than 15% had received imipramine and fewer than 15% had undergone in vivo exposure, although the majority had engaged in some form of counseling and had used benzodiazepines. Subjects with spontaneous panic attacks reported more avoidance than subjects with situational attacks. One-half of the subjects were unemployed. The authors recommend wider use of the available effective treatments for panic disorder and phobic avoidance.", 
    "26": "Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder is characterized by bizarre acts during nocturnal sleep that may lead to physical injuries. Dream content suggests that motor overactivity is an attempted dream enactment and polygraphic studies reveal REM stage without atonia, an alteration of REM sleep generation that facilitates excessive motor activity. In 6 patients with REM sleep behavior disorder. MRI of the brain showed multifocal signal intensity lesions suggestive of lacunar infarcts in periventricular regions (5 patients) and in dorsal pontomesencephalic areas (3 patients). REM sleep behavior disorder may be the result of injury to the midrostral tegmentum nuclei, the tegmentoreticular tracts, or both. This condition is easily controlled with clonazepam.", 
    "27": "The binding properties of a series of muscarinic antagonists were compared with their ability to antagonize muscarinic receptor mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in homogenates of the corpus striatum and heart of rats. When measured by the competitive inhibition of the binding of the muscarinic antagonist N-[3H]methylscopolamine, the binding properties of selective muscarinic antagonists in the corpus stratum and cerebral cortex were consistent with a model incorporating a minimum of three populations of muscarinic receptors, a high affinity site for pirenzepine (M1), a high affinity site for AF-DX 116 [11] [2-[ (diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl] acetyl] -5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b] 1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one (M2) and a third population (non-Ml, non-M2 sites) displaying low affinity for the latter antagonists. The results of similar experiments on the heart showed that this tissue contained a uniform population of M2 muscarinic receptors. The binding properties of the M2 receptor in cerebral cortex and corpus stratum were also investigated directly in antagonist [3H] AF-DX 116 competition experiments and, although the high affinity AF-DX 116 site in brain (M2) exhibited selectivity for the cardioselective antagonists AF-DX 116 and gallamine, some differences were noted between M2 sites in brain and heart. The muscarinic adenylate cyclase response in the corpus striatum was relatively insensitive to the M2 selective antagonists AF-DX 116 and gallamine as well as the M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine, suggesting that non-M1, non-M2 sites inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in the corpus striatum. In contrast, the effects of muscarinic antagonists on the muscarinic adenylate cyclase response in the heart were consistent with the postulate that M2 receptors inhibit adenylate cyclase activity in this tissue.", 
    "28": "The ability of nicotine to induce antinociception after subcortical administration was investigated in the rat. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted unilaterally with guide cannulas aimed at the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus of the mesopontine tegmentum. After 1 week, nicotine was injected in 0.5 microliter of 0.2 M pH 7.4 phosphate buffer. Antinociception was assessed using the 52 degrees C hot-plate test and the tail-flick method; for the most part, the results in the hot-plate test parallelled those in the tail-flick test. Nicotine inhibited nociceptive responses at a median effective antinociceptive dose (A5O) of 1.6 nmol in the hot-plate test and 3.4 nmol in the tail-flick test. Mecamylamine, 0.8 nmol coadministered with nicotine, antagonized nicotine antinociception as evidenced by 5- to 8-fold increases in the nicotine A5O. Nicotine antinociception was also antagonized by coadministrations of either 0.8 nmol of (-)-scopolamine or 0.4 nmol of the M1 antagonist pirenzepine by over 12-fold in the hot-plate test and 5-fold in the tail-flick test. The M2 antagonist methoctramine had antinociceptive effects of its own when injected into the mesopontine tegmentum at a dose of 0.1 nmol; when coinjected with nicotine, the effects of the methoctramine-nicotine combination appeared to be additive. One hour preinjection into the mesopontine tegmentum with 13.5 nmol of (-)-vesamicol, an agent which interferes with acetylcholine storage and/or release, markedly inhibited nicotine antinociception; only a 24% antinociceptive response could be elicited by nicotine in the hot-plate test whereas the nicotine A5O was increased 3-fold in the tail-flick test. Pretreatment with the inactive isomer (+)-vesamicol had no effect. In other experiments, mesopontine tegmental injection of (+)-cis-dioxolane, a high affinity muscarinic cholinergic agonist, elicited strong antinociceptive responses which were potently antagonized by coadministration with 0.5 nmol of pirenzepine but not by 0.8 nmol of mecamylamine. The data indicate that nicotine-induced antinociception may depend upon intact neurotransmission at M1 sites in addition to nicotinic sites within the mesopontine tegmentum.", 
    "29": "The antipanic efficacy of alprazolam and lorazepam was evaluated in 48 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder in a double-blind random assignment study. On the basis of rating scale scores, both drugs demonstrated similar efficacy in reducing panic attacks and phobic behavior compared with placebo baseline. The doses required to achieve response were approximately double those required for the treatment of generalized anxiety. These results suggest that most, if not all, benzodiazepines may be effective antipanic drugs at high doses. The implications of these findings for drug treatments of choice for recurrent panic attacks are discussed.", 
    "30": "The kindling technique has been reported to produce a long-lasting enhancement in both the early and late phases of evoked potentials triggered from the kindled focus. It also alters paired-pulse facilitation and depression in the pathways which support these phenomena. The present experiment was designed to determine whether the drugs which antagonize secondary generalization in the kindling model also antagonize kindling-enhanced excitation in the pathways leading out of the focus. Multiple doses of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and clonazepam were therefore tested against single- and double-pulse evoked potentials triggered from the focus in rats that had been subjected to parital kindling from either the amygdala or the cortex. Responses were recorded in monosynaptic sites and in the mesencephalic reticular formation--a polysynaptic site thought to play an important role in secondary generalization. No drug-related effects were found on early evoked potential components, either in the single-pulse or the double-pulse paradigm. Kindling-enhanced late components (\"late waves\"), however, were clearly and selectively antagonized by clonazepam.", 
    "31": "Unilateral fimbria-fornix lesions were made by aspiration in female Sprague-Dawley rats. In a group of these rats, fetal septal tissue was transplanted into the lesion cavity. Lesion of the fimbria-fornix resulted in a reduction of cholinergic input to the hippocampal formation as indicated by the loss of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-positive staining in all ipsilateral hippocampal laminae and a loss of [3H]hemicholinium-3 binding to cholinergic terminals in the strata oriens (82% reduction) and radiatum (77% reduction) of areas CA2 and CA3 and in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (83% reduction). In contrast, the density of muscarinic receptor binding ([3H]QNB) increased in the strata oriens (80% increase) and radiatum (70% increase) in areas CA2-CA4. This was shown to be due to an actual increase in receptor number (Bmax) and not to a change in affinity (KD). Analysis of muscarinic receptor subtypes indicated that the increase in receptor binding in the stratum radiatum was of the M-1 subtype ([3H]-pirenzepine) and in the stratum oriens was of the M-2 subtype ([3H]QNB + 100 nM pirenzepine). In the host hippocampus after fetal septal graft, the staining for AChE, the binding of [3H]hemicholinium-3, and the binding of muscarinic receptors (both the M-1 and M-2 receptor subtypes) were all comparable to nonlesioned control values. These data indicate that the fetal septal grafts have reinnervated the host hippocampus and have made synaptic contact with host cells in a manner capable of regulating postsynaptic muscarinic receptors.", 
    "32": "Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed, yet the extent of their use in Canada has not been described. Such data would be valuable in assessing patient exposure to benzodiazepines and would provide a context to estimate the risk-benefit ratio of these drugs. Analysis of benzodiazepine sales in 1978-87 in Canada, expressed as the defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, showed that the use of these drugs was stable during the first half of the decade, at 33 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day, then steadily increased from 1983 to 1987, reaching 48 DDD/1000 inhabitants per day in 1987. The total use of slowly eliminated benzodiazepines declined, whereas the overall use of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines increased linearly. In 1978-83 Canada had the second-lowest total benzodiazepine use among several Western countries. The patterns of use and abuse of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines in 1978-84 showed a close correlation. Our findings indicate that data on drug use can be monitored and linked to clinical data, providing a mechanism for monitoring the relation between use and related illness.", 
    "33": "In a double-blind study, 59 patients with chronic erosive gastritis received 50 mg of pirenzepine twice daily and 55 patients received 400 mg of cimetidine twice daily for six weeks. In both groups, days of pain, of heartburn, and of nausea per week were significantly reduced during treatment (P less than 0.01). After six weeks, 64% of the pirenzepine group and 62% of the cimetidine group were free of symptoms and endoscopy revealed healing of lesions in 78% and 80%, respectively. Differences between groups were not significant.", 
    "34": "The antisedative effect of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was studied in a double-blind placebo controlled trial in 61 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and sedation with benzodiazepines. The efficacy of flumazenil in reversing the effect of both benzodiazepines, diazepam and midazolam, was significantly higher than placebo (p less than 0.0001). The effect of flumazenil was prompt and was clearly noticed at the first assessment, 5 min after its administration. In none of the patients was a relapse of the sedative effect of the benzodiazepines noticed. The administration of flumazenil was free of major side effects. Flumazenil administration permits an earlier discharge of patients following endoscopy. Its availability in the endoscopy suite may improve the outcome of serious but rare side effects related to benzodiazepines.", 
    "35": "Successful anesthetic management of the critically ill patient requires familiarity with the pharmacologic properties of a variety of anesthetic drugs. An understanding of the altered physiology present in the critically ill allows an anesthetic regimen to be selected that prevents an anesthetic-induced decompensation. Pain should never go untreated because of a fear of causing excessive physiologic depression. There are numerous options available to control pain. A technique suitable in one instance may be unsuitable in another; for example, an animal that has a significant degree of respiratory compromise may not tolerate the additional respiratory insult associated with narcotic use. A local anesthetic technique may be preferred in this situation. Often a local technique is all that is necessary to control postoperative pain. Furthermore, if pain is controlled for the first 4 to 6 h post-insult, often no further analgesic drugs need to be administered.", 
    "36": "The ability to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters of alprazolam from fragmentary clinical data collected during clinical efficacy trials was evaluated in this series of studies. In the first study modifications to the protocol and case report forms were employed to allow for the prospective collection of accurate dosing and blood sampling time data. In the second study only total daily dose and measured drug concentration data were recorded. Dosage and blood sampling time data were assembled retrospectively by assuming strict adherence to protocol guidelines. Comparisons of the results of these analyses demonstrate the marked impact of prospective data collection efforts on data quality and the ability to determine subsequent pharmacokinetic parameters. Analysis of the prospectively collected data yielded pharmacokinetic estimates for alprazolam that were nearly identical to previously reported values obtained according to traditional methods, whereas the analysis of retrospectively collected data yielded biased estimates of the mean pharmacokinetic parameters and markedly upward biased estimates of both interindividual and residual variability. These analyses demonstrate the ability to estimate population pharmacokinetic parameters from data collected during clinical efficacy trials, provided that critical issues pertaining to the design and use of data collection forms to enhance data quality and the education of patients and staff are satisfactorily addressed.", 
    "37": "Buspirone has previously been demonstrated to be efficacious in the treatment of anxiety. This four-week double-blind parallel study compared buspirone to diazepam and placebo in the treatment of 119 outpatients diagnosed as having generalized anxiety disorder. After a seven-day placebo washout period, eligible patients were randomized to one of three treatment groups. Buspirone (5 mg) and diazepam (5 mg) were administered BID and individually titrated to an optimal therapeutic dose by the end of week two. Buspirone and diazepam were equally effective in reducing Hamilton Anxiety (HAM-A) total and psychic factor scores from baseline values. Buspirone alone was significantly better than placebo in reducing the HAM-A somatic factor score. Sixty-seven percent of both active treatment groups who were classified as \"ill\" on the baseline global psychopathology rating scale achieved a \"not ill\" status by study end. There were no significant differences between treatment groups at endpoint on the 56-item Symptom Checklist self-rating scale. Buspirone was demonstrated to be as effective as diazepam in relieving anxiety in this outpatient sample.", 
    "38": "Substance abuse continues to be a growing problem--both in the United States and worldwide. Moderate alcohol consumption reduces anxiety, but alcohol abuse actually increases anxiety and impairs judgment and performance. Research data indicate that phobic anxiety is more common than general anxiety as a prelude to alcohol dependence. Benzodiazepines are widely used throughout the world in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Patients who take benzodiazepines for clinical anxiety rarely exceed the prescribed dosage: benzodiazepine abuse is more likely to occur in those who abuse other drugs. For most people suffering from anxiety disorders, low doses of benzodiazepines for short periods are usually sufficient. When discontinuing patients from benzodiazepines, it is essential for physicians to monitor patients closely and to provide emotional support and counselling about the withdrawal process and potential clinical syndromes associated with it. The need for retaining the option of giving benzodiazepines in the management of anxiety disorders arises from the chronic nature of a high proportion of the anxiety disorders. More research is needed to examine the effects of pharmacologic, behavioral, psychotherapeutic, and combinations of these treatments in patients with chronic anxiety and phobic disorders.", 
    "39": "Patients with alcohol dependence commonly experience symptoms of anxiety, depression, and insomnia. It is essential that clinicians recognize and treat anxiety disorders in alcoholic patients. Panic attacks with and without agoraphobia are especially prevalent among alcoholics and their families. Treatments of choice for panic disorder are the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, as well as tricyclic antidepressants and the benzodiazepine alprazolam. Benzodiazepines seem to be effective in controlling two pathophysiologic characteristics of alcohol withdrawal--noradrenergic and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical overactivity. They also can be used to prevent and treat withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. They are not indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependence per se.", 
    "40": "There is little evidence from current practice that pharmacotherapy has a place, as an adjunctive or primary modality, in the rehabilitation of alcoholic patients. Pharmacologic approaches in the treatment of other substance dependence disorders, as well as recent research on the neuropharmacology of acute and chronic ethanol administration, suggest the feasibility of a potential pharmacotherapy of alcoholism. This review describes the prospects for a rational pharmacotherapy in the rehabilitation of alcohol-dependent patients. In the main, the review is speculative and serves to highlight some areas of research progress related to alcoholism and other addictive disorders, some specific areas of research need, and some implications for clinical practice.", 
    "41": "High dose metoclopramide is an effective anti-emetic for use with cisplatin containing chemotherapy regimens but can cause extrapyramidal reactions. Lorazepam and dexamethasone are increasingly being used to alleviate chemotherapy induced emesis. This trial has assessed the contribution of high dose metoclopramide to anti-emetic control when given with dexamethasone and lorazepam. Eight-one patients receiving chemotherapy, mainly for gynaecological malignancy, entered a randomised double blind cross-over trial comparing dexamethasone and lorazepam with or without a 24 h metoclopramide infusion. This was followed by oral dexamethasone with or without oral metoclopramide for three further days depending on the initial randomisation. Sixty-one patients were fully evaluable. Fifty-five received cisplatin containing regimens and six non-cisplatin regimens. There was a significant reduction in the number of episodes of vomiting during the first 24 h in patients receiving the metoclopramide combination (P = 0.0001). On first exposure to chemotherapy 45% of patients receiving dexamethasone, lorazepam and high dose metoclopramide had no vomiting while 67% had two episodes or less ('major control'). This compared to 11% total control and 25% major control in those receiving dexamethasone, lorazepam and placebo. The control of nausea in the first 24 h was also improved (P = 0.0001). There was no difference in the degree of nausea or vomiting during the following three weeks between those receiving oral dexamethasone alone and those receiving dexamethasone and metoclopramide. Both groups showed a significant increase in nausea in the three weeks following the second course of treatment when compared to the first (P = 0.0007). Extrapyramidal reactions were recorded in 11.5% of patients receiving metoclopramide. More patients stated a preference for the metoclopramide combination although this was not statistically significant (chi 2(1) = 0.29, P = 0.59). In conclusion the combination of dexamethasone and lorazepam can give major control of emesis in 25% of patients receiving very emetogenic chemotherapy. The addition of metoclopramide increases this to 67% on first exposure to chemotherapy, but at the expense of extrapyramidal reactions in 11.5%.", 
    "42": "Anisodamine is a tropine alkaloid isolated from Scopolia tangutica Maxim. To determine the original sites of anisodamine seizure discharge, permanent electrodes were implanted into different parts of the brain in rabbits and the electrical activities were continuously recorded by monopolar leads. Injection of anisodamine 1.5 mg/kg into the lateral ventricle of conscious rabbits always produced abnormal discharges. The spike discharges appeared first in the amygdala and consisted of rhythmic large surface-positive spikes. Multiple spikes then appeared in the hippocampus, caudate nucleus, midbrain reticular formation and frontal cortex. Diazepam 1.5-2.5 mg/kg did not inhibit the spike discharges from the amygdala, but did inhibit the discharges from other sites as well as clonic convulsions. When the dosage of diazepam was increased to 4.5 mg/kg, the spike discharges from the amygdala were also inhibited. The above findings indicate that the site of origin of anisodamine seizure discharges in rabbits is the amygdala. The seizure discharges then spread to the mesencephalic reticular formation, the hippocampus, the caudate nucleus and the cortex. Diazepam was shown to be an effective antagonist against central stimulation induced by anisodamine.", 
    "43": "The anxiolytic and analgesic effects of 10 mg of orally administered diazepam (Valium) were assessed on 10 volunteers. The electrodermal activity was recorded during two experimental sessions while cutaneous electrical stimulations were administered to the subjects. On one hand, the anxiolytic activity of diazepam could be observed by a decrease of both autonomic nervous system and anticipatory activities. On the other hand, an increase of the pain threshold could be shown under diazepam by lower responses to the stimulations. These results confirm that diazepam can be useful in anxious patients undergoing dental procedures.", 
    "44": "A study of formulation factors influencing the release of clonazepam from a Carbopol hydrogel through a cellulose nitrate membrane impregnated with lauryl alcohol was performed using two diffusion cell assemblies. The formulation variables were the cosolvent effects of propylene glycol and polyethylene glycol of different molecular weights in aqueous solutions of various composition. The gel formulation phenomenologically behaves as a zero-order release system, although the diffusion controlled mechanism may also be operative. The results showed that both methods were practically equivalent in terms of drug release profile and total drug released allowing the best formulation to be found.", 
    "45": "The effects of pirenzepine on gastric and duodenal ulceration and barrier mucus levels, as well as on changes of superior mesenteric artery diameter caused by cysteamine, were investigated in rats and compared with those of atropine. Cysteamine induced severe gastric and duodenal ulcers and decreased both barrier mucus levels and mesenteric blood flow. Pirenzepine reduced gastric and duodenal ulceration induced by cysteamine. Moreover, pirenzepine significantly increased basal mesenteric artery diameter and fully prevented cysteamine-induced decrease in mesenteric blood flow. Under the same conditions, atropine failed to prevent gastric and duodenal ulceration or mesenteric artery changes caused by cysteamine. Both pirenzepine and atropine were without any effect on cysteamine-induced inhibition of gastric and duodenal barrier mucus levels. The present results are consistent with the view that pirenzepine protects against gastroduodenal ulceration caused by cysteamine by increasing blood flow at the level of the ulcerated mucosa. The higher affinity of pirenzepine for the muscarinic receptors of sympathetic ganglia may explain the difference between the effects of pirenzepine and atropine. In addition to this, the measurement of superior mesenteric artery diameter changes may represent an accurate and reproducible method, suitable for studying the gastrointestinal protective mechanisms of the drugs.", 
    "46": "The new M1-receptor antagonist telenzepine has been studied for its antisecretory effect in different in vitro and in vivo experimental models in comparison with pirenzepine. Telenzepine was found to be from 3 to 10 times more potent than pirenzepine in inhibiting bethanechol-, pentagastrin- and dimaprit-induced acid secretion in the conscious gastric fistula cat. Also, in the lumen-perfused stomach of the anaesthetized rat, telenzepine was more active than pirenzepine as an inhibitor of bethanechol-induced acid secretion; the inhibitory effect of telenzepine lasted more than 3 hr, while that of pirenzepine disappeared within 1 hr. In the isolated gastric fundus from immature rats, telenzepine and pirenzepine did not modify the spontaneous acid secretion, whereas both drugs caused a competitive inhibition of bethanechol-induced acid secretion (pA2 values were 7.96 and 6.81 for telenzepine and pirenzepine, respectively). These data indicate that telenzepine is a potent antisecretory agent both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "47": "Repeated, intermittent administration of psychomotor stimulants has been shown to produce increasing effects (behavioral sensitization) in many species of animals. In a novel two-day sensitization paradigm, rats that received a single high dose of cocaine (40 mg/kg) compared with saline on day 1 showed an increased locomotor response to a challenge dose (10 mg/kg) on day 2. This effect is conditioned or context-dependent; i.e., it is only observed if the rats received cocaine in an environment similar to the test environment. If the cocaine-induced hyperactivity on day 1 is prevented with pharmacological agents such as haloperidol and diazepam, sensitization on day 2 does not occur. Furthermore, although moderate (0.2 mg/kg) and high doses (0.5 mg/kg) of haloperidol (day 1) prevented the development of sensitization to cocaine, they were ineffective when given prior to the day 2 challenge dose in preventing the expression of sensitization. Thus, this type of cocaine sensitization appears to involve conditioning, show stimulus generalization, and offer a possible model for clinical neuroleptic nonresponsiveness once stimulant-induced pathological behavior has been induced.", 
    "48": "Drugs of abuse from different pharmacological classes increase social conversation. Alcohol and d-amphetamine also increase rates of talking in subjects producing speech monologues in an isolated context. This latter finding suggests that the increases observed during dyadic social conversation may represent general increases in talking and not specific effects on social interaction. The present study was conducted to assess whether other abused drugs also increase monologue speaking. The acute effects of secobarbital (0, 50, 150, 250 mg), d-amphetamine (0, 25 mg) (Experiment 1), and diazepam (0, 10, 20, 40 mg) (Experiment 2) were investigated in healthy, adult volunteers. Secobarbital and d-amphetamine both increased the total amount of speech emitted, while diazepam generally had no effect or decreased talking. Experiment 3 was conducted to further compare the effects of secobarbital (0, 50, 150, 250 mg) and diazepam (0, 5, 15, 25 mg) using a within-subject, crossover design. Secobarbital increased talking in three of the four subjects studied, while diazepam, again, had no effect or decreased talking. In contrast to the differences noted with talking, secobarbital and diazepam both decreased response rates in a nonverbal performance task (i.e., circular-lights procedure); they also produced many similar effects on various subject-rated measures of drug effect. Thus, the differences in the effects of these two compounds on talking are not the result of a general difference in their overall profile of behavioral effects. In summary, the results obtained with secobarbital and d-amphetamine further demonstrate that an explicitly social context is not a necessary condition to observe drug-produced increases in speech quantity. The failure of diazepam to reliably increase talking in the present study illustrates the existence of some pharmacological specificity in the effect of drugs on human speech, and suggests another way in which the behavioral effects of the barbiturates and benzodiazepines may differ.", 
    "49": "The effect of in vitro and in vivo administration of ethanol on the binding of 35S-t-butyl-bicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) to cortical brain membranes of C57Bl mice was investigated using KCl (100 mM) containing assay media. The in vitro addition of ethanol produced a dose-dependent inhibition of basal 35S-TBPS binding. In the presence of chloride ions, GABA and pentobarbital had a biphasic action (stimulation followed by inhibition) on 35S-TBPS binding, whereas diazepam only stimulated the binding. Ethanol reduced the stimulatory effects of GABA and pentobarbital in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on the enhancement of 35S-TBPS binding produced by diazepam. 35S-TBPS binding to cortical brain membranes was inhibited by the putative Cl- channel blocking agent DIDS. This inhibitory action of DIDS was significantly, and dose-dependently reduced by ethanol (greater than or equal to 100 mM ethanol). Chronic ethanol ingestion in vivo, which produced tolerance to and physical dependence on ethanol in the animals, did not alter the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of GABA and pentobarbital on 35S-TBPS binding. The enhancement of 35S-TBPS binding produced by diazepam was slightly, but significantly, enhanced in brain membranes from animals which had undergone 24 hours of ethanol withdrawal. Chronic ethanol treatment did not change the potency of picrotoxin and of the peripheral BDZ-receptor ligand RO 5-4864 to competitively inhibit 35S-TBPS binding. Our results suggest that in vitro addition of ethanol alters the activity of the GABA/benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor complex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "50": "Previous studies suggest that a diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI, also referred to as endozepine) present in the brain may function anxiogenically as a modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex (GABAA). An expression library representing mouse brain mRNA was screened using antisera that recognizes the 11 kDa DBI protein. A cDNA clone was isolated and sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of mouse DBI to that for human, rat and bovine DBI shows that the size of DBI is conserved at 87 amino acids in all of these mammals. DBI cDNA hybridizes to an mRNA of about 600 nucleotides. This mRNA is not restricted to the brain, being prevalent in other organs such as the liver and kidney. Its moderate to high abundance, as judged from mRNA levels, in several organs suggests that DBI might have functions other than, or in addition to, the possible regulation of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "51": "Two randomized double-blind crossover studies and one randomized crossover study were performed to document possible drug-drug interactions between antacids (aluminum magnesium hydroxide, 10 ml per dose for 10 doses), antimuscarinic drugs (pirenzepine, 50 mg per dose for 4 doses), and H2-blockers (ranitidine, 150 mg per dose for 3 doses) and amoxicillin (1,000 mg), cephalexin (1,000 mg), doxycycline (200 mg), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (625 mg). Ten healthy volunteers participated in each study. Concentrations in serum and urine were measured by bioassay, and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated by the usual open one- or two-compartment models (statistics were determined by the Wilcoxon test). The antacid, pirenzepine, and ranitidine had no influence on the bioavailability of amoxicillin, cephalexin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. Only small differences could be observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters, but they are not of therapeutic importance. However, the antacid caused a significant (P less than 0.01) reduction in the gastrointestinal absorption of doxycycline (area under the concentration-time curve, 38.6 +/- 22.7 mg.h/liter, fasting; 6.0 +/- 3.2 mg.h/liter, with antacid), resulting in subtherapeutic levels of doxycycline.", 
    "52": "This study confirms the value of analgesic nitrous oxide/oxygen therapy for initial management of alcoholism in a mainly rural cohort. The gas administration at no time impairs consciousness. 150 consecutive patients, mainly of Zulu origin (of both sexes) suffering from chronic alcoholism were treated with nitrous oxide/oxygen mixtures. The majority of patients showed significant and extremely rapid improvement, which was maintained and resulted in early entry into the rehabilitation programme. This method resulted in a considerable reduction in addictive sedative benzodiazepine medication during their hospital stay. The treatment also provided relief from craving. I conclude that the incorporation of this therapy into the management of chronic alcoholism is a useful, safe and effective adjunct without adverse side effects.", 
    "53": "Debrisoquine and S-mephenytoin hydroxylation phenotyping tests were performed in 9 patients before and during treatment with diazepam at a daily dose of 10 or 15 mg. There was no change in either the debrisoquine/4-hydroxydebrisoquine ratio or the ratio of S/R mephenytoin in urine. The hydroxylation of these two test drugs is apparently not inhibited by administration of therapeutic doses of diazepam.", 
    "54": "The cardiorespiratory dynamics and anesthetic effects of intravenously administered diazepam-ketamine (0.375 mg kg-1/7.5 mg kg-1) and xylazine-ketamine (0.1 mg kg-1/7.5 mg kg-1) were investigated in six domestic sheep (Ovis aries). The depth of analgesia and sedation was evaluated and the effects of the anesthetic drug combinations on hemodynamics and pulmonary mechanics were monitored before, and up to 90 minutes after, drug administration. Diazepam-ketamine and xylazine-ketamine induced effective anesthesia for periods lasting 15 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively. Both drug combinations caused transient respiratory acidosis. However, no profound effects on respiration or pulmonary function were observed. Neither anesthetic regimen caused significant effects on heart rate or pulmonary hemodynamics, but they caused significant decreases in cardiac output. Xylazine-ketamine resulted in a significant decrease in mean systemic arterial blood pressure (Psa) with a concurrent decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Diazepam-ketamine caused a significant increase in SVR without affecting Psa. Xylazine-ketamine may be contraindicated in animals with compromised heart function because of its hypotensive effects. Otherwise, both drug combinations, in the doses used, can provide short-term anesthesia suitable for minor surgical procedures and painful experimental maneuvers.", 
    "55": "1. In a prospective study of patients hospitalized for deliberate self-poisoning between 1978 and 1987 the number of admissions increased from 303 to 425. The annual incidence increased significantly for both women (P less than 0.05) and men (P less than 0.01). The mean age decreased significantly in the male group (P less than 0.05), but increased in the female group (P less than 0.05). 2. The median latency time for patients presenting at the hospital was short; 3.7 h in 1978 and 2.9 h in 1987. 3. There was a significant reduction in the percentage using barbiturates (9% in 1978 and 1% in 1987; P less than 0.001) and the use of benzodiazepines increased (18% in 1978 and 32% in 1987; P less than 0.05). The percentage of unconscious patients did not change significantly. 4. In 1987 N-acetyl-cysteine was the most frequently used antidote. Physostigmine has almost been abandoned since 1978. 5. Significantly more patients were hypotensive in 1978: 24% vs 11% in 1987; (P less than 0.001) and significantly less patients needed treatment in the central intensive care unit (2% in 1987 and 5% in 1978; P less than 0.05). Complications were few (8-10%) and the mortality low (approximately 1%) in both years studied. 6. The mean duration of hospitalization in 1978 was 65 h vs 30 h in 1987, (P less than 0.001).", 
    "56": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of 16 patients in the intensive care unit, sedated with midazolam, were evaluated. A large variation was observed in the plasma concentration of midazolam and between the plasma concentration of midazolam and its metabolite 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam glucuronide. The plasma albumin concentration governs the volume of distribution of midazolam. Decreased plasma albumin concentration (25 gm/L) results in an increased volume of distribution and a decreased elimination rate of midazolam. The observed plasma concentration ratio between the parent drug and its metabolite 1-hydroxymethylmidazolam glucuronide is governed by the variables of protein binding, the metabolic rate of midazolam, and the renal clearance of the glucuronide metabolite itself (which can be considered as a measure of the kidney function of the patient).", 
    "57": "In the test of avoidance of an \"illuminated platform\" and \"precarious situation\" intraperitoneal administration of derivatives of benzodiazepine, GABA and beta-carboline was shown to attenuate anxiety states in rats. The similar effect was also observed at local administration of serotonin and beta-carboline into the median raphe nuclei. At the same time microinjections of GABA, chlordiazepoxide, phenibut and baclofen into this formation of the brain exerted the anxiolytic effect only in the test of an \"illuminated platform\". Different spectra of the anxiolytic effect of the tested psychotropic agents is suggested to be due to diverse degrees of the involvement of serotoninergic and GABA-ergic systems of the median raphe nucleus in the anxiety states formed by various aversive actions.", 
    "58": "Zopiclone is a new cyclopyrrolone derivative which exerts pharmacological activities similar to those of benzodiazepines in behavioral and biochemical studies. In order to clarify the discriminative stimulus properties of zopiclone, 8 rats were trained to discriminate the interoceptive stimulus induced by zopiclone (3.2 mg/kg, i.p.) from those of saline. Following discrimination acquisition, administration of zopiclone resulted in drug-appropriate responding with an ED50 of 1.3 (1.0-1.8) mg/kg. The zopiclone discriminative stimulus generalized to the benzodiazepines diazepam (1.8 mg/kg), nitrazepam (10 mg/kg) and alprazolam (10 mg/kg). A non-benzodiazepine, suriclone, at 3.2 mg/kg, generalized to the zopiclone stimulus in 5 out of 7 rats, but meprobamate, hydroxyzine, tracazolate and muscimol did not. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (1 mg/kg) completely blocked zopiclone stimulus. In contrast, however, bicuculline and pentetrazol failed to antagonize it. The serotonin antagonist cinanserin and ritanserin neither generalized to the zopiclone stimulus nor did they exhibit antagonism. These results suggest that the zopiclone discriminative stimulus is mediated by binding to benzodiazepine receptors and appears not to be related to GABAergic or serotonergic system.", 
    "59": "Ten young women took part in this study a few days after delivery (day 3 and day 5 post partum). Lactation had developed normally but the newborn infants were not breast-fed. The study was intended to investigate whether metaclazepam (Talis), a new 1,4-benzodiazepine, and some of its metabolites were present in breast milk. Levels were measured in the plasma and milk. The levels in the milk showed that metaclazepam, N-desmethylmetaclazepam and two of its metabolites with a lactam structure could be found in small amounts. Differences in metaclazepam and N-desmethylmetaclazepam concentrations in the breast milk on days 3 and 5 post partum are discussed.", 
    "60": "In a four-week double-blind randomized trial preceded by a one-week single-blind placebo treatment, the efficacy and the side-effects of suriclone (1.50-2.25 mg/d) (n = 24), lorazepam (5.0-7.5 mg/d) (n = 19) and placebo (n = 21) were compared in 64 outpatients with a DSM-III diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (n = 56) or panic disorder (n = 8). Efficacy was measured weekly by means of a global clinical impression scale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, the Zung Anxiety Self-Assessment Scale and a target symptom scale. Side-effects were evaluated weekly by an adverse events scale, which recorded the spontaneous complaints and the complaints elicited by an extensive somatic inventory questionnaire. The three groups showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement early on in the treatment: this improvement was maintained during the remaining period. Early on in the treatment there was some indication of a better response, but also of more side-effects, in the suriclone and the lorazepam groups. After four weeks of treatment no difference was found between the three groups either in efficacy or in side-effects. The effect size achieved in the placebo group was not inferior to that of benzodiazepines in general.", 
    "61": "The recent research literature on the effects of benzodiazepines is reviewed, with special emphasis on findings relevant for the practising clinician. The mode of action, patterns of use and abuse potential of benzodiazepines are discussed. The evidence on the risks of dependency and possible drawbacks of long-term use are examined. The possible effects of benzodiazepine use on psychological treatments are also examined, and factors that should be considered while treating benzodiazepine users are discussed.", 
    "62": "Fourteen patients with neuroleptic-induced oculogyric crisis resistant to antiparkinsonian drugs were treated with oral clonazepam. The neuroleptic-induced oculogyric crisis was completely inhibited by clonazepam in 10 patients, moderately inhibited in 2, slightly inhibited in 1, and not changed in 1. We suggest that clonazepam is useful in managing neuroleptic-induced oculogyric crisis.", 
    "63": "After admission, 899 inpatients of a psychiatric university hospital were routinely screened for benzodiazepines (BDZ) in the urine. BDZ were detected in 134 (15%) patients with various primary diagnoses. Criteria for BDZ abuse or dependence were found in 36 patients. In 35 cases, either intake of BDZ had not been reported in the first psychiatric interview, or such a report had not been documented in the patient's charts. None of these 35 patients was found to have BDZ abuse or dependence. Psychiatric inpatients with BDZ abuse or dependence seem to report their intake of BDZ. These findings suggest that a routine screening for BDZ can hardly help to diagnose dependence within a university hospital setting. Nevertheless, an objective test for intake of BDZ may be useful in special cases.", 
    "64": "Experience of a central London unit dedicated to the care of patients following parasuicide between 1984 and 1988 is reviewed. There were 1160 admissions, which accounted for 11% of all acute adult medical admissions. The female to male ratio was 1.3, with a peak rate for females below 25 years and for males between 20 and 35. Unemployment was found to be a risk factor for parasuicide in men. Benzodiazepines were the most frequently used drug in parasuicide (35%), followed by paracetamol (13%) and aspirin (9%).", 
    "65": "1. The effects of benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepine compounds on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced chloride current (ICl) were studied in frog isolated sensory neurones by use of a concentration-jump (termed 'concentration-clamp') technique, under single-electrode voltage-clamp conditions. The drugs used were classified into four categories as follows: full benzodiazepine receptor agonists (diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam, midazolam, clotiazepam and etizolam), partial agonists (CL 218,872, Ro 16-6028, Ro 17-1812 and Ro 23-0364), inverse agonists (Ro 15-3505, FG 7142 and beta-CCE) and a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil). 2. All full agonists at concentrations of 3 x 10(-6) M or less increased dose-dependently the peak amplitude of ICl elicited by 3 x 10(-6) M GABA to twice to three times larger than the control. However, no further augmentation of the GABA response was observed at concentrations of 1 x 10(-5) M or higher. Partial agonists also showed a dose-dependent augmentation of the GABA response at concentrations ranging from 3 x 10(-8) M to 3 x 10(-5) M, but their efficacies of augmentation of the GABA response were only about half or less of those of full agonists. Of the inverse agonists, beta-CCE had a unique dose-dependent effect on the GABA response. Beta-CCE reduced dose-dependently the GABA response at concentrations of less than 3 x 10(-6) M, but augmented it at concentrations of 3 x 10(-5) M and 6 x 10(-5) M. The inverse agonists reduced dose-dependently the GABA response. The benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil, slightly augmented the GABA response at concentrations between 3 x 10 7M and 3 x 10 5 M. 3. These results show clear differences in the effects on the GABA response between these four categories of compounds known to affect the benzodiazepine recognition site of the GABA/ benzodiazepine receptor-chloride channel complex. Our experimental system of frog isolated sensory neurones and a 'concentration-clamp' technique appears to be useful for evaluating efficacy of compounds on responses mediated by the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor-chloride channel complex.", 
    "66": "1. Convulsions were induced reproducibly by intracerebroventricular injection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) to conscious mice. 2. Competitive (carboxypiperazine-propylphosphonic acid, CPP; 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, AP7) and non-competitive (MK801; phencyclidine, PCP; thienylcyclohexylpiperidine, TCP; dextrorphan; dextromethorphan) NMDA antagonists prevented NMDA-induced convulsions. 3. Benzodiazepine receptor agonists and partial agonists (triazolam, diazepam, clonazepam, Ro 16-6028), classical anticonvulsants (diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbitone, sodium valproate) and meprobamate were also found to prevent NMDA-induced convulsions. 4. Flumazenil (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) and the GABA agonists THIP and muscimol (up to subtoxic doses) were without effect. 5. Flumazenil reversed the anticonvulsant action of diazepam, but not that of MK801. 6. Results obtained in this model differ somewhat from those described in a seizure model with systemic administration of NMDA. An explanation for this discrepancy is offered. 7. This model is a simple test for assessing the in vivo activity of NMDA antagonists and also expands the battery of chemically-induced seizure models for characterizing anticonvulsants not acting at NMDA receptors.", 
    "67": "Administration of diazepam, an agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, and muscimol, an agonist of GABA(A) receptors, resulted in an increase in cytosol GABA-modulin in hypothalamus and cerebellum. Low dose of muscimol, ineffective by itself, completely antagonized the isoniazid, bicuculline and picrotoxin-induced decrease in GABA-modulin activity. In contrast, low dose of diazepam was able to block only the action of isoniazid. That confirms different mechanism of action of muscimol and diazepam. The increase in cytosol GABA-modulin activity in the anterior and posterior hypothalamus of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and of vasopressin hypertensive rats required much higher doses of muscimol than in normotensive animals showing subsensitivity of GABA(A) receptors in these brain structures. In contrast, the sensitivities of GABA(A) receptors in the cerebellum and of benzodiazepine receptors in the hypothalamus and cerebellum were equal to hypertensive and normotensive rats.", 
    "68": "The displacement curves of the effect of picrotoxin on the S35-tert-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate binding to the brain membranes of inbred mice C57Bl/6 and Balb/c were analysed. The marked interstrain differences between modifications of IC50 and nHill dependent on the ionic force of the incubation medium were revealed. After partial stimulation of the receptor in the presence of 50 mM concentration of NaCl, the susceptibility of the receptor to picrotoxin was higher in the membrane suspension of C57Bl/6 mice than of Balb/c. Full stimulation of the receptor by 200 mM concentration of NaCl resulted in disappearance of interstrain differences. The value of nHill of C57Bl/6 membrane receptors increased after the change of the concentration of NaCl in the incubation medium from 50 to 200 mM, while it was invariable to Balb/c mice. It was marked that modification of the parameters of the binding of the radioligand to the membranes of C57Bl/6 mice was more latent, than for Balb/c mice.", 
    "69": "Recently pharmacologically active benzodiazepines, including diazepam, have been identified in common foodstuffs, e.g. wheat and potato. The chronical intake by way of plant food may explain the existence of benzodiazepines in the brain and in other tissues of various mammalians and man. Hitherto these alkaloid-like compounds were considered to be merely products of industrial synthesis. All the benzodiazepines used in therapy show a similar chemical structure. However, depending on particular substituents, agonistic benzodiazepines can be subdivided into groups of different pharmacological potency. Besides benzodiazepines, in the past years other alkaloid drugs, e.g. derivatives of morphine, norharmane and tetrahydronorharmane, have been isolated from animals. Some of these substances have been discussed as physiological ligands of specific neuronal binding sites. Indications have been provided that at least part of these compounds or their precursors may be of plant origin too. The presence of these compounds in plants used for food may suggest complex interactions between plant and animal, exceeding the nutritional aspect.", 
    "70": "Ethanol had biphasic effects on jump-up avoidance extinction with low doses (1 g/kg) increasing, and high doses (2.5 g/kg) decreasing number of trials to extinction criterion. In Experiment 1 these doses of ethanol were studied alone, and in combination with RO 15-4513 (0.3, 3 or 6 mg/kg). The stimulation of responding produced by low ethanol doses was reversed by 3 and 6 mg/kg doses of RO 15-4513 which had intrinsic suppressive effects, but the depressed responding produced by higher ethanol doses was not attenuated by RO 15-4513. Experiment 2 analysed the interaction between ethanol and benzodiazepine antagonists RO 15-1788 and CGS 8216. RO 15-1788 did not have intrinsic action and did not interact with ethanol. CGS 8216 showed an intrinsic suppressive action much like RO 15-4513, and also reversed the stimulation produced by low dose ethanol, but not the effects of the high dose. Experiment 3 showed that the benzodiazepine agonist, chlordiazepoxide, had effects much like low dose ethanol which were reversed by CGS 8216 and RO 15-4513. The major conclusions were that RO 15-4513 and CGS 8216 possess inverse agonist properties which may cancel out the effects of alcohol under certain circumstances.", 
    "71": "beta-Carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (beta-CCE) dose-dependently potentiated psychological-stress induced analgesia (PSY-SIA), and the effect was reversed by diazepam. Concurrent exposure to PSY stress or concomitant treatment with beta-CCE blocked the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine; the effect of PSY stress was antagonized by diazepam, and that of beta-CCE was reversed by Ro 15-1788. These results suggest that psychological factors which are mediated through benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the mechanism for blocking the development of analgesic tolerance to morphine by PSY stress.", 
    "72": "To provide a possible role of peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors in the regulation of glucocorticoid biosynthesis. We have examined the effect of diazepam on the corticoidogenic response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP in isolated bovine adrenal fasciculata cells. Diazepam alone (up to 100 microM) had no effect on the corticoidogenesis. Diazepam caused a dose-dependent potentiation of dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced corticoidogenesis. However, diazepam had no effect on the corticoidogenic response to ACTH and a high concentration of KCl. The potentiating effect by diazepam was clearly detected after 90 min-incubation, and it was blocked by YM-684 (diazepam antagonist) and ML-236B (cholesterol de novo synthesis inhibitor). Diazepam caused no significant decrease of intracellular content of cholesteryl esters during the corticoidogenic response to dibutyryl cyclic AMP. When the cells were incubated in the presence of (+)-PN200-110, a potent voltage-dependent Ca channel inhibitor, the potentiating effect by diazepam was not affected in spite of a significant inhibition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced corticoidogenesis. These results indicate that the potentiating effect of diazepam on dibutyryl cyclic AMP-induced corticoidogenesis is due in part to the activation of the intracellular cholesterol supply system (cholesterol de novo synthesis) without any change of voltage-dependent Ca channels.", 
    "73": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a safe noninvasive visualization technique which gives an accurate and quantitative representation of the spatial distribution of a positron-emitting radionuclide in any desired transverse section of the body. Short-lived positron emitters such as Carbon-11 (half-life:20 min.). Nitrogen-13 (10 min), Fluorine-18 (110 min) or Bromine 75 can be incorporated into biological molecules:amino acids, sugars, fatty acids, hormones and receptor agonists or antagonists. The PET approach may be compared to quantitative autoradiography with the added advantage of allowing in vivo kinetic studies in man, under normal and pathological conditions. Regional myocardial perfusion is measured with rubidium-82, 13N-labelled ammonia, H2(15) O or albumin microspheres labelled with Gallium-68. Regional myocardial metabolism is assessed with 11C-palmitate and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose. A high and spatially homogenous accumulation of 11C-palmitate is seen in normal myocardium. PET delineates an increased regional accumulation of 18F-2-FDG in ischemic areas while 11C-palmitate accumulation is markedly reduced. Positron Emission Tomography offers a unique opportunity to study receptors in vivo in normal and disease conditions. A potent muscarinic antagonist, 11C-MQNB is used to study the myocardial acetylcholine receptor and beta-blockers, 11C-Pindolol and 11C-CGP 12177 are used to study the beta-adrenergic receptor. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor has been characterized with 11C-PK 11195.", 
    "74": "The pharmacological characteristics of digitonin-solubilized peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PBS) from kidney membranes of various species were investigated to determine whether the species differences and heterogeneity observed in membrane-bound binding sites would be maintained after solubilization. [3H]PK 11195 (0.05 to 10 nM) bound with high affinity to rat, guinea pig, calf, and cat kidney solubilized preparations yielding maximal numbers of binding sites (Bmax) of 3,593 +/- 381, 25,645 +/- 1,795, 1,327 +/- 141, and 2,446 +/- 148 fmol/mg protein, respectively, and equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values of 1.74 +/- 0.18, 2.15 +/- 0.15, 0.85 +/- 0.09, and 1.02 +/- 0.06 nM, respectively. On the other hand, the respective Bmax and KD values for [3H]Ro 5-4864 (1.25 to 40 nM) were 2,688 +/- 275, 14,182 +/- 1,134, 144 +/- 23 and 205 +/- 17 fmol/mg protein (about 75, 55, 11, and 8%, respectively, of that of [3H]PK 11195) and 13.8 +/- 1.5, 14.6 +/- 1.1, 10.6 +/- 1.7, and 19.9 +/- 1.2 nM. Unlabeled Ro 5-4864 was two orders of magnitude more potent in displacing [3H]PK 11195 binding from rat kidney solubilized preparations than from calf kidney solubilized preparations, whereas the potency of unlabeled PK 11195 in displacing [3H]PK 11195 binding from both rat and calf kidney solubilized preparations was almost identical. Analysis of these displacement data revealed that PK 11195 bound to a single population of binding sites (nH approximately equal to 1.0), whereas Ro 5-4864 bound to two populations of binding sites (nH less than 1.0) in both rat and calf kidney solubilized preparations. These results indicate that PBS species differences and heterogeneity observed in membrane-bound binding sites are retained in the soluble state and are probably attributable to variations in the molecular structure of PBS rather than to differences in membrane environment.", 
    "75": "The triazolobenzodiazepine compound alprazolam may have unique clinical effects compared to other benzodiazepines, and both behavioral and neurochemical studies have indicated unusual results after acute doses of alprazolam. To determine the effects of chronic dosage in mice, alprazolam (2 mg/kg/day) was administered via osmotic pumps for 1-14 days, and open-field activity, plasma and brain concentrations, benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo and in vitro, [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate ([35S]TBPS) binding, and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake were determined. Alprazolam decreased motor activity after 1 and 2 days, but tolerance developed by day 4 and persisted to day 14. Plasma and brain concentrations remained constant during the 2-week period. Benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo was decreased at day 4 compared to day 1 in cortex (CX) and hypothalamus (HYPO), and remained depressed to day 14 in CX but not HYPO. Benzodiazepine binding in vitro and [35S]TBPS binding were decreased in CX at day 7. Muscimol-stimulated [36Cl-] uptake was decreased at days 4 and 7 compared to day 1, but at day 14 uptake was similar to day 1. These results indicate that behavioral tolerance and receptor downregulation develop rapidly during chronic alprazolam administration. Behavioral and neurochemical changes were similar to those associated with lorazepam administration, but occurred more rapidly and with different regional specificity.", 
    "76": "Levels of thiobarbituric acid (TBA)-reactive material were measured in brain regions of 3-4 month-old rats following prenatal exposure to several benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands over gestational days 14-20. Prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) at 1.0 mg/kg/day markedly elevated levels of brain TBA-reactive material while exposure to a higher dose (2.5 mg/kg) induced a significant increase only in the hippocampus. Early exposure to the central-type BDZ agonist clonazepam as well as to the central-type antagonist Ro 15-1788 also increased brain levels of TBA-reactive material. Concurrent exposure to the higher dose of DZ partially attenuated the effect of Ro 15-1788. Prenatal exposure to the peripheral-type BDZ ligand PK11195 produced a profound increase in TBA-reactive products in all regions, and concurrent DZ exposure did not attenuate this effect, except in the basal ganglia. Measurement of TBA-reactive material from birth to 3 months indicated that the effect of prenatal exposure to DZ was not apparent until after 8 weeks of age. Acute in vitro exposure of adult and fetal tissue to DZ had no effect on TBA-reactive material. The results suggest an interference in the organization of cellular metabolism in the brain by developmental exposure to BDZ ligands."
