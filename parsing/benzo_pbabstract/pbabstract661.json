The enzymes are situated on the cytoplasmic side of the microsomes. The esterases are partly solubilized and partly inactivated by homogenization in aqueous glycerol and treatment with deoxycholate. There is good correlation between the rates of hydrolysis and steric constants of the acyl moiety. Substrate binding increases to an optimum with the number of carbon atoms in the acyl moiety and is of hydrophobic nature. An attempt has been made to classify the esterases on the basis of the effect of inhibitors and activators.", 
    "1": "Effects of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GOBA) on psychomotor skills related to driving were studied in healthy student volunteers. The effects of oral GOBA 1.0 and 2.0 g, alone or in combination with 0.5 g/kg of ethyl alcohol, were compared in double-blind cross-over trials against oral diazepam 10 mg (D), alcohol 0.5 g/kg, and lactose placebo. Reactive and co-ordinative skills, attention, flicker fusion, proprioception, nystagmus, Maddox wing, and subjective estimations were included. The first single-dose trial with 12 volunteers revealed that neither GOBA 1.0 g nor D modified attention. D impaired reactive skills whilst co-ordinative skills remained largely uninfluenced by D or GOBA. Both D and GOBA impaired leg proprioception. Only D was experienced as a sedative drug. In the second trial with 12 volunteers, GOBA 1.0 g slightly increased reaction mistakes whereas GOBA 2.0 g next day did not. Either dose of GOBA was ineffective on co-ordinative skills, critical flicker fusion frequency, and proprioception. Alcohol alone (0.41 +/- 0.047 mg/ml) improved rather than impaired skills. GOBA 1.0 g + alcohol (0.36 +/- 0.027 mg/ml) impaired reactive skills more than GOBA 2.0 g did but no potentiation was seen. D impaired reactive and co-ordinative skills and flicker fusion. When D was given on two consecutive days, some tachyphylaxis to the D response was seen on co-ordinative skills but not on reactive skills or flicker fusion. It is concluded that in the recommended anxiolytic doses used GOBA neither deteriorates driving skills nor importantly increases the effects of low doses of alcohol.", 
    "2": "In 30 patients with congenital or acquired heart disease the haemodynamic effects of diazepam (Valium) 0.3 mg/kg were investigated during surgical procedures under neuroleptanalgesia. The following parameters were measured or calculated: Heart rate (HR), arterial pressure (-Part, Psyst, Pdiast), pulmonary artery pressure (-PAP), right (-PRA) and left atrial pressure (-PLA), left ventricular pressure (PLV), left ventricular enddiastolic pressure (PLVED), left ventricular peak dp/dt (dp/dtmax), cardiac output (CO), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), stroke index (SI), total systemic resistance (TSR), total pulmonary resistance (TPR), work index of the right (RVWI) and left ventricle (LVWI). In comparison with a control group (n = 36) diazepam caused a decrease in arterial pressure cardiac index, stroke index, right and left atrial pressure and dp/dtmax. This, however, was mainly attributable to vasodilatation and not to a negative inotropic effect, which is of only minor importance with diazepam. These haemodynamic changes resulted in a reduction in myocardial oxygen consumption. Diazepam is a valuable drug in neuroleptanalgesia, when an increase in blood pressure can not be controlled by fentanyl or droperidol.", 
    "3": "Chronic maternal administration of diazepam resulted in a modification of fetal respiratory-like activity (FRLA) in the sheep. An over-all increase in this activity occurred. This increase was probably due to a rebound effect following periods of acute suppression with each administration of diazepam. Loss of central control in the regulation of FRLA was implied. A complete reversal of a circadian rhythm of FRLA was observed in animals receiving diazepam. These changes have implications with respect to the antenatal monitoring of the fetus and sequelae in the newborn infant.", 
    "4": "A technique is described for the measurement of specific [3H]diazepam binding to subcellular fractions of rat brain. Binding occurred in fresh or hypotonically shocked, frozen and thawed preparations; was independent of the buffer used; and was concentrated in the synaptosomal fraction. The total binding capacity of crude brain homogenate was entirely recovered in the particulate fractions (P1, P2 and P3). Binding was saturable and reached 34 pmol/g of tissue; half-maximal binding (KD) occurred at 3.2 nM. Hill and Scatchard analysis indicated that the binding was noncooperative and to a single class of sites. Binding was time dependent and reversible; the bimolecular association constant (K1) was 1.13 . 10(6) sec-1 M-1 and the first order dissociation constant (K-1) was 2.69 . 10(-3) sec-1. Binding was highest in cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum; intermediate in midbrain, hypothalamus, corpus striatum and medulla oblongata/pons; and lowest in spinal cord. Benzodiazepines inhibited binding of [3H]diazepam in a manner correlated with pharmacological activity in vivo, and binding was not inhibited by non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants or by strychnine and glycine. Distribution of [3H]diazepam binding in several regions of the rat central nervous system correlated with Na+-independent binding of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the same regions. The results may be in accord with the possible involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid in the mechanism of action of the benzodiazepines but provide no support for a mechanism based on the interaction of benzodiazepines with central glycine receptors.", 
    "5": "A number of benzodiazepine have been shown to increase hostility and aggression. This study examines whether halazepam, a new benzodiazepine structurally very similar to diazepam, is associated with increases in hostility. Fifty-one adult outpatients in a double blind, 6 week study were randomly assigned either halazepam or placebo. Hostility was measured by changes in response on four different scales, the anger-hostility factor of the Patient Symptom Checklist and three MMPI hostility scales. The results of our study indicated that halazepam does not induce significant changes in hositility.", 
    "6": "The tidal volume-inspiratory duration relationship was studied during air breathing and rebreathing in conscious and anesthetized human subjects using three different intravenous agents. The results observed have been compared with similar experiments carried out in cats. Its has been shown that anesthesia provokes an increase in breathing rate associated with a decrease in tidal volume in human subjects; an opposite effect on breathing rate was observed in cats. Thus, the tidal volume-inspiratory duration relationship, although very similar in the conscious cat or human subject, is very different under anesthesia. The results were quite consistent in a given species whatever the nature of the drug used. It is suggested that modifications of the breathing rate by anesthesia, related to animal species, are caused by central effects of the drug. These effects are probably mediated by different actions on inputs to the inspiratory \"off-switch\" mechanisms in the two species.", 
    "7": "Subjective, behavioral, and physiologic changes followed abrupt withdrawal of diazepam (Valium) in a patient who had been treated with 30 to 45 mg of diazepam daily for 20 months. Precipitous weight loss and orthostatic pulse rate increase were a part of the abstinence syndrome, which occurred between the fifth and ninth days of withdrawal. Accompanying these changes in physiologic measures were discomforting symptoms and dysphoria that were aversive and reinforcing to drug taking since the patient sought diazepam administration. These observations suggest that changes in mood, feeling states, and behavior may be the most prominent characteristics of the abstinence syndrome associated with physical dependence on this dose level of diazepam.", 
    "8": "A derivatization procedure is described for the GLC determination of subnanogram amounts of chlordiazepoxide and nanogram amounts of N-desmethylchlordiazepoxide. Treatment with acetic anhydride at elevated temperature eliminates the highly polar and unstable nitrone group of these compounds by rearrangement and acetylation. The mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern of the acetyl derivatives is recorded and interpreted.", 
    "9": "After their first episode of febrile convulsions, 195 previously healthy children, aged 6--30 months, were given either diazepam or phenobarbitone for a year. Each child was assigned at random to one of the two medications: children admitted on even days were given a suppository containing 5 mg diazepam every 8 hours when the rectal temperature was greater than or equal to 38.5 degree C. Children admitted on odd days were given treatment with phenobarbitone, 3.5 +/- 1 mg/kg per day. 156 children completed treatment and outpatient control for a year, 83 in the diazepam and 73 in the phenobarbitone group. The rate of recurrence was independent of the prophylactic and 15--16 % of the children in both groups had new febrile convulsions within a year. The recurrence rate after 6 months was also similar, 11% in the diazepam group and 9% in the phenobarbitone group. New convulsions were of similar duration and severity in both groups. In both groups 6% of all febrile episodes led to new convulsions. Long-term treatment with phenobarbitone thus offered no advantage over intermittent diazepam.", 
    "10": "The effect of diazepam and barbital in the treatment of delirium tremens and other acute conditions related to alcohol abuse was evaluated in a double-blind trial. 91 patients participated in the study, 44 in the diazepam group, 47 in the barbital group. The choice of diazepam rather than chlordiazepoxide was motivated by its major anticonvulsive properties. Barbital was given by the oral route, diazepam as intramuscular injections. Different ways of drug administration to patients with delirium tremens are discussed. It is concluded that the two different ways used in the study probably did not have a noteworthy influence on the results. All patients were excluded who had taken psychoactive drugs before admission. Nevertheless a considerable part of the patients had diazepam, but not barbital, in the blood before treatment was initiated. This may give support to the use of barbital as a \"special purpose drug\" in the treatment of these conditions. The patients were divided into three diagnostic categories, according to the severity of the clinical condition. No difference between the two drugs tested was found in the milder conditions, but barbital was found superior to diazepam in the treatment of fully developed delirium tremens.", 
    "11": "The decision to use drugs systemically in the management of mandibular dysfunction must be made with consideration of the information summarized in this report. It has been shown that pharmacotherapy may be effective. It has also been demonstrated that systemic pharmacotherapy frequently produces side effects which are occasionally severe. The clinician must decide on the appropriateness of therapy with the knowledge that many other conservative measures may also have excellent success rates and that pharmacotherapy is likely to be palliative rather than curative.", 
    "12": "Drug treatment of status epilepticus is reviewed. Tonic-clonic, focal motor, complex partial and absence status epilepticus are discussed. In managing tonic-clonic status epilepticus one should: (1) maintain vital functions at all times, (2) identify and treat precipitating factors and (3) administer an intravenous loading dose of phenytoin sodium or phenobarbital sodium. Careful use of i.v. diazepam sometimes helps to achieve these objectives. Intravenous phenytoin sodium and phenobarbital sodium provide definitive, long-term control of tonic-clonic seizures but must be administered slowly and require time to reach peak brain concentrations. Intravenous diazepam appears to enter and exit from the brain rapidly and may control seizures while therapeutic brain concentrations of long-acting drugs are being achieved. Phenytoin, phenobarbital and diazepam should not be administered intramuscularly in treating status epilepticus. Treatment of focal motor and complex partial status epilepticus is similar to that of tonic-clonic status epilepticus, but i.v. diazepam is required less frequently and loading doses of phenytoin and phenobarbital sometimes can be given more slowly. Status epilepticus of the absence type is managed with i.v. acetazolamide sodium or diazepam. Paraldehyde, muscle relaxants, general anesthesia and lidocaine may be tried when conventional therapies fail.", 
    "13": "A patient with uncontrolled posttraumatic epilepsy and acute intermittent prophyria was subjected to successive therapeutic trials with phenytoin, carbamazepine, and clonazepam, while eating an adequate diet. Both phenytoin and carbamazepine treatments caused significant increases in porphobilinogen excretion and appeared to induce acute porphyric attacks. In contrast, treatment with clonazepam under rigid dietary control for 10 days caused no increase in porphilbinogen excretion. During the subsequent 7 months of treatment with clonazepam, neither seizures nor porphyric attacks recurred. These findings suggest that clonazepam may be a safe and effective treatment for chronic or severe generalized seizure disorders in patients with acute intermittent porphyria.", 
    "14": "Healthy human subjects received single and multiple oral doses of flunitrazepam. Absorption and disposition were first order and reproducible from administration. The oral doses were virtually completely available to the liver, and elimination from the body occurred entirely via metabolism. Assuming the liver to be the sole eliminating organ, hepatic blood clearance and extraction ratio were approximately 0.235 liter/hr/kg and 0.154, respectively. Steady-state blood volume of distribution averaged 3.76 liters/kg in the single-dose studies. Terminal exponential half-lives from the single- and multiple-dose studies (different subjects) averaged 13.5 and 19.2 hr, respectively; these differences were not due to clearance changes but were entirely attributable to variations in volumes of distribution.", 
    "15": "Flunitrazepam or diazepam with atropine and a combination of phenoperidine, droperidol and cyclizine (neuroleptanalgesia) were compared as premedication in three groups of 25 patients undergoing routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Drug doses were titrated carefully against response and all three regimes were found to be similar in terms of safety, patient co-operation, relaxation and speed of recovery. Neuroleptanalgesia however produced a statistically significant rise in endtidal pCO2 and systolic blood pressure. The benzodiazepines, and in particular flunitrazepam, produced a significantly greater amnesia for the procedure, patients given these drugs being more willing to undergo repeat endoscopy.", 
    "16": "The use of \"low-dose\" heparin for the purpose of the prophylaxis of thrombosis is not yet general in the treatment of tetanus because this therapy may increase the risk of bleeding gastrointestinal stress-ulcers. The combination of heparin with histamine H2-receptor blockers, however, may be of therapeutic benefit and may reduce this complication as well as thrombosis. A case of tetanus and its therapy is reported.", 
    "17": "The in vitro effect of ten benzodiazepine derivatives on the cholinesterases of human plasma and red cells was determined. Flurazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, flunitrazepam and diazepam had an inhibitory effect on plasma cholinesterase of 60--90 per cent and, with the exception of lorazepam, an inhibitory effect of 40--50 per cent on red cell cholinesterase. Clonazepam, oxazepam, chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and bromazepam had comparatively minor effects on both enzymes", 
    "18": "The absorption of oral digoxin and of desmethyldiazepam, from its precursor clorazepate, was studied in seven patients who had received abdominal and/or pelvic radiation therapy for neoplastic disease. All patients were in remission and had normal renal function and no evidence of malabsorption. Single 0.5-mg doses of digoxin tablets and 15-mg doses of clorazepate were administered in the fasting state. Concentrations of digoxin (by radioimmunoassay) and desmethyldiazepam (by gas chromatography) were determined in multiple plasma samples and all urine collected during 24 hours after dosage. The mean (+/- S.E.) weight-normalized area under the 24-hour plasma digoxin concentration curve (WtN-AUC-24) in the patients (722 +/- 40 ng/ml-hr-kg) was similar to that in five normal controls (713 +/- 57 ng/ml-hr-kg), but 24-hour urinary excretion of digoxin in patients (54.5 +/- 4.4 microgram) was significantly less (P less than 0.025) than in controls (83.4 +/- 11.4 microgram). Neither age, sex, nor renal function explained the difference. In the clorazepate study, WtN-AUC-24 for desmethyldiazepam in the patients (187 +/- 19 microgram/ml-hr-kg) was significantly less (P less than 0.01) than in 15 normal control subjects (230 +/- 5 microgram/ml-hr-kg). Age and sex did not explain the difference. Thus, radiation therapy, or the underlying disease, is associated with malabsorption of these two drugs, possibly because of damage to gastric acid-secreting cells.", 
    "19": "In this multi-clinic double-blind study, patients suffering from insomnia were treated with triazolam 0.5 mg (Halcion) or placebo for 14 days. Four investigators treated 239 patients, 122 on triazolam and 117 on placebo. Thirty-nine patients, 10 on triazolam and 29 on placebo, dropped out for ineffectiveness of the medication and 32 patients, 16 in each group, dropped out for side effects. Analysis of pooled efficacy data showed that triazolam was significantly better than placebo on all efficacy parameters measured, including how much the medication helped the patients sleep, onset of sleep, duration of sleep, duration compared to usual, number of nocturnal awakenings, and feeling of restfulness in the morning. Triazolam did not produce evidence of tolerance development after 2 weeks of treatment. The same variety of side effects occurred on each treatment and primarily included drowsiness, grogginess, headaches, impaired coordination nausea, and dizziness.", 
    "20": "Chlorazepate, a long-acting benzodiazepine, allayed anxiety before operation, being superior to placebo in a double-blind study in which the drug was given the night before surgery. Long-term relief of apprehension before surgery by the administration of chlorazepate, combined with a narcotic analgesic when indicated, is advocated.", 
    "21": "In a four-week study, a comparison was made of oxazepam, flurazepam and chloral hydrate as hypnotic sedatives in 17 geriatric patients. Each drug was given alone for six nights, with a two-night placebo interval following each phase. Each patient completed an additional placebo phase (up to six nights) before each drug phase. The number of awakenings per night and the sleep latency (time required to fall asleep) were determined from the patients' reports and from the reports of a nurse-observer. Only for oxazepam was the number of patient-reported awakenings per night significantly less than for placebo, although with both oxazepam and flurazepam the awakenings were fewer than with chloral hydrate. According to the patient-reports, sleep latency was significantly lower with flurazepam than with placebo; for oxazepam and chloral hydrate the latencies were not significantly different from those for flurazepam or placebo. Only for oxazepam were the patients' ratings of sleep quality significantly greater than for placebo. The objective assessment of sleep by the nurse-observer usually confirmed the patients' assessments. Morning drowsiness was the most common side effect, reported equally for placebo and for the active drugs. Drowsiness during the day was reported less frequently for oxazepam than for flurazepam, chloral hydrate or placebo. It is concluded that oxazepam is safe and efficacious for the short-term management of insomnia in the elderly.", 
    "22": "Interaction of the main metabolites of diazepam and chlordiazepoxide with alcohol was measured in two subacute double-blind cross-over experiments on 40 healthy, young volunteers. The drugs were administered for two week periods. The variables measured were choice reaction time and accuracy, eye-hand co-ordination, divided attention, flicker fusion, proprioception and nystagmus. Chlordiazepoxide lactam, methyloxazepam and oxazepam significantly enhanced the alcohol-induced impairment of psychomotor skills, whereas N-desmethyl-diazepam did so only exceptionally in certain subjects in the choice reaction test. It is concluded that diazepam-alcohol interaction on psychomotor skills is mainly due to the parent compound. No correlation between the serum level of the agents and the changes in performance were found.", 
    "23": "The effect of a single oral dose of diazepam 10 mg or chlorpromazine 25 mg on memory in man was examined in a double-blind study, each drug being crossed-over against placebo, with 20 subjects for each drug. Kahn's Test for Symbol Arrangement and a paired association-learning task were used for assessment of acquisition, storage and retrieval, and state-dependency effects. A flicker-fusion test, two coordination tests, and a choice reaction task were used to evaluate alertness in the subjects. Diazepam significantly impaired acquisition, but slightly facilitated recall. Reaction time was shortened after acute diazepam treatment and coordination was impaired after two weeks treatment with diazepam. Acute treatment with chlorpromazine did not change memory or psychomotor performance.", 
    "24": "31 in-patients with anxiety entered at random in a double-blind clinical trial of chlordiazepoxide and camazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative. They were assessed by three different rating scales. Statistical evaluation of the results showed similar psychopharmacological activity of both drugs. It is concluded that camazepam is suitable for treatment of mild and severe anxiety states.", 
    "25": "Three extraction procedures for the detection of diazepam, oxazepam, chlorazepate and/or chlordiazepoxide in human urines are presented. All three procedures are based on the acid hydrolysis of benzodiazepines and/or their conjugated metabolites to give the corresponding benzophenones. Procedure I involves the direct acid hydrolysis of raw urine and is recommended when the aim is to test the abuse of benzodiazepine derivatives only. Procedure II Is a two-step extraction method in which a wide variety of drugs of abuse including cocaine (test based on the detection of benzoylecgonine) are extracted by the first step using paper loaded with cation-exchange resin and the benzodiazepines are tested in the second step by the acid hydrolysis of the spent urine left after removing the ion-exchange paper. Procedure III involves the use of inert fibrous matrix and then its acid hydrolysis. The detection procedure is based on the identification of methylaminochlorobenzophenone (MACB) and aminochlorobenzophenone (ACB). MACB is detected as a yellow-colored compound while ACB is detected by spraying with Bratton-Marshall reagent. Specificity of detection of ACB has been achieved by the selection of a thin-layer developing solvent system in which sulfonamides with primary aromatic amino groups remain at the origin.", 
    "26": "The effects of 7-chloro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-methyl-1 H, 1.4-benzodiazepin-2(3H)-one (ID-540), a recently introduced benzodiazepine derivative, on the averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR), subjective symptoms, and serum levels of ID-540 and its principal metabolite, N-desmethyl-ID-540, following an oral dose of 0.5 mg or placebo were investigated in six male Japanese students in a double-blind, crossover design. The peak latencies of PPR showed a statistically significant prolongation, with maximum level at 3 h after administration, which recovered to the initial level within 4 h. The amplitude of PPR failed to show a definite response to the drug. The serum concentration of ID-540 reached a peak level 2-3 h after administration, and then decreased at 4 h. N-Desmethyl-ID-540 exhibited a slow- gradual rise in serum. The latencies of PPR were positively correlated with the serum level of ID-540 but not with the N-desmethyl-ID-540. It is concluded that the PPR test may be a useful method for predicting the clinical effects of psychotropic drugs.", 
    "27": "The conditions under which prolongation of halothane-induced sleeping time in the mouse may be used as a test for centrally acting drugs are described. The test can be recommended for its practical advantages over methods using barbiturates to induce hypnosis; due cognizance must be taken of a diurnal variation in the response of mice to halothane. To assess the usefulness of the test the effects of amphetamine, chlorpromazine, histamine, morphine, nikethamide, pentobarbitone and SKF 525A have been investigated. The interaction between 5 benzodiazepines and halothane has been studied in particular. Results from sleeping time experiments, measurements of body temperature and of brain halothane concentrations suggest that the halothane-benzodiazepine interaction is due to additive CNS depressant effects. It was found that nitrazepam and diazepam were clearly more potent than chlorodiazepoxide, medazepam and oxazepam in respect of their interactions with halothane.", 
    "28": "Rates of drug-induced gastrointestinal bleeding were estimated from data on 16 646 consecutively monitored medical inpatients who had no known predisposing illness. Heparin, warfarin, ethacrynic acid, steroids, and aspirin-containing drugs were associated with gastrointestinal bleeding and were estimated to account for about two-thirds of such bleeds. Major gastrointestinal bleeding, defined as bleeding severe enough to require transfusion, occurred in only 57 patients (0.3%).", 
    "29": "The specific use of psychotropic agents in myocardial infarction has become possible due to interdisciplinary cooperation. Especially the differentiated therapeutic application of benzodiazepine derivatives will take into better account the different psychopathologic states in the various phases. The medicamentous facilities are extended by using the central and peripheral effects of the beta-blockers. After a myocardial infarction there are various somatic and mental symptoms. This requires precise medical and psychological management with reference to a diagnostic and combined-therapeutic schedule of treatment. An intensive co-operation with all medical departments is a conditio sine qua non.", 
    "30": "Using critical flicker fusion (CFF) determination and estimation of drowsiness in eight healthy volunteers the sedative-hypnotic effects of diazepam and mitrazepam were studied. Three dose levels of each drug were used, so that dose-effect curves could be produced. The most reliable results were obtained with the CFF method, and significant dose-effect relations could be demonstrated. The CFF deviation after diazepam initially related well to the concentration in blood serum, but after 4--6 hours the CFF depression vanished rapidly, while the drug concentration remained high. After nitrazepam the signs of drowsiness occurred similarly, while the drug concentration in serum showed on an average a slower rise. The effects began to disappear before the nitrazepam concentration had reached a peak. A rapid tachyphylaxis at the receptor sites seems to be responsible for this incongruity. Nitrazepam exerted significantly stronger sedative effects than diazepam, particularly when the respective serum concentrations were taken into account. This confirms that nitrazepam should be a more efficient sleeping drug, although diazepam also has considerable sedative-hypnotic action.", 
    "31": "Immediate EEG changes after intravenous administration of clonazepam and a correlation between the EEG changes and the effect of oral administration of the drug were studied in 21 children with minor seizures whose interictal EEG showed a paroxysmal abnormality. In 13 cases of infantile spasms whose EEG showed hypasrhythmia, paroxysmal discharges were completely or remarkably suppressed in 4 cases, partially suppressed in 3 cases, but not improved in 6 cases. Suppression bursts pattern was less improved. In 5 cases of Lennox syndrome, paroxysmal discharges were markedly improved in 3 cases. In a case of petit mal absence, parxoxysmal discharges were completely suppressed. In all 5 cases whose EEGs were completely improved, paroxysmal discharges reappeared 7 to 30 min after the intravenous injection. In 2 out of the 5 cases, paroxysmal discharges became severer at reappearance than before the injection. Among 12 cases whose EEG showed an improvement after the intravenous injection, their clinical seizures were improved in 9 cases, but the clinical effect was mostly transient. In the majority of the cases whose EEGs were not improved, no clinical effect was observed. There was a highly significant correlation between immediate EEG changes and clinical effect of clonazepam (p less than 0.02 by the chi-square test).", 
    "32": "Nine patients hospitalized for tetanus were studied under the same protocol which included two haemodynamic studies with a preload trial (PLT). The first being made during therapy (diazepam barbiturate association), on the sixth day of hospitalisation, and the second one after recovery. The comparison of the results shows that before PLT the mean arterial pressuure (MAP) is significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in patients after recovery in comparison to the same patients undergoing therapy. After PLT there is no significant difference between the two groups. Lastly, the variation of the left ventricular function points under PLT shows no significant difference between patients during therapy and after recovery. These results suggest that the diazepamphenobarbital combination does not alter the left ventricular function of the patients undergoing this therapy during tetanus.", 
    "33": "Cholinergic vasodilatation evoked by hypothalamic stimulation in cats could be elicited by stimulation of both the emotional and mator areas of the brain. Tranquilizers affected the cholinergic vasodilatation in different ways: reserpine decreased, catapresan increased, while diazepam had no effect on amplitude of the cholinergic vasodilatation. The latter seems to be closely connected with activity of skeletal muscles but not with emotional reactions. Alpha--adrenergic structures of the c. n. s. are the activating mechanism of the central integration of cholinergic vasodilatation.", 
    "34": "Neuroleptics, antidepressants, lithium, anxiolytics, and hypnotics may be excreted in breast milk. Because of the danger to the neonate, drugs such as diazepam, lithium, bromides, reserpine, and opium alkaloids should not be given to lactating women, and barbiturates, haloperidol, and penfluridol should be administered with caution. The side effects produced as a result of breast-feeding of the infant by mothers consuming psychotropic drugs are reviewed and possible preventive measures are discussed.", 
    "35": "Continuous pupillary readings in response to a random-digit cognition task were obtained for 20 male subjects. Ten subjects were given 10 mg of diazepam, and 10 subjects were given placebos. Additional pupillary curves were recorded for both groups at 1 and 2 hr and compared to the initial curve. Subjects were required to repeat the exact sequence of verbalized randomized digits as a measure of performance. The results indicated that the diazepam treatment group differed significantly from the placebo group in terms of a depressed pupillary response. Furthermore, the performance recall measure was significantly reduced in the diazepam group. The relationships were clarified by an analysis of covariance and variance.", 
    "36": "1 Plasma concentrations of diazepam and its metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, have been measured in both in- and out-patient groups treated with diazepam for periods varying between 1 month and 10 years. 2 The diazepam concentration was directly related to the dose of diazepam ingested and inversely related to the age of the patient. 3 A highly significant relationship was obtained between the concentration of desmethyldiazepam and diazepam. 4 The plasma concentrations of both diazepam and its metabolite were independent of sex, duration fo therapy and patient group.", 
    "37": "Two vermisectomized photosensitive baboons exhibited two different types of myoclonus, one induced by intermittent light stimulation (ILS) and the other occuring \"spontaneously\". The characteristics of these two types of myoclonus are described from a clinical and from an ECoG point of view. Myoclonus induced by ILS (ML) started at the eyelids and secondarily invaded the face and body; it was always preceded by frontorolandic spike-waves or polyspike-waves. The \"spontaneous\" myoclonus which followed vermisectomy (MV) was \"massive\", but involved firstly the trunk and secondarily the face and limbs; no ECoG paraoxysm accompanied this myoclonus, but we observed a parietal evoked potential of small amplitude, 10--15 msec after its onset. If MLs can be considered as consequences of the fronto-rolandic paroxysmal discharges, MVs seem to originate in the brain stem but appear similar to action myoclonus. This experimental situation showing two types of myoclonus resembles human hereditary degenerative syndromes (dyssynergic cerebellar myoclonus, progressive myoclonic epilepsy), without being exactly comparable. The conditions in which MVs were seen and their modifications during sleep and by different drugs are described. The relationships between MVs and MLs and myoclonic epilepsy are discussed.", 
    "38": "Eighteen inpatients suffering from a severe anxiety received in double-blind and crossover conditions iv and im injections of 10 mg diazepam, 5 mg lorazepam or saline t.i.d. during 5 days. The morning injections was made iv in a CCTV studio. Before injection and 20 mn after it, the patient filled out a 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale; his doctor-in-charge proceeded to a standard interview and to physiological measurements (tremor of hand, patellar reflexes, blood pressure, pulse rate). The videotaped interviews were randomly, i.e. time-blind, rated by two independent observers on 3 scales: the VAS, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and an ad hoc Verbal and Non-Verbal Anxiety Scale (VNVA). The statistical analysis was completed by a logical analysis according to Lewis Carroll. The results demonstrate the superiority of lorazepam over diazepam on psychic anxiety, somatic anxiety, sleep and blood pressure, the only significant side-effect being drowsiness.", 
    "39": "For the legal-toxicological identification on the Grandaxin--a new minor tranquillant of benzodiazepine type--a new method have been worked out. Identification by layer-chromatography and determination by UV-spectrophotometry appeared to be suitable for the study of 5 postmortal cases.", 
    "40": "Today neuropharmacas are a helpful part in the conservative treatment of the neurogenic bladder disorders. They are, or course, no \"wonder-drugs\" and usually lead to an improvement only of the troubles, but rarely to complete cure. If monotherapy does not lead to the results wanted, one should combine drugs of the same of similar effects but with different pharmacologic targets. A real progress was reached through alpha-receptor-blockers, whose use has, especially in children with myelomeningocele, changed the therapeutic concept in favour of a largely conservative treatment. We already know a number of substances that in one way or other influence the muscles of the bladder and the bladder outlet. If only part of them will reach clinical usage, it can be assumed that the pharmacotherapy will become even more meaningful in the treatment of neurogenic bladder disorders.", 
    "41": "Effects of triazolam on various types of conditioned behavior were investigated and compared mainly with diaepam in rats. The active conditioned avoidance response of the rat in a Shuttle box was inhibited by triazolam and diazepam only at large doses. The passive avoidance response in a step-down method was not affected by either triazolam or diazepam, but was markedly suppressed by chlorpromazine. The low rate response of hypothalamic self-stimulation behavior was markedly increased by triazolam at doses ranging from 2 to 40 mg/kg p.o., but was suppressed at doses over 80 mg/kg p.o. The high rate response was unaffected by triazolam even at doses of 40 approximately 180 mg/kg p.o. The low rate response was increased by diazepam at doses of 1 approximately 10 mg/kg p.o. and was suppressed at 80 mg/kg p.o. The high rate response was reduced by diazepam at 180 mg/kg p.o. In the conflict situation of the rat subjected to food reward and foot-shock punishment, the lever press response in the unpunished period was reduced by triazolam at doses of 1 approximately 5 mg/kg p.o., whereas that in the punished period was markedly increased. Similar effects were observed with diazepam at doses of 15 approximately 20 mg/kg p.o. Triazolam appeared to be 10 approximately 15 times more potent than diazepam in this anticonfluct effect. Thus, triazolam appears to be a potent antianxiety agent.", 
    "42": "Triazolam was 4 to 5 times as potent as diazepam in reducing hyperemotionality of either septal-lesioned or olfactory bulbectomized rats (O.B. rats), and in suppressing muricide in O.B. rats. This agent was equipotent with diazepam in inhibiting fighting behavior of long-term isolated mice, but was longer in duration of action. Triazolam was approximately 4 times more potent than diazepam in preventing pentetrazol convulsion, but was 10 times less potent in inhibiting maximal electroshock convulsion in mice. The muscle relaxant effect of triazolam as assessed by the inclined screen test was 34 times, and the effect on rotarod performance was 17 times more potent than that of diazepam in mice. Triazolam (0.2 approximately 0.5 mg/kg i.v.) changed the EEG to a drowsy pattern in unanesthetized rabbits with a chronic electrode implant, and suppressed the EEG arousal response to auditory stimulation and electrical stimulation given to either the mesencephalic reticular formation or posterior hypothalamus. The limbic afterdischarges induced by either hippocampal or amygdaloid stimulation were also markedly inhibited by triazolam. These EEG effects of triazolam were qualitatively similar to, but were 4 to 5 times more potent than those of diazepam. These results indicate that triazolam is a potent tranquilizer with a longer duration of action, and the muscle relaxant effect is considerable as compared with diazepam.", 
    "43": "1. Sulpiride, but not procainamide, antagonizes the excitatory effects of (+/-)-octopamine receptors in the Tapes ventricle. Neither compound attenuates dopamine excitation. 2. Clozapine will attenuate the effects of (+/-)-octopamine and (-)-alpha-methyl octopamine at the octopamine receptor but not the excitatory effect of dopamine at dopamine receptors. 3. Clozapine is more potent than its 2-positional isomer HF 2046 in attenuating octopamine excitation. However, HF 2046, unlike clozapine, will attenuate the excitatory effects of dopamine. 4. These data indicate that replacement of the 8-chloro substituent in the clozapine nucleus with a 2-chloro substituent decreases the ability of the compound to blockaed octopamine receptors. However, the 2-chloro-substituted compound (HF 2046) now has the added ability to blockade excitatory dopamine receptors. 5. The greater potency of clozapine than HF 2046 as an octopamine antagonist suggests that it is the 8-chloro-substituted aromatic ring of clozapine which overlaps the aromatic site usually occupied by the octopamine aromatic ring.", 
    "44": "The hypnotic effect of flunitrazepam (Ro 5-4200), nitrazepam and a placebo was studied in 117 outpatients using hypnotics for at least 3 months prior to the study. They obtained various neurotropic drugs and this and other treatments were unchanged throughout the trial period of 13 weeks. This consisted of 3 weeks on the previously used hypnotic, 3 weeks on a test drug (during the first of these a doubling of the dose was permitted if the initial dose of 1 mg flunitrazepam, 5 mg nitrazepam or one tablet of placebo was not satisfactory) and 4 weeks' observation after a request to stop medication with the test drug. The effects were evaluated every week by self-ratings. Also noted were: the frequency of dose increase after 1 week of the test period, number of drop-outs in the test period, and failure in the attempt to stop taking the test drug. A \"psychological concentration test\" was done, as was a follow-up interview. The self-ratings had a good reliability and showed that more patients experienced shorter sleep induction, longer sleep time, better sleep quality and a subjective feeling of having had a better rest with flunitrazepam than with either nitrazepam or placebo. There were no differences between the nitrazepam and the placebo groups. Tiredness was the most common side effect and appeared in the same frequency in all groups. The number of patients who increased the dose after 1 week's medication, as well as the number of drop-outs, was significantly higher in the nitrazepam and placebo groups than in the flunitrazepam group. There was no difference in the ability to discontinue the medication between the test groups or between groups having previously used different hypnotics. The \"psychological concentration test\" did not reveal any differences between groups. It was concluded that withdrawal of a hypnotic in chronic users was not facilitated by the use of a placebo. This was interpreted as due to a strong psychological dependence upon the hypnotics and their lack of pharmacological effects during long-term treatment.", 
    "45": "Female mice which received chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, oxazepam, prazepam, flurazepam, or nitrazepam prenatally and postnatally had delays in the age of vaginal perforation and first estrus concomitant with reduced postnatal growth. Females exposed prenatally showed no growth deficits, but in four treatments had delayed vaginal opening. However, the age of first estrus was generally less than the control.", 
    "46": "There has been a paucity of research in the use of high-dose benzodiazepines in the treatment of severe neurotic anxiety. The author presents five cases, three with excellent and two with poor outcomes. The English and Fench language literature is reviewed and reveals evidence that high-dose benzodiazepines may be useful in the treatment of certain neurotic patients. However, the lack of controlled studies is noted. The author poses several questions important to the future of research on benzodiazepines.", 
    "47": "Clobazam, a new antianxiety compound, was compared in a double-blind study with diazepam in 40 neurotic outpatients. Twenty-three patients completed the trial under clobazam conditions while 17 patients completed the trial under diazepam conditions. The trial was conducted for a period of four weeks of active drug administration followed by a one-week period of placebo administration. Clobazam was administered in three divided doses of 30 to 40 mg/day, while diazepam was administered in three divided doses of 15 to 20 mg/day, following a fixed dosage schedule. No significant differences were noted between the two treatment conditions during the drug trial period. The patients on clobazam maintained greater improvement during the placebo trial period for the variables \"somatic anxiety\" and \"nights of sleep disturbance.\" Simultaneous motor coordination tests (hand steadiness test) showed greater improvement on clobazam throughout the trial period in patients with an initial error score greater than 50 points. This difference was significant during the second week of the trial."
