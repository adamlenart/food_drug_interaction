Biological tests performed in human acute promyelocytic leukemia NB4 cells showed that new hybrids can induce histone H3/H4 acetylation, growth arrest, and also apoptosis. Notably, chiral compounds exhibit stereoselective activity.", 
    "1": "Baicalin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, was previously reported to induce anxiolytic-like effect devoid of sedation and myorelaxation in mice, acting through type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor benzodiazepine (BZ) site. The present study further expanded the behavioral pharmacology profile of baicalin and subtype selectivity was explored as a possible mechanism underlying its in vivo effects on mice. Baicalin was characterized using convulsion, memory, and motor function related animal tests; and its selectivity towards recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes expressed in HEK 293T cells was determined by radioligand binding assay and electrophysiological studies. In the picrotoxin-induced seizure, step-through passive avoidance and rotarod tests, the anticonvulsant, amnesic and motor incoordination effects commonly associated with classical BZs were not observed when baicalin was administered at effective anxiolytic doses, demonstrating a separation of the anticonvulsant, amnesic and motor incoordination effects from the anxiolytic-like effect. Although baicalin exhibited higher binding affinity for the alpha1-containing GABA(A) subtype compared with alpha2-, alpha3-, and alpha5-containing subtypes, this was not statistically significant. In contrast to the classical BZ diazepam, baicalin showed significant preference for alpha2- and alpha3-containing subtypes compared to alpha1- and alpha5-containing subtypes in whole-cell patch clamp studies (P < 0.01). Its subtype selectivity suggested that baicalin exerted its in vivo anxiolytic-like effect mainly through the alpha2- and alpha3-containing subtypes. Therefore, the present study revealed an underlying mechanism for the selective anxiolytic profile of baicalin, suggesting alpha2- and alpha3-containing subtypes were important drug targets for flavonoid-based anxiolytics.", 
    "2": "Cinacalcet HCl (cinacalcet) is approved for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in subjects receiving dialysis and for the reduction of hypercalcaemia in patients with parathyroid carcinoma. The drug may also be co-administered with medications used in the renal transplantation setting, such as immunosuppressants. Cinacalcet, as well as some immunosuppressants such as ciclosporin, tacrolimus and sirolimus, is partially metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A enzymes (CYP3A). This study aimed to evaluate the potential inhibitory effects of cinacalcet on CYP3A activity using midazolam as a probe substrate in healthy volunteers.", 
    "3": "In this randomized, open-label, crossover, two-treatment, two-period, single-centre study, 12 healthy volunteers received either oral cinacalcet 90 mg once daily for 5 days plus a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg on day 5, or a single oral dose of midazolam 2 mg on day 1. Following a 10-day washout period, subjects received the alternate treatment. Blood samples were collected predose and at selected time points up to 24 hours after dosing with midazolam for measurement of midazolam pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "4": "Eleven subjects completed the study. Mean (standard deviation) midazolam maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) were 9.31 (3.09) ng/mL and 24.1 (7.7) ng . h/mL, respectively, when administered in combination with cinacalcet, compared with 9.76 (2.81) ng/mL and 22.8 (6.1) ng . h/mL when administered alone. The mean geometric ratios (90% confidence interval) were 0.95 (0.84, 1.06) and 1.05 (0.95, 1.16) for C(max) and AUC(infinity), respectively. All adverse events were mild to moderate in severity, and consistent with the safety profile of cinacalcet.", 
    "5": "Once-daily administration of cinacalcet did not alter the pharmacokinetics of midazolam relative to administration of midazolam alone. These data suggest that cinacalcet administration does not affect CYP3A activity, and thus would not have an effect on any drug eliminated via CYP3A, including some commonly used immunosuppressant therapies.", 
    "6": "We evaluated the effect of restraint stress (1 hr/day) for 6, 10, 14 and 21 days on antibody response against sheep RBC (SRBC) and modulation by chlordiazepoxide (CDP) pretreatment (10 mg/kg/day) in albino rats. Anti-SRBC titer was significantly decreased with increase in number of days of restraint stress exposure. CDP pretreatment significantly reversed the effects of 6, 10 and 14 (but not of 21) days of restraint stress. CDP treatment for 21 days per se suppressed immune response, but no additive effect was observed. CDP was not effective in chronic stress (i.e., 21 days of stress). Hence, the rationale behind benzodiazepines therapy in chronic stress needs to be evaluated.", 
    "7": "Oral droplet formulations of clonazepam (CZ) were developed to examine their potentials as an alternative to i.v. administration for the treatment of acute epileptic seizures. Propylene glycol containing 2.5% (wt/wt) CZ with or without 5.0% (wt/wt) oleic acid (OA) was prepared as a solution by heating at 90 degrees C and subsequently lowering the temperature to 30 degrees C. The droplet (20 microL) was administered to the oral cavity between the lower gum and bottom lip before CZ precipitation started. With a droplet of propylene glycol loaded with 2.5% (wt/wt) CZ and 5.0% (wt/wt) OA, the plasma concentration reached 20 ng/mL (minimal effective concentration) within 10 min and was maintained between 20 and 60 ng/mL, less than a toxic level, for a period of 60 min. For a droplet of propylene glycol loaded only with CZ at 2.5% (wt/wt), it took more than 15 min for the plasma concentration to reach 20 ng/mL. It is suggested that a droplet of CZ/OA/propylene glycol (2.5:5.0:92.5, wt/wt) might be useful as an alternative to i.v. injection of CZ for the treatment of acute epileptic seizures.", 
    "8": "The objective of this investigation was to develop lorazepam (LZM) microemulsions as an alternative to the conventional cosolvent based formulation. Solubility of LZM in various oils and Tween 80 was determined. The ternary diagram was plotted to identify area of microemulsion existence and a suitable composition was identified to achieve desired LZM concentration. The LZM microemulsions were evaluated for compatibility with parenteral fluids, globule size, in vitro hemolysis and stability of LZM. Capmul MCM demonstrated highest solubilizing potential for LZM and was used as an oily phase. LZM microemulsions were compatible with parenteral dilution fluids and exhibited mean globule size less than 200 nm. The in vitro hemolysis studies indicated that microemulsions were well tolerated by erythrocytes. The LZM microemulsions containing amino acids exhibited good physical and chemical stability when subjected to refrigeration for 6 months.", 
    "9": "We examined the toxicity of cocatropine (cocaine/atropine mixture) and the therapeutic potential of diazepam on some behavioral and physiological parameters in rats. Atropine (20 and 60 mg/kg) or cocaine (40 mg/kg) alone did not induce any seizure or death, but the combination significantly increased both, after both acute and binge treatment. There was a significant increase of EEG mean total spectral power in cocatropine- in comparison with cocaine-treated animals. Hyperlocomotion was observed in non-seizuring rats treated with cocaine or cocatropine. Cocaine, atropine 60, and cocatropine (40 + 20 and 40 + 60) all induced hyperthermic effects in non-seizuring rats, while cocatropine (40 + 60)-seizuring animals had hypothermia. An initial hypertensive and tachycardiac effect within 15 min was followed by a secondary fall in the cocatropine (40 + 60) group. Cocatropine toxicity was partially or fully reversed by diazepam (5 mg/kg), given intraperitoneally after the first seizure. The present findings provide, for the first time, details of a synergistic toxic effect of the cocaine/atropine mixture and of the potential of diazepam for treating cocatropine-related hospital emergencies.", 
    "10": "We investigated the relationships between functional genetic variants of the 5-HT(2C) receptor and multidrug-resistant protein (MDR1), coding for P-glycoprotein, and second generation antipsychotic (SDA)-induced weight gain among 108 female schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine or risperidone for up to 4 months. No significant differences in -759C/T allelic and genotype variants of 5-HT(2C) were found between patients who gained more than 7% of their initial weight compared with those who gained less. Haplotype-based analysis of two MDR1 loci, exon 21 G2677T and exon 26 C3435T, revealed a slightly lower representation of the G2677/C3435 haplotype in the >or=7% group. In the subgroup of patients treated with risperidone, we found borderline overrepresentation of 2677T, significant overrepresentation of 3435T variant and borderline overrepresentation of 2677T/3435T haplotype the >or=7% group, whereas G2677/C3435 haplotype was found to be less represented in the >or=7% group. Our data indicate a nonsignificant role of 759C/T 5-HT(2C) in SDA-induced weight gain, and a stronger influence of the MDR1 G2677T and C3435T polymorphisms on risperidone-induced weight gain in female schizophrenic patients. 3435T and 2677T MDR1 variants, both associated with lower P-gp function, might predispose to higher risperidone accessibility to the brain that would lead to stronger effects, including weight gain.", 
    "11": "Bz-423 is a proapoptotic 1,4-benzodiazepine with potent therapeutic properties in murine models of lupus and psoriasis. Bz-423 modulates the F(1)F(0)-ATPase, inducing the formation of superoxide within the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which then functions as a second messenger initiating apoptosis. Herein, we report the signaling pathway activated by Bz-423 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts containing knockouts of key apoptotic proteins. Bz-423-induced superoxide activates cytosolic ASK1 and its release from thioredoxin. A mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade follows, leading to the specific phosphorylation of JNK. JNK signals activation of Bax and Bak which then induces mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization to cause the release of cytochrome c and a commitment to apoptosis. The response of these cells to Bz-423 is critically dependent on both superoxide and JNK activation as antioxidants and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 prevents Bax translocation, cytochrome c release, and cell death. These results demonstrate that superoxide generated from the mitochondrial respiratory chain as a consequence of a respiratory transition can signal a sequential and specific apoptotic response. Collectively, these data suggest that the selectivity of Bz-423 observed in vivo results from cell-type specific differences in redox balance and signaling by ASK1 and Bcl-2 proteins.", 
    "12": "To evaluate the effects of p-octyl polyethylene glycol phenyl ether (Triton X-100), polyoxyl 35 caster oil (EL35) and polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated caster oil (RH40) on the activity of Cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3 As) in vivo. Rats were administered with saline, ketoconazole (75 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), Triton X-100 (30 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), EL35 (150 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and RH40 (150 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) intragastrically for 5 consecutive days, and then given midazolam 10 mg x kg(-1) 20 min after the last treatment of ketoconazole or three surfactants with the same dose through duodenal administration. Pharmacokinetics parameters for midazolam and its metabolite 1'-hydroxymidazolam were estimated from the plasma concentration-time data by a noncompartmental approach. The results showed that multiple dose administration of Triton X-100, EL35 and RH40 decreased the ratios of 1'-hydroxymidazolam and midazolam AUC0-infinity from 1.14 to 0.90, 1.03 and 0.64, respectively. In contrast, multiple dose administration of ketoconazole caused the ratios of 1'-hydroxymidazolam and midazolam a significant decrease to 0.50. This study indicated that Triton X-100 and EL35 would have no inhibition on CYP3A, while RH40 had significant inhibition on CYP3A. Therefore, RH40 might be used to prepare drug formulations in pharmaceutical industry and would increase the bioavailability of some drugs transformed by CYP3As and further lead to significant clinical pharmacologic effects.", 
    "13": "The cholinergic system is believed to be associated with learning and memory functions. Lead (Pb2+) is a well-known neurotoxic metal that causes irreversible damage to the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate whether Pb2+ interferes with cholinergic modulation, we examined the effects of carbachol (CCh), a muscarinic cholinergic agonist, on synaptic transmission and plasticity in the CA1 area of the hippocampus of developmentally Pb2+-exposed rats. The results showed that: (1) In both control and Pb2+-exposed rats, 0.1 microM CCh significantly enhanced tetanus-induced long-term potentiation (LTP), while 5 microM CCh induced a reversible depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). However, both the enhancement of LTP and depression of fEPSPs were significantly smaller in Pb2+-exposed rats than in controls, suggesting that the extent of the effect of CCh on the cholinergic system was depressed by Pb2+. (2) In Pb2+-exposed rats, the enhancement of LTP induced by 0.1 microM CCh was attenuated by pirenzepine, a M1AChR antagonist, but was not affected by methoctramine tetrahydrochloride (M-105), a M2/4AChR antagonist. The depression of fEPSPs induced by 5 microM CCh was reduced by either pirenzepine or M-105. (3) Furthermore, paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) was not affected by 0.1 microM CCh in control and Pb2+-exposed rats but was increased by 5 microM CCh in either group; the increase in PPF was less pronounced in Pb2+-treated when compared to control rats. These results suggested that cholinergic modulation could be impaired by Pb2+, and this kind of impairment might occur via different mAChR subtypes. Our study delineated the effects of Pb2+ on muscarinic modulation, and this might be one of the underlying mechanisms by which Pb2+ impairs learning and memory.",

    "15": "Patients undergoing burns dressings changes were given a PCA device of ketamine and midazolam to use during the procedure. The aims were to investigate the efficacy of the device and to ascertain what (if any) adverse effects were associated with its use.", 
    "16": "During the trial period, 44 patients who underwent 95 separate procedures were enrolled. The effectiveness of the device was rated (out of 10) by both staff and patients with the mean scores being 8.47 and 8.50, respectively. In all but 1 case, the proposed procedure was carried out successfully. Thirteen patients reported a total of 23 adverse effects, with hallucinations (11) being the most common.",

    "19": "In order to test the hypothesis that MPDs may predispose to VVS, we assessed the prevalence of syncope, the response to head-up tilt test (HUTT) and the efficacy of psychiatric drug treatment in reducing syncopal episodes, in patients with recently diagnosed MPDs. The response to HUTT was compared with that in an equal number of matched (a) patients with VVS and (b) healthy controls.", 
    "20": "A high rate of patients with MPDs (58%) had a positive HUTT. Additionally, 45% had a history of syncope; among them, the rate of positive HUTT was identical to that in the VVS group (83%). Following psychiatric drug treatment, the number of patients with syncope decreased in the MPD group (6/67 from 30/67, p < 0.01). Psychiatric symptoms and quality of life were also improved. The number of syncopal spells decreased equally in the MPD and VVS groups (0.6 +/- 0.5 from 2.5 +/- 1.4, p < 0.01, and 0.7 +/- 0.5 from 2.7 +/- 1.3, p < 0.01, respectively).", 
    "21": "A high proportion of patients with MPDs experience syncope, associated with a high rate of positive HUTT, comparable to that observed in VVS. Psychiatric treatment results in the improvement of syncopal and psychiatric symptoms. These findings suggest involvement of co-occurring MPDs in the pathogenesis of VVS. Therefore, the diagnosis and treatment of MPDs, when present, may be crucial for the effective therapy of vasovagal syndrome.",

Overall, sustained virological response occurred in 47.1% of patients (for HCV genotype 1, 43.1%; for HCV genotypes 2 and 3, 58.8%). Only 9 patients (13%) discontinued treatment because of adverse effects. Multiple regression analysis revealed that not achieving a sustained virological response was correlated with HCV genotype 1 infection plus cirrhosis (adjusted odds ratio, 12.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-148) and baseline major depression (adjusted odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-11.6), but not with HIV infection, a baseline HCV RNA level >or=400,000 IU/mL, or black race. Compared with baseline, the rate of prescription of a new mood stabilizer (2.2 vs. 0.8 prescriptions per person-year) or an opioid (1.8 vs. 0.5 prescriptions per person-year) was higher during treatment, whereas there was no change in the rate of prescription of benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications.",

    "26": "Globally, suicide remains one of the leading causes of death among individuals aged 10 to 64 years and it ranks between second and fourth among those age 10 to 45 years. Data on suicidal behavior from Pakistan is sparse, especially for children and adolescents. A retrospective descriptive case note study was carried out of all patients under the age of 18 years (n = 69) admitted with deliberate self-harm (DSH) to a university hospital in Karachi, Pakistan. Females (63.8%) outnumbered males by 1.7:1. The mean age of the group was 16 years (+/- 2.2). The most frequent method used was benzodiazepine overdose (30.4%). \"Family conflicts\" was the main stressor reported by 66.7%. The most frequent diagnosis made was major depressive disorder in 18%. Despite the fact that 98% of our sample was Muslims and suicide is strictly forbidden in Islam, 76.8% expressed their intent to die. Multivariate logistic regression found current stressor to be significantly associated with an intention to die. Patients with nonfatal suicidal behavior form a pool for future suicides. Preventive efforts should be directed at this group. School based programs would be an effective way of addressing this.", 
    "27": "Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) are used to determine the spinal cord and brain function during surgical procedures. In general, SEPs are sensitive to volatile anesthetics, but little is known about the effects of anesthesia maintenance with sevoflurane on SEPs in children. Analgesics are often provided during anesthesia, and supplementary drugs may also affect the SEPs. In this prospective clinical trial of 27 healthy, 3- to 8-yr-old children, we evaluated the effects of sevoflurane anesthesia after IV induction with benzodiazepine and barbiturate on median nerve SEP. In addition, the effects of two analgesics (ketoprofen and fentanyl) on SEPs were evaluated.", 
    "28": "Median nerve SEPs were recorded before premedication with midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV, and at three separate times during anesthesia maintenance with sevoflurane 2% end-tidal concentration in air/oxygen (after 15 min of sevoflurane inhalation), supplemented with/without ketoprofen 1 mg/kg (after 25 min) and fentanyl 1 microg/kg (after 35 min).", 
    "29": "Compared with baseline measurements, an increase both in N20 latency (P = 0.015) and in central conduction time (P = 0.001) was noted during anesthesia maintenance with sevoflurane. The administration of analgesics did not have an influence on the N20 latency or central conduction time. In children 5 to 8 yr of age, the mean cortical N20-P25 amplitude was decreased (P = 0.008). In addition, in older children, the N20-P25 amplitude decreased after the co-administration of ketoprofen and fentanyl compared with the values measured before the analgesics (P = 0.03). These decreases were not seen in the younger children.", 
    "30": "In children, anesthesia maintenance with 2% sevoflurane prolongs median SEP latencies in a manner that is similar to those reported for other volatile anesthetics. However, SEP monitoring can be done with sevoflurane inhalation, but the dosage should be adjusted due to interindividual variability. Co-administration of ketoprofen, and fentanyl did not affect the SEP latencies, but post hoc analysis suggested that older children had a decrease in cortical amplitudes.", 
    "31": "Previous studies have shown that drug concentrations in blood can change during storage, especially at room temperature, but even labile drugs such as cocaine may be stable in dried blood spots (DBS). A new method has been developed for the analysis of hydrolytically labile drugs in blood spots on filter paper in order to assess their degradation during a storage period of one month. The drugs selected included flunitrazepam, temazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, diazepam, and cocaine. A Guthrie card 903 was spotted with 100 microL of blood containing the drugs at concentrations of 1000 ng/mL and left overnight to dry at room temperature. The filter paper was suspended in extraction buffer for 1 h with ultrasonication. Drugs were then extracted from the buffer by solid-phase extraction using Clean Screen((R)) columns and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Method validation showed that all calibration curves were linear over the concentration range 5-200 ng/spot with correlation coefficients of 0.994-0.999. Interday and intraday precisions at three concentrations (10, 50, and 100 ng/spot) were 1.6-18.3% and 2.8-14.7%, respectively. Limits of detection were 0.29-0.74 ng/spot, and lower limits of quantitation were 0.99-2.46 ng/spot. Recoveries of all analytes were in the range 81-106%. DBS were stored in duplicate at room temperature, 4 degrees C, and -20 degrees C for up to one month. Degradation of the drugs in DBS at all storage conditions was less than for the corresponding liquid blood samples stored under similar conditions and more than 80% of each analyte could be recovered from the samples.", 
    "32": "A single method for confirmation and quantitation of a panel of commonly prescribed benzodiazepines and metabolites, alpha-hydroxyalprazolam, alpha-hydroxyethylflurazepam, alpha-hydroxytriazolam, alprazolam, desalkylflurazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, clonazepam, and 7-aminoclonazepam, was developed for three specimen types, urine, serum/plasma, and meconium. Quantitation was by liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) using a Waters Alliance-Quattro Micro system. The instrument was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode with an electrospray ionization source in positive ionization mode. The method was evaluated for recovery, imprecision, linearity, analytical measurement range, specificity, and carryover. Average recovery and imprecision (within-run, between-run, and total % CV) were within +/- 15% of the target concentrations for urine (10 to 5000 ng/mL) and serum/plasma (10 to 2500 ng/mL) and within +/- 20% for meconium (10 to 5000 ng/g). In all, 205 patient specimens were analyzed, and the results compared to a previous in-house gas chromatography-MS method or LC-MS-MS results from an outside laboratory. Oxazepam glucuronide was evaluated as a hydrolysis control for the urine and meconium specimens.", 
    "33": "A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the simultaneous identification and quantification of amphetamines, diazepam and its metabolites, cocaine and its metabolites, and opiates from hair using a single extraction method. As part of the method development, Gemini C18, Synergi Hydro RP, and Zorbax Stablebond-Phenyl LC columns were tested with three different mobile phases. Analyte recovery and limit of detection were evaluated for two different solid-phase extraction methods that used Bond Elut Certify and Clean Screen cartridges. Phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) was chosen as the optimum hair incubation medium because of the high stability of cocaine and 6-monoacetylmorphine using this method and faster sample preparation. The optimized method was fully validated. Linearity was established over the concentration range 0.2-10 ng/mg hair, and the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.99. Total extraction recoveries were greater than 76%, detection limits were between 0.02 and 0.09 ng/mg, and the intra- and interday imprecisions were generally less than 20% in spiked hair. The intra- and interbatch imprecision of the method for a pooled authentic hair sample ranged from 1.4 to 23.4% relative standard deviation (RSD) and 8.3 to 25.4% RSD, respectively, for representative analytes from the different drug groups. The percent matrix effect ranged from 63.5 to 135.6%, with most analytes demonstrating ion suppression. Sixteen postmortem samples collected from suspected drug-related deaths were analyzed for the 17 drugs of abuse and metabolites included in the method. The method was sufficiently sensitive and specific for the analysis of drugs and metabolites in postmortem hair samples. There is scope for the inclusion of other target drugs and metabolites in the method.", 
    "34": "The automation of solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was accomplished using a 96 multiwell plate format, a SPME multifiber device, two orbital shakers, and a three-arm robotic system. Extensive optimization of the proposed setup was performed including coating selection, optimization of the fiber coating procedure, confirmation of uniform agitation in all wells, and the selection of the optimal calibration method. The system allows the use of pre-equilibrium extraction times with no deterioration in method precision due to reproducible timing of extraction and desorption steps and reproducible positioning of all fibers within the wells. The applicability of the system for the extraction of several common drugs is demonstrated. The optimized multifiber SPME-LC-MS/MS was subsequently fully validated for the high-throughput analysis of diazepam, lorazepam, nordiazepam, and oxazepam in human whole blood. The proposed method allowed the automated sample preparation of 96 samples in 100 min, which represents the highest throughput of any SPME technique to date, while achieving excellent accuracy (87-113%), precision (<or=20% RSD), and sensitivity (limit of quantitation 4 ng/mL). Automated SPME provides unique advantages over automated solid-phase extraction (SPE) including lower cost, the ability to quantitatively determine free and total drug concentrations in a single biofluid sample, and the ability to directly process whole blood samples with absolutely no sample pretreatment required.",

Uptake of intravenously administered [(11)C]PK11195 was studied ex vivo in excised tissue samples and aortic sections of a LDLR/ApoB48 atherosclerotic mice. Accumulation of the tracer was compared between the atherosclerotic plaques and non-atherosclerotic arterial sites by autoradiography and histological analyses.", 
    "37": "The [(3)H]PK11195 was found to bind to both the atherosclerotic plaques and the healthy wall. The autoradiography analysis revealed that the uptake of [(11)C]PK11195 to inflamed regions in plaques was more prominent (p = 0.011) than to non-inflamed plaque regions, but overall it was not higher than the uptake to the healthy vessel wall. Also, the accumulation of (11)C radioactivity into the aorta of the atherosclerotic mice was not increased compared to the healthy control mice.",

Their discriminable effects are largely attributable to the activation of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-amino butyric acid. Alcohol has the most pervasive effect in accordance with the high dose required to alter behavior. Hallucinogenic drugs include lysergic acid diethylamide and mescaline. They increase the activity of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine and, perhaps, dopamine in the central nervous system (CNS). In spite of their relatively low concentrations in the brain, both of these neurotransmitters have many important behavioral effects.",

    "51": "Astrocyte swelling is observed in different types of brain injury including hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This study investigates the role of astrocyte swelling on Zn2+ homeostasis in hypoosmotically treated astrocytes by using the Zn2+ indicators Newport-Green, Zinquin, and RhodZin-3. Hypoosmolarity (205 mosmol/L) led to a persistent increase of the intracellular \"free\" Zn2+ concentration [Zn2+](i) within 15 min, which was reversible after reinstitution of normoosmolarity (305 mosmol/L). The hypoosmotic [Zn2+](i) increase was abolished in the presence of the Zn2+ chelator TPEN, the NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and AP5, the antioxidant epigallocatechin gallate, and the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors L-NMMA and TRIM. Hypoosmolarity triggered nuclear accumulation of the metal response element-binding transcription factor MTF-1 and the specificity protein Sp1 and expression of the mRNAs encoding metallothionein and the Sp1-regulated peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). These effects were abolished by the Zn2+ chelator TPEN. The data suggest that astrocyte swelling affects gene expression by modulation of [Zn2+](i). Whereas Zn2+-dependent upregulation of metallothionein may help to counteract excessive astrocyte swelling and production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide species, stimulation of PBR expression may augment HE development.",

Theoretically, the least soluble inhalation agents should result in the fastest recoveries, but using additional injectable agents may negate this advantage. This study compared three inhalation agents for the maintenance of anaesthesia in sheep. Eighteen ewes that were to undergo orthopaedic surgery were allocated to one of three groups. Each group was premedicated with xylazine (0.1 mg/kg intramuscularly), anaesthesia was induced using ketamine (2 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) intravenously and analgesia provided by buprenorphine (0.008 mg/kg intramuscularly). Anaesthesia was then maintained with either isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane. Cardiopulmonary parameters were monitored throughout. All three inhalation agents provided adequate stable anaesthesia and there was no significant difference between the groups in their cardiopulmonary parameters or their recovery times. The mead (sd) postanaesthetic times to first swallow, first chewing attempts and ability to maintain their head lifted for five minutes were, respectively, 3.95 (2.53), 6.37 (3.68) and 32.8 (18.1) minutes for isoflurane, 3.62 (0.98), 7.66 (0.78) and 38.8 (16.6) minutes for sevoflurane, and 4.37 (1.65), 6.95 (1.52) and 29.8 (11.5) minutes for desflurane.

Sprague-Dawley rats with lumbar intrathecal catheters were tested for their thermal tail withdrawal response and for their paw flinches by formalin injection after intrathecal administration of various doses of JM 1232 (-). The effects of intraperitoneal administration were also investigated. In addition, behavioral side effects were examined. When antinociceptive effects were observed, the effects of pretreatment with flumazenil or naloxone for the maximum effective dose were evaluated. Eight rats were used in each dose of each group. Intrathecal JM 1232 (-) increased the tail flick latency and decreased the number of flinches in both phases 1 and 2 of the formalin test. These changes were antagonized by intrathecal flumazenil but not by naloxone. Intraperitoneal JM 1232 (-) had no effects on the tail flick latency, but decreased the number of flinches in both phases 1 and 2 of the formalin test. The latter was antagonized by intraperitoneal flumazenil and naloxone with bigger effects of flumazenil. Intraperitoneal JM 1232 (-) 3000 microg induced reversible motor disturbance. In conclusion, intrathecal JM 1232 (-) exerts antinociceptive effects on acute thermal and inflammatory stimuli through benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptors in the spinal cord. Intraperitoneal JM 1232 (-) was antinociceptive only against inflammatory stimulus and this is mediated mainly by benzodiazepine-GABA(A) receptors, but partially by micro-opioid receptors in the brain.",

The aim of the present study was to validate the use of image derived input functions (IDIF) as an alternative for arterial sampling for HRRT human brain studies. To this end, IDIFs were extracted from 3D ordinary Poisson ordered subsets expectation maximization (OP-OSEM) and reconstruction based partial volume corrected (PVC) OP-OSEM images. IDIFs, either derived directly from regions of interest or further calibrated using manual samples taken during scans, were evaluated for dynamic [(11)C]flumazenil data (n=6). Results obtained with IDIFs were compared with those obtained using blood sampler input functions (BSIF). These comparisons included areas under the curve (AUC) for peak (0-3.3 min) and tail (3.3-55.0 min). In addition, slope, intercept and Pearson's correlation coefficient of tracer kinetic analysis results based on IDIF and BSIF were calculated for each subject. Good peak AUC ratios (0.83+/-0.21) between IDIF and BSIF were found for calibrated IDIFs extracted from OP-OSEM images. This combination of IDIFs and images also provided good slope values (1.07+/-0.11). Improved resolution, as obtained with PVC OP-OSEM, changed AUC ratios to 1.14+/-0.35 and, for tracer kinetic analysis, slopes changed to 0.95+/-0.13. For all reconstructions, non-calibrated IDIFs gave poorer results (>61+/-34% higher slopes) compared with calibrated IDIFs. The results of this study indicate that the use of IDIFs, extracted from OP-OSEM or PVC OP-OSEM images, is feasible for dynamic HRRT data, thereby obviating the need for online arterial sampling.", 
    "60": "Methamphetamine is a widely abused psychostimulant. Abusing methamphetamine causes various adverse effects, such as immune dysfunction. The present study investigated the effect of diazepam, a central depressant, on methamphetamine-induced immunosuppression. BALB/c mice were daily administered with diazepam and methamphetamine (5mg/kg of each), either alone or in combination, for 5 consecutive days followed by sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA). Two days later the same dosing and sensitization regimen was repeated once. The production of serum anti-OVA antibodies, and the cellularity and functional activities of splenocytes were measured 7 days post the 2nd OVA sensitization. The results demonstrated that methamphetamine and/or diazepam significantly attenuated the production of OVA-specific IgM, IgG(1) and IgG(2a). Concordantly, splenocytes of mice administered with diazepam and/or methamphetamine produced less IL-4 and IFN-gamma upon ex vivo re-stimulation with OVA, as compared to the vehicle-treated control. In contrast, the cellularity and metabolic activity of splenocytes were not altered by the drug treatment. These results indicated that the central depressant diazepam did not affect methamphetamine-mediated immunosuppression. Rather, both drugs markedly suppressed antigen-specific antibody production and T-cell reactivity.",

In the first variant, animals get into a dark compartment from an open illuminated platform (platform), whereas in the other, from an enclosed illuminated one (box). PIC impaired retention performance in the \"platform-type\" IA, but not in the \"box-type\". DZP enhanced retention performance in both types of IA task. These results evidence critical differences between the two step-through inhibitory avoidance tasks used, that might be relevant not only for retention performance during memory retrieval, but also for the theoretical interpretations and conclusions obtained from behavioral results.",

Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are now emerging as first-line treatments for these anxiety disorders alongside the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and have been US Food and Drug Administration-approved for some of these indications as well. Benzodiazepines are also effective treatments for anxiety disorders, and although this medication class has the advantage of a rapid onset of action, their use is limited by their potential for abuse and lack of antidepressant properties. In addition to reviewing the clinical trials that have investigated the anxiolytic effects of these commonly used medications, we review the evidence for novel uses of other agents, including anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics, in anxiety disorders.", 
    "63": "The roots and rhizome of Valeriana officinalis L . s. l. are therapeutically used for their sedative and sleep-enhancing effects. Some of the active compounds found in commonly used extracts are the sesquiterpenic acids, especially valerenic acid, which was recently identified as a GABA (A) receptor modulator. To interact with this receptor in the brain, substances such as valerenic acid and its derivatives acetoxyvalerenic acid and hydroxyvalerenic acid have to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The aim of our study was to obtain BBB permeability data of these compounds for the first time and to elucidate possible transport pathways across our BBB in vitro model. Transport of valerenic acid, acetoxyvalerenic acid and hydroxyvalerenic acid was compared with the permeability of the GABA (A) modulator diazepam, which is known to penetrate into the central nervous system transcellularly by passive diffusion. Experiments were carried out with an established Transwell in vitro model based on the human cell line ECV304. Results indicated clearly that all three acids permeated significantly slower than diazepam. The ranking was confirmed in group studies as well as in single-substance studies after normalization to diazepam. Valerenic acid (1.06 +/- 0.29 microm/min, factor 0.03 related to diazepam) was the slowest to permeate in the group study, followed by hydroxyvalerenic acid (2.72 +/- 0.63 microm/min, factor 0.07 related to diazepam) and acetoxyvalerenic acid (3.54 +/- 0.58 microm/min, factor 0.09 related to diazepam). To elucidate the contribution of the paracellular transport, studies were performed at different tightness status of the cell layers reflected by different transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values. Results showed an exponential correlation between transport and TEER for all three acids, whereas diazepam permeated TEER independently. In summary, it is hypothesized that the investigated compounds from Valeriana officinalis L. S. L. can probably only pass through the BBB by a still unknown transport system and not transcellularly by passive diffusion.", 
    "64": "High-dosage buprenorphine (BUP) consumed concomitantly with benzodiazepines (BZDs) including flunitrazepam (FZ) may cause life-threatening respiratory depression despite a BUP ceiling effect and BZDs' limited effects on ventilation. However, the mechanism of BUP/FZ interaction remains unknown. We hypothesized that BUP may alter the disposition of FZ active metabolites in vivo, contributing to respiratory toxicity. Plasma FZ, desmethylflunitrazepam (DMFZ), and 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7-AFZ) concentrations were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Intravenous BUP 30 mg/kg pretreatment did not alter plasma FZ and 7-AFZ kinetics in Sprague-Dawley rats infused with 40 mg/kg FZ over 30 min, whereas resulting in a three-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) of DMFZ concentrations compared with control (p < 0.01). In contrast, BUP did not significantly modify plasma DMFZ concentrations after intravenous infusion of 7 mg/kg DMFZ, whereas resulting in a similar peak concentration to that generated from 40 mg/kg FZ administration. Regarding the effects on ventilation, BUP (30 mg/kg) as well as its combination with FZ (0.3 mg/kg) significantly increased PaCO(2), whereas only BUP/FZ combination decreased PaO(2) (p < 0.001). Interestingly, FZ (40 mg/kg) but not DMFZ (40 mg/kg) significantly increased PaCO(2) (p < 0.05), whereas DMFZ but not FZ decreased PaO(2) (p < 0.05). Thus, decrease in PaO(2) appears related to BUP-mediated effects on DMFZ disposition, although increases in PaCO(2) relate to direct BUP/FZ additive or synergistic dynamic interactions. We conclude that combined high-dosage BUP and FZ is responsible for increased respiratory toxicity in which BUP-mediated alteration in DMFZ disposition may play a significant role.",

Although adequate resolution of seven benzodiazepine analytes occurred under the influence of each of the chaotropic anions, the separation efficiency was highest when bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Tf(2)N(-)) was the modifier. We applied affinity CE in conjunction with linear analysis to determine the association constants for the formation of complexes between the Tf(2)N(-) anion and the benzodiazepines. According to the estimated Gibbs free energies, the interactions between this chaotropic anion and the benzodiazepines were either ion-dipole or ion-induced dipole interactions. Adding chaotropic salts as modifiers into CE buffers is a simple and reproducible technique for separating benzodiazepines.",

Free and total buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine, nicotine, opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, and metabolites were quantified in meconium from 10 infants born to women who had received buprenorphine during pregnancy. Neither cumulative nor total third-trimester maternal buprenorphine dose predicted meconium concentrations or neonatal outcomes. Total buprenorphine meconium concentrations and buprenorphine/norbuprenorphine ratios were significantly related to neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) scores >4. As free buprenorphine concentration and percentage free buprenorphine increased, head circumference decreased. Thrice-weekly urine tests for opiates, cocaine, and benzodiazepines and self-reported smoking data from the mother were compared with data from analysis of the meconium to estimate in utero exposure. Time of last drug use and frequency of use during the third trimester were important factors associated with drug-positive meconium specimens. The results suggest that buprenorphine and metabolite concentrations in the meconium may predict the onset and frequency of NAS.",

This study investigates the role of WS in acute ethanol and withdrawal from chronic ethanol consumption using elevated plus maze paradigm in rats. Acute administration of ethanol (1.5-2 g/kg, ip) triggered anxiolytic effect and withdrawal from prolonged ethanol (9% v/v ethanol, 15 days) consumption elicited enhanced behavioral despair (anxiety). Acute administration of WS (50 mg/kg, oral) potentiated the anxiolytic action of subeffective dose of ethanol (0.5 or 1 g/kg, ip). Moreover, the ethanol withdrawal anxiety was markedly antagonized in dose dependent manner by WS at 200 and 500 mg/kg or higher dose of ethanol (2.5 g/kg). However, co-administration of subeffective doses of WS (50 mg/kg, oral) and ethanol also attenuated withdrawal-induced anxiety due to chronic ethanol (9% v/v ethanol, 15 days) consumption. The results suggest the protective effect of WS in the management of ethanol withdrawal reactions.",

The diagnosis is clinical, requiring an urge to move the legs usually accompanied by an uncomfortable sensation, occurrence at rest, improvement with activity, and worsening of symptoms in the evening or at night. Restless legs syndrome causes sleep disturbances, is associated with anxiety and depression, and has a negative effect on quality of life. Treatment of secondary causes of restless legs syndrome may result in improvement or resolution of symptoms.

The MS/MS ion transitions monitored were m/z 343.1-->308.3, 359.0-->308.3, 359.0-->111.2 and 347.0-->312.0 for triazolam, alpha-OHTRZ, 4-OHTRZ and triazolam-D4, respectively. LLOQ of the analytical method was 0.05 ng/mL for triazolam and 0.1 ng/mL for alpha-OHTRZ and 4-OHTRZ. The within- and between-run precisions were less than 15.26% and accuracy was -8.08% to 13.33%. The method proved to be accurate and specific, and was applied to the pharmacokinetic study of triazolam in healthy Chinese volunteers.", 
    "94": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, optimal care for patients includes successful treatment of comorbidities that accompany COPD, including insomnia. Insomnia symptoms and associated disruption of sleep are prevalent in COPD patients but treatment with traditional benzodiazepines may compromise respiratory function. This review summarizes the efficacy and safety consideration of current drugs available for the treatment of insomnia in COPD patients including benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine receptor agonists such as eszopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon, sedating antidepressants such as trazodone, and the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon.", 
    "95": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs (AADs) induce weight gain and truncal adiposity, and even the metabolic syndrome (MetS), which may progress to IFG/IGT or DM. AAD effects in lean schizophrenic patients without MetS have not been documented, especially in terms of weight gain and changes in insulin sensitivity (S), beta-cell function (beta) and adiponectinaemia. We prospectively determined the effects of nine-month therapy with AADs on anthropometrics, metabolism and adiponectinaemia, including homoeostasis model assessment (HOMA) modelling of S, beta and betaxS (hyperbolic product, assessing individual beta adjusted for S). We analyzed 36 schizophrenic subjects (M/F: 24/12; Caucasian: n=23, North African: n=12, South Asian: n=1) aged 35+/- years (mean+/-one S.D.) free of MetS (NCEP-ATPIII), of whom 19 study completers were evaluated following AAD treatment. S, beta, betaxS and adiponectin were measured at zero, three and nine months. At nine months, BMI had risen from 22+/-2 to 25+/-2kg/m(2) (P<0.001) and waist circumference from 85+/-8 to 91+/-11cm (P<0.001), while adiponectin decreased from 10.4+/-5.1 to 7.4+/-3.8mug/mL (P<0.001). Blood pressure and lipids were unaffected. S decreased from 138+/-49 to 110+/-58% (P=0.006) and beta increased from 83+/-24 to 100+/-40% (P=0.034). As a result, betaxS decreased from 106+/-19 to 91+/-27% (P=0.015). Fasting glycaemia rose from 89+/-5 to 96+/-9mg/dL (P=0.007). On study completion, 21% had IFG. Long-term use of AADs in lean, drug-naive, schizophrenics initially free of MetS induced weight gain and truncal fat accumulation associated with decreases in adiponectin and hyperbolic product, explaining the increased fasting glycaemia and impaired fasting glucose seen in predisposed individuals.", 
    "96": "For several years, our laboratory has investigated the role for the HPA axis in cocaine reinforcement. Two classes of drugs that we have studied include corticosterone synthesis inhibitors (e.g., metyrapone) and benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g., oxazepam). In the experiments described in this manuscript, we tested the effects of various doses of metyrapone and oxazepam against several doses of self-administered cocaine. Behavioral, endocrine and pharmacokinetic measures of the effects of the combination of metyrapone and oxazepam on cocaine reward are presented. Combinations of metyrapone and oxazepam at doses that produced no observable effects when administered separately significantly reduced cocaine self-administration without affecting food-maintained responding during the same sessions. Changes in pharmacokinetics or endocrine function do not appear to mediate these effects, suggesting a central mechanism of action. Therefore, although these drugs produce their effects through distinct mechanisms, an additive effect on cocaine self-administration is obtained when these drugs are administered together, suggesting that combinations of low doses of metyrapone and oxazepam may be useful in reducing cocaine seeking with a reduced incidence of unwanted side effects and a decreased potential for abuse.", 
    "97": "Travel-related poisoning is an emerging social and public health emergency in Bangladesh but its cause and significance have not been determined. To investigate this syndrome we performed a prospective clinical study and retrospective analysis of hospital records in a general medicine unit of a public tertiary care teaching hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh, using toxicological analysis by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) and liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS). The participants of the prospective study were 130 consecutive patients aged 16-80 years who were admitted with central nervous system depression (Glasgow Coma Score 3-14) after using public transportation, in the absence of other abnormalities, from January through June 2004, and a convenience sample of 15 such patients admitted during 3 days in May 2006. In 2004-2006, travel-related poisoning increased from 6.1 to 9.5% of all admissions (210-309 of 3266-3843 per year), representing 46.6-55.7% of all admitted poisoning cases. Incidents were associated with bus (76%), taxi, train, and air travel, or local markets; 98% of patients remembered buying or accepting food or drinks before losing consciousness. Direct financial damage (missing property) was diverse and frequently existential. Among 94 urine samples analyzed by FPIA, 74% tested positive for benzodiazepines. Among 15 urine samples analyzed by LC-TOF MS, lorazepam was detected in all; five also contained diazepam or metabolites; nitrazepam was present in three. FPIA results obtained for these 15 samples were below the recommended cut-off in eight (53%; lorazepam only). Our findings show that the massive medicosocial emergency of travel-related poisoning in Bangladesh is the result of drug-facilitated organized crime and that benzodiazepine drugs are used to commit these crimes, suggesting modifications to the local emergency management of the victims of this type of poisoning. They also highlight the need for more research in the neglected field of acute poisoning in Bangladesh, and for criminal investigations of the use of benzodiazepine drugs in this country.", 
    "98": "The present study evaluated the extension of a new rat model of depression, repeated open-space swimming, which overcomes drawbacks of existing models, to mice. Mice were swum for 15 min daily in a large tank of tepid water for 4 days and thereafter at 4 day intervals for a period of 3 weeks. Some of the animals were provided with an active coping (escape) response. Variables measured included time floating, distance swum, immobility on a subsequent tail-suspension test, sucrose preference and brain cell proliferation (Ki67 immunohistochemistry) as well as responses to 2 antidepressant drugs, desmethylimipramine and fluoxetine, and 2 non-antidepressant drugs, haloperidol and diazepam. The repeated swims were found to increase time floating and tail-suspension immobility and to decrease distance swum, sucrose preference and brain cell proliferation. Both chronic antidepressant drugs as well as the active coping response attenuated the increased time floating while neither of the non-antidepressant drugs had this effect. The distance swum measure was found to be more variable. Chronic fluoxetine also reversed the increased tail-suspension immobility, reduced sucrose preference and reduced brain cell proliferation caused by the model. It is concluded that repeated open-space swim represents a useful new model of depression in the mouse.", 
    "99": "Cocaine is known to enhance nucleus accumbens dopamine (NAcc DA), to serve as a positive reinforcer and to produce negative effects, such as anxiety. The influence of diazepam on cocaine intake, cocaine-stimulated behavioral activity and NAcc DA was investigated using self-administration and experimenter-administered intravenous (i.v.) cocaine. In Experiment 1, rats were pretreated with diazepam (0.25 mg/kg) or saline (0.1 ml) 30 min prior to 20 daily 1-hour cocaine (0.75 mg/kg/injection) self-administration sessions. Cocaine intake increased for all animals across sessions, but was highest in diazepam-pretreated animals. Diazepam rats also self-administered their first cocaine injection of each session faster than controls. Experiment 2 utilized in vivo microdialysis to assess NAcc DA levels before and after experimenter-administered i.v. cocaine injections (0.75 mg/kg/injection x 2; 10-min interval) in diazepam- and saline-pretreated rats. Group differences were not revealed across basal and cocaine-stimulated NAcc DA assessments, indicating that diazepam did not decrease NAcc DA during cocaine self-administration. Findings that diazepam enhances cocaine self-administration and decreases cocaine response latency support the notion that cocaine-induced anxiety limits voluntary cocaine intake. It is further suggested that individual variations in cocaine-induced aversive effects may determine whether cocaine use is avoided or repeated.", 
    "100": "Many central nervous system active drugs can alter postural balance, increasing the risk of fractures. Anxiolytics and sedatives include the benzodiazepines, and these have been associated with a limited increase in the risk of fractures, even at low doses, probably from an increased risk of falls. No systematic differences have been shown between benzodiazepines with long and short half-lives. Although the increase in risk of fractures was limited, care must still be taken when prescribing for older fall-prone subjects at risk of osteoporosis. Neuroleptics may be associated with a decrease in bone mineral density and a very limited increase in fracture risk. Antidepressants are associated with a dose-dependent increase in the risk of fractures. The increase in relative risk of fractures seems to be larger with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) than with tricyclic antidepressants. The reason for this is not known but may be linked to serotonin effects on bone cells and the risk of falls. With the wide use of SSRIs, more research is needed. Lithium is associated with a decrease in the risk of fractures. This may be linked to its effects on the Wnt glycoprotein family, which is a specialised signalling system for certain cell types.",

Primary outcome measure of the driving test was the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP); i.e., the weaving of the car. Fixed effects model meta-analyses were performed. Effect size (ES) was computed using mean standardized (weighted) difference scores between treatment and corresponding placebo SDLP values.", 
    "103": "Ten studies, published from 1984 to 2002 (207 subjects), were included in the meta-analyses. The morning following bedtime administration, i.e. 10-11 hours after dosing, significant driving impairment was found for the recommended dose of various benzodiazepine hypnotics (ES=0.42; 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=0.14 to 0.71). Twice the recommended dose impaired driving both in the morning (ES=0.68; CI=0.39 to 0.97) and afternoon, i.e. 16-17 hours after dosing (ES=0.57; CI=0.26 to 0.88). Zopiclone 7.5 mg also impaired driving in the morning (ES=0.89; CI=0.54 to 1.23). Zaleplon (10 and 20 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg) did not affect driving performance the morning after dosing. Following middle-of-the-night administration, significantly impaired driving performance was found for zopiclone 7.5 mg (ES=1.51, CI=0.85 to 2.17), zolpidem 10 mg (ES=0.66, CI=0.13 to 1.19) and zolpidem 20 mg (ES=1.16, CI=0.60 to 1.72).

    "105": "The development of functional brain nuclear medicine techniques and their application in the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders, have contributed significantly in the illumination of the underlying pathophysiological processes of these disorders. Furthermore, Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) brain studies provide information in early diagnosis, differential diagnosis, development of new drugs, and monitoring the response to therapeutic management. SPECT and PET brain imaging require the use of radiopharmaceuticals that cross the intact Blood Brain Barrier (BBB). Such radiotracers have been used in regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF) SPECT and PET imaging and brain metabolism imaging with PET; these are well established methods in the diagnosis and management of various cerebral vascular diseases (e.g. stroke, dementia, epilepsy). Advances in radiotracer chemistry have resulted in the development of molecular imaging which represents the molecular and cellular processes of neuropsychiatric diseases. SPECT and PET molecular imaging has become available for the study of acetylcholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems, as well as for benzodiazepine and opioid receptors, with promising results. More studies are needed to validate the role of molecular imaging in the clinical practice of neuropsychiatric disorders.", 
    "106": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is an 18 kDa protein of the mammalian mitochondrial membrane and is a highly conserved protein among the mammalian. PBR is involved in numerous biological functions, including steroid biosynthesis, mitochondrial oxidative phosporylation and cell proliferation. The presence of PBR at the nuclear subcellular level has been demonstrated in aggressive breast cancer cell line and human glioma cells, where it seems to be involved in cell proliferation. In our previous studies we investigated the presence of nuclear PBR in different hepatic tumour cell lines with regard to binding to [3H] PK 11,195 and protein analysis. The results obtained by saturation binding experiments and Scatchard analysis of nuclear PBR density in parallel with the results on the growth curves of the cell lines tested, indicate that the nuclear PBR density correlates inversely with cell doubling time. Moreover, the cell line with high nuclear PBR proliferates in response to PBR ligands, whereas that with low nuclear PBR does not. All these findings support the idea that PBR could play a pivotal role in cell proliferation and this receptor protein could be potentially important either in early diagnosis or chemopreventive strategies against degenerative disease.", 
    "107": "We describe the anxiolytic-like effects of the first, selective metabotropic G-protein-coupled glutamate 7 (mGlu7) receptor agonist, N,N'-dibenzyhydryl-ethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), as measured in the modified stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) and the four-plate tests. Administration of AMN082 (3-6 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to Swiss mice produced anxiolytic-like effects in the modified SIH and four-plate tests. Moreover, it was ineffective as an anxiolytic in the SIH test in mGlu7 receptor knockout mice as compared with wild-type C57BL/6J littermate controls. In contrast, diazepam (1.25-5 mg/kg) significantly reduced SIH in both the wild-type and knockout animals. The anxiolytic-like effect of AMN082 in the SIH paradigm was abolished by pretreatment with flumazenil (10 mg/kg intraperitoneally). This indicates an involvement of gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic neurotransmission in AMN's anxiolytic actions. The results indicate that activation of the mGlu7 receptor produces anxiolytic-like effects via the modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid system.", 
    "108": "This study aimed to explore strain and species differences in the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the action of antipsychotic drugs, using prepulse inhibition (PPI), a model of sensory processing which is deficient in schizophrenia patients. We used automated startle boxes to compare the effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, (+/-)-8-hydroxy-dipropyl-amino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), on PPI in three mouse strains. Balb/c mice were then pretreated with antipsychotics, treated with 8-OH-DPAT or saline, and tested for PPI. 8-OH-DPAT treatment dose dependently increased PPI in Balb/c mice, but had less effect in 129Sv and C57Bl/6 mice. In Balb/c mice, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by the typical antipsychotic and dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, haloperidol and the third generation antipsychotic, aripiprazole, which has activity at both 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 receptors. The atypical antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone, had lesser effects. Similar to our earlier studies in rats, the present PPI results suggest that 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the action of some antipsychotic drugs in mice. Despite strain and species differences in the magnitude and direction of the effect of 8-OH-DPAT, downstream dopamine D2 receptor activation seems to be an important mediator. These comparative results allow a theoretical framework of receptor interactions, which may guide further studies on the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in schizophrenia.", 
    "109": "Activity of the cholinergic muscarinic system is associated with modulation of locomotor activity, although the precise mechanism remains unclear. The phospholipase C-beta1 knockout mouse displays both M1 muscarinic receptor dysfunction and a hyperactive locomotor phenotype. This mouse serves as an ideal model for the analysis of muscarinic modulation of locomotor activity. The clozapine metabolite N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC) has shown some promise as an alternative or adjunct treatment for psychotic disorders. NDMC shows strong muscarinic acetylcholine receptor affinities, which may contribute to the clinical efficacy of clozapine and account for the correlation between NDMC/clozapine ratio and treatment response. Administration of NMDC reversed a striking hyperactive phenotype in the phospholipase C-beta1 knockout mouse, whereas no significant effects were observed in wild-type animals. This highlights the potential role of muscarinic activity in the behavioural response to NDMC. The M1 muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine, however, also reduced the hyperactive phenotype of these mice, emphasizing the importance of muscarinic function in the control of locomotor behaviour, but also calling into question the specific mechanism of action of NMDC at muscarinic receptors.", 
    "110": "Inbred mouse strain comparisons are an important aspect of pharmacogenetic research, especially in strains known to differ in regard to specific neurotransmitter systems. DBA/2 mice differ from C57BL/6 mice in terms of both functional and anatomical characteristics of dopamine systems. Given the importance of D2 antagonism in the action of antipsychotic drugs and in theories regarding schizophrenia (i.e. the dopamine hypothesis), this study compared the discriminative stimulus properties of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine (CLZ) in C57BL/6 and DBA/2 inbred mice. DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice were trained to discriminate 2.5 mg/kg of CLZ from vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure and tested with a variety of antipsychotic drugs and selective ligands. Both strains of mice readily acquired the CLZ discrimination. The atypical antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and risperidone fully substituted for CLZ in both DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice, but ziprasidone fully substituted only in the C57BL/6 mice. The typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol produced partial substitution for CLZ in the DBA/2 mice, and the dopamine agonist amphetamine required a higher dose to reduce response rates significantly in DBA/2 mice as compared with C57BL/6 mice. Antagonism of serotonergic (5-HT2A/2B/2C) receptors with ritanserin and alpha1-adrenergic receptors with prazosin engendered CLZ-appropriate responding only in the C57BL/6 mice. Thus, while serotonergic and alpha-adrenergic antagonism were shown to be important for CLZ's discriminative cue in C57BL/6 mice, none of the selective ligands produced CLZ-appropriate responding in DBA/2 mice. Differences in dopamine-mediated functions between the two strains of mice may explain some of the findings in this study.", 
    "111": "Most schizophrenia patients do not inhibit their P50 auditory evoked potential to the second of duplicate auditory stimuli, reflecting a failure to inhibit responses to irrelevant sensory input. Typical antipsychotic drugs do not improve this deficit while some atypical antipsychotics do. A previous study using an animal model, deficient P20-N40 (which corresponds to the human P50) inhibitory processing in DBA/2 mice found that sensory inhibition was improved by clozapine, the prototypical atypical antipsychotic, but not by haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic. The improvement after clozapine was mediated by alpha7 nicotinic receptors. The present study addresses whether another atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, will also improve sensory inhibition deficits in the mouse model. In vivo electrophysiological recordings of the P20-N40 auditory evoked potential in anesthetized DBA/2 mice, which spontaneously exhibit a schizophrenia-like inhibitory processing deficit, were obtained after olanzapine alone (0.01, 0.033, 0.1, 0.33 mg/kg, IP) and the efficacious dose of olanzapine (0.033 mg/kg, IP) in combination with either the alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin or the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor antagonist di-hydro-beta-erythroidine. All doses of olanzapine produced improved P20-N40 inhibitory processing in DBA/2 mice. The normalization observed after the 0.033 mg/kg dose of olanzapine was due to a selective decrease in response to the second auditory stimulus indicating an increase in inhibitory processing. This improvement was blocked by pre-administration of alpha-bungarotoxin but not di-hydro-beta-erythroidine. Like clozapine, olanzapine acts via alpha7 nicotinic receptors to elicit improved inhibitory processing of auditory stimuli.",

Here, we identify potential mechanisms that elucidate a critical role for AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in epileptogenesis during this critical period in the developing brain. In a rodent model of neonatal seizures, we have shown previously that administration of antagonists of the AMPARs during the 48 h after seizures prevents long-term increases in seizure susceptibility and seizure-induced neuronal injury. Hypoxia-induced seizures in postnatal day 10 rats induce rapid and reversible alterations in AMPAR signaling resembling changes implicated previously in models of synaptic potentiation in vitro. Hippocampal slices removed after hypoxic seizures exhibited potentiation of AMPAR-mediated synaptic currents, including an increase in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous and miniature EPSCs as well as increased synaptic potency. This increased excitability was temporally associated with a rapid increase in phosphorylation at GluR1 S845/S831 and GluR2 S880 sites and increased activity of the protein kinases CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II), PKA, and PKC, which mediate the phosphorylation of these AMPAR subunits. Postseizure administration of AMPAR antagonists NBQX (2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfonyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline), topiramate, or GYKI-53773 [(1)-1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-acetyl-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-3,4-dihydro-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] attenuated the AMPAR potentiation, phosphorylation, and kinase activation and prevented the concurrent increase in in vivo seizure susceptibility. Thus, the potentiation of AMPAR-containing synapses is a reversible, early step in epileptogenesis that offers a novel therapeutic target in the highly seizure-prone developing brain.",

    "135": "The search for optimal sedation for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) continues. We hypothesized that the ultra-short acting opioid remifentanil combined with very low-dose midazolam would provide a better sedation and recovery profile compared to midazolam alone.", 
    "136": "41 consecutive outpatients scheduled for TEE received either IV midazolam (group M, 2.5 mg bolus plus 1 mg increments repeated as needed, n=18) or a combination of a low-dose IV bolus of midazolam (0.5 mg) plus an infusion of remifentanil (group RM, 0.1 mcg/kg/min, reduced to 0.08 mcg/kg/min after probe insertion, n=23). All patients received topical pharyngeal anesthesia with 2 puffs of lidocaine 4% spray. We recorded BP, SpO(2), HR, time-to-discharge (modified Aldrete score of 13), duration of procedure, resource utilization, complications, ease of probe introduction, ease and quality of the procedure. Patients' satisfaction with sedation was assessed using the Iowa Satisfaction with Anesthesia Scale (ISAS).", 
    "137": "Mean dose of midazolam in group M was 3.7+/-1.3 mg. Median time-to-discharge was significantly reduced in the RM group compared with the M group (5 (5-10) vs. 30 (5-240) min, p<0.0001), with 22 of the 23 group RM patients ready for \"street discharge\" within 5 min of removal of the TEE probe. Ease of probe insertion (p=0.001), resource utilization (p=0.0001), patient satisfaction (p=0.03) and overall ease and quality of the procedure (p=0.0001) were significantly better in the RM group than in the M group. No episodes of desaturation were observed.", 
    "138": "This is the first report of the use of an ultra-short acting opioid, remifentanil, combined with a low-dose of midazolam, as a sedative technique for outpatient TEE. In this pilot, non-randomized prospective study, remifentanil plus low-dose midazolam provided better sedation than our current practice of higher bolus doses of midazolam alone. This novel approach is associated with improved procedure tolerance, faster recovery and minimal resource utilization. A randomized, controlled study is under way to verify our preliminary results.", 
    "139": "Fatalities have been attributed to combinations of high-dose buprenorphine with benzodiazepines. In rats, high-dose buprenorphine combined with midazolam was shown to induce sustained respiratory acidosis, while buprenorphine alone did not. However, the effects of buprenorphine combined with pharmacological doses of benzodiazepines remain unknown. Our objective was to compare the acute effects of four selected benzodiazepines used intravenously at equi-efficacious doses in rats, alone and in combination with buprenorphine on sedation, respiratory rate and arterial blood gases. Buprenorphine (30 mg/kg) did not significantly modify sedation level or respiratory rate, but induced mild and transient effects on pH and PaCO(2) (P < 0.05). Similarly, despite having no effects on respiratory rate, nordiazepam (10 mg/kg), bromazepam (1 mg/kg) and oxazepam (12 mg/kg) mildly and transiently altered pH and PaCO(2) (P < 0.05), whereas clonazepam (5 mg/kg) did not. Buprenorphine combined with each benzodiazepine induced no significant effects on respiratory rate or blood gases, in comparison with buprenorphine alone. However, combinations of oxazepam or nordiazepam with buprenorphine significantly deepened sedation. While both combinations reduced respiratory rate, buprenorphine + 30 mg/kg clonazepam significantly increased PaCO(2) and buprenorphine + 30 mg/kg nordiazepam decreased PaO(2). In conclusion, not all benzodiazepines induce significant respiratory depression at therapeutic doses. We were unable to demonstrate significant effects on rat ventilatory parameters of buprenorphine combined with equi-efficacious pharmacological doses of benzodiazepines in comparison with buprenorphine alone. Our results may suggest that effects of these combinations are rather mild. Respiratory failure may, however, result from the association of buprenorphine with elevated doses of benzodiazepines.", 
    "140": "Olanzapine is an efficacious drug often used as a first-line medication in the treatment for schizophrenia. However, weight gain is a notable adverse drug reaction of this medication in a proportion of patients and a major cause of noncompliance. Several hypotheses, including a contribution from hormonal, physiological and environmental factors, have been postulated. In this study, we aimed to analyze a possible association of genetic polymorphisms at four important candidate genes involved in appetite regulation and antipsychotic-induced metabolic syndrome with olanzapine-induced weight gain.", 
    "141": "A total of 154 schizophrenia subjects were recruited in a systematic, 6-week, open-label trial of olanzapine.

    "146": "Significant differential effects were evident on the ability to maintain and rapidly shift mental set within a psychomotor task, with patients in the conventional medication group consistently making more errors over time until the 12-month follow-up, when the olanzapine group made significantly more errors. Significant differential effects were also evident on delayed memory, with patients receiving olanzapine improving more steadily over time until the 12-month follow-up, when patients in the conventional group were able to recall significantly more. Positive and negative symptomatology was a significant, inversely related covariate on most of the cognitive measures examined.",

    "148": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that requires lifelong treatment, and therefore information on the cardiovascular safety and tolerance of antipsychotics is of significant clinical importance. Atypical antipsychotics have been used to treat schizophrenia patients since the 1990s, and more and more patients have been switched to these from typical antipsychotics; however, there is still no accessible evaluation tool for assessing cardiovascular safety. In this study, we used a computer-assisted 5-min measurement of resting heart rate variability (HRV) in schizophrenia patients who were switched to atypical antipsychotic agents (amisulpride and olanzapine) due to severe side effects (tardive dyskinesia). In 15 patients who switched to amisulpride and 18 to olanzapine, HRV was evaluated before the medication was switched, and patients were followed up every month for 3 months after the switch. Frequency-domain analyses of short-term and stationary respiratory rate (RR) intervals were performed to evaluate low-frequency power (LF; 0.04-0.15 Hz), high-frequency power (HF; 0.15-0.40 Hz), the ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF), and LF in normalized units (LF%). Our results showed significant increases in the mean, variance and HF of RR intervals in the amisulpride group, but not in the olanzapine group. These results indicate that amisulpride has a more vagotonic effect, suggesting greater cardiovascular safety as compared with olanzapine when subjects are switched from typical antipsychotic agents.", 
    "149": "Sleep is frequently impaired in postmenopausal women. Progesterone prompted benzodiazepine-like effects on sleep EEG in young normal male subjects. Aim of this study was to test if treatment with progesterone improves sleep after menopause. A randomised double blind crossover design study with 2 treatment intervals of 21 days duration separated by a 2 weeks washout was performed. An oral dose of 300 mg micronized progesterone was given each for 21 days. At the beginning and the end of the two intervals a sleep EEG was recorded and cognitive performance was assessed in 10 healthy postmenopausal women (age: 54-70 years). Progesterone treatment led to a decrease of intermittent time spent awake. During the first third of the night rapid eye movement (REM) sleep increased. The spectral analysis of the EEG resulted in no significant differences of the power spectra. Progesterone did not affect cognitive performance. In summary progesterone demonstrated a distinct sleep promoting effect by reduction of time of wake without impairing cognitive functions during daytime. As possible mechanisms of progesterone a GABA-agonistic effect and the regulation of gene expression via the progesterone receptor are discussed. Progesterone might be useful in the treatment of sleep disturbances of postmenopausal women.", 
    "150": "Some atypical antipsychotics have been linked to an increased propensity for weight gain and metabolic disturbances, including type II diabetes. The objective of this study was to investigate an animal model to help understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. Female, Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with olanzapine (2.0 or 7.5 mg/kg, via osmotic mini-pump) for 4 weeks, followed by the hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp procedures to assess insulin sensitivity and secretion in vivo. Changes in body weight, visceral fat, food intake and locomotor activity were also assessed. Hepatic glucose production (R(A)) was increased in the hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamp for both treatment groups compared to control rats, while the high-dose olanzapine group had decreased peripheral glucose utilization (R(D)). No changes in insulin secretion were detected in the hyperglycemic clamp. Olanzapine did not change body weight or food intake, but did result in significant accumulation of visceral fat and decreases in locomotor activity. Like others, we found that a rodent model for antipsychotic-related weight gain per se is not tenable. However, chronic treatment with olanzapine was found to confer both hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance independent of weight gain, indicating a direct effect on glucose dysregulation.", 
    "151": "Nearly one half of the adult population in the U.S. experience some symptoms of insomnia (difficulties with getting to sleep, maintaining sleep, and/or sleep quality) on a weekly basis. Although most people with insomnia complain primarily of issues related to sleep maintenance and quality, current therapeutic approaches, including GABA(A) agonists, off label antidepressant use, H(1) antagonists and melatonin agonists, primarily address sleep onset latency. The overall sleep architecture, especially that of the deeper stages of NREM sleep known as slow wave sleep (SWS), plays a crucial role in restorative, restful sleep. Through the 5-HT(2A) receptor, serotonin plays an active role in the regulation of sleep architecture. Antagonists / inverse-agonists of 5-HT(2A), such as APD125, volinanserin, eplivanserin, pruvanserin and pimavanserin, are currently being investigated as therapeutics that could improve the treatment of sleep maintenance and quality in people with insomnia.", 
    "152": "Effect of 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), a long-chain alpha, beta unsaturated aldehyde product, generated by the oxidation of omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids on the sensitivity of selected neurotransmitter receptors was studied in PC-12 cells. Cytotoxicity profiling was carried out at varying concentrations of HNE (0.1-50microM) for 30min to 24h. Trypan blue dye exclusion, MTT, LDH release and neutral red uptake (NRU) assays were carried out to assess the cytotoxicity of HNE. Cytotoxic response was found to be significant at 2h of exposure. Cytotoxicity of HNE at 50microM was exerted even at 90min. HNE 10-50microM was found to be cytotoxic, whereas, 2-5microM causes physiological stress only and 1-0.1microM non-cytotoxic. Effect on dopamine, cholinergic, serotonin and benzodiazepine receptors was studied at varying concentrations of HNE (1, 10, 25 and 50microM for 1-8h). A significant decrease in binding of 3H-QNB, 3H-Fluinitrazepam and 3H-Ketanserin, known to label cholinergic (muscarinic), benzodiazepine and serotonin (5HT(2A)) receptors respectively was observed at 1h exposure of PC-12 cells to HNE at 25 and 50microM concentrations. The decrease in the binding of (3)H-Spiperone, known to label dopamine (DA-D2) receptors was evident at 4h of exposure of PC-12 cells to HNE. The decrease in the binding with DA-D2 receptors continued till 8h. Effect on the binding of (3)H-Fluinitrazepam and 3H-Ketanserin appeared to be maximum at 25 and 50microM concentrations of HNE for 4h and 8h. The PC-12 cells appear to be vulnerable to cytotoxic concentrations of HNE. Experimental HNE exposure provides an intriguing model of toxicant-cell interactions involving neurotransmitter receptors in HNE neurotoxicity.",

Despite increasing knowledge of their adverse effects, such as sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, and dependence on long-term use, and the recent advent of better alternatives, their use continues largely unabated. The paper under review assesses the sparse high-quality data related to efficacy (denoted by the dropout rate for failure to respond), effectiveness (dropout rate for any reason) and dropout for adverse effects. The conclusion is that efficacy was significantly higher for the drugs as compared with placebo; by contrast, no convincing evidence was found of any short-term effectiveness: and adverse effects were 1.5-times more frequent in the drug-treated patients. Various reasons for these results are discussed. I point out the changes in diagnostic criteria over the years and the lack of accepted methods of assessing estimates of effectiveness in clinical practice. Excessive prescribing of these controversial drugs is likely to continue.",

    "158": "Adjunctive use of methylphenidate, a central stimulant, has been considered as a potential therapeutic choice for patients with refractory unipolar depression, geriatric depression, bipolar depression, and depression secondary to a medical illness. We present a case of psychotic unipolar depression in which the patient responded significantly to the adjunctive use of methylphenidate. A 45-year-old woman had melancholic depressive symptoms and mood incongruent psychotic features during her second episode of unipolar depression. She attempted suicide by hanging herself and was forcibly hospitalized. She was initially treated with venlafaxine (262.5 mg/d), olanzapine (20 mg/d), and benzodiazepines. However, she responded unsatisfactorily to the combination treatment. Because her family refused electroconvulsive treatment, we added methylphenidate to her medications for adjunctive use. The dose of methylphenidate was started at a dose of 5 mg/d. It was not until the patient received 30 mg/d of methylphenidate that her persistent psychosis and severe depression were substantially improved. She tolerated her medications well and did not report any side effects. She was discharged in a stable condition 2 weeks after the adjunctive use of methylphenidate. The patient's methylphenidate was gradually tapered and finally discontinued. To date, she remains well and is regularly followed up at our outpatient clinic. Our case suggests that adjunctive use of methylphenidate can be a therapeutic option in treating some patients with psychotic unipolar depression who do not adequately respond to the combination treatment of an antidepressant and an atypical antipsychotic. Further controlled studies are warranted to verify this.",

Serum olanzapine concentrations were orders of magnitude higher than those associated with therapeutic doses, and remained elevated for several days after ingestion. Both patients made a full recovery with only supportive care, despite having initial serum drug concentrations > 2500 microg/l. These reports indicate the potential for olanzapine ingestion to cause coma that may persist for several days after overdose.",

    "164": "Cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4) is the most abundant cytochrome P450 in adult human liver and small intestine and oxidizes numerous clinically, physiologically, and toxicologically important compounds. The metabolic activity of CYP3A4 in patients varies at least 10-fold in vivo, and CYP3A4 genetic variants are considered one of the causes of individual differences. The cDNAs for the CYP3A4(*)2 (S222P), (*)7 (G56D), (*)16 (T185S), and (*)18 (L293P) mutant alleles, found in high frequencies in Caucasians or Asians, were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system. Midazolam (MDZ), testosterone (TST), and nifedipine (NIF) were used to assess the catalytic activities of the CYP3A4 wild type (CYP3A4.1) and its variants. The catalytic activities of CYP3A4.2 and CYP3A4.16 were reduced (lower V(max) and increased K(m) relative to CYP3A4.1) for all substrates. The CYP3A4.7 showed lower V(max) values for MDZ and NIF (60 and 84%, respectively) and a higher K(m) (2-fold) for TST but not for MDZ or NIF. Although CYP3A4.18 showed low V(max) values for MDZ, NIF, and TST (88, 72, and 80% of CYP3A4.1, respectively), no significant differences were identified in the ratio V(max)(/K)(m). In summary, CYP3A4.2 and CYP3A4.16 exhibited significantly lower activity for MDZ, TST, and NIF oxidations than CYP3A4.1. Therefore, drugs metabolized by only CYP3A should be carefully administered to patients with these alleles.",

    "171": "Seasonal variation in daily food intake is a well-documented phenomenon in many organisms including wild-type coho salmon where the appetite is noticeably reduced during periods of decreased day length and low water temperature. This reduction may in part be explained by altered production of cholecystokinin (CCK) and growth hormone (GH). CCK is a hormone produced in the brain and gut that mediates a feeling of satiety and thus has an inhibitory effect on food intake and foraging behaviour. Growth hormone (GH) enhances feeding behaviour and consequently growth, but its production is reduced during winter. The objectives of this study were: first, to compare the seasonal feeding behaviour of wild and GH-transgenic coho salmon; second, to determine the behavioural effect of blocking the action of CCK (by using devazepide) on the seasonal food intake; and third, to measure CCK expression in brain and gut tissues between the two genotypes across seasons. We found that, in contrast to wild salmon, food intake in transgenic salmon was not reduced during winter indicating that seasonal control of appetite regulation has been disrupted by constitutive production of GH in transgenic animals. Blocking of CCK increased food intake in both genotypes in all seasons. The increase was stronger in wild genotypes than transgenic fish; however blocking CCK in wild-type fish in winter did not elevate appetites to levels observed in the summer. The response to devazepide was generally faster in transgenic than in wild salmon with more rapid effects observed during summer than during winter, possibly due to a higher temperature in summer. Overall, a seasonal effect on CCK mRNA levels was observed in telencephalon with levels during winter being higher compared to the summer in wild fish, but with no seasonal effect in transgenic fish. No differences in seasonal CCK expression were found in hypothalamus. Higher levels of CCK were detected in the gut of both genotypes in winter compared to summer. Thus, CCK appears to mediate food intake among seasons in both wild-type and GH-transgenic salmon, and an altered CCK regulation may be responsible at least in part for the seasonal regulation of food intake.",

TDM was performed 632 times in the risperidone group of 34 patients and 563 times in the olanzapine group of 33 patients. The logarithm of plasma concentrations were analysed through time by piecewise linear mixed model regressions adjusted for the logarithm of dose.",

The risperidone conversion to 9-hydroxy-risperidone by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 suggests CYP2D6 inhibition or DNA down-regulation in the first 2 months. Olanzapine showed a C/D accumulation peak at 4 months of 31% above baseline, and a slower increase to 47% above baseline at 18 months with no clear plateau.", 
    "175": "We identified five potential perturbations in the pharmacokinetics of risperidone and olanzapine that could potentially lead to adverse drug reactions. These long-term effects would not be captured by a standard 5-day pharmacokinetic TDM developmental testing model for antipsychotics, and a new model for characterizing variation in C/D by time course is therefore proposed. The time course of the accumulations identified suggests that both CYP inhibition and DNA regulatory mechanisms may be involved in the metabolism of these drugs. Long-term TDM can optimize treatment with risperidone and olanzapine and antipsychotics in general."
