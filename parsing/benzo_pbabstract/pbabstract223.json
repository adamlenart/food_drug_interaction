Zopiclone significantly shortened the sleep latency the following morning, whereas zolpidem did not, perhaps due to the difference in the elimination half-lives between the compounds. No significant effect was observed for either drug on the ERP indices, including the P3, mismatch negativity and negative difference components. At a clinically prescribed dosage these sleep inducers have no remarkable effect on cognitive or attentional functions but increase sleepiness of the subjects.",

    "2": "A total of 252 patients scheduled for diagnostic upper endoscopy were randomly assigned to 4 groups: (1) sedation with midazolam and placebo pharyngeal spray (midazolam group), (2) placebo sedation and lidocaine pharyngeal spray (lidocaine group), (3) placebo sedation and placebo pharyngeal spray (placebo group), and (4) no intravenous cannula/pharyngeal spray (control group). The endoscopist and the patient assessed the procedure immediately after the examination. Another questionnaire was sent to the patients 2 weeks later.", 
    "3": "Patients in the midazolam group rated the examination easier and less uncomfortable compared with those in the other groups. The differences were especially evident in the questionnaires completed 2 weeks after the examination ( p < 0.001). Lidocaine did not significantly improve patient tolerance. However, endoscopists found the procedure easier in patients in the lidocaine group compared with the midazolam ( p < 0.01) and control groups ( p < 0.01) but not the placebo group.", 
    "4": "Routine administration of midazolam for sedation increased patient tolerance for upper endoscopy. However, endoscopists found intubation to be more difficult in sedated vs. non-sedated patients. Topical pharyngeal anesthesia did not enhance patient tolerance, but it did make upper endoscopy technically easier compared with endoscopy in patients sedated with midazolam without topical pharyngeal anesthesia, and in patients who had no sedation or pharyngeal anesthesia, but not in patients who received placebo sedation and placebo pharyngeal anesthesia.", 
    "5": "Long-term management of chronic pain with opioids may be stable over time or may be complicated by problematic dose increases, drug dependencies, and toxic effects. To determine clinical contexts in which stability or problems may occur, we examined the pharmacologic and clinical correlates of long-term prescriptions of oxycodone/acetaminophen, a commonly prescribed short-acting opioid formulation.", 
    "6": "We analyzed linked, archival outpatient pharmacy and clinical databases from the New England Veterans Integrated Service Network between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2001. Durations, doses, and dose changes of oxycodone/acetaminophen prescriptions and concurrent use of long-acting opioids, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and anticonvulsants were determined.", 
    "7": "In aggregate, 2195 patients (31% with cancer diagnoses per the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification) received oxycodone/acetaminophen for more than 9 months at a mean prescribed daily dose of 3.9 tablets per day (range, 0.5-13.0 tablets per day) with minimal changes in daily prescribed mean dose over time. Patients with cancer were more likely than other patients to receive concurrent long-acting opioids. For patients without cancer, a higher mean daily dose was associated with duration, older age, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and/or AIDS, and with prescribed benzodiazepines and long-acting opioids; concurrent benzodiazepine prescriptions were associated with anticonvulsant prescriptions and with psychogenic pain and alcohol abuse and/or dependence diagnoses.", 
    "8": "In veteran patients who received long-term oxycodone/acetaminophen prescriptions, mean daily doses were typically modest and stable, likely reflecting a selection of patients with successful, long-term management. Among patients without cancer, however, associations of higher oxycodone/acetaminophen doses with benzodiazepine prescriptions, psychogenic pain, alcohol abuse, and HIV/AIDS may portend opioid prescription management problems.", 
    "9": "The aim of this study was to compare subjective (Ramsay sedation score, RSS) with objective electroencephalogram-based bispectral index (BIS) assessment, and to validate the appropriate BIS range for measurement of conscious sedation in interventional procedures.", 
    "10": "One hundred patients undergoing sedo-analgesia (midazolam and fentanyl) for interventional gastrointestinal procedures were divided into two groups. In group A (n=30) sedation was guided by the RSS with the operator blinded to the BIS recording. In group B (n=70) the operator titrated intravenous sedation to maintain an optimal BIS, predetermined from the results in group A. Recovery time, procedure duration, physiological parameters and unplanned events were recorded in both groups.", 
    "11": "There was a significant correlation between the BIS and RSS (p<0.001). BIS values of 87.2 and 80.9 corresponded to an RSS of 3 and 4, respectively. The optimal BIS level was defined as 80-85. Fifty-seven point five percent of readings were within this range in group B compared with 26.5% in group A (p<0.001). Sedation approaching general anaesthesia (BIS<60) occurred in 5.5% of patients in group A but not in group B. Mean recovery time, duration of procedure, midazolam and fentanyl doses were significantly reduced in group B. Unplanned events were reduced from 27 to 17%, but this was not statistically significant (p=0.29).", 
    "12": "BIS monitoring enables more effective titration of sedatives to maintain a suitable level of consciousness, whilst reducing procedure time. The BIS offers an objective, safe and reliable measure of sedation, without disturbing either patient or operator. BIS monitoring raises the standard of patient care, and in our view, should be used to augment standard assessment.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether ziprasidone would reduce the acute effect of olanzapine on feeding behaviour. The results suggest that ziprasidone suppresses the significant increases in food intake produced by olanzapine, indicating that it has an intrinsic protective mechanism against drug-induced increases in food intake.", 
    "14": "Minocycline has been reported to exert neuroprotection through inhibition of inflammatory processes and of mitochondrial cell death pathway. To further characterize the neuroprotective effect of minocycline, we determined its efficacy in different neuronal damage paradigms involving inflammation or mitochondrial dysfunction. In transient global ischaemia in gerbils, minocycline reduced hippocampal neuronal damage measured by peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites density, a marker of microglial activation. The antiinflammatory properties of minocycline were confirmed on the model of carrageenan-induced paw oedema in rats. The use of two experimental animal models involving administration of mitochondrial toxins inhibiting a different complex of the mitochondrial respiratory chain permitted the exploration of the mitochondrial impact of minocycline. Although minocycline exhibited a marked efficacy in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; complex I inhibitor)-induced neurotoxicity in mice, it was ineffective in malonate (complex II inhibitor)-induced striatal lesion in rats. In vitro investigations on energized mitochondria isolated from rat liver showed that minocycline (1 microM) did not inhibit the swelling induced by MPP+(1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium). Moreover, higher concentrations of minocycline induced swelling. From these experiments, the neuroprotective activity of minocycline appears more related to its antiinflammatory activity than to a direct beneficial action on mitochondria.", 
    "15": "We examined the involvement of the spinal muscarinic receptors in the clonidine-induced antiallodynic effects. Mechanical sensitivity was assessed by stimulating the hind paw with von Frey filaments. In streptozotocin-treated (200 mg/kg, i.v.) diabetic mice, hypersensitivity to mechanical stimulation appeared 3 days after streptozotocin administration, and persisted for 11 days. This mechanical hypersensitivity (allodynia) was inhibited by the intrathecal (i.t.) injection of clonidine. The muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (i.t.) and alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine (i.t. or subcutaneous injection) abolished the antiallodynic effect of clonidine. The effect was mimicked by the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine, but not by the muscarinic M2 receptor antagonist methoctoramine or the muscarinic M3 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP (4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide). In addition, the mechanical hypersensitivity in diabetic mice was reduced by the selective muscarinic M1 receptor agonist McN-A-343 (4-(m-chlorophenyl-carbamoyloxy)-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride) (i.t.). These results suggest that spinal muscarinic M1 receptors participate in the antiallodynic effect of clonidine in diabetic mice.",

Z-338 did not produce by itself any currents in oocytes expressing muscarinic M1, M3 receptors or muscarinic M2 receptors/G protein-gated inward rectifying K+ channels (Kir3.1 channels). In oocytes expressing muscarinic M1 receptors, Z-338 inhibited the acetylcholine-induced Ca2+ -activated Cl- current with an IC50 of 1.8 microM. In oocytes expressing muscarinic M2 receptors/Kir3.1 channels, Z-338 inhibited the acetylcholine-induced K+ currents with an IC50 of 10.1 microM, whereas in oocytes expressing muscarinic M3 receptors, Z-338 did not inhibit the acetylcholine-induced Ca2+ -activated Cl- current in a concentration-dependent manner. These results indicate that Z-338 is a potent antagonist not for muscarinic M3 receptor but for both muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors. Thus, Z-338 is a gastrokinetic agent with a unique profile.",

For example, antiglutamatergic agents such as lamotrigine may relieve depression but have no impact on mania. Atypical antipsychotics with the dual effect of blocking dopamine and serotonin receptors in the brain decrease psychosis, mania, and, according to some preliminary indications, possibly depression. The impact of these properties has been borne out in clinical studies. Mood stabilizers such as lithium and valproate stabilize mood by significantly decreasing the manic and hypomanic symptoms of bipolar disorder, although they can have effects on depressive symptoms too. Lamotrigine stabilizes mood by reducing depression. The atypical anti-psychotics have been shown to be effective either as monotherapy or in combination with mood stabilizers.",

Potentially inappropriate drug therapies available through the Ontario Drug Benefit Plan (ODB) and also in the US were frequently prescribed in both Ontario and the US. Differences in prescribing patterns of individual drug therapies were noted between the two countries. Specifically, in the rarely appropriate category, diazepam, a long half-life benzodiazepine, was much more frequently dispensed in Ontario than in the US (3.18% vs 1.37%).

NNRTIs bind in a region not associated with the active site of the enzyme. Within the NNRTI category, there is a set of inhibitors commonly referred to as TIBO inhibitors. Fifty TIBO inhibitors were used in the work to build 3-D QSAR models. The two known crystal structures of complexes are used to investigate and validate the docking protocol. The results show that the docking simulations reproduce the crystal complexes very well with RMSDs of approximately 1 A and approximately 0.6 A for 1REV and 1COU, respectively. The alignment of molecules and \"active\" conformation selection are the key to a successful 3D-QSAR model by CoMFA. The flexible docking (Autodock3) was used on determination of \"active\" conformation and molecular alignment, and CoMFA and CoMSIA were used to develop 3D-QSAR models of 50 TIBOs in the work. The 3D-QSAR models demonstrate a good ability to predict the activity of studied compounds (r2 = 0.972, 0.944, q2 = 0.704, 0.776). It is shown that the steric and electrostatic properties predicted by CoMFA contours can be related to the binding structure of the complex. The results demonstrate that the combination of ligand-based and receptor-based modeling is a powerful approach to build 3D-QSAR models.", 
    "56": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated with either acute or chronic liver failure. More than two decades ago, the role of altered GABAergic neurotransmission was proposed following evidence of \"increased GABAergic tone\" in HE. Increased GABAergic tone was based on several observations: (i) Similarity of visual evoked response potential patterns between rabbits with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure and animals treated with various allosteric agonists of the GABA receptor complex (GRC). (ii) Spontaneous activities of isolated Purkinje neurons from rabbits with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatic failure are more depressed by GRC modulator compounds compared to normal animals. (iii) Flumazenil, a high selective benzodiazepine antagonist at the GRC, ameliorates behavioral symptoms and EEG activity in some HE patients. Pathophysiological mechanisms put forward to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE include (1) increase in brain GABA content due to increased brain GABA uptake through altered permeability of the blood brain barrier, (2) alteration of the integrity of constituents of the GRC, and (3) increase of endogenous GRC modulators such as benzodiazepines (and more recently neurosteroids) with potent agonist properties at the GRC. Studies performed subsequently excluded alterations of either GABA content or GRC integrity in favor of increased brain concentrations of endogenous agonists. While the role of endogenous benzodiazepines remains controversial, the presence of neurosteroids with GABA agonist properties affords a plausible explanation for increased GABAergic tone in HE.", 
    "57": "It has been suggested that alterations of GABAergic neurotransmission are implicated in the pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Increased concentrations of endogenous benzodiazepines with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex were proposed as a pathophysiological mechanism to explain increased GABAergic tone in HE. However, results of controlled trials with benzodiazepine receptor antagonists have yielded equivocal results and increases in benzodiazepine levels in body fluids of cirrhotic patients were suggested to be largely accounted for by previous pharmaceutical benzodiazepine intake. In the present study the issue of benzodiazepine receptor ligands in brains of cirrhotic patients, and their contribution to alterations of GABA-A receptor complex in HE are addressed. \"Benzodiazepine-like\" ligands were present in trace amounts in autopsied brain tissue from control subjects (0.2 +/- 0.2 ng/g tissue), and from cirrhotic patients not previously exposed to benzodiazepine medication (0.8 +/- 0.4 ng/g tissue). In contrast, these ligands accumulate in brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines by up to 200-fold (161.5 +/- 93.2 DE ng/g tissue). Brain extracts from cirrhotic patients increased the binding of the GABA-A receptor agonist [3H]muscimol. This increase was minimal with brain extracts from controls (6.8 +/- 2.8%), but was significant with brain extracts from cirrhotic patients without (29.4 +/- 2.7%), or with (55.1 +/- 7.6%) previous exposure to benzodiazepines. Addition of flumazenil, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist did not significantly modify the increase of [3H]muscimol binding by brain extracts from patients without prior exposure to benzodiazepines and only partially inhibited the increase of [3H]muscimol binding in presence of brain extracts from cirrhotic patients previously exposed to benzodiazepines. These findings suggest the presence of nonbenzodiazepine substances (possibly neurosteroids) with positive allosteric modulatory properties at the GABA-A receptor complex in brain in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "58": "Fatal monointoxications with benzodiazepines, for instance with a suicidal intention, are exceptional findings. We report the autopsy case of an 82-year-old woman who died due to a suicidal monointoxication with Rohypnol 1 mg film tablets (therapeutical agent: flunitrazepam). 0.065 mg/L flunitrazepam and 0.34 mg/L 7-aminoflunitrazepam were detected in a postmortem heart blood sample and toxicological analysis revealed the metabolite 7-aminoflunitrazepam in gastric contents, too. At external examination, a bluish-turquoise coloration was seen around the woman's right nostril and within the oral cavity. At autopsy, similar coloration phenomena were seen on the mucosa of the distal esophagus and the stomach. Formerly, bluish stains on mouth and nostrils were considered indicative of intoxications with organophosphates such as parathion (E 605). More recently, case reports accumulate where an intoxication with Rohypnol 1 film tablets (containing the coloring agent indigocarmine in its core) have to be considered as a potential differential diagnosis of such coloration phenomena.", 
    "59": "Assessing brain death may sometimes be difficult, with isoelectric EEG following psychotrope overdoses or normal cerebral blood flow (CBF) persisting despite brain death in the case of ventricular drainage or craniotomy. A 42-year-old man, resuscitated after cardiac arrest following a suicidal ingestion of ethanol, bromazepam and zopiclone, was admitted in deep coma. On day 4, his brainstem reflexes and EEG activity disappeared. On day 5, his serum bromazepam concentration was 817 ng/ml (therapeutic: 80-150). The patient was unresponsive to 1 mg of flumazenil. MRI showed diffuse cerebral swelling. CBF assessed by angiography and Doppler remained normal and EEG isoelectric until he died on day 8 with multiorgan failure. There was a discrepancy between the clinically and EEG-assessed brain death, and CBF persistence. We hypothesized that brain death, resulting from diffuse anoxic injury, may lead, in the absence of major intracranial hypertension, to angiographic misdiagnoses.

During the first stage of the present experiment, the recovery from human serum and urine of some psychoactive drugs with acidic or basic properties was studied. The efficiency of this process was determined using solutions of drug standards added to serum or urine. Classic liquid-liquid extraction, as well as solid phase extraction methods were compared. The efficiency of recovery was checked using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results of this study confirm the usefulness of RP-18 sorbent from Merck and the importance in terms of quantitative analysis of the technique selected for isolation of the xenobiotic from the biological material. The second stage of the experiment was aimed at qualitative determination of some narcotics using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). By stepwise comparison and elimination it was possible to develop an optimal system of chromatographic separation using laminar staining. The proposed system and the conditions for separation ofxenobiotics with six selected elution systems and laminar visualization confirm the feasibility of separating 22 psychoactive drugs. The practical use of the system is limited mainly to screening. Conditions for quantitative analysis of diazepam, tramadol, and pethidine in biological material (serum, urine) using high-performance liquid chromatography, as well as morphine in serum using an immunoenzyme assay have been developed. The procedures have been applied to analysis of narcotics and psychoactive drugs administered prior to anesthesia (morphine, diazepam, pethidine) or for suppression of post-operative pain (morphine, tramadol) in 31 patients of an intensive care unit. 10 ml of blood was drawn at fixed times: 30 minutes prior to surgery (S1), at start of surgery (S2), 60 minutes later (S3), 30 minutes after administration of analgesic (S4), and 60 minutes after administration of analgesic (S5). Urine samples were also collected: immediately after surgery (M1) and 90 minutes after administration of analgesic (M2).",

In this study, the ability of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to reinstate previously reinforced responding for alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages was assessed in rats using a novel lick-based paradigm.", 
    "80": "Rats were initially given free access to beer (containing 4.5% ethanol v/v), near-beer (a beverage that looks and tastes like beer but contains <0.5% ethanol v/v) or isocaloric sucrose in their home cages for 3 weeks. They were then trained to lick at a tube to self-administer the pre-exposed beverage in operant chambers under a VR10 schedule in 30-min sessions daily. After approximately 3 weeks of such access, the rats underwent an extinction procedure, so that licking at the tube produced no reward. Once responding had ceased, the rats were subjected to various reinstatement tests.", 
    "81": "In Experiment 1, the cannabinoid receptor agonist Delta(9)-THC (1 mg/kg) significantly reinstated responding, previously reinforced with beer or near-beer. The effect was unlikely to be caused by increased appetite because 24 h food-deprivation had no such effect. Exposure to cat odour in the test chamber failed to reinstate responding for beer or near-beer and caused a complete inhibition of responding. In Experiment 2, Delta(9)-THC (0.3 and 1 but not 3 mg/kg) again reinstated beer-seeking behaviour while the 1 mg/kg dose also reinstated responding in sucrose trained animals. Midazolam (0.15 mg/kg but not 0.5 or 1.5 mg/kg) produced a modest reinstatement of beer-seeking but had no effect on sucrose-seeking behaviour.", 
    "82": "The finding that Delta(9)-THC can reinstate alcohol-seeking provides the impetus for further research into the involvement of the cannabinoid system in alcohol craving. However, the reinstatement of near-beer and sucrose-seeking behaviour caused by Delta(9)-THC suggests a relatively non-specific effect. This may perhaps be related to the stressor-like effects of cannabinoids, and their ability to activate key neural circuitry in the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.", 
    "83": "Xenon anaesthesia appears to have minimal haemodynamic effects. The purpose of this randomised prospective study was to compare the cardiovascular effects of xenon and nitrous oxide in patients with known ischaemic heart disease. In 20 patients who were due to undergo coronary artery bypass graft surgery, 30 min following induction of anaesthesia with fentanyl 30 microg x kg(-1) and midazolam 0.1 mg x kg(-1) but prior to the start of surgery, xenon or nitrous oxide 60% was administered for 15 min. The results showed that xenon caused a minimal decrease in the mean arterial pressure (from 81 (7) to 75 (8) mmHg, mean (SD)), but did not affect the systolic function of the left ventricle, as demonstrated by unchanged left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI) and the fractional area change of the left ventricle (FAC) derived from transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). However, in contrast, nitrous oxide was found to decrease the mean arterial pressure (from 81 (8) to 69 (7) mmHg), the LVSWI, and the FAC. The cardiac index, central venous and pulmonary artery occlusion pressures, systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances, and the TOE-derived E/A ratio through the mitral valve were unchanged by xenon or nitrous oxide. We conclude that xenon provides improved haemodynamic stability compared with nitrous oxide, conserving the left ventricular systolic function.",

    "88": "The discriminative stimulus properties of ethanol are mediated in part by positive modulation of GABA(A) receptors. Recent evidence indicates that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) activity can influence GABA(A) receptor function. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to examine the potential involvement of mGluR5 in the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. In rats trained to discriminate ethanol (1 g/kg, intragastric gavage (i.g.)) from water, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethyl)-pyridine (MPEP) (1-50 mg/kg, i.p.) a selective noncompetitive antagonist of the mGlu5 receptor did not produce ethanol-like stimulus properties. However, pretreatment with MPEP (30 mg/kg) reduced the stimulus properties of ethanol as indicated by significant reductions in ethanol-appropriate responding, specifically at 0.5 and 1 g/kg ethanol, and a failure of ethanol test doses (1 and 2 g/kg) to fully substitute for the ethanol training dose. To test whether mGluR5 antagonism altered the GABA(A) receptor component of the ethanol stimulus, the ability of MPEP to modulate pentobarbital and diazepam substitution for ethanol was assessed. Pentobarbital substitution (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) for ethanol was not altered by MPEP pretreatment. However, MPEP pretreatment inhibited the ethanol-like stimulus properties of diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.). To examine a potential anatomical basis for these pharmacological findings, expression patterns of mGluR5- and benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) alpha1-containing receptors were examined by dual-label fluorescent immunohistochemistry with visualization by confocal microscopy. Results indicated that mGluR5- and GABA(A) alpha1-containing receptors were both coexpressed in limbic brain regions and colocalized on the same cells in specific brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, globus pallidus, and ventral pallidum. Together, these findings suggest an interaction between mGluR5- and benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in mediating ethanol discrimination.", 
    "89": "We used two validated psychopharmacological methods, the forced swimming test (FST 20 min and 5 min) and the elevated plus-maze (EPM), to quantify depression-like and anxiety-like behavior induced by transient global cerebral ischemia in the rat. We also validated use of these methods for the study of antidepressant (imipramine) and anti-anxiety drugs (diazepam). Twelve days after surgery to provoke transient global ischemia, spontaneous motor activity was 40% higher in ischemic rats than in sham-operated controls. Duration of immobility during the FST 20 min and 5 min was 28 and 30% shorter, respectively, than in controls. Treatment with imipramine (3 x 30 mg/kg i.p.) induced a significantly shorter duration of immobility during the FST 5 min, but with no difference between ischemia and control rats. The EPM demonstrated that ischemia did not induce any change in the six behavior parameters measured. Diazepam (1.5 mg/kg i.p.) induced significant anxiolytic effects which were similar in ischemic and sham-operated animals. Both tests failed to demonstrate perturbed performance but conversely, these findings did disclose the sensitivity of ischemia-exposed rats to the action of imipramine and diazepam, demonstrating the usefulness of these tests as psychopharmocological tools for evaluating the effect of psychotropics in the ischemic rat.",

    "105": "In most cases, unmodified oligonucleotides designed as antigene molecules are incapable of binding to DNA with sufficient stability to prevent gene expression. To stabilize binding to a polypurine tract in the HER-2/neu promoter, a triplex forming oligonucleotide (TFO) was conjugated to a pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD), desmethyltomaymycin, and site-specific DNA binding was evaluated. An activated ester of the PBD moiety was conjugated by an acylation reaction to a free primary amine on a 50-atom aliphatic linker at the 5' end of the TFO. This long aliphatic linker was designed to provide a bridge from the major groove binding site of the TFO to the minor groove binding site of the PBD. Triplex formation by the resulting TFO-PBD conjugate occurred more slowly and with a nearly 30-fold lower affinity compared to an unconjugated TFO. PBD binding to the triplex target was demonstrated by protection from restriction enzyme digestion, and covalent binding to the exocyclic amino group of guanine was inferred by substituting specific guanines with inosines. Although the binding of the TFO was less efficient, this report demonstrates that in principle, TFOs can be used to direct the binding of a PBD to specific location. Further optimization of TFO-PBD conjugate design, likely involving optimization of the linker and perhaps placing a PBD at both ends of the TFO, will be needed to make gene modification robust.",

Administration of a potent CYP1A2 inhibitor (eg, fluvoxamine) may alter the pharmacokinetics of olanzapine. This study investigated the pharmacokinetic interactions between olanzapine and fluvoxamine in patients with schizophrenia. Ten male smokers were administrated a single dose of olanzapine 10 mg at baseline, followed by 2 weeks of fluvoxamine 50 mg/day and another 2 weeks of fluvoxamine 100 mg/day. Olanzapine 10 mg was given at day 10 during each fluvoxamine treatment. After pretreatment with fluvoxamine, the area under the curve, maximal plasma concentration, and half-time of olanzapine were significantly increased by 30% to 55%, 12% to 64%, and 25% to 32%, respectively. Volume of distribution and apparent clearance were significantly reduced by 4% to 26% and 26% t O 38%, respectively, after administration of fluvoxamine. Increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to infinity appear to be dose dependent. Presumably, altered olanzapine pharmacokinetics are attributed to the inhibition of CYP1A2. Patients treated with the combination of olanzapine and fluvoxamine should be monitored carefully.",

Predominant symptoms of lindane intoxication concern the central nervous system, e.g. different manifestation of hyperexcitability and epileptiform activity. The inhibition of GABA-ergic neurotransmission seems to be responsible for the convulsant activity of lindane. This study was intended to compare the protective activity of conventional and new antiepileptic drugs against convulsions and lethal effects elicited by lindane administration in mice. Diazepam, clonazepam and phenobarbital protected against full seizure pattern and lethal effects evoked by lindane. Carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, felbamate and lamotrigine inhibited only lindane-induced tonic convulsions and mortality. It may be concluded that apart from benzodiazepines, phenobarbital and, to a lesser extent, carbamazepine, phenytoin, gabapentin, felbamate and lamotrigine could be used in lindane poisoning.

It was stated that imidazenil (i) significantly decreased convulsion intensity in mice, (ii) quickly inhibited seizure patterns in bioelectrical activity in the rat's brain, (iii) significantly increased antilethal effectiveness of the standard therapy in mice intoxicated with DFP.

For instance, methamphetamine was shown to induce substantial nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminal damage, including an increase in glial fibrillary acidic protein, a marker for astrocyte proliferation. Nevertheless, there was almost no attempt to define neurodegeneration by measuring the abundance of reactive microglia. In fact, some investigators fail to differentiate between astrocytes and microglia and claim glial fibrillary acidic protein to be a marker for gliosis. To date, there are numerous methods designed to assess brain neuropathologies resulting from a wide arsenal of insults. Regardless of the cause of neuronal damage, reactive glial cells always appear at and around the site of degeneration. These cells are distinguished by the exceptional abundance of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs; omicron3 sites), particularly as compared to surrounding neurons. Measuring the binding of specific ligands to these PBRs (for example, [3H]PK 11195) offers a unique indirect marker for reliable impairment estimation in the central nervous system. Moreover, the availability of agents such as [11C]PK 11195 paved the road to in vivo animal and human brain positron emission tomography scanning, demonstrating inflammation-like processes in several diseases. Additionally, the measurement of increased binding of PBR ligands provides a faithful indicator for the behavioral and cognitive deficits accompanying neuronal injury.", 
    "127": "Piracetam and structurally related nootropics are known to potentiate the anticonvulsant effects of antiepileptic drugs. It remains to be seen, however, whether these nootropics inhibit proconvulsant actions of many toxic agents including Ro 5-4864, a specific agonist for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR). The present study was designed to address this issue using EL mice, an animal model of epilepsy. In behavioral pharmacological experiments, EL mice were highly susceptible to convulsions induced by Ro 5-4864 (i.p.) in comparison with nonepileptic DDY mice. Nefiracetam administered orally to EL mice inhibited spontaneous seizures. In DDY mice, convulsions induced by Ro 5-4864 were prevented by nefiracetam when administered by i.v. injection. Aniracetam (i.v.) was partially effective, but piracetam and oxiracetam were ineffective as anticonvulsants. Binding assay for brain tissues revealed a higher density of mitochondrial PBR in EL mice compared with DDY mice. Binding of the PBR ligands Ro 5-4864 to either EL or DDY mouse brain was inhibited by micromolar concentrations of these nootropic agents in the sequence of nefiracetam > aniracetam > oxiracetam, piracetam. This rank order is identical to potency as anticonvulsants. These data suggest that nefiracetam may prevent toxic effects of PBR agonists through interacting with PBR.",

    "132": "A 38-year old male patient with no history of psychiatric illness developed a progressive psychotic disorder after bilateral (predominantly left) mesencephalo-thalamic cerebral ischaemia. The reason of the emergency hospitalization was the sudden onset of a confusional state, culminating in a fluctuating comatose status. The neurological examination found mild right hemiparesia, praxic disorders and reactive left mydriasis with paresia of the downward vertical stare, leading to the hospitalisation in the neurology department for suspicion of a cerebral vascular ischaemic accident. The psychiatric symptoms started with acoustic-verbal hallucinations, poorly structured paranoid delusions, progressively developed over two weeks, followed by behavioural disorders with psychomotor agitation and heteroaggressivity. The patient was transferred to the psychiatric department, because of the heteroaggressive risk and lack of morbid consciousness, in spite of recovering from the confusional status. An intensive psychiatric management was proposed, combining a psychotherapeutic approach with 4 mg of risperidone and adjustable doses of benzodiazepine according to the psychomotor agitation. During the next days, there was a net recovery of the behavioural disorders, in spite of the persistence of the ideas of persecution. All the neurological symptoms also decreased. An anomaly of the polygon of Willis was found on a cerebral arteriography (the posterior cerebral arteries had a foetal origin, dependent on carotidal axes and not on the vertebro-basilar system). The main emboligen risk factor was the presence of a permeable foramen ovale, discovered during a transoesophageal echography. The patient underwent a surgical correction of the permeable foramen ovale. The psychiatric hospitalization for three months was continued by ambulatory follow-up. The initial positive symptoms (delusions, acoustic-verbal hallucinations) progressively diminished while negative symptoms became predominant after few months. One year after the first hospitalization the patient presented a second psychotic decompensation, with delusions of persecution, jealousy and behavioural disorders with heteroaggressivity, that required an emergency psychiatric hospitalization. The wife of the patient decided to divorce, because she was \"frightened by the threats of death\" from her husband. A neurological assessment during the second hospitalization in psychiatry did not find new ischaemic lesions after the cardiac surgery for the permeable foramen ovale, nor relevant changes in cerebral perfusion. The final diagnosis after the psychiatric follow-up of 14 months was: psychotic disorder with delusional ideas, due to cerebral ischaemia (DSM IV). There are relatively few data in the literature regarding persistent psychotic disorders in the context of ischaemic mesencephalo-thalamic lesions. However, several authors support the hypothesis of a possible disconnection of the thalamic nuclei, the frontal lobes and limbic system as a risk factor or a triggering factor for psychotic disorders in cerebral ischaemia. Observations concerning the occurrence of psychotic disorders following cerebral--especially localised--ischaemia may help to better understand the neuro-physiological mechanisms triggering or accompanying the psychiatric symptomatology. The role of functional cerebral imagery in the detection of possible structural lesions related to clinical observations must be emphasised. The slow progression (over a year) to psychotic disorder with predominantly negative symptoms emphasized the importance for long-term prospective studies. Isolated clinical observations arouse the interest for a specific scale for psychotic disorders occurring after cerebral ischaemia, similar to existing specific scale for post-ischaemic depressive disorders. The necessity of systematic psychiatric examination and re-evaluations in thalamic cerebral ischaemia is to be highlighted, both for the differential diagnosis and for the early psychiatric care.", 
    "133": "Social phobia (also known as social anxiety disorder) is still not clearly understood. It was not established as an authentic psychiatric entity until the diagnostic nomenclature of the American Psychiatric Association DSM III in 1980. In recent years, increasing attention among researchers has contributed to provide important information about the genetic, familial and temperamental bases of social phobia and its neurochemical, neuroendocrinological and neuroanatomical substrates, which remain to be further investigated. Up to date, there have been several findings about the possible influence of variables, including particularly genetic, socio-familial and early temperamental (eg behavioral inhibition) factors that represent risk for the later development of social phobia. Clinical neurobiological studies, based on the use of exogenous compounds such as lactate, CO2, caffeine, epinephrine, flumazenil or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin to reproduce naturally occurring phobic anxiety, have shown that patients with social phobia appear to exhibit an intermediate sensitivity between patients with panic disorder and control subjects. No difference in the rate of panic attacks in response to lactate, low concentrations of CO2 (5%), epinephrine or flumazenil was observed between patients with social phobia and normal healthy subjects, both being less reactive compared to patients with panic disorder. However, patients with social phobia had similar anxiety reactions to high concentrations of CO2 (35%), caffeine or cholecystokinin/pentagastrin than those seen in patients with panic disorder, both being more intensive than in controls. Several lines of evidence suggest specific neurotransmitter system alterations in social phobia, especially with regard to the serotoninergic, noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems. Although no abnormality in platelet serotonin transporter density has been found, patients with social phobia appear to show an enhanced sensitivity of both post-synaptic 5HT1A and 5HT2 serotonin receptor subtypes, as reflected by increased anxiety and hormonal responses to serotoninergic probes. Platelet 5HT2 receptor density has also been reported to be positively correlated to symptom severity in patients with social phobia. During anticipation of public speaking, heart rate was elevated in patients with social phobia compared to controls. Norepinephrine response to the orthostatic challenge test or to the Valsalva maneuver was also greater in patients with social phobia. While normal beta-adrenergic receptor number was observed in lymphocytes, a blunted response of growth hormone to clonidine, an a2-adrenergic agonist, was reported. This suggests reduced post-synaptic a2-adrenergic receptor functioning related to norepinephrine overactivity in social phobia. Decreased cerebrospinal fluid levels of the dopamine metabolite homovanillic acid have also been observed. There are relatively few reports of involvement of the adrenal and thyroid functions in social phobia, and all that has been noted is that patients with social phobia show an exaggerated adrenocortical response to a psychological stressor. Recent advances in neuro-imaging have contributed to find low striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding or low dopamine transporter site density in patients with social phobia. They have also demonstrated the involvement of the cortico-limbic pathways, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and amygdala, which show an increased activity in different experimental conditions. These brain regions have extensively been reported to play an important role in the cognitive appraisal in determining the significance of environmental stimuli, in the emotional and mnemonic integration of information, and in the expression of contextual fear-conditioned behaviors, which might be disrupted in the light of the phenomelogical aspects of social phobia. A substantial body of literature based on case reports, open and placebo-controlled trials, has now clearly examined the efficacy of major classes of psychotropic agents including monoamine oxidase inhibitors, beta-blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines in social phobia. Until recently, irreversible non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors, of which phenelzine was the most extensively evaluated, were considered as the most efficacious treatment in reducing the symptomatology associated with social phobia in 50-70% of cases after 4 to 6 weeks. However, side effects and dietary restrictions limit their use. This led to the development of reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, for which careful dietary monitoring is not required. Moclobemide has been the most widely studied but produced unconvincingly therapeutic effects on social phobic symptoms. To date, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may be considered as a reasonable first-line pharmacotherapy for social phobia. There is growing evidence for the efficacy of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, citalopram, paroxetine and sertraline. They have beneficial effects with response rates ranging from 50 to 80% in social phobia. It has been recommended that the treatment period should be extended at least 6 months beyond the early improvement achieved within the first 4 to 6 weeks. The overall advantages include tolerability with a low risk of adverse events. The benzodiazepines clonazepam and alprazolam have also been proposed for the treatment of social phobia. Symptomatic relief occurred in 40 to 80% of the cases with a relatively rapid onset of action within the first two weeks. Untoward effects, discontinuation-related withdrawal symptoms and abuse or dependence liability constitute major concerns about the use of benzodiazepines, so they should be reserved for cases unresponsive to the safer medications cited above. Beta-blockers such as atenolol and propanolol have commonly been employed in performance anxiety, decreasing autonomic symptoms (eg, tachycardia, sweating and dry mouth). However, they are not effective in the generalized form of social phobia. Other pharmacologic alternatives seem helpful for the management of social phobia, including venlafaxine, gabapentin, bupropion, nefazodone or augmentation with buspirone. Preliminary studies point to promising effects of these agents. Larger controlled clinical trials are now needed to confirm their potential role in the treatment of social phobia.", 
    "134": "Whether elderly people suffer from age-related changes in pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacodynamics with administration of benzodiazepines is still a matter of controversy. We investigated the course of brain function and thermoregulation after oral administration of a standard benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZP), in 8 healthy young men (mean age, 19.8 years; range, 18 to 23 years) and 8 healthy middle-aged and older men (mean age, 60.9 years; range, 53 to 71 years). Placebo or DZP was administered in a single-blind crossover manner to the young men (placebo, 5-mg, 10-mg DZP) and to the older men (placebo, 5-mg DZP), and plasma DZP concentration, choice reaction time, proximal body temperature, and distal body temperature were monitored with high time resolution under a modified constant routine condition to exclude masking effects. Whereas there was no evidence of age-related alterations in pharmacokinetics between the 2 groups, the older subjects, in comparison to the young subjects, showed a more delayed choice reaction time in response to the same plasma DZP level, suggesting that hypersensitivity is related to increased age. DZP at 5 mg in the older subjects induced acute and transient hypothermia to the same degree as that induced by DZP at 10 mg in the young subjects. The distal-proximal body temperature gradient (difference between distal body temperature and proximal body temperature), an indicator of blood flow in distal skin regions, showed strong positive correlation with the delay in choice reaction time in both groups. These findings suggest that hypersensitivity to benzodiazepine in older persons may be due, at least in part, to age-related changes in thermoregulation, especially in the heat loss process.", 
    "135": "Findings in previous studies investigating the beneficial effect of risperidone and olanzapine versus typical antipsychotics on quality of life (QOL) are controversial since they did not adjust for various factors contributing to QOL. To test this assumption in a naturalistic cross-sectional design, we evaluated general and domain-specific QOL scores for baseline data of schizophrenia outpatients stabilized on atypical (N = 78, risperidone or olanzapine) and typical (N = 55) agents. Self-report and observer-rated QOL outcomes of both risperidone and olanzapine with typical antipsychotic therapy were compared across demographic, illness-related, and treatment-related factors using analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of variance, and correlation analysis. No significant differences were found in QOL outcomes of risperidone-treated and olanzapine-treated patients. Both self-report and rater-observed QOL measures indicated superiority of atypical over typical antipsychotic agents after adjusting for daily doses, duration of treatment, subjective tolerability, and adjuvant antidepressants. Lower daily doses and longer antipsychotic treatment were associated with better QOL. Self-report and observer-rated QOL scores correlated positively (r = 0.64, P < 0.001). Gender, marital status, age, education, living arrangement and employment status, age of onset, illness duration, symptom severity, emotional distress, subtypes of schizophrenia, and side effects did not affect QOL outcomes in either group. Risperidone and olanzapine revealed an advantage over typical agents in terms of QOL. Findings suggest that when calculating the beneficial effects of atypical antipsychotic therapy on QOL outcomes, daily doses, duration of treatment, and subjective tolerability may be intervening variables and should be adjusted accordingly to clearly appreciate benefits of atypical antipsychotics.", 
    "136": "It has been suggested recently that presynaptic kainate receptors (KARs) are involved in short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. Using genetic deletion and pharmacology, we here assess the role of GLU(K5) and GLU(K6) in synaptic plasticity at hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. We found that the kainate-induced facilitation was completely abolished in the GLU(K6)-/- mice, whereas it was unaffected in the GLU(K5)-/-. Consistent with this finding, synaptic facilitation was reduced in the GLU(K6)(-/-) and was normal in the GLU(K5)-/-. In agreement with these results and ruling out any compensatory effects in the genetic deletion models, application of the GLU(K5)-specific antagonist LY382884 [(3S,4aR,6S,8aR)-6-(4-carboxyphenyl)methyl-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid] did not affect short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity at the hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. We therefore conclude that the facilitatory effects of kainate on mossy fiber synaptic transmission are mediated by GLU(K6)-containing KARs.", 
    "137": "Critically ill patients with alcoholism are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from alcohol withdrawal syndrome than are patients without alcoholism. Benzodiazepines are considered the drugs of choice for the prevention and treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, but some studies have suggested that intravenous ethanol may be as effective as those agents, as well as being less sedating. We evaluated the evidence regarding the use of intravenous ethanol for the prevention and treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome in critically ill patients in order to determine its role in this patient population. Because of the paucity of well-designed clinical trials, and because of intravenous ethanol's questionable efficacy, inconsistent pharmacokinetic profile, and relatively narrow therapeutic index, routine use of this drug is not recommended in critically ill patients who have alcohol withdrawal syndrome or are at risk for it.", 
    "138": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved in the US and Europe for the oral treatment of acute manic episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder, and for maintenance therapy to prevent recurrence in responders. Oral olanzapine is effective in the treatment of bipolar mania, both as single agent therapy and as adjunctive therapy in combination with lithium or valproate semisodium. In the treatment of acute episodes, olanzapine is superior to placebo and at least as effective as lithium, valproate semisodium, haloperidol and risperidone in reducing the symptoms of mania and inducing remission. Additional comparative studies are required to determine the efficacy of olanzapine relative to newer atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole. Olanzapine is also effective at delaying or preventing relapse during long-term maintenance therapy in treatment responders, and is currently the only atypical antipsychotic approved for this indication. Current evidence suggests that olanzapine may be more effective than lithium in preventing relapse into mania, but not relapse into depression or relapse overall. Olanzapine is generally well tolerated, and although it is associated with a higher incidence of weight gain than most atypical agents, it has a low incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Therefore, oral olanzapine is a useful first-line or adjunctive agent for both the acute treatment of manic episodes and the long-term prevention of relapse into manic, depressive or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder.",

Panic attack means a period of intensive fear or discomfort, accompanied by a range of physical or psychological symptoms. Subsequently, anticipatory anxiety and avoidance behavior often develop. Panic disorder may or may not be accompanied by agoraphobia. Panic disorder can be treated both by psychotherapeutic and pharmacological measures. An ideal approach is combination therapy in the sense of a multimodal concept; with regard to cognitive behavioral therapy in particular, its effectiveness in the treatment of panic disorder is well documented. For pharmacotherapy, antidepressive agents, in particular selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are the drugs of first choice. Benzodiazepines should be given for only a few weeks until the antipanic effect of the antidepressants kicks in. With appropriate treatment, the prognosis is favorable.",

Compounds were separated on a Xterra RP18 column using a mobile phase of acetonitrile/formic acid 0.1% at a flow rate of 0.25 mL/min under a linear gradient. Column effluents were analyzed using MS with an ES source in the positive ionization mode. Calibration curves were linear in the concentration ranges of 1-250 and 0.2-25 ng/mL in plasma and saliva, respectively.

Among men, AUC increased (r=0.43, P <.02) and clearance declined (r=-0.42, P <.02) with increasing age. Gender differences in triazolam kinetics were not apparent. Compared with placebo, triazolam impaired digit-symbol substitution test performance, increased observer-rated sedation, impaired delayed recall of information learned at 1.5 hours after dosing, and increased electroencephalographic beta amplitude. Among men, mean values of relative digit-symbol substitution test decrement (P <.002) and observer-rated sedation (P <.05) were significantly greater in elderly subjects compared with young subjects. Age-dependent differences among women reached significance for observer-rated sedation (P <.02). A combination of higher plasma levels and increased intrinsic sensitivity explained the greater pharmacodynamic effects of triazolam in elderly subjects. Although the findings are consistent with reduced clearance of triazolam in elderly men, individual variability was large and was not explained by identifiable demographic or environmental factors.",

The N-CLB concentration/CLB dose ratio of patients with two mutated alleles was more than six fold higher than that of wild type patients. Thus, the serum N-CLB/CLB concentration ratio may be a valuable parameter to screen for patients at risk for side effects. Such precautions may be clinically relevant in populations where the mutant allele frequency is high, such as in Asian populations ( approximately 35%). Patients co-medicated with CYP3A4 inducer showed lower CLB concentration/CLB dose ratios and higher N-CLB/CLB concentration ratios. The overall effect of CYP3A4 inducer on N-CLB metabolism, however, was small and, thus, we conclude that the CYP2C19 genotype is the major determinant of the N-CLB concentration. For this reason it is crucial for the better management of epilepsy and other chronic illnesses in general to establish the correlation of genotype of CYP enzymes and pharmacokinetics/dynamics of drugs.", 
    "162": "Foreign body aspiration remains an important pathology in children. Management of airway foreign bodies must be undertaken in specialized units with experienced staff and known protocols. Development and improvement of rigid bronchoscopes, with advances in anaesthesia have increased the efficacy and the safety of removing endotracheal foreign bodies. A video monitor is advantageous in coordinating the procedure and reducing the stress of the team. Utilization of Fogarty's catheters can be beneficial.", 
    "163": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is an uncommon potentially fatal side effect of neuroleptic drugs, characterized by movement disorder, altered mental status and autonomic instability. A single dose of clotiapine was administered to an 11-year old male with acute psychosis. The previously healthy child had signs consistent with NMS including hyperthermia, hypertension, motor and mental changes. Repeat examination performed two weeks later, demonstrated that while his hyperthermia subsided, his mental status deteriorated. Olanzapine was administered, after which the child had hyperthermia, dystonia and more pronounced restlessness, once again consistent with NMS. He developed respiratory failure and was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Lorazepam, dantrolene and bromocriptine were administered as treatment of possible NMS. His mental condition, movement disorder and autonomic dysfunction improved significantly. Two weeks later, the patient was discharged in good general condition without the need for any ongoing medical treatment. There are only few case reports of NMS in children treated with olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic. In children, caution must be exercised when prescribing antipsychotics, particularly atypical antipsychotics as these drugs may cause NMS. Because of the low incidence of NMS, a high index of suspicion is needed to identify cases so prompt treatment can be undertaken.", 
    "164": "We report the case of a patient with increased cerebral cortical excitability following intoxication with flupirtine, a centrally acting analgesic and antispastic drug. Typically, flupirtine exerts membrane stabilizing and hyperpolarizing effects through activation of neuronal G-protein regulated inwardly rectifying potassium channels (GIRK). Based on these properties, GIRK activators have been suggested as candidates for antiepileptic drug development. In contrast, our observation suggests that these substances may also display unexpected proconvulsant effects in vivo.", 
    "165": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Ekbom's syndrome, is a fairly common complaint which is not widely recognised by medical professionals, although it seems to affect 1-10% of the population. Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.", 
    "166": "Problem alcohol and other drug use is rarely suspected in the elderly. However, the elderly are more susceptible to problems related to drug use at lower doses because of age related changes, comorbidities and polypharmacy. Like other age groups, the elderly sometime seek the use of alcohol and other drugs, to help them feel better or to avoid negative feelings such as loneliness and depression. Drug use in the elderly is associated with significant morbidity anid can be masked by other medical problems.", 
    "167": "This article demonstrates a gradual onset alcohol problem in a longstanding elderly patient, in whom changes in drug or alcohol use may not be easily detected. It also highlights some key differences in drug related presentations in the elderly.", 
    "168": "Some health professionals consider intervention for problem alcohol or other drug use in the elderly ineffective. However, because of the high prevalence of polypharmacy and comorbid pathology, intervention is more likely to result in a significant health improvement. General practitioners have a high level of contact with and are trusted by the elderly, giving them an unparalleled opportunity among health professionals to intervene in problem alcohol and other drug use.", 
    "169": "A simple method using a one-step liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with positive ion electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometric (ESI-MS/MS) detection was developed for the determination of bromazepam in human plasma, using lorazepam as internal standard. The acquisition was performed in the multiple reaction monitoring mode, monitoring the transitions: m/z 316 > 182 for bromazepam and m/z 321 > 275 for lorazepam. The method was linear over the studied range (1-100 ng ml(-1)), with r(2) > 0.98, and the run time was 2.5 min. The intra- and inter-assay precisions were 2.7-14.6 and 4.1-17.3%, respectively and the intra- and inter-assay accuracies were 87-111 and 75.8-109.5%, respectively. The mean recovery was 73.7%, ranging from 64.5 to 79.7%. The limit of quantification was 1 ng ml(-1). At this concentration the mean intra- and inter-assay precisions were 14.6 and 7.1%, respectively, and the mean intra- and inter-assay accuracies were 102.5 and 104%, respectively. Bromazepam stability was evaluated and the results showed that the drug is stable in standard solution and in plasma samples under typical storage and processing conditions. The method was applied to a bioequivalence study in which 27 healthy adult volunteers (14 men) received single oral doses (6 mg) of reference and test bromazepam formulations, in an open, two-period, randomized, crossover protocol. The 90% confidence interval of the individual ratios (test formulation/reference formulation) for C(max) (peak plasma concentration), AUC(0-96) and AUC(0-inf) (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to 96 h and to infinity, respectively) were within the range 80-125%, which supports the conclusion that the test formulation is bioequivalent to the reference formulation regarding the rate and extent of bromazepam absorption.", 
    "170": "Rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline are major tetracyclic oxindole alkaloid components of Uncaira species, which have been long used as medicinal plants. In this study we examined the protective effects of rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline on in vitro ischemia-induced neuronal damage in the hippocampus and interaction of these alkaloids with neurotransmitter receptors in a receptor expression model of Xenopus oocytes. In vitro ischemia was induced by exposing the hippocampal slices to oxygen- and D-glucose-deprived medium over 8 min. The resultant neuronal damage was elucidated as deterioration of population spike (PS) amplitudes evoked trans-synaptically by electrical stimulation of Schaffer collaterals and recorded in the CA1 area. Rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline, as well as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (+/-)-2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid (APV), the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine, and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin, attenuated the in vitro ischemia-induced neuronal damage in a concentration-dependent manner. There was no difference in the extent of protection against the neuronal damage between rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline treatment. In Xenopus oocytes expressing the rat brain receptors encoded by total RNA, both rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline reduced muscarinic receptor- and 5-HT2 receptor-mediated current responses in a competitive manner. Together with our previous findings that rhynchophylline and isorhynchophylline have a non-competitive antagonistic effect on the NMDA-type ionotropic glutamate receptors, the present results suggest that these alkaloids exert their protective action against ischemia-induced neuronal damage by preventing NMDA, muscarinic M1, and 5-HT2 receptors-mediated neurotoxicity during ischemia.", 
    "171": "The aim of this study was to better understand the mechanisms that underlie adaptive changes in GABAA receptors following their prolonged exposure to drugs. Exposure (48 h) of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2S GABAA receptors to flumazenil (1 or 5 microM) in the presence of GABA (1 microM) enhanced the maximum number (Bmax) of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites without affecting their affinity (Kd). The flumazenil-induced enhancement in Bmax was not counteracted by diazepam (1 microM). GABA (1 nM-1 mM) enhanced [3H]flunitrazepam binding to membranes obtained from control and flumazenil-pretreated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. No significant differences were observed in either the potency (EC50) or efficacy (Emax) of GABA to potentiate [3H]flunitrazepam binding. However, in flumazenil pretreated cells the basal [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]TBOB binding were markedly enhanced. GABA produced almost complete inhibition of [3H]TBOB binding to membranes obtained from control and flumazenil treated cells. The potencies of GABA to inhibit this binding, as shown by a lack of significant changes in the IC50 values, were not different between vehicle and drug treated cells. The results suggest that chronic exposure of HEK 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2S GABAA receptors to flumazenil (in the presence of GABA) up-regulates benzodiazepine and convulsant binding sites, but it does not affect the allosteric interactions between these sites and the GABA binding site. Further studies are needed to elucidate these phenomena.", 
    "172": "Discontinuation of benzodiazepine (BZD) treatment for insomnia can be a difficult task. Cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT) for insomnia, combined with a supervised medication taper, can facilitate withdrawal but there is limited evidence on long-term outcome after discontinuation. The objective of this study was to examine medication-free survival time and predictors of relapse (i.e., resumed BZD hypnotics) over a 2-year period in 47 older adults (mean age 62.1 years) with persistent insomnia and prolonged BZD use (average duration of 18.9 years), who had successfully discontinued BZD following CBT for insomnia, a supervised medication taper program, or a combined approach. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to estimate survival time, defined as time between end-of-treatment and relapse or end of follow-up. By the end of the 24-month follow-up, 42.6% of the samples had resumed BZD use. Participants in the Combined (33.3%) and Taper (30.8%) groups relapsed significantly less than their counterparts from the CBT group (69.2%). Survival rates at 3 months were 61.5% (CBT), 100% (Taper), and 80.9% (Combined). At 12 months, they were 38.5%, 83.3%, and 70.8%, respectively; and, at 24 months, they were 28.9%, 64.8% and 64.9%, respectively. Mean survival time was significantly longer for both the Taper (18.6 months, SE = 2.1) and Combined groups (12.6 months, SE = 1.4), relative to the CBT group (8.5 months, SE = 1.8). Significant predictors of relapse included treatment condition, end of treatment insomnia severity, and psychological distress. In conclusion, there is a substantial relapse rate following BZD discontinuation among prolonged users. CBT booster sessions might enhance compliance with CBT and prove useful in preventing relapse.", 
    "173": "Typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs have been shown to have different clinical and behavioral profiles. Haloperidol (HAL) is a typical neuroleptic that acts primarily as a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. It has been proposed that reactive oxygen species play a causative role in neurotoxic effects induced by HAL. We evaluated oxidative damage in rat brain induced by chronic HAL, clozapine (CLO) or olanzapine (OLZ) administration. Adult male Wistar rats received daily injections of Hal (1.5mg/kg), CLO (25mg/kg) or OLZ (2.5, 5.0 or 10.0mg/kg). Control animals were given saline (SAL; NaCl 0.9%). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonylation were measured in the hippocampus (HP), striatum (ST) and cortex (CX). TBARS was increased in the striatum after HAL treatment. In contrast, there was a decrease of TBARS levels induced by HAL, CLO and OLZ treatments in the cortex. Protein carbonyls after HAL and CLO treatment was increased in the hippocampus, compared to control. In hippocampus, OLZ did not show significant difference to control in both oxidative parameters. Our findings demonstrated that atypical antipsychotic CLO produced less oxidative damage than HAL and we did not find oxidative damage induced by OLZ.", 
    "174": "A Catalyst pharmacophore model has been developed for the benzodiazepine site within the GABA(A) receptor complex. The model is based on a pharmacophore model originally proposed by Cook and co-workers (Drug Des. Discovery 1995, 12, 193-248) and further developed by Kahnberg et al. (J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45, 4188-4201). The Catalyst pharmacophore model has been validated by using a series of flavonoids with varying affinities for the benzodiazepine receptor and has then been used as a search query in database searching with the aim of finding novel structures which have the possibility to be modified into novel lead compounds. Five of the hits from the database searching were purchased and their affinities for the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor were determined. Two of the compounds displayed K(i) values below 10 microM. The substance showing highest potency in-vitro displayed an affinity of 121 nM making it an interesting compound for optimization. The false positive compounds (K(i) values >10 microM affinities) have been analysed in terms of conformational energy penalties and possibilities for hydrogen bond interactions. The analysis clearly demonstrates the need for post processing of Catalyst hits.", 
    "175": "The preparation of pyrimidine-2-thione, pyrimidine-2-one, pyrimidine, and benzo[b][1,4]diazepine derivatives using traceless solid-phase sulfone linker strategy is described. Key steps involved are (i) sulfinate S-alkylation, (ii) sulfone anion alkylation with an epoxide, (iii) gamma-hydroxyl sulfone --> gamma-ketosulfone oxidation, and (iv) traceless product release by a one-pot elimination-cyclization process. Elimination-cyclization was carried out under basic conditions with thiourea, methyl thiourea, methyl urea, guanidine hydrochloride, benzamidine hydrochloride and ortho-phenylene diamine. Twenty-three compounds were prepared, and 14 of them were evaluated by the Batrachotoxin (BTX) radioligand binding assay for their binding affinity to neuronal sodium channels. Compound 7c was found to be a potential neuronal sodium channels blocker.", 
    "176": "Cycloid psychoses, described by Leonhard, have a sudden onset, unstable polymorphic delusion symptomatology, labile state of consciousness, lack of physical symptoms, quick remission with no residual mental abnormalities and normality between episodes. Leonhard distinguished three clinical forms: anxiety-happiness psychosis, excited-inhibited confusion psychosis and hyperkinetic-akinetic motility psychosis. The essential characteristics of this clinical subtypes are: polymorphism, global disturbance of psychic life, acute appearance of symptoms, total insomnia 3 days before onset of symptomatology, intra and interepisode lability, polar structure, tendency to repetition of episodes (phases) and a good long-term prognosis. We present a patient's clinical history and evolution that illustrate the characteristics of this kind of endogenous psychoses."
