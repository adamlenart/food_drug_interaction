    "1": "The patient database of the Duke Movement Disorders Clinic was searched to identify and characterize all cases of dystonia evaluated during the 3 1/2 year period between July 1995 and December 1998.", 
    "2": "Of the 68 patients identified, 44% had focal dystonia, 10% segmental dystonia, 9% hemidystonia, 7% generalized dystonia, 4% multifocal dystonia, 12% psychogenic dystonia, and 9% tardive dystonia. The remainder had either paroxysmal or pseudodystonia. Twenty-five patients had improvement with botulinum toxin injections, 16 with anticholinergics, benzodiazepines and/or baclofen, and 2 with tetrabenazine.",

    "4": "Diazemuls is a very powerful anxiolytic agent with sedating and anti-epileptogenic properties. Unfortunately, until now it has not been possible to give Diazemuls accurately and safely as an infusion. A new delivery system ensures that, as an infusion, this drug is potentially very effective in treating patients with terminal agitation, status epilepticus, drug and alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "5": "Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome with an inability to execute and terminate movements completely, leading consecutively to akinesia and posturing, which both respond almost immediately to benzodiazepines, i.e. gaba-potentiators like lorazepam. However, pathophysiological mechanisms of cortical motor and gaba-ergic dysfunction remain unclear. We therefore investigated movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs) and movement kinematics during a motor task before and after lorazepam. Ten akinetic catatonic patients were compared with 10 psychiatric (similar age, sex, medication, and underlying psychiatric disease but without catatonic syndrome) and 20 healthy controls. MRPs from frontal (F), central (C), and parietal (P) sites were recorded to obtain measures of early and late readiness potential and movement potential. Kinematic measures included parameters for amplitude of movements, peak velocity, average duration of movements, elevation angle, and angle velocity. The motor task consisted in self-initiated extension of the right index finger. All catatonic and psychiatric control patients received intravenous lorazepam (1mg), whereas healthy controls were subjected to a placebo-controlled (10 received lorazepam, 10 received placebo) double-blind study design.Catatonics showed a significantly delayed onset of late readiness and movement potential in central electrodes (Cz, C3) compared with psychiatric and healthy controls. This delayed onset correlated significantly with catatonic motor symptoms and movement duration. Lorazepam led to significantly stronger delays in onset of late readiness potential in left fronto-parietal (F3, C3, P3) electrodes in catatonic patients than in psychiatric and healthy controls. It is concluded that delayed latencies in late MRP components in catatonic patients may reflect their inability to execute and terminate movements completely. Differential and stronger response to lorazepam in catatonia suggests dysfunction in inhibitory control of cortical motor function with increased gaba-ergic sensitivity.", 
    "6": "This work reports the distribution of the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor complex alpha5 subunit in the chick using an antibody raised against this subunit in the rat, an immunoprecipitation study and a comparative autoradiographic study using [(3)H]flunitrazepam in the presence of 1 microM zolpidem, which is considered to bind only to those areas presenting the alpha5 subunit. The specificity of the antibody for the chick GABA(A) receptor complex alpha5 subunit is supported by the similar bands obtained by Western blotting from rat and chick, the immunoprecipitation study and the general agreement in the distribution and pattern of labelling of this antibody in both species. The immunocytochemical and autoradiographic distributions in both the chick and rat are compared and some areas with disagreement between these distributions are discussed. The general conclusion is that the alpha5 subunit of the GABA(A) complex receptor seems to have been conserved along evolution.", 
    "7": "Liver injury induced by benzodiazepines is rare and is classified as an unpredictable or idiosyncratic hepatotoxic reaction. Early reports indicated that in most cases the pattern of liver injury was cholestatic. We describe three patients with persistent increases in liver transaminase levels after several weeks of treatment with bentazepam, a benzodiazepine marketed in Spain for anxiety disorders. In all cases withdrawal of the drug was followed by resolution of transaminase level abnormalities. A liver biopsy (done in one patient only) showed histological evidence of severe chronic active hepatitis. In conclusion, these findings, together with two previously published case reports, suggest that a benzodiazepine can cause chronic hepatitis and argue in favor of using liver function tests to monitor all patients taking bentazepam.", 
    "8": "Packed column capillary electrochromatography (CEC), open-tubular CEC and microcolum liquid chromatography (LC) using a cholesteryl silica bonded phase have been studied to compare the retention behavior for benzodiazepines. It has been found that packed column CEC gives better resolution, faster analysis time than microcolumn LC for benzodiazepines maintaining similar selectivity except for some solutes which are charged species under the separation conditions. However, open-tubular CEC gave different selectivities to a larger extent for charged benzodiazepines from that which should be produced by the chromatographic properties of the cholesteryl silica phase. Charged species migration times are mainly influenced by electrophoretic mobility rather than the chromatographic interactions.", 
    "9": "Insomnia is a frequent complaint in the elderly population. Hypnotic agents, including benzodiazepines, with longer pharmacological half-lives have been associated with side effects, including residual sedation, memory impairment, and discontinuation effects. Zaleplon is a short-acting (elimination half-life of 1 hour), non-benzodiazepine hypnotic that acts on the benzodiazepine type 1 site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor complex. The pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of Zaleplon suggest a safety profile that is improved over other hypnotics. The objective of this placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zaleplon (5 and 10 mg) in elderly (> or =65 years) outpatients with primary insomnia. This was a multicenter, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled 2-week outpatient study. Postsleep questionnaires were used to record subjective sleep variables: sleep latency, sleep duration, number of awakenings, and sleep quality. Zaleplon significantly reduced subjective sleep latency during both weeks of the study with both 5- and 10-mg doses. Subjective sleep quality was improved for significantly more patients treated with zaleplon 10 mg than those treated with placebo during both weeks of treatment. There was a weak indication of rebound insomnia after discontinuation of treatment with the 10-mg dose, but no significant difference in common treatment-emergent adverse events across treatment groups. Zaleplon is an effective and safe hypnotic for the treatment of insomnia in the elderly.", 
    "10": "This study investigated the relationship between spatial working memory and hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) using the allocentric place discrimination task (APDT) in rats, in which the selection accuracy is a good index for spatial working memory. Either the selective M1 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine (50 microg) or the choline uptake inhibitor hemicholinium-3 (5 microg) impaired APDT selection accuracy, but neither affected the induction of LTP in the hippocampal CA1 region in anesthetized rats. In contrast, the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist D-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (200 nmol) did not impair APDT selection accuracy but completely blocked hippocampal CA1 LTP. These results suggest that spatial working memory is independent of hippocampal CA1 LTP and that the central cholinergic system is involved in spatial working memory, but not through the modulation of hippocampal CAI LTP.", 
    "11": "This study examines the effect of new 1,5 benzodiazepines on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and ATPDase (apyrase) activities from cerebral cortex of adult rats. Simultaneously, the effects of the classical 1,4-benzodiazepine on these enzymes were also studied for comparative purpose. The compounds 2-trichloromethyl-4-phenyl-3H-1,5-benzodiazepin and 2-trichloromethyl-4(p-methyl-phenyl)-3H- 1,5-benzodiazepin significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase activity (p < 0.01) when tested in the range of 0.18-0.35 mM. The inhibition caused by these two new benzodiazepines was noncompetitive in nature. Similarly, at concentrations ranging from 0.063 to 0.25 mM, the 1,5 benzodiazepines inhibited ATP and ADP hydrolysis by synaptosomes from cerebral cortex (p < 0.01). However, the inhibition of nucleotide hydrolysis was uncompetitive in nature. Our results suggest that, although diazepam and the new benzodiazepines have chemical differences, they both presented an inhibitory effect on acetylcholinesterase and ATPDase activities.", 
    "12": "The resting membrane potential (RMP) of denervated muscle fibres of rat diaphragm muscle is depolarized by approximately 8-10 mV during the first 3 h after nerve section and this early postdenervation depolarization is reduced substantially by the presence of 5x10(-8) M acetylcholine (ACh) or carbachol (CB). The muscarinic antagonist atropine (Atr; 5x10(-9) to 5x10(-6) M) reduced the effect of CB in a dose-dependent manner (K(i)=7x10(-8) M) and increased the rate of the early postdenervation depolarization. In lower doses (5x10(-7) M), Atr acted only in the presence of an allosteric stabilizator hexamethylene-bis-[dimethyl-(3-phtalimidopropyl)ammonium] (W-84). Also pirenzepine, a specific inhibitor of the M1 subtype of muscarinic receptor, blocked the action of CB in a dose-dependent manner with an apparent inhibition constant K(i)=1x10(-7) microM. DAMP, a specific M3 antagonist, was without effect on the muscle hyperpolarization induced by CB. CB also hyperpolarized the membrane potentials of muscles which were denervated for 1-3 days. It is concluded that ACh and CB protect the muscle fibres from early depolarization through M1-cholinergic receptors on the muscle membrane. These particular receptors can apparently mediate the 'trophic', non-impulse regulation of RMP in skeletal muscles when they are activated by acetylcholine released non-quantally.", 
    "13": "We have investigated the role of extramitochondrial Na(+) for the regulation of mitochondrial Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](m)) in permeabilized single vascular endothelial cells. [Ca(2+)](m) was measured by loading the cells with the membrane-permeant Ca(2+) indicator fluo-3/AM and subsequent removal of cytoplasmic fluo-3 by surface membrane permeabilization with digitonin. An elevation of extramitochondrial Ca(2+) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the rate of Ca(2+) accumulation into mitochondria (k(0.5) = 3 microm) via the mitochondrial Ca(2+) uniporter. In the presence of 10 mm extramitochondrial Na(+) ([Na(+)](em)), repetitive application of brief pulses of high Ca(2+) (2-10 microm) to simulate cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] oscillations caused transient increases of [Ca(2+)](m) characterized by a fast rising phase that was followed by a slow decay. Removal of extramitochondrial Na(+) or inhibition of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange with clonazepam blocked mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux and resulted in a net accumulation of Ca(2+) by the mitochondria. Half-maximal activation of mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange occurred at [Na(+)](em) = 4.4 mm, which is well within the physiological range of cytoplasmic [Na(+)]. This study provides evidence that Ca(2+) efflux from the mitochondria in vascular endothelial cells occurs solely via Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange and emphasizes the important role of intracellular Na(+) for mitochondrial Ca(2+) regulation.", 
    "14": "Here, we will discuss the concept of subjective akathisia and present a patient case. Our patient was suffering from neuroleptic-induced hypokinesia and akathisia at the same time. The typical motor manifestations of akathisia were masked by hypokinesia, which made the diagnosis difficult. However, the subjective symptoms of akathisia were evident and distressing. Although not observable to bare eye, the pathognomonic pattern of motor activity detected in akathisia was demonstrated by actometric recording. Changing the conventional neuroleptic to an atypical one brought relief to the subjective symptoms of akathisia and hypokinesia, while the motor activity was clearly diminished in actometric recording. Actometric recording may be useful in diagnosing akathisia masked by hypokinesia, but the typical subjective symptoms of akathisia should not be ignored, even when actometry is not available to demonstrate the missing motor component of akathisia. Not only akathisia defined by DSM-IV but also subjective akathisia should be adequately treated to relieve the subjective distress, and to diminish the unfavorable effects on psychotic symptoms, behavior, and drug compliance.", 
    "15": "The abuse risk of new non-benzodiazepine hypnotics such as zolpidem has been discussed in a number of recent publications. We performed a Medline analysis which showed that, to date, 15 cases of abuse or dependence have been published. In 6 patients, the abuse was secondary to other forms of abuse or dependence. Other data from medical statistics and pharmacoepidemiological studies suggest the abuse potential of zolpidem to be much lower than that of other hypnotics. We conclude that zolpidem is a relatively safe drug compared to conventional hypnotics. Patients with other substance abuse histories may be considered as risk patients for later abuse of zolpidem.", 
    "16": "The findings of this study support the hypothesis that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate the initiation of long-term potentiation (LTP) and behavioral changes induced by the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG-7142. Unlike previous work, this study examined the effects of FG-7142 on LTP of amygdala efferents in both hemispheres. 7-amino-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7), a competitive NMDA receptor blocker, given prior to administration of FG-7142, prevented LTP in amygdala efferent transmission to the medial hypothalamus and periacqueductal gray (PAG). When given FG-7142 alone, cats showed lasting behavioral changes accompanied by LTP in all pathways studied. Duration of LTP, and its relationship to behavioral change, depended on the pathway and the hemisphere of the pathway. Correlation and covariance analyses indicate that LTP in the left amygdalo-ventromedial hypothalamic pathway mediates initiation, but not maintenance, of increased defensiveness. This finding replicates previous work. A new finding is that increased local excitability in the right basal amygdala (reduced threshold for evoked response), and LTP in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway, may be important for maintenance of increases in defensive behavior. Furthermore, the effects of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, on behavior and physiology single out the importance of right amygdalo-PAG LTP as a critical mediator of increased defensiveness. Flumazenil reversed the increase in defensiveness produced by FG-7142 in a drug-dependent manner as described in Adamec (1998a). Moreover, flumazenil reversed LTP only in the right amygdalo-PAG pathway. The findings of the present study suggest that response to FG-7142 may be a useful model of the effects of traumatic stressors on limbic system function in anxiety, especially in view of the recent data in humans implicating right hemispheric function in persisting negative affective states.", 
    "17": "1. The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic system, which is functionally altered in obese (fa/fa) Zucker rats, plays an important role in controlling energy balance within the central nervous system. 2. GABA receptors seem to be involved in the dysfunction of the hypothalamic energy homeostasis-controlling mechanisms in these animals due to a genetically-induced defect of the leptin-neuropeptide Y system. 3. To shed further light on the possible role played by the GABA system in the pathogenesis of this rat model, two benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor agonists (diazepam and clonazepam) and one BDZ antagonist (flumazenil) were administered intraperitoneally in obese and lean Zucker rats. 4. Body weight gain was reduced by the BDZ agonists in both phenotypes, and one receptor-agonist (diazepam) lowered insulin concentration in obese rats. In GABA-antagonist-treated obese rats, the daily amount of body weight gain and food intake acquired an oscillatory rhythm similar to that of normal rodents. 5. By demonstrating the role of BDZ receptors, these findings may help clarify the pathophysiology of obesity and insulin resistance in fatty Zucker rats.",

Additionally, alprazolam was orally administered for 2 weeks by mixing the compound into a commercially available liquid, fat emulsion-based diet. The use of silastic implants to deliver several different benzodiazepines was also evaluated in vitro.", 
    "30": "Following 7 days of alprazolam administration at 2 mg/kg per day via osmotic minipump, plasma concentrations in ten identically treated rats ranged from <1 ng/ml to 97 ng/ml. Slow-release pellets produced more consistent plasma concentrations, but were only minimally effective at raising plasma concentrations. In vitro studies utilizing silastic implants containing 90 mg drug in 6 cm of tubing revealed stable release of only 45-55 microg/day alprazolam versus 625-650 microg/day diazepam. In contrast to these methodologies, incorporation of alprazolam into a commercially available liquid diet (approximately 25-150 mg/kg per day) provided consistent, dose-dependent increases in plasma concentrations of alprazolam and its metabolites in a range appropriate for mimicking clinical exposure.", 
    "31": "These findings indicate that the most effective technique to produce plasma concentrations of alprazolam that are reproducible, clinically pertinent, and consistent between rats is to incorporate the drug into a liquid diet.

Pre-testing injections of diazepam did not alter the magnitude of this CPP. When diazepam was given with morphine during training, rats displayed a CPP for the environment paired with the two drugs. Injections of amphetamine in one environment also induced a preference for this environment. However, pre-testing injections of diazepam blocked the expression of amphetamine-induced CPP, and co-injections of diazepam blocked the formation of amphetamine CPP. Diazepam itself did not produce a CPP nor did it alter spontaneous place preferences. Diazepam equally blocked both morphine and amphetamine unconditioned and conditioned locomotor hyperactivity. This indicates that its effects on morphine and amphetamine CPP were not due to a differential effect on locomotion.",

The purpose of the study was to investigate whether rectal premedication with paracetamol and codeine would reduce the need of rescue analgesics, reduce the postoperative pain experience and result in faster eligibility for discharge. Ninety pregnant patients scheduled for day-case surgery with evacuation of the uterine cavity were randomly assigned into two groups. The paracetamol and codeine group was given a suppository with 60 mg of codeine and 800 mg of paracetamol together with standard premedication of intramuscular midazolam 0.08 mg/kg. The placebo group was given a placebo suppository and midazolam. All patients underwent the surgical procedure under general anaesthesia with alfentanil 15 microg/kg and propofol 1.5-2 mg/kg. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in the postoperative pain experience as judged by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS-scale), verbal scale or the need for rescue analgesic medication with ketobemidone. Most of the patients experienced little postoperative pain with more than 70% scoring less than 20 mm on a VAS-scale from 0-100 mm at any time during the postoperative period. The paracetamol and codeine patients were significantly more sleepy at 30 min postoperatively. There were no differences between the groups in postoperative nausea or vomiting and no difference in discharge eligibility. The use of pre-operative suppository with paracetamol 800 mg and codeine 60 mg is unnecessary in this group of patients.",

We have therefore investigated a possible role for vagal CCK-A and 5-HT(3) receptors in the febrile response after intraperitoneal human recombinant interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Unanesthetized, adult male rats instrumented with abdominal thermistors were given intraperitoneal CCK-8 sulfate (100 or 150 microgram/kg) or 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine maleate (4 mg/kg). In other experiments, rats were treated with either antagonists to the 5-HT(3) receptor (ondansetron HCl; 100 microgram/kg) or the CCK-A receptor (L-364,718, 100 or 200 microgram/kg) in combination with LPS or IL-1beta. CCK administration caused a short-lived hypothermia, but interference with the action of endogenous CCK at CCK-A receptors was without effect on IL-1beta- or LPS-induced fever. Neither activation of 5-HT(3) receptors nor blockade of 5-HT(3) receptors affected body temperature or LPS fever. Taken together, our data support the idea that vagal afferents responsive to pyrogenic cytokines may be different from those responsive to CCK or 5-HT.",

The anticonvulsant activity of these compounds against audiogenic seizures was evaluated in DBA/2 mice after intraperitoneal (ip) injection. Most of these derivatives are more active than 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (1, GYKI 52466), a well-known noncompetitive AMPA receptor antagonist. As deduced by the rotarod test, all the compounds exhibit a toxicity lower than that of 1. Within the series of derivatives submitted to investigation, 4-(4-aminophenyl)-2-butylcarbamoyl-6,7-methylenedioxyphthalazin -1(2H)-one (21) proved to be the most active compound and is 11-fold more potent than 1 (i.e., ED50 3.25 micromol/kg for 21 versus ED50 35.8 micromol/kg for 1). When compared to 1, compound 21 as well as its analogue 4-(4-aminophenyl)-6,7-methylenedioxyphthalazin-1(2H)-one (16) show a longer lasting anticonvulsant activity. Compound 21 also effectively suppresses seizures induced in Swiss mice by maximal electroshock (MES) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ).

We evaluated the role of arachidonic acid and some related unsaturated and saturated fatty acids in the modulation of a stably expressed recombinant gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor (GABAR) isoform, the alpha1beta2gamma2 isoform. Whole-cell currents evoked by 10 microM GABA were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by arachidonic acid (0.1-100 microM). This effect of arachidonic acid to inhibit GABAR currents was not reproduced by the non-metabolizable analog of arachidonic acid, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA) or by other monounsaturated or saturated fatty acids. However, another polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid, which is an essential fatty acid and an effective reductant like arachidonic acid, inhibited GABAR currents in a manner similar to arachidonic acid. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), indomethacin and 1-amonibenzotriazole (1-ABT) did not block the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid, suggesting that arachidonic acid metabolites of the lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase or P-450 pathways are unlikely to play a major role in the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid on GABAR currents. However, the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), a scavenger of active oxygen radicals, reduced the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid on GABAR currents significantly (P<0.01), suggesting that active oxygen radicals might mediate inhibition of GABAR currents by arachidonic acid.",

The conductance increased from 12 +/- 4 to 62 +/- 9 pS as the pentobarbital concentration was raised from 10 to 500 microM and the data could be fitted by a Hill-type equation. At 100 microM pentobarbital plus 0.5 microM GABA, the conductance seemed to reach a plateau. The pentobarbital EC(50)(0.5 microM GABA) value was 22 +/- 4 microM and n was 1.9 +/- 0.5. In 1 mM pentobarbital plus 0.5 microM GABA, the single-channel conductance decreased to 34 +/- 8 pS. This apparent inhibition of channel conductance was relieved by 1 microM diazepam. The channel conductance was 64 +/- 6 pS in the presence of all three drugs. The channels were open more in the presence of both GABA and pentobarbital than in the presence of either drug alone. Pentobarbital alone (100 microM) activated channels with conductance (30 +/- 2 pS) and kinetic properties distinct from those activated by either GABA alone or GABA plus pentobarbital. Whether pentobarbital induces new conformations or promotes conformations observed in the presence of GABA alone cannot be determined from our study, but the results clearly show that it is the combination of drugs present that determines the single-channel conductance and the kinetic properties of the receptors.", 
    "83": "Assuming complete hepatic substrate metabolism and system linearity, quantitative effects of in vivo competitive inhibition are investigated. Following oral administration of a substrate in the presence of a competitive inhibitor, determination of the inhibition constant (Ki) is possible when plasma concentration-time profiles of both substrate and inhibitor are available. When triazolam is the P450 3A4 substrate and ketoconazole the competitive inhibitor, Ki approximately 1.2 microg/mL in humans. The effects of competitive inhibition can be divided into two components: first-pass hepatic metabolism and systemic metabolism. For drugs with high hepatic extraction ratios, the impact of competitive inhibition on hepatic first-pass metabolism can be particularly dramatic. For example, human terfenadine hepatic extraction goes from 95% in the absence of a competitive inhibitor to 35% in the presence of one (ketoconazole, 200 mg po Q 12 h dosed to steady-state). First-pass extraction therefore goes from 5% in the absence of the inhibitor to 65% in its presence. The combined effect on first-pass and systemic metabolism produces an approximate 37 fold increase in terfenadine area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Assuming intact drug is active and/or toxic, development of metabolized drugs with extensive first-pass metabolism should be avoided if possible, since inhibition of metabolism may lead to profound increases in exposure.",

    "88": "The inhibitory GABA(A) receptor is a key element in determining the pattern of nerve cell electrical activity. Thus, modulation of its function is of paramount impact in shaping neuronal functional activity under physiological and pathological conditions. This applies to cerebellar granule neurons as to all the other neurons in the brain. The culture of cerebellar granules from newborn rats is a convenient means by which to approach these cells for electrophysiological studies provided that they maintain, as far as GABA(A) receptors are concerned, the same characteristics as in situ. Thus, the regulation of GABA(A) receptor activity in these neurons has been studied by the patch-clamp technique, both in the whole-cell and outside-out configuration. An obvious first level of control of such receptors' activity is their desensitization under continued agonist application, with biphasic kinetics. The data do not allow one to conclude whether one is dealing with two different populations of receptors or with a single population with two desensitization phases; although the presence of two GABA(A) receptor populations is suggested by a host of observations. The granule cell GABA(A) receptors are modulated by changes in extracellular pH with lower pH resulting in an enhanced receptor activity. They display, under the conditions of whole-cell recording, a run-down phenomenon which is most probably due to a tyrosine phosphatase activity which is in turn under control by a protein serine kinase. Thus, in situ tyrosine phosphorylation is a key element in determining the efficiency of GABA mediated inhibition. Activation of protein kinase A or protein kinase G (PKG) down-regulates GABA(A) receptors' activity. This last event is involved in the depression of those receptors' activity by L-arginine via the production of nitric oxide. In addition, the activity of calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclase I is controlled by GABA(B) receptors. Dendritic GABA(A) receptor activity is partially blocked by previous activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors via calcineurin mediated dephosphorylation/activation of protein tyrosine phosphatase and concomitant production of nitric oxide and PKG activation. The site phosphorylated by PKG is evidently not available for calcineurin-mediated serine dephosphorylation, due to calcineurin-specific membrane localization in respect of the GABA(A) receptor. Overall, a complex network of biochemical signals appear to keep granule cells GABA(A) receptors under a fine balance between up- and down-regulatory mechanisms. The overall data appear also to indicate the presence of two GABA(A) receptor populations: a dendritic one which can be modulated by Ca++ entering via NMDA receptors and a cell body one. The two populations are probably different in terms of desensitization kinetics and benzodiazepine sensitivity.",

In particular, we compared the effects of a continuous LN stimulation at low-frequency (tonic stimulation) with those induced by high frequency pulse trains (phasic stimulation). The observed results show that the stimulation of LN induces c-Fos expression in a significant fraction of neurons in the contralateral BPN and RtTg. It was also observed that phasic stimulation was slightly more capable in producing c-Fos expression with respect to the tonic stimulation. Furthermore, systemic injection of MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor, reduced the LN-induced c-Fos expression in BPN and RtTg. In contrast, GYKI 52466, an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, did not change the LN driven induction of c-Fos in both BPN and RtTg.",

GERD has also been shown to be associated with cerebral palsy, an IQ < 35, scoliosis, and the use of anticonvulsant drugs or benzodiazepines. To establish the diagnosis, 24-h pH measurement or endoscopy should be used in all those intellectually disabled individuals in whom GERD clinically is suspected. The efficacy of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) in IDI with GERD is indisputable. In IDI, adults as well as children, PPIs are highly effective, independent of the severity of esophagitis.

Hypotension, hypoxaemia, cyanosis and pulmonary oedema were observed from the start of surgery, but the symptoms improved towards the completion of the procedure.

Atipamizole reversed the affects of medetomidine hydrochloride, resulting in a smooth and full recovery within 8 minutes. The immobilisation and subsequent anaesthesia of these animals on cold winter nights resulted in hypothermia, and keeping the animals warm was essential to the success of the procedures undertaken.

A total of 98 patients (mean age 34 years, range 17-75 years) were studied before and after herniorrhaphy to determine their response to the procedure. All patients were unpremedicated and underwent herniorrhaphy using a Bassini repair technique with a standard local anaesthetic block. Sedation was obtained with titrated intravenous midazolam(Hypnovel, Roche Products Ltd.) without narcotic analgesia. Patients were evaluated with a simple questionnaire after surgery. The maximum dose of midazolam used was 5 mg (median dose 3.5 mg). Monitoring of vital signs with pulse oximetry during the operative period was routine though oxygen therapy was not required. All patients were able to walk without assistance and were discharged under responsible supervision. Operative morbidity was low (5%). Adverse reactions to the procedure such as nausea, vomiting and headache were not seen. In conclusion, conscious sedation allows amnesia to be achieved with low morbidity in the majority of patients undergoing local anaesthetic procedures. This should result in increased patient acceptance.", 
    "99": "The gamma2 subunit is an important functional determinant of GABAA receptors and is essential for formation of high-affinity benzodiazepine binding sites and for synaptic clustering of major GABAA receptor subtypes along with gephyrin. There are two splice variants of the gamma2 subunit, gamma2 short (gamma2S) and gamma2 long (gamma2L), the latter carrying in the cytoplasmic domain an additional eight amino acids with a putative phosphorylation site. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing either the gamma2S or gamma2L subunit on a gamma2 subunit-deficient background are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type. They express nearly normal levels of gamma2 subunit protein and [3H]flumazenil binding sites. Likewise, the distribution, number and size of GABAA receptor clusters colocalized with gephyrin are similar to wild-type in both juvenile and adult mice. Our results indicate that the two gamma2 subunit splice variants can substitute for each other and fulfil the basic functions of GABAA receptors, allowing in vivo studies that address isoform-specific roles in phosphorylation-dependent regulatory mechanisms.",

Transgenic mice and littermate controls were analysed with respect to altered behaviour indicative of anxiety, motor activity and acute effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol, as well as with regard to altered responses to alcohol withdrawal and acute functional tolerance to alcohol. Biochemical tests assessed flunitrazepam- and ethanol-enhanced 36Cl- flux stimulated by muscimol in cerebellar and cortical microsacs and [3H]-flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar membranes. There were no significant differences in any of these measures between the transgenic and control mice, except in tests of acute functional tolerance to acute injection of ethanol. Compared to controls, mice carrying either the gamma2L or gamma2S transgene developed significantly less tolerance to the ataxic effects of ethanol. We conclude that acute functional tolerance to ethanol is very sensitive to the amount of GABAA receptor gamma2 subunit available (regardless of whether it is gamma2L or gamma2S) but overexpression of neither subunit isoform alters other behavioural and biochemical phenotypes.",

    "103": "Experiment I: The effect of melatonin (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 mg), ingested at 23:30, was studied on nocturnal sleep (23:30-07:30) and core body temperature in 8 healthy volunteers. Performance was measured 8.5 h post-ingestion. On completion of the experiment dim light melatonin onsets (DLMO) were determined. Experiment II: The effect of melatonin (0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10 mg), ingested at 18:00, was studied on evening sleep (18:00-24:00) and core body temperature in 6 healthy volunteers. Performance was measured 6.5 h post-ingestion. Each experiment was placebo-controlled and double-blind with a cross-over design with temazepam (20 mg) as an active control.", 
    "104": "Experiment I: Melatonin (5 mg) reduced the duration of stage 3 in the first 100 min of sleep. Melatonin (0.1 mg) reduced body temperature 6.5 to 7 h post-ingestion. Temazepam increased stage 2, reduced wakefulness and stage 1, and increased the latency to REM sleep. Temazepam reduced body temperature 4.5 to 6.5 h post-ingestion. There were no changes in performance compared with placebo. DLMO occurred between 20:40 and 23:15. Experiment II: Melatonin (all doses) increased total sleep time (TST), sleep efficiency index (SEI) and stage 2, and reduced wakefulness. Temazepam increased TST, SEI, stage 2 and slow-wave sleep, and reduced wakefulness. There were no changes in body temperature or performance compared with placebo.",

Effective treatment may be obtained with dopaminergic or opioid drugs, while anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, and possibly baclofen may be helpful. This report describes a patient who developed RLS and PLMD after acute transverse myelitis associated with infectious mononucleosis, and failed to respond to intrathecal baclofen. All symptoms of RLS/PLMD resolved after treatment with pergolide.", 
    "107": "Thirty patients on long-term benzodiazepine medication were subjected to full ophthalmoscopic examination. Of these 19 (63.3%) complained of symptoms of irritation, blurred vision or difficulty in reading. None, however, had reduced visual acuities apart from two where the cause was longstanding amblyopia. Thirteen patients had some form of retinal finding, 9 macular and 4 non-macular. Of the 14 who presented for flash and pattern electroretinography (ERG), none showed any abnormality which could be ascribed to the medication, its total dose, or duration. We conclude, on the basis of the evidence from this small cohort, that long-term benzodiazepine medication has little effect upon retinal function as signalled by the ERG.", 
    "108": "Tuberculosis is an example of an infection with an intracellular bacterium in which sensitivity is determined mainly by the host response. Macrophages are the architectural and functional units of the granulomas described in tuberculosis. Treatment with amphetamine (AMPH) and diazepam has been reported to decrease macrophage activity. The present experiment was undertaken to investigate the effects of AMPH and/or diazepam given alone or in combination on hamster resistance to Mycobacterium bovis. The effects of these treatments on serum cortisol levels were also studied. Adult hamsters were treated i.p. with AMPH (group E1 = 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg/day), with AMPH (group E2 = 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg/day) plus diazepam (2.0 mg/kg/day), with diazepam (group E3 = 2.0 mg/kg/day), or with control vehicles (1.0 ml/kg/day) for 40 days. Six days after the beginning of the treatments, the animals received identical inoculum concentrations of M. bovis. Hamsters treated with AMPH plus diazepam exhibited: 1) increased weight loss; 2) increased mortality; 3) increased scores of M. bovis colony forming units (CFU) isolated from liver, lung and spleen; 4) increased granuloma areas measured in the liver, lung and spleen. These effects were not induced by AMPH (1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg/day) given alone and were produced by diazepam (2.0 mg/kg/day) treatment per se. Furthermore, AMPH (2.0 mg/kg/day) and diazepam (2.0 mg/kg/day) given alone or in combination for 20 days increased the serum levels of cortisol in relation to control hamsters, with the effect being higher in the animals treated with both drugs. The present data, which demonstrate an impaired defense against M. bovis in hamsters treated with AMPH plus diazepam or with diazepam alone, were tentatively explained on the basis of a direct and/or indirect action of the drugs on macrophage/lymphocyte activity. In the former case, the effects may be related to stimulation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor sites (PBR) present on macrophages/lymphocytes and/or to a direct effect of ACTH on immune cells, while in the latter they may be mediated by cortisol via PBR and ACTH stimulation of the adrenals.", 
    "109": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of acute and repeated (daily and weekly) intravenous (IV) administration of PK 11 195 (PK; 10 mg kg(-1)) on body weight (BW) in Sprague-Dawley male and female rats exposed for 4-8 weeks to diazepam (DZ) slowly released from Silastic capsules (120 and 90 mg/capsule/week for males and females, respectively). Rats implanted with empty capsules served as controls. Both acute and repeated (daily and weekly) administration of PK inhibited BW gain to a greater extent in male than in female rats that received identical treatment. There was no difference in PK effect between DZ-treated and control rats. Furthermore, regardless of treatment or gender, PK-induced inhibition of BW gain lessened during repeated administration of PK. The present data indicate that PK-induced inhibition of BW gain is related to gender rather than to chronic DZ treatment.",

The total drug cost was 1,120,000 Italian lire ($US707) per patient (1995 values). Less than 20% of this cost was borne by the Italian National Health Service, as the majority of drugs used were not reimbursed.",

    "119": "Perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy, the exacerbation of seizures in association with menstruation, may in part be due to withdrawal of the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), an endogenous anticonvulsant neurosteroid that is a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors. Neurosteroid replacement is a potential approach to therapy, but natural neurosteroids have poor bioavailability and may be converted to metabolites with undesired progestational activity. The synthetic neuroactive steroid ganaxolone (3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnane-20-one) is an orally active analog of allopregnanolone that is not converted to the hormonally active 3-keto form. To assess the potential of ganaxolone in the treatment of catamenial seizure exacerbations, a state of persistently high serum progesterone (pseudopregnancy) was induced in 26-day-old female rats with gonadotropins, and neurosteroids were withdrawn on postnatal day 39 with finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor that blocks the conversion of progesterone to allopregnanolone. Finasteride treatment during pseudopregnancy results in a reduction in the threshold for pentylenetetrazol seizures. During this state of enhanced seizure susceptibility, there was a 3-fold increase in the anticonvulsant potency of ganaxolone (control ED(50) = 3.5 mg/kg; withdrawn = 1.2 mg/kg) without a change in the potency for induction of motor toxicity in the rotarod test. The plasma concentrations of ganaxolone did not differ significantly in control and withdrawn animals; the estimated plasma concentrations of ganaxolone producing 50% seizure protection were approximately 500 and approximately 225 ng/ml in control and withdrawn rats, respectively. Unlike ganaxolone, neurosteroid withdrawal was associated with a decrease in the anticonvulsant potency of diazepam (control ED(50) = 1.9 mg/kg; withdrawn = 4.1 mg/kg) and valproate (control ED(50) = 279 mg/kg; withdrawn = 460 mg/kg). The enhanced anticonvulsant potency of ganaxolone after neurosteroid withdrawal supports the use of ganaxolone as a specific treatment for perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy.", 
    "120": "The extent to which individual subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors are functionally independent has not been elucidated in vivo. This study used apparent pA(2) analysis to test the hypothesis that a single receptor subtype mediates the discriminative stimulus effects of midazolam, triazolam, and diazepam, three positive gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) modulators. Four rhesus monkeys discriminated 0.56 mg/kg midazolam from vehicle under a fixed-ratio 5 schedule of stimulus-shock termination. Midazolam, triazolam, and diazepam increased responding on the midazolam-appropriate lever. The neutral GABA(A) modulator flumazenil shifted dose-effect curves for triazolam and diazepam to the right, and the negative GABA(A) modulators Ro 15-4513 and ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) shifted dose-effect curves for midazolam and triazolam to the right. Slopes of Schild plots for flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 conformed to unity. The apparent pA(2) values were 7.41 and 7.69 for flumazenil in combination with triazolam and diazepam, respectively, and 7.53 and 6.88 for Ro 15-4513 in combination with midazolam and triazolam, respectively. The slope of the Schild plot for beta-CCE in combination with midazolam deviated from unity. Slopes of Schild plots obtained with flumazenil and Ro 15-4513 support the notion that a single benzodiazepine receptor subtype mediates the effects of midazolam, triazolam, or diazepam. The similarity in apparent pA(2) values for flumazenil in combination with triazolam and diazepam or for Ro 15-4513 in combination with midazolam and triazolam suggests that the same subtype mediates the effects of these positive modulators. In contrast, beta-CCE and midazolam do not appear to interact in a simple, competitive manner.",

The subjects were subsequently genotyped with respect to the CYP3A4*B1 polymorphism (A-290G) in the 5'-promoter (nifedipine-specific element) region.", 
    "123": "The oral bioavailability of midazolam was about equally determined by intestinal and hepatic extraction with CYP3A activity at the former site exhibiting greater variability. Oral bioavailability was related to intestinal metabolism (r = 0.98), whereas hepatic CYP3A activity contributed little to the interindividual variability (r = 0.03). A lower systemic clearance (265+/-54 versus 310+/-56 mL/min; P = .04), but not oral clearance, was observed in African Americans. With one exception, the African Americans possessed a variant CYP3A4*1B allele (4 heterozygotes A/G and 10 homozygote G/G), whereas all of the European Americans were wild-type homozygotes (A/A). Hepatic CYP3A activity and the systemic clearance of midazolam were about 30% lower in G/G homozygotes than in A/A homozygotes (252+/-53 versus 310+/-54 mL/min; P = .02), and a gene-dose effect was present (P = .01). There was no genotype/phenotype relationship with respect to the oral clearance of midazolam.", 
    "124": "Comparison of CYP3A activity between populations is complicated by frequency distribution differences in the regulatory CYP3A4*1B polymorphism and lower hepatic CYP3A activity associated with the variant allele. However, this reduction is modest; therefore no major and clinically important difference in CYP3A activity is present between Americans of African or European descent.", 
    "125": "Alternatives to psychostimulants are now a routine part of the pharmacologic treatment of ADHD. Bupropion and most tricyclic antidepressants are sound options for managing core behavioral symptoms and, to some extent, cognitive symptoms. Alpha 2 adrenergic agonists can moderately reduce hyperactivity and impulsivity. Certain effective agents, such as desipramine, carbamazepine, neuroleptics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are clinically inadvisable in most cases. Lithium, benzodiazepines, antihistaminic sedatives, and buspirone are potentially detrimental. Venlafaxine and beta-adrenergic blockers seem potentially promising. Significant new options include norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, such as reboxetine and tomoxetine, and possibly selective dopamine agonists. Central anticholinesterases, such as donepezil, may improve core ADHD symptoms and perhaps some associated features that psychostimulants do not--particularly organizational capacity and possibly other executive functions. The potential for bupropion to treat amotivational features should be investigated.", 
    "126": "We have previously shown that diazepam blocks both the formation and the expression of amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), but has no effect on the CPP induced by morphine. Because diazepam reduces dopamine activity in the nucleus accumbens, three experiments were conducted in order to investigate whether diazepam selectively blocks the expression of place conditioning dependent on mesolimbic dopamine. The first experiment found that systemic diazepam blocked the expression of conditioned place aversion induced by the kappa-receptor agonist U50-488. The second and third experiments demonstrated that intra-cranial injections of diazepam in the nucleus accumbens blocked the expression of amphetamine CPP but not of morphine CPP. It is concluded that diazepam interferes with mesolimbic dopamine-dependent motivational effects of drugs.",

    "130": "The purified esterase isozyme exhibited an apparent subunit molecular weight of 59 kDa as estimated by SDS gelelectrophoresis, a native molecular weight of 170 kDa determined by a calibrated gel filtration column suggesting that the active enzyme is a trimer. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was approximately 5.4. The specific activities of the purified enzyme were 5.8 nmol/(min*mg protein) protein for the formation of flumazenil acid and 31 nmol/(min*mg protein) for the synthesis of the flumazenil methylester. The purified enzyme obeys simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with K(M) values of 665 microM for flumazenil acid, 1011 mM for methanol and 900 microM for the flumazenil methylester. PMSF, a specific inhibitor for serine proteases and mammalian acetylcholinesterase, completely inhibited the formation of flumazenil -acid and the flumazenil methylester at a concentration of 100 microM. No synthesis of the flumazenil -methylester could be observed by incubation of the purified esterase with flumazenil acid in the presence of methanol leading to the conclusion that the enzymatically catalyzed reaction is a transesterification. The purified esterase was digested with endoproteinase LysC. A 15 amino acid long peptide was isolated and showed identical matches to carboxylesterase cDNAs from human liver and lung.",

The combination of olanzapine and fluoxetine produced robust, sustained increases of extracellular levels of dopamine ([DA](ex)) and norepinephrine ([NE](ex)) up to 361 +/- 28% and 272 +/- 16% of the baseline, respectively, which were significantly greater than either drug alone. This combination produced a slightly smaller increase of serotonin ([5-HT](ex)) than fluoxetine alone. The combination of clozapine or risperidone with fluoxetine produced less robust and persistent increases of [DA](ex) and [NE](ex). The combination of haloperidol or MDL 100907 with fluoxetine did not increase the monoamines more than fluoxetine alone. Olanzapine plus sertraline combination increased only [DA](ex). Therefore, the large, sustained increase of [DA](ex), [NE](ex), and [5-HT](ex) in PFC after olanzapine-fluoxetine treatment was unique and may contribute to the profound antidepressive effect of the olanzapine and fluoxetine therapy in TRD.",

We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamics of lotrafiban, an oral platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor, as a secondary prevention strategy in patients with cerebrovascular or cardiovascular disease.", 
    "134": "Overall, 451 patients with a recent cardiovascular or cerebrovascular acute ischemic event were randomized in a double-blind fashion to 1 of 5 dosing regimens for 12 weeks: placebo or 5, 20, 50, or 100 mg lotrafiban, both twice daily with 300 to 325 mg/d aspirin. The primary end point was the incidence and tolerability of major and minor bleeding during treatment. Secondary end points included inhibition of platelet aggregation and clinical events. The placebo and lotrafiban 5-mg groups had similarly low rates of minor and major bleeding, but the 100-mg arm was terminated early because of excess major bleeding. Protocol-defined thrombocytopenia (<100 000 platelets/microL) occurred in 5 lotrafiban-treated patients (1.4%, 95% CI 0.2% to 2.7%) and 1 placebo patient (1.1%, 95% CI 0% to 3.1%). Three lotrafiban-treated patients had a nadir platelet count <20 000/microL (0.9%, 95% CI 0% to 1.8%). Lotrafiban produced dose-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation; 5 mg lotrafiban did not differ significantly from placebo, whereas 100 mg inhibited aggregation by nearly 100%.",

    "136": "One of the most prominent cholinergic deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the reduced number of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the hippocampus and cortex of AD patients, as compared to age-matched controls. This deficit results in reduced nicotinic cholinergic excitation which may not only impair postsynaptic depolarization but also presynaptic neurotransmitter release and Ca2+-dependent intracellular signaling, including transcriptional activity. Presently, the most common approach to correct the nicotinic cholinergic deficit in AD is the application of cholinesterase inhibitors. Due to the resulting increase in synaptic acetylcholine levels, both in concentration and time, additional nAChR molecules, e.g. those more distant from the ACh release sites, could be activated. As an obvious disadvantage, this approach affects cholinergic neurotransmission as a whole, including muscarinic neurotransmission. As a novel and alternative approach, a treatment strategy which exclusively targets nicotinic receptors is suggested. The strategy is based on a group of modulating ligands of nicotinic receptors, named allosterically potentiating ligands (APL), which increase the probability of channel opening induced by ACh and nicotinic agonists, and in addition decrease receptor desensitization. The action of APL on nicotinic receptors is reminiscent of that of benzodiazepines on GABA(A) receptors and of that of glycine on the NMDA-subtype of glutamate receptor. Representative nicotinic APL are the plant alkaloids physostigmine, galanthamine and codeine, and the neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT). The potentiating effect of APL on nicotinic neurotransmission has been shown by whole-cell patch-clamp studies in natural murine and human neurons, and in murine and human cell lines expressing various subtypes of neuronal nAChR.",

Mean (+/- SD) intramuscular dosage rate of 5.05 (+/- 0.76) mg/kg produced an induction time of 3.7 +/- 1.8 min. Duration of cataleptic anesthesia was 67.4 +/- 19.8 min and ocelots stood 50.0 +/- 30.7 min after emergence from cataleptic anesthesia. Ocelots recovered to their preinjection condition 129.7 +/- 28.8 min after first standing and 250.8 +/- 55.1 min after initial injection.

    "138": "Clinical aspects of the \"night eating syndrome\" (NES) are described. Recent studies, also referred to in the present report, have revealed certain triggering factors of this syndrome, but do not reveal the nature of the relationship between awakening and compulsory need for food. According to the psychodynamic interpretation, these subjects eat at night to replace dreaming, to which they offer strong resistance, whilst according to the psychobiological interpretation, motivational stimuli develop the irresistible and repeated desire for food. Within a post-rational cognitive theoretical model, the compulsion to food would be the mode through which subjects obtain a modified conscious state necessary to appease the suffering due to an experience of emptiness and incapacity. Psychological support associated with pharmacological treatment (benzodiazepine, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) has been shown, in a personal series, to be effective both upon the sleep disorder and craving.", 
    "139": "Recent biochemical observations have suggested the abnormalities in the gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic system in schizophrenic brains. In the present study, we investigated the subunits gene expressions and ligand binding of the GABA(A) receptor following acute and chronic administration of phencyclidine (PCP), which induces schizophrenia-like symptoms, in rats using in situ hybridization and in vitro quantitative autoradiography. PCP i.p. administration at a daily dose of 7.5 mg/kg resulted in a significant decrease in expression of alpha 1 subunit mRNA in cerebral cortices (cingulate (-13%) and temporal cortex (-6%)) and hippocampal formation (CA1 (-11%), CA2 (-10%), CA3 (-11%) and dentate gyrus (-12%)) 1 h after a single treatment. In the repeated PCP administrations for 14 days, the expression of beta 2 mRNA in the cerebellum (-10%) and of beta 3 mRNA in the cerebral cortices (cingulate (-12%), parietal (-16%) and temporal cortex (-16%), caudate putamen (-18%), inferior colliculus (-18%), and cerebellum (-15%) were significantly decreased. In addition, [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding was also reduced in layer IV of the frontoparietal cortex (-14%), inferior colliculus (-17%), and cerebellum (-12%) following chronic PCP treatment, while no changes were observed following acute PCP treatment. These results indicate that single and repeated administrations of PCP independently regulate the expression of GABA(A)/benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor subunits mRNA and its receptor binding in the brain.", 
    "140": "The structural basis for the selectivity of the antagonist UH-AH 37 at human muscarinic acetylcholine receptors was investigated by expressing mutant receptors in COS-7 cells. Previous studies have demonstrated that the interaction between UH-AH 37 and [(3)H]N-methylscopolamine in equilibrium assays is competitive and that the high affinity of UH-AH 37 for the M(5) subtype, compared to M(2), is due to an epitope in the sixth transmembrane domain (TM6) or the third outer loop of the receptor. By mutating each nonconserved residue in this region of M(2) and M(5) to its counterpart in the other receptor, we identified a threonine residue in the middle of TM6 uniquely responsible for the higher affinity of the M(5) receptor (M(1), M(3), and M(4) receptors also carry a threonine at that location and also have high affinity for UH-AH 37). The mutant receptor in which the corresponding alanine of the M(2) receptor was replaced by threonine, M(2)(401)ala --> thr, expressed enhanced affinity for pirenzepine as well as for UH-AH 37. The chick M(2) receptor, which expresses anomalously high affinity for pirenzepine, differs from its mammalian counterparts by the presence of a threonine at this position. Affinities of AF-DX 116 and 4-DAMP, as well as the allosteric potency of UH-AH 37, were not sensitive to the M(2)(401) ala --> thr mutation.", 
    "141": "Gabapentin has been shown to reduce paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus of the urethane-anesthetized rat and has been shown to block calcium channels, but its not known how these possible mechanisms relate to its antiepileptic effect. Here, we tested two structural analogs of gabapentin for the ability to reduce seizure duration and to alter paired-pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus in urethane anesthetized adult Sprague-Dawley rats. We compared with our results to those with diazepam, an anxiolytic and GABA(A) positive modulator and with nimodipine, a specific blocker of L-type Ca2+ channels. Both structural analogs of gabapentin caused a dose-dependent loss of paired-pulse inhibition and blocked the lengthening of the duration of the seizure discharge. Nimodipine also blocked the increase in duration of the seizure discharge, but increased paired-pulse inhibition. The effects of the GABA derivatives on paired-pulse inhibition and on seizure duration may have a common mechanism. Furthermore, our results indicate that gabapentin's postulated block of L-type calcium channels is not responsible for reducing paired-pulse inhibition. However, calcium channel block could still be the basis for the antiepileptic effect of gabapentin and its analogs.", 
    "142": "On an evening in November, a 25-year-old man was found dead in his bedroom. There were many empty snap-out sheets for flunitrazepam tablets in the trash at his bedside. He had been beaten by a gang of young people earlier in the morning of the same day. At the medico-legal autopsy, although there were many bruises and/or abrasions on the whole body, only slight subdural hemorrhage was observed, and none of them was thought to be the cause of death. Flunitrazepam and its metabolites were not detected in his body fluid by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Marked lung edema and a severe congestion of organs were observed. His blood alcohol concentration from the femoral vein was 2.00 mg/ml. Fatal cases of acute alcohol intoxication usually have shown higher alcohol concentration (2.25-6.23 mg/ml). Although the genotype of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) has not previously been mentioned as a contributing factor in determining the cause of death, in this case the genotype of ALDH2 was ALDH2*1/2 and thus is important. Those who possess the ALDH2*2 gene show high concentrations of acetaldehyde (AcH) at even comparatively lower alcohol levels. Consequently, the cause of death was considered to be acute alcohol intoxication including AcH poisoning.", 
    "143": "Gas chromatography (GC) and immunoassay techniques applied to blood and urine specimens were compared for the screening of benzodiazepines in postmortem forensic toxicology. Five hundred and six such successive postmortem cases in which both urine and peripheral blood was sent for toxicological analysis by the medical examiners were selected. The urine specimens were tested by the Emit((R)) d.a.u. Benzodiazepine Assay, and in parallel, the blood and urine specimens were screened for benzodiazepine drugs and their metabolites by an established automated dual-column GC method. The lowest number of positives (153) was obtained when immunoassay was performed without enzyme hydrolysis. When urine samples were hydrolysed before immunoassay, the number of positives increased to 175. The highest number of positives (200) was obtained in urine by GC, and the screening of blood by GC yielded 185 quantitative results. Despite the urine GC screening produced the most positives, the quantitative screening of the blood by GC appears to be the most efficient approach in postmortem forensic toxicology, considering the fact that although urine findings confirm the presence of the drug, quantitative results in urine are irrelevant to acute toxicity.", 
    "144": "To investigate the prevalence of analgesics containing dextropropoxyphene (DXP) or codeine in individuals suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, we analysed all blood samples in which drugs were screened for in cases of suspected drunken driving in Sweden during the years 1992-1997. DXP was found in 130 (2.7%) and codeine in 388 (7.9%) of the 4896 drug-screened cases. The ratio between the number of DXP and of codeine cases and prescription of defined daily dose/1000 inhabitants during a 12-month period (DDD) was determined. The quotient for DXP was trebled from 1992 (0.99) to 1997 (2.89), while the codeine quotient decreased by 9% (from 6 to 5.5). The blood samples showed polydrug use in all but 28 cases of the 486 cases where DXP and/or codeine was found. In 71% of the 486 cases benzodiazepines were also present and in 38% of the cases amphetamine and/or cannabis were present. It was concluded that analgesics containing DXP or codeine are not drugs of primary interest in this specific population. Nevertheless, because of the high toxicity of DXP, especially when combined with alcohol or other drugs, the increase in the DXP prevalence gives reason for concern, since the studied population represents a group of individuals who use large doses of therapeutic or illegal drugs.", 
    "145": "The coronial files of all heroin-related fatalities that occurred in New South Wales (NSW) over the period 1992-1996 were inspected. There were 953 heroin-related fatalities in NSW over the study period. There was a substantial, statistically significant increase in heroin-related fatalities over the study period, from 152 deaths in 1992 to 226 during 1996. The mean age of cases was 31.0 years, 85% were male, and 85% were classified as dependent on heroin at the time of death. There was a significant increase in the age of cases over the study period and the proportion of cases that were employed. Fatalities predominantly occurred in home settings (61%). No intervention occurred in 79% of cases. Fifty deaths (5%) occurred in the month following release from prison, 16 of which occurred the first 24 hours after release. Morphine concentrations rose from 0.24 mg/l in 1992 to 0.38 mg/l in 1996. Seventy six percent of cases involved heroin in combination with other drugs: alcohol (46%), benzodiazepines (27%), antidepressants (7%) and cocaine (7%). In only 24% of cases was morphine the sole drug detected. Males were significantly more likely to have alcohol detected at autopsy (49 vs. 24%), while females were more likely to have benzodiazepines detected (41 vs. 17%). The median blood morphine concentration among cases in which alcohol was detected was significantly lower than other cases (0.27 vs. 0.39 mg/l). It is concluded that heroin-related deaths continued to rise throughout the study period, and that deaths were predominantly among older, untreated males. Despite the rise in blood morphine concentrations, polydrug use remained the predominant toxicological pattern.", 
    "146": "A large series of beta-carbolines was examined for their ability to bind at [3H]agonist-labeled 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptors. Selected beta-carbolines were also examined at 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptors, 5-HT(1A) serotonin receptors, dopamine D(2) receptors, and benzodiazepine receptors. Indolealkylamines and phenylisopropylamines were also evaluated in some of these binding assays. The beta-carbolines were found to bind with modest affinity at 5-HT(2A) receptors, and affinity was highly dependent upon the presence of ring substituents and ring saturation. The beta-carbolines displayed little to no affinity for 5-HT(1A) serotonin receptors, dopamine D(2) receptors and, with the exception of beta-CCM, for benzodiazepine receptors. Examples of beta-carbolines, indolealkylamines (i.e. N,N-dimethyltryptamine analogs), and phenylisopropylamines have been previously shown to produce common stimulus effects in animals trained to discriminate the phenylisopropylamine hallucinogen DOM (i.e. 1-(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane) from vehicle. Although the only common receptor population that might account for this action is 5-HT(2A), on the basis of a lack of enhanced affinity for agonist-labeled 5-HT(2A) receptors, as well as on their lack of agonist action in the PI hydrolysis assay, it is difficult to conclude that the beta-carbolines behave in a manner consistent with that of other classical hallucinogens.", 
    "147": "Cell-cell interactions are crucial role for the proper functioning of endocrine glands. We recently demonstrated that interactions of chromaffin and cortical cells are important for adrenocortical steroidogenesis. However, the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated and it is unclear if this involves acute and/or chronic processes. By Northern analysis and the quantitative technique of TaqMan PCR we investigated whether chromaffin cells influence the regulation of StAR and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), both required for the rate-limiting step, the delivery of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane. StAR mRNA levels in bovine adrenocortical cells were increased by incubation with chromaffin cell-conditioned medium (CCM). Short-term treatment for 4 h resulted in a greater stimulation (229+/-29% of basal, mean+/-SEM) than did longer incubation times of 8 h and 5 days (159+/-13 and 177+/-24%). Neither short nor a long-term treatment affected PBR expression. Consistently, the major secretion of chromaffin cells, epinephrine dose-dependently stimulated StAR expression with no effect on PBR mRNA. In conclusion, adrenomedullary secretory products are not necessary for the maintenance of PBR expression but facilitate steroid biosynthesis by increasing StAR mRNA expression and therefore can account for an ACTH-independent regulation of the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis.", 
    "148": "Social phobia is a common disorder associated with significant psychosocial impairment, representing a substantial public health problem largely determined by the high prevalence, and the lifelong chronicity. Social phobia starts in early childhood or adolescence and is often comorbid with depression, other anxiety disorders, alcohol and substance abuse or eating disorders. This cascade of comorbidity, usually secondary to social phobia, increases the disability associated with the condition. The possibility that social phobia may be a trigger for later developing comorbid disorders directs attention to the need for early effective treatment as a preventive measure. The most recent drug class to be investigated for the psychopharmacological treatment of social phobia is the SSRI group for which there is growing support. The other drug classes that have been evaluated are monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers. The SSRIs represent a new and attractive therapeutic choice for patients with generalized social phobia. Recently the first, large scale, placebo-controlled study to assess the efficacy of drug treatment in generalized social phobia has been completed with paroxetine. Paroxetine was more effective in reducing the symptoms than placebo and was well tolerated. Many now regard SSRIs as the drugs of choice in social phobia because of their effectiveness and because they avoid the problems of treatment with benzodiazepines or classical MAOIs.", 
    "149": "The use of clonazepam in the long-term treatment of epilepsy is greatly inhibited by its capacity to induce tolerance and dependence. A means of preventing or minimizing the tolerance and dependence inducing properties is required. Here the role of nitric oxide in preventing the development of tolerance and withdrawal hyperexcitability was studied. In Wistar rats, clonazepam at a dose of 0.25 mg/kg i.p. twice daily produced tolerance to its anticonvulsant action in 28 days. After sudden cessation of therapy it produced hyperexcitability. Tolerance was shown by a decrease in seizure threshold to near control value while withdrawal hyperexcitability was evidenced by a significant decrease in seizure threshold below the control value. L-Arginine (a donor of nitric oxide) and N omega-nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) were given in doses of 150 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg, respectively on day 1, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 with clonazepam. Withdrawal hyperexcitability was seen on day 1, 2 and 4 after cessation of drug therapy. Electroshock was used as a model of epilepsy and seizure thresholds were determined by an up and down method of Kimball et al. L-Arginine was found to inhibit the development tolerance as well as withdrawal hyperexcitability when administered with clonazepam while N omega-L-arginine did not prevent either the development of tolerance or withdrawal hyperexcitability in the electroshock model. In the PTZ model, however, L-arginine had no effect on the anticonvulsant action and withdrawal hyperexcitability while inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis prevented withdrawal hyperexcitability in PTZ-induced seizures.", 
    "150": "Mice submitted to forced swimming session(s) displayed a long lasting modification in their nociceptive threshold, assessed through their jump latency from a hot plate (55 degrees C). Thus two forced swimming sessions (6 min each, 8h apart), in water at 33 degrees C, increased by about 50% the jump latency when the hot plate test was performed 14 hours, 3 days or 6 days thereafter. The water temperature (16 degrees C vs 33 degrees C) had no critical influence in this respect. To be clearly effective (at 33 degrees C) the swimming session had to be performed twice (when performed only once it was irregularly effective); it apparently culminated for a 6 min duration, since its effectiveness was not significantly increased by extending the swimming time to 12 min or 18 min. Performing 2 forced swimming sessions (6 min each, 8h apart), 5 consecutive days, resulted in a suppression of the increase in jump latency in the hot plate test. The two forced swimming episodes-induced analgesia was prevented by the s.c. administration of diazepam (from 0.125 mg/kg) or morphine (from 5 mg/kg) or scopolamine (1 mg/kg) before each forced swimming episode. Morphine (7.5 mg/kg) was uneffective to prevent the induction of two forced swimming episodes-induced analgesia when it was administered immediately after each forced swimming session. Finally this analgesia was dose dependently reversed by naloxone (ID(50) = 0.14 mg/kg, s.c., 30 min before the hot plate test). It is hypothesized that the handling of mice immediately before the hot plate test induces the remembrance of the stress induced by previous forced swimming episodes, triggering a fear reaction which increases the nociceptive threshold.", 
    "151": "Rat brain poly(A)(+) mRNA was injected into Xenopus oocytes. After 72-96 hr, GABA(A) receptors expressed in this heterologous system were studied by perfusion of GABA and recording of GABA evoked chloride current under voltage-clamp conditions. The GABA activated currents were blocked by bicuculline and enhanced by flunitrazepam. Acidic (6.4) extracellular pH (pH(e) ) augmented, whereas basic pH (8.4) decreased the current evoked by 100 microM GABA in the respect of the current evoked at pH 7.4. Concentration-response curves for GABA evoked chloride currents were built at the three pHs. These data showed that acidic pH does not change the EC50 for GABA but it increases significantly I(max) in comparison to pH 7.4. At pH 8.4 there was a significant decrease of EC50 for GABA. However, there was also a very strong decrease of I(max), so that the overall effect at 100 microM GABA was a decrease of GABA activated chloride current in the respect of the one activated at neutral pH. These data may indicate that on average brain GABA(A) receptors are positively modulated by extracellular acidosis. The opposite may occur in extracellular alcalosis.", 
    "152": "We have previously provided functional evidence that glycine and GABA are contained in the same synaptic vesicles and coreleased at the same synapses in lamina I of the rat spinal dorsal horn. However, whereas both glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are expressed on the postsynaptic target, under certain conditions inhibitory events appeared to be mediated by GlyRs only. We therefore wanted to test whether GABA(B) receptors could be activated in conditions where GABA released was insufficient to activate GABA(A)Rs. Focal stimulation in the vicinity of visually identified lamina I neurons elicited monosynaptic IPSCs in the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Pairs of stimuli were given at different interstimulus intervals (ISI), ranging from 25 ms to 1 s to study the depression of the second of evoked IPSCs (paired pulse depression; PPD). Maximal PPD of IPSCs was 60 +/- 14% (SE) (of the conditioning pulse amplitude), at ISI between 150 and 200 ms. PPD was observed with IPSCs evoked at stimulus intensities where they had no GABA(A)R component. PPD of small evoked IPSCs was not affected by the GABA(A)R antagonist bicuculline but significantly attenuated by 10-30 microM CGP52432, a specific GABA(B) receptor antagonist. These data indicate that, under conditions where GABA released is insufficient to affect postsynaptic GABA(A)Rs at lamina I inhibitory synapses, significant activation of presynaptic GABA(B) receptors can occur.", 
    "153": "The effect of benzodiazepines (BZs) on GABA(A)-ergic synaptic responses depends on the control receptor occupancy: the BZ-induced enhancement of receptor affinity can lead to greater peak amplitudes of quantal responses only when, under normal conditions, receptors are not fully saturated at peak. Based on this fact, receptor occupancy at the peak of spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) has been assessed in various mammalian neuronal preparations. To use the same principle with compound (or multiquantal), action potential-evoked IPSCs, complications introduced by quantal asynchrony in conjunction with the BZ-induced increase in the decay time of the quantal responses have to be overcome. We used a simple analytic convolution model to calculate expected changes in the rise time and amplitude of postsynaptic currents when the decay time constant, but not the peak amplitude, of the underlying quantal responses is increased, this being the expected BZ effect at saturated synapses. Predictions obtained were compared with the effect of the BZ flunitrazepam on IPSCs recorded in paired pre- and postsynaptic whole cell voltage-clamp experiments on striatal neurons in cell culture. In 22 pairs, flunitrazepam (500 nM) reliably prolonged the decay of IPSCs (49 +/- 19%, mean +/- SE) and in 18 of 22 cases produced an enhancement in their peak amplitude that varied markedly between 3 and 77% of control (26.0 +/- 5.3%). The corresponding change in rise time, however (+0.38 +/- 0.11 ms, range -0.8 to +1.3 ms) was far smaller than calculated for the observed changes in peak amplitude assuming fixed quantal size. Because therefore an increase in quantal size is required to explain our findings, postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors were most likely not saturated during impulse-evoked transmission at these unitary connections. The peak amplitudes of miniature IPSCs in these neurons were also increased by flunitrazepam (500 nM, +26.8 +/- 6.6%), and their decay time constant was increased by 26.3 +/- 7.3%. Using these values in our model led to a slight overestimate of the change in compound IPSC amplitude (+28 to +30%).",

    "158": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) in reducing separation-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) was examined by peripheral administration (of the selective CCK(A) receptor antagonist devazepide to 10-11-day-old rats. Pups placed alone for 2 min emitted a mean of 55.1 USV/min. When placed on a paper towel wet with warm, sweet milk, USV rate decreased to 23.2/min for the following 8 min. Devazepide (150-600 microg/kg IP) prevented this USV reduction, but did not increase feeding. In contrast, USV reduction produced by contact with the anesthetized dam was not affected by devazepide. Similarly, the opiate antagonist naltrexone (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) has been shown to block morphine-induced USV decrease in pups away from the dam, but was ineffective when USV reduction was induced by the presence of the dam (Blass et al., 1990; Carden & Hofer, 1990). The current findings suggest that CCK's role is specific, in that it mediates milk- but not dam-induced quieting of USV. The results, however, are not incompatible with the possibility that CCK and opioids are part of multiple, redundant pathways that mediate the quieting of USV by the dam.",

    "164": "Human lens cells were perfused with artificial aqueous humor (35 degrees C) after fura-2 incorporation, and calcium levels were measured using a fluorometric single-cell digital imaging system. Acetylcholine was the primary muscarinic agonist, and the receptor subtypes were elucidated by determining the relative effectiveness of pirenzepine and AF-DX 384 in blocking the agonist-induced response. The levels of expression of mRNA for the receptor subtypes M1 through M5 were determined by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) using a sequence detection system (ABI Prism 7700; Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA). This was performed using total RNA extracted from native lens, retina, iris, and sclera and also cultured lens cells.", 
    "165": "Acetylcholine induced a similar concentration-dependent increase in peak-amplitude cytosolic calcium in the range 100 nM to 100 microM in both native and HLE-B3 cells. However, the kinetics of the response waveforms to 30-second pulses of acetylcholine were different in the two cell types. At higher concentrations (> 1 microM), a second phase appeared in the HLE-B3 cells that was absent in the NHLEC response. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values for blockade of a 1 microM acetylcholine response by pirenzepine and AF-DX 384 were 30 nM and 230 nM, respectively, for NHLECs, and 300 nM and 92 nM, respectively, for HLE-B3 cells. The QRT-PCR data showed that more than 90% of the total muscarinic receptor mRNA from NHLEC was of M1 origin. In the HLE-B3 cells, however, more than 95% of the mRNA was of M3 origin. mRNA for M3 was also in greatest abundance in other eye tissues, although there was a significant contribution from M1 in iris and sclera.", 
    "166": "Both NHLECs and HLE-B3 cells express muscarinic receptors that produce significant changes in cytosolic calcium in response to acetylcholine. Both pharmacologic and QRT-PCR evidence shows that whereas the M1 subtype predominates in NHLECs, M3 is the major contributor in HLE-B3 cells. In all other eye tissues, M3 appears to be the major contributor. These data should be taken into account when choosing particular models to investigate cataract mechanisms and also when designing muscarinic agonists to treat glaucoma.",

There are several agents that have been used to provide sedation in the PICU patient including the inhalational anaesthetic agents, benzodiazepines, opioids, ketamine, propofol, chloral hydrate, phenothiazines, and the barbiturates.

Consequences of and treatment strategies for long term problems with prolonged sedation including tolerance, physical dependency, and withdrawal are reviewed.", 
    "172": "To facilitate the discovery of novel compounds that modulate human GABA(A) receptor function, we have developed a high throughput functional assay using a fluorescence imaging system. L(tk-) cells expressing combinations of human GABA(A) receptor subunits were incubated with the pH-sensitive dye 2',7'bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, then washed and placed in a 96-well real-time fluorescence plate reader. In buffer adjusted to pH 6.9 there was a robust and persisting acidification response to addition of GABA, which was antagonised by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. The concentration-response relationship for GABA was modulated by allosteric ligands, including benzodiazepine (BZ) site agonists and inverse agonists. The effects of BZ site ligands on the pH response to GABA for receptors containing alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha3beta3gamma2 or alpha5beta3gamma2 subunits were well correlated with results from electrophysiological studies on the same receptor subunit combinations expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Most modulatory compounds tested were found to be relatively unselective across the three subunit combinations tested; however, some showed subtype-dependent efficacy, such as diazepam, which had highest agonist effects on the alpha3beta3gamma2 subtype, substantial but lesser agonism on alpha1beta3gamma2 and still substantial but the least agonism on alpha5beta3gamma2. This indicates that the alpha subunit within the recombinant receptor expressed in L(tk-) cells can affect the efficacy of the response to some BZ compounds. Inhibitors of Na(+)/Cl(-) cotransport, anion/anion exchange and the gastric type of H(+)/K(+) ATPase potently inhibited GABA-evoked acidification, indicating that multiple transporters are involved in the GABA-evoked pH change. This novel fluorescence-based high throughput functional assay allows the rapid characterization of allosteric ligands acting on human GABA(A) receptors."
