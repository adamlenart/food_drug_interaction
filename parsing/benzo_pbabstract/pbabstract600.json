Of nitrazepam in simple binary powder mixtures with talcum, lactose-H2O, microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, mannitol, and saccharose are shown to be linearly related to the nitrogen adsorption energy of the excipients.", 
    "1": "Many injectable formulations currently on the market, including diazepam and alprazolam, utilize one or more cosolvents to solubilize the active constituents. On injections into an aqueous medium, some of these components tend to precipitate. A simple procedure is described for measuring the degree of precipitation that occurs when a solubilized drug is injected. This in vitro technique was used to show that alprazolam injection shows less precipitation than diazepam injection under all tested conditions, and that the precipitation observed with diazepam can be controlled by ensuring that the formulation is injected very slowly. This simple technique also can be used during preformulation development to evaluate the relative potential for precipitation of various formulations.", 
    "2": "Compared medical and social setting detoxification treatments of alcohol withdrawal syndrome on the degree to which each involved alcoholics in ongoing rehabilitative efforts. Two hundred patients were selected randomly from both treatments and administered the Physical Problem Inventory, Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test, Assessment of Life Experience, and Level of Motivation scales. Analysis of covariance with multiple covariates was employed to assess the effect of the treatment model on willingness to continue rehabilitation as measured by the dependent variable, ongoing referral status. The difference between detoxification treatment models was highly significant, and none of the covariates, which controlled for pretest differences and the assignment process, was significant. Results are discussed in the context of current notions of pharmacotherapy, learning, and physiological models of withdrawal treatment. In addition, expectancies, in terms of perceived responsibility for outcome, are discussed as important factors that contribute to the discrepancy between medical vs. social models in the treatment of alcoholism.", 
    "3": "Intramuscular chlordiazepoxide (CDX) is commonly administered to alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patients requiring prompt management of alcohol agitation, anxiety, and delirium tremors. Sedative action is associated with plasma levels of approximately 2.0 mcg/ml, however, intramuscular CDX has been shown to produce peak concentrations consistently below 2.0 mcg/ml in normal subjects. The present study was designed to define the absorption characteristics of intramuscular 25 mg CDX in males with ALD. Five normal males had mean CDX absorption half-lives of 3.0 h and peaked at 0.8 mcg/ml in 7.2 h, while 11 males with ALD had mean absorption half-lives of 9.0 h, and peaked at 0.7 mcg/ml in 19.1 h when they received the drug dissolved in normal saline. Four other males with ALD who received CDX dissolved in the manufacturer's diluent had significantly slower mean absorption half-lives of 16.1 h which peaked at 0.3 mcg/ml in 35.2 h. Significant linear correlations were found with age (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01), body weight (r = 0.55, p less than 0.01), and serum albumin (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). Because of the extremely slow intramuscular absorption of CDX dissolved in normal saline or the manufacturer's diluent in males with ALD, we do not recommend this route of administration in this population.", 
    "4": "Oral pentazocine-atropine, oral diazepam-atropine and IM pentazocine-atropine were compared as preoperative medication in children. Observations in 300 children ages 1-14 years included the emotional state at time of induction of anaesthesia, smoothness of induction, dryness of oral mucosa and tongue, incidence of vomiting, and emotional state and length of stay in the recovery room. The incidence of a calm state at the time of induction and smoothness of induction of anaesthesia was the same following oral and IM premedication. There was satisfactory drying of salivary secretions. The incidence of vomiting in the recovery room was the same following oral and IM premedication. However, children in age groups 1-4 and 5-9 years who received diazepam-atropine were more restless in the recovery room than those who received oral or IM pentazocine-atropine. More children in groups 1-4 and 5-9 years who received IM pentazocine-atropine stayed longer in the recovery room. We conclude that oral diazepam-atropine and oral pentazocine-atropine are comparable as to preoperative medication IM pentazocine-atropine and that they can be given as an alternate to intramuscular injection.", 
    "5": "Intact neutrophil function is essential for the defence against infection. Any alteration in neutrophil function, which decreases their ability to phagocytose and kill bacteria, might contribute to mortality and morbidity. We investigated the effects of clinical concentrations of thiopentone, Alfathesin, methohexitone, morphine, lidocaine and diazepam on the microbicidal oxidative function of human neutrophils. The oxidative activity was assessed utilizing the technique of chemiluminescence, which is a measure of free radical generation. Thiopentone and Alfathesin produced a significant dose dependent depression in chemiluminescence. There was a 27 per cent reduction in activity with thiopentone 5 micrograms X ml-1, a concentration equivalent to the free plasma concentration achieved following an anaesthetizing dose of thiopentone. There was a 55 per cent reduction in chemiluminescence at an alphaxolone concentration of 1.25 micrograms X ml-1, a concentration equivalent to the free plasma level obtained after induction of Alfathesin anaesthesia. The effect of thiopentone and Alfathesin was reversed by cell washing. Methohexitone, morphine, diazepam, and lidocaine caused no significant reduction in chemiluminescence over the dose ranges studied. These observations indicate that thiopentone and Alfathesin can adversely affect leucocyte function in vitro and, therefore, may contribute to impaired host resistance in the perioperative period and in the intensive care unit.", 
    "6": "We measured ventilation and static lung volumes in five fit volunteers in the right lateral decubitus position, while they were fully awake and while sedated with diazepam. We also assessed the distributions of ventilation and perfusion in the lungs, using inhalations and intravenous injections of xenon-127. Diazepam, 0.04 mg . kg-1, was administered every three to five minutes as required to induce and maintain a state of sedation which was moderately heavy. Total doses ranged from 0.16 to 0.38 mg . kg-1. Sedation did not alter minute ventilation, but reduced tidal volume, increased breathing frequency and reduced functional residual capacity slightly. Sedation also diminished the normal gradient of ventilation from non-dependent to dependent regions of the lungs. Spontaneous episodes of very small tidal volume breathing during sedation were associated with a marked reduction or cessation of ventilation of the most dependent region of the lungs. There were no sedation-related changes in the distribution of perfusion. These effects of moderately heavy sedation may contribute to the hypoxaemia and impairment of pulmonary gas exchange often present during recovery from general anaesthesia.", 
    "7": "Using the potential-sensitive dye (3,3-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine) [dis-C3-(5)] it has been shown that synaptosomes isolated from the rat brain cortex by the method of Haj\u00f4s retain their transmembrane potential (TMP) close to the K+-diffusional one. In the Krebs-Ringer medium containing 5 mM KCl the TMP of the synaptosomes was equal to 70-80 mV. The cytostatics cytochalazine B and colchicine and the peptides leu- and met-enkephalins and tuftcin in concentrations up to 10(-3) and 10(-4) M did not affect the TMP of the synaptosomes. Cytochalazine B in a concentration of 4 X 10(-4) M and over caused synaptosomal aggregation. The neuroleptics aminazine, trifluoroperazine, haloperidol, the antidepressant imipramine in concentrations about 10(-4) M as well as the tranquilizers diazepam and phenazepam in concentrations about 10(-3) M completely depolarized synaptosomal membranes.", 
    "8": "The effects of sedation with halothane, enflurane or midazolam on respiratory mechanics and lung volumes were studied in young healthy volunteers, in the supine position. Functional residual capacity increased with halothane sedation, but was unchanged with sedation produced by enflurane or midazolam. Sedation with halothane and enflurane, but not midazolam, tended to increase lung static recoil pressure. Total lung capacity was decreased during sedation with midazolam. No evidence was found that sedation with these three agents increased airway resistance. These findings imply that changes in respiratory mechanics induced by the residual effects of anaesthetic agents are unlikely to contribute significantly to the impairment in pulmonary gas exchange which may occur in the period immediately after operation.", 
    "9": "Status epilepticus is a medical emergency. Recent experimental studies have shown that permanent brain damage can occur after only 60 minutes of uncontrolled seizure activity. Cardiac arrhythmias are a common cause of death. Other complications include rhabdomyolysis, acute tubular necrosis and neurogenic pulmonary edema.

    "10": "The paper presents a secondary analysis of students treated in hospital emergency rooms. The comparison of data provided in 1974 and 1980 data reveals a significant increase in the abuse of alcohol with drugs, methaqualone and marijuana. Fifty percent of these students ingested drugs to commit suicide or as a suicide gesture. These data suggest that school health professionals and counselors be alerted to student drug overdoses to assist students confronted with suicidal ideation.", 
    "11": "Prolonged recovery from intravenous diazepam after the day of administration has been examined in 2,468 consecutive patients who underwent oral surgery and general dentistry. Patients ranged in age from 2 to 94 years and received a mean diazepam dose of 19 mg, either by itself or with small amounts of methohexital sodium. Recovery was assessed by use of a questionnaire, and the answers were related to sexual gender, age, weight, dosage, procedure, duration, level of apprehension, and results of the sedation.", 
    "12": "The acetylcholine (ACh) release was studied in superfused, electrically-stimulated slices of guinea-pig cerebral cortex. Muscimol and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo (5-4-c)-pyridin-3-ol (THIP), as well as exogenous GABA, reduced the electrically-evoked ACh release and enhanced its spontaneous outflow. Picrotoxin antagonized these effects. In addition, picrotoxin and ethanolamine-O-sulphate (EOS) caused opposite changes in transmitter outflow, suggesting the existence of an exogenous GABAergic control on the cholinergic nerve endings. Neither flurazepam 6.6 X 10(-6)--3.3 X10(-5) mol/l nor diazepam 3.3 X 10(-6)--3.3 X 10(-5) mol/l by themselves affected ACh release. Diazepam prevented GABA-, muscimol- and EOS-induced changes in spontaneous and 1 Hz-evoked outflow. Ro 15-1788 3.3 X 10(*-6) mol/l abolished diazepam antagonism vs exogenous GABA. The ineffectiveness of flurazepam and diazepam on normal release (i.e. the lack of potentiation vs the endogenous GABAergic control) supports the view that \"synaptic\" GABA receptors acting upon the cholinergic nerve endings are not coupled with Benzodiazepine receptors. The unexpected diazepam antagonism vs exogenous GABA and GABA-like compounds can be explained with an unusual Diazepam negative cooperation with \"extrasynaptic\" GABA receptors, possibly present on the cholinergic terminals. Thus, the rule of benzodiazepine-GABA synergism does not seem always tenable, at least at certain pre-synaptic sites.", 
    "13": "Seven GABAmimetic drugs, namely cetyl gamma-aminobutyric acid (cetyl GABA), 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c]pyridine-3-ol, progabide, aminooxyacetic acid, alpha-acetylenic GABA, (-)-nipecotic acid ethyl ester and (+/-)-cis-4-hydroxynipecotic acid methyl ester, were tested for their potency to block \"major\" (generalized clonic-tonic) seizures in gerbils, induced by blowing at the animals with compressed air. Valproic acid was included as a reference standard. All drugs proved able to protect gerbils from induced seizures. Most effective were 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo [5,4-c] pyridine-3-ol (ED50, 1.3 mg/kg i.p.), aminooxyacetic acid (0.9), cetyl GABA (4.5) and gamma-acetylenic GABA (2.1). A comparison with anticonvulsant ED50 values of common antiepileptics in the gerbil showed that these four GABAmimetics were clearly more potent than phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ethosuximide and valproic acid and were only surpassed in potency by diazepam. Furthermore, most GABAmimetics proved strikingly more active in the gerbil compared with the classical electroshock and pentylenetetrazol seizure models in mice. After administration of gamma-acetylenic GABA, GABA increases in the brain of only about 40% were found sufficient to reach almost complete seizure protection in gerbils. The present data are compatible with the possibility that the GABA system is critically involved in the seizure-prone state in the gerbil.", 
    "14": "Cigarette smoking is one of a number of environmental factors that contribute to interindividual variations in response to an administered drug. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke induce hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase and cytochrome P448 and increased levels of these enzymes are responsible for a higher metabolic clearance of drugs which are substrates for these enzymes. The clinical significance of this induction is greatest for those drugs with a low therapeutic index such as theophylline. In some cases a modification of the normal therapeutic dose is justified to maintain adequate control. The magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking on the induction of hepatic metabolic activity has been linked with age for a number of drugs including theophylline, some benzodiazepines and propranolol. Generally, the inductive effect is smaller in the elderly but, as there is no direct correlation between chronological age and physiological age, it is imperative that age and smoking habits be treated as individual sources of intersubject variation in pharmacokinetics and that this be borne in mind in the evaluation of new drugs and the safe clinical use of existing ones.", 
    "15": "The use of tricyclic antidepressants as opposed to hypnotics in treating insomnia is reviewed. Available data indicate that TCAs alleviate sleep disturbances related to depression (often before antidepressant effects are seen) and, in selected cases, may prove effective in disturbed sleep related to sleep apnea, fibrositis, and sleep related bruxism, as well as in adults with childhood onset insomnia or a history of hyperkinesis. However, TCAs share many of the problems reported for hypnotics, as well as having some potentially serious side effects not present with benzodiazepines. The need for determination of the etiology of sleep disorders, and specific pharmacotherapy directed toward identified causes rather than the symptom of insomnia, is stressed.", 
    "16": "The pathogenesis, clinical signs, and conventional treatment of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) are briefly discussed, and the use of drugs with tricyclic structures in the treatment of PUD is reviewed. Peptic ulcers occur most commonly in the duodenal bulb and the stomach. Numerous factors contribute to the formation of peptic ulcers, but an imbalance between acid and pepsin secretion and mucosal resistance is considered important. Conventional drug therapy of PUD with antacids, H2-receptor antagonists, anticholinergic drugs, and sucralfate is designed to correct this imbalance by neutralizing acid, inhibiting acid secretion, preventing contact of the ulcer with acid and pepsin, and enhancing mucosal defense mechanisms. Tricyclic agents that appear to be useful in the treatment of PUD are the tricyclic antidepressants, trimipramine maleate and doxepin hydrochloride, and the selective antimuscarinic drug, pirenzepine hydrochloride. The therapeutic effects of tricyclic antidepressants may result from their anticholinergic, antidepressant, and H2-receptor blocking actions. Controlled clinical trials suggest that trimipramine 50 mg/day (as the maleate salt) and pirenzepine hydrochloride 100-150 mg/day are superior to placebo and may be as effective as cimetidine for the short-term treatment of duodenal ulcers. Limited data suggest that these drugs are also effective for treating gastric ulcers. Assessment of the apparent efficacy of doxepin in duodenal ulcer treatment requires further study. Anticholinergic side effects and sedation associated with the administration of tricyclic agents may limit their usefulness as first-line anti-ulcer agents. With further evidence of their efficacy, trimipramine, doxepin, and pirenzepine may play an important role in the treatment of patients unresponsive to conventional anti-ulcer therapy.", 
    "17": "The neurological complications of malaria--an almost universal problem although it occurs mainly in the tropics--constitute the commonest cause of death and morbidity. These complications usually occur in P. falciparum infections and in those who are non-immune, such as children, pregnant women and visitors to areas endemic for malaria. They are rare in children suffering from protein-calorie malnutrition. Febrile convulsions, the commonest childhood emergency in the African and cerebral malaria are the commonest neurological complications. Spinal cord disorders and polyneuropathy have been described but are rare. It has been suggested that various forms of mental illness and psychoses may be related to malarial infections, but much research is needed to establish cause and effect relationship. The neuropathology and pathogenesis, clinical presentations, treatment and mortality of the neurological complications are reviewed.", 
    "18": "3H-Flunitrazepam (500 pM) was used to estimate the inhibitory effects of caffeine, theophylline, theobromine and 3-methylxanthine on binding to rat brain homogenates. Caffeine and theophylline showed a low affinity competitive type of inhibition in vitro, but no inhibition in vivo. Low concentrations of caffeine failed to show clear inhibitory capabilities against low concentrations of 3H-flunitrazepam. The results suggest that only the toxic central nervous system effects of methylxanthines are mediated via the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "19": "In experiments of male Wistar rats, it was established that a long-term apomorphine treatment caused changes in density of benzodiazepine receptors in forebrain structures opposite to those elicited by acute administration. The changes in benzodiazepine binding correlated with decrease of antiaggressive effect of diazepam and Ro 15-1788 after long-term apomorphine administration. The action of apomorphine on the benzodiazepine receptors was not direct, as apomorphine did not change the benzodiazepine agonist-antagonist interaction, and naloxone, opiate blocator, was a more powerful antagonist of antiaggressive action of diazepam than Ro 15-1788. The involvement of the two types of benzodiazepine receptors in the regulation of aggressive behavior is suggested, the first being apparently linked with GABA and opiate receptors and the other one--with the serotoninergic system. Ro 15-1788 was able to antagonize the effects of diazepam on the first but not on the second type of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "20": "Stereotyped head twitches in mice were induced by clonazepam. The number of head twitches produced was directly related to the clonazepam dose. In addition to head twitches, clonazepam produced dose-related muscle relaxation. Methysergide antagonized the action of clonazepam on head twitches. However, methysergide failed to block the muscle relaxant action. In contrast to methysergide, the benzodiazepine receptor antagonists CGS 8216 and Ro 15-1788 blocked the muscle relaxant effects of clonazepam. Neither CGS 8216 nor Ro 15-1788 blocked the clonazepam-induced head twitches. These data suggest that the muscle relaxant effects of clonazepam are mediated by benzodiazepine/GABA receptor systems that can be blocked by CGS 8216 and Ro 15-1788. On the other hand, it is proposed that the benzodiazepine-induced head twitch effect is mediated by a benzodiazepine/serotonin 2 receptor system.", 
    "21": "Intraperitoneal injection of ethanol (1-2 g/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (2-16 mg/kg) suppressed susceptibility to audiogenically induced, clonic-tonic seizures and antagonized forelimb tremor in rats undergoing ethanol withdrawal, 30 min after treatment. However, a smaller dose of ethanol (0.5 g/kg) actually increased clonic seizure frequency, suggesting that ethanol exerts a biphasic proconvulsant/anticonvulsant action. Direct activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors by intracisternal administration of GABA (100-1000 micrograms), muscimol (0.3-1.0 micrograms) or 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) (0.3-3.0 micrograms) 5 to 10 min before testing also reduced susceptibility to audiogenic clonic-tonic seizures. In sharp contrast to these anticonvulsant actions, GABA, muscimol and THIP had no effect on withdrawal-induced forelimb tremors. Blockade of GABA uptake with 1-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (300 and 600 mg/kg i.p.) and inhibition of GABA transaminase with aminooxyacetic acid (12.5 and 25.0 mg/kg i.p.) both reduced susceptibility to seizures. However, anticonvulsant doses of these two drugs, unlike GABA, muscimol and THIP, also reduced forelimb tremor. Three other GABA transaminase inhibitors, gamma-vinyl GABA (450 and 900 mg/kg i.p.), gamma-acetylenic GABA (50-150 mg/kg i.p.) and ethanolamine-O-sulfate (250-750 mg/kg i.p.), were inactive against ethanol withdrawal audiogenic seizures and forelimb tremors. These results indicate that direct GABA receptor activation can selectively suppress one type of ethanol withdrawal response (i.e., audiogenic seizure susceptibility) while failing to influence another (forelimb tremors).", 
    "22": "The effect of various concentrations of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) on [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors was investigated by Hofstee and Hill plot analyses. These analyses indicate the presence of two PTZ binding sites in forebrain, whereas a single PTZ binding site is present in cerebellum. The relative proportions of the two PTZ binding sites in forebrain are close to those of benzodiazepine Type II and Type I receptors, respectively. These results suggest that PTZ may actually discriminate between different types of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "23": "Rat brain benzodiazepine receptors have been solubilized by means of the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS under conditions in which the GABA stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine receptors is maintained intact. This stimulation is partially or totally abolished when using other conventional detergents.", 
    "24": "Despite evidence that ACTH release after stress is under excitatory hypothalamic control, a stimulatory role for any of the monoamine neurotransmitters is yet to be clearly demonstrated. In the present investigation computerized gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to assess the neuronal activities of hypothalamic dopamine, norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in rats after stress-induced ACTH release. Medial basal hypothalamic NE neuronal activity as assessed by the ratio of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DHPG) to NE. (DHPG/NE) was elevated (P less than 0.0005) within 2 min after a 3-min cold water swim stress. Ether stress also caused a marked elevation in NE activity (P less than 0.0025). A highly significant positive correlation between the ratio of hypothalamic DHPG/NE and serum corticosterone was found over a large population of normal and stressed rats. Consistent with this relationship between hypothalamic NE neuronal activity and ACTH release being a causal one were the findings that 1) adrenalectomized rats exhibited markedly elevated hypothalamic DHPG/NE ratio and serum ACTH (both P less than 0.0005) together with serum corticosterone levels reduced to about 3% of control levels (P less than 0.0005), and 2) the administration to rats of the alpha-blocker yohimbine or the antianxiety agent diazepam resulted in significant changes in hypothalamic NE activity, together with parallel changes in ACTH secretion. In hypothyroid rats, which have elevated hypothalamic 5-HT activity, and in normal gentled rats, stress caused a significant reduction in hypothalamic 5-HT activity. High hypothalamic activity of dopamine or 5-HT in hypothyroid rats did not significantly affect basal ACTH levels nor prevent the responses to either cold water swim or ether stress, and both stresses resulted in elevated hypothalamic DHPG/NE, serum ACTH, and serum corticosterone (all P less than 0.005) in these animals. From these data it is concluded that NE is an excitatory hypothalamic monoamine for ACTH release in stress and that hypothalamic 5-HT activity is reduced after stress.", 
    "25": "Hyperventilation may be induced by several organic factors. The HVS-hyperventilation and symptoms such as hypertonia and pain-hypocapnia and disturbance of the acid-base balance--other symptoms--anxiousness--hyperventilation--etc. In the adaptation-hyperventilation and symptoms such as hypertonia and pain,-hupocapnia and disturbance of the acid-base balance-other symptoms--anxiousness--hyperventilation--etc. In the adaptation process one distinguishes the load, the strain and a tension or counterforce (stress). In the cause and effect relationship between the adaptation process and a specific pathology, it is obvious that the strain is the only element capable of eliciting the specific pathology or syndrome. Stress is a compensation for the strain and is therefore beneficial to the organism. The strain is associated with, amongst other things, anxiety and changes in the pyridoxine-L-tryptophan metabolism (nicotinic acid-ribonucleotide synthesis). Stress depends to a large extent on the intact serotonergic transmission in the cerebrum. But serotonin synthesis is critically dependent on the pyridoxine-L-tryptophan metabolism. Benzodiazepines improve the hyperventilation, anxiousness and strain, if these are of the free-floating anxiety type. Tricyclic preparations improve anxiousness in as much as it assumes the character of fear, phobia or an anxiety attack. They are active against strain when that reveals itself as an anxiety attack. Pyridoxine and L-tryptophan as serotonergic agonists, improve the hyperventilation, have a beneficial effect on symptoms such as hypertonia and pain, are effective against anxiousness and anxiety and potentiate the stress. In addition they directly correct the property of strain, i.e. the disturbance of the nicotinicacid-ribonucleotide synthesis. Clomipramine is the most potent serotonergic agonist available. That substance has a favourable effect on hyperventilation, hypertonia and pain, on anxiousness that expresses itself as fear, phobia or an anxiety attack. It favours stress. Further investigation is desirable, in particular of the new serotonergic agonists that have recently been made available or are still to come.", 
    "26": "The in vitro effects of the major non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsants were studied upon potassium-stimulated release of radiolabelled GABA and D-aspartate from minislices of rat cerebral cortex. At 100 mumol/l, some anticonvulsants effective in grand mal seizures (phenytoin, phenobarbitone, mephobarbitone and beclamide) selectively inhibited K+-evoked release of the excitant amino acid D-aspartate, consistent with an anticonvulsant action. In contrast, several other anticonvulsants, namely ethosuximide, methsuximide, carbamazepine, sulthiame and dipropylacetate failed to alter potassium-evoked release of either amino acid. The ionic basis of phenytoin action on release was further studied; interactions with both neuronal calcium and sodium ion channels appear necessary for the drug's inhibitory action.", 
    "27": "The effects of the convulsant barbiturate, 5-(2-cyclohexylidene-ethyl)-5-ethyl barbituric acid (CHEB), on the spontaneous release of [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) from mouse hippocampal slices in an in vitro superfusion system have been evaluated. The pattern of the release of [3H]ACh by a single treatment with CHEB or an elevated potassium concentration was similar, with the peak release occurring in the same fraction. A maximally effective concentration of CHEB (500 microM) caused a 177% stimulation of spontaneous release of [3H]ACh, while 50 mM KCl increased the release by 2100% above the baseline. The stimulation of the spontaneous release of [3H]ACh by CHEB was concentration-dependent with an EC50 of 180 microM. The pattern of release of [3H]ACh induced by multiple treatment with CHEB and elevated potassium appeared to differ, suggesting that different pools of [3H]ACh in the cholinergic neurons might be affected by these treatments. The action of CHEB on the spontaneous release of [3H]ACh was unique among some other convulsant drugs that were studied. Another convulsant barbiturate, S(+)-1-methyl-5-phenyl-5-propyl barbituric acid [S(+)-MPPB], pentylenetetrazol and a convulsant benzodiazepine 1,3-dihydro-5-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2-one (Ro-5-3663) did not affect the spontaneous release of [3H]ACh. The relationship between the stimulation of release of ACh and the convulsant action of the barbiturates is discussed.", 
    "28": "Severely depressed inpatients received alprazolam in doses adjustable from 1.5 mg to 5.0 mg/day. Half of the 26 patients improved with greater than or equal to 50% reduction on the Hamilton Psychiatric Rating Scale for Depression or had a final total score of 8 or less. Patient response to treatment over the 6-week study was associated with marked improvement during the first week.", 
    "29": "The pharmacokinetics and their relation to the pharmacodynamic properties of midazolam, the first water-soluble benzodiazepine derivative, are reviewed. Pharmacokinetically, midazolam is a unique derivative among the benzodiazepines. After both oral and parenteral routes of administration, it has a fast absorption rate, and differing from older derivatives it is very rapidly excreted with a half-life of only about 2 h. A reasonably good correlation has been found with the plasma levels and clinical effects, indicating a fast but short clinical response. Midazolam appears to be a useful short-acting hypnotic having almost no residual effects the following morning. In anesthesiology both oral and parenteral drug forms can be used for premedication. In addition, it is a new alternative for inducing anesthesia when a slow induction time is chosen or its advantageous properties: good cardiovascular stability, transient and mild respiratory depression, low frequency of venous irritation, production of anterograde amnesia, and short duration of action (last-mentioned property in comparison with other benzodiazepines).", 
    "30": "The tranquilizers diazepam and phenazepam inhibited the responses in ventrolateral columns and segmental polysynaptic potentials in the spinal cord evoked by electrical stimulation of somatic nerves. The drugs also inhibited the responses in somavisceral and associative areas of the brain cortex, in specific, associative and nonspecific nuclei of the thalamus and mesencephalic reticular formation evoked by stimulation of visceral and somatic nerves as well as by sound and photostimulation. Diazepam and phenazepam inhibited cortical responses to single and pair stimulation of the fibers of thalamocortical radiation. Ro 15-1788 which is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist promoted the recovery of bioelectrical responses decreased by diazepam and phenazepam. It is suggested that the inhibitory action of diazepam and phenazepam on interneuronal transmission in afferent systems is realized via the involvement of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "31": "The effects of a new 1,4 benzodiazepine hypnotic, loprazolam (1.0 mg) and alcohol (0.7 g/kg body weight) were investigated over a 15 h period in eight healthy male medical students, in a placebo controlled balanced design. Loprazolam when given alone impaired performance on a manual dexterity task, on a test of mental arithmetic, on a tracking task and it impaired memory as judged by the name and address memory test. Given alone, alcohol impaired performance on the simple reaction time task and on the tracking task. Performance on the memory test and choice reaction time test actually improved. No evidence was found suggesting a potentiation of effect when loprazolam and alcohol were given together. However, (a) on the manual dexterity task the alcohol, having no effect on its own, alleviated the loprazolam-induced impairment. (b) In the tracking task both alcohol and loprazolam impaired performance when given alone but not when given together. (c) The memory test was impaired by loprazolam, improved by alcohol and the effect of the combination is the expected sum of the two effects. Similarly for the arithmetic task the effect of the combination of the alcohol and loprazolam effects is the expected sum of the independent effects. The bulk of the evidence on the interaction suggests that alcohol mitigates the effects of loprazolam. In no sense could the drug be said to be having a sobering influence.", 
    "32": "The objective of this double blind study was to compare the sedation following the intravenous injections of midazolam in three dose levels (0.07, 0.10 and 0.15 mg/kg), and to assess the time taken after each dose to return to street fitness. Recovery was monitored by measurement of reaction time. The mean results for each dose were compared against placebo and each other using the Student's t-test. All doses gave a significant (p less than 0.05) lengthening of reaction time compared to placebo. The two highest doses gave similar results when compared to 0.07 mg/kg, but not when compared to each other. Reaction times always returned to control values within 3 hours of injection. The Deletion of Ps test was also employed. A significant correlation was found between the results of reaction time testing and the Deletion of Ps test.", 
    "33": "The ventilatory response to carbon dioxide was measured in volunteers before, and at intervals after the i.v. administration of midazolam 0.075 mg kg-1 and diazepam 0.15 mg kg-1. In the doses used neither drug caused any statistically significant respiratory depression and there were no differences between the drugs.", 
    "34": "Dogs, surgically implanted with a gastric fistula, were chronically dosed with diazepam or lorazepam. Diazepam (60 mg/kg/day) or lorazepam (100 mg/kg/day) was administered intragastrically in four divided daily doses. Beginning no less than 2 weeks after the attainment of stabilization doses, dogs underwent withdrawal experiments, repeated at 2-week intervals. At a time of withdrawal determined by a Latin square crossover design, dogs were observed for 8 hr for signs of abstinence. Both diazepam and lorazepam caused a withdrawal abstinence syndrome to appear upon abrupt discontinuation of the drug. The two abstinence syndromes had many signs in common, including tremor, hot foot walking, rigidity and decreased food intake, but the lorazepam withdrawal abstinence syndrome was much less intense and had a shorter latency to onset than the diazepam abstinence syndrome, which also included clonic and tonic-clonic convulsions and was lethal in two dogs. Furthermore, the diazepam withdrawal abstinence syndrome was biphasic, the first phase apparent by 24 hr and a second phase beginning at 48 hr, whereas the lorazepam syndrome was not. Diazepam suppressed the major signs of diazepam abstinence in a dose-related manner, but failed to completely suppress all signs of abstinence. CGS-8216, a pyrazoloquinoline benzodiazepine antagonist, precipitated abstinence in the diazepam-dependent dog, but did not precipitate tonic-clonic seizures. No abstinence syndrome was precipitated in the lorazepam-dependent dog. These results would suggest that whereas diazepam and lorazepam both cause physical dependence the two syndromes are not the same and, furthermore, that physical dependence on, and withdrawal from, diazepam involves at least two separate mechanisms with different selectivity for benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists.", 
    "35": "Four baboons were trained to discriminate lorazepam (1.0 mg/kg i.m.) and two baboons were trained to discriminate pentobarbital (5.6 mg/kg i.m.) in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure. Food delivery depended on 20 consecutive responses on one lever in sessions preceded by an injection of the training drug and on 20 consecutive responses on the other lever after no drug. All baboons reliably completed 100% of the response runs on the appropriate lever in training sessions. Test sessions were conducted in which a drug dose different from the training dose was injected and 20 consecutive responses on either lever produced food. Drug lever responding occurred after a range of lorazepam and diazepam doses in both lorazepam- and pentobarbital-trained baboons. Drug lever responding also occurred after a range of doses of pentobarbital in the pentobarbital-trained baboons but in only one of the four lorazepam-trained baboons. Ro 15-1788 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg p.o.) antagonized the effect of lorazepam but had no effect on the pentobarbital discriminative stimulus. The asymmetrical generalization with lorazepam and pentobarbital suggests a specificity of discriminative stimulus effects that heretofore have not been documented in drug discrimination experiments with benzodiazepines and barbiturates. The selective antagonism of lorazepam by the benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 suggests that the lorazepam but not the pentobarbital discriminative stimulus is mediated at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "36": "The effect of midazolam, a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, on an in vitro slice preparation of the frog spinal cord was investigated using electrophysiological recordings. Midazolam potently (ED50 = 1 nM) enhanced the depolarizing action of GABA on primary afferent fibres while leaving the depolarizing effect of glutamate, glycine or high K+ solutions unchanged. Concentrations of midazolam higher than 100 nM had an antagonistic effect on GABA responses. Ro 14-7437 was a powerful and selective antagonist of the midazolam potentiation without affecting control responses to GABA, glutamate or high K+. The antagonism of GABA responses induced by high doses of midazolam was not sensitive to Ro 14-7437. Our data suggest that midazolam is a very potent and selective modulator of GABA responses: this finding illustrates that electrophysiological techniques can detect specific effects of very low concentrations of benzodiazepines on a CNS slice preparation with well preserved architectural organization.", 
    "37": "The intraperitoneal administration of DMCM (0.5-3 mg/kg) produced a dose-related increase in the content of cyclic GMP in the rat cerebellar cortex. The effect of DMCM on cyclic GMP was abolished by pretreatment with benzodiazepine receptor ligands, diazepam and Ro15-1788 and by the GABA agonist muscimol. The results suggest that DMCM increases cerebellar cyclic GMP content through a direct action on benzodiazepine receptors located in the cerebellar cortex. The interaction between DMCM and the GABAergic system associated with benzodiazepine receptors is discussed. Cerebellar cyclic GMP content can be used as a biochemical index to differentiate agonists and antagonists for benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "38": "In an open study of 50 patients with heroin addiction, clonidine was efficacious by mouth in the treatment of acute heroin-withdrawal syndrome. Mean administration of clonidine (on an \"as-needed\" basis) was 5 days (maximum 7 days), whilst the mean daily dosage ranged from 0.112 mg to 0.468 mg, the maximum requirement occurring on day 2 of withdrawal and sinking thereafter. Since insomnia was not influenced by clonidine, we offered 100 mg doxepine and/or 10 mg nitrazepam (the latter only until day 4 of treatment). Under this medication a sudden, dramatic decrease in blood pressure was not seen, mean blood pressure and pulse rate were not markedly altered; this may, perhaps, be a consequence of the blocking effect of doxepine on the peripheral hypotensive actions of clonidine. Of the 9 drop-outs from treatment, five (10% of the total 50) were certainly directly attributable to the lack of response to clonidine, representing a failure of therapy in 10% cases at least.", 
    "39": "When a rat is shocked via a prod in a chamber with sawdust on the floor it will typically push the flooring material with snout and forepaws towards and over the prod. We administered diazepam (.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) and oxprenolol (10 and 20 mg/kg) the day following shock exposure, and observed the complete suppression of burying by diazepam, and some suppression with oxprenolol. These effects are independent of interference with initial association of shock and prod, and of changes in general activity.", 
    "40": "Normal human urine contains both monoamine oxidase-inhibiting and benzodiazepine receptor-binding material. Each was extracted into ethyl acetate at pH 1 and subjected to high performance liquid chromatography: they ran similarly, showing three major peaks. The correlation coefficient between the pattern of MAO inhibition and inhibition of 3H-flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors in the second half of the elution process was 0.78 (p less than 0.001): most UV-absorbing material present was eluted earlier in the run. These results are compatible with, although they do not prove, the hypothesis that the endogenous MAO inhibitor, previously shown to be increased in stress, is also an endogenous inhibitor of 3H-flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine receptor. This material is different from other putative endogenous ligands: it migrates more rapidly than the potent but artefactual beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester previously isolated from human urine; nor can the effect we have identified derive from harmane, inosine, hypoxanthine or nicotinamide which fail to extract into ethyl acetate at pH 1.", 
    "41": "Brotizolam, a new thieno-triazolodiazepine, was tested against flunitrazepam and placebo on patients the night before surgery. Flunitrazepam had a shorter onset of action while brotizolam caused longer and deeper sleep with no gastro-intestinal side-effects. It was preferred to flunitrazepam by the patients.", 
    "42": "High affinity [3H]diazepam binding sites were identified on neurons prepared from the hemispheres of 8-day-old chick embryos and grown in serum-containing or serum-free medium. Clonazepam (IC50 = 3 nM) was more potent than Ro 5-4864 (IC50 greater than 1000 nM) in displacing [3H]diazepam binding. GABA and pentobarbital, in the presence of chloride ions were able to stimulate [3H]diazepam binding synergistically. These interactions were found to be comparable to those observed in mammalian brain.", 
    "43": "Animals can be trained to discriminate the presence of pentylenetetrazol, and this discrimination has previously been proposed as an animal bioassay for anxiogenicity. In rats made dependent on diazepam, pentylenetetrazol-like stimuli occurred during spontaneous or precipitated (with RO 15-1788) withdrawal; these stimuli were blocked by pentobarbital. These results demonstrate that the pentylenetetrazol-based animal model of anxiety can be used to objectively quantify a subjective aspect of benzodiazepine dependence/withdrawal.", 
    "44": "The effect of CGS 8216 (10 mg/kg) alone and in combination with the imidazodiazepine Ro 15-1788 (10 mg/kg) or ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE 1 mg/kg) was tested in the social interaction test of anxiety. All 3 compounds were found to have an anxiogenic action. When Ro 15-1788 or beta-CCE was combined with CGS 8216, no mutual antagonism of the drugs' effects was observed. The failure of Ro 15-1788 to antagonize the anxiogenic action of CGS 8216 raises the possibility that CGS 8216 might be acting at a non-benzodiazepine site.", 
    "45": "We have used light microscopic autoradiography to localize differentially Type 1 and 2 benzodiazepine receptors using pharmacologic and detergent treatment techniques. The triazolopyridazine CL218872 has preferential affinity for Type 1 receptors from which it displaces [3H]flunitrazepam selectivity. In biochemical experiments [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites with pharmacologic properties of Type 2 receptors are preferentially solubilized from brain membranes by detergents. We have now treated rat brain slices either with CL218872 or 2% sodium cholate and evaluated the autoradiographic distribution of [3H]flunitrazepam-labeled receptors. Whether calculated from the drug or detergent treated preparations, the relative densities of apparent Type 1 and 2 receptors are the same. Thus differential sensitivity to determine solubilization distinguishes the same two populations of receptors as Type 1 and 2 specific drugs.", 
    "46": "The diazepam-like agonist and diazepam antagonist properties of the pyrazoloquinoline benzodiazepine receptor ligands CGS8216, CGS9895 and CGS9896 were evaluated in rats trained to discriminate between saline and 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam in a two-choice, discrete-trial procedure. None of the three pyrazoloquinolines produced diazepam-like discriminative effects over the dose range of 1.0-30 mg/kg. The effects of 1.0 mg/kg of diazepam were antagonized by CGS8216 and CGS9895, but not by CGS9896. The present results provide behavioral evidence for benzodiazepine receptor heterogeneity.", 
    "47": "Binding studies conducted with [3H]Ro 5-4864, a specific ligand for peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, on circulating lymphocytes from 5 normal volunteers provided evidence for a single, saturable (Bmax 12.2 +/- 3.6 fmol/10(6) cells), and high affinity (KD 7.1 +/- 2.0 nM) specific binding site. We were unable to detect any GABA receptor, suggesting that human lymphocytes bear a peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site not coupled with the GABA system. Results on lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukemics are also reported.", 
    "48": "The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) to Type 1 and Type 2 benzodiazepine receptors in rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex was differentiated by the addition of 200 nM CL218,872 which preferentially displaces [3H]FLU from Type 1 receptors. Type 1 but not Type 2 receptor binding was significantly stimulated by 1 mM sodium pentobarbital.", 
    "49": "This double-blind study involved the continuous (six to 22 weeks) treatment of 180 chronically anxious outpatients with diazepam, 15 to 40 mg/day. Our findings indicate that a significant number of patients benefit from prolonged diazepam treatment and that tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of diazepam does not develop during a 22-week study period. The duration of continual treatment with sedative-benzodiazepines was clearly the most important determinant of withdrawal reactions. Patients treated continuously for less than eight months with sedative-benzodiazepines had an incidence of withdrawal of 5%, whereas 43% of patients treated for eight months or more demonstrated clear withdrawal reactions. While these withdrawal reactions produced considerable distress, they were neither life threatening nor incapacitating and did not include convulsions or psychotic reactions. In all cases, withdrawal reactions could be readily managed by gradually tapering the dose of the benzodiazepine.", 
    "50": "Diazepam (10-1000 nM) enhanced the binding of [3H]GABA and of the monocyclic GABA agonist [3H]muscimol, but failed to alter binding of the bicyclic GABA agonist [3H]THIP to fresh, well washed rat brain membranes incubated at 2 degrees C. Although stimulation of [3H]diazepam binding by THIP was observed at higher incubation temperatures and in the presence of chloride ions, these measures did not induce a corresponding enhancement of [3H]THIP binding by diazepam. These results extend earlier observations of the unusual behavior of THIP as a selective GABA agonist, and emphasize that enhancement of benzodiazepine binding by GABA agonists is not necessarily reflected in a complementary manner by any action of benzodiazepines on the binding of GABA agonists.", 
    "51": "The effects of trifluoperazine and haloperidol on protective activity of phenazepam were studied during seizures in mice treated with pentylenetetrazole (an index used for the appraisal of tranquilizing activity) as was their action on the phenazepam-induced depression of the test potential in the recovery cycles of somatosensory primary response. Trifluoperazine administered in doses of 0.1-0.5 mg/kg potentiated anticonvulsant action of phenazepam but did not change its effects on the recovery cycles of primary response. Haloperidol also potentiated anticonvulsant action of phenazepam. However, the doses administered were 4-5-fold lower than the tranquilizing doses of haloperidol. The drug also increased the depression of the test potential in the somatosensory recovery cycle, caused by phenazepam. This suggests an increment of GABA-positive effect of the tranquilizer. It appears that higher activity of haloperidol in elevating anticonvulsant and, probably, anxiolytic effects of phenazepam is determined by interaction of these drugs on the level of cortical GABA-ergic receptors.", 
    "52": "The venous complications associated with the administration of two preparations of diazepam, an aqueous (Valium) or a lipid (Diazemuls) preparation were investigated in 100 patients before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a double-blind randomized study. No differences in pain during injection or subsequent thrombophlebitis were found when a large vein was used for the injections. In a retrospective study of 78 patients who had received either preparation in a vein on the dorsum of the hand, the frequency of thrombophlebitis was significantly less with the lipid preparation. Both preparations provided effective sedation for endoscopy.", 
    "53": "Derivation of quantitative structure-activity relationships between pharmacological potencies and the electronic structure of molecules may often result in chance correlations, because of the large number of quantum chemical indices. Interrelationships between the parameters complicate the interpretation of the results. Quantum chemical indices of benzylamines, tetracyclines, and 1,4-benzodiazepines were transformed into mutually independent components using principal component analysis. The number of essential components was 3, 4, and 3, respectively. The computational efforts needed to develop multivariate linear regression equations between these components and the pharmacological activities were reduced, since the regression coefficients were not affected by the inclusion of new parameters. In each example, the first component, which accounted for the highest part of the total sample variance in the electronic structure, was the most important one in determining pharmacological activity. It seems that besides the electrostatic forces, charge transfer also affected the inhibitory potencies of benzylamines.", 
    "54": "Multiple doses of phenytoin, carbamazepine, and clonazepam were tested against single- and double-pulse evoked potentials. Evoked responses were triggered from either the amygdala or the cortex and were recorded in both monosynaptic sites and the mesencephalic reticular formation (MRF). In accordance with previous studies of spinal potentials, it was expected that all three drugs would display a depressant action. Contrary to expectation, only clonazepam had any significant effect, and this drug was effective only against potentials triggered in the amygdala and recorded in the MRF. These data appear inconsistent with the traditional belief that anticonvulsants block seizure spread by antagonizing transmission in neural pathways.", 
    "55": "We studied five male nonobese patients (mean age, 61 years) who had moderate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Each patient underwent three successive nights of systematic monitoring of sleep variables. On nights 2 and 3, patients received placebo and flurazepam (30 mg). Patients were also given flurazepam (15 mg) for seven consecutive nights and underwent sleep monitoring on nights 1 and 7. Two patients exhibited oxygen desaturation during rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, both spontaneously and after administration of flurazepam. The three other patients had no nocturnal oxygen desaturation, either spontaneously or after ingestion of flurazepam. We concluded that sleep-induced respiratory abnormalities are not systematically worsened by flurazepam. Flurazepam (15 mg) had no effect on the sleep disturbances of our patients with COPD after seven nights of administration.", 
    "56": "The effect of cimetidine on hepatic clearance of the benzodiazepine derivative nitrazepam was evaluated in healthy subjects. Six received a single 5- or 10-mg oral nitrazepam dose in the drug-free state and again with therapeutic cimetidine doses. Nitrazepam kinetics were determined from multiple serum concentrations measured during the 72 hr after each dose. Cimetidine had no effect on nitrazepam absorption kinetics, since peak serum nitrazepam concentration and time of peak concentration were not altered. Cimetidine did not alter nitrazepam volume of distribution, but cimetidine consistently reduced nitrazepam clearance, from a mean of 1.41 ml/min/kg in the control state to 1.17 ml/min/kg during cimetidine treatment. This resulted in prolongation of nitrazepam elimination t1/2 from 22.2 to 27.8 hr. Thus the ability of cimetidine to impair drug oxidation in man extends to the capacity for clearance of nitrazepam, a compound biotransformed mainly by nitroreduction.", 
    "57": "The importance of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal is not known. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 41 patients in alcohol withdrawal in an emergency department. The patients received either supportive care (10 min of standardized assessments, reassurance, reality orientation, and nursing care an hour) with three doses of sublingual lorazepam 2 mg every 2 hr (21 patients, drug group) or supportive care with three doses of sublingual placebo every 2 hr (20 patients, no-drug group). Immediately before each drug dose, the clinical course of alcohol withdrawal was assessed hourly by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-A). Interraters reliability in using CIWA-A was high. After each assessment, supportive care was given for 10 min before each dose. After completion of a 7-hr initial phase, patients were discharged and reassessed daily for 5 days. Thirty-seven patients (90.2%) improved in the initial phase. Treatment failures (CIWA-A greater than 10) were more common in the patients treated without drug (3/20, 15%) than in those treated with drug (1/21, 4.8%). Overall variations in intergroup CIWA-A scores during the initial phase were not significant. The rate of improvement of CIWA-A scores over the first 2 hr after drug was slightly faster in patients receiving lorazepam than in the control group. CIWA-A scores were the same during follow-up. These results indicate that most outpatients in mild to moderate alcohol withdrawal without medical complications improve without drug therapy in the emergency department setting.", 
    "58": "The effects of administering moderately high doses of diazepam and pentobarbital sodium for five consecutive days to subjects with histories of sedative drug abuse were examined. The two drugs produced similar dose-related effects on psychomotor performance, daytime sleeping, and ratings of magnitude of drug effects. Diazepam, but not pentobarbital, produced dose-related decreases in staff ratings of subjects' mood and social interactions and increases in staff ratings of subjects' hostility, complaining, and unusual behavior. During the placebo washout periods that followed drug administration. diazepam, but not pentobarbital, was associated with carry-over effects. The diazepam-produced deterioration in mood and social behavior was a subtle effect observed in a population for which usual therapeutic indications were lacking and at higher than usual therapeutic doses. The syndrome may, however, occur with long-term diazepam use or misuse in therapeutic settings and, hence, warrants clinical awareness in monitoring the course of treatment.", 
    "59": "A total of 60 patients with endoscopically diagnosed duodenal ulcer were treated with pirenzepine or cimetidine for 8-10 weeks until endoscopic healing of the ulcer. After ulcer healing 20 random patients received 50 mg pirenzepine per os daily for 6 months, 20 received 400 mg cimetidine per os daily for 6 months, and the remaining 20 received topic antacids for 6 months whenever they complained of pyrosis and/or epigastric pain. Endoscopic checks were repeated after 6 months (or earlier, if clinical picture was consistent with relapsing ulcer). Relapsing duodenal ulcer or erosive duodenitis was observed in 5 patients treated with pirenzepine (25%), in 4 patients treated with cimetidine (20%), and in 13 patients treated with occasional antacids (65%). Differences were significant between the antacid-treated patients and each of the other two groups, but not significant between pirenzepine-treated and cimetidine-treated groups.", 
    "60": "The present study was conducted to develop, test, and apply a single exponential time-dependent volume of distribution function to describe the pharmacokinetics of compounds following instantaneous, zero-order and first order input. Simulations were used to show the applicability and flexibility of the equations. Experimental data from the literature were fitted using the equations developed in the present study. In addition, the results of these fitted curves were compared to the results of the original fitting procedures to compare and contrast the methods. In the present analysis, the change from an initial volume (V1) to the total volume (V T) is perceived as a simple exponential function. Therefore, a single exponential term to describe elimination and a single exponential term to describe the change from V1 to V T were used to describe the entire blood concentration profile. The results from present simulations and fitted data indicate that the transition from V1 to V T is a more continuous process than observed with classical methods and is consistent with results obtained from physiologic flow-limited models. This observation suggests that the present curve-fitting technique may be more akin to physiologic reality, in that it depicts the change from the initial volume of distribution to the total volume of distribution as a continuous exponential function which reflects the establishment of an equilibrium.", 
    "61": "In this comparative study in 102 female patients, midazolam or thiopentone was used as the sleep-inducing component in combination anaesthesia. During anaesthesia, three different analgesics: fentanyl, oxycodone and buprenorphine were tested. The sleep-inducing effect of midazolam was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone, but in other respects midazolam was a satisfactory inducing agent for general anaesthesia. Patients receiving midazolam and/or buprenorphine needed an additional dose of muscle relaxant less often than those receiving thiopentone and fentanyl or oxycodone. Buprenorphine produced a long postoperative analgesia lasting up to 10 hours, but these patients were also postoperatively drowsier, which gave a lower postanesthetic recovery score.", 
    "62": "Sodium hydroxybutyrate is recommended as an anesthetic drug for the main narcosis as possessing the antishock and antihypoxic effect on the basis of an experience with the surgical treatment of 146 patients with diffuse purulent peritonitis in extremely critical states which were estimated as a hypodynamic form of septic shock.", 
    "63": "Mice exhibited a marked suppression of motor activity when placed into the same environment in which they had previously received electric foot shocks. Apomorphine-HCl (0.1 - 10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent reduction of the conditioned suppression of activity, but did not increase activity in non-shocked mice. Diazepam (0.2, 1, and 5 mg/kg), meprobamate (25 and 50 mg/kg), and chlorpromazine-HCl (2 and 5 mg/kg) did not reduce conditioned suppression. Thus, the conditioned suppression caused by a quick conditioning technique does not produce similar results to those using the conditioned emotional response involving suppression of operant lever-pressing behavior.", 
    "64": "Effects of phenobarbital, phenytoin and diazepam on cephaloridine-induced spiking activity (focal seizure) and cefazolin-induced violent seizure appearing repeatedly in EEG and general behavior (repeated generalized seizure) were studied in rats with chronically implanted electrodes. Phenobarbital, phenytoin and diazepam showed remarkable inhibition on cephaloridine-induced focal seizure and the ED50 values were 4.52 mg/kg, 9.41 mg/kg and 0.86 mg/kg, respectively. Phenobarbital and diazepam also inhibited cefazolin-induced repeated generalized seizure. The ED50s to inhibit seizure pattern in EEG were 30.5 mg/kg and 3.4 mg/kg, respectively and the ED50 values to suppress seizure behavior were 49.0 mg/kg and 4.7 mg/kg. However, phenytoin did not suppress repeated generalized seizure even at 100 mg/kg. From these results, cephaloridine-induced focal seizure and cefazolin-induced generalized seizure are thought to be useful models for evaluating the inhibitory effect of test compounds on cortical seizure and status epilepticus, respectively.", 
    "65": "Previous studies have indicated that serotonin and acetylcholine stimulate palate shelf reorientation. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the palate and whether diazepam mimics GABA to inhibit shelf reorientation and cause cleft palate. First, it was shown that 10(-4) M GABA inhibits palate shelf reorientation in day 14.5 AJ embryos cultured for 2 hours. Anterior palate reorientation stimulated by 10(-5) M serotonin was decreased by GABA; 10(-5) M picrotoxin (GABA antagonist) stimulated anterior shelf reorientation and reversed the effect of GABA. Diazepam (10(-4) M) partially inhibited palate shelf reorientation and that stimulated by 10(-5) M serotonin. Diazepam (400 mg/kg) was administered to AJ mice at day 13.5 of gestation and embryos were cultured at day 14.5. The inhibition produced by diazepam was significantly reduced by 10(-5) M picrotoxin. The teratogenic effect of diazepam was compared with AJ and Swiss-Webster Vancouver (SWV) inbred strains. Diazepam produced greater clefting in SWV mice (57% net) than in the AJ (18% net) when compared to their water- and food-starved controls. The greater sensitivity of the SWV strain than the AJ strain to diazepam, as well as to GABA, was also observed in embryo culture. GABA (10(-5) M) markedly inhibited posterior palate reorientation and reversed the stimulation produced by bethanechol in SWV mice. The inhibitory effects of GABA on the posterior palate were partially reversed by picrotoxin. Furthermore, diazepam inhibited palate reorientation either when administered to the pregnant dam or added in embryo culture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
