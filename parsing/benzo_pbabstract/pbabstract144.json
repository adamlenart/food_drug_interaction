    "1": "A total of 365 HCV-negative IDU under age 30 years were recruited by street outreach and interviewed quarterly for a prospective cohort between January 2000 and February 2008. Participants were followed for a total of 638 person-years and 1996 visits. We used survival analysis techniques to identify correlates of injection cessation (> or =3 months) and relapse to injection.", 
    "2": "67% of subjects were male, median age was 22 years (interquartile range (IQR) 20-26) and median years injecting was 3.6 (IQR 1.3-6.5). 28.8% ceased injecting during the follow-up period. Among those that ceased injecting, nearly one-half resumed drug injection on subsequent visits, one-quarter maintained injecting cessation, and one-quarter were lost to follow-up. Participating in a drug treatment program in the last 3 months and injecting less than 30 times per month were associated with injection cessation. Injecting heroin or heroin mixed with other drugs, injecting the residue from previously used drug preparation equipment, drinking alcohol, and using benzodiazepines were negatively associated with cessation. Younger age was associated with relapse to injection.", 
    "3": "These results suggest that factors associated with stopping injecting involve multiple areas of intervention, including access to drug treatment and behavioral approaches to reduce injection and sustain cessation. The higher incidence of relapse in the younger subjects in this cohort underscores the need for earlier detection and treatment programs targeted to adolescents and transition-age youth.",

    "5": "The prescription of antipsychotic medication in 301 consecutively admitted patients with first-episode psychosis from four catchment areas is described. For the first year of inclusion a first-generation antipsychotic in low dose was recommended as the first medication. From the second year a second-generation antipsychotic was recommended as first choice. Switching was allowed when any drug was judged to be ineffective or to have serious side-effects. Switching during the first 2 years after inclusion is described.", 
    "6": "Switching from a low-dose first-generation antipsychotic was more frequent than from a second-generation antipsychotic (90.7 vs. 58.4%). Lack of therapeutic effect and side-effects were the more frequently recorded reasons for changing in the first-generation group. Akathisia, parkinsonism, dyskinesias, dystonia and dysphoria were more often reported in patients on first-generation drugs. Weight gain and sedation were more often reported in patients on second-generation drugs.",

    "8": "The aim of this paper is to assess the substance pregabaline's potential for abuse. Little information is available on the subject and that retrieved is in part conflicting. Pregabaline is likely to be abused for its positive psychological effects, e.g. euphoria. However, these effects are weak and not sustained during long-term use. Pregabaline is therefore likely to have a lower potential for abuse than benzodiazepines. In clinical studies, symptoms suggestive of physical dependence (e.g. insomnia, nausea, headache, diarrhoea) have been observed in some patients after abrupt discontinuation of pregabaline. However, available documentation indicates that pregabaline is associated with less physical and psychological dependence than benzodiazepines.", 
    "9": "The rat conditioned avoidance response model is a well-established preclinical behavioral model predictive of antipsychotic efficacy. All clinically approved antipsychotic drugs disrupt conditioned avoidance responding - a feature that distinguishes them from other psychotherapeutics. We previously showed that the typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol disrupts avoidance responding by progressively attenuating the motivational salience of the conditioned stimulus (CS) in normal rats. In this study, using two pharmacological rat models of schizophrenia [e.g. phencyclidine (PCP) or amphetamine sensitization], we examined whether atypicals such as olanzapine or risperidone disrupt avoidance responding through the same behavioral mechanism. Rats were first pretreated with PCP, amphetamine, or saline under one of two different injection schedules for either 1 or 3 weeks. They were then trained to acquire avoidance responding to two types of CS (CS1 and CS2) that differed in their ability to predict the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. Finally, rats were tested repeatedly under olanzapine (1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) or risperidone (0.33 mg/kg, subcutaneously) daily for 5 or 7 consecutive days. We found that repeated olanzapine or risperidone treatment produced a progressive across-session decline in avoidance responding to both CS1 and CS2. Olanzapine and risperidone disrupted the CS2 (a less salient CS) avoidance to a greater extent than the CS1 avoidance. Pretreatment with PCP and amphetamine did not affect the disruptive effect of olanzapine or risperidone on avoidance responding. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that the atypical drugs olanzapine and risperidone, like the typical drug haloperidol, also disrupt avoidance responding primarily by attenuating the motivational salience of the CS.", 
    "10": "Despite the knowledge that gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) modulators can affect learning and memory, their capacity for disrupting each of these complex processes is rarely compared, and often mistakenly assumed to occur with identical potency. For these reasons, the effects of flunitrazepam (0.056-3.2 mg/kg), ethanol (0.25-1.5 g/kg), and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE; 1-17.8 mg/kg) were compared in groups of rats responding under baselines that assessed learning and memory separately. The first baseline was a multiple schedule of repeated acquisition and performance of tandem response sequences, whereas the second baseline was a retention or memory procedure where a tandem response sequence was acquired and then retested after a 30-min delay. Under both procedures, responding was maintained under a second-order fixed-ratio-2 schedule of food reinforcement, and incorrect responding (errors) produced a 5-s timeout. With regard to the effects of the three drugs on sequence acquisition (learning), all three drugs dose dependently decreased the overall response rate and increased the percentage of errors. Both flunitrazepam and beta-CCE affected accuracy more potently than response rate, whereas ethanol was equipotent in affecting these two dependent measures. With regard to the effects of these drugs on sequence retention (memory), both flunitrazepam and ethanol dose dependently decreased retention at doses that had little or no effect on sequence acquisition under the multiple schedule, whereas beta-CCE decreased retention and sequence acquisition similarly at the doses tested. Together, these data show that drugs with differing capacities for altering the function of gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors differ in their capacity for disrupting the acquisition and retention of response sequences and that positive modulation of this receptor complex may be more predictive of disruptions in memory than disruptions in learning.", 
    "11": "To estimate the cost effectiveness of olanzapine and risperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia in Belgium. Data were retrieved from a prospective, observational, non-randomized, follow-up survey. Clinical investigators assigned 265 patients with schizophrenia to either olanzapine (n = 136) or risperidone (n = 129). Patients were followed up for 2 years. Total healthcare costs were determined from the public payer perspective and calculated by multiplying resource use with official tariffs; effectiveness of the drugs was measured with the EQ-5D. This study uses a net-benefit regression approach to accommodate for baseline differences between treatment groups and uncertainty. Total 2-year costs were very similar for patients receiving risperidone and olanzapine (euro20 915.33 and euro20 569.69, respectively; p = 0.925) [year 2002 values]. The health condition of the patients receiving risperidone was better than that of patients receiving olanzapine but not significantly so (1.46 and 1.41, respectively; p = 0.191). Simple ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions indicated that, for lambda = euro40 000, we could not reject the null hypothesis that the drugs provide similar net monetary benefits to the patient (risperidone vs olanzapine euro2046.95; p = 0.656). When we controlled for several patient characteristics, risperidone moved further away from olanzapine but the difference did not reach statistical significance (risperidone vs olanzapine euro3198.07; p = 0.595). Numerous sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. Results of this study suggest that it is important to control for baseline patient characteristics when performing a cost-effectiveness analysis. No significant difference in net monetary benefit was found between risperidone and olanzapine.",

We report the case of a primipara who, after undergoing normal labor and delivery of a normal-weight baby, developed pneumomediastinum and extensive subcutaneous emphysema with significant symptoms within minutes of delivery. This peripartum complication is usually self-limiting when the aggravating factors are no louguer present.

A cross-sectional review of psychotropic prescriptions in 948 outpatients with mood disorders (405 male; mean +/- SD age, 52 +/- 17 years; age range, 16- 91 years) was conducted in Japan. The use of benzodiazepine-derivative anxiolytics was approximately 60% in all decades, including older patients, without a group difference. The frequent use of benzodiazepines is a cause for concern because they are not preferred treatment, given their well-known adverse effects especially in the elderly.",

Brain penetration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) may be affected by BBB damage. We studied the effects of BBB damage on brain distribution of hydrophilic [deoxy-glucose (DOG) and sucrose] and lipophilic (phenytoin and diazepam) molecules. We tested the hypothesis that lipophilic and hydrophilic drug distribution is differentially affected by BBB damage.", 
    "20": "In vivo BBB disruption (BBBD) was performed in rats by intracarotid injection of hyperosmotic mannitol. Drugs (H3-sucrose, 3H-deoxy-glucose, 14C-phenytoin, and C14-diazepam) or unlabeled phenytoin was measured and correlated to brain water content and protein extravasation. In vitro hippocampal slices were exposed to different osmolarities; drug penetration and water content were assessed by analytic and densitometric methods, respectively.", 
    "21": "BBBD resulted in extravasation of serum protein and radiolabeled drugs, but was associated with no significant change in brain water. Large shifts in water content in brain slices in vitro caused a small effect on drug penetration. In both cases, total drug permeability increase was greater for lipophilic than hydrophilic compounds. BBBD reduced the amount of free phenytoin in the brain.", 
    "22": "After BBBD, drug binding to protein is the main controller of total brain drug accumulation. Osmotic BBBD increased serum protein extravasation and reduced free phenytoin brain levels. These results underlie the importance of brain environment and BBB integrity in determining drug distribution to the brain. If confirmed in drug-resistant models, these mechanisms could contribute to drug brain distribution in refractory epilepsies.",

The analytes were separated employing a LC-18 DB column (250 mm x 4.6 mm, 5 microm) at 35 degrees C under isocratic conditions using 5mM KH(2)PO(4) buffer solution pH 6.0:methanol:diethyl ether (55:40:5, v/v/v) as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min(-1). UV detection was carried out at 245 nm. Employing LLE, the best conditions were achieved with double extraction of 0.5 mL plasma using ethyl acetate and Na(2)HPO(4) pH 9.5 for pH adjusting. Employing SPE, the best conditions were achieved with 0.5 mL plasma plus 3 mL 0.1M borate buffer pH 9.5, which were then passed through a C18 cartridge previously conditioned, washed for 3 times with these solvents: 3 mL 0.1M borate buffer pH 9.5, 4 mL Milli-Q water and 1 mL acetonitrile 5%, finally the BZPs elution was carried with diethyl ether:n-hexane:methanol (50:30:20). In both methods the solvent was evaporated at 40 degrees C under nitrogen flow. The validation parameters obtained in LLE were linearity range of 50-1200 ng mL(-1) plasma (r>or=0.9927), limits of quantification of 50 ng mL(-1) plasma, within-day and between-day CV% and E% for precision and accuracy lower than 15%, and recovery above 65% for all BZPs.

These extracting procedures followed by HPLC analysis showed their suitable applicability in order to examine one or more BZPs in human plasma. Moreover, it could be suggested that these procedures might be employed in various analytical applications, in special for toxicological/forensic analysis.",

Therefore, patients undergoing diagnostic and therapeutic procedures with the use of sedating agents are monitored by discontinuous non-invasive BP measurement (NIBP). Continuous non-invasive BP monitoring based on vascular unloading technique (CNAP, CN Systems, Graz) may improve patient safety in those settings. We investigated if this new technique improved monitoring of patients undergoing interventional endoscopy.", 
    "30": "40 patients undergoing interventional endoscopy between April and December 2007 were prospectively studied with CNAP(R) in addition to standard monitoring (NIBP, ECG and oxygen saturation).

The study consisted of 4-week baseline, 3-week titration, and 4-week maintenance periods, followed by a 3-week taper or continuation in an open-label study. Seizure frequency was recorded in a diary by the parent/caregiver throughout the study.", 
    "35": "Weekly drop seizure rates were significantly reduced from baseline in both the high-dose and low-dose groups; the reduction was significantly greater in the high-dose group. A significantly greater proportion of patients in the high-dose group experienced reductions in drop seizures of >or=25%, >or=50%, and >or=75% compared to the low-dose group; more patients in the high-dose group experienced a 100% reduction, but the difference was not significant. Nondrop seizures were also reduced in a dose-dependent manner. In both investigator and parent/caregiver global evaluations, patients in the high-dose group showed significantly greater improvements in overall symptoms compared to low-dose CLB. Adverse events were generally mild or moderate, and were similar between dose groups. Five serious adverse events were reported in four patients, but in no case was CLB discontinued.",

    "37": "Six experiments studied the role of GABA-sub(A) receptor activation in expression of overexpectation of Pavlovian fear conditioning. After separate pairings of CSA and CSB with shock in Stage I, rats received pairings of the compound AB with shock in Stage II, producing overexpectation of fear. The expression of overexpectation was attenuated, in a dose-dependent manner, by the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist FG7142. FG7142 had no effect on responding to a CS paired with a low magnitude US or a CS subjected to associative blocking. These results suggest that the negative prediction error generated during overexpectation training may impose a mask on fear rather than erasing the original fear learning. They support claims that overexpectation shares features with extinction.",

Prior to drug exposure, the most frequent inquiries by HCP were on antibiotics (11.0%), anti-inflammatory drugs (6.0%), and antiemetics (5.1%). Inquiries concerning lactating women most frequently requested information on the drug classes of antidepressants (10.8%), antibiotics (9.1%), and anti-inflammatory drugs (7.8%). Depressive disorders were an indication of antidepressant, benzodiazepine and antipsychotic exposures reported to IMAGe. Associations were found between medication use and maternal age, previous pregnancies, trimester of pregnancy at the time of the call and lifestyle habits.",

    "43": "The stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) model is an anxiety model that uses the transient rise in body temperature in response to acute stress. Benzodiazepines produce anxiolytic as well as sedative side effects through nonselective binding to GABA(A) receptor subunits. The GABA(A) receptor alpha(1) subunit is associated with sedation, whereas the GABA(A) receptor alpha(2) and alpha(3) subunits are involved in anxiolytic effects.",

    "45": "Using telemetric monitoring of temperature and locomotor activity, we found that nonsubunit-selective GABA(A) receptor agonist diazepam as well as the alpha(3) subunit-selective receptor agonist TP003 dose-dependently attenuated SIH and locomotor responses. Administration of GABA(A) receptor alpha(1)-selective agonist zolpidem resulted in profound hypothermia and locomotor sedation. The GABA(A) receptor alpha(1)-selective antagonist betaCCt antagonized the hypothermia, but did not reverse the SIH response attenuation caused by diazepam and zolpidem. These results suggest an important regulating role for the alpha(1) subunit in thermoregulation and sedation. Ligands of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors such as alcohol and nonbenzodiazepine THIP attenuated the SIH response only at high doses.",

These fluoro substituted pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines have shown remarkable DNA-binding ability and most of them possess promising anticancer activity, having GI(50) values in micromolar to nanomolar concentration range. DNA thermal denaturation studies show that some of these compounds (14a-c and 15) increase the DeltaT(m) values in the range of 28.9-38 degrees C, and this is further confirmed by the restriction endonuclease studies. This study illustrates the importance of introducing fluoro substitution at the C2-position apart from the incorporation of a piperazine ring in between the alkyloxy linker for enhancement of the DNA-binding ability in comparison to DSB-120 and SJG-136 (DeltaT(m)=10.2 and 25.7 degrees C). Moreover, the variations in the DNA-binding ability with respect to fluoro substitution in this class of dimers has been investigated by molecular modeling studies. Some representative C2-fluoro substituted dimers (8a and 14a) have also exhibited significant anticancer activity in the 60 cancer cell line assay of the National Cancer Institute (NCI).", 
    "48": "Postmenopause is mainly characterized by a reduction of ovarian hormones, which is accompanied by a major incidence of physical disorders and mood swings. Clinical and experimental evidence suggest that phytoestrogens could be used to ameliorate these alterations associated with menopause. However, the phytoestrogen effects on anxiety in rats with long-term absence of ovarian hormones, is unknown. Consequently, in the present study the authors compared the anxiolytic-like effect of phytoestrogen genistein (0.25, 0.5 y 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) in Wistar rats with 12-weeks postovariectomy in the black and white model and in the open field test, and it was compared with diazepam (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.). In the black and white model, genistein (0.5 y 1.0 mg/kg) and diazepam reduced the latency to enter and increased the time spent into the white compartment; also, significantly increased frequency and time spent in exploration toward white compartment was seen, as compared with the control group (p<0.05). In the open field test, genistein and diazepam increased grooming and rearing, without significant changes in locomotor activity, as compared with the control group. In conclusion, phytoestrogen genistein produces an anxiolytic-like effect in Wistar rats with long-term absence of ovarian hormones in the black and white model, supporting the hypotheses that phytoestrogens could be used to ameliorate anxiety associated with menopause.",

Outcome measures included behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and acoustic startle response (ASR) tests 30 days after initial exposure and freezing behavior upon exposure to a trauma-cue on day 31. One group was repeatedly exposed to the triggering trauma shortly before and after treatment and assessed as above. Circulating corticosterone levels were assessed 4 h after initiation of alprazolam and post-treatment.

    "51": "Immediate alprazolam treatment was effective in alleviating anxiety at day 4. No observable anxiolytic effects remained at day 30. Immediate alprazolam also resulted in significantly greater freezing response to trauma-cue exposure and in extreme responses to double-exposure. Corticosterone levels were significantly suppressed by alprazolam during treatment and rebounded after cessation.", 
    "52": "A brief course of alprazolam in the immediate aftermath of stress-exposure is associated with less favorable responses to additional stress-exposure later on. Alprazolam was associated with a significant attenuation of the HPA-response, suggesting a possible link between initial HPA-axis response disruption and the subsequent unfavorable outcomes.",

However, studies on impact of drug on body weight during fetal or neonatal development received little attention. The present study is the first-ever preclinical investigation demonstrating the effect of lactational exposure of olanzapine (4, 8, and 10 mg/kg) and risperidone (1 and 2 mg/kg), two widely prescribed antipsychotics, on body weight of mice neonates. Body weight gain was observed with both the drugs, although a sex-related differential response was noted. In olanzapine-exposed female neonates, the weight gain was more with the highest dose. Male neonates showed a reverse trend, i.e. the highest gain with the lowest dose. Female neonates exposed to risperidone also showed significant, but less gain as compared to their olanzapine-exposed counterparts. Risperidone-exposed male neonates showed little body weight gain. Waist-to-hip ratio and plasma prolactin level were measured to explain the reason behind the body weight gain, but there were deviations with respect to drug and sex. The body weight gain may be the overall manifestations of drug-induced endocrine and metabolic dysregulations.",

Patients with long-term benzodiazepine dependence who attended the Australian Medical Procedures Research Foundation (AMPRF, Perth, Australia) for treatment were recruited for these studies. Self-reported psychological and physical symptoms, as well as objective vital signs data were collected at intervals before, during and 2 weeks postinfusion. Study A is a case series with cardiovascular measures; study B is an open trial that tracks the psychological profiles of 13 subjects. Withdrawal symptoms were tracked, however, the nature and severity of these symptoms differed between patients. No major complications or discomfort prompting study dropout was observed. Significant benzodiazepine abstinence occurred with this flumazenil infusion method despite high levels of initial dependence, comorbid substance use and comorbid psychiatric illness. Low-dose flumazenil infusion appears to be a safe and effective treatment resulting in withdrawal symptoms of lesser severity than any other cessation method currently available. Recommendations for future research are discussed.",

We have studied the influence of a positive family history of psychotic disorders both on the variation of pHVA levels and on the relation between pHVA concentrations and the clinical response to treatment. Clinical status and pHVA levels were assessed in 58 medication free patients before and after 4 weeks of treatment with olanzapine and lithium. Clinical improvement correlated positively with pHVA levels on the 28th day of treatment only in the patients having first degree relatives with psychotic disorders. The pHVA levels did not decrease after 28 days of treatment. Our results reinforce the idea that a positive family history of psychosis in psychotic bipolar disorders may constitute a good basis for sub-grouping these patients.",

Lithium and lamotrigine were included as positive controls. Pretreatment with lithium attenuated AMPH/CDP-induced hyperactivity, without affecting the activity of AMPH- or CDP-alone, and thus confirmed some predictive validity for the test paradigm. Pretreatment with lamotrigine significantly attenuated AMPH/CDP-induced effects, but also reduced motility when tested in the presence of CDP-alone. Pretreatment with retigabine or ICA-27243 attenuated AMPH/CDP-induced hyperactivity without affecting basal locomotor activity. In contrast, pretreatment with BMS-204352 failed to decrease AMPH/CDP-induced hyperactivity at lower doses (3 and 10 mg/kg). At higher doses BMS-204352 attenuated hyperactivity induced by the AMPH/CDP mix, but only at doses decreasing basal locomotor activity (30 and 60 mg/kg). None of the K(v)7 openers tested significantly affected AMPH-induced hyperactivity. In contrast, retigabine and ICA-27243 were shown to induce significant reductions in motility when administered in combination with CDP-alone. In conclusion, the results with lithium confirm some predictive validity for the test paradigm. However, our data highlight an important confounder for interpreting a role for K(v)7 channels in the alleviation of manic-like symptoms when employing the AMPH/CDP hyperactivity model in mice. It is imperative that relevant control studies (AMPH- and CDP-alone) be incorporated and reported routinely to enable thorough interpretation of data generated by means of this behavioural test.",

    "101": "Recent studies from our laboratory indicate that psychological stress is a potent inducer of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, raising the possibility that the IL-10 family of cytokines may be key mediators of stress-induced immunosuppression. In this study we examined the impact of psychological stress (restraint stress) on expression of IL-10, and the novel IL-10 family members IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 in mouse spleen following an in vivo challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found that stressor exposure significantly augmented LPS-induced IL-10 expression. Similarly, IL-19 expression was induced by LPS, and this was significantly enhanced by restraint stress. In contrast, expression of IL-24 was not significantly altered by LPS or stress, and expression of IL-20 was largely not detectable in vivo in either saline or LPS-treated animals. Consistent with a role for sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activation in stress-induced immune regulation, the sympathetic neurotransmitter noradrenaline increased LPS-induced IL-10 and IL-19 expression in splenocytes and dendritic cells, and the ability of noradrenaline to induce expression of these cytokines was blocked by pre-treatment with the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Similarly, pre-treatment of mice with the peripherally acting beta-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol completely blocked the stress-induced increase in IL-10 and IL-19 mRNA expression. Finally, pre-treatment with the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide prevented the stress-induced increase in IL-10 and IL-19 expression. Taken together, these data demonstrate that psychological stress induces expression of the IL-10 and its homolog IL-19 via activation of beta-adrenoceptors, and the ability of stress to induce these cytokines is prevented by treatment with the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide. The findings suggest that stress enhances the production of immunosuppressive cytokines, which may impact on stress-related disease processes.",

    "111": "An innovative probabilistic rule is proposed to predict the clinical significance or clinical insignificance of DDI. This rule is coupled with a hierarchical Bayesian model approach to summarize substrate/inhibitor's PK models from multiple published resources. This approach incorporates between-subject and between-study variances into DDI prediction. Hence, it can predict both population-average and subject-specific AUCR. The clinically significant DDI, weak DDI, and clinically insignificant inhibitions are decided by the probabilities of predicted AUCR falling into three intervals, (-infinity, 1.25), (1.25, 2), and (2, infinity). The main advantage of this probabilistic rule to predict clinical significance of DDI over the deterministic rule is that the probabilistic rule considers the sample variability, and the decision is independent of sampling variation; while deterministic rule based decision will vary from sample to sample. The probabilistic rule proposed in this paper is best suited for the situation when in vivo PK studies and models are available for both the inhibitor and substrate. An early decision on clinically significant or clinically insignificant inhibition can avoid additional DDI studies. Ketoconazole and midazolam are used as an interaction pair to illustrate our idea. AUCR predictions incorporating between-subject variability always have greater variances than population-average AUCR predictions. A clinically insignificant AUCR at population-average level is not necessarily true when considering between-subject variability. Additional simulation studies suggest that predicted AUCRs highly depend on the interaction constant K(i) and dose combinations.",

    "127": "Hippocampal pyramidal neurons potentially express multiple subtypes of GABA(A) receptors at extrasynaptic locations that could therefore respond to different drugs. We activated extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors in cultured rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons and measured single-channel currents in order to compare the actions of two drugs that potentially target different GABA(A) receptor subtypes. Despite the possible difference in receptor targets of etomidate and diazepam, the two drugs were similar in their actions on native extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. Each drug produced three distinct responses that differed significantly in current magnitude, implying heterogeneous GABA(A) receptor populations. In the majority of patches, drug application increased both the single-channel conductance (>40 pS) and the open probability of the channels. By contrast, in the minority of patches, drug application caused an increase in open probability only. In the third group high-conductance channels were observed upon GABA activation and drug application increased their open probability only. The currents potentiated by etomidate or diazepam were substantially larger in patches displaying high-conductance GABA channels compared to those displaying only low-conductance channels. Factors contributing to the large magnitude of these currents were the long mean open time of high-conductance channels and the presence of multiple channels in these patches. In conclusion, we suggest that the local density of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors may influence their single-channel properties and may be an additional regulating factor for tonic inhibition and, importantly, differential drug modulation.",

    "129": "Typically, the dose-occupancy curves for GABA-A receptor ligands are determined using in vivo binding of [3H]flumazenil. This study describes in vivo binding experiments without the use of tracer ligands. Bound and free fractions were measured directly using a highly sensitive LC/MS/MS detection method after in vivo administration of the GABA-A ligands zolpidem, (RS)-zopiclone, L-838417 and flumazenil, to demonstrate affinity and saturation of the filter-retained, membrane-bound fraction. The in vivo binding of flumazenil and L-838417 both saturated around 200 nM, at a similar level to the specific binding of (S)-zopiclone after doses of the racemic zopiclone, using (R)-zopiclone to estimate non-specific binding. This saturable component represented an estimate of benzodiazepine binding sites available on GABA-A receptors in vivo (200 nM). Dose-occupancy curves were constructed to estimate the dose required to achieve 50% occupancy and matched estimates obtained with tracer methods. In contrast to tracer methods, this method is uniquely suitable to the demonstration of stereoselective binding of the (S)-isomer in vivo after doses of racemic zopiclone. These results demonstrate that the LC/MS/MS measurements of total drug concentrations typically used in early drug development can be adapted to provide information about receptor occupancy in vivo.", 
    "130": "Eye movements during stage 2, 3, and 4 sleep have been associated with the use of several selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications. This activity has been postulated to be a serotonin effect. The authors identified all cases of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) eye movements observed over a 36-month period in an accredited hospital-based sleep center and then correlated the findings with the patient's medications. The polysomnogram (PSG) studies of 2,959 consecutive adults were evaluated prospectively to identify all patients with atypical eye movements which occurred during NREM sleep. Standard recording, staging and arousal scoring methods were used. The use of antidepressants and neuroleptic medications was recorded for each patient. Eye movements in NREM sleep were detected in 94 PSGs. Of these, 73 patients (78%) were taking a SSRI at the time of the study, and 6 (6%) had taken a SSRI in the past. Thirty-six percent of patients (73 of 201) taking a SSRI had abnormal NREM eye movements on PSG. Other classes of antidepressants, neuroleptics, and benzodiazepines showed a much lower incidence of NREM eye movements. Mirtazapine was rarely related to NREM eye movements. Clonazepam and zolpidem were not associated with atypical eye movements unless used in combination with SSRI medications. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors was associated with atypical NREM eye movements, even when the medication had been discontinued months to years before the PSG. Atypical NREM eye movements appear to be related primarily to serotonin and less prominently to dopaminergic medication effects.",

After airway topical anesthesia, awake fiberoptic orotracheal intubation (FOI) was performed. Level of sedation, time for each lidocaine spray in different targeted areas, total times for airway sprays, total dosages of lidocaine used for airway sprays, intubation times, and number of intubation attempts were noted. An independent investigator scored patients' comfort during airway topical anesthesia, patients' reaction, coughing severity, and intubating condition during awake FOI, and observed changes of arterial blood pressure and heart rate during each stage in the airway manipulation process. Serial blood samples were obtained for analysis of plasma lidocaine concentrations.",

In this study, we report the incidence and blood concentrations of clonazepam and its metabolite 7-aminoclonazepam in cases referred to the Section of Forensic Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen in 2002-2007. Using LC-MS/MS, clonazepam was detected in 297 traffic cases, 92 criminal cases (perpetrators or victims of a crime) and in 140 postmortem cases. The concentration ranges of clonazepam+7-aminoclonazepam were 0.002-0.840 mg/kg (median 0.067) for traffic cases, 0.005-0.913 (median 0.071) for criminal cases (offenders), 0.002-0.720 (median 0.030) for criminal cases (victims) and 0.002-1.676 (median 0.115) for postmortem cases. The concentrations were thus similar among the groups, although the median value was highest in the postmortem group. In most cases, other drugs were also present. For the postmortem group, the cases (n=27) with relatively high (>0.2 mg/kg) clonazepam+7-aminoclonazepam values were examined in greater detail. Other drugs were present in all cases, with clonazepam judged to be the primary cause of death in five cases. The range of clonazepam+7-aminoclonazepam concentrations in these five cases ranged from 0.26 to 0.54 mg/kg (median 0.29 mg/kg).", 
    "136": "The present study examined the acute behavioral responses of pigeons to separation from conspecifics and exposure to an unfamiliar environment (UE). The effects of (1) repeated exposure to the UE; (2) visual isolation from surroundings, or saline injections; and (3) diazepam treatment (i.p., 0.25, 0.75, 2.5 or 7.5mg/kg) before the trial were also examined. UE exposure evoked intense ballistic head movements (peeping), gradually replaced with angular head movements (AHM), both associated with immobility of the trunk and legs. These behaviors failed to habituate after three trials (7-day intertrial intervals). Visual isolation from the surroundings and saline injection prior to exposure to the UE increased the AHM and reduced peeping. Doses of diazepam (0.25 and 0.75 mg/kg) that have demonstrated anti-conflict effects in other tests did not affect the behavioral responses to the UE. Diazepam at 2.5 and 7.5mg/kg doses consistently increased time spent in immobility. These data suggest that peeping, although expressed in potentially threatening or harmful situations appears not to be a fear-motivated behavior or, alternatively, this specific behavioral response is not diazepam sensitive.",

Pilocarpine is a cholinergic agonist that increases salivary flow rate and has been used to treat xerostomia. This study aimed to measure salivary flow rate of rats under chronic treatment with benzodiazepine (Diazepam), to analyze by histomorphometry the effects of the drug in the parotids glands and to verify the effect of the pilocarpine in glandular parenchyma and in the salivary flow rate. Seventy-two male Wistar rats were allocated to four groups. Control groups received saline during 60 days (C60) and pilocarpine (Pilo) during 60 days. Experimental groups were dealt with Diazepam associated with saline (DS), and Diazepam associated with pilocarpine (DP) during 60 days. The stimulated salivary flow rate was obtained by using the gravimetric method. After the animals were killed, parotid glands were removed and mass and size were determined. The specimens were processed and stereological analysis revealed cell volume. Mean values of size and salivary flow rate varied from 9.007 mm and 0.015 mg/min in DS to 7.854 mm and 0.029 mg/min in DP, respectively. ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between groups for size (p=0.0028) and salivary flow rate (p=0.0003). Psychotropic drugs caused hyposalivation in rats and acinar hypertrophy in their parotid glands. Pilocarpine, a cholinergic agonist with topical appliance, showed significant secretagogue action in the treatment of hyposalivation induced by Diazepam chronic use.", 
    "144": "Compounds that bind in the minor groove of DNA have found use in the experimental treatment of cancer and certain infectious diseases. Furthermore, agents which target and can recognize discrete sequences of DNA have the potential to offer selective therapies by modulating the activity of specific transcription factors or genes. For this reason, a number of sequence-selective DNA binding agents have been evaluated with a range of affinities and recognition fidelities. In this respect, the pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) are of interest as they bind to guanine residues in the minor groove with a preference for Pu-G-Pu sequences. A dramatic increase in cytotoxicity and sequence selectivity has been achieved by linking two PBD units to form PBD dimers as cross-linking agents on opposite DNA strands (e.g., interstrand cross-links). SJG-136 is currently undergoing Phase I evaluation in both the United States (through the NCI) and United Kingdom (through Cancer Research United Kingdom).

    "146": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric manifestation of acute and chronic liver failure. Ammonia plays a key role in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy by inducing astrocyte swelling and/or sensitizing astrocytes to swelling by a heterogeneous panel of precipitating factors and conditions. Whereas astrocyte swelling in acute liver failure contributes to a clinically overt brain edema, a low grade glial edema without clinically overt brain edema is observed in hepatic encephalopathy in liver cirrhosis. Astrocyte swelling produces reactive oxygen and nitrogen oxide species (ROS/RNOS), which again increase astrocyte swelling, thereby creating a self-amplifying signaling loop. Astroglial swelling and ROS/RNOS increase protein tyrosine nitration and may account for neurotoxic effects of ammonia and other precipitants of hepatic encephalopathy. Recently, RNA oxidation and an increase of free intracellular zinc ([Zn(2+)](i)) were identified as further consequences of astrocyte swelling and ROS/RNOS production. An elevation of [Zn(2+)](i) mediates mRNA expression of metallothionein and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) induced by hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling. Further, Zn(2+) mediates RNA oxidation in ammonia-treated astrocytes. In the brain of hyperammonemic rats oxidized RNA localizes in part to perivascular astrocyte processes and to postsynaptic dendritic spines. RNA oxidation may impair postsynaptic protein synthesis, which is critically involved in learning and memory consolidation. RNA oxidation offers a novel explanation for multiple disturbances of neurotransmitter systems and gene expression and the cognitive deficits observed in hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "147": "The antischistosomal activity of clonazepam, when administered alone or in association with oxamniquine and praziquantel, was experimentally evaluated in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. The animals were treated 45 days post-infection with a single dose, by oral route, according to three treatment schedules: clonazepam 25 mg/kg and sacrificed 15 min, 1h or 4 h after treatment; clonazepam 1.0, 2.5 or 10.0 mg/kg and sacrificed 15 days post-treatment or with the dose of 10 mg/kg in association with oxamniquine 50 mg/kg or praziquantel 200 mg/kg, single dose, orally, every schedule with a control group. The efficacy of the drugs in vivo was assessed by means of worm counts and their distribution in mesentery and liver, mortality and oogram changes. In the chemotherapeutic schedules used, clonazepam did not present antischistosomal activity and the result of the association of this drug with oxamniquine or praziquantel was not significantly different from the one obtained when these two last drugs were administered alone. In the in vitro experiments, the worms exposed to 0.6 mg/mL clonazepam remained motionless throughout the 8-day-period of observation, without egg-laying, whereas the worms of the control group showed normal movements, egg-laying and hatching of miracidia on the last day of observation. The results obtained in the present study confirm the action of clonazepam on S. mansoni adult worm, in vitro, causing total paralysis of males and females. However, no additive or synergistic effects were observed when clonazepam were used in association with oxamniquine or praziquantel.", 
    "148": "Our objective is to verify the modulatory effects of bromazepam on EEG theta absolute power when subjects were submitted to a visuomotor task (i.e., car driver task). Sample was composed of 14 students (9 males and 5 females), right handed, with ages varying between 23 and 42 years (mean=32.5+/-9.5), absence of mental or physical impairments, no psychoactive or psychotropic substance use and no neuromuscular disorders (screened by a clinical examination). The results showed an interaction between condition and electrodes (p=0.034) in favor of F8 electrode compared with F7 in both experimental conditions (t-test; p=0.001). Additionally, main effects were observed for condition (p=0.001), period (p=0.001) and electrodes (p=0.031) in favor of F4 electrode compared with F3. In conclusion, Br 6mg of bromazepam may interfere in sensorimotor processes in the task performance in an unpredictable scenario allowing that certain visuospatial factors were predominant. Therefore, the results may reflect that bromazepam effects influence the performance of the involved areas because of the acquisition and integration of sensory stimuli processes until the development of a motor behavior based on the same stimuli.", 
    "149": "For more than 50 years, Parkinson's disease (PD) has been conceptualized as a product of nigro-striatal dopamine (NSD) system degeneration. In spite of a growing body of evidence depicting the mammalian brain as an interrelated complexity of circuitous systems, dopamine (DA) deficiency of the NSD is still regarded as the main problem, with DA replacement being the purpose of therapeutic intervention. For at least 191 years circadian involvement in various aspects of PD, including depression and insomnia, has been recognized as an integral part of the symptom matrix of PD and yet attempts to elucidate the involvement of this system is uncharted territory. The present review attempts a major reorganization of mammalian brain into a coordinated complex involving the NSD and the retinal hypothalamic tract (RHT) as the primary systems involved in the retino-diencephalic/mesencephalic-pineal (RDMP) axis. Secondary systems including the lateral hypothalamus (LH), the area postraema (AP) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) also form an integral part of this system as they have been shown to be either intimately related to the primary systems of the RDMP axis or have been shown to be significantly involved in the expression and treatment of PD. A large volume of evidence suggests that the RDMP axis is activated during the course of PD and during therapeutic intervention. Four types of neurotoxicity associated with melatonin are identified and the susceptibility of various parts of the RDMP axis to undergo neuropathological change, the tendency for melatonin to induce PD-like behavioural toxicity, and the relationship of this to PD symptomotology are described. This includes adverse effects of melatonin on motor function, hypotension, the adjuvant use of benzodiazepines, depression, insomnia, body weight regulation and various biochemical effects of melatonin administration: all problems currently facing the proposal to introduce melatonin as an adjuvant. It is suggested further that traditional DA replacement may well work by exerting its effect upon the circadian system, rather than simply replacing deficient DA. Activation of the circadian function by antagonizing melatonin with bright light not only has therapeutic value in treating the primary symptoms of PD but it shares a common mechanism with L-dopa in reducing the occurrence of seborrheic dermatitis. Concepts at the centre of understanding pineal function in PD, including pineal calcification, melatonin deficiency, symptomatic versus protective features of melatonin and antioxidative effects, are explained in a counterintuitive context. Intriguing propositions including the role of the retina in the aetiology of PD and that the nigra functions as a retina in this disorder are presented with the intention to provide a new understanding of the underlying compromised function in PD and to provide new treatment strategies. For the first time, abundant evidence is presented describing PD as an endocrine disorder of melatonin hyperplasia. The role of circadian interventive therapies and internal desynchrony in the aetiology and progression of PD provides a new direction for understanding the underlying physiology of a disease which is currently in a state of impasse and provides new hope for those who suffer from its debilitating effects.",

Simultaneous injection of ultralow-dose antibodies to S-100 protein and GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen reduced the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of the drug, while GABA-B receptor antagonist faclofen stimulated the anxiolytic and reduced the antidepressant effect of ultralow-dose antibodies to S-100 protein. The effect of ultralow-dose antibodies to S-100 protein on the GABA-B-ergic system differs from that of benzodiazepine anxiolytics (diazepam) and tricyclic antidepressants (amitryptiline) not affecting this transmitter system.",

Associations between polymorphisms in 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptor coding genes, HTR2C and HTR2A, with antipsychotic-induced weight gain have been reported. The impact of HTR2C and HTR2A polymorphisms on body mass index (BMI), glucose-insulin homeostasis, and blood lipid levels was evaluated in 46 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and treated with olanzapine (n = 28) or clozapine (n = 18) for at least 6 months. Olanzapine-treated patients with HTR2C haplotype C (-759C, -697C, and 23Ser) had higher BMI (P = 0.029) and C peptide levels (P = 0.029) compared with patients with haplotype B (-759T, -697C, and 23Cys).

Patients carrying the HTR2A haplotype 2 (-1438A, 102T, and 452His) had significantly higher C peptide levels compared with haplotype 3 (-1438A, 102T, and 452Tyr) carriers in the olanzapine group (P = 0.034) and in the overall study population (P = 0.019). None of the haplotypes were associated with serum levels of insulin, triglycerides, and cholesterol or with homeostasis model assessment index for insulin resistance. In conclusion, both HTR2C and HTR2A gene polymorphisms seem to be associated with the occurrence of metabolic abnormalities in patients treated with olanzapine or clozapine.", 
    "160": "Rats were subjected to one or two cycles of fear conditioning and extinction, injected with a benzodiazepine, midazolam, before the first or second extinction, and tested for long-term inhibition of fear responses (freezing). In Experiment 1, inhibition of context-conditioned fear was spared when midazolam was injected before the second extinction, but impaired when injected before the first. In Experiment 2, it was spared when midazolam was injected before the second extinction, but only if vehicle had been injected before the first: Inhibition was impaired when the drug was injected before both. In Experiment 3, inhibition of a discrete conditioned stimulus (CS A) was spared when midazolam was injected before its second extinction, but impaired when injected before extinction of CS A in rats that had undergone extinction of CS B. In Experiment 4, inhibition was spared when midazolam was injected into the basolateral amygdala before the second extinction, but impaired when injected before the first extinction of context-conditioned fear. The results show that midazolam impairs learning, but not relearning to inhibit fear responses, and are discussed in terms of state dependency, error correction, and memory retrieval, whereby the drug's anxiolytic effects on the second extinction reactivate and strengthen the original inhibitory memory.",

However, even when treated with this class of drugs, response rates rarely exceed 60% and less than 20-30% of the patients achieve full remission. The aim of this study was to address this limitation by systematically reviewing the options left for the treatment of PTSD when patients do not respond satisfactorily to or tolerate SSRIs. A systematic review covering all original articles, letters and brief reports published in any language until October 2008 was conducted through searches in the ISI/Web of Science, PubMed and PILOTS databases. The search terms included the pharmacological class of each agent or its generic name plus \"PTSD\" or \"stress disorder\" in the title, in the abstract or as a keyword. Sixty-three articles were selected, covering the following categories: antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, adrenergic-inhibiting agents, opioid antagonists, benzodiazepines and other agents. None of the identified agents reached the level A of scientific evidence, 5 reached level B, 7 level C and 13 level D. The non-antidepressant agent with the strongest scientific evidence supporting its use in PTSD is risperidone, which can be envisaged as an effective add-on therapy when patients did not fully benefit from previous treatment with SSRIs. Prazosin, an adrenergic-inhibiting agent, is a promising alternative for cases of PTSD where nightmares and insomnia are prominent symptoms. So far, there is no consistent empirical support for using benzodiazepines in the prevention or in the treatment of PTSD, although these drugs could alleviate some associated non-specific symptoms, such as insomnia or anxiety. Further controlled clinical trials and meta-analysis are needed to guide clinicians in their search of effective pharmacological alternatives to antidepressants in PTSD.", 
    "162": "Pharmacotherapy with benzodiazepines is compromised by rapid sedative tolerance and diverse withdrawal symptoms. To assess the role of AMPA-type glutamate receptor GluR-A subunits in neuroadaptation to subchronic benzodiazepine treatment, GluR-A subunit-deficient mice were rendered tolerant by a high-dose seven-day flurazepam treatment (40 mg/kg, s.c., twice a day for 4 days, 60 mg/kg twice a day for 3 days). The acute effects to flurazepam were not changed in the GluR-/- mice compared with their littermate control mice. GluR-A-/- mice developed less tolerance than their controls as demonstrated in behavioral tests for muscle relaxation and sensory functions. Actually, the knockout mice exhibited slower recovery than their littermates from impaired gait and pelvic position after an acute 40 mg/kg dose of flurazepam. The apparent elimination of flurazepam was similarly increased in the knockout and control mice as assessed by blood and brain concentrations 2 h after acute and chronic treatments, but the active metabolite desalkylflurazepam cumulated similarly in both mouse lines. Withdrawal symptoms, precipitated by flumazenil (20 mg/kg, s.c.) 48 h after discontinuation of the flurazepam treatment, were enhanced in the GluR-A-/- mice. The results stress the importance of the AMPA-receptor system in neuroadaptation to acute and chronic effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "163": "Investigations with the use of the Calgary Depression scale for schizophrenia and standardized psychometric scales revealed depression in the acute psychotic phase of the disease in 198 patients and depressive syndrome in 148 ones in the postpsychotic phase. The phase of schizophrenia (acute or postpsychotic) influenced the choice of antidepressive therapy. Depressive syndrome during the acute phase of schizophrenia was the integral part of a psychotic episode. Manifestations of depressive symptoms correlated with the severity of positive symptoms. Depression was responsive to antipsychotic monotherapy using conventional and unconventional agents. Depression with adynamic symptoms was especially frequent in the postpsychotic phase of schizophrenia. Depressions usually developed after the first episode of schizophrenia. Those observed immediately after a psychotic episode differed from depressions following prolonged therapy. The structure of depressive syndrome was influenced by the number of previous psychotic episodes The combination of antipsychotics and antidepressants was effective in the treatment of depressive symptoms in schizophrenic patients during the postpsychotic phase. The presence of depression in case of proper therapy is not a predictor of poor prognosis. Recognition and adequate treatment of depression in schizophrenia require greater attention. Optimized control of mood disorders accompanying schizophrenia increases the possibility to improve the clinical outcome.",

    "168": "There is considerable evidence that schizophrenia is associated with immune system dysregulation. For example, blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of proinflammatory cytokines are significantly increased in schizophrenic patients, and their normalization correlates with improvement in psychotic symptoms. In fact, typical and atypical antipsychotics are reported to modulate immune function in in vitro and in vivo studies. In the present study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of antipsychotics, clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and haloperidol, on serum cytokine levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice. Atypical antipsychotics, such as clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone, but not haloperidol, suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6, and up-regulated IL-10. Moreover, only clozapine, robustly increased the serum levels of IL-10. Clozapine reproduced its anti-inflammatory feature in polyinsinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt (Poly[I:C])-induced inflammation. Thus, the anti-inflammatory effect of clozapine would adapt to inflammation induced by some varieties of antigens. Several receptor ligands, such as 8-OH-DPAT, ketanserin, prazosin and scopolamine, were also examined as to their anti-inflammatory effects on serum cytokine levels in LPS-treated mice. Ketanserin and prazosin, but not 8-OH-DPAT nor scopolamine, behaved similarly to atypical antipsychotics. However, the remarkable increase of serum IL-10 level observed in clozapine was not detected in ketanserin and prazosin. These results suggest the unique efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the suppression of proinflammatory cytokines, and the increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10.",

    "171": "There was a high rate of recognition of all disorders amongst the 436 respondents. GPs demonstrated a high level of consistency about screening questionnaires, investigations and specialist referral in the dementia vignette. In contrast, less than half of GPs endorsed using a screening questionnaire or neuroimaging, and considered referral to a variety of medical specialties in the depression vignette. For both the depression and dementia vignettes, self-help treatments like walking, dietary advice or alcohol reduction were endorsed more frequently than an antidepressant or cholinesterase inhibitor respectively. Dementia tended to be viewed as having a poor prognosis, and late-life depression a moderate prognosis.", 
    "172": "Actual or intended rates of diagnostic recognition, specialist referral and benzodiazepine prescription found in this study may not translate into clinical practice for a number of reasons. Non-specific treatments without a clear evidence base were considered as often as those with a stronger evidence base.

Most women had difficulties in describing the quality of the genital sensations. These were described in various terms and were diagnosed as dysesthesias and paresthesias. Their intensity was most severe during sitting. A few women reported PGAD during pregnancy and premenstrual. The majority of women also reported preexistent or coexistent restless legs syndrome (RLS) and overactive bladder syndrome (OBS). These strongly associated morbidities point into the direction of a clinical cluster, which harbors PGAD or PGAD plus these typical other disorders. Notably, as in RLS and OBS, it appeared that daily treatment with clonazepam 0.5-1.5 mg was effective in 56% of PGAD women. Also, oxazepam 10 mg and tramadol 50 mg elicited PGAD-reducing effect.", 
    "178": "PGAD seems to belong to a highly associated disease cluster including morbidities, which share an imperative urge to suppress dysesthesias and paresthesias by firm manipulative actions. PGAD--or as proposed by our group, restless genital syndrome (RGS) in the context of its strong association with restless legs--is probably the expression of a nonsexually driven hyperexcitability of the genitals and subsequent attempts to overcome it by genital manipulations.",

Fluorine is available in the flumazenil molecule and [(18)F]flumazenil has recently been prepared. The aim of the present PET-study in 8 male subjects was to examine the binding of [(18)F]flumazenil in the human brain by direct comparison with [(11)C]flumazenil. Each subject participated in two 93-minute PET-measurements with [(11)C]flumazenil and [(18)F]flumazenil, respectively. Data were analyzed using compartment models with metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input and reference tissue models using the pons as reference region. There was no evident difference between the kinetic behaviors of the two ligands. Overall, the noise in the time activity curves for [(18)F]flumazenil was lower at late time points, and the variance of the kinetic parameters was lower than for [(11)C]flumazenil. In BZ receptor rich regions, such as the neocortex, the 3-compartment model was statistically favored, whereas the 2-compartment model was favored in the pons. Binding potential values obtained by the reference tissue models were in good agreement with those obtained by the kinetic analysis. There was no support for the presence of specific binding in the pons. In conclusion, the binding and the kinetic behavior of [(11)C]flumazenil and [(18)F]flumazenil were similar. The present analysis supports the use of pons as reference region in simplified protocols without arterial blood sampling. [(18)F]flumazenil should thus be an excellent choice for applied studies at centers not having a cyclotron.",

The ictal EEG showed that high-amplitude spikes followed by a slow wave over the contralateral motor areas. This was further confirmed by time-locked silent EMG in 9 patients. During ENM occurrence or recurrence, the habitual seizures and interictal discharges were exaggerated. Atypical absence seizures also occurred in 6 patients. The alteration of therapeutic options of AED relating to ENM appearance in some patients included the add-on therapy with carbamazepine (CBZ), oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, or withdrawal of valproate (VPA). ENM was controlled in most cases by using VPA, clonazepam (CZP) and corticosteroid with different combination.",
