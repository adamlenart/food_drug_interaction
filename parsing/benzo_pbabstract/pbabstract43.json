Previous studies have reported symptomatic improvements that correlate with changes in cortical network activity following GABAA receptor modulation. In this study we have used whole-head magnetoencephalography to characterize neuronal network activity, at rest and during visually cued finger abductions, in unilaterally symptomatic PD and age-matched control participants. Recordings were then repeated following administration of sub-sedative doses of the hypnotic drug zolpidem (0.05mg/kg), which binds to the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. A beamforming based 'virtual electrode' approach was used to reconstruct oscillatory power in the primary motor cortex (M1), contralateral and ipsilateral to symptom presentation in PD patients or dominant hand in control participants. In PD patients, contralateral M1 showed significantly greater beta power than ipsilateral M1. Following zolpidem administration contralateral beta power was significantly reduced while ipsilateral beta power was significantly increased resulting in a hemispheric power ratio that approached parity. Furthermore, there was highly significant correlation between hemispheric beta power ratio and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The changes in contralateral and ipsilateral beta power were reflected in pre-movement beta desynchronization and the late post-movement beta rebound. However, the absolute level of movement-related beta desynchronization was not altered. These results show that low-dose zolpidem not only reduces contralateral beta but also increases ipsilateral beta, while rebalancing the dynamic range of M1 network oscillations between the two hemispheres. These changes appear to underlie the symptomatic improvements afforded by low-dose zolpidem.",

SE may be classified into convulsive and nonconvulsive, based on the presence of rhythmic jerking of the extremities. Refractory status epilepticus is defined as ongoing seizures failing to respond to first- and second-line anticonvulsant drug therapy and carries a high morbidity and mortality. Treatment efficacy, morbidity, and mortality are directly related to delays in starting therapy. Benzodiazepines are first-line therapy, usually followed by phenytoin/fosphenytoin. A low threshold should exist for obtaining an urgent electroencephalogram.",

Structurally complex spirobenzodiazepine oxindoles with one quaternary stereogenic center are obtained in high yield with excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99% yield, enantiomeric ratio>99.5:0.5). This approach takes advantage of organocatalytic asymmetric tandem reactions to efficiently construct the structurally rigid spirobenzodiazepine oxindole architecture with high enantiopurity in a single transformation, which involves a cascade enamine-imine formation/intramolecular Mannich reaction sequence.", 
    "3": "Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is an uncommon disease characterized by bronchial asthma, eosinophilia and systemic vasculitis. Many patients with CSS are suffering from cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders and/or renal disorders which are associated with systemic vasculitis. Cardiac diseases are considered as the main cause of the death in patients with CSS. Steroid administration is the standard pharmacological therapy for CSS. There are very few clinical reports concerning anesthetic management for the patients with CSS. We suppose that precise perioperative managements are required for the patients with CSS, including the appropriate control of bronchial asthma and the careful treatments of disorders in cardiovascular system, neurological system and/or kidney. In addition, we believe that the steroid cover should be considered during the perioperative period of the patients with CSS. Here, we describe an anesthetic management of a 28-year-old man with CSS undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. General anesthesia was induced with midazolam and fentanyl. Rocuronium was administered to facilitate tracheal intubation. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane and remifentanil. Prior to the surgery, 100 mg of hydrocortisone was administered for the steroid cover. The surgery was uneventful. The patient emerged from general anesthesia smoothly, and was extubated safely.",

    "5": "In this study, the extent of sleep medication use and abuse among drivers apprehended on suspicion of DUID was assessed. Additionally, the prevalence and concentrations of the drugs, concomitant use of other drugs of abuse, and the age and sex of the drivers positive for the most commonly prescribed sedative-hypnotics (temazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, zopiclone, and zolpidem) in DUID cases in Finland in 2009 to 2011 were examined.", 
    "6": "Sedative-hypnotics were found in 3155 samples of the 13,248 that were analyzed. Temazepam was present in over half of the cases (57.9%), along with other benzodiazepines such as midazolam (13.1%) and nitrazepam (7.0%) and the non-benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone (12.2%) and zolpidem (9.8%). The mean age of the drivers using the studied sedative-hypnotics was 33.5 years. Many of the drivers were polydrug users; concomitant stimulant use was found in nearly half of the cases. Cannabis and alcohol were also very common co-findings. In nearly 20% of the cases, the driver had taken more than 1 of the studied sedative-hypnotics; only 2.5% had no findings other than a single sedative-hypnotic in their blood. The drug use pattern of those positive for zopiclone and zolpidem was somewhat different from that of users of benzodiazepine sedative-hypnotics; their age was higher and the concomitant use of illegal stimulants was markedly less prevalent than among the users of temazepam, midazolam, and nitrazepam.", 
    "7": "There were very few cases in our study population where the positive sedative-hypnotic finding could have been due to appropriate medical use. The extremely prevalent concomitant use of other psychoactive drugs and the high median serum concentrations of the studied sedative-hypnotics suggest their widespread abuse among apprehended drivers.", 
    "8": "Over the past two decades, there has been a notable rise in the use of antipsychotic drugs, as they are used to treat an increasing number of neuropsychiatric disorders. This rise has been led predominantly by greater use of the second generation antipsychotic (SGA) drugs, which have a low incidence of neurological side-effects. However, many SGAs cause metabolic dysregulation, including glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, thus increasing the risk of cardiometabolic disorders. The metabolic effects of the novel SGA lurasidone, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2010, remain largely unknown. As rodent models accurately predict the metabolic effects of SGAs in humans, the aim of the present study was to use sophisticated animal models of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance to measure the metabolic effects of lurasidone. In parallel, we compared the SGA olanzapine, which has established metabolic effects. Adult female rats were treated with vehicle, lurasidone (0.2, 0.8 or 2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) or olanzapine (10.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and subjected to the glucose tolerance test (GTT). Separate groups of rats were treated with vehicle, lurasidone (0.2, 0.8 or 2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) or olanzapine (1.5 and 15 mg/kg, s.c.) and tested for insulin resistance with the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (HIEC). Compared to vehicle treated animals, lurasidone caused mild glucose intolerance in the GTT with a single dose, but there was no effect on insulin resistance in the GTT, measured by HOMA-IR. The HIEC also confirmed no effect of lurasidone on insulin resistance. In contrast, olanzapine demonstrated dose-dependent and potent glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance in both tests. Thus, in preclinical models, lurasidone demonstrates mild metabolic liability compared to existing SGAs such as olanzapine. However, confirmation of these effects in humans with equivalent tests should be confirmed.", 
    "9": "Benzodiazepine drugs, through interaction with GABA(A\u03b11), GABA(A\u03b12,3), and GABA(A\u03b15) subunits, modulate cortical network oscillations, as reflected by a complex signature in the EEG power spectrum. Recent drug discovery efforts have developed GABA(A\u03b12,3)-subunit-selective partial modulators in an effort to dissociate the side effect liabilities from the efficacy imparted by benzodiazepines. Here, we evaluated rat EEG and behavioral end points during dosing of nine chemically distinct compounds that we confirmed statistically to selectively to enhance GABA(A\u03b12,3)-mediated vs. GABA(A\u03b11) or GABA(A\u03b15) currents in voltage clamped oocytes transfected with those GABA(A) subunits. These compounds were shown with in vivo receptor occupancy techniques to competitively displace [(3)H]flumazenil in multiple brain regions following peripheral administration at increasing doses. Over the same dose range, the compounds all produced dose-dependent EEG spectral power increases in the \u03b2- and and \u03b3-bands. Finally, the dose range that increased \u03b3-power coincided with that eliciting punished over unpunished responding in a behavioral conflict model of anxiety, indicative of anxiolysis without sedation. EEG \u03b3-band power increases showed a significant positive correlation to in vitro GABA(A\u03b12,3) modulatory intrinsic activity across the compound set, further supporting a hypothesis that this EEG signature was linked specifically to pharmacological modulation of GABA(A\u03b12,3) signaling. These findings encourage further evaluation of this EEG signature as a noninvasive clinical translational biomarker that could ultimately facilitate development of GABA(A\u03b12,3)-subtype-selective drugs for anxiety and potentially other indications.", 
    "10": "Along with urbanization of the living environment, the number of patients with circadian rhythm sleep disorder (CRSD) has been increasing. There are several treatment candidates for CRSD, such as light therapy, drugs (melatonin and vitamin B12), and sleep hygiene education. However, successful treatment method has not been established. In free-running type (FRT) CRSD, the endogenous circadian rhythm cannot be entrained to the 24-h light-dark cycle, resulting in free running on a cycle 0.5-2.5 h longer than the 24-h period. This condition is relatively common in blind individuals and is unusual in sighted individuals. Here we report two sighted patients with FRT, successfully treated with a melatonin receptor agonist, ramelteon. Patient 1 (36-year-old female) had suffered from FRT for nearly 4 months after resigning her job. She was given sleep hygiene education together with ramelteon at first and the free-running cycle stopped after treatment day 15. Triazolam was added from the day 25 to promote earlier sleep onset. And the sleep-wake schedule was normalized by the day 34. Patient 2 (33-year-old male) had suffered from FRT for nearly 8 months after starting to take a leave of absence from his job. He was given sleep hygiene education and was treated with ramelteon and methylcobalamin. His sleep-wake schedule was normalized from the first treatment day. By the combined treatment with ramelteon, both patients have maintained favorable sleep-wake schedules. The agonist action of ramelteon at the melatonin 2 receptor may have primarily contributed to the cessation of the free-running cycle in these patients.",

Disruption in gamma oscillations is implicated in cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders, and 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT3Rs) are suggested as therapeutic targets for cognitive dysfunction in psychiatric disorders. Using a 5-HT3aR-EGFP transgenic mouse line and inducing gamma oscillations by carbachol in hippocampal slices, we show that activation of 5-HT3aRs, which are exclusively expressed in cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing interneurons, selectively suppressed and desynchronized firings in these interneurons by enhancing spike-frequency accommodation in a small conductance potassium (SK)-channel-dependent manner. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons therefore received diminished inhibitory input leading to increased but desynchronized firings of PV cells. As a consequence, the firing of pyramidal neurons was desynchronized and gamma oscillations were impaired. These effects were independent of 5-HT3aR-mediated CCK release. Our results therefore revealed an important role of 5-HT3aRs in gamma oscillations and identified a novel crosstalk among different types of interneurons for regulation of network oscillations. The functional link between 5-HT3aR and gamma oscillations may have implications for understanding the cognitive impairments in psychiatric disorders.", 
    "46": "GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are ligand-gated ion channels that mediate inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). They are members of the Cys-loop receptor family and display marked structural and functional heterogeneity. Many GABA(A)Rs receptor subtypes are allosterically modulated by benzodiazepines (BDZs), which are drugs extensively used as anxiolytics, sedative-hypnotics and anticonvulsants. One high-affinity site and at least three additional low-affinity sites for BDZ recognition have been identified in several heteromeric and homomeric variants of the GABA(A)Rs (e.g.: \u03b11\u03b22\u03b32, \u03b11\u03b22/3, \u03b23, etc.). However, the modulation of homomeric GABA(A)\u03c1Rs by BDZs was not previously revealed, and these receptors, for a long a time, were assumed to be fully insensitive to the actions of these drugs. In the present study, human homomeric GABA(A)\u03c11 receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and GABA-evoked responses electrophysiologically recorded in the presence or absence of BDZs. GABA(A)\u03c11 receptor-mediated responses were modulated by diazepam and 4'-chlorodiazepam in the micromolar range, in a concentration-dependent, voltage-independent and reversible manner. Diazepam produced potentiating effects on GABA-evoked Cl(-) currents and 4'-Cl diazepam induced biphasic effects depending on the GABA concentration, whereas Ro15-4513 and alprazolam were negative modulators. BDZ actions were insensitive to flumazenil. Other BDZs showed negligible activity at equivalent experimental conditions. Our results suggest that GABA(A)\u03c11 receptor function can be selectively and differentially modulated by BDZs.", 
    "47": "Fast inhibitory signalling in the mammalian brain is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs), which are targets for anti-epileptic therapy such as benzodiazepines. GABAARs undergo tightly regulated trafficking processes that are essential for maintenance and physiological modulation of inhibitory strength. The trafficking of GABAARs to and from the membrane is altered during prolonged seizures such as in Status Epilepticus (SE) and has been suggested to contribute to benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance in patients with SE. However, the intracellular signalling mechanisms that cause this modification in GABAAR trafficking remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the surface stability of GABAARs during SE utilising the low Mg(2+) model in hippocampal rat neurons. Live-cell imaging of super ecliptic pHluorin (SEP)-tagged \u03b12 subunit containing GABAARs during low Mg(2+) conditions reveals that the somatic surface receptor pool undergoes down-regulation dependent on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity. Analysis of the intracellular Ca(2+) signal during low Mg(2+) using the Ca(2+)-indicator Fluo4 shows that this reduction of surface GABAARs correlates well with the timeline of intracellular Ca(2+) changes. Furthermore, we show that the activation of the phosphatase calcineurin was required for the decrease in surface GABAARs in neurons undergoing epileptiform activity. These results indicate that somatic modulation of GABAAR trafficking during epileptiform activity in vitro is mediated by calcineurin activation which is linked to changes in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations. These mechanisms could account for benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance and the maintenance of recurrent seizure activity, and reveal potential novel targets for the treatment of SE.", 
    "48": "HIV has become a highly treatable disease due to advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Additionally, HIV-infected individuals often take opiates, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines to treat co-occurring conditions, including pain and symptoms of HIV. We sought to examine prescription medication misuse by surveying 295 HIV-infected patients receiving ART. Participants answered questions about their demographics, alcohol and other drug use, psychiatric diagnoses, ART adherence and side effects, and quality of life. Eleven percent of our sample acknowledged prescription medication misuse. In regression analysis, prescription medication misusers were more likely to report any drinking to intoxication (OR=4.31, 95% CI: 1.35-13.76, p=0.013), reported greater severity of ART side effects (OR=1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10, p=0.041), and demonstrated poorer cognitive functioning (OR=0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99, p=0.048) compared to those who did not misuse prescription medications. Special care should be taken by medical providers before prescribing medications that may be abused or diverted. Patients should also be screened for aberrant use, even if not prescribed. ART side effects, cognitive deficits, and alcohol abuse may serve as risk factors or indicators of prescription medication misuse, and should be monitored.", 
    "49": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a medical emergency for companion animals, with significant associated morbidity and mortality. Therapy in companion animals and people has been largely with sedatives and anesthetics, many of which have gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-mediated mechanisms. Early aggressive treatment includes staged first-line therapy with benzodiazepines, and second- and third-line protocols when needed. Recently, intravenous levetiracetam has also been used in for SE in dogs and people, and there are other human intravenous drug preparations that may hold promise for future use in companion animals.",

Psychotic symptoms recurred contingent to medication noncompliance necessitating hospitalization. Treatment was complicated by the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). In addition, subsequent medication rechallenges failed because of recurrent rhabdomyolysis and atypical NMS. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatment was initiated, affording remission of psychotic symptoms and nonrecurrence of NMS and rhabdomyolysis. Our experience confirmed the efficacy of ECT treatment in providing symptom relief of psychosis complicated by recurrent episodes of NMS and atypical NMS. Likewise, it illustrated the efficacy of ECT treatment for rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "51": "Rats increased preference for ethanol after sessions of appetitive extinction, but not after acquisition (reinforced) sessions (Manzo et al., 2014). Drinking was not influenced by appetitive extinction in control groups with postsession access to water, rather than ethanol. Because ethanol has anxiolytic properties in tasks involving reward loss, these results were interpreted as anti-anxiety self-medication. The present experiment tested the potential for self-medication with the prescription anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine with an addictive profile used in the treatment of anxiety disorders. To test this hypothesis, Wistar rats exposed to a 32-to-4% sucrose devaluation received a two-bottle, 2-h preference test immediately after consummatory training. One bottle contained 1 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide, 2% ethanol, or water for different groups (the second bottle contained water for all groups). Three additional groups received the same postsession preference tests, but were exposed to 4% sucrose during consummatory training. Rats showed suppression of consummatory behavior after reward devaluation relative to unshifted controls. This effect was accompanied by a selective increase in preference for chlordiazepoxide and ethanol. Downshifted animals with access to water or unshifted controls with access to the anxiolytics failed to exhibit postsession changes in preference. Similar results were observed in terms of absolute consumption and consumption relative to body weight. This study shows for the first time that a prescription anxiolytic supports enhanced voluntary consumption during periods of emotional distress triggered by reward loss. Such anti-anxiety self-medication provides insights into the early stages of addictive behavior.", 
    "52": "Benzodiazepines (BDZs) continue to be shrouded in controversy, mainly because of dependence associated with their long-term use and some of their side effects. Despite treatment recommendations favoring newer antidepressants, BDZs are still commonly prescribed for anxiety and related disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated that long-term use of BDZs for these conditions can be effective and safe and that BDZs can be combined with psychological therapy and antidepressants to produce optimal outcomes. Such findings, along with a failure to convincingly demonstrate the overall superiority of alternative pharmacotherapy for anxiety and related disorders, have given an impetus to a reconsideration of the role of BDZs. This article reviews BDZs and other pharmacotherapy options for anxiety and related disorders and suggests that treatment guidelines should acknowledge that BDZs can be used as first-line, long-term pharmacological treatment for panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder.", 
    "53": "The neuropeptide S (NPS) system is characterized by a unique pharmacology because it has anxiolytic-like effects and promotes arousal and wakefulness. To shed light on this peptidergic system, we tested the sedative effect of the central depressants diazepam and ethanol on the loss of righting reflex in mice lacking the neuropeptide S receptor (NPSR), NPSR(-/-). Furthermore, we tested the effect of the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of NPS on the sedative effect of diazepam and ethanol in NPSR(-/-) and their wild type counterpart NPSR(+/+). Finally, we evaluated the effect of the pro-arousal neuropeptides CRF and Hcrt-1/Ox-A in NPSR-deficient mice. Contrary to our expectations, the results showed that the NPSR(-/-) were less sensitive to the hypnotic effects of both diazepam and ethanol compared with their wild type littermates. ICV NPS was able to attenuate the sedative effect of both alcohol and diazepam in wild type mice, but not in the NPSR(-/-) line. The administration of CRF and Hcrt-1/Ox-A, two classic pro-arousal peptides, elicited the same effects in both NPSR(-/-) and wild type mice, ruling out the possibility that adaptive mechanisms occurring at the level of these two systems could have occurred during NPSR(-/-) development to compensate for the lack of NPSR receptors. Our findings demonstrated that the deletion of NPSR leads to minor changes in the arousal behavior of mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that the deletion of NPSR did not lead to compensatory changes in the vigilance-promoting effects of the CRF and Hcrt-1/Ox-A systems.",

The activation barrier for reorientation of the methyl group in the diazepam molecule was found not changed by complex formation with \u03b2-cyclodextrin. The complex formation resulted in a decrease in the number of water molecules and affected the relaxation time of \u03b2-cyclodextrin. By the atom-atom potential method the most probable configuration of the diazepam molecule inside \u03b2-cyclodextrin cavity was proposed.", 
    "55": "Opioids have an occasional but high-risk side effect of respiratory depression. The detection of critical respiratory depression usually occurs after the event. Earlier detection would be beneficial in preventing increased morbidity and mortality of 0.01 % patients receiving analgesic opioids. Airway patency during inspiration requires vagal modulation. Regulation of the cardiovascular and respiratory centres may be coupled with a central mechanism that is indirectly measurable with heart rate variability (HRV). While opioids tend to increase parasympathetic tone, a decrease in airway stability could be due to a decrease in respiratory parasympathetic activity. Sympathetic arousal generated by apneic events may separately be recognised with short-term HRV. This pilot observational study examined the dynamic sympathovagal changes during fentanyl-midazolam induced respiratory depression on 10 subjects scheduled for minor surgery. A selection of HRV indices, able to work over sub-minute periods on non-stationary signals, were applied including a range of less common indices. Three analyses tested the effects: post-fentanyl, preceding the first central depression, and preceding obstruction of the upper airway. Statistical significance was assessed with overlap of bootstrap percentile confidence intervals for the median. A decrease in total variability, Lomb Total using the Lomb-Scargle method, is a positive finding for short-term HRV use in this study. No significant change before critical respiratory events was observed in traditional, spectral power, respiratory or other indices. One index, PolVar20, indicated a burst of sympathetic activity preceding respiratory depression similar to sleep apnoea arousals that restore airway patency. Before its usefulness in early detection of airway tone can be determined, PolVar20 requires further work: a statistical method for highly skewed distributions, auto adjustment for baseline variability, and detecting a range of sympathetic responses to apnea.",

Due to the increasing complexity of PET technology, the quantitative accuracy of PET images has to be continually reassessed if PET is to maintain its quantitative reputation. In this commentary, we discuss the results from a recent inter-scanner study in which the quantitative outcome measures from human studies were compared for three different radiotracers. The approach is a useful complement to standard phantom tests such as those prescribed by NEMA, but the resulting data are more difficult to interpret.",

If mood stabilizers remain the corner stone for bipolar disorder treatment, the development of atypical antipsychotics and their use as mood stabilizers has significantly modified therapeutic care. At the present time, psychiatrists have a large variety of psychotropic drugs for bipolar disorder: mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics\u2026 However, despite the publication of guidelines on pharmacological treatment, with a high degree of consensus, everyday clinical practices remain heterogeneous. Moreover, there are few longitudinal studies to describe therapeutic management of bipolar disorder, whatever the phase of the disease is.

    "60": "Our results show differences in the therapeutic management of bipolar disorder between France and other European countries. Regarding healthcare resource use, our results show that French patients consult more frequently a psychiatrist or a psychologist and less frequently a general practitioner or the emergency ward in comparison with patients from other European countries. In the whole European population, including France, atypical antipsychotics are widely used. Only 25% of the patients receive lithium and more than 50% of the patients receive antidepressants, while their use in bipolar disorder remains controversial. Most of the patients receive polymedication. Considering all phases of the disease pooled, less lithium and less atypical antipsychotics are prescribed to French patients, whereas they receive more antidepressants and more benzodiazepines than patients from other European countries. On the over hand, prescription of anticonvulsants and electroconvulsive therapy are equal. Moreover, data analyses by polarity of the episodes globally confirm these trends. There are a few exceptions: mixed states, in which lithium is twice more prescribed in France in comparison to other countries; depressive states, in which antidepressants are even more prescribed in other countries than in France; and less prescription of anticonvulsants in manic, mixed and euthymic phases in France.",

Although French patients have been treated by less lithium and less atypical antipsychotics than other European patients, they receive more antidepressants and more benzodiazepines. Finally, patients generally receive polymedication and the diversity in prescriptions shows how bipolar disorder is a complex disorder.", 
    "62": "The need to treat withdrawal syndromes is a common occurrence in outpatient, inpatient ward, and intensive care unit (ICU) settings. A PubMed and Google Scholar search using alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist (A2AA), specific A2AA agents, withdrawal syndrome and nicotine, and alcohol and opioid withdrawal terms was performed. A2AA agents appear to be able to modulate many of the signs and symptoms of significant withdrawal syndromes but are also capable of significant side effects, which can limit clinical use. Non-opioid oral A2AA agent use for opioid withdrawal has been well established. Pharmacologic combination therapy that utilizes A2AA agents for withdrawal syndromes appears promising but requires further formal testing to better define which other agents, under what condition(s), and at what A2AA doses are needed. The A2AA dexmedetomidine may be useful as an adjunctive agent in treating severe alcohol withdrawal syndromes in the ICU. In general, the current data does not support the routine use of A2AA as the primary or sole agent to treat ethanol/alcohol or nicotine withdrawal syndromes. Specific A2AA agents such as lofexidine has been shown to have a primary role in non-opioid-based treatment of opioid withdrawal syndrome and dexmedetomidine in combination with benzodiazepines has been shown to have potential in the treatment of severe ICU-based alcohol withdrawal syndrome.",

PBDT 13, a triazolopyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepin-8-one fused with a thiadiazolone ring, exhibited the best anticonvulsant, sedative and anxiolytic effects in our tests.

    "64": "Anxiety disorders are a major public health concern. Here, we examine the familiar area of anxiolysis in the context of a systems-level understanding that will hopefully lead to revealing an underlying pharmacological connectome. The introduction of benzodiazepines nearly half a century ago markedly improved the treatment of anxiety disorders. These agents reduce anxiety rapidly by allosterically enhancing the postsynaptic actions of GABA at inhibitory type A GABA receptors but side effects limit their use in chronic anxiety disorders. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors have emerged as an effective first-line alternative treatment of such anxiety disorders. However, many individuals are not responsive and side effects can be limiting. Research into a relatively new class of agents known as neurosteroids has revealed novel modulatory sites and mechanisms of action that are providing insights into the pathophysiology of certain anxiety disorders, potentially bridging the gap between the GABAergic and serotonergic circuits underlying anxiety. However, translating the pharmacological activity of compounds targeted to specific receptor subtypes in rodent models of anxiety to effective therapeutics in human anxiety has not been entirely successful. Since modulating any one of several broad classes of receptor targets can produce anxiolysis, we posit that a systems-level discovery platform combined with an individualized medicine approach based on noninvasive brain imaging would substantially advance the development of more effective therapeutics.",

However, the time course of ESD for large gastric tumors is frequently prolonged because of the tumor size and technical difficulties and typically requires higher doses of sedative and pain-controlling drugs. Sedative or anesthetic drugs such as midazolam or propofol are used during the procedure. Therapeutic endoscopy of early gastric cancers can often be performed with only moderate sedation. Compared with midazolam, propofol has a very fast onset of action, short plasma half-life and time to achieve sedation, faster time to recovery and discharge, and results in higher patient satisfaction. For overall success, maintaining safety and stability not only during the procedure but also subsequently in the recovery room and ward is necessary. In obese patients, it is recommended that the injected dose be based on a calculated standard weight.

For patients who have risk factors for prolonged QTc interval but whose electrocardiograms do not show this, reasonable first choices include oral or intramuscular olanzapine or aripiprazole, followed by risperidone and quetiapine or oral or intramuscular haloperidol. For those who have prolonged QTc but that measures less than 500 ms, we limit the use of antipsychotics to aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine. Finally, for patients who have a QTc of 500 ms or greater, we rely on aripiprazole, valproate, trazodone, and benzodiazepines.",

We reported that this anesthetic mixture produced almost the same anesthetic effects in both male and female BALB/c and C57BL/6J strains. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of drugs has been widely used in mice. However, various injectable routes of the anesthetic mixture may cause different anesthetic effects. First, we examined effects of the anesthetic mixture by subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) injection compared to IP injection. After injection of the anesthetic mixture, administration of atipamezole (ATI) induced mice recovery from anesthesia. Secondly, we examined how different dosage and optimum injection timing of ATI affected mice recovery from anesthesia. We used an anesthetic score to measure anesthetic duration and a pulse oximeter to monitor vital signs under anesthesia. Usually, drugs from SC injection work more weakly than IP or IV injection. However, we found no significant differences of anesthetic duration among the three different injection routes. Antagonistic effects of ATI (0.3 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg) worked equally when administered at 30 min after injection of the anesthetic mixture. Antagonistic effects of ATI (1.5 mg/kg) were stronger than ATI (0.3 mg/kg) at 10 min after injection of the anesthetic mixture. The anesthetic mixture is a useful drug to induce nearly the same anesthetic effects by different injection routes and has an antagonist of ATI which helps mice quickly recover from anesthesia. These results may contribute to the welfare of laboratory animals.",

    "113": "In the primary visual cortex (V1), monocular deprivation (MD) induces a shift in the ocular dominance (OD) of binocular neurons towards the open eye (Wiesel and Hubel, 1963; Gordon and Stryker, 1996). In V1 of C57Bl/6J mice, this OD-plasticity is maximal in juveniles, declines in adults and is absent beyond postnatal day (PD) 110 (Lehmann and L\u00f6wel, 2008) if mice are raised in standard cages. Since it was recently shown that brief dark exposure (DE) restored OD-plasticity in young adult rats (PD70-100) (He et al., 2006), we wondered whether DE would restore OD-plasticity also in adult and old mice and after a cortical stroke. To this end, we raised mice in standard cages until adulthood and transferred them to a darkroom for 10-14 days. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging we demonstrate that short-term DE can restore OD-plasticity after MD in both adult (PD138) and old mice (PD535), and that OD-shifts were mediated by an increase of open eye responses in V1. Interestingly, restored OD-plasticity after DE was accompanied by a reduction of both parvalbumin expressing cells and perineuronal nets and was prevented by increasing intracortical inhibition with diazepam. DE also maintained OD-plasticity in adult mice (PD150) after a stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex. In contrast, short-term DE did not affect basic visual parameters as measured by optomotry. In conclusion, short-term DE was able to restore OD-plasticity in both adult and aging mice and even preserved plasticity after a cortical stroke, most likely mediated by reducing intracortical inhibition.", 
    "114": "Schizophrenia patients exhibit a wide range of impairments in cognitive functions. Clinically, atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPs) such as olanzapine (OLZ) have a therapeutic effect on memory function among schizophrenia patients rather than typical antipsychotics, e.g., haloperidol. To date, however, little is known about the neuroplasticity mechanism underlying the effect of AAPs on the impairment of cognitive functions. Here, we treated schizophrenia rat models with a systematic injection of MK-801 (0.1mg/kg) and chose the drug OLZ as a tool to investigate the mechanisms of AAPs when used to alter cognitive function. The results showed that the systematic administration of MK-801 results in the impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as spatial working memory in a Morris water maze task. OLZ but not HAL improved these MK-801-induced cognitive dysfunctions. After MK-801 application, the hippocampal LTP was profoundly impaired. In conjunction with the results of the behavioral test, the administration of OLZ but not of HAL resulted in a significant reversal effect on the impaired LTP induced via MK-801 application. Furthermore, we found that OLZ but not HAL can upregulate the phosphorylation of GluR1 Ser845. These data suggest that the therapeutic effect of OLZ on cognitive dysfunctions may be due to its contribution to synaptic plasticity via the ability to upregulate the state of GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation. We therefore suggest that the upregulated state of GluR1 Ser845 phosphorylation may be a promising target for developing novel therapeutics for treating schizophrenia.",

Thermal analysis, using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermomicroscopy (HSM), suggested the presence of particles of reduced size of olanzapine precipitated inside the microspheres. The microspheres were also studied by means of electron microscopy (SEM) for their shape and aspect, by some image analysis parameters (fractal dimension) and using Energy-dispersive X-ray (X-EDS) and micro-Raman spectroscopy to qualitatively evaluate the composition of different points of the surface. The surface of the microspheres displayed a non-homogeneous distribution of the drug by the presence of wart-like protuberances, whose number increases as the Lutrol content of the systems increases. The same systems in the absence of US, obtained after cooling the molten mixtures, lack these structures and only a very few of them can be found. The blooming of the surface was hypothesized as related to crystallization or phase de-mixing or lipid component diffusion of the carrier mixture inside the cooling mass subjected to ultrasound vibration. Ultrasounds accelerate the physical changes concerning carriers and drug, outlining the importance of ultrasound to achieve stability for formulations of this type. The microspheres de-aggregate on contact with the dissolution medium and release the drug with a bimodal mode according to the Lutrol content.", 
    "116": "Only trace amounts of parent benzodiazepines are present in urine following extensive metabolism and conjugation. Thus, hydrolysis of glucuronides is necessary for improved detection. Enzyme hydrolysis is preferred to retain identification specificity, but can be costly and time-consuming. The assessment of a novel recombinant \u03b2-glucuronidase for rapid hydrolysis in benzodiazepine urinalysis is presented. Glucuronide controls for oxazepam, lorazepam and temazepam were treated with IMCSzyme\u2122 recombinant \u03b2-glucuronidase. Hydrolysis efficiency was assessed at 55\u00b0C and at room temperature (RT) using the recommended optimum pH. Hydrolysis efficiency for four other benzodiazepines was evaluated solely with positive patient samples. Maximum hydrolysis of glucuronide controls at 5 min at RT (mean analyte recovery \u2265 94% for oxazepam and lorazepam and \u2265 80% for temazepam) was observed. This was considerably faster than the optimized 30 min incubation time for the abalone \u03b2-glucuronidase at 65\u00b0C. Mean analyte recovery increased at longer incubation times at 55\u00b0C for temazepam only. Total analyte in patient samples compared well to targets from abalone hydrolysis after recombinant \u03b2-glucuronidase hydrolysis at RT with no incubation. Some matrix effect, differential reactivity, conjugation variability and transformation impacting total analyte recovery were indicated. The unique potential of the IMCSzyme\u2122 recombinant \u03b2-glucuronidase was demonstrated with fast benzodiazepine hydrolysis at RT leading to decreased processing time without the need for heat activation.",

Shortly after the last death, on August 1 2013, AH-7921 was scheduled as a narcotic and largely disappeared from the illicit market in Sweden. AH-7921 was measured by a selective liquid chromatography-MS-MS method and the concentrations of AH-7921 ranged from 0.03 to 0.99 \u00b5g/g blood. Six of our cases had other drugs of abuse on board and most had other medications such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants and analgesics. However, the other medicinal drugs encountered were present in postmortem therapeutic concentrations and unlikely to have contributed to death. In addition to the parent compound, we identified six possible metabolites where two N-demethylated dominated and four mono-hydroxylated were found in trace amounts in the blood. In conclusion, deaths with AH-7921 seem to occur both at low and high concentrations, probably a result of different tolerance to the drug. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that no sharp dividing line exists between lethal and non-lethal concentrations. Further, poly-drug use did not seem to be a major contributing factor for the fatal outcome.",

At the same time, the state's driving under the influence statutes were amended to include a per se level of 5 ng/mL delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in whole blood for drivers aged 21 years and older. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of marijuana legalization on the prevalence of marijuana in suspected impaired driving cases. The prevalence of both active THC and its metabolite carboxy-THC detected in such cases pre-legalization was compared with the prevalence post-legalization. In 2009-2012, the average yearly percentage of cases positive for THC and carboxy-THC was 19.1% (range: 18.2-20.2%) and 27.9% (range: 26.3-28.6%), respectively. In 2013, the percentages had significantly increased to 24.9 and 40.0%, respectively (P < 0.05). The median THC concentration over the 5-year period ranged from 5.2 to 6.3 ng/mL, with individual concentrations ranging up to 90 ng/mL. An average of 56% of cases were at or >5 ng/mL over the 5-year period. The prevalence of alcohol and the majority of other drugs in this same population of suspected impaired drivers submitted for testing did not change during this same 5-year period-marijuana was the only drug to show such an increase in frequency. Further, this observed increase remained after the data had been normalized to account for changes in laboratory testing procedures that occurred during this time period. Future studies need be conducted to ascertain whether the observed increase has had any effect on the incidence of crashes, serious injuries and/or traffic fatalities.",

The described case management strategy is supported by known impairment of ethanol at relatively high concentrations, difficulty assigning a level of contributing impairment from drugs in the presence of high ethanol levels and the likelihood that the drug results may be suppressed at trial. Although the results of this study reinforce the assertion that such protocols lead to the under reporting of drugs in DUI cases, for the majority of cases, 95% in this study, the drug analysis results were not significant and did not warrant the time and resources needed for the additional blood drug testing. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that a high drug positivity rate does not necessarily mean that those drug results are legally or pharmacologically meaningful. Additional research should be conducted with quantitative drug results and casework impact of blood drug screen protocols as previous studies only report drug positivity rates and not whether the drug results would be meaningful to the case.",

CYP3A4 is one of the primary CYP450 isoforms responsible for the metabolism of methadone to EDDP in humans. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CYP3A4 genetic polymorphisms in accidental methadone fatalities. A study cohort consisting of 136 methadone-only and 92 combined methadone/benzodiazepine fatalities was selected from cases investigated at the West Virginia and Kentucky Offices of the Chief Medical Examiner. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped within the CYP3A4 gene. Observed allelic and genotypic frequencies were compared with expected frequencies obtained from The National Center for Biotechnology Information dbSNP database. SNPs rs2242480 and rs2740574 demonstrated an apparent enrichment within the methadone-only overdose fatalities compared with the control group and the general population. This enrichment was not apparent in the methadone/benzodiazepine cases for these two SNPs. Our findings indicate that there may be two or more SNPs on the CYP3A4 gene that cause or contribute to the methadone poor metabolizer phenotype.",

A child with EA may be restless, may cause self-injury or may disrupt the dressing, surgical site or indwelling devices, leading to the potential for parents to be dissatisfied with their child's anaesthetic. To prevent such outcomes, the child may require pharmacological or physical restraint. Sevoflurane may be a major contributing factor in the development of EA. Therefore, an evidence-based understanding of the risk/benefit profile regarding sevoflurane compared with other general anaesthetic agents and adjuncts would facilitate its rational and optimal use.", 
    "139": "To compare sevoflurane with other general anaesthetic (GA) agents, with or without pharmacological or non-pharmacological adjuncts, with regard to risk of EA in children during emergence from anaesthesia. The primary outcome was risk of EA; secondary outcome was agitation score.", 
    "140": "We searched the following databases from the date of inception to 19 January 2013: CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (EBSCOhost), Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews (EBMR) and the Web of Science, as well as the reference lists of other relevant articles and online trial registers.", 
    "141": "We included all randomized (or quasi-randomized) controlled trials investigating children < 18 years of age presenting for general anaesthesia with or without surgical intervention. We included any study in which a sevoflurane anaesthetic was compared with any other GA, and any study in which researchers investigated adjuncts (pharmacological or non-pharmacological) to sevoflurane anaesthesia compared with no adjunct or placebo.", 
    "142": "Two review authors independently searched the databases, decided on inclusion eligibility of publications, ascertained study quality and extracted data. They then resolved differences between their results by discussion. Data were entered into RevMan 5.2 for analyses and presentation. Comparisons of the risk of EA were presented as risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Sevoflurane is treated as the control anaesthesia in this review. Sensitivity analyses were performed as appropriate, to exclude studies with a high risk of bias and to investigate heterogeneity.", 
    "143": "We included 158 studies involving 14,045 children. Interventions to prevent EA fell into two broad groups. First, alternative GA compared with sevoflurane anaesthesia (69 studies), and second, use of an adjunct with sevoflurane anaesthesia versus sevoflurane without an adjunct (100 studies). The overall risk of bias in included studies was low. The overall Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) assessment of the quality of the evidence was moderate to high. A wide range of EA scales were used, as were different levels of cutoff, to determine the presence or absence of EA. Some studies involved children receiving potentially inadequate or no analgesia intraoperatively during painful procedures.Halothane (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.63, 3534 participants, high quality of evidence) and propofol anaesthesia were associated with a lower risk of EA than sevoflurane anaesthesia. Propofol was effective when used throughout anaesthesia (RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.51, 1098 participants, high quality of evidence) and when used only during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia after sevoflurane induction (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.76, 738 participants, high quality of evidence). No clear evidence was found of an effect on risk of EA of desflurane (RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.31, 408 participants, moderate quality of evidence) or isoflurane (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.23, 379 participants, moderate quality of evidence) versus sevoflurane.Compared with no adjunct, effective adjuncts for reducing the risk of EA during sevoflurane anaesthesia included dexmedetomidine (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.47, 851 participants, high quality of evidence), clonidine (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.66, 739 participants, high quality of evidence), opioids, in particular fentanyl (RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.50, 1247 participants, high quality of evidence) and a bolus of propofol (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.89, 394 participants, moderate quality of evidence), ketamine (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69, 231 participants, moderate quality of evidence) or midazolam (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.81, 116 participants, moderate quality of evidence) at the end of anaesthesia. Midazolam oral premedication (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.12, 370 participants, moderate quality of evidence) and parental presence at emergence (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.60, 180 participants, moderate quality of evidence) did not reduce the risk of EA.One or more factors designated as high risk of bias were noted in less than 10% of the included studies. Sensitivity analyses of these studies showed no clinically relevant changes in the risk of EA. Heterogeneity was significant with respect to these comparisons: halothane; clonidine; fentanyl; midazolam premedication; propofol 1 mg/kg bolus at end; and ketamine 0.25 mg/kg bolus at end of anaesthesia. With investigation of heterogeneity, the only clinically relevant changes to findings were seen in the context of potential pain, namely, the setting of adenoidectomy/adenotonsillectomy (propofol bolus; midazolam premedication) and the absence of a regional block (clonidine).", 
    "144": "Propofol, halothane, alpha-2 agonists (dexmedetomidine, clonidine), opioids (e.g. fentanyl) and ketamine reduce the risk of EA compared with sevoflurane anaesthesia, whereas no clear evidence shows an effect for desflurane, isoflurane, midazolam premedication and parental presence at emergence. Therefore anaesthetists can consider several effective strategies to reduce the risk of EA in their clinical practice. Future studies should ensure adequate analgesia in the control group, for which pain may be a contributing or confounding factor in the diagnosis of EA. Regardless of the EA scale used, it would be helpful for study authors to report the risk of EA, so that this might be included in future meta-analyses. Researchers should also consider combining effective interventions as a multi-modal approach to further reduce the risk of EA.", 
    "145": "Heat stress is a major limiting factor of grapevine production and quality. Acclimation and recovery are essential to ensure plant survival, and the recovery mechanisms can be independent of the heat response mechanisms. An experimental set up with and without acclimation to heat followed by recovery [stepwise acclimation and recovery (SAR) and stepwise recovery (SR), respectively] was applied to two grapevine varieties, Touriga Nacional (TN), and Trincadeira (TR), with different tolerance to abiotic stress. Major differences were found between leaves of SAR and SR, especially after recovery; in SAR, almost all parameters returned to basal levels while in SR they remained altered. Acclimation led to a swifter and short-term antioxidative response, affecting the plant to a lesser extent than SR. Significant differences were found among varieties: upon stress, TN significantly increased ascorbate and glutathione reduction levels, boosting the cell's redox-buffering capacity, while TR needed to synthesize both metabolites, its response being insufficient to keep the redox state at working levels. TR was affected by stress for a longer period and the up-regulation pattern of antioxidative stress genes was more obvious. In TN, heat shock proteins were significantly induced, but the canonical heat-stress gene signature was not evident probably because no shutdown of the housekeeping metabolism was needed.", 
    "146": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia and is currently incurable. To expand the therapeutic armamentarium, we investigated antitumor activity of pyrrolo[1,2-b][1,2,5]benzothiadiazepine (PBTDs) in MEC1 cells. We found that PBTD (RS2778) treatment enhanced the activation of pro-apoptotic members, such as caspase-9, 3, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and bax, but suppressed the activation of anti-apoptotic molecule BCL-2 in these cells. Furthermore, PBTD (RS2778)-induced autophagic cell death was verified by LC3-II conversion, and upregulation of Beclin-1 and ATG5. In addition, such compound impeded hyper phosphorylation of AKT as were determined by Western blot. In summary, PBTD (RS2778) inhibited viability and induced multiple cellular events including apoptosis, autophagic cell death, in human MEC1 cells. This distinct activity of PBTD (RS2778) against these cells suggests potential for PBTDs as a therapeutic agent for treatment of CLL.", 
    "147": "Methemoglobinemia (MetHb) after exposure to benzocaine (BZC) has been reported for more than 50 years, however the pathophysiologic mechanism has not been previously established. Direct administration of BZC to blood does not produce MetHb. After topical use, due to the lipophilicity and rapid acetylation in the tissue, little BZC reaches the liver for hepatic biotransformation. However, isolated human livers have been shown to produce MetHb forming N-hydroxyl metabolites from BZC. We report a case of BZC-induced MetHb with the first identification and quantification of the reactive metabolite responsible for the oxidative stress: N-Hydroxy-Para-amino benzoic acid (N-OH-PABA).", 
    "148": "An 8 year old male was admitted to a hospital for an appendectomy. Several applications of BZC spray were used during multiple attempts at nasogastric tube placement. In various attempts to achieve local anesthesia, benzocaine spray was used in both nares and through the mouth aimed at the posterior oropharynx. The patient subsequently became cyanotic with an initial MetHb level of 32.9 %. Methylene blue was administered and the patient promptly responded with resolution of cyanosis. Blood taken within 20 min of the initial symptoms contained benzocaine (5.2ug/mL), bupivacaine (740ng/mL), lidocaine (530ng/mL), acetaminophen (12ug/mL), midazolam (60ng/mL), PABA and N-OH-PABA (35ng/mL). Serum was analyzed using Liquid Chromatography- Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry. Mass spectrometry was done using an electrospray ionization source run in negative and positive polarities. A reference standard for N-OH-PABA was synthesized for confirmation and quantification.", 
    "149": "The rare and idiopathic nature of methemoglobinemia after benzocaine use has made study of the pathophysiologic mechanism in humans difficult. Lack of understanding has brought calls for restriction of use of the widely used medication that may not be based on evidence. Our case presents several unique features: 1) benzocaine absorption after topical administration was documented with serum concentrations 2) confirmation of an in vivo formation of MetHb-forming n-hydroxyl-metabolite after benzocaine use and 3) the documentation of N-OH-PABA in humans within 20 min of MetHb post-benzocaine administration.",

This latter cluster of symptoms is called opioid bowel dysfunction, although it may co-occur with NBS. Hypothesized mechanisms of the central effects of opioids on nociception in NBS include spinal cord inflammation and dysfunction in opioid receptor activity and related neuroanatomical substrates. With continued use, \u223c6% of patients taking narcotics chronically will develop NBS, with profound consequences in terms of daily function. The primary management paradigm for NBS is a structured opioid withdrawal program accompanied by centrally acting adjunctive therapy comprising antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and clonidine to target pain, anxiety, and depression, and prevent withdrawal effects, in addition to peripherally acting agents such as laxatives (e.g., osmotic laxatives and chloride channel activators) to control transient constipation. Such structured withdrawal programs have been prospectively evaluated in small clinical trials and have met with considerable success in the short term.",

Trichloroethylene is a chlorinated hydrocarbon solvent once used as an anesthetic as well as in glues and other consumer products. It is now primarily employed as a metal degreaser. We found that the stimulus effects of trichloroethylene were similar to those of other chlorinated hydrocarbon vapors, the aromatic hydrocarbon toluene and the vapor anesthetics methoxyflurane and isoflurane. The stimulus effects of trichloroethylene overlapped with those of the barbiturate methohexital, to a lesser extent the benzodiazepine midazolam and to ethanol. NMDA antagonists, the kappa opioid agonist U50,488 and the mixed 5-HT agonist mCPP largely failed to substitute for trichloroethylene.

Despite a consistent increase in anxiolytics, the prevalence of anxiety is static; this necessitates the development of new compounds with potential activity and minimum unwanted effects. A serotonergic (5HT) system plays an important role in pathogenesis of anxiety and predominantly involves 5HT1A receptor action in mediating anxiety-like behavior; the antagonism of 5HT1A receptor has demonstrated to produce anxiolytic-like effects. Alverine citrate (AVC) is reported as a 5HT1A antagonist; however, its effects on anxiety-like behavior are not investigated. Thus, the present study, by utilizing a neurobehavioral approach, examined the anxiolytic-like effects of AVC in experimental mouse models of anxiety. Mice were acutely treated with AVC (5-20mg/kg, i.p.)/diazepam (DIA, 2mg/kg, i.p.) and subjected to four validated anxiety models viz. elevated plus-maze (EPM), light/dark (L/D), hole-board (HB) and marble burying (MB) tests. AVC (15-20mg/kg) and DIA significantly increased open arm activity in EPM, exploration in light chamber in L/D test, exploratory behavior in HB and reduced MB behavior in marble burying test. AVC (5mg/kg) had no effect on all behavioral tests, while AVC (10mg/kg) produced partial effects. It revealed anxiolytic-like effects of AVC. Furthermore, anxiolytic-like effects of AVC at higher doses (15-20mg/kg) were more pronounced than lower doses (10mg/kg) and were quite similar to the standard drug DIA. The present finding demonstrates, for the first time, the anxiolytic-like effects of AVC, which may be an alternative approach for management of anxiety-related disorders.",

On measures of abuse potential (e.g., liking and good effects), inhaled alprazolam was more potent, as evidenced by a leftward shift in the dose-response curve.

    "203": "We report on a case of repeated MDPV consumptions that resulted in severe psychosis and agitation prompting the concomitant abuse of benzodiazepines. A 27-year-old man was found irresponsive in his apartment and was brought to the emergency department (ED) of a local hospital. When in ED, he rapidly recovered and self-reported to have recently injected some doses of MDPV that he had bought in the Internet. He left the hospital without medical cares. 15 days after, he was again admitted to the same ED due to severe agitation, delirium and hallucinations, and reported the use of MDPV and pharmaceutical drugs during the preceding week. He was sedated with diazepam and chlorpromazine. Urine samples collected in both occasions were sent for testing using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and liquid chromatography-high resolution multiple mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) on an Orbitrap. The LC-HRMS analysis revealed the presence of MDPV and its phase I and phase II metabolites (demethylenyl-MDPV, demethylenyl-methyl-MDPV, demethylenyl-methyl-oxo-MDPV, demethylenyl-hydroxy-alkyl-MDPV, demethylenyl-methyl-hydroxy alkyl-MDPV, demethylenyl-oxo-MDPV and their corresponding glucuronides), alprazolam and alprazolam metabolite at the first ED admission; at the time of the second ED access, the same MDPV metabolites, alprazolam, temazepam, and chlordiazepoxide were detected together with diazepam and metabolites. LC-HRMS/MS was use to determine the following concentrations, respectively on his first and second admission: MDPV 55ng/mL, alprazolam 114ng/mL, \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam 104ng/mL; MDPV 35ng/mL, alprazolam 10.4ng/mL, \u03b1 -hydroxyalprazolam 13ng/mL; chlordiazepoxide 13ng/mL, temazepam 170ng/mL, diazepam 1.3ng/mL, nordiazepam 61.5, oxazepam 115ng/mL. The toxicological findings corroborated the referred concomitant use of multiple pharmaceutical drugs and benzodiazepines. Confirmation of previous hypothesis on human metabolism of MDPV could be inferred by the analysis of urine.", 
    "204": "A series of sulfamide and triazole benzodiazepines were obtained with the principle of bioisosterism. The p53-murine double minute 2 (MDM2) inhibitory activity and in vitro antitumor activity were evaluated. Most of the novel benzodiazepines exhibited moderate protein binding inhibitory activity. Particularly, triazole benzodiazepines showed good inhibitory activity and antitumor potency. Compound 16 had promising antitumor activity against the U-2 OS human osteosarcoma cell line with an IC50 value of 4.17 \u03bcM, which was much better than that of nutlin-3. The molecular docking model also successfully predicted that this class of compounds mimicked the three critical residues of p53 binding to MDM2.", 
    "205": "This study compared the incidence of adverse sedation-related events occurring with two different multiagent oral sedation regimens in pediatric dental patients.", 
    "206": "Forty healthy patients (three to six years old), received either a sedation regimen of chloral hydrate, meperidine, and hydroxyzine with nitrous oxide (CH/M/H/N2O; N=19) or a regimen of midazolam, meperidine, and hydroxyzine with nitrous oxide (MZ/M/H/N2O; N=21). The two treating dentists answered a questionnaire regarding the perioperative period. Parents received two phone interviews at eight and 24 hours after sedation. Statistical analysis included chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficient, and t-test (P<.05).", 
    "207": "Children sedated with MZ/M/H/N2O showed a significant increase in hyperactivity during dental treatment, slurring/difficulty speaking, and difficulty walking postoperatively within eight hours after discharge. Children sedated with CH/M/H/N2O showed a significant increase in frequency of sleeping, talking less than normal after arriving home, and an increased need for postoperative pain medication.", 
    "208": "Different oral sedation regimens produce different adverse sedation-related events. The provider of pediatric oral sedation should select a sedative regimen with an adverse sedation-related profile that he/she believes is optimal for the patient being treated. Parents should be counseled as to possible postsedation effects anticipated based on the sedative regimen administered.", 
    "209": "Delirium tremens develops in a minority of patients undergoing acute alcohol withdrawal; however, that minority is vulnerable to significant morbidity and mortality. Historically, benzodiazepines are given intravenously to control withdrawal symptoms, although occasionally a more substantial medication is needed to prevent the devastating effects of delirium tremens, that is, propofol. We report a trauma patient who required propofol sedation for delirium tremens that was refractory to benzodiazepine treatment. Extubed prematurely, he suffered a non-ST segment myocardial infarction followed by an ST segment myocardial infarction requiring multiple interventions by cardiology. We hypothesize that his myocardial ischemia was secondary to an increased myocardial oxygen demand that occurred during his stress-induced catecholamine surge during the time he was undertreated for delirium tremens. This advocates for the use of propofol for refractory benzodiazepine treatment of delirium tremens and adds to the literature on the instability patients experience during withdrawal.", 
    "210": "Luteolin, a major component of flavones, is known to have various physiological properties. Although luteolin reportedly has an antinociceptive effect on acute and inflammatory pain, little is known about its effect on neuropathic pain. The aim of the present study was to determine whether luteolin could ameliorate hyperalgesia in the central nervous system using a neuropathic pain model. Chronic constriction injury to the sciatic nerve was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Luteolin (0.1-1.5 mg) was administered intrathecally or intracerebroventricularly to examine the central effects on mechanical, thermal, and cold hyperalgesia using the electronic von Frey test, plantar test, and cold plate test, respectively. A rotarod test was also performed to assess motor function in normal rats. Spinally applied luteolin dose-dependently attenuated mechanical and cold hyperalgesia, but it had no effect on thermal hyperalgesia. At the highest dose, luteolin affected motor performance. The spinal action of luteolin on mechanical hyperalgesia was inhibited by intrathecal pretreatment with the \u03b3-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor antagonist bicuculline and \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, but not by intrathecal pretreatment with either the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil or glycine receptor antagonist strychnine. Supraspinal application of luteolin had no antihyperalgesic effects in any test. These findings suggest that luteolin ameliorates mechanical and cold hyperalgesia at least in part by activating GABAA receptors in a flumazenil-insensitive manner and \u03bc-opioid receptors in the spinal cord, but that the supraspinal regions are unlikely to contribute to the antihyperalgesic action of luteolin. Luteolin could be a candidate therapeutic agent for neuropathic pain.", 
    "211": "It was the aim of this study to determine the potential effect of walnut kernel extract (WKE) on experimentally induced seizures in rats and to evaluate the role of benzodiazepines and ethosuximide (ESM) within these pathways.", 
    "212": "Male Wistar rats were selected and divided into eight groups. Seizures were evoked by intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ; 2 mg/ml/min). In combination with PTZ, animals were treated with vehicle or WKE (100 mg/kg i.p.), with or without cotreatment with either flumazenil (FMZ; 5 mg/kg i.p.), ESM (150 mg/kg i.p.) or diazepam (DPZ; 0.5 mg/kg i.p.).", 
    "213": "WKE administration significantly increased the PTZ dose needed to induce the first myoclonic jerk (13.09 \u00b1 1.29 vs. 49.71 \u00b1 12.03 mg/kg; p < 0.001), decreased the severity of seizure grades and reduced the mortality rate to 0%. FMZ did not significantly reduce the anticonvulsant effect of WKE. The combination of DPZ and WKE showed a synergic anticonvulsant effect, whereas ESM had no significant influence (p > 0.05) on the WKE effects.", 
    "214": "These findings indicated that WKE was effective at reducing seizure severity, at increasing the dose to the first myoclonic jerk and highly efficacious at preventing mortality, because 100% of animals were protected. It seems that this positive effect could apply through signaling pathways other than benzodiazepine-mediated \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptors and may at least in part be similar to ESM.", 
    "215": "Low affinity \u03b11/\u03b12 containing GABAA receptors are significantly less able to bind [(11) C]/[(3) H]Ro15-4513 following translocation to the endosomal environment. The alterations in [(11) C]Ro15-4513 binding observed in vivo following perturbations in endogenous GABA are likely driven by both alterations in receptor binding parameters following agonist induced internalisation and the GABA Shift.", 
    "216": "The benzodiazepine lorazepam is widely utilized in the treatment of elderly individuals with anxiety disorders and related conditions. Negative effects of acute lorazepam administration on cognitive performance, especially memory, have been reported in both previously untreated elderly and in individuals who have received short term (up to three weeks) treatment with therapeutic doses. However, it remains unclear if these adverse cognitive effects also persist after long-term use, which is frequently found in clinical practice.", 
    "217": "Cognitively intact elderly individuals (n=37) on long-term (at least three months) daily treatment with lorazepam were studied using a double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over study design. Subjects were administered their highest daily unit dose of lorazepam (0.25-3.00 mg) or placebo on different days, approximately 1 week apart in a random order, and were assessed on memory, psychomotor speed, and subjective mood states.", 
    "218": "Subjects had significantly poorer recall and slowed psychomotor performance following acute lorazepam administration. There were no significant effects on self-ratings of mood, sedation, or anxiety in the whole group, but secondary analyses suggested a differential response in subjects with Generalized Anxiety Disorder.", 
    "219": "The reduced recall and psychomotor slowing that we observed, along with an absence of significant therapeutic benefits, following acute lorazepam administration in elderly long-term users reinforces the importance of cognitive toxicity as a clinical factor in benzodiazepine use, especially in this population.", 
    "220": "A range of medications target different aspects of the GABA system; understanding their effects is important to inform further drug development. Effects on the waking EEG comparing these mechanisms have not been reported; in this study we compare the effects on resting MEG spectra of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist zolpidem, the delta sub-unit selective agonist gaboxadol (also known as THIP) and the GABA reuptake inhibitor tiagabine. These were two randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies in healthy volunteers, one using zolpidem 10 mg, gaboxadol 15 mg and placebo, and the other tiagabine 15 mg and placebo. Whole head MEG recordings and individual MEG spectra were divided into frequency bands. Baseline spectra were subtracted from each post-intervention spectra and then differences between intervention and placebo compared. After zolpidem there were significant increases in beta frequencies and reduction in alpha frequency power; after gaboxadol and tiagabine there were significant increases in power at all frequencies up to beta. Enhancement of tonic inhibition via extrasynaptic receptors by gaboxadol gives rise to a very different MEG signature from the synaptic action of zolpidem. Tiagabine theoretically can affect both types of receptor; from these MEG results it is likely that the latter is the more prominent effect here.", 
    "221": "Patients with severe carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning may develop acute respiratory failure, which needs endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation (MV). The objective of this study was to identify the predictors for duration of MV in patients with severe CO poisoning and acute respiratory failure.", 
    "222": "This is a retrospective observational study of 796 consecutive patients diagnosed with acute CO poisoning that presented to the emergency department. Patients who received MV were divided into 2 groups: the early extubation (EE) consisting of patients who were on MV for less than 72 hours and the nonearly extubation (NEE) consisting of patients who were on MV for more than 72 hours. Demographic and clinical data of the two groups were extracted for analysis.", 
    "223": "The intubation rate of all CO-poisoned patients was 23.4%. A total of 168 patients were enrolled in this study. The main source of CO exposure was intentional CO poisoning by charcoal burning (137 patients). Positive toxicology screening result was found in 104 patients (61.9%). The EE group had 105 patients (62.5%). On arriving at the emergency department, high incidence of hypotension; high white blood cell count; and elevation of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and troponin-I levels were statistically significant in the NEE group (P < .05). Positive toxicology screening result was statistically significant in the EE group (P < .05). In a multivariate analysis, elevation of troponin-I level was an independent factor for NEE (odds ratio, 1.305; 95% confidence interval, 1.024-1.663; P = .032). Positive toxicology screening result was an independent factor for EE (odds ratio, 0.222; 95% confidence interval, 0.101-0.489; P = .001).", 
    "224": "A positive toxin screen predicts extubation within the first 72 hours for patients with severe CO poisoning and acute respiratory failure. On the other hand, elevation of initial troponin-I level is a predictor for a longer duration of MV.", 
    "225": "Transdermal administration of clonazepam, a poorly water-soluble benzodiazepine, is an interesting strategy for overcoming the drawbacks of its oral administration. With this aim, two nano-carrier formulations, based on ultra-deformable liposomes and microemulsions, have been developed to favour clonazepam transdermal delivery. Considering the solubilizing power of methyl-\u03b2cyclodextrin (Me-\u03b2CD) toward clonazepam and its potential positive influence on transdermal drug delivery, the effect of its addition to these formulations was investigated. Artificial lipophilic membranes simulating the skin allowed a rapid evaluation of the drug permeation properties from the systems, compared with those from an aqueous drug suspension, with or without Me-\u03b2CD. The best formulations were further characterized by permeation through excised rabbit ear skin. All the formulations increased drug permeability, ranging from 2-fold (liposomes without Me-\u03b2CD), up to over 4-fold (microemulsions containing Me-\u03b2CD). The different formulations allowed for pointing out different possible permeation enhancing mechanisms of Me-\u03b2CD: increase in drug solubility and thermodynamic activity in the vehicle, when added to the drug aqueous suspension; interactions with the vesicle bilayer, in case of liposomal formulations; interactions with the skin membrane lipids, as evidenced in experiments with excised rabbit ear for microemulsions containing Me-\u03b2CD, that were then selected for further in vivo studies."
