    "0": "This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of triazolam by narcoleptic patients leads to improvement of nighttime sleep or excessive sleepiness. Ten narcoleptic patients, 5 males and 5 females, with complaints of sleep disturbance and aged between 18 and 60 years, were assigned to a single-blind within-subject crossover-designed study comparing placebo with 0.25 mg triazolam. All subjects completed sleep questionnaires and underwent 6 nights of polysomnographic testing. Following an adaptation night, subjects received either triazolam or placebo for 2 nights. Objective tests of sleepiness (multiple sleep latency testing/maintenance of wakefulness test) were performed. Sleep efficiency and overall sleep quality were improved on all triazolam nights. Daytime excessive sleepiness was not reduced objectively after triazolam. This study demonstrates that the short-term use of triazolam improves nocturnal sleep quality in narcoleptics. Studies of long-term administration of triazolam are required to determine if the improvement of nocturnal sleep is maintained.", 
    "1": "We evaluated the affinity of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), gastrin, and subtype-selective CCK agonists for CCK/gastrin receptors and compared it with the ability of these peptides to stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis and pepsinogen release in guinea pig gastric glands. Competitive binding studies using 125I-labeled Bolton-Hunter-CCK-8 and 125I-gastrin showed the presence of CCK-B/gastrin receptors in gastric glands and dispersed chief cells. In contrast, the potency of peptides in stimulating PI hydrolysis in both gastric glands and dispersed chief cells displayed a profile similar to CCK-A receptors found in pancreatic acini, i.e., CCK-8 = A 71378 greater than A 71623 greater than A 70874 much greater than A 72962 = CCK-8 (desulfated) greater than gastrin II greater than gastrin I. In general, the rank order of potency of peptides for stimulation of PI hydrolysis correlated well with their ability to stimulate pepsinogen release. At concentrations greater than 10 microM, efficacies of gastrin I and II in stimulating pepsinogen release from gastric glands were near 90% of the maximal activity of CCK-8. The inhibitory potency of MK-329, a selective CCK-A receptor antagonist, was similar against either CCK-8 (10 nM) or gastrin I (10 microM), except that a minor portion (approximately 30-40%) of gastrin I-induced pepsinogen release was insensitive to MK-329. The MK-329-insensitive component was inhibited by CI-988, a potent and selective CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "2": "This study was designed to quantify the appropriate dose of midazolam relating to age and gender for intramuscular premedication. Three hundred and eighty-six consecutive patients (15-83 years) received midazolam (2.5-5.5 mg) with atropine 30 minutes prior to surgery. The perioperative effects of midazolam on arterial pressure as well as heart rate, SpO2 and amnesic effects of regional anesthesia were evaluated in patients divided to 10-year age intervals. Reduction of arterial pressure correlated with preanesthetic values (r = 0.515, P less than 0.01). Especially in those over 60 years, we observed significant reductions. Besides, compared with the males, the reduction was smaller in females. On the arrival at the operating room, this reduction recovered slightly, but preanesthetic hypertension was still attenuated effectively. After age 70, the SpO2 was lower, while the amnesic effect during regional anesthesia was significantly prominent. Amnesic effect correlated more with the dose than the dosage determined by body weight. Younger female patients required larger dosage determined by body weight than the corresponding male. As age increases, dose adjustment should be made mostly on the basis of age, and its adjustment on the basis of body weight should be made with great caution. In this study, we determined the appropriate dose of midazolam, 5 mg for those males younger than 60 years and females below 50 years, and 3-3.5 mg for those older than 80 years.", 
    "3": "The author presents case histories that demonstrate an approach to a spectrum of clinical scenarios that have common to them the complaint of insomnia. In the first, the physician is faced with an acute problem with an easily apparent, but superficial, etiology. The use of a benzodiazepine in this instance would be relatively noncontroversial. Its usage, without an exploration of the patient's perceptual frame, including psychosocial factors, would miss potentially important underlying problems. In the second case, the physician's concern about the habituating effects of benzodiazepines could have resulted in the underutilization of their benefits. The third case represents a scenario in which overutilization with resultant habituation was potentially a problem. It becomes apparent that an \"either/or\" generalization might hinder good patient outcome. Questioning around the symptom for purposes of gathering information regarding the patient's perceptual frame and the consequences of change may be useful in developing treatment strategies.", 
    "4": "Nonpharmacologic treatments that have been evaluated for insomnia are reviewed. These include sleep hygiene techniques, stimulus control instructions, sleep restriction, chronotherapy, bright light therapy, relaxation training, biofeedback, paradoxical intention, and cognitive therapy. Comparative studies of the different treatments indicate considerable overlap in effectiveness. Direct comparisons between treatments have shown stimulus control instructions to be more effective than either relaxation training or paradoxical intention. Further research is needed on the tailoring of treatments to patient needs, as are more detailed comparisons between pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.", 
    "5": "A careful medical evaluation is essential for any patient complaining of disturbed sleep so as to ascertain the contribution of possible metabolic, neurologic, or medication-related factors to symptom development. In this review, medical and neurologic conditions that may negatively affect sleep will be discussed as well as commonly offending medications. Special attention will be given to sleep apnea syndromes. The evaluation of sleep disturbance in the medical patient will be discussed with focus on of the special pharmacokinetic considerations involved in selecting medications for the treatment of disturbed sleep in this patient population.", 
    "6": "Insomnia is common in the elderly population. Difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep affects nearly half of all patients over the age of 65, representing an increased prevalence in older versus younger patients. Nocturnal sleep time is decreased, frequent awakenings occur, and daytime napping is common. Age-related changes in sleep physiology correlate with the subjective complaints of disturbed sleep. Multiple etiologies for insomnia in the elderly have been described. Management strategies must include attention to both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic aspects of care, especially with respect to the altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics associated with advanced age. Reassessing therapy is essential to promote the end goal of improvement of the elderly patient's quality of life.", 
    "7": "The most common adverse effects associated with the use of benzodiazepine hypnotics are residual daytime effects (daytime sedation and daytime performance decrements), anterograde amnesia, and rebound insomnia. Studies show that these adverse effects are related to dose. Hence, benzodiazepine hypnotics should be used in low doses so as to minimize or prevent these common adverse effects. It is now generally accepted that benzodiazepines should not be administered long-term for the treatment of chronic \"idiopathic\" insomnia. Two noncontinuous sleep disturbances, insomnia in the elderly and transient insomnia in young and middle-aged adults, are probably the most acceptable indications for the use of benzodiazepines. Low doses of short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines (triazolam and temazepam) are efficacious in the treatment of insomnia in the elderly, and preliminary evidence suggests that they are efficacious in the treatment of transient insomnia in young and middle-aged adults.", 
    "8": "In selecting a hypnotic for the symptomatic management of insomnia, clinicians should look for those that most favorably balance sleep induction and sleep maintenance with potential adverse side effects. While all benzodiazepines have demonstrated efficacy in nocturnal sedation, the side effects of different compounds--and different doses of the same compound--vary greatly. The most common adverse effects associated with benzodiazepines are residual sedation, anterograde amnesia, and rebound insomnia, which are also related to the insomnia complaint itself. Therefore, careful evaluation of the dose of a benzodiazepine hypnotic is the key to effective treatment of insomnia without inducement of adverse effects. The most common side effects of hypnotics and their relation to drug dose are reviewed.", 
    "9": "The pharmacodynamics of midazolam and its main metabolite alpha-hydroxymidazolam were characterized in individual subjects by use of saccadic eye movement and electroencephalographic (EEG) effect measurements. Eight healthy volunteers received 0.1 mg/kg midazolam intravenously in 15 minutes, 0.15 mg/kg alpha-hydroxymidazolam intravenously in 15 minutes, 7.5 mg midazolam orally and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, four-way crossover experiment. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam and 4-hydroxymidazolam were measured by gas chromatography. The amplitudes in the 11.5 to 30 Hz (beta) frequency band were used as EEG effect measure. The concentration-effect relationships were quantified by the sigmoid maximum effect model. The median effective concentrations of midazolam and alpha-hydroxymidazolam were (mean +/- SE) 77 +/- 15 and 98 +/- 17 ng/ml, respectively, for the EEG effect measure. For peak saccadic velocity the values were 40 +/- 7 ng/ml for midazolam and 49 +/- 10 ng/ml for alpha-hydroxymidazolam. The maximum effect values were similar for both compounds. The effects observed after oral administration of midazolam could not be predicted accurately by an additive and competitive interaction model. It seems that alpha-hydroxymidazolam is highly potent with respect to the measured effects and contributes significantly to those effects of midazolam after oral administration.", 
    "10": "We have assessed the profiles of plasma concentration of atracurium and its neuromuscular blocking effect on the first response of the train-of-four measured by electromyography after a short infusion of atracurium 0.25 mg kg-1, in 38 patients anaesthetized by one of three techniques. Measures of the temporal profile of neuromuscular block were found to correlate with pharmacokinetic variables. When anaesthetic technique was taken into account in a multivariate model, the time to onset of 10% deprssion of T1:T0 correlated positively with the central volume of distribution (P less than 0.05). The change in T1:T0 during the 1 min after 10% depression, and the logit of maximum depression were both correlated negatively with the central volume of distribution (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01, respectively). Both the times to 20% and 50% recovery of T1:T0 correlated strongly negatively with clearance (P less than 0.0001 for both measures). The findings support the conclusion that the effect of atracurium is dependent upon its disposition.", 
    "11": "Wakefulness and sleep are antagonistic states competing for the domain of brain activity. Non-REM sleep and REM sleep are different states of being, sustained by activity in brainstem nuclei, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and thalamus. Such complex phenomenology is subject to many alterations grouped in the new International Classification of Sleep Disorders. The insomnias are the result of interacting psychosocial, psychophysiologic, neurodevelopmental, and medical factors. Proper perspective of each factor provides the clinical strategies to approach medically the symptom-complex of insomnia. The most common cause of daytime hypersomnia is chronic sleep deprivation. Obstructive sleep apnea responds to nasal CPAP, but the failure rate approaches 30%. In intolerant patients BiPAP and surgical remedies should be considered. Motor and behavioral abnormalities of sleep may be linked to REM sleep as in the REM sleep behavior disorder. Paroxysmal nocturnal dystonia and nocturnal wanderings may be associated with epilepsy. Intrusions of one state of being (wakefulness, non-REM sleep, and REM sleep) into another result in mixed, poorly defined, or only partially developed states. Dissociation of states may be responsible for confusional arousals, hallucinations, and cateplexy. Senile degeneration of the suprachiasmatic nuclei may underlie the circadian rhythm changes in old age and the \"sundown\" syndrome in demented patients. Misalignment of the hypothalamic pacemaker causes dysregulation of sleep-related physiologic and behavioral variables. Exposure to bright light retrains the pacemaker in night-shift workers, transmeridian travelers, and in patients with seasonal affective syndrome. Benzodiazepine compounds are very effective hypnotics, but should be used sparingly in the elderly to avoid falls, memory lapses, and aggravation of a preexisting sleep apnea syndrome. Sleep laboratory evaluations are indicated in patients with hypersomnia, suspected sleep apnea syndrome, motor-behavioral disorders of sleep, and in many individuals complaining of insomnia.", 
    "12": "This study evaluated the discriminative stimulus effects of caffeine in humans. Nine normal male and female volunteers (ages 18-28) were trained to discriminate between the methylxanthine central nervous system stimulant caffeine (320 mg/70 kg, p.o.) and placebo. Monetary reinforcers were earned for identifying correctly the letter code associated with each substance. After four training sessions, the ability to discriminate between the two training conditions was tested for 20 sessions (test-of-acquisition). In subjects who met the criterion for discrimination (i.e., greater than or equal to 85% correct responding on greater than or equal to 4 consecutive sessions during the last 10 test-of-acquisition sessions) dose-effect curves for caffeine (0, 56, 100, 180, 240 and 320 mg/70 kg) and for the benzodiazepine triazolam (0, 0.10, 0.32 and 0.56 mg/70 kg) were determined. Seven of the nine subjects learned the caffeine-placebo discrimination and their performance improved across the 20 test-of-acquisition sessions. The training dose of caffeine (320 mg/70 kg) produced stimulant-like self-reports that differed from placebo when the letter codes were identified correctly, but not when the letter codes were identified incorrectly. Novel caffeine doses produced dose-related increases in caffeine-appropriate responding (N = 4), whereas triazolam produced predominantly placebo-appropriate responding (N = 3) and self-reports that differed from both caffeine and placebo. Throughout dose-effect curve determinations, the training dose of caffeine and placebo continued to be identified correctly (range: 84-100% correct responding). These results suggest that a caffeine (320 mg/70 kg)-placebo discrimination 1) can be acquired and maintained, 2) is related to self-reported drug effects if the training conditions are correctly identified and 3) has some pharmacological specificity.", 
    "13": "In guinea pig isolated ileum longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus, cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8S) produced a rapid (phasic) contraction followed by a slower tonic phase. The tetrapeptide derivative CCK-4 and pentagastrin elicited only the phasic response up to 10(-6) M, whereas the tonic phase was also apparent at higher concentrations. The rank order of potency for the effect of agonists on the tonic and phasic responses were CCK-8S much greater than gastrin greater than CCK-8US congruent to pentagastrin greater than CCK-4 and CCK-8S greater than gastrin congruent to pentagastrin greater than CCK-4 greater than CCK-8US, respectively. Phasic responses of CCK-8S and CCK-4 were sensitive to atropine, whereas the tonic response could be completely abolished with the neurokinin-1 antagonist GR82334. The CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 up to 10(-7) M had little effect on the phasic contracture of CCK-4. The CCK-B/gastrin receptor antagonist L-365,260 had no effect on the CCK-8S phasic response up to 10(-7) M, but antagonized the phasic response induced by low concentrations of CCK-4 in a competitive manner with an estimated pKB of 8.51. This value is close to that of 8.53 found in a guinea pig cortical binding assay. Both the second phase of the CCK-4 phasic concentration response curve (CRC) and the tonic contraction were insensitive to L-365,260.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "14": "Diazepam binding inhibitor-like immunoreactivity (DBI-LI) in normal and hypophysectomized (HPX) rat testis was studied by light and electron microscopic immunohistochemistry. In normal testis DBI-LI was observed in interstitial Leydig cells and Sertoli cells of most seminiferous tubules. At the electron microscopic level, DBI-LI was distributed throughout the cytoplasm of labeled cells; a concentration of the labeling product was observed in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparati, and the outer membrane of the mitochondria. In the seminiferous epithelium, labeled processes of Sertoli cells could be traced among developing germ cells. After HPX a gradual disappearance of DBI-LI was observed in all Leydig cells. The number of labeled Sertoli cells was reduced in the majority of tubules after HPX, whereas in some tubules the staining was only slightly reduced. Replacement therapy of the HPX animals with human CG prevented the disappearance of DBI-LI from Leydig cells, whereas replacement with FSH did not prevent the disappearance of DBI-LI in Leydig cells. In Sertoli cells replacement therapies were not effective in restoring DBI-LI. In rat testis DBI and mitochondrial benzodiazepine binding sites are highly concentrated in the Leydig cells. Mitochondrial benzodiazepine binding sites and DBI are involved in the regulation of steroid production. As the expression of DBI-LI is under the control of pituitary hormones, DBI may play a role as an endogenous regulator of intracellular metabolic functions, such as steroidogenesis, in rat testis.",

Twenty-five patients, mean age 56 +/- 8 years, underwent 3 randomized multistage bicycle exercise stress tests after intravenous administration of saline solution (2 ml), isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg) and pirenzepine (2 mg). Isosorbide dinitrate, an endothelium-independent coronary dilating agent, was used as a reference drug.

    "37": "The induction of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) in adult CNS and the resulting changes in polyamine levels are often observed under conditions associated with activation of NMDA receptors, calpain stimulation and spectrin degradation. The present study was directed at evaluating the links between these two sets of events. We measured the effects of an acute treatment of adult rats with difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an irreversible inhibitor of ODC, on biochemical alterations following kainate-induced seizure activity. Beside ODC activity and polyamine levels, we assayed the in situ spectrin degradation and the in vitro binding of 3H-Ro5-4864, a ligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites which is a good marker of glial proliferation, at various time intervals following systemic kainic acid (KA) injection. Kainate-induced seizure activity was followed by a transient increase in ODC activity, a long-lasting increase in putrescine levels and spectrin degradation, and a delayed increase in 3H-Ro5-4864 binding, mainly in hippocampus and piriform cortex. Treatment of the animals with DFMO markedly reduced the increase in putrescine levels up to 7 days after KA injection. It also reduced the increase in spectrin breakdown observed at 16 h but not at 4 and 7 days after KA injection. Finally, it did not modify the increase in 3H-Ro5-4864 binding measured 4 and 7 days after KA injection. The levels of putrescine were positively correlated with the extent of spectrin proteolysis in KA-treated animals whether or not they were treated with DFMO, at 16 h but not at 7 days after KA injection. The results indicate that the extent of spectrin breakdown observed shortly after KA-induced seizure activity is causally related to the changes in ODC activity and putrescine levels. Although the data are consistent with the idea that putrescine could be a marker for acute pathology, they do not support a role for polyamines in delayed neurotoxicity.", 
    "38": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS) are markedly increased in the injured CNS. Astrocytes appear to be the primary cell type which express increased PTBBS. Because certain cytokines within the injured CNS are potent mitogens for astrocytes, we examined the effects of two such cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), on PTBBS in cultured astrocytes using [3H]Ro 5-4864 as the specific ligand. Purified cultures of either polygonal or process-bearing astrocytes were prepared from neonatal rat cerebral hemispheres. At a concentration of 1.8 nM, specific binding of the radioactive ligand to polygonal astrocytes reached equilibrium within 60 min and was half-maximal by 5-10 min. By contrast, specific binding to process-bearing astrocytes barely exceeded background levels. IL-1 and TNF increased PTBBS within polygonal astrocytes in both dose- and time-dependent manners. At 10-50 ng/ml, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha elevated [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding in polygonal astrocyte cultures 65 and 87%, respectively, above the level in control cultures. However, no changes in PTBBS were seen within polygonal astrocytes after IL-2 treatment. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding experiments suggested that the increase in PTBBS promoted by TNF was due to an increased number of binding sites present in polygonal astrocytes and not due to an increase in receptor affinity. Binding data suggested that PTBBS within cultures of process-bearing astrocytes were virtually absent irrespective of the treatment. These in vitro data suggest that certain cytokines found in the injured brain may be involved in up-regulating PTBBS within a particular subtype of astrocyte.",

Flumazenil administration was followed by immediate rise of the CNS functions scores to almost the baseline awake values. Compared to control group, patients were significantly more oriented and had better comprehension up to 15 minutes, more alert for 30 minutes and had better memory function up to 60 minutes. Peripheral oxygen saturation was significantly higher up to 15 minutes. Flumazenil allows better utilization and higher turn over rate where space and nursing resources are scarce.", 
    "46": "Xanthotoxol (XT), 8-hydroxypsoralen, exhibited dose-graded sedative activity in dogs, cats, rats, mice and hamsters. At doses of 5-20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) in cats and 3-100 mg/kg orally (p.o.) in dogs, XT blocked predatory mouse/rat killing behavior. In mice, XT (10-300 mg/kg i.p.) exhibited a dose-dependent reduction in locomotor activity but was less potent in this regard than reference diazepam (10-100 mg/kg i.p.). XT in mice (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.p.) and in hamsters (0.1-10.0 mg/kg p.o.) antagonized amphetamine-induced hypermobility but was less potent than diazepam. XT elevated the electrical threshold in foot-shock-induced fighting behavior in rats. XT (0.1-30.0 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated pentobarbital-induced narcosis in hamsters at otherwise subeffective doses of pentobarbital. Conditioned avoidance responses in rats were not significantly altered with 1-3 mg/kg i.p. and 30-100 mg/kg p.o. doses of XT but 300 mg/kg p.o. blocked both conditioned and unconditioned response. Doses of 100-1000 mg/kg i.p. of XT in mice were used to study 48-h acute toxicity of XT and its LD50 was estimated to be 468 mg/kg. Doses of 10, 40 and 80 mg/kg p.o. were used to study the chronic toxicity of XT in rats for 6 months and no side effects or abnormalities in reproductive activity or endocrine integrity were noted. The F1 generation of rats from 6-month XT-treated parents were free of teratogenic effects.", 
    "47": "Responsibility for many of the problems of intravenous drug abuse and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection lies with community care agencies, such as general practitioners, community psychiatric and district nurses and drug agencies. It is in general practice that this burden is most clearly observed, given that general practitioners are in charge of the day-to-day care of patients. In an attempt to quantify this workload in an inner city practice with 11,200 patients, data were gathered from several sources relating to drug use and HIV infection. The study identified 432 patients who had consulted with problems of drug abuse and/or HIV infection over the period 1981-90. Among this group of patients 161 (37%) were HIV antibody positive. Among 191 drug abusers who were still registered with the practice in 1990 dihydrocodeine was the most commonly prescribed substitute treatment (130 patients) and only nine patients were prescribed methadone. Forty seven per cent of drug users continued to inject drugs occasionally. However, analysis of urine samples revealed that there was a shift away from injecting mainly heroin to multiple drug use, including benzodiazepines, usually originating from prescribed sources. Drug abusers who were HIV positive consulted their general practitioner significantly more often over one year than those who were not (mean 24.9 versus 15.8 consultations, P < 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between these two groups in terms of days spent in hospital. A total of 61 patients were referred to a community psychiatric nurse over an eight month period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "To clarify a relationship between dopamine neuron and purine, GABA or benzodiazepine system, we have studied the changes in the threshold of tonic convulsion induced by each antagonist after chronic treatment with haloperidol in mice. Mice were given haloperidol (1 mg/kg, sc) once a day for 19 d and challenged with caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist), beta-DMCM (beta-carboline derivative: as a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist), picrotoxin (a Cl- channel blocker) or bicuculline (a GABAa receptor antagonist) 30 min, 24 h and 48 h after the last injection of haloperidol. Only the threshold of beta-DMCM-induced tonic convulsion was lowered and it was reversed 7 d after the last injection. The beta-DMCM-induced convulsions on 2 d withdrawal were reversed by diazepam (2.5 mg/kg, ip; a benzodiazepine receptor agonist), Ro15-1788 (5.0 mg/kg, ip; as like a benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist), muscimol (2.0 mg/kg, ip; a GABAa receptor agonist) or apomorphine (0.25 and 2.0 mg/kg, ip; a dopamine receptor agonist). These results suggest that the lowering effect of chronic haloperidol on seizure threshold may be involved in the development of tolerance to haloperidol. It may implicate in direct interactions between benzodiazepine and dopamine or GABA systems but may not between dopamine and GABA neurons in development of lowering seizure threshold following chronic haloperidol treatment.", 
    "49": "Anxiolytic drugs, such as the benzodiazepines and the azapirones (ipsapirone, gepirone, buspirone), are well known to affect states of vigilance and to decrease the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus in rats. In order to examine whether the newly developed 5-HT3 antagonists with potential anxiolytic properties act through similar mechanisms, the effects of several of such antagonists: MDL 72222, ICS 205-930, ondansetron and/or zacopride on both sleep-wakefulness and the discharge of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus were investigated in rats. When tested in a wide range of doses (0.05-10 mg/kg, i.p.), none of these drugs significantly affected the states of vigilance, except ondansetron, at 0.1 mg/kg, which increased paradoxical sleep for the first 2 hr after administration and MDL 72222, at 10 mg/kg, which reduced both paradoxical and slow wave sleep and increased wakefulness for the same initial period after treatment. In vivo, in chloral hydrate anaesthetized rats, as well as in vitro, in slices of brain stem, none of the 5-HT3 antagonists tested affected the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones. Similarly, no change in the electrical activity of serotoninergic neurones could be evoked in vitro by superfusion of the tissue with the 5-HT3 agonists, phenylbiguanide (10 microM) and 2-methyl-5-HT (1 microM). At a larger concentration (10 microM), the latter compound reduced the neuronal discharge probably through the stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors since this effect, as that of ipsapirone, could be prevented by 10 microM l-propranolol. Comparison of these data with those obtained with benzodiazepines and 5-HT1A agonists of the azapirone series, supports the concept that different mechanisms are responsible for the anxiolytic-like properties of 5-HT3 agonists, compared to those of other anxiolytic drugs.",

The antiarrhythmic effect of the agent was found during 24-day monitoring and simulated psychoemotional stress in 81% of patients with neurocirculatory dystonia and in 61% of patients with coronary heart disease. The antiarrhythmic effects developed with gidazepam-induced changes in electrophysiological properties of the cardiac conduction system. The preventive antiarrhythmic effect of gidazepam was demonstrated to be higher than that of ethacizin during stress in patients with arrhythmias of extra-ischemic genesis.",

    "52": "1. Temazepam was administered by aerosol using a standard protocol to healthy volunteers. Two studies are reported in which different dosage formulations were used: a) 30 mg of the 5 mu diameter particle (n = 6); b) 10 mg of the 2 mu diameter particle (n = 6). 2. An open crossover design was followed in each study. On one occasion in both studies subjects used a gargling procedure to remove drug which had been deposited in the mouth and oropharynx. 3. Serial venous blood samples were drawn for a period of 24 h. The mean total AUC of the 5 mu preparation was significantly reduced by gargling (3153 ng ml-1 h to 1066 ng ml-1 h) (F = 0.32). Gargling also had a significant effect on the mean AUC(0-1 h). 4. In contrast gargling had no significant effect on the mean AUC associated with the smaller diameter particle preparation (630 ng ml-1 h) vs 397 ng ml-1 h (F = 0.74). 5. These findings also indicate that temazepam deposition in the pulmonary tree is enhanced by the use of a 2 mu rather than a 5 mu diameter particle. However, the plasma drug concentrations achieved are unlikely to produce a sufficiently marked sedative effect for endoscopic investigations such as gastroscopy.", 
    "53": "Ondansetron is a highly selective 5-HT3 antagonist, which has recently become available for the control of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Since 5-HT3 receptors not only have a high density in the area postrema but also in the hippocampal and amygdala region of the limbic system, it has been suspected that 5-HT3 selective agents have psychotropic effects. In animal models of anxiety ondansetron showed a benzodiazepine-like anxiolytic effect without any sedation or withdrawal effects. Other states of withdrawal have been prevented with ondansetron. This agent might also exert neuroleptic effects since dopaminergic hyperactivity in the mesolimbic system was antagonised by ondansetron. In different models of memory and learning a positive effect on basal learning behaviour and on scopolamine-induced memory impairment was noted. This manuscript reviews essential pharmacological and behavioural effects of ondansetron as well as preliminary data from clinical studies. The role of highly-selective ligands for a more differentiated view of serotonergic subsystems are discussed.", 
    "54": "Poly(A)+ RNA from rat cerebral cortex expresses gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-activated membrane current responses in Xenopus oocytes, mediated by GABAA receptors (IG-Actx). In contrast, RNA from bovine retina expresses GABA responses composed of two pharmacologically distinct Cl- currents, one mediated by GABAA receptors (IG-Aret) and the other by atypical GABA receptors that are resistant to bicuculline and are not activated by baclofen (IG-BR). The pharmacology of the bicuculline/baclofen-insensitive GABA receptors was further investigated by comparing actions of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) enantiomers on GABA-activated membrane currents expressed in oocytes by brain and retina RNA. gamma-HCH (lindane) was a potent inhibitor of IG-Actx, with suppression of currents detectable at concentrations as low as 50 nM. The IC50 for gamma-HCH, calculated from inhibitory effects on maximum IG-Actx (current elicited by 3 mM GABA), was 7.3 +/- 3 microM. Inhibitory effects of gamma-HCH on IG-Aret were qualitatively similar to those described for IG-Actx. In contrast, alpha-HCH and delta-HCH induced clear positive modulation of IG-Actx elicited by low (e.g., 10 microM) concentrations of GABA. Thresholds for the modulatory effects of alpha-HCH and delta-HCH were between 100 and 300 nM, with maximum levels of potentiation (5-7-fold) between 20-50 microM. Potentiation of IG-Actx by alpha- and delta-HCH was reversible and largely insensitive to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (1 microM). Assays on maximum IG-Actx indicated that alpha-HCH (10-100 microM) caused only marginal reductions in response (less than or equal to 15%), whereas delta-HCH had stronger inhibitory effects (IC50, 20-30 microM). At concentrations between 0.1 and 50 microM, beta-HCH induced only 10-25% facilitation of IG-Actx elicited by 10 microM GABA and had no clear effects on maximum responses. IG-BR was also potently inhibited by gamma-HCH. Thresholds for detecting reductions in current were approximately 20 nM, and the IC50 calculated from effects on maximum responses was 5.8 +/- 2 microM. However, neither alpha-HCH nor delta-HCH (1-100 microM) induced any potentiation of IG-BR. alpha-HCH had some weak inhibitory effects that were largely surmountable, whereas delta-HCH and beta-HCH were essentially inactive. These experiments raise the possibility that alpha- and delta-HCH constitute a novel class of GABAA receptor modulators, which might prove to be useful for investigating the mechanisms underlying regulation of GABAA receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "55": "The reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is the target enzyme for the tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]- benzodiazepin-2(1H)one and thione (TIBO) derivatives, a class of highly potent and selective anti-HIV agents that specifically inhibit HIV-1 but not HIV-2 replication. The amino acid sequence divergence may be held responsible for the differential sensitivity of HIV-1 RT and HIV-2 RT to the TIBO derivatives. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have introduced several amino acid substitutions in the conserved regions of HIV-1 RT. Where applicable, the amino acids were replaced by the corresponding amino acids present in HIV-2 RT. The amino acid residues Y181 and Y188 appeared to be critical for the anti-HIV-1 RT activity of the TIBO derivatives, since substitution of these residues by the corresponding HIV-2 amino acids I181 and L188 resulted in a virtual loss of TIBO sensitivity without loss of enzymatic activity.",

    "57": "The action of diazepam, meprobamate, trioxazine and mexidol on bioelectrical activity of sensorimotor cortex and dorsal hippocamp of the left and right hemisphere of the brain in conscious rat in free behavior has been studied. All the drugs produced a decline in the frequency of the dominant peak of EEG power spectra. Diazepam and meprobamate increased beta-activity. It is concluded that the decreased frequency may be due to an anxiolytic effect of the tranquilizers, whereas high beta-activity is related to muscle relaxant effect of some drugs.", 
    "58": "Familial startle disease (also known as hyperekplexia and congenital \"stiff-man\" syndrome) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by an exaggerated startle reaction of sudden, unexpected auditory or tactile stimuli; affected neonates also have severe and occasionally fatal hypertonia. We recently encountered a large, five-generation family with startle disease, and treated 16 patients (including 1 neonate) with clonazepam; all experienced dramatic and sustained improvement. We performed systematic linkage analysis in this family, and found tight linkage between the disease locus and a polymorphic genetic marker locus (colony-stimulating factor receptor, or CSF1R) that has been physically mapped to chromosome 5q33-q35. The maximum odds ratio favoring linkage over nonlinkage is greater than 10,000,000:1 (lod score, 7.10) at 3% recombination. Several genes encoding neurotransmitter receptor components have been physically mapped to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 5q, and are thus candidates for the startle disease gene. The availability of additional large pedigrees with startle disease should facilitate identification and characterization of the gene for this disorder.", 
    "59": "In order to compare the beta blockers bisoprolol and diazepam in the treatment of cardiac neurosis, 40 patients (16 males and 24 females, mean age: 39 +/- 11 years) were examined in a double-blind, crossover study. Following a 4-week placebo period, patients were randomized to receive either bisoprolol 10 mg daily or diazepam 5 mg twice daily for 4 weeks. After a second 4-week washout period on placebo, patients were switched to the alternative regimen for a further 4 weeks. At the end of the placebo periods and during each phase of treatment, the following parameters were evaluated: somatic symptoms by self-assessment questionnaire, anxiety state by Hamilton rating scale, reaction time to both acoustic and visual stimuli, blood pressure, and heart rate. Both treatments were effective in reducing somatic symptoms of cardiac neurosis, but bisoprolol was significantly more effective than diazepam (p less than 0.01). On the contrary, diazepam was superior to bisoprolol in improving the Hamilton scale related to psychic symptoms. Only diazepam prolonged reaction times. Both treatments were well tolerated; however, 12 patients complained of drowsiness and nine of sedation under diazepam. In conclusion, bisoprolol appeared to be as effective as diazepam in the treatment of cardiac neurosis, but with better effects on somatic symptoms and without affecting patients' psychomotor performance.", 
    "60": "Both alpha 2-adrenergic agonists and benzodiazepines exert anxiolytic and sedative effects when administered as preoperative medications. Clinical effects achieved with a combination of drugs, representative of these classes of compounds, is greater than that which could be expected from a simple additive response. Therefore, we investigated the nature of the interaction between dexmedetomidine, the highly-selective alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, and midazolam in a series of in vivo and in vitro studies in rats. Rats were administered midazolam, dexmedetomidine, or a combination of midazolam and dexmedetomidine intravenously to derive three dose-response curves for loss of righting reflex (LRR). LRR was determined in rats in a rotating cage (4 rotations/min) by observing whether the rat failed to maintain its upright posture for greater than or equal to 15 s exactly 2.5 min after drug administration. The effect of either flumazenil (benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) or atipamezole (the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist) on the LRR was also determined. A probit analysis was performed and an isobologram for the ED50 was derived to assess the nature of the interaction. Rat brain membranes were prepared for receptor binding assays using [3H]-flumazenil and [3H]-rauwolscine to characterize the benzodiazepine and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, respectively. The ability of either midazolam or dexmedetomidine to displace the radiolabeled ligand from the alternative receptor was assessed. To detect a possible kinetic interaction between the two drugs, separate cohorts of rats were administered the two drugs individually or in combination at the combination ED50 doses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "A quantitative structure-activity relationship study was carried out for the binding of a series of 'classical' benzodiazepines (BZs) and some beta-carbolines with BZ receptors to investigate the active sites in the latter and the nature of the binding of compounds with them. Using the Hansch approach, an attempt was made to correlate binding affinities of compounds with various physico-chemical and electronic properties of substituents. The correlations obtained showed the main roles were played by the hydrophobic constant pi and the Hammett constant sigma (an electronic parameter) of various substituents. This led to the suggestion that BZ receptors have many additional hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding and polar sites other than those suggested by Hollinshead et al. (1990). From the present study, the Hollinshead model of interaction was found to be inadequate to account fully for the binding of all types of compounds.", 
    "62": "Effects of monensin were examined on the intracellular processing of the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor (GABAA/BZDR) in neuron cultures derived from embryonic chicken brain, using 3H-flunitrazepam as the probe for the benzodiazepine modulator site on the receptor. Incubation of cultures with 0.1 or 1 microM monensin for 3 h blocked the binding of 3H-flunitrazepam by about 18%. Loss of ligand binding was due to a reduction in the number of binding sites, with no significant changes in receptor affinity. The general cellular protein synthesis and glycosylation in the cells were inhibited by 26% and 56%, respectively, in the presence of 1 microM monensin, as detected by assaying the incorporation of 3H-leucine and 3H-galactose. In contrast, an increase was observed for mannose incorporation by the cultures in the presence of the drug. Moreover, the results from in situ trypsinization of the cultures following monensin treatment showed that monensin did not alter the distribution of intracellular and surface receptors. The data suggest that monensin induces the down-regulation of GABAA/BZDR by generating abnormal glycosylation of the receptor and interrupting its transport within the Golgi apparatus, as well as from the Golgi apparatus to the intracellular pool and cell membrane. The galactosylation of receptor proteins may be important for the maturation of the receptor.",

All the tested compounds are essentially lacking in this ability, except for B.1, which inhibited binding of [3H]diazepam in 50% of the trials at 2.5 microM. The structure of B.1, with a 1,2,3-triazole ring with acidic properties, supports the hypothesis proposed for binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site. Comparison of B.1 with 1,2,3-triazole derivatives bearing a bicyclic substituent in position 1 of the heterocyclic ring suggests that a high steric hindrance increases the affinity of a compound for the benzodiazepine receptor.",

For comparison perfusion SPECT studies with 99mTc-HMPAO were done and a quantitative ROI analysis of the data performed. This quantitative analysis consisted of calculation of right-to-left ratios for 123I-Iomazenil SPECTs, whereby values of 1 were obtained with narrow standard deviations. ROI measurements of the medial occipital, frontal and parietal cortex, the cerebellum and white matter showed a pattern of benzodiazepine receptor concentration in concordance with that previously found in PET and autoradiographic studies, if 123I-Iomazenil ROIs were normalized to the corresponding 99mTc-HMPAO ROIs.

    "66": "We examined the linkage of cholinergic receptors to the phosphoinositide signaling pathway to elucidate one facet of the autonomic response mechanism in fetal and adult sheep. Cholinergic stimulation with carbachol increases the production of 3H-inositol mono-, bis-, and trisphosphates in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in both fetal and adult myocardium. However, the maximal stimulation of inositol polyphosphates above basal activity was much greater in fetal (120 +/- 11%) than in adult (20 +/- 7%) myocardium (mean +/- SEM). Saturation binding analysis of myocardial muscarinic receptors using 3H-N-methylscopolamine revealed significantly higher receptor concentration in fetal (240 +/- 25 fmol/mg protein) than in adult (78 +/- 15 fmol/mg protein) myocardium (mean +/- SEM). Binding competition studies revealed a pattern of selectivity-atropine less than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide less than pirenzepine less than or equal to (4-hydroxy-2-butynyl)-1-trimethylammonium m-chlorocarbanilate chloride less than or equal to 11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)-methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one 116-compatible with the presence of muscarinic receptor (MR)2, MR3, and/or MR5 subtypes. Receptor subtype determination by Northern blot analysis revealed mRNA specific for the MR2 subtype in both fetal and adult myocardium, although expression was greater in fetal heart. We conclude that decreases in MR2 subtype protein and mRNA levels parallel the age-related decrease in carbachol-stimulated PLC activity. Our studies demonstrate differences between fetal and adult myocardium in the concentration of muscarinic cholinergic receptors and their linkage to a putative calcium mobilizing signaling pathway and suggest that this pathway may play a different role in the fetus than in the adult.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The randomized clinical trial (RCT) is the preferred method for assessing the efficacy of treatments. Recent ethical and logistical criticisms suggest that new variations of the traditional RCT are needed. Some of these criticisms may be addressed with new hybrid designs that combine random assignment with assignment by one or more cutoff values on a baseline variable (e.g., severity of illness). In a simple version of such a \"cutoff-based\" RTC, persons scoring below a cutoff score on a baseline measure (i.e., the least severely ill) are automatically assigned to the control-treated group, those scoring above a second, higher cutoff (i.e., the most ill) are automatically assigned to the test-treated group, and those scoring in the interval between the cutoff scores (i.e., the moderately ill) are randomly assigned to either group. Depending on the baseline score, the patient is assigned to treatment either randomly or by the need-based, clinically related baseline score. Six cutoff-based design variations are studied via simulations and compared with the traditional RCT and the single-cutoff (i.e., regression-discontinuity) design. All variations yield unbiased estimates of the treatment effect but estimates differ in efficiency, with the RCT being most efficient and the single-cutoff design being least efficient. Secondary analyses of data from the Cross-National Collaborative Study of the Effects of Alprazolam (Xanax) on panic are conducted for each variation by selectivity discarding cases from the original dataset to stimulate cutoff-based assignment. The results confirm the simulations and illustrate how cutoff-based designs might look with real data.", 
    "68": "Many neurotransmitter receptors bind agonists with high affinity (Kd in the nanomolar range), whereas micromolar concentrations of the same agonists are required to elicit a functional effect. We have identified low affinity agonist binding sites for the gamma-amino-butyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-chloride channel under conditions normally used in 36Cl- uptake assays (a measure of receptor function). The GABAA agonist [3H]muscimol bound to a population of receptors with a Kd (2 microM) similar to its EC50 value for 36Cl- uptake. Binding was inhibited by the GABA agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol and by the GABA antagonist bicuculline methiodide. A reduction in the number of [3H]muscimol binding sites (Bmax) by a thiol-modifying reagent produced a corresponding decrease in the Emax for muscimol. The benzodiazepine diazepam enhanced the potency of muscimol in ion flux experiments but did not alter the affinity of [3H]muscimol binding sites. We propose that benzodiazepines enhance GABAergic function by increasing receptor-ion channel coupling, rather than by increasing GABAA receptor affinity. These studies suggest that the study of physiologically relevant (low affinity) binding sites is necessary when examining regulation of receptors by cellular processes, drugs, and disease.", 
    "69": "The \"revolution\" in pharmacologic treatment of insomnia began in 1970 with the availability of flurazepam, the first of the benzodiazepine hypnotics. Flurazepam largely replaced all other hypnotics during the decade of the 1970s. The second revolution began in the early 1980s as shorter half-life hypnotics, triazolam and temazepam, became available and began to replace flurazepam. The decade of the 1990s will probably see a more balanced pattern of benzodiazepine hypnotic use, as well as use of newer nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. Among available benzodiazepines, all have the capacity to produce dose- and concentration-dependent sedation, drowsiness, performance impairment, and amnesia. Benzodiazepine-induced amnestic effects are characterized by either impairment of information acquisition, impairment of consolidation and storage, or both. In general, apparent clinical differences among benzodiazepine hypnotics are explained by differences in pharmacokinetic properties of absorption, distribution, elimination, and clearance.", 
    "70": "Agonists at the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) produce their effects through potentiation of the inhibitory alpha-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission in the central nervous system via positive allosteric modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor. Agonists with high intrinsic efficacy are anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and sedative, whereas agonists with low intrinsic efficacy (partial agonists) are predominantly anticonvulsant and anxiolytic, but antagonize muscle relaxant and sedative effects of full agonists. The four BZR ligands triazolam, diazepam, Ro 19-8022 (a benzoquinolizinone) and bretazenil (Ro 16-6028, an imidazobenzodiazepinone) were pharmacologically characterized in various neurological and behavioral paradigms in mice: two anticonvulsant tests (prevention of audiogenic and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures), a conflict test which reveals both anxiolytic and sedative properties and two tests which mainly measure motor impairment (rotarod and horizontal wire test). Although triazolam and diazepam elicited an effect in all tests, Ro 19-8022 and bretazenil exhibited anticonvulsant and anxiolytic properties, but virtually failed to induce motor impairment and severe sedation. In separate experiments, fractional BZR occupancy in vivo was assessed by inhibition of [3H]flumazenil binding and correlated with the pharmacological effects. Although diazepam and triazolam produced effects beginning at low to intermediate fractional BZR occupancy, Ro 19-8022 and bretazenil required a higher BZR occupancy to do so, in accordance with their partial agonistic character. With the two full agonists, anticonvulsant and anticonflict activities were elicited at a lower fractional BZR occupancy than muscle relaxant and sedative effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Intrinsic efficacy is the inherent ability of a ligand to induce the conformational change of its receptor that is required to transduce the event of signal recognition into a physiologically relevant response. Relating fractional receptor occupancy to fractional effect is an indirect but reliable way to assess relative intrinsic efficacy. The receptor studied was the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR), a modulatory site on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor-chloride channel. The relationship between fractional BZR occupancy, as assessed by inhibition of [3H]flumazenil binding, and potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx into membrane vesicles of rat cerebral cortex was evaluated for four ligands under identical experimental conditions. Triazolam and the quinolizinone Ro 19-8022 potentiated the effect of GABA maximally by nearly 50%, diazepam by about 40% and bretazenil by approximately 20%. Potentiation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux by 25% was observed at about 35% BZR occupancy for diazepam, about 45% for triazolam and about 95% for Ro 19-8022. Bretazenil did not produce 25% potentiation even at receptor saturation. Although the curves relating fractional BZR occupancy to GABA potentiation were hyperbolic and nearly superimposable for triazolam and diazepam, those for Ro 19-8022 and bretazenil displayed parabolic characteristics by inducing an effect only at very high BZR occupancy, reflecting the partial agonistic profile of the latter two compounds. The rank order of relative intrinsic efficacy determined in this study was: triazolam congruent to diazepam much greater than Ro 19-8022 greater than bretazenil.", 
    "72": "An experimental model to study synthesis of cholesterol and pregnenolone from the precursor mevalonolactone (MVA) was developed in C6-2B glioma cells. The steroidogenic capability of this cell line and the regulation of pregnenolone production by 4'-chlorodiazepam (4'CD), a specific ligand for the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor (MDR), were investigated. Cells maintained in serum-free media were incubated with lovastatin (20 microM) and two inhibitors of pregnenolone metabolism, trilostane (25 microM) and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4-oxo-7-chloro-2-naphthylpyridine (10 microM). Under these conditions the incorporation of [3H]MVA into cholesterol and pregnenolone formation was biphasic, with an initial rapid phase (within 1 min) followed by a slower phase. Cholesterol and pregnenolone were identified by coelution with authentic steroids from a Si 60 Lichrosorb column and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Pregnenolone synthesis in intact C6-2B glioma cells was stimulated by nanomolar concentrations of 4'CD after 5 min of incubation with MVA. The stimulatory effect was dependent on drug concentration and the maximal effect was achieved at 10 nM. The time course showed that the incorporation of MVA into pregnenolone is accelerated by the MDR ligand. Cholesterol synthesis is only slightly and not significantly affected by 4'CD. These results support the view that steroid synthesis occurs in a glioma cell line. Moreover, we provide evidence for a rapid steroid synthesis in C6-2B glioma cells, which in turn appears to be accelerated by 1-100 nM 4'CD, a MDR ligand.", 
    "73": "The C6-2B glioma cell line, rich in mitochondrial receptors that bind with high affinity to benzodiazepines, imidazopyridines, and isoquinolinecarboxamides (previously called peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors), was investigated as a model to study the significance of the polypeptide diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and the putative DBI processing products on mitochondrial receptor-regulated steroidogenesis. DBI and its naturally occurring fragments have been found to be present in high concentrations in C6-2B glioma cells, to compete against specific isoquinolinecarboxamide or 4'-chlorodiazepam binding to mitochondrial recognition sites with high affinity, and to stimulate mitochondrial pregnenolone formation. These data suggest that this cell type may express both the receptor and the putative agonist ligand to regulate steroidogenesis. Therefore, we propose to term this mitochondrial receptor MDR (mitochondrial DBI receptor) to indicate its responsiveness to DBI in steroid biosynthesis. In the present work, we show that mitochondria of C6-2B cells convert (22R)-22-hydroxycholesterol to pregnenolone by a mechanism blocked by aminoglutethimide. Immunoblotting confirmed the presence of relatively high levels of cytochrome P-450 cholesterol side-chain-cleavage enzyme in C6-2B cell mitochondria. Furthermore, isoquinolinecarboxamide binding sites associated with the 18-kDa mitochondrial polypeptide subunit of the MDR are abundant in C6-2B glioma cell mitochondria (Bmax approximately 30 pmol/mg protein) and are coupled to the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. Occupancy of MDRs with nanomolar concentrations of the naturally occurring polypeptide, DBI, as well as its naturally occurring processing product tetratriacontaneuropeptide [DBI-(17-50)] increases pregnenolone formation. Clonazepam and octadecaneuropeptide [DBI-(33-50)], which exhibit a higher affinity for gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors but a low affinity for MDR, were ineffective in stimulating pregnenolone synthesis. These findings provide evidence that C6-2B cells exhibit a significant steroidogenic activity which resembles that found in peripheral endocrine organs and they suggest that MDRs and DBI are involved in the regulation of glial cell steroidogenesis.", 
    "74": "Tremor rats begin to exhibit clinical or electrical absence-like seizures after 6 weeks of age, and by 14 weeks of age, all have seizures. Central-type benzodiazepine receptor binding was investigated in tremor rats and control rats, aged 4 weeks and 16 weeks. Significantly lower benzodiazepine receptor density and no differences in affinity were found in the hippocampus of the tremor rats in comparison with that of control rats at both ages. This abnormality is considered to be due to a tremor gene and may be the cause of absence-like seizures in tremor rats. A significantly lower receptor density was found in the cerebellum at 4 weeks of age in the tremor rats than in the control rats. These changes may be related to tremorous movements in the tremor rats. Receptor density was significantly lower in the brainstems of tremor rats and control rats at 16 weeks of age than at 4 weeks of age, and the decrease was more marked in control rats. These facts may reflect a reduced decrease in the response to the dysfunction of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic neurons, or the function of the gamma-aminobutyric acid/benzodiazepine receptor system may be secondarily increased to suppress seizures in 16-week-old tremor rats.", 
    "75": "Equilibrium binding interactions at the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine recognition sites on the GABAA receptor-Cl- ionophore complex were studied using a vesicular synaptoneurosome (microsacs) preparation of rat brain in a physiological HEPES buffer similar to that applied successfully in recent GABAergic 36Cl- flux measurements. NO 328, a GABA reuptake inhibitor, was included in the binding assays to prevent the uptake of [3H]muscimol. Under these conditions, the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) values for [3H]muscimol and [3H]diazepam bindings are 1.9 microM and 40 nM, respectively. Binding affinities for these and other GABA and benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists correlate well with the known physiological doses required to elicit functional activity. This new in vitro binding protocol coupled with 36Cl- flux studies should prove to be of value in reassessing the pharmacology of the GABAA receptor complex in a more physiological environment.", 
    "76": "Chemicals that are active at the benzodiazepine receptor (endozepines) are naturally present in the CNS. These substances are present in tissue from humans and animals and in plants and fungi. Using selective extraction protocols, HPLC purification, receptor binding displacement studies, and selective anti-benzodiazepine antibodies, we have identified six or seven peaks of endozepines in rat and human brain. All material could competitively displace [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar benzodiazepine binding sites. Two peaks also competitively displaced Ro 5-4864 binding to the mitochondrial benzodiazepine binding site. Total amounts of brain endozepines were estimated to be present in potentially physiological concentrations, based on their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Although endozepine peaks 1 and 2 had HPLC retention profiles similar to those of nordiazepam and diazepam, respectively, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as well as high-performance TLC revealed biologically insignificant amounts of diazepam (less than 0.02 pg/g) and nordiazepam (less than 0.02 pg/g) in the purified material. Electrophysiologically, some purified endozepines positively modulated gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) action on Cl- conductance, monitored in patch-clamped cultured cortical neurons or in mammalian cells transfected with cDNA encoding various GABAA receptor subunits. These studies demonstrate that mammalian brains contain endozepines that could serve as potent endogenous positive allosteric modulators of GABAA receptors.", 
    "77": "Intermittent prophylaxis with oral diazepam is presented as an optional treatment for febrile seizures. This proposition is justified by the severe side effects of the currently used chronic anticonvulsant drug therapy in febrile seizures (phenobarbital and valproate). Nineteen patients aged between 3 months and 5 years were treated. They had either simple or complex febrile seizures. Sixteen patients had at least one prognostic factor for recurrence of febrile seizures: first febrile seizure before 15 months of age, positive family history for epilepsy or febrile seizures, occurrence of a complex febrile seizure or abnormal neurological examination. Three patients had none (cases 8, 12 and 13). We recommended 2.5mg b.i.d. for children younger than 12 months, 5mg b.i.d. for children older than 12 months and younger than 3 years, and 7.5 b.i.d. for children older than 3 years. The results showed that only one patient had febrile convulsions while taking adequate diazepam dosage. Transient side effects occurred in 36.8% of the cases.", 
    "78": "Forty-two patients with postgastroresection peptic ulcers of the zone of gastrojejunal anastomoses were examined. The cause of the appearance of the ulcers was the action of aggressive content of the gastric stump on the jejunum in the area of anastomosis. \"Vagal\" peptic ulcers were found by the gastrocepin test. After operations reducing the stump acidity healing of all the ulcers was noted. In achlorhydria of the stump the digestion in it is realized due to reflux at the expense of pancreas proteinases.", 
    "79": "Introduction of a socially naive male rat into the home territory of a resident counterpart results in agonistic interactions, leading to the rapid social defeat of the intruder. Exposure to the aggressive resident produces a stress-response profile consisting of neuroendocrine activation and coping behaviors such as submission. The present studies examined the dependence of these adaptive responses on endogenous brain Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF), a peptide hormone known to coordinate neuronally mediated- and pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. The Elevated Plus-Maze was employed as an animal model of emotionality in which stressors reduce subsequent exploration of open maze arms without walls in favor of enclosed maze arms. A CRF antagonist, alpha-hel CRF9-41, administered intracerebroventricularly (5 and 25 micrograms i.c.v.) immediately post-stress and 5 min prior to maze testing reversed the heightened emotionality produced by the resident exposure stressor. This action paralleled that of an anxiolytic dose of the short-acting benzodiazepine, midazolam (1.5 mg/kg i.p.). Intra-amygdaloid administration of lower doses of the CRF antagonist (125, 250 and 500 ng i.c.) also reversed, dose-dependently, the effect of exposure to an aggressive resident without altering the behavior of unstressed control animals. Further, the enhanced release of ACTH and corticosterone following social conflict was not modified over the short term by the intra-amygdaloid dose of CRF antagonist (250 ng i.c.) which was effective in reversing stress-induced hyper-emotionality. These results suggest that limbic system CRF substrates exert an anxiogenic effect on the exploratory behavior of socially defeated rats via a pituitary-adrenal-independent mechanism.", 
    "80": "Several lines of investigation strongly support the notion that panic disorder afflicts at least one third of patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries and unexplained chest pain. Panic disorder is a common problem, affecting 1-2% of the U.S. population. Current research suggests an etiology that is both psychophysiologic and cognitive. The locus ceruleus and cortico-releasing factor are implicated in the biological circuit associated with panic attacks, while psychological research indicates that catastrophic thinking, phobic responses to somatic sensations, and repressed anger, grief, and traumatic events play a part in triggering attacks. Treatment consists of pharmacologic interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines, as well as psychotherapeutic work focusing on catastrophic thinking and repressed anger, grief responses, and other traumatic experiences.", 
    "81": "The effects of the cyclopyrrolones suriclone and RP 59037 on body temperature were investigated in male TO mice. The full agonist suriclone (3, 10, 30 mg/kg i.p.) produced significant hypothermia which was inhibited by concurrent administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists of both benzodiazepine (flumazenil; 10 mg/kg i.p.) and beta-carboline (ZK 93426; 3 mg/kg i.p.) structure. The response to suriclone (10 mg/kg i.p.) was also attenuated by benzodiazepine (Ro 17-1812; 10 mg/kg i.p.) and beta-carboline (ZK 91296; 30 mg/kg i.p.) partial agonists - which have no effect on body temperature per se. In contrast with these compounds, the cyclopyrrolone partial agonist RP 59037 (10, 30 mg/kg i.p.) produced significant hypothermia itself (although it was much less efficacious in this respect than the full agonist) and at a dose of 30 mg/kg failed to block the decrease in body temperature induced by suriclone (10 mg/kg i.p.). Thus suriclone acts as a full agonist at benzodiazepine receptors in the body temperature paradigm. RP 59037 possesses some partial agonist properties in this model, however, it appears to have greater intrinsic activity than other partial agonists tested previously.", 
    "82": "The muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 has been used to characterize the muscarinic receptors on somata of adult cockroach dorsal unpaired median (DUM) neurones maintained in short-term culture. Pressure application of McN-A-343 onto isolated DUM neurones induced a dose- and voltage-dependent biphasic response composed of a fast initial hyperpolarization followed by a slow depolarizing phase, recorded with the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell recording configuration. The fast hyperpolarization reversed at an extrapolated potential value of -91.04 mV and was fully antagonized by the M2 muscarinic antagonist methoctramine. The slow depolarizing component reversed at an extrapolated value of -28.33 mV and was inhibited by the M1 muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine. These results demonstrate both a specific effect for McN-A-343 on DUM neurones and the existence of two functionally distinct muscarinic-like receptor subtypes governing this McN-A-343-induced biphasic response.", 
    "83": "This review paper deals with the impact of psychotropic drugs on vigilance, awakening and motricity. Antidepressants can be divided into 3 categories, depending on the subject's awakening: sedatives with a strong anticholinergic component, compounds devoid of positive or negative impact on cognition and stimulating antidepressants. The principal effect of lithium is to lengthen the reaction time. Taken acutely, neuroleptics produce alterations of fine motor gestures, but when taken chronically they spare the functioning of cognition. Benzodiazepines act on vigilance in various ways, depending on their half-life and on their plasma peak time after oral administration. The effect of anticonvulsants on cognition is more pronounced with phenytoin and barbiturates than with carbamazepine or valproate sodium. The problems of comparative analysis in this field and the trends in current studies are underlined.", 
    "84": "The neuronal-like cell lines, B35, B65, B103, and B104, previously reported to possess high affinity GABA binding, were analyzed for various cellular properties. They possessed peripheral but lacked central benzodiazepine binding. Only B65 cells possessed [3H-]muscimol binding; none bound [35S]TBPS. None of the cells exhibited GABA-stimulated chloride conductance with patch clamp recordings. By Western blots the cells possessed alpha subunits. Northern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that out of alpha 1, alpha 4, beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits, only alpha 1 subunit mRNA was present. Thus, GABAA-receptor binding without associated central benzodiazepine receptor sites and without functional chloride channels appears to result from expression of an incomplete subunit composition.", 
    "85": "At low doses of triazolam currently recommended increased assay sensitivity is required for measurement of low plasma concentrations. A highly sensitive capillary gas chromatographic analytical method with a limit of detection of 0.02 ng/ml was developed and used to describe the pharmacokinetics of triazolam following the oral intake of 0.125, 0.250 and 0.375 mg. Six male subjects were studied with blood sampling at the following times: 0, 15, 30 and 45 min and 1, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 h. The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for the three doses, respectively, were as follows: half-life, 2.7 +/- 0.4, 3.2 +/- 0.5 and 3.2 +/- 0.6 h; apparent oral clearance, 302.3 +/- 59.0, 260.2 +/- 67.9 and 328.6 +/- 77.8 ml/min; apparent volume of distribution, 64.3 +/- 9.6, 62.0 +/- 12.6 and 73.3 +/- 7.7 l; time to maximum concentration, 0.7 +/- 0.2, 0.6 +/- 0.1 and 0.8 +/- 0.3 h; maximum concentration, 2.2 +/- 0.3, 4.3 +/- 0.6 and 5.0 +/- 0.5 ng/ml; and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) up to 8 h, 6.8 +/- 1.2, 16.8 +/- 2.9 and 19.6 +/- 3.5 ng/ml h; and AUC extrapolated to infinity, 8.5 +/- 1.7, 21.4 +/- 4.4 and 26.3 +/- 7.2 ng/ml h. There were no significant differences in the half-life, clearance, volume of distribution and time to maximum concentration among the three doses. The AUC was significantly different on the three occasions and was linearly correlated with dose: r = 0.64 (p less than 0.005).",

    "90": "Physicians were less likely to have used cigarettes and illicit substances, such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin, in the past year than their age and gender counterparts in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. They were more likely to have used alcohol and two types of prescription medications--minor opiates and benzodiazepine tranquilizers. Prescription substances were used primarily for self-treatment, whereas illicit substances and alcohol were used primarily for recreation. Current daily use of illicit or controlled substances was rare.", 
    "91": "Although physicians were as likely to have experimented with illicit substances in their lifetime as their age and gender peers in society, they were far less likely to be current users of illicit substances. The higher prevalence of alcohol use among respondents may be more a characteristic of their socioeconomic class than of their profession. A unique concern for physicians, however, is their high rate of self-treatment with controlled medications--a practice that could increase their risk of drug abuse or dependence. Uniform national guidelines are needed to sensitize medical students and physicians to the dangers of self-treatment with controlled prescription substances.", 
    "92": "A nonisotopic receptor assay using the biotin-1012-S conjugate was developed and the usefulness of this conjugate as a probe ligand for the benzodiazepine receptor was evaluated. The conjugate was incubated in a receptor suspension, and then the concentration of free conjugate in the supernatant was determined nonisotopically with a solid-phase avidin-biotin binding assay. Studies on the ligand saturation with the conjugate demonstrated that the conjugate has very high affinity and specificity for the receptors and the biotin labeling does not decrease the affinity of 1012-S. This assay method was applied to the characterization of binding sites of benzodiazepine receptors in cow brain. Competition interactions between the conjugate and benzodiazepine drugs gave well-defined dose-response curves. These results confirm the possibility that this conjugate could serve as a probe for the study of receptor-ligand interactions and provide the basis of a new nonisotopic receptor assay for benzodiazepine drugs.", 
    "93": "We examined the effects of the inverse benzodiazepine agonist ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) on behavioral, hormonal, and neurochemical responses in infant rhesus monkeys exposed to fearful situations. Our paradigm elicits three distinct adaptive patterns of defensive behavior. From previous work, we hypothesized that behaviors induced by attachment bond disruption are predominantly mediated by opiate systems, whereas behaviors induced by the threat of attack are mediated by benzodiazepine systems. When beta-CCE (0, 125, 250, and 500 micrograms/kg) was administered immediately after maternal separation, the 500 micrograms/kg dose increased freezing and the 250 and 500 micrograms/kg doses reduced environmental exploration. Test conditions produced increased plasma ACTH and cortisol concentrations and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of MHPG and DOPAC; beta-CCE did not further affect these metabolites. A dose of 1000 micrograms/kg of beta-CCE increased CSF concentrations of DOPAC and MHPG in infants left with their mothers. During test conditions, it further increased CSF MHPG (but not DOPAC) concentrations, and reduced cooing while increasing freezing and barking and other hostile behaviors. Our results thus confirm that benzodiazepine systems mediate threat-related behaviors and suggest that coos, which were thought to predominantly reflect the degree of distress during separation, can be modulated by the infant's level of fear. beta-CCE also activated stress-related pituitary-adrenal hormonal systems and brain norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) systems. These effects occurred when animals remained undisturbed in their home cages with their mothers, suggesting that benzodiazepine receptors directly modulate brain NE and DA systems.", 
    "94": "The effects of diazepam, pentobarbital, and phencyclidine (PCP) were studied on punished and unpunished responding maintained by fixed-interval schedules before and during chronic administration of diazepam. Before chronic diazepam administration, increasing doses of diazepam and PCP increased and then decreased rates of both punished and unpunished responding. Increases in punished responding were larger than increases in unpunished responding. Pentobarbital only increased punished responding, while higher doses decreased both rates of punished and unpunished responding. During chronic diazepam administration, rates of punished and unpunished responding showed further increases with all three drugs and the dose-effect curves also shifted to the right. Analysis of local rates of responding within fixed-interval components suggested that increases in low rates early in the interval were responsible for the rate increases produced by these drugs before chronic diazepam administration. During chronic diazepam administration low rates early in the interval showed greater increases after all three drugs and their ability to produce rate-increasing effects extended further into the interval. The similar effects of these drugs before and during chronic diazepam administration suggests a similar mechanism despite the widely recognized differences in their interaction with receptors. This common mechanism may relate to rate-increasing effects more than to specific effects on punished responding.", 
    "95": "Preliminary studies on CCK receptors in the central nervous system were carried out on guinea pig cerebral cortical synaptoneurosome preparations. In binding assays, the range of affinity of CCK-8, Boc-[Nle28,Nle31]CCK-7, a potent CCK analog, Boc-[Leu31]CCK-4 and of the two benzodiazepine CCK receptor antagonists L-365,260 and MK-329, is in agreement with the presence of CCKB receptors on this model. The effects of Boc-[Nle28,Nle31]CCK-7 on inositol phosphates, cAMP accumulation and 45Ca2+ efflux were investigated. Neither inositol phosphate nor cAMP accumulations could be observed. On the other hand, evidence of Boc-[Nle28,Nle31]CCK-7-, CCK-8- and Boc-[Leu31]CCK-4-induced 45Ca2+ efflux was found in a dose-dependent manner. The CCKB-selective receptor antagonist L-365,260 and, with a weaker efficiency, the CCKA-selective receptor antagonist MK-329, are able to block a maximal effect of Boc-[Nle28,Nle31]CCK-7-induced 45Ca2+ efflux, suggesting that CCKB receptors may regulate calcium ion mobilization.",

FG 7142 (2 mg/ml of 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or vehicle (100% DMSO) was administered continuously for 8 days in the right ventricle via an osmotic minipump. At the end of the eighth day of exposure, the brain was removed and cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus were dissected and mRNA prepared from each region. Levels of GABAA alpha 1 and gamma 2 subunit mRNA were examined by Northern blot analysis with cDNA probes specific for these subunits. A significant increase in alpha 1 mRNA was measured in both cortex and hippocampus, but not in cerebellum, of rats chronically exposed to FG 7142 relative to vehicle-treated rats. A significant increase in gamma 2 subunit mRNA in cortex was also evident in drug-treated rats; however, no change in gamma 2 subunit mRNA was observed in either the hippocampus or cerebellum. Examination of GABAA beta 1 subunit mRNA by solution hybridization using a beta 1 riboprobe revealed no effect of chronic FG 7142 treatment on this subunit in either cortex, hippocampus or cerebellum.

    "98": "The purpose of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that chronic exposure to alcohol may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD), either by independently adding receptor losses or by accelerating the AD disease process itself. Muscarinic [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and benzodiazepine [3H]-flunitrazepam receptor binding in homogenates of human autopsy brains were determined in four nonalcoholic and seven alcoholic AD brains and in histologically normal brains from 20 alcoholics and 20 nonalcoholics. Muscarinic binding was decreased in alcoholic AD compared with nonalcoholic AD in the parahippocampal region of frontal cortex, premotor temporal cortex, and amygdala, but not in the hippocampus. Benzodiazepine receptors were lost from the temporal cortex and amygdala, but the difference in the amygdala was not statistically significant. Plaque counts considered a marker of the severity of AD were not increased in the brains of alcoholics compared with nonalcoholics. Larger receptor losses in some alcoholic AD were associated with low plaque counts. Since all of these patients were severely demented, it is tentatively suggested that the receptor losses resulting from alcoholism may have contributed to the dementia in these AD patients.",

Both midazolam and morphine were effective in reducing the nociceptive response of the second phase of this biphasic pain test. Only midazolam (30 micrograms) reduced also the first phase. These results confirm the existence of analgesic properties of midazolam in the case of long-lasting pain.", 
    "100": "Environmental stimuli that signal the occurrence of aversive or dangerous events activate endogenous opiate analgesia systems. Signals for safety (the nonoccurrence of aversive events) produce the opposite and inhibit environmentally produced analgesia. Stimuli that signal safety are now shown to abolish the analgesic effect of morphine, even when morphine is applied directly to spinal cord. Further, this antiopiate effect occurs because the environmental stimulus leads to release of the neuropeptide cholecystokinin in the spinal cord. This process may contribute to the regulation of pain and the development of opiate tolerance.",

The method is reproducible and reliable with a detection limit of 7.5 ng/ml in biological fluids. The mean coefficients of variation for concentrations within the range of the standard curve range were 3.84 and 2.56%, respectively, for intra-day analysis and 4.48 and 4.26%, respectively, for inter-day analysis. Application of the development was successfully demonstrated by quantifying the concentration of I in both dog and rat plasma samples following an intravenous or oral dose of 5 mg/kg I.", 
    "102": "Nuclei of the thalamus that project to cingulate cortex have been implicated in responses to noxious stimuli, cholinergic and motor functions. The rabbit limbic thalamus may play an important role in these functions, but has not been studied extensively in terms of its cytoarchitecture, the topographical organization of its cortical projections, and differential transmitter regulation of its subnuclei. Therefore, the architecture, projections to cingulate cortex, and radioligand binding were investigated in the anterior, ventral, lateral, and midline nuclei of rabbit thalamus. The anterior nuclei are highly differentiated because both the dorsal and ventral nuclei have parvicellular and magnocellular divisions. Fluorescent dyes were injected into cingulate cortex to evaluate limbic thalamocortical connections. The anterior medial, submedial, and parafascicular nuclei project primarily to anterior cingulate cortex, while they have small or no projections to posterior areas. The ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei have a significant projection to dorsal cingulate cortex, including areas 24b and 29d. Projections of the anterior ventral nucleus are topographically organized, since medial parts of the parvicellular division project to rostral area 29, and lateral parts project to caudal area 29. The lateral nuclei and the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus project with progressively higher densities in the rostrocaudal plane of area 29. Finally, the magnocellular division of the anterior ventral nucleus projects almost exclusively to caudal and ventral area 29, i.e., granular retrosplenial cortex. Ligand binding studies employed coverslip autoradiography and single grain counting techniques. Muscarinic receptor binding was moderate for both pirenzepine and oxotremorine-M in the parvicellular anterior ventral nucleus, while in other nuclei, there was an inverse relationship in the binding for these ligands. Most notably, the anterior dorsal nucleus, which receives no cholinergic input, had very high oxotremorine-M and low pirenzepine binding, while the anterior medial nucleus, which receives a moderate cholinergic input, had the highest pirenzepine binding and very low oxotremorine-M binding. Muscimol binding to GABAA receptors was highest in the anterior ventral nucleus, while it was at moderate levels in the anterior dorsal and lateral nuclei. The binding of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol to mu opioid receptors and 2-D-penicillamine-5-D-penicillamine-enkephalin to delta opioid receptors were both high in the parvicellular and low in the magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus. The magnocellular division of the anterior ventral, the lateral dorsal, and the parafascicular nuclei had high mu opioid binding, while the lateral dorsal and lateral magnocellular nuclei had low levels of delta opioid binding.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
