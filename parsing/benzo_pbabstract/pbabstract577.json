    "0": "The effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist, Ro 15-1788 on ethanol withdrawal convulsions were investigated in rats. The study originated from recent reports of benzodiazepine binding activity in urine of alcoholics during withdrawal. No alleviation of convulsions was found with Ro 15-1788. This suggested that this component of the withdrawal syndrome is not due to endogenous production of a benzodiazepine inverse agonist (contragonist), as Ro 15-1788 prevents the action of this type of compound.", 
    "1": "The effect of the delta-opioid agonist [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) and the benzodiazepine diazepam on the food intake of non-deprived rats was investigated. Both compounds produced a significant increase in feeding. The hyperphagic response to DADLE (10 micrograms i.c.v.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg i.p.) was suppressed by concurrent treatment with the selective delta-opioid antagonist ICI 154,129 (10 micrograms i.c.v.). These findings add further support to the concept that endogenous enkephalins may be implicated in the stimulatory effects of benzodiazepines on ingestive behaviour.", 
    "2": "Rats (N = 8) were trained to discriminate the stimulus properties of the potent benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) from saline in a two-lever operant task. The initial training dose of DMCM was 0.4 mg/kg at which the discrimination developed slowly; increasing the dose to 0.8 mg/kg resulted in rapid acquisition. However, since convulsions eventually developed during further training (sensitization), the training dose was finally individualized below the convulsive threshold (0.4-0.7 mg/kg). The DMCM cue was mimicked by FG 7142 (10 mg/kg), a non-convulsant anxiogenic beta-carboline, by pentylenetrazol (20-30 mg/kg), and by the GABA antagonist bicuculline (2 mg/kg). The DMCM cue was not, or marginally, blocked by diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (10-15 mg/kg). Furthermore, the BZ receptor antagonists CGS 8216 (2.5 mg/kg), ZK 93426 (20 mg/kg), and Ro 15-1788 (20-80 mg/kg) also did not, or only marginally, block the DMCM cue. However, the receptor antagonists (alone) substituted for DMCM although Ro 15-1788 was less effective. The partial BZ receptor agonist ZK 91296 (25 mg/kg), which is structurally similar to DMCM, blocked completely the DMCM stimulus effect. THIP (4 mg/kg) did not block the DMCM cue. To explain these results, we suggest that the repeated DMCM treatment, necessary for maintaining the discrimination, shifts the balancing point (\"set-point\") for positive (i.e., BZ-like) agonist efficacy versus inverse agonist efficacy, towards inverse action. This hypothesis was supported by the finding of an enhanced ability of GABA to reduce 3H-DMCM binding to cortical neuronal membranes of animals treated chronically with DMCM in a regimen similar to that used to maintain the DMCM discrimination. Furthermore, this treatment did not affect baseline 3H-DMCM binding, baseline or GABA stimulated 3H-diazepam binding, or 35S-TBPS binding (to chloride channels).", 
    "3": "This study examines the effectiveness of diagnosis restrictions as a drug utilization control in California's Medi-Cal (Medicaid) program. The numbers of Valium prescriptions dispensed, the numbers of Medi-Cal beneficiaries using Valium and the expenditures represented by those prescriptions were measured during application of a diagnosis restriction for a 33-month base period, followed by removal of the diagnosis restriction for a 14-month period.", 
    "4": "Baboons and rats were trained under a two-lever, food-reinforced drug discrimination procedure. The training drug was either lorazepam (1.0 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (5.6 mg/kg in baboons, 10.0 mg/kg in rats). Under test conditions, a range of training drug doses occasioned 100% drug lever responding. CGS 8216 (3.2-10.0 mg/kg) combined with lorazepam produced a complete shift to the no-drug lever in both species; this shift was surmountable with higher doses of lorazepam. CGS 8216 (32.0 mg/kg) combined with pentobarbital produced a statistically significant decrease in drug-lever responding in rats, and in baboons CGS 8216 initially, but not subsequently, produced a complete shift to the no-drug lever. Caffeine (0.32-10.0 mg/kg) combined with lorazepam inconsistently decreased drug-lever responding across multiple determinations in baboons and significantly decreased drug lever responding in rats. Caffeine combined with pentobarbital also yielded an inconsistent decrease in drug lever responding in baboons but there was no effect in rats. Thus the most reliable and complete antagonism across species was obtained with the CGS 8216/lorazepam combinations.", 
    "5": "Following treatment for seven days with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg i.m., b.i.d.), administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788 (5 mg/kg) induced a severe withdrawal syndrome in vervet monkeys which included tremors, vomiting, vocalizations, chewing, and piloerection. Brain concentrations of the noradrenergic metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) were significantly higher in the precipitated withdrawal group than in the diazepam plus vehicle control group. Administration of RO 15-1788 without prior diazepam treatment had no effect on brain MHPG, nor did it produce withdrawal behaviors, but did produce an increase in the frequency of scratching. These results raise the possibility that increased central noradrenergic activity serves a role in benzodiazepine withdrawal similar to the role hypothesized for noradrenergic activity in opiate withdrawal.", 
    "6": "Pinealectomy of rats resulted in significant depression of benzodiazepine receptors (assessed by [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding) in cerebral cortex 3-14 days after surgery without affecting their affinity significantly. A single s.c. injection of melatonin (800 ?g/kg body wt) restored the depressed brain benzodiazepine receptor sites. Single melatonin injections (up to 1600 ?g/kg) to intact rats did not affect brain benzodiazepine binding when injected at either morning or evening hours. Daily melatonin treatment to intact rats for 5 days augmented benzodiazepine receptor density in brain (morning injections) or its dissociation constant (evening injections). Melatonin added in vitro to rat cerebral cortex membranes only slightly depressed [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding at 100 ?M concentrations. These results point out a link between pineal activity and benzodiazepine receptor function in rats. They also indicate that pharmacological doses of melatonin affect benzodiazepine binding sites in rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "7": "Release of [(3)H]noradrenaline from rat hippocampal synaptosomes was triggered by pulses of 25 mM K(+), 5 ?M veratridine or superfusion with the Ca(2+) ionophore A23187. GABA with bicuculline or chlordiazepoxide depressed the release of [(3)H]noradrenaline evoked by depolarisation but not by the Ca(2+) ionophore. 8 Br-cAMP with [Ca(2+)](0) 0.3 mM had no effect on spontaneous or K(+)-evoked release of [(3)H]noradrenaline and completely blocked the effect of chlordiazepoxide and GABA with bicuculline. With [Ca(2+)](0) 1 mM 8 Br-cAMP enhanced spontaneous and K(+)-evoked release of [(3)H]noradrenaline, and reversed the depression caused by GABA with bicuculline. GABA alone evoked Ca(2+)-dependent release of [(3)H]noradrenaline which was sensitive to [Cl(?)](0). The results suggest that the GABA(A)-receptor mediated release of [(3)H]noradrenaline is due to depolarisation resulting from increased Cl(?) conductance whereas the depression of depolarisation-dependent release of [(3)H]noradrenaline by GABA(B) or benzodiazepine receptors is mediated by a cAMP-dependent decrease in the voltage-dependent Ca(2+) conductance.", 
    "8": "Our purpose is to describe the technic we use to provide local anesthesia with sedation for the performance of both diagnostic and operative arthroscopy of the knee. This technic has been well accepted by majority of the patients and proved to be quite safe.", 
    "9": "The present study demonstrates that dose combinations of atropine sulfate and 2-pyridine aldoxime methylchloride (2-PAM), which do not produce any overt toxic effects on the behavior of mice or guinea pigs in a stable environment, elicit clonic-tonic convulsions and death when the animals are physically stressed by cold water swimming. Phenoxybenzamine (1-6 mg/kg), diazepam (0.625 and 1.25 mg/kg) and pilocarpine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) significantly decreased (or abolished) the occurrence of atropine and 2-PAM stressed-induced convulsions and/or lethality. In contrast, propranolol (20 mg/kg), was ineffective in preventing either convulsions or lethality. Changes in plasma glucose levels and internal body temperature did not appear to explain the precipitation of convulsions or ensuing death. These results suggest that during acute physical stress, relatively low doses of atropine and 2-PAM produce toxic and lethal effects due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic mechanisms along with a concomitant inactivation of cholinergic mechanisms.", 
    "10": "Fifteen drug-abusing doctors each directed their psychiatrist to mail to their licensing boards a pre-prepared license-surrendering letter if any of a series of urine samples contained drugs. The doctors also received other, individualized treatments. Profound reductions in drug use occurred. Seven patients did not relapse at all during the 2-year (average) follow-up, and 4 others experienced only very brief relapses. Four licenses were suspended temporarily by contract, but 6 were suspended or revoked for other reasons. Other reports on such patients reveal some adverse outcomes, and two of these patients had adverse outcomes after relapsing and discontinuing treatment.", 
    "11": "The author describes extensive use of diazepam (Valium) with ketamine as a safe and efficacious technique of dissociative local anesthesia in an ambulatory plastic surgery facility. He finds these agents helpful in rhinoplasty, facial surgery, and breast augmentations as well as all other aesthetic and most reconstructive procedures.", 
    "12": "Those patients premedicated at least 90 minutes before coloscopy, with sublingual lorazepam, showed improved sedative effect, better tolerance and collaboration? Less discomfort and pain when air was, as usually insuflated, as compared with patients receiving intramuscular diazepam. Doctor's opinion coincided with the before mentioned preference for sublingual lorazepam prescribed at least 90 minutes before the endoscopic procedure. No adverse side effects were pointed out.", 
    "13": "Water-deprived female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained in a conditioned suppression of drinking paradigm. Experiment 1 assessed the effects of prior experience with ethanol on the initial treatment deficit of diazepam (1A) and the influence of prior experience with diazepam on the initial treatment effects of ethanol (1B). In Experiment 1A, half the animals received three daily doses of ethanol, while the other half received vehicle for 3 days. All rats then received vehicle followed by 3 days of ethanol treatment. No significant effect of prior experience with ethanol was observed on the diazepam initial treatment deficit. In Experiment 1B, half the animals received vehicle followed by three daily doses of diazepam, while the other half received vehicle. All subjects then received vehicle followed by 3 days of ethanol treatment. No significant effect of prior experience with diazepam was noted on ethanol's initial treatment effects. Experiment 2 assessed the effects of diazepam (0, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg) and ethanol (0, 0.5, 1 and 2 g/kg) alone and in combination in the conflict test. Diazepam, administered alone, resulted in an antipunishment effect. Ethanol alone did not produce an antipunishment effect. The combination of the two drugs generally decreased both punished and unpunished responding. Further, the CNS depressant effects of these drugs appear to be additive. The qualitative effects of these two drugs are different enough to disallow generalization to each other in a conflict test.", 
    "14": "Elderly persons with insomnia are unique because the cause of their insomnia differs from that of younger people and their metabolism of benzodiazepine hypnotics differs as well. This study used nocturnal polysomnography and daytime sleep/wake tendency measures (Multiple Sleep Latency Test, MSLT) to assess the efficacy and safety of a reduced triazolam dosage (0.125 mg) in elderly subjects with insomnia. After 2 nights and an intervening day of screening each subject received triazolam and placebo for 2 consecutive nights presented in a counter-balanced design. Compared to placebo the reduced triazolam dose induced and maintained sleep thereby increasing total sleep time. Sleep stage distribution and the frequency of apneas and periodic leg movements was not altered. The improved sleep was associated with a restoration of the normal pattern of daytime alertness. The correspondence of this clinical data to known pharmacokinetic data is discussed.", 
    "15": "A group of intravenous anaesthetic drugs was compared with methohexitone sodium for their ability to potentiate tetraethylammonium induced contractures of the chick biventer cervicis muscle (TEA test). The equipotent concentrations in the TEA test were: methohexitone 8.8 X 10(-5) M, propanidid 1.78 X 10(-4) M, althesin 3.58 X 10(-5) M (in terms of alphaxalone), etomidate 1.6 X 10(-4) M, thiopentone 2.13 X 10(-5) M and valium 4.95 X 10(-5) M. There was no relation between activity in the TEA test and excitatory muscular activity reported clinically. The central depressant drugs ethyl alcohol and urethane also potentiated TEA but they were only active in high concentrations (10(-1) - 10(-2) M). alpha-Chloralose was inactive but paraldehyde (3.8 X 10(-3) M) actually reduced TEA induced contractures. Lipophilicity is only one factor in determining activity in the TEA test, the ability to block Ca2+ reuptake may also be important.", 
    "16": "The effect of a single phenazepam dose (1-2 mg) on the power of EEG frequency ranges, their interhemispherical asymmetry and the level of intra- and inter-hemispherical correlations was studied in 78 patients with borderline neuropsychic disturbances divided into four groups depending on the efficiency of phenazepam therapy. Different variants of reactions of EEG parameters related to the characteristics of the clinical action of the drug in different groups of patients were identified. High therapeutical efficacy of phenazepam was associated with a complex of bilateral, relatively generalized changes in power of beta- and alpha-ranges, characteristic of action of benzodiazepins and combined with a predominantly right-side decrease in theta-range and the absence of any significant dynamics of the initially intact correlations of the EEG. Patients with inadequate efficiency of phenazepam showed a topographically-limited and incomplete complex of changes in the power of frequency ranges. They also had alterations in the level of EEG correlation.", 
    "17": "An interaction between phenytoin (PHT) and clonazepam (CZP) occurred in an epileptic patient, who had been treated with PHT with partial seizure control. The addition of CZP brought about a significant decrease of PHT plasma levels (from 24.8 to 16 micrograms/ml) in spite of increases in the PHT dose. Gradual reduction of CZP, without modifying the PHT dosage, caused significant increases in PHT plasma levels to 42.4 micrograms/ml with signs of intoxication. A review of the literature shows contradictions: some authors state that there is no interaction between the drugs; other authors state either an increase or decrease in PHT plasma levels. These paradoxical results could be explained by the bidirectional effect of these drugs in hepatic enzyme metabolism. The importance of monitoring plasma levels of antiepileptic drugs is emphasized when several medications are required in the treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "18": "It has been found empirically that either average or minimum steady-state plasma concentrations (Css) of drugs obeying Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics give essentially linear plots on semilogarithmic graph paper when Css is plotted versus the maintenance dose (D) or dose rate (R). The equations of such straight lines may be converted to the following nonlinear equation: Css = abD which fits the Css,D data essentially as well as D = VmCss/(Km + Css). The parameter b is analogous to unity plus the interest fraction in logarithmic growth or compound interest calculations, and each drug appears to have a characteristic value of this parameter, with extremely small intersubject variation. From the above equation the following equation, Dn+1 = Dn + 1n(Cn+1/Cn)1n b can be derived, which forms the basis of predicting the needed dosage, Dn+1, to obtain a desired steady-state concentration, Cn+1, using one initial steady-state concentration, Cn, obtained with dose, Dn, and using a population value of b for the drug. It appears that it is the value of the \"initial capital\" (i.e., a in relation to the initial dose) rather than the \"interest fraction\" (i.e., b - 1) that causes most of the intersubject variation in Css of a given drug. Several drugs illustrate the usefulness of the method. A semilogarithmic plot also appears to be an excellent method to distinguish simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics from parallel Michaelis-Menten and first order elimination kinetics and from simple first order kinetics with steady-state data in the range 0.3-3 Km.", 
    "19": "The effectiveness of cimetropii bromidum (10 or 20 mg i.v.) as premedication for upper gastro-intestinal tract endoscopy was examined and compared with that of placebo in a double-blind crossover study involving 160 patients. The drug effects were assessed from the degree of opening of the pyloric sphincter and the endoscopist's rating of drug performance. The study showed that the effects of cimetropii bromidum differed highly significantly (p less than 0.0001) from those of placebo, on either count. No adverse effects were noted.", 
    "20": "A single-centre, open, Phase I-study comparison of the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of metaclazepam 10 mg, a new 1,4-benzodiazepine has been done in 10 older and 20 younger volunteers. No important age-related effect was found on the kinetics of metaclazepam or its N-desmethyl derivative, the principal metabolite in man.", 
    "21": "Impairments of memory storage and retrieval produced by diazepam (2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg) in normal elderly individuals were compared to those observed in patients with primary degenerative dementia tested under nondrug conditions. The highest diazepam dose affected retrieval as well as storage processes in Buschke's \"selective reminding\" task, producing impairments qualitatively similar to those shown by demented patients. All diazepam doses impaired Buschke task performance in the normal elderly individuals; normal young subjects, in contrast, showed no impairment with a low (2.5 mg) diazepam dose.", 
    "22": "Tardive dyskinesia appeared in a 17-year-old boy following withdrawal of pimozide (Orap) and thioridazine (Melleril). The choreodyskinetic movements, which were limited to the limbs and the trunk, cleared with anticholinergic drugs but were dramatically worsened by dopaminergic receptor blockers. Therefore, therapy with an initial high dose of benztropine mesylate (Cogentin) associated with bromazepam (Lexotan) was instituted and was well tolerated.", 
    "23": "A longitudinal panel study examined the effects of actual use of diazepam (Valium) on subjective reports of life quality, affect, performance, stress, social support, control, coping and other variables related to mental health. Standardized interviews were conducted with 675 persons from the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Based on prescription records, diazepam users and nonusers were selected to represent a variety of sociodemographic characteristics rather than to be a completely random sample. Significant others in work and in personal life were also interviewed. Four interviews took place, one approximately every 6 weeks. Testing for social effects was conducted by within- and across-person analyses of 367 respondents who reported taking the medication at some time during the study and by comparisons with 308 respondents who did not report taking Valium. Users of Valium tended to take less Valium than prescribed. They also reported consuming less alcohol when using Valium than at other times and less than non-Valium users. Although there was a modest, positive cross-sectional relation between Valium use and distress, numerous multivariate analyses controlling for levels of stress and health indicated no notable effects of Valium use on any of the social or psychological indicators, including anxiety. Several interpretations of the results are examined including the possibility that the effects of Valium use were short-lived rather than long-term and that Valium may have been taken in anticipation of anxiety rather than after its occurrence.", 
    "24": "In order to investigate the possible differences of diazepam effects in the two sexes, two placebo-controlled double-blind studies were conducted on healthy volunteer students. In one study the subjects received diazepam 10 mg alone or combined with 0.5 g/kg of alcohol in a parallel group design; in the other 0.2 mg/kg of diazepam or placebo were given in a cross-over manner. In both trials diazepam impaired the psychomotor skills of women more than men. The difference was similar in tasks measuring cognitive (digit symbol substitution), motor (balance of extraocular muscles) and sensory (critical flicker fusion) performances. Tapping speed was affected to a similar degree in both genders. Diazepam 10 mg did not cause impairment of body balance, a parameter sensitive to alcohol. The combined effect of diazepam and alcohol was of similar magnitude in both sexes in all objective tests. Subjectively the women felt themselves clumsier than did the men. The calming effect was similar in both groups. The results suggest that while the performance of women may be more vulnerable than men to impairment by diazepam they also are aware of it. The difference of effects is of such magnitude that it may cause bias in experiments unless carefully balanced groups are used.", 
    "25": "Ninety-three patients scheduled for various elective surgical procedures were divided into three equal groups and had induction of anaesthesia with either thiopentone (5 mg/kg), thiopentone (5 mg/kg) plus gallamine (0.3 mg/kg), or with flunitrazepam (0.03 mg/kg). Four minutes after induction they received a bolus intravenous injection of succinylcholine (1 mg/kg). Intra-ocular pressure was measured before and after induction, and approximately 1 minute after succinylcholine. It was found that flunitrazepam prevented the increase in intra-ocular pressure better than thiopentone plus gallamine. In both these groups, the subsequent intravenous administration of succinylcholine slightly increased the pressure but to levels below that noted before anaesthesia was induced. However, intra-ocular pressure was significantly increased above baseline levels when succinylcholine was injected after induction with thiopentone alone. Flunitrazepam is recommended, therefore, as a possible alternative for thiopentone-gallamine induction with succinylcholine when an increase in intra-ocular pressure must be prevented.", 
    "26": "Ideally one would like a water-soluble, non-irritant, rapidly-acting, smooth induction agent, with no antanalgesic action. Cardiovascular and respiratory depression should be minimal with normal dosage. Since these are unlikely to be achieved with a single drug, the combination of opioid and induction agent offers possibilities that should be explored. A slight delay in onset would not be a major obstacle, provided this is predictable, but the prime need is for a rapidly acting less toxic alternative to thiopentone.", 
    "27": "Abrupt withdrawal of the centrally-acting antihypertensive agent, clonidine, is associated with a high incidence of rebound hypertension and tachycardia, with symptoms of sympathetic overactivity and increased catecholamine excretion. Gradual clonidine withdrawal has been recommended, but does not always avoid the reaction. A regimen is described comprising high doses of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, the cardioselective beta-blocker, atenolol, and chlordiazepoxide, specifically designed to counter both central and peripheral effects of sudden withdrawal of a central alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist. This combination was completely successful in preventing the haemodynamic and symptomatic features of clonidine withdrawal in eight hypertensive patients.", 
    "28": "The novel benzodiazepine derivative, meclonazepam (3-methylclonazepam) has been found to be orally effective at high doses against all stages of schistosomiasis. Animals studies have shown it to have a high therapeutic index and a profile of behavioural activity typical of the benzodiazepines. The effects of single oral doses of meclonazepam, 1, 2 and 4 mg on central arousal, psychomotor performance and subjective mood were studied in two double-blind placebo controlled studies in healthy volunteers. In doses exceeding 1 mg, meclonazepam caused marked dose-related impairment in cognitive and psychomotor functions as well as shifts in mood reflecting sedation and ataxia. These effects were most prominent in the first 3 h after administration, with moderate sedation still present 6 h after the 4 mg dose. The implications of these findings for the use of benzodiazepine agents in the treatment of schistosomiasis are discussed.", 
    "29": "Psychomotor efficiency was tested on 12 male patients after peroral administration of the analgesically acting monosubstance 2-amino-3-ethoxycarbonyl-amino-6-p-fluorobenzyl aminopyridine (flupirtine, Katadolon) (3 X 100 mg on the previous day and 100 mg before the test) and compared with the peroral administration of diazepam, chlorphenoxamine and a placebo using a combined multiple problem, which tests the fine motor coordination in the peripheral and central field of vision at high vigilance. Compared with the placebo, flupirtine lengthened the reaction time with only slight significance by 2.7 +/- 2.2%, but with significance the mental processing time by 3.0 +/- 1.9%. This sedative effect reached only 41% and 43% respectively of the sedative effect of the antihistamine chlorphenoxamine (80 mg daily dose on the preceding day and 20 mg 1 h before start of the test). Under the hangover effect of diazepam (evenings 10 mg perorally 2 days before and 5 mg perorally on the preceding day) slightly significant shorter times were determined than under flupirtine. Flupirtine does not change the number of standard errors and the uniformity of performance, but it does increase the number of signals overlooked in the experiment, to a considerably lesser degree, however, than chlorphenoxamine. In the hangover of diazepam, the number of standard errors is lower and the number of overlooked signals greater than under flupirtine. The errors and the number of overlooked signals are greatest under chlorphenoxamine.", 
    "30": "The effects of a new benzodiazepine derivative, ethyl loflazepate (CM6912), on the arousal level of normal male human subjects were investigated by use of the averaged photopalpebral reflex (PPR), the latency of which is sensitively prolonged with the lowering of the arousal level. Four doses of ethyl loflazepate, i.e., 2 mg, 4 mg, 6 mg, and 8 mg, and a placebo were administered to each subject 30 min after lunch according to a double-blind, crossover design. Ethyl loflazepate prolonged both latencies of PPR in a dose-dependent manner. The dose-response curves for both latencies, derived from the maximum prolongation, showed a definite and linear dose-response relationship. The drug action occurred within 1 h, peaked at 2.5-3 h, and continued slightly even 4 h after medication. In the subjective assessments, vagueness of thought, sleepiness, and weakness were only slightly observed. These results suggest that ethyl loflazepate could be a potent hypnotic and/or anxiolytic which possesses a relatively rapid onset of action with moderate duration and has no severe side effects.", 
    "31": "Intravenous metoclopramide and IM prochlorperazine and diazepam were compared in the management of vomiting occurring during treatment with cis-dichlorodiammineplatinum (cis-platinum). A total of 104 cycles in 30 patients were evaluated. Twenty-two patients took part in a cross-over study in which emetic profiles for each patient managed with each anti-emetic schedule were compared. In all, 44 cycles of treatment in 22 patients were evaluated as part of a cross-over study. No significant difference in emetic control was observed between the two anti-emetic regimens. The side-effects observed using IV metoclopramide included extrapyramidal phenomena (19%) and flushing attacks (16%).", 
    "32": "Partially food deprived mice ran in a 1-m circular runway. Every 30 circuits, diluted evaporated milk was delivered. Under control conditions mice averaged 0.18 circuits/s for 1 h. The rate was reduced to 0.11 circuits/s 1 h after gavage of Tylose (cellulose derivative) vehicle. Amphetamine, chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital increased the rate of responding over some dose range, but chlorpromazine, clozapine, imipramine and morphine caused only decreases in responding at effective dose levels. The results are generally similar to reports of effects of the drugs on responses of much briefer duration occurring at similar rates.", 
    "33": "The effects of nine intravenous anaesthetic techniques on serum cortisol level and circulatory parameters were studied in healthy patients undergoing termination of pregnancy. Considering the increased pre-operation values and those of the pregnant control group as well as diurnal variations, it was found that the serum cortisol value changed during and after the procedure depending on the type of anaesthesia used. This might mean that the optimal type of anaesthesia for interruption could be designed by measuring the serum cortisol level, assuming that this parameter was one of the indicators of stress. The rating the different types of anaesthetics, the circulatory parameters were also considered. According to these criteria the best results were observed using methohexital in combination with fentanyl or diazepam.", 
    "34": "In an electropharmacokinetic study, the effects of lormetazepam and flunitrazepam were compared by the means of a sleep EEG and waking EEG during the following daytime. At a 1-week interval, 6 normal subjects received at random either 2 mg lormetazepam or 2 mg flunitrazepam in a double-blind, crossover fashion. Sleep EEG was recorded throughout the night; 6-min EEG samples were recorded every hour during 10 hours on the following daytime for spectral analysis. Night sleep after flunitrazepam showed lower Stage IV sleep than after lormetazepam. During daytime, only flunitrazepam induced an increased percentage of beta 2 frequencies, which remained above baseline up to 10 hours after awakening, indicating a prolonged impregnation time. This study permitted comparison of the relative intensity and duration of these two benzodiazepines: lormetazepam appeared to be a short-acting hypnotic while flunitrazepam displayed longer modification of the brain electrical activity.", 
    "35": "Acute respiratory component of tardive dyskinesia, though reported very infrequently, is a potentially lethal condition necessitating urgent intervention. Several relevant issues are discussed with an illustrative case material. The need to differentiate respiratory dyskinesia from psychogenic hyperventilation is emphasized. Use of neuroleptics is discouraged to avoid unfavourable long-term outcome.", 
    "36": "The research question addressed in this study was, \"Do changes in promotional expenditure cause changes in the size of the market (primary demand) or market share (selective demand)?\" Two types of promotion were evaluated; sales calls to physicians and medical journal advertising. The sales elasticities of each of these promotional techniques were estimated through the use of ARIMA modeling. The market expansive effects and the market share effects were measured for each of 7 drugs in two therapeutic categories, the benzodiazepines and diuretics. The results of the analysis showed that there was no correlation between changes in detailing or journal advertising expenditures and primary or selective demand. Thus, it was assumed that the primary and selective demand elasticities for pharmaceutical advertising may be equal to zero. Drug manufacturers should evaluate the effects of reductions in their promotional expenditures, changes in promotional content, as well as seek alternative methods of advertising which may have a higher sales elasticity and effectiveness.", 
    "37": "The effects of locally applied gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ethylenediamine were examined and compared on CA1 pyramidal neurones in slice preparations of rat hippocampus using intracellular voltage recording techniques. Each substance produced both depolarization and hyperpolarization of the dendrites; the cell body responded with hyperpolarization alone. Ion substitution experiments suggest that the depolarizing responses of the dendrites were Cl- dependent and the hyperpolarizing responses of the cell body were dependent on Cl-, which suggests that the Cl- potential (EC1) is different in the dendrites compared with the cell body. The hyperpolarizing responses of the dendrites were dependent on K+. Dendritic depolarizing responses to GABA and ethylenediamine were antagonized by bicuculline and picrotoxin whereas the dendritic hyperpolarizing response was unaffected. The hyperpolarizing responses of the cell body were more difficult to study but it appeared that they were reduced by both bicuculline and picrotoxin. The benzodiazepines flurazepam and diazepam potentiated the dendritic depolarizing responses to GABA and ethylenediamine.

There are important differences in the elimination profile of the benzodiazephines: several factors can modify the process of oxidation appreciably; the plasma elimination half-life (T 1/2 beta) and the residual fraction (r12,1; R1, rSS) are useful pharmacokinetic parameters for evaluating the potential for persistent residual CNS depressant effects. Differences in the onset-time and duration of action are also influenced by the absorption and distribution profiles of the compounds.",

Improvement due to the desynchronizing effect of clonidine on tremor was observed in all cases. Possible mechanisms acting on the central and peripheral nervous system are discussed.", 
    "41": "This paper deals with the police officer's or police doctor's ability to find drivers under the influence of drugs. We have also studied whether the protocol on the driver's previous histories of drug intake is useful for directing the chemist in his analytical approach to revealing intoxicants in the suspects' body fluids. A comprehensive procedure for screening traffic-hazardous drugs in the urine was found necessary and is described. By using this method, we have studied the incidence of drunken drivers with detectable medicinal or illicit agents. The results demonstrate that 91% of those drivers found by the officer or doctor of the police to be on intoxicants other than ethanol, carried some kind of traffic-hazardous drug in their body fluids, and that the doctor was a better judge than the police in identifying these offenders. By using a series of chemical methods for drug screening, we found that every third driver suspected of drunken driving due to ethanol, but not to other intoxicants, held some kind of a traffic-hazardous drug substance in his urine; benzodiazepines and cannabinoids were the most common findings. The data imply that 34% of these suspects revealed their intakes of traffic-dangerous intoxicants. We conclude that the judgements of both the officer and doctor of the police are needed for an efficacious detection of drivers under the influence of drugs. Moreover, the results infer that the chemist has to screen for intoxicants to reveal these in a suspect driver. We also conclude that drugs, particularly the benzodiazepines or cannabinoids, may be commonly encountered in drunken drivers, suspected of being inebriated by ethanol but no other toxicants.", 
    "42": "Convulsive status epilepticus is a life-threatening disorder. Every emergency room that treats patients with this problem should have a treatment protocol prepared in advance to allow for prompt and appropriate therapy. The recommended treatment is an intravenous infusion of 20 mg/kg of phenytoin. Lorazepam or diazepam may be used to stop a convulsion in progress. If seizures persist, the second step may be an intravenous infusion of phenobarbital. If convulsions persist beyond the first hour and have not responded to the above, a barbiturate coma should be induced.", 
    "43": "Variations in four electrophysiological tests (H/M, T/M, vibratory inhibition, and recovery curve of Hoffmann's reflex following stimulation at the ankle) were studied following a single administration of four myorelaxant drugs: diazepam (10 mg intramuscularly), baclofen (20 mg intramuscularly), tizanidine (4 mg orally), and idrocilamide (60 mg intramuscularly). Fifty-one spastic patients, divided into four groups, were tested. All four drugs reduced the H/M and T/M ratios very slightly. Only diazepam and tizanidine reinforced vibratory inhibition. Diazepam and tizanidine did not modify the abnormal recovery curves, however, whereas baclofen and idrocilamide did. Reinforcement of vibratory inhibition suggests an increase in presynaptic inhibition mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid; changes in recovery curves are likely due to modifications of interneuronal reactivity. Matching myorelaxants to the predominant pathophysiological abnormality detected by electrophysiological exploration may lead to better treatment of spasticity.", 
    "44": "The effects of intravenous flunitrazepam (0.03 mg X kg-1) on the estimated hepatic plasma output (DPHE), compared with the cardiac output (Q), were studied before its injection and 1 min afterwards. The question asked was whether the decrease in venous return led to a fall in hepatic perfusion. This study was made on patients in neurological coma without any organic lesion. The DPHE was measured by applying Fick's principle, using a continuous infusion of indocyanine green (ICG). The DPHE was given by the amount of ICG perfused in mg X min-1 divided by the arterial concentration of ICG less the concentration of ICG in the hepatic vein (in mg X 1(-1)). Cardiac output was measured by thermodilution. Flunitrazepam did not significantly modify either DPHE or Q; they fell by 5.6% and 3.4% respectively. None of the seven cardiovascular parameters changed during the time of the study. Thus, in unconscious patients with satisfactory haemodynamic conditions prior to the intravenous injection, flunitrazepam did not significantly modify hepatic perfusion.", 
    "45": "The authors studied the effect of phenazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, on sleep disorders in alcoholic patients at the first period following alcohol intake discontinuation. Polygraphic registration of the sleep pattern was performed for two nights in 18 patients, receiving the drug and in ten patients of the control group. The drug use was associated with the following events: the latent period of falling asleep diminished, the total duration of sleep increased, the duration of consciousness \"inside the sleep\" decreased. As a result of the second stage recovery, the duration of the phase of slow sleep enhanced with no evidence of delta-sleep recovery. The duration of the fast sleep phase increased. The patients showed a marked improvement of sleep quality.", 
    "46": "Intramuscular injections of seduxen (10 mg), a benzodiasepin drug, with expressed tranquilizing and alarm suppressing effects, were used with the aim of experimental testing of a hypothesis on the neural mechanism of conditioned changes of the P300 wave. Under the action of seduxen no temporary connections could be formed between a perceived nonverbal visual stimulus and a unrecognized emotional word. The seduxen did not suppress the conditioned cortical reaction acquired due to combination of nonverbal stimulus with unrecognized emotional word. The suggestion is made that the necessary condition of temporary connection elaboration by means of a unrecognized verbal stimulus is the implication of the limbic structures where negative emotional reactions are integrated.", 
    "47": "In order to test the hypothesis that peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites mediate some direct effects of benzodiazepines on striated muscles, the properties of specific 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding to rat biceps and rat diaphragm homogenates were investigated. In both tissues a single population of sites was found with a KD value of 3 nmol/l. The density of these sites in both muscles was higher than the density in rat brain, but was considerably lower than in rat kidney. Competition experiments indicate a substrate specificity of specific 3H-Ro 5-4864 binding similar to the properties already demonstrated for the specific binding of this ligand to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in many other tissues. The properties of these sites in the rat diaphragm are not changed after motoric denervation by phrenicectomy. It is concluded that peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites are not involved in direct effects of benzodiazepines on striated muscles.", 
    "48": "The study was undertaken to assess the suitability of intravenous flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) in patients requiring sedative cover for prolonged dental surgery. Fifty patients received up to 2 mg flunitrazepam to induce a satisfactory level of sedation. Further maintenance doses and local anaesthesia were given if required. The results showed the level of sedation and working conditions, as assessed by anaesthetist and surgeon, to be satisfactory in all but one patient. The majority of patients remained slightly drowsy the following morning but all stated they would undergo a similar procedure again.", 
    "49": "Pelan and Elnar type electric stimulators were used to produce analgesia in 178 cancer patients in the course of surgery and in early postoperative period. The results of a complex study using rhythmography, acid-base balance, blood-sugar level, arterial and central venous pressure measurements and psychophysiologic examination with the Neuron type installation showed that joint application of electric stimulation and local anesthesia as well as the use of electric stimulation in combination with intravenous injection of hydroxybutyric acid, seduxen and ketalar provide adequate intraoperative anesthesia in 85% of cases. Postoperative application of electroanesthesia in cancer patients was followed by a significantly lower requirement of narcotic analgetics. Moreover, the procedure did not involve depressive or hyperkinetic complications, characteristic of morphine and promedol treatment. The results of the study suggest that electroanesthesia be used in cancer treatment.", 
    "50": "There is considerable consistency in the experimental literature showing that non-sedating doses of benzodiazepines can enhance the consumption of food, water and salt solutions. It is of great interest, therefore, that in a previous report low dose treatments with diazepam were found to significantly suppress the level of consumption of a palatable 0.005 M sodium saccharin solution in nondeprived male rats. The present study was designed to elucidate the behavioral characteristics of the inhibitory action of low dose diazepam treatments. Food consumption and general activity measures were chosen for analysis to examine the possibilities that low dose diazepam treatments might suppress ingestive behavior in a general way, or that the treatments might affect nonconsummatory responses including components of spontaneous motor activity. The results of two experiments succeeded in locating a highly specific inhibitory effect produced by 100 micrograms/kg diazepam. First, food consumption was not inhibited. Instead, 1.0 mg/kg diazepam produced significant elevations in food intake in both food-deprived and nondeprived animals. Second, vertical activity (rearing) and fine body movements were unaffected over the dose-range 0.1-3.0 mg/kg diazepam. Hence, low dose treatments with diazepam did not produce a generalised nonspecific behavioral depression. However, 100 micrograms/mg diazepam significantly inhibited coarse activity (measured automatically) and the corresponding ambulation measure (recorded by direct observation). The effect was present throughout a 1 hr test period and did not interact with the declining baseline level of activity. The results therefore confirm the presence of low dose diazepam-induced behavioral inhibition in quite a different context from the saccharin solution consumption study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Tubal spasm was encountered in 37 cases (9.2%) and prevented bilateral placement of tubal plugs in 16 of those cases. There was some evidence that glucagon was associated with a higher rate of remission and that women using barrier birth control methods experienced a lower incidence of tubal spasm. A number of other factors were found to be unrelated to tubal spasm and its remission.", 
    "53": "The binding of naphthyridinomycin (NAP) to deoxyribonucleic acid was investigated using radioisotope labeled antibiotic. Dithiothreitol (DTT) enhances complex formation in a concentration dependent fashion but was found to be slightly inhibitory at concentrations above 10 mM. [C3H3]-NAP-DNA complexes, formed in the presence or absence of reducing reagents, were stable to Sephadex G-25 chromatography and precipitation with ethanol, indicating a strong bond formed between the drug and DNA. Time course studies showed that the difference between the binding of activated and non-activated antibiotic was a DTT-dependent burst. This was followed by a second phase of binding which was similar in both the activated and non-activated antibiotics. The activation of the antibiotic by DTT was a reversible reaction at pH 7.9. The activated form at pH 5.0 was extremely stable and did not revert to the unactivated form even after an 8-h incubation period. Antibiotic-DNA complex formation was pH independent between pH 5.0 and 7.0 for activated NAP. The non-activated antibiotic bound to DNA much better at pH 5.0 than at physiological pH values. Release of antibiotic from complexes (as followed by long term dialysis) formed in the presence of DTT and at pH 5.0 was biphasic, suggesting that the drug can bind to DNA in more than one way. A constant rate of antibiotic release was observed at pH 7.9 with or without DTT. At pH 2.0 and pH 12.0, greater than 95% of the antibiotic is released from the complexes. Most of the acid released antibiotic is NAP while most of the base released antibiotic had decomposed to a more polar compound. NAP binds well to calf thymus DNA, poly(dG) . poly(dC), and T4 DNA but shows significantly less affinity for poly(dA) . poly(dT), poly(dA . dT) . poly(dA . dT), poly(dG), poly(dC), poly(dI) . poly(dC) or poly(dG . dC) . poly(dG . dC). This specificity of NAP for DNA is similar to that observed for the pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine antibiotics and saframycin A and S; all of which bind to double stranded DNA through their carbinolamine or masked carbinolamine functionalities. Two mechanisms which can explain the need for activation of NAP are also proposed.",

Intravenously administered antianxiety and analgesic drugs can make the procedure more tolerable for the patient. A technique of conscious sedation based upon titrating diazepam to specific eye signs and fentanyl to specific end points is described. Safety is maintained by ensuring that the patient is always in verbal contact with the surgeon. The rationale for administering the sedative before the narcotic is presented along with the treatment of side effects and untoward responses to the drugs.", 
    "55": "Oral diazepam 0.25 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg was employed as premedication in one hundred and one children undergoing elective surgery. The drug failed to modify the rise in cardiorespiratory indices of preanaesthetic anxiety compared with control values, and there was no difference between the two doses assessed by a sedation scoring system. 0.25 mg/kg diazepam produced less sedation in children under 5 years old, compared with those 5 years and older, whereas 0.5 mg/kg produced no difference between the older and younger age groups. The plasma levels of diazepam were greater postoperatively in the 0.5 mg/kg group. There was no relationship between plasma diazepam and recall at induction, and pre-anaesthetic amnesia was not enhanced with the higher premedication dose.", 
    "56": "When using the SCE test for evaluation of exposure in vivo to potential mutagens/carcinogens, it is necessary to consider possible confounding factors. In studies of possible mutagenic effects of pharmacological treatment the effect of concomitant administration of other agents such as sedatives may have to be considered. In order to assess whether diazepam per se influences SCE we have examined SCE in peripheral lymphocytes in 34 persons before and after oral administration of a single large dose of diazepam. 18 men and 16 women undergoing minor surgery of the hand received diazepam 0.2 mg kg-1 body weight orally on the day of operation, and venous blood samples were drawn on the day before the operation and again 2-5 h after the administration of diazepam. Both within cigarette smokers and non-smokers there was no statistically significant change of SCE following diazepam. It was concluded that there was no indication, from the SCE test, of an immediate mutagenic effect of a single large dose of diazepam and that such medication is not a confounding factor in studies by the SCE test.", 
    "57": "Effects of systemically administered protriptyline and diazepam on the respiratory activity of the phrenic, hypoglossal, and recurrent laryngeal nerves were investigated in vagotomized, decerebrate cats. Both hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerve activities were consistently increased after protriptyline administration, whereas the phrenic nerve discharge was not systematically altered. Similar changes were observed in cats with bilateral carotid sinus nerve sections. Diazepam induced a reduction of hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal nerve activities at doses that did not alter phrenic nerve discharge. These results with diazepam were the same in carotid chemodenervated cats. We conclude that neural mechanisms controlling upper airway muscles are much more sensitive to protriptyline and diazepam than are those of the bulbospinal-phrenic system. The selective augmentation of hypoglossal and recurrent laryngeal discharges by protriptyline could account for the reported decrease in the frequency of obstructive sleep apneas in patients receiving this antidepressant. In contrast, diazepam, by depressing motor activity to upper airway muscles, may exacerbate oropharyngeal obstruction during sleep.",

    "60": "Colonic smooth muscle spike potentials and contractility were recorded during the periods of stress by a bipolar electrode-perfused catheter apparatus placed in the rectosigmoid colon. Healthy subjects and patients with the irritable colon syndrome (ICS) were exposed to three standardized stressful conditions: (1) ice-water immersion, (2) Stroop stimulus differentiation test, and (3) ball sorting. In healthy controls, colonic motility increased after the first exposure to ice-water immersion (P less than 0.05), Stroop test (P less than 0.05), or ball sorting. Respiratory frequency also increased after exposure to the stressful stimuli. However, repeat exposures to the stress tests did not stimulate colonic motility. An increase in colonic motility occurred in patients with the irritable colon syndrome pretreated with a placebo after exposure to ice water (P less than 0.05), Stroop Test, or ball sorting (P less than 0.05). However, after exposure to the stressful situations patients pretreated with chlordiazepoxide had a diminished increase in colonic motility or in respiratory frequency. These studies suggest: (1) in healthy controls habituation reduces the stress-related increase in colonic motility, and (2) in patients with the irritable colon syndrome, chlordiazepoxide decreases the stress-related increase in colonic motility.",

    "62": "Neurobiological changes induced by social isolation of mice are used to characterize pharmacological influences of lithium and several other drugs. Lithium is able to prevent not only early serotoninergic changes but also enhanced aggressiveness and enhanced spontaneous locomotion, seen after long term isolation.

    "63": "The present study investigated in rats whether variables which may affect the animals' tolerance for delay of reward could be critical for the benzodiazepine-induced release of punished behavior. Rats were subjected to conflict situations during which signalled FR4 non-punished periods (lights-off) alternated with punished periods of different durations signalled by lights-on stimuli. Lever presses during punished periods resulted in the delivery of both one food-pellet and one electric foot-shock (0.45 mA). The antipunishment effect of diazepam (2 mg/kg IP) clearly depended on the duration of the punished periods, release of punished behavior being observed only when punished periods exceeded 1 min. The duration of punished periods required for diazepam-induced release of responding was affected by factors which modified the contrast between rewards received in punished and non-punished periods. One of these factors was the FR schedule imposed during non-punished periods, since the anti-punishment effect of diazepam was observed during short-lasting (30-s and 1-min) punished periods separated by FR24 non-punished periods. A second factor was the ratio of the durations of punished and non-punished periods: diazepam released behavior during 2-min punished periods when the duration of the intercurrent non-punished periods was 1 min, but not when it was 4 min. The predictability of the duration of the punished periods also modulated the effect of diazepam since: with 1 min punished periods, diazepam released punished responding during the first exposures of the rats to the experimental session, but lost part or all its efficacy in animals extensively trained to the procedure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Pigeons were successfully trained to discriminate 60 mg/kg valproic acid from saline using a two-key drug discrimination procedure. When 5-80 mg/kg doses of valproic acid were administered during generalization tests the percentage of responses directed to the valproic acid-appropriate key varied directly with dose. The effects of administering the training dose of valproic acid at presession injection intervals ranging from 15 to 120 min were described by an inverted U-shaped function; the 30-min interval used during discrimination training engendered the largest percentage of valproic acid-appropriate responses. The discriminative stimulus properties of valproic acid failed to generalize to the anticonvulsant compounds phenobarbital (10, 20 mg/kg), phenytoin (2.5, 5 mg/kg), and ethosuximide (40, 80 mg/kg), indicating that not all anticonvulsant compounds share similar discriminative properties. Clonazepam (0.25, 0.50 mg/kg) and diazepam (1, 2 mg/kg), two benzodiazepines with anticonvulsant properties, produced quite different effects. The stimulus properties of valproic acid generalized to all doses of clonazepam, whereas intermediate generalization was evident with diazepam. Pentylenetetrazol (10, 20 mg/kg), chlorpromazine (5, 10 mg/kg), tripelennamine (2.5, 5.0 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (0.5, 1.0 mg/kg), morphine (1.25, 2.50 mg/kg), and imipramine (2.5, 5.0 mg/kg) induced only saline-like patterns of responding. The concomitant administration of pentylenetetrazol failed to antagonize the discriminative stimulus properties exerted by the training dose of valproic acid.", 
    "65": "A benzodiazepine (oxazepam) was given to nulliparous mice on days 12-16 of pregnancy, and the development and young adult behaviour of the offspring were studied. Experiment 1, using 5, 15, and 50 mg/kg doses given PO twice daily, showed a dose-dependent retardation of postnatal development of several responses such as righting, bar holding, limb placing, and auditory startle. These changes were maximal in the first 2 postnatal weeks and then were markedly attenuated, or disappeared, being apparently related to a temporary retardation of body growth. A reduction of locomotor activity at 60 days was found only in the 50 mg/kg group. The effects of the 15 mg/kg dose on postnatal body growth and neurobehavioural development were replicated in Experiments 2 and 3. Moreover, in these experiments prenatal oxazepam reduced open field activity at 14-16 days and attenuated the hyperactivity induced by dl-amphetamine sulphate (2 mg/kg IP). On the other hand activity, habituation, and response to a scopolamine challenge (2 mg/kg IP) at 21-23 days were not significantly different from those of appropriate controls. Experiment 3, using a cross-fostering procedure, showed that postnatal maternal effects were not responsible for the changes so far mentioned. Experiment 2 also investigated the acquisition of several go-no go avoidance discriminations in a shuttle-box, using either light (L) or buzzer noise (N) as the \"go\" signal, a compound \"no go\" signal (NL in the L-\"go\" groups and LN in the N-\"go\" groups), and either an extinction or a passive avoidance contingency during the \"no go\" signal (4 weeks of training, starting at 60 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Subjects completed a battery of tasks once before and twice after administration of the drugs. Caffeine alone showed no effects on cognitive, learning, and memory performance, but impaired fine motor coordination and increased anxiety and tenseness. Diazepam alone produced sedation, lowered other ratings of subjective moods, and impaired cognitive, learning, and memory performance. The two drugs did not antagonize the effects of each other, except in the symbol cancellation task.", 
    "67": "In order to validate a new animal model predictive of the profile of antiepileptic drugs, we studied the antagonism by standard antiepileptics of the EEG modifications induced by low-speed IV infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in rats. The activity of the drugs was measured by their effects on temporal characteristics of the PTZ-induced EEG paroxysms. Most compounds had moderate to potent anti-PTZ effects, as shown by the changes in the EEG temporal parameters. However, these effects depended on the drugs and doses. Cluster analysis showed that drugs and doses which evoked similar changes were closely related and were included in separate clusters with respect to one another. In particular, the present results showed that benzodiazepines and antiepileptics cluster differently in their effects. Thus, this model could be a useful tool for assessing new antiepileptic drugs.",

AHR-9377 reduced response rates and increased reinforcement rates of rats responding under the DRL 72-s schedule; these effects were similar to those of established antidepressant drugs. AHR-9377 also decreased the time of immobility in the forced-swimming test, an empirical model of depression. These results are consistent with the contention that AHR-9377 possesses antidepressant activity.", 
    "69": "The chemistry and molecular biology of DNA adducts is only one part of the carcinogenic process. Many other factors will determine whether a particular chemical will exert a carcinogenic effect. For example, the size of particles upon which a carcinogenic may be adsorbed will influence whether or not, and if so where, deposition within the lung will occur. The simultaneous exposure to several different agents may enhance or inhibit the metabolism of a chemical to its ultimate carcinogenic form (Rice et al., 1984; Smolarek and Baird, 1984). The ultimate carcinogenic metabolites may be influenced in their ability to react with DNA by a number of factors such as internal levels of detoxifying enzymes, the presence of other metabolic intermediates such as glutathione with which they could react either enzymatically or non-enzymatically, and the state of DNA which is probably most heavily influenced by whether or not the cell is undergoing replication or particular sequences being expressed. Replicating forks have been shown to be more extensively modified than other areas of DNA. Another critical factor which can influence the final outcome of the DNA damage is whether or not the modifications can be repaired. If this occurs with high fidelity and the cell has not previously undergone replication then the effect of the damage by the carcinogen is likely to be minimal. The major area in which progress is needed is an understanding of what this damage really does to the cell such that after an additional period of time, which may be as long as twenty or more years, these prior events are expressed and cell proliferation occurs. Clearly additional stimulatory factors, for example tumor promoting agents such as the phorbol esters or phenobarbital, are often needed. After such prolonged periods it seems likely that the DNA adducts would no longer be present. However, the way in which their earlier presence is remembered is not clear. Simple mutations do not explain all the characteristics of tumor progression and, when it occurs, regression. Even if a specific site mutation does occur then its expression must be under other types of control. Any explanation of the action of DNA modification at the molecular level also requires that account be taken of the diverse nature of the DNA adducts from simple modifications such as methylation to bulkier adducts such as benzo[a]pyrene, aflatoxin or aromatic amines.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "70": "The transient visual-evoked potentials (VEP), recorded in patients suffering from generalized epilepsy, can be characterized by a duplication of the negative peak with a latency of 70-100 ms, a strong increase in amplitude of the negative peak between 80 and 130 ms and the development of a high amplitude slow negative wave following the primary complex. In this study we have investigated to which degree these changes are influenced by the intravenous administration of clonazepam and sodium valproate. Therefore, VEPs were registered in 30 patients, suffering from generalized epilepsy, just before and immediately after the intravenous injection of 0.4-0.8 mg clonazepam and further at 15, 30 and 16 min thereafter. The same procedure was applied on 10 patients treated with an intravenous injection of 400 mg sodium valproate. In both groups we found more or less a reduction in number and degree of the mentioned VEP changes. The improvement was associated with a strong decrease in amplitude of the VEP components in the group treated with clonazepam but was not seen in the sodium valproate group.",

In baseline placebo conditions there was a tendency to overestimate the disturbance of sleep. After drug administration, sleeping was overestimated. Within both subjective and objective measures, the magnitude of drug effects was correlated with poor initial sleep. If discrepancies between subjective and objective measures per se were analyzed, a number of correlational factors led to the hypothesis that psychological characteristics of a given population play a primary role: populations overestimating their sleep disturbances also tended to overestimate hypnotic drug effects. However, overestimations of drug effects were not correlated with type of drug or objective measures of sleep disturbance before treatment.",

Female Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to a stable baseline of punished and unpunished responses in the CSD paradigm. In Experiment 1, a control group (1) received vehicle after the CSD session on each of seven drug test days, while group 2 was treated with 3.0 mg/kg diazepam IP after each of these sessions. On drug test days 8-12, diazepam was administered to both groups before the CSD session. Drug test days were separated by 2-3 days when the animals were untreated but performed in the CSD. Prior exposure to diazepam in group 2 after sessions 1-7 conditioned the animals so that a greater release in punished behavior was seen during sessions 8-12 than in the control group (1). In Experiment 2, one group (3) of rats was administered diazepam vehicle after the CSD session for 4 drug test days and another group (4) was injected with 5.6 mg/kg diazepam after the CSD session on these same days. On the next 4 drug test days both groups received diazepam before they performed in the CSD. An ITP was observed in both the control (3) and the drug-conditioned (4) group, although the ITP was less obvious in the conditioned group.

On alternate (control) days they received vehicle injections and were confined for 30 min to the opposite side. At almost all doses tested, diazepam produced place preference for the distinctive compartment that had been previously associated with the drug. Preference for the drug side developed regardless of whether diazepam was paired or unpaired with the least-preferred side, and regardless of whether testing was carried out in the undrugged or in the drugged state. The rats preferred the drug side over a novel compartment, but they did not change their initial preference for the side when diazepam was given after removal from the training box. Animals injected with meprobamate (70 mg/kg, PO), a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic, also developed conditioned preference for the drug side, comparable to that seen following cocaine hydrochloride (10 mg/kg, IP). The diazepam (2.5 mg/kg)-induced place preference was antagonized by CGS 8216 (3 mg/kg, IP), picrotoxin (2 mg/kg, IP) and naloxone (0.8 mg/kg, SC), injected 3 min before and 15 and 20 min after diazepam respectively. Sodium valproate (200 mg/kg, IP) did not influence diazepam (1 mg/kg)-induced place preference. Sodium valproate by itself had marginal effects on place conditioning. Picrotoxin and naloxone, but not CGS 8816, produced place aversion which, in the case of picrotoxin, was due to state dependent learning.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "Ten rats were trained to lever press for food reward on a schedule of differential reinforcement of low rates of response with a 20-s criterion (DRL 20). Ten more were trained on a new schedule of punishment, designed to be comparable to DRL 20 - differential punishment of high rates of response (DPH 20). Under this schedule, responses with a latency of 20 s or more earned food rewards, while those of less than 20 s were followed by food reward and brief electric footshock. After 42 sessions, rats on each schedule showed temporal discrimination in the distribution of inter-response times. The effects on these baselines of the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 1 mg/kg IP) and the beta-blocker propranolol (2, 5 and 10 mg/kg IP) were investigated. Both drugs reduced numbers of responses reaching criterion (criterion responses) in DPH, CDP increasing total responses. CDP acted similarly under DRL, but propranolol only affected performance at the highest dose, which reduced criterion responses, probably because of changes in total responding. Each drug increased response bursts. It is concluded that propranolol can exert a disinhibitory action in these schedules, although with some differences from that of the benzodiazepine CDP.", 
    "76": "Eighteen non-anxious volunteers underwent sleep recordings and daytime tests of sleepiness, performance, and mood while receiving, either alprazolam 0.5 mg b.i.d. or diazepam 5 mg b.i.d. for 7 consecutive days. Recordings and tests were done before treatment and on the 1st and 7th days of treatment. Nocturnal sleep changes were similar for both groups; there were no statistically significant changes in mood. However, levels of daytime sleepiness differed. Alprazolam subjects showed more daytime sedation than diazepam subjects on treatment day 1, but showed a significant decrease in Day 1-7 daytime sedation. Although diazepam subjects were less sedated at the onset, they showed no tolerance to this effect; thus by treatment day 7, the two groups did not differ in levels of daytime sleepiness. Results suggested that tolerance to alprazolam's sedative effects (which develops during the 1st week of treatment) may be separable from tolerance to its antianxiety effects (which develops after at least 4 weeks). As daytime sedation is common and potentially dangerous with most anxiolytics, selective tolerance to this side effect is highly desirable.", 
    "77": "These experiments assessed the influence of two variables, age of subjects and time of drug administration, on the reinforcing properties of amphetamine and of diazepam in normal volunteers. Three groups of subjects were tested: i) a group of 40-55-year-old subjects (AGE group; N = 11) who were tested in the morning, ii) a group of 21-35-year-old subjects (CTL group; N = 12) who were also tested in the morning, and iii) a group of 21-35-year-olds who were tested in the late afternoon (AFT group; N = 13). All subjects participated in three separate experiments comparing one drug (5 mg d,l-amphetamine, 5 mg diazepam or 10 mg diazepam) to placebo. Each experiment consisted of nine sessions: On the first four sessions subjects sampled two color-coded capsules on alternate sessions and on the following five sessions they chose and ingested the capsule they preferred. Subjective effects of the drugs were monitored using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) and a shortened version of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI). Subjects in all three groups chose 5 mg diazepam as often as placebo but preferred placebo to 10 mg diazepam. In contrast, they chose amphetamine either as often as or more often than placebo. The subjective effects of diazepam (i.e. sedation) were similar across all three groups, but after amphetamine the AGE group showed greater stimulant effects. In addition, the AFT group showed fewer positive mood effects after amphetamine than the CTL group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Adult male baboons were trained on a psychophysical procedure that measured detection thresholds and reaction times for pure tone and white light stimuli. Intramuscular injections of diazepam or triazolam were given 30 min before session onset; stimulus intensity was randomly varied from trial to trial, and four to five estimates of sensory thresholds and reaction times were obtained throughout each session. Diazepam produced dose-related elevations of both auditory and visual thresholds and reaction times. Effects of a single high dose of diazepam were apparent 4-5 days after administration. Triazolam was approximately 100 times more potent than diazepam in elevating reaction times and visual thresholds, but did not elevate auditory thresholds. There were no residual effects of triazolam on the day after dosing. These results suggest that diazepam and triazolam produce qualitatively similar effects on basic psychophysical function, but that they can be differentiated on the basis of sensory modality changes and post-drug recovery time."
