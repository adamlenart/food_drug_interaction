    "0": "An unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months. They were weekly evaluated during the 2 months of clonazepam administration and monthly during the follow-up period using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a Self-report Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Patients reported a significant relief and the presence of only mild symptomatology during the clonazepam administration. This improvement was clearly sustained and persisted during a 6-month follow-up period. This study suggests that high potency benzodiazepines like clonazepam, which has serotonergic properties, may be more effective than low-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of some patients with LSD-induced HPPD.",

The experiences of these children were examined during their current procedure and during their first ever procedure. Main outcome measures were the degree of physical restraint used on the child, and the levels of distress and pain experienced by the child during the current procedure and during the first procedure. The family's preference for future procedures was also determined.", 
    "10": "During 102 procedures under GA, restraint was needed on four occasions (4%) when the anaesthetic mask was first applied, minimal pain was reported, and children were reported as distressed about 25% of the time. During 80 SED procedures, restraint was required in 94%, firm restraint was required in 66%, the child could not be restrained in 14%, median pain score was 6 (scale 0 (no pain) to 6 (maximum pain)), and 90% of the parents reported distress in their child. Ninety per cent of families wanted GA for future procedures. Many families reported dissatisfaction with the sedation regime and raised concerns about the restraint used on their child.",

We performed this study to determine whether the sequential use of midazolam and propofol could reduce adverse effects as compared with midazolam alone. We studied 26 patients receiving mechanical ventilation for three or more days after surgery. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups. In Group M, patients were sedated with midazolam alone. In Group M-P, midazolam was switched to propofol approximately 24 h before the expected stopping of sedation. The level of sedation was maintained at 4 or 5 on the Ramsay sedation scale. The sedation agitation scale was evaluated for 24 h after extubation. The recovery time from stopping of sedation to extubation was significantly shorter in Group M-P (1.3 +/- 0.4 h) compared with Group M (4.0 +/- 2.4 h). The incidence of agitation in Group M-P (8%) was significantly less frequent than that in Group M (54%). The results indicate that sequential use of midazolam and propofol for long-term sedation could reduce the incidence of agitation compared with midazolam alone.",

In contrast, little is known about the mechanism of action of inert gases that show only narcotic potency at high pressures, such as nitrogen or argon. In the present study, we investigated the effects of selective gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonists on narcosis produced by nitrogen, argon, and nitrous oxide. Pretreatment with the competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonist gabazine (0.2 nmol) but not the GABA(B) receptor antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen (10 nmol) increased the nitrogen and argon threshold pressure for loss-of-righting-reflex (P < 0.005) but had no effect on nitrous oxide narcosis. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (5 nmol) also increased the narcosis threshold pressure of argon (P < 0.025). Given that neither 2-hydroxysaclofen, gabazine, nor flumazenil at the doses used induced hyperexcitability, our results support a selective antagonism by gabazine and flumazenil of the narcotic action of nitrogen and argon. Some mechanisms of nitrogen and argon narcotic action might be similar to those of clinical inhaled anesthetics.",

A special attention is devoted to drugs of the new generation, representing agents with different tropicity toward benzodiazepine and GABA receptor subunits, endogenous and exogenous membrane regulators of these receptors, glutamatergic and serotoninergic anxiolytics, hormones, nucleic acid metabolites, substances influencing energy metabolism, neuropeptides with anxiolytic action, etc. A new classification of anxiolytics based on the mechanisms of their action is proposed.

    "25": "SL651498 (6-fluoro-9-methyl-2-phenyl-4-(pyrrolidin-1-yl-carbonyl)-2,9-dihydro-1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indol-1-one) was identified as a drug development candidate from a research program designed to discover subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor agonists for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder and muscle spasms. The drug displays high affinity for rat native GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(1) (K(i) = 6.8 nM) and alpha(2) (K(i) = 12.3 nM) subunits, and weaker affinity for alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors (K(i) = 117 nM). Studies on recombinant rat GABA(A) receptors confirm these findings and indicate intermediate affinity for the alpha(3)beta(2)gamma(2) subtype. SL651498 behaves as a full agonist at recombinant rat GABA(A) receptors containing alpha(2) and alpha(3) subunits, and as a partial agonist at recombinant GABA(A) receptors expressing alpha(1) and alpha(5) subunits. SL651498 produced anxiolytic-like and skeletal muscle relaxant effects qualitatively similar to those of benzodiazepines (BZs) [minimal effective dose (MED): 1 to 10 mg/kg, i.p. and 3 to 10 mg/kg, p.o.]. However, unlike these latter drugs, SL651498 induced muscle weakness, ataxia or sedation at doses much higher than those having anxiolytic-like activity (MED: 30 to 100 mg/kg, i.p. or p.o.). Moreover, in contrast to BZs, SL651498 did not produce tolerance to its anticonvulsant activity or physical dependence. It was much less active than BZs in potentiating the depressant effects of ethanol or impairing cognitive processes in rodents. The differential profile of SL651498 as compared to BZs may be related to its selective efficacy at the alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-containing GABA(A) receptors. This suggests that selectively targeting GABA(A) receptor subtypes can lead to drugs with increased clinical specificity. SL651498 represents a promising alternative to agents currently used for the treatment of anxiety disorders and muscle spasms without the major side effects seen with classical BZs.", 
    "26": "Calcium channel blockers can get involved in pharmacological interactions when used concomitantly with other drugs. Previous reports indicate a differential influence of various general anesthetics on verapamil pharmacokinetics. A tendency of a faster transfer of verapamil from the central compartment to the tissue compartment was found to be associated with a slower drug return from the tissue at the given verapamil doses during thiopental or propofol anesthesia. Thus, an increased storage of verapamil in tissue compartment and prolongation of the drug action may occur due to those interactions. The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of midazolam on the plasma concentrations and pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil after intravenous bolus administration in rabbits during 2 h of observation. Verapamil and midazolam were administered intravenously at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Verapamil levels in plasma were determined by radioanalysis using [3H]verapamil. Levels of verapamil were determined in plasma at 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 90 and 120 min after the administration, and plasma disappearance was analyzed according to the non-compartmental and 2-compartmental model. After administration of midazolam together with verapamil, a decrease in verapamil concentration in plasma was seen, with an increased verapamil transfer to the tissue compartment, increased steady state distribution volume and shortened residency time of the drug in the plasma.",

Thirty-eight children (55.9%) had refractory status epilepticus and 30 (44.1%) had established status epilepticus. The children with refractory status epilepticus had received intravenous or per rectal diazepam and intravenous phenytoin/phenobarbital (either or both) before continuous infusion of midazolam was given. Fifty-one children received continuous midazolam infusion. In 38 children with refractory status epilepticus, the midazolam infusion was given in addition to the long-acting antiepilepsy drug, whereas 13 (18.8%) children needed only midazolam to control the established status epilepticus. Seventeen (25%) children were controlled with phenytoin sodium alone. Midazolam was given 0.15 mg/kg/minute initially as bolus in 1 minute, followed by 1 to 7 microg/kg/minute as continuous infusion. The status could not be controlled in one child (1.5%) suffering from neurodegenerative disease. Two children needed mechanical ventilation following prolonged apnea after diazepam administration in one and diazepam plus phenobarbital in the other. No metabolic derangements or compromise of vital functions was noted on midazolam infusion. All children made a complete recovery. There was one death related to meningoencephalitis.", 
    "28": "How individual receptive field properties are formed in the maturing sensory neocortex remains largely unknown. The shortening of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor currents by 2A subunit (NR2A) insertion has been proposed to delimit the critical period for experience-dependent refinement of circuits in visual cortex. In mice engineered to maintain prolonged NMDA responses by targeted deletion of NR2A, the sensitivity to monocular deprivation was surprisingly weakened but restricted to the typical critical period and delayed normally by dark rearing from birth. Orientation preference instead failed to mature, occluding further effects of dark rearing. Interestingly, a full ocular dominance plasticity (but not orientation bias) was selectively restored by enhanced inhibition, reflecting an imbalanced excitation in the absence of NR2A. Many of the downstream pathways involved in NMDA signaling are coupled to the receptor through a variety of protein-protein interactions and adaptor molecules. To further investigate a mechanistic dissociation of receptive field properties in the developing visual system, mice carrying a targeted disruption of the NR2A-associated 95-kDa postsynaptic density (PSD95) scaffolding protein were analyzed. Although the development and plasticity of ocular dominance was unaffected, orientation preference again failed to mature in these mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the cellular basis generating individual sensory response properties is separable in the developing neocortex.",

Of the ten studies using a pre-post design, four found an increase in total costs, six reported a decrease in total costs, and four reported increased effectiveness with use of a second-generation antipsychotic. All seven of the simulation studies reported a cost advantage for novel antipsychotics for specific patient populations under certain conditions.",

    "33": "A number of studies have implicated cholinergic activity in the mediation of learning and memory processes. However, the specific role of muscarinic receptors in memory formation mechanisms is less known. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effects of muscarinic antagonist M2 presynaptic receptor, AFDX-116 (0.5mM) and M1 and M3 post-synaptic receptor pirenzepine (100mM), as well as a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (136mM), in the insular cortex (IC) during acquisition and retrieval of conditioned taste aversion (CTA). In addition, we evaluate the effects of those antagonists in cortical ACh release by in vivo microdialysis and the effects on the induction of in vivo LTP in the BLA-IC projection. The results showed that the cortical microinjections of scopolamine and pirenzepine, but not AFDX-116, produced significant disruption in the acquisition of CTA, without effects during retrieval. Microinjections of scopolamine and AFDX-116 produced significant cortical ACh release, while infusions of pirenzepine did not produce any release. Application of scopolamine and pirenzepine diminished induction of LTP in the BLA-IC projection, but not AFDX-116, as compared with vehicle. The induction of BLA-CI LTP seems to be modulated by post-synaptic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and not by pre-synaptic muscarinic receptors. These results suggest a differential involvement of cholinergic receptors during acquisition and retrieval of aversive memory formation, as well as a differential role of muscarinic receptors in the biochemical and electrophysiological processes that may underlay aversive memory.", 
    "34": "The noradrenergic system may play a role in antipsychotic modulation of schizophrenia symptoms. Therefore, the antagonistic potencies of the antipsychotics clozapine, chlorpromazine, risperidone, olanzapine, haloperidol, quetiapine, ziprasidone, iloperidone and aripiprazole were quantified using cell lines expressing the recombinant human alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor, alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor, or dopamine D(2L) receptor. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and idazoxan, were also tested. Alterations in cAMP were measured as changes in luminescence. In the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor cell line, the agonist 5-bromo-6-(2-imidazolin-2-ylamino)quinoxaline (UK14,304) induced a concentration-dependent increase in luminescence. In cell lines expressing alpha(2C) and D(2L) receptors, agonists induced a concentration-dependent reduction in luminescence. Yohimbine and idazoxan were the most potent alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine and iloperidone were the most potent alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor antagonists, and haloperidol and olanzapine were the most potent dopamine D(2) receptor antagonists. Clozapine had the highest alpha(2C)/D(2) selectivity, and iloperidone the highest alpha(2C)/alpha(2A) ratio. It is hypothesised that alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor blockade contributes to improvement of cognitive function.",

Driving performance of subjects returned to placebo levels after 1 week of treatment, except after treatment with mianserin, for which the impairing effect lasted unabated over treatment. Nocturnal doses of sedating antidepressants (i.e., dothiepin, mianserin, and mirtazapine), however, did not produce residual driving impairment when measured the next day. Nonsedating antidepressants (i.e., moclobemide, fluoxetine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and nefazodone) generally did not affect SDLP. However, SDLP rose to unacceptable levels after administration of combinations of nonsedating antidepressants and benzodiazepines with incompatible pharmacokinetic profiles. Correlational analyses demonstrated that conventional tests of psychomotor performance or self-ratings of side effects did not strongly predict antidepressant effects on SDLP. Regression analysis revealed a strong linear relation between antidepressant effects in the standard driving test and the number of patients reporting somnolence in clinical trials with the same antidepressants.",

A high accumulation of both substances was observed in various types of brain tissue (2.17-6.22 microg/g and 2.49-5.11 microg/g). Only small amounts of nitrazepam and 7-aminonitrazepam were detected in the liver (0.059 and 0.113 microg/g, respectively). Large differences in the observed concentrations of nitrazepam and 7-aminonitrazepam among arterial and venous blood samples were thought to be mainly due to dilution of arterial blood by water entering the circulation through lungs at the time of death. Bacterial metabolism of nitrazepam may also have contributed to the observed differences.", 
    "61": "The present article is meant to suggest an approach to the guidelines for the therapy of sleep disturbances in Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients.The factors affecting the quality of life in PD patients are depression, sleep disturbances and dependence. A large review of the literature on sleep disturbances in PD patients, provided the basis for the following classification of the sleep-arousal disturbances in PD patients. We suggest a model based on 3 steps in the treatment of sleep disturbances in PD patients. This model allowing the patient, the spouse or the caregiver a quiet sleep at night, may postpone the retirement and the institutionalization of the PD patient. I. Correct diagnosis of sleep disorders based on detailed anamnesis of the patient and of the spouse or of the caregiver. One week recording on a symptom diary (log) by the patient or the caregiver. Correct diagnosis of sleep disorders co morbidities. Selection of the most appropriate sleep test among: polysomnography (PSG), multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), multiple wake latency test (MWLT), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, actigraphy or video-PSG. II. The nonspecific therapeutic approach consists in: a) Checking the sleep effect on motor performance, is it beneficial, worse or neutral. b) Psycho-physical assistance. c) Dopaminergic adjustment is necessary owing to the progression of the nigrostriatal degeneration and the increased sensitivity of the terminals, which alter the normal modulator mechanisms of the motor centers in PD patients. Among the many neurotransmitters of the nigro-striatal pathway one can distinguish two with a major influence on REM and NonREM sleep. REM sleep corresponds to an increased cholinergic receptor activity and a decreased dopaminergic activity. This is the reason why REM sleep deprivation by suppressing cholinergic receptor activity ameliorates PD motor symptoms. L-Dopa and its agonists by suppressing cholinergic receptors suppress REM sleep. The permanent adjustment according to the progression of the degenerative process of the disease will diminishe aggravation. The following types of sleep-arousal disturbances have to be considered in PD patients: - Sleep Disturbances, Light Fragmented Sleep (LFS), Abnormal Motor Activity During Sleep (AMADS), REM Behavior Disorders (RBD), Sleep Related Breathing Disorders (SRBD), Sleep Related Hallucinations (SRH), Sleep Related Psychotic Behavior (SRPB). - Arousal Disturbances, Sleep Attacks (SA), Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS), Each syndrome has to receive a score according to its severity. III. The specific therapy consists in: LFS: Benzodiazepines & Nondiazepines. AMADS: Clonazepam, Opioid, Apomorphine infusion; RBD: Clonazepam and dopaminergic agonists; SRBD: CPAP, UPPP, nasal interventions, losing weight; SRH: Clozapine, Risperidone; SRPD: Nortriptyline, Clozapine, Olanzepine; SA-adjustment; EDS-arousing drugs. Each therapeutic approach must be tailored to the individual PD patient.", 
    "62": "In vitro studies using biochemical, pharmacological and molecular approaches demonstrated that the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a mitochondrial protein, involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. In vivo animal models and ontogeny studies validated the role of PBR in steroidogenesis. Targeted disruption of the PBR gene in Leydig cells resulted in the arrest of cholesterol transport into mitochondria and steroid formation. Molecular modeling of PBR suggested that it might function as a channel for cholesterol. Indeed, cholesterol uptake and transport by bacteria cells was induced upon PBR expression. Amino acid deletion and site-directed mutagenesis studies identified a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus sequence in the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus of the receptor. In vitro reconstitution experiments demonstrated that the 18 kDa PBR protein binds with high affinity both drug ligands and cholesterol, suggesting that this protein might serve numerous functions considering the critical role of cholesterol in membrane biogenesis and human pathology. In this context, PBR expression correlated with the quality of kidney preservation, indicating that it might serve as an index of kidney and mitochondrial viability during ischemia-reperfusion injury. PBR overexpression was also found to be a prognostic indicator of the aggressive phenotype in breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. Moreover, in Alzheimer's disease brain specimens, PBR levels were increased and paralleled the elevated neurosteroid synthesis observed in specific brain areas. The role for PBR in these pathological conditions remains to be elucidated. paralleled the elevated neurosteroid synthesis observed in specific brain areas.

The aim of this study was to assess the ICF during anaesthesia to test if it can reliably capture the neural control of the cardiovascular system. Twenty-four ASA II or III patients scheduled for cardiac surgery were included in the study. They were allocated in two groups: control, no treatment (group 1, n = 12), and beta-adrenergic blockade by atenolol (group 2, n = 12). Spectra of pulse interval series were computed with a time-frequency method and they were divided into: very low frequency (VLF, 0.000-0.040 Hz), low frequency (LF, 0.050-0.150 Hz) and high frequency (HF, 0.160-0.500 Hz). Normalized power was obtained by dividing the cumulative power within each frequency band (LF or HF) by the sum of LF and HF; the ratio of LF/HF was also calculated. Instant centre frequency is a time-varying parameter that the evolution along time of the gravity centrum of a local spectrum. All spectral indexes were recorded at the following time points: before induction, after induction and before intubation, during intubation, and after intubation. The atenolol group had lower normalized LF and the LF/HF ratio (P < 0.05) higher HF before induction; and lower LF/HF ratio after induction and before intubation (P < 0.05). The ICF was higher in atenolol group at all times. The ICF shifted towards HF frequency after induction and before intubation and shifted towards LF during intubation in both groups. The autonomic nervous system control on the heart through the interaction of sympathetic and parasympathetic reflex mechanisms could be studied by the ICF. The ICF may assess the autonomic cardiac modulation and may provide useful information for anaesthetic management.",

When both drugs were discontinued, his fever and rigidity subsided and biochemical irregularities spontaneously returned to normal, without any complications. Classic neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was diagnosed. Concomitant administration of lithium with olanzapine may place patients at risk for NMS. Clinicians need to be aware of this rare but potentially fatal side effect in patients of all ages, and especially in adolescents receiving both drugs.", 
    "65": "Effects of saiboku-to, a traditional oriental herbal medicine, on diazepam-induced changes in cerebral acetylcholine (ACh) were investigated in rat striatum and hippocampus. Diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased tissue concentrations of the ACh in both regions. The increase was enhanced in rats subacutely treated with saiboku-to (2.0 g/kg, p.o., once a day) for 7 days. Diazepam also decreased release levels of ACh in both regions. The release levels were further decreased in saiboku-to-treated rats. On the other hand, no significant changes in ACh synthesizing and the hydrolyzing enzyme activities in either brain region were observed in saiboku-to-, diazepam- and combination-treated rats. These results suggest that not only is the diazepam-induced increase in tissue ACh due to the inhibition of ACh release but also that saiboku-to potentiates diazepam-induced inhibition of ACh release.", 
    "66": "A few days after her admittance to a hospital for a suicide attempt with benzodiazepines, a 15-year-old girl was found dead in bed. At autopsy, no specific anatomo-pathologic cause of death was identified. Systematic toxicological analysis (HPLC-DAD, GC-NPD, and GC-MS) of postmortem blood and urine revealed the presence of high concentrations of flecainide and its two major metabolites. Flecainide is a class IC anti-arrhythmic drug causing a decreased intracardiac conduction velocity in all parts of the heart. To identify and quantitate flecainide together with its metabolites in blood, urine, and other toxicologically relevant matrices, a new method was developed using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection. All compounds were separated on a Hypersil BDS phenyl column using water, methanol, and 1.5M ammonium acetate in a gradient system. Chromatographic analysis was preceded by an optimized solid-phase extraction procedure on RP-C18 extraction columns. The flecainide concentrations in blood and urine were 18.73 and 28.3 mg/L, respectively, and the metabolites were detected only in urine at the following concentrations: 9.4 mg/L for meta-O-dealkylated flecainide and 8.59 mg/L for meta-O-dealkylated flecainide lactam. Based on these results, it was concluded that the suicide was consistent with an overdose of this anti-arrhythmic drug.", 
    "67": "Measurement of central nervous system (CNS) expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a microglia and macrophage activation marker, by positron emission tomography (PET) would aid clinical management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. To evaluate the utility of examining PBR expression in the CNS as a cellular activation marker in HIV CNS disease, PBR levels were measured in frontal cortex of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques with encephalitis and uninfected animals via PK11195 ligand autoradiography. [(3)H]-(R)-PK11195 binding to both grey matter (P =.017) and white matter (P =.038) was significantly higher in animals with SIV encephalitis (n = 10) versus control animals (n = 3). When PK11195 binding was compared with other microglial/macrophage activation markers (obtained via quantitative image analysis), a strong, significant association was found for both HAM56 (P =.004) and KP-1 (anti-CD68; P =.006) immunostaining in white matter. In contrast, grey matter PK11195 binding did not correlate with HAM56 (P =.46), KP-1 (P =.06), or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunostaining for astrocytic activation (P =.09). The regional nature of these increases in activation within the brain illustrates the crucial need to focus functional neuroimaging analyses of HIV-infected individuals on subcortical white matter to assess activation of microglia and macrophages.", 
    "68": "The observation that systemic administration of the peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) inhibits food intake in mammalian species has led to the hypothesis that endogenous peripheral CCK released from the small intestine during a meal acts as a satiety factor. It was predicted that if CCK does play an important role in satiety, then systemic administration of a specific CCK receptor antagonist should block the effects of the endogenous peptide released during a meal and increase food intake. The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis by investigating the effects of the cholecystokinin(1) (CCK(1)) receptor antagonist N-alpha-3'-quinolinoyl-D-Glu-N,N-dipentylamide dicyclohexylammonium (A70104), which is unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier, on food intake in rats. A70104 (20-200 microg/kg, i.p.) had no any significant effect on the intake of a test meal in rats under different experimental conditions. However, pretreatment of rats with A70104 (50 microg/kg, i.p.) abolished the inhibitory effects of exogenous peripheral CCK (5 microg/kg, i.p.) on food intake. The findings that A70104 had no effect on food intake when administered on its own, but abolishes the suppressant effect of exogenous peripheral CCK, suggest that endogenously released peripheral CCK does not play an important role as a satiety factor in rats.", 
    "69": "The modulation of ionotropic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (GABA-gated Cl(-) channels) by a group of natural and synthetic flavonoids was studied in electrophysiological experiments. Quercetin, apigenin, morine, chrysin and flavone inhibited ionic currents mediated by alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2s) GABA(A) and rho(1) GABA(C) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes in the micromolar range. alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2s) GABA(A) and rho(1) GABA(C) receptors differ largely in their sensitivity to benzodiazepines, but they were similarly modulated by different flavonoids. Quercetin produced comparable actions on currents mediated by alpha(4)beta(2) neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine, serotonin 5-HT(3A) and glutamate AMPA/kainate receptors. Sedative and anxiolytic flavonoids, like chrysin or apigenin, failed to potentiate but antagonized alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2s) GABA(A) receptors. Effects of apigenin and quercetin on alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2s) GABA(A) receptors were insensitive to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Results indicate that mechanism/s underlying the modulation of ionotropic GABA receptors by some flavonoids differs from that described for classic benzodiazepine modulation.",

All the approved BZRAs, depending on their pharmacokinetic profile, improve and maintain sleep. The major recent advance is in the enhanced diversity of the pharmacokinetic profiles of these drugs, and thus in the flexibility available to the clinician in treatment strategy. Also, during the past decade the nature and significance of the side effects associated with the BZRAs and their determinants, dose and half-life, have been identified and clarified. The important remaining question is whether, and how, the efficacy and safety of the BZRAs change with chronic use.", 
    "74": "Tourette's syndrome has been of neurologic and psychiatric interest since the original description of this condition by Gilles de la Tourette in 1885, and it has been associated with a wide variety of treatments over the years. With the advent of advances in neurochemistry and neuropharmacology, a neurobiologic approach has emerged with the application of many drugs from the fields of neurology and psychiatry. In addition, many of the comorbid conditions that coexist, such as attention deficit disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), are amenable to both pharmacologic and behavioral approaches. Drug treatment has included dopamine receptor blockers for tics, dopamine agonists, dopamine depletors, and stimulants for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), noradrenergic drugs for tics and ADHD, serotonergic drugs for OCD, and chemical denervation for involuntary movements with the use of botulinum toxin and stereotactic surgery. It is the purpose of this review to outline the various approaches that are currently available as treatments, realizing that as new drugs are introduced in neurology and psychiatry, they too will find their way into treatment options.", 
    "75": "Farnesylation of Ras, a protooncogene that is frequently mutated in a number of malignancies, is critical for its biologic function. This observation has led to the development of several agents that inhibit farnesyltransferase, known as farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs). The antiproliferative and antitumor effects of these agents have been demonstrated in preclinical and clinical studies. Interestingly, FTI activity does not necessarily rely on ras mutational status, indicating that Ras is not the only FTI target. Clinical data suggest that FTIs, alone and in combination with other agents, have antitumor activity. Further study is needed to determine the precise mechanism of FTI antitumor activity as well as how and where FTIs will be best used clinically.", 
    "76": "Affective dysregulation, impulsivity and cognitive-perceptual difficulties are the psychopathological nuclear dimensions of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). Psychopharmacological treatment may become necessary during episodes of acute decompensation in which suicidal or self-destructive behaviour erupts. Some classes of psychotropic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in diminishing symptom severity and optimising functioning, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, opiate antagonists and antipsychotics. Conventional antipsychotics are the best-studied psychotropic medications for BPD, but nonadherence is often due to their severe side effects. Preliminary data reveal efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in BPD. We describe the impact of the novel antipsychotic drug quetiapine on severe self-mutilation in two female patients with the diagnoses of BPD. In both cases, monotherapeutic treatment with quetiapine was well tolerated and resulted in a marked improvement of impulsive behaviour and, over time, overall level of function. Though promising, our findings have to be regarded as preliminary. Due to the overall paucity of data there still is insufficient evidence to make a strong recommendation concerning continuation and maintenance therapy with atypical antipsychotics in BPD. Thus, there is a clear need for further controlled studies to evaluate pharmacological treatment options for this disorder.", 
    "77": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently the first-line pharmacological agents in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Appropriate treatment for OCD also involves cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), including exposure and response prevention. As there is a time delay in seeing full therapeutic response, and not all patients tolerate SSRIs, there remains an unmet need for additional treatment approaches in OCD. In addition, most responders report only a partial reduction in symptoms. Clonazepam has demonstrated effectiveness in several preliminary reports in treating OCD. Twenty-seven patients with OCD were entered into a 10 week, double-blind, parallel design trial of clonazepam vs. placebo. Overall, only 3 out of 25 patients who had >/= 1 rating on clonazepam/placebo were judged to be treatment responders, by scoring a 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) on the CGI improvement scale. Responders included 2 of 9 in the placebo group and 1 of 16 in the clonazepam group. No significant difference was found between clonazepam and placebo groups on responder/non responder status (Chi(2 )=1.39, df =1,24, p=0.238), nor on change in YBOCS, Ham-A, Ham-D or NIMH scales from beginning to last evaluation carried forward. These findings suggest that clonazepam is not effective as monotherapy in treating OCD. Its effectiveness in specific subgroups of OCD patients with co-morbid anxiety disorders or as an augmentation strategy added to SSRIs remains to be determined.", 
    "78": "The strict division between motor and somatosensory systems might be less distinct than previously thought. Many brain mapping studies have described changes of somatosensory cortex (S-I) after the execution of a motor task, which supports the idea of a profound interconnectedness in the sensorimotor system. Here we report experiments in which we investigated by means of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) mapping the reorganizational capacities in primary somatosensory cortex before and after a Hebbian repetitive co-contraction task of the thumb and arm. We investigated the susceptibility of S-I plasticity to the pharmacological modulation of the GABA-neurotransmitter system by application of the GABA(A) agonist lorazepam. We found that repetitive training induced stable motor learning characterized by a significant improvement of performance. The time differences between the onset of contraction of the deltoid muscle and the abductor pollicis brevis were progressively shortened. The process of motor learning was accompanied by plastic changes in the primary somatosensory cortex as indicated by a significant increase in the dipole strength and a significant shift of the median nerve dipole on the hemisphere contralateral to the exercised side. Moreover, the individual shifts of median nerve dipole location were correlated with the individual improvement in motor performance. After administration of lorazepam, motor learning was significantly suppressed. The behavioural effect was accompanied by an abolition of the N20 dipole shift and an unchanged dipole strength. The results imply that motor learning leads to a profound reorganization in S-I which is subject to pharmacological suppression with the GABA agonist lorazepam.", 
    "79": "Infantile spasms is an age-specific epileptic syndrome in infants and young children. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) has been the mainstay for the therapeutic management of infantile spasms and other developmental epilepsies. Clinical benefits of ACTH in infantile spasms could partially relate to its stimulatory effects on the release of adrenocorticosteroids and neurosteroids. Glucocorticoids, pyridoxine and ketogenic diet therapy have all been used for the treatment of refractory infantile spasms. Recent studies indicate that several newer anticonvulsant agents, which are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) receptors, are as effective as ACTH in acutely controlling infantile spasms. The efficacy of agents that enhance GABA-mediated inhibition (such as vigabatrin and benzodiazepines) for rapid and complete abolition of infantile spasms has been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Ganaxolone, a novel neuroactive steroid has, however, demonstrated outstanding efficacy and better tolerability in children with intractable infantile spasms. Zonisamide, topiramate, deoxycorticosterone and neurosteroids are emerging as effective treatment approaches. These new antiepileptic drugs represent a potential nonhormonal approach for infantile spasms, but additional studies are needed to verify their efficacy and tolerability. Future studies will hopefully identify rational antiseizure drugs that not only control infantile spasms but also abrogate its risk on the development of the brain.",

A 69-year-old man with acute myeloid leukaemic transformation of myelodysplastic syndrome developed mucositis, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea as complications of chemotherapy. This led to poor dietary intake and consequently scurvy. Both cases demonstrated specific and diagnostic cutaneous manifestations of scurvy, particularly perifollicular purpura, ecchymoses and coiled corkscrew hairs. The diagnosis was supported by specific diet history. Ascorbic acid tolerance test was used as a simple laboratory method to confirm the clinical diagnosis.",

    "95": "Oxazepam and related benzodiazepine drugs are used in the treatment of anxiety. All benzodiazepines currently in use share a number of effects, including sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, muscle relaxation, amnesia, and anticonvulsant activity. Oxazepam and four other benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, chlorazepate, diazepam, and flurazepam) were nominated for study by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and by the NIEHS based on their widespread use, use by pregnant women, and the lack of adequate rodent carcinogenicity studies. Oxazepam was evaluated in 14-week and 2-year studies by the NTP, and Technical Report No. 443 contains the results of the studies performed with the Swiss-Webster and B6C3F1 strains of mice. Studies with rats were not initiated at the same time as the mouse studies because adequate carcinogenicity studies of oxazepam with the Sprague-Dawley rat strain had been submitted to the FDA. Subsequently, because of the marked neoplastic responses found in the two mouse strains, the NTP initiated 2-year studies of oxazepam with the F344/N rat. Groups of male and female F344/N rats were exposed to oxazepam (greater than 99% pure) in feed for 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and mouse peripheral blood samples were analyzed for the frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes. 2-YEAR STUDY: Groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats were fed diets containing 0, 625, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm oxazepam for up to 105 weeks. A stop-exposure group of 50 males and 50 females received 10,000 ppm oxazepam in feed for 26 weeks, after which animals received undosed feed for the remainder of the 2-year study. The continuous-exposure concentrations resulted in average daily doses of 25, 100, or 250 mg oxazepam/kg body weight to males and 25, 110, or 220 mg/kg to females. Stop- exposure males and females received an average daily dose of 630 mg/kg during the exposure period. Survival, Body Weights, and Clinical Findings: All 5,000 ppm continuous-exposure and 10,000 ppm stop-exposure males died before the end of the study. Survival of 2,500 ppm continuous-exposure males and females was significantly less than that of the controls. The mean body weight gains of 2,500 and 5,000 ppm males and females were less than those of the controls throughout the study. The mean body weights of 10,000 ppm stop-exposure males were generally less than those of the controls throughout the study; those of 10,000 ppm stop-exposure females were less than those of the controls during the exposure portion of the study but increased steadily after the cessation of dosing at week 27. Feed consumption by exposed groups was similar to that by the controls after week 1 of the study. Treatment-related eye/nasal discharge, hyperactivity when handled, and/or ataxia were observed in exposed male and female rats on or about day 2 of exposure but were no longer apparent after day 7. Plasma Oxazepam Determinations: Plasma oxazepam concentrations were measured at the end of the study. The concentrations ranged from approximately 0.5 (625 ppm males) to 2.8 &mgr;g/mL (5,000 ppm females). Pathology Findings: In the standard histopathologic evaluation, the incidence of renal tubule adenoma was slightly increased in male rats exposed to 2,500 ppm and was at the upper limit of the historical control range for this neoplasm in 2-year NTP feed studies. In an extended evaluation (step section) of the kidneys of male rats, the incidences of renal tubule adenoma occurred with a positive trend in exposed groups. In standard and step sections (combined), male rats exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm showed a significant increase in the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and hyperplasia. In addition, the incidences of renal tubule adenoma and hyperplasia were significantly increased in the 10,000 ppm stop-exposure group. The incidences of nephropathy in continuously exposed female rats were significantly greater than in the controls, and the severity of nephropathy increased wised with increasing exposure concentration in males. The incidences of epithelial hyperplasia and chronic inflammation of the forestomach in males exposed to 2,500 and 5,000 ppm and of ulcers in 2,500 ppm males were significantly greater than in the controls. Incidences of mineralization of the glandular stomach in 5,000 ppm and 10,000 ppm (stop-exposure) males and of erosion of the duodenum in 5,000 ppm males were significantly greater than in the controls. Female rats exposed to 2,500 ppm had greater incidences of epithelial hyperplasia, chronic inflammation, and ulcers of the forestomach and of erosion in the glandular stomach. Centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy occurred more frequently in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm males and females than in the controls. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Oxazepam was not mutagenic in any of several strains of S. typhimurium, nor did it induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. These in vitro tests were performed with and without S9 metabolic activation. Results from an in vivo mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test performed on B6C3F1 mice used in a 14-week study were also negative. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, under the conditions of these 2-year dosed-feed studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity in male F344/N rats, based on small increases in the incidences of renal tubule adenomas in exposed groups also exhibiting significantly enhanced nephropathy. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of oxazepam in female F344/N rats exposed to feed containing 625, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm for 2 years or 10,000 ppm for 6 months. Administration of oxazepam to rats resulted in nonneoplastic lesions in the forestomach, glandular stomach, and small intestine as well as centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes in the liver. In addition, nephropathy was increased in incidence in female rats and was markedly increased in severity in male rats, resulting in early mortality at the higher exposure concentrations.

    "97": "The use of sedation at the end of life has aroused ethical controversy, attracting accusations of hastening death by gradually increasing sedative doses. The doctrine of double effect has been introduced as an ethical defense. This study aimed to determine how sedative doses change at the end of life and how often the doctrine of double effect might be relevant.", 
    "98": "Case note review was performed of 237 consecutive patients who died in a specialist palliative care unit. Sedative dose changes during the last week of life were noted and survival from admission was compared between groups of patients receiving no sedation, sedation for 7 days, or a commencement of sedation in the last 48 hours of life. There was detailed review of notes from patients who received a marked increase in sedative dose to explore the applicability of the doctrine of double effect.", 
    "99": "Sedation was given to 48% of patients. Of these, 13% received sedatives for 7 days or more, while 56% commenced sedative use only in the last 48 hours of life. The groups receiving no sedation or sedation for less than 48 hours had the shortest survival from admission (mean, 14.3 and 14.2 days), whereas the 7-day sedation group survived for a mean of 36.6 days (P<.001). Sedative use and dose increased toward the end of life, but the detailed case note review disclosed only 2 cases where the doctrine of double effect may have been implicated.",

    "105": "The binding behavior of a fluorescently labeled muscimol derivative to the GABA(A) receptor was analyzed at rat hippocampal neurons by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. After muscimol had been labeled with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 532, specific binding constants for binding of the dye-labeled ligand (Mu-Alexa) to the GABA(A) receptor were determined. We found a high specific binding affinity of Mu-Alexa with a K(D) value of 3.4 +/- 0.5 nM and a rate constant of ligand-receptor dissociation (k(diss)) of (5.37 +/- 0.95) x 10(-2) s(-1). A rate constant of ligand-receptor association (k(ass)) of (1.57 +/- 0.28) x 10(7) L mol(-1) s(-1) was calculated. The following diffusion coefficients were observed: D(free) = 233 +/- 20 microm(2)/s (n = 66) for free diffusing Mu-Alexa, D(bound1) = 2.8 +/- 0.9 microm(2)/s (n = 64) for the lateral mobility, and D(bound2) = 0.14 +/- 0.05 microm(2)/s (n = 56) for the hindered mobility of the GABA(A) receptor-ligand complex in the cell membrane. Saturation of Mu-Alexa binding was observed at a concentration of 50 nM. A maximum number of binding sites [B(max) = 18.4 +/- -0.4 nM (n = 5)] was found. Similar K(i) values of 4.5 +/- 1.0 nM for nonlabeled muscimol and 8.8 +/- 1.8 nM for Mu-Alexa were found by RRAs using [(3)H]muscimol as a radioligand. A concentration-dependent increase in the level of specific Mu-Alexa binding was demonstrated by the positive cooperative activity of co-incubated midazolam, which was selectively found in GABA(A) receptor-ligand complexes with hindered mobility.",

The extract was tested on spontaneous motor activity, exploratory behaviour, apomorphine induced climbing behaviour in mice and pentobarbital induced hypnosis in rats. The extract caused considerable reductions of exploratory activity, spontaneous motor activity and prolonged pentobarbitone-induced hypnosis in rats. It was also found to attenuate apomorphine climbing in mice. The results suggest that the methanolic extract of Newbouldia laevis may contain principles that have sedative properties.", 
    "107": "Landau - Kleffner syndrome is a rare, functional, age-related epilepsy with aphasia and epileptiform discharges on EEG. The heterogenity of clinical presentations, course, long-term outcome and response to treatment suggests multiple underlying etiologies. Normal children abruptly develop deterioration of language functions along with spike and wave discharges on EEG. Clinical seizures may or may not be present. The aphasia responds poorly to most drugs. Valproic acid and benzodiazepines are most effective. Steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins have shown a variable response. Long-term outcome of aphasia is variable, many patients persist with residual impairment. Important questions regarding etiopathogenesis are unanswered.", 
    "108": "Tetanus is a potentially life threatening disease affecting nearly 50,000 to 1 million people world wide every year. Four major clinical forms of tetanus are described i.e. generalized, cephalic, localized and neonatal. Neonatal tetanus is particularly common in developing countries, due to unhygienic child birth practices, social taboos and improper immunization of pregnant mothers. Management of this disorder involves a team approach and aims at eradicating focus of infection, neutralizing the toxin, controlling spasms and dysautonomia and providing adequate ventilatory and supportive care. Metronidazole may be the preferred antibiotic although penicillin is still used frequently. Adequate wound debridement is necessary to prevent spore germination. Spasms are usually managed by sedatives like diazepam and neuromuscular blocking agents. Magnesium sulphate is an attractive substitute and may be tried if ventilatory facilities are unavailable. Use of baclofen is potentially advantageous but cannot be routinely prescribed. Dysautonomia is difficult to manage and requires therapy with benzodiazepines, morphine, magnesium sulphate, adrenergic blockers and recently tried baclofen therapy. Supportive care including ventilatory assistance are highly essential for successful outcome of the patients. It is imperative that complications are diagnosed early and managed appropriately. Immunization is extremely effective and is the key to prevention. Adequate steps and measures should be taken to increase awareness of this potentially preventable disease.", 
    "109": "The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the benzodiazepines, midazolam and chlordiazepoxide, and the barbiturate, pentobarbital, on spatial learning, in a within-subject, repeated-acquisition and performance procedure adapted to the Morris Swim Task. In the presence of one stimulus arrangement, rats learned to swim to a hidden escape platform that was always in the same location in a swimming pool (performance component). In the presence of a second stimulus arrangement, the platform moved to a different place in the pool for each daily session (acquisition component). All subjects completed six training trials in both components during each daily training session, alternating between the two components within each session. Relatively direct paths to the platform and short escape latencies in the performance component, and steep within-session learning curves in the acquisition component, demonstrated that behavior under each component was controlled by the discriminative stimuli. All three GABA(A) modulators increased swim distances, escape latencies, and slowed swim speed in a dose-dependent manner. Midazolam and chlordiazepoxide, but not pentobarbital, produced selective impairments of swim distances and escape latencies in the acquisition component. Benzodiazepines disrupted acquisition at doses that did not disrupt steady-state performance. Pentobarbital impaired acquisition only at doses that also disrupted behavior during the performance component and reduced swimming speeds.", 
    "110": "It was shown previously that effects of drugs present prior to training sessions could serve as discriminative stimuli. Further experiments have aimed to determine whether a second drug can serve as a mediating stimulus that increases the strength of stimulus control by such pre-session drug effects. Rats were trained in a two-lever discrimination procedure with food reinforcers presented on a tandem variable-interval fixed-ratio (VI-FR) schedule. Injections of nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) or saline were followed after 5 min by administration of midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) as a putative mediating stimulus. The nicotine antagonist mecamylamine (1.0 mg/kg) was administered 5 min after midazolam, to block effects of nicotine during training sessions, as in previous work on pre-session drug effects. Stimulus control was acquired slowly and to an accuracy of only 75%. Midazolam did not facilitate the acquisition or magnitude of nicotine-induced stimulus control. However, extinction tests showed that the presence of midazolam was required for expression of stimulus control by pre-session effects of the training dose of nicotine. The response to nicotine (0.075-0.6 mg/kg) was dose-related, but the dose-response relationship was not dependent upon the presence of midazolam. In a group of rats trained with nicotine and midazolam as above, but without mecamylamine, stimulus control by nicotine was not dependent upon the presence of midazolam. In all cases, overall rates of responding were very low when tests were carried out without midazolam, suggesting the presence of state-dependent learning. The results imply that under appropriate conditions the discriminative stimulus effects of one drug (nicotine) can be mediated by the action of a second substance (midazolam). This finding can be conceptualized in terms of occasion setting, with nicotine serving as the feature and midazolam as the target stimulus. Furthermore, it appears that even when rates of responding show drug-state dependence, this is not necessarily the case for discriminative stimulus effects.", 
    "111": "Utilizing computer-assisted quantitative analysis of the electroencephalogram (EEG) in combination with certain statistical procedures and under specific design conditions, it is possible to objectively evaluate the functional bioavailability of psychotropic substances in the target organ: the human brain. Specifically, one may determine whether a drug is active in the central nervous system (CNS) compared with placebo in humans, the dose effect (including nonmonotonic drug effects along the continuum range of concentrations) and the time effect (including time-dependent pharmacodynamic phenomena as tolerance and sensitization), as well as its activity in relation to the formulation and route of application. Methodological aspects are introduced, discussing the usefulness of evaluating different treatments, doses, time points, states, target variables, electrodes and even different groups. Several issues are raised in relation to acute vs. repetitive administration, particularly those dealing with statistical comparisons when making conclusions about acute, repetitive or superimposed effects, and in relation to human psychotropic interactions, such as mechanistic drug-drug interaction descriptions, drug metabolites and enantiomers, as well as the importance of acquiring drug plasma concentrations, elapse of time and topographic distributions to accurately identify its occurrence. PK-PD modeling is introduced as a tool to enlarge the scope of inferences that can be derived when using pharmaco-EEG. The examples presented in order to develop the arguments are mainly focused on anxiolytic compounds belonging to the different neurochemical groups, benzodiazepines and azaspirones. Questions that have yet to been resolved are also addressed.", 
    "112": "In order to place pharmaco-EEG within the clinical context, the distinction between biomarkers, surrogate endpoints, clinical endpoints and clinical outcomes is introduced. State-of-the-art applications of pharmaco-EEG, together with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling in everyday clinical practice in anesthesiology (semilinear canonical correlation), psychiatry (discrimination between responders and nonresponders to pharmacological treatment using the test dose), neurology (antiepileptic field) and neurophysiology (first-order Markov model of sleep stage transitions) are discussed. The combination of both procedures, although successfully used during some drug development programs (opioids or benzodiazepines), is not widely applied in the clinical scenario where the central nervous system (CNS) is concerned. Much work is still need to develop fully the potentials that pharmaco-EEG together with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling could bring to therapeutics in neuroscience.", 
    "113": "Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling, together with electroencephalography (EEG), have been successfully applied to obtain in vivo pharmacological information of different drugs acting on the central nervous system (CNS) in humans and of the systems with which the drugs interact. Almost all types of variables used to assess the activity of drugs in the human CNS have already been applied in pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic research. However, compared with more traditional approaches to quantify the pharmacodynamics of neuropsychotropic drugs, the EEG method has the advantage of being objective, sensitive, continuous and reproducible. The present review focuses mostly on benzodiazepine pharmacology. A selection of some basic aspects that can be covered using pharmaco-EEG and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling from in vivo studies performed in humans in pharmacological research will be introduced: i) determination of the pharmacological characteristics of a compound; ii) comparison of potencies among drugs; iii) comparison of efficacy among drugs; iv) tolerance development; v) metabolite role; vi) enantiomers; vii) drug-drug interactions; viii) circadian rhythms; ix) factors affecting the observed effect; and x) the gain of physiopathological information about the systems with which drugs interact. Looking at the quantity and quality of the results obtained for the benzodiazepines, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modeling using EEG measures appears to be an ideal tool, and is potentially useful for other drugs acting on the CNS.", 
    "114": "Nonorganic insomnia is a frequent sleep disorder that has a high comorbidity with other psychiatric illnesses. In our sleep outpatient clinic, 41% of the patients showed neurotic, stress-related and somatoform disorders, 31% affective disorders and 1.6% schizophrenia. Sleep laboratory investigations in patients for diagnostic purposes and in normal subjects for the evaluation of drug effects suggest that changes in the sleep architecture of patients with nonorganic insomnia due to psychiatric disorders, compared with normal controls, are opposite to alterations induced by psychotropic drugs intended for their treatment, compared with placebo (key-lock principle). Evidence for this principle was found regarding nonorganic insomnia related to generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorders and benzodiazepines, depressive episodes, recurrent depression or dysthymia and sedative antidepressants and finally schizophrenia and sedative neuroleptics. Polysomnography (PSG) findings of other mental disorders are rather scarce and often depend upon the subtype and stage of the disease. In conclusion, sleep laboratory studies may be helpful for choosing the right drug for an individual insomniac patient.", 
    "115": "Rather than a specific entity, delirium is at the midpoint on a spectrum of potential mental status changes that ranges from full consciousness to deep coma. The extremes are relatively easy to recognize, but other points along the spectrum may go unrecognized or be misdiagnosed. If recognized and treated expeditiously, delirium may be reversed in some patients. It is imperative that those caring for critically ill patients with cancer have the knowledge and tools necessary to identify and manage delirium appropriately. Although all critically ill patients are at risk for delirium, cancer presents additional assaults to the central nervous system via direct tumor invasion or iatrogenic provocations. This article describes delirium in cancer, and addresses diagnostic and management issues across the course of the disease.", 
    "116": "Recently it was demonstrated that exposure of the developing brain during the period of synaptogenesis to drugs that block NMDA glutamate receptors or drugs that potentiate GABA(A) receptors can trigger widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration. All currently used general anesthetic agents have either NMDA receptor-blocking or GABA(A) receptor-enhancing properties. To induce or maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia, it is common practice in pediatric or obstetrical medicine to use agents from these two classes in combination. Therefore, the question arises whether this practice entails significant risk of inducing apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing human brain. To begin to address this problem, we have administered to 7-d-old infant rats a combination of drugs commonly used in pediatric anesthesia (midazolam, nitrous oxide, and isoflurane) in doses sufficient to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia for 6 hr, and have observed that this causes widespread apoptotic neurodegeneration in the developing brain, deficits in hippocampal synaptic function, and persistent memory/learning impairments.", 
    "117": "The extended amygdala, a morphological and functional entity within the basal forebrain, is a neuronal substrate for emotional states like fear and anxiety. Anxiety disorders are commonly treated by benzodiazepines that mediate their action via GABA(A) receptors. The binding properties and action of benzodiazepines depend on the alpha-subunit profile of the hetero-pentameric receptors: whereas the alpha1 subunit is associated with benzodiazepine type I pharmacology and reportedly mediates sedative as well as amnesic actions of benzodiazepines, the alpha2 subunit confers benzodiazepine type II pharmacology and mediates the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines. We determined the localization of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits within the extended amygdala, identified by secretoneurin immunostaining, to define the morphological substrates for the diverse benzodiazepine actions. A moderate expression of the alpha1 subunit could be detected in compartments of the medial subdivision and a strong expression of the alpha2 subunit throughout the central subdivision. It is concluded that the alpha1 and alpha2 subunits are differentially expressed within the extended amygdala, indicating that this structure is compartmentalized with respect to function and benzodiazepine action.", 
    "118": "Two antibodies, raised against the rat GABA(A) receptor alpha1- and gamma2-subunits, were used for an immunocytochemical study of the distribution of these proteins in the chicken brain. The immunoreactive bands obtained by Western blotting and the similar labelling distribution found in the rat and chicken brain support the suitability of these antibodies for the labelling of GABA(A) receptors in birds. We found abundant alpha1 and gamma2 immunoreactivity throughout the chicken brain, mainly in the paleostriata and lobus paraolfactorius, dorsal thalamus and some nuclei of the brainstem. The alpha1-subunit was more abundant in the telencephalon, thalamus and cerebellum, while the presence of the gamma2-subunit was stronger in the optic tectum and brainstem. We also report the autoradiographic distribution of the BZ1 and BZ2 benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in the chicken brain using [3H]flunitrazepam. Benzodiazepine binding was unevenly distributed throughout the chicken brain, and the anatomical distribution of the BZ1 and BZ2 subtypes was similar to that described in mammals. The highest binding values were found in the olfactory bulb, paleostriatum primitivum, optic tectum, nucleus mesencephalicus lateralis pars dorsalis and nucleus isthmi pars parvocellularis, the BZ2 subtype being predominant in the paleostriatum primitivum and optic tectum. A general agreement in the distribution of BZ1 and alpha1 immunoreactivity was observed in structures such as the olfactory bulb, paleostriata, lobus parolfactorius and dorsal thalamus, although some discrepancies were observed in areas such as the optic tectum or nucleus isthmi pars parvocellularis, with high BZ1 binding and low or no alpha1 immunolabelling.",

In a random, age and sex stratified community sample of 3107 older Dutch people (55 to 85 years), respondents were screened on depression with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). In the depressed subsample depressive disorder according to DSM-III was assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS). The use of antidepressants and anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) in the depressed subsample was measured, and associations with age, sex, cognitive impairment, physical health and anxiety symptoms were investigated.",

    "124": "1 Presynaptic muscarinic receptors modulate sympathetic transmitter release. The goal of the present study was to identify the muscarinic receptor subtype(s) mediating inhibition of sympathetic transmitter release in mouse atria, urinary bladder and vas deferens. To address this question, electrically evoked noradrenaline release was assessed using tissue preparations from NMRI, M(2)- and M(4)-knockout, and the corresponding M(2)- and M(4)-wildtype mice, after preincubation with (3)H-noradrenaline. 2 The muscarinic agonist carbachol decreased evoked tritium overflow (20 pulses/50 Hz) in each tissue and strain investigated. After deletion of the M(2)-receptor the maximal inhibition by carbachol was significantly reduced (by 41-72%), but not abolished, in all tissues. After deletion of the M(4)-receptor a moderate and significant reduction of the maximal inhibition by carbachol (by 28%) was observed only in the vas deferens. 3 Experiments with the muscarinic antagonists methoctramine and pirenzepine confirmed that the presynaptic muscarinic receptors were predominantly M(2) in atria and bladder and probably a mixture of M(2) and M(4) in the vas deferens. 4 Experiments in the urinary bladder with the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine and the muscarinic antagonist ipratropium demonstrated that endogenously released acetylcholine predominantly acted through M(2)-receptors to inhibit noradrenaline release. However, the results do not exclude a minor contribution of M(4)-receptors to this endogenous inhibition. 5 In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that the release-inhibiting muscarinic receptors on postganglionic sympathetic axons in mouse atria, bladder and vas deferens represent mixtures of M(2)- and non-M(2)-receptors. The non-M(2)-receptors remain unknown in atria and the bladder, and may represent primarily M(4)-receptors in the vas deferens. These results reveal an unexpected heterogeneity among the muscarinic receptors mediating inhibition of noradrenaline release.", 
    "125": "Patients aged 18 to 73 years and diagnosed with non-organic insomnia according to ICD-10 (F 51.0) were treated in a multicentre, double-blind, randomised parallel group comparison with either 600 mg/die valerian extract LI 156 (Sedonium) or 10 mg/die oxazepam taken for 6 weeks. A total of 202 outpatients with a mean duration of insomnia of 3.5 months at baseline were included at 24 study centres (general practices) in Germany. - Sleep quality (SQ) after 6 weeks measured by the Sleep Questionnaire B (SF-B; CIPS 1996) showed that 600 mg/die valerian extract LI 156 was at least as efficacious as a treatment with 10 mg/die oxazepam. Both treatments markedly increased sleep quality compared with baseline (p <0.01). The other SF-B subscales, i.e. feeling of refreshment after sleep (GES), psychic stability in the evening (PSYA), psychic exhaustion in the evening (PSYE), psychosomatic symptoms in the sleep phase (PSS), dream recall (TRME), and duration of sleep confirmed similar effects of both treatments. Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI) and Global Assessment of Efficacy by investigator and patient, again, showed similar effects of both treatments. Adverse events occurred in 29 patients (28.4%) receiving valerian extract LI 156 and 36 patients (36.0%) under oxazepam, and were all rated mild to moderate. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported in either group. Most patients assessed their respective treatment as very good (82.8% in the valerian group, 73.4% in the oxazepam group). During the 6 week treatment phase Valerian extract LI 156 (Sedonium) 600 mg/die showed a comparable efficacy to 10 mg/die oxazepam in the therapy of non-organic insomnia.", 
    "126": "Anxiety disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders. Typical medications used to treat patients are benzodiazepines or antidepressants that target serotonin (5-HT) activity. The ionotropic 5-HT(3) receptor has emerged as a potential therapeutic target because selective antagonist compounds reduce anxiety in rodents, primates, and humans. 5-HT binds to the extracellular N-terminus of the 5-HT(3A) receptor subunit, but receptor activation is also enhanced by distinct allosteric sites. It is not known if specific molecular subunits of the 5-HT(3) receptor modulate anxiety. To address this issue, we characterized anxiety-like behavior of mice with a targeted deletion of the 5-HT(3A) receptor subunit gene in the light/dark box, elevated plus maze, and novelty interaction animal models of anxiety. 5-HT(3A) null mice exhibited an anxiolytic behavioral phenotype that was highly correlated across behavioral measures. This evidence indicates that the 5-HT(3A) molecular subunit influences anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacotherapy that targets specifically the 5-HT(3A) receptor subunit may provide a novel treatment for anxiety disorders.", 
    "127": "This retrospective study aims to determine whether there is a difference in the additional consumption of alcohol between addicts treated with methadone or dihydrocodeine (DHC) and untreated addicts injecting heroin. 1685 patients admitted for opioid withdrawal between 1991 and 1997 were reviewed. Cross-reference tables and multiple logistic regression analyses were carried out. 28% of patients take more than 40 g of alcohol daily (on average 176 g). We found that patients who are treated with methadone or DHC drink alcohol significantly more often daily than the heroin-dependent patients (p < 0.01). Using multiple regression analyses, the results were confirmed. Additionally, we found that co-abuse of alcohol was predicted by male gender, longer duration of drug use, additional daily consumption of tetrahydrocannabinol and daily consumption of benzodiazepines. Alcohol consumption by opioid-addicted patients treated with methadone or DHC presents a serious medical problem. Co-abuse of alcohol will receive more attention.", 
    "128": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an important physiologic mediator that regulates satiety and gastric emptying. We demonstrated previously that soybean peptone acts directly on rat small intestinal mucosal cells to stimulate CCK release. In the present study, we examined the effects of beta-conglycinin, a major component of soy protein, and its peptone on food intake and gastric emptying after an intraduodenal infusion of beta-conglycinin peptone in relation to CCK release and interaction with the mucosal cell membrane. Intraduodenal infusion of beta-conglycinin peptone inhibited food intake in a dose-dependent manner, but that of whole soy peptone or camostat did not. The suppression of food intake by beta-conglycinin peptone was abolished by an intravenous injection of devazepide, a selective peripheral CCK receptor antagonist. The beta-conglycinin peptone infusion strongly suppressed gastric emptying with marked increases in portal CCK levels. We also observed that the beta-conglycinin peptone dose dependently and more potently stimulated CCK release from isolated dispersed mucosal cells of the rat jejunum than did beta-conglycinin itself. This stimulation corresponded to the binding activity of the peptide or protein to solubilized components of the rat jejunum membrane as evaluated by surface plasmon biosensor. These results indicate that beta-conglycinin peptone suppresses food intake, and this effect may be due to beta-conglycinin peptone in the lumen stimulating endogenous CCK release with direct acceptance to the intestinal cells.", 
    "129": "This study compared levetiracetam (Keppra) with reference antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in the rat pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings showed that i.p. administration of valproate (300 mg/kg), phenobarbital (5 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg) all significantly delayed the appearance of the first epileptic spike discharge in hippocampus as well as synchronous epileptiform activity in hippocampus and cortex. In contrast, i.p. administration of levetiracetam (17 mg/kg) only significantly delayed the appearance of the latter. This was corroborated by findings showing that i.p. administration of levetiracetam (17 mg/kg) significantly opposed pilocarpine-induced increases in the amplitude of the orthodromic population spike in the hippocampal CA3 area of urethane-anaesthetised rats, while valproate (200 mg/kg), phenobarbital (10 mg/kg) and clonazepam (1 mg/kg) had no effect. Pre-treatment i.p. with phenobarbital (10 mg/kg) and clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reversed seizure-induced changes in aspartate and GABA concentrations while valproate (300 mg/kg) significantly reduced aspartate concentrations further. In contrast, levetiracetam (34 mg/kg) significantly counteracted all seizure-induced alterations in amino acid concentrations. Midazolam induced significant seizure protection after microinjection into substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR, 50 nmol), nucleus accumbens (NA, 25 nmol) and caudate putamen (CP, 25 nmol), whereas phenytoin (50 nmol) only showed significant seizure protection after injection into the latter area. Levetiracetam differed by significant seizure protection after injection into SNR (1,000 nmol) and NA (3,000 nmol). These results suggest that levetiracetam is distinct from other AEDs by its ability to selectively suppress synchronisation of neuronal spike and burst firing in hippocampus.", 
    "130": "The aim of this study was to establish if the cholecystokinin (CCK) 2 antagonist L-365,260 augments the analgesic effect of morphine in human subjects with chronic neuropathic pain. This is a randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study of 40 adult subjects taking morphine for neuropathic pain. Each received placebo, L-365,260 30 mg and L-365,260 120 mg in three divided doses daily separated by a washout period in random order. Pain, activity, sedation, sleep and side effects were recorded along with 12 lead ECGs, renal and liver function tests and full blood pictures. L-365,260 failed to augment the analgesic effect of morphine at any of the dose levels used. Side effects were minor. There were no changes in ECGs and biochemical indices were unaltered with its use. The CCK 2 antagonist L-365,260 does not augment the analgesic effect of morphine in subjects with chronic neuropathic pain. L-365,260 was well tolerated and side effects from its use were minor.", 
    "131": "We have recently reported evidence that a simple beta-linked alkylated mannose reversibly increased the magnitude of GABA(A) receptor currents evoked in cultured rat pyramidal neurons whilst concomitantly reducing the incidence of spontaneous synaptic activity. In this present study, the effects of the simple beta-linked disaccharide, lactose was investigated using a [3H] TBOB (t-[3H] butylbicycloorthobenzoate) binding assay in adult rat forebrain and cerebellum membranes. Lactose elicited a significant potentiation of [3H] TBOB binding to well-washed forebrain and cerebellar membranes (mean E(max) values=367 and 287%; mean EC(50) values=1.5 and 30 microM, respectively, N=4). The alpha-linked disaccharides, maltose and sucrose also potentiated [3H] TBOB binding, but with 100-600-fold higher EC(50) values than lactose. The lactose-mediated potentiation of [3H] TBOB in the forebrain and cerebellum was completely abolished in the presence of 0.3 microM GABA. Over the concentration range in which significant potentiation of [3H] TBOB binding was detected, lactose elicited no significant effect upon [3H] flunitrazepam binding. This study demonstrated that lactose can modulate the GABA(A) receptor channel, allosterically coupled to the agonist site, but independent of the benzodiazepine site. Furthermore, lactose displayed differential effects upon forebrain and cerebellar GABA(A) receptors indicating that it may be a novel subtype selective agent.",

    "133": "Several oral glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa antagonists, Sibrafiban, Orbofiban and Lotrafiban, have been studied in large phase III trials; each has failed to provide efficacy and has been associated with increased mortality. Roxifiban has pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties believed to be more favorable than the earlier oral agents. Here, we revisit the controversial hypothesis of platelet activation liabilities of GP IIb/IIIa antagonists. The effects of site occupancy by four fibans (Roxifiban, Sibrafiban, Orbofiban and Lotrafiban) on platelet activation was assessed using P-selectin expression, fibrinogen binding and microaggregate formation. All four fibans inhibited ADP and TRAP-stimulated fibrinogen binding and microaggregate formation in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas P-selectin expression was relatively unaltered. To more vigorously test for activation liabilities, the effects of transition from peak to trough receptor occupancy upon platelet stimulation was analyzed. The high affinity of Roxifiban for resting platelets precluded reduction of site occupancy by dialysis or gel filtration. A method was developed that takes advantage of the rapid equilibrium of Roxifiban between platelets and soluble GPIIb/IIIa. The platelet occupancy is controlled by the ratio of platelet GPIIb/IIIa to soluble GPIIb/IIIa. This method allows in vitro investigation of peak/trough transitions on platelet activation. A decrease in site occupancy from peak to trough of Roxifiban or Sibrafiban did not result in increased activation of platelets. The loss of platelet-bound antagonist upon incubation with purified soluble GPIIb/IIIa returned fibrinogen binding/microaggregate formation to no drug levels. In conclusion, these studies do not provide evidence for an activation liability of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists in vitro.",

Treatment with an atypical antipsychotic, risperidone and olanzapine respectively, resulted in an exacerbation of the parkinsonism. Rivastigmine evidently improved the psychosis, the anxiety and the cognitive, mood and behaviour disorders. Titrated treatment with levodopa improved the mobility without an increase of the psychosis. The treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies is complex. Levodopa can lead to an increase in visual hallucinations. Antipsychotics often cause serious side effects, such as increasing parkinsonism, sedation and cognitive deterioration. Cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine could possibly provide an alternative treatment for the neuropsychiatric symptoms.", 
    "143": "The purpose of the present study was to compare the use of lorazepam plus nitroglycerine (NTG) versus NTG alone in the reduction of cocaine induced chest pain in the emergency department. The secondary objective of the study was to help determine the safety of lorazepam in the treatment of cocaine- associated chest pain. The study was a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial conducted at an university-affiliated urban emergency department (ED). All patients who presented with cocaine-associated chest pain were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included age greater than 45 years, documented coronary artery disease, chest pain of more than 72 hours duration, or pretreatment with nitroglycerin. Patients were given either sublingual nitroglycerine (SL NTG) (Group 1) or SL NTG plus 1 mg of lorazepam intravenously (Group 2) every 5 minutes for a total of 2 doses. Chest pain was recorded on an ordinal scale of 0 to 10 at baseline, and then at 5 minutes after each dose. Adverse reactions to medication were also recorded. Twenty-seven patients met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The average age of these subjects was 34.1 years, and 67% were men. The NTG-only group consisted of 15 patients and the NTG-plus-lorazepam group consisted of 12 patients. Baseline mean chest-pain scores were 6.87 in Group 1 and 6.54 in Group 2, with no differences between groups. Five minutes after initial treatment, mean scores for the two groups were 5.2 and 3.9, respectively, with a difference in means of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8-3.8). Five minutes after the second treatment, the mean scores were 4.6 and 1.5, respectively, with a difference in means of 3.1 (95% CI 1.2-5). Kruskal-Wallis testing showed a significant difference in pain relief between the two study groups (P =.003), with greater pain relief noted at 5 and 10 minutes in the NTG-plus-lorazepam group (P =.02 and P =.005, respectively). All patients in the study were admitted to the hospital, but no patient in either group had an acute myocardial infarction or cardiac complications in the ED. No adverse side effects were noted for either group. The early use of lorazepam with NTG was more efficacious than NTG alone, and appears to be safe in relieving cocaine-associated chest pain.", 
    "144": "We evaluated the effects of the neuroleptic agent propericiazine on animal models of anxiety and memory. Adult male Wistar rats (250 to 350 g) received intraperitoneal injections of propericiazine (0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg), saline, or diazepam vehicle (20% propylene glycol and 80% saline) 30 min prior to the experimental procedure. Animals (10-15 for each task) were tested for step-down inhibitory avoidance (0.3-mA footshock) and habituation to an open-field for memory assessment, and submitted to the elevated plus-maze to evaluate the effects of propericiazine in a model of anxiety. Animals treated with 0.075 mg/kg propericiazine showed a reduction in anxiety measures (P<0.05) similar to that observed in those treated with diazepam. Propericiazine at the doses of 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg had no significant anxiolytic effects (P>0.05) in the elevated plus-maze model of anxiety. Memory was not affected by propericiazine in any of the tests, but was impaired by diazepam. The results indicate a dose-related, inverse U-shaped effect of propericiazine in an anxiety model, but not on memory tasks, perhaps reflecting involvement of the dopaminergic system in the mechanisms of anxiety.", 
    "145": "EEG recordings from sensorimotor cortex show oscillations around 10 and 20 Hz. These modulate with task performance, and are strongest during periods of steady contraction. The 20 Hz oscillations are coherent with contralateral EMG. Computer modelling suggests that oscillations arising within the cortex may be especially dependent on inhibitory systems. The benzodiazepine diazepam enhances the size of GABA(A) IPSPs; its effects are reversed by the antagonist flumazenil. We tested the effect of these drugs on spectral measures of EEG and EMG, whilst eight healthy human subjects performed a precision grip task containing both holding and movement phases. Either an auxotonic or isometric load was used. EEG changes following electrical stimulation of the contralateral median nerve were also assessed. The EEG power showed similar changes in all task/stimulation protocols used. Power around 20 Hz doubled at the highest dose of diazepam used (5 mg), and returned to control levels following flumazenil. EEG power at 10 Hz was by contrast little altered. The peak frequency of EEG power in both bands was not changed by diazepam. Corticomuscular coherence at ca 20 Hz was reduced following diazepam injection, but the magnitude of this effect was small (mean coherence during steady holding in the auxotonic task was 0.062 in control recordings, 0.051 after 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of diazepam). These results imply that 20 Hz oscillations in the sensorimotor cortex are at least partially produced by local cortical circuits reliant on GABA(A)-mediated intracortical inhibition, whereas 10 Hz rhythms arise by a different mechanism. Rhythms generated during different tasks, or following nerve stimulation, are likely to arise from similar mechanisms. By examining the formulae used to calculate coherence, we show that if cortical oscillations are simply transmitted to the periphery, corticomuscular coherence should increase in parallel with the ratio of EEG to EMG power. The relative constancy of coherence even when the amplitude of cortical oscillations is perturbed suggests that corticomuscular coherence itself may have a functional role in motor control.", 
    "146": "Fast inhibitory responses in the central nervous system are mediated by the GABA(A) receptor. The activation and function of the GABA(A) receptor can be modulated by a variety of compounds including benzodiazepines, barbiturates and neuroactive steroids. Modulation of the GABA(A) receptor function by ethanol has been observed in some but not all studies. We have studied the effect of ethanol at concentrations corresponding to light intoxication on the function of the recombinant GABA(A) receptor containing alpha1beta2gamma2 subunits. The experiments were performed both in the absence and presence of low, subthreshold concentrations of a neuroactive steroid. The results demonstrate that, in the presence of the steroid, 0.05 % (9 mM) ethanol potentiates the GABA(A) receptor function by increasing the channel mean open duration. No effect was observed on the channel closed time durations. The data suggest that ethanol influences channel closing with no effect on the affinity of the receptor for GABA or the channel opening rate constant.",

    "168": "Depression and anxiety are among the most common diseases in the United States, thus constituting a substantial financial burden for the health care system. Experimental studies of these affective disorders to date have largely focused on the neurotransmitter pathways with well-established pathophysiologic roles, such as serotonergic, noradrenergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic systems; agents modulating the activity of these pathways are known to be clinically effective. More recently, the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its receptor (the neurokinin-1 receptor [NK1R]) have been implicated in the pathophysiology of affective disorders, including depression. Earlier preclinical and clinical studies, though, did not provide a clear consensus on the role of SP in the regulation of affective behavior and related pathologic conditions. Recent studies in mice clearly demonstrate that both the genetic disruption and acute pharmacologic blockade of the NK1R result in marked reduction in anxiety-like behavior and stress-related responses. In parallel with these behavioral effects, physiologic changes, such as an increased firing rate of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei and a desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT1A inhibitory autoreceptors, were observed. These findings provide further evidence for the regulatory role of the SP-NK1R system in modulation of affective behavior and indicate that its effects are mediated, at least in part, via the serotonergic system. Future studies will attempt to delineate the interaction between the SP-NK1R system and various neurotransmitter pathways in greater detail and to address the specific role(s) of this system in different brain regions.", 
    "169": "Immediate-release (IR) benzodiazepines have a short duration of therapeutic effect and are generally less effective for anxiety than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in reducing concomitant depressive symptomatology. Common criticisms of benzodiazepines also include the patient's tendency to develop a tolerance to the anxiolytic effect and a dependence on the drug itself. The newer extended-release (XR) benzodiazepine formulation was designed to increase efficacy, duration of therapeutic effect, tolerance, compliance, and ease of discontinuation. The XR benzodiazepine alprazolam has shown efficacy in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder comparable to the older benzodiazepine formulations. Pharmacokinetic data show that the XR formulation has a longer therapeutic effect compared with IR formulations, which reduces the potential for breakthrough anxiety symptoms. Data also indicate that the XR formulation has less abuse liability than the IR formulation. This article reviews the efficacy, safety, and discontinuation data from clinical trials of IR and XR benzodiazepines in the treatment of anxiety disorders and provides guidelines to minimize the risk of withdrawal syndrome during benzodiazepine discontinuation.",

With the publication of DSM-III-R, 2 categories were established for the purpose of classifying disorders that involve both anxiety and depression, and that classification system is currently used in DSM-IV as well. These more specific diagnostic criteria have given us a much better understanding of the anxiety spectrum, but have created a need for a better understanding of the place of benzodiazepines in clearly defined indications on the anxiety spectrum. In spite of warnings about side effects, misuse, and dependence, benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed as adjunctive therapy to antidepressants for comorbid anxiety and depression. This article presents data on the prevalence, course, and outcome of comorbid anxiety and depression. It also compares efficacy data from trials of benzodiazepines used alone and in combination with antidepressants for the treatment of anxiety disorders comorbid with depression.",

However, extended-release formulations of these agents may prove to be as effective as the immediate-release formulations, and extended-release agents have clinical benefits that may make them more attractive treatments than the currently available, shorter-acting benzodiazepines. Because of their longer duration of action, extended-release benzodiazepines can protect against breakthrough anxiety and need to be taken only once or twice a day, which may improve compliance in some patients. Because the other standard treatments of panic disorder, the SSRIs, have a slow onset of action, adding an extended-release benzodiazepine to the treatment regimen for the initial 6 to 8 weeks could serve as an effective bridge until the desired SSRI effect is realized.", 
    "172": "Less than one third of people afflicted with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) experience spontaneous remission, and the symptoms of GAD wax and wane throughout a person's life. The burden of GAD may be reduced with psychopharmacologic therapy. The medications with the most evidence of efficacy in GAD are the benzodiazepines, including a new long-acting formulation of alprazolam. These drugs have a low incidence of side effects but may cause physical dependence, withdrawal, and sedation. Antidepressants are also efficacious in GAD but act less quickly than benzodiazepines. Tricyclic antidepressants such as imipramine may substantially reduce symptoms of anxiety but are not considered a first-line therapy because of their side effects spectrum. The extended-release formulation of venlafaxine and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine and sertraline are also efficacious in GAD. While their association with sexual dysfunction may be intolerable for some adults, these drugs may be more appropriate than the benzodiazepines because their chronic use does not lead to dependence. Buspirone also significantly reduces symptoms of GAD and is associated with less sexual dysfunction than SSRIs and less sedation than benzodiazepines. Combining antidepressant and benzodiazepine therapy or medication treatment and psychotherapy may lead to an increase in improvement in patients not responding to 1 treatment approach alone. The most effective treatment for managing the recurrent symptoms of this chronic disorder will remain unknown until more long-term studies using both drug and nondrug therapies are conducted. Remission rates are still only about 40%, signifying the need for improved treatment interventions.",

Compared to nonusers, benzodiazepine-positive arrestees were more likely to be Black, less likely to have a high school diploma, and more likely to be arrested for a drug- or alcohol-related offense. Moreover, analyses indicated that recent barbiturate, heroin, PCP, and marijuana use, as measured by urinalysis, were the strongest predictors of recent benzodiazepine use.
