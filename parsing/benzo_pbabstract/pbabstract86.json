    "4": "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is far and away the most effective treatment for depression and quite effective for a range of other psychiatric conditions that are unresponsive to medication. Electroconvulsive therapy in the developed world has been administered with anesthesia, muscle relaxants, and ventilation since the mid-1950s following 20 years of unmodified treatment. However, in much of the developing world, ECT continues to be administered unmodified because of lack of resources. We review the efficacy of unmodified compared with modified treatment. We also review the potential drawbacks of unmodified treatment including fear and anxiety, worse postictal confusion, fracture risk, and the negative effects of unmodified treatment on how ECT is perceived in the general community. Finally, we consider potential solutions in developing countries to minimize adverse outcomes of unmodified treatment by pretreating patients either with low-dose benzodiazepines or sedating, but not anesthetizing, dosages of anesthetic agents. Randomized controlled trials are necessary before either of these options could be considered an acceptable alternative to completely unmodified treatment when modified treatment is unavailable.",

Zolpidem, an imidazopyridine agonist with a high affinity on benzodiazepine subtype receptor BZ1 (\u03c91), was found to improve clinical symptoms of dystonia in a limited number of case reports. To investigate what subtype of dystonia is responsive to the therapy, we conducted an open label study to assess the efficacy of zolpidem (5-20\u2009mg) in 34 patients suffering from miscellaneous types of dystonia using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS). Patients were entered into the study if they had been refractory to other medications as evaluated by BFMDRS (no change in the previous two successive visits). After zolpidem therapy, the scores in the patients as a whole were decreased from 7.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 to 5.5\u2009\u00b1\u20095.0 (P\u2009=\u20090.042). Patients with generalized dystonia, Meige syndrome/blepharospasm, and hand dystonia improved in the scale by 27.8, 17.8, and 31.0%, respectively, whereas no improvement was found in cervical dystonia patients. Overall response rate among patients were comparable to that of trihexyphenidyl. Zolpidem may be a therapeutic option for generalized dystonia, Meige syndrome, and hand dystonia including musician's.

We investigated the effect of PK11195 in the choriocarcinoma cell line, BeWo. BeWo cells were treated with various concentrations of PK11195, and changes in cell growth, the cell cycle, apoptosis, and related parameters were examined. A WST-1 assay showed that BeWo cells were sensitive to the growth inhibitory effect of PK11195. In contrast, the nonsite selective ligand diazepam has a little effect on these cells. Cell cycle analysis indicated that exposure to PK11195 decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase and increased the proportion in the G0/G1 phases of the cell cycle. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin V staining of externalized phosphatidylserine, by the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and by antibodies directed against histones from fragmented DNA. This induction occurred in conjunction with the altered expression of genes related to cell growth, malignant phenotype, and apoptosis. These results suggest that PK11195 may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of choriocarcinoma.",

Several different synthetic cathinones have been indentified in these products, including mephedrone, 3,4-methylenedioxypyrovalerone (MDPV), and 4-fluoromethcathinone (flephedrone). We report a case of bath salt intoxication with quantitative MDPV and flephedrone levels in a patient's serum and urine, and from the bath salt product.",

He was found to have MDPV levels of 186 and 136 ng/mL in his serum and urine, respectively, and flephedrone levels of 346 and 257 ng/mL in the serum and urine, respectively. The white powder in question was found to contain 143 \u03bcg MDPV and 142 \u03bcg flephedrone per milligram powder. His psychosis and agitation resolved with lorazepam, droperidol, and observation in the emergency department.", 
    "19": "Agitation, psychosis, movement disorders, tachycardia, and hypertension have all been attributed to the use of MDPV; there are no prior reports detailing clinical experience with flephedrone. Considering that our patient's serum flephedrone levels were twofold higher than his MDPV level, it is likely flephedrone contributed to his clinical toxicity. This case suggests the possibility that fluorinated cathinones, such as flephedrone, may have altered metabolism and/or elimination which may affect their course of clinical toxicity. This case highlights the evolving composition of synthetic cathinones found in bath salt products.", 
    "20": "Psychiatrists' decision making about prescribing benzodiazepines (BZD) was evaluated in a community mental health center. An anonymous survey of outpatient psychiatrists in an academic-affiliated public mental health center was conducted using a 45-item questionnaire developed based on the results of a previous study. Sixty-six percent of responses indicate that, at times, psychiatrists experienced requests for behaviors suspicious for abuse, including 'lost/missing prescriptions' and 'use of BZD by others'. Patient characteristics such as 'history of abuse', 'unknown patient', and 'patient use of illicit substances' were occasional or common reasons for NOT prescribing BZDs (75%). The most common contexts in which the majority of our sample was uncomfortable prescribing BZDs involved a patient history of substance abuse, fear of initiation of dependence, diversion, and feeling manipulated by the patient. Time limitations were a dilemma for 20%. Psychiatrist self-reported dilemma and behavior in prescribing BZDs largely reflected concerns with substance abuse and less frequently workload or time issues.",

Results from in vitro and in vivo investigations suggest that lersivirine is a cytochrome P450 (CYP3A4) inducer that is metabolized by CYP3A4 and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 2B7. In order to formally assess the effects of lersivirine on CYP3A4 metabolism and/or glucuronidation, we performed studies aimed at investigating the effects of lersivirine co-administration on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of midazolam, ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel.",

Healthy subjects were co-administered (1) single dose midazolam, a prototypical CYP3A4 substrate, followed by 14 days of lersivirine twice daily with single dose midazolam on the final day of lersivirine dosing or (2) 10 days of once-daily (QD) lersivirine and QD oral contraceptives (OCs; ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel), substrates for CYP3A4, UGT2B7, and/or P-glycoprotein. The effects of co-administration on the PK parameters of midazolam and OCs were assessed.", 
    "23": "At clinically relevant lersivirine doses (500-1,000 mg total daily dose), the mean plasma exposure of midazolam was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by 20-36 %.

Sedation and analgesia were stopped in 35 patients, and extubation was performed in 17 of these. Sedation had to be continued for 24 patients. Time to offset was significantly lower in patients given propofol and remifentanil [mean (95 % confidence intervals) 13.2 (2.3-24) vs. 36.8 (28.5-45.1) h, respectively, p < 0.001]. Patients given propofol and remifentanil needed norepinephrine infusions twice as often (23 vs. 12 patients, p = 0.003). Incidence of pneumonia and 3-month neurological outcome were similar in the two groups.", 
    "28": "Time to offset was significantly shorter in patients treated with propofol and remifentanil. However, the clinical course in 40 % of patients prevented discontinuation of sedation and potential benefits from a faster recovery. The propofol and remifentanil group required norepinephrine twice as often, but both protocols were tolerated in most patients.", 
    "29": "The present work describes successful treatment of permethrin toxicosis in two cats with a novel therapy of intravenous lipid administration. Two cats presented in lateral recumbency and with generalized tremor after they had been incidentally treated with permethrin for flea control by their owners. Initial therapy consisted of diazepam, propofol, bathing, and intravenous fluids. After an initial bolus of 2mg/kg BW pentobarbital a pentobarbital continuous rate infusion (CRI) was started. Both cats received an emulsion of 20% soybean oil and 80% olive oil, commonly used as fat component of total parenteral nutrition in humans, later in the course of therapy. A bolus of 2 ml/kg BW of the emulsion followed by a CRI of 4 ml/kg BW/h for 4 hours was administered via a jugular catheter as reported previously. One cat received two cycles of therapy with intravenous lipid whereas the other cat needed just one application. Both cats recovered completely without requiring any further treatment. In conclusion, administration of intravenous lipids for permethrin toxicosis in cats is a novel treatment approach which seems to be highly effective in shortening the recovery time for permethrin toxicosis and possibly other fat-soluble toxins.",

The present study sought to determine if rats with high (HTR) and low (LTR) thresholds to clonic convulsions induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM differed in the [(3)H]-L-glutamate binding to membranes from discrete brain regions. Compared to the HTR subgroup, the LTR subgroup presented a lower binding of [(3)H]-L-glutamate in the hippocampus, frontal cortex and amygdala plus limbic cortex, suggesting that glutamatergic receptors in these brain regions may underlie the susceptibility to DMCM-induced convulsions.", 
    "31": "Objective of this observational trial is to examine the effects of quetiapine in comparison with olanzapine and risperidone on clinical outcomes and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in routine care. 374 adult persons with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder prescribed antipsychotic maintenance therapy with quetiapine, olanzapine, or risperidone at discharge from inpatient treatment were included. Clinical and psychosocial outcomes were assessed before discharge and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Statistical analyses were conducted by mixed-effects regression models for longitudinal data. The propensity score method was used to control for selection bias. Patients discharged on olanzapine had significantly lower hospital readmissions than those receiving quetiapine or risperidone. The average chlorpromazine equivalent dose of quetiapine was higher than in patients treated with olanzapine or risperidone. No further significant differences between treatment groups were found. Quetiapine and risperidone are less effective in preventing the need for psychiatric inpatient care than olanzapine, and higher chlorpromazine equivalent doses of quetiapine are needed to obtain clinical effects similar to those of olanzapine and risperidone.",

Reducing the amount of training prior to extinction reduced the delay in the effect of CDP typically seen, and CDP had a larger effect in early sessions on mice that had received less training (Experiment 3). There was some evidence that CDP could be blocked by flumazenil (Experiment 4), and CDP withdrawal reversed extinction facilitation (Experiments 5 and 7). With 4-day intervals, DCS administered immediately following extinction sessions, or pre-session CDP, facilitated extinction with 48-trial sessions (experiment 6B). With six-trial sessions, the co-administration of post-session DCS enhanced facilitation produced by pre-session CDP (experiment 6A). Finally, CDP facilitated extinction in a dose-related fashion following training on a two-lever food-reinforced task (Experiment 7).", 
    "35": "The findings are consistent with the hypotheses that two neurotransmitter systems have different roles in operant extinction and that glutamatergic systems are involved in extinction learning and GABAergic systems involved in the expression of that learning. This parallels findings with extinction following Pavlovian conditioning, which has been more extensively investigated.",

Ethanol produced some drug-lever responding (42 %) only in rats discriminating 1.33 mg/kg, whereas the N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and the serotonin receptor agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide occasioned predominantly vehicle-lever responding in all rats.",

DXM produced a profile of dose-related physiological and subjective effects differing from triazolam. DXM effects included increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and emesis; increases in observer-rated effects typical of classic hallucinogens (e.g., distance from reality, visual effects with eyes open and closed, joy, anxiety); and participant ratings of stimulation (e.g., jittery, nervous), somatic effects (e.g., tingling, headache), perceptual changes, end-of-session drug liking, and mystical-type experience. After 400 mg/70 kg DXM, 11 of 12 participants indicated on a pharmacological class questionnaire that they thought they had received a classic hallucinogen (e.g., psilocybin).

These substances are mainly used by adolescents and young adults, mostly in recreational settings like dance clubs and rave parties. These drugs have diverse psychotropic effects, are associated with several degrees of toxicity, dependence and long term adverse effects. Some have been used for several decades, while others are relatively recent substances of abuse. They have distinct pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties, are not easy to detect and, many times, the use of club drugs is under diagnosed. Although the use of these drugs is increasingly common, few health professionals feel comfortable with the diagnosis and treatment. The authors performed a systematic literature review, with the goal of synthesising the existing knowledge about club drugs, namely epidemiology, mechanism of action, detection, adverse reactions and treatment.

    "52": "SM and NM mitochondria were isolated from rats' brains (n=5/group) and treated with various concentrations (5, 10, 100, and 200 \u03bcM) of Ca(2+), with and without CsA (mPTP blocker), CDP (PBR/TSPO blocker) and Ru360 (MCU blocker) pretreatments. Mitochondrial function was determined by mitochondrial swelling, ROS production and mitochondrial membrane potential changes (\u0394\u03a8m).", 
    "53": "At 200-\u03bcM Ca(2+), SM presented mitochondrial swelling to a greater extent than NM. At 100 and 200-\u03bcM Ca(2+), the ROS production of SM was higher than that of NM and \u0394\u03a8m dissipation of SM was also larger. CsA, CDP and Ru360 could reduce ROS production of SM and NM with exposure to 200-\u03bcM Ca(2+). However, only Ru360 could completely inhibit ROS generation in both SM and NM, whereas CsA and CDP could only partially reduce the ROS level in SM. Moreover, CsA and CDP pretreatments were not able to restore \u0394\u03a8m. However, Ru360 pretreatment could protect \u0394\u03a8m dissipation in both SM and NM, with complete protection observed only in NM.",

    "56": "Discovered in the late 1950s by Leo Sternbach, the first benzodiazepine (BZD) chlordiazepoxide was followed by several congeners, which rapidly constituted one of the largest and most widely prescribed classes of psychotropic compounds. After 50 years, BZDs are still routinely utilized not only in psychiatry but, more generally, in the whole of medicine. Despite their high therapeutic index which makes BZDs safer than other compounds like barbiturates, as well as their rapidity of onset, psychiatrists and family physicians are well aware about the controversy that surrounds the wide use - often not adequately based on scientific evidence - of BZDs in many psychiatric disorders. In this overview of international treatment guidelines, systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials, the aim was to provide a critical appraisal of the current use and role of BZDs in psychiatric disorders and their disadvantages, with specific emphasis on anxiety and affective disorders, sleep disorders, alcohol withdrawal, violent and aggressive behaviours in psychoses, and neuroleptic-induced disorders. In addition, specific emphasis has been given to the extent of usage of BZDs and its appropriateness through the assessment of available international surveys. Finally, the entire spectrum of BZD-related adverse effects including psychomotor effects, use in the elderly, paradoxical reactions, tolerance and rebound, teratologic risk, dependence, withdrawal and abuse issues was examined in detail.", 
    "57": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate, by means of quantitative and multivariate analyses, the effects of diazepam on the behavioral structure of the rat's response to pain in the hot-plate test as well as whether such changes are associated with drug-induced effects on anxiety and/or nociception. To this purpose, ten groups of male Wistar rats were intraperitoneally injected with saline, diazepam (0.25, 0.5 and 2 mg/kg), FG-7142 (1, 4 and 8 mg/kg) or morphine (3, 6 and 12 mg/kg). The mean number and mean latency to first appearance were calculated for each behavioral component. In addition, multivariate cluster and adjusted residual analyses based on the elaboration of transition matrices were performed. Three main behavioral categories were identified: exploratory (walking, sniffing), primary noxious-evoked (hind paw licking, front paw licking, shaking/stamping) and escape (climbing, jumping). Although no significant modifications in the latencies of the primary noxious-evoked components were induced by treatment with diazepam or FG-7142, significant effects were provoked by morphine treatment. Multivariate analyses showed that diazepam-induced anxiolysis redirected the rat's behavior toward a more purposeful and effective escape strategy. In contrast, the high level of anxiety induced by FG-7142 caused the behavioral structure to become disorganized and not purposefully oriented. Changes in the organization of behavioral components were observed in morphine-treated animals and mainly consisted of modifications in the primary noxious-evoked and escape components. The findings suggest that the effects of diazepam on the structure of the rat's response to pain in the hot-plate test are more likely attributable to anxiolysis than pain modulation.",

Modafinil has been reported to show an effect in shortening the duration of symptomatic periods, but does not affect the recurrence rate (Huang et al., \"Kleine-Levin syndrome: current status.\" Med Clin N Am 2010;94:557-562). However, no single drug therapy has been consistently successful, despite various psychotropic agents, including lithium, anticonvulsants and antidepressants, having been systematically tried (Arnulf et al., \"Kleine-Levin syndrome: a systematic study of 108 patients.\" Ann Neurol 2008;63:482-492). This study reports a male adolescent with KLS who received several courses of drug therapy, providing a chance to compare differential drug effects over time.",

We enrolled patients treated with high-dose oral bedtime diazepam from 2001-2009. We defined spike percentage as the percentage of 1-second bins containing at least one spike, and calculated it during three randomly selected 5-minute samples of wakefulness throughout the day and during the first 5 minutes of every hour of non-rapid eye movement sleep at night. In this study, patients were considered to demonstrate sleep-potentiated epileptiform activity when their spike percentage during sleep was increased by \u226550% compared with wakefulness. Twenty-nine children (18 boys) were included (median age, 7.4 years). Twenty-four hours after receiving high-dose diazepam, epileptiform activity was significantly reduced (76.7% at baseline vs 40.8% 24 hours after high-dose diazepam; Wilcoxon signed ranks test, Z\u00a0=\u00a0-4.287, P < 0.0001). Seven patients (24.1%) manifested mild, reversible side effects during the first 48 hours after diazepam administration. High-dose oral diazepam effectively and safely reduced epileptiform activity in patients with electric status epilepticus during sleep.",

Data were retrieved from the Clinical Data Analysis and Reporting System. Children aged 0-19 years who received at least one prescription of anticonvulsants were selected. The study period extended from April 1, 2005 to March 31, 2009. The overall prevalence of anticonvulsants prescribing was 2.23/1000 children in 2005. A slight but steady decline in anticonvulsants prevalence was observed throughout the study period. Valproic acid was the most frequently prescribed drug, followed by carbamazepine and benzodiazepine derivatives. The use of newer anticonvulsants rose significantly, by 26.9%. The use of valproic acid remained unchanged, whereas the use of carbamazepine declined by 20%. Among newer drugs, the use of levetiracetam increased fourfold, and that of oxcarbazepine increased 15-fold. In the youngest age group, phenobarbital was the second most frequently used drug. A significant increase in lamotrigine prescriptions was not observed among adolescents. The persistent increase in using newer antiepileptic drugs implies not only an increase in drug expenditure. It also reflects the need to assess cost-effectiveness in terms of long-term outcomes, quality of life, and health economic outcomes.",

    "63": "Adolescents in both treatment groups began and ended the study with significantly lower scores than normalized values of healthy peers on several HRQoL subscales (lower ratings indicate more impaired functioning), especially those assessing psychosocial factors. However, participants receiving olanzapine exhibited greater improvement than those in the placebo group across multiple HRQoL subscales, including the Behavior, Family activities, and Mental health subscales. Reduction in manic symptoms was associated with improvement in HRQoL values.", 
    "64": "As expected, manic adolescents with bipolar disorder exhibit abnormalities in psychosocial, rather than physical factors associated with HRQoL. Treatment with olanzapine had a greater effect on multiple domains of psychosocial functioning compared with placebo, suggesting that in addition to improving manic symptoms, pharmacologic interventions may lessen some of psychosocial deficits experienced by adolescents with bipolar disorder. However, following 3 weeks of treatment, adolescents with bipolar disorder continued to exhibit deficits in several aspects of psychosocial functioning, indicating that additional pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions may be necessary to further improve functional outcome.",

Although in vitro activity loss assays failed to demonstrate CYP3A4 time-dependent inhibition (TDI) with AMG 487, its M2 phenol metabolite readily produced TDI when remaining activity was assessed using either midazolam or testosterone (K(I) = 0.73-0.74 \u03bcM, k(inact) = 0.088-0.099 min(-1)). TDI investigations using an IC(50) shift method successfully produced inhibition attributable to AMG 487, but only when preincubations were extended from 30 to 90 min. The shift magnitude was \u223c3\u00d7 for midazolam activity, but no shift was observed for testosterone activity. Subsequent partition ratio determinations conducted for M2 using recombinant CYP3A4 showed that inactivation was a relatively inefficient process (r = 36). CYP3A4-mediated biotransformation of [(3)H]M2 in the presence of GSH led to identification of two new metabolites, M4 and M5, which shifted focus away from M2 being directly responsible for TDI. M4 (hydroxylated M2) was further metabolized to form reactive intermediates that, upon reaction with GSH, produced isomeric adducts, collectively designated M5. Incubations conducted in the presence of [(18)O]H(2)O confirmed incorporation of oxygen from O(2) for the majority of M4 and M5 formed (>75%). Further evidence of a primary role for M4 in CYP3A4 TDI was generated by protein labeling and proteolysis experiments, in which M4 was found to be covalently bound to Cys239 of CYP3A4. These investigations confirmed a primarily role for M4 in CYP3A4 inactivation, suggesting that a more complex metabolic pathway was responsible for generation of inhibitory metabolites affecting AMG 487 human pharmacokinetics.", 
    "66": "Raising HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) has become an attractive therapeutic target to lower cardiovascular risk in addition to statins. Inhibition of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing particles, leads to a substantial increase in HDL-C levels. Various CETP inhibitors are currently being evaluated in phase II and phase III clinical trials. However, the beneficial effect of CETP inhibition on cardiovascular outcome remains to be established.", 
    "67": "Torcetrapib, the first CETP inhibitor tested in a phase III clinical trial (ILLUMINATE), failed in 2006 because of an increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events that subsequently were attributed to nonclass-related off-target effects (particularly increased blood pressure and low serum potassium) related to the stimulation of aldosterone production. Anacetrapib, another potent CETP inhibitor, raises HDL-C levels by approximately 138% and decreases LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by approximately 40%, without the adverse off-targets effects of torcetrapib (DEFINE study). The CETP modulator dalcetrapib raises HDL-C levels by approximately 30% (with only minimal effect on LDL-C levels) and proved safety in the dal-VESSEL and dal-PLAQUE trials involving a total of nearly 600 patients. Evacetrapib, a relatively new CETP inhibitor, exhibited favorable changes in the lipid profile in a phase II study.",

SMS affects up to 70% of the astronauts during the first 3 days in space. The search for effective countermeasures has led to several nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. The current study focuses on the effects of lorazepam (1 mg), meclizine (25 mg), promethazine (25 mg), and scopolamine (0.4 mg) on the vestibular system, with special focus on the canal and otolith functions separately.", 
    "75": "The study had a placebo-controlled, single blind, repeated measures design. Sixteen healthy volunteers were subjected to a total of 7 test sessions, the first and last being without intake of medication. Semicircular canal function was evaluated by means of electronystagmography and otolith function with unilateral centrifugation. The horizontal semicircular canal function was characterized by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) gain measured during earth vertical axis rotation as well as the total caloric response. The function of the utricles was represented by the utricular sensitivity, reflecting the ocular counter roll relative to the virtual induced head tilt.", 
    "76": "Promethazine significantly decreased the semicircular canal and utricular parameters. Both scopolamine and lorazepam caused only a decrease in the utricular sensitivity, whereas meclizine only decreased the semicircular canal-induced VOR gain.", 
    "77": "The results show that the drugs affected different areas of the vestibular system and that the effects can thus be attributed to the specific pharmacological properties of each drug. Meclizine, as an antihistaminergic and weak anticholinergic drug, only affected the VOR gain, suggesting a central action on the medial vestibular nucleus. The same site of action is suggested for the anticholinergic scopolamine since acetylcholine receptors are present and utricular fibers terminate here. The global vestibular suppression caused by promethazine is probably a consequence of its anticholinergic, antihistaminergic, and antidopaminergic properties. Based on the fact that lorazepam increased the affinity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for the GABA(A)-receptor and its effects on the utriculi, the site of action seems to be the lateral vestibular nucleus.", 
    "78": "Meclizine, scopolamine, and lorazepam selectively suppress specific parts of the vestibular system. Selective suppression of different parts of the vestibular system may be more beneficial for alleviating (space) motion sickness than general suppressive agents. Additionally, this knowledge may help the clinician in his therapeutic management of patients with either semicircular canal or otolith dysfunction.", 
    "79": "There is evidence to suggest that clozapine is underutilized in treatment-refractory schizophrenia. Data from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE), a multi-phase, randomized comparative effectiveness trial for schizophrenia, were used to identify factors associated with choosing randomization to clozapine. Two pathways were available in phase 2 of CATIE: randomization to clozapine or an untried atypical antipsychotic (2E), or randomization to an untried atypical antipsychotic (2T). We examined the proportion of entrants who chose to enter phase 2E due to the lack of efficacy of the phase 1 treatment, along with their demographic and clinical characteristics. Only 31.2% who discontinued phase 1 for lack of efficacy entered phase 2E. In multivariable analysis, males showed significantly increased odds of choosing phase 2E (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.38; confidence interval (CI) = 1.20, 4.70) as did patients with higher Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total scores (AOR = 1.01; CI = 1.00, 1.03), more inpatient days (AOR = 1.06; CI = 1.02, 1.10) and more outpatient visits, (AOR = 1.06; CI = 1.02, 1.11).

    "80": "Previous studies have shown that subjective and objective symptoms of anxiety induced by 7.5% CO(2) inhalation can be attenuated by anxiolytics such as lorazepam and, to a lesser extent, paroxetine. Venlafaxine and pregabalin, two other licensed treatments for Generalised Anxiety Disorder, were used to further investigate the 7.5% and 35% CO(2) models of anxiety in healthy volunteers. Fifty-four participants were randomised to receive either placebo, venlafaxine or pregabalin. Study treatments were dosed incrementally over a three week period, to reach daily doses of 150 mg venlafaxine and 200mg pregabalin by the CO(2) challenge test day. Participants inhaled air 7.5% CO(2) for 20 minutes (single-blind presentation), and a non-blinded single vital capacity of 35% CO(2). Subjective ratings were recorded before and after each inhalation. Both 7.5% and 35% CO(2) inhalations produced the expected effects of increased ratings of symptoms of panic and anxiety, with increased blood pressure and heart rate. No significant treatment effects were found, although there were trends towards a reduction in feeling tense and nervous by both drugs compared with placebo during the 7.5% CO(2) challenge, and a reduction in alertness generally in the venlafaxine group compared with the pregabalin group. In contrast with the clear anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines reported in several previous CO(2) studies, these findings suggest that the anxiogenic effects of CO(2) challenges are not significantly influenced by these serotonergic and GABAergic anxiolytics. This may be due to a lack of sensitivity of the CO(2) challenges in healthy volunteers to these drug types.", 
    "81": "Spermatozoa require a preparatory process called capacitation to fertilize mature oocytes. Two events related to capacitation of mammalian spermatozoa are an increase in intracellular Ca(2+) and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. The sites that regulate intracellular Ca(2+) concentration are plasma membrane and mitochondria. There are different systems for mitochondrial Ca(2+) influx and efflux. Our aim was to study the involvement of mitochondrial Ca(2+) cycle during heparin-induced capacitation in cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa. Samples were incubated at 38\u00b0C for 45 min, in TALP medium, in the presence of: (a) heparin (H), a well known capacitation inducer; (b) H+CGP 37157, a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Ca(2+) efflux; (c) H+RU 360, a specific inhibitor of Ca(2+) influx to the mitochondria and (d) H+CGP 37157+RU 360. In every treatment, capacitation (by CTC), progressive motility (by optical microscopy), viability (by the eosin/nigrosin technique) and protein tyrosine phosphorylation (by Western Immuno-blotting), were evaluated. The addition of CGP 37157 (20 \u03bcM) decreased progressive motility (p<0.05), without affecting capacitation or protein tyrosine phosphorylation, indicating the importance of calcium efflux for maintaining progressive motility. RU 360 (5 \u03bcM) significantly reduced capacitation without affecting progressive motility, sperm viability or protein tyrosine phosphorylation, showing that inhibition of the mitochondrial calcium uptake, negatively affect the capacitation process. The addition of both inhibitors showed the effect of RU 360. According with these results, there would exist a differential participation of the income and outcome mitochondrial calcium carriers, in the capacitation process. In conclusion, this research demonstrates the importance of normal mitochondrial calcium cycle in the achievement of sperm capacitation and the maintenance of progressive motility in cryopreserved bovine spermatozoa.",

A retrospective hospital-based study was conducted to review the profile of all children admitted with diagnosis of tetanus between January 2009 and December 2010. A total of 140 cases of tetanus were admitted; 45 cases of neonatal tetanus (NT) and 77 cases of post-neonatal tetanus (PNT) were studied. Age of presentation of NT was 9.4 \u00b1 1.2 days. Home-delivered children accounted for 86.7% of cases, with 77.8% being attended by untrained birth attendants. Unimmunized mothers accounted for 93.4%. In PNT, otogenic route of infection and trauma were present in 58.4% and 23.3% of cases, respectively. The rate of hospital admission of tetanus remains high. Unlike previously published reports, otogenic route is the most common mode of PNT infection in this study. Improving immunization, increasing deliveries by skilled birth attendants and prompt treatment of suppurative otitis media are the main areas in which public health initiatives need to be focused.",

The most frequent presentation is with chorea (50%), followed by dystonia (42.5 %) and parkinsonism (7.5%). Seven different mutations are known; 6 insertions in exon 4 and a missense mutation in exon 3 with the 460insA mutation in exon 4 being the most common. Brain magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates iron deposition in the basal ganglia and cavitation. Neuropathological studies have shown neuronal loss in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. Ferritin inclusion bodies were demonstrated within neurons and glia. Studies of patient derived fibroblasts and HeLa cells expressing mutant ferritin demonstrate increased iron levels and oxidative stress. These abnormalities have been recapitulated in mouse models of neuroferritinopathy. There is no disease modifying treatement for neuroferritinopathy but benzodiazepines and botulinum toxin may palliate dystonia and tetrabenazine may relieve chorea and facial tics.

Lower comprehension scores in phenobarbitone treated children were found in two studies. In general, adverse effects were recorded in up to some 30% of children in the phenobarbitone treated group and in up to 36% in benzodiazepine treated groups. Evidence of publication bias was found in the meta analyses of comparisons for phenobarbitone versus placebo (8 studies) at 12 months but not at 6 months (6 studies); and valproate versus placebo (4 studies) at 12 months; with too few studies to identify publication bias for the other comparisons.",

The only significant variable in determining response, EFS and OS was duration of initial remission, with patients who had an initial remission >1 year having much worse outcomes overall (response rate 74% vs. 25%, EFS 8% vs. 37% and OS of 16% vs. 39%, P < 0.01 for all). There was an acceptable toxicity profile with one neurological event and no cardiac events observed. The most common grade 3-4 toxicities observed were neutropenia (59%) and thrombocytopenia (68%). This study demonstrated that the novel combination of 2-CDA/Ida was effective and should be considered for incorporation in front line therapy for children with AML.",

Commercially available, simple heterocyclic building blocks such as 4-fluoro-3-nitrobenzoic acid, 2-chloro-3-nitrobenzoic acid, and indoline were utilized for the synthesis of the novel heterocycles. Pictet-Spengler-type condensation was used as a key step to construct tetracyclic indolo-benzodiazepines and indolo-quinoxalines linked with substituted benzimidazoles. Analysis of single crystals of representative compounds showed that these molecular skeletons have the potential to present various substituents with distinct three-dimensional orientations.", 
    "105": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is associated with significant morbidity in children and adolescents, yet only recently have the neuropharmacology and neurophysiology of this condition been studied in youth. Accumulating data suggest structural and functional abnormalities within the brain's fear networks in youth with GAD. Additionally, seven studies examined the efficacy of medications that modulate this system and, in some cases, the direct effects of these medications on structures within these networks (e.g. amygdala, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex [VLPFC]). In this review, we summarize the extant functional, functional connectivity, and structural neuroimaging data in children and adolescents with GAD. In addition, data concerning selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs), atypical anxiolytics, benzodiazepines, and psychotherapy are reviewed in the context of the neurophysiology of pediatric GAD. The existing data suggest abnormal activity within the amygdala, VLPFC, and anterior cingulate cortex, as well as the possibility of impaired connectivity among these brain regions. In addition to numerous cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) trials, five randomized, controlled psychopharmacologic trials primarily in youth with GAD suggest that SSRIs and SSNRIs are effective for this condition. These findings also raise the possibility that functional activity within the amygdala and VLPFC may be altered following successful treatment.", 
    "106": "Lapatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for breast cancer, has been reported to cause idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. Recently, it has been found that lapatinib forms a metabolite-inhibitor complex (MIC) with CYP3A4 via the formation of an alkylnitroso intermediate. Because CYP3A5 is highly polymorphic compared with CYP3A4 and also oxidizes lapatinib, we investigated the interactions of lapatinib with CYP3A5. Lapatinib inactivated CYP3A5 in a time-, concentration-, and NADPH-dependent manner using testosterone as a probe substrate with K(I) and k(inact) values of 0.0376 mM and 0.0226 min(-1), respectively. However, similar results were not obtained when midazolam was used as the probe substrate, suggesting that inactivation of CYP3A5 by lapatinib is site-specific. Poor recovery of CYP3A5 activity postdialysis and the lack of a Soret peak confirmed that lapatinib does not form a MIC with CYP3A5. The reduced CO difference spectrum further suggested that a large fraction of the reactive metabolite of lapatinib is covalently adducted to the apoprotein of CYP3A5. GSH trapping of a reactive metabolite of lapatinib formed by CYP3A5 confirmed the formation of a quinoneimine-GSH adduct derived from the O-dealkylated metabolite of lapatinib. In silico docking studies supported the preferential formation of an O-dealkylated metabolite of lapatinib by CYP3A5 compared with an N-hydroxylation reaction that is predominantly catalyzed by CYP3A4. In conclusion, lapatinib appears to be a mechanism-based inactivator of CYP3A5 via adduction of a quinoneimine metabolite.",

Commonly involved drugs have been reported, but few data exist concerning the different combinations of agents or comparative doses ingested. The present study sought to better characterise the typical patterns of drug overdose that may present via the emergency department. Consecutive adults \u226516\u00a0years of age that presented to York Hospital owing to self-poisoning were studied for 2010-2011 inclusive. The primary outcome measure was reported dose, expressed as a multiple of the defined daily dose (DDD) to allow comparison between different agents. There were 1024 patients, including 622 women (60.7%), and median age was 32\u00a0years (range, 16 to 92\u00a0years). Overdose in men was associated with a higher overall quantity of drugs: arithmetic mean of 20 DDD multiples (95% CI, 15-26) versus 13 (11-15), p\u00a0=\u00a00.001. Overdose involved a single agent only in 538 patients (52.5%). The mean paracetamol dose was 4.0 (95% CI, 3.7-4.3) DDD multiples; the doses of antidepressants (19.4, 17.0-21.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and benzodiazepines (18.0, 12.8-23.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) were comparatively higher. The types of agents involved in self-poisoning and common combinations of agents are characterised. Psychotropic medications were ingested in comparatively larger quantities than analgesic agents and had worse clinical outcome. Further work is required to understand the factors that determine the quantity of drug ingested in patients at risk of drug overdose so as to minimise the risk of significant toxicity.",

    "113": "The dorsal vagal complex of the hindbrain, including the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), receives neural and humoral afferents that contribute to the process of satiation. The gut peptide, cholecystokinin (CCK), promotes satiation by activating gastrointestinal vagal afferents that synapse in the NTS. Previously, we demonstrated that hindbrain administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor antagonists attenuate reduction of food intake after ip CCK-8 injection, indicating that these receptors play a necessary role in control of food intake by CCK. However, the signaling pathways through which hindbrain NMDA receptors contribute to CCK-induced reduction of food intake have not been investigated. Here we report CCK increases phospho-ERK1/2 in NTS neurons and in identified vagal afferent endings in the NTS. CCK-evoked phospho-ERK1/2 in the NTS was attenuated in rats pretreated with capsaicin and was abolished by systemic injection of a CCK1 receptor antagonist, indicating that phosphorylation of ERK1/2 occurs in and is mediated by gastrointestinal vagal afferents. Fourth ventricle injection of a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, prevented CCK-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in hindbrain neurons and in vagal afferent endings, as did direct inhibition of MAPK kinase. Finally, fourth ventricle administration of either a MAPK kinase inhibitor or NMDA receptor antagonist prevented the reduction of food intake by CCK. We conclude that activation of NMDA receptors in the hindbrain is necessary for CCK-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the NTS and consequent reduction of food intake.",

Among the three CSPs, the CSP that is based on (3,3'-diphenyl-1,1'-binaphthyl)-20-crown-6 and containing residual silanol group-protecting n-octyl groups on the silica surface was found to be most effective with the use of 80% ethanol in water containing perchloric acid (10 mM) and ammonium acetate (1.0 mM) as a mobile phase. The separation factors (\u03b1) and resolutions (R(S) ) were in the range of 1.90-3.21 and 2.79-5.96, respectively. From the relationship between the analyte structure and the chromatographic resolution behavior, the chiral recognition mechanism on the CSP based on (+)-(18-crown-6)-2,3,11,12-tetracarboxylic acid was proposed to be different from that on the CSP based on (3,3'-diphenyl-1,1'-binaphthyl)-20-crown-6. In addition, the chromatographic resolution behavior of the most effective CSP was investigated as a function of the composition of aqueous mobile phase containing organic and acidic modifier and ammonium acetate.",

    "133": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a serious and potentially fatal complication of both acute and chronic liver disease, arising as a result of hepatocellular failure, cirrhosis and/or portal-systemic shunting (Ferenci et al, 2002). It reflects a broad spectrum of neuropsychiatric abnormalities, encompassing a range of defects in psychomotor, locomotive, cognitive, emotional and behavioural functions (Prakash and Mullen, 2010). Hepatic encephalopathy is either overt or minimal. While overt hepatic encephalopathy can be diagnosed using bedside clinical tests, minimal hepatic encephalopathy is clinically invisible and requires psychometric testing to diagnose. The rising prevalence of end-stage viral hepatitis-related liver disease, coupled with the growing problem of alcoholic and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, has significantly increased the burden of disease from cirrhosis (Mooney et al, 2007; Fleming et al, 2008), so recognition and appropriate management of the manifestations of decompensating cirrhosis (including hepatic encephalopathy) is essential. Hepatic encephalopathy has a substantial societal burden because of its impact on survival, quality of life and daily functioning, including an impaired ability to drive, leaving patients especially vulnerable to road traffic accidents (Ferenci et al, 2002; Prakash and Mullen, 2010).",

His chief complaints were of severe nausea and abdominal fullness associated with cancerous peritonitis following surgery for gastric cancer. Abdominal fullness was reduced after the initiation of a continued subcutaneous administration of octreotide acetate, but combination therapy with metoclopramide and domperidone did not relieve nausea. The administration of olanzapine orally disintegrating tables (OLZ-ODT) at a dose of 10 mg twice daily was associated with the tendency to reduce nausea. As the symptoms were relieved, palliative care at his home was initiated. The patient's self-discontinuation of OLZ-ODT because the nausea was relieved resulted in its aggravation, but it was relieved again when the administration was resumed. Subsequently, home care was possible for approximately two and half a months without aggravation. Maintaining nausea control well leads to higher-quality care. OLZ-ODT appears to not only be effective for relieving nausea associated with cancerous peritonitis, but is also important for disseminating palliative care at home.",

Down-regulation of GABA-ergic neurons has been demonstrated in people with schizophrenia and treatment with GABA-ergic compounds (including benzodiazepines, valproate) has shown some favorable outcomes. We hypothesized that subchronic MK-801 (0.5 mg/kg 2 times daily for 7 days), post-weaning SI or the two in combination will alter activity in a novel environment and memory in the double Y-maze (a test with a spatial discrimination and spatial alternation component) and that treatment with phenelzine (PLZ), a monoamine oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting antidepressant that also produces a rapid increase in brain levels of GABA, will improve memory. SI rats (n=18) showed increased locomotor activity when exposed to a novel environment but no deficits in the double Y-maze and the combination of SI plus subchronic MK-801 did not alter these effects. Delays did not affect performance in the spatial discrimination component of the Y-maze and decreased performance in the alternation component for saline rats but not MK-801 rats. Treatment with PLZ improved performance in both components of the Y-maze in a dose-dependent manner. Neurochemical analyses confirmed that PLZ increased GABA levels in the brain and changes in levels of dopamine, serotonin and their metabolites were consistent with inhibition of MAO.

In order to better understand the anxiolytic effect of ARBs, we treated rats with LPS (50 \u03bcg/kg) with or without 3 days of pretreatment with the ARB candesartan (1mg/kg/day), and studied cortical benzodiazepine (BZ) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) receptors. We compared the cortical BZ and CRF receptors expression pattern induced by LPS with that produced in restraint stress. Inflammation stress produced a generalized increase in cortical BZ(1) receptors and reduced mRNA expression of the GABA(A) receptor \u03b3(2) subunit in cingulate cortex; changes were prevented by candesartan pretreatment. Moreover, restraint stress produced similar increases in cortical BZ(1) receptor binding, and candesartan prevented these changes. Treatment with candesartan alone increased cortical BZ(1) binding, and decreased \u03b3(2) subunit mRNA expression in the cingulate cortex. Conversely, we did not find changes in CRF(1) receptor expression in any of the cortical areas studied, either after inflammation or restraint stress. Cortical CRF(2) receptor binding was undetectable, but CRF(2) mRNA expression was decreased by inflammation stress, a change prevented by candesartan. We conclude that stress promotes rapid and widespread changes in cortical BZ(1) receptor expression; and that the stress-induced BZ(1) receptor expression is under the control of AT(1) receptor activity. The results suggest that the anti-anxiety effect of ARBs may be associated with their capacity to regulate stress-induced alterations in cortical BZ(1) receptors.",

    "154": "Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are involved at early phases of drug addiction. Even the first in vivo dose of various abused drugs induces glutamate receptor plasticity at the excitatory synapses of these neurons. Benzodiazepines that suppress the inhibitory GABAergic interneurons in the VTA via facilitation of synaptic GABA(A) receptors have induced neuroplasticity in dopamine neurons due to this disinhibitory mechanism. Here, we have tested a non-benzodiazepine direct GABA site agonist 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolol[4,5-c]pyridine-3-ol (THIP) (also known as gaboxadol) that acts preferentially via high-affinity extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. A single sedative dose of THIP (6 mg/kg) to mice induced glutamate receptor plasticity for at least 6 d after administration. Increased AMPA/NMDA receptor current ratio and increased frequency, amplitude, and rectification of AMPA receptor responses suggested persistent targeting of GluA2-lacking AMPA receptors in excitatory synapses of VTA dopamine neurons ex vivo after THIP administration. This effect was abolished in GABA(A) receptor \u03b4(-/-) mice, which have a loss of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. In behavioral experiments, we found neither acute reinforcement in intravenous self-administration sessions with THIP at relevant doses using a yoked control paradigm in mice nor in baboons using a standard paradigm for assessing drug abuse liability; nor was any place preference found after conditioning sessions with various doses of THIP but rather a persistent aversion in 6 mg/kg THIP-conditioned mice. In summary, we found that activation of extrasynaptic \u03b4-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors leads to glutamate receptor plasticity of VTA dopamine neurons, but is not rewarding, and, instead, induces aversion.",

Here we describe the development of an in vitro capsid assembly assay based on the association of CA-NC subunits on immobilized oligonucleotides. This assay was used to screen a compound library, yielding several different families of compounds that inhibited capsid assembly. Optimization of two chemical series, termed the benzodiazepines (BD) and the benzimidazoles (BM), resulted in compounds with potent antiviral activity against wild-type and drug-resistant HIV-1. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analyses showed that both series of inhibitors bound to the N-terminal domain of CA. These inhibitors induce the formation of a pocket that overlaps with the binding site for the previously reported CAP inhibitors but is expanded significantly by these new, more potent CA inhibitors. Virus release and electron microscopic (EM) studies showed that the BD compounds prevented virion release, whereas the BM compounds inhibited the formation of the mature capsid. Passage of virus in the presence of the inhibitors selected for resistance mutations that mapped to highly conserved residues surrounding the inhibitor binding pocket, but also to the C-terminal domain of CA. The resistance mutations selected by the two series differed, consistent with differences in their interactions within the pocket, and most also impaired virus replicative capacity. Resistance mutations had two modes of action, either directly impacting inhibitor binding affinity or apparently increasing the overall stability of the viral capsid without affecting inhibitor binding. These studies demonstrate that CA is a viable antiviral target and demonstrate that inhibitors that bind within the same site on CA can have distinct binding modes and mechanisms of action.", 
    "156": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic agent of the thienobenzodiazepine class. Olanzapine blocks multiple neurotransmitter receptors, including dopaminergic (D(1), D(2), D(3), and D(4)), serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A [5-HT(2A)], 5-HT(2C), 5-HT(3), and 5-HT(6)), adrenergic (\u03b1(1)), histaminic (H(1)), and muscarinic (M(1), M(2), M(3), and M(4)) receptors. Olanzapine has a high affinity for the 5HT(2A) receptor, which is up to 5 times greater than the dopamine receptor, resulting in less propensity to the development of extrapyramidal side effects. The affinity of olanzapine for multiple receptors has lead to the identification of olanzapine as an important agent in the treatment of delirium, nausea, and vomiting. Olanzapine has been demonstrated to have opioid-sparing properties. Olanzapine is principally metabolized by glucuronidation, with a smaller metabolic contribution from the cytochrome oxidase system. Adverse effects of olanzapine include somnolence, postural hypotension, constipation, dizziness, restlessness, and weight gain. The purpose of this article is to outline the pharmacodynamics, pharmacology, and evidence for the use of olanzapine in palliative care.",

A total of 100 heroin users were recruited for this longitudinal prospective cohort study with repeated measures (T0 as baseline, T1 after 9 months, and T2 after 18 months). The psychiatric evaluation and assessment of drug abuse levels were determined by the CIDI and the EuropASI. Additional evaluations included the WHO-DAS II for disability assessment and the UCLA-SSI for social support. The number of days of heroin use in the 30 days previous to each single assessment significantly reduced over time (p < .001). Similar reduction levels were observed for cocaine (p < .05), benzodiazepines (p < .001), and polydrug abuse (p < .001), but not for cannabis and alcohol. The number of injecting occasions reduced in parallel, with increase in days in work and reduction of money spent for drug acquisition activities and money obtained from criminal/illegal activities. The number of subjects experiencing suicidal ideation reduced over time (p < .05). In line with previous suggestions, significant reductions in drug use, criminality, psychopathology, and injecting behavior following treatment exposure for heroin dependence were observed. It is, however, of concern that alcohol and cannabis misuse levels remained unchanged.",

The incidence of TBI was comparable. Although the frequency of craniotomy (13% FO vs. 7% SP) and mortality (17% FO vs. 11% SP) were not statistically different overall, in patients with TBI, there was a higher incidence of NSI (28% vs. 14%, p = 0.015), craniotomy (14% vs. 3%, p = 0.02), and time to initial NSI (446 minutes vs. 193 minutes, p = 0.042) in the FO patients.",

    "171": "All marketed antipsychotics act by blocking dopamine D(2) receptors. Fast dissociation from D(2) receptors may be one of the elements contributing to the lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) exhibited by newer antipsychotics. Therefore, we screened for specific D(2) receptor blockers with a fast rate of dissociation. Radioligand binding experiments identified N-[1-(3,4-difluorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyridazin-3-amine (JNJ-37822681) as a fast-dissociating D(2) ligand. Its D(2) receptor specificity was high compared with atypical antipsychotics, with little activity at receptors associated with unwanted effects [\u03b1(1), \u03b1(2), H(1), muscarinic, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) type 2C] and for receptors that may interfere with the effects of D(2) antagonism (D(1), D(3), and 5-HT(2A)). JNJ-37822681 occupied D(2) receptors in rat brain at relatively low doses (ED(50) 0.39 mg/kg) and was effective in animal models of psychosis (e.g., inhibition of apomorphine-induced stereotypy or D-amphetamine/phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotion). Prolactin levels increased from an ED(50) (0.17 mg/kg, peripheral D(2) receptors) close to the ED(50) required for apomorphine antagonism (0.19 mg/kg, central D(2) receptors), suggesting excellent brain disposition and minimal prolactin release at therapeutic doses. JNJ-37822681 induced catalepsy and inhibited avoidance behavior, but with a specificity margin relative to apomorphine antagonism that was larger than that obtained for haloperidol and similar to that obtained for olanzapine. This larger specificity margin (compared with haloperidol) may reflect lower EPS liability and less behavioral suppression after JNJ-37822681. JNJ-37822681 is a novel, potent, specific, centrally active, fast-dissociating D(2) antagonist with optimal brain disposition, and it is the first compound that allows the evaluation of the potential value of fast D(2) antagonism for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.",

A number of these derivatives bind to the TSPO with K(i) values in the nanomolar/subnanomolar range, show selectivity toward the central benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) and exhibit structure-affinity relationships consistent with a previously published pharmacophore/topological model of ligand-TSPO interaction.", 
    "177": "Phototransformation of the widely used benzodiazepine pharmaceuticals diazepam and human metabolites nordiazepam, temazepam and oxazepam under simulated sunlight in water was investigated. Photolysis experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of humic acids. Half-lives for each of the benzodiazepine pharmaceuticals were <200 h (under all conditions) suggesting that phototransformation is an important process for such chemicals in the photic zone of receiving waters. Due to the observed phototransformation of the benzodiazepines, significant emphasis was placed on identification of the photoproducts. A total of fourteen photoproducts, including benzophenones, acridinones and quinazolinones or quinazolines was identified and measured by liquid chromatography-multistage mass spectrometry (LC-MS(n)). Phototransformation studies were also undertaken on authentic samples of two of the identified photoproducts, 5-chloro-methylaminobenzophenone and 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone, in order to establish the phototransformation pathways. Interestingly, these two photoproducts showed relatively higher persistence than some of the benzodiazepines, suggesting that the fate and effects of photoproducts should also be incorporated into future risk assessments and environmental models of the fate of benzodiazepines.",

As there have been concerns about the accuracy of self-reporting, it is necessary to establish its validity by an objective method. The aim of the study was to examine the concordance between urinary cotinine concentrations and self-reported tobacco use among drug dependents seeking treatment at National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. Eighty consecutive male drug addicts attending the OPD at National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre were interviewed by the clinician. Their tobacco as well as drug use history was recorded, and thereafter their urine sample was analyzed for drug testing. Mean age of the subjects was found to be 33 years (SD: 10). Urinalysis showed high concentration of cotinine (mean \u00b1 SD: 586.40 \u00b1 222.15 ng/ml) in 95% of the subjects. High concordance was observed between self-report of tobacco use and urinary cotinine. The quantity of tobacco consumption and FTND scores were also correlated with the urinary cotinine levels. Urinalysis also showed misuse of opioids, benzodiazepines and antihistaminics. The treatment for tobacco use has been given low priority in the de-addiction centers. Tobacco is highly prevalent among the drug abusers. The effectiveness of the treatment program may be increased by using the combination of urine analysis along with self-report.", 
    "179": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric complex syndrome, ranging from subtle behavioral abnormalities to deep coma and death. Hepatic encephalopathy emerges as the major complication of acute or chronic liver failure. Multiplicity of factors are involved in its pathophysiology, such as central and neuromuscular neurotransmission disorder, alterations in sleep patterns and cognition, changes in energy metabolism leading to cell injury, an oxidative/nitrosative state and a neuroinflammatory condition. Moreover, in acute HE, a condition of imminent threat of death is present due to a deleterious astrocyte swelling. In chronic HE, changes in calcium signaling, mitochondrial membrane potential and long term potential expression, N-methyl-D-aspartate-cGMP and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors alterations, and changes in the mRNA and protein expression and redistribution in the cerebral blood flow can be observed. The main molecule indicated as responsible for all these changes in HE is ammonia. There is no doubt that ammonia, a neurotoxic molecule, triggers or at least facilitates most of these changes. Ammonia plasma levels are increased two- to three-fold in patients with mild to moderate cirrhotic HE and up to ten-fold in patients with acute liver failure. Hepatic and inter-organ trafficking of ammonia and its metabolite, glutamine (GLN), lead to hyperammonemic conditions. Removal of hepatic ammonia is a differentiated work that includes the hepatocyte, through the urea cycle, converting ammonia into GLN via glutamine synthetase. Under pathological conditions, such as liver damage or liver blood by-pass, the ammonia plasma level starts to rise and the risk of HE developing is high. Knowledge of the pathophysiology of HE is rapidly expanding and identification of focally localized triggers has led the development of new possibilities for HE to be considered. This editorial will focus on issues where, to the best of our knowledge, more research is needed in order to clarify, at least partially, controversial topics.",

    "186": "Hypothermia has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in various models of neurological damage. However, its therapeutic effect on pediatric status epilepticus (SE) is still unknown. We conducted a study to investigate whether hypothermia can have an adjuvant effect on pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in immature rats when combined with diazepam treatment. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus was maintained for either 30 min or 60 min, which was followed by injection with diazepam (10mg/kg body weight) and/or treatment with mild hypothermia (core temperature to 33\u00b0C). We found that the spike-wave amplitude and frequency after SE during treatment with diazepam and hypothermia was significantly lower than treatment with diazepam alone. Mild hypothermia significantly reduced the number of cells undergoing necrosis and apoptosis. In addition, \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1 was shown to be up-regulated by SE, while GluR2 was shown to be down-regulated. However, after combination therapy with diazepam and mild hypothermia for 8h, the expression of GluR1 was decreased and GluR2 was increased relative to the levels of diazepam alone treated juveniles. We also found that the expression of mGluR-1a was also decreased relative to diazepam alone. These findings suggest that mild hypothermia might further protect against pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in immature rats by regulating glutamate receptor expression. This study was conducted using a pediatric model of SE so as to gain a better understanding of the role of hypothermia in the developing brain.", 
    "187": "Grooming behavior is an adaptation to a stressful environment that can vary in accordance with stress intensity. Direct and indirect GABA(A) receptor agonists decrease duration, frequency, incorrect transitions and uninterrupted bouts of grooming. Hormonal variation during the different phases of the estrous cycle of female rats also changes the grooming behavior. It is known that GABA(A) agonists and endogenous hormones change anxiety-like behaviors observed in the elevated plus maze test, a classical animal model of anxiety. This study was designed to determine the anxiolytic effect of clonazepam in female rats in different estrous phases and to correlate anxiety behaviors in the elevated plus maze and grooming microstructure tests. Our results show that female rats displayed higher anxiety-like behavior scores during the estrus and proestrus phases in the elevated plus maze and that clonazepam (0.25 mg/kg; i.p.) had an anxiolytic effect that was independent of the estrous phase. Grooming behaviors were higher in the proestrus phase but were decreased by clonazepam administration, independent of the estrous phase, demonstrating the anxiolytic effect of this drug in both animal models. Grooming behaviors were moderately associated with anxiolytic-like behaviors in the elevated plus maze test. Here, we describe the anxiolytic effect of clonazepam and the influence of estrous phase on anxiety. Moreover, we show that the grooming microstructure test is a useful tool for detecting anxiolytic-like behaviors in rats.",

    "192": "We used conscious tethered Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the cardiovascular effects of four sigma-1 (\u03c31 ) agonists and five antagonists, given alone or in combination. All drugs were administered as a single intraperitoneal dose. The agonists were given at doses reported as efficacious in rodent cognition models, while the antagonists were administered at doses neutralizing agonist effects in vivo. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded for 20\u2003min before and 60\u2003min postadministration. Immediately after injection, a sudden, transitory increase in HR and SBP was noted in all animals, because of the stress induced by handling. For both parameters, a peak value (\u0394HRmax and \u0394SBPmax ) and an area under the curve of changes from baseline over the period 5-20\u2003min postinjection (\u0394HR_AUC5-20\u2003min and \u0394SBP_AUC5-20\u2003min ) were calculated. Three of the four \u03c31 agonists (SKF-10,047, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS), Compound 14) significantly reduced \u0394HR_AUC5-20\u2003min value without changing \u0394HRmax , while the fourth one, SA-4503, had no significant effect. None of the antagonists (haloperidol, rimcazole, NE-100, and BD1047) reduced, and even one (progesterone) enhanced the stress-induced effects on HR. No changes in SBP were noted with any compound. When the antagonist NE-100 was administered just before SKF-10,047, it completely reversed the inhibitory effects of the \u03c31 agonist on HR increase. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time the involvement of \u03c31 receptors in the regulation of handling-induced tachycardia in the conscious rat. Although additional investigations are needed to fully understand this role, it might offer new therapeutic perspectives to \u03c31 ligands in the cardiovascular sphere.", 
    "193": "Microfluidic devices fabricated using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) polymer are routinely used for in vitro cell culture for a wide range of cellular assays. These assays typically involve the incubation of cultured cells with a drug molecule or a fluorescent marker while monitoring a cellular response. The accuracy of these assays depends on achieving a consistent and reproducible concentration of solute molecules in solution. However, hydrophobic therapeutic and fluorescent molecules tend to diffuse into the PDMS walls of the microfluidic devices, which reduce their concentration in solution and consequently affect the accuracy and reliability of these assays. In this paper, we quantitatively investigate the relationship between the partition coefficient (log P) of a series of markers routinely used in in vitro cellular assays including [3H]-dexamethasone, [3H]-diazepam, [14C]-mannitol, [3H]-phenytoin, and rhodamine 6G and their absorption into PDMS microfluidic channels. Our results show that the absorption of a given solute into PDMS depends on the hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance defined by its log P value. Specifically, results demonstrate that molecules with log P less than 2.47 exhibit minimal absorption (<10%) into PDMS channels whereas molecules with log P larger than 2.62 exhibit extensive absorption (>90%) into PDMS channels. Further investigations showed that TiO(2) and glass coatings of PDMS channels reduced the absorption of hydrophobic molecules (log P > 2.62) by 2- and 4.5-folds, respectively.",

In healthy individuals, the pACC is involved in cost-benefit evaluation. We developed a macaque version of an approach-avoidance decision task used to evaluate anxiety and depression in humans and, with multi-electrode recording and cortical microstimulation, we probed pACC function as monkeys performed this task. We found that the macaque pACC has an opponent process-like organization of neurons representing motivationally positive and negative subjective value. Spatial distribution of these two neuronal populations overlapped in the pACC, except in one subzone, where neurons with negative coding were more numerous. Notably, microstimulation in this subzone, but not elsewhere in the pACC, increased negative decision-making, and this negative biasing was blocked by anti-anxiety drug treatment. This cortical zone could be critical for regulating negative emotional valence and anxiety in decision-making.",

Intestinal CYP3A4 expression/activity was significantly higher in biopsies with the VDR promoter polymorphisms Cdx2-3731G > A and GATA-1012A > G that increase VDR activation of target genes. Duodenal CYP3A4 mRNA was significantly higher between April and September than between October and March. Midazolam p.o. AUC and oral bioavailability trended higher October through March compared to April through September. These data suggest VDR polymorphisms are predictors of intestinal CYP3A4, and that CYP3A4 intestinal expression varies seasonally--likely related to annual changes in UV sunlight and vitamin D levels.", 
    "200": "In this study we investigated the effect of pre-treatment with 3-alkynyl selenophene (3-ASP) against the increase in responsiveness to pentylenetetrazole [PTZ seizure threshold] and cognitive dysfunction induced by experimental febrile seizures (FS). The effects of 3-ASP were compared to those of diazepam (DZP).", 
    "201": "Young rats, at postnatal day 21, developed seizures after exposure to a stream of heated air to approximately 41\u00b0C. A non-spatial long-term memory and PTZ seizure threshold were determined 30 days after FS. The behavioural seizures were stereotyped followed by facial automatisms, often followed by body flexion. Young rats were pre-treated with 3-ASP (50 and 100mg/kg; per oral route), DZP (1 and 5mg/kg; intraperitoneally) or vehicle.", 
    "202": "3-ASP and DZP pre-treatments were not effective in protecting against seizures induced by FS. 3-ASP pre-treatment protected against the increase in responsiveness to PTZ and cognitive dysfunction induced by FS. DZP pre-treatment was effective in protecting against the increase in responsiveness to PTZ, but not, against the impaired memory induced by FS.", 
    "203": "3-ASP pre-treatment protected against impairment of memory performance in the step-down passive avoidance task and the increase in the susceptibility to seizures caused by FS early in life of rats.", 
    "204": "To compare the prevalence of alcohol and (il)licit drugs in seriously injured drivers in Belgium (BE) and the Netherlands (NL).", 
    "205": "Injured car and van drivers admitted to the emergency departments of five hospitals in Belgium and three in the Netherlands from January 2008 to May 2010 were included. Blood samples were taken and analysed for ethanol (with an enzymatic method) and 22 other psychoactive substances (UPLC-MS/MS or GC-MS).", 
    "206": "In total 535 injured drivers were included in the study (BE: 348; NL: 187). More drivers were found positive for alcohol and drugs in Belgium (52.6%) than in the Netherlands (33.9%). Alcohol (\u22650.1 g/L) was the most prevalent substance in both countries (BE: 42.5%; NL: 29.6%). A similar prevalence was found for amphetamine (BE: 2.6%; NL: 2.2%) and cocaine (BE: 2.3%; NL: 2.1%). In the Netherlands almost no positive findings for cannabis were recorded (0.5%). No driver tested positive for benzodiazepines in the Netherlands compared to 7.3% in Belgium. More injured drivers tested positive for Z-drugs (BE: 1.8%; NL: 0.5%) and medicinal opioids (BE: 3.3%; NL: 0.5%) in Belgium.", 
    "207": "The prevalence of alcohol in seriously injured drivers was 12% higher found in Belgium than in the Netherlands. The prevalence of drugs was similar in both countries except for THC and medicinal drugs, particularly benzodiazepines, with a much higher prevalence in Belgium. In comparison to previous survey there were differences in the prevalence of THC, benzodiazepines and combinations of drugs. Possible explanations are the different matrix used, a bias in study population, or in case of illicit opiates and benzodiazepines a different consumption pattern in the two countries. Alcohol is still the most prevalent substance among the injured driver population and this increased the last 15 years.", 
    "208": "A 24-year-old woman with quadriplegia was admitted with respiratory failure because of pneumonia. She was on multiple medications including diazepam, oxycodone, and amitriptyline, known to be associated with coma blisters, though she did not overdose on any of them. On hospital day 2, she developed multiple blisters on both sides of her right forearm and hand. Skin biopsy showed eccrine gland degeneration consistent with coma blisters. It was felt that hypoxemia from her pneumonia contributed to the development of these blisters, which occurred on both pressure and non-pressure bearing areas of the arm. Coma blisters are self-limited skin lesions that occur at sites of maximal pressure, mostly in the setting of drug overdose. However, coma blisters may occur with metabolic and neurological conditions resulting in coma.", 
    "209": "Insomnia is common among elderly people and nearly 30 to 40% of the adult population also suffer from insomnia. Pharmacological treatment of insomnia include the use of benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine drugs like zolpidem, zaleplon, Zopiclone. Although these drugs improve sleep, their usage is also associated with number of adverse effects, Melatonin, the hormone secreted by the pineal gland of all animals and human beings has been used for treatment of insomnias, since the timing of its secretion in humans as well as in most of the animals coincides with the increase of nocturnal sleep propensity. Because of its short half life, melatonin slow release preparations were introduced for treatment of insomnia. Recently ramelteon, a selective MT1, MT2 receptor agonist with greater efficacy of action in treating insomnia has been used clinically and has been found effective in improving sleep quality, sleep efficacy and also in reducing the sleep onset time when compared to melatonin or slow melatonin preparations. The mechanism of action of ramelteon in improving sleep is discussed in the paper. Another melatonergic drug agomelatine besides acting on MT1/MT2 receptors also displays 5-HT2c antagonism and this drug has been found effective as a novel antidepressant for treating major depressive disorders. Agomelatine besides causing remission of depressive symptoms also improves sleep quality and efficiency. Other antidepressants depressants that are in clinical use today do not improve sleep. There are other melatonergic drugs like tasimelteon, 6-chloromelatonin. But ramelteon and agomelatine deserve special attention for treatment of insomnia and sleep disturbances associated with depressive disorders and have promising role for treatment of sleep disorders."
