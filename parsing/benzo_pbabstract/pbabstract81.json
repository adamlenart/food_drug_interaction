Previous pharmacological studies have revealed that lurasidone exhibits a preferable profile (potent antipsychotic activity and lower incidence of catalepsy) to other antipsychotic drugs, although the contribution of receptor subtypes to this profile remains unclear.", 
    "1": "To compare target engagements of lurasidone with those of an atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, we performed evaluation of dopamine D(2)/D(3) and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor occupancy in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) with conscious common marmosets.",

Patients were randomized to receive PSNB alone (control group, n = 20) or PSNB in combination with an obturator nerve block (obturator group, n = 20). After evaluation for 30 min, the two groups received a femoral nerve block, and patients were taken to surgery. The obturator nerve blockade was assessed by measurement of adductor strength at baseline (T0) and every 10 min during the 30-min evaluation (T10, T20, and T30). Pain scores after tourniquet inflation and during surgery were compared between the two groups. The requirement for additional intravenous analgesia and/or sedation was also recorded.", 
    "7": "The two groups had comparable demographic and surgical characteristics. Four patients were excluded from the study because of PSNB or femoral nerve block failure. The adductor strength values were similar between groups at T0 but were significantly lower in the obturator group at T10, T20, and T30 (p < 0.0001). Patients in the obturator group reported less pain than those in the control group (p < 0.05). They also required less additional intravenous sedation and/or analgesia (p < 0.05).",

    "10": "The diagnosis and treatment of nocturnal events can present significant challenges to the clinician. Correct diagnosis is the first step towards appropriate treatment, but may not be straightforward. In particular, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) arousal parasomnias, such as sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousal can present in a similar fashion to nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (NFLE); dramatic and often bizarre behaviors from sleep are features of both conditions, and may result in diagnostic confusion. A careful clinical history, however, often enables accurate diagnosis, and the frontal lobe epilepsy and parasomnia (FLEP) scale, a validated questionnaire for the diagnosis of nocturnal events, can add diagnostic confidence. Recording of events on video-EEG-polysomnography is required if diagnostic doubt remains although is not always achievable, particularly if events are occurring infrequently. Treatments for NFLE and parasomnias are different, but lifestyle modification and treatment of coexisting sleep disorders (such as obstructive sleep apnoea) may have a role in both. In NFLE, medical treatment with antiepileptic drugs, particularly carbamazepine and topiramate, forms the mainstay of treatment; a small proportion of individuals with treatment-resistant seizures may benefit from epilepsy surgery. For parasomnias, reassurance and the removal of priming and precipitating factors is often sufficient. A minority of individuals will, however, need medical treatment, usually with benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants. Unfortunately, there are few data on which to base treatment decisions in this area, with the evidence comprising predominantly case reports and case series. Well-designed studies, including randomised control trials, are needed and may require a multicentre approach.",

    "23": "Acetylcholine has been implicated in higher cortical functions such as learning, memory and cognition, yet the cellular effects of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activation are poorly understood in the human cortex. Here we investigated the effect of the mAChR agonist carbachol (CCh) and various mAChR antagonists in human cortical slices (from tissue removed during neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy) by intracellular and extracellular recordings. CCh increased neuronal firing, which was antagonised by atropine (non-selective mAChR antagonist) and pirenzepine (M(1)/M(4) mAChRs antagonist) when applied before or after CCh application. AF-DX 116 (M(2)/M(4) mAChRs antagonist) had no effect on CCh-induced increase of firing. CCh also reduced evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP), and the CCh-induced depression of EPSP was fully reversed by atropine. Pirenzepine reversed the depression of CCh on EPSP, but failed to prevent the depression when applied before CCh. AF-DX 116 prevented the CCh-induced depression of evoked EPSP when applied before CCh. CCh also depressed GABAergic transmission and this effect was antagonised by AF-DX 116. Xanomeline (M(1)/M(4) mAChR agonist) increased neuronal firing and decreased EPSP, but had no effect on GABAergic transmission. Reduction (with linopirdine) and enhancement (with retigabine) of the M-current (mediated by K(V)7 channels), increased and decreased neuronal firing, respectively, but had marginal effects on the evoked EPSP. Our results indicate that three pharmacologically distinct mAChRs modulate neuronal firing, glutamatergic and GABAergic transmissions in the human epileptogenic neocortex. The data are discussed towards possible implications of altered mAChR signalling in hyperexcitability and cognitive functions in the human neocortex.",

    "28": "Benzothiazepine CGP37157 is widely used as tool to explore the role of mitochondria in cell Ca(2+) handling, by its blocking effect of the mitochondria Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger. Recently, CGP37157 has shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties. In the trend to improve its neuroprotection profile, we have synthesized ITH12505, an isosteric analogue having a methyl instead of chlorine at C2' of the phenyl ring. ITH12505 has exerted neuroprotective properties similar to CGP37157 in chromaffin cells and hippocampal slices stressed with veratridine. Also, both compounds afforded neuroprotection in hippocampal slices stressed with glutamate. However, while ITH12505 elicited protection in SH-SY5Y cells stressed with oligomycin A/rotenone, CGP37157 was ineffective. In hippocampal slices subjected to oxygen/glucose deprivation plus reoxygenation, ITH12505 offered protection at 3-30 \u03bcM, while CGP37157 only protected at 30 \u03bcM. Both compounds caused blockade of Ca(2+) channels in high K(+)-depolarized SH-SY5Y cells. An in vitro experiment for assaying central nervous system penetration (PAMPA-BBB; parallel artificial membrane permeability assay for blood-brain barrier) revealed that both compounds could cross the blood-brain barrier, thus reaching their biological targets in the central nervous system. In conclusion, by causing a mild isosteric replacement in the benzothiazepine CGP37157, we have obtained ITH12505, with improved neuroprotective properties. These findings may inspire the design and synthesis of new benzothiazepines targeting mitochondrial Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger and L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels, having antioxidant properties.", 
    "29": "There is evidence that excitotoxicity and prolonged microglial activation are involved in neuronal death in neurodegenerative disorders. Activated microglia express various molecules, including the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO; formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor) on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The TSPO is a novel target for neuroprotective treatments which aim to reduce microglial activation. The effect of PK 11195 and three other TSPO ligands on the level of microglial activation and neuronal survival was evaluated in a quinolinic acid (QUIN) rat model of excitotoxic neurodegeneration. All three ligands were neuroprotective at a level comparable to PK 11195. All of the ligands decreased microglial activation following the injection of QUIN but had no effect on astrogliosis. Interestingly, we also observed neuroprotective effects from the vehicle, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).",

    "31": "The present study discusses the influence of sunlight on the photostability of levomepromazine (LV) and olanzapine (OLA) hydrochlorides in river water. Four samples of water from different rivers were used in the research. In their course, it turned out that levomepromazine easily underwent photooxidation under simulated environmental conditions, resulting in the generation of its sulphoxide. Olanzapine, on the other hand, appeared to be more resistant to sunlight, as its photodecomposition proceeded slowly, and only one product of its decomposition was detected spectrophotometrically during the process. The photodegradation was analyzed in detail using principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) chemometric methods, and the outcomes verified by HPLC and GC-MS analysis. It can be stated that the rates of the observed processes heavily depended on the chemical composition of the fresh water used in the experiments.",

A search of English language publications from 1970 to 2012 was conducted using PubMed and PsycINFO(\u00ae). Our search found approximately 200 articles appropriate for inclusion in this paper. While numerous reports indicate that the co-abuse of opioids and BZDs is ubiquitous around the world, the reasons for the co-abuse of these medications are not entirely clear. Though the possibility remains that opioid abusers are using BZDs therapeutically to self-medicate anxiety, mania or insomnia, the data reviewed in this paper suggest that BZD use is primarily recreational. For example, co-users report seeking BZD prescriptions for the purpose of enhancing opioid intoxication or \"high,\" and use doses that exceed the therapeutic range. Since there are few clinical studies investigating the pharmacological interaction and abuse liability of their combined use, this hypothesis has not been extensively evaluated in clinical settings. As such, our analysis encourages further systematic investigation of BZD abuse among opioid abusers. The co-abuse of BZDs and opioids is substantial and has negative consequences for general health, overdose lethality, and treatment outcome. Physicians should address this important and underappreciated problem with more cautious prescribing practices, and increased vigilance for abusive patterns of use.",

Exploratory survey and register-based analysis of anxiolytic and antidepressant prescriptions of one hundred family physicians in Slovenia was performed in 2005 and 2008. Drugs included in the study were classified according to the Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical (ATC) drug classification system, and ATC data were used to calculate defined daily doses (DDD) per 1,000 practice population per day. The most often prescribed anxiolytics and antidepressants were identified and anxiolytic/antidepressant ratio was estimation by patient age-group for the two studied years. Benzodiazepines showed highest share in the overall utilization of psychotropic drugs. The ratio between short- and long-acting benzodiazepines decreased by about one tenth during the observed period. Long-acting benzodiazepines were prescribed more often to the older patients. The decrease in anxiolytic/antidepressant ratio from 2005 to 2008 was the smallest in the elderly population. Further research is needed to ascertain the prescribers' attitudes in order to devise strategies to further improve prescribing performance in elderly patients.",

Both drugs improved all the efficacy scale scores including the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score. Although sertindole failed to prove noninferiority to olanzapine in terms of reduction in PANSS total score with the last-observation-carried-forward analysis, this can be attributed to the higher withdrawal rate in the sertindole group by day 16 by which sertindole was up-titrated to the effective dose. On excluding early withdrawals, the noninferiority criterion was fulfilled, as also in the observed-case analysis. They had similar safety profiles with respect to the total incidence of adverse events. The incidence of asymptomatic QT prolongation was higher in the sertindole group.

Healthy male subjects received either single (10-1000 mg) or multiple doses (30-600 mg) administered once daily for 14 days of ACT-178882, placebo, or 20 mg enalapril in the fasted state. Following a 2-week washout, the single dose of 30 mg ACT-178882 was also administered in the fed state. In the multiple-ascending-dose part, subjects were dosed with midazolam on days -2, 2, and 12 to investigate interactions with CYP3A4. Dizziness and headache were the most frequently reported adverse events. No clinically relevant changes occurred for body weight, vital signs, clinical laboratory variables, and ECG although both enalapril and ACT-178882 tended to decrease systolic blood pressure. Following single doses of ACT-178882, t1/2 and tmax varied from 18.7 to 24.7 h and from 3 to 5 h, respectively, and food had no significant effect. Steady-state conditions were achieved after 4-6 days of dosing and accumulation was minimal. ACT-178882 pharmacokinetics were dose proportional. ACT-178882 but not enalapril dose-dependently increased Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve of midazolam. Single and multiple doses of ACT-178882 dose-dependently increased active renin and decreased plasma renin activity, whereas enalapril increased both variables. No effects on urinary excretion of creatinine, potassium, and the 6\u03b2-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio were observed, whereas sodium and aldosterone excretion was decreased by both ACT-178882 and enalapril. The current results with ACT-178882 warrant further clinical investigation of this renin inhibitor in hypertensive patients.",

Modulation of different receptor isoforms probably results in selective behavioural effects as sedation and anxiolysis. Knowledge of differences in the structure of the binding pocket in different receptor isoforms is of interest for the generation of isoform-specific ligands. We studied here the interaction of the covalently reacting diazepam analogue 3-NCS with \u03b1(1)S204C\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2), \u03b1(1)S205C\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) and \u03b1(1)T206C\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) and with receptors containing the homologous mutations in \u03b1(2)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2), \u03b1(3)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2), \u03b1(5)\u03b2(1/2)\u03b3(2) and \u03b1(6)\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2). The interaction was studied using radioactive ligand binding and at the functional level using electrophysiological techniques. Both strategies gave overlapping results. Our data allow conclusions about the relative apposition of \u03b1(1)S204C\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2), \u03b1(1)S205C\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) and \u03b1(1)T206C\u03b2(2)\u03b3(2) and homologous positions in \u03b1(2), \u03b1(3), \u03b1(5) and \u03b1(6) with C-atom adjacent to the keto-group in diazepam.

    "61": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8), a gut-brain peptide, regulates a variety of physiological behavioral processes. Previously, we reported that exogenous CCK-8 attenuated morphine-induced conditioned place preference, but the possible effects of CCK-8 on aversively motivated drug seeking remained unclear. To investigate the effects of endogenous and exogenous CCK on negative components of morphine withdrawal, we evaluated the effects of CCK receptor antagonists and CCK-8 on the naloxone-precipitated withdrawal-induced conditioned place aversion (CPA). The results showed that CCK2 receptor antagonist (LY-288,513, 10 \u00b5g, i.c.v.), but not CCK1 receptor antagonist (L-364,718, 10 \u00b5g, i.c.v.), inhibited the acquisition of CPA when given prior to naloxone (0.3 mg/kg) administration in morphine-dependent rats. Similarly, CCK-8 (0.1-1 \u00b5g, i.c.v.) significantly attenuated naloxone-precipitated withdrawal-induced CPA, and this inhibitory function was blocked by co-injection with L-364,718. Microinjection of L-364,718, LY-288,513 or CCK-8 to saline pretreated rats produced neither a conditioned preference nor aversion, and the induction of CPA by CCK-8 itself after morphine pretreatments was not significant. Our study identifies a different role of CCK1 and CCK2 receptors in negative affective components of morphine abstinence and an inhibitory effect of exogenous CCK-8 on naloxone-precipitated withdrawal-induced CPA via CCK1 receptor.",

    "63": "Pharmacological treatments of insomnia have become safer since the first benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BzRA) hypnotic was introduced in the 1960's. Though BzRAs could hardly cause a fatal condition even in cases of overdosing, they had inherited the arguments on addiction and withdrawal from the prior studies of barbiturate hypnotics that indicated they are strongly addictive. In the 2000s, it was repeatedly demonstrated that insomnia as well as sleep deprivation underlie the development and deterioration of comorbid diseases such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and depression, and that the proper use of hypnotic drugs is unlikely to cause tolerance, addiction nor rebound phenomena, but likely to be associated with improvement of QOL. Thus, the 2005's consensus report on chronic insomnia by NIH has recommended general physicians to facilitate insomnia treatment to prevent the development of physical and/or mental disorders. The author reviewed in this article the efficacy and side effects of BzRA hypnotics, a hypnotic drug therapy combined with cognitive and behavioral interventions, uses of melatonin receptor agonist in general and sleep medicine practices, and future utilization of newly-developed orexin antagonists for insomnia treatment.",

Its complexation with modified cyclodextrins (CDs) is designed to achieve novel vectorization systems with higher solubility, consequently higher bioavailability. From the CD selection, among \u03b2-CD, methyl-\u03b2-CD (M\u03b2CD) and hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-CD, it was obtained a phase solubility diagram suggesting a 1:1 (mol:mol) OLP-CD stoichiometry and complexation constants of 966.9, 149.4 and 91.1 L/mol, respectively. The M\u03b2CD was selected for the inclusion complexes (IC) attainment, a physical mixture (PM) and a rotatory evaporator product (ROE). The analysis showed differences in the structure, morphology and performance of OLP, M\u03b2CD, PM and ROE, revealing the occurrence of interactions between drug and CD. The ROE presented the higher dissolution efficiency and stability. The results suggest that the IC was formation, being a technological resource efficient and profitable for drug delivery.",

Post-resuscitation, the patient was in coma with intact brainstem function. Toxicology was positive for cocaine and marijuana. Eyelid myoclonus suggested NCSE, which was initially treated with lorazepam and fosphenytoin. EEG monitoring showed sustained TSWA confirming NCSE and demonstrating de novo ASE (the patient and his family never had seizure/epilepsy). The TSWA was resistant to lorazepam, levetiracetam, and low-dose midazolam; it was eliminated only with midazolam at a dose that resulted in burst-suppression (\u22651.2 mg/kg/hour).",

The TSWA was relatively resistant to benzodiazepines suggesting that cerebral hypoxia-ischemia spared the thalamocortical apparatus generating TSWA but impaired the cortical/thalamic inhibitory circuits where benzodiazepines act to suppress TSWA. Albeit rare, 'post-hypoxic' TSWA offers us some valuable insights for classifying and managing nonconvulsive status epilepticus.",

    "71": "In order to quantify small molecules at the early stage of drug discovery, we developed a quantitation approach based on mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) without the use of a labeled compound. We describe a method intended to respond to the main challenges encountered in quantification through MALDI imaging dedicated to whole-body or single heterogeneous organ samples (brain, eye, liver). These include the high dependence of the detected signal on the matrix deposition, the MALDI ionization yield of specific target molecules, and lastly, the ion suppression effect on the tissue. To address these challenges, we based our approach on the use of a normalization factor called the TEC (Tissue Extinction Coefficient). This factor takes into account the ion suppression effect that is both tissue- and drug-specific. Through this protocol, the amount of drug per gram of tissue was determined, which in turn, was compared with other analytical techniques such as Liquid Chromatography-Mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).",

Robotic on-line solid phase extraction (SPE) instrumentation was used to elute the eight analytes of interest from polymeric SPE cartridges to which had been added aliquots (150 \u03bcL) of human plasma and aliquots (150 \u03bcL) of a mixture of two internal standards, viz. morphine-d3 (200 ng/mL) and 1'-hydroxymidazolam-d5 (50 ng/mL) in 50 mM ammonium acetate buffer (pH 9.25). Cartridges were washed using 10% methanol in ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.25 (1 mL, 2 mL/min) before elution with mobile phase comprising 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile (B) with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min using an 11.5 min run time. The analytes were separated on a C18 X-Terra\u00ae analytical column. The linear concentration ranges were 0.5-100 ng/mL for fentanyl, norfentanyl and midazolam; 1-200 ng/mL for 4-hydroxymidazolam, 2.5-500 ng/mL for 1'-hydroxymidazolam and 3.5-700 ng/mL for morphine, M3G, and M6G. The method showed acceptable within-run and between-run precision (relative standard deviation (RSD) and accuracy <20%) for quality control (QC) samples spiked at concentrations of 80% and 50% of the ULOQ, 3 times higher than the LLOQ, and also at the LLOQ. Furthermore, analytes were stable in samples (after mixing with internal standard) for at least 48 h in the autosampler (except for 4-hydroxymidazolam which decreased by 22% after 24 h), 5 h at room temperature and after three cycles of freeze and thaw. No autosampler carry-over was observed and the absolute recovery (the area ratio of analyte in plasma relative to that in ammonium acetate buffer 50 mM, pH 9.25) was in the range 40% (midazolam) to 110% (morphine).

    "82": "The mechanism underlying the weight gain due to treatment with olanzapine and other second generation antipsychotics has not been fully understood. To examine olanzapine's weight gain effects, we accepted first attack psychotic patients with no medication (pre-treatment) (n=22) and the healthy control group (n=26) in this study. After patients\u0301 diagnosis, they were hospitalized and then treated for four weeks with olanzapine (post-treatment). We used case-control association design to test body mass index (BMI) and biochemical changes in each group. We also investigated peripheral leptin and neuropeptides/hormones namely, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), cocaine and amphetaime regulated transcript (CART), and neuropeptide Y (NPY) levels. These neuropeptides which are synthesized/secreted from arcuate nucleus of hypothalamus affect food intake and therefore, body weight. After 4 weeks of olanzapine treatment; BMI (body mass index), waist circumference, blood triglyceride, total cholesterol, and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were increased significantly in patients compared to their pre-treatment baseline. In pre-treatment, patients' NPY levels were significantly lower while \u03b1-MSH, the anorexigenic product of POMC levels were significantly higher vs. control. Both leptin and NPY levels were significantly increased in patients after the treatment but the NPY levels were also significantly lower in post-treatment vs. the control group. The CART levels did not change after the treatment. We may presume that the antagonist effect of olanzapine on the serotonin (5HT2CR and 5HT1BR) receptors of the arcuate hypothalamic neurons may be a basis for a deregulation of the neurohormones secretion.",

Duplex thermal stabilizations upon drug binding as measured by UV melting experiments suggest that two guanine bases separated by four AT base pairs constitute the favorable binding site for the PBD dimer. Large stabilizations were observed for the self-complementary duplex d(AACAATTGTT)(2) as well as for the non-self-complementary duplex d(AAGAATTGTT)\u00b7d(AACAATTCTT) with both guanines located on the same strand. Formation of interstrand and intrastrand crosslinks by the covalent binding of both PBD moieties of the dimer to the exocyclic 2-amino group of the two guanine bases within the duplex minor groove was confirmed by NMR structural studies. In both the symmetric and non-symmetric DNA-PBD adducts the newly created stereogenic center at C11 of the tricyclic PBD subunits favors an S configuration. Different orientations of the PBD aromatic A-ring with respect to the covalently modified guanine as observed in the non-symmetric complex are shown to result in characteristic changes of PBD H11 and H11a proton chemical shifts. Based on a compilation of available NMR data on various PBD complexes, these differences may be used as valuable probes for the identification of PBD orientational preferences in DNA-PBD adducts.",

    "90": "Leptomeningeal metastasis is a serious and frequently fatal complication of non-small cell lung cancer. Curative treatment remains elusive, but careful use of radiation, systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy, and symptoms management can greatly improve quality of life and survival. For most patients, we recommend a combination of skull-based radiation with focal radiation to any symptomatic spinal segments followed by systemic chemotherapy. For patients with EGFR mutations, erlotinib may be used as first-line therapy in a daily or high-dose regimen. Pemetrexed has promise for use in patients with brain and leptomeningeal metastases. Patients with multiple comorbidities or low performance status may tolerate intrathecal therapy better than systemic chemotherapy. The most commonly used intrathecal chemotherapies are methotrexate and liposomal cytarabine, although newer agents, such as topotecan and mafosfamide, may be more effective. Elevated intracranial pressure, which causes headaches, vertigo, nausea, and vomiting, should be treated with dexamethasone and acetazolamide. In select patients, cerebrospinal fluid shunting may be considered. The use of antidepressants, central nervous system stimulants, benzodiazepines, antiemetics, and pain medications can increase quality of life in patients with leptomeningeal metastases.",

An adequate estimation of the availability of post-disaster psychosocial services across Europe is needed in order to compare them with recently developed evidence-informed psychosocial care guidelines. Here we report on the results of a cross-sectional web-based survey completed in 2008 by two hundred and eighty-six representatives of organizations involved in psychosocial responses to trauma and disaster from thirty-three different countries across Europe. The survey addressed planning and delivery of psychosocial care after disaster, methods of screening and diagnosis, types of interventions used, and other aspects of psychosocial care after trauma. The findings showed that planning and delivery of psychosocial care was inconsistent across Europe. Countries in East Europe seemed to have less central coordination of the post-disaster psychosocial response and fewer post-disaster guidelines that were integrated into specific disaster or contingency plans. Several forms of psychological debriefing, for which there is no evidence of efficacy to date, were still used in several areas particularly in North Europe. East European countries delivered evidence-based interventions for PTSD less frequently, whilst in South- and South-Eastern European countries anxiety suppressing medication such as benzodiazepines were prescribed more frequently to disaster victims than in other areas. Countries across Europe are currently providing sub-optimal psychosocial care for disaster victims. This short report shows that there is an urgent need for some countries to abandon non-effective interventions and others to develop more evidence based and effective services to facilitate the care of those involved in future disasters.",

After liquid-liquid extraction, an Acquity UPLC with a TQ Detector and BEH C18 column was used (Waters, Milford, MA). The injection-to-injection run time was 7.5 min. Forty-eight authentic serum and plasma patient specimens were analyzed and results compared to those obtained using a previously published method. Average r(2) values for linearity (1 to 1,000 ng/mL over five days) were all above 0.995, except \u03b1-hydroxytriazolam (0.993). Intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviation values were within \u00b1 15% and the percent deviation from the expected concentrations were within \u00b1 11%. Recovery ranged from 62 to 89%. Matrix effects ranged from -28% to +6%. The limits of detection were 1 ng/mL, except for lorazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam (5 ng/mL). Ion ratios were \u00b1 15% for all analytes. For authentic patient specimens (n = 48, 76 positive results), there was excellent correlation between the UPLC-MS-MS results and the previous method. The best least-squares fit had an equation of y = 1.0708x + 1.6521, r(2) = 0.9822.

    "94": "This manuscript reports, for the first time, a monitoring study analysing wastewater and associated suspended particulate matter (SPM) to determine the concentration of drugs of abuse and metabolites in wastewater influent. The monitoring of SPM is crucial for target analytes because, depending on their physico-chemical properties, they may partition to particulates; thus, analysis of wastewater only will result in under-reporting of the concentration of target analytes in the sample. A daily one week monitoring study was carried out at a WWTP serving one of the largest cities in the Czech Republic; representing the first comprehensive application of the sewage epidemiology approach in the Czech Republic. In total, 60 analytes were targeted in the monitoring programme including stimulants, opioid and morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, dissociative anaesthetics, drug precursors and their metabolites. Analysis of SPM determined that significant proportions of some compounds were present on the solids. For example, 21.0-49.8% of the total concentration of EDDP (2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine) in the sample was determined on SPM and 11.2-19.6% of methadone. The highest proportion on SPM was determined for fluoxetine in the range 68.1-79.6%, norfluoxetine 46.6-61.9% and amitriptyline 21.8-51.2%. In contrast, some compounds presented very little partitioning to SPM. Less than 5% was determined partitioned to SPM over the week period for analytes including cocaine, benzoylecgonine, cocaethylene, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol, nortramadol, oxazepam and ephedrine. Determined concentrations in wastewater influent were subsequently utilised in the sewage epidemiology approach to estimate drug consumption, in the community from which the wastewater was derived. This back-calculation was updated for the first time to include the concentration of analytes present on SPM. The consumption of methamphetamine and MDMA was determined to be especially high in the studied community in relation to other European countries, while cocaine and methadone consumption was relatively low. This manuscript shows that in order to apply the sewage epidemiology approach, SPM analysis is required for some compounds; whereas for others the partitioning is small and one may regard this as negligible.", 
    "95": "Cessation of one-week oral administration of the benzodiazepine flurazepam (FZP) to rats results in withdrawal anxiety after 1 day of withdrawal. FZP withdrawal is correlated with synaptic incorporation of homomeric GluA1-containing \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) in the proximal stratum radiatum of CA1 neurons. After 2 days of withdrawal, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylates GluA1 subunits at Ser(831), increasing channel conductance. Secondary to AMPAR potentiation, GluN2B-containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), known binding partners of CaMKII, are selectively removed from the postsynaptic density (PSD). While activation of synaptic CaMKII is known to involve translocation to the PSD, CaMKII bound to NMDARs may be removed from the PSD. To distinguish these possibilities, the current studies used postembedding immunogold electron microscopy to investigate alterations in CaMKII signaling at CA1 stratum radiatum synapses after 2 days of FZP withdrawal. These studies revealed decreased total, but not autophosphorylated (Thr(286)) CaMKII\u03b1 expression in CA1 PSDs. The removal of CaMKII-GluN2B complexes from the PSD during drug withdrawal may serve as a homeostatic mechanism to limit AMPAR-mediated CA1 neuron hyperexcitability and benzodiazepine withdrawal anxiety.",

Data are currently available on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants, but there is very little documentation on the bioaccumulation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). The bioconcentration of selected PPCPs was studied in marine mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis). The selected PPCPs were two organic UV filters, i.e., 2-ethylhexyl-4-trimethoxycinnamate (EHMC) and octocrylene (OC), and two benzodiazepines (BZP), i.e., diazepam (DZP) and tetrazepam (TZP). Laboratory experiments were performed in which M. galloprovincialis was exposed to these compounds either directly from water, for the less lipophilic substances (BZP) or via spiked food for lipophilic UV filters. M. galloprovincialis uptook and eliminated BZP following first-order kinetics.

    "109": "Benzodiazepines are frequently prescribed for a longer period of time for anxiety disorders and insomnia in spite of the many guidelines to prescribe these drugs only short-term. These guidelines are based on the risk-benefit balance between long-term effectiveness and side effects like addiction, anterograde amnesia, and increased risk on falling (resulting in hip fractures), traffic accidents and even mortality. Also low-dose benzodiazepine use can lead to benzodiazepine dependence. Although initially most attention has been paid to the physical withdrawal syndrome, psychological aspects of benzodiazepine dependence have received more and more attention in the past decades. Recently, a relationship between the brain-reward system, involved in addiction, and benzodiazepine use, was demonstrated. When long-term benzodiazepine use is recognised as problematic by both physician and patient, different treatment modalities are available to support patients in achieving abstinence. One of every four patients is able to stop by themselves with the aid of a minimal intervention providing psychoeducation and encouragement. Two out of three long-term uses are able to stop their usage with the aid of systematic tapering protocols guided by a physician or psychologist. In case of an underlying insomnia or anxiety disorder, cognitive-behavioural therapy should be added to the tapering protocol. In contrast to the general opinion, advanced old age has no negative impact on the treatment response.",

This labilization phase is followed by a process of stabilization called reconsolidation. The phenomenon has been shown in diverse types of memory, and different pharmacological agents have been used to disclose its presence. Several studies have revealed the relevance of the GABAergic system to this process. Consequently, our hypothesis is that the system is involved in the reconsolidation of declarative memory in humans. Thus, using our verbal learning task, we analyzed the effect of benzodiazepines on the re-stabilization of the declarative memory. On Day 1, volunteers learned an association between five cue- response-syllables. On Day 2, the verbal memory was labilized by a reminder presentation, and then a placebo capsule or 0.25 mg or 0.03 mg of clonazepam was administered to the subjects. The verbal memory was evaluated on Day 3. The volunteers who had received the 0.25 mg clonazepam along with the specific reminder on Day 2, exhibited memory improvement. In contrast, there was no effect when the drug was given without retrieval, when the memory was simply retrieved instead of being reactivated or when short-term memory testing was performed 4 h after reactivation. We discuss the GABAergic role in reconsolidation, which shows a collateral effect on other memories when the treatment is aimed at treating anxiety disorders. Further studies might elucidate the role of GABA in the reconsolidation process associated with dissimilar scenarios. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.",

Screening analysis in urine was performed by immunoassay, and confirmation analysis by LC-MS/MS. 7-AC was detected for 9 days, and the concentration at day 9 was still high (97 ng/ml), compared to previously reported data. These results indicate that after repeated ingestions of clonazepam, 7-AC can possibly be detected for about 2-3 weeks after cessation, applying cut-off levels commonly used in drug testing programs and DFSA cases.",

Voxel-based (VB) analysis and volume-of-interest (VOI) analysis with predefined VOIs were applied to compare IMZ binding between the hemispheres ipsilateral and contralateral to the epileptic focus. VB analysis showed significant decreases in iomazenil binding not only in the ipsilateral anterior temporal lobe including the mesial temporal structures but also in the ipsilateral extratemporal region including the insula, putamen, and medial occipital lobe. VOI analysis showed similar significant decreases in the ipsilateral parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, putamen, lateral temporal lobe, and lateral occipital lobe.

Our older data demonstrated that single injection of Ro 19-2088 to immature rats induces increased sensitivity to convulsant action of pentylenetetrazol as a withdrawal phenomenon. To know if repeated administration of the partial agonist has the same effect we injected rats at postnatal days 7 to 11 with an anticonvulsant dose of Ro 19-8022 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.) and tested them 24 h, 48 h and 4 days after the last injection. Repeated administration of Ro 19-8022 resulted also in an increased sensitivity to convulsant action of pentylenetetrazol in immature rats (higher incidence and severity of seizures). This effect was significant 24 h after the last injection but only outlined 48 h after administration. No signs of hypersensitivity were seen at 4-day interval. There is a difference between immature and adult brain in an appearance of withdrawal symptom after administration of the partial agonist of benzodiazepine receptors Ro 19-8022.",

In this work, ORX-A and the two \u03b1 GABA(A)R agonists (zolpidem, ZOL; diazepam, DZP) accounted for very great (p<0.001) increases of feeding while only DZP elicited great (p<0.01) levels of food intake in the goldfish (Carassius auratus). It was, however, T-maze and conditioned place preference (CPP) methods that allowed us to specifically establish learning/reward-related events operating in an ORX-A+GABA(A)R-dependent fashion in our experimental model. T-maze data showed that conditioned ORX-A treated-fish were capable of reaching the red/blue chamber and ingesting their food reward in a very greatly reduced latency time with respect to untreated conditioned fish while DZP and ZOL greatly and moderately (p<0.05) reduced their latency time, respectively. Regarding CPP study, conditioned ORX-A- and DZP-treated animals showed comparably greater preferences for the conditioned compartment that became even greater in ORX-A+DZP-treated fish. Surprisingly, ORX receptor expression of the telencephalon was preferentially activated by ORX-A treatments while diencephalic/mesencephalic structures and namely the tuberculum posterioris (TPp) were more sensitive to DZP especially following treatment with ORX-A+DZP. Overall, behavioral performances along with ORX receptor transcriptional properties tend to point to \u03b1 GABA(A)R agonists as enhancers of palatability while the ORXergic system constitutes a crucial link between satiety-related and cognitive centers through the activation of TPp thus proposing this ascending dopaminergic system as a key target of learning/reward processes in fish.",

Carbamazepine and phenytoin shortened the tonic-like and clonic-like subdivisions at similar proportions, whereas phenobarbital, diazepam, and valproic acid preferentially shortened the clonic-like subdivision. Diazepam at low concentrations increased the duration of tonic-like subdivisions, an effect not seen with the other AEDs.

Valproic acid was less effective in OHSCs than in the kindled seizure tests, and diazepam was more (generalized seizures) or less (focal seizures and afterdischarge durations) effective in this animal model than in OHSCs.

    "175": "Far more people complain of inadequate sleep than of true insomnia warranting prescription of a hypnotic drug. The number of available hypnotics has fallen markedly in recent years. Numerous brain areas, transmitters and receptors are involved in sleep. Currently, the main hypnotics (benzodiazepine derivatives and the so-called 4Z group. Zolpidem, Zopiclone, EsZopiclone and Zaleplon) increase GABAergic transmission by acting on components of chloride channels, thereby inducing Cl entry to neurons and resulting in their hyperpolarisation. This pre-eminence of GABAergic transmission should not make us ignore other important transmitters and their receptors as potential targets for new hypnotic drugs; these include histamine (and H1 receptors), dopamine (D1 and D2), norepinephrine (alpha1), serotonin (5HT2), glutamate (NMDA), acetylcholine (nicotinic), hypocretin (OX1 and OX2), melatonin (MLT1 and MLT2), prostaglandin E2 (EP), prostaglandin D2 (DP1), and endocannabinoids (CB1).

    "177": "Approximately 150,000 cases of generalized convulsive SE occur in the United States each year. Clinically apparent seizures complicate about 8% of intensive care unit admissions, and another 10% of ICU patients suffer electrographic seizures in the course of another critical illness. Some of these cases result from previously under-recognized epileptogenic effects of commonly used drugs, such as cefepime. Continuous EEG (cEEG) recording is necessary for both diagnosis and management in these patients, especially since anticonvulsant drugs may abolish motor activity without stopping seizures. Recent studies have underscored the utility of benzodiazepines as the first-line agents for SE termination. The recently published Rapid Anticonvulsant Medication Prior to Arrival Trial (RAMPART) demonstrates that the more rapidly treatment is administered, the more effective it will be. When SE fails to respond to usual doses of benzodiazepines, it should be considered refractory to conventional anticonvulsants, and a general anesthetic approach is likely to be necessary.", 
    "178": "While definitions have varied, patients should be managed for SE after 5 minutes of seizure activity. Management of a patient with SE involves three phases: termination of SE, prevention of recurrence, and treatment of complications. The typical anticonvulsants have limited ability to terminate SE; lorazepam is the most useful, controlling SE in 65% of patients experiencing generalized convulsive SE. If the first conventional anticonvulsant fails, others are unlikely to be useful, and one of the newer anticonvulsants or a general anesthetic agent should be considered. EEG is crucial in the diagnosis and classification of potential seizures. cEEG monitoring helps to guide anticonvulsant therapy in patients with SE and those with frequent seizures. In addition, cEEG has the potential for presymptomatic diagnosis of delayed neurologic deterioration in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and for the differential diagnosis of stroke subtypes, especially when cEEG is subjected to signal processing.",

    "215": "This cross-sectional study aimed to compare the effects of treatment with an atypical antipsychotic drug (olanzapine or risperidone) on quality of life (QoL) and to document adverse effects in 115 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia who attended the ambulatory service of Hospital Dr. Jo\u00e3o Machado, Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Socioeconomic, sociodemographic, and clinical variables were compared. The QoL Scale validated for Brazil (QLS-BR) was used to evaluate QoL, and adverse effects were assessed using the Udvalg for Kliniske Unders\u00f8gelser Side Effect Rating Scale. Data were analyzed using the \u03c7(2) test and Student's t test, with a significance level of 5 %. Patients in both drug groups showed severe impairment in the occupational domain of the QLS-BR. Global QLS-BR scores indicated impairment among risperidone users and severe impairment among olanzapine users. The most significant side effects were associated with risperidone, including asthenia/lassitude/fatigue, somnolence/sedation, paresthesia, change in visual accommodation, increased salivation, diarrhea, orthostatic posture, palpitations/tachycardia, erythema, photosensitivity, weight loss, galactorrhea, decreased sexual desire, erectile/orgasmic dysfunction, vaginal dryness, headache, and physical dependence. QoL was impaired in patients using olanzapine and in those using risperidone. Risperidone use was associated with psychic, neurological, and autonomous adverse effects and other side effects.",

However, alterations to neurotransmitters, especially acetylcholine and dopamine, inflammatory pathways and an aberrant stress response are proposed mechanisms leading to intensive care unit (ICU) delirium. Detection of delirium using a validated delirium assessment tool makes early treatment possible, which may improve prognosis. Patients at high risk of delirium, especially those with cognitive decline and advanced age, should be identified in the first 24 hours of admission to the ICU. Whether these high-risk patients benefit from haloperidol prophylaxis deserves further study. The effectiveness of a multicomponent, non-pharmacological approach is shown in non-ICU patients, which provides proof of concept for use in the ICU. The few studies on this approach in ICU patients suggest that the burden of ICU delirium may be reduced by early mobility, increased daylight exposure and the use of earplugs. In addition, the combined use of sedation, ventilation, delirium and physical therapy protocols can reduce the frequency and severity of adverse outcomes and should become part of routine practice in the ICU, as should avoidance of deliriogenic medication such as anticholinergic drugs and benzodiazepines. Once delirium develops, symptomatic treatment with antipsychotics is recommended, with haloperidol being the drug of first choice. However, there is limited evidence on the safety and effectiveness of antipsychotics in ICU delirium.", 
    "217": "A citrus breeding program aimed at developing low furanocoumarin (FC) grapefruit cultivars provided 40 grapefruit juice (GFJ) samples containing variable concentrations of FC derivatives, established as being mechanism-based (irreversible) inhibitors of human CYP3A isoforms. The principal inhibitory FCs were identified as 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, along with a series of dimeric compounds (spiroesters) having high inhibitory potency. A random subset of the GFJ samples (n = 25) were tested as CYP3A inhibitors using an in vitro model based on human liver microsomal metabolism of the index substrate triazolam. The reciprocal values of in vitro 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) were highly correlated with concentrations of inhibitory FCs in the GFJ samples (r(2) = 0.96). However the correlations were driven mainly by a few samples having high FC content and high reciprocal IC(50) (corresponding to low IC(50)). Among the rest of the samples, the relationship was less robust. Further study is needed to determine how low the FC content needs to be (or how high the IC(50) needs to be) to assure minimal risk of clinical interactions involving GFJ and CYP3A substrate drugs.", 
    "218": "The experiments employing high-frequency ultrasonic technique and selective blockers of M1, M3, and M4 muscarinic cholinergic receptors pirenzepine, 4-DAMP, and tropicamide, respectively, revealed individual roles of these receptors in the development of severe posthemorrhagic hypotension in rats with low or high individual resistance to circulatory hypoxia. The study showed that M1 and M4 muscarinic receptors are involved in shock-limiting and shock-activating processes, respectively, while M3 receptors exert no effect on the course of posthemorrhagic abnormalities in systemic and hepatic portal circulation and on the posthemorrhagic lifespan. Poor resistance of the cardiovascular system to circulatory hypoxia during shock development is considered to be dysregulatory pathology.", 
    "219": "Sixty-seven drugs and metabolites were detected in serum or plasma using a fast (7.5 min) liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF-MS) method. This method was developed as a blood drug screen, with emphasis on the detection of common drugs of abuse and drugs used to manage chronic pain. Qualitative drug detection may identify a drug exposure, assure patient adherence with prescribed therapy and document abstinence from non-prescribed medications. Compound identification is based on chromatographic retention time, mass, isotope spacing and isotope abundance. Data analysis software (Agilent) generates a compound score based on how well these observed criteria matched theoretical and empirical values. The method was validated using fortified samples and 299 residual patient specimens (920 positive results). All results were confirmed by gas chromatography-MS or LC-tandem MS. The accuracy of positive results (samples meeting all qualitative criteria for retention time, mass and compound score) was >90% for drugs and/or metabolites, except for two benzodiazepines. There were 35 false positive results (seven compounds, 3.8%) that could be distinguished by retention time and/or absence of metabolites. The most frequent was 6-acetylmorphine in the absence of morphine. The LC-TOF-MS targeted screening method presented represents a sensitive and specific technology for drug screening of serum or plasma.", 
    "220": "Awareness of palliative care, including knowledge and skills regarding symptom alleviation via pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, is limited in many settings. Lists have been published of recommended drugs for palliative care that include medications for different disease stages, using different modes of administration.", 
    "221": "Recent studies confirm that many of the most common symptoms in dying patients, for example pain, dyspnoea, anxiety, nausea, and delirium, are similar regardless of diagnosis. The classes of drugs most commonly recommended for alleviation of these symptoms are opioids, neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, and antimuscarinic drugs. Other recommendations have the character of emergency kits of standard drugs for common symptoms, to be used when needed in caring for dying patients at home or in hospitals.", 
    "222": "Recommendations for the most appropriate drugs which should be available for the care of dying patients in all settings is suggested to have potential to improve quality of care through increasing the confidence of physicians and nurses, being costeffective, decreasing the need for hospital admissions, and most of all - reducing suffering. Education and training at all levels, as well as further policy work through expert recommendations, care pathways, and media attention, are needed.", 
    "223": "The relationship between pediatric anxiety disorders and physical health is not well-understood, but appreciation of the importance of this relationship is growing. Significant functional impairment may accompany a chronic physical health condition such as asthma, diabetes, or epilepsy, and anxiety may complicate the course. In addition, physical disease can present with symptoms of anxiety, and anxiety disorders may present or be associated with physical symptoms such as functional abdominal pain, headache, and fatigue. This article describes anxiety and its association with physical disease, outlines assessment, and presents a treatment overview including psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.", 
    "224": "Over the last decade, psychopharmacologic treatments for pediatric anxiety disorders have been developed and increasingly subjected to randomized, controlled trials. The authors summarize the data concerning the use of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), atypical anxiolytics, and benzodiazepines. The extant data suggest that SSRIs--both as monotherapy and when combined with psychotherapy--are effective in the treatment of pediatric anxiety disorders. In addition, some TCAs and SNRIs are effective. However, randomized controlled trials do not suggest efficacy for benzodiazepines or the atypical anxiolytic, buspirone, for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders."
