The Swedish legislation on compulsory healthcare can be applied to persons with severe substance abuse who can be treated involuntarily during a period of six months. This context enables a reliable clinical assessment of ADHD in individuals with severe substance use disorder (SUD).", 
    "1": "In the context of compulsory care for individuals with severe SUD, male patients were assessed for ADHD, co-morbid psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial background, treatment history, and cognition. The data from the ADHD/SUD group (n\u2009=\u200960) was compared with data from (1) a group of individuals with severe substance abuse without known ADHD (SUD group, n\u2009=\u2009120), as well as (2) a group with ADHD from an outpatient psychiatric clinic (ADHD/Psych group, n\u2009=\u2009107).", 
    "2": "Compared to the general SUD group in compulsory care, the ADHD/SUD group had already been significantly more often in compulsory care during childhood or adolescence, as well as imprisoned more often as adults. The most common preferred abused substance in the ADHD/SUD group was stimulant drugs, while alcohol and benzodiazepine abuse was more usual in the general SUD group. Compared to the ADHD/Psych group, the ADHD/SUD group reported more ADHD symptoms during childhood and performed poorer on all tests of general intellectual ability and executive functions.", 
    "3": "The clinical characteristics of the ADHD/SUD group differed from those of both the SUD group and the ADHD/Psych group in several respects, indicating that ADHD in combination with SUD is a particularly disabling condition. The combination of severe substance abuse, poor general cognitive ability, severe psychosocial problems, including indications of antisocial behaviour, and other co-existing psychiatric conditions should be considered in treatment planning for adults with ADHD and SUD.",

Pharmacokinetic drug interactions between voclosporin and a CYP3A inhibitor, inducer and substrate and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor and substrate were evaluated.", 
    "5": "Voclosporin 0.4 mg kg(-1) was administered to 24 subjects in each of five studies, as follows: every 12 h (Q12H) alone and concomitantly with ketoconazole 400 mg once daily (QD); single dose before and single dose after rifampin 600 mg QD; Q12H where midazolam 7.5 mg was administered as a single dose alone before voclosporin and with last the dose of voclosporin; Q12H alone and concomitantly with verapamil 80 mg every 8 h; and Q12H with digoxin 0.25 mg QD. The noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters maximal concentration (Cmax ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were obtained, and geometric least squares mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals were evaluated.", 
    "6": "Ketoconazole increased voclosporin Cmax (6.4-fold) and AUC (18-fold); rifampin reduced voclosporin AUC (0.9-fold); voclosporin did not change exposure of midazolam or \u03b1-hydroxy-midazolam; verapamil increased voclosporin Cmax (2.1-fold) and AUC (2.7-fold); and voclosporin increased digoxin Cmax (0.5-fold), AUC (0.25-fold) and urinary excretion (0.2-fold).", 
    "7": "Administration of voclosporin concomitantly with strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A resulted in increased and decreased exposures, respectively, and should be considered contraindicated. Drug-drug interactions involving voclosporin and CYP3A substrates are not expected. Administration of voclosporin concomitantly with inhibitors and substrates of P-glycoprotein resulted in increased voclosporin and substrate exposures, respectively. Appropriate concentration and safety monitoring is recommended with co-administration of voclosporin and P-glycoprotein substrates and inhibitors.", 
    "8": "Triacontanol was confirmed to have a potential anti-cancer effect, the aim was to assess whether the co-administration of triacontanol alters the exposure of docetaxel via inducing hepatic CYP3A1/2 activity. The concentration of docetaxel in rats pretreated with triacontanol for seven successive days was determined, and the expression levels of CYP3A protein and mRNA were analyzed by the western blot and real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique, respectively. 2.\u2002 The concentrations of docetaxel in rats pretreated with triacontanol were decreased, with 61.5%, 61.9% decrease in AUC0-24h and 65.7%, 54.9% reduction in Cmax (120 and 180\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1), respectively) compared with the control. Hepatic clearance of docetaxel was enhanced in vitro and in vivo at dosage of 120 and 180\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1), and CYP3A activity was up-regulated by measuring the formation rate of 1-hydroxymidazolam. Triacontanol preferentially induced protein expression level of CYP3A2 in a dose-dependent manner and of CYP 3A1 at dosage of 120 and 180\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1). The mRNA expression of CYP3A1 was moderately different with the western blot results, but the trends appeared similar. CYP3A2 mRNA level was not markedly affected by triacontanol. 3.\u2002 The significant triacontanol-docetaxel interaction was largely due to the induction of CYP3A1/2, which brought useful information in the clinical therapy when the combination is administered in human.",

To our knowledge, the literature contains only two documented cases of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy arising following a suicide attempt, neither of which involved pharmaceutical poisoning. Here, however, we document the case of a young male patient with borderline personality disorder and a clinical and angiographic presentation compatible with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy arising following a suicide attempt by voluntary drug intoxication (risperidone, barbiturates, and benzodiazepine). The potential pathophysiological mechanisms behind this unusual clinical picture are discussed.", 
    "10": "The concentrations of cocaine and its major metabolite benzoylecgonine (BZE) were determined in femoral blood from 132 cocaine-related deaths and compared with venous blood from 988 apprehended drivers. Cocaine and BZE were determined by solid-phase extraction and isotope dilution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry with limits of quantitation of 0.02 mg/L for both substances. Significantly more men (95-98%) than women (2-5%) abused cocaine, although their mean age was about the same (29-30 years). Mean age (\u00b1SD) of cocaine-related deaths was 29 \u00b1 7 years, which was not significantly different from 30 \u00b1 8 years in traffic cases (P > 0.05). The median concentration of cocaine in blood in 61 fatalities was 0.10 mg/L compared with 0.06 mg/L in traffic cases (P < 0.001). In drug intoxication deaths, the median concentration of cocaine was 0.13 mg/L (N = 25), which was not significantly different from 0.09 mg/L (N = 36) in other causes of death. Cocaine-related deaths mostly involved mixed drug intoxications including co-ingestion of heroin, cannabis, amphetamines as well as legal drugs, such as benzodiazepines and/or ethanol. The concentrations of cocaine in blood from living and deceased persons overlapped, which makes it infeasible to predict toxicity from the analytical toxicology results alone.", 
    "11": "Surgical resection of malignant disease remains one of the most effective tools for treating cancer. Tumor-targeted near-infrared dyes have the potential to improve contrast between normal and malignant tissues, thereby enabling surgeons to more quantitatively resect malignant disease. Because the cholecystokinin 2 receptor (CCK2R and its tumor-specific splice variant CCK2i4svR) is overexpressed in cancers of the lungs, colon, thyroid, pancreas, and stomach, but absent or inaccessible to parenterally administered drugs in most normal tissues, we have undertaken to design a targeting ligand that can deliver attached near-infrared dyes to CCK2R+ tumors. We report here the synthesis and biological characterization of a CCK2R-targeted conjugate of the near-infrared dye, LS-288 (CRL-LS288). We demonstrate that CRL-LS288 binds selectively to CCK2R+ cancer cells with low nanomolar affinity (Kd = 7 \u00d7 10(-9) M). We further show that CRL-LS288 localizes primarily to CCK2R-expressing HEK 293 murine tumor xenografts and that dye uptake in these xenografts is significantly reduced when CCK2R are blocked by preinjection of excess ligand (CRL) or when mice are implanted with CCK2R-negative tumors. Because CRL-LS288 is also found to reveal the locations of distant tumor metastases, we suggest that CRL-LS288 has the potential to facilitate intraoperative identification of malignant disease during a variety of cancer debulking surgeries.", 
    "12": "We present the case of a 40-year-old single man with a diagnosis of Schizoaffective Disorder since 1989 and a comorbid diagnosis of functional (dissociative) dysphonia since 2011. Although receiving ongoing treatment from a Speech and Language Therapist, the patient's symptoms of dysphonia have remained prominent from the time of diagnosis in 2011 and have been particularly apparent during times of psychosocial and interpersonal stress. He had a dramatic and complete resolution of all dysphonic symptoms during an acute relapse of the psychosis in February 2013 and experienced a gradual re-emergence of dysphonic symptoms when his episode of psychosis resolved. This is the first case report to demonstrate such an association and we discuss potential mechanisms for the resolution of dysphonic symptoms during this psychotic relapse.", 
    "13": "Febrile infants undergoing urethral catheterization (UC) are often not treated for pain and distress. The aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of midazolam premedication. We compared a convenience sample of infants who underwent UC with midazolam with those who did not receive midazolam. Outcome measures were Visual Analog Scale assessment, duration of cry, and emergency department length of stay. Thirty-two study participants and 18 controls were prospectively enrolled. Midazolam premedication showed a 53% decrease in the mean Visual Analog Scale score when parents assessed distress (33.6 vs. 71.7, P<0.0001) and a 48% decrease when nurses assessed distress (28.7 vs. 55.5, P<0.0002); the median cry duration was significantly shorter (0 vs. 240 s). Serious adverse events were not observed during sedation and at 48 h after discharge. Study participants had longer emergency department length of stay compared with the controls (191.5 vs. 139 min, P<0.017). In this cohort, midazolam significantly reduced the distress associated with UC without causing serious adverse events.", 
    "14": "A 64-year-old man without any psychiatric disease, including Parkinson's disease underwent aortic valve replacement and mitral valve replacement for rheumatic valvular disease. One day after the cardiac surgery, he developed hyperthermina, muscle rigidity, coma and delirium, and his serum creatine kinase (CK) level was elevated. In spite of his negative brain computed tomography(CT), his consciousness remained unclear. He had received diazepam, flunitrazepam and buprenorphine after the cardiac surgery because of his hyper-reactivity. Although these drugs were not typical antipsychotics' causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS), NMS was strongly suspected because of his clinical appearance. Dantrolene was administered in a dose of 60 mg per day and he recovered consciousness and his CK level began to decrease. We reported a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome after cardiac surgery.", 
    "15": "In humans, a first night effect (FNE) is characterized by increased sleep latency and decreased total sleep time in an unfamiliar environment, but the mechanism and treatment options for this universally experienced acute insomnia are unclear. We continuously recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) and measured plasma corticosterone levels to develop a mouse FNE model by inducing acute insomnia in mice that have been placed in unfamiliar cage environments. The sleep latency of mice 'moved to clean cages' (MCC) was longer than that for mice 'moved to dirty ones' (MDC). As compared to MDC mice, MCC mice showed stronger decreases in the amount of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) and REM sleep, with a lower power density of NREM sleep, increased fragmentation and decreased stage transitions from NREM sleep to wake, and higher variation in plasma corticosterone levels. Treatment of MCC mice with zolpidem, diazepam, raclopride, pyrilamine, except SCH23390 shortened NREM sleep latency. In addition, zolpidem significantly increased NREM and REM sleep with the increase in slow wave activity (1.00-2.75 Hz), while raclopride significantly increased NREM and REM sleep without changing the EEG power density in MCC mice, whereas diazepam increased sleep with a drastic decrease in power density of the frequency band between 1.00 and 4.00 Hz, diazepam also increased the frequency band between 9.75 and 24.75 Hz during NREM sleep. These results indicate that a MCC mouse can mimic a FNE phenotype of humans and that zolpidem and raclopride may be useful drugs to prevent acute insomnia, including FNE.", 
    "16": "Long-Evans rats downshifted from 32% to 4% sucrose solution exhibit lower consummatory behavior during downshift trials than rats exposed only to 4% sucrose. In Experiment 1, this effect, called consummatory successive negative contrast (cSNC), was attenuated by administration of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5mg/kg, ip) before the second downshift trial (Trial 12), but was not affected when CDP was administered before the first downshift trial (Trial 11). In Experiment 2, CDP administered after Trial 11 actually enhanced the cSNC effect on Trial 12. This posttrial effect of CDP was reduced by delayed administration (Experiment 3). This CDP effect was not present in the absence of incentive downshift (Experiments 4-5), or when animals were tested with the preshift incentive (Experiment 6) or after complete recovery from cSNC (Experiment 7). The posttrial CDP effect was observed after an 8-day interval between Trials 11 and 12 (Experiment 8) and when administered after Trial 12, rather than Trial 11 (Experiment 9). Experiment 10 extended the effect to Wistar rats. Because CDP is a memory interfering drug, it was hypothesized that its posttrial administration interferes with the consolidation of the memory of the downshifted incentive, thus prolonging the mismatch between expected (32% sucrose) and obtained (4% sucrose) incentives that leads to the cSNC effect.", 
    "17": "Schizophrenia is associated with impaired sleep continuity. The second generation antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine have been reported to improve sleep continuity but also to rarely induce restless legs syndrome (RLS). The aims of this randomized double-blind study were to compare the effects of clozapine and olanzapine on sleep and the occurrence of RLS. Therefore, polysomnographies were recorded and RLS symptoms were assessed in 30 patients with schizophrenia before and after 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine. Treatment with both antipsychotics increased total sleep time, sleep period time and sleep efficiency and decreased sleep onset latency. These changes were similar in both groups, occurred during the first 2 treatment weeks and were sustained. For example, sleep efficiency increased from 83% (olanzapine) and 82% (clozapine) at baseline to 95% at week 2 and 97% at week 6 in both treatment groups. Sleep architecture was differently affected: clozapine caused a significantly stronger increase of stage 2 sleep (44%) than olanzapine (11%) but olanzapine a significantly stronger increase of REM-sleep. Olanzapine caused an 80% increase of slow wave sleep whereas clozapine caused a 6% decrease. No patient reported any of 4 RLS defining symptoms at baseline. During treatment, 1 patient of each group reported at one visit all 4 symptoms, i.e. met the diagnosis of an RLS. In conclusion, sleep continuity similarly improved and sleep architecture changed more physiologically with olanzapine. Neither of the antipsychotics induced RLS symptoms that were clinically relevant.",

In the present study, we examined the functional significance of Itonic in SON MNCs challenged by 24-h water deprivation (24WD). Although the main characteristics of spontaneous IPSCs were similar in 24WD compared to euhydrated (EU) rats, Itonic , measured by bicuculline (BIC)-induced Iholding shifts, was significantly smaller in 24WD compared to EU rats (P < 0.05). Propofol and diazepam prolonged IPSC decay time to a similar extent in both groups but induced less Itonic in 24WD compared to EU rats, suggesting a selective decrease in GABAA receptors mediating Itonic over Iphasic in 24WD rats. THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol), a preferential \u03b4 subunit agonist, and L-655,708, a GABAA receptor \u03b15 subunit selective imidazobenzodiazepine, caused a significantly smaller inward and outward shift in Iholding , respectively, in 24WD compared to EU rats (P < 0.05 in both cases), suggesting an overall decrease in the \u03b15 subunit-containing GABAA Rs and the \u03b4 subunit-containing receptors mediating Itonic in 24WD animals. Consistent with a decrease in 24WD Itonic , bath application of GABA induced significantly less inhibition of the neuronal firing activity in 24WD compared to EU SON MNCs (P < 0.05). Taken together, the results of the present study indicate a selective decrease in GABAA Rs functions mediating Itonic as opposed to those mediating Iphasic in SON MNCs, demonstrating the functional significance of Itonic with respect to increasing neuronal excitability and hormone secretion in 24WD rats.",

Here we report that pairing a thiadiazole moiety with a 2,3-benzodiazepine scaffold via the N-3 position yields an inhibitor type with >28-fold better potency and selectivity on AMPA receptors than the 2,3-benzodiazepine scaffold alone. Using whole-cell recording, we characterized two thiadiazolyl compounds, that is, one contains a 1,3,4-thiadiazole moiety and the other contains a 1,2,4-thiadiazole-3-one moiety. These compounds exhibit potent, equal inhibition of both the closed-channel and the open-channel conformations of all four homomeric AMPA receptor channels and two GluA2R-containing complex AMPA receptor channels. Furthermore, these compounds bind to the same receptor site as GYKI 52466 does, a site we previously termed as the \"M\" site. A thiadiazole moiety is thought to occupy more fully the side pocket of the receptor site or the \"M\" site, thereby generating a stronger, multivalent interaction between the inhibitor and the receptor binding site. We suggest that, as a heterocycle, a thiadiazole can be further modified chemically to produce a new class of even more potent, noncompetitive inhibitors of AMPA receptors.",

The investigations sought scientific evidence for the ethnomedicinal use of the leaves for the management of insomnia and anxiety as well as the neural mechanisms for the activities. The sedative and anxiolytic effects of the extracts of the leaves of Stachytarpheta cayennensis were examined in this study. The methanolic extract (5-50 mg/kg, i.p.) as well as the ethylacetate (10-50 mg/kg, i.p.), butanol and aqueous fractions (5-50 mg/kg, i.p.) of the extract were examined. Sedation was assessed as reduced novelty-induced rearing (NIR), reduced spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA) and increased pentobarbitone-induced sleeping time (PIST) in mice. The anti-anxiety effect (methanol 2.5-5.0; butanol 5.0; aqueous 20.0; ethylacetate 25.0 mg/kg, i.p.) was assessed using an elevated plus maze. LD50 was calculated for the extract and the fractions after the intraperitoneal route of administration using the Locke method. The methanolic extract, the butanol and the aqueous fractions inhibited rearing and spontaneous locomotion but prolonged pentobarbitone induced sleep. The ethylacetate fraction however increased both rearing and locomotion and decreased pentobarbitone sleeping time. The butanol and aqueous fractions, but not the methanol extract showed indices of open arm avoidance consistent with anti-anxiety effect. Naltrexone (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the inhibition of rearing, locomotion and prolongation of pentobarbitone sleep due to the aqueous fraction of the extract. Flumazenil (2mg/kg, i.p.) abolished the effects of both methanolic extract and the butanol fraction on rearing, locomotion, pentobarbitone sleep and anxiety model. The methanolic extract, the butanol and aqueous fractions possess sedative activity while the ethylacetate fraction possesses stimulant property. The anxiolytic effect was found in both the aqueous fraction and the butanol fraction but not in the main methanol extract and also not in the ethylacetate fraction. Flumazenil, blocked the effect of the leaves of Stachytarpheta cayennensis on rearing, locomotion and elevated plus maze suggesting that GABA receptors are involved in the observed sedative and anxiolytic activities. This study also found opioid receptors involved in the sedative activity of the leaves of Stachytarpheta cayennensis. The rationale for the ethnomedicinal use of the leaves for the management of insomnia and anxiety were confirmed scientifically in this study.",

In the current era of medical progress, several factors have led to the development of guidelines for MS management. There is continued need for an evidence-based approach supported by high-quality data from controlled clinical trials. Most healthcare systems require this approach and include it in the reimbursement process. Guidelines are usually committed by national or continental neurological societies. The Spanish Society of Neurology demyelinating diseases working group has developed a consensus document on spasticity in patients with MS. MS experts from the group used the metaplan method to sum up the most important recommendations about spasticity for inclusion in the guidance. Recommendations were classified according to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network system and approved by all members of the group. In Germany, the guideline panel of the German Neurological Society endorsed the national competence network for multiple sclerosis (Krankheitsbezogenes Kompetenznetz Multiple Sklerose) to update the existing recommendations. The most recent fifth edition of the guidelines (dated April 2012) now also includes recommendations for treatment of key symptoms such as spasticity. More than 30 MS neurologists contributed to the new edition reflecting the need for broad expertise. After a first round in which key topics were defined, a web-based decision process was undertaken to further develop individual topics such as symptomatic therapy. The draft manuscript was reviewed once again by the group prior to submission to the official review process. The aims of spasticity treatment are to improve mobility and dexterity, achieve physiological movement patterns, reduce pain, facilitate nursing measures and avoid complications such as contractures. Representative antispasticity medications include baclofen, tizanidine, gabapentin, dantrolene, tolperisone, benzodiazepines and Sativex\u00ae oromucosal spray. Botulinum toxin and intrathecal baclofen may also be required in selected cases. Plans are currently in motion to develop next-level European guidelines through a concerted approach coordinated by the European Federation of Neurological Societies.",

    "97": "BET (bromodomain and extra-terminal) proteins regulate gene expression through their ability to bind to acetylated chromatin and subsequently activate RNA PolII-driven transcriptional elongation. Small molecule BET inhibitors prevent binding of BET proteins to acetylated histones and inhibit transcriptional activation of BET target genes. BET inhibitors attenuate cell growth and survival in several hematologic cancer models, partially through the down-regulation of the critical oncogene, MYC. We hypothesized that BET inhibitors will regulate MYC expression in solid tumors that frequently over-express MYC. Here we describe the effects of the highly specific BET inhibitor, I-BET762, on MYC expression in prostate cancer models. I-BET762 potently reduced MYC expression in prostate cancer cell lines and a patient-derived tumor model with subsequent inhibition of cell growth and reduction of tumor burden in vivo. Our data suggests that I-BET762 effects are partially driven by MYC down-regulation and underlines the critical importance of additional mechanisms of I-BET762 induced phenotypes.",

In this study, we aimed to clarify the duration of OATP inhibition by grapefruit juice (GFJ), and to compare it with the duration of GFJ-induced inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 activity. Seven healthy volunteers were enrolled in this open-label, single-sequence study. They were orally administered celiprolol (100\u2009mg) and midazolam (15\u2009\u00b5g/kg) with water on the control day. Three days later, they ingested GFJ (200\u2009mL) 3 times a day for 3\u2009d. On day 1, the same drugs were administered with GFJ. On days 3 and 7, the same drugs were administered with water. Pharmacokinetics of both drugs were evaluated on each trial day. The peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 8\u2009h (AUC0-8) of celiprolol significantly decreased on day 1, and the mean ratios of these values and the corresponding control-day values were 0.18 and 0.25, respectively. The Cmax and AUC0-8 returned to the control levels on days 3 and 7. In contrast, AUC0-8 of midazolam were higher on days 1 and 3 than on the control day (mean ratio, 2.12 and 1.47, respectively). The AUC0-8 returned to the control level on day 7. In conclusion, results of this study indicated that the OATP inhibition caused by GFJ dissipated faster than GFJ-mediated alterations in CYP3A4 activity, which were sustained for at least 48\u2009h.", 
    "99": "As an important part of risk-related defensive behavior and central element of anxiety, risk assessment in rodents is particularly sensitive to psychosocial stress and may consequently influence the following decision-making and behavioral output. In this study, using a mouse-test battery, we evaluated the possible impacts of chronic mild stress (CMS) on risk assessment behaviors and action selections. For non-stressed control animals, a close relationship between risk assessment and choice behavior was observed in EPM and LDT. For stressed animals, however, 5 weeks of CMS exposure not only increased risk assessment behaviors, but also abolished the correlations between risk assessment and action selection. Pharmacological intervention with GABA-A receptor modulator diazepam (0.25-4 mg/kg) blocked the alterations of conventional spatiotemporal behaviors in response to CMS, but had no effect on the CMS-induced risk assessment behavioral changes. In contrast, 4-weeks of chronic treatment with fluoxetine (4-20mg/kg), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not only ameliorated the CMS-affected risk-assessment behaviors, but also restored the CMS-impaired correlations between risk assessment and decision making-related action selection. The present findings may shed new light on the better understanding of emotional reactivity and decision making under stressful situations. These results also indicate a differential pharmacological sensitivity in CMS-affected emotional response and risk-assessment behaviors.", 
    "100": "Clonazepam (CLZ) is a benzodiazepine derivative, whose bioavailability, limited by its very poor water-solubility, could be improved by cyclodextrin complexation. However, the choice of the most proper cyclodextrin to use to fully exploit its potential favourable effects on the drug, is a critical step. Therefore, in the present work, the performance of some amorphous cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives in terms of complexing, solubilizing and amorphizing power towards CLZ was carefully evaluated and compared with that of natural CDs. The role of CD cavity size, amorphous or crystalline nature, and presence and type of substituents on its ability in producing effective interactions with the drug has been investigated. Equimolar CLZ-CD solid systems were obtained by blending, kneading, co-grinding and coevaporation. Drug-CD interactions were investigated by phase-solubility analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffractometry. Among the natural CDs, \u03b2-CD showed the highest complexing ability, suggesting that its cavity size is the most proper to host the drug molecule. The presence of substituents had a negative effect on the performance of \u03b1-CD and \u03b3-CD, while it improved the complexing and solubilizing power of \u03b2-CD, and the methylated derivative was more effective than the hydroxypropylated one. Solid-state studies revealed that amorphous CDs had highest amorphizing power than the corresponding natural crystalline ones, and methylated-\u03b2-CD (Me-\u03b2-CD) was the best carrier. As for the preparation method, co-grinding was the most powerful in promoting the formation of efficacious drug-CD solid-state interactions. Dissolution rate studies confirmed Me-\u03b2-CD as the best partner for CLZ and co-grinding as the best method for maximizing the drug dissolution properties. Therefore, co-ground products with Me-\u03b2-CD could be selected as the best system for future development of CLZ formulations with improved therapeutic efficacy.",

    "111": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are the most important inhibitory chloride ion channels in the central nervous system and are major targets for a wide variety of drugs. The subunit compositions of GABA(A)Rs determine their function and pharmacological profile. GABAA Rs are heteropentamers of subunits, and (\u03b11)2 (\u03b23)2 (\u03b32L)1 is a common subtype. Biochemical and biophysical studies of GABA(A)Rs require larger quantities of receptors of defined subunit composition than are currently available. We previously reported high-level production of active human \u03b11\u03b23 GABA(A)R using tetracycline-inducible stable HEK293 cells. Here we extend the strategy to receptors containing three different subunits. We constructed a stable tetracycline-inducible HEK293-TetR cell line expressing human (N)-FLAG-\u03b11\u03b23\u03b32L-(C)-(GGS)3 GK-1D4 GABA(A)R. These cells achieved expression levels of 70-90 pmol [(3)H]muscimol binding sites/15-cm plate at a specific activity of 15-30 pmol/mg of membrane protein. Incorporation of the \u03b32 subunit was confirmed by the ratio of [(3)H]flunitrazepam to [(3)H]muscimol binding sites and sensitivity of GABA-induced currents to benzodiazepines and zinc. The \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32L GABA(A)Rs were solubilized in dodecyl-D-maltoside, purified by anti-FLAG affinity chromatography and reconstituted in CHAPS/asolectin at an overall yield of \u223c 30%. Typical purifications yielded 1.0-1.5 nmoles of [(3)H]muscimol binding sites/60 plates. Receptors with similar properties could be purified by 1D4 affinity chromatography with lower overall yield. The composition of the purified, reconstituted receptors was confirmed by ligand binding, Western blot, and proteomics. Allosteric interactions between etomidate and [(3)H]muscimol binding were maintained in the purified state.", 
    "112": "Moderate hypothermia has become an established therapy for asphyxiated neonates. Midazolam is a frequently used sedative for this indication, although it has never been investigated how therapeutic hypothermia and asphyxia influence midazolam metabolism in neonates.9 asphyxiated newborns were treated with whole body hypothermia of 32-34\u00b0C for 72 h and all of them received continuous midazolam infusion for sedation. Serum concentrations of midazolam and its metabolites 1-hydroxy-midazolam and 4-hydroxy-midazolam were measured during hypothermia and the rewarming period. Renal and hepatic parameters were assessed to take into account the influence of asphyxia related renal or hepatic impairment.We found a high interindividual variability of serum midazolam concentrations in asphyxiated neonates with therapeutic hypothermia; median midazolam concentration was 369.3\u2009ng/ml (minimum 36.6; maximum 3\u2009218.6\u2009ng/ml). The population pharmacokinetic model revealed a midazolam clearance of 2.57\u2009ml/kg/min, comparable to midazolam clearances observed in normothermic critically ill neonates. However, midazolam clearance was significantly decreased in patients with asphyxia related renal and hepatic impairment.It seems that isolated hypothermia does not significantly influence midazolam metabolism. However, neonates with asphyxia related hepatic and renal impairment are at risk of generating unexpectedly high serum midazolam concentrations. In addition pronounced interindividual variability of midazolam metabolism may contribute to dangerously high midazolam concentrations.",

We conducted a systematic review of randomized control trials and used meta-analytic methods to quantify the overall effect size. PubMed and the Cochrane libraries were searched for eligible trials.

The treatment of the underlying disease should therefore be prioritised. In the symptomatic treatment of insomnia cognitive-behavioural strategies are established. Drug therapy should be considered only if non-pharmacological treatments fail. Most hypnotics have a poor risk-benefit ratio in older patients. In acute severe sleep disturbances prescription of short-acting benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics in low doses over a short period of time is acceptable. In patients suffering from chronic insomnia a treatment with sedative antidepressants can be considered keeping in mind possible adverse effects. Studies analysing the current status of care for elderly insomnia patients in Germany are limited. Analyses of health insurance data suggest that especially nursing home patients often use hypnotics. The treatment of sleep disorders in elderly patients must therefore be optimized in practice.",

In the optimized approach, freeze-dried sewage sludge samples were extracted by means of pressurized liquid extraction, and the extracts were further cleaned-up by solid phase extraction. Analytes were determined by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. Method limits of quantification were below 3.3ng/g d.w. for all compounds but cannabinoids (8.2-22.5ng/g d.w.). Method repeatability was below 14% for most compounds. Overall method recoveries were low due to the presence of matrix interferences that could not be completely eliminated and suppressed the ionization of the target analytes between 26% and 89%. However, extraction losses and matrix effects were satisfactorily corrected through the use of isotopically labeled analogs as surrogate standards, ensuring reliable results. The method was applied to the analysis of various sewage sludge samples.

Psychiatrists in charge of this patient found it difficult to attribute his seizures to alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) because of the atypical onset. The patient responded to diazepam resumption and valproate combination. This case highlights the need to always consider AWS as a possible cause of seizures and to gradually decrease diazepam as a substitute for alcohol.

    "172": "Schlager BPH/2J hypertensive mice have high blood pressure (BP) likely due to overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system regulated by neurons in amygdala-hypothalamic pathways. These areas are normally under tonic inhibition by GABA containing neurons that may be deficient in Schlager hypertensive mice as suggested by microarray analysis. In the present study, cardiovascular effects of chronic activation of GABAA receptors were examined in BPH/2J mice.", 
    "173": "Male normotensive BPN/3J and hypertensive BPH/2J mice were administered diazepam in drinking water for 7 days. BP, heart rate and locomotor activity were recorded by telemetry.", 
    "174": "Diazepam (2.5 mg/kg) reduced BP of BPN/3J mice during the night-time by -7.1 \u00b1 2.0 mmHg (P = 0.001) but had no effect in BPH/2J mice (+2 \u00b1 2 mmHg) and no effect on heart rate or locomotor activity in either strain. Diazepam reduced the responses to restraint stress in BPN/3J mice by 20% (P = 0.01) and there was no association between Fos-immunoreactive neurons and neurons expressing GABAA receptors or neuropeptide Y in the medial amygdala and paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. By contrast diazepam had no effect on the pressor response to stress in BPH/2J mice and ~50% of stress-activated neurons in these regions also expressed GABAA receptors and ~45% were neuropeptide Y-containing.", 
    "175": "These findings show that BPH/2J mice are resistant to the effects of diazepam and suggest that GABAA receptor dysfunction in BPH/2J mice may be contributing to the neurogenic hypertension by not suppressing arousal-induced sympathetic activation within amygdala and hypothalamic nuclei.", 
    "176": "A hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography/positive ion electrospray-mass spectrometry (HILIC-ESI/MS) has been developed and fully validated for the quantification of alprazolam and its main metabolite, \u03b1-hydroxy-alprazolam, in human plasma. The assay is based on 50\u03bcL plasma samples, following liquid-liquid extraction. All analytes and the internal standard (tiamulin) were separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography using an X-Bridge-HILIC analytical column (150.0mm\u00d72.1mm i.d., particle size 3.5\u03bcm) under isoscratic elution. The mobile phase was composed of a 7% 10mM ammonium formate water solution in acetonitrile and pumped at a flow rate of 0.20mLmin(-1). Running in positive electrospray ionization and selected ion monitoring (SIM) the mass spectrometer was set to analyze the protonated molecules [M+H](+) at m/z 309, 325 and 494 for alprazolam, \u03b1-hydroxy-alprazolam and tiamulin (ISTD) respectively. The assay was linear over the concentration range of 2.5-250ngmL(-1) for alprazolam and 2.5-50ngmL(-1) for \u03b1-hydroxy alprazolam. Intermediate precision was less than 4.1% over the tested concentration ranges. The method is the first reported application of HILIC in the analysis benzodiazepines in human plasma. With a small sample size (50\u03bcL human plasma) and a run time less than 10.0min for each sample the method can be used to support a wide range of clinical studies concerning alprazolam quantification.", 
    "177": "A new, efficient, and environmental friendly hollow fiber liquid phase microextraction (HF-LPME) method based on supramolecular solvents was developed for extraction of five benzodiazepine drugs. The supramolecular solvent was produced from coacervation of decanoic acid aqueous vesicles in the presence of tetrabutylammonium (Bu4N(+)). In this work, benzodiazepines were extracted from aqueous samples into a supramolecular solvent impregnated in the wall pores and also filled inside the porous polypropylene hollow fiber membrane. The driving forces for the extraction were hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, and \u03c0-cation interactions between the analytes and the vesicular aggregates. High-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection (HPLC-DAD) was applied for separation and determination of the drugs. Several parameters affecting the extraction efficiency including pH, hollow fiber length, ionic strength, stirring rate, and extraction time were investigated and optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the preconcentration factors were obtained in the range of 112-198. Linearity of the method was determined to be in the range of 1.0-200.0 \u03bcg L(-1) for diazepam and 2.0-200.0 \u03bcg L(-1) for other analytes with coefficient of determination (R(2)) ranging from 0.9954 to 0.9993. The limits of detection for the target benzodiazepines were in the range of 0.5-0.7 \u03bcg L(-1). The method was successfully applied for extraction and determination of the drugs in water, fruit juice, plasma and urine samples and relative recoveries of the compounds studied were in the range of 90.0-98.8%.", 
    "178": "The Word Memory Test (WMT) and Medical Symptom Validity Test (MSVT) are two commonly used free-standing measures of test-taking effort. The use of any test as a measure of effort is enhanced when evidence shows that it can be easily passed by patients with severe neurological conditions. The opportunity arose to administer the WMT and MSVT to a 9-year-old girl (referred to as CJ) with severe congenital bilateral brain tissue loss (shown via a compelling brain MRI image), chronic epilepsy, an extremely low Full Scale IQ, extremely low adaptive functioning, developmental delays, numerous severe cognitive impairments, and treatment with multiple high-dose benzodiazepines. She received extensive early intervention services and numerous academic accommodations. Despite this set of problems, CJ passed the WMT and MSVT at perfect to near perfect levels. Implications for failure on these tests among patients with known or alleged mild traumatic brain injury are discussed.",

    "180": "A total of 80 patients, 40 men, median age 58 (range 23-76) years, who underwent PVI under conscious sedation were studied. They were randomized to either standard treatment with morphine and diazepam (control group, C) or to a more active analgesic strategy (A) with pre-medication with oral midazolam mixture and intravenous alfentanil and midazolam regularly administrated during the procedure. Forty patients were treated with RF and 40 with Cryo.", 
    "181": "The majority of the patients experienced pain during the procedure. The maximal pain assessed with numerical rating scale (NRS), was lower in the active group compared with that in controls (p = 0.02). Women experienced more pain than men (p = 0.01). RF was more painful than Cryo (p < 0.001).",

    "183": "In this study we developed a new drug delivery system for olanzanpine comprised of drug-loaded lipid-core nanocapsules incorporated in a thermosensitive hydrogel, intended to sustain the drug release. Firstly, olanzapine, a hydrophobic drug, was loaded in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) lipid core nanocapsules prepared by interfacial deposition of preformed polymer. The effects of the presence of ethanol and the amounts of sorbitan monostearate and medium-chain triglycerides on the particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, presence of microparticles and encapsulation efficiency were investigated using a 2(3) factorial design. The optimized nanocapsules were incorporated into a hydrophilic polymer (Poloxamer 407) dispersion in order to obtain a thermosensitive gel. The formulation containing 0.077 g of sorbitan monostearate, 0.22 ml of medium-chain triglycerides, 3 ml of ethanol and 18% of the thermosensitive polymer was selected according to the physicochemical properties. The rheology and release profiles of the mixed hydrophobic and hydrophilic delivery system were successfully characterized and revealed its great potential for the administration of hydrophobic drugs such as olanzapine with sustained in situ drug release.", 
    "184": "Drunk or drug-impaired drivers represent a major public health and societal problem worldwide. Because over 95% of drivers killed on the roads in Sweden are autopsied, reliable information is available about the use of alcohol and/or other drug before the crash.", 
    "185": "This retrospective 4-year study (2008-2011) used a forensic toxicology database (TOXBASE) to evaluate the concentrations of alcohol and other drugs in blood samples from drivers killed in road-traffic crashes.", 
    "186": "The mean age of all victims (N = 895) was 48 \u00b1 20 years, and the majority were male (86%). In 504 drivers (56%), the results of toxicological analysis were negative and these victims were older; mean age (\u00b1 SD) 47 \u00b1 20 years, than alcohol positive cases (35 \u00b1 14 years) and illicit drug users (34 \u00b1 15 years). In 21% of fatalities, blood-alcohol concentration (BAC) was above the statutory limit for driving (0.2 g/L), although the median BAC was appreciably higher (1.72 g/L). Illicit drugs (mainly amphetamine and cannabis) were identified in ~7% of victims, either alone (2.5%), together with alcohol (1.8%) or a prescription drug (2%). The psychoactive prescription drugs identified were mainly benzodiazepines, z-hypnotics and tramadol, which were found in the blood of 7.6% of crash victims.", 
    "187": "The high median BAC in fatally-injured drivers speaks strongly towards alcohol-induced impairment as being responsible for the crash. Compared with alcohol, the prevalence of illicit and psychoactive prescription drugs was fairly low despite a dramatic increase in the number of drug-impaired drivers arrested by the police after a zero-tolerance law was introduced in 1999.", 
    "188": "Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are important transducers of external signals for cell growth, survival, and other cellular responses including cell differentiation. Several MAPK cascades are known with the MEK1/2-ERK1/2, JNK, and p38MAPKs receiving most attention, but the role of MEK5-ERK5 in intracellular signaling deserves more scrutiny, as this pathway transmits signals that can complement ERK/2 signaling. We hypothesized that the ERK5 pathway plays a role in the control of monocytic differentiation, which is disturbed in myeloid leukemia. We therefore examined the cellular phenotype and key molecular events which occur when human myeloid leukemia cells, acute (AML) or chronic (CML), are forced to differentiate by vitamin D derivatives (VDDs). This study was performed using established cell lines HL60 and U937, and primary cultures of blasts from 10 patients with ML. We found that ERK5 and its direct downstream target transcription factor MEF2C are upregulated by 1,25D in parallel with monocytic differentiation. Further, inhibition of ERK5 activity by specific pharmacological agents BIX02189 and XMD8-92 alters the phenotype of these cells by reducing the abundance of the VDD-induced surface monocytic marker CD14, and concomitantly increasing surface expression of the general myeloid marker CD11b. Similar results were obtained when the expression of ERK5 was reduced by siRNA or short hairpin (sh) RNA. ERK5 inhibition resulted in an expected decrease in MEF2C activation. We also found that in AML cells the transcription factor C/EBP\u03b2 is positively regulated, while C/EBP\u03b1 is negatively regulated by ERK5. These findings provide new understanding of dysregulated differentiation in human myeloid leukemia.", 
    "189": "Gastric emptying and gastric secretion are two major physiological functions of the stomach. The assessment of these functions in particular in small animals is challenging; no method currently available allows the simultaneous measurement of both functions, and methods used are lethal or invasive and often limited by spatial, temporal, or quantitative resolution. Here, we report the establishment and validation of a quantitative noninvasive high-throughput computed tomography-based method to measure simultaneously gastric emptying and secretion in rats in vivo. The imaging strategy enables one to visualize stomach anatomy and to quantify stomach volume and stomach contrast agent content. The method was validated by comparing the results to classical lethal methods (stomach phenol red content and stomach wet weight). Additionally, we showed that the use of a mild anesthetic does not interfere with normal gastric function, thereby enabling high-resolution temporal studies within single animals. These combined advantages were applied to reevaluate the impact of cholecystokinin (CCK), histamine, and oral glucose solutions on gastric function with high temporal resolution. CCK inhibited gastric emptying completely for 20 min, leading to the accumulation of gastric juice in the stomach. The CCK antagonist devazepide blocked this effect. Histamine stimulated both gastric secretion and delayed emptying. Oral glucose solution emptied at a fixed rate of 24-31 cal/min and stimulated gastric secretion. These results confirm previous observations and add volumetric changes as a new dimension. As computed tomography scanners become broadly available, this method is an excellent approach to measure the combined gastric functional readout and to reduce the number of animals used.", 
    "190": "Children living in homes with drug-addicted parents are in a steady danger of poisoning and may suffer from neglect, maltreatment, and lagging behind in development. Hair analysis could be a suitable way to examine this endangering exposure to drugs.", 
    "191": "Hair samples from 149 children (aged 1-14 years) living with parents substituted by methadone and/or suspected for abuse of illegal drugs, and from 124 of the parents in a German community were investigated by liquid chromatography-hybrid quadrupole time-of flight mass spectrometry and by headspace solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for methadone, heroin, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines and their metabolites or degradation products (32 compounds).", 
    "192": "From the children's hair, only in 35 samples, no drugs were detected. Cannabinoids were found in 56 samples, in 20 of them as the only drug. In the remaining 95 samples, methadone was identified 35 times with additional use of illegal drugs in 28 cases. Drug use in the children's environment was obvious for heroin in 44 cases, cocaine in 73 cases, amphetamine or ecstasy in 6 cases, and diazepam in 8 cases. The concentrations varied from limit of quantification to 2.16 ng/mg of methadone, 11.1 ng/mg of 6-acetylmorphine, 17.8 ng/mg of cocaine, 3.29 ng/mg of amphetamine, and 0.72 ng/mg of \u0394-tetrahydrocannabinol. In general, hair from younger children contained higher concentrations than from their elder siblings. Systemic incorporation of methadone, cocaine, or cannabinoids appeared likely from detection of the nonhydrolytic metabolites 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine in 11 cases, norcocaine in 16 cases, and 11-nor-9-carboxy-\u0394-tetrahydrocannabinol in 9 cases. Within the families, hair samples of children and parents provided often the same drug pattern. External deposition from smoke and by contact with contaminated surfaces or parent's hands and systemic deposition after passive smoking, administration, or oral intake by hand-to-mouth transfer were discussed as alternative incorporation mechanisms into hair.", 
    "193": "Altogether, investigation of children's hair proved to be a useful way to detect endangering drug use in their environment and lead to a more thorough inspection and measures to improve their situation in many of the cases.", 
    "194": "The belladonna alkaloids can be isolated from a number of plants, which contain hallucinogens that represent a serious danger to infants, children, and adolescents. Roots, leaves, and fruits of the plant contain the alkaloids atropine, hyoscyamine, and scopolamine, which can lead to an anticholinergic toxidrome; however, not all characteristics of the toxidrome are necessarily present in each case of poisoning. A retrospective chart review of all children seen following anticholinergic ingestions, between April 2001 and November 2010, at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. Ten children, with a mean age of 15.5 years (range, 15-18 years), were identified; 5 had used jimsonweed and the others had a variety of tablets containing atropine. All 10 presented with severe anticholinergic symptoms and 2 with suicide attempts. Treatments included charcoal, benzodiazepines, haloperidol, and physostigmine, and 2 patients were intubated. Ingestion and subsequent severe anticholinergic toxidrome occurred exclusively in adolescents. It is important to educate this age group regarding the toxicity and potential risks associated with the recreational use of these plants and substances. Physostigmine can help in both the diagnosis and management of patients intoxicated with these substances.", 
    "195": "Impaired dexterity is a major psychomotor deficit reported in patients with schizophrenia. In the present study, the Purdue pegboard test was used to compare the manual dexterity in patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We also examined the influence of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and benzodiazepine-like drugs on manual dexterity. Subjects were 93 patients with schizophrenia and 93 healthy controls, matched for sex and age distributions. Control subjects scored significantly higher on all scores of Purdue pegboard than patients with schizophrenia. Age, PANSS negative symptom scale, typical antipsychotic dose, and use of benzodiazepines and/or benzodiazepine-like drugs were negatively correlated with the pegboard scores in patients with schizophrenia. The present results indicate that patients with schizophrenia have impaired gross and fine fingertip dexterity compared to healthy controls. The use of typical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines and/or benzodiazepine-like drugs, but not atypical antipsychotics, had significant negative impact on dexterity in patients with schizophrenia. Psychiatrists should be aware that some psychotropic medications may enhance the disability caused by the impairment of dexterity in patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "196": "Emerging evidence indicates that diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) mediates an endogenous benzodiazepine-mimicking (endozepine) effect on synaptic inhibition in the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRT). Here we demonstrate that DBI peptide colocalizes with both astrocytic and neuronal markers in mouse nRT, and investigate the role of astrocytic function in endozepine modulation in this nucleus by testing the effects of the gliotoxin fluorocitrate (FC) on synaptic inhibition and endozepine signaling in the nRT using patch-clamp recordings. FC treatment reduced the effective inhibitory charge of GABAA receptor (GABAAR)-mediated spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in WT mice, indicating that astrocytes enhance GABAAR responses in the nRT. This effect was abolished by both a point mutation that inhibits classical benzodiazepine binding to GABAARs containing the \u03b13 subunit (predominant in the nRT) and a chromosomal deletion that removes the Dbi gene. Thus, astrocytes are required for positive allosteric modulation via the \u03b13 subunit benzodiazepine-binding site by DBI peptide family endozepines. Outside-out sniffer patches pulled from neurons in the adjacent ventrobasal nucleus, which does not contain endozepines, show a potentiated response to laser photostimulation of caged GABA when placed in the nRT. FC treatment blocked the nRT-dependent potentiation of this response, as did the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. When sniffer patches were placed in the ventrobasal nucleus, however, subsequent treatment with FC led to potentiation of the uncaged GABA response, suggesting nucleus-specific roles for thalamic astrocytes in regulating inhibition. Taken together, these results suggest that astrocytes are required for endozepine actions in the nRT, and as such can be positive modulators of synaptic inhibition.", 
    "197": "Catatonia is a syndrome characterized by mutism, stupor, immobility, negativism, posturing, stereotypy, and echophenomena. Not only patients with schizophrenia, but also patients with general medical disease, mood disorder, and substance-related disorder exhibit catatonia. In the patients with catatonia, it is recommended to examine whether they have a general medical disease. We present two catatonic elder patients. Case 1 exhibited catatonia with vascular dementia, and was revealed to have anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome. Case 2 exhibited catatonia with dementia with Lewy bodies, and was revealed to have Hashimoto's encephalopathy. The first recommended treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines. In case of benzodiazepine resistance or malignant catatonia, it should be considered electroconvulsive therapy, but it needs to be carefully implemented for elder patients.", 
    "198": "Anxiety disorder (AD) often is under diagnosed and under treated in older adults, especially when the clinical presentation of anxiety. Symptoms often overlap with medical conditions. Of all the anxiety disorders in later life, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most frequently diagnosed. AD is often comorbid with depression. AD is associated with excess disability. Anxiety in older adults has traditionally been treated pharmacology, often with benzodiazepine. However, the clinical recommendations for pharmacologic treatment actually have been much broader, including suggestions to consider serotonergic antidepressants. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin nor epinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) generally are safe and procedure fewer side effects compared with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), in older patients. Effective treatment includes pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and complementary and alternative therapies. Late life AD is associated with substantial impairments in quality of life. Effective treatment for AD may be one of the most predictors of improvement of QOL.", 
    "199": "Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine central nervous system depressant available as an injection, tablet, or oral syrup. The need for alternative dosage form options for patients unable to take tablets and shortages of other forms of the drug have led compounding pharmacies to seek alternatives, mainly solutions and suspensions. Additionally, some patients are unable to use suspending agents containing alcohol or sorbitol. The objective of this study was to determine the stability of midazolam in sorbitol-free, alcohol-free SyrSpend SF and SyrSpend SF Cherry suspending agents. The studied samples were compounded into a 1-mg/mL suspension and stored in low-actinic plastic bottles at temperatures between 2 degrees C to 8 degrees C and at room temperature conditions. Six samples were assayed at each time point out to 58 days by a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. The method was validated for its specificity through forced-degradation studies. The samples remained within 90% to 110% of the initial concentration throughout the course of the study. Based on the data collected, the beyond-use date of these preparations is at least 58 days when protected from light at both refrigerated and room temperature storage conditions.",

    "202": "All in vitro and in vivo studies that evaluated the immune-modulating properties of analgesic and sedation agents commonly used in the critically ill were included. Full-text and abstract-only articles (noted) were included in this review. Inclusion criteria were met by 46 studies and were evaluated.", 
    "203": "Analgesic and sedation agents have been shown to be immunosuppressive in a variety of models. In vitro models use a variety of immune cells to demonstrate the immunosuppressive properties of opioids, benzodiazepines, and to a lesser extent, propofol. In each case, animal studies provide more robust data supporting the concept that opioids, benzodiazepines, and propofol exhibit immunosuppressive activities ranging from innate to adaptive immune alterations. Human studies, though more limited, provide further support that these agents inhibit the immune response. In contrast, data have shown that dexmedetomidine may attenuate the immune system. Clinical trial data evaluating the immunosuppressive properties of these agents is limited.", 
    "204": "Analgesic and sedation agents have clearly been shown to alter cellular function and other mediators of the immune system; yet the clinical impact remains to be fully elucidated. The mechanism by which sedation interruption reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia may in fact be a reduction in immunosuppressive effects. Studies linking the immune-modulating effects of analgesic and sedation agents in critically ill patients are needed."
