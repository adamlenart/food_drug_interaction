MZ was administered to 103 patients (ASA 1-2), of whom 50 patients were premedicated with atropine sulfate 0.5mg and pethidine hydrochloride (group P), with 53 patients receiving no premedication (group nP). A double blind randomized trial was conducted with the dose of MZ (0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08 mg.kg-1), and MZ was administered i.v. to patients just prior to spinal puncture. The short-term and long-term memories were impaired after administration of MZ in both groups. But the recovery from impairment of memories was more rapid in the short-term memory than in the long-term memory, suggesting that MZ impairs mainly the acquisition of memories. A dose-dependent decrease in SpO2 was observed in group P. We conclude that MZ is a useful drug to relieve anxiety of patients during surgery, but it accompanies the risk of respiratory depression.", 
    "1": "The videoradiographic examination described was designed for habitual snorers and sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) patients and was performed during wakefulness and sleep. During wakefulness the purpose was to reveal any dysfunction in deglutition and speech as well as morphologic abnormalities. The purpose during sleep, which usually was induced by low-dose midazolam intravenously, was to reveal the site and form of obstruction in obstructive sleep apnea patients and the site of snoring in habitual snorers.", 
    "2": "The preoperative results of 104 patients are presented. In 57 patients who had apneas, the occurrence and type of apnea could be determined.", 
    "3": "A continuous recording over some minutes gave a rough estimate of the degree of SAS and mean duration of apnea. Although much information on SAS can be obtained by this method, it cannot replace polygraphic sleep recording in the investigation of habitual snorers and SAS patients. However, these 2 methods are complementary and can be performed simultaneously as polygraphic videoradiography.", 
    "4": "The efficacy of the diazepam loading dose method of treatment of delirium tremens was assessed in comparison with the traditional therapy. The experimental group and the control group comprised 51 and 45 patients respectively. The clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol (CIWA-A) scale was applied to assess the intensity of the symptoms. Diazepam doses in the experimental group oscillated from 40 to 210 mg (mean 86.9 +/- 47.2 mg). The control group was receiving diazepam and other psychotropic drugs in divided doses. In the experimental group deliric symptoms were present from 2 to 24 h (mean 6.9 +/- 4.8 h), and in the control group from 2 to 123 h (mean 33.8 +/- 25.7 h). The results show a large efficacy of the loading dose method corresponding to substantial reduction of the psychosis duration (fivefold in comparison to the control group). The method proved to be safe, with no significant complications.", 
    "5": "Fibromyalgia is a painful syndrome of non-articular origin, predominantly involving muscles, and the commonest cause of chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain. The diversity of therapeutic programs for patients with fibromyalgia reflects both the lack of a known pathophysiology for this disorder and the low efficacy of the current therapies. We studied the efficacy of tenoxicam and bromazepan in the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia. One hundred and sixty-four patients from our Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic fulfilling the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia, with widespread pain at study entry. Each of the 164 patients was randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups: double placebo (P), tenoxicam (20 mg) + placebo (T), bromazepan (3 mg) + placebo (B)m or tenoxicam (20 mg) + bromazepan 3 mg (TB). Patient global assessment of disease, pain, sleep quality, morning stiffness, and number of tender points were evaluated at baseline and 8 weeks afterwards. At the end of the trial, 17%, 10%, 12%, and 29% of the P, T, B, and TB patients, respectively, had clinical improvement. A statistically significant difference was found only between the T and TB groups. Our data indicate that treatment with tenoxicam + bromazepan can be effective for some patients with fibromyalgia, but the differences with the placebo group were neither clinically nor statistically significant.", 
    "6": "Benzodiazepine anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs are some of the most widely prescribed drugs in the Western world. Despite this fact, the mechanisms that underlie the development of tolerance to, and dependence upon, benzodiazepines are poorly understood. The aim of this review is to summarize and critically evaluate the experimental evidence relating to the chronic behavioural and neuronal effects of benzodiazepines. Behavioural studies in animals generally indicate that tolerance gradually develops to the muscle relaxant, ataxic, locomotor and anticonvulsant effects of benzodiazepines. The evidence relating to the development of tolerance to the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines is less clear. The literature on the possible mechanisms of benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence is large, highly complex and difficult to interpret. The effect of chronic benzodiazepine treatment varies enormously as a function of the benzodiazepine used and the treatment schedule employed. Many studies have demonstrated a down-regulation of benzodiazepine binding sites, although affinity is usually unchanged. The evidence relating to the number and affinity of GABAA binding sites is unclear. Some studies suggest that chronic benzodiazepine administration results in a reduction in the number of Cl- channels associated with the GABAA receptor complex, although it is not clear that the efficacy of the GABA binding site in operating the Cl- channel necessarily changes. There is, however, substantial evidence to support the hypothesis that chronic benzodiazepine treatment results in a reduction in the coupling between the GABAA and benzodiazepine binding sites (the \"functional uncoupling hypothesis\"). Although some electrophysiological studies suggest that chronic benzodiazepine treatment results in a subsensitivity to GABA, this effect seems to be highly area-specific.",

Sertindole and olanzapine are nearing release. Seroquel and ziprazidone are in the final stages of study. This generation of drugs will provide advantages in the area of lower motor side effects and probably in improved negative symptom treatment.", 
    "8": "The care of people with schizophrenia that has failed to respond to conventional antipsychotic medication remains a formidable challenge. However, the introduction of clozapine heralded a new optimism in this area, and prompted an increase in research interest in the pharmacotherapeutic options for such patients. This brief review covers some of the more recent studies with clozapine that are relevant to the use of the drug in clinical practice, and also summarises the potential indications, benefits and limitations of various adjuncts to antipsychotic drug treatment.", 
    "9": "The effect of the use of a number of popular solubility treatments was examined on alfaxolone- and diazepam-induced ataxia. The effects of diazepam were not significantly altered by solution in cyclodextrin, Alkamuls EL-620 or a mixture of propylene glycol and ethanol. The effects of alfaxolone were not altered by solution in Alkamuls EL-620, but were significantly lessened by solution in cyclodextrin. In a dose-response experiment, the ED50 of alfaxolone increased from 15.3 mg kg-1 (in Alkamuls EL-620) to 25.6 mg kg-1 (in hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin). The results suggest that although cyclodextrins are popular and effective solubilizers, their use must be considered carefully in the context of the experiments in which they are to be used.", 
    "10": "During the terminal phase of illness, many geriatric patients develop psychiatric complications that subsequently have profound effects on their quality of life. Effective treatment requires the skills of a physician who is experienced in the recognition, assessment, and management of psychiatric complications of terminal care. Specialized knowledge is required, because even the most common psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, and cognitive disorder) may be difficult to diagnose and treat. Recognition and management are complicated by the fact that these symptoms can arise as a consequence of other symptoms, for example, as a direct result of the disease and its treatment, or as a reflection of underlying psychosocial issues. In many instances, the use of pharmacologic agents, either alone or in combination with psychotherapeutic interventions, provides reasonable control of psychiatric symptoms. Here, too, specialized knowledge is required in order to know which regimens are likely to yield the most benefits with the least risk of toxicity. Fortunately, a considerable body of knowledge has accumulated over the last few years regarding the management of psychiatric symptoms in terminal care. The challenge for the future is to make sure that this information is applied in the routine clinical care of the terminally ill geriatric patient.", 
    "11": "In 370 opioid-dependent patients included consecutively in a low-threshold methadone maintenance program, the effect of different variables on the retention rate was assessed. The variables included the patients' age, sex, family situation, employment status, length of heroin use, current route of drug consumption, previous treatments, current consumption of cocaine, alcohol and benzodiazepines, needle sharing, HIV serostatus and methadone dose. The retention rate after 2 years of methadone maintenance was 72%. Dose of methadone > 80 mg/day, age > 30 years, living with family or stable partner and non-current use of alcohol were significant predictive variables for retention.", 
    "12": "Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) is a widely used surgical procedure for inducing focal cortical ischaemia in mice. In the present study, all experiments were performed on 4-week-old, male Swiss mice (OF-1 Iffa Credo, France), 20-25 g at the time of surgery. Sham-operated mice were subjected to simple exposure of the middle cerebral artery. Mice were injected with either MK-801, ifenprodil, JO 1784, JO 1994 or JO 1997 at the following time points after surgery; 5, 15, 45 min and 3, 6, 24, 30, 48 and 54 h. Mice were sacrificed 72 h after surgery and both ipsilateral and contralateral cortices were dissected in their entirety, weighed, and assayed for [3H]PK 11195 binding while the brain-stem and cerebellum were assayed for nitric oxide synthase (NO synthase) activity. In a separate experiment the area of ischaemic damage was determined planimetrically by means of an image analysis system. Coagulation of the middle cerebral artery induced a marked enhancement of the ipsilateral cortical omega 3 peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (PTBB'S) densities, an increase in NO synthase activity in the brain-stem and cerebellum, and an increase in the cortical infarct area. MK-801, ifenprodil, JO 1784, JO 1994 and JO 1997 demonstrated comparable neuroprotective effects on all three indices of cortical damage. A down-regulation of cortical omega 3 peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (PTBB'S) densities and a decrease in NOS activity occurred following pharmacological intervention. In contrast to JO 1784, JO 1994 and JO 1997 have a bimodal effect on omega 3 PTBB'S densities.", 
    "13": "Polysomnographic sleep patterns and melatonin secretion were investigated in 5 young (age 25.6 +/- 1.1 years) and 5 middle-aged (age 49.4 +/- 5.4 years) healthy male subjects after intravenous administration of 1 mg flunitrazepam and placebo in a randomized, double-blind and cross-over setting. The area under the curve (AUC) of total nocturnal melatonin plasma concentration decreased 23.3 +/- 11.5% in young subjects (P < or = 0.05) and 39.3 +/- 5.2% in middle-aged subjects (P < or = 0.05) after flunitrazepam infusion compared with placebo infusion. Differences in nocturnal peak values of melatonin were 5.4 +/- 22.0% in young subjects (not significant) and 34.0 +/- 14.7% in middle-aged subjects (p < or = 0.05). Flunitrazepam significantly (P < or = 0.05) improved sleep latency and the number of sleep stage changes in the group of all subjects. These results show that, although the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam improves sleep, it reduces the nocturnal secretion of melatonin, and therefore alters the circadian rhythm of a hormone which is supposed to play a special role in circadian sleep-wake rhythmicity.", 
    "14": "Using [3H]flumazenil as a probe we investigated how benzodiazepine site pharmacology of alpha beta gamma ternary combinations of GABAA receptors can be influenced upon expression of different isoforms of alpha, beta and gamma subunits. The nature of the beta subunit did not alter the pharmacology of this site in that the affinities of alpha 5-containing GABAA receptors for various benzodiazepine modulatory ligands were essentially unchanged upon a comparison of different beta-variant forms (alpha 5 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2). In contrast, both alpha and gamma variants contributed to notable differences in benzodiazepine site pharmacology. Thus alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors showed high, intermediate and low affinities for zolpidem, respectively. Exchanging gamma 2 for gamma 3 reduced the affinities of alpha 1 beta 2 gamma and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma receptors for zolpidem by factors of > 150 and > 5.8, respectively. The alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 3, alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 3 and alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 3 receptors exhibited, in contrast, higher affinity for CL218872 than their corresponding gamma 2 receptors. The information on these different recombinant GABAA receptor pharmacological profiles should help in the elucidation of native GABAA receptor subtype diversity.", 
    "15": "This study was performed to test the hypothesis that nitrous oxide augments the effects of diazepam sedation of young children by reducing crying and movement and improving the overall quality of sedation. Twenty-four children (mean age of 32 months) were sedated on two occasions with two different treatment regimens. All subjects received a standard oral dose of 0.5 mg/kg of diazepam with and without nitrous oxide during each of two treatment visits. During one visit, the subjects received 50% nitrous oxide and 50% oxygen for the first 20 min followed by 100% oxygen for the balance of the procedure and, during the second visit, the reverse regimen was used. All subjects were restrained in a Papoose Board (Olympic Medical, Seattle, WA) with an auxiliary head restraint. Successful sedation, as evidenced by lack of crying or movement that interrupted treatment, occurred in 83% of administrations. Vital signs remained essentially unchanged throughout all treatment with the exception of transitory elevation of the pulse and respiratory rates, which usually occurred when the mouth prop was inserted, local anesthesia was administered, and the rubber dam was placed. When the evaluation of the overall sedation was compared with and without nitrous oxide, it was better with nitrous oxide 56% of the time, worse 13% of the time, and the same in the remaining 31% of the comparisons. It is concluded that nitrous oxide may slightly augment the effect of diazepam sedation of young children, but it does not do so uniformly for all children receiving sedation.", 
    "16": "The aim of the present study was to clarify whether cognitive impairments caused by benzodiazepines (BDZs) are a consequence of their specific direct effects on cognitive function or whether they are explained as secondary effects of increased sleepiness. Ten healthy men (mean age, 33.9 years) participated in two experimental sessions in a randomized cross-over, double-blind study: in one session subjects were given a placebo and in the other they were given 0.125 mg triazolam (TRZ). Each experimental session was conducted on 1 day. After a pre-drug EEG recording and an event-related potential (ERP) recording, under an oddball paradigm, subjects took the TRZ or placebo orally at 1000 hours. Thereafter, EEG and ERP recording sessions, following the same procedure as the pre-drug sessions, were conducted at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug administration. The EEG and ERP recordings from Cz and Pz referred to the bilaterally linked ear electrodes were used. We found that P300 latency was significantly prolonged in TRZ condition at 2 h (Pz) and 4 h (Cz and Pz) after TRZ, and that the P300 amplitude was significantly reduced at 2 h (Cz and Pz) and 4 h (Pz) after TRZ, compared to the same times after placebo. The absolute power values for the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha 1 (8-9 Hz), and alpha 2 (10-12 Hz) bands did not differ at any measurement time between the treatments. Only the beta band (13-19 Hz) power value was significantly elevated after the TRZ administration (versus placebo). No significant sedative effects were detected in subjective measurements. These results indicate that a single oral dose of 0.125 mg TRZ caused cortical changes without distinct general sedation or subjective sleepiness.", 
    "17": "Seizures are the most common serious complication of flumazenil usage in adults. We report a prolonged seizure in an 11-month-old child that occurred immediately after the administration of 0.3 mg of flumazenil. Precautions recommended for the administration of flumazenil in adults should also be used in pediatric patients.", 
    "18": "The in vivo release of cholecystokinin (CCK)-like material (CCKLM) was measured in the frontal cortex of freely moving rats using the microdialysis technique combined with a sensitive radioimmunoassay. Local perfusion of K+ (100 mM)-enriched artificial CSF resulted in a 10-fold increase in CCKLM outflow, as compared with that occurring under basal resting (K+ = 3.0 mM) conditions, and this effect could be completely prevented by removal of Ca2+ in the perfusing fluid. Chromatographic analyses demonstrated that CCK-8S contributed to 70% of CCKLM. Stressful stimuli such as a 2-min exposure to diethyl ether and a 30-min restraint produced a marked but transient increase in cortical CCKLM release. In addition, anxiety-like behavior induced by the systemic administration of yohimbine (5 mg/kg i.p.) was associated with a long-lasting enhancement in the peptide outflow. Pretreatment with the potent anxiolytic drug diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p., 5 min before each condition), which exerted no effect on its own, completely prevented CCKLM overflow due to diethyl ether, restraint, or yohimbine administration. In contrast, neither the systemic injection (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) nor the local application (100 microM through the microdialysis probe) of the serotonin 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron affected the increased release of CCKLM in rats restrained for 30 min or treated with yohimbine. These results indicate that cortical CCKergic neurotransmission is increased during stress or anxiety-like behavior in rats. Prevention of this effect by diazepam suggests that an inhibitory influence of benzodiazepines on cortical CCKergic neurons might participate in the anxiolytic action of these drugs.", 
    "19": "Systemic administration of the anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 has been shown to increase selectively dopamine utilization in the medial prefrontal cortex and the shell, but not core, subregion of the nucleus accumbens. In the present study, we examined the functional interaction between benzodiazepine and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor influences on dopamine utilization in these areas. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with the glycine receptor antagonist (+)-HA 966 (15 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline 15 min before FG 7142 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle administration. Subjects were killed 30 min later and assayed for tissue concentrations of dopamine and its major metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid in the core and shell subdivisions of the nucleus accumbens and the media prefrontal cortex. (+)-HA 966 administration blocked FG 7142-induced increased dopamine utilization in both the medial prefrontal cortex and the shell subdivision of the nucleus accumbens. Results are discussed in terms of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor influences on the response of mesoaccumbal dopamine neurons to stress.", 
    "20": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor cDNAs encoding the alpha 6 subunit homologues from chicken and goldfish have been cloned and sequenced. These proteins exhibit 83 and 75% identity, respectively, to the rat alpha 6 polypeptide. In situ hybridization has demonstrated that, as in mammals, the avian and teleost fish alpha 6 subunit genes are predominantly expressed in cerebellar granule cells. Correspondingly, flunitrazepam-non-displaceable binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 (a benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist), which is a major characteristic of gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptors that contain the alpha 6 polypeptide, is also mainly found for cerebellar granule cells of fish and chick. The conservation of this expression pattern suggests that gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors possessing the alpha 6 subunit are of fundamental importance for cerebellar function and that the corresponding gene regulatory elements, e.g., granule cell-specific enhancers, have also been conserved.", 
    "21": "Headbanging is a rhythmic movement disorder (RMD) along with headrolling, bodyrocking and bodyrolling. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders defines RMD as a group of stereotyped, repetitive movements involving large muscles, usually of the head and neck, that typically occur immediately prior to sleep onset and are sustained into light sleep. The average onset is 9 months, and by 10 years of age the majority of subjects no longer complain of headbanging. If it continues, it is usually associated with mental retardation of autism. Headbanging is said to occur during presleep drowsiness or early non-rapid eye movement sleep. Often there is no need for treatment other than reassurance. Behavior modification has had little success. Benzodiazepines (such as oxazepam and diazepam) and tricyclic antidepressants have been used with variable success. We present two cases of headbanging with polysomnographic findings and treatment. The patients are two healthy adult males. They both experienced significant daytime somnolence and repeatedly wakened their partners. Only one of our patients had recorded head movements during his overnight sleep study. There was evidence of headbanging during stage 1 and stage 2 sleep but also during slow wave sleep. Headbanging was recorded during 14% of the epochs. Both patients responded to treatment with clonazepam (at a dose of 1.0 mg nightly) with decreased frequency and severity of headbanging. Although headbanging is most common in childhood, there may be significant number of cases that persist into adulthood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the treatment of headbanging with clonazepam. Both patients benefited from this treatment.", 
    "22": "A higher anxiolytic and hypnotic consumption has been evidenced in France by recent international and national surveys. In an effort to counteract this pattern French Health authorities have enforced limitation to the prescription of these drugs. Understanding the causes of this overuse needs a careful analysis of the pattern of use of this medicine but also of the associated morbidity factors. In the last ten years several studies have attempted to address these issues. In the general population there were 25 to 30% of occasional or regular users with between 5 and 7% chronic users making french anxiolytic users two to three time superior to most industrialised countries. This high level of consumption is not the privilege of anxiolytic since the same pattern of use is observed for all medicine. Studies in primary care, in medical inpatients and psychiatric inpatients show as expected that anxiolytic use increase with the psychiatric morbidity and also with somatic disorder. The main risk factors for anxiolytic use are female sex, old age and psychic and somatic morbidity. Age seems to play a major role in subjects over 65: 17% are chronic users. Multiple factors might play a role in benzodiazepine use as medical care system, physician type of practice, cultural specific aspects but no proper simple explanation is available to explain the mechanism of the french high anxiolytic use. Given the poor global recognition of mental disorder observed in most countries it is suggested to privilege primary care physician training in psychiatry to optimize psychotropic drug use.", 
    "23": "The effect of benzodiazepine (BZP) on experimental allergic conjunctivitis was studied. Male Hartley guinea pigs were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) and then homologous anti-OVA serum was injected intravenously into guinea pigs for passive sensitization. BZP was administered at a dose of 5 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) according to the following schedule respectively; a single, repeated twice a day for 3 days, repeated twice a day for 3 days plus a single and repeated twice a day for 7 days. OVA challenge was performed to the conjunctiva, 20 minutes later, conjunctival edema during the early phase response (EPR) was observed and again at 6 hours later, both eosinophil infiltration into the conjunctiva and the platelet activating factor (PAF) serum level during the late phase response (LPR) were examined. BZP did not inhibit the development of conjunctival edema during the EPR. A single dose of BZP did not inhibit, but repeated doses of BZP for 3 or 7 days significantly suppressed eosinophil infiltration during the LPR. And after repeated doses of BZP for 7 days, all PAF serum levels during the LPR were under the lower detection limit of the assay. These results suggest that BZP has an inhibitory effect on antigen-induced eosinophil infiltration into the conjunctiva during the LPR.",

    "25": "Sixty unpremedicated, ASA physical status I or II male patients, aged 45-65 years and scheduled for elective lower abdominal, pelvic, or lower limb surgery participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The study population was composed of three groups: Before administration of midazolam, patients in the first group received an intramuscular injection of 15 mL saline (M), those in the second group an intramuscular injection of 15 mL 0.5% bupivacaine (MIB), and those in the third group an epidural injection of 15 mL 0.5% bupivacaine at the L3-L4 level (MEB). Loss of the ability to respond to verbal command was used as an endpoint for the effect of midazolam injected intravenously in predetermined doses (five patients per dose) 30 minutes after a bupivacaine (or saline) injection. Midazolam dose-response curves were obtained by probit analysis.", 
    "26": "The midazolam median effective dose values for the hypnotic effect were 0.20 mg/kg (95% confidence limit, 0.10-0.27 mg/kg) in the M group; 0.10 mg/kg (0.06-0.22 mg/kg) in the MIB group; and 0.04 mg/kg (0.03-0.07 mg/kg) in the MEB group. The differences between the midazolam median effective dose values had high levels of significance: P < .00001 for MEB versus M, P < .002 for MEB versus MIB, and P < .01 for MIB versus M.", 
    "27": "Epidural bupivacaine block profoundly decreases midazolam hypnotic requirements. The most likely explanation for this effect is the reduction in afferent input induced by the block.", 
    "28": "We studied effects of anxiogenic and anxiolytic compounds on the electric self-stimulation of the medial fore-brain bundle in male rats to find out if there is a link between reward and anxiety-related behaviours. The cholecystokinin agonist, caerulein (25-100 micrograms/kg) and the 5-HT agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (0.2-1 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited the electric self-stimulation. The 5-HT2A antagonist, ketanserin, at 2.5 mg/kg, increased the self-stimulation at high currents but not at threshold current. The 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron (10 and 100 micrograms/kg). The alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, prazosin (0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg), the beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol (5 and 10 mg/kg) and the alpha 2-adreno-receptor antagonist, atipamezole (4 mg/kg), did not affect the self-stimulation. Nor did the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam (5-15 mg/kg), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (at 10 and 25 mg/kg) or the inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (10 and 20 mg/kg), cause any substantial changes of the self-stimulation. We conclude that only two anxiolytic drugs (caerulein and 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine) suppress the electric self-stimulation. These findings indicate that anxiogenicity as such is not able to weaken the hypothalamic electric self-stimulation. Anxiety and reward are apparently mediated through separate neural pathways.", 
    "29": "1. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is released during stress both in limbic and hypothalamic areas suggesting that CCK could participate in modulating neuroendocrine as well as behavioural responses to stress. 2. In this study we have examined the effect of CCK receptor antagonists on the retention of the immobility response to a forced-swim stress in rats. In this test, rats are forced to swim during 15 min (conditioning period) and 24 h later, the duration of immobility is measured during a period of 5 min (re-test period). During the conditioning period rats display a period of vigorous activity, followed by progressive inactivity. During the re-test period rats remain 70-80% of the time in an immobile posture. 3. The CCKA receptor antagonist, devazepide (MK-329) but not the CCKB receptor antagonist, L-365,260, administered s.c. immediately before the conditioning period, decreased the duration of acquired immobility during the re-test period. The effect of devazepide was prevented by cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8; 40 micrograms kg-1, s.c) as well as by the selective glucocorticosteroid GII receptor agonist, dexamethasone (30 micrograms kg-1, s.c.) 4. Neither corticosterone nor ACTH plasma levels measured both after the re-test period and after the conditioning period were modified by devazepide treatment. 5. The results suggest a role for CCK in the behavioural adaptation to stress and indicate a relationship between CCK systems and glucocorticoids in the neuronal mechanisms involved in the acquisition of adaptive behaviours to stress.", 
    "30": "Oro-caecal transit times (OCTTs) were assessed in 10 healthy adult cats by the lactulose breath hydrogen method with either no sedation (group A), or after the intramuscular administration of three sedative regimens: a combination of acetylpromazine at 0.1 mg kg-1 with buprenorphine at 10 micrograms kg-1 (group B), ketamine at 5 mg kg-1 with midazolam at 0.1 mg kg-1 (group C), or medetomidine at 50 micrograms kg-1 (group D). For each test, the OCTT was defined by four methods: a visual assessment, the first maintained 4 ppm increase in hydrogen production, and the first maintained 0.5 ml hr-1 increase in hydrogen production assessed by two cumulative sum methods. Depending on the definition, the median OCTTs of the cats were between 113 and 131.5 minutes in group A, 86.5 and 97.5 minutes in group B, 218 and 235.5 minutes in group C and 86.5 and 97.5 minutes in group D. By two of the definitions, the median OCTTs in group C were significantly longer than in group A (P < or = 0.037) and approached significance by the other two definitions. The use of sedatives significantly increased the inter-individual variability of the OCTTs, particularly in groups C and D. There were significant differences between the median OCTTs defined by the four different methods, but all the methods were very highly and significantly correlated (rs < or = 0.9503, P < 0.0001).", 
    "31": "We investigated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and associated parkinsonic (SEPS) and dyskinetic (AIMS) movements in 32 hospital admitted acute catatonic patients. Thirty-two (N = 24 without neuroleptics on admission) catatonic patients were compared with 32 non-catatonic dyskinetic psychiatric patients, 32 non-catatonic non-dyskinetic psychiatric patients and 32 healthy controls. CPK was significantly higher (P = 0.015) in catatonics (mean 255.75, S.D. +/- 226.54) than in healthy controls (38.6, +/- 27.4) and non-catatonic non-dyskinetic psychiatric patients (57.1, +/- 120.8) whereas there was no significant difference between catatonics and non-catatonic dyskinetic psychiatric patients (453.4, +/- 128.5). There were significantly positive correlations between CPK and AIMS, as well as significantly negative correlations between CPK and SEPS, in all three groups. Our results suggest that increased serum CPK in catatonia may be related to occurrence of dyskinetic movements. Furthermore, we were able to distinguish a parkinsonic (low CPK, low AIMS, high SEPS) and a dyskinetic (high CPK, high AIMS, low SEPS) subtype in catatonia.", 
    "32": "The proportional odds model is illustrated in the analysis of two efficacy scales used in a phase II clinical trial involving 81 schizophrenic patients. The proportional odds model preserves the discrete, ordinal nature of one of the scales. The analysis of this data suggested that the relationship between the two scales is not captured by a linear proportional odds model. A linear model and a piecewise linear model for the explanatory variable were therefore compared using likelihood-based analyses. Residuals from both models were compared. Predicted probabilities for the ordinal categories were constructed from the estimated model. Extensions and limitations of the model for interpretation of other trials and for the planning of future trials are discussed.", 
    "33": "In the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) paradigm in mice, both a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam, and a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, flesinoxan, reduced the stress-induced increase in rectal temperature. The SIH procedure itself enhanced plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels but not plasma glucose levels. Diazepam (3, 6, and 12 mg/kg p.o.) did neither affect basal plasma ACTH, corticosterone, or glucose levels, nor did it suppress the stress-induced rises in these parameters. Flesinoxan (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg p.o.) enhanced plasma ACTH and corticosterone concentrations under nonstress conditions but did not affect the stress-induced increases in ACTH and corticosterone secretion. No clear effects of flesinoxan on plasma glucose levels were found. Our results indicate that in mice the anxiolytic effects of diazepam and flesinoxan in the SIH paradigm are not paralleled by a blockade of stress-induced increases in plasma ACTH, corticosterone, and glucose levels.", 
    "34": "We studied the effects of an acute dose of (-)-nicotine (1 mg/kg) on Fos-like immunostaining (IS) in rat brain areas. Nicotine increased Fos IS significantly in the medial terminal nucleus of accessory optic tract (MT), and tended to increase it in the interpeduncular nucleus (i.p.), as well as in the stress-related areas, the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN) and the supraoptic nucleus (SON). Previously nicotine was reported to increase Fos IS also in another stress-related area, the central nucleus of amygdala (ACe). This led us to study the interaction of nicotine with diazepam (10 mg/kg). Diazepam alone increased Fos IS in PVN and in SON as well as in ACe. In diazepam- and nicotine-treated rats Fos IS was increased in PVN and SON as well as in MT and i.p.. In MT and i.p. of diazepam and nicotine-treated rats Fos IS was similar to that induced by nicotine alone, and in PVN and SON of these rats Fos IS in ACe. Taken together, diazepam induced Fos IS in all stress-related areas studied (PVN, SON, ACe), but not in central visual structures, where nicotine induces Fos IS (MT, i.p.). No significant interactions on Fos expression were found between acute effects of diazepam and nicotine suggesting that these drugs activate different sets of neurons within the stress-related brain areas.", 
    "35": "Lactating mice respond differentially to intruders of differing sex, displaying defensive attack against the male and offensive attack against the female. Such a phenotypic dichotomy appears to have adaptive value in that unfamiliar males pose a much greater threat to the offspring than do females. The present study examined the effects of the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP) (2.5-10.0 mg/kg) on this differential response pattern in aggression-naive (nonscreened) (NS) and aggression-experienced (screened) (S) lactating female mice (Mus musculus domesticus) confronting intruders of either sex in a 10-min test. This procedure was used to evaluate the influence of both the type of opponent and previous aggressive experience on basal behavioural profiles and drug action. Results showed that both intruder sex and prior screening for attack modulated the behaviour of lactating females toward intruders. In turn, both variables strongly influenced CDP effects on maternal aggression. In particular, in S dams, CDP dose-dependently increased maternal attack against males but decreased attack against female intruders. Conversely, in NS dams, CDP decreased attack (and fear) against males but did not affect it against females. In both S and NS conditions, CDP modified the attack strategy of lactating females against the male, switching it from a defensive to an offensive pattern. Exploration, social investigation, eating, and immobility were differentially affected by the drug treatment, depending on screening and/or intruder sex condition. These differential effects of CDP between S and NS conditions, toward either male or female intruders, cannot be fully explained by differences in the baseline levels of these behaviours. Alternative hypotheses are discussed. These findings demonstrate that the effects of CDP on maternal attack behaviour depend on not only the drug but also the object of attack, and hence the function of attack and the prior experience of the attacker.", 
    "36": "Preference for immediate reward, taken as an index of impulsiveness, has been suggested to be under the preferential control of central serotonin (5-HT) function. The present study examined the effects of the acute administration of drugs which directly or indirectly alter 5-HT transmission on tolerance to delay of reward in rats subjected to a procedure of discrete-trial choice in an operant chamber. Different groups of rats were trained to choose between two levers giving access to reinforcers differing in both magnitude and delay: one food pellet, delayed by 0 or 5 s, vs. five pellets delivered after a prereinforcer interval fixed at either 15, 30, 45, or 60 s, depending on the experiments. The learning curves indicated that rats were able to adjust their choice strategy precisely according to various factors: the respective duration of the delays before the small and large rewards, the immediacy of the small reward delivery, and the lengthening of the trials by a postreinforcer delay (or intertrial interval). Whatever the experimental parameters and stage of the learning, an acute administration of drugs able to reduce 5-HT neuronal activity (benzodiazepines; 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists: buspirone and MDL 73005EF) or enhance 5-HT transmission (5-HT reuptake inhibitors: indalpine and zimelidine; 5-HT1A receptor full agonist: 8-OH-DPAT) failed significantly to alter choice strategy (decreased or increased preference for the large but delayed reward, respectively), as they did in other situations such as a T-maze procedure. Only d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg), on one occasion, significantly reduced preference for the larger reward. The choice strategy was also insensitive to acute changes in experimental parameters such as a reduction in delay or increase in the magnitude of the large reinforcement. These results indicate that the present operant paradigm is not sensitive to acute modifications in the internal state of the animals and in the reward contingencies, and therefore is not useful to evaluate tolerance to delay and variations in impulsiveness in rats.", 
    "37": "There are conflicting results on the function of 5-HT in anxiety and depression. To reconcile this evidence, Deakin and Graeff have suggested that the ascending 5-HT pathway that originates in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and innervates the amygdala and frontal cortex facilitates conditioned fear, while the DRN-periventricular pathway innervating the periventricular and periaqueductal gray matter inhibits inborn fight/flight reactions to impending danger, pain, or asphyxia. To study the role of the DRN 5-HT system in anxiety, we microinjected 8-OH-DPAT into the DRN to inhibit 5-HT release. This treatment impaired inhibitory avoidance (conditioned fear) without affecting one-way escape (unconditioned fear) in the elevated T-maze, a new animal model of anxiety. We also applied three drug treatments that increase 5-HT release from DRN terminals: 1) intra-DRN microinjection of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 4172, 2) intra-DRN microinjection of the excitatory amino acid kainic acid, and 3) intraperitoneal injection of the 5-HT releaser and uptake blocker D-fenfluramine. All treatments enhanced inhibitory avoidance in T-maze. D-Fenfluramine and intra-DRN kainate also decreased one-way escape. In healthy volunteers, D-fenfluramine and the 5-HT agonist mCPP (mainly 5-HT2C) increased, while the antagonists ritanserin (5-HT2A/2C) and SR 46349B (5-HT2A) decreased skin conductance responses to an aversively conditioned stimulus (tone). In addition, D-fenfluramine decreased, whereas ritanserin increased subjective anxiety induced by simulated public speaking, thought to represent unconditioned anxiety. Overall, these results are compatible with the above hypothesis. Deakin and Graeff have suggested that the pathway connecting the median raphe nucleus (MRN) to the dorsal hippocampus promotes resistance to chronic, unavoidable stress. In the present study, we found that 24 h after electrolytic lesion of the rat MRN glandular gastric ulcers occurred, and the immune response to the mitogen concanavalin A was depressed. Seven days after the same lesion, the ulcerogenic effect of restraint was enhanced. Microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT, the nonselective agonist 5-MeO-DMT, or the 5-HT uptake inhibitor zimelidine into the dorsal hippocampus immediately after 2 h of restraint reversed the deficits of open arm exploration in the elevated plus-maze, measured 24 h after restraint. The effect of the two last drugs was antagonized by WAY-100135, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that the MRN-dorsal hippocampus 5-HT system attenuates stress by facilitation of hippocampal 5-HT1A-mediated neurotransmission. Clinical implications of these results are discussed, especially with regard to panic disorder and depression.", 
    "38": "We have previously found that quail selectively bred to exhibit long (LTI) or short (STI) tonic immobility responses to manual restraint differed with respect to the affinity of binding at the diazepam-sensitive benzodiazepine binding site. In the current study, binding at other components of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex was investigated. Whereas the lines did not differ in either number or affinity of GABAA receptors, we found that GABA caused significantly greater enhancement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the forebrains of LTI than in STI birds. There was also significantly higher binding to the diazepam-insensitive component (alcohol binding site) of the GABAA-benzodiazepine complex in the forebrain of the LTI line. It is not known, however, whether this difference in the lines is due to differences in number or affinity of these sites. It is discussed whether these manifold differences between the lines in binding at the forebrain sites of the GABAA-benzodiazepine complex could be founded on subunit differences, and whether differences in benzodiazepine binding could underlie the genetically determined behavioural differences in tonic immobility.", 
    "39": "Habituation of the acoustic startle response (ASR) and freezing responses were assessed simultaneously in rats of different ages. Results showed that until 30 days of age rats were not able to express long-term habituation of the ASR, whereas irrespective of age, all rats exhibited the increased freezing responses as a result of fear conditioning. In addition, the interaction between fear and memory was studied using the same behavioral model in adult rats treated intraperitoneally with diazepam at doses 1.2 and 2.5 mg/kg. Diazepam administration did not result in a significant change in initial startle responsiveness but elicited a profound suppression of startle amplitude over trials. Furthermore, animals given diazepam showed more initial freezing than the vehicle-treated controls, while fear-conditioned freezing was decreased by diazepam. The pattern of results is discussed in relation to developmental and pharmacological dissociations between the different behavioral components of responses to aversive and stressful cues.", 
    "40": "In the first experiment male chicks were exposed to neutral and cat odours at days 4, 7, or 10 after hatching. Of the chicks tested at day 4, few made contact with either odour cloth, but those tested at day 7 made fewer contacts with the cat odour cloth, compared with the neutral odour, spent less time in contact with it, and spent more time in the zone furthest from the cloth. These clear differences were not seen in the group tested at day 10. In a second experiment, the behaviour of day 7 male chicks was compared in the presence of neutral, disinfectant, chick blood or cat odours, and the most extreme differences were between neutral and cat odours. In a third experiment, both male and female chicks were exposed to cat odour at day 7 and both showed similar avoidance. After exposure to cat odour both sexes showed significantly reduced GABA enhancement of benzodiazepine binding; which is a change associated with increased fear. However, after exposure to cat odour, they also showed significant decreases in 5-HT availability evidenced by lower basal and K(+)-evoked [3H]-5-HT release and, in the male chicks only, by an increased [3H]-5-HT uptake from archistriatal slices. These changes in 5-HT function are in the direction associated with reduced fear and would, therefore, seem to be adaptive and compensatory in function. Neither male nor female chicks showed any differences in [14C]-GABA release or uptake as a result of exposure to cat odour. Although the pattern of response to cat odour was the same in both male and female chicks at day 7, there were significant sex differences in 5-HT and GABA tone and benzodiazepine binding; these sex differences were also found in day 10 chicks. The importance of these for sex differences in trait anxiety is discussed.", 
    "41": "Benzodiazepines and the novel anxiolytic buspirone share a common capacity to relieve clinical anxiety but do not share any side effects. Anxiety releases stress hormones and, at moderate doses, anxiolytic benzodiazepines block this release. It is interesting, therefore, that buspirone and other 5-HT1A agonists release stress hormones at moderate doses. Both the U-shaped dose-response curve seen with buspirone in some animal tests of anxiety and its slow onset of clinical action could be attributed to this release of stress hormones. Metyrapone (200 mg/kg), an inhibitor of 11-beta-hydroxylase, was used in the present experiments as a form of chemical adrenalectomy and was combined with administration of corticosterone (1 mg) to produce rats with presumed approximately normal corticosterone levels but no capacity to release endogenous corticosterone. This treatment reduced the difference normally observed in the effects of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg) and buspirone (0.37 mg/kg) on a fixed interval schedule particularly in the early part of the interval when release of behavioral inhibition would be expected to contribute most to the effects. These results are consistent with the previous suggestion of Johnston and File (8) that the anxiolytic action of buspirone may be counteracted by activation of the pituitary-adrenal axis. Corticosterone appears to be the most likely critical agent for this antagonist action in the present experiments, although CRF and ACTH are also possibilities. It is likely that there is a mutual functional opposition between endogenous anxiolytic factors and stress hormones.", 
    "42": "In Experiment 1, rats were tested in a plus-maze, with or without small ledges on the open arms, after injection with vehicle or chlordiazepoxide (7.5 mg/kg). They were scored either on their first or second exposure to the maze; those scored on trail 2 had received a 5-min undrugged exposure to the maze 24 h earlier. This dose of chlordiazepoxide had a significant anxiolytic effect on trial 1 only in the maze without ledges, and on trial 2 only in the maze with ledges; thus, the presence of ledges differentially affected anxiolytic sensitivity on trials 1 and 2. The results of a factor analysis study (Experiment 2) confirmed that ledges had a differential effect when rats were repeatedly exposed to the maze. Thus, in the maze without ledges, the scores reflecting anxiolytic activity on trial 1 loaded on one factor, whereas the scores from trials 2 and 3 loaded on another independent factor. In the maze with ledges, the scores reflecting anxiolytic activity on trials 1, 2, and 3 loaded on three independent factors. Considering the published evidence and the results of the present study, we suggest that both types of plus-maze may be measuring the same type of anxiety with different sensitivities on trial 1 (e.g., generalised anxiety or fear of open spaces); different types of anxiety on trial 2 (without ledges--phobia/fear of heights; with ledges--not known), and trial 3 in the maze with ledges, yet another type of anxiety. The factor analysis results are also presented for ethological measures on the plus-maze, and for activity and exploration in the holeboard. Based on the factor loadings, a composite measure of anxiety on trial 1 is presented which will increase the sensitivity of the plus-maze to anxiolytic treatments. The measures of motor activity in the plus-maze load on a different factor from those derived from the holeboard, thus cautioning against considering all measures of motor activity as interchangeable.", 
    "43": "Despite or possibly by virtue of the fact that it is one of the most commonly used animal models of anxiety the Elevated Plus-Maze (EPM) results in a wide range of, often contradictory, results following pharmacological experiments. The responses from a questionnaire distributed to 65 groups that have published studies using the EPM in the past 3 years has, along with reference to published reports, enabled some conclusions regarding the influencing factors to be drawn. Some evidence for differential sensitivities between strains exists, with albino rats being more sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and 5-HT1A receptor agonists than pigmented animals. Most important, however, is the manipulation of the animals prior to testing and the aversiveness of the test conditions themselves. Stressing animals before testing (e.g., by moving from holding to test room) or using more aversive test conditions (e.g., elevated light levels) increases sensitivity to potential anxiolytics. Animals that are habituated to gentle handling or tested in less aversive conditions (e.g., EPM with ledges) show reduced likelihood of anxiolytic responses with administration of 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT1A agonists, and benzodiazepines.", 
    "44": "Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is difficult to diagnose during life, with up to 80% of cases being missed by routine neurological evaluation in both alcoholics and AIDS patients. Therefore, there is a need for noninvasive diagnostic procedures. Using the pyrithiamine-treated rat, an animal model of WE, we have studied, using radioligands for central (neuronal) and \"peripheral-type\" (glial) benzodiazepine receptors, the regional distribution of changes in the densities of these receptors in relation to the degree of reactive gliosis accompanying neuronal loss. Histological studies revealed neuronal loss in selective regions, including the thalamus, inferior colliculus, inferior olivary nucleus, and mammillary body. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated increases in densities of [3H]PK11195 binding sites that closely paralleled the topographic distribution of neuronal cell loss and reactive gliosis. In contrast, [3H]Ro15-178 showed poor spatial correlation, with the neuronal loss seen in pyrithiamine-induced thiamine deficiency. The positron emission tomography ligand [11C]PK11195 may be useful for the assessment of thiamine deficiency-induced brain damage in human alcoholics.", 
    "45": "The long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) selected lines of mice show highly significant differences in sleep-time for many sedative-hypnotic drugs, and the quantitative genetic nature of these differences has been well-established. Using an interval-mapping approach, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of LSXSS recombinant inbred (RI) strains have been applied to sleep-time responses for various classes of sedative-hypnotic drugs: alcohols (ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol), the atypical anesthetic chloral hydrate, barbiturates (pentobarbital and secobarbital), and benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide and flurazepam). Several provisional QTLs were mapped to similar locations within and between drug classes, suggesting that some common loci are involved in sleep-times elicited by these drugs. Consistent with correlations of strain mean sleep-times between drugs tested in the LSXSS recombinant inbred strains, the number of provisional QTLs mapping to the locations of highest significance for ethanol decreases when the lipid solubility of a particular drug becomes less similar to that of ethanol. Provisional QTLs mapped for the benzodiazepines, however, revealed considerable overlap with those mapped for ethanol, although these drugs represented the most lipid-soluble category of sedative-hypnotics tested. Provisional QTLs for pentobarbital and secobarbital differed from most of those mapped for the alcohols, which supports the hypothesis that alcohols and barbiturates exert their effects mainly through different biological mechanisms in the LS and SS lines. Blood ethanol concentrations at regaining the righting reflex also mapped to several provisional QTLs corresponding to ethanol-induced sleep-times that support the contention that sleep-time is a reasonable index of the observed differences in central nervous system sensitivities to ethanol between LS and SS mice.", 
    "46": "The influence of hypothyroidism (HO) induced by treatment with propylthiouracil on lipid composition, receptor responsiveness of M1-muscarinic receptors (M1AChRs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) as well as on protein kinase C (PKC) activity was investigated in the cerebral cortex of Lewis rats. HO did not influence the lipid composition. There was a significant 2-fold increase of efficacy and 6-fold decrease of potency of carbachol-induced inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in HO, with respect to control rats. The efficacy of trans-(1S,3R)-1-amino-1,3-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid (ACPD)-induced IP accumulation was also higher in HO (by 50%), without differences in EC50 values. The activities of soluble calcium-dependent and calcium-independent PKC were higher in HO than in control rats (both roughly 30%); membrane-associated PKCs were not modified. The data indicate that HO induces an increased responsiveness of M1AChRs and mGluRs and a rise in the soluble PKC activity that could be available and ready for translocation.",

Hospital in-patients who fulfilled DSM-111-R criteria for schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorders were eligible for entry into the study (n = 15). Patients who were on other antipsychotics had a washout period of 1 week before they were started on the drug. A fixed dose of risperidone was administered (6 mg). The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Negative Symptom Rating Scale (NSRS) and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale were used to measure psychopathology and extrapyramidal side-effects. Five patients dropped out of the study. Two patients became very agitated and potentially aggressive, one patient became very restless and did not respond to benzodiazepines, and one dropped out because of restlessness that did not respond to clonazepam. Of the 10 patients who completed the study, 50 per cent reduction on BPRS and NSRS was achieved by five and six patients respectively. There was a marginally significant trend towards a greater reduction in the magnitude of negative symptoms. Four patients required treatment with anticholinergic drugs. Risperidone was effective in resistent psychotic patients, but agitated and impulsive psychotic patients with positive symptoms may not be best candidates for treatment with risperidone. On average, negative symptoms respond better than positive symptoms.", 
    "56": "The effect of ovarian steroids on the benzodiazepine receptor was assessed in the elevated plus-maze and, after restraint stress, in benzodiazepine receptor binding assays. Vehicle-treated proestrous rats displayed anxiolytic behavior, relative to diestrus or estrous rats. Anxiolytic behavior was observed after 1 or 2 mg/kg diazepam in diestrus and estrus. However, whereas 4 mg/kg increased open arm exploration in diestrus, a decrease in the same measure was found at estrus. At proestrus, a decrease in anxiolytic behavior was observed after 2 and 4 mg/kg. In ovariectomized vehicle-treated rats, restraint stress increased NaCl-induced potentiation of 3H-flunitrazepam binding in cortical and cerebellar, but not in hippocampal membranes. Estradiol benzoate (2 micrograms) prevented the potentiation of flunitrazepam binding by NaCl in nonstressed and stressed animals, whereas progesterone (0.5 mg) increased the NaCl-induced potentiation of flunitrazepam binding in both nonstressed and stressed animals. Combined estradiol benzoate and progesterone treatment produced effects that were intermediate to those seen after injection of either steroid alone. The potentiation of flunitrazepam binding by NaCl observed in vehicle-treated stressed or progesterone-treated nonstressed animals was mimicked in vitro by addition to reaction test tubes of the neuroactive metabolite of progesterone, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (allopregnanolone).

In a survey, \"liking\" scores for flunitrazepam in methadone maintenance patients were higher than ratings for other benzodiazepines. A double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover clinical trial was conducted to assess the acute behavioral effects of flunitrazepam (0.50 and 2 mg) and triazolam (0.25 and 0.50 mg) in healthy male volunteers. Drug effects on physiological measures, psychomotor performance, and subjective rating scales, including specific questionnaires to evaluate abuse liability (e.g., ARCI or \"liking\" scores), were assessed before and 6 h after drug administration. Flunitrazepam 2 mg produced the most intense disruptive effects on all the performance tasks, triazolam 0.50 impaired performance except balance. All study drugs at all doses produced sedation symptoms in all or part of the subjective effects questionnaires. Only flunitrazepam 2 mg induced significative increases in some of the scales (\"liking\", \"good effects\", \"high\") that could be related to a possible abuse potential.

When mitochondrial membranes from PBR transfected yeast or from THP1 and U937 cells were used on immunoblot analysis, a high level of immunoreactivity was observed at 18 kDa, the PBR molecular mass deduced from cDNA, establishing the specificity of the antibody for the receptor. Moreover, binding experiments realized with intact mitochondria demonstrated that the immunogenic sequence was accessible to the antibody indicating that the C-terminal fragment of the PBR faces the cytosol.

One microM ketoconazole, a selective inhibitor of CYP3A, substantially inhibited the metabolism of salmeterol to alpha-hydroxysalmeterol. Disulfiram caused a small but consistent decrease in the amount of alpha-hydroxysalmeterol formed, possibly reflecting less than total selectivity for CYP2E1 under the conditions used. Other selective inhibitors had no significant effect on the metabolism of salmeterol. The rates of formation of alpha-hydroxysalmeterol in 10 individual liver microsomal samples showed an approximately 10-fold variation and were found to be highly correlated (r2 = 0.94; p < 0.001) with rates of metabolism of midazolam to 1'-hydroxymidazolam, a marker of CYP3A activity, in the same microsomal samples. No significant correlation was evident for the metabolism of salmeterol with levels of total P450 or other markers of human P450 activities in the same microsomal samples, thus indicating that the formation of alpha-hydroxysalmeterol is catalyzed predominantly by CYP3A. Insect cell microsomes that coexpressed human CYP3A and NADPH-P450 reductase were able to metabolize [14C]salmeterol to alpha-hydroxysalmeterol, thus confirming the role of CYP3A in catalyzing this reaction. The therapeutic dose of salmeterol is very low, so it is unlikely that any clinically relevant interactions will be observed as a consequence of the coadministration of salmeterol and other pharmaceutical agents that are metabolized by CYP3A.", 
    "70": "Since benzodiazepines (BZs) have been shown to inhibit the growth of some cell lines, the effects of these drugs on human melanoma (M-6) cell growth were examined. Cell growth was measured by the tetrazolium salt (MTT) assay or the Hoechst 33258 DNA assay. Diazepam, a non-selective BZ agonist, and Ro5-4864, a peripheral-type agonist, inhibited M-6 cell proliferation by 36% and 55% with EC50s of 139 microM and 107 microM respectively, after four days of treatment in culture. The central-type agonists, clonazepam and flunitrazepam, were ineffective. The antiproliferative effect of diazepam was partially reversed by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Neither PK 11195, a peripheral-type BZ receptor antagonist, nor flumazenil a central-type antagonist, blocked the effect of diazepam, indicating that these BZ receptors are not involved. The effect of PMA suggests that the antiproliferative effect of the BZs may involve inhibition of a calcium/protein kinase C-related pathway in M-6 cells.", 
    "71": "A receptor mapping technique using iodine-123 iomazenil and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) was employed to examine benzodiazepine receptor binding in a patient with Angelman syndrome (AS). AS is characterized by developmental delay, seizures, inappropriate laughter and ataxic movement. In this entity there is a cytogenic deletion of the proximal long arm of chromosome 15q11-q13, where the gene encoding the GABAA receptor beta3 subunit (GABRB3) is located. Since the benzodiazepine receptor is constructed as a receptor-ionophore complex that contains the GABAA receptor, it is a suitable marker for GABA-ergic synapsis. To determine whether benzodiazepine receptor density, which indirectly indicates changes in GABAA receptor density, is altered in the brain in patients with AS, we investigated a 27-year-old woman with AS using 123I-iomazenil and SPET. Receptor density was quantitatively assessed by measuring the binding potential using a simplified method. Regional cerebral blood flow was also measured with N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine. We demonstrated that benzodiazepine receptor density is severely decreased in the cerebellum, and mildly decreased in the frontal and temporal cortices and basal ganglia, a result which is considered to indicate decreased GABAA receptor density in these regions. Although the deletion of GABRB3 was not observed in the present study, we indirectly demonstrated the disturbance of inhibitory neurotransmission mediated by the GABAA receptor in the investigated patient. 123I-iomazenil with SPET was useful to map benzodiazepine receptors, which indicate GABAA receptor distribution and their density.", 
    "72": "Quantitation of metabolic processes with dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) and tracer kinetic modelling relies on the time course of authentic ligand in plasma, i.e. the input curve. The determination of the latter often requires the measurement of labelled metabolites, a laborious procedure. In this study we examined the possibility of mathematical metabolite correction, which might obviate the need for actual metabolite measurements. Mathematical metabolite correction was implemented by estimating the input curve together with kinetic tissue parameters. The general feasibility of the approach was evaluated in a Monte Carlo simulation using a two tissue compartment model. The method was then applied to a series of five human carbon-11 iomazenil PET studies. The measured cerebral tissue time-activity curves were fitted with a single tissue compartment model. For mathematical metabolite correction the input curve following the peak was approximated by a sum of three decaying exponentials, the amplitudes and characteristic half-times of which were then estimated by the fitting routine. In the simulation study the parameters used to generate synthetic tissue time-activity curves (K1-k4) were refitted with reasonable identifiability when using mathematical metabolite correction. Absolute quantitation of distribution volumes was found to be possible provided that the metabolite and the kinetic models are adequate. If the kinetic model is oversimplified, the linearity of the correlation between true and estimated distribution volumes is still maintained, although the linear regression becomes dependent on the input curve. These simulation results were confirmed when applying mathematical metabolite correction to the [11C]iomazenil study. Estimates of the distribution volume calculated with a measured input curve were linearly related to the estimates calculated using mathematical metabolite correction with correlation coefficients >0.990. However, the slope of the regression line displayed considerable variability among the subjects (0.33-0.95), demonstrating that absolute quantitation of the distribution volume was impaired. Mathematical metabolite correction is a feasible method and may prove useful in cases where actual metabolite data cannot be obtained. The potential for absolute quantitation seems limited, but the method allows the quantitative assessment of regional ratios of receptor measures.",

With the increasing use of baclofen intrathecally for spasticity and its wide interpatient dose variability, there is a need to find a safe antagonist to baclofen for routine medical use.", 
    "74": "Liver samples were obtained at hepatectomy from patients with end stage alcoholic liver disease (n = 5), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 5) and chronic rejection needing retransplantation (n = 5). Normal liver material was also obtained from five organ donors. From these samples microsomes were made containing cytochrome P450 3A. The amount of this enzyme was measured by Western immunoblotting and its function assessed by measuring the rate of production of two metabolites of midazolam, 1-hydroxy midazolam and 4-hydroxy midazolam. There was a wide range in all groups for both the expression and function of this enzyme. Liver tissue affected by cirrhotic disease showed greater preservation of enzyme function than that affected by hepatocellular disease. There was a good correlation between the expression of the enzyme and production of the 1-hydroxy metabolite, but a poor correlation between production of the 4-hydroxy metabolite and expression. This poor correlation may reflect the failure to measure the specific enzyme responsible for producing 4-hydroxy midazolam.", 
    "75": "Male patients, aged 27-74 yr, without hypertension or overt cardiovascular disease were premedicated with temazepam 20 mg orally and allocated randomly to receive sedation with either midazolam (12 patients) in a dose sufficient to provide light sedation (retained response to loud voice) or ketamine 1 mg kg-1 (11 patients). Median midazolam dose was 0.08 (interquartile range 0.02) mg kg-1. The activity of the muscles of the tongue, anterior neck and scalene group was measured with surface electrodes and compared with the awake state. Muscle activity decreased significantly after midazolam in each group of muscles, to median values of 42%, 28% and 33%, respectively, of awake values. Airway obstruction occurred in 10 of 12 patients and during obstruction muscle activity increased significantly to 69%, 73% and 52% of awake values, but in all cases this was insufficient to overcome the obstruction. After ketamine, activity did not change significantly and there were no episodes of airway obstruction. Phasic muscle activity was noted after sedation in 11 subjects but there was no difference in the incidence between the two groups (midazolam, six patients; ketamine, five patients).", 
    "76": "Ataxia, sedation, amnesia, ethanol and barbiturate potentiation, tolerance, dependence, and the potential for drug abuse plague the clinical use of anxiolytic benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine and non-benzodiazepine ligands that are in current clinical use act as full allosteric modulators of GABA-gated Cl- channels, and on chronic administration trigger compensatory changes in the subunit expression of GABAA receptors. In these putative abnormal receptors, full allosteric modulators have low intrinsic activity and potency, and tolerance and dependence ensue. In this review, Erminio Costa and Alessandro Guidotti discuss the development of partial allosteric modulators, such as imidazenil, which have high potency and low intrinsic activity at GABA-gated Cl- channels. Since in animals tolerant to full allosteric modulators imidazenil also fails to show cross-tolerance, it is an example of a new type of anxiolytic and anticonvulsant drug acting at GABAA receptors via benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "77": "A 37-year-old, white male collapsed at his home following a party. He reportedly had a history of unspecified cardiac arrhythmia. The ambulance crew found him unresponsive and an ECG revealed ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. Following one hour of resuscitative efforts in the ambulance and emergency room of a local hospital, he was pronounced dead. An antemortem urine toxicology screen performed at the hospital was \"positive\" for benzodiazepines, cocaine and amphetamine/methamphetamine. At autopsy, there was generalized organ congestion with no evidence of trauma or other significant pathology except mild, left ventricular hypertrophy. Quantitation by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of methamphetamine in bile, blood, urine and gastric contents yielded 21.7, 0.7, 32.0 and 2.9 mg/L, respectively. Liver and brain contained 2.2 and 2.7 mg/kg, respectively. A trace amount of p-OH-alpha-benzyl-N-methylphenethylamine (p-OH-BNMPA), a metabolite of alpha-benzyl-N-methylphenethylamine (BNMPA), an impurity of illicit methamphetamine synthesis, was also detected in the urine. Since these impurities can be characteristic of a particular synthetic method, their presence in seized samples or their detection in biological samples from methamphetamine users can further be used to monitor the sales of precursor chemicals, group seized compounds to common sources of illicit production or provide links between manufacturers, dealers and users.", 
    "78": "The plasma disposition of three model substrates (lorazepam, indocyanine green, and antipyrine) and the formation clearance of antipyrine metabolites (3-hydroxymethylantipyrine, norantipyrine, and 4-hydroxyantipyrine) were evaluated in 15 subjects with mild cystic fibrosis and in 15 healthy control subjects. Plasma clearance was significantly greater in patients with cystic fibrosis for both lorazepam (1.7 +/- 0.4 versus 1.2 +/- 0.5 ml/min/kg) and indocyanine green (14.2 +/- 6.1 versus 9.1 +/- 3.0 ml/min/kg). In contrast, the clearance of antipyrine was not significantly different (1.0 +/- 0.7 versus 0.8 +/- 0.3 ml/min/kg), but the formation clearance for 3-hydroxymethylantipyrine was significantly greater in patients with cystic fibrosis. Lorazepam and antipyrine apparent steady-state volume of distribution were not different between groups. These results suggest that clearance of drugs that undergo conjugation (e.g., lorazepam) or biliary excretion (e.g., indocyanine green) is increased in patients with mild cystic fibrosis. In contrast, the increased formation clearance of only one antipyrine metabolite suggests that alterations in clearance of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes are substrate specific and isoform specific in patients with cystic fibrosis.",

    "80": "Twelve healthy male volunteers were randomly allocated to one of the two different treatment sequences, placebo-erythromycin or erythromycin-placebo, with an at least 6-week washout period between the two trial phases. Each volunteer received 400 mg erythromycin or matched placebo given orally three times a day for 10 days and an oral dose (0.8 mg) of alprazolam on the posttreatment day 8. Plasma concentration of alprazolam was measured up to 48 hours after the administration, and psychomotor function was assessed at each time of blood samplings with use of the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, visual analog scale, and Udvalg for kliniske unders\u00f8gelser side effect rating scale.",

    "84": "Midazolam was administered intravenously (1 mg) or orally (2 mg) to 20 healthy young subjects (10 men and 10 women) in a random fashion, and the disposition of the drug and its 1'-hydroxy metabolite were determined. In separate in vitro studies, the CYP3A-mediated formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam by human hepatic and intestinal microsomes was investigated.", 
    "85": "No gender-related differences were noted in either the systemic (370 +/- 114 ml/min [mean +/- SD]) or oral (1413 +/- 807 ml/min) clearance values of midazolam. Despite complete oral absorption, measured oral bioavailability was on average about 50% less than that predicted on the assumption that only the liver contributed to first-pass metabolism. Pharmacokinetic estimation of the intestinal component indicated an extraction ratio (0.43 +/- 0.24) that was similar to that of the liver (0.44 +/- 0.14). 1'-Hydroxymidazolam was extensively but variably formed in vitro by both hepatic and intestinal microsomes and, although the intrinsic clearance (V(max)/Km) was higher in the liver preparations (540 +/- 747 versus 135 +/- 92 microliters/min/mg protein), this difference was not statistically significant.", 
    "86": "These results show that the small intestine can be a major site for presystemic, CYP3A-mediated metabolism after oral administration. Moreover, it appears that this represents a true first-pass effect. In addition, intestinal and hepatic metabolism may be important factors in interindividual variability in disposition after oral administration of midazolam and similar CYP3A substrates. Finally, intestinal localization of CYP3A may be significant in metabolism-based drug-drug interactions.", 
    "87": "General anesthetics and radiocontrast media (RCM) can cause anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions. These are usually underdiagnosed and underreported, but their incidence is apparently rising. Their pathogenesis is complex and not completely understood, but the release of vasoactive mediators from basophils and mast cells plays a central role. The recent development of in vitro techniques to study the release of preformed (histamine and tryptase) and de novo synthesized mediators (PGD2, LTC4, and PAF) from purified basophils and mast cells has made it possible to quantify the mediator-releasing activity of anesthetics such as muscle relaxants, general anesthetics, opioids, and benzodiazepines and RCM on human basophils and mast cells isolated from lung, skin and heart tissues. The majority of general anesthetics and RCM tested induced only the release of preformed mediators (histamine and tryptase), not of the de novo synthesized eicosanoids. There was wide variability in the response of basophils and mast cells from different donors to the same drug or RCM, presumably due to the releasability parameter. Hyperosmolality is probably not the only factor responsible for basophil and mast cell activation by RCM. The in vitro release of histamine induced by anesthetic drugs and RCM was correlated with the release of tryptase. Given the longer half-life of tryptase than histamine in plasma, measurements of plasma tryptase may become a useful diagnostic tool for identifying adverse reactions to anesthetics and RCM.",

Dentists must weigh the benefits of the chronic administration of a drug for the management of temporomandibular disorders against the equivocal scientific support for the use of many drug classes and the potential for serious toxicity with prolonged administration.", 
    "89": "It is well recognized that corrected bile duct diameters, as measured by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC), are often significantly greater than the corresponding ultrasound measurement. This can be attributed to variation in bile duct distensibility and is particularly noted in post cholecystectomy patients, possibly due to loss of the gall bladder reservoir effect. It has been suggested that increased bile duct distensibility may be related to the post-cholecystectomy syndrome. We have observed a similar discrepancy between ultrasound and per-operative cholangiography (POC). This trial investigates whether the discrepancy between ultrasound and POC measurements has clinical significance.", 
    "90": "Seventy-five patients with normal pre-operative ultrasound and POC undergoing standard open cholecystectomy (with benzodiazepine pre-medication) in 1990 were identified. After allowance for magnification, maximum biliary diameters were obtained for the proximal extra-hepatic bile duct. Follow-up was obtained in 67 patients from clinical case notes and contact with general practitioners.", 
    "91": "Considerable variation of bile duct distensibility was recorded (range 83% to 410%) with 12 cases having POC biliary diameters outside radiological guidelines (12 mm as recorded on the radiograph). This distension is shown to increase with age. After 4 years, 16 patients had recurrent abdominal pain of which nine had undiagnosed right upper quadrant pain. There were no clinical cases of retained stone post-operatively. There was no correlation between POC measured bile duct diameter or distensibility and post-operative or long term problems. This study suggests that the bile duct has a normal variation of distensibility which increases with age and that radiological guidelines, as regards the upper limit for normal POC biliary diameters can be relaxed.",

    "96": "Previous experiments demonstrated that, compared with 6-month-old rats, the performance of 20-month-old rats in a behavioral vigilance task was characterized by an impairment in their ability to detect visual signals, whereas their ability to discriminate between longer signals and nonsignal events was unaffected. The benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonist chlordiazepoxide potently and selectively interacted with the effects of age on the relative number of hits. However, negative modulators of GABAergic transmission (Zk 93 426, beta-CCtB, RU 33965) failed to attenuate the effects of age on behavioral vigilance. the present experiment tested the hypothesis that the performance of senescent animals (28 months) is further impaired and thus would allow the demonstration of beneficial effects of BZR inverse agonists or nicotine. However, administration of ZK 93 426 (0.39, 1.56, 6.25 mg/kg), Ru 33965 (0.1, 0.5 mg/kg), or nicotine (0.09, 0.287, 0.689 mg/kg) did not beneficially affect the performance of senescent animals; rather, detrimental effects were found. Considering the beneficial behavioral effects of these compounds in animals with experimentally induced impairments in cholinergic function, the present finding point to limitations of normal aging as a variable in animal experiments on BZR inverse agonist or nicotine-induced attenuation of cognitive impairments that result from cholinergic hypofunction.", 
    "97": "Dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer is a common symptom that is difficult to treat. This study investigated whether oxygen helps to relieve rest dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer. In a single-blind controlled trial, oxygen and air were administered in random order to hospice patients reporting dyspnea at rest. Measurements of arterial oxygen saturation, lung function, and dyspnea (using a visual analogue scale [VAS] and Borg score) were made before and after each gas had been given for 15 min. Data from 38 patients were used: analysis of variance revealed that mean VAS levels during baseline conditions, breathing room air (59 mm), were significantly reduced after administration of either air (48 mm; p < 0.001) or oxygen (45 mm; p < 0.001); there was no significant difference for the mean VAS scores between oxygen and air administration. There was no statistically significant order of treatment effect. There was no difference in the response to oxygen or air in patients with a history of cardiopulmonary disease. The improvement in dyspnea with oxygen could not be predicted from a subject's initial level of hypoxia. Results suggested that benzodiazepines may potentiate the effect of oxygen. The overall conclusion is that oxygen and air can have a significant effect in reducing dyspnea at rest in patients with advanced cancer.", 
    "98": "To our knowledge, no study has clearly demonstrated the advantage of sedative premedication for bronchoscopy. In a double-blind study, we evaluated the efficacy of oral lorazepam as premedication for bronchoscopy. One hundred patients were randomly assigned to receive placebo (group A) or lorazepam (2 mg) (group B) approximately 1.5 h before bronchoscopy. Immediately after the procedure and the following day, a questionnaire addressing the patient's perception of the procedure was administered. Specifically, subjects were asked to grade the bronchoscopy as very easy, easy, difficult, or very difficult to tolerate and if they would agree to a second bronchoscopy if believed necessary. In addition, their recollection of the procedure was graded as clear, indistinct, or not at all. No difference was found between the two groups for age, duration of the bronchoscopy, and the answers to the questionnaire administered immediately after the procedure. Most patients from both groups found their level of sedation adequate. On the following day, however, group B reported with lower frequency that the technique was difficult or very difficult (38.0% vs 65.3% for group A; p < 0.005) and that they would be less reluctant to a repeated bronchoscopy (30.0% vs 57.1% for group A; p < 0.015). Moreover, their recollection of the procedure was now less precise than for those who had received the placebo (p < 0.005). This suggests that the difference observed between the two groups at 24 h was related to the amnesic effect of lorazepam. We conclude that lorazepam, by improving patient's perception of the bronchoscopy, is a useful premedication and may facilitate patient's investigation when a second bronchoscopy becomes necessary.", 
    "99": "In a population-based, matched case-control study from southern Sweden of 400 patients with a first diagnosis of malignant melanoma and 640 healthy control subjects aged 15-75 years, the association between commonly prescribed drugs, alcohol, smoking and malignant melanoma was evaluated. In addition, the relation between reproductive and hormonal factors and melanoma in women was studied. It was found that certain specific types of prescribed drugs, i.e. beta-blockers, hydralazines and benzodiazepines, may increase the risk of melanoma development. However, these associations were diminished, at least for benzodiazepines, after controlling for host factors. As these findings are unconfirmed, and may be due to chance or confounding, further studies are warranted. The risk of malignant melanoma was not influenced by alcohol consumption or smoking habits. Our results do not suggest an association between oral contraceptives and melanoma. Furthermore, reproductive factors were not independent risk factors for melanoma. However, increasing number of live births seemed to be protective (P for trend = 0.01). There is a need for further research to be able to draw firm conclusions on the relation between number of live births and melanoma. The results based on histopathological re-examinations and those based on tumour registry data were essentially the same.", 
    "100": "Neuroactive steroids bind to a unique site on the gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor complex and allosterically modulate the binding of convulsant ([35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, [35S]TBPS), GABA ([3H]muscimol), and benzodiazepine ([3H]flunitrazepam) site ligands. In rat cortical membranes, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha, 5 alpha-P) is a full agonist at the steroid site, inhibiting 96% of specific [35S]TBPS binding and enhancing [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol binding 95% and 69% above control levels, respectively. In contrast, the synthetic steroid 3 alpha-hydroxy-3 beta-trifluoromethyl-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (Co 2-1970) has limited efficacy for modulating the binding of [35S]TBPS (44% inhibition), [3H]flunitrazepam (41% enhancement), and [3H]muscimol (< 10% enhancement). In competition experiments, Co 2-1970 (10 microM) reduced the apparent potency of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P by 7-17-fold for modulating the binding of these radioligands in rat cortical membranes, suggesting that it has partial agonist properties. Because cortical membranes contain a heterogeneous population of receptors, Co 2-1970 was examined in recombinant GABAA receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Co 2-1970 inhibited [35S]TBPS binding with limited efficacy (39-65% inhibition) in the five receptor combinations examined and, at 10 microM, reduced the apparent potency of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P 57-fold for inhibiting [35S]TBPS binding to alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L receptors. To verify these findings functionally, the effects of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P and Co 2-1970 were examined electrophysiologically in Xenopus oo-cytes expressing alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L receptors. Co 2-1970 showed limited efficacy potentiation of GABA-evoked chloride currents relative to 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P (28% and 86% of the GABA maximum current, respectively). Moreover, Co 2-1970 produced a concentration-dependent antagonism of the 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P-induced potentiation that was associated with a reduction in the apparent affinity of 3 alpha, 5 alpha-P (11-fold at 10 microM Co 2-1970). Taken together, these data indicate that Co 2-1970 is a partial agonist at the neuroactive steroid site associated with GABAA receptors.", 
    "101": "We evaluated whether tolerance to the antagonism of bicuculine-induced seizures by diazepam is associated with changes (i) in the content of mRNAs encoding for gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor subunits, (ii) in the expression density of these subunits, and (iii) in the 1,4-benzodiazepine binding site characteristics in discrete neocortical structures. We found that in diazepam-tolerant rats, the content of the mRNA encoding for the alpha 1 subunit of the GABAA receptor decreased in the frontoparietal motor (FrPaM) cortex and in the hippocampus (42% and 20%, respectively) but not in the frontoparietal somatosensory (FrPaSS) cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, and cerebellum. In the FrPaM cortex, gamma 2S and gamma 2L subunit mRNA contents were also decreased (48% and 30%, respectively), whereas that of alpha 5 was increased (30%). In the FrPaM and FrPaSS cortices as well as in cerebellum of diazepam-tolerant rats, the content of alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 6, beta 2, and delta subunit mRNA was unchanged, as was the content of alpha 2, alpha 5, gamma 1, and gamma 2S subunit mRNA in the hippocampus. Furthermore, the reduction in alpha 1 subunit mRNA content in the FrPaM cortex and the anticonvulsant tolerance to diazepam returned to control values 72 hr after termination of the protracted diazepam treatment. Rats receiving a treatment with imidazenil in doses equipotent and with a schedule identical to that of diazepam failed to exhibit tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of this drug or cross-tolerance to diazepam. In these rats, the content of mRNA encoding for alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, alpha 6, gamma 1, gamma 2S, gamma 2L, and delta GABAA receptor subunits failed to change in the FrPaM and FrPaSS cortices, in the hippocampus, and in the other brain areas that were studied in diazepam-tolerant rats. Although the density and affinity of [3H]flumazenil and [3H]imidazenil binding failed to change in the FrPaM and FrPaSS cortices of diazepam-tolerant rats, the expression density of alpha 1 subunit immunogold labeling decreased by 37%, whereas that of alpha 5, gamma 2L/S, and beta 2/3 increased by 158%, 50%, and 47%, respectively, in the FrPaM cortex, and the density of the alpha 5 subunit selectively increased (209%) in the FrPaSS cortex. In contrast, the immunogold labeling density of the alpha 1, alpha 5, gamma 2L/S, and beta 2/3 subunits failed to change in either the FrPaM or FrPaSS cortex of rats receiving protracted imidazenil treatment.",

Such techniques, applied to emission tomographic cerebral blood flow scans, reveal subtle alterations in neuronal activity during specific behavioral states. In the present work, we extend the principles of intersubject image summation analysis to the evaluation of emission tomographic ligand-binding studies. A general methodology is presented that may be applied to a wide variety of binding site determinations. The procedure consists of anatomic standardization of individual brains to a common stereotaxic orientation, followed by statistical analyses of group versus group or individual versus group differences. We develop and evaluate performance of our technique with the use of positron emission tomographic [11C]flumazenil scans from normal volunteers, depicting the regional cerebral distribution of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "103": "On multiple occasions, rats were administered diazepam (2.0 mg/kg, ip) followed 30 min thereafter by yohimbine hydrochloride (2.5 or 5. 0 mg/kg) or isotonic saline (forward conditioning groups). Three additional groups (backward conditioning controls) were given equivalent injections, but in reverse order. After eight such pairings, the effects of a single injection of diazepam on motor performance (balancing on a rotating drum) was assessed. Rats that had received either dose of yohimbine during forward conditioning trials maintained their balance longer than the saline controls. After four additional conditioning trials, the animals' activity patterns in a plus-maze screening test for anxiolytics were examined. Placed into the maze after a single test injection of isotonic saline, the behavior of all groups was virtually identical: less than 16% of total entries into or time spent in the four arms of the maze was spent in the two \"open\" arms (unprotected by surrounding walls). When tested in the maze again, but 35 min after a single injection of diazepam, the groups that had received diazepam but not yohimbine during the conditioning phase exhibited the expected increase in open-arm activity, and equivalent increases were found in backward conditioning groups. However, the group previously conditioned with 2.5 mg/kg of yohimbine following diazepam also showed an increased open-arm activity when tested with diazepam alone, but it was significantly greater than that seen in the control group. In contrast, the group conditioned with 5.0 mg/kg yohimbine following diazepam exhibited no effect of diazepam upon their plus maze activity; consequently, these animals spent less time in the open arms than either of the other groups. Yohimbine alone normally decreases open-arm activity (a putative \"anxiogenic\" effect) in a linear dose-dependent fashion. The fact that it had a bidirectional conditional effect on the diazepam cue drug demonstrates that a conditional response in drug --> drug conditioning cannot always be predicted on the basis of the behavioral response to the signaled drug. Consideration is given to possible reasons for these effects of diazepam --> yohimbine pairings in terms of the known neuropharmacological properties of yohimbine.", 
    "104": "Given concerns about use of psychotropic medication during pregnancy, the authors reviewed the literature regarding the effects of prenatal exposure to psychotropic medications on fetal outcome.", 
    "105": "A MEDLINE search of all articles written in English from 1966 to 1995 was performed to review information on the effects of psychotropic drug use during pregnancy on fetal outcome. Where sufficient data were available and when methodologically appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to assess risk of fetal exposure by psychotropic medication class.", 
    "106": "Three primary effects are associated with medication use during pregnancy: 1) teratogenicity, 2) perinatal syndromes (neonatal toxicity), and 3) postnatal behavioral sequelae. For many drug classes there are substantial data regarding risk for teratogenicity. Tricyclic antidepressants do not seem to confer increased risk for organ dysgenesis. The available data indicate that first-trimester exposure to low-potency phenothiazines, lithium, certain anticonvulsants, and benzodiazepines may increase the relative risk for congenital anomalies. However, the absolute risk of congenital malformations following prenatal exposure to most psychotropics is low.", 
    "107": "Exposure to certain psychotropic drugs in utero may increase the risk for some specific congenital anomalies, but the rate of occurrence of these anomalies even with the increased risk remains low. Use of psychotropic medications during pregnancy is appropriate in many clinical situations and should include thoughtful weighing of risk of prenatal exposure versus risk of relapse following drug discontinuation. The authors present disorder-based guidelines for psychotropic drug use during pregnancy and for psychiatrically ill women who wish to conceive.", 
    "108": "Perioperative thermal manipulations are usually directed at the skin surface because methods of directly warming the core are invasive or ineffective. However, inadequate heat flow between peripheral and core compartments will decrease the rate at which core temperature changes. We therefore determined whether core hypothermia is delayed after initiation of surface cooling. Six volunteers were anesthetized with propofol and midazolam, and maintained under three layers of passive insulation for 2.5-4 h. Subsequently, the skin surface was cooled using forced air, 1000 L/min, at 10 degrees C. Isoflurane was added as necessary to maintain arteriovenous shunt vasodilation. Overall heat balance was determined from the difference between cutaneous heat loss (thermal flux transducers) and metabolic heat production (oxygen consumption). Average arm and leg (peripheral) tissue temperatures were determined from 19 intramuscular needle thermocouples, 10 skin temperatures, and \"deep\" foot temperature. Overall body heat content decreased approximately 234 kcal during 2.5 h of active cooling. Core temperature, which was nearly constant before active cooling, decreased approximately 1.3 degrees C/h. There was no delay between initiation of active cooling and the decrease in core temperature. Furthermore, peripheral (arm and leg) and core (trunk and head) tissue heat contents decreased at virtually the same rates: approximately 50 kcal/h and approximately 47 kcal/h, respectively. These data indicate that there is little restriction of heat flow between peripheral and core tissues in vasodilated, anesthetized subjects.", 
    "109": "Gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) mediate their effects through at least two types of receptors (CCK receptors A and B). While it has been hypothesized that gastrin, a stimulator of gastric acid secretion, is also a neurotransmitter and a stimulator of cell proliferation in various normal and neoplastic tissues, its effect on astrocytic brain tumors has not been actively investigated.", 
    "110": "Our goal was to determine the effects of gastrin and gastin and/or CCK antagonists on the proliferation in vitro of astrocytic tumor cells by use of both established cell lines and primary cell cultures of tumor tissue.", 
    "111": "Ten established astrocytic tumor cell lines, SW1088, SW1783, Hs683, H4, U87, U118, U138, U373, T98G, and A172, were studied. The effects of added gastrin (at 0.01, 0.1, and microM) and the gastrin/CCK antagonists L-365,260, CI-988, L-364,718, and JMV 234 (each at 0.01, 0.1, and 1 microM) on the cellular proliferation rates of the 10 cell lines were indirectly measured by use of the colorimetric tetrazolium assay. The influence of gastrin (at 0.01 microM) on the cellular proliferation of primary cultures from nine freshly explanted astrocytic tumors was assessed by means of tritiated thymidine uptake and autoradiography.", 
    "112": "At specific concentrations, added gastrin increased the cellular proliferation of three established astrocytic cell lines (A172, Hs683, and SW1088), decreased it in two (U373 and T98G), and was without effect on the remaining five. Gastrin decreased cellular proliferation in one primary astrocytic tumor cell culture, stimulated it in five, and had no apparent effect in the remaining three. L-365,260, a CCK receptor B antagonist used at 0.01 microM, increased cellular proliferation in seven cell lines (A172, H4, Hs683, SW1783, T98G, U118, and U138), decreased it in one (U87), and had no effect in the remaining two. CI-988, another CCK receptor B antagonist used at 0.01 microM, inhibited cellular proliferation in five cell lines (A172, H4, SW1783, U373, and U87), stimulated it in two (T98G and U138), and had no effect in three. The CCK receptor A antagonists L-364,718 and JMV 234, both used at 0.01 microM, affected the cellular proliferation of only three of the 10 cell lines.",

    "114": "The effect of empenthrin, a synthetic pyrethroid, on pentobarbital (PTB)-induced sleeping time was examined in mice and rats. In mice, pretreatment with empenthrin prolonged PTB-induced sleeping time in a dose-dependent manner. The maximum effect on PTB-sleeping time was noted when mice were pretreated orally with empenthrin 2-4 h before PTB injection. However, empenthrin did not change the sleeping time induced by diethyl ether which is hardly metabolized in liver. Empenthrin inhibited the clearance of serum PTB in mic, but did not change the PTB concentration in serum at which animals recovered from sleeping. To examine the effect of PTB on metabolic enzymes in mouse liver, PTB was incubated aerobically with a hepatic microsomal fraction in the presence of NADPH at 37 degrees C. Empenthrin inhibited the vitro metabolism of PTB dose-dependently. In rats, empenthrin neither changed the PTB sleeping time, nor inhibited the clearance of serum PTB. No inhibitory effect of empenthrin was observed on the in vitro metabolism of PTB using rat hepatic microsomal fraction. These findings indicate that empenthrin prolongs PTB-sleeping time in mice through an inhibition of the PTB-metabolizing enzyme(s) in the liver , an effect that does not occur in rats. Also, there is a clear species-specificity in the inhibitory effect of empenthrin on the PTB-metabolizing enzyme(s).", 
    "115": "During the last five years, the prescription of tranquillizers has been reduced by 26% in Vestfold County compared with 19% in the country as a whole. This is probably a result of two initiatives: a common strategy to reduce prescription in the county, and monitoring prescription rate of the individual general practitioners. We examined the prescription of diazepam 5 mg tablets and found a reduction of more than 30% from 1989 to 1995. The reduction was greatest among the younger age groups and decreased with increasing age. The most probable reason for this pattern is a more restrictive attitude among general practitioners towards using diazepam to treat the young and middle-aged. The results for 1995 show that women still receive about 60% more diazepam than men, and women aged 70-79 years receive 117% more than women aged 40-49 years.", 
    "116": "Benzodiazepine (BZA)-5B, a CAAX farnesyl-transferase inhibitor, was previously shown to block the farnesylation of H-Ras and to reverse the transformed morphology of Rat1 cells expressing oncogenic H-RasV12. Non-transformed Rat1 cells were not affected by BZA-5B, suggesting that they produce a form of Ras whose prenylation is not blocked by this compound. The likely candidate is K-RasB, which differs from H-Ras primarily in the terminal 24 amino acids. In the current study we examined the effect of BZA-5B on the prenylation of a chimeric oncogenic Ras protein designated H/K-RasBV12, consisting of the first 164 amino acids of H-RasV12 followed by the last 24 amino acids of K-RasB. BZA-5B failed to block the prenylation of this chimera and was thus unable to reverse the transformed morphology of Rat1 cells in which it was expressed. Another potent inhibitor of H-Ras farnesylation, L-739,749, also failed to block prenylation of H/K-RasBV12. Similar results were obtained in transfected cells expressing a widely used version of K-RasBV12 containing a 10-amino acid extension at its NH2 terminus. Neither BZA-5B nor L-739,749 reversed the transformed morphology of cells expressing H/K-RasBV12. The resistance of K-RasB to farnesyltransferase inhibition provides a likely explanation for the resistance of nontransformed cells to the growth inhibitory effects of BZA-5B and L-739,749.", 
    "117": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion in rats and humans is inhibited by pancreatic proteases and bile acids in the intestine. It has been hypothesized that the inhibition of CCK release caused by pancreatic proteases is due to proteolytic inactivation of a CCK-releasing peptide present in intestinal secretion. To purify the putative luminal CCK-releasing factor (LCRF), intestinal secretions were collected by perfusing a modified Thiry-Vella fistula of jejunum in conscious rats. From these secretions, the peptide was concentrated by ultrafiltration followed by low-pressure reverse-phase chromatography and purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Purity was confirmed by high-performance capillary electrophoresis. Fractions were assayed for CCK-releasing activity by their ability to stimulate pancreatic protein secretion when infused into the proximal small intestine of conscious rats. Partially purified fractions strongly stimulated both pancreatic secretion and CCK release while CCK receptor blockade abolished the pancreatic response. Amino acid analysis and mass spectral analysis showed that the purified peptide is composed of 70-75 amino acid residues and has a mass of 8136 Da. Microsequence analysis of LCRF yielded an amino acid sequence for 41 residues as follows: STFWAYQPDGDNDPTDYQKYEHTSSPSQLLAPGDYPCVIEV. When infused intraduodenally, the purified peptide stimulated pancreatic protein and fluid secretion in a dose-related manner in conscious rats and significantly elevated plasma CCK levels. Immunoaffinity chromatography using antisera raised to synthetic LCRF-(1-6) abolished the CCK releasing activity of intestinal secretions. These studies demonstrate, to our knowledge, the first chemical characterization of a luminally secreted enteric peptide functioning as an intraluminal regulator of intestinal hormone release.", 
    "118": "The effect of Gi coupled receptor activation (adenosine A1 and 5-HT1B receptors) on cholecystokinin receptor-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation has been investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human adenosine A1 receptor cDNA (CHO-A1). CHO cells constitutively express the 5-HT1B receptor [Berg, Clarke, Sailstad, Saltzman and Maayani (1994) Mol. Pharmacol. 46, 477-484]. Our previous studies using CHO-A1 cells have revealed that both the adenosine A1 and 5-HT1B receptor are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase activity and stimulate increases in [Ca2+]i, through a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway. In the present study the selective adenosine A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine stimulated a pertussis toxin-sensitive increase in total [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. The sulphated C-terminal octapeptide of cholecystokinin (CCK-8) stimulated a robust and pertussis toxin-insensitive increase in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation through the activation of CCKA receptors. Co-stimulation of CHO-A1 cells with N6-cyclopentyladenosine and CCK-8 produced a synergistic increase in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. The synergistic interaction between N6-cyclopentyladenosine and CCK-8 was abolished in pertussis toxin-treated cells. Synergy between N6-cyclopentyladenosine and CCK-8 still occurred in the absence of extracellular calcium. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist 5-carboxyamidotryptamine did not stimulate a measurable increase in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. Furthermore, 5-carboxyamidotryptamine had no significant effect on CCK-8 mediated [3H]inositol phosphate production. Activation of endogenous P2U receptors (Gq/Gll coupled) with ATP gamma S produced a significant increase in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. Co-stimulation of CHO-A1 cells with ATP gamma S and CCK-8 produced additive increases in [3H]inositol phosphate accumulation. These data indicate that CHO-A1 cells may prove a useful model system in which to investigate further the mechanisms underlying the intracellular 'cross-talk' between phospholipase C coupled receptors (Gq/Gll linked) and Gi/Go coupled receptors.", 
    "119": "Effects of various benzodiazepines were investigated in ovariectomized rat isolated uterus which had been chronically pre-treated with different female sex hormones: oestrogen, progesterone and oestrogen + progesterone. Uteri obtained from all groups developed a spontaneous, rhythmic activity. The spontaneous activity observed in control uterus was either inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam or 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxam ide (PK 11195), or was abolished in [Ca2+]o-free solution. Diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 all caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the [K+]o-pre-contracted uterus with the relative order of potency: PK 11195 > 4'-chlorodiazepam > diazepam > clonazepam. Administration of [Ca2+]o (1 microM to 10 mM) caused a concentration-dependent contraction of uterus, bathed in [Ca2+]o-free physiological salt solution obtained from different pre-treatment groups. Incubation with different concentrations (microM) of diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 caused a decrease in response to [Ca2+]o-induced contraction in all groups of rat uteri. These results indicate that micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites exist in rat uterus. Diazepam, 4'-chlorodiazepam, clonazepam and PK 11195 caused relaxation of pre-contracted rat uterus and this effect may involve the inhibition of influx of [Ca2+]o and the relaxing effects of different benzodiazepines observed in this study can be modulated by pre-treatment with different female hormones.", 
    "120": "Photoaffinity labeling of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBZr) in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions from AT-1, H, and G Dunning R-3327 tumor sublines was performed using the photoaffinity ligand 3H-PK 14105. Subsequent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed specific labeling of a 17 kDa protein in the microsomal fractions from these tumors. In the mitochondrial fractions, however, two bands with the apparent molecular mass of 17 and 18 kDa in AT-1 and H tumors were identified, whereas only the 17 kDa band was present in G tumors. Using another ligand, 3H-flunitrazepam, to photoaffinity label PBZr, proteins with molecular masses of 17, 30, 42, and 48 kDa were identified. These data suggest the possibility of different subclasses of PBZrs in Dunning prostatic tumors.", 
    "121": "The subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic receptors were studied in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with radioligand binding techniques and the non-selective muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) as a ligand. [3H]QNB was bound to human peripheral lymphocytes in a manner consistent with the labelling of muscarinic cholinergic receptors. The dissociation constant (Kd) value was 0.60 +/- 0.08 nM and the maximum density of binding sites (Bmax) was 2.33 +/- 0.03 fmol/2.2 x 10(6) cells. The binding was time-, temperature- and concentration-dependent, belonging to a single class of high affinity sites. Analysis of the pharmacological profile of [3H]QNB binding in the presence of compounds specific for the different muscarinic receptor subtypes suggests that human peripheral blood lymphocytes express mainly muscarinic cholinergic M2 and M3 receptor subtypes and to a lesser extent muscarinic M4 receptors. The characterization of the subtypes of muscarinic cholinergic recognition sites expressed by human peripheral blood lymphocytes may represent a tool for investigating the possible relationships between immune and cholinergic systems in normal and pathologic conditions.", 
    "122": "The synthesis and pharmacological properties of imidazobenzodiazepines with both high affinity and selectivity for alpha 5-containing GABAA receptors are described. Four of these compounds (5, 6, 8, and 9) inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding to recombinant alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 GABAA receptors with IC50 values between approximately 0.4 and 5 nM. These compounds were > or = 24-75-fold more selective for recombinant receptors containing alpha 5 subunits compared to other, \"diazepam-sensitive\" GABAA receptors containing either alpha 1, alpha 2, or alpha 3 subunits. Imidazobenzodiazepine 9 (used as the prototypical alpha 5 selective ligand) inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding to hippocampal membranes with high- and low-affinity components (IC50 0.6 +/- 0.2 and 85.6 +/- 13.1 nM, respectively), representing approximately 16% and approximately 84% of the receptor pool. Inhibition of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebellar membranes with imidazobenzodiazepine 9 was best fitted to a single population of sites with an IC50 of 79.8 +/- 18.3 nM. These imidazobenzodiazepines behaved as GABA negative ligands in recombinant GABAA receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and were convulsant in mice after parenteral administration. The relative potencies of flumazenil and zolpidem in blocking convulsions induced by 9 and DMCM, respectively, indicated that occupation of alpha 5-containing GABAA receptors substantially contributed to the convulsant properties of acetylene analog 9. These 8-substituted imidazobenzodiazepines (5, 6, 8 and 9) should prove useful in examining the physiological roles of GABAA receptors bearing an alpha 5 subunit and may also lead to the development of novel, subtype selective therapeutic agents.", 
    "123": "The presence of allosteric binding sites on recombinant GABAA receptors formed after transfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with alpha 1-, beta 3-, or gamma 2-subunits, or with various combinations of these subunits, was systematically investigated. From all possible subunit combinations, high affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites were induced in cells transfected with alpha 1 beta 3- or alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2-subunits only. GABAA receptor associated [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites were induced in cells after transfection with alpha 1 gamma 2- or alpha 1 beta 3, gamma 2-subunits, and [35S]r-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding sites were found in cells transfected with beta 3-, beta 3 gamma 2-, alpha 1 beta 3-, or alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2-subunits. Binding of [35S]TBPS could be inhibited by pentobarbital, etazolate, (+)-etomidate, alphaxalone, propofol, chlormethiazole, and 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro 5-4864) with a potency which differed in cells transfected with beta 3-, beta 3 gamma 2-, alpha 1 beta 3-, or alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2-subunits. Results obtained indicate that receptors with different subunit composition actually can be formed in HEK cells and exhibit distinct pharmacological properties.", 
    "124": "Some studies have suggested that drug tolerance observed following repeated benzodiazepine exposure may be associated with the development of a subsensitivity to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in dorsal raphe and hippocampal neurons. In other areas such as the substantia nigra such subsensitivity has not been found. The aim of the present study was to determine whether tolerance develops to the ataxic effects of diazepam on the righting reflex following low (i.e. 2 mg/kg i.p.), multiple daily doses and, if so, whether it is correlated with the development of a subsensitivity of medial vestibular nucleus neurons to the selective GABAA receptor agonist, isoguvacine. Guinea pigs which received i.p. vehicle injections three times daily for 5 days, or single daily doses of 2 or 6 mg/kg diazepam, showed increased righting reflex latencies in response to a 6 mg/kg diazepam challenge dose. However, guinea pigs which received 2 mg/kg diazepam i.p., three times daily for 5 days, exhibited minimal or no ataxia when given the same diazepam challenge dose, indicating the development of tolerance. Brain stem slices including the medial vestibular nucleus were removed from guinea pigs which had received the same diazepam and vehicle three times daily injection schedules, and recordings were made from single neurons during superfusion of isoguvacine. Although medial vestibular nucleus neurons from animals which received chronic diazepam administration showed smaller decreases in firing rate in response to 10(-8) M isoguvacine, the difference was not statistically significant compared to neurons from animals which received vehicle treatment or acute diazepam treatment. Resting activity was also similar between the diazepam and vehicle groups, in contrast to a previous study which had shown hyperexcitability in medial vestibular nucleus cells from animals which had received single daily injections for up to 60 days. These results suggest that, in contrast to studies which have employed single daily doses, tolerance to the ataxic effects of diazepam on the righting reflex occurs rapidly with divided daily doses. However, this tolerance is not correlated with significant changes in the sensitivity of GABAA receptors on medial vestibular nucleus neurons.", 
    "125": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in the brain were studied in association with epileptic seizures using EL mice, an animal model of epilepsy, and DDY mice as controls. Ro 5-4864 (i.p.), a specific agonist for PBR, elicited tonic-clonic convulsions in EL mice 2.6-times more potently than in DDY mice with CD50s of 11.9 and 31.2 mg/kg for EL and DDY mice, respectively. In contrast, pentylenetetrazole (i.p.) exerted convulsant actions on EL and DDY mice in a less differential way with CD50s of 29.2 and 48.1 mg/kg for EL and DDY mice, respectively. PK 11195 (i.v.), a specific antagonist for PBR, raised seizure thresholds of EL mice at a dose of 2 mg/kg. Binding assay revealed a 50% higher density of [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding sites in the mitochondrial fraction isolated from the cerebrum of EL mice in comparison with DDY mice. Similarly, a 40% higher density of [3H]flunitrazepam binding was observed in the mitochondrial fraction of EL mice. The results support the hypothesis that PBR, particularly those associated with mitochondria, are involved in the pathogenesis of epileptic seizures in EL mice."
