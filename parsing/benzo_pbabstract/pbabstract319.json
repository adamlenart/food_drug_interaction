The GABA ratio of 1.03 for [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to cerebral cortex, 0.76 for cerebellum, 0.7 for hippocampus, 0.7 for striatum, and 0.8 for spinal cord indicated an antagonistic or weak inverse agonistic profile of 6-methyl-3'-bromoflavone on BDZ-bs. Unlike classical benzodiazepines, it had no anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, myorelaxant, sedative, amnestic or motor incoordination effects. However, it antagonized the muscle relaxant, the sedative effect, and the changes in locomotor activity induced by diazepam. Taken together, these findings suggest that 6-methyl-3'-bromoflavone has an antagonistic profile on the BDZ-bs.", 
    "1": "Alterations of 'peripheral-type' benzodiazepine receptors (PTBRs) in brain are a feature of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Although ammonia toxicity has been implicated in the disorder, recent findings suggest an accumulation of manganese in the brains of cirrhotic patients dying in hepatic coma. In this study, we examined the expression of PTBRs as well as the binding of the selective PTBR ligand 3H-PK 11195 in cultured astrocytes following chronic exposure to manganese. When astrocytes were exposed to 100 microM manganese for 1 week, a 57% increase in Bmax for 3H-PK 11195 binding was detected (P < 0.01) with no change in the Kd value. However, an examination by RT-PCR of the expression of the isoquinoline-binding moiety of the PTBR complex in these cells revealed no change in PTBR mRNA levels following manganese treatment. These findings suggest that manganese up-regulates 3H-PK 11195 binding sites by a process which does not involve a change in transcription. In view of the proposed role of astrocytic PTBRs in 'neurosteroid' synthesis, manganese-induced increases of PTBRs could contribute to the pathogenesis of HE.", 
    "2": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are prescribed alone and in combination with other psychotropic medications in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. Such combinations create the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions by affecting the activity of the cytochromes P450 (CYP450), drug metabolizing oxidative enzymes. SSRIs are not equivalent in their potential for interactions when combined with other central nervous system (CNS) medication. Generally citalopram and sertraline are characterized by weaker inhibition of CYP450 enzymes and, therefore, hold less potential for interaction than the other SSRIs. Paroxetine potently inhibits CYP2D6, which can result in increased neuroleptic serum concentrations, accompanied by increased CNS side-effects. Similarly, as a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, fluoxetine can increase serum concentrations of neuroleptics and antidepressants and numerous case reports have documented concomitant adverse events. Fluoxetine also inhibits CYP3A and CYP2C19, increasing serum concentrations of some benzodiazepines. Fluvoxamine is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A and a mild inhibitor of CYP2D6. Therefore, interactions with clozapine and benzodiazepines are evident.", 
    "3": "Panic disorder is a serious and common illness affecting 1% of the population at any one time. Comorbidity with depression may be as high as 40%. The illness has been recognized as a separate entity since the 1960s and treatment with tricyclics being used since that time. Tricyclics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines, beta-blockers and anticonvulsants have all been used with varying degrees of success. Until recently, tricyclics and benzodiazepines were the treatments of choice but selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have recently been studied intensively and, based on studies of citalopram and paroxetine, must now be considered first line therapy. Both SSRIs and tricyclics suffer from a long latency period, possibly as long as 12 weeks before maximal benefit is obtained, which is in contrast to the benzodiazepines that produce almost instant symptom relief. The dependency potential of the benzodiazepines, however, limits their usefulness. Paroxetine and citalopram have good efficacy data over both the short and long term and are effective at standard dosages, the most effective for citalopram being 20-30 mg. Both drugs performed better than the comparator tricyclic antidepressant (chlomipramine) and must now be considered current drugs of choice. Despite the superior efficacy of these drugs, however, many patients are poorly controlled and investigation of combination therapies for resistant panic disorder is needed.", 
    "4": "Treatment with diazepam (25 mg/kg; p.o., twice-daily for 17 days) induced tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam against bicuculline-induced convulsions in mice. Cross-tolerance was observed to the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam, imidazenil but not abecarnil. While substitution of clonazepam (12 mg/kg; p.o., twice-daily for 15 days) for diazepam did not affect tolerance to diazepam, substitution of imidazenil (17 mg/kg; p.o., twice-daily for 15 days) for diazepam significantly increased sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam, although tolerance was not abolished. Tolerance to diazepam progressively decreased either after suspension of diazepam administration or replacement treatment with abecarnil (20 mg/kg; p.o., twice-daily). Complete recovery of diazepam efficacy was detected after 8 and 15 days of administration of abecarnil and vehicle, respectively. Binding experiments using [3H]-flumazenil showed that Kd values did not differ among treatment groups. A significant decrease in Bmax (-42%) was observed in the cortex of diazepam-tolerant mice whether or not also treated with imidazenil and clonazepam. Conversely, chronically diazepam-treated mice, that further received abecarnil for either 8 or 15 days or vehicle for 15 days showed Bmax values similar to those of vehicle-treated mice never exposed to diazepam. Results suggest that repeated abecarnil administration to diazepam-tolerant mice can facilitate re-adaptation of receptors to the diazepam-free state. It is proposed that replacement therapy with abecarnil after long-term treatment with conventional benzodiazepines (BDZs) may provide a novel approach for reducing tolerance to their anticonvulsant effects.", 
    "5": "Granule cell axon terminals of rat cerebellum possess benzodiazepine-insensitive GABA(A) receptors mediating glutamate release. We have investigated the ability of benzodiazepines, ethanol and furosemide to modulate the function of these receptors in the cerebellum of alcohol-tolerant (AT) and alcohol-nontolerant (ANT) rats. AT and ANT synaptosomes, prelabeled with [3H]D-aspartate, were superfused with GABA and various drugs during the K+ -depolarization. GABA similarly enhanced [3H]D-aspartate overflow in AT (EC50 = 1.7 microM) and ANT (EC50 = 3.9 microM) rats in a bicuculline-sensitive manner. Diazepam or zolpidem, at 0.1 microM, potentiated GABA at the GABA(A) receptor of ANT rats, but were ineffective at the AT receptor. Zolpidem acted with great potency (EC50 = 13.6 nM). Ethanol, added at 50 mM, potentiated GABA in ANT rats, but it was inactive at the GABA(A) receptor of the AT cerebellum. Furosemide significantly inhibited the effect of GABA in ANT, but not in AT synaptosomes. Our results show that one GABA(A) receptor (the receptor sited on granule cell terminals which mediates glutamate release) exhibits functional responses to diazepam and ethanol that differ between AT and ANT rats. However, the data with zolpidem and furosemide differ from previous results obtained with membranes of the granule cell layer suggesting that distinct GABA(A) receptor subtypes may exist on axon terminals versus soma/dendrites of granule cells.", 
    "6": "To identify the GABAergic inhibitory mechanisms involved in inspiratory termination or off-switching (IOS), the effects of a specific enhancer of GABA(A) receptors, midazolam, and an antagonist, bicuculline, on vagally evoked inspiratory inhibitions and IOS were investigated in decerebrate cats. Stimulation of vagal afferents at late inspiration provoked either reversible inspiratory inhibition or IOS, depending on the stimulus intensity. Each response occurred at a constant latency (phase 1). The reversible response was triphasic, consisting of an early (phase 2) inhibition, a brief (phase 3) excitation and a late (phase 4) inhibition in the phrenic neurogram, and early (phase 2) IPSPs, brief (phase 3) EPSPs and late (phase 4) IPSPs in bulbar inspiratory (I) neurones. With an increasing stimulus intensity, phase 4 inhibitions were increased in amplitude and duration, leading to IOS. Midazolam (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) increased more selectively phase 4 IPSPs than phase 2 IPSPs in I neurones, and decreased the threshold for evoking IOS by producing an earlier and larger phase 4 IPSPs. Bicuculline (1.0 mg/kg i.v.) had an opposite effect. These results suggest that the late inhibitory response evoked by vagal stimulation in the I neuronal pool organizes an initial phase of IOS which is mediated by GABA(A) receptors.",

It is significantly easier to reach a desired level of sedation with lorazepam than with midazolam. No difference in recovery was found in the 24 hrs after discontinuation of therapy. The fact that there are many factors influencing midazolam pharmacokinetics may explain the more difficult management of desired sedation levels.

    "16": "Temporal processing of intervals in the range of seconds or more is cognitively mediated, whereas processing of brief durations below 500 msec appears to be based on brain mechanisms outside cognitive control. To elucidate the critical role of various neurotransmitters in timing processes in humans, the effects of 3 mg of haloperidol, a dopamine receptor antagonist, 11 mg of the benzodiazepine midazolam, and 1 mg of scopolamine, a cholinergic receptor antagonist, were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind experiment. In addition, changes in cortical arousal, semantic memory, and cognitive and motor skill acquisition were assessed. Temporal processing of long durations was significantly impaired by haloperiodol and midazolam, whereas processing of extremely brief intervals was only affected by haloperidol. The overall pattern of results supports the notion that temporal processing of longer intervals is mediated by working-memory functions and, therefore, any pharmacological treatment, irrespective of the neurotransmitter system involved, that produces a deterioration of working memory, may interfere with temporal processing of longer intervals. Temporal processing of intervals in the range of milliseconds appears to depend on the effective level of dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia.", 
    "17": "This study explores the usefulness of relaxation and gradual medication withdrawal in weaning insomniacs from sleep (hypnotic) medication. We recruited 40 volunteers from the community who had insomnia, half of whom were chronic users of hypnotics while the other half were nonmedicated. Half of all participants (10 medicated and 10 nonmedicated) received progressive relaxation. All medicated participants received a standard gradual drug withdrawal program. Medicated participants reduced sleep medication consumption by nearly 80%. Participants who received relaxation obtained additional benefits in sleep efficiency, rated quality of sleep, and reduced withdrawal symptoms. Medicated and nonmedicated participants attained comparable, improved sleep by posttreatment and follow-up. Hypnotic withdrawal was accompanied by serious worsening of insomnia, but this dissipated by the end of the withdrawal period. The psychological treatment of hypnotic-dependent insomnia has high potential for making an important clinical contribution.",

DATA EXTRACTION/DATA SYNTHESIS: Reports of the use of GHB, flunitrazepam, and ketamine in acquaintance rape appear in the medical literature and lay press. Many health care professionals may not be familiar with these medications, and information about caring for patients under their influence is limited. Victims lose their ability to ward off attackers, develop amnesia, and are unreliable witnesses. Because symptoms caused by these agents mimic those of alcohol, not all victims are screened for their presence. Legislative efforts to further limit the use of or access to GHB, flunitrazepam, and ketamine have been initiated at the state and federal levels. Pharmacists should know the symptoms of exposure to the three agents; they should understand treatment regimens, methods to detect the presence of these and other drugs that may have been used in a sexual assault, and techniques individuals can use to avoid becoming victims of drug-assisted acquaintance rape.",

SE is a frequent medical emergency with a high mortality, requiring aggressive and prompt treatment and a systematic, coordinated approach. A variety of new drugs has been introduced for the treatment of SE, including midazolam, propofol, fosphenytoin, and valproate. However, there are very few controlled clinical trials. Benzodiazepines are highly effective in terminating the SE in most patients and should be used as initial treatment. Phenytoin and Phenobarbital are employed if Benzodiazepines are not successful. The optimal therapeutic approach for the patient with refractory SE remains to be defined. Refractory SE has a poor prognosis and should be treated in a specialized ICU with EEG-monitoring. Barbiturates, propofol, and midazolam are substances that can be used alternatively.",

In the present study both structural and solvent effects were investigated on the energetics of ring inversion of nine diazepine derivatives. The calculated ring inversion barriers for diazepam (17.6 kcal/mol) and N(1)-desmethyldiazepam (10.9 kcal/mol) are in good agreement with the corresponding experimental data.

Most of the ligands synthesized exhibited potent biological activity in vitro. Among them, 3 ligands exhibited enhanced affinity for the alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2 subtype in comparison to the other subtypes, six ligands demonstrated higher affinity for the alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 2 subtype, while 2 ligands showed some enhanced affinity for the alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 subtype. The remainder of the ligands exhibited relatively higher affinities at the alpha 1 containing subtype. To map out the steric and electronic differences between the benzodiazepine binding subtypes, a QSAR analysis by the method of Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) of each receptor subtypes was carried out.", 
    "35": "Binding affinities of a series of 44 beta-carbolines with various substituents at the 3-, 4-, 6- and 7-positions are reported at 5 distinct recombinant GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor (BzR) subtypes [alpha x beta 3 gamma 2 (x = 1-3, 5, 6)]. Many of these ligands displayed better selectivity for the alpha 1 containing GABAA isoform. The most selective BCCT 2 and SPH 195 (17) displayed potent affinity (Ki = 0.72 and 7.2 nM for the alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 receptor subtype, respectively) and an overall selectivity of 20 and 23 fold, respectively, for the alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 receptor subtype. These are the most selective ligands in vitro for the alpha 1 containing GABAA/Bz receptor isoform reported to date to our knowledge. QSAR studies of these ligands for each receptor subtype have been carried out via a Comparative Molecular Field Analysis (CoMFA) and an included volume analysis. Geometries and charge distributions of these ligands have been optimized using ab initio methods (J. Med. Chem., 1992, 35, 4001-4010). Active conformations of flexible 3-alkoxylated beta-carbolines have been examined via a CoMFA approach. QSAR studies via CoMFA support the previous hypothesis that beta-carbolines with different intrinsic activities may follow an alternative alignment rule when they bind into the pharmacophore/receptor site of the BzR. Examination of binding affinities of beta-carbolines by this modeling strategy has established some of the differences, in particular, topologic differences between the lipophilic pockets in the alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 3 gamma 2 subtypes as well as some of the similarities among the pharmacophore/receptor models of these five distinct GABAA/Bz receptor subtypes.",

    "40": "Patients may find bronchoscopy without sedation unpleasant. There is some evidence that patient satisfaction correlates with amnesia for the procedure. For several years we have used doses of midazolam sufficient to put patients lightly asleep hoping to produce complete amnesia. We looked at practical aspects of this technique over a 2-year period. We studied 337 consecutive patients. They were 219 men and 118 women of mean age 63 +/- 12.4 (SD). Sixty-seven patients were aged 75 years or over and the eldest was 86. Sixty-three patients were already hospital inpatients but the remainder were seen as day cases. Midazolam was given by slow i.v. injection over several minutes until the patient was judged to be lightly asleep. Patients were given supplemental oxygen (3 l min-1) and monitored by ECG and pulse oximetry. A note was made of the time at which they awakened, defined as when nursing staff felt the patients were awake enough to have a cup of tea and toast. Patients were asked if they had any memory of the procedure both on awakening and when seen a few days later to discuss the results. The procedures were carried out in a well-staffed Day Case Unit with a recovery area. The mean dose of midazolam used was 10.8 mg (mean +/- SD = 0.16 +/- 0.095 mg kg-1). The midazolam was given over a median of 4 min (range 1-15 min). Patients took 59 +/- 45 min (mean +/- SD) to wake up. Twenty-eight patients were given flumazanil to reverse the sedation (11 for concern over bleeding following biopsies, three for desaturation during and three after procedure, four as they were frail, two as they were restless, two as they were hypotensive after procedure and three for miscellaneous reasons). Only nine patients could remember any part of the procedure. Incremental doses of midazolam given slowly until patients are lightly asleep almost invariably produce complete amnesia for bronchoscopy. This is a safe technique but patients need careful monitoring and may require reversal of sedation with flumazanil.", 
    "41": "Midazolam is widely used as a sedative agent to produce amnesia in patients undergoing fibre-optic bronchoscopy. However, if a patient does not receive sufficient local anaesthesia, continuous severe cough and physical movement may interrupt the procedure and reduce its safety. We therefore examined whether codeine phosphate is a useful premedication for bronchoscopy. The study design was a randomized comparison between codeine phosphate and a placebo in patients undergoing light local anaesthesia and midazolam sedation. We used low dose local anaesthesia (5 ml of nebulized 2% xylocaine) on the assumption of insufficient local anaesthesia. Patients were allocated to receive codeine phosphate 0.4 mg kg-1 or a saline placebo 60 min before they were sedated with i.v. midazolam. If the patients exhibited severe cough during bronchoscopy, intrabronchial supplemental local anaesthesia (2% xylocaine solution in 1 ml increments) was instilled via a bronchoscope to the trachea and segmental bronchi to suppress the cough. The dose of supplemental xylocaine was assessed and the requirements were significantly lower in the codeine group compared to the placebo group: 36.4 +/- 10.2 mg vs. 95.1 +/- 24.6 mg, respectively. After bronchoscopy, patients were interviewed by a doctor to assess their willingness to undergo a repeat procedure if one was clinically indicated, but no significant difference was observed between the two groups. If local anaesthesia is insufficient, midazolam together with codeine phosphate premedication is useful for both the patient and the bronchoscopist.", 
    "42": "The saliva level of free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) in 16 outpatients with anxiety disorders was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The anxiety level of the patients was scored by the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAS) before and after a one-week drug treatment with alprazolam. The saliva level of free-MHPG at the subjects' first visit to the hospital was significantly higher than that of the control subjects and was reduced by the one-week alprazolam treatment. The post-treatment level of MHPG in patients who showed good response to the treatment was significantly less than the pretreatment level, but there was no significant difference between pre- and post-treatment levels of MHPG in poor responders. There was no correlation between the MHPG level and the HAS score at the first hospital visit. The MHPG levels after the treatment correlated with the HAS scores. The reduction of the anxiety level as scored by the HAS correlated with the reduction of the MHPG level. These results indicate that the free saliva MHPG level may be a useful indicator for assessing not only the level of anxiety but also the response to drug treatment for anxiety in these patients.",

Hamsters treated with the higher (2.0 and 3.0 mg kg-1 day-1) doses of diazepam exhibited: 1) increased granuloma areas in the liver (C = 1.81 +/- 1.39, E2 = 10.29 +/- 4.64 and E3 = 15.80 +/- 4.82) and lung (C = 0.54 +/- 0.55, E2 = 6.28 +/- 3.85 and E3 = 6.31 +/- 3.56) and 2) increased scores of M. bovis colony-forming units isolated from liver (C = 2.0, E2 = 3.0 and E3 = 3.5), lung (C = 1.0, E2 = 3.0 and E3 = 3.5) and spleen (C = 1.0, E2 = 2.5 and E3 = 4.0). These effects were dose dependent, and were not detected or were less severe in animals treated with the lowest (1.0 mg/kg) dose of diazepam as well as in those of the control group. Furthermore, diazepam treatment (3.0 mg kg-1 day-1 for 30 days) increased (E3 = 71.32 +/- 2.99; N = 10) the serum levels of cortisol compared to control hamsters (C = 22.61 +/- 2.75; N = 10). The present data, that demonstrate an impaired defense against M. bovis in adult hamsters treated with diazepam, were tentatively explained on the basis of a direct and/or indirect action of diazepam on the cytokine network. The effects may be related to stimulation of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding sites (PBR) by macrophages and/or lymphocytes, or they may be mediated by PBR stimulation of the adrenals.",

    "46": "Increased excitation in the central nervous system during a 2-week withdrawal period after 4-day and 4-week treatments with diazepam and lorazepam was examined with an EEG threshold method in male rats. Increased excitation was measured as a decreased sensitivity to hexobarbital (i.e., increased threshold doses). The concentrations of hexobarbital in two different brain regions, serum, fat and muscle tissue after 4-week treatment with diazepam were determined with a high-pressure liquid chromatography method.", 
    "47": "The duration of withdrawal was influenced by the duration of treatment but the maximum level of withdrawal excitation was similar for both drugs. Equieffective doses of diazepam (20 mg/kg) and lorazepam (2 mg/kg) induced similar patterns of withdrawal excitability after both treatments. The brain concentrations of hexobarbital were significantly higher on Days 1 and 3 of withdrawal after diazepam treatment. Significant correlations between the threshold doses and brain concentrations were found on Day 1, but these correlations disappeared on day 3. At the same time, a difference between the concentrations of hexobarbital in different brain areas emerged.", 
    "48": "The duration of treatment had a minor influence on the pattern of withdrawal excitation. Equieffective doses of diazepam and lorazepam induced comparable withdrawal excitability indicating no significant difference in their potential to induce physical dependence. The time-dependent change in the hexobarbital concentrations in the brain suggests that withdrawal excitation after diazepam treatment is a complex phenomenon probably involving several different systems at different times.", 
    "49": "Whether or not olanzapine causes bone marrow toxicity is still a matter of debate. In spite of pre-marketing and post-marketing clinical trials, and although there have been no cases in animals of olanzapine-induced neutropenia or agranulocytosis, the risk of bone marrow toxicity cannot be excluded. The present paper addresses the following questions: what is the potential background of drug-induced agranulocytosis? Are there any case reports supporting the view that olanzapine has relevant bone marrow toxicity? What strategies might be helpful in identifying the pathological mechanisms underlying this side effect?", 
    "50": "Diazepam and other benzodiazepines impair episodic memory encoding. Deficits in tests of executive function are also reported. In this study, we ask whether the latter effects are secondary to mnemonic impairment, or reflect specific and distinct effects of benzodiazepines on executive function.", 
    "51": "Using positron emission tomography in healthy human volunteers, we examined similarities in the neuroanatomical correlates of the effect of diazepam on performance of executive compared to episodic memory tasks. Close similarities are proposed to reflect commonalities in the functional effects of the drug. Conversely, any evidence of task-specific regional changes in activity is proposed to reflect distinct functional effects of DZP on the two tasks.", 
    "52": "Twelve volunteers received placebo or 10 mg diazepam in a between-subjects design. During scanning, subjects performed one of four experimental conditions, corresponding to a 2x2 factorial design, with memory encoding and executive function (on-line ordering of stimuli) as the two factors. Drug- or task-induced changes in brain activation indexed the neuroanatomical correlates of each condition.", 
    "53": "Averaged across all conditions, and compared to placebo, diazepam decreased activity bilaterally in prefrontal and temporal cortices. Within this network of deactivation, left dorsal prefrontal cortex activity was attenuated by diazepam during memory encoding, while left frontal opercular activity was attenuated during ordering.", 
    "54": "This neuroanatomical dissociation reflects distinct functional effects of diazepam on encoding versus ordering tasks. Therefore, the effects of diazepam on ordering tasks are not simply secondary to diazepam effects on episodic memory, but reflect real and distinct effects of the drug on executive function.",

    "58": "Patients under midazolam read new mirror written words faster with practice, which attested for intact skill learning. Moreover, they read repeated words faster than new words with practice, which was interpreted as reflecting intact priming abilities. These spared implicit memory capacities were observed along with severe explicit memory impairments. Learning for both new and repeated mirror written words on day 2 was similar in patients and in controls, which was interpreted as suggesting that the implicit learning that occurred on day 1 under midazolam was normal.",

    "60": "mRNA encoding the recently cloned gamma-aminobuytyric acid(A) receptor (GABAR) pi subunit is expressed in the hippocampus and in several non-neuronal tissues including the uterus and ovaries. Whereas native GABARs are pentamers composed primarily of alphabetagamma, alphabetadelta, or alphabetaepsilon subunits, it has not been demonstrated clearly that the pi subunit incorporates into functional GABARs to form alphabetapi receptors and, if so, with what properties. We provide electrophysiological evidence that the pi subunit can coassemble with either alpha5beta3 or alpha5beta3gamma3 subunits to produce recombinant GABARs with distinct pharmacological and biophysical properties. Compared with alpha5beta3 receptors, GABARs produced by coexpression of alpha5beta3pi subunits had a lower GABA EC(50) value, were enhanced to a lesser extent by loreclezole, had different IC(50) values for pregnenolone sulfate and lanthanum, and were insensitive to benzodiazepines. Incorporation of both pi and gamma3 subunits into an alpha5beta3gamma3pi isoform was suggested by reduced enhancement by diazepam and a high zinc IC(50) value. Current-voltage relations for the alpha5beta3pi subunit combination outwardly rectified more than currents from alpha5beta3gamma3 but less than alpha5beta3 combination GABARs. Single-channel alpha5beta3 GABAR currents had a main conductance state of 15.2 picoSeimens (pS). Coexpression of the pi subunit with alpha5beta3 subtypes increased the conductance level to 23.8 pS, similar to the conductance level of alpha5beta3gamma3 GABARs (26.9 pS). We conclude that the pi subunit coassembles with alpha, beta, and gamma subunits to form functional alphabetapi or alphabetagammapi GABARs and, thus, could have a significant impact on the function of native GABARs expressed in the brain or non-neuronal tissue.", 
    "61": "The effects of ICV administration of metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone [i.e., neurosteroids: AP (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one, allopregnanolone), 5alpha(-THDOC (3alphat-21-dihydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one, 5alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone), 5beta-THDOC (3alpha-21-dihydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one, 5beta-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone), and PS (3beta-hydroxy-5-pregnen-20-one sulfate, pregnenolone sulfate] were studied in the open-field test of neophobia and Vogel's test of conflict behavior in rats. The influence of in vivo administered 5beta-THDOC, a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor complex, on 3H-muscimol binding in different brain structures, was also studied with the help of quantitative autoradiography. The presented data did not reveal any anxioselective effects for a range of centrally active neurosteroids, in the ethologically orientated and conflict models of anxiety, after intracerebral drug administration. Their central effects appeared secondary to changes in rat gross behavior. It is possible that high local concentration of neurosteroids after ICV injection and production of a narrower range of behavioral effects than that of benzodiazepines, precluded manifestation of the antianxiety effects of AP, 5alpha-THDOC and 5beta-THDOC. Autoradiography did not reveal any significant changes in the specific binding of 3H-muscimol in brain structures after in vivo ICV administration of 5beta-THDOC at the behaviorally active dose. Thus, the possibility that neuroactive neurosteroids may provide a novel potential site for therapeutic interventions in anxiety disorders is not supported. The part of the experiment with 5beta-THDOC is interpreted as contributing to other results, suggesting the existence of a new category of neurosteroids acting as partial agonists of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "62": "Anticonvulsant properties of some 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives acting as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) antagonists have been examined in vivo in the genetically epilepsy-prone rats using an audiogenic seizures assay. 2,3-Benzodiazepin-4-ones (CFMs) are nonselective AMPA antagonists that have been found to be potent anticonvulsant compound is in acute models of epilepsy. Because very little is known about their actions in a chronic model of epilepsy, and no correlations exist between anticonvulsant potency and plasma levels of these derivatives, we planned to investigate such a relationship. Maximal anticonvulsant protection occurred 15-60 min after the IP administration of GYKI 52466, 30-90 min after CFM-2, and 45-120 min after CFM-3. In addition, maximal anticonvulsant effect was observed 60-120 min after the IP administration of CFM-4 and at 90 min after CFM-5. The therapeutic index revealed that GYKI 52466 was slightly more toxic than CFM-2 and CFM-3. The time course of plasma levels of rats treated showed that peak plasma concentration was observed 45 min after IP administration of CFM-2 and CFM-3 and 75 min after CFM-4 and CFM-5. Following IP administration of CFM-3 two curves were detected, one is referred to the injected compound, and the other to its demethylated metabolite, which corresponds to CFM-2. Also. for the nitroderivative CFM-4 two curves were detected: one of an injected compound and the second due to its reduced metabolite (CFM-2). Finally, three different metabolites were detected in rat plasma after IP administration of CFM-5. The present study demonstrated that CFMs showed a significant protection against auditory stimulation during the period of peak plasma concentrations, suggesting a marked inhibition of those brain structures involved in the initiation and/or spreading of the audiogenic seizures.", 
    "63": "Anxiolytic properties of melatonin in rodents had usually been examined in behavioral tests based on stressful situations, i.e., in animal models of \"state\" anxiety. However, no study reports effects of melatonin on emotionality of rodents submitted to situations devoid of stressful components as in the free-exploratory test, which gives to animals the opportunity to choose freely between familiar and unfamiliar places. This procedure has been proposed as a method for measuring an endogenous form of anxiety called \"trait\" anxiety. The present study first investigated the effects of melatonin on neophobic responses of male C57BL/6, C3H/He, and BALB/c mice submitted to a free-exploratory test. Results demonstrated that melatonin had no effect in C57BL/6 mice that presented very low neophobic responses, whereas it was effective in reducing neophobia of BALB/c and C3H/He mice that presented, respectively, strong and intermediate avoidance responses towards unfamiliarity. Indeed, mice of both latter strains treated with melatonin made fewer attempts to enter into the unfamiliar compartment, exhibited a lower latency of the first entry into the unfamiliar places, and spent more time in them. Thus, melatonin appeared to be equally effective in reducing \"trait\" anxiety in both BALB/c and C3H/He mice. Moreover, flumazenil was able to counteract, in a dose-dependent manner, the anxiolytic activity of melatonin in BALB/c, suggesting involvement of central GABAergic system in the pharmacological effects of melatonin.", 
    "64": "The benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist has been shown to produce agonist-like effects at low concentrations. RU34347 has both inverse agonist (attenuation of GABA-responses) and agonist-like (reduction of spontaneous Purkinje cell firing rate) in the cerebellar slice preparation. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil prevented the inverse agonist actions, but only partially reduced the agonist-like effects. Further, brief application of RU34347 to slices mimicked the response to GABA, and pharmacological investigation determined that this action was mediated through increased GABA through action at a site proximal to the parallel fiber-basket cell synapse, at an as yet undetermined receptor.", 
    "65": "This preliminary study examines the effectiveness and safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for the treatment of panic disorder in children and adolescents. In a prospective open label study, 12 children and adolescents with panic disorder were treated with SSRIs, and if necessary, with benzodiazepines, for a period of 6-8 weeks and were followed for approximately 6 months. During the trial, clinician-based and self-report rating scales for anxiety and depression, functioning, and side effects, were administered. Using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGIS) 75% of patients showed much to very much improvement with SSRIs without experiencing significant side effects. After controlling for changes in depressive symptoms, self-report and clinician-based anxiety scales also showed significant improvement. At the end of the trial, 67% of patients no longer fulfilled criteria for panic disorder and 4 patients remained with significant residual symptoms. In conclusion, SSRIs appear to be a safe and promising for the treatment of children and adolescents with panic disorder, however, randomized controlled trials evaluating the effects of SSRIs and other interventions (e.g., cognitive therapy) for treating panic disorder in children and adolescents are warranted. It appears that until the SSRIs begin to exert their effects, a benzodiazepine adjunct treatment might be helpful for patients with severe panic disorder.", 
    "66": "The gastric cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-BR) is a key regulator of enterochromaffin-like cell function and proliferation. Over the last decade, a number of small non-peptide CCK-BR \"antagonists\" have been discovered. Here, we demonstrate that some of these non-peptide ligands in fact possess significant ability to activate the human CCK-BR, and are, therefore, more properly categorized as partial agonists. When tested in COS-7 cells transiently expressing the recombinant human CCK-BR, saturating concentrations of the small \"peptoid\" ligands PD 135,158 and PD 136,450 stimulated inositol phosphate formation to 23 and 43 percent, respectively, of the maximum response induced by a considerably larger endogenous peptide agonist, cholecystokinin octapeptide. In contrast, the benzodiazepine-derived CCK-BR ligand, YM022, acted as a \"true\" high-affinity antagonist of cholecystokinin-induced inositol phosphate formation (pA2 = 9.69). Consistent with recent findings in animal experiments, our data reveal that small synthetic ligands have the potential to function as either CCK-BR agonists or antagonists. These dual properties of synthetic molecules must be considered when evaluating candidate drugs for human disease.", 
    "67": "We examined the effects of a newly synthesized gastrin receptor antagonist, AG-041R, on the growth of enterochromaffin-like (ECL) carcinoid tumors in Mastomys natalensis both in vitro and in vivo. AG-041R was as potent as the well known gastrin antagonist L365,260 in inhibiting not only the gastrin-induced release of histamine from but also histidine decarboxylase (HDC) gene expression in the ECL carcinoid tumor cells. AG-041R also inhibited gastrin-induced DNA synthesis and c-fos gene expression in the tumor cells. Furthermore, AG-041R significantly inhibited the growth of the transplanted Mastomys ECL carcinoid tumors in vivo. From these data, it is concluded that endogenous gastrin is involved in the growth of ECL carcinoid tumors in Mastomys natalensis. Moreover, AG-041R is shown to have a potential as an anti-neoplastic agent for ECL carcinoid tumor of the stomach.", 
    "68": "In the oxyntic mucosa of the mammalian stomach, histamine is stored in ECL cells and in mucosal mast cells. In the rat, at least 80 percent of oxyntic mucosal histamine resides in the ECL cells. Histamine is a key factor in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. Following depletion of ECL-cell histamine by treatment with alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (alpha-FMH), basal acid secretion was reduced, and gastrin-stimulated acid secretion was abolished. Vagally-induced acid secretion (by insulin injection or pylorus ligation) was unaffected by alpha-FMH treatment but inhibited by an H2 antagonist. These results suggest that gastrin stimulates acid secretion via release of ECL-cell histamine, whereas vagally-induced acid secretion--although histamine-dependent--does not rely on ECL-cell histamine. Gastrin is known to have a trophic effect on the oxyntic mucosa. By combining long-term hypergastrinemia with continuous infusion of alpha-FMH, we were able to show that gastrin-evoked trophic effects in the stomach do not depend on ECL-cell histamine.", 
    "69": "Activities of testosterone, nifedipine, and midazolam oxidation by recombinant cytochrome P-450 (P-450) 3A4 coexpressed with human NADPH-P-450 reductase (NPR) in bacterial membranes (CYP3A4/NPR membranes) were determined in comparison with those of other recombinant systems and of human liver microsomes with high contents of CYP3A4. Growth conditions for Escherichia coli transformed with the bicistronic construct affected expression levels of CYP3A4 and NPR; an excess of NPR over P-450 in membrane preparations enhanced CYP3A4-dependent testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activities of the CYP3A4/NPR membranes. Cytochrome b(5) (b(5)) and apolipoprotein b(5) further enhanced the testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activities of CYP3A4/NPR membranes after addition to either bacterial membranes or purified enzymes. NPR was observed to enhance catalytic activity when added to the CYP3A4/NPR membranes, either in the form of bacterial membranes or as purified NPR (in combination with cholate and b(5)). Apparent maximal activities of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation in CYP3A4/NPR membranes were obtained when the molar ratio of CYP3A4/NPR/b(5) was adjusted to 1:2:1 by mixing membranes containing each protein. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation, nifedipine oxidation, and midazolam 4- and 1'-hydroxylation activities in CYP3A4/NPR membranes plus b(5) systems were similar to those measured with microsomes of insect cells coexpressing CYP3A4 with NPR and/or of human liver microsomes, based on equivalent CYP3A4 contents. These results suggest that CYP3A4/NPR membrane systems containing b(5) are very useful models for prediction of the rates for liver microsomal CYP3A4-dependent drug oxidations.",

    "72": "ApoE-deficient and control mice were used. The baseline EEG activity and EEG response to a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, scopolamine (0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg) and a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg), were studied during ageing. In addition, the cortical and hippocampal ChAT activities were measured in aged mice. The baseline EEG activity and EEG response to scopolamine (0.05 and 0.2 mg/kg), and cortical ChAT activity, were studied after quisqualic acid-induced unilateral NB lesion.", 
    "73": "The baseline EEG fast wave activity (relative alpha and beta) was higher in apoE-deficient mice. Ageing decreased relative alpha activity similarly in both strains. The scopolamine induced EEG slowing was less prominent in apoE-deficient than in control mice, and the difference between the strains became slightly clearer during ageing. The NB lesion failed to produce more severe changes in cortical EEG and ChAT activity in apoE-deficient mice. Cortical and hippocampal ChAT activity was equal in young and aged apoE-deficient and control mice. The EEG response to diazepam in young and aged mice was similar in both strains.", 
    "74": "The regulation of cortical EEG activity of apoE-deficient mice was somewhat altered during ageing and the response to scopolamine treatment was blunted. However, the cholinergic cells of the NB of apoE-deficient mice were not more sensitive to lesion or to ageing, suggesting that apoE does not have to be present to preserve the viability of cholinergic neurons.", 
    "75": "The hypothesis that antitussives containing ethylmorphine are abused by alcoholics and drug addicts and that this may lead to fatal poisonings where ethylmorphine causes or contributes to death was investigated. For this purpose 14 cases were analysed where a blood ethylmorphine concentration above the therapeutic level of >/= 0.3 microg/g was found in autopsy blood samples. Alcohol was found in 8 of the 14 cases and alcoholism or drug addiction was noted on 8 of the 14 death certificates. Other drugs, mostly benzodiazepines, were found in all 14 cases. The cause of death was fatal poisoning in 8 of the 14 cases and although there were no mono-intoxications, the cause of death was specified as fatal ethylmorphine poisoning in 2 cases. Among the unspecified medicinal drug poisonings there were five cases with very high blood levels of ethylmorphine, indicating that this drug played an important contribution to the cause of death. The results indicate that deaths due to ethylmorphine in antitussive medicines may occur among drug addicts and alcoholics taking it in overdose. Physicians should therefore be restrictive in prescribing cough mixtures containing ethylmorphine to these categories of patients. Prescription of large amounts of the drug should be avoided.", 
    "76": "This study used fluorescent indicator dyes to measure changes in cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca(2+)] produced by physiological stimulation of lizard motor nerve terminals. During repetitive action potential discharge at 10-50 Hz, the increase in average cytosolic [Ca(2+)] reached plateau at levels that increased with increasing stimulus frequency. This stabilization of cytosolic [Ca(2+)] was caused mainly by mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake, because drugs that depolarize mitochondria greatly increased the stimulation-induced elevation of cytosolic [Ca(2+)], whereas blockers of other Ca(2+) clearance routes had little effect. Surprisingly, during this sustained Ca(2+) uptake the free [Ca(2+)] in the mitochondrial matrix never exceeded a plateau level of approximately 1 microM, regardless of stimulation frequency or pattern. When stimulation ceased, matrix [Ca(2+)] decreased over a slow ( approximately 10 min) time course consisting of an initial plateau followed by a return to baseline. These measurements demonstrate that sustained mitochondrial Ca(2+) uptake is not invariably accompanied by progressive elevation of matrix free [Ca(2+)]. Both the plateau of matrix free [Ca(2+)] during stimulation and its complex decay after stimulation could be accounted for by a model incorporating reversible formation of an insoluble Ca salt. This mechanism allows mitochondria to sequester large amounts of Ca(2+) while maintaining matrix free [Ca(2+)] at levels sufficient to activate Ca(2+)-dependent mitochondrial dehydrogenases, but below levels that activate the permeability transition pore.", 
    "77": "Overactivation of ionotropic glutamate receptors has been implicated in the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury. Using an in vitro cell injury model, we examined the effects of stretch-induced traumatic injury on the AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors in cultured neonatal cortical neurons. Recordings made using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique revealed that a subpopulation of injured neurons exhibited an increased current in response to AMPA. The current-voltage relationship of these injured neurons showed an increased slope conductance but no change in reversal potential compared with uninjured neurons. Additionally, the EC(50) values of uninjured and injured neurons were nearly identical. Thus, current potentiation was not caused by changes in the voltage-dependence, ion selectivity, or apparent agonist affinity of the AMPA channel. AMPA-elicited current could also be fully inhibited by the application of selective AMPA receptor antagonists, thereby excluding the possibility that current potentiation in injured neurons was caused by the activation of other, nondesensitizing receptors. The difference in current densities between control and injured neurons was abolished when AMPA receptor desensitization was inhibited by the coapplication of AMPA and cyclothiazide or by the use of kainate as an agonist, suggesting that mechanical injury alters AMPA receptor desensitization. Reduction of AMPA receptor desensitization after brain injury would be expected to further exacerbate the effects of increased postinjury extracellular glutamate and contribute to trauma-related cell loss and dysfunctional synaptic information processing.", 
    "78": "Colocalization of GABA and glycine in synaptic terminals of the superficial dorsal horn raises the question of their relative contribution to inhibition of different classes of neurons in this area. To address this issue, miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) mediated via GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) and glycine receptors (GlyRs) were recorded from identified laminae I-II neurons in adult rat spinal cord slices. GABA(A)R-mediated mIPSCs had similar amplitude and rise times, but significantly slower decay kinetics than GlyR-mediated mIPSCs. Lamina I neurons appeared to receive almost exclusively GlyR-mediated mIPSCs, even after application of hypertonic solutions. Yet, all neurons responded to exogenous applications of both GABA and glycine, indicating that they expressed both GABA(A)Rs and GlyRs. Given that virtually all glycinergic interneurons also contain GABA, the possibility was examined that GABA(A)Rs may be located extrasynaptically in lamina I neurons. A slow GABA(A)R-mediated component was revealed in large, but not minimally evoked monosynaptic IPSCs. Administration of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam unmasked a GABA(A)R component to most mIPSCs, suggesting that both transmitters were released from the same vesicle. The isolated GABA(A)R component of these mIPSCs had rising kinetics 10 times slower than that of the GlyR component (or of GABA(A)R mIPSCs in lamina II). The slow GABA(A)R components were prolonged by GABA uptake blockers. It is concluded that, whereas GABA and glycine are likely released from the same vesicle of transmitter in lamina I, GABA(A)Rs appear to be located extrasynaptically. Thus, glycine mediates most of the tonic inhibition at these synapses. This differential distribution of GABA(A)Rs and GlyRs confers distinct functional properties to inhibition mediated by these two transmitters in lamina I.",

    "87": "Elderly people are more likely than younger patients to develop cognitive impairment as a result of taking medications. This reflects age- and disease-associated changes in brain neurochemistry and drug handling. Delirium (acute confusional state) is the cognitive disturbance most clearly associated with drug toxicity, but dementia has also been reported. The aetiology of cognitive impairment is commonly multifactorial, and it may be difficult to firmly establish a causal role for an individual medication. In studies of elderly hospital patients, drugs have been reported as the cause of delirium in 11 to 30% of cases. Medication toxicity occurs in 2 to 12% of patients presenting with suspected dementia. In some cases CNS toxicity occurs in a dose-dependent manner, often as a result of interference with neurotransmitter function. Drug-induced delirium can also occur as an idiosyncratic complication. Finally, delirium may occur secondary to iatrogenic complications of drug use. Almost any drug can cause delirium, especially in a vulnerable patient. Impaired cholinergic neurotransmission has been implicated in the pathogenesis of delirium and of Alzheimer's disease. Anticholinergic medications are important causes of acute and chronic confusional states. Nevertheless, polypharmacy with anticholinergic compounds is common, especially in nursing home residents. Recent studies have suggested that the total burden of anticholinergic drugs may determine development of delirium rather than any single agent. Also, anticholinergic effects have been identified in many drugs other than those classically thought of as having major anticholinergic effects. Psychoactive drugs are important causes of delirium. Narcotic agents are among the most important causes of delirium in postoperative patients. Long-acting benzodiazepines are the commonest drugs to cause or exacerbate dementia. Delirium was a major complication of treatment with tricyclic antidepressants but seems less common with newer agents. Anticonvulsants can cause delirium and dementia. Drug-induced confusion with nonpsychoactive drugs is often idiosyncratic in nature, and the diagnosis is easily missed unless clinicians maintain a high index of suspicion. Histamine H2 receptor antagonists, cardiac medications such as digoxin and beta-blockers, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and antibiotics can all cause acute, and, less commonly, chronic confusion. Drug-induced confusion can be prevented by avoiding polypharmacy and adhering to the saying 'start low and go slow'. Special care is needed when prescribing for people with cognitive impairment. Early diagnosis of drug-induced confusion, and withdrawal of the offending agent or agents is essential.", 
    "88": "Ten healthy men (mean age, 33.9 years) participated in two experimental sessions cross-overed randomly in a double-blind manner: one with the placebo and another with 0.125 mg of triazolam (TRZ). Resting electroencephalography and event-related potential under oddball paradigm were recorded before the drug administration, and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after that. P300 waveforms were analyzed by peak amplitudes and 30-ms bin data. Triazolam may cause cognitive dysfunction without general sedation or apparent sleepiness, and this effect appeared 2 h, 4 h and 6 h, most prominently 6 h, after TRZ administration.", 
    "89": "Liver phospholipid concentrations were determined in rats after the administration of diazepam (5 mg/Kg/day), for a period of two months. Increased concentrations of total phospholipids (P < 0.05), phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.05) and phosphatidylinositol (P < 0.05) were found in the rats taking diazepam. In contrast, a decreased concentration of phosphatidylserine (P < 0.01) was observed in the same group of animals. In addition, changes in the concentration of rat liver mitochondrial phospholipids after the administration of diazepam during the same period of time were determined. Increased concentrations of total phospholipids (P < 0.01), phosphatidylcholine (P < 0.001) and diphosphatidylglycerol (P < 0.001) were found in the rats treated with diazepam. In contrast, decreased phosphatidylserine (P < 0.001) and phosphatidylinositol (P < 0.01) concentrations were observed in the same group of animals. The considerable changes observed in liver phospholipids and individual classes of liver mitochondrial phospholipids induced by long-term administration of diazepam, possibly suggest a stimulation of liver phospholipid biosynthesis. This effect may be related to enzymatic systems which are involved in phospholipid pathways, and are linked to benzodiazepinergic binding sites.", 
    "90": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are responsible for mitochondrial cholesterol uptake, the rate limiting step of steroidiogenesis. They have been shown to be increased after acute stress, and decreased during exposure to chronic stressful conditions, and in patients with generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. In view of the proven connection between adolescent suicidal behavior and stress, we hypothesized that PBR may be decreased in the suicidal adolescent population.", 
    "91": "We measured [3H] PK 11195 binding to platelet membrane in nine adolescent (age 13-20 years) inpatients with a history of at least three suicidal attempts and ten age-matched psychiatric inpatients with no history of suicide attempts. Suicidality was assessed with the Suicide Risk Scale (SRS), and symptom severity with the Beck Depression Inventory, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Overt Aggression Scale (OAS), and Impulsivity Scale (IS).", 
    "92": "Suicide Risk Scale scores were significantly higher in the suicidal group. The suicidal group showed a significant decrease in platelet PBR density (-35%) compared to the controls (p < 0.005).",

    "94": "Results of our previous research in rats demonstrate the following: (a) Angiotensin II (Ang II) inhibits long term potentiation (LTP) in dentate granule cell-perforant path synapses and that this inhibition can be blocked by losartan, an Ang II AT1 receptor antagonist; (b) both ethanol and diazepam inhibit LTP induction and this inhibition can be blocked by losartan; (c) impairment of air righting by ethanol and diazepam (DZ) and eight-arm radial maze performance by ethanol can be blocked by pretreatment with losartan: (d) inhibition of dentate granule cell LTP by Ang II can also be prevented by pretreatment with nicotine. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to hypothesize that ethanol and diazepam impairment of air righting and maze performance might also be blocked by pretreatment with nicotine. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of nicotine 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously (SC) on 2.0 g/kg ethanol per os (PO) and 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg DZ intraperitoneally (i.p.) induced impairment of air righting; and to determine if the impaired maze performance due to 2.0 g/kg ethanol PO could be prevented by pretreatment with 0.4 mg/kg of nicotine, SC. Results confirm the hypothesis that moderate doses of ethanol, 2.0 g/kg PO, and DZ, 1.0 mg/kg i.p. impair air righting and that the impairment can be prevented by pretreatment with nicotine SC. Nicotine was not effective in blocking the 2.0 mg/kg DZ impairment of air righting. Nicotine, 0.4 mg/kg SC, prevented the impaired maze performance induced by 2.0 g/kg ethanol PO.", 
    "95": "Food intake and meal size are reduced in female Long-Evans rats during estrus. To investigate the contribution of the satiating action of endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) to this, rats were injected with 1 mg/kg of the potent, selective CCK(A) receptor antagonist, devazepide, during diestrus, when meal size is maximal, and during estrus, when it is minimal. Devazepide increased spontaneous food intake and meal size during estrus, but not during diestrus. Meal frequency was not affected by devazepide treatment. These results indicate that the potency of the CCK satiety-signaling system increases during estrus.", 
    "96": "The influence of ovarian cycling and of exogenous estradiol on the cholecystokinin (CCK) satiety-signalling system was investigated in intact and ovariectomized Long-Evans rats, respectively. Intraperitoneal injection of 1 mg/kg devazepide, the most potent and selective CCK(A) receptor antagonist, increased test meal size during estrus, but not during diestrus, confirming the influence of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal function on CCK satiety in intact rats. Devazepide was then tested in ovariectomized rats that received chronic cyclic estradiol (2 microg estradiol benzoate on Tuesday and Wednesday each week) or oil treatment. Devazepide did not increase meal size in estradiol-treated rats on Tuesday, prior to estradiol treatment, compared to oil-treated rats, but did selectively increase meal size on Friday, late in the estradiol replacement cycle, compared to Tuesday, early in the cycle. These results suggest that a phasic potentiation of the endogenous CCK satiety-signalling system is part of the mechanism for the decrease in meal size in female rats during estrus.", 
    "97": "The present trial examined the possibility that diazepam (DZP, 1 mg/kg) induces hyperphagia by acting on the dopaminergic system. Quinpirole (QP), dopamine D-2 receptor agonist, was used for this purpose. Mice fasted for 24 hr were treated with QP 1 (QP-1) or 2 (QP-2) mg/kg 30 min prior to termination of the starvation. DZP was given to untreated mice and half of the QP-1 and QP-2 treated mice 10 min before the termination of the starvation. Food consumed during six 30 min intervals (30 min-feeding), food consumed for 3 hr (total feeding), time required to enter the room containing food by passing through a maze with four multiple routes (time to banquet), latent period to commencement of eating food after entering the banquet room (latent period), and feeding frequency for the 30 min intervals as well as for 3 hr were measured. DZP stimulated feeding, shortened the latent period without affecting the time to banquet and increased the feeding frequency. The hyperphagic effect was restricted to the first 30 min interval only. Both QP-1 and QP-2 first reduced, then progressively stimulated, and finally reduced feeding without modifying total feeding, thus making a bell-shaped profile. They also prolonged both the time to banquet and the latent period, and reduced the feeding frequency of the first 30 min interval but not that for 3 hr. Both QP-1 and QP-2 canceled all the effects of DZP. These results imply that dopamine D2 receptor is involved in the induction of hyperphagia by DZP.",

Each patient was examined 4 times at the following stages: 1) before premedication; 2) at the 10th min; 3) at the 20th min; and 4) at the 30th min. Oral premedication with dormicum in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg did not affect heart rate or arterial pressure. By the 20th min it notably decreased total peripheral resistance, significantly decreased the respiratory volume, increased respiration rate, and decreased sympathetic tone in younger children. In older children the premedication virtually did not affect total peripheral resistance and facilitated heart work, increased the respiratory volume, rarefied the respiratory rate, and did not affect the autonomic regulation balance. Younger children fell asleep without excitation or negativism; 35.2% developed psychomotor reactions. In older group the effect was good in 71.1% children, the rest had \"apparitions\" starting from the 17th min: doubling of the staff's faces, white spiders, or white moths.",

Propofol, a phenolic derivate, is a short-acting anesthetic producing a more rapid onset sedation amnesia and a shorter recovery than midazolam: In higher doses it acts as hypnotic. The aim of this study was to evaluate both drugs in a prospective randomized trial for sedation of patients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).",

In addition, all received anxiolytic pre-medication of oral midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1 (max 7.5 mg) at the same time. No differences were seen in behaviour, respiratory or cardiovascular assessments. In both groups, 93% were drowsy pre-anaesthetic, 3% were asleep but rousable and less than 4% exhibited minor distress. At induction, mild weeping occurred in 9.7% of the tramadol group and 6.9% of the placebo group (P > 0.05).

The resolution between two adjacent peaks on the electropherogram was estimated and the overall quality of the separation was assessed by means of a new response function. The nature (methanol or acetonitrile) and proportion of the organic modifier both in the background electrolyte and the sample buffer and the injection time were considered. The results predicted that if the sample had a lower dielectric constant than the background electrolyte buffer then a much larger injection volume could be used.

To better understand the nature of these drug-induced convulsions, we characterized the seizure patterns associated with high doses of cocaine, and the amphetamine analogs, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 4-methylaminorex. The features of the stimulant-induced seizures were distinct and included the following: (1) the duration of convulsive activity was shortest for cocaine and longest for methamphetamine, (2) only MDMA produced a secondary clonic phase after the initial ictal event, and (3) 4-methylaminorex manifested a very steep dose-response curve. Differential preventive profiles of anticonvulsant agents on the stimulant-induced seizures also were observed. For example, cocaine-related seizures were most effectively prevented by, while methamphetamine-induced seizures were completely refractory to, phenytoin pretreatment. The only anticonvulsants which appeared to influence methamphetamine-related convulsions were diazepam and valproate. A unique feature of 4-methylaminorex was that related seizures were almost completely blocked by the calcium channel blocker, flunarizine.", 
    "111": "The aetiology of cognitive impairment is multifactorial; however, drugs are an important cause of delirium and dementia. Several factors may increase the risk of drug-induced cognition disorders in the elderly including imbalances in neurotransmitters (e.g. acetylcholine), age-related alterations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, and high levels of medication use. Nearly any drug can cause cognitive impairment in susceptible individuals; however, certain classes are more commonly implicated. Benzodiazepines, opioids, anticholinergics, and tricyclic antidepressants are probably the worst offenders. Older antihypertensive agents (reserpine, clonidine) have negative effects on cognition; however, large clinical trials in the elderly indicate that commonly used agents [e.g. thiazide diuretics, calcium antagonists (amiodipine, diltiazem), ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril) and beta-blockers (atenolol)] have minimal effects on cognition. Newer antidepressants such as selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A have not been shown to have negative effects on cognition. Although some drugs have shown low risk for causing cognition disorders in research studies, risk may be increased in frail older adults taking several medications and each case should be reviewed carefully. Identification of drug-induced cognitive impairment is crucial to early detection and resolution of symptoms. Preventive strategies directed at avoiding high risk medications when possible, appropriately adjusting doses based on age-related changes and close follow-up may prevent these conditions.", 
    "112": "The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, soman, induces marked and sustained hypertension and tachycardia associated with a convulsive syndrome in rats. The aims of the present study were to distinguish between the cardiovascular and convulsant effects of soman and to determine whether the maintenance of the soman-induced hypertension and tachycardia depends solely on a central muscarinic effect. To this end, using a computerised analysis of blood pressure (BP) in conscious freely moving rats, we examined the consequences on the increase in mean BP (MBP) and heart rate (HR) induced by soman (60 micrograms/kg, i.v.) of 1) a pre-treatment with the anticonvulsant drug diazepam (3 mg/kg, i.v.) and 2) atropine sulphate (10 mg/kg, i.v.) administered 10 or 60 min after the intoxication. Pretreatment with diazepam prevented the convulsions, assessed by electroencephalogram (EEG) recording, but modified neither the magnitude nor the kinetics of the pressor and tachycardic effects of soman (delta MBP = 74 +/- 2 and 73 +/- 5 mmHg, delta HR = 69 +/- 10 and 79 +/- 7 bpm, maximum MBP = 186 +/- 3 and 182 +/- 6 mmHg, maximum HR = 545 +/- 9 and 522 +/- 16 bpm in solvent- (n = 8) and diazepam- (n = 8) pre-treated rats, respectively). Whatever its time of administration, atropine sulphate fully and immediately reversed the rise in BP induced by soman. The soman-induced tachycardia was also suppressed by atropine administered 10 min after soman whereas it persisted when atropine was injected 60 min after the intoxication. These results show that the cardiovascular effects of soman can occur independently of the convulsive syndrome and that the maintenance of the soman-induced hypertension depends entirely on a permanent central muscarinic stimulation.", 
    "113": "We have shown previously that both hypoxia and propofol may inhibit the metabolism of midazolam. We now wished to see whether there was any additive or synergistic effect when they occurred together. Microsomes were incubated with 20 microns midazolam for 60 min, and propofol 0, 50, 100 or 1000 microM was added. Incubates were further subdivided so that the environment contained 0, 10, 21 or 70% oxygen. The results confirmed our earlier study showing that propofol only had a significant inhibitory effect at a concentration greater than that seen clinically (1000 microM). Anoxia was the only environment in which significant depression of the metabolism of midazolam occurred at all concentrations of propofol. This reduced it to almost zero. Post hoc analysis of the data showed that, with the greatest concentration of propofol (1000 microM), there was increasing inhibition of metabolism of midazolam with increases of oxygen from 10 to 70%.", 
    "114": "We have mutated a conserved leucine in the putative membrane-spanning domain to serine in human GABA(A) beta2 and investigated the actions of a number of GABA(A) agonists, antagonists and modulators on human alpha1beta2deltaL259Sgamma2s compared to wild type alpha1beta2gamma2s GABA(A) receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The mutation resulted in smaller maximum currents to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) compared to alpha1beta2gamma2s receptors, and large leak currents resulting from spontaneous channel opening. As reported, this mutation significantly decreased the GABA EC50 (110 fold), and reduced desensitization. Muscimol and the partial agonists 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol (THIP) and piperidine-4-sulphonic acid (P4S) also displayed a decrease in EC50. In addition to competitively shifting GABA concentration response curves, the antagonists bicuculline and SR95531 both inhibited the spontaneous channel activity on alpha1beta2deltaL259Sgamma2s receptors, with different degrees of maximum inhibition. The effects of a range of allosteric modulators, including benzodiazepines and anaesthetics were examined on a submaximal GABA concentration (EC20). Compared to wild type, none of these modulators potentiated the EC20 response of alpha1beta2deltaL259Sgamma2s receptors, however they all directly activated the receptor in the absence of GABA. To conclude, the above mutation resulted in receptors which exhibit a degree of spontaneous activity, and are more sensitive to agonists. Benzodiazepines and other agents modulate constitutive activity, but positive modulation of GABA is lost. The competitive antagonists bicuculline and SR95531 can also act as allosteric channel modulators through the same GABA binding site.", 
    "115": "In electrophysiological measurements the beta-carboline ethyl 6-benzyloxy-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (ZK 91085) acts as a positive allosteric modulator on rat recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptors and binds with high affinity (IC50-1.5 nM) to the [3H]-flunitrazepam site. Flumazenil was able to partially counteract the current modulation. These observations indicate an action of ZK 91085 at the benzodiazepine binding site. At the dual subunit combination alpha1beta2, which lacks the gamma subunit required for benzodiazepine modulation, we still observed a potentiation of GABA currents. Thus ZK 91085 acts via an additional site on the channel. At the subunit combination alpha1beta1, ZK 91085 potentiation is strongly reduced as compared to alpha1beta2. In binding studies, ZK 91085 was able to decrease [35S]-TBPS binding in alpha1beta2gamma2 and alpha1beta2 but not in alpha1beta1. This selectivity of ZK 91085 for receptors containing the beta2 isoform over those containing the beta1 isoform is reminiscent of the action of loreclezole. To identify amino acid residues important for the second type of modulation, we functionally compared wild type alpha1beta2 and mutant receptors for stimulation by ZK 91085. The mutation beta2N265S, that abolishes loreclezole effects, also abolishes ZK 91085 stimulation. The mutation beta2Y62L increased stimulation by ZK 91085 3-4 fold, locating an influencing entity of the second type of action of ZK 91085 at an alpha/beta subunit interface. Structural intermediates of ZK 91085 and the beta-carboline abecarnil, the latter of which only slightly potentiated GABA currents in alpha1/beta2, were analysed to determine structural requirements for modulation. ZK 91085 thus allosterically stimulates the GABA(A) receptor through two sites of action: the benzodiazepine site and the loreclezole site in contrast to classical beta-carbolines, that confer negative allosteric modulation through the benzodiazepine site.",

    "123": "Drugs that bind to benzodiazepine recognition sites of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor complexes may function as agonists in some behavioral assays and as antagonists in other behavioral assays. The present studies compared the effects of the benzodiazepines midazolam, flumazenil, bretazenil, Ro 41-7812, and Ro 42-8773 and the beta-carboline, beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt) under two different types of schedule-controlled responding in squirrel monkeys. One group of monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio schedule of stimulus-shock termination, and a second group of monkeys responded under a multiple fixed-ratio schedule of food presentation involving suppressed and nonsuppressed behavior. Under the schedule of stimulus-shock termination, midazolam produced dose-related decreases in response rate, and these effects were surmountably antagonized by flumazenil, bretazenil, Ro 41-7812, Ro 42-8773, and beta-CCt. Schild plot analysis of these data revealed the following mean pA(2) values: flumazenil, 7.18; bretazenil, 7.62; Ro 41-7812, 7. 06; Ro 42-8773, 6.95. Apparent pA(2) values were not calculated for beta-CCt because the CL of the slope of the Schild plot included positive values. Under the multiple schedule, midazolam, bretazenil, and Ro 42-8773 dose-dependently increased rates of suppressed responding, whereas flumazenil, Ro 41-7812, and beta-CCt had no significant rate-altering effects. Flumazenil antagonized the antisuppressant effects of midazolam and bretazenil; however, individual variability in these effects prohibited the determination of apparent pA(2) values. These results indicate that in vivo pA(2) values may be determined for benzodiazepine-site ligands. These results further demonstrate that some benzodiazepine-site ligands, e. g., bretazenil and Ro 42-8773, may function as both agonists and as competitive antagonists in vivo.", 
    "124": "Seizures and status epilepticus are among the neurological complications of cocaine overdose in humans. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the protective effectiveness and therapeutic index (separation between anticonvulsive and side effect profiles) of 14 newly approved and potential antiepileptic drugs using a murine model of acute cocaine toxicity and the inverted-screen test for behavioral side effect testing. Cocaine (75 mg/kg i.p.) produces clonic seizures (approximately 90% of mice), and conventional antiepileptic drugs have been reported to be either ineffective or only effective at doses producing significant sedative/ataxic effects. Clobazam, flunarizine, lamotrigine, topiramate, and zonisamide were ineffective against seizures up to doses producing significant motor impairment. In contrast, felbamate, gabapentin, loreclezole, losigamone, progabide, remacemide, stiripentol, tiagabine, and vigabatrin produced dose-dependent protection against cocaine-induced convulsions with varied separations between their anticonvulsant and side effect profiles: the protective index values (toxic TD(50)/anticonvulsive ED(50)) ranged from 1.26 (felbamate) to 7.67 (loreclezole), and gabapentin had the highest (protective index >152). Thus, several drugs were identified with greater protective efficacy and reduced motor impairment compared with classic antiepileptic drugs. Based on the proposed mechanism of action of these new anticonvulsants, it is noteworthy that 1) drugs that enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neuronal inhibition in a manner distinct from barbiturates and benzodiazepines offer the best protective/behavioral side effect profiles, and 2) functional antagonists of Na(+) and Ca(2+) channels are generally ineffective. Overall, this study provides the first description of the effectiveness of new antiepileptic drugs against experimentally induced cocaine seizures and points to several drugs that deserve clinical scrutiny for this indication.", 
    "125": "Evidences indicate the existence of two homologous and/or heterologous alpha subunits coassembled in a single gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor. However, it is unknown whether both or only one of the coassembled alpha subunits display benzodiazepine binding sites. Thus, we have investigated the association between alpha1 and alpha5 subunits and the pharmacological properties of these GABA(A) receptors from rat hippocampus. The association between alpha1 and alpha5 subunits was demonstrated by immunoblot of the anti-alpha1 or -alpha5 immunoaffinity-purified receptors and by double immunopurification by anti-alpha1 and -alpha5 columns in series. The benzodiazepine binding properties of the immunoprecipitated receptors indicated the existence of pharmacologically active and inactive alpha subunits. The anti-alpha5 immunoprecipitated receptors displayed exclusively low-affinity binding sites for both Cl218,872 (K(i) = 0.81 +/- 0.15 microM) and zolpidem (K(i) = 5.0 +/- 3.0 microM), in spite of the association between alpha1 and alpha5 subunits. The anti-alpha1 immunoprecipitated receptors displayed both high- and low-affinity binding sites for both ligands (K(i)s = 47.5 +/- 5.2 nM and 0.7 +/- 0.06 microM for Cl218,872 and 25.0 +/- 7.0 nM, 415 +/- 200 nM and 9. 3 +/- 3.0 microM for zolpidem). Therefore, the alpha5 subunit, when coassembled with alpha1 subunit, should be pharmacologically predominant. This hypothesis was probed by immunoprecipitation of the photoaffinity-labeled receptors and by anti-alpha1 and -alpha5 double immunopurified receptors. The alpha1-alpha5 double immunopurified receptors displayed a single low-affinity binding site (K(i) = 908 +/- 105 nM) for Cl218,872, undetectable [(3)H]zolpidem binding activity, and similar [(3)H]flumazenil and [(3)H]L-655,708 binding activity (0.10 +/- 0.01 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 pmol/20 microliters of anti-alpha5 immunobeads, respectively). Thus, the native GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1 and alpha5 subunits have only one alpha subunit pharmacologically active displaying alpha5 binding properties.", 
    "126": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) have been recognized as key regulators of cell cycle progression. Alteration and deregulation of CDK activity are pathogenic hallmarks of neoplasia. Therefore, inhibitors or modulators would be of interest to explore as novel therapeutic agents in cancer, as well as other hyperproliferative disorders. Flavopiridol is a semisynthetic flavonoid that emerged from an empirical screening program as a potent antiproliferative agent that mechanistic studies demonstrated to directly inhibit CDKs 1, 2, and 4 as a competitive ATP site antagonist. Initial clinical trials have shown that concentrations that inhibit cell proliferation and CDK activity in vitro can be safely achieved in humans, and additional clinical trials will establish its clinical potential. To address the need for additional chemotypes that may serve as lead structures for drugs that would not have the toxicities associated with flavopiridol, compounds with a similar pattern of cell growth inhibitory activity in the National Cancer Institute's in vitro anticancer drug screen have been recognized by the computer-assisted pattern recognition algorithm COMPARE and then screened for anti-CDK activity in a biochemical screen. The benzodiazepine derivative NSC 664704 (7,12-dihydro-indolo[3,2-d][1]benzazepin-6(5H)-one) was revealed by that approach as a moderately potent (IC50 0.4 microM) inhibitor of CDK2, which in initial experiments shows evidence of causing cell cycle redistribution in living cells. NSC 664704 is, therefore, a candidate for further structural optimization, guided in part by understanding of the ATP-binding site in CDK2. This approach represents one way of combining empirical screening information with structure-based design to derive novel candidate therapeutic agents directed against an important cellular target.",

To the extent that this phenomenon has been unrecognized and is not being studied, it is a \"dirty little secret.\" To the extent that careful clinicians have uncovered a useful strategy for boosting the effectiveness of available antipsychotic monotherapies, it represents an opportunity to improve the outcomes of patients with psychotic illnesses.",

There were no major complications. Eighteen patients (60%) reported that it was a \"quite\" acceptable procedure, 18 (60%) required only one night's hospitalisation, and 24 (80%) were successfully inducted onto naltrexone (defined as taking naltrexone on Day 8). Three months later, six (20%) were still taking naltrexone (with four of these occasionally using heroin) and seven (23%) were abstinent from opioids, including five not taking naltrexone. Eleven had gone onto methadone maintenance, seven had relapsed to heroin use, and one had died of a heroin overdose.",

    "136": "Injectable benzodiazepines are commonly stocked on ambulances for use by paramedics. We evaluated the stability of lorazepam and diazepam as a function of storage temperature. Diazepam (5 mg/mL) and lorazepam (2 mg/mL) injectable solutions were stored for up to 210 days in clear glass syringes at three conditions: 4 degrees C to 10 degrees C (refrigerated); 15 degrees C to 30 degrees C (on-ambulance ambient temperature); and 37 degrees C (oven-heated). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses of syringe contents were performed at 30-day intervals. After 210 days, the reduction in diazepam concentration was 7% refrigerated, 15% at ambient temperature, and 25% at 37 degrees C. The reduction in lorazepam concentration was 0% refrigerated, 10% at ambient temperature, and 75% at 37 degrees C. Whereas diazepam retained 90% of its original concentration for 30 days of on-ambulance storage, lorazepam retained 90% of its original concentration for 150 days. The decrease in lorazepam concentration correlated with an increase in the maximum ambient temperature in San Francisco. These results suggest that diazepam and lorazepam can be stored on ambulances. When ambient storage temperatures are 30 degrees C or less, ambulances carrying lorazepam and diazepam should be restocked every 30 to 60 days. When drug storage temperatures exceed 30 degrees C, more frequent stocking or refrigeration is required.",

Nonetheless, treatment nonresponse continues to be a chronic problem, and additional strategies are needed to aid patients who do not respond fully to initial interventions. In the present study, we use 'services' research to document the clinical response of pharmacotherapy nonresponders to a standard program of brief, group cognitive-behavioral therapy. Patients responded well, regardless of whether they had received a full, adequate trial of pharmacotherapy. In addition to its application as an initial treatment for panic disorder, routine application of cognitive-behavioral therapy in pharmacologic treatment algorithms is encouraged, with attention to referral of pharmacotherapy nonresponders to cognitive-behavioral therapy.",

    "152": "Exogenous application of agonists at the kainate subtype of glutamate receptors has been shown to depress evoked monosynaptic inhibition by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons in the hippocampus. This observation has led to the hypothesis that synaptic release of endogenous glutamate might have a disinhibitory effect on neuronal circuits, in addition to depolarizing neurons via postsynaptic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate, and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors. It is not known, however, if glutamate released from excitatory neurons has the same kainate receptor-mediated effect on monosynaptic inhibitory transmission as exogenous agonist application. Indeed, the recent demonstration that excitatory synaptic signals elicited in interneurons are partly mediated by kainate receptors suggests that these receptors may have a pro- rather than disinhibitory role. Here, we examine the effect of synaptically released glutamate on monosynaptic inhibitory signaling. In the presence of antagonists to AMPA and NMDA receptors, brief bursts of activity in glutamatergic afferent fibers reduce GABAergic transmission. This depression of inhibition is reversibly abolished by blocking kainate receptors. It persists when GABA(B) receptors are blocked and is enhanced by blocking metabotropic glutamate receptors, possibly explained by presynaptic regulation of glutamate release from excitatory afferents by metabotropic autoreceptors. We conclude that the net kainate receptor-mediated effect of synaptically released glutamate is to reduce monosynaptic inhibition. Since this form of disinhibition may contribute to seizure initiation, kainate receptors may constitute an important target for anticonvulsant drug development.",

Assessments included informant ratings by the nursing staff who completed the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory.", 
    "155": "Analyses comparing residents taking placebo to those taking medication after completion of the first phase showed no impact of drug therapy discontinuation on their behavior. Similarly, using the crossover design to compare residents' behaviors while taking placebo vs. taking drugs, withdrawal of medication had no impact on Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory or Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores.", 
    "156": "Results of this work suggest that longterm use of haloperidol, thioridazine, and lorazepam in nursing homes to manage agitation should be closely monitored for their efficacy.

These networks have the potential to solve a number of problems which arise in QSAR modeling such as: choice of model; robustness of model; choice of validation set; size of validation effort; and optimization of network architecture. The application of the methods to QSAR of compounds active at the benzodiazepine and muscarinic receptors is illustrated."
