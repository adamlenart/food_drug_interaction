In the case of long acting olanzapine injection in particular, has particular relevance the existence of a special side-effect called post-injection syndrome. This rare side effect consisting in the presence of symptoms of olanzapine overdose after intramuscular administration of medication has led to restrictions on the use of the drug and the need for patient observation for three hours after each injection. We report a case of postinjection syndrome, to our knowledge, the first in Spain since the commercialization of Zypadhera. As in most cases described in the literature have symptoms of overdosage of olanzapine (dysarthria, sedation, fatigue, etc.) that are selflimiting without any therapeutic measure and are accompanied by supratherapeutic plasma levels of olanzapine.",

The critical structures required for tremor expression are the inferior olive, climbing fibers, and the deep cerebellar nuclei; Purkinje cells are not required. Enhanced synaptic norepinephrine or blockade of ionic glutamate receptors suppresses tremor, whereas enhanced synaptic serotonin exacerbates tremor. Benzodiazepines and muscimol suppress tremor. Alcohol suppresses harmaline tremor but exacerbates harmaline-associated neural damage. Recent investigations on the mechanism of harmaline tremor have focused on the T-type calcium channel.",

    "16": "Specific phobias are among the most frequently diagnosed disorders in community with a twelve-month prevalence of 8.7% and a lifetime prevalence of 12.5%. Exposure-based therapies constitute the most effective treatment for this type of anxiety disorders. However, pharmacotherapies can still be considered for patients suffering from specific phobias in case they were non-adherent or resistant to exposure-based therapies or in case this kind of therapies was not accessible for them. Few data support the use of antidepressant in the treatment of specific phobias. A literature search via MedLine has been done in order to review all available studies in the domain of non-antidepressant pharmacotherapy of specific phobias. The importance of benzodiazepines such as diazepam, alprazolam and midazolam resides in the short-term reduction of subjective self-reported fear during the exposure to the feared object or situation. General anesthesia for the treatment of dental phobia does not seem to be efficient unless conducted with the inhalation anesthetic nitrous oxide which seems to be efficient on the short and on the long-term. Beta-adrenergic antagonists have been essayed with conflicting results. Cognitive enhancers such as D-cycloserine, glucocorticoids and yohimbine hydrochloride, seem to be more effective than placebo after a short term period of follow-up in treating specific phobia sympotms. In conclusion, promising efficient pharmacotherapies for specific phobias consists of drugs that enhance the efficacy of exposure-based therapies sessions by reducing anticipating phobia-related fear and/or by enhancing cognition during these sessions.",

Those comorbidities are much more common when social phobia is left neglected and untreated. It is characterized by excessive fears to one or most social situations (circumscribed versus generalized type). Social phobia has its onset typically in childhood or early adolescence and it is associated with significant functional impairment. Although cognitive behavioral therapy and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered the mainstay treatment of this disorder, other psychotropic agents can be of value in the management of this condition. This review discusses the efficacy of beta-bockers, benzodiazepines,\u00a0 anticonvulsants, D-cycloserine, buspirone and atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of social anxiety disorder.", 
    "18": "Introduction: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent and disabling condition that occurs after exposure to a traumatic event, and Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the first-line treatment approach for this disorder. However, a large proportion of patients remain symptomatic and other pharmacological agents have been investigated, based on the understanding of the underlying biological dysfunctions of PTSD. Methods: We conducted a review of the literature on the pharmacological options for PTSD other than the antidepressants, using MedLine and Web of Science databases, with search terms including the pharmacologic class of each agent plus PTSD, or pharmacotherapy, or fear conditioning. The literature review covered articles published until august 2012, including reviews and original articles. Results: Agents like antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, anti-adrenergic agents, have been studied in randomized clinical trials (RCTs), with general positive results for antipsychotics, especially as adjunct therapy, and for prazosin for sleep-related disturbances. However, one important target for novel medications is the modulation of the fear conditioning process, through the alteration of retrieval/reconsolidation or enhancement of fear extinction. This is traditionally targeted in prolonged exposure therapy, but pre-clinical findings from studies investigating agents like propanolol, clonidine, N-Methyl-D-aspartic Acid Receptor (NMDAR) compounds, 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) and cannabinoids, indicate promising results in affecting the fear conditioning process and thus improving PTSD core symptoms. Discussion: Antipsychotics can be considered a reasonable alternative option to PTSD, with the largest body of evidence for risperidone, even though larger RCTs are warranted. Prazosin is also a promising agent, especially for sleep-related disturbances, while anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines lack empirical support. However, the most promising area for pharmacotherapy in PTSD is the modulation of the fear conditioning process, through agents used in adjunct to exposure therapy.", 
    "19": "Introduction: Panic disorder (PD) is a common anxiety disorder. Despite neurophysiological advances, its pathogenesis is still not well elucidated. Although the recommended pharmacological agents have demonstrated efficacy and a rather acceptable tolerability, yet many patients do not respond fully and still suffer from residual symptoms. There is a need for new pharmacological classes with better tolerability and efficacy, and faster onset of action. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the existing non-antidepressant treatment of PD as well as the recent advances in the treatment of PD. Methods: 38 articles discussing pharmacological treatment of PD were selected for this review. They were mainly open-label studies, case-reports and review articles. Results: we reviewed the studies on anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, gamma amino butyric acid (GABAergic) products, atypical antipsychotics, clonidine, as well as emerging drugs in the treatment of PD such as metabotropic glutamate II agonists, and D-cycloserine. Conclusion: although most of the drugs tested were proven effective and well tolerated, the studies on the non-conventional agents are restricted to open-label trials and case reports. Further studies are required to establish their efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "20": "Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with significant morbidity and dysfunction. First-line OCD treatments - serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and their combination - though widely used, are not sufficient in treating resistant cases. This eventually raises the need for finding novel strategies, whether by adding-on drugs or switching to a different psychopharmacological class. The aim of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of non-antidepressant pharmacological treatment that has been evaluated for the management of OCD. Materials and methods: A research has been conducted using MedLine and the following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were used: Obsessive compulsive disorder AND drug therapy. Articles that conformed to specific inclusion criteria were stratified per drug and per quality of evidence. For each drug, articles having the best level of evidence were retained. Results: Sixty-eight articles were reviewed and presented by drug class as follows: antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) analogues and GABA reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines, glutamatergic agents and other miscellaneous drugs. Discussion: There is substantial collective evidence supporting the use of antipsychotics as an augmentation treatment of resistant OCD patients. Although not always consistent, the following drugs showed some efficacy upon randomized controlled trials: risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, haloperidol, topiramate, pindolol, morphine, ondansetron and celecoxib. The efficacy of glutamatergic agents is promising. Numerous other pharmacological agents have been studied yet the results are inconclusive due to several limitations mainly of methodological nature.", 
    "21": "Introduction: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a prevalent and very disabling anxiety disorder. First-line medications are antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective serotonin and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). However, a substantial number of patients do not reach remission while on antidepressants and they may develop troublesome side effects, which highlights the necessity of new therapeutic options for GAD.\u00a0 Methods: The purpose of this review is to discuss all non-antidepressant treatments studied in GAD. We searched MedLine for English articles published between 1980 and 2012, containing the following keywords: \"generalized (or generalised) anxiety disorder\" OR \"anxiety disorder\", AND \"drug therapy\" OR \"herbal medicine\". 76 articles were finally selected. Results: Pregabalin is the anticonvulsant with the most robust level of evidence in GAD. It rapidly reduces anxiety, have a safe side effect profile and presents a low potential for abuse. Among antipsychotics, quetiapine is the one of choice in GAD, with similar efficacy to SSRIs in low dosages, yet with lower overall tolerability. Benzodiazepines, buspirone and hydroxyzine are Food and Drugs administration (FDA) approved for GAD and have relatively good evidence of efficacy. Other drugs (betablockers, zolpidem, riluzole, etc\u2026) and natural remedies (e.g. Piper methysticum) could be potential treatment options, yet additional research is warranted. Conclusion:\u00a0 Pregabalin and quetiapine are the two most promising non-antidepressant treatments for GAD.",

    "25": "We conclude that a wash-out period of 4\u00a0weeks seems to be sufficient for CYP2D6 disinhibition after short-term paroxetine treatment (6\u00a0weeks). On the other hand, treatment with a CYP2D6 substrate less than 6\u00a0weeks after long-term paroxetine treatment (18\u00b77\u00a0weeks on average) could result in elevated drug plasma levels and occasionally also in drug toxicity.", 
    "26": "The advent of benzodiazepines in the 1960s provided their wide use in neurology and psychiatry. They proved to be myorelaxant and anticonvulsive therapy in neurology; their anxiolytic and hypnotic properties have made them the treatment of choice for insomnia and anxiety problems; they have also been used in alcohol withdrawal and in anesthesia, and for a wide range of treatments in other clinical branches. However, reports giving rise to a prescription controversy including abuse, harmful effects, intoxication and dependence toward addiction appeared soon. On the other hand, the revolutionary appearance of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) overshadowed benzodiazepines. According to recommendations of many scientific and professional institutions, the use of benzodiazepines has been gradually excluded or reduced or limited to short-term use. However, clinical experience showed that benzodiazepines are frequently used for long-term treatment, and there are many reasons for this, e.g., prescribing tradition, patient preference, difficulties associated with benzodiazepine withdrawal (even in patients taking low doses) because they have a rapid clinical onset of action, and good efficacy with few initial adverse effects. Moreover, SSRIs as alternative drugs are associated with incomplete therapeutic response and more uncomfortable adverse effects. Some authors therefore point out that the rationale for the shift from benzodiazepines to SSRIs is inappropriate.", 
    "27": "Antipsychotic drugs are increasingly used in children and adolescents to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about the long-term effects of early life antipsychotic drug treatment. Most antipsychotic drugs are potent antagonists or partial agonists of dopamine D2 receptors; atypical antipsychotic drugs also antagonize type 2A serotonin receptors. Dopamine and serotonin regulate many neurodevelopmental processes. Thus, early life antipsychotic drug treatment can, potentially, perturb these processes, causing long-term behavioral- and neurobiological impairments. Here, we treated adolescent, male rats with olanzapine on post-natal days 28-49. As adults, they exhibited impaired working memory, but normal spatial memory, as compared to vehicle-treated control rats. They also showed a deficit in extinction of fear conditioning. Measures of motor activity and skill, habituation to an open field, and affect were normal. In the orbital- and medial prefrontal cortices, parietal cortex, nucleus accumbens core and dentate gyrus, adolescent olanzapine treatment altered the developmental dynamics and mature values of dendritic spine density in a region-specific manner. Measures of motor activity and skill, habituation to an open field, and affect were normal. In the orbital- and medial prefrontal cortices, D1 binding was reduced and binding of GABA(A) receptors with open Cl(-) channels was increased. In medial prefrontal cortex, D2 binding was also increased. The persistence of these changes underscores the importance of improved understanding of the enduring sequelae of pediatric APD treatment as a basis for weighing the benefits and risks of adolescent antipsychotic drug therapy, especially prophylactic treatment in high risk, asymptomatic patients. The long-term changes in neurotransmitter receptor binding and neural circuitry induced by adolescent APD treatment may also cause enduring changes in behavioral- and neurobiological responses to other therapeutic- or illicit psychotropic drugs.",

The rate of falls was similar in the 7 days following a change to a SSRI versus non-SSRI antidepressant (11.9 versus 14.4 falls/1,000 person years; p = 0.58), a typical versus an atypical antipsychotic (25.4 versus 17.1 falls/1,000 person years; p = 0.10), or a short versus long acting benzodiazepine (15.2 versus 13.9 falls/1,000 person years; p = 0.23). Fall risk was highest on day 4 before the drug change (19.0 falls/1,000 person days), on the day of the drug change through 2 days after the drug change (17.6-20.3 falls/1,000 person days), and 5-6 days after the drug change (17.6-19.0 falls/1,000 person days).", 
    "56": "In the nursing home, risk of falls was similar following a psychotropic drug change of any class. We observed higher fall risk in the days before, but mostly after the drug change. We recommend that nursing home residents be closely monitored following a psychotropic drug change in an effort to reduce falls.",

First, we did a double-blind, five-way crossover study (n = 10) to assess the effect of single oral doses of netazepide (1, 5, 25 and 100\u2009mg) and placebo on the response to pentagastrin. Then, we did a single-blind, placebo-controlled study (n = 8) to assess the effect of the first and last oral doses of netazepide (100\u2009mg) twice daily for 13 doses on the response to pentagastrin.", 
    "59": "Netazepide was well tolerated. After placebo, pentagastrin increased the volume and H(+) secretion rate and reduced the pH of gastric aspirate. Compared with placebo, single doses of netazepide caused dose-dependent inhibition of the pentagastrin response (P < 0.02); netazepide (100\u2009mg) abolished the response. After 13 doses, the reduction in volume and H(+) secretion rate persisted (P < 0.001), but the pH effect was mostly lost.", 
    "60": "Netazepide is an orally active, potent, competitive antagonist of human gastrin/CCK2 receptors. Antagonism is dose dependent and persists during repeated dosing, despite tolerance to the effect on pH. Further studies are required to explain that tolerance.

Physical compatibility was evaluated using a previously described method immediately on mixing, after 60 minutes and after 120 minutes. Chemical compatibility was determined by measuring the hydrocortisone sodium succinate concentration of the test solutions 120 minutes after mixing compared with that of a reference sample of hydrocortisone sodium succinate solution.", 
    "63": "At all time points, when hydrocortisone was mixed with midazolam (1 mg/mL and 2mg/mL) and ciprofloxacin (2 mg/mL), the solutions remained clear, with no haziness, colour change, gas or precipitate formation, thus showing total physical compatibility. There were pharmacologically significant reductions (>10%) in measured hydrocortisone concentration (18.6% with midazolam 2mg/mL, P = 0.06; and 21.3% with ciprofloxacin, P = 0.01) in all of the test samples, as compared with the reference sample.",

On day 7 only, we measured pH and assayed plasma gastrin. The second study compared netazepide 5, 10 and 25\u2009mg and placebo once daily for 14 days. We measured pH on days 1, 7 and 14 and assayed plasma gastrin on days 1 and 14. We compared treatments by time gastric pH \u2265 4 during 0-4, 4-9, 9-13 and 13-24\u2009h after the morning dose, and by plasma gastrin. P < 0.05 was significant.",

On day 7 of the first study, netazepide increased pH significantly only during 9-13\u2009h after the 100\u2009mg dose, whereas omeprazole raised pH significantly during all periods. Both netazepide and omeprazole increased plasma gastrin significantly. Netazepide had linear pharmacokinetics. In the second study, netazepide caused dose-dependent, sustained increases in pH on day 1, but as in the first study, netazepide had little effect on pH on days 7 and 14. Again, netazepide increased plasma gastrin significantly.",

    "69": "The anaesthetic ketamine is used to treat various chronic pain syndromes, especially those that have a neuropathic component. Low dose ketamine produces strong analgesia in neuropathic pain states, presumably by inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor although other mechanisms are possibly involved, including enhancement of descending inhibition and anti-inflammatory effects at central sites. Current data on short term infusions indicate that ketamine produces potent analgesia during administration only, while three studies on the effect of prolonged infusion (4-14 days) show long-term analgesic effects up to 3 months following infusion. The side effects of ketamine noted in clinical studies include psychedelic symptoms (hallucinations, memory defects, panic attacks), nausea/vomiting, somnolence, cardiovascular stimulation and, in a minority of patients, hepatoxicity. The recreational use of ketamine is increasing and comes with a variety of additional risks ranging from bladder and renal complications to persistent psychotypical behaviour and memory defects. Blind extrapolation of these risks to clinical patients is difficult because of the variable, high and recurrent exposure to the drug in ketamine abusers and the high frequency of abuse of other illicit substances in this population. In clinical settings, ketamine is well tolerated, especially when benzodiazepines are used to tame the psychotropic side effects. Irrespective, close monitoring of patients receiving ketamine is mandatory, particularly aimed at CNS, haemodynamic, renal and hepatic symptoms as well as abuse. Further research is required to assess whether the benefits outweigh the risks and costs. Until definite proof is obtained ketamine administration should be restricted to patients with therapy-resistant severe neuropathic pain.", 
    "70": "Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, has been generally used as an antagonist which antagonizes the hypnotic and sedative effects of benzodiazepines at gamma-amino butyric acid receptors. The anesthetic effects induced by benzodiazepine could be reversed effectively and safely by flumazenil alone, and some have recommended diagnostic usage in intensive care unit and emergency unit as well, for suspected benzodiazepine intoxication. Seizures might follow the use of flumazenil. Benzodiazepine overdose patients who have co-ingested tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants are especially at risk for this complication. Therefore, flumazenil could be considered in cases in which quick recovery is required and should be administered intravenously in small, incremental doses.", 
    "71": "Anesthesia is a state made by multiple pharmacological agents that affect the functions of central, peripheral and autonomic nervous systems. Antagonists are often used to reverse the effects of anesthetic agents, muscle relaxants, and so forth. Antagonists often have side effects other than their specific antagonistic effect. Some side effects may be clinically useful. Ketamine was found to be a NMDA receptor antagonist. Ketamine potentially has neuroprotective, and anti-tumor effect. Local anesthetic agent also has been known to have anti-NMDA receptor effect. Although the mechanisms of local anesthetics to prevent or treat chronic pain have not been clearly elucidated, local anesthetics may have a place in the treatment of chronic pain. Naloxone may have spinal protective effects when used during thoracic aortic aneurysm surgery and stent placement. Peripherally and centrally active anticholinesterase agents have unique effects. Centrally active anticholinesterase agents such as donepezil and revastigmine, and galantamine have been used to treat patients with Alzheimer's disease. These agents may antagonize the effects of non-depolarizing muscle relaxants. Flumazenil may have adverse effects in patients on chronic benzodiazepines and tricyclic or tetracyclic antidepressants. Because sugammadex has little adverse effects, it has become a popular agent to reverse muscle relaxation by rocuronium in Japan.",

Short-term data were obtained from two double-blind studies of olanzapine LAI: one included a placebo comparator, and the other included oral olanzapine as an active comparator. Long-term data were obtained from an open-label extension study for olanzapine LAI and from an integrated database for oral olanzapine.", 
    "74": "The short-term incidence of EPS was 5.6% during treatment with olanzapine LAI (45-405 mg every 2-4 weeks) and 5.0% with oral olanzapine (5-20 mg/day). Akathisia (2.6% LAI, 1.2% oral), and Parkinson-like symptoms (1.8% LAI, 3.7% oral) were similar between treatment groups. The incidence of EPS for long-term treatment was 9.2% for olanzapine LAI. Incidences of EPS events were not significantly different between patients receiving olanzapine LAI or oral olanzapine for up to 3 years.",

We calculated the prevalence, compared the use patterns for each year and drug class, and used logistic regression to identify the factors associated with psychotropic medication use. Patients ever using a psychotropic medication for anxiety grew from 57.4% in 2004 to 63.8% in 2009 (p<0.01). From 2004 to 2009, use of benzodiazepines (22.7-30.5%, p<0.01) and atypical antipsychotics (2.3-3.9%, p<0.01) increased. A high prevalence in the use of benzodiazepines (41.8% in 2004 to 48.8% in 2009) was observed among older adults. Older age, having insurance coverage, and poor health status were significantly associated with self-reported psychotropic medication use. An increase of psychotropic medication use from 2004 to 2009 was observed. A high prevalence and increasing trend in the use of benzodiazepines may warrant further attention given safety concerns in older adults.",

Adolescents (12-19 years old), newly initiated on SGAs formed the exposure group and untreated adolescents formed the comparison group matched (3:1) to the antipsychotic group based on age, gender, and month of index SGA. Both the exposure and comparison groups were followed for slightly more than a year (395 days). Baseline and follow-up BMI were evaluated for both groups and percentage change from baseline BMI to follow-up BMI was calculated. Multivariate linear regression was conducted to assess the impact of SGAs on percent change in follow-up BMI from baseline controlling for demographic characteristics, baseline medications, comorbidities, and other covariates.", 
    "79": "The mean percentage increase in follow-up BMI from baseline for antipsychotic group was significantly higher than the comparison group (p < .01).

For evidence-based medicine of POCT, an interesting report was presented by the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry in the United States as the guideline in 2006. Users of POCT devices should understand all limitations of the devices. This strength/consensus recommendation is strong and the level of evidence is high. In this field, cyan, arsenic, paraquat, organic phosphate, methanol, acetaminophen, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and some other drugs were detected by POCT devices such as Triage DOA and a detector tube system and others in Japan. The usefulness of the organophosphorus pesticide detection kit in the accident of GYOZA POISONING from china was noteworthy. In the case of toluene intoxication, the detector tube system was useful as a screening test for the gas phase test of a 2-year-old patient's vomit and excreta without any information from his parents. In warfarin treatment, a POCT device was useful for small hospitals and clinics. Although the cost is not covered by the health insurance system in Japan, the emergency centers of hospitals use these POCT devices for clinical decision-making. This is the most important problem.",

This study examined the influence of everolimus on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, a sensitive CYP3A4/5 substrate, and its 1-hydroxy metabolite in 25 healthy male subjects. Compared with administration of oral midazolam 4\u2009mg/day alone, coadministration with everolimus 10\u2009mg/day increased the midazolam maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) by 25% and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) by 30%. The C(max) and AUC of 1-hydroxymidazolam increased by 20% and 25%, respectively. Concomitant administration of everolimus with midazolam did not change the midazolam metabolic ratio (i.e., the ratio of 1-hydroxymidazolam AUC to midazolam AUC) or the midazolam or 1-hydroxymidazolam terminal half-lives (geometric mean ratios for midazolam\u2009+\u2009everolimus vs. midazolam alone of 0.96, 1.03, and 1.06, respectively). These results suggest everolimus may affect the bioavailability, but not the systemic clearance, of orally coadministered CYP3A4 substrate drugs.", 
    "89": "Transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7), a Ca(2+)-permeable channel, has been demonstrated to be present in cancer cells and involved in their growth and proliferation. The present study used midazolam, a benzodiazepine class anesthesic, to pharmacologically intervene in the expression of TRPM7 and to inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Midazolam significantly inhibited the growth and proliferation of FaDu human hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells, concurring with the induction of G(0)/G(1) cell cycle arrest and blockage of Rb activation. Central-type and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonists did not abrogate proliferation inhibition by midazolam, while the specific TRPM7 agonist bradykinin reversed this effect. In addition, other benzodiazepines, diazepam and clonazepam also exhibited anti-proliferative activities. The inhibitory activity on cancer cell growth and proliferation, combined with the TRPM-dependent mechanism, reveals the anticancer potential of midazolam as a TRPM7 inhibitor and supports the suggestion that TRPM7 is a valuable target for pharmaceutical intervention.", 
    "90": "Activation of mast cells (MCs) can be achieved by the high-affinity receptor for IgE (Fc\u03b5RI) as well as by additional receptors such as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor and the receptor tyrosine kinase Kit (stem cell factor [SCF] receptor). Thus, pharmacological interventions which stabilize MCs in response to different receptors would be preferable in diseases with pathological systemic MC activation such as systemic mastocytosis. 1,4-Benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been reported to suppress MC effector functions. In the present study, our aim was to analyze molecularly the effects of BDZs on MC activation by comparison of the effects of the two BDZs Ro5-4864 and clonazepam, which markedly differ in their affinities for the archetypical BDZ recognition sites, i.e., the GABAA receptor and TSPO (previously termed peripheral-type BDZ receptor). Ro5-4864 is a selective agonist at TSPO, whereas clonazepam is a selective agonist at the GABAA receptor. Ro5-4864 suppressed pro-inflammatory MC effector functions in response to antigen (Ag) (degranulation/cytokine production) and LPS and SCF (cytokine production), whereas clonazepam was inactive. Signaling pathway analyses revealed inhibitory effects of Ro5-4864 on Ag-triggered production of reactive oxygen species, calcium mobilization and activation of different downstream kinases. The initial activation of Src family kinases was attenuated by Ro5-4864 offering a molecular explanation for the observed impacts on various downstream signaling elements. In conclusion, BDZs structurally related to Ro5-4864 might serve as multifunctional MC stabilizers without the sedative effect of GABAA receptor-interacting BDZs.", 
    "91": "Sedation in patients with acute or chronic respiratory disease needing ventilatory support is provocative. Agitation, anxiety and pain interfere with the measures to alleviate respiratory failure and to improve gas exchanges (invasive or non-invasive ventilation), while most sedatives and analgetics are respiratory depressants. Benzodiazepines, propofol and opioids are widely used, but it does not exist a consensus in medication selection, sedation and pain score scales recommended, implementation of protocols of sedation and recovery from the drugs administrated. The use of old and new sedative/analgesic medication, frequently combined, generates the need for understanding pharmacological interferences and for a strategy in preventing oversedation. Creating a specific protocol and guidelines in each respiratory ICU for sedation/analgesia in mechanically ventilated patients can improve outcome and reduce the ICU and hospital stay.", 
    "92": "Nowadays, the misuse of benzodiazepines (BZDs) is a cause for a serious concern among pharmacologically inexperienced patients, whether treated or untreated, that could lead to significant complications, including tolerance, dependence, and addiction. We present a case report in which an Italian patient affected by anxiety disorder and treated with BZDs presented a severe case of dependence on BZDs. We treated him according to an agonist substitution approach, switching from the abused BZD to a slow-onset, long-acting, high potency agonist (clonazepam), and looking at the methadone treatment model as paradigm. We decided to use clonazepam for its pharmacokinetic properties. The advantage of choosing a slow-onset, long-lasting BZD for the treatment of our patient was that it led us to a remarkable improvement in the clinical situation, including the cessation of craving, absence of withdrawal symptoms, reduced anxiety, improvements in social functioning, and a better cognition level.", 
    "93": "Seizures remain uncontrolled in 30% of patients with epilepsy, even with concurrent use of multiple drugs, and uncontrolled seizures result in increased morbidity and mortality. An extreme example is Dravet syndrome (DS), an infantile-onset severe epilepsy caused by heterozygous loss of function mutations in SCN1A, the gene encoding the brain type-I voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.1. Studies in Scn1a heterozygous knockout mice demonstrate reduced excitability of GABAergic interneurons, suggesting that enhancement of GABA signaling may improve seizure control and comorbidities. We studied the efficacy of two GABA-enhancing drugs, clonazepam and tiagabine, alone and in combination, against thermally evoked myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Clonazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of GABA-A receptors, protected against myoclonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Tiagabine, a presynaptic GABA reuptake inhibitor, was protective against generalized tonic-clonic seizures but only minimally protective against myoclonic seizures and enhanced myoclonic seizure susceptibility at high doses. Combined therapy with clonazepam and tiagabine was synergistic against generalized tonic-clonic seizures but was additive against myoclonic seizures. Toxicity determined by rotorod testing was additive for combination therapy. The synergistic actions of clonazepam and tiagabine gave enhanced seizure protection and reduced toxicity, suggesting that combination therapy may be well tolerated and effective for seizures in DS.",

The prevalence of insomnia disorder is approximately 10% to 20%, with approximately 50% having a chronic course. Insomnia is a risk factor for impaired function, development of other medical and mental disorders, and increased health care costs. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia involve genetic, environmental, behavioral, and physiological factors culminating in hyperarousal. The diagnosis of insomnia is established by a thorough history of sleep behaviors, medical and psychiatric problems, and medications, supplemented by a prospective record of sleep patterns (sleep diary). Quantitative literature reviews (meta-analyses) support the efficacy of behavioral, cognitive, and pharmacologic interventions for insomnia. Brief behavioral interventions and Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy both show promise for use in primary care settings. Among pharmacologic interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine receptor agonist drugs, although persistent concerns focus on their safety relative to modest efficacy. Behavioral treatments should be used whenever possible, and medications should be limited to the lowest necessary dose and shortest necessary duration.",

In the sixth ECT session, rocuronium, 0.4 mg/kg, was used for muscle relaxation and sugammadex, 2 mg/kg, for reversal of muscle paralysis.

The demographics of amphetamine abusers in Sweden and the concentrations of this stimulant in blood are reported for 10 years of forensic blood samples (2001-2010). Using a forensic toxicology database (TOXBASE), we studied 1183 amphetamine-related deaths, 20,452 users of illicit drugs, and 47,366 people arrested for driving under the influence of drugs (DUID). Most amphetamine abusers were male (82%-87%), and their average age was 33 to 39 years with males being 2 to 3 years older than females (P < 0.001). Mean (median) concentrations of amphetamine in blood were 1.25 (0.40) mg/L in autopsy cases, 0.61 (0.40) mg/L in users of illicit drugs, and 0.76 (0.58) mg/L in DUID suspects. Median concentration in DUID suspects was significantly higher than in the other forensic materials (P < 0.001). Women also had higher median concentrations of amphetamine in blood than male abusers of this central stimulant (P < 0.001). The major coingested drugs were benzodiazepines (41%), cannabis (26%), opiates (21%), and alcohol (18%) in autopsy cases. Polydrug use was less common in DUID suspects and users of illicit drugs, although benzodiazepines (13%), tetrahydrocannabinol (12%), and opiates (5%) were often identified along with amphetamine. Because median concentration of amphetamine was higher in living subjects (DUID suspects) compared with amphetamine-related deaths, this points toward toxicity of coingested drugs or adverse drug-drug interaction as being responsible for death.",

There were 206 deaths involving methadone, attributed predominantly to drug toxicity (137 cases), in addition to natural disease (24 cases), external injuries (44 cases) and one case where the cause was unascertained. The number of deaths each year did not rise significantly. There were 38 cases involving Physeptone(\u00ae) for chronic pain, 36 cases (14%) that were regarded as diversion deaths and 9 cases where the source of methadone was unknown. The remainder involved patients in opioid replacement therapy. Diversion deaths were signified by the unprescribed use of methadone by an individual not possessing a valid permit from the Victorian Department of Health. In these cases, the Coroner also described illicit use of the drug in the findings. Fifty-one individuals (25%; 15 female and 36 males) died within 14 days of commencing opioid replacement therapy with methadone administered via syrup. Many of these cases involved rapid dose increases of up to 25mg per day. The median starting dose was 35 mg and the median (mean; range) blood methadone concentration was 0.5mg/L (0.6 mg/L; 0.1-3.0mg/L). A number of cases were identified as having too high a starting dose, with 44% starting on 40 mg or more. The OD4-methadone index indicated a substantial increase in relative methadone toxicity from around 28 per million DDDs in the early 1990 s to over 60 in 2005. Ninety-eight percent of cases involved the use of other CNS depressants including: opioids, antidepressants, antipsychotics and ethanol, with benzodiazepines most common (88% confirmed positive). Improvements in the management of ORT, particularly in the induction period, has the potential to reduce mortality of patients receiving methadone.", 
    "112": "To evaluate the possible association between benzodiazepine use and subsequent cancer risk in Taiwan. In this population-based retrospective cohort study, we used data from 1996 to 2000 obtained from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance system to investigate the possible association between benzodiazepine use and cancer risk. The exposure cohort (mean age = 47.9 years, standard deviation = 17.3 years) consisted of 59,647 patients using benzodiazepine. Each patient from the exposure cohort was randomly frequency matched by age and sex to a person from the cohort with no benzodiazepine exposure (the comparison group; mean age = 46.4 years, standard deviation = 17.8 years). Each study subject was followed until a diagnosis of cancer was made (according to the International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision Clinical Modification) or until the time the subject was censored for loss to follow-up, death, or termination of insurance, or to the end of 2009. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to estimate the effects of benzodiazepine use on cancer risk. In the group with benzodiazepine use, the overall risk of developing cancer was 19% higher than in the group without benzodiazepine exposure, and the difference between the groups was statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.19; 99.6% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.32). With regard to individual types of cancer, the risks of developing liver cancer (HR = 1.45; 99.6% CI, 1.10-1.90), prostate cancer (HR = 1.72; 99.6% CI, 1.10-2.70), and bladder and kidney cancer (HR = 1.76; 99.6% CI, 1.16-2.67) were significantly higher for the benzodiazepine cohort. This population-based study has shed light on a possible relationship between benzodiazepine use and increased cancer risk. Further large, thorough investigations are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "117": "In vivo drug interactions of the teratogen thalidomide with the model cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A substrate midazolam were investigated in mice with humanized livers. The clearance of midazolam (administered intravenously, 10 mg kg(-1)) in chimeric mice was enhanced by orally co-administered thalidomide (100 mg kg(-1)). A larger area under the curve of the major metabolite 1'-hydroxymidazolam (1.7-fold) was obtained with thalidomide because of the heterotropic cooperativity of human P450 3A enzymes. A larger area under the curve of the minor metabolite 4-hydroxymidazolam (3.5-fold) was seen with daily pretreatment with thalidomide for 3 days, presumably because of human P450 3A induction. These results demonstrate that livers of humanized mice mediate drug interactions of thalidomide and suggest interactions of therapeutic agents during therapies with thalidomide.", 
    "118": "We have explored the mechanisms involved in the facilitation of glutamate release mediated by the activation of kainate receptors (KARs) in the cortex using isolated nerve terminals (synaptosomes). Kainate (KA) produced an increase on glutamate release at 100 \u03bcM. The effect of KA was antagonized by NBQX (with AMPA receptors blocked by GYKI53655). This facilitation was suppressed by the inhibition of PKA activation by Rp-Br-cAMP and H-89. Moreover, the facilitation of glutamate release mediated by KAR requires the mobilization of intrasynaptosomal Ca(2+) stores and the formation of a Ca(2+)-calmodulin complex. We conclude that KARs present on presynaptic terminals in the neocortex mediate the facilitation of glutamate release through a mechanism involving an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) to activate a Ca(2+)-calmodulin-AC/cAMP/PKA signaling cascade.", 
    "119": "The aim was to compare operant extinction with re-extinction following re-acquisition and to investigate neuropharmacological mechanisms through administration of drugs potentiating GABAergic or glutamatergic systems. Groups of C57Bl/6 mice were trained to lever press for food on a fixed ratio schedule, then extinguished with or without pre-session chlordiazepoxide or post-session d-cycloserine administration (15mg/kg in each case), then retrained to lever press for food, then re-extinguished with or without pre-session chlordiazepoxide or post-session d-cycloserine. Under vehicle injections, extinction and re-extinction curves were indistinguishable, but drug treatments showed that there was less resistance to extinction in the re-extinction phase. Chlordiazepoxide facilitated extinction and re-extinction, with an earlier effect during re-extinction. d-Cycloserine also facilitated extinction and re-extinction, with some evidence of an earlier effect during re-extinction. These results replicate and extend earlier findings with operant extinction, but differ from some previous reports of d-cycloserine on re-extinction of Pavlovian conditioned fear. Implications for accounts of the similarities and differences between neural mechanisms of extinction following either Pavlovian or operant conditioning, and applications of these findings, are discussed.", 
    "120": "Autoinduction in drug metabolism is a known phenomenon observed when a drug induces the enzymes responsible for its own metabolism. The potency, rate and extent of autoinduction following a given treatment paradigm may have therapeutic implications in clinic as well as for in vivo pharmacological assessments in animals. RO4938581, an imidazo-triazolo-benzodiazepine, is a novel GABAA\u03b15 negative modulator recently pursued for the treatment of cognitive dysfunctions. As circulating plasma levels of RO4938581 were shown to decrease rapidly after repeated dosing in rats, with CYP1A2 being involved in the metabolism of the compound, we examined the potential role of RO4938581-mediated autoinduction of CYP1A2. Incubation of rat hepatocytes with RO4938581 revealed potent CYP1A2 induction with significant increase in enzymatic activity at concentrations of 0.1nM and RO4938581 was shown to be 700-fold more potent than \u03b2-napththoflavone. Ex vivo studies revealed a 7-fold increase in metabolic CYP1A2 activity in liver microsomes prepared from rats administered with 0.1mg/kg of RO4938581 24h before. This induction profile was reflected in vivo in pharmacokinetic studies in rats where an 8-fold reduction in plasma exposure was observed after a second dose. The reduction in plasma exposures due to CYP1A2 autoinduction were confirmed functionally in contextual fear conditioning paradigm in rats, where a positive pharmacological effect observed after acute drug administration disappeared completely after sub-chronic dosing. Together, these findings suggest that RO4938581 possesses potent CYP1A2 autoinductive properties in rats and may serve as a tool for mechanistic metabolism or drug-drug interaction studies encircling this enzyme in rats.", 
    "121": "While intense or highly arousing stressors have long been known to suppress pain, relatively mild or chronic stress can enhance pain. The mechanisms underlying stress-induced hyperalgesia (SIH) are only now being defined. The physiological and neuroendocrine effects of mild stress are mediated by the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH), which has documented connections with the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), a brainstem region capable of facilitating nociception. We hypothesized that stress engages both the DMH and the RVM to produce hyperalgesia. Direct pharmacological activation of the DMH increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation in awake animals, confirming that the DMH can mediate behavioral hyperalgesia. A behavioral model of mild stress also produced mechanical hyperalgesia, which was blocked by inactivation of either the DMH or the RVM. The neuropeptide cholecystokinin (CCK) acts in the RVM to enhance nociception and is abundant in the DMH. Using a retrograde tracer and immunohistochemical labeling, we determined that CCK-expressing neurons in the DMH are the only significant supraspinal source of CCK in the RVM. However, not all neurons projecting from the DMH to the RVM contained CCK, and microinjection of the CCK2 receptor antagonist YM022 in the RVM did not interfere with SIH, suggesting that transmitters in addition to CCK play a significant role in this connection during acute stress. While the RVM has a well-established role in facilitation of nociception, the DMH, with its well-documented role in stress, may also be engaged in a number of chronic or abnormal pain states. Taken as a whole, these findings establish an anatomical and functional connection between the DMH and RVM by which stress can facilitate pain.", 
    "122": "In the current study the link among the \u03b3-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)/pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced absence-like seizures and concomitant decreases in the core temperature, as well as electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during rewarming from deep hypothermia produced by a drug-free protocol were investigated. During the rewarming period after deep cooling, most Wistar rats suffered from bilaterally synchronous spike and waves with no or mild behavioral correlates. Spike and wave seizures were temperature-dependent and were initially registered when body temperature (Tb) reached 25-27\u00b0C, but mostly during the mild hypothermia of 0.3-1.3\u00b0C (Tb of 36.3-37.3\u00b0C). In chemical absence models, spike and wave discharges were also closely accompanied by mild systemic hypothermia, as both PTZ- and GHB-induced temperature decreases ranged from about 1-1.4\u00b0C respectively, together with EEG markers of absence activity. Thus, throughout the different experimental designs, the occurrence of spike and wave discharges was always related to a mild (0.3-1.4\u00b0C) decrease of Tb. Benzodiazepine diazepam as the GABAA-positive allosteric modulator and CGP 62349 as the selective antagonist of GABAB receptors were used to determine if their well-known anticonvulsant properties also affect hypothermia elicited by these drugs. Finally, during the course of spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia, another selective GABAB-blocking agent, CGP 35348, was used to elucidate if GABAB inhibitory system could be critically implicated in the generation of hypothermia-dependent spike and waves. Diazepam prevented both the PTZ-induced hypothermia and electrographic absence seizures, but these two beneficial effects did not occur in the GHB model. Even though diazepam delayed GHB-induced maximal temperature decrease, the GHB effects remained highly significant. The GABAB antagonist CGP 62349 completely prevented hypothermia as well as absence seizures in both chemical models. Likewise, spike and wave discharges, registered during the spontaneous rewarming from deep hypothermia, were completely prevented by CGP 35348. These findings show that systemic hypothermia should definitely be regarded as a marker of GABAB receptor activation. Moreover, the results of this study clearly show that initial mild temperature decrease should be considered as strong absence-provoking factor. Hypothermia-induced nonconvulsive seizures also highlight the importance of continuous EEG monitoring in children undergoing therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. Since every change in peripheral or systemic temperature ultimately must be perceived by preoptic region of the anterior hypothalamus as the primary thermoregulatory and sleep-inducing center, the preoptic thermosensitive neurons in general and warm-sensitive neurons in particular, simply have to be regarded as the most probable candidate for connected thermoregulatory and absence generating mechanisms. Therefore, additional studies are needed to confirm their potential role in the generation and propagation of absence seizures.", 
    "123": "The GABA(A) receptor is the target for a number of important allosteric drugs used in medicine, including benzodiazepines and anesthetics. These modulators have variable effects on the potency and maximal response of macroscopic currents elicited by different GABA(A) receptor agonists, yet this modulation is consistent with a two-state model in which the allosteric ligand has invariant affinity constants for the active and inactive states. Analysis of the effects of an allosteric agonist, like etomidate, on the population current provides a means of estimating the gating constant of the unliganded GABA(A) receptor (\u223c10(-4)). In contrast, allosteric interactions at the M(2) muscarinic receptor are often inconsistent with a two-state model. Analyzing allosterism within the constraints of a two-state model, nonetheless, provides an unbiased measure of probe dependence as well as clues to the mechanism of allosteric modulation. The rather simple allosteric effect of affinity-only modulation is difficult to explain and suggests modulation of a peripheral orthosteric ligand-docking site on the M(2) muscarinic receptor.",

A variety of pharmaceuticals enter waterways by way of treated wastewater effluents and remain biochemically active in aquatic systems. Several ecotoxicological studies have been done, but generally, little is known about the ecological effects of pharmaceuticals. Here we show that a benzodiazepine anxiolytic drug (oxazepam) alters behavior and feeding rate of wild European perch (Perca fluviatilis) at concentrations encountered in effluent-influenced surface waters. Individuals exposed to water with dilute drug concentrations (1.8 micrograms liter(-1)) exhibited increased activity, reduced sociality, and higher feeding rate. As such, our results show that anxiolytic drugs in surface waters alter animal behaviors that are known to have ecological and evolutionary consequences.",

Preterm neonates are uniquely susceptible to pain and agitation, and these exposures have a negative impact on brain development. In preterm neonates, chronic pain and agitation are common adverse effects of mechanical ventilation, and opiates or benzodiazepines are the pharmacologic agents most often used for treatment. Questions remain regarding the efficacy, safety, and neurodevelopmental impact of these therapies. Both preclinical and clinical data suggest troubling adverse drug reactions and the potential for adverse longterm neurodevelopmental impact. The negative impacts of standard pharmacologic agents suggest that alternative agents should be investigated. Dexmedetomidine is a promising alternative therapy that requires further interprofessional and multidisciplinary research in this population.",

Ten patients had only a former use of LE, the other nine patients used it at the time of presentation. Of these, every third patient had to be transiently treated in an intermediate care unit, usually because of very severe and sudden withdrawal symptoms.

Close cooperation with intermediate care units is needed. In any case of coma of unknown origin or delirium with sudden onset LE use or withdrawal has to be taken into consideration, respectively. Many clinical problems result from the fact that LE cannot be detected in routine drug screenings. According to our experience, withdrawal from LE can be controlled with benzodiazepines.",

The drivers with suspicion of sleep disorders, in particular those with suspected diagnosis of OSAS, showed reaction times significantly prolonged as compared to the drivers of the group 1. In group 2, a higher incidence of (all) accidents was found, whereas the incidence of road accidents was significantly increased only in drivers with suspected OSAS.

    "149": "The Z-drugs zolpidem, zopiclone, and zaleplon were hailed as the innovative hypnotics of the new millennium, an improvement to traditional benzodiazepines in the management of insomnia. Increasing reports of adverse events including bizarre behavior and falls in the elderly have prompted calls for caution and regulation. Z-drugs have significant hypnotic effects by reducing sleep latency and improving sleep quality, though duration of sleep may not be significantly increased. Z-drugs exert their effects through increased \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transmission at the same GABA-type A receptor as benzodiazepines. Their pharmacokinetics approach those of the ideal hypnotic with rapid onset within 30\u00a0min and short half-life (1-7\u00a0h). Zopiclone with the longest duration of action has the greatest residual effect, similar to short-acting benzodiazepines. Neuropsychiatric adverse events have been reported with zolpidem including hallucinations, amnesia, and parasomnia. Poisoning with Z-drugs involves predominantly sedation and coma with supportive management being adequate in the majority. Flumazenil has been reported to reverse sedation from all three Z-drugs. Deaths from Z-drugs are rare and more likely to occur with polydrug overdose. Z-drugs can be detected in blood, urine, oral fluid, and postmortem specimens, predominantly with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. Zolpidem and zaleplon exhibit significant postmortem redistribution. Zaleplon with its ultra-short half-life has been detected in few clinical or forensic cases possibly due to assay unavailability, low frequency of use, and short window of detection. Though Z-drugs have improved pharmacokinetic profiles, their adverse effects, neuropsychiatric sequelae, and incidence of poisoning and death may prove to be similar to older hypnotics.",

    "158": "Adverse early life experience is thought to increase an individual's susceptibility to mental health disorders, including anxiety and affective disorders, later in life. Our previous studies have shown that post-weaning social isolation of female rats during a critical period of development sensitizes an anxiety-related serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) system in adulthood. Therefore, we investigated how post-weaning social isolation, in combination with a challenge with the anxiogenic drug, N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142; a partial inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine allosteric site on the GABAA receptor), affects home cage behavior and serotonergic gene expression in the DR of female rats using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Juvenile female rats were reared in isolation or groups of three for a 3-week period from weaning (postnatal day (PD) 21 to mid-adolescence (PD42)), after which all rats were group-reared for an additional 16 days until adulthood. Among vehicle-treated rats, isolation-reared rats had decreased rodent tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2) mRNA expression in ventral and ventrolateral subdivisions of the DR, a pattern observed previously in a rat model of panic disorder. Isolation-reared rats, but not group-reared rats, responded to FG-7142 with increased duration of vigilance and arousal behaviors. In addition, FG-7142 decreased tph2 expression, measured 4h following treatment, in multiple subregions of the DR of group-reared rats but had no effect in isolation-reared rats. No treatment effects were observed on 5-HT1A receptor or serotonin transporter gene expression. These data suggest that adolescent social isolation alters tph2 expression in specific subregions of the DR and alters the effects of stress-related stimuli on behavior and serotonergic systems.", 
    "159": "Seizures occur more often during the neonatal period than at any other period of life. Precise incidence is difficult to delineate and depends on study population and criteria used for diagnosis of seizures. Controversy exists as to whether neonatal seizures themselves cause damage to the developing brain, or if the damage is primarily due to the underlying cause of the seizures. As a result of this controversy there is an ongoing discussion as to whether all seizures (both clinical and subclinical) should be treated. When (sub)clinical seizures are treated, there is no consensus about the most appropriate treatment for neonatal seizures and how to assess the efficacy of treatment. Current therapeutic options to treat neonatal seizures (i.e. primarily first generation antiepileptics) are relatively ineffective. There is an urgent need for prospective, randomized, controlled trials for efficacy and safety of these second-generation antiepileptic drugs in neonates. The aim of this review is to survey current knowledge regarding treatment of neonatal seizures in both term and preterm infants.",

    "164": "Stereoselectivity of 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds provides a unique way for the design of stereoisomers as more selective and more potent inhibitors as drug candidates for treatment of the neurological diseases involving excessive activity of AMPA receptors. Here we investigate a pair of enantiomers known as Talampanel and its (+) counterpart about their mechanism of inhibition and selectivity toward four AMPA receptor subunits or GluA1-4. We show that Talampanel is the eutomer with the endismic ratio being 14 for the closed-channel and 10 for the open-channel state of GluA2. Kinetic evidence supports that Talampanel is a noncompetitive inhibitor and it binds to the same site for those 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds with the C-4 methyl group on the diazepine ring. This site, which we term as the \"M\" site, recognizes preferentially those 2,3-benzodiazepine compounds with the C-4 methyl group being in the R configuration, as in the chemical structure of Talampanel. Given that Talampanel inhibits GluA1 and GluA2, but is virtually ineffective on the GluA3 and GluA4 AMPA receptor subunits, we hypothesize that the \"M\" site(s) on GluA1 and GluA2 to which Talampanel binds is different from that on GluA3 and GluA4. If the molecular properties of the AMPA receptors and Talampanel are used for selecting an inhibitor as a single drug candidate for controlling the activity of all AMPA receptors in vivo, Talampanel is not ideal. Our results further suggest that addition of longer acyl groups to the N-3 position should produce more potent 2,3-benzodiazepine inhibitors for the \"M\" site.",

The viral capsid protein (CA) represents one such potential target. Recently, a series of benzodiazepine inhibitors was identified via high-throughput screening using an in vitro capsid assembly assay (CAA). Here, we demonstrate how a combination of NMR and X-ray co-crystallography allowed for the rapid characterization of the early hits from this inhibitor series. Ligand-based (19)F NMR was used to confirm inhibitor binding specificity and reversibility as well as to identify the N-terminal domain of the capsid (CA(NTD)) as its molecular target. Protein-based NMR ((1)H and (15)N chemical shift perturbation analysis) identified key residues within the CA(NTD) involved in inhibitor binding, while X-ray co-crystallography confirmed the inhibitor binding site and its binding mode. Based on these results, two conformationally restricted cyclic inhibitors were designed to further validate the possible binding modes. These studies were crucial to early hit confirmation and subsequent lead optimization.",

The purpose of this review article was to understand the present status of the treatment system for alcoholism in Korea compared to the United States and to suggest its developmental direction in Korea. Current modalities of alcoholism treatment in Korea including withdrawal treatment, pharmacotherapy, and psychosocial treatment are available according to Korean evidence-based treatment guidelines. Benzodiazepines and supportive care including vitamin and nutritional support are mainly used to treat alcohol withdrawal in Korea. Naltrexone and acamprosate are the drugs of first choice to treat chronic alcoholism. Psychosocial treatment methods such as individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, family therapy, cognitive behavior therapy, cue exposure therapy, 12-step facilitation therapy, self-help group therapy, and community-based treatment have been carried out to treat chronic alcoholism in Korea. However, current alcohol treatment system in Korea is not integrative compared to that in the United States. To establish the treatment system, it is important to set up an independent governmental administration on alcohol abuse, to secure experts on alcoholism, and to conduct outpatient alcoholism treatment programs and facilities in an open system including some form of continuing care.", 
    "167": "Past studies have suggested that progesterone-derived ovarian hormones contribute to the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol, particularly via progesterone metabolites that act at \u03b3-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. It is unknown whether loss of ovarian hormones in women, for example, after menopause, may be associated with altered receptor mediation of the effects of ethanol. The current study measured the substitution of allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, pentobarbital, midazolam, dizocilpine, TFMPP, and RU 24969 in female sham and ovariectomized rats trained to discriminate 1.0 g/kg ethanol from water. The groups did not differ in the substitution of GABA(A)-positive modulators (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, neuroactive steroids) or the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist dizocilpine. Similarly, blood-ethanol concentration did not differ between the groups, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone, progesterone, pregnenolone, and deoxycorticosterone were unchanged 30 min after administration of 1.0 g/kg ethanol or water. However, substitution of neuroactive steroids and RU 24969, a 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A/1B) receptor agonist, was lower than observed in previous studies of male rats, and TFMPP substitution was decreased in ovariectomized rats. Ovarian hormones appear to contribute to 5-HT receptor mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol in rats.",

    "171": "Spasticity is a disabling complication of multiple sclerosis. Some commonly used oral medications include baclofen, tizanidine, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines, but their benefits are modest. Sativex\u00ae (GW Pharmaceuticals PLC, Porton Down, UK; Laboratorios Almirall, SA, Barcelona, Spain) is a unique cannabinoid-based medicine with two main active ingredients; 9-\u03b4-tetrahydrocannabinol, which acts mainly on cannabinoid 1 receptors in the CNS and plays a key role in the modulation of spasticity and spasms, and cannabidiol, which has different properties, including minimization of the psychoactivity associated with 9-\u03b4-tetrahydrocannabinol. Sativex is indicated for symptomatic improvement in adult patients with moderate-to-severe multiple sclerosis-related spasticity who have not responded adequately to other first- or second-line antispasticity medications, and who demonstrate clinically significant improvement in spasticity-related symptoms during an initial trial of therapy. Over the past couple of years, Sativex has been approved for use in a number of European countries and ongoing postmarketing studies are evaluating the possible risks associated with Sativex treatment by systematically collecting all suspected adverse reactions that occur in patients from the start of treatment. Interim data from the UK as well as Spanish Sativex safety registries confirm that clinical benefit is maintained over the longer term despite the expected trend for deterioration owing to disease progression. Even after more than 2 years of use, no new safety/tolerability signals have emerged with Sativex, including no evidence of driving impairment and no relevant incidence of falls or other adverse events of concern, such as psychiatric or nervous system events. Sativex appears to be a well-tolerated and useful add-on therapy in patients who have not achieved an adequate response with traditional antispastic agents.", 
    "172": "The attainment of strong pharmacological effects with oligonucleotides is hampered by inefficient access of these molecules to their sites of action in the cytosol or nucleus. Attempts to address this problem with lipid or polymeric delivery systems have been only partially successful. Here, we describe a novel alternative approach involving the use of a non-toxic small molecule to enhance the pharmacological effects of oligonucleotides. The compound Retro-1 was discovered in a screen for small molecules that reduce the actions of bacterial toxins and has been shown to block the retrograde trafficking pathway. We demonstrate that Retro-1 can also substantially enhance the effectiveness of antisense and splice switching oligonucleotides in cell culture. This effect occurs at the level of intracellular trafficking or processing and is correlated with increased oligonucleotide accumulation in the nucleus but does not involve the perturbation of lysosomal compartments. We also show that Retro-1 can alter the effectiveness of splice switching oligonucleotides in the in vivo setting. These observations indicate that it is possible to enhance the pharmacological actions of oligonucleotides using non-toxic and non-lysosomotropic small molecule adjuncts.", 
    "173": "Large airway bronchoconstriction acts mainly through cholinergic pathways via muscarinic M3 receptors with some contribution from M2 receptors. By contrast, the mechanisms of small airway contraction are largely unknown. This study used precision cut lung slices to examine the role of muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors in the contractile response of rat and human small airways. In rat small airways, the M3 preferential antagonist, 4-DAMP, inhibited carbachol-mediated contraction (1\u00d710(-6) M) more than that of the M2 selective antagonist, AF-DX116 (pIC50 values: 8.85\u00b10.18 and 6.31\u00b10.19, n=6-8 respectively). Tiotropium, inhibited the contractile response to carbachol with (pIC50: 9.86\u00b10.07, n=6), but could not distinguish between M2 and M3 mediated effects. Similar experiments using human small airways with tiotropium and AF-DX116, gave a pIC50 of 10.35\u00b10.05 and a pKB of 6.37\u00b10.13, n=5 respectively. Therefore, M3 receptors play a key role in muscarinic contraction of small airways in both rats and humans but the effect of M2 receptors cannot be excluded. To investigate the role of M2 receptors, carbachol-induced contraction of small airways was performed in the presence and absence of a \u03b22-agonist in order to elevate intracellular cAMP levels prior to contraction. Isoproterenol-induced relaxation was significantly increased by AF-DX116 (P<0.001) in rat small airways and by AF-DX116 (P<0.01), gallamine (P<0.05) and pertussis toxin (P<0.05) in human small airways. Taken together, these data suggest that cholinergic antagonism of muscarinic receptors in human and rat small airways inhibits airway contraction via direct inhibition of contraction through M3 receptors, and by M2 receptor mediated inhibition of relaxation.", 
    "174": "The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors on responses, elicited by benzodiazepines (BZs) in a modified elevated plus-maze task in mice. It was shown that acute doses of diazepam (DZ; 1 and 2 mg/kg) and flunitrazepam (FNZ; 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg) significantly increased the time of transfer latency (TL2) in a retention trial, thus confirming memory impairing effects of BZs. l-NAME (N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester; 200 mg/kg), a non-selective inhibitor of NOS, and 7-NI (7-nitroindazole; 40 mg/kg), a selective inhibitor of NOS, further intensified DZ-induced memory impairment. On the other hand, L-NAME (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) and 7-NI (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) prevented FNZ-induced memory compromising process. The results of this study indicated that suppressed NO synthesis enhanced DZ-induced but prevented FNZ-induced memory impairment. Taken together, these findings could suggest NO involvement in BZs-induced impairment of memory processes. The precise mechanism of these controversial effects, however, remains elusive.",

Subjects viewed faces superimposed on different backgrounds (e.g., the Eiffel Tower). Face recognition on a surprise memory test was better when the encoding background was reinstated than when it was swapped with a different background; however, the reinstatement advantage was modulated by how many faces had been seen with a given background, and reinstatement did not improve recognition for unknown faces. The follow-up experiment added a drug intervention that inhibited the ability to form new associations. Context reinstatement did not improve recognition for famous or unknown faces under the influence of the drug. The results suggest that it is easier to associate context to faces that have a preexisting long-term memory representation than to faces that do not.",

Moreover, it has been suggested that the binding of the R2 C-terminus is very similar in M. tuberculosis and Salmonella typhimurium. Based on modeling studies of a crystal structure of the holocomplex of the S. typhimurium enzyme, a benzodiazepine-based turn mimetic was identified and a set of novel compounds incorporating the benzodiazepine scaffold was synthesized. The compounds were evaluated in a competitive fluorescence polarization assay and in an RNR activity assay. These studies revealed that the compounds incorporating the benzodiazepine scaffold have the ability to compete for the M. tuberculosis R2 binding site with low-micromolar affinity.", 
    "177": "The nonmedical use or abuse of prescription drugs, including psychotropic medicines, is a growing health problem in Japan. Patient access to psychotropic drugs, specifically from the oversupply of medications due to overlapping prescriptions, may increase the risk of drug abuse and dependence. However, very little is known about such overlapping prescriptions. Today, the dispensing of prescriptions is generally moving from inside to outside of hospitals, with psychotropic drugs mainly dispensed at community pharmacies. In this study, we used health insurance claims (i.e., receipts) for dispensing as the main source of information in an investigation of overlapping prescriptions of psychotropic drugs. A total of 119 patients were found to have received overlapping prescriptions, as identified by community pharmacists who were members of the Saitama Pharmaceutical Association, using patient medication records, followed by medication counseling and prescription notes for the patient. According to our findings, the most frequently overlapping medication was etizolam. Etizolam can be prescribed for more than 30 days since it is not regulated under Japanese law as a \"psychotropic drug.\" Generally, when a drug can be prescribed for a greater number of days, it increases the likelihood of an overlapping prescription during the same period. As a result, the long-term prescription of etizolam increases the risk of overlapping prescriptions. We also found that the patients who received overlapping prescriptions of etizolam were mostly elderly and the most common pattern was prescription from both internal medicine and orthopedics physicians. Etizolam has wide range of indications that are covered by health insurance. Our results suggest that patients who received overlapping prescriptions of etizolam may receive prescriptions from different prescribers for different purposes. Therefore, it may be appropriate to regulate etizolam as a \"psychotropic drug\" under Japanese law, thus setting a limit on the period for which it can be prescribed in order to help prevent long-term and overlapping prescriptions.",

Several investigators have shown an involvement of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in the pathophysiology of dependence or withdrawal. This study was performed to elucidate the role of mGluRs in benzodiazepine dependence. Withdrawal signs were precipitated in mice by flumazenil injection (25 mg/kg) after continuous subcutaneous infusion of benzodiazepines for 7 days, and the effects of several Gi-coupled receptor ligands on forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation were examined in the cerebral cortex of mice. The mRNA expression for mGluRs was determined by RT-PCR. A single injection of flumazenil precipitated typical withdrawal signs such as tail elevation and tremor in mice treated with diazepam or alprazolam, but not quazepam. The inhibitory effect of nonselective mGluR ligands on adenylate cyclase activity was diminished in mice that showed signs of benzodiazepine withdrawal. The mRNA expression levels of mGluR2 and mGluR3 were lowered in the cerebral cortex of mice pretreated with diazepam or alprazolam. Our findings suggest that the reduction in the expression of group II mGluRs subunits may be involved in the development of benzodiazepine dependence.",

Further analysis suggested that this finding represented differences in task-related deactivation and was associated with greater control over alcohol-related thoughts.

The effectiveness of sleep was estimated as TST/TIB x100% (TIB - habitual time in bed, TST - habitual total sleeping time). REM latency (LREM), periodic limb movements (PLM) (total number and sleep index) were measured as well. All patients underwent neuropsychological testing using MMSE, five-word test, digit span and the Hamilton scale (HAM-D). Patients were allocated to 2 groups.

The rats with CCI showed the characteristic for the mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia signs that were calculated by using the von Frey's and Hargreaves' tests. The conducted studies measured the effects of intraperitoneal administration of naloxone (opioid antagonist), prazosin (MT3 antagonist), luzindole (MT1/MT2 receptor antagonist), picrotoxin (GABA(A) antagonist) and flumazenil (benzodiazepine antagonist) on the antinociceptive effects caused by melatonin. Melatonin caused the increase in the pain threshold of the mechanical allodynia and the slight increase in the threshold of the thermal hyperalgesia. The pre-treatment with naloxone completely abolished the antinociceptive effects of melatonin in von Frey's test, but not thermal sensation in the Hargreaves's test. Prazosin did not have any effects, while administration of luzindole significantly suppressed the antinociceptive effect of melatonin. The antiallodynic effect of MT was also abolished by flumazenil and picrotoxin. Melatonin influences the mechanical allodynia but not thermal hyperalgesia via activation of opioid system and benzodiazepine-GABAergic pathway. Antinociceptive effects of melatonin are mostly related to the MT1/MT2 receptors interaction.", 
    "195": "The use of benzodiazepines is common among seniors. This consumption can cause an addiction whose criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition revised (DSM-IV-TR) do not always apply to the situation of the elderly. This research seeks to examine the link between the feeling of benzodiazepine dependence and the use of health services by seniors. A secondary objective is to describe the use of benzodiazepines among seniors living in the community.", 
    "196": "Data derive from a survey conducted in Quebec in 2005-2006 from a representative sample of 707 Francophones aged 65 and over living in the community. The feeling of benzodiazepine dependence was measured by a composite variable incorporating two questions inspired by the DSM-IV-TR. The use of health services was measured through the cumulative impact of consultation with health care professionals during a 12- month period.", 
    "197": "Older adults consumed a total of 745 benzodiazepines, including 117 (16.5%) which had a half-long life. The proportion of seniors who reported a feeling of dependence on benzodiazepines was estimated at 35.1 %. These seniors did not significantly make further use of health services for their addiction to benzodiazepines.", 
    "198": "The results of this study suggest that the use of benzodiazepines among seniors in Quebec is far from optimal. Moreover, the perceived need in addiction is not a significant factor in inducing seniors to use health services for the management of addiction. There is, therefore, a need for research to better understand the barriers associated with the use of health services by seniors addicted to benzodiazepines.", 
    "199": "The study of the cerebrovascular physiology is crucial to understand the pathogenesis of neurological disease and the pharmacokinetic of drugs. Appropriate models in vitro often fail to represent in vivo physiology. To address these issues we propose the use of a novel artificial vascular system that closely mimics capillary and venous segments of human cerebrovasculature while also allowing for an extensive control of the experimental variables and their manipulation.", 
    "200": "Using hollow fiber technology, we modified an existing dynamic artificial model of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (DIV-capillary) to encompass the distal post-capillary (DIV-venules) segments of the brain circulatory system. This artificial brain vascular system is comprised of a BBB module serially connected to a venule segment. A pump generates a pulsatile flow with arterial pressure feeding the system. The perfusate of the capillary module achieves levels of shear stress, pressure, and flow rate comparable to what observed in situ. Endothelial cell exposure to flow and abluminal astrocytic stimuli allowed for the formation of a highly selective capillary BBB with a trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TEER; >700 ohm cm2) and sucrose permeability (< 1X10-u cm/sec) comparable to in vivo. The venule module, which attempted to reproduce features of the hemodynamic microenvironment of venules, was perfused by media resulting in shear stress and intraluminal pressure levels lower than those found in capillaries. Because of altered cellular and hemodynamic factors, venule segments present a less stringent vascular bed (TEER <250 Ohm cm2; Psucrose > 1X10-4 cm/sec) than that of the BBB. Abluminal human brain vascular smooth muscle cells were used to reproduce the venular abluminal cell composition.", 
    "201": "The unique characteristics afforded by the DIV-BBB in combination with a venule segment will realistically expand our ability to dissect and study the physiological and functional behavior of distinct segments of the human cerebrovascular network.", 
    "202": "Administration of scheduled antipsychotic therapy to mechanically ventilated patients to prevent or treat delirium is common, despite the lack of evidence to support its use. Among long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV), the frequency of scheduled antipsychotic therapy use, and the factors and outcomes associated with it, have not been described.", 
    "203": "To identify scheduled antipsychotic therapy prescribing practices, and the factors and outcomes associated with the use of antipsychotics, among LTACH patients requiring PMV.", 
    "204": "Consecutive patients without major psychiatric disorders or dementia who were admitted to an LTACH for PMV over 1 year were categorized as those receiving scheduled antipsychotic therapy (\u226524 hours of use) and those not receiving scheduled antipsychotic therapy. Presence of delirium, use of psychiatric evaluation, nonscheduled antipsychotic therapy, and scheduled antipsychotic therapy-related adverse effects were extracted and compared between the 2 groups and when significant (p \u2264 0.05), were entered into a regression analysis using generalized estimating equation techniques.", 
    "205": "Among 80 patients included, 39% (31) received scheduled antipsychotic therapy and 61% (49) did not. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, illness severity, and medical history, were similar between the 2 groups. Scheduled antipsychotic therapy was administered on 52% of LTACH days for a median (interquartile range [IQR]) of 25 (6-38) days and, in the antipsychotic group, was initiated at an outside hospital (45%) or on day 2 (1-6; median [IQR]) of the LTACH stay (55%). Quetiapine was the most frequently administered scheduled antipsychotic (77%; median dose 50 [37-72] mg/day). Use of scheduled antipsychotic therapy was associated with a greater incidence of psychiatric evaluation (OR 5.7; p = 0.01), delirium (OR 2.4; p = 0.05), as-needed antipsychotic use (OR 4.1; p = 0.005) and 1:1 sitter use (OR 7.3; p = 0.001), but not benzodiazepine use (p = 0.19).", 
    "206": "Among LTACH patients requiring PMV, scheduled antipsychotic therapy is used frequently and is associated with a greater incidence of psychiatric evaluation, delirium, as-needed psychotic use, and sitter use. Although scheduled antipsychotic therapy-related adverse effects are uncommon, these effects are infrequently monitored.", 
    "207": "Delirium and sedative-induced coma are described as incremental manifestations of cerebral dysfunction. Both may be associated with sedative or opiate doses and pharmacokinetic or pharmacogenetic variables, such as drug plasma levels (exposure), drug metabolism, and/or their transport across the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "208": "To compare biological and drug treatment characteristics in patients with coma and/or delirium while in the ICU.", 
    "209": "In 99 patients receiving IV fentanyl, midazolam, or both, we evaluated drug doses, covariates likely to influence drug effects (age, body mass index, and renal and hepatic dysfunction); delirium risk factors; concomitant administration of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein substrates/inhibitors; ABCB1, ABCG2, and CYP3A5 genetic polymorphisms; and fentanyl and midazolam plasma levels. Delirium and coma were evaluated daily. In patients with only coma (n=15), only delirium (n=7), and neither ever (n=14), we measured plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17,macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b2, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1.", 
    "210": "Time to first coma was associated with fentanyl and midazolam doses (p=0.03 and p=0.01, respectively). The number of days in coma was associated with the number of days of coadministration of CYP3A inhibitors (r=0.30; p=0.006). Plasma levels of fentanyl were higher in patients with clinical coma (3.7\u00b14.7 vs. 2.0\u00b11.8 ng/mL, p=0.0001) as were midazolam plasma levels (1050\u00b12232 vs. 168\u00b1249 ng/mL, p=0.0001). Delirium occurrence was unrelated to midazolam administration, cumulative doses, or serum levels. Days with delirium were associated with days of coadministration of P-glycoprotein inhibitor (r=0.35; p=0.0004). Delirious patients had higher levels of the inflammatory mediator IL-6 than comatose patients (129.3 vs. 35.0 pg/mL, p=0.05).", 
    "211": "Coma is associated with fentanyl and midazolam exposure; delirium is unrelated to midazolam and may be linked to inflammatory status. These data suggest that iatrogenic coma and delirium are not mechanistically linked."
