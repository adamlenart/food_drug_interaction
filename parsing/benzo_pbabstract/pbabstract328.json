Main aspects of this important problem have been studied in the unit responsible for medico-psychological emergencies in the university hospital of Poitiers. Files of all patients admitted to the unit from January to December 1994 have been analysed and 598 patients were included in our study. Of these, 67 per cent were females. 31 per cent were 20 to 29 years old and for the most part unemployed (62.5 per cent). Drugs most commonly used are benzodiazepines (39 per cent), alone or often associated with alcohol (33 per cent). A fatal outcome was observed in one patient. In many cases (50 per cent) this was not the first episode of voluntary intoxication; 53 per cent of the patients were discharged from hospital after a psychiatric consultation. For many years, voluntary drug intoxication frequency has increased continually. All cases have a specific intention that we have to clarify in order to take effective preventive measures to prevent recidivism.", 
    "1": "Arteriolar relaxation caused by the application of muscarinic agonists is mediated by multiple factors. One factor causes dilation only at the point of drug microapplication (local response), and a second factor causes responses remote (500 microm away) from the site of application (conducted response). This study was performed to determine if different muscarinic subtypes mediate the two responses. Arterioles of anesthetized hamster cheek pouch were studied with videomicroscopy. Muscarinic antagonists methscopolamine, scopolamine, pirenzepine, 4-DAMP (4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide), and AFDX-116 [(11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one)] were cumulatively applied, and the K(B) for each antagonist was determined for the local and conducted responses caused by methacholine microapplication (10(-4) M, 5 s). The pK(B) (local, conducted) were not significantly different for the two responses when using scopolamine (10.5, 10.4). When the antagonist AFDX-116 (5.6, 6.3), selective for muscarinic receptor (m2) subtype was applied, the K(B) was greater for the conducted response. The pK(B) was greater, however, for the local response when the m1 subtype-selective pirenzepine (7.7, 6.9) or m3 subtype-selective 4-DAMP (10.1, 9.8) was applied. Thus the antagonist pK(B) ratio for on the local and conducted responses depends on the subtype selectivity of the antagonist. These data strongly suggest that different receptors are involved in the two responses.", 
    "2": "In a retrospective study, we evaluated the role of somatic disease and physical injury in the development and course of alcohol withdrawal delirium. Medical records of 1179 patients treated for alcohol withdrawal in Nowowiejski Hospital in Warsaw from 1973 to 1987 were reviewed using a structured questionnaire. Development, symptoms' severity, and the course of alcohol withdrawal delirium were assessed in possible relation to the somatic state of patients and other variables of alcohol dependence. Development of the first episode of delirium tremens (DT) was associated with the incidence of somatic disease or injury in 19% of cases. Somatic disorders directly preceded the second episode of DT in 73% and the third in 57% of cases. A positive correlation was found between the greater severity and/or longer duration of DT symptoms, and occurrence of pneumonia, coronary heart disease, alcohol liver disease, and anemia, as well as daily amount of alcohol consumed during the last drinking bout. There was no relationship of severity of DT with the duration of alcohol abuse. Early development and severe course of alcohol withdrawal delirium correlated with the late beginning of excessive drinking (over the age of 40) and concomitant abuse of benzodiazepines or barbiturates. We concluded that somatic disorders or physical injury might trigger delirium during alcohol withdrawal, and have essential influence on the symptoms' severity and duration of DT. A more severe course of DT is also correlated with the quantity of alcohol consumed and concomitant abuse of sedatives.", 
    "3": "The effects of a 10-day i.p. treatment of rats with diazepam on responses to subtype selective adenosine receptor agonists were studied 3 h, 2 and 8 days after termination of diazepam treatment in isolated cardiovascular tissues possessing distinct adenosine receptors. After long-lasting diazepam exposure, the relaxation elicited by the specific A2A receptor agonist CGS 21680 was enhanced in rat main pulmonary arteries (a tissue containing A2A adenosine receptors). The increased sensitivity of A2A receptors observed 3 h and 2 days after withdrawal of diazepam was completely restored by the 8th day of the wash-out period. N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA)-induced suppression in mechanical activity of electrically stimulated rat atrial myocardium (a tissue containing A1 adenosine receptors) was not altered following diazepam treatment. In order to reveal the possible role of inhibition of membrane adenosine transport in the effects of diazepam (a moderate inhibitor of membrane adenosine transport), the action of a 10-day treatment with dipyridamole or S-(p-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine (NBTI; prototypic adenosine uptake inhibitors) was also studied. Dipyridamole or NBTI treatment, like diazepam, increased the responsiveness of rat pulmonary artery to CGS 21680, but did not influence the cardiodepressive effect of CPA in electrically driven left atrial myocardium. The CGS 21680-induced relaxations were significantly antagonized by 10 nM ZM 241385 (a selective A2A adenosine receptor antagonist) in vessels of diazepam-treated rats. The relaxation responses to verapamil were unaltered in pulmonary arteries obtained from animals chronically treated with diazepam, dipyridamole or NBTI. These results suggest that chronic diazepam treatment is able to enhance the A2A adenosine receptor-mediated vascular functions, but does not modify the responses mediated via A1 receptors of rat myocardium, where nucleoside transport inhibitory sites of membrane are of a very low density. It is possible that sensitization of A2A adenosine receptor-mediated vasorelaxation is due to a long-lasting inhibition of membrane adenosine transporter during diazepam treatment.",

    "18": "Mechanical ventilation is a well-established strategy in intensive care medicine. ICU trauma patients require analgesia, and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time. The weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome, showing tachycardia, hypertonia, tachypnea and restlessness. Although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms, tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation. Adding sufentanil, an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl, tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency. In this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both, the patient and physician. In comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone, 72 patients treated with clonidine/sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation (4.8 vs 7.6 days) and until discharge from the ICU (7.7 vs 12.4 days). The number of reintubations caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16.0 to 2.8%.", 
    "19": "All children who presented in a convulsion, including convulsive status epilepticus, to the accident and emergency department over a 12-month period and who required treatment, were reviewed retrospectively to identify the effectiveness and safety of a specific treatment protocol. This protocol recommends the initial use of one, or if necessary, two doses of rectal or intravenous diazepam (0.4 mg/kg) followed by the simultaneous administration of phenytoin (18 mg/kg) and rectal paraldehyde (0.4 mL/kg), with instructions for maximum doses and timings of administration. Eighty-one evaluable children (52 male) were audited. The mean age of the study population was 4.1 (range 0.1 to 14.9) years. Overall, the presenting convulsion was successfully terminated in 76 children (94%) within the accident and emergency department. In 69 children (85% of the entire study population) this was after a single dose of diazepam (rectal in 41 and intravenous in 28). In only an additional two children did the presenting convulsion stop after a second dose of diazepam. In five of the 10 children (50%) who received paraldehyde and phenytoin as a combination, the convulsion stopped. Nine patients (11%) required admission to the intensive-care unit, five because of persisting convulsive activity, and four because of respiratory depression. The results of this retrospective audit suggest that the current treatment protocol appears to be effective and relatively safe in treating acute convulsions, including convulsive status epilepticus. The audit is to be repeated prospectively to either confirm or refute these findings before recommending any changes to the protocol.", 
    "20": "1. G protein-regulated inward rectifier K+ (GIRK) channels were over-expressed in dissociated rat superior cervical sympathetic (SCG) neurones by co-transfecting green fluorescent protein (GFP)-, GIRK1- and GIRK2-expressing plasmids using the biolistic technique. Membrane currents were subsequently recorded with whole-cell patch electrodes. 2. Co-transfected cells had larger Ba2+-sensitive inwardly rectifying currents and 13 mV more negative resting potentials (in 3 mM [K+]o) than non-transfected cells, or cells transfected with GIRK1 or GIRK2 alone. 3. Carbachol (CCh, 1-30 microM) increased the inwardly rectifying current in 70 % of GIRK1+ GIRK2-transfected cells by 261 +/- 53 % (n = 6, CCh 30 microM) at -120 mV, but had no effect in non-transfected cells or in cells transfected with GIRK1 or GIRK2 alone. Pertussis toxin prevented the effect of carbachol but had no effect on basal currents. 4. The effect of CCh was antagonized by 6 nM tripitramine but not by 100 nM pirenzepine, consistent with activation of endogenous M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. 5. In contrast, inhibition of the voltage-activated Ca2+ current by CCh was antagonized by 100 nM pirenzepine but not by 6 nM tripitramine, indicating that it was mediated by M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. 6. We conclude that endogenous M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors selectively couple to GIRK currents and Ca2+ currents respectively, with negligible cross-talk.", 
    "21": "Neuroactive steroids are potent, selective allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor function in the central nervous system, and may serve as endogenous anxiolytic and analgesic agents. In order to study the influence of subunit subtypes of the GABA(A) receptor on modulation of receptor function by neuroactive steroids, we expressed human recombinant GABA(A) receptors in Xenopus oocytes. GABA-activated membrane current, and the modulatory effects of the endogenous neurosteroid 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) and the synthetic steroid anesthetic 5alpha-pregnan-3alpha-ol-11,20-dione (alphaxalone) were measured using two-electrode voltage-clamp recording techniques. Allopregnanolone had similar effects to potentiate GABA-activated membrane current in the alpha1beta1gamma2L and alpha1beta2gamma2L receptor isoforms. In contrast, alphaxalone was much more effective as a positive allosteric modulator on the alpha1beta1gamma2L receptor isoform. In the absence of the gamma2L subunit subtype, allopregnanolone had much greater efficacy, but its potency was decreased. Allopregnanolone was much more effective on the alpha1beta1 receptor isoform compared with the alpha1beta2 receptor isoform. The potency for alphaxalone to potentiate the GABA response was not altered in the absence of the gamma2L subunit subtype, although its efficacy was greatly enhanced. Both allopregnanolone and alphaxalone produced nonparallel leftward shifts in the GABA concentration-response relationship in the absence of the gamma2L subunit, decreasing the EC50 concentration of GABA and increasing the maximal response. Only alphaxalone increased the maximal GABA response when the gamma2L subunit subtype was present. The 3beta-pregnane isomers epipregnanolone and isopregnanolone both inhibited the ability of allopregnanolone and alphaxalone to potentiate GABA(A) receptor function. However, the degree of block produced by the 3beta-pregnane steroid isomers was dependent on the type of receptor isoform studied and the neuroactive steroid tested. Isopregnanolone, the 3beta-isomer of allopregnanolone, was significantly more effective as a blocker of potentiation caused by allopregnanolone compared with alphaxalone in all receptor isoforms tested. Epipregnanolone had a greater efficacy as a blocker at the alpha1beta2gamma2L receptor isoform compared with the alpha1beta1gamma2L receptor isoform, and also produced a greater degree of block of potentiation caused by allopregnanolone compared with alphaxalone. Our results support the hypothesis that the heteromeric assembly of different GABA(A) receptor isoforms containing different subunit subtypes results in multiple steroid recognition sites on GABA(A) receptors, which in turn produces distinctly different modulatory interactions between neuroactive steroids acting at the GABA(A) receptor. The alpha and gamma subunit subtypes may have the greatest influence on allopregnanolone modulation of GABA(A) receptor function, whereas the beta and gamma subunit subtypes appear to be most important for the modulatory effects of alphaxalone.", 
    "22": "While conducting studies on the prevention of mortality from acute iron intoxication in rats, diazepam, given to prevent animal suffering, was observed to be associated with reduced mortality in a limited number of animals. The objective was to assess whether diazepam reduces mortality following acute iron intoxication in rats. Survival of rats was compared among groups receiving (i) orally 612 mg/kg iron alone (LD60), (ii) iron with a subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg/kg diazepam (DZ), or (iii) iron, DZ with 800 mg/kg deferiprone intraperitoneal injections. The administration of DZ decreased mortality from 60 to 16% (p < 0.001). The addition of deferiprone to DZ resulted in zero mortality (p < 0.05 compared with the DZ group) over the study period. The administration of DZ was not associated with decreased iron absorption or increased urinary iron excretion, whereas the administration of deferiprone did result in urinary iron excretion. Microscopic examination suggests that diazepam administration may be associated with lower intracellular accumulation of iron. In conclusion, diazepam reduces mortality from iron overdose in rats through a yet unidentified mechanism, although the drug does not inhibit iron absorption or enhance urinary iron removal.", 
    "23": "Two years after completion of a controlled outcome study of treatments for panic disorder with agoraphobia, patients were revisited and interviewed about their complaints. In the initial study, four treatments had been compared: (i) fluvoxamine combined with exposure; (ii) placebo medication plus exposure; (iii) psychological panic management plus exposure; and (iv) exposure alone. Comparison of the results at post-test had revealed superior efficacy of fluvoxamine combined with exposure over the other three treatments in reducing agoraphobic avoidance. The current naturalistic follow-up study investigated the long-term efficacy of the treatments with regard to abatement of complaints and reduced demand for further treatment. In addition, we examined whether patients were able to taper off the study medication without a recurrence of complaints. In total, 71 of the 76 patients of the original trial (93%) were interviewed. Comparison of the mean level of psychopathology at follow-up revealed no difference between the original treatment groups. The effect in the fluvoxamine plus exposure group was maintained, but was no longer superior, due to further improvements in the other treatment groups. Most patients received additional treatment during the follow-up period, usually because the 12 treatment sessions in the controlled study had yielded insufficient improvement. There was a trend for patients who received the fluvoxamine plus exposure treatment to require less aftercare than those who received the other treatments. Finally, almost 50% of the patients who had received medication in the original trial were able to taper off the use of fluvoxamine without a recurrence of complaints.", 
    "24": "Rats were bilaterally implanted with indwelling cannulae in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus, the entorrhinal cortex or the posterior parietal cortex. After recovery from surgery, they were trained in a one-trial step-down inhibitory avoidance task using a 0.3 mA footshock. The animals received i.p. 15 min before training either saline (1 ml/kg) or midazolam (1 mg/kg). Three hours after training they received, through the cannulae, infusions of saline, norepinephrine (0.3 microg/side), SKF38393 (7.5 microg/side), or 8-Br-cAMP (1.25 microg/side) into the brain regions mentioned. Animals were tested for retention 24 h after the training session. Midazolam produced anterograde amnesia, and the post-training treatments (with the exception of SKF38393 given into the entorrhinal cortex) caused retrograde memory facilitation. The amnestic effect of midazolam and the facilitatory effect of the treatments given into the brain cancelled each other out. Therefore, the mechanisms triggered by midazolam can interact with others in areas involved in memory processing several hours after their onset.", 
    "25": "Food deprived Wistar rats were exposed to a fixed time 60 s food schedule until they developed schedule-induced polydipsia. Rats were matched in pairs according to their licking rate, being designated experimental or yoked control at random. Every fifth lick by experimental rats was then followed by an electric shock (0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mA) while the food schedule continued in operation. Yoked-control rats received the same shocks as experimental rats, but independently of their own licking. Drugs were then tested on the suppressed rates of licking. Diazepam (0.5-2.0 mg/kg) increased punished schedule-induced polydipsia, a result not observed in yoked controls. No increases in the licks per minute of experimental or control animals were found after d-amphetamine (0.25-4.0 mg/kg) or buspirone (0.5-8.0 mg/kg). In comparison with previous results it is concluded that the antipunishment effects of drugs on schedule-induced behaviour depend on the type of punishment contingency.", 
    "26": "The present study examined the relationship between the intrinsic efficacy of benzodiazepines and their ability to reproduce the discriminative stimulus effects of pentobarbital. Rhesus monkeys (n=5) were trained to discriminate pentobarbital (10mg/kg) from saline using a discrete trials shock avoidance procedure (fixed-ratio 5). Drug-appropriate responding and response rate were assessed after intragastric administration of pentobarbital, the high efficacy benzodiazepines triazolam and clonazepam, and the low efficacy benzodiazepines imidazenil and bretazenil. Pentobarbital increased drug-appropriate responding to 100% and decreased the response rate. Triazolam and clonazepam occasioned 80% or greater drug-appropriate responding in four out of four monkeys, and decreased response rate in three out of four monkeys. The antagonist flumazenil decreased drug-appropriate responding and increased response rate after triazolam and clonazepam, consistent with antagonism of the discriminative stimulus and the rate-altering effects of these ligands. Imidazenil occasioned 80% or greater drug-appropriate responding in three out of four monkeys and suppressed the response rate in two out of four monkeys, whereas bretazenil occasioned 80% or greater drug-appropriate responding in two out of four monkeys and decreased the response rate slightly. Bretazenil, when co-administered with a dose of triazolam that produced 90-100% drug-appropriate responding, decreased responding to 0-60% but did not alter the rate-suppressing effects of this ligand. The rank order of potency (based on pmol/kg ED, values) was: triazolam > clonazepam > or = imidazenil > bretazenil. These results demonstrate differences in the pentobarbital-like discriminative stimulus and response rate-decreasing effects among benzodiazepine agonists. Specifically, full agonists engendered pentobarbital-like responding in all subjects with decreased response rates in most subjects, whereas partial agonists engendered pentobarbital-like responding and decreased response rates in subsets of subjects.", 
    "27": "The present experiments compared the anxiolytic-like effects of the benzodiazepine (BZD) hypnotic triazolam with those of four non-BZD hypnotics including one non-selective (zopiclone) and three omega1-BZD selective (zolpidem, zaleplon and SX-3228) receptor ligands, in classical animal models including conflict tests (punished lever pressing and punished drinking tests in rats) and exploratory models (elevated plus-maze test in rats and light/dark choice test in mice), and a recently developed mouse defence test battery (MDTB) which has been validated for the screening of anxiolytic drugs. Results from both conflict procedures showed that zopiclone (0.3-10 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic-like effects comparable to those of triazolam (0.1-3 mg/kg), whereas the selective omega1-BZD receptor hypnotics zolpidem (0.3-3 mg/kg), zaleplon (0.1-3 mg/kg) and SX-3228 (0.1-1 mg/kg) displayed weaker and/or non-specific anxiolytic-like effects. Similarly, in the light/dark test in mice, zolpidem (0.1-1 mg/kg), zaleplon (0.3-10 mg/kg) and SX-3228 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) showed a reduced potential to produce anxiolytic-like effects as compared to the non-selective omega-BZD receptor hypnotics triazolam (0.03-1 mg/kg) and zopiclone (1-30 mg/kg). In the elevated plus-maze test, zopiclone (1-10 mg/kg), zolpidem (0.1-1 mg/kg), zaleplon (0.3-3 mg/kg) and SX-3228 (0.1-1 mg/kg) displayed anxiolytic-like activity at doses close to those producing behavioural impairment, whereas triazolam (0.03-1 mg/kg) exhibited anxiolytic-like effects over a wide dose range in the absence of decreases in general activity. In the MDTB, zaleplon (0.3-10 mg/kg) decreased all defensive responses, a profile which was similar to that of triazolam (0.03-1 mg/kg), while zopiclone (1-30 mg/kg), zolpidem (0.3-10 mg/kg) and SX-3228 (0.03-1 mg/kg) had fewer effects on defensive behaviours with several effects occurring only at motor-impairing doses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, although selective omega1-BZD receptor hypnotics display anxiolytic-like activity, the effects are generally weaker than those observed with non-selective omega-BZD receptor selective hypnotics such as triazolam or zopiclone. In particular, the anxiety-reducing potential of the omega1-BZD receptor selective compounds is limited to certain anxiety measures and may be confounded and/or masked by behavioural suppression.", 
    "28": "The present study was designed to examine the effects of oxazepam on implicit vs explicit memory processes, as a function of this drug's time course. The effects of oxazepam (30 mg) or placebo on directly comparable tests of implicit memory (word stem completion) and explicit memory (cued recall) were examined at three time points: 100 min post-drug administration (prior to the theoretical peak plasma concentration of oxazepam; i.e.'pre-peak' condition), 170 min post-drug (close to theoretical peak; i.e. 'peak' condition) or 240 min post-drug (following theoretical peak: i.e. 'post-peak' condition). Sixty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to either the drug condition or the placebo condition in a double-blind design and were tested on both memory tests at one of the three time points. In the 'pre-peak' condition, oxazepam impaired cued recall performance relative to placebo but did not impair priming. In the 'peak' condition, oxazepam impaired performance on both memory tasks. In the 'post-peak' condition, cued recall performance in the oxazepam group remained significantly impaired relative to placebo. However, oxazepam-induced impairments in priming were only marginal, suggesting that oxazepam-induced impairments in implicit memory processes begin to wane following theoretical peak drug concentrations. The fact that oxazepam-induced priming impairments were significant only when the word stem completion task was administered close to peak plasma concentrations, supports the hypothesis that benzodiazepines exert time-dependent effects on implicit memory processes. The results also support the theoretical distinction between implicit and explicit memory processes, since the directly comparable implicit and explicit tasks showed different impairment curves over time.", 
    "29": "Antipsychotic drugs (neuroleptics, major tranquillizers) are frequently prescribed for the relief of anxiety symptoms. A recent survey of a representative sample of psychiatrists found that these drugs are often given to patients who are not suffering from psychotic disorders, a practice that also appears to be common among general practitioners. Many authors have commented on the value of antipsychotics in relieving anxiety symptoms, both in the short and long term, as an alternative to benzodiazepines (with their associated risk of possible tolerance and dependence), although few recent papers recommend their use in this respect. This paper summarizes the evidence from treatment studies of antipsychotic drugs in patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and compares this with the advice given in major psychiatric textbooks. Most of the studies identified on the use of antipsychotic drugs in GADs appear to have major methodological flaws, and no study has considered the benefit/risk ratio carefully.", 
    "30": "Although community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains a major cause of hospitalization and death, few studies on risk factors have been performed. A population-based case-control study of risk factors for CAP was carried out in a mixed residential-industrial urban area of 74,610 adult inhabitants in the Maresme (Barcelona, Spain) between 1993 and 1995. All patients living in the area and clinically suspected of having CAP at primary care facilities and hospitals were registered. In total, 205 patients with symptoms, signs and radiographic infiltrate compatible with acute CAP participated in the study. They were matched by municipality, sex and age with 475 controls randomly selected from the municipal census. Risk factors relating the subject's characteristics and habits, housing conditions, medical history and treatments were investigated by means of a questionnaire. In the univariate analysis, an increased risk of CAP was associated with low body mass index, smoking, respiratory infection, previous pneumonia, chronic lung disease, lung tuberculosis, asthma, treated diabetes, chronic liver disease, and treatments with aminophiline, aerosols and plastic pear-spacers. In multivariate models, the only statistically significant risk factors were current smoking of >20 cigarettes x day(-1) (odds ratio (OR)=2.77; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14-6.70 compared with never-smokers), previous respiratory infection (OR=2.73; 95% CI 1.75-4.26), and chronic bronchitis (OR=2.22; 95% CI 1.13-4.37). Benzodiazepines were found to be protective in univariate and multivariate analysis (OR=0.46; 95% CI 0.23-0.94). This population-based study provides new and better established evidence on the factors associated with the occurrence of pneumonia in the adult community.",

The number and affinity of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites, and 5alpha-3alpha-P potentiation of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding to the GABAA receptor were determined at each age. There was no age effect on the affinity (Kd) for [3H]flunitrazepam. However, the number (Bmax) of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites doubled between GD 40 and GD 62, and then declined slightly to reach adult levels by PD 11. 5alpha-3alpha-P produced a concentration-dependent potentiation of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding at each developmental age examined. The potency (high-affinity) for 5alpha-3alpha-P potentiation of both [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding was lowest at GD 40, and increased to adult levels by GD 62. In contrast, the efficacy for 5alpha-3alpha-P potentiation of both [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam binding was greatest at GD 40, and decreased to adult levels between GD 50 and GD 62. The percentage of high-affinity zolpidem binding sites increased in an age-dependent manner from 34.2+/-2.2% at GD 40, to reach adult levels by GD 62 (59. 4+/-2.5%). These data suggest that 5alpha-3alpha-P can modulate GABAA receptors in the immature cerebral cortex, and that changes in 5alpha-3alpha-P action are temporally related to changes in GABAA receptor benzodiazepine pharmacology late in gestation in the guinea pig.", 
    "33": "To evaluate the extent of drug-drug interaction concerning metabolic inhibition in the liver quantitatively, we tried to predict the plasma concentration increasing ratio of midazolam (MDZ) by itraconazole (ITZ) or ketoconazole (KTZ) in rats. MDZ was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg through the portal vein at 60 min after bolus administration of 20 mg/kg ITZ or during 0.33 mg/h/body of KTZ infusion. The ratio values in the area under the plasma concentration curve of MDZ in the presence of ITZ and KTZ was 2.14 and 1.67, respectively. The liver-unbound concentration to plasma-unbound concentration ratios of ITZ and KTZ were 11 approximately 14 and 1.3, respectively, suggesting a concentrative uptake of both drugs into the liver. ITZ and KTZ competitively inhibited the oxidative metabolism of MDZ in rat liver microsomes, and Ki values of ITZ and KTZ were 0.23 microM and 0.16 microM, respectively. We predicted the ratio values of MDZ in the presence of ITZ and KTZ, using Ki values and unbound concentrations of both drugs in the plasma or liver. The predicted ratio values in the presence of ITZ or KTZ calculated by using unbound concentration in the plasma were 1.03 approximately 1.05 and 1.39, whereas those calculated using unbound concentration in the liver were 1.73 approximately 1.97 and 1.51, respectively, which were very close to the observed ratio values. These findings indicated the necessity to consider the concentrative uptake of inhibitors into the liver for the quantitative prediction of the drug-drug interactions concerning metabolic inhibition in the liver.", 
    "34": "The benzodiazepines flunitrazepam, diazepam, and Ro 15-1788 and the beta-carboline DMCM bind with equivalent affinity to the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors containing different alpha subunits (i.e., alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, or alpha 5); whereas, the triazolopyridazine CL 218,872 and imidazopyridine zolpidem have higher affinity for alpha 1 subunit-containing GABAA receptors. In the present study, the in vivo binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 in mouse cerebellum and spinal cord was used to establish the occupancy of the benzodiazepine binding site of GABAA receptors containing primarily alpha 1 and alpha 2/alpha 3 subunits, respectively. Thus, the nonselective compounds flunitrazepam, diazepam, and DMCM all produced a similar inhibition of binding in cerebellum and spinal cord (respective ID50 values of 0.2 to 0.3 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg i.p.); whereas, the alpha 1 selective compounds CL 218,872 and zolpidem were more potent at inhibiting [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in the cerebellum (ID50 values 4.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg i.p.) compared to the spinal cord (ID50 values 12 mg/kg and > 30 mg/kg i.p.). Thus, the reduction of in vivo f[3H]Ro 15-1788 binding in tissues containing alpha 1 and alpha 2/alpha 3 receptor populations reflects the in vitro affinities of subtype selective compounds and should help to interpret the behavioral profile of such compounds.", 
    "35": "Previously, we reported the direct design of highly potent nonpeptide 3-oxo-1,4-benzodiazepine fibrinogen receptor antagonists from a constrained, RGD-containing cyclic semipeptide. The critical features incorporated into the design of these nonpeptides were the exocyclic amide at the 8-position which overlaid the Arg carbonyl, the phenyl ring which maintained an extended Gly conformation, and the diazepine ring which mimicked the gamma-turn at Asp. In this paper, we investigate conformational preferences of the 8-substituted benzodiazepine analogues by examining structural modifications to both the exocyclic amide and the seven-membered diazepine ring and by studying the conformation of the benzodiazepine ring using molecular modeling, X-ray crystallography, and NMR. We found that the directionality of the amide at the 8-position had little effect on activity and the (E)-olefin analogue retained significant potency, indicating that the trans orientation of the amide, and not the carbonyl or NH groups, made the largest contribution to the observed activity. For the diazepine ring, with the exception of the closely analogous 3-oxo-2-benzazepine ring system described previously, all of the modifications led to a significant reduction in activity compared to the potent 3-oxo-1, 4-benzodiazepine parent ring system, implicating this particular type of ring system as a desirable structural feature for high potency. Energy minimizations of a number of the modified analogues revealed that none could adopt the same low-energy conformation as the one shared by the active (S)-isomer of the 3-oxo-1, 4-benzodiazepines and 3-oxo-2-benzazepines. The overall data suggest that the features contributing to the observed high potency in this series are the orientation of the 3-4 amide and the conformational constraint imposed by the seven-membered ring, both of which position the key acidic and basic groups in the proper spatial relationship.", 
    "36": "Lectin-binding studies have been performed on rat zymogen granules to investigate alterations in the carbohydrate membrane composition that occur in acute pancreatitis induced by caerulein. The influence of treatment with hydrocortisone for seven days before inducing pancreatitis was also studied. Lectin labeling on zymogen granules was also analyzed seven days after inducing pancreatitis in rats that had previously received a hydrocortisone treatment. During this period L 364,718 (0.1 mg/kg)--specific cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist--was administered daily to some of the rats, and no treatment was applied to others. Using fluorescein-labelled T. purpureus (TP)lectin, a significant decrease in the amount of L-fucose in the granule membrane was observed in rats with caerulein-induced pancreatitis. This effect was directly caused by the pancreatitis and was not influenced by previous hydrocortisone treatment. Seven days later, the density of TP receptors in the granule membrane was similar to the controls both in L-364,718-treated and untreated rats. Therefore, we suggest that endogenous CCK is not an essential factor in the recovery of L-fucose containing glycoconjugates the granule membrane after pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis did not alter the expression of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) receptors in the zymogen granule membrane. WGA specifically binds N-acetyl glucosamine and sialic acids. L 364,718 administered for seven days after inducing pancreatitis significantly reduced WGA binding, untreated rats showed a normal zymogen granule membrane. Therefore, the blockade of CCK-induced alterations in membrane glycoconjugates enriched in N-acetyl glucosamine and sialic acid of newly formed granules after pancreatitis, a finding that could explain the delay in the regression of the disease.",

Together with the \"magic\" pills already available, as amphetamines, benzodiazepines and antidepressants, Viagra and new compounds to control lipid metabolism, appear to open new avenues to individual self-determination and self-improvement. Also new biotechnological resources allow today a far more manipulated control of procreation. Designed to target specific groups of patients with well-defined psycho-physiological problems, these new drugs and biotechnologies are becoming available to the larger public. Incorrect information by the mass media, insufficient control by some physicians and self-promoting attitudes in healthy subjects may combine into a powerful cocktail, creating confusion and leading to an incorrect use of these drugs. Can individuals really improve themselves in this fashion or are they just abusing drugs for their own purposes? Are the costs of these drugs and procedures socially justified?",

Supplemental sufentanil (cumulative maximum of 5 micrograms.kg-1) was given for adverse haemodynamic responses. Group II (n = 16) received 5 micrograms.kg-1 sufentanil at induction. Additional sufentanil (maximum 5 micrograms.kg-1), and enflurane (0-3% inspired concentration) were administered for adverse haemodynamic responses. Haemodynamics, myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2), and lactate extraction were determined at the following times: I) awake (AWA), 2) after induction (IND), and 3) after tracheal intubation (ETT).", 
    "40": "Systemic haemodynamics and myocardial metabolism were similar at AWA. Heart rate response was attenuated and MVO2 reduced in Group I at IND (P < 0.05). Following AWA, myocardial lactate production (MLP) occurred more frequently in Group II vs Group I patients (9/16 vs 2/16) and at more individual measurement points (Group II: 10/64 vs Group I: 3/64).

    "42": "Postnatal development of hippocampal dentate granule cell gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor pharmacological properties was studied. Granule cells were acutely isolated from hippocampi of 7- to 14- and 45- to 52-day-old rats, and whole cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained. The sensitivity of GABAA receptors to GABA and modulation of GABAA receptor currents by benzodiazepines (BZ), zinc, furosemide, and loreclezole was studied. Multiple changes in the pharmacological properties of dentate granule-cell GABAA receptors occurred during the first 52 days of postnatal development: GABA-evoked maximal current increased with postnatal age; GABAA receptors changed from BZ type 3 in young rats to BZ type 1 in adult rats; furosemide and zinc inhibited GABAA receptor currents in young rats but not in adult rats; the fraction of cells that expressed loreclezole-sensitive GABAA receptors increased with postnatal age. These findings suggest that dentate granule cells in young and adult animals express pharmacologically distinct GABAA receptors and that the postnatal development of these receptors is prolonged, lasting at least 45 days. Comparison with the previously reported pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors on dentate granule cells acutely isolated from hippocampi of 28- to 35-day-old rats suggests that receptors expressed at that age have properties intermediate between young and adult rats.", 
    "43": "Modulation of GABA function following 1 week oral administration of flurazepam (FZP) was investigated in chloride-loaded, rat hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. Rats were sacrificed 2 or 7 days after ending drug treatment, when anticonvulsant tolerance was present or absent in vivo, respectively. Spontaneous (s)IPSCs and miniature (m)IPSCs were recorded using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques. s/mIPSCs were bicuculline-sensitive, voltage-dependent, and reversed their polarity at 0 mV, the predicted E(Cl-). Comparisons of s/mIPSCs between FZP-treated and control groups were made at Vh = -90, -70, and -50 mV. The frequency of sIPSCs, but not mIPSCs, was significantly decreased in FZP-treated neurons 2 days, but not 7 days, after FZP treatment, suggesting a decrease in interneuron activity. These conclusions were supported by the negative findings of additional studies of [3H]GABA release from hippocampal slices and [3H]GABA uptake from hippocampal synaptosomes. The lack of change in the paired-pulse depression of GABA(B)-mediated IPSPs suggested that autoreceptor function was also not impaired following chronic FZP treatment. A large reduction in both sIPSC and mIPSC amplitude (60%) in FZP-treated neurons, the absence of mIPSCs in one-third of FZP-treated cells, and a measurable reduction in synaptic and unitary conductance confirmed that postsynaptic GABA(A) receptor function was profoundly impaired in FZP-treated CA1 neurons. Zolpidem, an alpha1-selective benzodiazepine receptor ligand, enhanced mIPSC amplitude and decay, but its ability to prolong mIPSC decay was reduced in FZP-treated neurons. Several pre- and postsynaptic changes at GABAergic synapses on CA1 pyramidal cells might be related to the decreased tonic GABA inhibition in FZP-treated CA1 neurons associated with the expression of benzodiazepine anticonvulsant tolerance.", 
    "44": "In rats, rapid eye movement sleep can be induced by microinjection of either the cholinergic agonist carbachol or the neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide into the oral pontine reticular nucleus. Possible involvement of cholinergic mechanisms in the effect of vasoactive intestinal peptide was investigated using muscarinic receptor ligands. Sleep-waking cycles were analysed after infusion into the oral pontine reticular nucleus of vasoactive intestinal peptide (10 ng in 0.1 microl), carbachol (20 ng), atropine (200 ng) and pirenzepine (50, 100 ng), performed separately or in combination at 15-min intervals. The increase in rapid eye movement sleep due to the combined infusion of vasoactive intestinal peptide and carbachol (+58.7+/-4.6% for 8 h, P<0.05) was not significantly different from that induced by each compound separately. The enhancement of rapid eye movement sleep by vasoactive intestinal peptide was totally prevented by infusion of atropine, but not pirenzepine, a relatively selective M1 antagonist. On their own, none of the latter two compounds affected the sleep-waking cycle. Quantitative autoradiographic studies using [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (1 nM) and pirenzepine (0.5 microM) indicated that muscarinic receptors correspond to pirenzepine-insensitive binding sites in the oral pontine reticular nucleus. In vitro, vasoactive intestinal peptide (1-100 nM) significantly increased (+30-40%) the specific binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate to the oral pontine reticular nucleus in rat brain sections. This effect appeared to be due to an increased density, with no change in affinity, of pirenzepine-insensitive binding sites in this area. These data suggest that pirenzepine-insensitive muscarinic binding sites are involved in the induction of rapid eye movement sleep by vasoactive intestinal peptide at the pontine level in the rat.", 
    "45": "In the present study, a cationic membrane conductance activated by the acetylcholine agonist carbachol was characterized in vitro in neurons of the basolateral amygdala. Extracellular perfusion of the K+ channel blockers Ba2+ and Cs+ or loading of cells with cesium acetate did not affect the carbachol-induced depolarization. Similarly, superfusion with low-Ca2+ solution plus Ba2+ and intracellular EGTA did not affect the carbachol-induced depolarization, suggesting a Ca2+-independent mechanism. On the other hand, the carbachol-induced depolarization was highly sensitive to changes in extracellular K+ or Na+. When the K+ concentration in the perfusion medium was increased from 4.7 to 10 mM, the response to carbachol increased in amplitude. In contrast, lowering the extracellular Na+ concentration from 143.2 to 29 mM abolished the response in a reversible manner. Results of coapplication of carbachol and atropine, pirenzepine or gallamine indicate that the carbachol-induced depolarization was mediated by muscarinic cholinergic receptors, but not the muscarinic receptor subtypes M1, M2 or M4, specifically. These data indicate that, in addition to the previously described reduction of a time- and voltage-independent K+ current (IKleak), a voltage- and time-dependent K+ current (IM), a slow Ca2+-activated K+ current (sIahp) and the activation of a hyperpolarization-activated inward rectifier K+ current (IQ), carbachol activated a Ca2+-independent non-selective cationic conductance that was highly sensitive to extracellular K+ and Na+ concentrations.", 
    "46": "1. Proliferative effects of CCK peptides have been examined in rat anterior pituitary GH3 cells, which express CCK2 receptors. 2. CCK-8s, gastrin(1-17) and its glycine-extended precursor G(1-17)-Gly, previously reported to cause proliferation via putative novel sites on AR4-2J and Swiss 3T3 cells, elicited significant dose dependent increases of similar magnitude in [3H]thymidine incorporation over 3 days in serum-free medium of 39 +/- 10% (P < 0.01, n = 20), 37 +/- 8% (P < 0.01, n = 27) and 41 +/- 6% (P < 0.01, n = 36) respectively. 3. CCK-8s and gastrin potentially stimulated mitogenesis (EC50 values 0.12 nM and 3.0 nM respectively), whilst G-Gly displayed similar efficacy but markedly lower potency. L-365,260 consistently blocked each peptide. The CCK2 receptor affinity of G-Gly in GH3 cells was 1.09 microM (1.01;1.17, n = 6) and 5.53 microM (3.71;5.99, n = 4) in guinea-pig cortex. 4. 1 microM G-Gly weakly stimulated Ca2+ increase, eliciting a 104 +/- 21% increase over basal Ca2+ levels, and was blocked by 1 microM L-365,260 whilst CCK-8s (100 nM) produced a much larger Ca2+ response (331 +/- 14%). 5. Insulin dose dependently enhanced proliferative effects of CCK-8s with a maximal leftwards shift of the CCK-8s curve at 100 ng ml(-1) (17 nM) (EC50 decreased 500 fold, from 0.1 nM to 0.2 pM; P < 0.0001). 10 microg ml(-1) insulin was supramaximal reducing the EC50 to 5 pM (P = 0.027) whilst 1 ng ml(-1) insulin was ineffective. Insulin weakly displaced [125I]BHCCK binding to GH3 CCK2 receptors (IC50 3.6 microM). 6. Results are consistent with mediation of G-Gly effects via CCK2 receptors in GH3 cells and reinforce the role of CCK2 receptors in control of cell growth. Effects of insulin in enhancing CCK proliferative potency may suggest that CCK2 and insulin receptors converge on common intracellular targets and indicates that mitogenic stimuli are influenced by the combination of extracellular factors present.", 
    "47": "We recorded steady state serum concentrations of olanzapine in 56 psychiatric patients under routine conditions. Twenty-two patients (39%) underwent monotherapy; the rest received additional psychotropic drugs. Doses were given once daily in the evening, and serum olanzapine levels were measured 12 hours later. For the whole group, the concentration-to-dose ratio (C/D) varied 26-fold, with a median value of 4.8 (nmol/L)/(mg/24 hours), but 80% of the patients had C/D values within the range 2 to 10 (nmol/L)/(mg/24 hours). All but three patients received standard doses (5-20 mg/24 hours), of whom 80% had serum concentrations of olanzapine within the range 22 to 146 nmol/L. Patients comedicated with potential inhibitors of CYP2D6 and other drugs displayed a median C/D approximately 40% higher than the group undergoing monotherapy. Patients comedicated with carbamazepine had a median C/D 36% lower than that of the monotherapy group. Therefore, the serum concentration range (12-hour values) of 25 to 150 nmol/L can be expected for patients receiving a standard daily dose.", 
    "48": "The effect of intravenous midazolam on persistent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was compared to placebo in a prospective randomized double-blind study. Twenty patients aged 18 to 82 years with persistent PONV resistant to standard anti-emetics and present for greater than six hours were randomized to receive either an intravenous infusion of midazolam 1.0 mg/h or placebo. Nausea (P = 0.04), vomiting (P = 0.02) and the use of rescue anti-emetics (P = 0.003) were significantly less in the midazolam group. We conclude that low-dose intravenous infusion of midazolam significantly reduces persistent PONV.",

(4) Direct activation by pentobarbital produced a similar maximum response on alpha1beta1epsilon and alpha1beta1gamma2s, however, both the EC50 and slope were lower on alpha1beta1epsilon compared to alpha1beta1gamma2s.

    "50": "1. Intravenous anaesthetics, including propofol and thiopental have at least three distinct effects on GABA(A) receptor function. 2. Low concentrations of these drugs enhance the amplitude of currents evoked by sub-saturating concentrations of GABA whereas higher concentrations directly activate the receptor in the absence of GABA. 3. Propofol and some barbiturates also decrease the rate and extent of desensitization as indicated by a prolongation in the decay of currents evoked by saturating concentrations of GABA. 4. In contrast, sedative benzodiazepines that lack general anaesthetic properties do not directly activate the GABA(A) receptor. 5. In addition, benzodiazepines such as midazolam, have no effect on desensitization when examined in the presence of saturating concentrations of GABA. 6. Here, we discuss the effects of intravenous general anaesthetic on desensitization of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "51": "1. The intravenous anaesthetic etomidate augments GABA-gated chloride currents (indirect action) and, at higher concentrations, evokes chloride currents in the absence of GABA (direct action). 2. In order to identify amino acid residues essential for these actions, site directed mutagenesis was performed on the beta3 subunit. 3. Mutation of an asparagine to a serine residue at position 290 dramatically reduced both etomidate-induced chloride currents and its ability to enhance [3H]flunitrazepam binding in HEK293 cells expressing alpha1beta3gamma2 recombinant GABA(A) receptors. 4. In contrast, the indirect effect of etomidate was retained, though its potency was reduced. 5. These findings indicate that there are distinct requirements for these dual actions of etomidate at GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "52": "Oxytocin (OT) facilitates the onset of maternal behaviour in the late pregnant rat, enhances uterine contractility at parturition, and elicits milk ejection during lactation. If the rising estradiol (E2 and declining progesterone (P) of late pregnancy is reproduced in a virgin ovariectomized rat by implanting E2- and P-filled capsules for 2 weeks followed by removal of P-containing implants 36-48 h prior to death, OT messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels increase in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei (PVN and SON) of the rat. Both E2 administration and P withdrawal are necessary to increase OT mRNA, but the mechanisms of these effects are not understood. P may work within the PVN although P receptors are reported to be sparse or non-existent in the PVN or outside the PVN on PR-containing neurones that project to OT-containing neurones or via membrane bound receptors that are known to bind neurosteroids and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). To determine the mechanism through which P may inhibit or P withdrawal may increase OT mRNA levels, virgin ovariectomized (OVX) rats received sequential E2 and P via Silastic implants for 14 days. On day 13, prior to removal of P capsules on day 14, the rats were given the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, or saline injections subcutaneously (s.c.) twice daily until death on day 16. OT mRNA levels were increased in the steroid-treated group that received saline but not diazepam. In experiment 2, P capsules were removed on day 14 or pharmacological P withdrawal was induced by injecting RU486 injections s.c. twice daily until death 48 h later. OT mRNA levels were increased in the steroid-treated group that received RU486. Subsequent studies demonstrated the expression of PR mRNA within the rat PVN. The data suggest that gonadal steroids may influence PVN OT mRNA levels by modulating the GABA(A) receptor or by directly altering gene transcription via the PR.", 
    "53": "The Diazepam Binding Inhibitor/Acyl-CoA Binding Protein (DBI/ACBP) has been implicated in different functions, as acyl-CoA transporter and as an endogenous ligand at the GABA(A) receptor and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). The latter is thought to be involved in control of steroidogenesis. We studied the ontogeny of DBI/ACBP and PBR mRNA expression in embryos and offspring of time-pregnant Long Evans rats by in-situ hybridization with 33P-endlabelled oligonucleotides. Both mRNAs were present in embryo and placenta at gestational day (G)11, the earliest stage studied. DBI/ACBP mRNA was strongly expressed from embryonic through mid-foetal stages in central nervous system (maximum in neuroepithelium), cranial and sympathetic ganglia, anterior pituitary, adrenal cortex, thyroid, thymus, liver and (late foetal) brown adipose tissue, moderately in testis, heart, lung and kidney. In brain, a late foetal decrease of DBI/ACBP mRNA was followed by an increase at postnatal day 6. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor mRNA expression started very low and increased to moderate levels in adrenal cortex and medulla, testis, thyroid, brown adipose tissue, liver, heart, lung, salivary gland at mid- to late-foetal stages. Data suggest a significant role of DBI/ACBP at early developmental stages. Both proteins may be involved in the control of foetal steroidogenesis. However, differences in developmental patterns indicate that additional functions may be equally important during ontogeny, such as the involvement in lipid metabolism in the case of DBI/ACBP.", 
    "54": "Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) is an emerging drug for alcoholism therapy. We present a case of GHB withdrawal syndrome secondary to GHB addiction during alcoholism treatment. A complete disappearance of drug withdrawal syndrome was achieved with oral diazepam and the symptoms resolved without sequelae. GHB has been used for alcoholism therapy for only a few years now, but the trend is increasing, and other cases similar to this one are foreseeable. This risk could be higher in some countries in which GHB use is increasing not for alcoholism therapy, but for its euphoric and anabolic effects. The present experience indicates that administration of benzodiazepines would seem to be sufficient to achieve total regression of the withdrawal syndrome in a short time, at least if recognized early.", 
    "55": "Incidental case reports suggest that some parkinsonian patients treated with dopaminergic drugs complain of drowsiness but few controlled data are available. We compared the sedative effects of L-Dopa (200 mg + 50 mg benserazide, PO), triazolam (0.125 mg) and placebo in a randomized double-blind cross-over design in 22 healthy volunteers pretreated with domperidone (60 mg/day). Drowsiness was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS), a computerized choice reaction time test (CRT) and an electro-oculogram (EOG). L-Dopa and triazolam induced significant drowsiness, compared to placebo, on VAS, CRT and some EOG parameters. After this first evaluation session, all subjects were chronically treated for 11 days with 600 mg/d of L-Dopa. Drowsiness induced by L-Dopa, triazolam or placebo was then tested again on three consecutive days to assess putative dopaminergic tolerance. After chronic L-Dopa treatment, triazolam-induced sedation remained unchanged while L-Dopa sedative effects were no longer significant except on the VAS, preventing the conclusion that tolerance occurred. These data suggest that an acute dose of L-Dopa induces sedation in L-Dopa-naive subjects. This sedative effect must be considered in clinical practice and when studying the effects of L-Dopa on motor or neuropsychological performance, especially in acute tests.", 
    "56": "It has been shown that abused solvents, such as 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE) and toluene, share certain pharmacological properties with central nervous system depressants, such as alcohol and anesthetic vapors. Several vapors were tested for diazepam (DZ)- and phencyclidine (PCP)-like discriminative stimulus effects to further explore their pharmacological specificity. In DZ-trained mice, methoxyflurane fully substituted, and TCE produced partial substitution. Fluorothyl and toluene produced no appreciable DZ-lever responding at any concentration tested. On the other hand, toluene produced concentration-related partial substitution for PCP, whereas methoxyflurane, TCE, and fluorothyl did not substitute. The substitution of some these vapors for DZ or PCP suggests that, like ethanol, the discriminative stimulus effects of abused solvents partially overlap those of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists as well as those of gamma amino butyric acid agonists.", 
    "57": "The anxiolytic and discriminative stimulus effects of drugs in the same rats during a single session were examined in this study. Rats were trained to discriminate diazepam (5 mg/kg) from vehicle in a 2-lever drug discrimination procedure and were then trained to press a 3rd lever under a multiple fixed-interval (60 sec), fixed-ratio 5 + shock schedule of food reward. Diazepam produced substitution for itself in all rats; however, it produced antipunishment effects in some of the rats, suggesting that its discriminative stimulus and antipunishment effects are separable. In contrast, the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, NPC 17742 and phencyclidine, failed to substitute fully for diazepam and did not increase punished responding in any of the rats. These results are consistent with those of studies showing that drugs from this class produce weaker antipunishment effects than diazepam does. The potential utility of this new method is that it allows direct comparisons of the antipunishment and discriminative stimulus effects of putative anxiolytic drugs during a single session with the same animals.", 
    "58": "In 30 patients (ASA-1) for elective Cesarean section who had given informed consent, characteristics of amnesia induced by midazolam (M) and their modulation by flumazenil (F) were examined. Spinal anesthesia was performed with dibucaine. After the delivery, the baby was shown to the mother. Then 21 patients were given bolus intravenous injection of M until the patient got into sleep and the inhalation of nitrous oxide mixed with oxygen was started. At the end of surgery bolus injection of F 0.1 mg was cumulatively repeated until the patient awoke. Nine patients were given only nitrous oxide and oxygen inhalation after the delivery. The remembrance of the baby face and the doses of M and F were compared. In group given M, 14 patients recalled their baby's face whereas 7 did not. The average doses of M and F in patients with memory were 69 micrograms.kg-1 and 2.5 micrograms.kg-1, respectively, whereas the average dose of M and F in patients without memory were 94 micrograms.kg-1 and 4.2 micrograms.kg-1, respectively. In the patients without M injection, all could recall the face of the baby. These results suggest that M could produce retrograde amnesia, when combined with nitrous oxide inhalation, which is not reversed by F.",

Early treatment before admission to hospital is best with an effective medication that can be administered safely. We aimed to find out whether there are differences in efficacy and adverse events between buccal administration of liquid midazolam and rectal administration of liquid diazepam in the acute treatment of seizures.", 
    "60": "At a residential school with on-site medical facilities 42 young people with severe epilepsy were enrolled. Continuous seizures of more than 5 min duration were randomly treated with buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam. If the seizure did not stop within 10 min additional medication chosen by the attending physician was administered. We monitored oxygen saturation and blood pressure for 30 min after treatment. The main outcome measures were efficacy, time from arrival of the nurse to drug administration, time from drug administration to end of seizure, and incidence of adverse cardiorespiratory events.", 
    "61": "Buccal midazolam was used to treat 40 seizures in 14 students, and rectal diazepam 39 seizures in 14 students. Midazolam stopped 30 (75%) of 40 seizures and diazepam 23 (59%) of 39 (p=0.16). The median time from arrival of the nurse to administration of medication was 2 min. Time from administration to end of seizure did not differ significantly between the two treatments. No clinically important adverse cardiorespiratory events were identified in the two groups. Buccal midazolam was universally acceptable to the nursing and care staff.",

    "63": "All the benzodiazepines (BZDs) in clinical use have the capacity to promote the binding of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA), to sub-types of GABA receptors which exist as multi-subunit ligand-gated chloride channels. Thus, the BZDs facilitate the actions of GABA in the brain. The BZDs in use as antiepileptic drugs are diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam, nitrazepam, and lately, also lorazepam and midazolam as emergency therapy. The BZDs have a wide-spectrum of proven clinical efficacy in the prevention of different kind of seizures. Clonazepam and clobazam, as well as nitrazepam in some cases, can be useful as an adjunct treatment in refractory epilepsies. However, the clinical use of BZDs for the prophylactic treatment of epilepsy is associated with two major problems which have limited the long-term use of these drugs: the potential for side-effects, especially sedative effects, and the high risk of development of tolerance. Despite the limitations of BZDs in the prophylactic treatment of epilepsies, these drugs play a prominent role in clinical practice in the emergency management of acute seizures and status epilepticus. Diazepam, clonazepam and lorazepam are all considered first-line agents in the emergency management of acute seizures and status epilepticus. Furthermore, the value of midazolam as an emergency therapy in epilepsy has been increasingly recognized in recent years.",

From a clinical point of view, the NMS may range a large spectrum of presentations. Haloperidol is the most frequent drug associated with this syndrome. We report the case of a 30 year-old man who developed NMS at two different occasions, the first related to haloperidol and chlorpromazine and the second related to olanzapine, to our knowledge without previous mention in the indexed literature.",

The late image/ early image count ratios (L/E ratios) of asymptomatic patients were relatively constant (mean, 0.571; range, 0.550-0.581) in all regions of interest. In contrast, the L/E ratios of symptomatic patients were not uniform.",

    "82": "Clinical use of benzodiazepines (BZDs) may improve treatment outcome in anxious problem drinkers. Decreased activation of alcohol-related memories by negative affective cues may partly explain the beneficial effects of BZDs. To explore this possibility, the present study assessed semantic priming of alcohol words by negative affective words in anxious problem drinkers who received their standard dose of BZD and in unmedicated controls. Two groups of nine subjects each were matched on levels of anxiety, alcohol use, and alcohol dependence before performing a lexical decision task. Medicated subjects displayed significantly less activation than did unmedicated subjects on trials containing negative affective primes and alcohol-related targets, but displayed equivalent activation on control trials with neutral, categorized words. Degree of activation also correlated with a drug's affinity for the BZD receptor. These preliminary results suggest that BZD-induced amnesia may contribute to the therapeutic effects of these drugs in anxious problem drinkers.", 
    "83": "Aberrant cell proliferation and increased invasive and metastatic behavior are hallmarks of the advancement of breast cancer. Numerous studies implicate a role for cholesterol in the mechanisms underlying cell proliferation and cancer progression. The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an Mr 18,000 protein primarily localized to the mitochondria. PBR mediates cholesterol transport across the mitochondrial membranes in steroidogenic cells. A role for PBR in the regulation of tumor cell proliferation has also been shown. In this study, we examined the expression, characteristics, localization, and function of PBR in a battery of human breast cancer cell lines differing in their invasive and chemotactic potential as well as in several human tissue biopsies. Expression of PBR ligand binding and mRNA was dramatically increased in the highly aggressive cell lines, such as MDA-231, relative to nonaggressive cell lines, such as MCF-7. PBR was also found to be expressed at high levels in aggressive metastatic human breast tumor biopsies compared with normal breast tissues. Subcellular localization with both antibodies and a fluorescent PBR drug ligand revealed that PBR from the MDA-231 cell line as well as from aggressive metastatic human breast tumor biopsies localized primarily in and around the nucleus. This localization is in direct contrast to the largely cytoplasmic localization seen in MCF-7 cells, normal breast tissue, and to the typical mitochondrial localization seen in mouse tumor Leydig cells. Pharmacological characterization of the receptor and partial nucleotide sequencing of PBR cDNA revealed that the MDA-231 PBR is similar, although not identical, to previously described PBR. Addition of high affinity PBR drug ligands to MDA-231 cells increased the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into the cells in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a role for PBR in the regulation of MDA-231 cell proliferation. Cholesterol uptake into isolated MDA-231 nuclei was found to be 30% greater than into MCF-7 nuclei. High-affinity PBR drug ligands regulated the levels of cholesterol present in MDA-231 nuclei but not in MCF-7. In addition, the PBR-dependent MDA-231 cell proliferation was found to highly correlate (r = -0.99) with the PBR-mediated changes in nuclear membrane cholesterol levels. In conclusion, these data suggest that PBR expression, nuclear localization, and PBR-mediated cholesterol transport into the nucleus are involved in human breast cancer cell proliferation and aggressive phenotype expression, thus participating in the advancement of the disease.", 
    "84": "In the mammalian brain, the endogenous ligands for benzodiazepine receptors (also called endozepines) are predominantly synthesized by glial cells. It has recently been reported that rat astrocytes in primary culture release substantial amounts of endozepines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible involvement of GABA in the control of endozepine release. Exposure of cultured rat astrocytes to GABA (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) induced a dose-related inhibition of endozepine secretion. At higher doses (3 x 10(-5) to 10(-3) M), the effect of GABA gradually diminished. The inhibitory effect of GABA (10(-5) M) was mimicked by the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen (10(-5) M). In contrast, the GABA(A) receptor agonists 3APS and isoguvacine (10(-5) M each) did not modify endozepine release. The inhibition of endozepine secretion evoked by GABA and baclofen (10(-5) M each) was totally abrogated by the specific GABA(B) receptor antagonist phaclofen (10(-4) M). GABA and baclofen caused a significant inhibition of forskolin-evoked production of cAMP in astrocytes and this effect was abolished in the presence of phaclofen. In contrast, isoguvacine had no effect on cAMP production. Exposure of astrocytes to dbcAMP induced a time- and dose-dependent stimulation of endozepine release. These data indicate that GABA, acting through GABA(B) receptors negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase, inhibits endozepine release from cultured rat astrocytes. The secretion of endozepines thus appears to be a valuable marker to monitor astrocyte activity.", 
    "85": "The present research evaluated patients from 2 previous studies (1 conducted in Peoria, the other at Dartmouth) during a 2- to 5-year posttreatment period. Results showed that 75% of the Peoria sample and 76% of the Dartmouth sample were able to discontinue alprazolam therapy, remain abstinent of any type of treatment for panic disorder, and maintain their acute-treatment clinical gains over this follow-up period. The degree to which patients' anxiety sensitivity declined during treatment predicted relapse versus survival during the 1st 6 months of follow-up, when most relapses occurred. Implications of these findings for benzodiazepine discontinuation, combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, and relapse prevention in panic disorder are discussed.",

    "91": "Expressions of the cholecystokinin (CCK)-A and -B receptor genes in human duodenum, pancreas and gallbladder were examined by Northern blot analysis and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed by Southern blot hybridization. The autoradiographic study of CCK-A and -B receptors in the human duodenum and pancreas was examined in vitro. To determine the subtypes to CCK receptors in the pancreas or duodenum, we studied the abilities of CCK-A and -B receptor agonists (CCK-8 and gastrin) and antagonists (loxiglumide, L-364,718 and L-365,260) to inhibit binding of 125I-CCK-8. CCK-A receptor mRNA was not expressed in the human pancreas, but was expressed in the gallbladder and duodenum, although it was expressed in the pancreas by RT-PCR. CCK-B receptor mRNA was expressed in the pancreas, but not in gallbladder and duodenum. Using autoradiography, high concentrations of CCK-A receptors were detected in the duodenal mucosa, although in the pancreas only CCK-B receptors were detected by this method. These results suggest that localization of CCK-A receptor in human duodenum provides a biochemical and morphological basis for some physiological functions of CCK.", 
    "92": "This presentation reviews the role of cholecystokinin (CCK) as a contributory factor for the development and progression of acute pancreatitis (AP) and the perspective of CCK receptor antagonists for treatment of AP. High, supraphysiological concentrations of CCK induce AP in various species including man. There is also evidence that physiological increases in plasma CCK deteriorates AP in several animal models. The latter findings support the hypothesis that CCK plays a contributory or permissive role for the development of AP. The majorities of experimental studies show that the prophylactic and therapeutic use of CCK antagonists ameliorates AP. The latter effects were clearly shown for models of biliary AP in which plasma CCK is increased due to a feedback mechanism. However, CCK antagonists also had beneficial effects in models in which plasma CCK is not increased. In animal strains which do not have a CCK-A-receptor due to a genetic abnormality AP induced by a certain noxious factor does not develop to the same severity when compared to animals with a normal CCK-A-receptor. Thus, CCK acts as a permissive or contributory factor for the development and progression of AP. There is also evidence that CCK antagonists have a potential therapeutic benefit. Clinical studies will evaluate their therapeutic potential for patients with AP.", 
    "93": "S-16924 is a potential antipsychotic that displays agonist and antagonist properties at serotonin (5-HT)1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptors, respectively. In a pigeon conflict procedure, the benzodiazepine clorazepate (CLZ) increased punished responses, an action mimicked by S-16924, whereas the atypical antipsychotic clozapine and the neuroleptic haloperidol were inactive. Similarly, in a Vogel conflict paradigm in rats, CLZ increased punished responses, an action shared by S-16924 but not by clozapine or haloperidol. This action of S-16924 was abolished by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100,635. Ultrasonic vocalizations in rats were inhibited by CLZ, S-16924, clozapine, and haloperidol. However, although WAY-100,635 abolished the action of S-16924, it did not affect clozapine and haloperidol. In a rat elevated plus-maze, CLZ, but not S-16924, clozapine, and haloperidol, increased open-arm entries. Like CLZ, S-16924 increased social interaction in rats, whereas clozapine and haloperidol were inactive. WAY-100,635 abolished this action of S-16924. CLZ, S-16924, clozapine, and haloperidol decreased aggressive interactions in isolated mice, but this effect of S-16924 was not blocked by WAY-100, 635. All drugs inhibited motor behavior, but the separation to anxiolytic doses was more pronounced for S-16924 than for CLZ. Finally, in freely moving rats, CLZ and S-16924, but not clozapine and haloperidol, decreased dialysis levels of 5-HT in the nucleus accumbens: this action of S-16924 was blocked by WAY-100,165. In conclusion, in contrast to haloperidol and clozapine, S-16924 possessed a broad-based profile of anxiolytic activity at doses lower than those provoking motor disruption. Its principal mechanism of action was activation of 5-HT1A (auto)receptors.", 
    "94": "The ability of the M2 muscarinic receptor to mediate an inhibition of the relaxant effects of forskolin and isoproterenol was investigated in guinea pig ileum and trachea. In some experiments, trachea was first treated with 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) mustard to inactivate M3 receptors. The contractile response to oxotremorine-M was measured subsequently in the presence of both histamine (10 microM) and isoproterenol (10 nM). Under these conditions, [[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3b]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) antagonized the contractile response to oxotremorine-M in a manner consistent with an M3 mechanism. However, when the same experiment was repeated using forskolin (4 microM) instead of isoproterenol, the response to oxotremorine-M exhibited greater potency and was antagonized by AF-DX 116 in a manner consistent with an M2 mechanism. We also measured the effects of pertussis toxin treatment on the ability of isoproterenol to inhibit the contraction elicited by a single concentration of either histamine (0.3 microM) or oxotremorine-M (40 nM) in both the ileum and trachea. Pertussis toxin treatment had no significant effect on the potency of isoproterenol for inhibiting histamine-induced contractions in the ileum and trachea. In contrast, pertussis toxin treatment enhanced the relaxant potency of isoproterenol against oxotremorine-M-induced contractions in the ileum but not in the trachea. Also, pertussis toxin treatment enhanced the relaxant potency of forskolin against oxotremorine-M-induced contractions in the ileum and trachea. We investigated the relaxant potency of isoproterenol when very low, equi-effective (i.e., 20-34% of maximal response) concentrations of either histamine or oxotremorine-M were used to elicit contraction. Under these conditions, isoproterenol exhibited greater relaxant potency against histamine in the ileum but exhibited similar relaxant potencies against histamine and oxotremorine-M in the trachea. Following 4-DAMP mustard treatment, a low concentration of oxotremorine-M (10 nM) had no contractile effect in either the ileum or trachea. Nevertheless, in 4-DAMP mustard-treated tissue, oxotremorine-M (10 nM) reduced the relaxant potency of isoproterenol against histamine-induced contractions in the ileum, but not in the trachea. We conclude that in the trachea the M2 receptor mediates an inhibition of the relaxant effects of forskolin, but not isoproterenol, and the decreased relaxant potency of isoproterenol against contractions elicited by a muscarinic agonist relative to histamine is not due to activation of M2 receptors but rather to the greater contractile stimulus mediated by the M3 receptor compared with the H1 histamine receptor.", 
    "95": "The permeability surface area (PS) product, an index of permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), was measured by using the in situ perfusion method. In the cerebral circulation, the fraction of drug that permeates into the brain through the BBB is not only the unbound fraction but also the fraction dissociated from the protein in the perfusate. The sum of these two fractions, the apparent exchangeable fraction, was estimated by fitting the parameters of the BBB permeability under the condition of varying BSA concentrations in the perfusate. The unbound fraction of drugs in a buffer containing 0.5 mM BSA was measured by using the ultrafiltration method in vitro, and the apparent exchangeable fraction was measured in vivo by using the intracarotid artery injection method. The apparent exchange fraction was 100% for S-8510, 96.5% for diazepam, 90.9% for caffeine, 38.3% for S-312-d, 33.1% for propranolol, and 6.68% for (+)-S-145 Na, and each of these was higher than the corresponding unbound fraction in vitro in all drugs. The apparent exchangeable fractions, for example, were 8 times higher for diazepam and 38 times for S-312-d than the unbound fractions in vitro. The apparent exchangeable fraction of drugs was also estimated from the parameters obtained with the perfusion method. Because drugs can be infused for an arbitrary length of time in the perfusion method, substances with low permeability can be measured. The apparent exchangeable fractions obtained with this method were almost the same as those obtained with the intracarotid artery injection method.",

    "97": "Twelve healthy volunteers, six males and six females, aged 22-36 years, participated as subjects. Drugs and placebo were administered according to a single-dose, double-blind, balanced, four-way, crossover design. Treatments were separated by a wash-out period of 1 week and consisted of placebo, lorazepam 0.03 mg x kg(-1), GHB 12.5 mg x kg(-1) and GHB 25 mg x kg(-1). Subjects' psychomotor performance was assessed at baseline and at 15, 60, 120 and 180 min after treatment. Mood was assessed using 16 visual analogue scales, before treatment and 120 min later. Psychomotor performance was measured using the following tests: Critical Flicker Fusion. Response Competition Test, Critical Tracking Task, Choice Reaction Time and Visual Vigilance Task.", 
    "98": "GHB at both doses had no effects on attention, vigilance, alertness, short-term memory or psychomotor co-ordination (delta-placebo, P > 0.05); calmness increased with the lower dose and contentedness decreased significantly at both doses (delta-baseline, P < 0.05); adverse effects were limited to slight subjective feelings of dizziness and dullness, which disappeared 30-60 min after administration of the dose. Lorazepam caused impairment of psychometric functions.", 
    "99": "After single therapeutic doses, GHB does not induce changes in psychomotor performance and therefore the drug does not influence the ability to drive or work. However, repeated reports of the abuse potential of GHB and its usefulness in treating ethyl alcohol addiction indicate that it may play an \"agonist-like\" role, which means that it should only used under close medical supervision.", 
    "100": "The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine was compared to other atypical as well as typical antipsychotic agents for in vivo occupancy of D1, D2, D3, 5HT2, and muscarinic receptors in rat brain. Blockade of D2 receptors was determined by measuring the levels of the dopamine metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC). To assess the interaction with phosphoinositide (PI)-coupled 5HT2A and muscarinic receptors in vivo, we used a novel radiometric technique to measure in vivo PI hydrolysis. The antagonism of olanzapine and other antipsychotic agents on 5HT2A and muscarinic receptors was determined by in vivo blockade of PI hydrolysis, stimulated by the 5HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) or the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine. Olanzapine inhibited 5HT2, D2, and D3 in vivo binding with high potency (ID50=0.15, 0.6 and 1.2 mg/kg, IP, respectively), while inhibiting D1 and muscarinic in vivo binding with much less potency (ID50 > 10 mg/kg, IP). The binding of olanzapine to D2 receptors in neostriatum was well correlated with the increase of DOPAC (ED200 = 0.8 mg/kg, IP) in vivo, indicating dopamine D2 antagonism. In vivo PI hydrolysis was increased by DOI in frontal cortex and by pilocarpine in hippocampus up to 2- and 7-fold above the basal level, respectively. The agonist-induced increases in PI hydrolysis were fully blocked by the 5HT2A antagonist MDL100907 and the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine, indicating the mediation by 5HT2A receptors in frontal cortex and PI-coupled muscarinic receptors (ml, m3, and m5) in hippocampus, respectively. Olanzapine was about 8-fold more potent in vivo in blocking DOI-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis (ID50 = 0.1 mg/kg, IP) than pilocarpine-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis (ID50 = 0.8 mg/kg, IP). In conclusion, olanzapine is more potent in blocking the 5HT2A receptor than D1, D2, D3 and muscarinic receptors in vivo, consistent with its favorable clinical profiles. In addition, the novel in vivo PI hydrolysis assay proved to be a useful and reliable in vivo method to assess the functional efficacy of compounds that interact with the 5HT2 and muscarinic receptors.",

    "102": "Neuronal injury was induced by a 4-min occlusion of the common carotid arteries followed by reperfusion. One week after occlusion, animals were transcardially perfused for histochemistry. Neuronal death in four brain regions was evaluated by direct visual counting of acidophilic neurons.", 
    "103": "Seven days after this ischemic episode, severe neuronal injury was measured in the hippocampal CA1 area (> 98% of total cells damaged) and parietal cortex (> 35%). Also lateral thalamus and caudate putamen were damaged but to a lesser extent (about 10%). The neuronal injury in these areas was significantly attenuated by propofol, midazolam and the GABAA agonist, muscimol, intraperitoneally administered 15 min prior to ischemia. This neuroprotective property, however, was lacking with pentobarbital and GABAB agonist baclofen. Concomitant pretreatment with subthreshold doses of propofol and muscimol significantly reduced the amount of cell death induced by brain ischemia. On the other hand, pretreatment with the GABAA antagonist bicuculline significantly inhibited the neuroprotective effects of propofol. However, a GABAB antagonist, phaclofen, was without effect on neuronal damage and on neuronal protection of propofol.",

The data for dose-related cell survival with [125I]PK 11195 showed a linear relationship. Na[125I] or non-labeled PK 11195 at similar concentrations did not lead to any cell killing. The uptake of [125I]PK 11195 and [3H]PK 11195 in cells was very similar. Fragmentation of DNA measured by agarose gel electrophoresis showed that exposure of DU 145 cells to [1251]PK 11195 for 1, 4 or 24 h caused no fragmentation. These results indicate that nuclear DNA is not the prime binding site for [125I]PK 11195, which is consistent with the presence of specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBZr) in the mitochondria. The cell killing effect of [125I]PK 11195 suggests the use of PBZr ligand for radiotherapy.",

Over the period 1981-91, barbiturate prescribing and self poisoning both fell by 80%; for antidepressants, prescribing increased by over 40% and self poisoning by 30%; for antipsychotics, both rose by 30%; for benzodiazepines, poisoning fell by 30% and prescribing by 20%. Even for analgesic drugs, which are also available over the counter, there was a correspondence between changes in self poisoning and prescribing. The availability of prescribed drugs is directly related to their use for self poisoning. Restricting the availability of these drugs is a possible preventative strategy, although further research on this is needed.",

    "109": "Patient and control subjects responded to flumazenil uniformly; there was no evidence for an anxiogenic activity of flumazenil in control subjects or panic disorder patients. ACTH and cortisol levels were also not differentially influenced by flumazenil or panic disorder diagnosis. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure in both groups were slightly but significantly reduced by flumazenil compared to saline.", 
    "110": "These findings do not support the view that panic disorder patients and control subjects respond differentially to flumazenil or that the suggested shift in the benzodiazepine receptor \"set-point,\" which leads to an inverse agonistic activity of flumazenil, characterizes panic disorder.",

The mean GETs and SITTs, and the mean residence times (MRTs) and geometric centers (GCs) of markers in the colon were determined. The effect of intravenous diazepam injection and marker size on these parameters was examined. Diazepam injection had no significant influence on gastrointestinal transit. The GETs of the 1.5-mm markers were significantly more rapid than those of the 5.0-mm markers. There were no significant differences between the SITTs or GCs of the 1.5-mm and 5.0-mm markers. Reference values were developed for GET, SITT, and colonic transit of radiopaque markers for cats fed a high-fiber meal. Diazepam injection had no effect on these parameters.", 
    "112": "Epidural analgesia and spinal analgesia are the most effective techniques for relieving labour pain. Basically, local anaesthetics (i.e. bupivacaine) and opioids (i.e. fentanyl or sufentanil), especially when combined, produce excellent analgesia with minimal motor blockade. However, none of these agents is devoid of side-effects and analgesia remains sometimes imperfect, suggesting that new drugs would be welcome. Adrenalin and clonidine act on a2-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord and both have been found to improve analgesia. These two drugs have already been used in many patients and studies because the absence of neurotoxicity has been well documented. Clonidine looks more attractive, although sedation and hypotension limit its use. Other analgesic drugs are promising alternatives but are still at an experimental or very early clinical stage. Neostigmine and ketamine (without preservative) are not neurotoxic while midazolam neurotoxicity is still controversial. Intravenous remifentanil might prove useful when neuraxial analgesia is contraindicated.", 
    "113": "In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 90 ASA 1 and 2 patients scheduled for elective surgery we compared the effect of pre-administering midazolam 2 mg or propofol 30 mg on the dose of propofol subsequently required to induce anaesthesia. Using loss of response to verbal command and tolerance to placement of a facemask as end-points, the dose of propofol required to induce anaesthesia was significantly smaller in the patients given propofol (1.87 mg.kg-1) or midazolam (1.71 mg.kg-1) when compared to the control group (2.38 mg.kg-1). Although the decrease in blood pressure following induction was no difference between the two study groups and the decrease was felt not to be of clinical significance in this group of patients. As propofol is presented ' ... for use in a single patient only' and the technique of predosing with propofol allowed induction of all patients with less than 200 mg (a single ampoule), we question on a cost basis whether midazolam co-induction is necessary to reduce propofol induction doses.", 
    "114": "The effect of ionic strength, assay constituents, alpha-naphthoflavone (aNF), terfenadine and testosterone on human CYP3A mediated midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation (MDZ 1'-OH) and 4-hydroxylation (MDZ 4-OH) in vitro was examined. Increasing concentration of Tris-HCl (Tris) and sodium phosphate (PO4) buffers differentially affected MDZ 1'-OH and MDZ 4-OH formation rates and had a different effect on MDZ metabolism mediated by microsomes containing CYP3A4 versus CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. MDZ metabolism was not affected by PO4 buffer concentration when cumene hydroperoxide (CUOOH) was used as the source of reactive oxygen. Interestingly, the ammonium ion present in the solution of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was found to inhibit MDZ metabolism. The addition of MgCl2 up to 50 mM and CaCl2 (5-30 mM) had no affect or inhibited MDZ metabolism, respectively. Formation of MDZ 1'-OH by microsomes from adult and fetal liver and expressed CYP3A4 was regioselectively stimulated by aNF (10 microM). In human hepatocytes, aNF stimulated MDZ 1'-OH formation (up to 100%). Terfenadine (20 microM) regioselectively stimulated MDZ 1'-OH formation in Tris (1-200 mM) and PO4 (1-10 mM) buffers by up to 159%. Surprisingly, with expressed CYP3A4, terfenadine (20 microM) inhibited MDZ 1'-OH formation. Terfenadine (20 microM) had little effect on MDZ 1'-OH formation by fetal liver microsomes. Testosterone (10 and 100 microM) regioselectively stimulated (up to 269%) MDZ 4-OH formation by adult liver microsomes and expressed CYP3A4. Testosterone (100 microM) inhibited (> 40%) MDZ 1'-OH and MDZ 4-OH formation by fetal liver microsomes. With adult liver microsomes, aNF and terfenadine had little effect on the Km for MDZ 1'-OH formation. However, the Km for MDZ 4-OH formation was decreased (up to 94%) by 100 microM testosterone. In the presence of CUOOH, no stimulation of MDZ metabolism was observed by aNF, terfenadine or testosterone in adult liver microsomes. These studies indicate that because assay conditions can substantially alter the catalytic activity of CYP3A, caution should be exerted when extrapolating results between in vitro and in vivo, and when results from different laboratories are compared. Further, these results suggest that the stimulation of CYP3A4 may also occur in vivo and, consequently, may have clinical importance.", 
    "115": "Benzodiazepines are common drugs that cause intoxication. Benzodiazepines and their metabolites can be converted by hydrolysis in acid to the corresponding benzophenones, which are easier to be separated from matrices because of their hydrophobic properties. In this study, a new separation technique called solid-phase microextraction (SPME), which can integrate extraction, concentration, sampling and sample introduction into one single procedure, has been employed to extract the products of benzodiazepines from urine after acid hydrolysis. The extracts were determined by gas chromatography with electron-capture detection (GC-ECD). The hydrolysis conditions were optimized by a statistic orthogonal design. Factors influencing direct-immersion (DI)-SPME process were also checked and chosen experimentally. The method was evaluated with spiked human urine samples. The recoveries of nine benzodiazepines ranged from 1 to 25%, with the highest for oxazolam and the lowest for bromazepam. The calibration curves were linear from 10 to 500 ng/mL for oxazolam, haloxazolam, flunitrazepam, nimetazepam, and clonazepam and from 20 to 1000 ng/mL for the others except bromazepam. The detection limits were 2-20 ng/mL for most drugs tested. The intraday and interday coefficients of variation of the developed method were within 10 and 17%, respectively. In addition, the utility of the method was confirmed by determining two ingested benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam and oxazolam) in a volunteer's urine; urine flunitrazepam was still detectable 32 h after a therapeutic dose (1.2 mg) of the drug. Finally, the DI-SPME was compared with the conventional liquid-liquid extraction with regard to detection limits and extraction efficiency of the analytes. By DI-SPME, more amounts of analytes could be introduced into GC column than by conventional liquid-liquid extraction, and thus lower detection limits of the analytes were reached, although benzophenone recoveries by DI-SPME were rather low.", 
    "116": "A method for the extraction of diazepam and its metabolites (nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam) from equine urine and serum and their quantitation and confirmation by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry is presented. Valium, a formulation of diazepam, was administered at a dose of 10 mg intramuscularly to four standard-bred mares. Diazepam is extensively metabolized in the horse to nordiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam. Diazepam urinary concentrations were found to be less than 6 ng/mL. Nordiazepam was found to be mainly in its glucuronide-conjugated form and was measured out to a collection time of 53-55 h. Oxazepam and temazepam were entirely conjugated, and their urinary concentrations were measured out to collection times of 121 h and 77-79 h, respectively. Diazepam and nordiazepam were measured in equine postadministration serum out to collection times of 6 and 54 h, respectively. Oxazepam and temazepam were not detected in postadministration serum.", 
    "117": "We have recently reported a new protocol for inducing long-term depression through activation of GABAA receptors in the hippocampal slices. This long-term depression is reversed by bicuculline and potentiated by neurosteroids such as alphaxalone. It was also shown that glutamate receptor activity or extracellular calcium are not involved in the induction of this type of long-term depression. The present study investigated the possible relation between muscimol-induced long-term depression and barbiturates/benzodiazepine-induced amnesia and attempts to determine the possible effect of pregnenolone sulfate on muscimol-induced long-term depression. Extracellular recordings were made in the CA1 pyramidal cell layer of rat hippocampal slices following orthodromic stimulation of Schaffer collateral fibres in stratum radiatum (0.01 Hz). It was observed that pentobarbital, benzodiazepines and pregnanolone at concentrations that did not have any effect themselves on the population spike, potentiate the ability of muscimol to induce long-term depression. In addition to this, the long-term depression was either blocked or reversed by pregnenolone sulfate at concentrations (10 microM) where pregnenolone sulfate did not induce any multiple burst or increase of spike size. The results suggest that the potentiation of this type of long-term depression by benzodiazepines and barbiturates can explain the main adverse effect of these drugs, amnesia and cognitive impairment. Moreover, the prevention or reversal of this type of long-term depression by pregnenolone sulfate, may suggest a clinical application of this agent in the management of amnesia or dementia.", 
    "118": "The larger isoform of the enzyme glutamate decarboxylase, GAD67, synthesizes >90% of basal levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in the brain. In contrast, the smaller isoform, GAD65, has been implicated in the fine-tuning of inhibitory neurotransmission. Mice deficient in GAD65 exhibit increased anxiety-like responses in both the open field and elevated zero maze assays. Additionally, GAD65-deficient mice have a diminished response to the anxiolytics diazepam and pentobarbital, both of which interact with GABA-A receptors in a GABA-dependent fashion to facilitate GABAergic neurotransmission. Loss of GAD65-generated GABA does not appear to result in compensatory postsynaptic GABA-A receptor changes based on radioligand receptor binding studies, which revealed no change in the postsynaptic GABA-A receptor density. Furthermore, mutant and wild-type animals do not differ in their behavioral response to muscimol, which acts independently of the presence of GABA. We propose that stress-induced GABA release is impaired in GAD65-deficient mice, resulting in increased anxiety-like responses and a diminished response to the acute effects of drugs that facilitate the actions of released GABA.",

The results also suggest that some previous clinical comparisons of antipsychotics may have been confounded by different levels of D2 occupancy. Clinical comparisons of these drugs, matching for D2 occupancy, may provide a better measure of their true \"atypicality\" and will help in understanding the contribution of non-D2 receptors to antipsychotic effects.", 
    "131": "This paper reviews the sleep effects of systemically administered agonistic modulators of GABAA receptors, including barbiturates, benzodiazepines, zolpidem, zopiclone and neuroactive steroids, and the selective GABAA agonists muscimol and THIP. To assess the involvement of GABAA receptors in the physiologic regulation of sleep, the article emphasizes the hypnotic properties shared by agonistic modulators and by the selective agonists of the GABAA receptor complex. In both rats and normal sleeping individuals, agonistic modulators are able to reduce sleep latency, increase sleep continuity, and promote non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep as well as the occurrence of spindles. Furthermore, nearly all of these compounds have been shown to attenuate slow-wave activity (SWA) and to suppress the occurrence of REM sleep. In the same species, GABAA agonist(s) do not seem to affect sleep latency or REM sleep time, but may increase sleep continuity and NREM sleep and augment SWA while depressing spindle activity in humans. The distinct sleep effects of GABAA agonists may be due to their unspecific stimulation of GABAA receptors throughout the brain, and to the fact that they are poor substrates for uptake and probably exert more tonic effects than liberated GABA. If so, the involvement of GABAA receptors in the various aspects of sleep can be inferred more accurately from the hypnotic effects of agonistic modulators. This implies that an activation of GABAA receptors plays a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of NREM sleep and in the generation of sleep spindles, but disrupts the processes underlying slow EEG components and the triggering of REM sleep.", 
    "132": "The objective of this meta-analysis is to summarize the efficacy and tolerability of the new antipsychotics risperidone, olanzapine, sertindole and quetiapine in schizophrenia compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotics. The main results are: (1) All of the 4 new drugs are more effective than placebo, but the magnitude of the effect is only moderate [mean effect size, r, of all antipsychotics vs. placebo = 0.25, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.22-0.28, n = 2477]. (2) According to the studies published to date, sertindole and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol, and risperidone and olanzapine are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global schizophrenic symptomatology. (3) With respect to negative symptoms, all new antipsychotics are more effective than placebo. However, contrary to widespread opinion, so is the 'conventional' antipsychotic haloperidol. Risperidone and olanzapine are slightly superior, sertindole is as effective and--according to the only study fully published to date--quetiapine is even slightly less effective than haloperidol in this regard. (4) All new antipsychotics are associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol, with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable EPS-profile than the other new antipsychotics. The methodological limitations of this review, the generalizability of the results and expectations from future research are discussed.",

We have studied an alpha 6 -/- mouse line for motor performance and drug sensitivity. These mice, as a result of a specific genetic lesion, carry a precise impairment at their Golgi-granule cell synapses. On motor performance tests (rotarod, horizontal wire, pole descending, staircase and swimming tests) there were no robust baseline differences in motor function or motor learning between alpha 6 -/- and alpha 6 +/+ mice. On the rotarod test, however, the mutant mice were significantly more impaired by diazepam (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.), when compared with alpha 6 +/+ control and background C57BL/6J and 129/SvJ mouse lines. Ethanol (2.0-2.5 g/kg, i.p.) produced similar impairment in the alpha 6 -/- and alpha +/+ mice. Diazepam-induced ataxia in alpha 6 -/- mice could be reversed by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil, indicating the involvement of the remaining alpha 1 beta 2/3 gamma 2 GABAA receptors of the granule cells. The level of activity in this synapse is crucial in regulating the execution of motor tasks. We conclude that GABAA receptor alpha 6 subunit-dependent actions in the cerebellar cortex can be compensated by other receptor subtypes; but if not for the alpha 6 subunit, patients on benzodiazepine medication would suffer considerably from ataxic side-effects."
