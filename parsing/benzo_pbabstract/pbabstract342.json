    "0": "The purpose of this study was to determine whether short-term tolerance develops to GABA-agonist-induced changes in saccadic eye movements (SEMs), and whether the time course for GABA-agonist induced onset and offset of impairment is similar for SEMs and for psychomotor function. An additional goal was to determine whether there are differences in sensitivity between SEMs and psychomotor function. Six healthy volunteers participated in this balanced double-blind, three-way crossover, single-dose study of placebo and two different dosage forms of the GABA-agonist alprazolam: a rapidly absorbed oral 1.5-mg compressed tablet (CT) and a 3.0-mg sustained release (SR) tablet. Treatments were separated by a 7-day washout period. Peak concentrations did not differ between CT and SR treatments, although area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of alprazolam was greater after administration of SR than after CT, because plateau concentrations were attained after SR. Both SEM and psychomotor tests showed time-dependent responses consistent with the development of tolerance. SEMs discriminated the differences in rate of drug input of the CT and SR formulations, with impairment evident at low concentrations during absorption. SEM impairment also persisted longer than did psychomotor impairment. Peak saccade velocity is a more sensitive indicator of pharmacologic effects mediated by the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex than are psychomotor responses. This is probably the result of the very high GABA dependency of SEMs, along with their limited sensitivity to motivation.", 
    "1": "Ten ferrets were used in a crossover study to determine the sedative effects of intramuscularly (IM) administered diazepam (3 mg/kg body weight)-butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg body weight), acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg body weight)-butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg body weight), or xylazine (2.0 mg/kg body weight)-butorphanol (0.2 mg/kg body weight). All ferrets became laterally recumbent following the administration of each drug combination. The xylazine-butorphanol combination caused a significantly longer (p less than 0.05) duration of analgesia than the diazepam-butorphanol and acepromazine-butorphanol combinations. None of the ferrets could be intubated with any of the drug combinations. The time from induction to recovery was significantly shorter in the acepromazine-butorphanol-treated ferrets. A significantly lower heart rate was observed in the xylazine-butorphanol-treated ferrets; however, an acceptable systolic blood pressure was maintained. Ventilatory function was more depressed in the diazepam-butorphanol- and xylazine-butorphanol-treated ferrets than in the acepromazine-butorphanol-treated ferrets. Xylazine-butorphanol was found to be the best combination for use in ferrets.",

Time from injection to assuming lateral recumbency was not significantly different between the three drugs. Duration of recumbency expressed as mean+/-standard deviation was significantly longer with xylazine (68.3+/-20.8 min) than with diazepam (43.2+/-8.2 min) or acepromazine (49.8+/-11.2 min). Sedation was graded to be the best in the xylazine-treated ferrets and worst in the diazepam-treated ferrets. Analgesia was judged only to be present following xylazine injection. Systolic blood pressure, oxyhemoglobin saturation, and end-expired carbon dioxide (CO2) were similar with all three drugs. It was concluded that, at the doses administered, xylazine provided better chemical restraint in the healthy ferret than either acepromazine or diazepam.",

To sedate patients in the ICU, midazolam is commonly administered via titrated, continuous infusions. Cardiorespiratory effects tend to be minimal; however, hypotension can occur in hypovolemic patients. Prolonged sedation after cessation of the midazolam infusion may be caused by altered kinetics of the drug in critically ill patients or by accumulation of active metabolites. In addition, paradoxical and psychotic reactions have been rarely reported. Tolerance and tachyphylaxis may occur, particularly with longer-term infusions (> or = 3 days). Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has also been associated with high dose/long-term midazolam infusions. Compared with propofol infusions, midazolam infusions have been associated with a decreased occurrence of hypotension but a more variable time course for recovery of function after the cessation of the infusion.

    "15": "The objective of this study was to determine whether measurements of human CRH in the inferior petrosal sinuses could distinguish patients with Cushing's syndrome from those with pseudo-Cushing states or normal physiology. Twenty-five patients with Cushing's disease, 17 patients with the syndrome of ectopic ACTH, 7 patients with Cushing's syndrome of adrenal origin, 6 patients with pseudo-Cushing states, and 11 volunteers believed to have normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axes were studied. Basal plasma human CRH and ACTH were measured at two time points in the petrosal sinuses and in a peripheral vein. Most subjects were studied after the administration of intravenous diazepam or midazolam and fentanyl, but because of the known inhibitory effects of such sedation on CRH secretion, 2 normal volunteers and 3 patients with pseudo-Cushing states were studied without sedation. Human CRH levels were near or below the detection limit of the assay in all subjects. Although the normal volunteers and patients with pseudo-Cushing states who were studied without sedation had significantly greater inferior petrosal sinus ACTH levels than those who received sedation, there were no differences in measured human CRH levels for any of the groups. We conclude that inferior petrosal sinus human CRH levels are not easily measured in the inferior petrosal sinuses and cannot be used to determine whether individual patients may have hypersecretion of CRH causing their ACTH secretion.",

The effects of the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonist midazolam (0.3-3 mg/kg), and the partial inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 (0.3-3 mg/kg), on licking for several concentrations of sucrose, Intralipid, and maltodextrin in a brief contact test were investigated. Midazolam increased the total number of licks for all 3 fluids; conversely, Ro 15-4513 decreased the total number of licks. Midazolam increased mean bout duration for sucrose and maltodextrin drinking and there was a trend toward a similar effect with Intralipid drinking.

In the social interaction test, the anxiogenic effect of pirenzepine (30-100 ng) provided evidence for a tonic cholinergic anxiolytic action mediated by postsynaptic M1 receptors. The anxiogenic action of mecamylamine (30 and 100 ng) was most likely mediated by its action of presynaptic nicotinic receptors to reduce acetylcholine release. Gallamine (10-1,000 ng) was without effect, suggesting that M2 receptors in this brain region do not play a significant role in this behavioral test. On Trial 1 in the elevated plus-maze, the receptor antagonists were without any effect, but in those with a previous 5-min experience of the plus-maze pirenzepine and mecamylamine had anxiogenic effects in the dose range of 30-300 ng; gallamine (100 and 300 ng) was without significant effect.",

In addition, the profiles of the ANS-induced fluorescence were different and could be classified into two patterns, suggesting that hydrophobic pockets in the albumin molecules were different for the different species.

The pharmacology behind this cyclothiazide-enhanced kainate-induced excitotoxicity was characterized in embryonic rat hippocampal cell cultures. Treatment of cell cultures with a combination of cyclothiazide and kainate for 24 h resulted in excessive neuronal death as measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase into the culture media. Cyclothiazide produced a leftward shift of the kainate dose-response curve and enhanced the maximum response of kainate excitotoxicity. AMPA-preferring receptor antagonists, 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoyl-benzo(F)quinoxaline(NBQX) and 1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466) blocked cyclothiazide-enhanced kainate toxicity completely, and cyclothiazide increased the IC50S for NBQX and GYKI 52466 against kainate toxicity. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK801) also blocked cyclothiazide-enhanced kainate toxicity, but only partially. Cyclothiazide also increased the IC50 for MK801 against kainate toxicity. These data suggest that cyclothiazide enhances both AMPA-preferring receptor- and NMDA receptor-mediated toxicity in kainate-induced toxicity in embryonic rat hippocampal cultures.",

There were no significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate or oxygen haemoglobin saturation values in all groups, and there were no significant differences in the incidence of vomiting and pruritus between the groups (P > 0.05). Sedation scores were higher in the bupivacaine-midazolam and the bupivacaine-morphine groups than in the bupivacaine group at 8-12 h post-operatively (P < 0.01). The durations of analgesia were 21.15 +/- 1.2 h in the bupivacaine-midazolam group, 14.50 +/- 1.6 h in the bupivacaine-morphine group and 8.15 +/- 1.3 h in the bupivacaine group.

    "30": "Despite recent advances in neurobiology and significant insight into the molecular dysfunction of epilepsy, about 25% of patients do not completely respond to current frontline therapeutic agents such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, valproic acid, ethosuximide, phenobarbital, and benzodiazepine. Recently, much effort has been made to discover new antiepileptic drugs effective in refractory seizures. Two major groups of drugs have emerged of which felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin are among the most promising. The mechanism of action of the first group works by enhancing brain GABA activity (e.g. vigabatrin) while the second group inhibits excitatory amino acids (e.g. lamotrigine and felbamate). Oxcarbazepine acts in a similar manner to carbamazepine while gabapentin's mode of action is still unclear. The major clinical indications of these new antiepileptics are partial complex seizures. They exhibit limited drug interactions with few adverse effects. A rational approach to the drug discovery process is necessary in order to lead to novel effective therapy. Another line of research is the use of the structure-activity relationship to fine-tune the pharmacology of existing antiepileptics providing less adverse effects with the same or better efficacy. Clinical perspectives from the discovery of new drugs such as fosphenytoin and valproyl glycinamide look promising. Rapid development in molecular biologic techniques for the study of the neurophysiology of epilepsy and the neurotransmitters which are the target for the antiepileptic drugs may also provide better insight into the interactions of antiepileptics with either ion channels or brain receptors.", 
    "31": "The metabolic conversion of diazepam (DZ) to temazepam (TMZ, a C3-hydroxylation product of DZ) and N-desmethyldiazepam (NDZ, an N1-demethylation product of DZ) was studied using cDNA-expressed human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C9R144C, 2E1, 3A4, and 3A5 and human liver microsomes from five organ donors. Of the CYPs examined, 3A5, 3A4, and 2B6 exhibited the highest enzymatic activities with turnovers ranging from 7.5 to 12.5 nmol of product formed/min/nmol for the total metabolism of DZ, while 2C8, 2C9, and 2C9R144C showed lesser and moderate activities. 1A2 and 2E1 produced insignificant amounts of metabolites of DZ. The regioselectivity of CYPs was determined, and 2B6 was found to catalyze exclusively and 2C8, 2C9, and 2C9R144C preferentially the N1-demethylation of DZ to form NDZ. 3A4 and 3A5 catalyzed primarily the C3-hydroxylation of DZ, which was more extensive than the N1-demethylation. The ratios of TMZ to NDZ formed in the metabolism of DZ by 3A4 and 3A5 were approximately 4:1. Enzyme kinetic studies indicated that 2B6- and 2C9-catalyzed DZ metabolism followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, whereas 3A4 and 3A5 displayed atypical and non-linear curves in Lineweaver-Burk plots. Human liver microsomes converted DZ to both TMZ and NDZ at a ratio of 2:1. Our results suggest that hepatic CYP3A, 2C, and 2B6 enzymes have an important role in the metabolism of DZ by human liver.", 
    "32": "The effects of various drugs were assessed in rats responding under a Differential-Reinforcement-of-Low-Rate 30-s (DRL 30-s) schedule. Atropine, scopolamine, and CEB-1957 (a new muscarinic blocker) increased response rate and decreased reinforcement rate, while methylatropine only decreased reinforcement rate. Physostigmine decreased response and reinforcement rates, when pyridostigmine had few effect on DRL responding. The irreversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors organophosphorus compounds (OPC) soman and sarin, injected at one-third of the LD50 did not consistently alter DRL performance, suggesting that they produce few behavioral effects in the rat when administered at subtoxic doses. Three oximes--pralidoxime, pyrimidoxime, and HI-6--decreased both response and reinforcement rates. Mecamylamine had few consistent effects on performance, and nicotine, d-amphetamine, diazepam, and the wakening drug modafinil increased response rate and decreased reinforcement rate. These two latter drugs also increased the number of very premature responses. These results, taken together, indicate that a DRL schedule is a useful tool to bring to light the existence of psychotropic effects of a drug. The explanation of drug-induced alterations of DRL performance, in terms of effects on cognition or on mood, is also discussed.", 
    "33": "In a previous study we reported that the affinity of the platelet benzodiazepine receptor was greater in alcoholic cirrhotic patients compared with normal controls and that there were detectable ligands for the neuronal benzodiazepine receptor in plasma from both alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhotic patients. The aim of the present study was to assess the separate contributions of alcoholism and cirrhosis to the presence of ligands in plasma for the neuronal and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors and to changes in peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding in platelets. These parameters were measured in 10 alcoholic cirrhotics, 9 nonalcoholic cirrhotics, 7 alcoholics with a normal liver function, and 15 nonalcoholic subjects and normal liver function. Both groups of alcoholics had been abstinent for several months and the nonalcoholic groups had abstained for 24 h before the study. The concentration of ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor were significantly higher in both cirrhotic groups compared with the other two groups, suggesting that cirrhosis was responsible for this accumulation. Furthermore, the cirrhotic patients with detectable concentrations of these ligands had significantly poorer episodic memory than those without ligands. However, the presence of ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor did not correlate with the change in receptor affinity, which was increased in the alcoholic cirrhotic group compared with all other groups. Neither cirrhosis nor alcoholism altered the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor number. The cirrhotic patients with detectable ligands for the neuronal benzodiazepine receptor showed psychomotor slowing and executive dysfunction. The results suggest that the ligands for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor may contribute to some of the cognitive deficits seen in hepatic encephalopathy, but are not responsible for the receptor affinity change seen in the alcoholic cirrhotics. This affinity change is not solely due to the effects of alcohol and could possibly serve as a marker for those at risk for developing alcoholic cirrhosis.", 
    "34": "The benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist sarmazenil exhibits in vivo proconvulsive, but not convulsant, effects in different paradigms in rodents. Intravenous sarmazenil challenge given at several fixed intervals following the termination of repeated treatment with a markedly sedative dose of diazepam in squirrel monkeys was effective in precipitating withdrawal signs, but had no comparable effects in vehicle-treated controls. The precipitated withdrawal reaction was not only robust, but it was consistently observed in all of the diazepam-treated monkeys. Thus, the use of sarmazenil challenge in the precipitated withdrawal paradigm provides a reliable method for assessing the development of physical dependence during repeated treatment with benzodiazepine receptor agonists.", 
    "35": "In our experiments a drug from the group of 5-HT3 antagonists--ondansetron (OND)--has been used in rats developing tolerance to oxazepam (OXZ). After 7 days of oxazepam administration (5 mg/kg i.p.) a significant decrease in the anxiolytic behavior was observed in the Crawley test. In the rats already partly tolerant to oxazepam, an undiminished anxiolytic-like effect of ondansetron (single injection of 0.1 mg/kg i.p., seventh day) was observed. After 14 days of oxazepam administration its anxiolytic activity was even more diminished. A single injection of ondansetron 0.1 mg/kg restored the anxiolytic behavior: rise of BWT (black-white transition) and WSE (white square entrance). After 21 days the anxiolytic activity of oxazepam was totally abolished and the single injection of ondansetron did not restore the state of anxiolysis. The results show that the anxiolytic effects of ondansetron were not influenced in the first stages of tolerance development to oxazepam, but the drug was not able to produce an anxiolytic effect in the state of full tolerance to oxazepam (after 3 weeks).", 
    "36": "The neural mechanisms underlying benzodiazepine dependence remain equivocal. The present studies tested the hypothesis that similar neural systems are recruited during diazepam tolerance and withdrawal, and that these are associated with changes in GABA(A) receptor properties. 2-Deoxyglucose quantitative autoradiography was employed to map the brain structures affected during chronic treatment and withdrawal from diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p. daily) in rats. Acute administration of diazepam evoked widespread reductions in local rates of cerebral glucose (LCGU) utilization throughout the brain. Brain structures associated with sensory processing developed tolerance to these depressant effects of diazepam after 3 days of treatment, whereas tolerance occurred in the Papez circuit of emotion after 28 days of treatment. These data suggest that adaptive changes in different neuroanatomical circuits may underlie tolerance to the various effects of diazepam. During flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal from diazepam there were marked increases in glucose use in structures of the Papez circuit, the nucleus accumbens, and the basolateral amygdala. These data suggest that the Papez circuit features strongly in diazepam tolerance and withdrawal and supports a common adaptive process being involved in these phenomena. While GABA enhancement of benzodiazepine binding was reduced in the nucleus accumbens after repeated diazepam treatment, there was little evidence to support adaptive changes in GABA(A) receptors or GABA(A) subunit gene expression (gamma2, alpha1, or alpha4) as underlying the functional changes in the identified circuits. Alternative neurochemical mechanisms, such as changes in glutamatergic function should be considered.", 
    "37": "Zolpidem (Zol), an omega1-agonist, acts via GABA(A) receptors but may differ qualitatively from diazepam (Dz) and other benzodiazepines (BZDs). We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, and crossover study to compare the psychomotor and cognitive effects of 15 mg Zol with those of 15 mg Dz, 30 mg oxazepam (Ox), 7.5 mg zopiclone (Zop), and ethanol (EOH; 0.65 + 0.35 g x kg(-1)) given to 12 subjects at 1-week intervals. Psychomotor tests (symbol digit substitution, simulated driving, flicker fusion, body sway) were done before and 1, 3.5, and 5 h after intake; immediate and delayed memory were measured between 1.5 and 3.5 h. The plasma concentrations of drugs were measured by gas chromatography and by radioreceptor assay (RRA). The mean values of EOH in blood at 1.5, 4, and 5.5 h were 0.82, 0.88, and 0.6 g x l(-1), and the mean values of RRA-assayed plasma Dz were 470, 330, and 210 microg x l(-1), respectively. The corresponding values of other hypnosedatives, in Dz equivalents (microg x l(-1)), were 550, 750, and 330 for Ox; 350, 270, and 70 for Zol; and 160, 210, and 70 for Zop. The standard RRA graph for Zol was significantly flatter than those for other hypnotics. Zol impaired coordinative, reactive, and cognitive skills at 1 and 3.5 h more clearly than the other agents did, the most sensitive performance (tracking) still being impaired by Zol at 5 h. Dz and Zop were less active than Zol objectively; subjective sedation after Dz and Zol was stronger than after Zop. Compared to placebo, all active agents tended to impair learning and memory, their decremental effects, in declining order, being Zol, Dz > EOH, Ox > Zop. During the delay, Dz and Zol caused similar losses of material that had been learned. When separating \"true\" delayed memory from immediate memory (attention important), Dz and Zol had equieffects on delayed memory and were more detrimental than Zop. When contrasting that against the impaired psychomotor performances, it is possible that 15 mg Zol impairs memory relatively less than 15 mg Dz does.", 
    "38": "It is notoriously difficult to assess the contribution of the sedative effects of benzodiazepines to the cognitive impairments that they produce. The purpose of the present experiment was to determine whether a similar pattern of cognitive impairment would be seen in conditions when subjects felt equally sleepy as the result of sleep deprivation. The effects of a sedative dose of lorazepam (2.5 mg) in healthy volunteers was therefore compared with the effects of acute sleep deprivation (a night on-call) in a group of junior doctors and the effects of chronically disturbed sleep due to snoring. Lorazepam, acute sleep deprivation, and chronic sleep disturbance all significantly increased subjective sedation. In addition, lorazepam significantly impaired performance in two tests of psychomotor speed and caused significant anterograde amnesia. Semantic and short-term memory were not impaired by lorazepam, nor was there any impairment in executive function. The only deficit found following acute sleep deprivation was in a test of semantic memory, generating examples from a difficult category. The only significant deficit in the group suffering from chronically disturbed sleep, compared with age-matched controls, was in executive function, and there was a nearly significant impairment in sustained attention. These results suggest that, despite the common factor of increased subjective sedation, the profile of cognitive impairment in the two sleep deprivation groups are neither similar to each other nor to that seen following an acute dose of lorazepam.", 
    "39": "One-trial conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) in honeybees was used to examine the qualitative effects of two muscarinic antagonists, atropine and pirenzepine, on the acquisition and retrieval of memory following intracranial injection. The main result of this study is that atropine, at a relatively high concentration of 10(-2) M, impairs memory retrieval but not acquisition of memory after a single olfactory conditioning trial (at this concentration, there is no effect of atropine on the sensorimotor components of the PER). This result is in agreement with the effects of scopolamine, reported in a previously published article. Pirenzepine, at the same concentration as atropine, had no effect on either acquisition or retrieval of memory. These results suggest that blockade of muscarinic-like receptors, except those that bind to pirenzepine, induces solely an impairment of memory retrieval.", 
    "40": "The importance of the infant's cholecystokinin (CCK) system for eliciting optimal maternal care was examined in 6-9-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. After administration of either vehicle, CCK-8 (1 or 8 microg/kg) or devazepide (1 mg/kg; a selective CCK(A) receptor antagonist), pups were either individually isolated (Experiment 1) or individually reunited with their dam (Experiment 2) and the rats' behavior was observed. When isolated, pups that received devazepide displayed significantly more head-lifting and wall-climbing attempts than vehicle-treated controls, suggesting that endogenous CCK dampens activity. Devazepide-treated rats were found more frequently in proximity with their mothers when reunited with them, and they emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations compared to vehicle controls. Pups treated with 1 microg/kg CCK received less body licking than vehicle controls. In addition, dams hovered and crouched over devazepide-treated pups more than over pups treated with 1 microg/kg CCK. The results suggest that endogenous CCK has a calming, quieting effect in the neonatal pup and that this, in turn, results in less infant-mother attractivity and reduced levels of maternal care.",

    "50": "By using [11C]flumazenil-positron emission tomography ([11C]FMZ-PET), we have previously shown that reductions of central benzodiazepine receptors (cBZRs) are restricted to the hippocampus in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) caused by unilateral hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Receptor autoradiographic studies on resected hippocampal specimens from the same patients demonstrated loss of cBZRs that was over and above loss of neurons in the CA1 subregion. Here, we report the first direct comparison of in vivo cBZR binding with [11C]FMZ-PET and ex vivo binding using [3H]FMZ autoradiography. We applied a magnetic resonance imaging-based method for partial volume effect correction to the PET images of [11C]FMZ volume of distribution ([11C]FMZ Vd) obtained in 10 patients with refractory mTLE due to unilateral, histologically verified HS. Saturation autoradiography was performed on the hippocampal specimens obtained from the same patients, allowing calculation of receptor availability ([3H]FMZ Bmax). After correction for partial volume effect, [11C]FMZ Vd in the body of the epileptogenic hippocampus was reduced by a mean of 42.1% compared with normal controls. [3H]FMZ Bmax, determined autoradiographically from the same hippocampal tissue, was reduced by a mean of 42.7% compared with control hippocampi. Absolute in vivo and ex vivo measurements of cBZR binding for the body of the hippocampus were significantly correlated in each individual. Our study demonstrates that reduction of available cBZR on remaining neurons in HS can be reliably detected in vivo by using [11C]FMZ-PET after correction for partial volume effect.",

Midazolam was injected i.m. with atropine 0.01 mg/kg 15 min before the induction of anesthesia. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2), sedation level, tongue root depression, eyelash reflex, and anterograde amnesia were monitored. There were no significant differences between male and female patients in any variables in any age. Decrease of SpO2 and loss of eyelash reflex were seen with midazolam 0.10 mg/kg in Group A, and with 0.08 mg/kg in Group B. In Group C, decreases in BP and SpO2, loss of eyelash reflex, and depression of the tongue root were observed with midazolam 0.06 mg/kg. In conclusion, the optimal doses of i.m. midazolam administered 15 min before the induction of anesthesia in male or female patients were 0.08, 0.06, and 0.04 mg/kg for Groups A, B, and C, respectively.",

Thirty ASA physical status I or II patients received either 3 mL of saline or 1.5 mg of midazolam (1.5 mL) plus 75 microg of fentanyl (1.5 mL) i.v. in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Five minutes later, lidocaine 1 mg/kg was injected i.v. At 1.5 min before and every minute after lidocaine administration, each subject was questioned regarding the presence of four symptoms of systemic lidocaine toxicity. Any new tinnitus, perioral numbness, metallic taste, or light-headedness within 5 min after lidocaine administration was considered a positive response. All 15 patients in the saline group (100% sensitivity) had a positive response to i.v. lidocaine, but only 9 of 15 patients in the sedation group had a positive response (60% sensitivity; P = 0.017).

Anesthesia was induced with i.v. propofol 1500 mg/h, fentanyl 4 microg/kg, vecuronium 0.15 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg and was maintained with propofol 6 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1). Mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate were recorded before the induction of anesthesia and before and after intubation and application of the pin head holder. Interventions required to maintain hemodynamic stability were compared between groups. Preinduction sedation scores and MAP values were similar between groups. MAP was significantly lower (P = 0.031) in the clonidine group after pin head-holder application. Interventions to stabilize MAP were not significantly different between groups (P = 0.11). We conclude that clonidine is effective in reducing the MAP increase with pin head-holder application in patients undergoing craniotomy.",

Without surgical intervention, all four of the authors' patients faced imminent death.

We therefore conducted a 10-year follow-up study (1983-1992) on usage patterns of benzodiazepines in a Dutch community of 13 500 people. Use decreased during the time of the study. Twelve (1983) to ten (1992) percent of the inhabitants was a recipient at least once a year of a benzodiazepine prescription. The use by gender showed more women using more prescriptions as men. Women were not prescribed more DDDs per prescription as men. Individual benzodiazepines showed differences in use by gender. Use increased with age among both women and men. Most of the users were 55 years or older. One out of three patients was either an incidental user (1-30 days use in one calendar year), a regular (31-180 days), or a long term user (more than 180 days). The use of long half-life hypnotics decreased, the use of the short half-life ones showed an increase. Behind a stable overall trend we found strong fluctuations in use of individual benzodiazepines.", 
    "59": "Gastrin is a physiologically important secretagogue. It is thought to stimulate parietal cells indirectly by mobilizing histamine from enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the oxyntic mucosa. Gastrin stimulates the secretory activity and growth of the ECL cells via an action on cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptors. Acute cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor blockade is known to inhibit gastrin-stimulated acid secretion but whether sustained cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor blockade will impair basal, gastrin- and histamine-stimulated acid secretion remains uncertain. The present study was designed to study the effect of long-term (4 weeks) cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor blockade on basal and stimulated acid secretion in conscious rats. The selective cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor antagonist YM022 (3 mumol.kg-1.hr-1) was given to gastric fistula rats by continuous subcutaneous infusion via osmotic minipumps for various times from 2 hr to 4 weeks. Basal, gastrin- and histamine-stimulated acid secretion were examined during and after cessation of treatment. Basal and histamine-stimulated acid secretion was not affected by YM022 during the 4 week period of administration, whereas gastrin-induced acid secretion was inhibited. YM022 induced hypergastrinaemia in freely fed rats but did not affect the serum gastrin level in fasted rats. The serum gastrin concentration and gastrin-induced acid secretion returned to control levels 3-7 days after termination of YM022 administration.", 
    "60": "The role of genotype in susceptibility to the behavioral actions of benzodiazepines is not well characterized. To develop a model for such studies, we have characterized the anxiolytic and sedative activities of diazepam in C57BL/6J and A/J inbred mice. C57BL/6J mice were more responsive than A/J mice to diazepam-induced anxiolytic-like activity in the mirrored chamber aversion assay and the elevated plus-maze assay. Basal activity of the two strains did not differ in either assay. In contrast, the two strains were equally responsive to the anxiolytic effects of the 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, buspirone. C57BL/6J mice were also more susceptible to the sedative effects of diazepam than were A/J mice. Flumazenil blocked the effects of diazepam in these behavioral assays. Measurement of diazepam and nordiazepam in blood and brain suggested that the response differences are of a pharmacodynamic rather than a pharmacokinetic nature. Taken together, these findings indicate that C57BL/6J and A/J mice provide a valuable tool for behavioral genetic studies of the mechanisms underlying the pharmacological actions of benzodiazepines.", 
    "61": "The anxiolytic effect of the synthetic analogue of the endogenous peptide tuftsin (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro) was studied in inbred mice Balb/c (C) and C57B1/6 (B6) with different heritable types of emotional-stress reaction. In C strain with genetically high level of anxiety and \"passive\" type of behaviour under conditions of avoidable and unavoidable stress (open field, elevated plus-maze, light-dark chamber) the heptapeptide prevented manifestations of anxiety being administered intraperitoneally in a wide range of active doses (200-3000 mcg/kg). The drug did not change the behaviour of B6 mice with low level of anxiety and active type of emotional-stress reaction. The described effect is comparable with tranquilizing-activatory action of low doses of benzodiazepine tranquillizers, however, in contrast to the latter, the heptapeptide has no side inhibitory behavioural effects even in high doses. The heptapeptide may be considered as a promising new anxioselective drug without side inhibitory behavioural effects which are typical for benzodiazepine tranquillizers.", 
    "62": "The acute korazol (pentylenetetrazol) injection (50 mg/kg) induced seizures which were accompanied by a long-lasting (from 30 minutes to 3 days) decrease in benzodiazepine receptor (BDR) density (Bmax) in rat cerebellum without change in affinity. The density of the BDR was normalized on the 7th day after seizure termination. There were no differences in the initial BDR characteristics between the animals more sensitive to korazol (a dose of 25 mg/kg was sufficient for seizure induction) and less sensitive (30 mg/kg were ineffective). The chronic daily (for 24 days) administration of korazol in a subconvulsive dose led to an increase in seizure readiness (kindling). In 30 min after the last korazol injection the BDR density was decreased to the same extent as after the acute 50 mg/kg korasol administration. The BDR density was normalized on the 7th day after kindling. It was demonstrated that the high-dose-induced and after-kindling seizures were underlain by the same mechanisms. The results suggest that the development of kindling depends on the state of the long-lasting receptors rather than the development of kindling forms the long-lasting reactions. The process of summation is at the basis of kindling development. The long-lasting decrease in activity of BDR receptors induced by a subconvulsive dose of korazol is summed with the following effect of the same dose.",

    "73": "We have previously shown that neurosteroids produce GABA-A receptor mediated antistress, anxiolytic and other behavioral effects in rodents. In the present study, the effects of neuroactive steroids on benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142-induced anxiogenesis were investigated using mirrored chamber and elevated plus-maze paradigms in mice. FG 7142 (5-20 mg/kg) not only produced a dose-dependent reduction in the duration of open arm exploration and the total number of open arm entries, but also increased the latency to enter the mirrored chamber, decreased the number of entries and total time spent in the chamber, indicative of anxiogenic-like effects. Neurosteroids allopregnanolone (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg) and pregnenolone sulfate (2 mg/kg) significantly reversed the FG 7142 (10 mg/kg)-induced anxiogenic response in both the paradigms, without producing any neurotoxicity. While dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (1 and 2 mg/kg) failed to influence the anxiogenic effects of FG 7142. The neuroactive steroid progesterone (1-10 mg/kg), and the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) receptor agonist 4'-chlordiazepam (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) dose-dependently blocked the FG 7142-induced anxiogenesis in a flumazenil (2 mg/kg)-insensitive manner. The 4'-chlordiazepam-induced reversal response was, however, prevented by pretreatment with PK11195 (2 mg/kg), a selective mitochondrial DBI receptor antagonist. Further, at the anxiolytic doses, these neurosteroids did not produce locomotor inhibition and ataxia. These data suggest that neurosteroids allopregnanolone, pregnenolone sulfate, progesterone and the mitochondrial DBI receptor agonist 4'-chlordiazepam reverses the anxiogenic-like effects of benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist FG 7142 in the mouse models of anxiety.", 
    "74": "We previously demonstrated that ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of triazolam biotransformation in vitro and in vivo. Despite significant elevations in triazolam plasma levels with coadministration of ketoconazole, the pharmacodynamic enhancement was lower than predicted based on plasma levels of triazolam. The present study examines the effects of ketoconazole on benzodiazepine receptor binding in vitro as well as on open-field behavior in male CD-1 mice. Triazolam alone inhibited [3H]flunitrazepam binding with an IC50 value of 0.85 nM and a Ki value of 0.50 nM. Ketoconazole alone also competitively antagonized [3H]flunitrazepam binding in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 1.56 microM and a Ki value of 1.17 microM. In the presence of 1, 3 or 9 microM ketoconazole, the IC50 value of triazolam was increased to 1.11, 1. 58 and 5.73 nM, respectively, whereas maximal binding was reduced by 36%, 69% and 89%. Coadministration of 50 mg/kg ketoconazole and triazolam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) to intact animals significantly elevated plasma and brain triazolam levels. Ketoconazole could be measured in mouse brain at levels averaging 31% of those in plasma. Ketoconazole alone had minimal or no effect on open field activity, but it significantly potentiated the decreased activity seen with triazolam administration. The ability of ketoconazole to inhibit triazolam displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam binding may explain the muted pharmacodynamic effect of this benzodiazepine in the presence of ketoconazole. Based on these results, it is likely that ketoconazole acts as a neutral ligand at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "75": "The aggregation of activated platelets is mediated by the binding of fibrinogen to its cell surface receptor, the integrin alphaIIbbeta3. The recognition of fibrinogen by alphaIIbbeta3 depends, in part, on the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) in the adhesive protein. The interactions of a cyclic RGD-containing pentapeptide, [3H]-SK&F-107260, and a 1,4-benzodiazepine-based nonpeptide [3H]-SB-214857, with purified alphaIIbbeta3 have been investigated. Both compounds potently inhibit platelet aggregation at submicromolar concentrations. Binding of both [3H]-SK&F-107260 (Kd = 1.19 nM) and [3H]-SB-214857 (Kd = 1.85 nM) to alphaIIbbeta3 is of high affinity and fully reversible. The binding is monophasic, indicating a single class of noncooperative binding sites. The two radioligands exhibited similar values in binding to alphaIIbbeta3 purified on an RGD-affinity column (Bmax = 0.2 mol/mol alphaIIbbeta3) or to alphaIIbbeta3 purified over a lentil lectin column (Bmax = 0.03 mol/mol alphaIIbbeta3), suggesting that SK&F-107260 and SB-214857 interact with the same population of receptors. Binding of [3H]-SK&F-107260 and [3H]-SB-214857 to alphaIIbbeta3 require divalent cations, Mg++, Ca++ and Mn++ are able to support binding, with Mn++ being the most effective.

The affinity constants (Ki) of these compounds, determined by the two radioligand binding assays, are similar. Furthermore, these compounds exhibit the same rank order of potency in inhibiting biotinylated-fibrinogen binding to alphaIIbbeta3. Scatchard plot analyses of the [3H]-SK&F-107260 binding isotherms in the presence of unlabeled SB-214857 and gamma-chain dodecapeptide reveal competitive-type antagonism, indicating that SB-214857, gamma-chain dodecapeptide and SK&F-107260 interact with mutually exclusive binding sites on alphaIIbbeta3.",

Each dose was administered for 17 days and then the dose was increased; the 32.0 mg/kg dose was administered for 27 days. Baboons had access to food pellets for 20 hr/day beginning 15 min after dosing. Each day, baboons were presented with a fine motor task. Observation sessions were conducted 1 hr after dosing on days 1, 10, 12 and 14 of each dose condition and after termination of drug dosing. On days 10 and 14 of each dose condition, vehicle and flumazenil (5 mg/kg i.m.) were administered, respectively. Zolpidem increased the number of pellets obtained by two of three baboons. Vomit and/or retch and grimace (signs believed to be indicative of abdominal discomfort) were observed in one or two baboons during all zolpidem dose conditions (1.0-32.0 mg/kg). Time to complete the fine motor task increased dose-dependently in all three baboons, and incoordination was observed during the task in two baboons at 10.0 and 32.0 mg/kg. Analysis of blood plasma showed that measurable levels of zolpidem were present 24 hr after dosing in all drug conditions. The signs of flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal were summarized on a 9-point scale. Scores ranged from 1 to 5 in the 1.0 mg/kg condition, from 2 to 5 in the 3.2 and 10.0 mg/kg conditions and from 4 to 6 in the 32.0 mg/kg condition. Signs that were considered intermediate in severity were observed. Specifically, tremor, jerk and/or rigidly braced posture was observed in one baboon at 1.0 mg/kg, two baboons at the next two doses and all three baboons at 32.0 mg/kg. Vomit and/or retch also occurred in two baboons at dose conditions above 1.0 mg/kg. Discontinuation of zolpidem dosing after 78 to 79 days resulted in mild withdrawal signs (e.g., number of pellets obtained were lower and number of 1-min intervals increased in which eyes were closed, or in which lying down, head lower than torso posture and/or withdrawn posture were observed) on the first day in two baboons. The peak withdrawal scores were 4 or 5 on days 5 to 10; two baboons vomited and/or retched and all three baboons showed tremor, jerk and/or rigidly braced posture. Thus, zolpidem produced physical dependence under once-daily dosing conditions, and the severity of the withdrawal syndrome can be characterized as intermediate.", 
    "77": "To quantitatively evaluate drug-drug interactions involving metabolic processes in the liver, we attempted to predict the increasing ratio of the plasma concentration of midazolam (MDZ) in the presence of cimetidine (CIM) or nizatidine (NZD) in rats. Under steady-state conditions for the plasma concentration of CIM or NZD, MDZ was administered through the portal vein. The AUC of MDZ in the presence of CIM was 2.5-fold higher than that in the absence of CIM. There was no effect of NZD on the AUC of MDZ. The liver/plasma concentration ratios for CIM and NZD were 4.0 and 2.7, respectively. The estimated liver unbound concentration (CH,f)/plasma unbound concentration (Cp,f) ratios for CIM and NZD were 1.9 and 2.4, respectively, suggesting concentrative hepatic accumulation of both drugs. The oxidative metabolism of MDZ in rat liver microsomes was competitively inhibited by CIM or NZD, and the Ki values of CIM and NZD were 110 and 2600 microM, respectively. Based on these data obtained in vivo and in vitro, the increasing ratios for MDZ in the presence of CIM or NZD were predicted using the equations Rp = 1 + Cp,f/Ki and RH = 1 + CH,f/Ki. The observed increasing ratios in the presence of CIM were very close to RH, compared with Rp. However, Cp, f and CH,f were much less than Ki and there was no difference between Rp and RH in the presence of NZD. Consequently, Cp,f and CH, f were greater than or equal to Ki and Cp,f was not equal to CH,f, as in the presence of CIM, and it was indicated that CH,f was more suitable for quantitatively predicting the drug-drug interactions than was Cp,f.", 
    "78": "The hormone progesterone is readily converted to 3alpha-OH-5alpha-pregnan-20-one (3alpha,5alpha-THP) in the brains of males and females. In the brain, 3alpha,5alpha-THP acts like a sedative, decreasing anxiety and reducing seizure activity, by enhancing the function of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the brain's major inhibitory neurotransmitter. Symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), such as anxiety and seizure susceptibility, are associated with sharp declines in circulating levels of progesterone and, consequently, of levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP in the brain. Abrupt discontinuation of use of sedatives such as benzodiazepines and ethanol can also produce PMS-like withdrawal symptoms. Here we report a progesterone-withdrawal paradigm, designed to mimic PMS and post-partum syndrome in a rat model. In this model, withdrawal of progesterone leads to increased seizure susceptibility and insensitivity to benzodiazepine sedatives through an effect on gene transcription. Specifically, this effect was due to reduced levels of 3alpha,5alpha-THP which enhance transcription of the gene encoding the alpha4 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor. We also find that increased susceptibility to seizure after progesferone withdrawal is due to a sixfold decrease in the decay time for GABA currents and consequent decreased inhibitory function. Blockade of the alpha4 gene transcript prevents these withdrawal properties. PMS symptoms may therefore be attributable, in part, to alterations in expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits as a result of progesterone withdrawal.",

Two widely used models have been applied to quantify the effect of micelles on the pKa of the drugs, and the results obtained point to different interactions of each family of drugs with the micelles.", 
    "80": "alpha-Chloralose is widely used as an anesthetic in the laboratory due to its minimal effects on autonomic and cardiovascular systems, yet little is known about its mechanism of action. We examined the effects of alpha-chloralose on gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor activity because recent studies have shown that several classes of general anesthetics modulate the function of this receptor. GABAA receptor activity was assayed by measuring the GABA-induced current in Xenopus oocytes expressed with human GABAA receptor alpha-1, beta-1 and gamma-2L subunits. alpha-Chloralose produced a concentration-dependent potentiation of the GABA-induced current with an EC50 value of 49 microM and a maximal effect of 239% of control. Membrane current was not affected by alpha-chloralose in the absence of GABA. alpha-Chloralose (100 microM) increased the affinity for GABA 5-fold and produced a small (17%) increase in the efficacy of GABA. Measurement of the reversal potentials for the alpha-chloralose response suggested that the effect is mediated through increased Cl- conductance. Studies of alpha-chloralose interactions with other allosteric modulators determined that alpha-chloralose binds to a site on the GABAA receptor complex distinct from the benzodiazepine, neurosteroid and barbiturate sites. Chloral hydrate, trichloroethanol and urethane also augmented GABA-induced currents. alpha-Chloralose had no effect on the hydroxytryptamine-induced currents in oocytes expressed with the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor. These data extend the number of classes of anesthetics that allosterically modulate GABAA receptor activity and indicate that GABAA receptors may be a common site of action for diverse classes of general anesthetics.", 
    "81": "A method to measure various aspects of exploratory behavior was further characterized using standard pharmacological treatments known to induce anxiety, or anxiolysis, or locomotor activation. FG 7142, an anxiogenic beta-carboline, induced a dose-dependent reduction in the rat exploratory behavior. A single FG 7142 (20 mg/kg) treatment before behavioral testing had a carry-over effect on rats' behavioral performance on the two subsequent days. When FG 7142 (20 mg/kg) was administered during five consecutive days before behavioral testing, its anxiogenic-like effect first deepened, but waned off by the fifth session. Diazepam at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg had no effect of its own, but blocked the anxiogenic-like effect of FG 7142 (10 mg/kg) treatment. At a higher dose (1 mg/kg), diazepam treatment reduced exploratory behavior, but this effect was not carried over to the drug-free sessions on the subsequent day. Buspirone and gepirone (both 1 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, had no effect. D-Amphetamine, a locomotion-enhancing drug which has anxiogenic-like properties in several tests of exploratory behavior, increased the activity of rats at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg, but at the dose of 1 mg/kg the only effect was a reduction in the number of rearings: this effect was not carried over to the subsequent retest. On the basis of the results described in this article and elsewhere, we suggest that this technique can be useful for separating a true anxiogenic drug from other compounds which influence exploratory activity.", 
    "82": "One hundred sixty-six patients suffering from major depressive disorders were treated for 8 weeks with nefazodone in an open study in dosage ranges from 200 to 600 mg. This report focuses primarily on the first week of therapy and on the concomitant use of several benzodiazepines, one of which is not metabolized by the cytochrome system (temazepam). Triazolam response was further evaluated as a function of two nefazodone dosage regimens provided during the first week of therapy, one group receiving nefazodone 200 mg/day for 7 days, and another group receiving nefazodone 200 mg/day for 3 days, followed by 4 days with 400 mg/day. Finally, a comparison of three different nefazodone dosages, the third being 400 mg from day 1 on, was also carried out. Outcome measures included Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total and the total of the three Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression insomnia items, as well as global improvement, a daily completed sleep questionnaire, and adverse event assessment. A combination of nefazodone with a benzodiazepine (BZ) caused more sedation than nefazodone alone; triazolam, the BZ with the shortest half-life and the highest dependence on the cytochrome 450 system for its metabolism, caused the least amount of sedation, and alprazolam and diazepam, the two daytime benzodiazepines, caused the most sedation. Triazolam caused significant and identical reduction of insomnia in both nefazodone groups. Compared with nefazodone 200 mg given as monotherapy, insomnia was significantly improved--not only by triazolam, but also alprazolam and diazepam, but not temazepam. The addition of nefazodone raised triazolam plasma levels to almost 500%, the plasma level of desmethyl-diazepam 87%, and that of alprazolam 34%. Temazepam plasma levels remained unchanged. When prescribing nefazodone with a benzodiazepine, one should expect an improved sleep pattern initially, but at the cost of clinically relevant daytime sedation. The prediction that temazepam, the only BZ not dependent on the cytochrome mechanism for metabolism, should be the least sedating, and triazolam, because of its cytochromic metabolism interference with nefazodone should be the most sedating, could not be confirmed. In fact, triazolam 0.25 mg capsules seem to be the safest treatment of choice when one has to combine a benzodiazepine with nefazodone in initial stages of therapy, at least of the four benzodiazepines tested in this study.", 
    "83": "Several attempts to increase diazepam solubility are in the literature. This study discusses these different solubilization approaches. Specific reference is given to the rationale in the application of pH control, cosolvency, surfactants, and cyclodextrins. It was found than cosolvency is a more attractive means of solubilizing diazepam than either pH control, surfactants, or cyclodextrins. Advantages, assumptions, and limitations of these diazepam solubilization techniques are also described.",

    "85": "A retrospective study of 212 clinical records.", 
    "86": "The commonest withdrawal effects were tremulousness (68.7%) 7 agitation (67.3%) and hallucinations (46%). Most patients were male. The 64% recognize a period of relative or absolute abstinence less than two days, and a 67.8% have been previous incident of withdrawal syndrome. The commonest complications during hospital stay were rhabdomyolysis (26%). Time of symptoms were three days and mean of hospitalization were 14 days. The treatment used was the correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance (93%) and B vitamins (98%). In relation to the use of drugs, in 84% of our patients we used benzodiazepines with longer-acting, and clomethiazole in 50% of cases. Mortality were 0.9%.", 
    "87": "Patient with alcohol withdrawal syndrome was a male, previously drinker, with a period of abstinence less than two days. In addition to tremulousness and agitation, in our series, we wish to emphasize higher frequency of hallucinations, and the incidence of complications as rhabdomyolysis, despite of such response of treatment is good and mortality is low.", 
    "88": "Previous [11C]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) investigations in patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) have demonstrated nonsignificant global cortical decreases in central benzodiazepine gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA[A]) receptor (cBZR) binding or focal decreases in the thalamus and increases in the cerebellar nuclei with no changes in cerebral cortex. We previously reported lower [11C]FMZ binding in cerebral cortex of IGE patients treated with valproate (VPA) than in cerebral cortex of controls. We now report high-resolution three-dimensional [11C]FMZ PET studies in a larger number of subjects using an improved method to detect differences in cBZR between IGE patients and controls and a more powerful longitudinal design to determine the functional effect of VPA.", 
    "89": "We compared parametric images of [11C]FMZ volume of distribution (FMZVD) in 10 IGE patients before and after addition of VPA and in 20 normal subjects.", 
    "90": "Mean FMZVD was significantly higher in the cerebral cortex (11%, p = 0.009), thalamus (14%, p = 0.018), and cerebellum (15%, p = 0.027) of the 10 IGE patients as compared with that of 20 normal controls. Using statistical parametric mapping, no significant areas of focal abnormality of FMZVD were detected. Addition of VPA was not associated with a significant change in mean FMZVD in any brain area.", 
    "91": "Our finding of increased FMZVD in IGE could reflect microdysgenesis or a state of cortical hyperexcitability. Our data suggest that short-term VPA therapy does not affect the number of available cBZR in patients with IGE.", 
    "92": "Benzodiazepines have been reported to inhibit thyrotropin (TSH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion in response to stressful and pharmacologic stimuli in experimental animals. The current study investigates basal and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-stimulated TSH and PRL release in anxious patients treated with diazepam. Six hospitalized patients having generalized anxiety or adjustment disorder with anxious mood (DSM III-R criteria) were treated during 1 week with diazepam (mean daily dose 33.3 mg). TRH testing was performed comparatively before and after 7 days of diazepam administration (with 250 micrograms protirelin and blood sampling at 15-min intervals over 60 min). Steady-state plasma levels of diazepam and its metabolite nordazepam (desmethyldiazepam) were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. After 7 days of diazepam treatment, basal plasma levels of TSH and PRL were not affected compared with pretreatment values. Similarly, the time-course of TRH-induced TSH release was not modified by the treatment. By contrast, there was a trend to decrease in the TRH-induced PRL release, and the decrease in the PRL response to TRH on day 7 was significantly correlated with plasma nordazepam concentrations (rs = 0.943, p = 0.02). These preliminary results suggest that benzodiazepines, at therapeutic doses for the treatment of anxiety, may alter TRH-induced PRL release in humans.", 
    "93": "The effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of buspirone, a non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic agent, were investigated.", 
    "94": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study with two phases, 10 young healthy volunteers took either 600 mg rifampicin or matched placebo once daily for 5 days. On day 6, 30 mg buspirone was administered orally. Plasma buspirone concentrations and effects of buspirone were measured up to 10 h.", 
    "95": "The total area under the plasma buspirone concentration-time curve after rifampicin was 10.4% (95% CI, 6.3-14.5%) of that after placebo (1.64+/-0.35 ng ml(-1) h vs 22.0+/-15.1 ng ml(-1) h (mean+/-s.d.); P< 0.01). Rifampicin decreased the peak plasma concentration of buspirone from 6.6+/-3.7 ng ml(-1) to 0.84+/-0.23 ng ml(-1) (P< 0.01) and the half-life from 2.8+/-0.7 h to 1.3+/-0.5 h (P< 0.01). A significant (P<0.05) reduction in the effects of buspirone was observed in three of the six psychomotor tests employed (postural sway test with eyes closed, subjective drowsiness and overall drug effect) after rifampicin pretreatment.", 
    "96": "The strong interaction between rifampicin and buspirone is probably mostly due to enhanced CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism of buspirone. Buspirone will most likely show a greatly reduced anxiolytic effect when used together with rifampicin or other potent inducers of CYP3A4 such as phenytoin and carbamazepine.", 
    "97": "The conditioned place aversion paradigm was used to investigate the role of cholecystokinin in the aversive/dysphoric component of morphine abstinence. Several cholecystokinin ligands were chronically administered during the development of morphine dependence: the CCKA antagonist devazepide, the CCKB antagonists PD-134,308 and L-365,260, and the CCKB agonist BC 264. The CCK-B antagonists L-365,260 and PD-134,308 decreased and completely blocked (respectively) the place aversion induced by naloxone in morphine dependent animals whereas BC 264 and devazepide were inactive in this model. No effect was observed in non-dependent animals after chronic administration of these CCK-ligands. These results show a distinct role for CCK receptors in the regulation of the motivational component of morphine abstinence, probably related to their differential effects in the regulation of limbic dopaminergic neurons.",

    "99": "The study consisted of an open-label and a double-blind phases. Subjects held 10 mg MDL in 2 ml peppermint-flavored fluid or peppermint-flavored placebo in their mouth for 5 min and then spat it out. Cardiorespiratory and EEG monitoring was performed in all subjects.", 
    "100": "Venous MDL concentrations measured on 10 occasions from 5 to 600 min after administration showed a rapid increase for the first 20-30 min. However, changes in the 8- to 30-Hz frequencies identified by spectral analysis of the EEG showed changes in < or = 5-10 min in test but not in control subjects--more rapid than were expected from the venous absorption data. There were no significant adverse effects.", 
    "101": "Our data provide direct evidence of the speed of cerebral effect of a drug. Our results suggest that the buccal/sublingual route of administration should be tested in emergency treatment of seizures as an alternative to the rectal route, over which it has clear practical advantages.", 
    "102": "To determine whether repeat boluses of diazepam (DZP) lead to significant accumulation in the central nervous system and/or peripheral compartments, as repeat intravenous boluses of diazepam are commonly used in the treatment of status epilepticus (SE).", 
    "103": "In a rat model that permits simultaneous serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling, we characterized the pharmacokinetics of DZP and its metabolite, desmethyldiazepam, in CSF and blood using HPLC. DZP was administered by intraperitoneal injection as either a single dose (20 or 30 mg/kg) or repeat doses (10 or 20 mg/kg x 3, 1 h apart).", 
    "104": "After a single intraperitoneal dose, DZP was rapidly absorbed with a time to maximum concentration of 10 min. The serum concentrations then declined biexponentially. DZP rapidly entered the CSF, the CSF to serum ratio reached equilibrium within 10 min, and was equivalent to the ratio of free to total serum concentration. Repeated DZP dosing resulted in a threefold decrease in volume of distribution and clearance (p < 0.001). This was reflected in the CSF concentration data; however, after the third dose, the ratio of CSF to serum concentration, also increased greatly, representing further persistence of DZP in the CSF compartment.", 
    "105": "Repeat dosing of DZP leads to substantial accumulation, and high, persistent serum and CSF concentrations, which may explain the toxic effects of repeat DZP dosing. Repeat dosing of DZP using a tapering protocol, however, may increase the effectiveness of DZP in treating SE by preventing relapses without substantially increasing toxicity.", 
    "106": "Although the paradoxical ability of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) to increase seizure activity has been recognized for decades, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and few systematic studies have addressed this problem. This article is intended to provide a critical review of available literature on this topic.", 
    "107": "Information was collected by means of computerized literature searches, screening of journals and textbooks, and consultation with colleagues. Mechanisms which potentially might precipitate underlying drug-induced exacerbation of seizures were considered based on available pharmacologic and clinical knowledge.", 
    "108": "The reviewed information suggests that a paradoxical increase in seizure frequency may occur as a result of at least two separate mechanisms. The first appears to involve a nonspecific manifestation of drug intoxication; seizure-worsening in this context is usually reversible by dosage reduction or elimination of unnecessary polypharmacy. Conversely, the other mechanism may involve a distinct adverse primary action of the drug in specific seizure types or in syndromic forms. Carabamazepine, in particular, has been reported to precipitate or exacerbate a variety of seizures, most notably absence, atonic, or myoclonic seizures in patients with generalized epilepsies characterized by bursts of diffuse and bilaterally synchronous spike-and-wave EEG activity. Phenytoin and vigabatrin also have been implicated in worsening of seizures, particularly generalized seizures, whereas gabapentin has been associated repeatedly with precipitation of myoclonic jerks. Benzodiazepines occasionally have been reported to precipitate tonic seizures, especially when given intravenously to control other seizure types in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Seizure deterioration has been reported also with other drugs; though in most cases evidence is still insufficient for meaningful conclusions to be drawn.", 
    "109": "Drug-induced exacerbation of seizures is a serious and common clinical problem that is often unrecognized or overlooked by the treating physician. Its occurrence appears to be related to three possible causes: an incorrect diagnosis of seizure type or syndromic form, lack of knowledge about certain drugs that are contraindicated in specific types of epilepsies, or to prescription of excessive drug dosages and drug combinations. Further studies are required to evaluate the prevalence of this phenomenon of drug-induced exacerbation of seizures, to investigate its mechanisms in greater detail and to characterize additional prognostic factors that may be used for early identification of patients at risk.", 
    "110": "Idiopathic cervical dystonia (ICD) is the most common form of adult-onset focal dystonia. Previously, disagreement existed about whether ICD was a psychiatric illness, but the disorder is now viewed as a neurological illness and large clinical series have clarified the clinical features of the disease. At the time of diagnosis, extracervical dystonia is found in approximately 20% of patients, and there may be a concomitant head or hand tremor. Importantly, adult-onset ICD does not become generalized, although there may be segmental spread and pain may increase independently of the dystonia. While 10-20% of patients may experience remission, nearly all patients relapse within 5 years and are left with persistent disease. The aetiology of ICD is unknown, but there has been much progress in clarifying the genetic abnormality in families with inherited adult-onset cervical dystonia; linkage to chromosome 18p has been demonstrated in one family, and the DYT1 locus has been excluded in two other families. Painful trauma may be involved in the pathogenesis of ICD. Painful stimuli are received and processed by the basal ganglia, and the synaptic changes provoked by pain may lead to the abnormal physiology underlying dystonia. Consistent with this idea are experiments which demonstrate that altered sensory input leads to plasticity of the motor cortex, and those that explore the 'tonic vibration reflex' in patients with dystonia. Another theory suggests that a primary vestibular abnormality is responsible for ICD. Botulinum toxin is the most effective treatment for ICD. Roughly 75% of patients improve, and a response is generally seen within the first week. However, many questions remain regarding the optimal technique of administration. The development of neutralizing antibodies occurs in at least 5-10% of patients, and appears to be related both to dosage and to the interval between treatments. Side-effects are generally mild and result from the action of the toxin in the periphery. If the response to botulinum toxin is not adequate, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, baclofen and other medications are used as adjunctive therapy. Surgical therapies are available for the treatment of ICD but are reserved for patients refractory to conservative measures.", 
    "111": "Recently, an 86-amino acid polypeptide with high affinity for diazepam binding sites, termed diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), has been found in the rat brain. DBI, as well as a peptide derived from DBI, the octadecaneuropeptide DBI[33-50] (ODN), interacts with the GABA(A) receptor complex. To investigate the role of these endogenous ligands for GABA(A) receptors on prolactin gene expression, we studied the effects of acute intracerebroventricular administration (4 h before sacrifice) of ODN on prolactin mRNA levels in the male rat. Because, in some neuropeptidergic systems, glucocorticoids play a role in the response to ODN, we also studied the influence of adrenal glands and the effect of dexamethasone administration in the response of prolactin gene expression to ODN. ODN injection produced an increase in prolactin mRNA levels. Adrenalectomy performed 5 days before sacrifice resulted in an increase in prolactin gene expression and also potentiated the stimulating effect of ODN. Because castration has been shown to decrease prolactin gene expression in the male rat, we used castrated and adrenalectomized animals to study the role of dexamethasone in the response of lactotrophs to ODN. In these steroid-deprived animals, dexamethasone treatment (for 4 days) decreased prolactin mRNA levels but did not modify the response to ODN. These data indicate that an endogenous neuropeptide interacting with the GABA(A) receptor complex can stimulate prolactin gene expression and suggest that the adrenal glands may produce factor(s) capable of decreasing prolactin mRNA. On the other hand, it does not appear that glucocorticoid hormones play a role in the effect of ODN on lactotroph activity.", 
    "112": "Patient premedication for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is still under debate, especially the use of sedatives. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study to clarify the efficacy of low-dose intravenous midazolam as premedication for TEE. Placebo or midazolam (< or =50 kg, 2.0 mg intravenously; 50 to 80 kg, 2.5 mg; and > or =80 kg, 3.0 mg intravenously) was given in addition to topical anesthesia to 200 consecutive in- and outpatients. Blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored. Patients were interviewed immediately, and 2 to 10 days after TEE. Sixteen patients received an additional dose of midazolam, and in 12 follow-up was incomplete. Patients taking midazolam reported less gag reflex at probe introduction and during TEE, as did the examiners (p < 0.05 to 0.0001). Probe manipulations were found to produce less discomfort after midazolam administration (p < 0.005). Midazolam patients experienced less dyspnea (p < 0.01) despite a minimal decrease in oxygen saturation of 2% (p < 0.0001). The following day patients taking midazolam reported less sore throats, and painful swallowing was less frequent (p < 0.01 to 0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased slightly in the midazolam group (132 +/- 24 to 121 +/- 20 mm Hg, p < 0.0001). The rate of minor complications showed no difference. Thus, TEE probe introduction and manipulation was tolerated better after low-dose midazolam premedication, and patients experienced less pharyngeal discomfort the day after. Midazolam was well tolerated and the complication rate did not increase. Thus low-dose, short-acting benzodiazepine premedication improves patient comfort during and after TEE and generous use can be recommended.", 
    "113": "To identify the muscarinic subtype present on the rat pancreatic acinar cell, we examined the effects of different muscarinic receptor antagonists on amylase secretion and proteolytic zymogen processing in isolated rat pancreatic acini. Maximal zymogen processing required a concentration of carbachol 10- to 100-fold greater (10(-3) M) than that required for maximal amylase secretion (10(-5) M). Although both secretion and conversion were inhibited by the M3 antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine (4-DAMP) (50% inhibition approximately 6 x 10(-7) M and 1 x 10(-8) M, respectively), the most potent inhibitor was the M1 antagonist telenzepine (50% inhibition approximately 5 x 10(-10) M and 1 x 10(-11) M, respectively). Pirenzepine, another M1 antagonist, and the M2 antagonist methoctramine did not reduce amylase secretion or zymogen processing in concentrations up to 1 x 10(-5) M. Analysis of acinar cell muscarinic receptor by PCR revealed expression of both m1 and m3 subtypes. The pancreatic acinar cell has a distinct pattern of muscarinic antagonist sensitivity (telenzepine > 4-DAMP > pirenzepine) with respect to both amylase secretion and zymogen conversion.", 
    "114": "Administration of 0.05 g gidazepam once or twice daily for 7 days increased the stroke volume (SV) and circulation volume (CV) and reduced total peripheral resistance in neurotic patients. In healthy individuals 0.05 g gidazepam administered 60 min before an important examination stabilized CV. In subjects kept for 60 min in a microclimate with increasing temperature (55 +/- 2 degrees C, relative humidity 75-80%, rate of movement 1.5 m/min, rectal temperature at the end of exposure 39 degrees C) 0.05 g gidazepam administered 60 min before overheating optimally reorganized the reaction of the cardiovascular system, stabilized the SV at the initial level, which together with the growing heart rate increased the CV and provided sufficient perfusion of the vital organs. In healthy subjects working as operators for 4 h under conditions of hypercapnia (1.5% CO2), a single administration of 0.05 g gidazepam one hour before the beginning of work reduced the pulse pressure and increased the SV. The results obtained are evidence of the safety of using gidazepam as a corrector of emotion-induced disorders in operator performance under extreme conditions.", 
    "115": "1. The capacity of a number of antifungal azoles, CNS-active drugs (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepine hypnosedative-anxiolytics) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) to inhibit human liver microsomal 4-nitrophenol (4NP) hydroxylation, a marker of CYP2E1 activity, was investigated. 2. The imidazoles bifonazole, clotrimazole, econazole and miconazole were un- or non-competitive inhibitors of 4NP hydroxylation, with apparent Ki values ranging from 4 to 25 microM. Fluonazole, itraconazole and ketoconazole caused minor or negligible inhibition. 3. Of the CNS-active drugs screened, significant inhibition occurred only with tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazine antipsychotics and two benzodiazepines (flurazepam and medazepam). Un- or non-competitive inhibition was similarly observed for the tricyclic antidepressants, phenothiazines, flurazepam and medazepam, with apparent Ki values ranging from 175 to 1000 microM. 4. Diclofenac and flufenamic acid were the only NSAIDs found to inhibit 4NP hydroxylation substantially; kinetic analysis was suggestive of activation-inhibition phenomena. 5. These data indicate that, although not substrates for CYP2E1, some clinically used drugs have the capacity to inhibit this enzyme and hence have the potential to modulate the toxicity of non-drug xenobiotics metabolized by CYP2E1.", 
    "116": "Currently there are approximately 31.5 million Americans 65 years and older. This number is expected to reach 39.3 million by 2010. This group represents 12% of the population, however, they use 25% to 40% of the prescription medications, averaging 4.5 medications daily; 75% of them use over-the-counter medications as well. This population has also experienced an increase in the prescription of central nervous system (CNS) medications. Benzodiazepines are the most widely prescribed class of CNS antianxiety/sedative medication. This article examines the use of benzodiazepines in relation to physiological, pharmacokintic, and pharmacodynamic changes of the older adult. The amnestic properties of these drugs in relation to the already decreasing cognitive function of the older adult are explored in relationship to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, criteria for substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder.", 
    "117": "His101 of the GABA(A) receptor alpha1 subunit is an important determinant of benzodiazepine recognition and a major site of photolabeling by [3H]flunitrazepam. To investigate further the chemical specificity of the residue in this position, we substituted it with phenylalanine, tyrosine, lysine, glutamate, glutamine, or cysteine. The mutant alpha subunits were coexpressed with the rat beta2 and gamma2 subunits in TSA201 cells, and the effects of the substitutions on the binding of benzodiazepine site ligands were examined. [3H]Ro 15-4513 bound to all mutant receptors with equal or greater affinity than to the wild-type receptor. However, flunitrazepam and ZK93423 recognition was adversely affected by substitutions of the amino acid in this position. The binding of the antagonists, Ro 15-1788 and ZK93426, was also sensitive to the mutations, with the largest decreases in affinity occurring with the tyrosine, lysine, and glutamate substitutions. In all mutants that recognized flunitrazepam, GABA potentiated the binding of this ligand to a similar extent, suggesting that it is a full agonist at these receptors. The effects of GABA on the binding of Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-4513 suggest that their efficacies may have been changed by some of the substitutions. This study further emphasizes the importance of the residue at position 101 in both ligand recognition and pharmacological effect.", 
    "118": "The functional modulation of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors by protein kinase C (PKC) was investigated in cultures enriched in retinal amacrine-like cells. The kainate-evoked [Ca2+]i increase is due to Ca2+ entry through open AMPA receptor channels, because it was blocked by the active isomer of a 2,3-benzodiazepine (LY 303070), an AMPA receptor antagonist. The AMPA receptor response to kainate was potentiated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, which specifically stimulates PKC, and it was decreased by bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective inhibitor of PKC, as well as by PKC down-regulation. The results indicate not only that the AMPA receptor activation has a PKC requirement, but also that PKC amplifies maximal receptor activation by 100 microM kainate. The effect of PKC activation or inhibition on voltage-gated Ca2+-channel activity was also investigated. Activation of PKC caused inhibition of Ca2+ channels, and the same effect was produced by inhibition of PKC, whereas the inactive analogue of the phorbol ester did not affect channel activity. Our results show an important role for PKC in regulating the function of both AMPA receptors and Ca2+ channels in cultured retina cells.", 
    "119": "Zero-order correlational and simultaneous regression analyses were performed to ascertain the comparative validity of four measures of antisociality for predicting the initial 7 months treatment response of 193 male methadone maintenance (MM) patients. Predictor variables were the number of childhood conduct disorder (CD) behaviors, number of adult antisocial personality disorder (A-APD) behaviors, the revised Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R) score and the revised California Psychological Inventory-Socialization (CPI-So) scale score. The outcome measures were completion/noncompletion of 7 months of treatment, percent positive during-treatment of cocaine, opiate and benzodiazepine urine toxicologies, and change from baseline to 7 months follow-up in seven Addiction severity index (ASI) composite scores (CSs). All four measures of antisociality were significantly correlated with treatment noncompletion, although only the PCL-R score was significant in the predictor model. The PCL-R predicted more positive cocaine urines. At the individual level, both PCL-R and CPI-So were associated with more positive benzodiazepine urines, but neither contributed a significant amount of variance when both were entered in the model. None of the predictors were significantly associated with self reported improvement in the CSs. The PCL-R and CPI-So were more successful in predicting outcomes than the two behavior-based measures.", 
    "120": "RGH-2716 is a novel 1-oxa-3,8-diazaspiro[4.5] decan 2-one, which was published to have potent inhibitory effect on neuronal Na and Ca movement and stimulatory action on nerve growth factor (NGF)-production, as well as to show significant antiamnesic activity in experimental amnesia models. The aim of the present experiments was to study the effect of the compound on the learning process and on the different stages of memory using water-labyrinth in normal and memory impaired young animals, as well as to study cognitive effect of RGH-2716 on aged animals. At the doses of 0.5 mg/kg i.p. or 3 mg/kg p.o. given before daily swimming, this compound improved the learning process of young animals impaired by either diazepam (DIA) or scopolamine (SCOP). In retrograde amnesia model RGH-2716 (3 mg/kg p.o.) significantly ameliorated consolidation process and retrieval of information impaired by SCOP or DIA. Nimodipine and vinpocetine (10 mg/kg p.o.) showed moderate effect compared to RGH-2716. Aged rats pretreated with daily i.p. RGH-2716 performed the tasks with significantly fewer errors and shorter swimming time than untreated aged rats. When aged animals had to solve a new labyrinth problem, treated aged rats showed significantly better learning ability than aged controls. One month of oral treatment of aged rats with 3 mg/kg dose of RGH-2716 two times daily resulted in a \"tendency-like\" improvement in learning of aged Fischer 344 and spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. The present results make RGH-2716 an interesting compound for the treatment of cognitive disorders.", 
    "121": "The decrease in the seizure threshold for pentylenetetrazole in diazepam-withdrawn mice was not significantly affected by L-arginine (50 and 100 microg/mouse, i.c.v.), which did have an antiseizure effect in chronically vehicle-treated mice. Sodium nitroprusside (25 and 50 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) increased the seizure threshold for pentylenetetrazole in both diazepam-withdrawn mice and chronically vehicle-treated mice. In addition, the antiseizure effect of L-arginine was blocked by the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor, N-nitro-L-arginine (NOARG) and the NO scavenger, hemoglobin, while the effect of sodium nitroprusside was inhibited by hemoglobin, but not by NOARG, indicating that the antiseizure effect of L-arginine, but not that of sodium nitroprusside, is mediated by NO production resulting from the activation of NO synthase. Therefore, a decrease in the NO production via NO synthase may be involved in the hypersusceptibility to pentylenetetrazole during diazepam withdrawal.", 
    "122": "We investigated the role of the mitochondrial diazepam binding inhibitor receptor (MDR) in diazepam-withdrawal seizure. In chronically vehicle-treated mice, the potent and selective MDR agonist FGIN-1-27 (N,N-di-n-hexyl 2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide: 30 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) markedly increased the threshold for pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizure. The antiseizure effect of FGIN-1-27 was blocked by pretreatment with the selective MDR antagonist PK11195 (1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxa mide). In chronically diazepam-treated mice, the seizure threshold of PTZ was decreased during diazepam withdrawal, indicating withdrawal hyperexcitability. Interestingly, FGIN-1-27 (30 microg/mouse, i.c.v.) failed to increase the seizure threshold of PTZ in diazepam-withdrawn mice, in contrast to its effect in chronically vehicle-treated mice. These findings suggest that the sensitivity of MDR-mediated pathways in the brain may be decreased during diazepam withdrawal.", 
    "123": "A number of structurally diverse compounds have been shown to be potent inhibitors of the DNA polymerase activity of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT). The compounds can be grouped into two broad classes; nucleoside analogs and nonnucleoside RT inhibitors. The nonnucleoside RT inhibitors are quite specific for HIV-1 RT but not human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) RT. We have investigated the property of SIV/HIV-1 chimeric viruses in which portions of SIV(MAC) RT were exchanged with the corresponding domain of HIV-1 RT; amino acids 176-190, 176-383 and 176-495 of HIV-1 RT. The chimeric virus, which was substituted amino acids 176-190 of RT, had detectable RT activity, and this chimeric RT was sensitive to three nonnucleoside RT inhibitors [nevirapine, HEPT derivative (E-EBU-dM) and TIBO derivative (R82913)]. To further study this chimeric virus, we purified the chimeric RT enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli and determined its kinetic properties; the Km, and Vmax values, and the Ki value of HEPT derivative calculated for the DNA polymerase activity. This study reveals that amino acids 176-190 of SIV(MAC) RT were important for the enzymatic activity and the SIV/HIV-1 chimeric RT, which had amino acids 176-190 of HIV-1, was sensitive to the nonnucleoside RT inhibitor.", 
    "124": "After their first febrile seizure, 180 children were prospectively monitored to provide data for a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the factors affecting the risk of recurrence of febrile seizures and to evaluate the influence of recurrences on the outcome. Of these children, 153 had subsequent febrile episodes and were included in the risk-factor analysis. The outcome was evaluated after a 2-year follow-up in 156 children. Each febrile episode increased the risk of recurrence by 18%. Each degree of increase in temperature (Celsius) during subsequent infections almost doubled the risk of recurrence. Age, sex, the type of initial seizure, the temperature during the initial seizure, or a family history of febrile seizures or epilepsy did not influence the recurrence rate significantly. The results indicate that procedures that minimize the probability of febrile infections would decrease the risk of recurrences of febrile seizures.", 
    "125": "Incidence of severe depression is very common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Use of antidepressants in such cases is known to improve or worsen the existing PD. However, prediction of the effect of antidepressant on symptoms of PD is limited due to lack of suitable animal model. The present study examines the possibility of using haloperidol-induced catalepsy model in rats for this purpose. Antidepressants showed distinct effect on haloperidol-induced catalepsy, although most of them reduced forced-swimming induced immobility. In general, antidepressants with greater noradrenergic reuptake inhibition (desipramine, imipramine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, protriptyline and maprotiline) reduced, whereas those with serotonergic reuptake inhibition (fluoxetine and clomipramine) increased haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Mianserin, an atypical antidepressant, and alprazolam, a benzodiazepine receptor analogue had no effect on haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The results suggest that haloperidol-induced catalepsy model in rats needs to be incorporated in the screening procedure when evaluating the utility of antidepressant drugs for the treatment of depression associated with PD.", 
    "126": "A sample of 21 medicated and 20 nonmedicated insomniacs participated in a sleep medication withdrawal program that provided education about sleep medication and a gradual medication withdrawal schedule. Ten medicated participants received stimulus control treatment and the withdrawal program, and 11 medicated participants served as a control group that received only the withdrawal program. Half of the nonmedicated participants received stimulus control, and the remaining nonmedicated participants served as a wait-list control condition. Medicated participants significantly reduced sleep medication use without significant deterioration on sleep, anxiety, or depression measures from baseline to 8-week follow-up. Stimulus control participants, unlike control group participants, showed significant improvement at follow-up for total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and sleep quality. Stimulus control participants also reported less daytime sleepiness than control participants after treatment. Nonmedicated participants exhibited a more positive response to stimulus control than medicated participants.", 
    "127": "A literature review (1984 to 1995) was conducted to identify cost effective policy implications regarding substance use in the emergency room (ER) and trauma unit. Prevalence rates, ranging from 9% to 47%, vary according to where, when and who is tested. Other drugs, most commonly marijuana, benzodiazepines and cocaine, follow a similar pattern to alcohol. The optimal method of measuring substance use depends on the goal of the assessment and a combination of clinical, self-report and biochemical markers is recommended. Simple screening questions such as the TWEAK or AUDIT should be routinely used with all attendants and further assessment provided only when high risk factors have been identified. These include: males, younger patients, metropolitan centres, after midnight and on weekends, injury from violence, accidents including MVAs, high acuity and psychiatric morbidity. Further, this screening should be complimented by an intervention, referral and treatment resource for those in need.", 
    "128": "The effects of cholinergic drugs and the interaction between cholinergic and dopaminergic compounds were studied on electrically evoked [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) overflow in slices of the rat neostriatum. Slices were prepared and loaded with [3H]GABA in the presence of beta-alanine and then superfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing aminooxyacetic acid and nipecotic acid to inhibit GABA uptake and metabolism, respectively. The nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine (0.1-10 microM) increased the release of [3H]GABA and the selective M1 receptor agonist McN-A-343 (0.1-10 microM) exerted similar effect. The stimulatory effect of oxotremorine (10 microM) on [3H][GABA overflow was antagonized by the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine (1 microM) and the selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (0.1-1.0 microM). The M2 receptor antagonist methoctramine (1.0 microM) did not alter the stimulatory effect of oxotremorine. Of the muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, pirenzepine, and methoctramine (1.0 microM) failed to affect [3H]GABA overflow. The M3 receptor antagonist p-F-HHSiD (1 microM) increased [3H]GABA overflow and p-F-HHSiD and oxotremorine were found to be additive in increasing this effect. The D2 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride (10 microM) increased the electrical stimulation-induced [3H]GABA overflow, and this stimulation was counteracted by concomitant administration of atropine (1 microM). McN-A-343 and sulpiride also increased the KCl-induced [3H]GABA overflow from superfused neostriatal slices and tetrodotoxin (1 microM) did not affect these stimulations. These data indicate that the release of GABA in the neostriatum is under the control of M1 stimulatory and M3 inhibitory muscarinic receptors. Dopamine, which exerts inhibition on GABA release via D2 receptors, may counteract the M1 facilitation, and M1 and D2 receptors involved in the cholinergic-dopaminergic interaction may be located postsynaptically on medium-sized spiny GABAergic projection neurons.", 
    "129": "Mice were treated either with diazepam (15 mg/kg s.c. in oil), for 21 days, or for 3x7-day periods interspersed with two 72-h drug-free periods. Convulsant thresholds to pentylentetrazole infused into the tail vein 72 h following the final chronic treatment were lower in multiple-withdrawal mice than in mice which had experienced the same drug load, but only a single withdrawal, consistent with sensitisation of withdrawal events following previous withdrawal experience. The increase in seizure sensitivity of repeatedly withdrawn mice was prevented by treatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 39551 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) given once daily during the 3-day breaks in diazepam treatment, suggesting a role of glutamatergic transmission in the sensitisation process.", 
    "130": "The activity of anxiolytic and other drugs in a light-dark test situation was studied in rats treated with the anxiogenic compound m-chlorophenyl-piperazine (mCPP). mCPP 0.5 mg/kg significantly diminished the exploratory activity of the animals in the light compartment of the apparatus. Drugs to be tested against mCPP-induced anxiety when studied alone (not in combination with mCPP) did not significantly alter the activity of rats in the light-dark apparatus, except yohimbine, which reduced the movement time values in the lit area. 1,4-Benzodiazepines [diazepam (0.1-4mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (2-8mg/kg)], 5-HT2A/2C antagonists [ritanserin (0.25-8 mg/kg) and deramciclane (0.5-8 g/kg)], the 5-HT3 antagonist MDL-72222 (3 mg/kg) and ethanol (2-4 mg/kg) significantly reduced the effect of mCPP. A dose-dependent increase in the exploratory activity of mCPP-treated animals was found in the 2,3-benzodiazepine girisopam (2.5-5 mg/kg)-treated groups. Tofisopam, another 2,3-benzodiazepine molecule, also showed activity against mCPP, although its effect was not statistically significant. The 5-HT1A partial agonist buspirone was also active in the dose range of 0.25-0.5 mg/kg, while the 5-HT1A full agonist 8-OH-DPAT was the only drug with presumed anxiolytic activity that clearly lacked any effect in this model. Imipramine, amitriptyline, morphine, naloxone, haloperidol, clozapine, amphetamine, yohimbine, carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin were not effective. We conclude that mCPP-induced anxiety in the light-dark box is a potent and useful method for screening and detecting anxiolytic activity of a wide range of compounds with various modes of action.", 
    "131": "A computer-assisted and cross-reference literature search identified trials of therapy for alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Those with a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design were systematically assessed for quality of methodology. Fourteen studies were identified investigating 12 different drugs. The quality of methodological design, even among this highly selected group of published studies, was often poor. Study populations were generally under-defined, most studies excluded severely ill patients, control groups were poorly matched, and the use of additional medication may have confounded results in some studies. Twelve different rating scales were used to assess severity of symptoms. All 12 compounds investigated were reported to be superior to placebo, but this has only been replicated for benzodiazepines and chlormethiazole. Further research using better methods is required to allow comparison of different drugs in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. On the evidence available, a long-acting benzodiazepine should be the drug of first choice.",

The pseudosclerotic type of Wilson's disease, also known as the Westphal-Str\u00fcmpell form, is distinguished by positional tremor, ataxia and dysarthria as the main symptoms. We use the example of a 23-year-old patient whose neurological symptoms were preceded by a long history of a schizophrenic-like disorder. Clinical symptoms are presented. MRI, SPECT and PET images are illustrated. Therapy and outcome are discussed.", 
    "133": "Systemic and localised adverse effects of local anaesthetic drugs usually occur because of excessive dosage, rapid absorption or inadvertent intravascular injection. Small children are more prone than adults to methaemoglobinaemia, and the combination of sulfonamides and prilocaine, even when correctly administered, should be avoided in this age group. The incidence of true allergy to local anaesthetics is rare. All local anaesthetics can cause CNS toxicity and cardiovascular toxicity if their plasma concentrations are increased by accidental intravenous injection or an absolute overdose. Excitation of the CNS may be manifested by numbness of the tongue and perioral area, and restlessness, which may progress to seizures, respiratory failure and coma. Bupivacaine is the local anaesthetic most frequently associated with seizures. Treatment of CNS toxicity includes maintaining adequate ventilation and oxygenation, and controlling seizures with the administration of thiopental sodium or benzodiazepines. Cardiovascular toxicity generally begins after signs of CNS toxicity have occurred. Bupivacaine and etidocaine appear to be more cardiotoxic than most other commonly used local anaesthetics. Sudden onset of profound bradycardia and asystole during neuraxial blockade is of great concern and the mechanism(s) remains largely unknown. Treatment of cardiovascular toxicity depends on the severity of effects. Cardiac arrest caused by local anaesthetics should be treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation procedures, but bupivacaine-induced dysrhythmias may be refractory to treatment. Many recent reports of permanent neurological complications involved patients who had received continuous spinal anaesthesia through a microcatheter. Injection of local anaesthetic through microcatheters and possibly small-gauge spinal needles results in poor CSF mixing and accumulation of high concentrations of local anaesthetic in the areas of the lumbosacral nerve roots. In contrast to bupivacaine, the hyperbaric lidocaine (lignocaine) formulation carries a substantial risk of neurotoxicity when given intrathecally. Drugs altering plasma cholinesterase activity have the potential to decrease hydrolysis of ester-type local anaesthetics. Drugs inhibiting hepatic microsomal enzymes, such as cimetidine, may allow the accumulation of unexpectedly high (possibly toxic) blood concentrations of lidocaine. Reduction of hepatic blood flow by drugs or hypotension will decrease the hepatic clearance of amide local anaesthetics. Special caution must be exercised in patients taking digoxin, calcium antagonists and/or beta-blockers.", 
    "134": "The effects of the availability of risperidone and olanzapine on the indications for which clozapine is prescribed (treatment-resistance, treatment-intolerance, and/or negative symptoms) were examined for 252 patients with schizophrenia who began treatment at our hospital between June 1990 and June 1997. There were no statistical differences in the indications for clozapine treatment before and after the availability of either risperidone or olanzapine. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the frequencies of the indications in subgroups of patients who had previously received a trial with risperidone or olanzapine, as compared with the remaining patients. The indications for clozapine appear to have been unaffected by the advent of risperidone and olanzapine; however, we noted a decrease in the absolute number of patients starting clozapine after risperidone became available. More recently, the majority of patients referred for treatment with clozapine had received previous trials with risperidone or olanzapine.", 
    "135": "Atypical neuroleptics present a unique opportunity to examine confounding by neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) in the assessment of negative signs of schizophrenia. EPS, such as facial bradykinesia and akinesia, involve some of the same response systems and phenomena as emotional display channels. EPS are attributed to the blockade of dopamine receptors in the striatum by traditional neuroleptics. Newer atypical neuroleptics target primarily mesolimbic and mesocortical areas, and receptors for other transmitters such as serotonin. Olanzapine has been reported as less likely to cause EPS and may improve some negative signs. We investigated the relationship between measures of EPS and negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia treated with haloperidol or olanzapine. Patients were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Simpson-Angus Scale EPS scale. Results show that the two agents have comparable efficacy but different safety outcomes. A positive correlation between EPS and PANSS negative score was detected in the haloperidol group only. Stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that a big proportion of variability in PANSS negative symptoms is predicted by EPS in the haloperidol group, but not in the olanzapine group, even though EPS increased in patients treated with haloperidol but not in olanzapine patients.", 
    "136": "The effect of ethanol withdrawal on hippocampal acetylcholine (ACh) release was investigated by brain microdialysis in rats rendered ethanol dependent by repeated forced administration of a 20% ethanol solution for 7 days. The behavioral signs of ethanol withdrawal were accompanied by an increase in hippocampal ACh output that was significantly 6 h after the last ethanol administration, reached a maximum (fourfold) at 12 h, and persisted for >72 h. Administration of diazepam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or gamma-hydroxybutyrate (1 g/kg, intragastric) 12 h after the last ethanol administration completely antagonized, within 30 min, the increase in ACh output induced by ethanol withdrawal. Thus, the rapid and marked increase in ACh output might contribute to the changes in cognitive function associated with ethanol withdrawal, and the septohippocampal cholinergic system may play a major role in the response to withdrawal of addictive drugs.", 
    "137": "The novel imidazothienodiazepine inverse agonist RO19-4603 has been reported to attenuate EtOH intake in home cage drinking tests for at least 24 h post-drug administration after systemic administration. In the present study, selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats were trained under a concurrent (FR4-FR4) operant schedule to press one lever for EtOH (10% v/v) and another lever for saccharin (0.05% or 0.75% g/v), then dose-response and timecourse effects of RO19-4603 were evaluated. Systemic RO19-4603 injections (0.0045-0.3 mg/kg; i.p.) profoundly reduced EtOH responding by as much as 97% of vehicle control on day 1. No effects were seen on saccharin responding except with the highest dose level (0.3 mg/kg). In a second experiment, microinjections of RO19-4603 (2-100 ng) directly into the nucleus accumbens (NA) suppressed EtOH responding on day 1 by as much as 53% of control: Control injections dorsal to the NA or ventral tegmental area did not significantly alter EtOH or saccharin responding. On day 2, rats in both experiments received no RO19-4603 treatments; however, all 7 of the i.p. doses, and all 3 of the intra-NA infusions continued to significantly suppress EtOH responding by 43-85% of vehicle control levels. In addition, i.p. injections of RO19-4603 produced a dose-dependent decrease in the slope of the cumulative record for EtOH responding, while concomitantly producing a dose-dependent increase in the slope for saccharin responding. RO19-4603's actions appear to be mediated via recognition sites at GABAA-BDZ receptors which regulate EtOH reinforcement, and not via mechanisms regulating ingestive behaviors. Based on recent in situ hybridization studies in our laboratory, we hypothesize that occupation of alpha4 containing GABAA diazepam insensitive (DI) receptors in the NA, may mediate in part, the RO19-4603 suppression of EtOH responding in EtOH-seeking P rats.", 
    "138": "Flavonoids isolated from plants used as tranquilizers in folkloric medicine have a selective affinity, for central benzodiazepine receptors (BDZ-Rs) and some of them possess a pharmacological profile compatible with a partial agonist action. Synthetic derivatives of the common flavone nucleus, give rise to high affinity ligands when electronegative groups are introduced in carbons 6 and/or 3'. Representative compounds such as 6,3'-dinitroflavone and, 6-bromo-3'-nitroflavone exhibit a high affinity for the BDZ-Rs (Ki = 1.5 to 30 nM) and have anxiolytic effects not associated with myorelaxant, sedative or amnesic actions. These compounds or similar ones, could lead to improved therapeutic drugs in the treatment of anxiety.", 
    "139": "There is an increasing problem with benzodiazepine co-abuse in the opiate dependent population of Dublin. The importance of early detection of this co-abuse is essential as there is an increased risk of dangerous injecting practices such as sharing of needles and criminality in those who co-abuse benzodiazepines and opiates. This study was carried out in the National Drug Treatment Centre, Dublin. It aims to describe the current difficulties in identifying the co-abuse of short acting benzodiazepines including flunitrazepam in a cohort of opiate dependent patients. Using a sample of those attending the clinic it was discovered that standard methods of urinalysis failed to identify 10% of co-abuse. For those patients whose abuse of flunitrazepam is undetected on screening, clinical interventions which aim to minimise the consequence of the co-abuse and reverse the chaotic drug using patterns fail to be put in place at the earliest possible time.", 
    "140": "Between 369 cases of benign partial epilepsy of the childhood with Rolandic spikes (BECRS) diagnosed in our hospital, we have been able to study three patients that have presented a neurophysiological and clinical presentation that was compatible with the form described by Aicardi and Chevrie in 1982.", 
    "141": "None of our patients had familial epilepsy precedents. There were no pathological birth or previous neurological disorders. The neurophysiological development was normal until the beginning of the clinical picture. The seizures began when the patients were 3 years and 4 months, and 5 years, with partial seizures of the same characteristic that present patients with BECRS. Two of them had generalized tonic-clonic seizures during sleep. All the patients presented throughout the evolution absences myoclonic and/or atonic seizures. The awake EEG patterns showed normal background activity and paroxysms of focal spike were complexes with diffusion to central areas. During the slow wave sleep, every cases showed paroxysms of diffuse and generalized slow spike and wave complexes practically continuous. The partial seizures were scarce, but the absences and the atonicas seizures presented several times every day, and in one case appeared in the form of a grand mal state.", 
    "142": "The evolution of the patients was favourable, as they were free of seizures, with a normal neurophysiological development. At the beginning, the seizures were resistant to treatment with several antiepileptics drugs (AED). The treatment with valproic acid (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP), has been very effective.",

    "145": "ECA gave a pH of maximum stability at pH approximately 7 and was independent of pH below pH approximately 4. A novel degradation pathway of ECA, conversion to ethoxycarbonyl- aminocarbonyl, was observed below pH 7. The relative rates below pH 7 were ECA approximately ETCA < PCA, in the same order of decreasing pKa of the conjugate acid of the substituted amidino group. Base-catalyzed cleavage of ECA to yield the amidine derivative gave the relative rates ECA < ETCA < PCA, in agreement with the decreasing pKa of the leaving groups.", 
    "146": "The observed rate constants at all pHs were small enough that only 5-30% (depending on the substituent) undesirable degradation is predicted during transit time of the gut. The spontaneous post-absorptive conversion to the amidine drugs at neutral pH is predicted to be 6x greater for the PCA than the ECA prodrugs.", 
    "147": "To evaluate benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor binding in the brains of patients with the Rett syndrome (RS), three Japanese adult females with stage IV RS were evaluated by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using [123I] iomazenil. The iomazenil images were obtained 20 min and 3 h post-injection and analyzed for BZD receptor binding. The binding potential (BP) for the BZD receptor was significantly decreased in the fronto-temporal cortex of the RS patients (P<0.05). They also exhibited a decreased BP ratio (BP of each region/BP of cerebellum) in the fronto-temporal (P<0.01), occipital and parietal (P<0.05) cortical gray matter as compared with the ratios observed in five healthy male volunteers. In one RS patient, a marked decrease of iomazenil binding was observed in the late SPECT images, while the early SPECT images showed well preserved cerebral perfusion. This difference strongly suggests that changes in the BZD receptor in RS are primary abnormality, not secondary to a decrease in cerebral blood flow."
