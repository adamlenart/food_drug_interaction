    "0": "Sixty-two adults with a current diagnosis of significant hypertension and accompanying moderate to severe anxiety were medicated with lorazepam or with placebo for a period of 4 weeks. The patients were assessed by 7 cardiologists under double-blind conditions and the results pooled. Symptoms of anxiety were quantified using a Global Physician Rating, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale and a Patient Self-Rating Scale. The symptoms of anxiety associated with hypertension were significantly relieved by lorazepam in comparison to placebo. Most lorazepam patients were controlled with 3 mg/day; except for 1 patient, side effects were mild and transient.", 
    "1": "Lorazepam was administered to 38 patients with moderate to severe anxiety associated with cardiovascular symptomatology. A comparable group of patients on placebo (35) served as controls in this 4-week study. Average dosage was 3 mg/day given as 2 mg in the evening and 1 mg in the morning. The Global response, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale scores, and 35-Item Self-Rating Scale scores showed lorazepam to be significantly more effective in relieving anxiety than placebo, both clinically and statistically. Adverse reactions were transient and tolerable, and were reported in only 2 patients on lorazepam.", 
    "2": "Twelve studies were undertaken under a common four-week protocol to investigate the efficacy of lorazepam compared with placebo in reducing the severity of moderate to severe anxiety in 264 patients also having significant depressive symptomatology. Analysis of the results indicated that lorazepam gave generally better anxiety relief than placebo; in the majority of comparisons the differences were substantial enough to be both statistically and clinically significant. No data were obtained evidencing significant toxicity in either treatment group.", 
    "3": "Lorazepam reduced conflict behavior in rats and monkeys, inhibited pentylenetetrazol- and electroshock-induced convulsions, suppressed footshock-induced fighting behavior, and prevented morphine-induced stimulation in mice at lower doses than other benzodiazepines tested. This behavioral profile suggests that lorazepam will be an active anti-anxiety agent in man at low doses.", 
    "4": "In a four-week double-blind study of 68 adult outpatients, lorazepam a new benzodiazepine, administered at an average total daily dosage level of 3.1 mg on a b.i.d. regimen, was clearly superior to placebo in the treatment of neurotic anxiety and its related symptoms. The lorazepam-treated group showed significantly greater improvement than the placebo-treated group (both clinically and statistically), as evidenced by the greater changes on the physician-rated Global Scale as well as by the greater changes in almost all categories on the physician-rated Hamilton Anxiety Scale and the patient-rated Lipman-Rickels 35-Item Self-Rating Scale. There were no clinically significant changes in vital signs or laboratory values and only one side effect, urinary retention (resolved without discontinuing the drug), was reported.", 
    "5": "The clinical pharmacokinetics of lorazepam, a 3-hydroxy, 1,4-benzodiazepine, indicate that it is rapidly and readily absorbed, reaching peak concentrations in the blood proportional to the dose approximately 2 hours after oral administration. Blood levels decline thereafter, with an elimination half-life of about 12 hrs. Conjugation with glucuronic acid to form inactive lorazepam glucuronide is the major metabolic pathway. Seventy (70) to 75% of the administered dose is excreted as the glucuronide conjugate in the urine. On multiple-dose regimens, steady state blood levels directly proportional to the daily dose occur within 2--3 days and are maintained after several months of continuous treatment. The active drug and the glucuronide conjugate are completely eliminated from the blood within 1 week following the last dose.", 
    "6": "The metabolic disposition of lorazepam (Wy-4036) in man, dog, cat, rat and miniature swine is compared. Except in the cat, absorption of lorazepam is rapid in these species. Absorption in humans is nearly complete. Lorazepam glucuronide is the major metabolite in all species except the rat in which a dihydrodiol derivative is the main product of lorazepam biotransformation. Lorazepam glucuronide, which has no demonstrable CNS activity, is also present in the plasma of all species investigated. The concentrations of lorazepam in rat brain correlate well with those in plasma but are about three times higher. The urinary route of excretion predominates in man, dog and miniature swine while in the rat the bulk of the drug-related material is eliminated with the feces as a consequence of biliary excretion.", 
    "7": "The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the effects of certain antianxiety agents, that is, minor tranquilizers, sedatives, and hypnotics, on relaxation training. Twelve inpatients and two outpatients were referred to group relaxation training because of tension-anxiety complaints and underwent three training sessions. Results for those patients who were not having any psychotropic medication (Relaxation Only group) were compared with results for those who were receiving anxiolytic drugs (Medication-Relaxation group). Patients in the second group were on antianxiety medication prior to and during relaxation training. Self-report measures indicate that the Relaxation Only group benefited more from relaxation training and showed more treatment generalization effects. The results are interpreted as lending some support to the view that antianxiety drugs may have an interfering effect on relaxation training. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.", 
    "8": "The effect of iontophoretically applied flurazepam on the spike activity of pericruciate cortical neurones of the cat was studied. Flurazepam increased cortical inhibition produced either by local electrical stimulation (which is known to release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or by iontophoretically applied GABA. Following intravenous treatment with thiosemicarbazide (a GABA-synthesis inhibitor), flurazepam still augmented the action of GABA but was much less effective on electrically evoked cortical inhibition. These findings suggest that part of the action of flurazepam on inhibitory cortical transmission might be at the presynaptic level.", 
    "9": "Lorazepam 2.5 mg was compared with promethazine 50 mg as oral premedication in a double-blind study in women. The premedication was given at the same time to all patients on each operating list, and both drugs continued to be effective 6 h after ingestion. A similar number of patients considered each drug to have relieved anxiety and the amnesic effect of lorazepam was confirmed. However, the use of lorazepam alone was accompanied by significantly more salivation during and after anaesthesia than the use of promethazine, especially in patients in whom the trachea was intubated. There was also a higher frequency of vomiting during and after operation with lorazepam (seven of 67 patients) than after promethazine (one of 71 patients). Promethazine produced dyskinetic side-effects in six of 71 patients.", 
    "10": "Camazepam, 5 mg/kg iv, was injected in rats and mice to study its distribution in the blood and brain. Peak blood levels were about 0.9 microgram/ml in rats and 0.6 microgram/ml in mice. Peak brain levels were about 1.5 microgram/g in rats and 0.8 microgram/g in mice. The apparent blood half-life of camazepam was 9 min in mice and 20 min in rats.", 
    "11": "The electrocardiogram was monitored in 100 patients undergoing oesphago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Premedication differed: 25 patients each were given either (Group I) atropine 0.5 mg, hyoscine-N-butylbromide 20 mg, and diazepam 5 mg, or (Group II) hyoscine-N-butyl-bromide 20 mg and diazepam 5 mg, or (Group II) diazepam 5 mg and glucagon 0.2 mg, or (Group IV) only diazepam 5 mg intravenously. After injection of the parasympatholytic drugs (Groups I and II) there was a significantly higher heart rate duringthe entire length of the examination than in groups III and IV. Nine of the ten cases of ascending S-T depression were found in Groups I and II, while descending (ischaemic) S-T changes occurred equally frequently in patients of all four groups. Two of the three more serious arrhythmias were registered after atropine. Since parasympatholytic drugs fail to inhibit arrhythmias and ST-T changes, while accentuating the rise in heart rate, it is recommended that premedication for oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy should not include such drugs.", 
    "12": "Analytical investigations of extracts after acid hydrolysis are in use especially considering benzodiazepine screening methods. The article describes the gas-chromatographic data of 19 hydrolysis-derivatives which are formed by hydrolysis of 12 important 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines and 17 main metabolites.", 
    "13": "Data is presented describing 345 self-poisoners presenting at the accident and emergency department and 211 referred to the psychiatric liaison service at Auckland Hospital during the 12 month period between August 1976 and July 1977. Both groups show the age and sex distribution commonly seen in self-poisoning, with a preponderance of young females. Referral rates increased with age and with the implication of anti-depressants, neuroleptics and anticonvulsants. Only 20 percent of the referred patients had a serious psychiatric disorder. Personality disorder, depressive neurosis and transient situational disturbance accounted for 80 percent. The benzodiazepine group of anxiolytics was implicated in 40 percent of incidents and the use of this class of medication is discussed in relation to the problem of self-poisoning. It is suggested that if all Auckland doctors made a decision not to prescribe oral benzodiazepines, the incidence of self-poisoning in the city could be reduced to a half to two thirds of its present proportions.", 
    "14": "Rebound insomnia followed the withdrawal of three benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs, each of which had been administered in a single nightly dose for only short-term periods. The intense worsening of sleep is attributed to the short duration of the action of these drugs. A hypothesis involving benzodiazepine receptors in the brain is proposed in which there is a delay or lag in replacement of endogenous benzodiazepine-like molecules after the abrupt withdrawal of exogenous drugs.", 
    "15": "The pharmacokinetics of diazepam and its biologically active metabolites desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam is critically evaluated from a clinically relevant point of view. The slow elimination of diazepam is dependent on the degree of plasma protein binding, the duration of the medication, the age and the liver function of the patient. While the normal half-life (T1/2(beta)) varies between 1 and 2 days, it can be increased to up to 80--100 h in subjects over 60 years of age. In patients with liver disease T1/2(beta) is about doubled, which is caused by a reduction (factor 2) of the normal hepatic clearance of 26 ml/min. After subchronic treatment with diazepam the elimination rate is reduced about 20--70% in healthy subjects, but liver patients exhibit only a slightly further prolongation in T1/2(beta). The major metabolite desmethyldiazepam has a T1/2(beta) of 51 h and a Cl of 11 ml/min and accumulates after multiple doses of diazepam since its elimination is much slower than that of its parent compound. The elimination of this drug is also impaired (factor 2) in patients with liver disease. In contrast to these findings oxazepam is excreted as glucuronide in the urine relatively fast and independently of the liver function with a T1/2(beta) of 5.5 h and a Cl of 130 ml/min.", 
    "16": "Five pigeons were successfully taught a variation of the Konorski delayed pair comparison task, using a red and a green stimulus. The bird was required to respond to the left or right hand key, depending on whether the 2 successively presented centre key stimuli were the same (left) or different (right). The delay intervals ranged from zero to 9 s, and stable performance decrements (with increasing delay) were obtained. Chlordiazepoxide which, it has been argued, produces behavioural changes similar to those observed after hippocampal lesions was found to disrupt performance at doses greater than 4 mg/kg (i.m.). All delays (including zero) were affected. Some interpretations of this result in terms of encoding and attention are discussed, and some reference made to the possible neuropharmacological basis of this drug action.", 
    "17": "Chlordiazepoxide (5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) increased the time spent eating familiar laboratory chow, in a food-choice test in which both familiar and novel food objects were available. Chlordiazepoxide did not affect the feeding response to the novel food. Prior handling of the rats and repeat testing affected feeding responses in the test, although in ways which were different from and independent of the effect of chlordiazepoxide. Chlordiazepoxide may facilitate feeding responses by a direct enhancement of feeding motivation, and not necessarily secondarily by either a release of suppression of feeding or as attenuation of anxiety evoked by unfamiliarity.", 
    "18": "The effects of diazepam and ethanol, alone and in combination, were studied in pigeons responding under acquisition and performance chain schedules. Both diazepam and ethanol increased the number of pecks on the incorrect key (errors). Under the acquisition schedule both diazepam and ethanol increased errors at doses lower than those under the performance schedule. Under both schedules effects of combinations of ethanol and diazepam were usually greater than the sum of the effects of the individual drugs.", 
    "19": "Two behaviors related to nonreward (omission of water in an enclosure where the rats were habituated to drink) were studied. The time spent licking the bottles during water omission and the time spent drinking during a subsequent 5-min drinking session (water available) were recorded. The drinking session was performed 30 min after the water-omission session. Rats subjected to water omission showed an enhanced drinking time that varied with the length of the water omission session, with the motivational state of the animals, and with the previous number of water-omission sessions. Diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, and meprobamate (i.p., 30 min before water omission), increased the time spent licking the empty bottles, but failed to abolish subsequently enhanced drinking. However, some of our data suggested that minor tranquilizers weakly reduced the increased drinking induced by nonreward, despite their direct stimulation on water drinking. It is proposed that either minor tranquilizers are devoid of general antifrustration activity or nonreward-induced frustration and nonreward-induced drive enhancement may not be correlated.", 
    "20": "The effect of diazepam was evaluated on spontaneous activity and drug- and electrically-elicited inhibitions of neuronal activity. Doses of diazepam which did not change spontaneous firing rates markedly enhanced GABA-mediated inhibitions in rat cerebellum in situ and in tissue cultures of rat hypothalamus. The effects of diazepam were readily reversible, and could be antagonized by picrotoxin; no effect on glycine or norepinephrine-induced inhibition was seen. It is concluded that actions of diazepam are mediated, at least in part, by a specific increase in GABA-mediated inhibition in the central nervous system.", 
    "21": "The effectiveness of cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride, a new tricyclic skeletal muscle relaxant, was shown in patients with long-term intractable pain of cervical and lumbar origin aggravated by skeletal muscle spasm and tenderness. The investigation was double-blind and randomized, comparing cyclobenzaprine hydrochloride (10 mg three times a day) with diazepam (5 mg three times a day) and with placebo. After two weeks of treatment, the 16 patients in the cyclobenzaprine group showed an overall improvement in pain variables as did the 16 patients in the diazepam group. No serious adverse reactions to cyclobenzaprine were observed in the study. However, dry mouth due to cyclobenzaprine's anticholinergic action and mild degrees of drowsiness were encountered more often than with diazepam or placebo.", 
    "22": "Using [(3)H]diazepam, benzodiazepine receptor binding has been investigated in rat spinal cord synaptosomal membranes. Specific [(3)H]diazepam binding is saturable with a K(D) of about 8 nM and a maximal number of binding sites of 0.48 pmol/mg protein, which is about half of the density found in rat brain synaptosomal membranes. Using 5 benzodiazepine derivatives and amino acid neurotransmitters and their antagonists, no differences in specific [(3)H]diazepam binding to rat spinal cord and rat brain synaptosomal membranes were found. The results do not support the hypothesis that benzodiazepines act via glycine receptors in the spinal cord.", 
    "23": "In a simple blind study to evaluate electroencephalographic criteria objectively, and to continue characterization of psychotropic compounds, 5 mg of nitrazepam, a hypnotic derivative, was given to seven subjects the night before the recording. We noted that in most subjects there was a reduction in the spectral intensity of the alpha rhythm, associated with a greater frequency instability, several hours after the absorption of nitrazepam. This corresponds to the tardive hypnotic action of the psychotrope, the importance of which is wellknown at the present time. In the same way as the increase in rapid rhythms, the slipping of 0.5 c/s of the dominant alpha frequency to the top could be characteristic of the action of nitrazepam.", 
    "24": "Chlordiazepoxide and scopolamine, given separately, during training in the shuttle-box or in trained mice, improved avoidance responding. Avoidance facilitation was much more evident, especially in the initial phases of training, when the two drugs were combined.", 
    "25": "Methods have been developed for the determination of the benzodiazepine tranquilizer prazepam and its metabolites desmethyl diazepam, 3-hydroxy-prazepam and oxazepam by electron capture gas chromatography and selected ion monitoring with diazepam as the internal standard. The benzodiazepines were isolated from blood serum or homogenized tissue samples, either by extraction with ethyl acetate or on small Extrelut columns packed with porous silica. The concentrated extracts were directly injected into the gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector. Following trimethylsilylation, analysis on a gas chromatography--mass spectrometry--computer system operated in the selected ion-monitoring mode was performed. Using 50--200 mg (microliter) biological material, concentrations of prazepam and metabolites of 5 ng/g(ml) could be determined with signal-to-noise ratios of greater than 10. Using 1 g(ml) samples, the same signal-to-noise ratios were obtained with 1 ng/g(ml) concentrations. The methods developed were applied to the analysis of the diaplacental transfer of prazepam and desmethyl diazepam in early human pregnancy. Furthermore, prazepam metabolism in human fetal liver and cell cultures was studied.", 
    "26": "The action of the analgesic phenthanyl, neuroleptic-droperidol and tranquilizer--diazepam on the contractile function of an isolated human myometrium was investigated. Phenthanyl (5.10(-8)--5.10(-7) g/ml) produced a stimulating influence on the contractility of an isolated human myometruim. When in relatively low concentrations (5.10(-7)--2.10(-6) g/ml) droperidol caused a stimulating effect and in higher concentrations (8.10(-6)--2.10(-5) g/ml) it exerted a biphasic action on the contractile function of an isolated myometrium, viz. first stimulation and then--inhibition. Diazepam (1.10(-12))--5.10(-8) g/ml suppressed the spontaneous periodic activity of an isolated human myometrium.", 
    "27": "Brain membranes from rat and human contain a single class of brain specific binding sites for pharmacologically and clinically active benzodiazepines. There is good correlation between the pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines and the affinity for the 3H-diazepam binding site. Benzodiazepine binding sites are not present on glial cells. Selective neuronal degeneration experiments in rats indicate a neuronal localization. 3H-Flunitrazepam is a very suitable ligand for affinity binding and it binds to the same class of binding sites as 3H-diazepam. Our results indicate that the in vitro 3H-diazepam and 3H-flunitrazepam binding sites are the receptors which in vivo mediate various pharmacological and clinical effects of benzodiazepines.", 
    "28": "The prevalence of abnormal serum total thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations were determined in 1,206 in-patients in two associated psychiatric hospitals. The biochemical pattern of primary hypothyroidism occurred in five females and one male (prevalence 0.5 per cent), but in only one patient was the diagnosis clinically obvious. Eight patients (all female) were clinically hyperthyroid (prevalence 0.7 per cent), of whom six were previously undiagnosed. There was no evidence that phenothiazines or benzodiazepine therapy had any significant effect on thyroid hormone levels. The small differences in thyroid hormone levels between psychiatric diagnostic groups could be explained by differences in age distribution.", 
    "29": "Intravenous infusion of oxotremorine, seduxene, and phentolamine to cats not only decreased the cold-induced tremor, but also reduced the subcutaneous vein receptor impulses. Diminished activity of the vascular thermoreceptors served as an additional component in the mechanisms of the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine and seduxene on cold tremor. Reduction of the thermoreceptors activity after phentolamine administration is primary, and may be considered as the leading factor in the cold tremor inhibition.", 
    "30": "The effect of neuroleptics (chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, haloperidol), antidepressants (amitryptyline, imipramine), tranquilizers (diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, benactyzine) and stimulant d-amphetamine on the domination and subordination relations formed as a result of competitive behaviour in a pair of rats was studied. The drugs in question proved to violate the set relations of domination and subordination weakening the attacking ability of dominating rats and strengthening the defensability of the subordinate ones. With increase of antidepressants dosage received by a subordinate rat its competing ability becomes enhanced too; this may cause a change in domination.", 
    "31": "With increasing amounts of electroinactive amitriptyline, each of the three chlordiazepoxide reduction waves shifted to more cathodic half-wave potentials and decreased in limiting current. The shift was most pronounced up the 1:1 mole ratio but continued up to ratios of 200:1. This behavior was observed in several supporting electrolytes and was not due to change in pH since this factor was maintained constant as the amitriptyline concentration was increased. Shifts in E1/2 and reductions in limiting current may arise in several ways, such as complex formation between the two drugs or adsorption of the amitriptyline onto the surface of the dropping mercury electrode hindering chlordiazepoxide reduction. Most data point to adsorption as the cause.", 
    "32": "Esterases hydrolyzing the racemic acetate ester of the centrally acting drug oxazepam in mice were examined. Radiolabeled ester administered intravenously was hydrolyzed rapidly in the liver, kidneys, and brain. The distribution of the enzyme activity of liver and brain subcellular fractions was measured. Kinetic data and structure investigation of partially hydrolyzed racemic ester pointed to the stereoselectivity of liver and brain esterases. The preferred hydrolysis of the (R)-(-)-isomer in liver homogenates was attributed mainly to microsomal enzymes, while that of the (S)-(+)-isomer in brain was considered to be due to the mitochondrial fraction. This phenomenon was a common property of all species tested.", 
    "33": "The applicability of a pharmacokinetic model for drug interactions by enzyme induction was tested by chronic dosing situation using carbamazepine (Tegretol) as the inducer and clonazepam (Clonopin) as the drug affected. Seven healthy subjects received one 1.0 mg clonazepam tablet once a day for 29 days and one 200 mg carbamazepine tablet once a day from days 8 to 29. Plasma levels of clonazepam were measured by electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography and those of carbamazepine and its epoxide metabolite by gas chromatographic-chemical ionization-mass spectrometry. Clonazepam plasma levels reached an initial steady-state by day 7 and declined to a lower steady-state over 5 to 15 days after additions of carbamazepine. The decrease in clonazepam levels ranged between 19% and 37%. Autoinduction of carbamazepine metabolism was also evident. Urinary excretion of D-glucaric acid increased 2- to 4-fold following carbamazepine administration (p less than 0.005). This increase provided additional evidence that the present interaction was due to enzyme induction. Experimental clonazepam levels were fitted to an induction pharmacokinetic model for multiple dosing with an exponentially increasing clearance. Induced half-lives of clonazepam (mean = 22.5 +/- 11.5 hr) were shorter (p less than 0.005) than control values (32.1 +/- 16.6 hr). Apparent enzyme(s) turnover half-lives ranged between 1 and 6 days.", 
    "34": "1 A double-blind randomized trial to compare the relative efficacy of the 1,5-benzodiazepine, clobazam, the 1,4-benzodiazepine nitrazepam, and placebo as hypnotics was carried out. 2 A preference technique was used and the analyses were performed sequentially. 3. The results confirmed that nitrazepam was superior to placebo as a hypnotic but failed to show that clobazam was superior to either placebo or nitrazepam in a ratio of 2:1. Thus, it seems likely that the hypnotic properties of clobazam are minimal. 4 Clobazam is not suitable for use as a hypnotic in hospitalized patients.", 
    "35": "There is an increased incidence of unwanted sedation associated with chlordiazepoxide usage in the elderly and in patients with liver disease. To determine whether pharmacokinetic alterations could account in part for these observations we studied the disposition and elimination of intravenously administered chlordiazepoxide in 27 healthy controls aged 16 to 86 years, 8 patients with cirrhosis, and 5 patients with acute viral hepatitis. Both increasing age and parenchymal liver disease led to similar changes in chlordiazepoxide pharmacokinetics. Over the age range 20 to 80 years, elimination half-life (t1/2(beta)) increased from 7 to 40 hr (r, 0.67; P less than 0.001) attributable to a decrease in plasma clearance from 30 ml per min to 10 ml per min (r, -0.71; P less than 0.001) and an increase in volume of distribution from 0.26 to 0.38 liters per kg (r, 0.60; P less than 0.05). Similarly, a decrease in plasma clearance in cirrhosis (7.7 +/- 2.1 compared to 15.3 +/- 4.4 ml per min, P less than 0.01) and acute viral hepatitis (6.1 +/- 4.3 compared to 18.1 +/- 7.1 ml per min, P less than 0.01) relative to age-matched controls and an increase in the volume of distribution resulted in a prolongation of the elimination half-life in both forms of liver disease. Impaired elimination of chlordiazepoxide may account in part for the increased incidence of oversedation seen in the elderly and in patients with liver disease.", 
    "36": "In order to study the interactions between serotonergic mechanism and electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic central gray substance, rats were trained to lever-press for terminating aversive electric stimuli applied at the Periaqueductal gray and adjoining tectum of the mesencephalon. Experimental sessions consisted of 40 discrete escape trials of a maximum of 30 sec duration, separated by 30 sec intervals. Dose-effect curves of two tryptamine antagonists, cyproheptadine and methysergide, as well as of the benzodiazepine minor tranquilizer, chlordiazepoxide, on average escape latencies and on frequency distribution of individual latencies were determined. Doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg of cyproheptadine decreased average latencies of escape responding in six of eight rats studied. Doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg of methysergide also facilitated escape responding in one of three rats. In contrast, doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide, that cause little sedation or ataxia, produced dose-dependent increases in escape latencies. Furthermore, doses of 5.6 and 10 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide partially blocked escape responding. The facilitatory effects of the tryptamine antagonists suggest that escape behavior is inhibited by brain tryptaminergic mechanisms, whereas the specific depressant effect of chlordiazepoxide on escape from Periaqueductal gray electrical stimulation suggest that this region may be involved in the antianxiety action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "37": "The author presents the results obtained with Faustan (diazepam) in the premedication of ambulatory stomatological interventions at a university clinic of stomatology. Experience was acquired in particular with intravenous premedication in a climical study involving 340 patients. The findings from this study and the experience with hundreds of ambulatory interventions in the past several years characterize Faustan, on condition of individual dosage, as a premedicant that is well suited for stomatological interventions, does not impair vital functions, increases the patients' willingness to co-operate and is of considerable anxiolytic activity. The use of Faustan is recommended for stomatological emergency situations and risk patients.", 
    "38": "The combination of continuous intravenous infusion of diazepam (20--40 mg/kg per day) and intragastric phenobarbitone (10--15 mg/kg per day in 4 divided doses) was used to treat 19 cases of neonatal tetanus. Mortality was 2/19 (11%). This regimen was considered to have reduced the mortality and the need for artificial ventilation. The main side effects encountered were severe drowsiness, coma, and apnoeic episodes which were reversible when the level of diazepam was reduced.", 
    "39": "The present study seeks to determine the extent to which a set of non-specific factors can stably predict response to either chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) or placebo (PBO) and the extent to which such prediction is specific to or distinctive for each treatment agent. For this purpose data were assembled for 447 primarily anxious neurotic outpatients treated with either CDZ or PBO in 4 week double blind drug trials performed over the past ten years and divided into two comparable subsamples for each treatment agent. A series of analyses revealed modest replicability but considerable drug specificity for a Global improvement measure. Replicability was considerable higher for a patient measure of Symptom Change, but its specificity to treatment agent was considerably less.", 
    "40": "Chlordiazepoxide was the first benzodiazepine derivative made available for clinical use. The metabolic pathway of chlordiazepoxide is complex, since the drug is biotransformed into a succession of pharmacologically active products: desmethylchlordiazepoxide, demoxepam, desmethyldiazepam, and oxazepam. The elimination half-life (tl/2beta) of chlordiazepoxide following single doses, in healthy individuals generally ranges from 5 to 30 hours, and the volume of distribution from 0.25 to 0.50 liters/kg. The hepatic extraction ratio is well under 5%. Elimination of the parent compound is mirrored by formation of the first active metabolite. Clearance of chlordiazepoxide is reduced and tl/2beta is prolonged in the elderly, in those with cirrhosis, and in those receiving concurrent disulfiram therapy. Oral chlordiazepoxide is rapidly and completely absorbed, but intramuscular injection is painful and results in slow and erratic absorption. Multiple-dose therapy with chlordiazepoxide results in accumulation of the parent compound, as well as two or more of its active metabolites. The rate and extent of accumulation varies considerably between individuals. A relation between plasma concentrations of chlordiazepoxide and its metabolites to clinical effects has been suggested in some studies and is currently under further investigation.", 
    "41": "Anthramycin, one of the pyrrolo(1,4)benzodiazepine antibiotics with potent antitumor activity, was tested for its effects on a number of genetic parameters. The results show that this antibiotic is nonmutagenic in the Ames strains of Salmonella typhimurium while mutagenic in only one and antimutagenic in the rest of the genes tested in the eukaryotic organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The antibiotic is, however, a potent recombinogen inasmuch as it induced mitotic crossing over, mitotic gene conversion, and possibly other chromosomal alterations in a diploid strain of S. cerevisiae. These studies emphasize the need for a battery of test systems including eukaryotic organisms to detect the genetic activity of certain antitumor drugs. The importance of considering data distinguishing between highly mutagenic and poorly mutagenic cancer chemotherapeutic agents is also discussed.", 
    "42": "A study of the solubility of Valium in commonly used intravenous solutions showed Valium to be equally insoluble in 5% dextrose in normal saline, 5% dextrose in water, normal saline, and Ringer's lactate. However, the precipitate which was formed became completely resuspended when mixed with as little as 39-42% plasma in vitro. This would indicate that the chalky precipitate seen in the I. V. tubing when Valium is injected into a running I. V. near the venipuncture site becomes resuspended when mixed with plasma in vivo. If one elects to inject Valium into the tubing of a running I. V., it is recommended that the drug be administered slowly to assure adequate mixing with blood plasma in order to prevent the circulation of particulate matter.Valium is currently one of the most popular drugs used in the psychosedative management of the apprehensive dental patient. Various techniques are advocated for its administration from direct injection into a vein to injection of the drug into a running I. V. However, the manufacturer states that the drug should not be added to I. V. fluids or other solutions or drugs. Presumably this is because of the formation of a cloudy precipitate immediately upon addition to aqueous solutions. Grower et al. have shown that saturated aqueous solutions of Valium in normal saline redissolve when added to plasma; however, they presented no data on the behavior of solutions of Valium added to other commonly used intravenous fluids. The present study was, therefore, undertaken to study the behavior of Valium when added to lactated Ringer's solution, 5% dextrose solutions, and normal saline; and to see how human blood plasma affects the solubility of Valium in these solutions.", 
    "43": "Benzodiazepines bind with high affinity to a specific benzodiazepine receptor, which occurs exclusively in the central nervous system. The affinity of various benzodiazepines to the receptor closely parallels their pharmacological and therapeutic potency. Binding to the receptor is stereospecific. The receptor is mainly localized in the synaptic membrane fraction and has its highest density in cortical areas of the brain. In Huntington's chorea a decrease in benzodiazepine receptor binding is found in caudate nucleus and putamen, which, at least in putamen, is due to a loss of benzodiazepine receptors apparently located on GABA neurones, which degenerate in Huntington's chorea. The loss of benzodiazepine receptors might explain why the ameliorative effects of benzodiazepines in the early stages of the disease are not sustained in the later stages.", 
    "44": "Two types of crude synaptic membranes have been prepared which differ in their kinetic properties to bind 3H-GABA in a Na+-free medium. One type (B) has one type of receptor (affinity or KD about 0.2 micrometer), the other type (A) has two populations of receptors which have a high (0.16 micrometer) and a low ((.02 micrometer) KD for GABA binding. This difference is due to the presence of a selective endogenous inhibitor of the high affinity receptor for GABA, a thermostable protein of about 15,000 molecular weight. Inhibitor action is counteracted by diazepam (7 X 10(-7) M), competitively. Clonazepam is more active but chlordiazepoxide is less active than diazepam. Two enantiomers of a benzodiazepine were studied. One of them is endowed with anxiolytic activity and nullifies the action of the endogenous inhibitor on high affinity GABA binding, the other is devoid of anxiolytic activity and is inactive against the inhibitor. The endogenous protein inhibitor also competitively blocks the high affinity binding of 3H-diazepam to Type A membranes. It is concluded that the endogenous inhibitor and diazepam act on the same receptor; and suggested that the endogenous inhibitor may be the natural ligand for the brain receptors that bind benzodiazepines with high affinity.", 
    "45": "After a brief review of the characteristic somatic and psychotropic effects of benzodiazepines evidence is presented which supports a specific facilitatory action of these drugs on GABA ergic synapses within the mammalian central nervous system. Benzodiazepines enhance presynaptic inhibition in the spinal cord and dorsal column nuclei as well as postsynaptic inhibition in dorsal column nuclei, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex, which are all examples of recurrent and collateral inhibition mediated by GABA ergic intrinsic neurones. In addition, the compounds also enhance the inhibitory effect of GABA ergic long projection neurones in the substantia nigra and the lateral vestibular nucleus of Deiters. Several problems remain to be solved, such as the exact site at which benzodiazepines initiate their action (pre-synaptically at GABA ergic nerve endings or postsynaptically at the target cells) and the possible existence of endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor. Some suspected implications which studies on benzodiazepine binding sites could have for a deeper understanding of the mode of action of these drugs are discussed.", 
    "46": "2-Amino-4-aryl-3H-1,5-benzodiazepines were prepared and evaluated for potential neuroleptic activity. Compound 60 showed some activity in the four assays; however, the activity was not consistently observed among other members of the series. The data reflected that the structural modifications led to a decrease in activity relative to clozapine. It was apparent that the 1,5-benzodiazepine portion of clozapine is not responsible for its antipsychotic activity.", 
    "47": "This paper describes a rapid and sensitive method for analysis of lorazepam and its glucuronide metabolite in plasma and urine following therapeutic doses of lorazepam in humans. After addition of the structurally related benzodiazepine derivative, oxazepam, as the internal standard, 1-ml samples of plasma or urine are extracted twice at neutral pH with benzene (containing 1.5% isoamyl alcohol). The combined extracts are evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and subjected to gas chromatographic analysis using a 3% OV-17 column and an electron-capture detector. Lorazepam glucuronide in urine is similarly analyzed following enzymatic cleavage with Glusulase. The sensitivity limits are 1--3 ng of analyzed following enzymatic cleavage with Glusulase. The sensitivity limits are 1--3 ng of lorazepam per ml of original sample, and the variability of identical samples is 5% or less. The applicability of the method to pharmacokinetic studies of lorazepam is demonstrated.", 
    "48": "Significant correlation in 11 different 1,4-benzodiazepinones has been established between log k2 (the second order rate constant for the reduction of the \"azepinones\" by sodium borohydride) and their ED50 against leptazol-induced seizures in mice. The results suggest a possible involvement of the carobnyl group at the receptor site.", 
    "49": "Ten healthy volunteers ingested single 15-mg doses of clorazepate dipotassium (CZP) with 60 ml of water, or with 60 ml of magnesium aluminum hydroxide (Maalox), on two occasions in a randomized, two-way crossover study. Plasma concentrations of desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) were determined in multiple samples drawn during 48 hr after each dose. Mean kinetic variables for DMDZ in CZP-water and CZP-magnesium aluminum hydroxide treatment conditions, respectively, were: peak measured concentration, 273 and 188 ng/ml (p 0.001); time of peak concentration, 1.8 and 2.8 hr after dose (p less than 0.01); apparent absorption half-life, 14.8 and 30.7 min (p less than 0.02); area under the 48-hr plasma concentration curve, 6,028 and 5,433 ng/ml X hr (p less than 0.02). Self-rated sensations of feedling \"spacey,\" \"thinking slowed down,\" and of generalized sedation, were reported with both treatment conditions, but these subjective effects occurred earlier and were more profound when CZP was taken with water as opposed to magnesium aluminum hydroxide. Thus administration of single doses of CZP with usual doses of a commonly prescribed antacid reduces the rate and extent of appearance in blood of DMDZ (the compound responsible for clinical activity) and attenuates self-rated clinical effects.", 
    "50": "N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was simultaneously administered with diazepam (DZP) or thiouracil (TU) once weekly for life to gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Additional DZP or TU treatment increased significantly average survival time and inhibited the development of cholangiocarcinomas, although cholangiomas were still observed in these groups. Tumor type and incidence in the nasal cavities were not influenced by DZP or TU. However, in comparison to DEN alone tumor latencies were prolonged.", 
    "51": "Comparison of two compounds being investigated should take into consideration the most comprehensive spectrum of all psychic variables affected. Consequently, besides 15 standardized investigational methods, three open methods, history, observation of behavior and in particular free exploration were used. The investigation was carried out in 18 ambulant patients who were given the preparations under investigation in a double-blind cross-over trial. Particular problems of the method were the interference of psychotherapeutic effect of the intensive exploration discussions on the action of the preparations, which could be controlled by comparison with a placebo phase, and the effects of learning and stereotype on repeated presentation."
