He is seeking a new physician for opioid and benzodiazepine refills, referrals for ongoing acupuncture and massage therapy, and completion of Veteran Affairs Canada (VAC) disability claim forms for his back. He was medically released at the rank of Petty Officer owing to knee impairment secondary to a fracture sustained aboard ship. He twice strained his back on deployments, but did not develop chronic low back pain until after leaving the Canadian Forces (CF). On release from the CF he completed comprehensive medical, psychosocial, and vocational rehabilitation in the VAC Rehabilitation Program for disability related to his knee impairment. Lately, chronic low back pain prevents him from continuing civilian employment and enjoying life.The physician takes the Veteran's history, performs appropriate physical examination and diagnostic investigations, and obtains previous medical records. The physician diagnoses chronic mechanic allow back pain and knee osteoarthritis, and is concerned about the Veteran's mental health. When the family physician tries to explore the mental health differential diagnosis, the Veteran initially becomes upset,but he responds to motivational interviewing. The physician books follow-up appointments to develop a therapeutic relationship with the Veteran and completes the VAC forms. With consent, the physician also sends a referral letter to the VAC district office, outlining the Veteran's health issues. The client is found to be eligible to re-enter the VAC Rehabilitation Program to manage disability related to his back pain. The Veteran is ultimately able to withdraw from chronic opiate and benzodiazepine medications and optimize his participation in life.", 
    "9": "Cynomolgus and rhesus macaques are frequently used in preclinical trials due to their close evolutionary relationships to humans. We conducted an initial screening for genetic variants in cynomolgus and rhesus macaque genes orthologous to human CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Genetic screening of 78 Indochinese and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques and 34 Chinese rhesus macaques revealed a combined total of 42 CYP3A4 genetic variants, including 12 nonsynonymous variants, and 34 CYP3A5 genetic variants, including nine nonsynonymous variants. Four of these nonsynonymous variants were located at substrate recognition sites or the heme-binding region, domains essential for protein function, including c.886G>A (V296M) and c.1310G>A (S437N) in CYP3A4 and c.1437C>G (N479K) and c.1310G>C (T437S) in CYP3A5. The mutant proteins of these genetic variants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Metabolic activity of these proteins measured using midazolam and nifedipine as substrates showed that none of these protein variants substantially influences the drug-metabolizing capacity of CYP3A4 or CYP3A5 protein. In Indonesian cynomolgus macaques, we also found IVS3+1delG in CYP3A4 and c.625A>T in CYP3A5, with which an intact protein cannot be produced due to a frameshift generated. Screening additional genomes revealed that two of 239 animals and three of 258 animals were heterozygous for IVS3+1delG of CYP3A4 and c.625A>T of CYP3A5, respectively. Some genetic variants were unevenly distributed between Indochinese and Indonesian cynomolgus macaques and between cynomolgus and rhesus macaques. Information on genetic diversity of macaque CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 presented here could be useful for successful drug metabolism studies conducted in macaques.",

    "18": "Anxious depression has been conceptualized in at least two related but separate ways: 1) major depressive disorder with at least one comorbid Axis I anxiety disorder and 2) major depressive disorder with a high level of anxiety with or without one or more comorbid Axis I anxiety disorders. Using either definition, patients with anxious depression seem to have a more chronic course of illness, an increased incidence of suicidal thoughts and behavior, greater functional and occupational impairment, and poorer response to treatment. Multiple classes of medications are used to treat anxious depression, most commonly first- and second-generation antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines. Certain patients with anxious depression may require lower starting doses, more gradual dose escalations, higher end point doses, longer duration of treatment, and/or early augmentation with other agents. Nonpharmacologic treatments such as targeted psychotherapy and preventative stepped-care approaches also may be effective. Well-conceived, randomized controlled treatment trials are necessary to make further gains in the management of patients with anxious depression.", 
    "19": "Long-term BZ (benzodiazepine) anxiolytic therapy increases the risk of physical dependence manifested as withdrawal anxiety. BZ-induced potentiation of GABA(A)R (gamma-aminobutyric acid type-A receptor) function by 1-week oral administration of FZP (flurazepam) bi-directionally modulates excitatory glutamatergic synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 neurons during drug withdrawal. Previous electrophysiological studies on acutely isolated and intact CA1 neurons, as well as immunofluorescence and post-embedding immunogold electron microscopy studies, suggest increased synaptic insertion of GluR (glutamate receptor) 2-lacking AMPARs (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptors) in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. Preliminary studies indicated a similar increase in GluR1, then phospho-Ser(831)-GluR1, as well as CaMKIIalpha (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIalpha), but not phospho-Thr(286)-CaMKII levels at the same time point. In our studies, whole-cell recordings in hippocampal slices revealed that AMPAR mEPSC [miniature EPSC (excitatory postsynaptic current)] amplitude was increased in 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats followed by an increase in estimated single-channel conductance in 2-day-FZP-withdrawn rats. Enhanced conductance was no longer observed in slices pre-incubated for 2 h in the CaMKII inhibitor KN-93, but not the inactive analogue KN-92. To evaluate whether CaMKII-mediated AMPA potentiation could occlude LTP (long-term potentiation), LTP was induced by TBS (theta burst stimulation) and recorded using whole-cell and extracellular techniques. LTP was induced in both groups, but only maintained for <15 min in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. LTP was fully restored after 7-day withdrawal. Despite the lack of LTP maintenance, impairment of object recognition, place and context was not observed in 2-day-FZP-withdrawn rats. Since L-VGCC (L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) current density was doubled on drug withdrawal and up to 2 days, Ca(2+) entry through L-VGCCs and perhaps subsequently through Ca(2+)-permeable AMPARs are proposed to be responsible for enhanced CaMKIIalpha levels and AMPAR potentiation. Mechanisms associated with several different models of activity-dependent plasticity may underlie BZ physical dependence.", 
    "20": "GABA(A)Rs [GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) type-A receptors] are heteropentameric chloride-selective ligand-gated ion channels that mediate fast inhibition in the brain and are key therapeutic targets for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids and general anaesthetics. In the brain, most of the benzodiazepine-sensitive synaptic receptor subtypes are assembled from alpha(1-3), beta(1-3) and gamma(2) subunits. Although it is evident that the pharmacological manipulation of GABA(A)R function can have profound effects on behaviour, the endogenous mechanisms that neurons use to promote sustained changes in the efficacy of neuronal inhibition remain to be documented. It is increasingly clear that GABA(A)Rs undergo significant rates of constitutive endocytosis and regulate recycling processes that can determine the efficacy of synaptic inhibition. Their endocytosis is regulated via the direct binding of specific endocytosis motifs within the intracellular domains of receptor beta(1-3) and gamma(2) subunits to the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 (adaptor protein 2). These binding motifs contain major sites of both serine and tyrosine phosphorylation within GABA(A)Rs. Their phosphorylation can have dramatic effects on binding to AP2. In the present review, we evaluate the role that these phospho-dependent interactions play in regulating the construction of inhibitory synapses, efficacy of neuronal inhibition and neuronal structure.", 
    "21": "Many membrane proteins, including the GABA(A) [GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) type A] receptors, are oligomers often built from different subunits. As an example, the major adult isoform of the GABA(A) receptor is a pentamer built from three different subunits. Theoretically, co-expression of three subunits may result in many different receptor pentamers. Subunit concatenation allows us to pre-define the relative arrangement of the subunits. This method may thus be used to study receptor architecture, but also the nature of binding sites. Indeed, it made possible the discovery of a novel benzodiazepine site. We use here subunit concatenation to study delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. We provide evidence for the formation of different functional subunit arrangements in recombinant alpha(1)beta(3)delta and alpha(6)beta(3)delta receptors. As with all valuable techniques, subunit concatenation has also some pitfalls. Most of these can be avoided by carefully titrating and minimizing the length of the linker sequences joining the two linked subunits and avoiding inclusion of the signal sequence of all but the N-terminal subunit of a multi-subunit construct. Maybe the most common error found in the literature is that low expression can be overcome by simply overloading the expression system with genetic information. As some concatenated constructs result by themselves in a low level of expression, this erroneous assembly leading to receptor function may be promoted by overloading the expression system and leads to wrong conclusions.", 
    "22": "A previous study comparing non-emotive mice from the strain C57BL/6/ByJ with ABP/Le mice showed ABP/Le to be more anxious in an open-field situation. In the present study, several compounds affecting anxiety were assayed on ABP/Le and C57BL/6/ByJ mice using three behavioural models of anxiety: the elevated plus-maze, the light-dark discrimination test and the free exploratory paradigm. The compounds used were the full benzodiazepine receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide, and the antagonist, flumazenil, the GABA(A) antagonist, bicuculline, the full 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT, and the mixed 5-HT(1A)/5-HT(1B) agonist, RU 24969. Results showed the effect of the compounds to be dependent on both the strain and the behavioural task. Several compounds found to be anxiolytic in ABP/Le mice had an anxiogenic effect on C57BL/6/ByJ mice. More behavioural changes were observed for ABP/Le in the elevated plus-maze, but the clearest findings for C57BL/6/ByJ mice were observed in the light-dark discrimination apparatus. These data demonstrate that anxious behaviour is a complex phenomenon which cannot be described by a single behavioural task nor by the action of a single compound.", 
    "23": "A large body of evidence suggests that antipsychotic drugs cause body weight gain and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and atypical (new generation) drugs appear to be most harmful.

Endogenous glucose production, whole body glucose disposal (by [6,6-(2)H(2)]glucose dilution), lipolysis (by [(2)H(5)]glycerol dilution), and substrate oxidation rates (by indirect calorimetry) were measured before and after intervention in basal and hyperinsulinemic condition.", 
    "25": "Olanzapine hampered insulin-mediated glucose disposal (by 1.3 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), whereas haloperidol did not have a significant effect. Endogenous glucose production was not affected by either drug. Also, the glycerol rate of appearance (a measure of lipolysis rate) was not affected by either drug. Olanzapine, but not haloperidol, blunted the insulin-induced decline of plasma free fatty acid and triglyceride concentrations. Fasting free fatty acid concentrations declined during olanzapine treatment, whereas they did not during treatment with haloperidol.",

Studying mixed depression was not a previous goal of the double-blind trial. Subjects in the trial were diagnosed according to DSM-IV and were randomly assigned to treatment during the period June 2000 to December 2001. Mixed depression was defined as the co-occurrence of a major depressive episode and > or = 2 manic/hypomanic symptoms (ie, > or = 2 Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] items scoring > or = 2). Response was defined as a > or = 50% reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score and < 2 concurrent manic/hypomanic symptoms.

The most frequent manic/ hypomanic symptoms of mixed depression were irritability, reduced need for sleep, talkativeness, and racing thoughts. Response rates in patients with nonmixed depression versus patients with mixed depression were the following: in the OFC arm, 48.9% versus 43.2% (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.51-2.98); in the olanzapine arm, 39.9% versus 26.6% (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.17-2.90); in the placebo arm, 27.5% versus 16.3% (OR = 1.94; 95% CI, 1.15-3.28). Response rates in the samples of patients with mixed depression were the following: OFC versus olanzapine, OR = 2.00 (95% CI, 0.96-4.19); OFC versus placebo, OR = 3.91 (95% CI, 1.80-8.49); olanzapine versus placebo, OR = 1.95 (95% CI, 1.14-3.34). It was found that no baseline manic/hypomanic symptom of mixed depression predicted treatment response. A higher number of baseline concurrent manic/hypomanic symptoms predicted a lower response rate in the olanzapine and placebo arms, but not in the OFC arm. The rates of switching were the following: in the OFC arm, 8.5%; in the olanzapine arm, 6.8%; and in the placebo arm, 7.9% (P = .808). The rates of dropouts in patients with mixed depression versus patients with nonmixed depression were not significantly different within any of the treatment arms.

Statistically, the efficacy of OFC was not significantly different from that of olanzapine, but inspection of the 95% CI showed a trend in favor of a possible superiority of OFC. Supporting the study findings are the similar efficacy of OFC in bipolar mixed depression independent of the number of concurrent manic/hypomanic symptoms, a lower dropout rate, and a similarly low switching rate compared to olanzapine. Contrary to other current limited evidence, an antidepressant (fluoxetine) showed efficacy and did not worsen bipolar mixed depression if combined with a mood-stabilizing agent (olanzapine).", 
    "31": "The effects of organic solvents, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and methanol, which are used to dissolve lipophilic test compounds and cytochrome P450 (P450) substrates, and carried into pre-incubation at 1% (v/v), on time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by diazepam, were evaluated using human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant human P450 expressed microsomes (rCYPs). The inactivation kinetics of CYP3A4 by diazepam dissolved in acetonitrile and methanol were almost equal with k(inact)/K(I) values, 0.095 and 0.15 min(-1) mM(-1) for HLM and 1.1 and 1.4 min(-1) mM(-1) for rCYP3A4, respectively. In contrast, the inactivation by diazepam dissolved in 1% DMSO significantly decreased and the kinetic parameter could not be calculated. The formation rate of nordiazepam and temazepam metabolized from diazepam dissolved in DMSO were approximately half of those using substrate dissolved in acetonitrile and methanol in both HLM and rCYP3A4. Dixon plots revealed that the metabolism of diazepam in rCYP3A4 were inhibited by DMSO in a competitive or mixed-type manner with K(i) (inhibition constant) values of 6 and 24 mM for nordiazepam and temazepam, respectively. In conclusion, the time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 by diazepam was attenuated by DMSO, while acetonitrile and methanol had no effect. The metabolite formation profile under the conditions tested suggested that DMSO competitively inhibit the formation of the reactive metabolites of diazepam by CYP3A4. The effect of organic solvents should be taken into consideration when evaluating the in vitro time-dependent inhibition of new chemical entities.", 
    "32": "Fast synaptic inhibition in the brain is largely mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABA(A)R). While the pharmacological manipulation of GABA(A)R function by therapeutic agents, such as benzodiazepines can have profound effects on neuronal excitation and behavior, the endogenous mechanisms neurons use to regulate the efficacy of synaptic inhibition and their impact on behavior remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we created a knock-in mouse in which tyrosine phosphorylation of the GABA(A)Rs gamma2 subunit, a posttranslational modification that is critical for their functional modulation, has been ablated. These animals exhibited enhanced GABA(A)R accumulation at postsynaptic inhibitory synaptic specializations on pyramidal neurons within the CA3 subdomain of the hippocampus, primarily due to aberrant trafficking within the endocytic pathway. This enhanced inhibition correlated with a specific deficit in spatial object recognition, a behavioral paradigm dependent upon CA3. Thus, phospho-dependent regulation of GABA(A)R function involving just two tyrosine residues in the gamma2 subunit provides an input-specific mechanism that not only regulates the efficacy of synaptic inhibition, but has behavioral consequences.",

The drugs involved may be benzodiazepines, hypnotics, other sedatives, anesthetics, drugs of abuse or ethanol. The detection of these agents in biologic fluids is difficult, since most of them are shortly acting, and provoke victim's amnesia which in turn leads the victim to report the allegation late. An unusual case-study of a 35-year-old, married woman who was admitted to the hospital with dizziness and loss of memory for a period of 10 days is here reported. The toxicological analysis of the victim's blood and urine for unknown sedative drugs, achieved by GC-MS, revealed the presence of zolpidem (Stilnox), a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. Concentration of zolpidem in blood, 11 hours after the last supposedly intake, was 47 microg/L. After family counseling at the hospital, the victim's husband confessed that he was replacing the contents of Losec capsules of his wife, with Stilnox tablets. This unjust act was committed by the husband in order for him to have sex with his wife, since she was not willing to participate in a sexual intercourse due to her religious restraints for a fasting period of 40 days. The aim of this article is 2-fold. First, to emphasize the fact that a sexual assault can take place not only between 2 strangers, but also within a happily married couple. Second, to remind doctors that any case of sexual assault must be examined toxicologically, for a better and thorough investigation.",

The present article provides a practical description of the characteristics of these compounds to indicate when, how and for how long a pharmacological approach should be used. In general, benzodiazepines are the drugs of choice in short-term treatments. SSRI are preferred in long-term treatments, whether for anxiety of depression, with the recommendation that treatment be maintained for at least 1 year.",

The socioeconomic costs of the present high level of long-term benzodiazepine use are considerable. These consequences could be minimised if prescriptions for long-term benzodiazepines were decreased. However, many physicians continue to prescribe benzodiazepines and patients wishing to withdraw receive little advice or support. Particular care should be taken in prescribing benzodiazepines for vulnerable patients such as elderly persons, pregnant women, children, alcohol- or drug-dependent patients and patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The following update gives recent research results on the withdrawal pathophysiology and practical information in order to treat or prevent benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.",

UK population time trade-off (TTO) tariffs were applied to the self-rated EQ-5D health states to calculate HRQL ratings (0 = death, 1 = best). An epoch analysis approach was used as a conceptual framework to analyze the longitudinal data. Follow-up was divided into epochs or periods of continuous treatment. When a patient changed antipsychotic treatment, he or she was considered to have a new observation. Multilevel models were employed to evaluate the association of HRQL with medication and other clinical and sociodemographic variables for each epoch.

Specifically, the role of a brain structure called \"reward circuit\" was emphasized. Therefore, the diagnosis criteria for abuse and dependence on drugs are presently defined mostly from a behavioral point of view: both in animal models and in clinical situations, it was stressed the importance of drug-seeking behavior and of the loss of control of the consumption. The occurrence of a pharmacological dependence is in fact of concern for only some of addictive drugs. According to these new criteria, dependence on benzodiazepines or antidepressants is certainly not frequent, even if withdrawal manifestations can occur after a long-term exposition.

We sought to examine the relative benefits of antidepressant-anxiolytic cotherapy versus antidepressant monotherapy for patients with anxious depression versus without anxious depression. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of an existing dataset (N=80), from a 3-week, randomized, double-blind trial which demonstrated cotherapy with fluoxetine and clonazepam to result in superior efficacy than fluoxetine monotherapy in MDD. The present analysis involved examining whether anxious depression status served as a predictor and moderator of symptom improvement. Anxious depression status was not found to predict symptom improvement, or serve as a moderator of clinical improvement to cotherapy versus monotherapy. However, the advantage in remission rates in favor of cotherapy versus monotherapy was, numerically, much larger for patients with anxious depression (32.2%) than it was for patients without anxious MDD (9.7%). The respective number needed to treat statistic for these two differences in response rates were, approximately, one in three for patients with anxious depression versus one in 10 for patients without anxious depression. The efficacy of fluoxetine-clonazepam cotherapy compared with fluoxetine monotherapy was numerically but not statistically enhanced for patients with anxious depression than those without anxious depression.",

Tri(dimethylamino)borane (TDMAB) rapidly and selectively derivatizes protonated N-oxides in a modified commercial linear quadrupole ion trap (LQIT) mass spectrometer to yield a distinct product ion (adduct-(CH(3))(2)NH). The LQIT was outfitted with an external reagent-mixing manifold that allows TDMAB to be mixed with the helium buffer gas used in the trap. The derivatized analytes are readily identified on the basis of a shift of 98 Th (Thomson) relative to the m/z value of the protonated analyte. Further probing of the derivatized analytes via isolation followed by CAD can be used to confirm the presence of an N-oxide, and distinguish between aliphatic and aromatic tertiary N-oxides. Since the ion-molecule reaction is fast, these experiments can be accomplished on the same time scale as typical CAD-based MS(n) experiments, thus maintaining the duty cycle of the instrument for this type of experiment. To demonstrate real world applicability, the method was tested on real active pharmaceutical ingredients and their derivatives.",

Although the effects of different drug classes on EEG spectra are already known, interactions between brain locations remain unclear. In this work, cross mutual information function and appropriate surrogate data were applied to assess linear and nonlinear couplings between EEG signals. The main goal was to evaluate the pharmacological effects of alprazolam on brain connectivity during wakefulness in healthy volunteers using a cross-over, placebo-controlled design. Eighty-five pairs of EEG leads were selected for the analysis, and connectivity was evaluated inside anterior, central, and posterior zones of the scalp. Connectivity between these zones and interhemispheric connectivity were also measured. Results showed that alprazolam induced significant changes in EEG connectivity in terms of information transfer in comparison with placebo. Trends were opposite depending on the statistical characteristics: decreases in linear connectivity and increases in nonlinear couplings. These effects were generally spread over the entire scalp. Linear changes were negatively correlated, and nonlinear changes were positively correlated with drug plasma concentrations; the latter showed higher correlation coefficients. The use of both linear and nonlinear approaches revealed the importance of assessing changes in EEG connectivity as this can provide interesting information about psychopharmacological effects.", 
    "63": "Theophylline-associated convulsions have been observed most frequently in children with fever, but the mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the basic mechanism of aminophylline [theophylline-2-ethylenediamine]-induced convulsions and the effects of Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia in mice. Diazepam (5-10mg/kg, i.p.), a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, significantly prolonged the onset and significantly decreased the incidence of convulsions induced by aminophylline (350 mg/kg, i.p.). However, the gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor agonist muscimol (1-4 mg/kg, i.p.), the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen (2-4 mg/kg, i.p.) and the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist dizocilpine (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to protect against the convulsions. 20% Brewer's yeast (0.02 ml/g, s.c.) increased body temperature by 1.03, and also significantly shortened the onset and significantly increased the incidence of convulsions induced by aminophylline. The anticonvulsant action of diazepam (2.5-10mg/kg, i.p.) on the convulsions induced by aminophylline was reduced by Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia. The proconvulsant actions of the GABAA receptor antagonists picrotoxin (3-4 mg/kg, i.p.) and pentylenetetrazol (40-60 mg/kg, i.p.) were enhanced by Brewer's yeast. These results suggest that the anticonvulsant action of diazepam against aminophylline is reduced by Brewer's yeast-induced pyrexia, and that GABAA receptors are involved in the aggravation of the convulsions by Brewer's yeast in mice.", 
    "64": "Previously, we have reported drastic strain differences of diazepam metabolism in the livers of a variety of rat strain. In this study, to characterize strain and sex differences of diazepam metabolism in the kidney, renal microsomal diazepam metabolic activities were determined in the Dark Agouti (DA), Sprague-Dawley (SD), Brown Norway (BN) and Wistar (WS) strains of rat. We found that the major pathway of diazepam metabolism in the kidney was diazepam N-demethylation, which is different from that in the liver, 3-hydroxylation. A Dose-course (12.5-200 muM of diazepam) study revealed that the DA and WS male rats had higher diazepam N-demethylation activity than the SD and BN rats. In contrast to the males, a lower activity of diazepam N-demethylation was observed in female BN rats. By Western blot analysis, constitutive protein expressions of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C11, which is responsible for diazepam N-demethylation, were detected in the 4 strain in both the male and female rats, and the BN rats had lower expression levels of CYP2C11 protein. However, we did not observe significant differences in the kinetic parameters of diazepam N-demethylation. Our results suggested that there was a strain difference in CYP-dependent diazepam N-demethylation in the rat kidney, which is different from the finding in liver microsomes.", 
    "65": "Interactions between coral reef topography, tide cycles, and photoperiod provided selection pressure for adaptive physiological changes in sheltered hypoxic niches to be exploited by specialized tropical reef fish. The epaulette shark Hemiscyllium ocellatum withstands cyclic hypoxia in its natural environment, many hours of experimental hypoxia, and anoxia for up to 5h. It shows neuronal hypometabolism in response to 5% oxygen saturation. Northern-hemisphere hypoxia- and anoxia-tolerant vertebrates that over-winter under ice alter their inhibitory to excitatory neurotransmitter balance to forestall brain ATP depletion in the absence of oxidative phosphorylation. GABA immunochemistry, HPLC analysis and receptor binding studies in H. ocellatum cerebellum revealed a heterogeneous regional accumulation of neuronal GABA despite no change in its overall concentration, and a significant increase in GABA(A) receptor density without altered binding affinity. Increased GABA(A) receptor density would protect the cerebellum during reoxygenation when transmitter release resumes. While all hypoxia- and anoxia-tolerant teleosts examined to date respond to low oxygen levels by elevating brain GABA, the phylogenetically older epaulette shark did not, suggesting that it uses an alternative neuroprotective mechanism for energy conservation. This may reflect an inherent phylogenetic difference, or represent a novel ecophysiological adaptation to cyclic variations in the availability of oxygen.",

    "70": "Our objective was to prospectively assess whether early (ie, 2 weeks) response to an antipsychotic predicts later (12-week) response and whether 'switching' early non-responders to another antipsychotic is a better strategy than 'staying'. This randomized, double-blind, flexible-dosed, 12-week study enrolled 628 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All initiated treatment with risperidone. Early response was defined as > or =20% improvement on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score following 2 weeks of treatment. Early responders (ERs) continued on risperidone, whereas early non-responders (ENRs) were randomized (1 : 1) to continue on risperidone 2-6 mg/day or switch to olanzapine 10-20 mg/day for 10 additional weeks. Compared with ENRs, risperidone ERs showed significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score (end point; p<001). Early response/non-response was highly predictive of subsequent clinical outcomes. Switching risperidone ENRs to olanzapine at week 2 resulted in a small but significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score (end point; p=0.020) and in depressive symptoms (end point; p=0.004); the reduction in PANSS was greater among those who were still moderately ill at 2 weeks. Switching risperidone ENRs to olanzapine also resulted in significantly greater increases in triglycerides, a significantly greater decrease in prolactin, and significantly less treatment-emergent dyskinesia. This is the first study to prospectively show that early response/non-response to an antipsychotic (risperidone) is a reliable clinical marker of subsequent clinical outcomes and that a 'switching' strategy based on this information may lead to greater clinical improvement than staying on a drug for a longer period in some patients.",

First, the inhibitory effects of FK1706 (preincubation dependence, inactivation rate estimation, and reversibility) were tested using human liver microsomes. Second, the effect of repeated oral doses of FK1706 (60 mg q.d. for 14 days) on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (single oral 2-mg dose) was tested in healthy volunteers. Finally, pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation were performed. In vitro experiments showed that FK1706 inhibited CYP3A4/5 in a time-dependent and irreversible manner. The in vitro maximum inactivation rate constant (k(inact)) and concentration of inhibitor that gave half-maximal k(inact) (K(I)) were estimated to be 10.1 h(-1) and 2050 ng/ml, respectively. In the clinical study, FK1706 produced a 2-fold increase in the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) of midazolam. A pharmacokinetic model developed for this study, which described the time course of concentrations of both FK1706 and midazolam and incorporated CYP3A4/5 inactivation in the liver and intestine, successfully predicted the change in the pharmacokinetics of midazolam using in vitro k(inact) and K(I) values (1.66- to 2.81-fold increases in AUC predicted) and estimated the in vivo inactivation rate to be 0.00404 to 0.0318 h(-1) x ml/ng. In conclusion, FK1706 weakly or moderately inhibited the activity of CYP3A4/5 in vitro and vivo at the tested dose. The model developed here would be helpful in predicting drug-drug interactions and in the design of dose regimens that avoid drug-drug interactions.",

While dexmedetomidine limited apoptosis to a greater extent than midazolam, both agents significantly reduced short-term mortality compared with saline. This study, in addition to those by others, suggests there are disparate immunomodulating effects between sedatives. Clinical studies are warranted to investigate whether these effects impact outcomes of septic patients. Perhaps one day the choice of sedative in septic patients will not be based solely on sedative properties but rather immunosedative profiles.",

As ASA status worsened, the likelihood of using etomidate or midazolam/ketamine increased (P = 0.001). We found no association between etomidate and dying in hospital, though our study might not have had sufficient power to show a difference between induction drugs. The relative risks [95% confidence interval (CI)] of dying in hospital were etomidate 1.16 (0.72-1.87), thiopental 0.82 (0.52-1.30), propofol 0.40 (0.11-1.49) and midazolam/ketamine 1.84 (1.09-3.12).

The phase-solubility profiles with both cyclodextrins were classified as AP-type, indicating the formation of 2:1 stoichiometric inclusion complexes. Gibbs free energy (DeltaG(tr)(degree)) values were all negative, indicating the spontaneous nature of clonazepam solubilization, and they decreased with increase in the cyclodextrins concentration, demonstrating that the reaction conditions became more favorable as the concentration of cyclodextrins increased. Complexes of clonazepam were prepared with cyclodextrins by various methods such as kneading, coevaporation, and physical mixing. The complexes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry studies. These studies indicated that complex prepared kneading and coevaporation methods showed successful inclusion of the clonazepam molecule into the cyclodextrins cavity. The complexation resulted in a marked improvement in the solubility and wettability of clonazepam. Among all the samples, complex prepared with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin by kneading method showed highest improvement in in vitro dissolution rate of clonazepam. Mean dissolution time of clonazepam decreased significantly after preparation of complexes and physical mixture of clonazepam with cyclodextrins. Similarity factor indicated significant difference between the release profiles of clonazepam from complexes and physical mixture and from plain clonazepam. Tablets containing complexes prepared with cyclodextrins showed significant improvement in the release profile of clonazepam as compared to tablet containing clonazepam without cyclodextrins.", 
    "83": "The prediction of clinical drug-drug interactions (DDIs) due to mechanism-based inhibitors of CYP3A is complicated when the inhibitor itself is metabolized by CYP3Aas in the case of clarithromycin. Previous attempts to predict the effects of clarithromycin on CYP3A substrates, e.g., midazolam, failed to account for nonlinear metabolism of clarithromycin. A semiphysiologically based pharmacokinetic model was developed for clarithromycin and midazolam metabolism, incorporating hepatic and intestinal metabolism by CYP3A and non-CYP3A mechanisms. CYP3A inactivation by clarithromycin occurred at both sites. K(I) and k(inact) values for clarithromycin obtained from in vitro sources were unable to accurately predict the clinical effect of clarithromycin on CYP3A activity. An iterative approach determined the optimum values to predict in vivo effects of clarithromycin on midazolam to be 5.3 microM for K(i) and 0.4 and 4 h(-1) for k(inact) in the liver and intestines, respectively. The incorporation of CYP3A-dependent metabolism of clarithromycin enabled prediction of its nonlinear pharmacokinetics. The predicted 2.6-fold change in intravenous midazolam area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) after 500 mg of clarithromycin orally twice daily was consistent with clinical observations. Although the mean predicted 5.3-fold change in the AUC of oral midazolam was lower than mean observed values, it was within the range of observations. Intestinal CYP3A activity was less sensitive to changes in K(I), k(inact), and CYP3A half-life than hepatic CYP3A. This semiphysiologically based pharmacokinetic model incorporating CYP3A inactivation in the intestine and liver accurately predicts the nonlinear pharmacokinetics of clarithromycin and the DDI observed between clarithromycin and midazolam. Furthermore, this model framework can be applied to other mechanism-based inhibitors.", 
    "84": "The objectives of the present study were to investigate the formation and rate of hydrolysis of ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) in BMS-214662 mesylate drug substance and parenteral formulation by a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric (GC/MS) method. EMS levels in the drug substance ranged between 0.3 microg/g and 0.8 microg/g. The parenteral formulation contains ethanol and the reaction between residual free methane sulphonic acid and ethanol may lead to the formation of EMS. Given that EMS is a potent mutagen, it is therefore of vital importance to eliminate or reduce the risk of human exposure. Data indicate no significant increase in the levels of EMS following storage of the drug product for 18 weeks at 25 degrees C or six weeks at 60 degrees C indicating that the potential reaction between ethanol and free methane sulphonic acid may not occur in the BMS-214662 formulation under the storage conditions evaluated and therefore causes no plausible safety concerns of EMS exposure in humans. Kinetic studies were conducted by spiking 200 ppb of EMS into water and the diluted and undiluted parenteral formulation. The rates of hydrolysis of EMS at 25 degrees C followed pseudo-first order kinetics and were determined to be 2.35 x 10(-4)min(-1), 67.4 x 10(-4)min(-1), and 1.32 x 10(-4)min(-1) in water, undiluted, and diluted drug product, respectively.",

Benzodiazepines and antipsychotics were dispensed to 17.3% and 15.8%, respectively. For MS medicines, 804 were prescribed for 48.1% (64/133) of veterans. Nearly one-fourth (24.8%) were treated with skeletal muscle relaxants. The CNS and MS medications, in general, were continuously prescribed over the 12-month study period. This study provides insight into the complex medical management involved in the care of veterans with BRIs.",

He settled following IV benzodiazepines and supportive care, and was discharged with no evidence of long-term sequelae. Analysis of the white powder by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), ultraviolet/visible spectrophotometry (UV/VIS) and thin layer chromatography (TLC) showed the presence of Bromo-dragonFLY (1-(8-bromobenzo[1,2-b;4,5-b']difuran-4-yl)-2-aminopropane); serum analysis by GC/MS and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) confirmed that a combination of Bromo-dragonFLY (0.95 ng/mL), ketamine (20 ng/mL) and cannabis had been used by the patient. No other recreational drugs were detected in an extensive toxicological screen of serum and urine samples.",

He believed he was being followed by the police while walking his daughter to school in the morning and swallowed the \"8-ball of meth,\" which is known to be one-eighth of an ounce or the equivalent of about 3 g. The following autopsy specimens were analyzed for the presence of methamphetamine and amphetamine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry: femoral blood, urine, bile, vitreous fluid, brain, liver, and gastric contents. Blood drawn at the hospital approximately 12 h after ingestion was also analyzed. The methamphetamine concentration in the hospital blood was 3.0 mg/L, and the concentration in the femoral blood from autopsy was 30 mg/L. Other drugs confirmed included tramadol, lorazepam, and 11-carboxy-Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol. The pathologist ruled the cause of death to be cardiac dysrhythmia due to excited delirium as a result of methamphetamine drug effects. Discussion of the timeline from ingestion to death and the clinical presentation of the decedent are included.", 
    "99": "We investigated the excretion profiles of flunitrazepam metabolites in urine after a single dose. Sixteen volunteers received either 0.5 or 2.0 mg flunitrazepam. Urine samples were collected after 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 240, and 336 h. Samples were screened using CEDIA (300 microg/L cutoff) and quantitated using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The cutoff was 0.5 microg/L for flunitrazepam, N-desmethylflunitrazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, 7-aminodesmethylflunitrazepam, 7-acetamidoflunitrazepam, and 7-acetamidodesmethylflunitrazepam. None of the subjects receiving 0.5 mg were screened positive, and only 23 of 102 samples from the subjects given 2.0 mg were positive with CEDIA. The predominant metabolites were 7-aminoflunitrazepam and 7-aminodesmethylflunitrazepam. For all subjects given the low dose, 7-aminoflunitrazepam was detected up to 120 h, and for two subjects for more than 240 h. Seven subjects given the high dose were positive up to 240 h for 7-aminoflunitrazepam. We conclude that the ratio 7-aminodesmethylflunitrazepam to 7-aminoflunitrazepam increased with time, independent of dose, and may be used to estimate the time of intake. For some low-dose subjects, the metabolite concentrations in the early samples were low and a chromatographic method may fail to detect the intake. We think laboratories should consider this when advising police and hospitals about sampling as well as when they set up strategies for analysis.", 
    "100": "Sleep disorders are common conditions that affect about 40 million people in the U.S every year, the most common of which is insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty falling or staying asleep. Zolpidem (Ambien) is a non-benzodiazepine prescription drug that is used to treat insomnia and is often preferred over the commonly used benzodiazepines due to a lesser side effect profile. This is because the non-benzodiazepine binding is more selective to GABA-A receptors versus the non-selective binding of benzodiazepines. With the increasing popularity of non-benzodiazepines, drug abuse and driving-while-impaired cases involving sleep-inducing drugs have risen. Therefore, a highly sensitive and rapid homogeneous immunoassay (EMIT-type assay) has been developed for the detection of zolpidem in urine. The zolpidem antibody is highly specific and does not cross-react with other newer sleep aids such as zopiclone and zaleplon. This assay has a detection limit of 5 ng/mL for zolpidem in urine. Further evaluation of this assay using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) analysis of authentic urine samples demonstrated that the accuracy of the assay is greater than 90%. Because this assay is designed to measure the non-conjugated drug in urine, it resulted in simplification for gas chromatography-MS or LC-MS-MS confirmation methods that do not require urine hydrolysis before solid-phase extraction or liquid-liquid extraction.",

    "105": "The effect of valproate on the steady-state plasma concentrations of olanzapine was investigated in 18 patients with bipolar or schizoaffective disorder. Additional valproate, at a dose ranging from 600 to 2000 mg/d, was administered for 4 weeks to patients stabilized on olanzapine (5-20 mg/d). During valproate coadministration, mean plasma olanzapine concentrations decreased significantly from 32.9 +/- 9.7 ng/mL at baseline to 27.4 +/- 9.8 ng/mL at week 2 (P = 0.02), and to 26.9 +/- 9.2 ng/mL at week 4 (P = 0.001). Smoking also decreased plasma olanzapine concentrations. Valproate coadministration with olanzapine was well tolerated and no patient showed a worsening of his or her psychopathological condition. These findings indicate that valproate, at doses of up to 2000 mg/d, is associated with a minimal, presumably not clinically significant, decrease in plasma olanzapine concentrations, possibly as a result of induction of olanzapine metabolism. New studies are needed to confirm that valproate could have mild inductive effects.",

Moreover, targeting of dendrimers to the mitochondria in cells has not yet been reported. Previously, we have delivered small molecule imaging agents into glioma and breast cancer cells by targeting the translocator protein (TSPO; formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor or PBR) with a family of high-affinity conjugable ligands. The 18 kDa multimeric TSPO is expressed in steroid-producing cells, primarily on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This protein is a prime candidate for molecular targeting because tumors and other disease-related cells contain high densities of TSPO.

However, the long-term effects of exposure to therapeutic, psychotropic drugs have only recently begun to be appreciated. Antipsychotic drugs are little studied in this regard. Here, we quantitatively analyzed dendritic architecture in adult mice treated with paradigmatic typical- (haloperidol) or atypical (olanzapine) antipsychotic drugs at developmental stages corresponding to fetal or fetal plus early childhood stages in humans. In layer 3 pyramidal cells of the medial and orbital prefrontal cortices and the parietal cortex and in spiny neurons of the core of the nucleus accumbens, both drugs induced significant changes (predominantly reductions) in the amount and complexity of dendritic arbor and the density of dendritic spines. The drug-induced plasticity of dendritic architecture suggests changes in patterns of neuronal connectivity in multiple brain regions that are likely to be functionally significant.",

Based on the increased use of pyrethroids and recent studies showing that pregnant women and children are exposed to pyrethroids, there are concerns over the potential for developmental neurotoxicity. However, there have been relatively few studies on the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. In this study, we sought to investigate the developmental toxicity of six common pyrethroids, three type I compounds (permethrin, resmethrin, and bifenthrin) and three type II compounds (deltamethrin, cypermethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin), and to determine whether zebrafish embryos may be an appropriate model for studying the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroids. Exposure of zebrafish embryos to pyrethroids caused a dose-dependent increase in mortality and pericardial edema, with type II compounds being the most potent. At doses approaching the LC(50), permethrin and deltamethrin caused craniofacial abnormalities. These findings are consistent with mammalian studies demonstrating that pyrethroids are mildly teratogenic at very high doses. However, at lower doses, body axis curvature and spasms were observed, which were reminiscent of the classic syndromes observed with pyrethroid toxicity. Treatment with diazepam ameliorated the spasms, while treatment with the sodium channel antagonist MS-222 ameliorated both spasms and body curvature, suggesting that pyrethroid-induced neurotoxicity is similar in zebrafish and mammals. Taken in concert, these data suggest that zebrafish may be an appropriate alternative model to study the mechanism(s) responsible for the developmental neurotoxicity of pyrethroid insecticides and aid in identification of compounds that should be further tested in mammalian systems.", 
    "127": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a putative receptor in Leydig cells, modulates steroidogenesis. Since benzodiazepines are commonly used in regional anesthesia, their peripheral effects need to be defined. Therefore, this study set out to investigate in vitro effects of the benzodiazepine midazolam (MDZ) on Leydig cell steroidogenesis, and the possible underlying mechanisms. The effects of MDZ on steroidogenesis in primary mouse Leydig cells and MA-10 Leydig tumor cells were determined by radioimmunoassay. PBR, P450scc, 3beta-HSD and StAR protein expression induced by MDZ was determined by Western blotting. Inhibitors of the signal transduction pathway and a MDZ antagonist were used to investigate the intracellular cascades activated by MDZ. In both cell types, MDZ-stimulated steroidogenesis in dose- and time-dependent manners, and induced the expression of PBR and StAR proteins, but had no effect on P450scc and 3beta-HSD expressions. Moreover, H89 (PKA inhibitor) and GF109203X (PKC inhibitor) attenuated MDZ-stimulated steroid production. Interestingly, the MDZ antagonist (flumazenil) did not decrease MDZ-induced steroid production in both cell types. These results highly indicated that MDZ-induced steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells via PKA and PKC pathways, along with the expression of PBR and StAR proteins. In addition, MDZ at high dosages induced rounding-up, membrane blebbing, and then death in MA-10 cells. In conclusion, midazolam could induce Leydig tumor cell steroidogenesis, and high dose of midazolam could induce apoptosis in Leydig tumor cells.",

These conditions include the advanced age of the driver, initial dosing and start-up of the antidepressant, rapid escalation of antidepressant doses, high-dose antidepressants, presence of active and severe depressive symptoms (i.e., the antidepressant is merely functioning as a pharmacological marker for severe depressive illness), and/or coadministration of other psychotropic medications, especially benzodiazepines.

The frequency and type of intraoperative and postoperative complications of sevoflurane-fentanyl versus midazolam-fentanyl anesthesia were compared in 140 consecutive children (aged 3 months to 10 years) undergoing cleft lip and palate repair. Midazolam-fentanyl anesthesia was induced with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg), fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg) and vecuronium (0.1mg/kg), and maintained with the same agents according to the defined parametars. Sevoflurane-fentanyl anesthesia was induced and maintained with sevoflurane (5-8 vol% and 0.8-1 vol%, respectively) in an oxygen/air mixture and supplemented with fentanyl (0.005 mg/kg). Both groups were comparable in basic demographic data, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters. Difficult intubation occurred in 6 of 76 children (midazolam-fentanyl group) and 4 of 64 children (sevoflurane-fentanyl group) (P=0.754). Ventricular extrasystole and bronchospasm occurred in one patient each in the sevoflurane-fentanyl group. Postoperatively, emergence agitation was observed in the sevoflurane-fentanyl group (17 cases; P<0.001); postoperative nausea and vomiting occurred in 2 children (midazolam-fentanyl group) and 3 children (sevoflurane-fentanyl group) (P=0.660).

    "134": "The different concepts treating of \"residual curarization\" were presented according to two directions: the analysis of their contents--epidemiologic, clinical, instrumental--and the description of the pharyngeal striated muscles functions in these contexts. It appears that certain, too marked, \"residual curarization\" levels remain a well-evidenced factor increasing some morbidities in numerous clinical situations. All the methods of instrumental monitoring of the level of curarization--mecanography, electromyography, accelerometry--appeared useful to document the levels of \"residual curarization\" before patient's extubation or awakening. Today, for our speciality, it became particularly clear that: neither the selected muscle-- adductor pollicis--, neither the test currently privileged--train-of-four 2Hz--, nor the thresholds currently selected--0.90 or 1.00--did not constitute the unavoidable proof of a \"residual curarization\" complete absence. For the healthy volunteer receiving a curare, a train of four of the adductor pollicis greater than 0.90 can exist in presence of spirometric alterations evidencing the lack of adequate pharyngeal dilatation. In daily routine, the pharyngeal control is already disturbed by numerous molecules including: benzodiazepines, halogenated vapours, propofol, i.e. even under non-hypnotic concentrations. Faced to such evidences, our medical speciality will, undoubtedly, have to acquire new knowledge to develop muscle relaxant management control processes eliminating the surmorbidities related to \"residual curarization\". These tests must be validated also to exclude morbidity-prone dysfunctions of the pharyngeal striated muscles. Considering this new paradigm would be a major safety evolution for our speciality.",

The present study evaluated the discriminative stimulus effects of L-838,417 in order to determine the extent to which the alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors contribute to the interoceptive effects of BZ-type drugs. Squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) were trained to discriminate L-838,417 (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) from vehicle under a 5-response fixed-ratio schedule of food reinforcement. Under test conditions, L-838,417 administration resulted in dose-dependent increases in drug-lever responding that were antagonized by the BZ-site antagonist, flumazenil. Administration of non-selective BZs, compounds with 10-fold greater affinity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors compared to alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors, barbiturates and ethanol (which modulate the GABA(A) receptor via a non-BZ site), all resulted in a majority of responses on the L-838,417-paired lever (65-100% drug-lever responding). betaCCT, an antagonist that binds with 20-fold greater affinity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors relative to alpha2, alpha3, and alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors, had no significant effect on the discriminative stimulus effects of L-838,417 or the L-838,417-like effects of diazepam or zolpidem. These data suggest that efficacy at alpha2, alpha3, and/or alpha5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors likely are sufficient for engendering BZ-like discriminative stimulus effects.",

The authors investigated the efficacy of GYKI 52466, a 2,3-benzodiazepine that is a selective and potent alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-proprionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist, in a rat femoral artery vasospasm model.", 
    "137": "Twenty-seven Wistar albino rats were used in this study. The animals were divided into 3 groups of 9 animals each: sham-operated control (group 1), vasospasm group (group 2), and vasospasm-plus-treatment group (group 3). In groups 2 and 3, autologous blood (0.1 mL) was applied to a 1-cm segment of the femoral artery, which was then wrapped with a silicone cuff. One minute after blood application, the rats in group 3 received an intraperitoneal injection of 15 mg/kg GYKI 52466 every 12 h for 24 h. Responses to blood application and treatment were evaluated with light and electron microscopy examinations of femoral artery specimens at 72 h.", 
    "138": "On light microscope examination, the mean diameters of the arterial lumens in groups 1, 2, and 3 were 514.47+/-15.3, 317.63+/-12.1, and 503.91+/-9.6 microm, respectively. At 24 h, the mean arterial wall thickness in group 1 was 77.69+/-4.2 microm. This mean thickness in group 2 increased to 164.82+/-9.1 microm. After GYKI treatment in group 3, the mean arterial wall thickness measured 95.37+/-5.3 microm. In group 2 rats, electron microscopy demonstrated various changes including marked luminal narrowing and increased wall thickness in the femoral arterial wall. The most striking finding were the degenerative changes in the endothelium, which presented as a corrugated appearance of the internal elastic lamina. Rats in group 3 had endothelia that were slightly constricted and smooth muscle cells that were relaxed; changes in the vessel wall and internal elastic lamina were less prominent in these rats than in the rats of group 2.", 
    "139": "The results of the present study suggest that GYKI 52466 inhibited AMPA receptors and induced relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the wall of the femoral artery in a rat model. This substance may be a protective and therapeutic agent in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm.", 
    "140": "Olanzapine is described as a multi-acting receptor-targeted antipsychotic agent. Although regional differences of dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy, i.e., limbic selectivity, were reported for olanzapine, contradictory results were also reported. We measured dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy of olanzapine in extrastriatal regions in patients with schizophrenia using positron-emission tomography with [(11)C]FLB457 and the plasma concentrations of olanzapine. Ten patients with schizophrenia taking 5-20 mg/day of olanzapine participated. Dopamine D(2) receptor occupancy in the temporal cortex ranged from 61.1 to 85.8%, and plasma concentration was from 12.7 to 115.4 ng/ml. The ED(50) value was 3.4 mg/day for dose and 10.5 ng/ml for plasma concentration. The ED(50) values obtained in this study were quite similar to those previously reported in the striatum. In conclusion, although the subjects and methods were different from previous striatal occupancy studies, these results suggest that limbic occupancy by olanzapine may not be so different from that in the striatum.", 
    "141": "We aimed to determine the effect of carbon ion irradiation on the uptake of N-benzyl-N-11C-methyl-2-(7-methyl-8-oxo-2-phenyl-7,8-dihydro-9H-purin-9-yl)acetamide ([(11)C]DAC), a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), in tumor cells and tumor-bearing mice. Spontaneous murine fibrosarcoma (NFSa) cells were implanted into the right hind legs of syngeneic C3H male mice. Conditioning irradiation with 290 MeV/u carbon ions was delivered to the 7- to 8-mm tumors In vitro uptake of [(11)C]DAC was measured in single NFSa cells isolated from NFSa-bearing mice after irradiation. In vivo biodistribution of [(11)C]DAC in NFSa-bearing mice was determined by small animal PET scanning and dissection. In vitro autoradiography was performed using tumor sections prepared from mice after PET scanning. In vitro and in vivo uptake of [(11)C]DAC in single NFSa cells and NFSa-bearing mice was significantly reduced by carbon ion irradiation. The decrease in [(11)C]DAC uptake in the tumor sections was mainly due to the change in PBR expression. In conclusion, [(11)C]DAC PET responded to the change in PBR expression in tumors caused by carbon ion irradiation in this study. Thus, [(11)C]DAC is a promising predictor for evaluating the effect of carbon ion radiotherapy.", 
    "142": "The actions of benzodiazepines were studied on the responses to GABA of the fast coxal depressor (D(f)) motor neurone of the cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Ro5-4864, diazepam and clonazepam were investigated. Responses to GABA receptors were enhanced by both Ro5-4864 and diazepam, whereas clonazepam, a potent-positive allosteric modulator of human GABA(A) receptors, was ineffective on the native insect GABA receptors of the D(f) motor neurone. Thus, clear pharmacological differences exist between insect and mammalian native GABA-gated chloride channels with respect to the actions of benzodiazepines. The results enhance our understanding of invertebrate GABA-gated chloride channels which have recently proved important in (a) comparative studies aimed at identifying human allosteric drug-binding sites and (b) understanding the actions of compounds used to control ectoparasites and insect crop pests.", 
    "143": "The GABA(A) receptor mutation gamma(2)R43Q causes absence epilepsy in humans. Homology modeling suggests that gamma(2)Arg43, gamma(2)Glu178, and beta(2)Arg117 participate in a salt-bridge network linking the gamma(2) and beta(2) subunits. Here we show that several mutations at these locations exert similar long-distance effects on other intersubunit interfaces involved in GABA and benzodiazepine binding. These mutations alter GABA-evoked receptor kinetics by slowing deactivation, enhancing desensitization, or both. Kinetic modeling and nonstationary noise analysis for gamma(2)R43Q reveal that these effects are due to slowed GABA unbinding and slowed recovery from desensitization. Both gamma(2)R43Q and beta(2)R117K also speed diazepam dissociation from the receptor's benzodiazepine binding interface, as assayed by the rate of decay of diazepam-induced potentiation of GABA-evoked currents. These data demonstrate that gamma(2)Arg43 and beta(2)Arg117 similarly regulate the stability of both the GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites at the distant beta/alpha and alpha/gamma intersubunit interfaces, respectively. A simple explanation for these results is that gamma(2)Arg43 and beta(2)Arg117 participate in interactions between the gamma(2) and beta(2) subunits, disruptions of which alter the neighboring intersubunit binding sites in a similar fashion. In addition, gamma(2)Arg43 and gamma(2)Glu178 regulate desensitization, probably mediated within the transmembrane domains near the pore. Therefore, mutations at the gamma/beta intersubunit interface have specific long-distance effects that are propagated widely throughout the GABA(A) receptor protein.", 
    "144": "Homeostatic regulation of synaptic strength in response to persistent changes of neuronal activity plays an important role in maintaining the overall level of circuit activity within a normal range. Absence of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) for a few hours is known to cause upregulation of excitatory synaptic strength, suggesting that mEPSCs contribute to the maintenance of excitatory synaptic functions. In the present study, we found that the absence of mEPSCs for 1-3 h also resulted in homeostatic suppression of presynaptic functions of inhibitory synapses in acute cortical slices from juvenile rats, as suggested by the reduced frequency (but not amplitude) of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) as well as the reduced amplitude of IPSCs. This homeostatic regulation depended on endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling, because blockade of either the activation of cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs) or the synthesis of its endogenous ligand 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) abolished the suppression of inhibitory synapses caused by the absence of mEPSCs. Blockade of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-I) also abolished the suppression of inhibitory synapses, consistent with the mGluR-I requirement for eCB synthesis and release in cortical synapses. Furthermore, this homeostatic regulation also required eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (eEF2)-dependent protein synthesis, but not gene transcription. Activation of eEF2 alone was sufficient to suppress the mIPSC frequency, an effect abolished by inhibiting CB1Rs. Thus, mEPSCs contribute to the maintenance of inhibitory synaptic function and the absence of mEPSCs results in presynaptic suppression of inhibitory synapses via protein synthesis-dependent elevation of eCB signaling.", 
    "145": "Lorazepam is a widely used anxiolytic drug of the benzodiazepine class. The clinical actions of benzodiazepines are thought to be mediated via specific allosteric benzodiazepine binding sites and enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission in the brain. However, the indirect effects of benzodiazepines on other neurotransmitter systems have not been extensively studied. Previous experimental evidence suggests that benzodiazepines inhibit striatal dopamine release by enhancing the GABAergic inhibitory effect on dopamine neurons whereas very little is known about cortical or thalamic gamma-amino-butyric (GABA)-dopamine interactions during benzodiazepine administration. We explored the effects of lorazepam (a single 2.5 mg dose) on cortical and thalamic D(2/3) receptor binding using Positron-Emission Tomography (PET) and the high-affinity D(2/3)-receptor ligand [(11)C]FLB 457 in 12 healthy male volunteers. We used a randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study design. Dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor binding potential was measured with the reference tissue method in several extrastriatal D(2)-receptor areas including frontal, parietal, temporal cortices and thalamus. The main subjective effect of lorazepam was sedation. Lorazepam induced a statistically significant decrease of D(2)/D(3) receptor BP(ND) in medial temporal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that was also confirmed by a voxel-level analysis. The sedative effect of lorazepam was associated with a decrease in D(2)/D(3) receptor BP(ND) in the DLPFC. In conclusion, lorazepam decreased [(11)C]FLB 457 binding in frontal and temporal cortex, suggesting that cortical GABA-dopamine interaction may be involved in the central actions of lorazepam in healthy volunteers. The correlation between lorazepam-induced sedation and D(2)/D(3) receptor binding potential (BP) change further supports this hypothesis.", 
    "146": "In this retrospective study of institutionalized patients with mental retardation, we present the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with intrarectal diazepam (IRD) gel (Diastat) and intravenous levetiracetam (IVL) in comparison with either treatment alone for acute repetitive or prolonged seizures (ARPS). We defined ARPS as >or=3 seizures of any type within 1 h or a single seizure of any type lasting >or=3 min. Eighty-eight ARPS episodes were treated in 25 patients (14 female, age 21-72 years), with mainly symptomatic generalized epilepsy. There were no adverse events directly attributable to the administration of IRD or IVL. Seizure recurrence within 4 h of treatment, the primary outcome measure, was significantly lower after combined sequential IRD + IVL treatment (3 of 36) compared to IRD alone (6 of 24, p = 0.048) or IVL alone (10 of 28, p = 0.039). There was no statistically significant difference between the individual IRD and IVL treatments (p = 0.604). The estimated odds ratio (OR) indicated that the risk of seizure recurrence was higher after IRD or IVL monotherapy compared to combined IRD + IVL treatment. Subsequent emergency room (ER) transfers following seizure recurrence were least likely after IVL treatment (10%) compared to combined IRD + IVL (67%) or IRD (83%) treatment. These findings suggest that although IRD or IVL monotherapy is efficacious, the combination is superior in controlling ARPS in this special group of institutionalized patients. In addition, we speculate that a more reliable onset of action after IVL treatment results in rapid seizure control and fewer ER transfers, despite seizure recurrence.", 
    "147": "Pharmacokinetic analyses of three kinds of benzodiazepines--midazolam (MDZ), triazolam (TRZ) and alprezolam (APZ)--were performed in rats with cannulated portal and jugular veins. Each drug was administered to the double-cannulated rats, and pharmacokinetic data for the parent drugs and their 1'- and 4-hydroxylated metabolites were compared with those obtained in non-cannulated mice. In bioavailability, the drugs ranked APZ > TRZ = MDZ in rats, and APZ > TRZ > MDZ in mice, with the values for MDZ remarkably different between rats and mice (19% in rats versus 2.3% in mice). In contrast, hepatic availability (Fh) was similar (APZ > TRZ > MDZ) in both species. Highly significant relationships were found between the ratio of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for the parent drugs in portal blood (AUC(por)) to that in systemic blood (AUC(sys)) and Fh in rats and mice. The double-cannulated rat is useful for estimating the hepatic availability of drug candidates by determining the AUC values for the parent drugs in portal and systemic blood samples.",

Data on demographics, epileptic syndrome, aetiology, treatment dosage and adverse effects were analysed. IV levetiracetam was administered over a period of 15-30 minutes; each 500 mg of levetiracetam was diluted in 100 mL of normal saline.", 
    "151": "Thirty-four patients (19 men and 15 women, 11-90 years old) with status epilepticus were treated with IV levetiracetam. Six patients (18%) had primarily generalized status epilepticus and 28 (82%) had focal status epilepticus. The aetiologies were: vascular (47%), cryptogenic (24%), tumours (12%), metabolic (12%) and brain anoxia (6%). The indications for administering IV levetiracetam were: no response to IV phenytoin and/or IV valproic acid (53% of patients) or to avoid adverse effects, contraindications or potential interactions (47% of patients). The median loading dose of IV levetiracetam was 1000 mg and the maintenance dosage ranged from 500 to 1500 mg/12 hours (median 1000 mg/12 hours). Status epilepticus stopped in a clear temporal relationship with IV levetiracetam in 71% of patients. IV levetiracetam was especially effective in older patients with vascular status epilepticus, while cryptogenic status epilepticus, primarily generalized status epilepticus, previous therapy with IV phenytoin and/or valproic acid and status epilepticus due to brain anoxia were associated with a poor response. There were no serious adverse events documented in the patients' charts.",

    "153": "Epidemiological and clinical studies have reported a high prevalence of anxiety symptoms in bipolar disorder, either in manic or depressive episodes, although these symptoms do not always meet criteria for a specific anxiety disorder. In addition to anxiety symptoms, bipolar disorder frequently presents with co-morbid axis I conditions, with anxiety disorders being the most common co-morbidity. Therefore, the objective of this article is to review clinical and epidemiological studies that have investigated the association between bipolar disorder and anxiety. Available data on the efficacy of treatments for bipolar disorder and co-morbid anxiety disorders are also reviewed. Existing guidelines do recognize that co-morbid anxiety has a negative impact on the course and outcome of bipolar disorder; however, there have been very few double-blind, controlled trials examining the treatment response of patients with bipolar disorder and co-occurring anxiety disorders. There is some positive evidence for quetiapine, olanzapine in combination with fluoxetine or lithium, and lamotrigine with lithium, and negative evidence for risperidone. Other therapies used for bipolar disorder, including several mood stabilizers, antidepressants, atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, have been shown to reduce anxiety symptoms, but specific data for their effects in patients with anxiety symptoms co-morbid with bipolar disorder are not available. The co-occurrence of anxiety and bipolar disorder has implications for diagnosis, clinical outcome, treatment and prognosis. Careful screening for co-morbid anxiety symptoms and disorders is warranted when diagnosing and treating patients with bipolar disorder.", 
    "154": "The biggest problem of gerontopharmaceutic therapy is polypharmacy, because it potentiates side effects and malcompliance. Best practice today includes instruction of long time patients in medication self management, which includes regular use of detailed taken medication lists. In gerontopharmaceutic therapy the following substances should be avoided: anticholinergics, dopamin receptor stimulants, long acting oral antidiabetics, benzodiazepine (other then for substitution in low dose dependency, in anaesthesia or in palliative situations) and neuroleptics (other then for psychotic symptoms). In unspecific agitation with or without dementia the measure of first choice is adaption of the milieu, which may be supported by the prescription of a sedative non tricyclic antidepressive medication.",

The NEMA NU2 Image Quality phantom and five healthy volunteers (using [(11)C]flumazenil) were scanned on both HR+ and high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) scanners. HR+ data were reconstructed using normalization and attenuation-weighted ordered subsets expectation maximization (NAW-OSEM) and a PVC algorithm (PVC-NAW-OSEM). HRRT data were reconstructed using 3D ordinary Poisson OSEM (OP-OSEM) and a PVC algorithm (PVC-OP-OSEM). For clinical studies, parametric volume of distribution (V(T)) images were generated. For phantom data, good recovery was found for both OP-OSEM (0.84 to 0.97) and PVC-OP-OSEM (0.91 to 0.98) HRRT reconstructions. In addition, for the HR+, good recovery was found for PVC-NAW-OSEM (0.84 to 0.94), corresponding well with OP-OSEM. Finally, for clinical data, good correspondence was found between PVC-NAW-OSEM and OP-OSEM-derived V(T) values (slope: 1.02+/-0.08). This study showed that HR+ image resolution using PVC-NAW-OSEM was comparable to that of the HRRT scanner. As the HRRT has a higher intrinsic resolution, this agreement validates reconstruction-based PVC as a means of improving the spatial resolution of the HR+ scanner and thereby improving the quantitative accuracy of positron emission tomography.",

    "160": "A mathematical model is proposed for representing the combined effects of mobile phase solvent composition and temperature on the retention of various analytes in HPLC. The applicability of the model in describing the retention of four macrolides in aqueous mixtures of methanol and acetonitrile determined at 20-80 degrees C in various volume fractions of the organic modifiers was shown. The mean percentage deviation (MPD) was computed as an accuracy criterion in which the overall MPD of four analytes investigated in this work was 3.9+/-1.5% (N=72). The proposed model could be reduced to two simpler versions. The first version concerning the retention data of analytes in one organic modifier at various temperatures produced for the retention description of the above experimental system as well as for the retention of three benzodiazepines in aqueous mixtures of methanol at 25-40 degrees C an overall MPD of 3.6+/-1.8%. The more reduced version of the model for calculating the retention factor of one analyte in a given organic modifier at various temperatures produced an overall MPD of 1.7+/-1.1% for both the experimental systems studied. The accuracy of the proposed model is compared with recent models to predict the retention of an analyte with respect to solvent component of the mobile phase and the temperature of column in which the results were comparable. The main advantage of the proposed model is its capability to predict the retention of various analytes considering (i) temperature of the column, (ii) the mobile phase solvent composition, (iii) the chemical structure of the analytes and (iv) the nature of organic modifier.", 
    "161": "Locus coeruleus (LC) noradrenergic neurons are implicated in a variety of functions including the regulation of vigilance and the modulation of sensory processing. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is an endogenous neuropeptide that induces a variety of behavioural changes including arousal and antinociception. In the present study, we explored whether the activity of LC noradrenergic neurons is modulated by TRH. Using current-clamp recording from isolated rat LC neurons, we found that TRH increased the firing rate of spontaneous action potentials. The TRH action was mimicked by TRH analogues including taltirelin and TRH-gly. In voltage-clamp recording at a holding potential of 50 mV, TRH produced an inward current associated with a decrease in the membrane K+ conductance. This current was inhibited by the TRH receptor antagonist chlordiazepoxide. Following inhibition of the pH-sensitive K+ conductance by extracellular acidification, the TRH response was fully inhibited. The TRH-induced current was also inhibited by the phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U-73122, but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine nor by chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by BAPTA. The recovery from the facilitatory action of TRH on the spike frequency was markedly inhibited by a high concentration of wortmannin. These results suggest that TRH activates LC noradrenergic neurons by decreasing an acid-sensitive K+ conductance via PLC-mediated hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The present findings demonstrate that TRH activates LC neurons and characterize the underlying signalling mechanisms. The action of TRH on LC neurons may influence a variety of CNS functions related to the noradrenergic system which include arousal and analgesia.", 
    "162": "Status epilepticus (SE) is divided into convulsive and non-convulsive types; both are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although convulsive SE is easily recognized, non-convulsive SE remains an elusive diagnosis as physical signs are varied and subtle. Successful management depends on a comprehensive approach that involves diagnostic testing and pharmacological interventions while ensuring cerebral oxygenation and perfusion at all times. There are a limited number of well-designed studies to support the development of evidence-based recommendations for the management of SE, especially for the management of non-convulsive status. Benzodiazepines, specifically lorazepam, continue to be the most commonly recommended first-line therapy; best treatment for refractory status cases depends on resources available and must be tailored to the individual institution. In order to facilitate care, it is recommended that each institution develop a management protocol for these patients.",

    "176": "Using a PET technique with (11)C-(R)-[1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-propyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide] ((11)C-PK11195), a PET ligand for peripheral type-benzodiazepine receptor, we evaluated the microglial activation in the rat brain after generation of unilateral cortical spreading depression, a stimulation used to bring up an experimental animal model of migraine.", 
    "177": "We found a significant increase in the brain uptake of (11)C-PK11195, which was completely displaceable by the excess amounts of unlabeled ligands, in the ipsilateral hemisphere of the spreading depression-generated rats. Moreover, the binding potential of (11)C-PK11195 in the spreading depression-generated rats was significantly higher than that in the sham-operated control rats.", 
    "178": "These results suggest that as an inflammatory reaction, microglial cells are activated in response to the nociceptive stimuli induced by cortical spreading depression in the rat brain. Therefore, the (11)C-PK11195 PET technique could have a potential for diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring of neurologic disorders related to neuroinflammation such as migraine.", 
    "179": "Review of recent publications about perinatal consequences of cocaine use during pregnancy points out that: - dramatic obstetrical, neonatal and developmental abnormalities, reported during 1980-90', are less frequent in recent cohort studies; - pregnant women who use cocaine or crack, also consume other psychoactive drugs (alcohol, tobacco, benzodiazepines, cannabis, opiates, ...) and have a very chaotic life-style; so, it is difficult to distinguish abnormalities caused by cocaine per se, even with numerous cohorts, control groups and multivariate analysis.", 
    "180": "Annonas are consumed as fresh fruits, but, because of their effects on the central nervous system, are also used in folk medicine. The effect on rat amygdala kindling of repeated administration of Annona diversifolia hexane (100mg/kg IP or PO) and ethanol (100mg/kg, PO) leaf extracts and palmitone (10mg/kg, IP) was determined. Electrographic and/or behavioral changes were monitored during kindling-induced seizures 60minutes after treatments. Antiepileptic efficacy was evaluated with respect to afterdischarge (AD) duration, spike frequency, and/or behavioral seizure activity. Oral administration of both extracts significantly decreased spike frequency, whereas intraperitoneally administered hexane extract and palmitone only reduced AD duration. Hexane extract and palmitone exhibited anticonvulsant properties and delayed establishment of a kindling state as observed with diazepam (0.3mg/kg IP). These results reinforce the anticonvulsant properties of this plant, and palmitone and other constituents are responsible for the pharmacological effects.", 
    "181": "To compare olanzapine versus haloperidol effectiveness, in terms of relapse rates in Venezuelan patients with schizophrenia.", 
    "182": "A randomized, open label, follow-up study of 9-months after clinical stabilization or hospital discharged was conducted. The Medical Outcomes Study Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Quality of Life Index from Mezzic & Cohen were used to evaluate the health state and quality of life. Safety parameters were collected.", 
    "183": "Thirty-one patients in olanzapine and 40 in haloperidol were enrolled and discontinuation rates were 65% and 68% respectively. Only one patient in haloperidol relapsed. Health status improved more with olanzapine showing statistically significant improvement in five of the eight items of the SF-36. Olanzapine was slightly superior improving quality of life. More adverse events were registered with haloperidol (p = 0.036). More extrapyramidal symptoms, akathisia and insomnia were reported with haloperidol and more weight gain with olanzapine but the differences were not significant.", 
    "184": "Both medications were similar preventing relapses. Health status and functionality improved more with olanzapine versus haloperidol. Safety results are consistent with the known profile of the drug. Study limitations on design and conduction of this study restrict its generalization.", 
    "185": "Monkeys have been proposed as an animal model to predict the magnitude of human clinical drug-drug interactions caused by CYP3A4 enzyme induction. To evaluate whether the cynomolgus monkey can be an effective in vivo model, human CYP3A4 inducers were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. First, a full-length pregnane X receptor (PXR) was cloned from the cynomolgus monkey, and the sequence was compared with those of rhesus monkey and human PXR. Cynomolgus and rhesus monkey PXR differed by only one amino acid (A68V), and both were highly homologous to human PXR (approximately 96%). When the transactivation profiles of 30 compounds, including known inducers of CYP3A4, were compared between cynomolgus and human PXR, a high degree of correlation with EC(50) values was observed. These results suggest that cynomolgus and human PXR respond in a similar fashion to these ligands. Second, two known human CYP3A4 inducers, rifampicin and hyperforin, were tested in monkey and human primary hepatocytes for induction of CYP3A enzymes. Both monkey and human hepatocytes responded similarly to the inducers and resulted in increased RNA and enzyme activity changes of CYP3A8 and CYP3A4, respectively. Lastly, in vivo induction of CYP3A8 by rifampicin and hyperforin was shown by significant reductions of midazolam exposure that were comparable with those in humans. These results show that the cynomolgus monkey can be a predictive in vivo animal model of PXR-mediated induction of human CYP3A4 and can provide a useful assessment of the resulting pharmacokinetic changes of affected drugs.",

Clinical trials are being conducted to assess its potential clinical use as an intravenous anesthetic or sedative agent. In the present study, we investigated the possibility of QT prolongation caused by JM-1232(-).", 
    "187": "We examined telemetry electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from unrestrained guinea pigs after intravenous administration of 1, 10, 25 or 50mg/kg of JM-1232(-). We also examined in situ measurements of monophasic action potential duration at 30 and 90% of repolarization (MAP(30) and MAP(90), respectively) and MAP triangulation (MAP(90-30)) from guinea pig hearts that were perfused on a Langendorff apparatus with 0, 0.1, 1, 5, 10 and 20 microg/ml of JM-1232(-). The telemetry ECG recordings showed QTc prolongation 20 min after administration of JM-1232(-) at 50mg/kg.", 
    "188": "In Langendorff-perfused hearts, MAP(30), which indicates Ca(2+) current, was significantly shortened after perfusion with JM-1232(-) at 10 and 20 microg/ml. MAP(90), which indicates K(+) current, was significantly prolonged after perfusion with JM-1232(-) at 20 microg/ml; therefore, this prolongation was attributed to a decreased heart rate. MAP triangulation (MAP(90-30)) was significantly prolonged after perfusion with JM-1232(-) at 5, 10 and 20 microg/ml; however, this prolongation was attributed to the shortened MAP(30), suggesting a possible inhibition of Ca(2+) influx.", 
    "189": "High-dose (more than 50 times the hypnotic dose) JM-1232(-) treatment associated with a high plasma concentration of the drug is unlikely to cause QT prolongation with subsequent torsades de pointes.", 
    "190": "Sleep is a crucial biological process that is regulated through complex interactions between multiple brain regions and neuromodulators. As sleep disorders can have deleterious impacts on health and quality of life, a wide variety of pharmacotherapies have been developed to treat conditions of excessive wakefulness and excessive sleepiness. The neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE), through its involvement in the ascending arousal system, impacts the efficacy of many wake- and sleep-promoting medications. Wake-promoting drugs such as amphetamine and modafinil increase extracellular levels of NE, enhancing transmission along the wake-promoting pathway. GABAergic sleep-promoting medications like benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs that act more specifically on benzodiazepine receptors increase the activity of GABA, which inhibits NE transmission and the wake-promoting pathway. Melatonin and related compounds increase sleep by suppressing the activity of the neurons in the brain's circadian clock, and NE influences the synthesis of melatonin. Antihistamines block the wake-promoting effects of histamine, which shares reciprocal signaling with NE. Many antidepressants that affect the signaling of NE are also used for treatment of insomnia. Finally, adrenergic receptor antagonists that are used to treat cardiovascular disorders have considerable sedative effects. Therefore, NE, long known for its role in maintaining general arousal, is also a crucial player in sleep pharmacology. The purpose of this review is to consider the role of NE in the actions of wake- and sleep-promoting drugs within the framework of the brain arousal systems."
