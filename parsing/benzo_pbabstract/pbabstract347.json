Applying the same behavioral endpoints, the present study investigated the alprazolam-caffeine interaction under chronic dose regimens. Both drugs were administered by the oral route. Acute alprazolam and caffeine dose-response curves (DRCs) were characterized and were then used to determine the maintenance dose for the respective chronic dose regimens. Both drugs decreased the reinforcement rate and increased the shorter-response rate in a dose-related fashion. An alprazolam DRC also was determined during chronic-caffeine, chronic-alprazolam, and concurrent chronic-caffeine-alprazolam dose regimens. Complete tolerance to caffeine-induced rate changes was observed on the second day. Incomplete tolerance occurred only at higher alprazolam doses (7-12.5 mg/kg). Cross tolerance was not found between alprazolam and caffeine. Upon discontinuation of both drugs, performance progressively returned to baseline. The four alprazolam DRCs as well as the effect-time profiles demonstrated that caffeine altered neither the magnitudes nor the patterns of alprazolam effects on the two rates under chronic dose regimens. The P\u00f6ch DRC method further confirmed the independent interaction of alprazolam and caffeine. Thus, the independence of the interaction held for both the acute and chronic dose regimens despite the development of tolerance in the latter regimens.", 
    "1": "The present study examined the influence of prior social experience on the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg/kg) on intrasexual aggression in male mice. Prior to drug testing, animals were either individually housed or screened in dyadic encounters in a neutral cage. This novel method yielded four experimental groups comprising animals with different social experiences and different aggressive/defensive characteristics: 1) individually-housed males (I): 2) aggressive males (A); 3) counter-attacking males (C), which actively responded to but did not initiate attack; and 4) defeated males (D). Twenty-four hours after screening, animals were treated with CDP and subjected to a resident-intruder test with untreated intruders. Results indicated that the lowest dose of CDP (5 mg/kg) increased aggressive behaviour but only in A males. At higher doses (10-20 mg/kg), CDP reduced attacks towards intruders in A, C and I, but not D, males. In A and C males, the antiaggressive action of CDP was associated with a prosocial effect (increased social investigation), whereas in I males, reduced aggression was associated with an increase in fear-related behaviours. As these differential effects of CDP on intermale aggression cannot be fully explained by differences in behavioural baselines, present data highlight the importance of experiential background as a powerful variable in determining behavioural responses to benzodiazepines. Present findings therefore suggest that an understanding of drug effects on social behaviour demands consideration of biological variability in phenotype.", 
    "2": "Central cholinergic and adrenergic pathways support the attentional processes necessary for detecting and reporting temporally unpredictable stimuli. To assess the functional effects of pharmacological manipulations of these pathways, male Long-Evans rats performed a two-choice, discrete-trial signal-detection task in which food was provided for pressing one lever after presentation of a signal (a 300-ms light flash), and for pressing a second lever at the end of a trial lacking a signal. Seven signal intensities were presented during each 1-h session in a pseudo-random order across three 100-trial blocks. After acquisition of a stable performance baseline, the acute effects of chlordiazepoxide (0, 3, 5, 8 mg/kg i.p.), pilocarpine (0, 1.0, 1.8, 3.0 mg/kg s.c.), scopolamine 0, 0.030, 0.056, 0.100 mg/kg s.c.), nicotine (0, 0.08, 0.25, 0.75 mg/kg s.c.), mecamylamine (0, 1.8, 3.0, 5.6 mg/kg i.p.), clonidine (0, 0.003, 0.010, 0.030 mg/kg s.c.), and idazoxan (0, 1, 3, 10 mg/kg s.c.) were assessed. Five measures of performance were analyzed: response failures; the proportion of \"hits\" [P(hit): the proportion of correct responses on signal trials]; the proportion of \"false alarms\" [P(fa): the proportion of incorrect responses on non-signal trials]; and response times (RT) for hits and for correct rejections. All drugs which slowed responding affected RT for hits and correct rejections equivalently, suggesting little or no influence of motor slowing on choice accuracy. Chlordiazepoxide reduced P(hit) at low signal intensities only, without affecting P(fa) or RT, consistent with sensory impairment (reduced visual sensitivity). All other drugs except nicotine reduced P(hit) at high signal intensities preferentially, suggesting a non-visual source of the impairment. Scopolamine, mecamylamine and clonidine affected both P(hit) and P(fa); pilocarpine and idazoxan reduced P(hit) without affecting P(fa). Nicotine at 0.75 mg/kg decreased P(hit) in the first block of trials; at 0.08 mg/kg it increased P(hit) in the second block; no dose affected P(fa). RTs were increased by pilocarpine, scopolamine, mecamylamine and clonidine, but not by nicotine or idazoxan. The data suggest that drugs which reduce cholinergic or adrenergic tone (scopolamine, mecamylamine and clonidine) impair sustained attention by decreasing the detection of signals and by increasing the false alarm rate, whereas drugs which elevate cholinergic or adrenergic tone (pilocarpine, nicotine and idazoxan) decrease attention by impairing detection of signals without affecting the false alarm rate. In contrast, the GABA-facilitating drug chlordiazepoxide appeared to affect visual thresholds rather than attention.", 
    "3": "Acute treatment with Ro 15-4513, a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, has been consistently shown to suppress ethanol self administration behavior by rats. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of Ro 15-4513 on the acquisition and maintenance of ethanol drinking behavior in male Wistar rats. In rats maintained on a limited access procedure with a choice of 12% w/v ethanol solution and water, acute treatment with Ro 15-4513 (0.1 to 3.0 mg/kg) suppressed ethanol intake in a selective and dose-related manner (p < 0.01). However, by the fourth day of chronic Ro 15-4513 treatment, ethanol intake had returned to baseline levels. In contrast, chronic administration of Ro 15-4513 during the acquisition phase increased ethanol drinking behavior, compared with vehicle (p < 0.05). To assess whether the effects of Ro 15-4513 on ethanol intake were due to an alteration in ethanol kinetics or on behavior, blood ethanol levels and rat social interaction behavior were also assessed. Neither acute nor chronic Ro 15-4513 treatment significantly altered ethanol kinetics after oral administration of ethanol (1.0 g/kg), but did suppress locomotor activity and time spent engaged in active social interaction at the 1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg doses. These results show that Ro 15-4513 has opposite effects on ethanol consumption during the acquisition and maintenance phases of ethanol drinking behavior, suggesting that different mechanisms regulate Ro 15-4513's effects on acquisition and maintenance of ethanol intake. Ro 15-4513's reported anxiogenic or memory enhancing properties may be responsible for its effects on acquisition.",

However, surgeons are often reluctant to perform the procedure under local anesthesia with sedation. Over the past four years, patients undergoing ESS have been asked to complete a questionnaire to evaluate their anesthetic experience. A total of 111 completed questionnaires were returned for evaluation. The questionnaire evaluated subjective level of pain, nausea, vomiting, and overall unpleasantness of surgery on a 100 mm visual analog scale. The results from this survey indicate a high level of patient satisfaction with our current anesthetic techniques, while identifying issues with postoperative nausea and vomiting. The results of the survey and a review of the anesthetic issues involved in successfully performing endoscopic sinus surgery are discussed.",

    "8": "The potential for drug-drug interactions in psychiatric patients is very high as combination psychopharmacotherapy used to treat comorbid psychiatric disorders, to treat the adverse effects of a medication, to augment a medication effect or to treat concomitant medical illnesses. Interactions can be pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic in nature. This paper focuses on the metabolic kinetic interactions between selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other central nervous system (CNS) drugs. The evidence for and clinical significance of these interactions are reviewed, with special emphasis on antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants and benzodiazepines. Many psychotropic medications have an affinity for the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes which promote elimination by transforming lipid soluble substances into more polar compounds. SSRIs serve both as substrates and inhibitors of these enzymes. In vitro studies provide a screening method for evaluating drug affinities for substrates, inhibitors or inducers of CYP enzymes. Although in vitro data are important as a starting point for predicting these metabolic kinetic drug interactions, case reports and controlled experimental studies in humans are required to fully evaluate their clinical significance. Several factors must be considered when evaluating the clinical significance of a potential interaction including: (a) the nature of each drugs' activity at an enzyme site (substrate, inhibitor or inducer); (b) the potency estimations for the inhibitor/inducer; (c) the concentration of the inhibitor/inducer at the enzyme site; (d) the saturability of the enzyme; (e) the extent of metabolism of the substrate through this enzyme (versus alternative metabolic routes); (f) the presence of active metabolites of the substrate; (g) the therapeutic window of the substrate; (h) the inherent enzyme activity of the individual, phenotyping/genotyping information; (i) the level of risk of the individual experiencing adverse effects (e.g. the elderly) and (j) from an epidemiological perspective, the probability of concurrent use. This paper systematically reviews both the in vitro and in vivo evidence for drug interactions between SSRIs and other CNS drugs. As potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, both paroxetine and fluoxetine have the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of antipsychotic medications metabolised through this enzyme, including perphenazine, haloperidol, thioridazine and risperidone in patients who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Controlled studies have demonstrated this for perphenazine with paroxetine and haloperidol with fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, as a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, can inhibit the metabolism of clozapine, resulting in higher plasma concentrations. Drug interactions between the SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can occur. Fluoxetine and paroxetine, as potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, can increase the plasma concentrations of secondary and tertiary tricyclic antidepressants. Sertraline and citalopram are less likely to have this effect. Fluvoxamine can increase the plasma concentrations of tertiary TCAs. Fluvoxamine inhibits, via CYP3A. CYP2C19 and CYP1A2, the metabolism of several benzodiazepines, including alprazolam, bromazepam and diazepam. Fluoxetine increases the plasma concentrations of alprazolam and diazepam by inhibiting CYP3A and CYP2C19, respectively. The clinical importance of the interaction with diazepam is attenuated by the presence of its active metabolite. Sertraline inhibits these enzymes only mildely to moderately at usual therapeutic doses. Therefore the potential for interactions is less; however, the in vivo evidence is minimal. Paroxetine and citalopram are unlikely to cause interactions with benzodiazepines. The evidence is conflicting for an interaction between carbamazepine and the SSRIs fluoxetine and fluvoxamine. These combinations should be used cautiously, and be accompanied by monitoring for adverse events and carb", 
    "9": "The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of sedatives and analgesics are significantly altered in the critically ill. These changes may account for the large differences in drug dosage requirements compared with other patient populations. Drugs that in other settings may be considered short-acting often have significantly altered onset and duration of action in critically ill patients, necessitating a change in dosage. Of the benzodiazepines, lorazepam is the drug whose parameters are the least likely to be altered in critical illness. The presence of active metabolites with other benzodiazepines complicates their use during periods of prolonged use. Similarly, the presence of active metabolites of morphine and pethidine (meperidine) warrants caution in patients with renal insufficiency. The fewer cardiovascular effects seen with high-potency opioids, such as fentanyl and sufentanil, increase their usefulness in haemodynamically compromised patients. The pharmacodynamics of propofol are not significantly altered in the critically ill. Ketamine should be used with a benzodiazepine to prevent the emergence of psychomimetic reactions. Lower sedative doses of benzodiazepines and anaesthetics may not provide reliable amnesia. Barbiturates and propofol probably do not induce hyperalgesia and lack intrinsic analgesic activity. The antipsychotic agent haloperidol has a calming effect on patients and administration to the point of sedation is generally not necessary. Combinations of sedatives and analgesics are synergistic in producing sedation. The costs of sedation and analgesia are very variable and closely linked to the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug. Monitoring of sedation and analgesia is difficult in uncooperative patients in the intensive care unit. In the future, specific monitoring tools may assist clinicians in the regulation of infusions of sedative and analgesic agents.", 
    "10": "Exogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) injected peripherally mimics effects of lipid entering the intestine on food intake and gastric motility via vagal afferents and induces c-fos expression in the locus ceruleus complex (LCC), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), area postrema (AP), and paraventricular nucleus (PVN). However, the role of peripheral endogenous CCK in induction of c-fos expression in the brain at ingestion of nutrients is controversial. In awake rats, intraduodenal lipid infusion markedly increased Fos protein-like immunoreactivity (FLI) in these brain nuclei. Perivagal capsaicin pretreatment reduced the increase of FLI in the LCC, NTS, and PVN by 66-86% and in the AP by 46%. The CCK-A receptor antagonist MK-329 (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) diminished the FLI increase in LC, NTS, AP, and PVN by 39-100%; the CCK-B receptor antagonist L-365,260 reduced the increased FLI in the AP by 54%. After capsaicin pretreatment, both CCK antagonists had additional inhibitory effects only on FLI in the AP. These findings suggest that entry of lipid into the intestine activates c-fos in the LCC, NTS, and PVN predominantly via CCK-A receptors on vagal afferents and in the AP via vagal and nonvagal pathways, as well as CCK-B and CCK-A receptors.", 
    "11": "The contractile roles of the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors were investigated in guinea pig longitudinal colonic smooth muscle. Prior treatment of the colon with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4-DAMP mustard) (40 nM) in combination with [[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) (1.0 microM) caused a subsequent, irreversible inhibition of oxotremorine-M-induced contractions when measured after extensive washing. The estimate of the degree of receptor inactivation after 2 hr (97%) was not much greater than that measured after 1 hr (95%), which suggests that both 4-DAMP mustard-sensitive and -insensitive muscarinic subtypes contribute to the contractile response. Pertussis toxin treatment had no significant inhibitory effect on the control contractile response to oxotremorine-M, but caused an 8.8-fold increase in the EC50 value measured after a 2-hr treatment with 4-DAMP mustard. These results suggest that, after elimination of most of the M3 receptors with 4-DAMP mustard, the contractile response can be mediated by the pertussis toxin-sensitive M2 receptor. After pertussis toxin treatment, the kinetics of alkylation of muscarinic receptors in the colon were consistent with a single, 4-DAMP mustard-sensitive, M3 receptor subtype mediating the contractile response. When measured after a 2-hr treatment with 4-DAMP mustard and in the presence of histamine (0.30 microM) and either forskolin (10 microM) or isoproterenol (0.60 microM), the contractile responses to oxotremorine-M were pertussis toxin-sensitive and potently antagonized by the M2 selective antagonist, AF-DX 116. Collectively, our results indicate that the M2 receptor elicits contraction through two mechanisms, a direct contraction and an indirect contraction by preventing the relaxant effects of cAMP-generating agents.", 
    "12": "We examined the effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-stimulated 36Cl- flux. Sprague-Dawley rat dams were fed either a liquid diet containing 5% ethanol, pair-fed an isocalorically equivalent 0% ethanol diet or rat chow ad libitum throughout gestation. Membrane vesicles were prepared from medial frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampal formation of adult offspring in each diet group. GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux was not significantly affected by prenatal ethanol exposure in any of the three brain regions examined. Positive allosteric modulation of GABA-stimulated 36Cl- flux by flunitrazepam or alphaxalone, as well as negative modulation by FG-7142 or pregnenolone, were all diminished in medial frontal cortex of 5% ethanol diet offspring compared with both ad libitum and pair-fed control groups. In cerebellum, prenatal ethanol exposure attenuated the modulatory effects of both benzodiazepines, but did not affect neurosteroid modulation. In hippocampus, prenatal ethanol exposure enhanced the effects of flunitrazepam and alphaxalone, whereas negative modulatory effects were either decreased (FG-7142) or unchanged (pregnenolone). These results indicate that moderate ethanol consumption during gestation can produce long-lasting alterations in neuromodulatory influences on GABAA receptor-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission in adult offspring. In hippocampal formation, the heightened sensitivity to positive modulatory influences may contribute to synaptic plasticity deficits in fetal ethanol-exposed rat offspring. We speculate that these prenatal ethanol-induced changes may be either a consequence of differential GABAA receptor subunit expression or receptor uncoupling in different brain regions. Furthermore, offspring exposed to ethanol in utero may display differential sensitivities to benzodiazepines and possibly other centrally active therapeutic agents.", 
    "13": "In the present investigation, the extent of arteriovenous concentration differences of midazolam in rats was quantified, and the consequences of these differences on the pharmacodynamic estimates were determined. The arterial concentration-effect relationships where analyzed by a traditional-effect compartment model that characterizes the delay between blood and the effect site with the rate constant k(eo). Venous concentration-effect relationships where analyzed according to the traditional model and an extended-effect compartment model that, by incorporating an additional rate constant k(vo), can characterize the delay between the arterial and venous sampling site. Significant hysteresis was observed in the arterial but not the venous concentration-effect relationships. Rate constants for k(eo), k(vo) and terminal half-life were (mean +/- S.E.M.) 0.32 +/- 0.062, 0.093 +/- 0.013 and 0.0217 +/- 0.0008 min-1, respectively, indicating the existence of significant arteriovenous concentration differences. Pharmacodynamic estimates as determined on basis of the arterial concentrations and the traditional-effect compartment model were EC50 = 104 +/- 1 ng/ml, Emax = 151 +/- 4 microV/sec and gamma = 0.83 +/- 0.06. Analysis of the venous concentration-effect relationships on basis of the traditional- or extended-effect compartment model led to similar pharmacodynamic estimates, indicating that the observed arteriovenous concentration differences did not result in biased pharmacodynamic estimates. This is due to the fact that the effect relevant elimination rate constant of midazolam is relatively small compared with its k(eo). The observed results are consistent with earlier reports based on computer simulations.", 
    "14": "We studied the adaptation of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor function to chronic ethanol exposure in cells stably transfected with the following GABAA receptor subunits: alpha-1 beta-2 gamma-2L, alpha-1 beta-2 gamma-2S, alpha-1 beta-3 gamma-2S, alpha-1 beta-1, alpha-5 beta-3 gamma-3 and alpha-6 beta-3 gamma-2S. Chronic exposure to ethanol resulted in a decrease in muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- flux and a decrease in modulation of that flux by ethanol, flunitrazepam, methyl-6,7-4-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and pregnanolone without any change in the modulation by pentobarbital or zinc. Direct activation of the GABAA receptor by pentobarbital was enhanced by chronic ethanol treatment. Reduction of the action of muscimol, ethanol and flunitrazepam differed in the duration and amount of ethanol required to see an effect. Reduction of the action of ethanol of alpha-1 beta-2 gamma-2L cells occurred within 15 min and was near-maximal for 25 mM ethanol, whereas reduction of the actions of muscimol and flunitrazepam actions required hours of exposure and higher concentrations of ethanol. Chronic ethanol exposure produced a reduction in the Emax value for the action of muscimol for all six subunit combinations, but quantification of surface receptors by immunolabeling showed no change in GABAA receptor density. The differences in alcohol sensitivity and time courses for different effects of ethanol indicate multiple mechanisms of adaptation of GABAA receptors. Use of stably transfected cells rules out \"subunit substitution\" as a mechanism for these changes and points to post-translational changes (e.g., phosphorylation, receptor assembly) as the most likely mechanisms. These in vitro findings are compared with results from in vivo studies.",

Treatment of vestibular symptoms related to migraine has been proposed similar to that used for headache control, but few examples of the effectiveness of this therapy have been published. The purpose of this study is to present the various approaches that can be used to manage vestibular symptoms related to migraine, and to evaluate the overall effectiveness of these treatment approaches. This was a retrospective review of 89 patients diagnosed with migraine-related dizziness and vertigo. The character of vestibular symptoms, pattern of cochlear symptoms, results of auditory and vestibular tests, and comorbidity factors are presented. Treatment was individualized according to symptoms and comorbidity factors, and analyzed regarding effectiveness in control of the major vestibular symptoms of episodic vertigo, positional vertigo, and nonvertiginous dizziness. Medical management included dietary changes, medication, physical therapy, lifestyle adaptations, and acupuncture. Complete or substantial control of vestibular symptoms was achieved in 68 (92%) of 74 patients complaining of episodic vertigo; in 56 (89%) of 63 patients with positional vertigo; and 56 (86%) of 65 patients with non-vertiginous dizziness.

    "37": "Experiments were performed in vivo and in vitro to date the onset of hepatic CYP2C isoforms and CYP2C-dependent activities during the perinatal period in humans. Proteins were not detected by immunoblotting in fetal livers and developed in the first few weeks after birth, irrespective of the gestational age at birth. Similarly, the hydroxylation of tolbutamide, a marker for CYP2C9 was undetected in fetal liver microsomes and rose in the first month after birth. In adult liver preparations, the hydroxylation of diazepam correlated well with the CYP3 A content of microsomes (r = 0.858, p < 0.01) and with the 6 beta hydroxylation of testosterone (r = 0.830, p < 0.005), whereas demethylation was related to the bulk of CYP2C proteins (r = 0.865, p < 0.005). In fetal liver microsomes, hydroxylation and demethylation activities accounted for less than 5% of the adult activities and both increased immediately after birth to reach adult activities at 1 year of age. When diazepam was given for sedative purpose in neonates and infants, the in-vivo urinary excretion of desmethyl diazepam, temazepam and oxazepam was extremely low in 1-2 day newborns (less than 5 nmol metabolites excreted in 24 h per kg body weight) and developed in the first week after birth. In newborns, barbiturates and to a lesser extent steroids, acted as inducers of CYP2C isoforms and increased tolbutamide hydroxylation, diazepam demethylation and diazepam hydroxylation by 2 to 10-fold. The surge of CYP2C proteins was caused by an accumulation of RNAs occurring in the first week after birth. The hepatic content in CYP2C8, 2C9 and 2C18 RNA displayed the same profile of evolution, which suggested a coregulation of their synthesis during the neonatal period. Taken together, these biochemical and clinical data enable dating of the onset of CYP2C proteins to the first weeks after birth, which is of considerable clinical importance in pediatric pharmacology.",

    "42": "We investigated the effect of thiopental, midazolam, and ketamine (at clinically relevant concentrations and at 0.1 and 10 times these concentrations) on several aspects of human neutrophil functions. The three intravenous (i.v.) anesthetics significantly decreased chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (O2-, H2O2, OH) production of neutrophils in a dose-dependent manner. At clinically relevant concentrations, thiopental and midazolam significantly depressed these neutrophil functions. However, ketamine at the clinical plasma concentration did not impair chemotaxis or ROS production, except phagocytosis. In contrast, the three anesthetics had no effect on the levels of ROS production by a cell-free ROS generating system. In addition, intracellular calcium concentrations in neutrophils stimulated by N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucil-L-phenylalanine were dose-dependently decreased in the presence of each of the three anesthetics. The suppression of an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations may be responsible for the inhibition of neutrophil functions by the i.v. anesthetics.",

In this report we describe the technique for determination of receptor-ligand kinetics utilizing ligands labeled with the short-lived radionuclide 11C. The limitations and advantages are discussed. The benzodiazepine antagonist [11C]Ro 15-1788 was used as a model substance, and the use of storage phosphor plates for quantification of radioactivity was validated. Storage phosphor plates showed an excellent linear range (approximately 10[3]) and acceptable resolution (approximately 0.5 mm). Receptor-ligand kinetics, including depletion, association and dissociation, saturation and displacement were evaluated with good results through the use of short-lived radiotracers and storage phosphor plates.",

We also highlight the opportunities for psychotherapy with this population.", 
    "50": "Antibiotics are the second most commonly prescribed class of medication in the United States. An awareness and understanding of their potential effects on the central nervous system and their interactions with psychotropic agents is important in the evaluation of neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms in patients. Since the introduction of antibiotic agents in the 1930s, numerous (primarily anecdotal) reports have appeared describing psychiatric side effects ranging from anxiety and panic to major depression, psychosis, and delirium in patients with and without a premorbid psychiatric history. Risk factors have included prior psychopathology, coexisting medical conditions, slow acetylator status, advanced age, concomitant medications, and increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, as well as high antibiotic dosage and intrathecal or intravenous administration. Psychiatric toxicity may result from various mechanisms of action, including antagonism of gamma-aminobutyric acid or pyridoxine, adverse interactions with alcohol, or inhibition of protein synthesis. Adverse pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between antibiotics and concomitant medications including lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, valproate, neuroleptics, antidepressants, methadone, and disulfiram have also been reported. Because such effects are often not recognized by clinicians, accurate epidemiologic data on their incidence are not available.",

    "52": "Patients with methamphetamine toxicity often present to the emergency department (ED) agitated, violent and psychotic. To determine the efficacy of a benzodiazepine versus a butyrophenone for chemical restraint we conducted a prospective, randomized study at a large urban university ED between January 1995 and January 1997. Patients were randomized to receive either lorazepam or droperidol intravenously. A 6-point sedation scale was devised, with 6 representing extreme agitation and 1 deep sleep. Sedation scores were recorded at time 0, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 min. Vital signs were recorded at time 0 and at 60 min. If sedation was inadequate, repeat dosages of each drug could be repeated at 30 min. Toxicology screen, ethanol and creatinine phosphokinase levels were obtained. A total of 146 patients were evaluated. Seventy-four patients received lorazepam and 72 received droperidol. Both drugs had similar sedation profiles at 5 min. Patients receiving droperidol had significantly improved sedation scores at times 10, 15, 30 and 60 min than lorazepam (p < 0.001). More repeat doses of lorazepam were given (26) than droperidol (6) at 30 min. Both drugs produced significant reduction in pulse, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature over 60 min. We conclude droperidol produces a more rapid and profound sedation than lorazepam for methamphetamine toxicity. Lorazepam is more likely to require repeat dosing than droperidol.", 
    "53": "The GABAA receptor belongs, along with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, the glycine receptor and the 5-HT3 receptor, to a family of homologous transmitter-gated ion channels mediating fast synaptic transmission. Many classes of drug interact with the GABAA receptor, which is the major inhibitory ion channel in the mammalian brain. Among these drugs are the allosteric modulators acting at the benzodiazepine binding site. In this article, Erwin Sigel and Andreas Buhr discuss recent studies that have identified amino acid residues that are thought to form the binding pocket for these compounds. These residues are probably located at subunit interfaces of the protein pentamer and at least some of them are homologous to residues implicated in channel agonist binding. This implies pseudosymmetry of channel agonist and channel modulatory sites, which may be, as recent data indicate, a general principle realized in other pseudosymmetric protein complexes.", 
    "54": "Anxiolysis with drugs and psychoprophylaxis are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation. The beneficial effects of anxiolytics, however, appear to be difficult to prove. In this study a comparison was made of heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), and norepinephrine, epinephrine, and cortisol levels. In group I 19 children received only psychological treatment, while in group II 21 children received 0.2 mg/kg midazolam orally. Measuring points were directly before medication, 30 min afterward, and at induction of anaesthesia. During the observation period the patients (5-10 years old) remained calm. At the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range; 30 min after premedication the HR and BP were significantly higher in group I than in group II. In contrast to group I, epinephrine levels in group II were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication. In both groups, norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication. Cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam. HR, BP, as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0.2 mg/kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children.",

    "58": "The effect of glutamate on the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates was examined in oligodendrocyte progenitor cultures prepared from rat brains. Glutamate, and the analogues alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) and kainate, caused a concentration- and time-dependent increase in [3H]inositol trisphosphate (IP3) formation and the effect was blocked by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), a competitive AMPA and kainate receptor antagonist. Similarly, the more selective, noncompetitive antagonist of AMPA receptors, 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466), significantly reduced the effect of both AMPA and kainate. In contrast, antagonists of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclo-hepten-5, 10-imine (MK-801) and R(-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP), and antagonists of metabotropic receptors, L(+)-2-amino-3-phosphono-propanoic acid (L-AP3) and alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG), were ineffective. These results suggest that the effect of glutamate on [3H]IP3 accumulation is mediated through ionotropic AMPA receptors. Cyclothiazide, an inhibitor of AMPA receptor desensitization, strongly potentiated the AMPA and kainate-stimulated [3H]IP3 formation as well as the uptake of 45Ca2+ in line with the previous findings. 45Ca2+ uptake evoked by AMPA or kainate, in combination with cyclothiazide, was also prevented by both CNQX and GYKI 52466. Glutamate-stimulated [3H]IP3 accumulation was prevented by EGTA, suggesting a requirement for extracellular calcium. Pre-incubation with the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel blockers, diltiazem, nifedipine and CdCl2, partially prevented the glutamate-induced [3H]IP3 accumulation as well as 45Ca2+ uptake. Similarly, the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger blockers benzamil and 3,4-dichlorobenzamil reduced significantly kainate-stimulated 45Ca2+ uptake. These data indicate that glutamate-induced [3H]IP3 accumulation is triggered by calcium influx via AMPA receptors, voltage-gated calcium channels and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger operating in reverse mode.", 
    "59": "The aim of this study was to determine the bioavailability and absorption kinetics of midazolam given as an intranasal (i.n.) spray. In addition, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite, 1-hydroxymidazolam, were measured to give an indication of enteral absorption. An i.v. and i.n. midazolam dose were given in a crossover study to 14 adult surgical patients. Individual uptake profiles of i.n. midazolam were estimated by numerical deconvolution. After an i.n. dose of 0.15 mg kg-1, maximum arterial plasma concentrations were 192 (SD 48) micrograms litre-1 at 14 (2) min. Uptake of midazolam was rapid and bioavailability was 83 (15)%. Formation of the 1-hydroxy metabolite after i.n. administration did not exceed that after the i.v. dose. This demonstrates that under optimal conditions absorption of midazolam via the nasal mucosa was virtually complete. In this case little midazolam was swallowed and subjected to first-pass metabolism in the liver and therefore pharmacologically important amounts of active metabolite were not produced. Routinely administering i.n. midazolam under the assumption that the bioavailability is approximately 50% (as reported previously in the literature) may lead to overdosing in some patients.", 
    "60": "The objectives of this study were to explore, by a modelling approach, in nine young (24-28 yr) and nine elderly (67-81 yr) male subjects, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of Ro 48-6791, a new water soluble benzodiazepine. A microprocessor-controlled i.v. infusion pump generated linearly increasing arterial plasma concentrations until predetermined EEG and clinical end-points were attained. This concentration was maintained for 15 min and thereafter the infusion was discontinued. Haemodynamic and respiratory variables were monitored continuously. At full reorientation of the subject, a second infusion cycle was started under the same conditions to investigate the reproducibility of the concentration-effect relationship. The plasma concentration-time profiles of Ro 48-6791 were fitted accurately to an open three-compartment model. Plasma concentrations of Ro 48-6792, an N-dealkylated metabolite, accumulated during the course of the study. Pharmacokinetic variables of Ro 48-6791 were similar for both groups. The largest differences between young and elderly subjects, respectively, were found for clearance (mean 85 (SD 23) vs 71 (15) litre h-1) and k12 (11 (7) vs 7 (3) h-1). The concentration-median EEG frequency relationship was described with a sigmoid Emax model. Elderly subjects showed slightly increased drug sensitivity compared with young subjects (EC50 72 (25) and 44 (15) micrograms litre-1 in young and elderly subjects, respectively). The concentration-response data of the second infusion cycle deviated from the fitted curve suggesting either development of acute tolerance to the EEG effects of Ro 48-6791 or a role for drug metabolites. Because of the differences in sensitivity and clearance, lower doses of Ro 48-6791 should be administered to elderly compared with young subjects in order to achieve similar effects.", 
    "61": "Antiemetic effect and safety of concurrent administration of ondansetron and other antiemetics (dexamethasone, domperidone and ethyl loflazepate), given for complete suppression of nausea/vomiting, were examined in 46 patients (109 courses) with gynecological cancer receiving single high-dose of cisplatin or carboplatin. As for the delayed emesis, antiemetic effect depending on the steroid treatment duration, given concurrently to ondansetron, was compared. The results were as follows; 1. In 78 courses, anticancer drugs were given concurrently to cisplatin or carboplatin only on Day 1. In the remaining 31 courses, those drugs were concurrently administered up to Day 6 at the longest. 2. Complete suppression (i.e., no onsets) rate of acute emesis was 64.2% (70/109 courses) for nausea, and 84.4% (92/109 courses) for vomiting. 3. When the complete suppression depending on duration of concomitant steroid was examined mainly in patients receiving CAP (cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and cisplatin), higher antiemetic effect, especially in nausea, was observed in those on concomitant steroids for 3 days compared to that for 1 day. 4. The food intake rate improved along with nausea symptoms. 5. No adverse event or laboratory abnormality due to the multi-antiemetic treatment was observed. Based on the above, the efficacy of the antiemetic treatment in this study was confirmed. In delayed emesis, concurrent steroids given for 3 days after chemotherapy were considered effective and were also regarded to improve food intake.", 
    "62": "1. Pigeons were trained to discriminate chlordiazepoxide (CDP) from saline using two-key food reinforced drug discrimination procedures. Discriminative control by CDP was maintained despite extended training with vehicle-like doses of CDP, by using a modified \"fading\" procedure that provided for a mixture of drug discrimination training sessions preceded by an i.m. injection of either 8.0 mg/kg CDP, or a lower training dose of CDP (4.0, 2.8, 2.0, 1.4, 1.0, 0.7, or 0.5 mg/kg CDP), or saline. The lower training dose was decreased across blocks of sessions. 2. Four lower training doses (1.4, 1.0, 0.7, and 0.5 mg/kg CDP) were retrained, with 10 min of 98 dB of noise administered 75 min prior to each drug discrimination training session. Presession exposure to noise increased percent CDP-appropriate choices for each of the four lower training doses by 15-20% over those obtained previously. 3. It is concluded that brief presession exposure to loud noise increases sensitivity to the discriminative stimulus effects of low training doses of CDP.", 
    "63": "1. Although the GABA-A receptor complex has been the main focus of anti-anxiety therapy, the neural interaction in the septohippocampal circuit between GABA-A and the neurotransmitter, 5-HT, compels a study of the monoamine, 5-HT, in anxiety as well. 2. Neurochemistry for anxiety is also intimately involved with the neurotransmitter, NE. Indeed, 5-HT is a component of the dorsal ascending noradrenergic bundle and both neurotransmitters, NE and 5-HT, have been implicated in clinical depression. 3. In vivo microvoltammetric studies were performed using miniature carbon based sensors to detect NE release and concurrent 5-HT release, with 2 separate neural electrochemical signals, within CA1 region of hippocampus, in the chloral hydrate anesthetized rat. 4. Time course studies showed that both the triazolobenzodiazepine (TBZD), alprazolam, and the benzodiazepine (BZD), diazepam, decreased hippocampal NE release. 5. The in vivo and on line neurochemical profile of hippocampal 5-HT release for alprazolam differed from that of diazepam, i.e. alprazolam increased hippocampal 5-HT release, whereas diazepam decreased hippocampal 5-HT release. 6. Time course studies showed that the alpha 2-adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, an anxiogenic agent, increased both NE and 5-HT release in CA1 region of hippocampus; the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, decreased NE release and increased 5-HT release in the same region. 7. Neither the profile for the TBZD, alprazolam, nor that of the BZD, diazepam, mimicked the neurochemical profile for the anxiogenic agent, yohimbine; the neurochemical profile for the TBZD, alprazolam, was similar to that of the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine. 8. Interestingly, alprazolam's hippocampal 5-HT/NE interaction is similar to clonidine's 5-HT/NE action at alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptors, resulting in enhanced 5-HT release. 9. Enhanced 5-HT release in hippocampus, exhibited by the atypical TBZD, alprazolam, and not by the typical BZD, diazepam, may be an underlying mechanism for the antidepressant activity exhibited by alprazolam.", 
    "64": "Intraduodenal fat inhibits gastric acid secretion via the release of one or more hormonal enterogastrones thought to arise from ileocolonic mucosa. This study determined whether glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-(7-36) amide and peptide YY (PYY), colocalized in L cells found in the ileum, mediate intraduodenal fat-induced inhibition of stimulated gastric acid, and evaluated the influence of cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) receptor activation. Gastric acid secretion in response to duodenal perfusions of 8% peptone was measured in conscious dogs with gastric and duodenal cannulas. Intraduodenal administration of a 10% fat emulsion suppressed gastric acid secretion by 72 +/- 4% (P < 0.001) and increased plasma levels of GLP-1 and PYY by 44 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 4 fmol/ml, respectively (both P < 0.01). Pretreatment with the CCK-A receptor antagonist MK-329 completely reversed the inhibition of gastric acid by fat, suppressed rises of plasma GLP-1 (maximum change, 23 +/- 4 fmol/ml), and reduced plasma PYY responses to baseline. Intravenous infusions of 50 pmol/kg x h GLP-1 or PYY, which reproduced plasma elevations after intraduodenal fat, inhibited gastric acid secretion by 66 +/- 5% and 51 +/- 6%, respectively (both P < 0.01); coinfusions of GLP-1 and PYY abolished gastric acid secretion (P < 0.001) without influencing plasma gastrin or somatostatin. Pretreatment with 1500 pmol/kg x h of the GLP-1 antagonist exendin-(9-39) amide did not alter the magnitude of inhibition of gastric acid caused by exogenous GLP-1. These results indicate that GLP-1 and PYY released by intraduodenal fat, in part through CCK-dependent pathways, are major enterogastrones in dogs. This inhibitory action occurs independent of circulating concentrations of somatostatin and gastrin and appears to involve a GLP-1 receptor distinct from that mediating incretin effects.",

    "71": "The research criteria of treatment-resistance in schizophrenia are reviewed and discussed, and the following definition for the use in the clinic is proposed: At least two periods of treatment with conventional antipsychotics from two different chemical classes at adequate doses for a period of at least four weeks, each without significant symptomatic relief. In addition, patients have to meet the criteria of clinical significant psychopathology, reduced psychosocial function or reduced quality of life. The article also reviews efficacy studies and the recommendations for the psychopharmacological treatment of therapy-resistant schizophrenia. Placebo-controlled and open trials have shown clozapine to be clearly effective in 30-60% of patients resistant to conventional antipsychotic treatment. Up to one half of the patients may respond between three months and a year of treatment. Clozapine has been found to reduce positive and negative symptoms as well as enhancing both cognitive and psychosocial function in schizophrenics. The first drug of choice today, after treatment-resistance has been established is a trial of clozapine for at least six months. The optimal dose range of clozapine appears to be 300-600 mg/day for most patients. Some schizophrenics cannot be treated with clozapine because of contraindications or do not respond sufficiently. In these patients conventional antipsychotics have to be prescribed and augmentated with benzodiazepines, antidepressants, mood-stabilizers, or electroconvulsive treatment.", 
    "72": "The syndrome of akathisia typically consists of a subjective component, e.g. inner restlessness and an urge to move, and observable symptoms such as restless legs and inability to sit still. In most cases akathisia is caused by neuroleptics. There are several subtypes of akathisia according to the time of onset in the course of neuroleptic treatment. In clinical routine extrapyramidal motor disturbances are often underestimated or misinterpreted. As far as akathisia is concerned, differential diagnosis of restlessness or of repetitive movement patterns may be problematic. Non-compliance and impulsive behaviour are regarded as possible complications of akathisia, but systematic investigations are lacking. The pathophysiology of akathisia is not clear, but it probably differs from other pharmacologically induced motor disturbances. If warrantable, the first step in akathisia treatment is dose-reduction of the causing agent. Anticholinergic drugs, benzodiazepines, and beta-receptor blockers may be effective. Clinical assessment and survey of the patient's behaviour, e.g. during occupational therapy and group therapy is important for an early diagnosis of akathisia so that complications may be minimised.",

This has encouraged the development of other new agents that share some of clozapine's receptor binding characteristics. A wide range of clinical trial designs are being used during the development of new antipsychotic medications. This article describes both basic designs and more innovative ones: flexible-dose designs that include placebo and conventional neuroleptic agents as controls; fixed-dose designs with multiple doses of experimental medication; and fixed-dose designs with multiple doses of the experimental and comparator medication. The strengths and weaknesses of each are identified. The need for long-term maintenance studies of newer agents is emphasized because psychotic disorders in general, and schizophrenia in particular, are chronic relapsing illnesses. The current status of four newer antipsychotic medications is considered: clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and sertindole. The importance of direct comparison among the newer antipsychotic medications in both short- and long-term trials is highlighted.",

The main diagnostic categories of late-life psychoses include dementia with psychotic symptoms, late-onset schizophrenia, delusional disorder, early-onset psychotic disorders extending through late life, late-onset mood disorders, psychotic disorders caused by medical conditions or medications, and delirium. First onset of psychotic symptoms in late life is commonly associated with identifiable structural brain abnormalities and reflects underlying brain pathology. We reviewed the available literature on late-life psychotic manifestations, focusing on diagnostic classification and treatment approaches. Antipsychotics are the mainstay of treatment for these conditions, but should be used cautiously in elderly patients because of their increased sensitivity to side effects. Overall, appropriate research data on the effectiveness of various antipsychotic agents for late-life psychotic conditions are lacking. Non-antipsychotic psychotropic medications may be of value in managing some of these conditions.",

Cobalt chloride crystals (3.5 mg/kg) were inserted stereotactically into the left hippocampus and recording electrodes affixed to the head of 23 rats. Focal spiking was evident within 5-7 days of implantation. Occasional ictal electrographic events were observed with cobalt alone, but consistent ictal events could be produced by intraperitoneal injection of pilocarpine hydrochloride (60 mg/kg) into the cobalt-treated animals. When rhythmical spiking was observed, the animals were treated either with DZP (0.25 mg in 50 microliters) or a vehicle (VEH) delivered into the left hippocampus. Blinded spike counts before and after injection showed spiking at 133.3 +/- 53.4% of baseline (mean +/- SD, n = 8) for the VEH-treated animals and 2.7 +/- 3.3% (n = 8) for the DZP-treated animals. Ictal events occurred in seven of the eight VEH-treated and two of the eight DZP-treated rats. Mean time to the first ictal event was 5.9 +/- 6.9 min for VEH-treated animals and 24 +/- 32.6 min for DZP-treated animals. DZP injected into the hippocampus contralateral to the cobalt did not reduce spiking. Systemic levels of DZP were unmeasurable in nine of ten tested animals. Focal perfusion of DZP therefore effectively reduced spiking in this cobalt chloride/pilocarpine model of focal and secondarily generalized epilepsy. This model, while involving GABAergic mechanisms, does not entirely depend upon GABAergic mechanisms. The findings therefore broaden the possibility of using focal DZP as a treatment for partial seizures.",

Elderly patients are particularly susceptible to tetanus and its complications. Prevention of tetanus focuses on primary immunization and scheduled boosters. Management of tetanus involves initial stabilization of the patient and protection of the airway, prevention of tetanospasmin absorption by administration of human tetanus immune globulin 3000-6000 IU, and eradication of Clostridium tetani with antimicrobial therapy (metronidazole 500 mg q8h). Supportive measures include the administration of neuromuscular blocking agents such as pancuronium in patients requiring artificial ventilation, as well as benzodiazepines (midazolam 5-15 mg/h) for sedation and muscle relaxation. Autonomic dysfunction should be managed with beta-adrenergic blockers such as propranolol or labetalol.",

    "90": "Two women developed stomatitis after the intake of fluoxetine for the treatment of depression. One of the patients had six recurrent episodes of stomatitis without suspecting an association with fluoxetine. No other drugs were administered during these episodes. The second patient was treated concurrently with fluoxetine and bentazepam. In both patients the lesion improved upon discontinuation of fluoxetine, even though the second patient continued to take a different benzodiazepine.", 
    "91": "Stomatitis related to fluoxetine has not been previously reported in clinical trials or in the literature. According to the causal algorithm used by the Spanish Drug Surveillance Schemes, the first case constituted a defined adverse reaction and the second was probable.", 
    "92": "Our observations suggest that fluoxetine may be considered as a probable cause of stomatitis. The reporting of isolated cases of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) makes it possible to define the toxicity profile of recently marketed drugs such as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, including fluoxetine. Emphasis is placed on the potential role played by emergency departments in detecting ADRs.", 
    "93": "Pharmacological results obtained in animals tested in approach/avoidance conflict situations have led to the suggestion that 5-HT enhances anxiety by acting on forebrain structures. In contrast, results with intracerebral drug injection associated with aversive electrical brain stimulation indicate that 5-HT inhibits aversion in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG). To reconcile this evidence, it has been suggested that 5-HT may enhance conditioned fear in the amygdala while inhibiting innate fear in the DPAG. To test this hypothesis, we used three drug treatments known to increase the release of 5-HT from terminals of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR): (1) intra-DR microinjection of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142, (2) intra-DR microinjection of the excitatory amino acid kainic acid and (3) intraperitoneal injection of the 5-HT releaser and uptake blocker D-fenfluramine. All drug treatments enhanced inhibitory avoidance (learned fear) in the elevated T-maze, a new animal model of anxiety. Intra-raphe kainate and D-fenfluramine also decreased one-way escape (innate fear) in the T-maze. In contrast, reduction of 5-HT release by intra-DR injection of 8-OH-DPAT impaired inhibitory avoidance without affecting one-way escape. Overall, these results agree with the above hypothesis. Clinical implications are discussed, especially with regard to panic disorder.", 
    "94": "Several kinds of psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression, schizophrenia) have been associated with epilepsies, and clinical data suggest that patients with seizures involving limbic structures are the most prone to develop behavioural disorders between the seizures (i.e. interictally). Studying the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie these symptoms is difficult in humans because of different interfering factors (e.g. psychosocial difficulties, pharmacological side-effects, lesions), which can be avoided in animal models. Using repetitive electrical stimulations (kindling) or local applications of a neuroexcitotoxin in limbic structures (mainly the amygdala and hippocampus), several authors have reported lasting changes of emotional reactivity in cats and rats. These changes appear as anxiety-related reactions expressed as a hyperdefensiveness in the cat, or a reduction of spontaneous exploration in tests predictive of anxiogenic effects in the rat. Some neuroplasticity processes known to develop during epileptogenesis (neuronal-hyperexcitability, modulation of GABA/benzodiazepine transmission) may participate in these lasting changes of behaviour, especially in structures involved in the control of fear-promoted reactions (amygdala, periaqueductal grey matter). In addition, endogenous control systems may also play a critical role in the occurrence of interictal behavioural disorders.", 
    "95": "All 2,617 children who received midazolam and meperidine for a variety of endoscopic procedures were monitored for the development of adverse behavioral problems. Thirty-six (1.4%) of the children (ages 1-17 years) experienced a paradoxical behavioral reaction, which consisted of inconsolable crying, combativeness, disorientation, dysphoria, tachycardia, agitation, and restlessness. The reaction occurred at a mean of 17 minutes after the administration of midazolam. Following treatment with flumazenil, the reaction dissipated within a mean of 14 minutes. Three of the 36 patients underwent additional endoscopic procedures utilizing only meperidine. No similar reaction was observed in these patients. Awareness of the reaction and prompt administration of flumazenil decreased the duration of the reaction.", 
    "96": "A single prior undrugged exposure to the four-plate test reduces punished responding on retest at intervals ranging from 24 h to 42 days. Furthermore, prior experience attenuates the anxiolytic response to the benzodiazepines diazepam (0.25 to 2 mg/kg) and lorazepam (0.5 to 4 mg/kg). The result was first discussed in term of \"one trial tolerance.\" The anxiety baseline was increased during the retest, which counteracted the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines. To ascertain if memory processes are also implicated, the cholinergic drugs scopolamine and oxotremorine were used. Additional experiments with the GABAergic inverse agonist FG7142 and with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT were also performed. Administration of scopolamine and 8-OH-DPAT-induced weak impairment of memory, when administered before the second trial, but no effect was seen with cognition enhancing agents.", 
    "97": "Gender differences in anxiety have long been assumed to exist, but the experimental evidence is contradictory. It has also been suggested that antianxiety agents may have gender-dependent behavioral effects. The present experiment was designed to establish whether or not intact male and female rats behave differently when exposed to a Differential-Reinforcement of Low-Rate 72-s schedule of reinforcement (assumed to assess some of the inhibitory behavioral tendencies associated with anxiety), and whether or not the behavioral effects of acute chlordiazepoxide administration would differ between the sexes. There were no differences between male and female rats in the total number of responses, the total number of obtained reinforcers, or response efficiency in the absence of drug administration. Male and female Wistar rats were then challenged with different doses of chlordiazepoxide (vehicle, 1, 3, 10, 17, and 30 mg/kg). Low doses of chlordiazepoxide (1 and 3 mg/kg) decreased response efficiency, and medium doses (10 and 17 mg/kg) increased response efficiency in male and female rats. The highest dose of CDP (30 mg/kg) further increased response efficiency in male rats, but decreased response efficiency in female rats. These results suggest that the behavioral effects of chlordiazepoxide are dose dependent and that the effects of a large dose of chlordiazepoxide differ between male and female rats. Whether or not gender differences in drug metabolism or whether schedule contingencies played an important role in these observations remains to be determined in future experiments.", 
    "98": "Humans were trained to discriminate the benzodiazepine triazolam (0.32 mg/70 kg) from placebo under a two-response (drug vs. placebo) drug discrimination procedure. Dose-effect curves for several drugs were then determined in a crossover design using the two-response procedure and a 'novel-response procedure' that provided a novel-appropriate response for drugs unlike triazolam or placebo. Three subjects were tested with triazolam (0.1-0.32 mg/70 kg), the barbiturate secobarbital (56-177 mg/70 kg), and caffeine (320 and 560 mg/70 kg). Triazolam dose dependently increased triazolam-appropriate responding under both procedures and generally did not occasion novel-appropriate responding under the novel-response procedure. Secobarbital substituted for triazolam in the two-response procedure and dose-dependently increased novel-appropriate responding as well as occasioned some triazolam-appropriate responding in the novel-response procedure. Caffeine generally occasioned placebo-appropriate responding under the two-response procedure and a mix of novel- and placebo-appropriate responding under the novel-response procedure. Triazolam and secobarbital produced qualitatively similar self-reported drug effects. These results suggest that the novel-response procedure for human drug discrimination may enhance the pharmacological selectivity of triazolam- and placebo-appropriate responding.", 
    "99": "Rats were trained to discriminate between ethanol (1.0 g/kg; 10% v/v) and saline under a fixed ratio 10 schedule of sweetened milk reinforcement. Both diazepam [nonselective, full benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors agonist] and bretazenil (nonselective, partial BZ receptor agonist) produced dose-dependent ethanol-appropriate responding (>75%). Neither diazepam nor bretazenil affected the response rate at the doses producing maximal generalisation from ethanol. In contrast, zolpidem (full BZ1 receptor agonist) and abecarnil (full BZ1/full or partial BZ2 receptor agonist) produced only moderate (<50%) ethanol-appropriate responding when tested up to doses that markedly decreased the overall response rate. These results suggest that: 1) there are no major differences between full and partial, nonselective BZ receptor agonists in their ability to substitute for 1.0 g/kg dose of ethanol; 2) stimulation of BZ1 receptors alone is not sufficient to produce ethanol-like discriminative stimulus effects in the rat.", 
    "100": "The effects of diazepam and the beta-carboline FG 7142 in chicks were examined on several behavioral measures in open-field and T-maze tasks. In the open field, only the higher doses of diazepam affected behavior, suggesting a sedative-like effect, while FG 7142 influenced behavior as would a fear-inducing manipulation. After a low dose of either drug was injected, testing in a T-maze showed that diazepam improved and FG 7142 impaired the escape performance from the isolation chamber, without affecting the time spent in the T-corridor. In three groups of chicks selected on the basis of their first escape performance, only lower performance chicks were affected by an anxiolytic dose of diazepam. T-maze results suggest that: (a) T-maze is more sensitive than open-field test to behavior changes induced by anxiolytic doses of diazepam; (b) isolation chamber behavior could be an index of general emotionality in young chicks; (c) diazepam and FG 7142 do not modify the social motivation to escape the maze; (d) higher performance chicks present an escape behavior of a less anxious type than lower performance chicks. The results suggest that the GABAergic system is involved in the behavioral expression of fear and anxiety in young chicks.", 
    "101": "The naturally occurring flavonoids, chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone) and apigenin (5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone), and the synthetic compound, 6,3'-dinitroflavone have been recently reported to selectively bind with high affinity to the central benzodiazepine receptor, and to exert powerful anxiolytic and other benzodiazepine-like effects in rats. Their chemical analog, quercetin, shares none of these effects. In the present article we find that, in contrast to diazepam, chrysin, apigenin, and 6,3'-dinitroflavone have no amnestic effect on acquisition or retention of three different learning tasks (inhibitory avoidance, shuttle avoidance, and habituation to an open field), even when given at doses higher than those previously reported to be anxiolytic. Apigenin had a slight enhancing effect on training session performance and, when given posttraining, on test session retention, of crossing responses in the open field and hindered retention of inhibitory avoidance, and showed no anxiolytic action in an elevated plus maze. Unlike diazepam, none of these drugs had any analgesic effect in the tail-flick test. The data suggest that chrysin, apigenin, and 6,3'-dinitroflavoine, three flavonoids derivatives possessing anxioselective effects acting on central benzodiazepine receptors, may deserve clinical trials as anxiolytic agents.", 
    "102": "The GABA-benzodiazepine neurotransmission has been implicated in various forms of plasticity such as kindling and learning. The present study examined the effects of clonazepam (CZP), a GABA-benzodiazepine agonist, on the development of behavioral sensitization to methamphetamine (MA). Rats treated with MA (1 mg/kg, S.C.) for 10 days displayed significantly enhanced motor activity when tested with MA (1 mg/kg) after a 7-8-day withdrawal, indicating the development of behavioral sensitization. Pretreatment with CZP (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg) prior to MA administration prevented the development of the phenomenon. Rats treated with CZP alone showed no difference in the motor activity compared to those treated with saline. These results suggest that stimulation of GABA-benzodiazepine receptors plays a role in the development of behavioral sensitization.", 
    "103": "Adult female rats, receiving a low protein diet at perinatal age and then recovered with balanced chow (D rats), were evaluated in the Open Field Drink Test (OFDT), after different acute and chronic treatments with benzodiazepines (BZD) ligands, as compared with control (C) female rats. Control and D rats showed similar reactivity to acute administration of diazepam (DZP, 1 mg/kg) and FG 7142 (2.5mg/kg), both BZD ligands with anxiolytic and anxiogenic effects, respectively. After chronic DZP treatment (3mg/kg/day i.p. for 3 weeks), C rats developed tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of DZP as well as withdrawal syndrome upon abrupt interruption of chronic treatment. On the contrary, D animals failed to develop tolerance to the anxiolytic effect of DZP, and did not show an increased anxiety upon withdrawal. The functionality of the GABAA receptor-complex, as measured by (36)Cl(-) uptake in cortical cerebral microsacs, was not altered in the DZP withdrawn rats. The lack of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome may be related to the incapacity of D rats to generate adaptive changes after chronic treatments. For instance, C rats showed a lower anxiety level in the OFDT after chronic vehicle administration, whereas D animals did not evidence such an adaptive response. Furthermore, D rats failed to respond to the anxiolytic effect of DZP after chronic vehicle treatment. These results reassert the deleterious effects of perinatal undernutrition on the capacity to develop adaptive responses to repeated drug administration or adequate stimuli.", 
    "104": "Mania is a common psychiatric syndrome characterized by pathological mood elevation, grandiose thinking and motor overactivity. Although current consensus upholds a true distinction between unipolar depression and bipolar disorders, the distinction between various bipolar sub-categories is still a matter for debate, as is the exact distinction between schizophrenia and mania. Most cases are functional in origin but many organic causes have been identified as well as iatrogenic causes from prescribed medication, particularly in susceptible individuals. The underlying aetiology is still poorly understood, although a number of biochemical abnormalities have recently been identified, and the evidence for a genetic role is strong. Its prevalence is universal, with some differences between gender and ethnicity reported, and it displays marked Axis I and II comorbidity. Treatment, both acute and long term, still relies on various traditional combinations of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines and mood stabilisers, particularly Lithium, which now appears to be less effective than previously thought and a shift towards using other mood stabilisers from the anticonvulsant class is now apparent. The exact role for psychological treatment remains unclear with more research required. Good medical management includes; adequate treatment, physical and laboratory investigations, dedicated follow-up and supervision by hospital psychiatrists and community-based care agencies.", 
    "105": "Benzodiazepine dependence remains a shadowy concept. Dependence undoubtedly exists but also acts as an umbrella concept for the underlying chronic morbidity associated with neurosis. Treatment should be directed at early detection and vigorous treatment of anxiety disorders; and an acceptance that long-term treatment may be necessary. Once benzodiazepine dependence is established, each patient requires careful evaluation to establish their unique problem and to institute individual treatment plans. Strategies for benzodiazepine withdrawal are documented but each has its own problems and success can only be achieved if underlying problems are dealt with as well as simply providing tranquilliser withdrawal.", 
    "106": "Centers for Disease Control (CDC) data indicate that the incidence of tetanus in the United States is highest among the elderly. Conventional therapies for the control of accompanying generalized muscle spasms include large doses of oral or intravenous GABA agonists as antispasticity agents. We describe a case of an elderly patient with severe symptoms of tetanus who developed a prolonged encephalopathy and ventilatory insufficiency with oral baclofen and benzodiazepine therapy. Intrathecal baclofen adequately controlled her severe extensor spasms, facilitated her ventilatory management, and did not compromise her mental status during her extended convalescence. Accordingly, we report the first placement of a permanent implanted infusion pump for this disease. This modality offers advantage for continuous long-term titration of medication for spasms or rigidity control without the systemic sedative effects of conventional therapy.", 
    "107": "Panic disorder is a chronic condition for many patients and can be socially, emotionally and occupationally disabling. Until recently, clomipramine and alprazolam were the only drugs approved for its treatment. While widely used in the US and Europe, both belong to drug classes (tricyclics and benzodiazepines) with well-recognised side effects that can be problematic and thus limit their use. Recently, paroxetine became the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to receive approval and licensing for panic disorder. The short- and long-term efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine in panic disorder has been established in clinical trials of almost 1,000 patients meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IIIR criteria for panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. In a 12-week double-blind study of 120 panic patients receiving standardised cognitive therapy, paroxetine was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing panic attack frequency. In a 12-week placebo-controlled comparison in 367 panic patients, paroxetine was at least as effective as clomipramine and better tolerated. There was also some evidence that paroxetine had an earlier onset of action than clomipramine. A 9-month extension of the placebo-controlled comparison with clomipramine showed that the efficacy of paroxetine and clomipramine is maintained when treatment is continued into the longer term. In a relapse prevention study, 105 responders to 3 months' treatment with paroxetine or placebo were re-randomised, either to continue existing treatment or to receive placebo for 3 months. Only 5% of patients who continued to take paroxetine experienced a relapse compared with 30% of those who switched to placebo (P = 0.002). Paroxetine was generally well tolerated. In the short-term trials, the frequency of withdrawals due to adverse events (7.3%) was lower than that for placebo (11.4%) or clomipramine (14.9%). In the longer term, the dropout rate due to adverse events increased in the clomipramine group (19.0%) but was unchanged in the paroxetine group (7.4%). Since most patients with panic disorder will require prolonged treatment, the long-term tolerability of paroxetine and its lack of potential for dependence are important advantages that will encourage good compliance with treatment and improve the quality of life of patients.", 
    "108": "Panic disorder is widespread in Australia, often in combination with other psychiatric conditions such as agoraphobia or major depression. Pharmacotherapy for panic disorder in Australia commenced with benzodiazepines, and later progressed to tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). More recently, treatment has moved towards use of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are effective and better tolerated. Paroxetine is the first drug of this class to receive approval for treatment of panic disorder in Australia.", 
    "109": "This double-blind study evaluated the impact of treatment with olanzapine compared with haloperidol, and placebo on improvements in symptomatology and quality of life in patients with a DSM-III-R diagnosis of schizophrenia. A total of 335 patients was randomized to five treatment groups; olanzapine 5 +/- 2.5 mg/day, olanzapine 10 +/- 2.5 mg/day, olanzapine 15 +/- 2.5 mg/day, haloperidol 15 +/- 5 mg/day, and placebo. Patients responding to treatment during the 6-week acute phase were eligible to enter a 46-week extension. Efficacy measures included the brief psychiatric rating scale total, scale for assessment of negative symptoms summary, and clinical global impressions severity scores. Quality of life was evaluated using the quality of life scale. Data analyzed after 24 weeks of therapy showed that olanzapine was significantly superior to placebo in reducing clinical severity and significantly superior to haloperidol in reducing negative symptoms in patients responding to acute treatment. Furthermore, improvement in quality of life was observed in olanzapine-treated responders.", 
    "110": "The effects of two memory-impairing drugs, ethanol and triazolam, on proactive interference (PI) in memory were studied. Following ingestion of either one of these drugs or a placebo, subjects studied an A-B list (e.g., BEE-WASP) of paired associates, followed by an A-C list (e.g., BEE-HONEY) on the interference trial, and a D-E list (e.g., KING-QUEEN) followed by an A-C list on the control trial. A PI effect was found in the data, such that subjects produced fewer correct second list targets on the interference trial than on the control trial. Neither ethanol nor triazolam was found to influence the size of the PI effect. However, both drugs were found to increase B intrusions on the test of the A-C list, to impair subjects' ability to produce more than one studied response for each cue word, and to impair the subjective experience of retrieved memory information. These data suggest that ethanol and triazolam impair an inhibitory process that normally operates as one component of intentional retrieval, playing an important role in the suppression of unwanted information during a memory task.",

    "115": "In this study, we examined the acute anticonvulsant spectrum of (1) dizocilpine (0.03-3 mg/kg), CGS 19755 (1-10 mg/kg), and 7-chlorokynurenic acid (1-100 nmol) (NMDA receptor/ionophore complex antagonists); (2) muscimol (0.1-10 nmol; direct GABA(A) agonist); (3) YM90K (3-10 mg/kg; AMPA receptor antagonist); and (4) diazepam (2 and 5 mg/kg) and carbamazepine (5 and 20 mg/kg), two standard anticonvulsants, using the partially-kindled hippocampal model for epileptic seizures in freely moving rats. The anticonvulsant effect of these compounds were assessed by determining (1) the afterdischarge (AD), which is indicative of the severity of the seizure and related to seizure maintenance, and (2) the pulse number threshold (PNT), which is indicative of the seizure threshold or initiation. In addition, ataxia, a measure of CNS dysfunction, was assessed for each compound. Overall, our results indicated that the anticonvulsant compounds examined could be classified into three categories based on effects on the AD and PNT: (1) elevation of PNT (carbamazepine, dizocilpine, CGS 19755 and 7-chlorokynurenic acid); (2) reduction of AD (diazepam and muscimol); and (3) mixed action, i.e., increased PNT and decreased AD (YM90K). Behavioral data indicated that all compounds, except carbamazepine, produced a dose- or concentration-dependent ataxia. Overall, our results suggest that NMDA receptors play a role in seizure initiation, whereas the GABA(A) receptors appear to be involved in seizure maintenance and AMPA receptors may be involved in both phenomena.", 
    "116": "The use of gel filtration chromatography with Sephadex as a separation medium was used in order to study flunitrazepam (FNTZ) partitioning into artificial model membranes consisting of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (dpPC) vesicles, under controlled temperature conditions. In this system two phenomena are taking place simultaneously: the ligand-liposome interaction and the lipid self-aggregation to form the liposome. The liposome-FNTZ interaction was evidenced by the non-enantiography of the first derivative of FNTZ elution peak in frontal chromatography through Sephadex G-75. On the other hand, the presence of FNTZ reduced liposomes mean size and increased their size dispersion as evidenced by molecular filtration through Sephadex G-200. The dpPC-buffer FNTZ partition coefficient determined in zonal chromatography through Sephadex G-10 increased about 33% when the temperature rose above the temperature of dpPC transition from the liquid crystalline to the fluid phase. Gel filtration chromatography seems a suitable technique to study lipid liposome-FNTZ interactions at a qualitative level. In addition, this technique has the advantage over other methods of giving the possibility of observing the mutual effects exerted between the drug and the self-aggregating structure.",

Despite the relatively high dosages of olanzapine used, there were no reports of parkinsonism, akathisia, or dystonia, and no patients required anticholinergic medication.", 
    "122": "This open study suggests that olanzapine may be effective and well tolerated for a substantial number of neuroleptic-resistant schizophrenic patients. Further blinded, controlled trials are needed to confirm our results.", 
    "123": "We have recently demonstrated that the inhibitory influence of the endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand octadecaneuropeptide (ODN) on gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) gene expression could be prevented by specific inhibitors of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5 alpha-reductase in adrenalectomized and castrated male rats, then suggesting an involvement of neurosteroids in the action of ODN on GnRH neurons. In order to study in detail the role of circulating steroids in the effect of ODN, we have evaluated the influence of adrenalectomy, castration and the combination of adrenalectomy and castration as well as the effect of dexamethasone administration in the response of GnRH gene expression to ODN in the male rat. The intracerebroventricular injection of ODN (4 h before sacrifice) produced a 36% decrease in the hybridization signal. Adrenalectomy induced a 21% decrease in GnRH mRNA levels. In the adrenalectomized rats, the injection of ODN increased by 11% the amounts of mRNA. As previously reported by our group, castration was found to enhance GnRH mRNA (15% over control values). In castrated animals, ODN produced an inhibitory effect in the hybridization signal which was of the same amplitude as that observed in sham-operated animals. Finally, the combination of adrenalectomy and castration resulted in a small but significant decrease in the hybridization signal, the values being intermediary between those observed after adrenalectomy and those obtained after castration. In these animals, ODN induced a 38% decrease in the amounts of GnRH mRNA. In animals that had been castrated and adrenalectomized, dexamethasone treatment during 4 days produced a 19% increase in hybridization signal. In these dexamethasone-treated animals, ODN produced the usual decrease (33%) in GnRH mRNA. These results demonstrate that gonadal hormones do not play a major role in the activation of the GABAA receptor complex by ODN. On the other hand, it clearly appears that glucocorticoids exert a tonic stimulatory influence on GnRH neuronal activity and are involved in the inhibitory effect of ODN. The mechanism of action of glucocorticoids, which seems complex since the influence of adrenalectomy on the ODN action can be prevented by orchidectomy, remains to be fully elucidated.", 
    "124": "Abuse of benzodiazepines among heroin addicts in Copenhagen. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent of benzodiazepine abuse among heroin addicts, and to examine whether the heroin addicts with and without benzodiazepine abuse differed socially and psychiatrically. Social and medical information was drawn from the records for 98 heroin addicts who were registered for treatment at the institution Distriktscenter Vestre between 1.2-30.9.1994. Information about psychiatric admissions was taken from the Danish Psychiatric Register. The results showed that the heroin addicts with and without benzodiazepine abuse do not differ with regard to psychiatric data and basic demographic data. However, addicts with concomitant benzodiazepine ab-use were worse off concerning housing conditions, employment criminal records and amount and type of heroin abuse, and are thus in need of a more concerted treatment effort.", 
    "125": "In this study, the treatment of aberrant behaviour in a mentally handicapped male had failed. No link between the behavioural disorder and social circumstances was found. The subject had epilepsy. This was assumed to be a possible cause of the disorder and on this basis the antiepileptic medication was changed. Clonazepam was added to carbamazepin, and haloperidol was discontinued. The aberrant behaviour stopped. It is argued whether this was due to anticonvulsive effects; or anxiolytic, muscle relaxing and sedative effects. No definite conclusion is offered, although some findings could suggest the first interpretation.", 
    "126": "Malignant catatonia, associated with different somatic and psychiatric disorders, is a rare, life-threatening syndrome. Immediate recognition and adequate treatment are essential and may be life-saving. We describe a case of malignant catatonia and discuss the clinical implications. Additionally, we review the recent literature regarding epidemiology, nosology, current pathophysiological concepts, differential diagnosis, and treatment recommendations.", 
    "127": "Blockade of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors in the anterior basolateral amygdala (BLA) with bicuculline methiodide results in an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and \"anxiety\" in rats. Glutamate receptors in the BLA are also reported to be involved in eliciting anxiety responses. The purpose of this study was to investigate the interaction between GABAergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation in the BLA. Male Wistar rts were implanted with femoral arterial catheters and bilateral chronic microinjection cannulae into the BLA. Each animal was injected with either artificial cerebrospinal fluid (100 nl), bicuculline methiodide (10 pmol/100 nl) or bicuculline methiodide + one dose of an antagonist of either the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor [AP5 (20 and 100 pmol) and dizocilpine (25 and 125 pmol)] or the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate ionotropic receptor [CNQX (10 and 50 pmol) and GYKI 52466 (50 and 250 pmol)]. Increases in heart rate, blood pressure and \"anxiety\" (as measured in the social interaction test) observed in rats after bicuculline methiodide injections into the BLA were blocked in a dose dependent manner with the concurrent injections of either N-methyl-D-aspartate or non-N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, suggesting that activation of both subtypes of glutamate ionotropic receptors may be necessary for the responses elicited by GABAA receptor blockade in the basolateral amygdala.", 
    "128": "The effects of midazolam, one of the most popular benzodiazepines, on synaptic transmissions were compared with intracellular recordings between CA1 pyramidal cells (CA1-PCs) and dentate gyrus granule cells (DG-GCs) in rat hippocampal slices. First, we studied the effects of midazolam on orthodromically evoked spikes, membrane properties and synaptic potentials. Secondly, the effects of a GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, were examined on membrane properties to determine whether or not the densities of GABA(A) receptors are different between CA1-PCs and DG-GCs. Midazolam (75 microM) markedly depressed orthodromically evoked spikes in CA1-PCs, compared with those in DG-GCs. A GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (10 microM), almost completely antagonized the depressant effects of midazolam on spike generation in CA1-PCs, whereas it had little effect on midazolam in dentate gyrus granule cells. Midazolam produced either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effects on resting membrane potentials (Vm) with an input resistance decrease in CA1-PCs, whereas it produced depolarized Vm in DG-GCs. Midazolam significantly increased the amplitude of monosynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in CA1-PCs, whereas midazolam slightly decreased these in DG-GCs. Midazolam significantly decreased the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials both in CA1-PCs and DG-GCs. Muscimol (100 microM) produced either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing effects on Vm with an input resistance decrease in CA1-PCs, and it depolarized Vm with an input resistance decrease in DG-GCs. These results demonstrate that midazolam has differential effects on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmissions in hippocampal neurons. The mechanism of this difference could be partly due to the different types of GABA(A) receptors between CA1-PCs and DG-GCs.", 
    "129": "The present study employed neuropharmacological and receptor binding protocols to determine if diazepam-sensitive (DS) gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA(A)) receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) participate in autonomic regulation of cardiovascular function. The first set of protocols was designed to determine if GABA(A) receptors in the NTS were functionally modulated by the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam. Mean arterial pressure and heart rate responses to microinjection of GABAergic substances into the NTS were examined in urethane-anesthetized rats. Microinjection of the GABA(A) agonist isoguvacine into the NTS increased mean arterial pressure and heart rate, and these effects were blocked by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline. Preadministration of diazepam into the NTS potentiated the pressor actions of isoguvacine and had variable effects on heart rate changes. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, blocked the diazepam-induced potentiation of the pressor response to isoguvacine. The second protocol employed receptor autoradiography to examine the presence of DS and diazepam-insensitive (DI) GABA(A) receptors in the NTS. Autoradiography confirmed that DS GABA(A) receptors were present in the NTS; however, no measurable levels of DI GABA(A) receptors were detected. We conclude that GABA(A)-mediated integration of central autonomic control in the NTS is mediated solely by DS GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "130": "Current methods for studying in vitro drug metabolism involve add-incubate-separate-measure approach. Separation of the desired analytes requires removal of protein which is typically accomplished by precipitation and centrifugation and extraction of the analytes into an organic phase. The analysis scheme then becomes more complex resulting in a decrease in precision and an increase in assay time. Microdialysis sampling circumvents these problems by allowing researchers to sample the reaction mixture periodically and obtain the complete metabolic profile. In the present study, microdialysis sampling was used to investigate Phase I metabolism of salicylic acid, diazepam and ibuprofen in rat liver microsomes. The major metabolites of these drugs were profiled by LC. Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax were obtained for the formation of diazepam metabolites by both microdialysis and conventional microsomal incubations and were in good agreement with the values reported in the literature. This study shows that microdialysis has considerable promise as a sampling technique for in vitro drug metabolism studies. By making minor modifications to the instruments, microdialysis can be applied to other in vitro systems such as isolated hepatocytes to study the Phase II metabolism or tissue slices to study drug distribution.", 
    "131": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic effective in the treatment of schizophrenic patients. After a 2- to 9-day placebo lead-in, 79 inpatients with schizophrenia according to DSM-III-R criteria were placed on an olanzapine dosage of 10 mg/day or 1 mg/day for up to 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained weekly during this period. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses of Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale rating scale data suggested a minimum effective therapeutic concentration of 9 ng/mL. Using an intent-to treat analysis, 45% of the patients with olanzapine plasma concentrations > or = 9.3 ng/mL responded (> or = 20% decrease in BPRS), whereas only 13% of the patients with concentrations < 9.3 ng/mL responded. Use of olanzapine plasma concentrations of > 9 ng/mL as a predictor for treatment response in acutely ill schizophrenic patients is practicable because this therapeutic marker significantly increases the likelihood of a patient responding to olanzapine.", 
    "132": "Recent publications imply the existence of associations between psychotropic drugs use and risk of suicide. Some studies have measured the tissue level of these drugs in suicide deaths, while others compared toxicity indices, defined as number of suicide deaths per million prescriptions for individual antidepressants. Few of these studies used unexposed controls. The objective of this cohort study was to evaluate suicide attempts in subjects recently exposed to benzodiazepines and/or antidepressants, as compared to unexposed controls.", 
    "133": "A population of 225,796 persons with prescriptions for benzodiazepines were selected from the Saskatchewan Health Data Bases. Controls consisted of 97,862 individuals who did not receive benzodiazepines.", 
    "134": "Stratifying the populations into antidepressant users and non-antidepressant users indicated that nonantidepressant users had statistically significant associations between suicide attempts and benzodiazepine use (odds ratio (OR) = 6.2), antipsychotic use, (OR = 2.6), and a history of past treatment for drug/alcohol abuse (OR = 13.4). Antidepressant users showed a statistically significant relation only with past treatment for drug/alcohol use (OR = 5.8). It is argued that the large OR for antidepressant use is due to confounding by indication. If so, the concept of toxicity index is misleading and should not be used.", 
    "135": "The association between benzodiazepine use and attempted suicide is especially high for nonantidepressant users, for the young, and for males. Whether this relationship is causal or not, physicians should be aware of the high potential for suicide attempts when prescribing benzodiazepines for patients in these high risk groups.",

    "137": "A randomized, controlled, nonblinded, crossover canine trial was performed to evaluate reversal of midazolam-induced respiratory depression by flumazenil when administered by alternative routes. Mongrel dogs were sedated with thiopental 19 mg/kg i.v., then tracheally intubated. With the dogs spontaneously breathing, tidal volume, end-tidal CO2, and O2 saturation were observed until a stable baseline was achieved. Incremental doses of midazolam were administered until respiratory depression (30% decline in tidal volume, 10% decrease in O2 saturation, and 15% increase in end-tidal CO2) occurred. Flumazenil was administered by a randomly selected route [0.2 mg followed 1 minute later by 0.3 mg i.v., sublingual (s.l.) or intramuscular (i.m.); or 1 mg followed 1 minute later by 1.5 mg per rectum (PR)]. Time to return to baseline respiratory functions was recorded (\"time to reversal\"). Each of 10 dogs was studied using all 4 routes of flumazenil administration with a washout period of at least 7 days. An additional dog served as a control (no flumazenil).",

    "140": "The GABAA receptor is the site of action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, as well as a number of pharmacologically important drugs such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and ethanol. The GABAA receptor is a pentameric complex composed of distinct polypeptides, which have been divided into five subunit classes on the basis of sequence homology. To date, 17 isoforms of the receptor have been identified and cloned in mammalian brain, and designated alpha 1-6, beta 1-4, gamma 1-4, delta and rho 1-2. In addition, several isoforms exist in alternatively spliced forms (for review see ref.). Studies on recombinant receptors have revealed that receptors constituted from different isoforms exhibit distinct pharmacological properties. For example, the alpha subunit class appears to be responsible for GABA enhancement of benzodiazepine binding. GABAA receptor function is modulated by benzodiazepine agonists such as flunitrazepam and diazepam, barbiturates, anaesthetics, neurosteroids, and ethanol. Chronic treatment of animals with many of these compounds can bring about profound changes in receptor expression and pharmacology. The RT/PCR assay described here was developed to quantify the alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 3 isoforms in the same assay. The amount of each isoform was quantified on the basis of a standard curve generated under identical PCR conditions to the target sequences. In this way it is possible to quantify multiple samples in each RT/PCR assay, thereby reducing inter-assay variability. The assay can be applied to quantify the expression of these isoforms in response to acute and chronic drug administration, or in particular disease states. Altered expression may reflect a corresponding change in protein synthesis, or an alteration of the subtype composition of GABAA receptor.",

    "142": "Age-related loss of strength contributes to impaired mobility and increases the risk of falls. Recent research has focused on 2 approaches to preventing age-related loss of strength--promoting physical activity and exercise (especially strength training) and using trophic factors to enhance muscle performance. Epidemiologic evidence strongly supports a role of regular physical activity in successful aging by preserving muscle performance, promoting mobility, and reducing fall risk. Randomized controlled trials provide convincing evidence that strength and endurance training improve muscle performance in older adults. Evidence is rapidly accumulating from randomized trials that endurance, strength, and balance training promote mobility and reduce fall risk, though exercise effects differ according to the type of exercise, details of the exercise program, and the target group of older adults. Because lifetime regular physical activity is recommended for all older adults, a reasonable strategy (especially for weak adults) is an activity program that includes strength training. In contrast, insufficient evidence exists to recommend the long-term use of trophic factors to preserve muscular performance. An intervention that merits additional study is avoiding the use of psychoactive drugs because drugs like benzodiazepines appear to be risk factors for inactivity and may have unrecognized direct effects on muscular performance. Because chronic illness is a risk factor for inactivity and disuse muscle atrophy, randomized trials comparing strength training with other interventions would be useful in understanding whether strength training has advantages in preserving muscle performance and improving health-related quality of life in a variety of chronic illnesses such as depressive illness.",

The estimated one-year risk of relapse with olanzapine was 28.6 percent, compared with 69.9 percent with placebo. Results were similar in the second study (N = 62); patients treated with standard-dose olanzapine had a significantly reduced risk of relapse (p = .018) over one year compared with patients treated with ineffective-dose olanzapine.

    "147": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are involved in various cellular functions, including steroidogenesis. The impact of these receptor ligands has been demonstrated mainly in steroidogenic cells. The aim of the present study was to assess in intact female rats the effect of chronic (21 days) administration of the PBR ligands PK 11195 (15 mg/kg) and Ro 5-4864 (5 mg/kg), the mixed ligand diazepam (5 mg/kg), and the central benzodiazepine receptor ligand clonazepam (1 mg/kg) on PBR binding characteristics in steroidogenic (ovary and adrenal) and non-steroidogenic (uterus and kidney) organs, as well as on serum hormonal steroids (estradiol, progesterone, and corticosterone). Selective and mixed PBR ligands up-regulated PBR density in the two steroidogenic organs, while Ro 5-4864 also induced elevation of the receptor density in the non-steroidogenic organs. In contrast to Ro 5-4864, PK 11195 treatment down-regulated renal PBR. Clonazepam elevated adrenal PBR. On the serum hormonal level, Ro 5-4864 suppressed estradiol secretion. The other ligands did not affect hormonal steroid levels. It appears that in female rats, at least at these doses and dosing schedules, there is no correlation between the impact of chronic in vivo exposure to these agents on PBR density and ovarian and adrenal hormone levels."
