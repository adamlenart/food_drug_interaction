Because these events may be a consequence of their ability to directly alter insulin secretion from pancreatic beta-cells, we determined the effects of several antipsychotics on cholinergic- and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from isolated rat islets. At concentrations encompassing therapeutically relevant levels, olanzapine and clozapine reduced insulin secretion stimulated by 10 micromol/l carbachol plus 7 mmol/l glucose. This inhibition of insulin secretion was paralleled by significant reductions in carbachol-potentiated inositol phosphate accumulation. In contrast, risperidone or ziprasidone had no adverse effect on cholinergic-induced insulin secretion or inositol phosphate accumulation. None of the compounds tested impaired the islet secretory responses to 8 mmol/l glucose alone. Finally, in vitro binding and functional data show that olanzapine and clozapine (unlike risperidone, ziprasidone, and haloperidol) are potent muscarinic M3 antagonists. These findings demonstrate that low concentrations of olanzapine and clozapine can markedly and selectively impair cholinergic-stimulated insulin secretion by blocking muscarinic M3 receptors, which could be one of the contributing factors to their higher risk for producing hyperglycemia and diabetes in humans.", 
    "1": "Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive chronic anxiety in association with many somatic symptoms. The disorder has pervasive effects on quality of life, including work, social and educational aspects and requires long-term therapy. Available studies in patients are the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition-revised and fourth edition, which have defined generalized anxiety disorder and demonstrate the efficacy of benzodiazepines, azapirones, some antidepressants and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines are effective anxiolytics for short-term use but are accompanied by many adverse events. The antidepressants, paroxetine and venlafaxine (Efexor), have demonstrated efficacy in patients with generalized anxiety disorder with mild side-effect profiles. They have the additional benefit of efficacy in depression, which frequently occurs comorbidly in these patients. Long-term efficacy has been shown with venlafaxine in the treatment of this chronic condition, confirming that as in depression, the goal must not just be remission beyond simple symptom resolution but also on to improved functioning and quality of life. Psychotherapy with applied relaxation, cognitive therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy show the most promise in resolving and maintaining treatment gains in the long-term. These approaches may be useful alone or in combination with adjunctive pharmacotherapy to achieve remission. Based on current evidence, the recommended approach to achieving long-term benefits for patients with generalized anxiety disorder is antidepressant therapy with paroxetine or venlafaxine in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy.", 
    "2": "Olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly & Co.) is an atypical antipsychotic medication with once-daily dosing that was originally developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. It has shown broad efficacy in the treatment of bipolar mixed and manic episodes, but is less effective in the treatment of bipolar depression. Double-blind studies have demonstrated a rapid onset of action in acute bipolar mania, significantly greater rates of response compared with placebo, and a remission rate of 88.3% in a 49-week open-label study. Diverse presentations of the illness responded well to olanzapine including patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorder, mixed episodes, as well as psychotic and nonpsychotic manias. Olanzapine monotherapy improved symptoms of depression related to its sedating and appetite-enhancing profile, but core symptoms such as depressed mood did not improve significantly. However, in combination with fluoxetine, bipolar depressed patients responded without an increased risk of mania. Weight gain and sedation are prominent adverse effects, and it has been associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia and glucose intolerance.", 
    "3": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the first-line treatment for panic disorder. They are effective and well tolerated. Although tricyclic antidepressants are equally effective, they are less well tolerated than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors can be efficacious but have a range of unwanted effects that preclude their use as first-line treatments. Benzodiazepines should be reserved for short-term use and for treatment-resistant patients who do not have a history of dependence and tolerance. Also, they can be combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the first weeks of treatment to tide the patient over before the onset of the response. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychologic treatment of first choice. The methods of combining drug and nondrug treatments need careful and thorough exploration.", 
    "4": "Unlike midazolam, melatonin premedication is not associated with cognitive impairment in adults despite its anxiolytic properties. The use of melatonin as a premedicant in children has not been reported. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compared the perioperative effects of different doses of melatonin and midazolam in children.", 
    "5": "Seven groups of children (n = 15 in each) were randomly assigned to receive one of the following premedicants. Midazolam 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mg kg(-1) orally, melatonin 0.1, 0.25 or 0.5 mg kg(-1) orally each mixed in 15 mg kg(-1) acetaminophen, or placebo only (15 mg kg(-1) acetaminophen). Anxiety and temperament were evaluated before and after administration of the study drug, on separation from parents and on the introduction of the anaesthesia mask. At week 2 postoperatively, the behaviour of the children was measured by the Post Hospitalization Behaviour Questionnaire.", 
    "6": "Melatonin or midazolam each in doses of 0.25 or 0.5 mg kg(-1) were equally effective as premedicants in alleviating separation anxiety and anxiety associated with the introduction of the anaesthesia mask. A trend was noted for midazolam to prolong recovery times as the dosage increased. The use of melatonin was associated with a lower incidence (P = 0.049) of excitement at 10 min postoperatively, and a lower incidence (P = 0.046) of sleep disturbance at week 2 postoperatively than that observed with midazolam and control groups. No postoperative excitement was noted in the melatonin groups at 20, 30 and 45 min.", 
    "7": "Melatonin was not only as effective as midazolam in alleviating preoperative anxiety in children, but it was also associated with a tendency towards faster recovery, lower incidence of excitement postoperatively and a lower incidence of sleep disturbance at week 2 postoperatively.", 
    "8": "A new multi-target screening (MTS) procedure for drugs in blood and urine for toxicological analysis has been developed using a hybrid triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (QTrap) for the fast detection and identification of 301 forensically important drugs, e.g. tranquilizers (benzodiazepines), hypnotics, drugs of abuse (opiates, cocaine, amphetamines, cannabinoids), antidepressants, neuroleptics, and some cardiac drugs, in one single liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis. Samples were extracted either with liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction. A multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) as survey scan and an enhanced product ion (EPI) scan as dependent scan were performed in an information-dependent acquisition (IDA) experiment. Finally, drug identification was carried out by library search with a newly developed MS/MS library based on EPI spectra at three different collision energies in positive mode. The advantage of this newly developed method is the possibility to detect and identify 301 drugs in one single LC/MS/MS run.", 
    "9": "Rabbit syndrome (RS) is a rare extrapyramidal side effect of antipsychotic treatment. It is characterized by involuntary, rhythmic dyskinesias of mouth and lips excluding the tongue, and is most common under typical neuroleptics. There are also several reports of the syndrome in patients with the atypical antipsychotics risperidone and aripiprazole. We report a 74 year-old patient suffering from a bipolar affective disorder, who developed a rabbit syndrome following the intake of 20 mg/d olanzapine. To our knowledge this is the first case report of a RS due to olanzapine.", 
    "10": "Recent laboratory studies showed that exposure to supraclinical concentrations of propofol can induce cell death of immature neurons. However, no data are available regarding the effects of clinically relevant concentrations of this agent on neuronal development. The authors addressed this issue by evaluating the effect of propofol on dendritic growth and arbor expansion of developing gamma-aminobutyric acid-positive (GABAergic) interneurons.", 
    "11": "Immature neuroblasts were isolated from the newborn rat subventricular zone and differentiated into GABAergic interneurons in culture. In addition to cell death, the effects of increasing concentrations and durations of propofol exposure on neuronal dendritic development were evaluated using the following morphologic parameters: total dendritic length, primary dendrites, branching point, and Scholl analysis.", 
    "12": "The authors demonstrate that propofol induced cell death of GABAergic neurons at concentrations of 50 microg/ml or greater. As little as 1 microg/ml propofol significantly altered several aspects of dendritic development, and as little as 4 h of exposure to this agent resulted in a persistent decrease in dendritic growth. In contrast, application of midazolam did not affect neuronal development.", 
    "13": "Short-term exposure of immature developing GABAergic neurons to clinically relevant concentrations of propofol can induce long-term changes in dendritic arbor development. These results suggest that propofol anesthesia during central nervous system development could interfere with the molecular mechanisms driving the differentiation of GABAergic neurons and thus could potentially lead to impairment of neural networks.", 
    "14": "Anesthetic agents that target gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors modulate cortical auditory evoked responses in vivo, but the cellular targets involved are unidentified. Also, for agents with multiple protein targets, the relative contribution of modulation of GABA(A) receptors to effects on cortical physiology is unclear. The authors compared effects of the GABA(A) receptor-specific drug midazolam with the volatile anesthetic isoflurane on spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in pyramidal cells of auditory cortex.", 
    "15": "Whole cell recordings were obtained in murine brain slices at 34 degrees C. GABA(A) sIPSCs were isolated by blocking ionotropic glutamate receptors. Effects of midazolam and isoflurane on time course, amplitude, and frequency of sIPSCs were measured.", 
    "16": "The authors detected no effect of midazolam at 0.01 microM on sIPSCs, whereas midazolam at 0.1 and 1 microM prolonged the decay of sIPSCs by approximately 25 and 70%, respectively. Isoflurane at 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mm prolonged sIPSCs by approximately 45, 150, and 240%, respectively. No drug-specific effects were observed on rise time or frequency of sIPSCs. Isoflurane at 0.5 mm caused a significant decrease in sIPSC amplitude.", 
    "17": "The dose dependence of isoflurane effects on GABA(A) sIPSCs in pyramidal cells is consistent with effects on auditory evoked response in vivo. By contrast, comparable effects of midazolam on GABA(A) sIPSCs arise at concentrations exceeding those currently thought to be achieved in vivo, suggesting that the cellular targets of midazolam reside elsewhere in the thalamocortical circuit or that the concentration of midazolam reached in the brain is higher than currently believed.", 
    "18": "Bz-423 is a 1,4-benzodiazepine that suppresses disease in lupus-prone mice by selectively killing pathogenic lymphocytes, and it is less toxic compared to current lupus drugs. Cells exposed to Bz-423 rapidly generate O(2)(-) within mitochondria, and this reactive oxygen species is the signal initiating apoptosis. Phage display screening revealed that Bz-423 binds to the oligomycin sensitivity conferring protein (OSCP) component of the mitochondrial F(1)F(0)-ATPase. Bz-423 inhibited the F(1)F(0)-ATPase in vitro, and reconstitution experiments demonstrated that inhibition was mediated by the OSCP. This target was further validated by generating cells with reduced OSCP expression using RNA interference and studying the sensitivity of these cells to Bz-423. Our findings help explain the efficacy and selectivity of Bz-423 for autoimmune lymphocytes and highlight the OSCP as a target to guide the development of novel lupus therapeutics.", 
    "19": "Target identification is one of the more difficult aspects of modern chemical genetics. In this issue of Chemistry & Biology, Johnson et al. provide a compelling case for going through the trouble. As a byproduct of their identification of the cellular target of an anti-lupus compound, they have uncovered a powerful tool for the characterization of a fascinating molecular machine, the F1F0-ATP synthase.", 
    "20": "Proteins involved in the intramitochondrial trafficking of cholesterol, the first step in steroidogenesis, such as the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), are upregulated in the nervous system after injury. Accordingly, a local increase in the levels of steroids, such as pregnenolone and progesterone, is observed following traumatic injury in the brain and spinal cord. The expression and activity of aromatase, the enzyme that synthesizes estradiol, is also increased in injured brain areas and its inhibition results in an increased neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that an increase in steroidogenesis is part of an overall mechanism used by the nervous tissue to cope with neurodegenerative conditions. Neural steroidogenesis is the result of a coordinated interaction of neurons and glia. For example, after neural injury, there is an upregulation of StAR in neurons and of PBR in microglia and astroglia. Aromatase is expressed in neurons under basal conditions and is upregulated in reactive astrocytes after injury. Some of the steroids produced by glia are neuroprotective. Progesterone and progesterone derivatives produced by Schwann cells, promote myelin formation and the remyelination and regeneration of injured nerves. In the central nervous system, the steroids produced by glia regulate synaptic function, affect anxiety, cognition, sleep and behavior, and exert neuroprotective and reparative roles. In addition, glial cells are targets for steroids and mediate some of the effects of these molecules on neurons, including the regulation of survival and regeneration.", 
    "21": "Within the diseased brain, glial cells and in particular, microglia, express a multimeric protein complex termed \"peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS)\" or \"peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)\". The expression of the PBBS is dependent on the functional state of the cell and in glial cells is triggered by a wide range of activating stimuli. In the healthy brain, the PBBS are nearly absent with the notable exception of the choroid plexus, ependymal layer, perivascular cells, central canal, possibly certain nuclei in the brainstem and layers in the cerebellum where a constitutive presence of the PBBS is found. Likewise, areas that due to the absence of the blood-brain barrier contain more active glial cells, such as the pituitary gland, or the area postrema at floor of the 4th ventricle show a degree of constitutive expression. The tight correlation of the parenchymal de novo expression of the PBBS with the presence of activated glial cells, that in turn are usually only found in tissue affected by progressive disease, establishes the PBBS as a generic marker for the detection and measurement of active disease processes in the brain. Specific radioligands of the PBBS for use in positron emission tomography (PET) may thus provide a sensitive in vivo index of neuropathological activity. Whilst prototype ligands for the PBBS are available, future research needs to focus on the development of new ligands with improved pharmacodynamic properties and the ability to discriminate between the different, still insufficiently understood functional states of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "22": "Cutaneous vasoconstriction in response to local cooling is normally greater in females than in males. Cold induces amplification of alpha2-adrenoceptor affinity for norepinephrine and increases reflex sympathetic thermoregulatory output. Benzodiazepines are drugs with very well-known binding to the central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Besides these effects they decrease sympathetic output and as it was shown in the last decade they act synergistically with alpha-adrenoceptors. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that the benzodiazepine diazepam interacts with an alpha-adrenoceptor mechanism at the level of microcirculation. We measured laser-Doppler blood flux changes provoked by local cooling before and after oral application of a low dose of diazepam (5 mg) in 9 healthy males and in 11 healthy females with regular menstrual cycles. The results of our experiments show that in females there is a significant reduction (ANOVA, p < 0.05) in laser-Doppler flux during the first four minutes of cooling after taking of diazepam. In males, there is no significant difference in the responses to cold before and after an application of diazepam. Our results suggest that diazepam, in addition to its well-known effect on BZ receptors may also interact with alpha2C-adrenoceptors in the vessel wall during local cooling.", 
    "23": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAA-Rs) are the major inhibitory receptors in the mammalian brain and are modulated by a number of sedative/hypnotic drugs including benzodiazepines and anesthetics. The significance of specific GABAA-Rs subunits with respect to behavior and in vivo drug responses is incompletely understood. The gamma2 subunit is highly expressed throughout the brain. Global gamma2 knockout mice are insensitive to the hypnotic effects of diazepam and die perinatally. Heterozygous gamma2 global knockout mice are viable and have increased anxiety-like behaviors. To further investigate the role of the gamma2 subunit in behavior and whole animal drug action, we used gene targeting to create a novel mouse line with attenuated gamma2 expression, i.e., gamma2 knockdown mice.", 
    "24": "Knockdown mice were created by inserting a neomycin resistance cassette into intron 8 of the gamma2 gene. Knockdown mice, on average, showed a 65% reduction of gamma2 subunit mRNA compared to controls; however gamma2 gene expression was highly variable in these mice, ranging from 10-95% of normal. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that gamma2 protein levels were also variably reduced. Pharmacological studies using autoradiography on frozen brain sections demonstrated that binding of the benzodiazepine site ligand Ro15-4513 was decreased in mutant mice compared to controls. Behaviorally, knockdown mice displayed enhanced anxiety-like behaviors on the elevated plus maze and forced novelty exploration tests. Surprisingly, mutant mice had an unaltered response to hypnotic doses of the benzodiazepine site ligands diazepam, midazolam and zolpidem as well as ethanol and pentobarbital. Lastly, we demonstrated that the gamma2 knockdown mouse line can be used to create gamma2 global knockout mice by crossing to a general deleter cre-expressing mouse line.", 
    "25": "We conclude that: 1) insertion of a neomycin resistance gene into intron 8 of the gamma2 gene variably reduced the amount of gamma2, and that 2) attenuated expression of gamma2 increased anxiety-like behaviors but did not lead to differences in the hypnotic response to benzodiazepine site ligands. This suggests that reduced synaptic inhibition can lead to a phenotype of increased anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, normal drug effects can be maintained despite a dramatic reduction in GABAA-R targets.",

Multistep synthesis starting from 5-nitroindole, via the Gould-Jacobs reaction to the quinoline nucleus, yielded key intermediates 9-chloro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinoline-8-carboxylates. The reaction of the latter with methyl-hydrazine and various phenyl-hydrazines furnished the final compounds. In order to confirm the expected tetracyclic 2-substituted-2H-pyrazolopyrroloquinolin-3-one structure, IR spectrophotometric, mono-1H and 13C and bi-dimensional spectrometric and HRMS analyses were carried out: all compounds were found to be 2-substituted 3-keto tautomers; compound 6 only differed because it turned out to be 1-methyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinolin-3-olo. The results of this work are consistent with those previously reported for PQs: 7-9 show high potency in displacing specific [3H]flunitrazepam from its receptor site; no compound was active in inhibiting the binding of [3H]PK 11195.

Two trials compared olanzapine IM with haloperidol IM (total n=482, 166 allocated to haloperidol). Studies found no differences between olanzapine IM and haloperidol by 2 hours for the outcome of 'no important clinical response' (2 RCTs, n= 482, RR 1.00 CI 0.73 to 1.38) neither was there a difference for needing repeat IM injections (2 RCTs, n=482, RR 0.99 CI 0.71 to 1.38). More people on haloperidol experienced akathisia over the five day oral period compared with olanzapine IM (1 RCT, n=257, RR 0.51 CI 0.32 to 0.80, NNT 6 CI 5 to 15) and fewer people allocated to olanzapine IM required anticholinergic medication by 24 hours compared with those given haloperidol IM (2 RCTs, n= 432, RR 0.20 CI 0.09 to 0.44, NNT 8 CI 7 to 11). Two trials compared olanzapine IM with lorazepam IM (total n=355, 119 allocated to lorazepam). For the outcome of 'no important clinical response' , there was no difference between people given olanzapine IM and those allocated to lorazepam at 2 hours (2 RCTs, n=355, RR 92 CI 0.66 to 1.30) but fewer people allocated to olanzapine IM required additional injections by 24 hours compared with those on lorazepam IM (2 RCTs, n=355, RR 0.68 CI 0.49 to 0.95, NNT 10 CI 6 to 59). People receiving IM olanzapine were less likely to experience any treatment emergent adverse events, than those on lorazepam (1 RCT, n=150, RR at 24 hours 0.62 CI 0.43 to 0.89, NNT 5 CI 4 to 17) and over the same time period there were no clear differences in the use of anticholinergic medication between groups (1 RCT, n=150, RR 1.16 CI 0.38 to 3.58).No studies reported outcomes related to hospital and service use. Nor did any report on issues of satisfaction with care or suicide, self-harm or harm to others. No studies evaluated the oro-dispersable form of olanzapine.", 
    "55": "Data relevant to the effects of olanzapine IM are taken from some studies that may not be considered ethical in many places, all are funded by a company with a pecuniary interest in the result. These studies often poorly report outcomes that are difficult to interpret for routine care. Other important outcomes are not recorded at all. Nevertheless, olanzapine IM probably has some value in helping manage acute aggression or agitation, especially where it is necessary to avoid some of the older, better, known treatments. Olanzapine causes fewer movement disorders than haloperidol and more than lorazepam. The value of the oro-dipersable velotab preparation is untested in trials. There is a need for well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies in this area. Such studies are possible and, we argue, should be designed with the patient groups and clinicians in mind. They should report outcomes of relevance to the management of people at this difficult point in their illness.",

    "61": "Fifty five trials are included (total n>10000 people with schizophrenia). Attrition from olanzapine versus placebo studies was >50% by six weeks, leaving interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine appeared superior to placebo at six weeks for the outcome of 'no important clinical response' (any dose, 2 RCTs n=418, RR 0.88 CI 0.8 to 0.1, NNT 8 CI 5 to 27). Although dizziness and dry mouth were reported more frequently in the olanzapine-treated group, this did not reach statistical significance. The olanzapine group gained more weight. When compared with typical antipsychotic drugs, data from several small trials are incomplete. With high attrition in both groups (14 RCTs, n=3344, 38% attrition by six weeks, RR 0.81 CI 0.65 to 1.02) the assumptions included in all data are considerable. For the short term outcome of 'no important clinical response', olanzapine seems as effective as typical antipsychotics (4 RCTs, n=2778, RR 0.90 CI 0.76 to 1.06). People allocated olanzapine experienced fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than those given typical antipsychotics. Weight change data for the short term are not statistically significant but results between three to 12 months suggest a clinically important average gain of four kilograms for people given olanzapine (4 RCTs, n=186, WMD 4.62, CI 0.6 to 8.64). Twenty three percent of people in trials of olanzapine and other atypical drugs left by eight weeks; 48% by three to12 months (11 RCTs, n=1847, RR 0.91 CI 0.82 to 1.00). There is little to choose between the atypicals, although olanzapine may cause fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than other drugs in this category. Olanzapine produces more weight gain than other atypicals with some differences reaching conventional levels of statistical significance (1 RCT, n=980, RR gain at 2 years 1.73 CI 1.49 to 2.00, NNH 5 CI 4 to 7). There are very few data for people with first episode illness (1 RCT, duration 6 weeks, n=42). For people with treatment-resistant illness there were no clear differences between olanzapine and clozapine (4 RCTs, n=457).", 
    "62": "The large proportion of participants leaving studies early in these trials makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions on olanzapine's clinical effects. For people with schizophrenia it may offer antipsychotic efficacy with fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than typical drugs, but more weight gain. There is a need for further large, long-term randomised trials with more comprehensive data.",

The median recovery time was 87 min, with no association with age, sex, or dosage of sedation, but was longer in patients having hallucination (p=0.001). Adverse effects included tachycardia (27.9%), increased secretion (17.6%), agitation (13.6%), nausea and vomiting (9.2%), hallucination (8.7%), desaturation (8.4%), and cataleptic reaction (0.8%).

The binding sites were identified using phenylbutazone and diazepam as site-specific probes for sites I and II, respectively, and each enantiomer was found to bind to both sites. Incorporation of a chiral HPLC column into the on-line system permitted the investigation of enantiomer-enantiomer interactions, which revealed that both enantiomers competitively bind to the same binding sites without significant allosteric effects.", 
    "70": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) is a major determinant of the metabolism of many drugs, including important anticancer drugs, with sometimes profound impact on therapeutic efficacy and toxic side effects. To study in vivo CYP3A(4) functions, we have generated and characterized transgenic mice with functional expression of human CYP3A4 cDNA in the liver. Two transgenic lines displayed substantial, physiologically relevant and stable CYP3A4 levels in liver and moderate levels in kidney, but not in small intestine. The mice did not display obvious physiological abnormalities. The CYP3A4 substrate drugs midazolam and cyclosporin A were used to test functional activity of CYP3A4 in liver. The area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) of intravenously administered midazolam (30 mg/kg) was 2.2-fold decreased in the transgenic mice compared with wild-type (5.45 +/- 0.21 versus 11.7 +/- 0.46 microg . h ml(-1); P < 0.01), and early formation of the primary metabolite 1-hydroxymidazolam was about 2-fold increased, demonstrating the functionality of CYP3A4 in the liver. Similarly, following intravenous administration of cyclosporin A (20 mg/kg), CYP3A4 transgenic mice displayed a reduced plasma AUC compared with wild-type (24.3 +/- 0.66 versus 35.8 +/- 0.53 microg . h ml(-) (1); P < 0.01). Thus, midazolam and cyclosporin A, compounds with markedly different clearance rates and half-lives, both demonstrated clearly accelerated kinetics in the CYP3A4 transgenic mice. We expect that this CYP3A4 transgenic model will provide a useful tool to study the impact of CYP3A4 on drug levels, especially when combined with other transgenic and knockout strains.", 
    "71": "Patients in methadone maintenance programs use benzodiazepines to \"boost\" methadone's subjective effects, and flunitrazepam has been prominent in this context. Self-administration of flunitrazepam (0.001-0.32 mg/kg i.v.) alone and during daily oral methadone administration was evaluated in three baboons. Flunitrazepam maintained self-injection as an inverted U-shaped function of dose at rates higher than those maintained by most other benzodiazepines under the same procedure. In the context of demonstrated physical dependence on 3.2 mg/kg/day p.o. methadone, flunitrazepam doses on the ascending limb of the dose-effect curve maintained greater rates of self-injection than before methadone in two baboons. When the methadone dose decreased to 1.8 mg/kg/day, self-injection remained higher for those baboons and became higher than before methadone for the third baboon. Self-injection remained higher when methadone decreased to 1.0 mg/kg/day, except self-injection of the lowest flunitrazepam dose returned to or below the pre-methadone rate for two baboons. After methadone was discontinued, the dose-effect curve shifted to the right in one baboon but remained to the left in two. Flunitrazepam thus served as a reinforcer alone and in the context of methadone maintenance. Lower doses maintained higher self-injection during and shortly after methadone maintenance. Further research should explore the duration of higher self-injection rates following methadone maintenance.",

    "73": "Five to ten percent of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases are associated with mutations of the superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene, and the 'D90A' mutation is associated with a unique phenotype and markedly slower disease progression (mean survival time 14 years). Relative sparing of inhibitory cortical neuronal circuits might be one mechanism contributing to the slower progression in patients homozygous for the D90A mutation (homD90A). The GABA(A) receptor PET ligand [11C]flumazenil has demonstrated motor and extra-motor cortical changes in sporadic ALS. In this study, we used [11C]flumazenil PET to explore differences in the pattern of cortical involvement between sporadic and genetically homogeneous ALS groups. Twenty-four sporadic ALS (sALS) and 10 homD90A patients underwent [11C]flumazenil PET of the brain. In addition, two subjects homozygous for the D90A mutation, but without symptoms or signs ('pre-symptomatic', psD90A), also underwent imaging. Results for each group were compared with those for 24 healthy controls of similar age. Decreases in the binding of [11C]flumazenil in the sALS group were found within premotor regions, motor cortex and posterior motor association areas. In the homD90A group of ALS patients, however, decreases were concentrated in the left fronto-temporal junction and anterior cingulate gyrus. In the two psD90A subjects, a small focus of reduced [11C]flumazenil binding at the left fronto-temporal junction was seen, similar to the pattern seen in the clinically affected patients. Within the sALS group, there was no statistically significant association between decreases in cortical [11C]flumazenil binding and revised ALS functional rating scale (ALSFRS-R score), whereas the upper motor neuron (UMN) score correlated with widespread and marked cortical decreases over the dominant hemisphere. In the homD90A group, there was a stronger statistical association between reduced cortical [11C]flumazenil binding and the ALSFRS-R, rather than the UMN, score, and also with disease duration. This study provides evidence for differences in the distribution of reduced cortical [11C]flumazenil binding in homD90A compared with sALS patients. We hypothesize that this might reflect differences in cortical neuronal vulnerability.", 
    "74": "Although evidence suggests that 5-HT(2A) and muscarinic M1/M4 receptors are implicated in the pathology of schizophrenia, the results are not conclusive. In the present study we tested the hypothesis that binding of 5-HT(2A) and M1/M4 receptors is altered in the postmortem brain of schizophrenia subjects. Quantitative autoradiography was employed to measure [(3)H]ketanserin binding to 5-HT(2A) receptors and [(3)H]pirenzepine binding to both M1 and M4 receptors in Brodmann's area 9 (BA9), caudate/putamen, and the hippocampal formation from six schizophrenic and six control subjects. A significant reduction in the density of 5HT(2A) receptors in BA 9 of schizophrenic subjects was observed (p=0.036). No significant difference was observed in the density of 5HT(2A) receptors in the hippocampus or caudate/putamen between the two groups. No significant changes in the density of M1/M4 receptors was observed in these three regions between the two groups. These findings support a possible involvement of the serotonergic system in the pathology of schizophrenia.", 
    "75": "Performance of the Roche Online KIMS (kinetic interaction of microparticles in solution) benzodiazepine (BZD) immunoassay (IA) with and without beta-glucuronidase treatment was evaluated on a Hitachi Modular automated IA analyzer calibrated using nordiazepam at 100 ng/mL. Reproducibility, linearity, accuracy, sensitivity, and interferences were evaluated. Precision of the assay (percent coefficient of variation (%CV)) with and without addition of the enzyme was less than 6% and 9%, respectively, with linearity (r(2) value of 0.9578 and 0.9746), respectively. Between-run precision of a 125 ng/mL nordiazepam control (n = 287) over 67 days, produced a %CV of 13.6% for the hydrolytic assay. Modification of the BZD assay to include automated hydrolysis of urinary BZD glucuronide conjugates was evaluated using three glucuronidated BZD standards prepared at concentrations ranging from 250 to 10,000 ng/mL. With hydrolysis, temazepam, oxazepam, and lorazepam glucuronides, produced cross-reactivities of 25%, 15%, and 20%, respectively. Without hydrolysis, the glucuronidated BZD standards produced less than 1% cross-reactivity in the assay. The ability of the assay to differentiate between positive and negative samples was evaluated by assaying 20 negative urine samples and serial dilutions of certified drug-free urine fortified with 28 different BZDs. All of the negative and positive urine samples produced the appropriate screening result. Cross-reactivities of 27 different BZDs, calculated as the normalized IA response divided by the BZD concentration that produced a response approximately equivalent to the response of a 100 ng/mL nordiazepam standard and multiplied by 100, ranged from 15% to 149%. Human urine samples (n = 28) that were previously found to contain BZDs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) also produced a positive BZD IA result. The IA was challenged with 78 potentially interfering compounds, and none produced a positive BZD response. As a part of the validation, a large number of human urine samples (29,500) were assayed using the modified Online BZD IA method to evaluate the performance of the method in production. Of the 29,500 samples tested, 80 produced a positive IA result. Analysis by GC-MS confirmed the presence of at least 1 BZD compound in 61 of the samples corresponding to a confirmation rate of 76%. The Online BZD IA modified by the automatic addition of beta-glucuronidase appears well adapted for the rapid detection of BZDs and their metabolites in human urine.",

Median intravenous meperidine and midazolam sedation dose was 62.5 mg and 2.5 mg, respectively. Maximum pancreatic juice flow occurred during the early phase of secretion and maximum bicarbonate concentration occurred during the late phase of secretion. Analysis of the electrolyte composition of the endoscopically collected duodenal drainage fluid revealed a constant cation concentration for both sodium and potassium over the 1 h collection period. The anions, chloride and bicarbonate, exhibited a reciprocal relationship identical to that seen in traditional gastroduodenal tube collection studies. There was no statistical difference observed between the sedation and no sedation groups. The estimated total bicarbonate output (area under curve, AUC) for the sedated and non-sedated groups were 5,017 meq + 724 (range 3,663-6,173) and 5,364 meq +/- 583 (range 4,323-6563) respectively (p= 0.0656).

    "87": "Alcohol consumption is known to induce hepatic CYP2E1 activity, but its effect on hepatic and intestinal CYP3A in humans is not known. We have conducted a study to compare the CYP2E1 and CYP3A activities in 20 individuals with moderate alcohol consumption and 20 gender-, race-. and body mass index (BMI)-matched nonalcoholics. Intravenous and oral midazolam (MDZ) clearances were used to measure the in vivo CYP3A activity, and chlorzoxazone (CHZ) oral clearance was used to assess in vivo CYP2E1 activity. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between hepatic CYP2E1 and CYP3A activities and their messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the peripheral lymphocytes. The systemic clearance (CL) of MDZ was not different between alcoholics (36.9 +/- 12 L/hr) and nonalcoholics (36.6 +/- 14.1; P = .9). The oral availability of MDZ was significantly lower in alcoholics than in the nonalcoholics (0.28 +/- .09 vs. 0.38 +/- .17, respectively, P = .03). The maximum serum concentration after oral midazolam dosing was significantly different between the 2 groups. CHZ CL was significantly higher in alcoholics than in nonalcoholics (31.5 +/- 11.9 vs. 23.4 +/- 8.7 L/hr, P < 0.05). CYP3A4 and CYP2E1 mRNA levels were not significantly different between the groups, and no correlation was observed between lymphocyte CYP mRNA and in vivo CYP activity. In conclusion, in individuals with moderate alcohol consumption, there was no alteration in the hepatic CYP3A activity, but the reduced midazolam oral bioavailability suggests that moderate alcohol consumption may cause intestinal CYP3A induction. Lymphocyte CYP2E1 and CYP3A4 mRNA levels did not correlate with CYP2E1 and CYP3A activities.",

    "89": "Medication plays a central role in the treatment of panic disorder, with the goal of eliminating panic attacks and restoring normal function (i.e., achieving full remission). Four drug classes have similar efficacy (tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], benzodiazepines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Nonetheless, benzodiazepines remain the most prescribed medication for panic disorder in the United States. The high-potency benzodiaze-pines alprazolam (available as immediate- and extended-release tablets) and clonazepam (available as tablets and orally disintegrating wafers) are the only benzodiazepines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of panic disorder. High-potency benzodiaze-pines, with their proven efficacy in panic disorder exerted through control of the central nervous system excitability by a selective and potent enhancement of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid-mediated neurotransmission, are also a safe and well-tolerated option for potentiation of rapid treatment response when initiating treatment with SSRIs. Judicious use of high-potency benzodiazepines followed by a cautious taper and discontinuation may optimize the benefits and minimize any potential risk associated with this class of drugs.", 
    "90": "Frontal electromyography (FEMG) may increase during painful stimulation and indicate patient arousal. The Datex-Ohmeda Entropy Module calculates state entropy (SE) of the electroencephalogram (EEG; 0.8-32 Hz) and response entropy (RE) of EEG and FEMG (0.8-47 Hz). We determined whether RE increases above SE (RE--SE), an indication of FEMG, increase during painful stimuli and if this is related to paralysis or level of anesthesia. With the unanesthetized baseline measurement, SE was 89 +/- 2 and RE was 98 +/- 2. During paralysis and anesthesia with either 0.8% (n = 10) or 1.4% (n = 10) isoflurane, SE decreased to 63 +/- 7 and 34 +/- 14, respectively, and the RE--SE difference decreased 90%. Before recovery from paralysis, arterial catheter or head pin placement increased RE--SE above unanesthetized levels in eight patients (five treated with 0.8% and three with 1.4% isoflurane), consistent with an increase in FEMG. The elevated RE--SE difference was related to a significant increase in SE, blood pressure, and heart rate. After recovery from paralysis, tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve increased the RE--SE difference above unanesthetized levels in 8 of 20 patients (6 treated with 0.8% and 2 with 1.4% isoflurane). In these patients, SE increased significantly. The remaining 12 patients did not show an increase in RE--SE during tetanic stimulation and SE did not increase. We conclude that increased RE during painful stimulation was not dependent on recovery from paralysis but was seen more often in patients anesthetized with 0.8% compared with 1.4% isoflurane. This suggests that RE reflects FEMG and may be useful to identify inadequate anesthesia and patient arousal during painful stimuli.", 
    "91": "Several reports have demonstrated the alleviation of hepatic encephalopathy by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors. As changes in central monoaminergic activity are involved in the mechanisms for hepatic encephalopathy, the effects of flumazenil on central monoaminergic activity were evaluated in acute hepatic failure produced by ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. Eighteen male Wistar rats were evenly assigned to three groups: sham-operated group given saline, liver-ischemic group given saline, and liver-ischemic group given flumazenil. Flumazenil (1 mg/kg) or saline (10 mL/kg) was intraperitoneally administered three times, at 1, 6, and 24 hours after 90 minutes of liver ischemia produced by occlusion of the left portal vein. The extracellular concentrations of neurotransmitter amino acids, monoamines, and their metabolites were determined in the striatum using a microdialysis procedure. Another set of 12 rats was subjected to liver ischemia, and the effect of flumazenil on spontaneous motor activity was examined after 24 hours. The extracellular concentration of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, a metabolite of dopamine, decreased to 39% of that in sham-operated animals 24 hours after surgery (P < 0.05), although the dopamine level did not change. The treatment with flumazenil completely abolished the decrease in the metabolite (P < 0.05). Although the glutamate level in the injured animals decreased to 42% of that in sham-operated animals (P < 0.05), no remarkable increase in the glutamate level was observed in animals treated with flumazenil. Spontaneous motor activity decreased 24 hours after surgery in animals subjected to liver ischemia. Flumazenil led to improvement of spontaneous motor activity 5 minutes after administration, but this effect was not observed after 30 minutes. The restoration of the central dopaminergic function may be a contributing factor in the improvement of hepatic encephalopathy.", 
    "92": "Muscle spasm and hypertonia limit mobility in children with spastic cerebral palsy. This double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled clinical trial studies the clinical efficacy of a low dose of diazepam in enhancing movement in children with spastic cerebral palsy. One hundred and eighty children fulfilled the criteria and were randomly allocated to receive one of two doses of diazepam or placebo at bedtime; 173 completed the study. There was a significant reduction of hypertonia, improvement in the range of passive movement, and an increase in spontaneous movement in the children who received diazepam. There was no report of daytime drowsiness. In developing countries, where cost factors often determine choice of drug, diazepam is a cheap and effective way of relieving spasm and stiffness, optimizing physical therapy and facilitating movement in children with spasticity.", 
    "93": "During a first episode of psychosis, treatment with antipsychotic drugs can improve both positive and negative symptoms. If sufficient amelioration does not occur, adding psychotropic comedication may result in a favorable outcome. To establish sex differences in psychotropic comedication use, we conducted an exploratory retrospective study among first-break patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder. Concerning patient characteristics, no difference in age or antipsychotic drug use was established. At admission, men significantly more often had comorbid substance abuse. Analysis showed that significantly more women than men received benzodiazepines after the onset of psychosis (OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.13-1.27). No sex difference was found in antidepressant comedication (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.48-3.11). We established a definite sex difference in concomitant benzodiazepine use in first-break patients with schizophrenia. Since women have a better prognosis, we suggest further research to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early benzodiazepine use in the course of schizophrenia. Furthermore, we recommend investigating the possible correlation between benzodiazepine use and substance abuse as a way of treating premorbid symptoms of schizophrenia.", 
    "94": "It has been recently reported the presence in Valeriana of the flavone 6-methylapigenin and the flavanone glycoside hesperidin. The apigenin derivative is a ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site in the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABA(A)) and has anxiolytic properties. Hesperidin has sedative and sleep-enhancing properties but is not a ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site. 6-Methylapigenin is able to potentiate the sleep-enhancing effect of hesperidin. In this work we demonstrate that this property is shared with various GABA(A) receptor ligands, among them the agonist diazepam, which was used to study the potentiation as measured in the hole board test. Isobolar analysis of the results showed the interaction being synergistic. We discarded pharmacokinetic effects or a direct action of hesperidin on the benzodiazepine binding site. A possible use of hesperidin properties to decrease the effective therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines is suggested.", 
    "95": "6-Methylflavanone acted as a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses at human recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2L, alpha2beta2gamma2L and alpha1beta2 GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. It was essentially inactive at rho1 GABA(C) receptors. The EC50 values for 6-methylflavanone for the positive modulation of the EC(10-20) GABA responses were 22 microM, 10 microM and 6 microM and the maximum potentiations were 120%, 417% and 130% at alpha1beta2gamma2L, alpha2beta2gamma2L and alpha1beta2 GABA(A) receptors respectively. Thus 6-methylflavanone was much more efficacious as a positive modulator at alpha2beta2gamma2L than at alpha1beta2gamma2L and alpha1beta2 GABA(A) receptors. This may be significant since diazepam-induced anxiolysis is considered to be mediated via alpha2-containing GABA(A) receptors, while sedation is thought to be mediated via alpha1-containing GABA(A) receptors. We have previously reported that 6-methylflavone (1-100 microM) produced positive allosteric modulation at alpha1beta2gamma2L and alpha1beta2 GABA(A) receptors with no significant difference between the enhancement seen at either receptor subtype. In the present study, 6-methylflavone was tested at alpha2beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors and found to maximally potentiate the EC(10-20) GABA response by 183+/-39% which is similar to that previously observed for 6-methylflavone at alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors. Thus, 6-methylflavone did not show a preference for alpha2beta2gamma2L over alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors in terms of efficacy. Compared to 6-methylflavone, 6-methylflavanone is more efficacious as a positive allosteric modulator at alpha2beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors, and less efficacious at alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors. This may represent a relatively unique type of selectivity for positive modulators of GABA-A receptor subtypes based on efficacy as distinct from potency. As was previously shown for 6-methylflavone at alpha1beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors, the positive modulation of GABA responses at alpha1beta2gamma2L and alpha2beta2gamma2L GABA(A) receptors by 6-methylflavanone was insensitive to antagonism by flumazenil, indicating that this action is not mediated via \"high-affinity\" benzodiazepine sites.", 
    "96": "Monitoring respiratory rate, effort and efficacy of ventilation during pain management and sedation can be difficult in the field. Capnography is an ideal monitor for use during the administration of narcotics and benzodiazepines. The addition of EtCO2 monitoring enables earlier identification of respiratory depression in this group of patients. Standard vital signs, oxygen saturation and EtCO2 must also be monitored continuously. End-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, although not required on all patients, provides an earlier indication of respiratory depression than pulse oximetry and respiratory rate alone.", 
    "97": "The central hemodynamics was studied and analyzed in 51 patients reoperated on for congenital spinal cord hernia under balanced anesthesia based on midasolam and proforol. The procedure for anesthesiological provision of replastic repair of operated spinal hernia, which is based on propofol of bolus administration of midasolam with a hypnotic appliance, was found to cause no negative hemodynamic effects. When the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenyl is used, the interval between the end of surgery and tracheal extubation is virtually identical in the propofol and midasolam groups since the intravenous injection of flumazenyl induces a drastic awakening effect.", 
    "98": "To evaluate the potential interaction of 20 mg paroxetine and 1 mg alprazolam (early morning once-daily administration) on polysomnographic (PSG) sleep and subjective sleep and awakening quality, both after a single intake and after reaching a steady-state concentration.", 
    "99": "Twenty-two (11 for the PSG) healthy young volunteers of both sexes with no history of sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index <5) participated in a double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, repeated-dose, 4-period, cross-over study. All volunteers received all 4 treatment sequences: paroxetine-alprazolam placebo (PAP); paroxetine placebo-alprazolam (PPA); paroxetine-alprazolam (PA), and paroxetine placebo-alprazolam placebo (PLA), in a randomized order. Each treatment was administered over 15 consecutive days, with a treatment-free interval of 7 days prior to the subsequent study period. In each experimental period, one PSG sleep study was performed on the 1st night (single-dose effects) and another study was performed on the 15th night (repeated-dose effects). Additionally, two other PSG studies were assessed: an adaptation recording, and a control night recording. All-night PSG recordings were obtained following standard procedures. Each 30-second period was scored according to the criteria of Rechtschaffen and Kales by means of an automatic sleep analysis system: Somnolyzer 24x7. A self-rating scale for sleep and awakening quality and early morning behavior was completed no later than 15 min after awakening over the 15 days of each experimental intervention. General lineal models (treatment/time) were applied separately to each variable.", 
    "100": "(1) No significant effects were observed in any sleep variables when control nights were compared with the 1st night with PLA. (2) Sleep continuity: After PAP a clear awakening effect was seen both in the first and second evaluations, mainly in wake time, movement time, number of awakenings and stage-1 duration. After PPA an evident hypnotic effect was observed on night 1. This effect was mainly observed in maintenance variables and slightly in sleep initiation variables; it had decreased by night 15. After PA an intermediate behavior in the variables related to sleep continuity was seen, highlighting the absence of the tolerance phenomenon observed when PPA was administered alone. (3) Sleep architecture: The most important effects in REM sleep were observed after PAP; an increase in REM latency and decreases in REM sleep. PAP also induced decreases in the number of non-REM and REM periods and increases in the average duration of non-REM periods and sleep cycles. PA presented a similar pattern to PAP, and PPA similar to PLA. In relation to non-REM sleep, PA showed more stage-2 and less slow-wave sleep (SWS). (4) Subjective perception: No significant differences were observed between treatments while they were being taken, but impairments in subjective sleep quality, awaking quality, latency and efficiency were seen, mainly after PA but also after PPA discontinuations.", 
    "101": "The combination of PAP and PPA presented an intermediate pattern in relation to sleep continuity, with less awaking effect than PAP alone and less hypnotic effect than PPA alone, and without developing tolerance. The PAP and PPA combination also showed a similar effect to PAP on REM sleep and was the treatment with the longest stage 2 and shortest SWS. No subjective sleep and awakening effects were seen during drug intake but subjective withdrawal reports were seen after abrupt interruption. The high agreement rate for the epoch-by-epoch comparison between automatic and human scoring confirms the validity of the Somnolyzer 24x7 and thus facilitates sleep studies in neuropsychopharmacological research.", 
    "102": "The brain and the peripheral (hormonal) angiotensin II systems are stimulated during stress. Activation of brain angiotensin II AT(1) receptors is required for the stress-induced hormone secretion, including CRH, ACTH, corticoids and vasopressin, and for stimulation of the central sympathetic activity. Long-term peripheral administration of the angiotensin II AT(1) antagonist candesartan blocks not only peripheral but also brain AT(1) receptors, prevents the hormonal and sympathoadrenal response to isolation stress and prevents the formation of stress-induced gastric ulcers. The mechanisms responsible for the prevention of stress-induced ulcers by the AT(1) receptor antagonist include protection from the stress-induced ischemia and inflammation (neutrophil infiltration and increase in ICAM-1 and TNF-alpha) in the gastric mucosa and a partial blockade of the stress-induced sympathoadrenal stimulation, while the protective effect of the glucocorticoid release during stress is maintained. AT(1) receptor antagonism prevents the stress-induced decrease in cortical CRH(1) and benzodiazepine binding and is anxiolytic. Blockade of brain angiotensin II AT(1) receptors offers a novel therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of anxiety and other stress-related disorders.", 
    "103": "Computing has become an integral part of many disciplines nowadays, turning it into an evermore necessary working tool. Internet provides a fast and easy way to collect scientific data and is becoming a more and more effective and safe way to transmit data. It is also an efficient means for interaction and information sharing within a work group that provides the necessary flexibility. A pilot project was conducted replacing the traditional hardcopy version of the case report form for an electronic one (e-CRF) and with access to Internet within the Naturalistic Randomized Clinical Trial of the Effectiveness of Olanzapine and Risperidone in the Treatment of Schizophrenia. Carrying out this pilot project has given us the opportunity to determine the advantages electronic data collection (EDC) by Internet has to offer both researchers and sponsors. The results have optimized time management, since it is easier to work in real time; data quality is improved, since intermediates are eliminated, and it facilitates communication amongst the different parties involved in the project. The use of this technology requires updated Internet connections and adequate personal computers, since the possibilities offered by the computer system and high-speed connection are critical in conducting the project. Obviously, this may involve a higher initial investment, but the results have revealed to us that these start-up costs are later offset by lowering personnel costs or by decreasing the number of monitoring visits. On the basis of our experience and that of the participating investigators, certain recommendations for future clinical trials using e-CRF can be made. We will go into these recommendations in greater depth throughout this paper. In short, EDC can dramatically improve the clinical trial process, opening the door to new technologies in the world of clinical research, not only for sponsors, but also for clinicians.", 
    "104": "Although rapid bedside toxicological screening is reliable, it has not been validated in the emergency department (ED) setting. We assessed the accuracy of a 10-min bedside immunoassay, Triage Panel (TP), for 7 drugs of abuse and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) in ED patients suspected of drug toxicity. This was a prospective observational study conducted at an urban teaching ED (100,000 visits/year) of patients suspected of drug toxicity during a 7-month period. The assay was compared for agreement with combined SYVA EMIT and TLC. GC/MS or HPLC was used for analyzing sensitivity and specificity in discordant findings. A total of 172 cases (ages 0.6-73 years) were screened with TP, and 100 (58%) were found to be positive for at least one drug. Sensitivity (proportion and 95% CI) was as follows: cocaine 30/31 (90.6-100%), phencyclidine no cases, THC 21/24 (80.1-94.3), opiates 14/14 (100), amphetamines 1/1 (NA), barbiturates 10/10 (100), benzodiazepines 20/21 (90.5-99.9), and TCA 13/13 (100). Specificity was above 98% for every drug except TCAs (which was 95%), partly due to interference from iminostilbene (a carbamazepine metabolite) in three cases. Agreement between TP and hospital laboratory was over 90% for every drug class. Both benzodiazepines and THC showed significant disagreement between the two testing modalities. In conclusion, in a series of ED patients suspected of drug toxicity, the TP was an accurate tool to rule out the presence of seven drugs of abuse and TCAs. Further testing will be required to verify the efficacy of the test in populations with a higher prevalence of phencyclidine and amphetamine abuse.", 
    "105": "Recently we have described the antidyskinetic property of the GABA mimetic drugs valproic acid and topiramate on reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia. In this respect, oral dyskinesia has been associated with important neuropathologies. The present study investigates the effects of different doses of the GABA(A) agonist tetrahydroisoxazolopyridine (THIP), of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen as well as of the GABA(A) modulator diazepam on the manifestation of reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia. Male Wistar rats received two injections of vehicle or of 1mg/kg reserpine separated by 48 h. Twenty-four hours later, animals were acutely treated with vehicle or THIP (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg), baclofen (1, 2 or 4 mg/kg) or diazepam (1, 2 or 4 mg/kg) and were observed for quantification of oral dyskinesia and open-field general activity. In order to verify the effects of these drugs per se on spontaneous oral movements, male Wistar rats were acutely treated with vehicle, 8 mg/kg THIP, 4 mg/kg baclofen or 4 mg/kg diazepam and observed for quantification of oral dyskinesia. The two highest doses of THIP or of baclofen abolished the manifestation of reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia while the lowest dose of baclofen attenuated it. Diazepam did not modify reserpine-induced oral dyskinesia at any dose tested. The highest doses of these drugs did not modify spontaneous oral movements. Reserpine-induced decrease in open-field general activity was not modified by any of the doses of THIP and diazepam or by the two lowest doses of baclofen. The highest dose of baclofen potentiated the increase in the duration of immobility induced by reserpine. These results reinforce the involvement of GABAergic hypofunction in the expression of oral dyskinesias, and support the potential therapeutic use of THIP and baclofen in the treatment of oral dyskinesias.",

When anesthesia was induced with 7% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen, qualities of mask induction and sedation were rated. Anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane (3-5%) in 100% oxygen. During emergence from anesthesia, the score of the child's emergence behavior was rated.",

    "111": "We investigated the pattern of use of BDZs among 65- to 84-year-old attenders at 40 Italian primary care practices who answered positively in a questionnaire on the use of anxiolytic/hypnotic drugs and successfully completed the PRIME-MD questionnaire. The survey lasted 6 months, from February to July 2001.", 
    "112": "Of the 1,156 subjects who completed the PRIME-MD, 748 subjects were positive for at least one psychiatric diagnosis. A depressive disorder was present in 36.5% of all PRIME-MD completers and in about one-third of cases represented by major depression, whereas anxiety disorders, somatoform disorders and alcohol abuse accounted for 18.2%, 8.1% and 1.7% of all PRIME-MD completers, respectively. Most patients were first prescribed BDZs by their General Practitioners (GPs) for each diagnostic group. However, patients with pure anxiety started BDZ treatment during hospitalisation more often (19.7%) than patients with depressive disorders (13.7 %). Moreover, patients with comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders (CADD) were most likely to receive their first BDZ prescription from a psychiatrist (15.7 %). Sleep disturbances were present in at least 50% of cases (and up to 86 %) in each diagnostic group. About 75% of prescriptions concerned anxiolytic BDZ or medium/long-acting BDZ. Most patients with anxiety, CADD and depression used night-time BDZ (65.2%, 56.9 % and 60.5%, respectively). The prevalence of chronic use of BDZs was equally high in all categories of psychiatric disorder (about 90 % for each), showing that the vast majority of patients, irrespective of the diagnosis, had been using BDZs for years.", 
    "113": "BDZs are widely prescribed for elderly people by their GPs, often for a considerable length of time. The evidence that many BDZ consumers suffer from a depressive or an anxiety disorder, or both, could be a starting point for encouraging a rational prescription in accordance with international guidelines.", 
    "114": "The in vivo metabolic mechanism of quetiapine (QTP) with clinical therapeutic dose was studied. Nineteen patients received multiple doses of QTP with or without concomitant erythromycin. Midazolam was given to detect enzyme activity. Plasma Concentrations of QTP, midazolam, and their metabolites were measured at specified time intervals. In presence of erythromycin, activity of CYP3A4 decreased significantly; for QTP, C(max), AUC(0-24), and t(1/2) increased significantly, CL decreased significantly, and variations in AUC(0-24) and CL showed, respectively, significant negative and positive correlation to that of CYP3A4 activity; for QTP sulfoxide (QTP-SF), C(max) and AUC(0-24) decreased significantly, t(1/2) increased significantly, and variation of t(1/2) was significantly positively correlated to that of CYP3A4 activity; for 7-hydroxy-quetiapine (QTP-H), t(1/2) increased significantly and was closely correlated to CYP3A4 activity; for 7-hydroxy-N-desalkyl-quetiapine (QTP-ND), C(max) and AUC(0-24) decreased significantly, and variation of AUC(0-24) was significantly positively correlated to that of CYP3A4 activity. In conclusion, the major metabolic pathway of QTP is sulfoxidation. CYP3A4 is the primary enzyme responsible for CYP-mediated metabolism of QTP in clinical therapy dosage in vivo. QTP sulfoxidation and N-dealkylation are mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4. 7-Hydroxylation of QTP is not mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4. The metabolism of QTP-SF and QTP-H is mainly catalyzed by CYP3A4, but QTP-ND is not by CYP3A4.", 
    "115": "Anxiety states, including those arising during acute or protracted withdrawal periods, may be precipitating factors in alcoholic relapse. Given the cyclical nature of ethanol withdrawal associated with repeated cycles of ethanol intake and abstinence in a pattern that often spans years, meaningful attempts to model ethanol withdrawal-associated anxiety should incorporate cycled ethanol treatments. The studies reported herein examined the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid-modulating drugs on social interaction behavior-an established model of anxiety-in rats exposed to repeated cycles of ethanol treatment and withdrawal.", 
    "116": "Rats were exposed to 8 to 12 g/kg/day ethanol during three 7-day dietary cycles (5 days on ethanol diet followed by 2 days on control diet). Ethanol was administered either at hour 4 of withdrawal after cessation of each of the first 2 ethanol cycles or during the final withdrawal only. In other groups, the early withdrawals were treated with alphaxalone, diazepam, PK11159, or flumazenil to block anxiety-like behavior during an untreated later (third) withdrawal. The benzodiazepine inverse agonist DMCM (methyl-6, 7-dymerhoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) was also given repeatedly to determine whether it would sensitize anxiety-like behavior during a future withdrawal. Finally, the effects of all drugs on deficits in locomotor behavior were assessed.", 
    "117": "Pretreatment of earlier withdrawals with alphaxalone, diazepam, ethanol, or flumazenil reduced social interaction deficits during a later withdrawal, but pretreatment with PK11195 did not. In contrast, DMCM administered in lieu of early withdrawals increased social interaction deficits during an untreated later withdrawal. Locomotor deficits were significantly reversed only by the acute ethanol and diazepam treatment during the final withdrawal.", 
    "118": "Single-dose administration of drugs that enhance or diminish activity at benzodiazepine-gamma-aminobutyric acid- receptors during earlier withdrawals reduced or potentiated, respectively, anxiety-like behavior during later, drug-free withdrawals. These results support the potential of the novel strategy of using prophylactic therapy administered during early withdrawals to ameliorate symptoms of later withdrawals.",

Volatile agents have been shown to simulate IP providing extra protection to the myocardium during adult cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) while propofol seems to act through different mechanisms. IP has not been investigated in the paediatric population to the same extent. Cardiac troponin T (cTnT) is a reliable marker of myocardial injury in neonates and children. We have investigated the relationship between three anaesthetic agents, midazolam, propofol, and sevoflurane, and postoperative production of cTnT.",

Eight hours after admission to the intensive care unit cTnT concentrations tended to be higher in the midazolam group [mean (95% confidence intervals)]; 2.7 (1.9-3.5) ng ml(-1). Patients receiving a propofol-based anaesthesia had similar concentrations 2.6 (1.7-3.5) ng ml(-1) while those receiving sevoflurane tended to have a lower cTnT production 1.7 (1.3-2.2) ng ml(-1).",

    "123": "We have previously shown a decrease in [(3)H]pirenzepine binding to M1/M4 muscarinic receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia but not in major depression or bipolar disorder. The present study aimed to extend these findings by examining the binding of [(3)H]AF-DX 384 to M2/M4 receptors in the same cohort of subjects. Using quantitative autoradiography we measured [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding in the anterior cingulate cortex of 15 schizophrenia, 15 bipolar, 15 major depression and 15 control cases. Post-mortem tissue was obtained from the Stanley Foundation Brain Bank. [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding had a homogenous distribution amongst the layers of the anterior cingulate cortex, was higher in males than in females and declined with prolonged storage of tissue. An inverse correlation between [(3)H]AF-DX384 binding and age of onset of the disease was observed in the schizophrenia group suggesting that the earlier the age at onset the higher the binding was. In the depression group, there was a significant effect of gender on [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding with females having lower binding in comparison to males. In the bipolar group, there was a significant inverse correlation between antipsychotic medication and [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding, suggesting that the higher the dose of medication the lower the binding was. No differences in [(3)H]AF-DX 384 binding were seen between the four groups. The present results provide no evidence of M2/M4 receptor alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex in schizophrenia and affective disorders and extend the body of evidence implicating cortical M1 but not M2 involvement in the pathology and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia.", 
    "124": "The key points of this article are anorexia and cachexia are: A major cause of cancer deaths. Several drugs are available to treat anorexia and cachexia. Dyspnea in cancer usually is caused by several factors. Treatment consists of reversing underlying causes, empiric bronchodilators, cortico-steroids--and in the terminally ill patients-opioids, benzodiazepines,and chlorpromazine. Delirium is associated with advanced cancer. Empiric treatment with neuroleptics while evaluating for reversible causes is a reasonable approach to management. Nausea and vomiting are caused by extra-abdominal factors (drugs,electrolyte abnormalities, central nervous system metastases) or intra-abdominal factors (gastroparesis, ileus, gastric outlet obstruction, bowel obstruction). The pattern of nausea and vomiting differs depending upon whether the cause is extra- or intra-abdominal. Reversible causes should be sought and empiric metoclopramide or haloperidol should be initiated. Fatigue may be caused by anemia, depression, endocrine abnormalities,or electrolyte disturbances that should be treated before using empiric methylphenidate. Constipation should be treated with laxatives and stool softeners. Both should start with the first opioid dose.", 
    "125": "There is a large experience in premedication with clonidine (Catapresan) for general anaesthesia. Clonidine is an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist exerting central sympatholytic effects. Premedication with clonidine blunts the stress response to surgical stimuli and the narcotic and anaesthetic dose can be reduced. Furthermore, perioperative myocardial ischemic events can be prevented by preoperative application of clonidine. Oral clonidine at a dose of 1.5-2 microg/kg BW combines the advantages of benzodiazepines and morphine: anxiolysis, sedation and analgesia with stable hemodynamics and respiration. Clonidine does not have morphine related side effects such as nausea and vomiting. Doses of up to 5 microg/kg BW have been administered to young and healthy patients preoperatively in dental and maxillofacial surgery without significant side effects. However, Clonidine 2 microg/kg BW should be an adequate oral premedication dose for young and healthy patients scheduled for dental and facial surgery procedures performed under local anaesthesia in the ambulatory setting. In elderly patients clonidine 2 microg/kg BW administered orally should not be exceeded to avoid excessive hypotension and sedation. Bradycardia is a contraindication for the use of clonidine.", 
    "126": "In the past years an ongoing controversial debate exists in Germany, regarding quality of the coroner's inquest and declaration of death by physicians. We report the case of a 90-year old female, who was found after an unknown time following a suicide attempt with benzodiazepine. The examination of the patient showed livores (mortis?) on the left forearm and left lower leg. Moreover, rigor (mortis?) of the left arm was apparent which prevented arm flexion and extension. The hypothermic patient with insufficient respiration was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Chest compressions were not performed, because central pulses were (hardly) palpable and a sinus bradycardia 45/min (AV-block 2 degrees and sole premature ventricular complexes) was present. After placement of an intravenous line (17 G, external jugular vein) the hemodynamic situation was stabilized with intermittent boli of epinephrine and with sodium bicarbonate. With improved circulation livores and rigor disappeared. In the present case a minimal central circulation was noted, which could be stabilized, despite the presence of certain signs of death ( livores and rigor mortis). Considering the finding of an abrogated peripheral perfusion (livores), we postulate a centripetal collapse of glycogen and ATP supply in the patients left arm (rigor), which was restored after resuscitation and reperfusion. Thus, it appears that livores and rigor are not sensitive enough to exclude a vita minima, in particular in hypothermic patients with intoxications. Consequently a careful ABC-check should be performed even in the presence of apparently certain signs of death, to avoid underdiagnosing a vita minima. Additional ECG- monitoring is required to reduce the rate of false positive declarations of death. To what extent basic life support by paramedics should commence when rigor and livores are present until physician DNR order, deserves further discussion.",

All drugs were intravenously infused over 30 minutes. Plasma adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam concentrations, electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in the beta (12-30 Hz) range, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), and subjective measures of mood and sedation were monitored for 12 to 24 hours. Mean pharmacokinetic parameters for adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam, respectively, were as follows: volume of distribution (L), 106, 100, and 77; elimination half-life (hours), 2.9, 2.8, and 14.6; and clearance (mL/min), 444, 321, and 84. More than 80% of the total infused adinazolam dose was converted to systemically appearing NDMAD. All 3 benzodiazepine agonists significantly increased beta EEG activity, with alprazolam showing the strongest agonist activity and adinazolam showing the weakest activity. Alprazolam and NDMAD significantly decreased DSST performance, whereas adinazolam had no effect relative to placebo. Adinazolam, NDMAD, and alprazolam all produced significant observer-rated sedation. Plots of EEG effect versus plasma alprazolam concentration demonstrated counterclockwise hysteresis, consistent with an effect site delay. This was incorporated into a kinetic-dynamic model in which hypothetical effect site concentration was related to pharmacodynamic EEG effect via the sigmoid E(max) model, yielding an effect site equilibration half-life of 4.8 minutes. The exponential effect model described NDMAD pharmacokinetics and EEG pharmacodynamics. The relation of both alprazolam and NDMAD plasma concentrations to DSST performance could be described by a modified exponential model. Pharmacokinetic-dynamic modeling was not possible for adinazolam, as the data did not conform to any known concentration-effect model. Collectively, these results indicate that the benzodiazepine-like effects occurring after adinazolam administration are mediated by mainly NDMAD.", 
    "128": "Oxycodone is a potent semi-synthetic narcotic prescribed for the management of pain. Previous investigators have reported that the abuse of oxycodone is most frequently seen in conjunction with the abuse of other drugs, although fatalities have been reported with oxycodone alone. We undertook a retrospective review of cases investigated by the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office in which postmortem toxicologic studies indicated the presence of oxycodone. A total of 172 consecutive cases were studied, including 18 in which death was attributed to oxycodone toxicity, 117 to combined drug toxicity, 23 to trauma, 9 to natural causes and 5 to another drug or drugs. The postmortem blood concentrations of oxycodone overlapped among the groups. The mean blood oxycodone concentration among the cases of oxycodone toxicity was 0.69 mg/L, combined drug toxicity 0.72 mg/L and trauma 0.62 mg/L. Concentrations were lower in cases of deaths attributed to natural causes and to another drug or drugs (mean each 0.087 mg/L). Benzodiazepines, detected in 96 cases, were the most common co-intoxicants in the cases of combined drug toxicity, followed by cocaine, which was found in 41. The most frequently encountered benzodiazepine was alprazolam. This study confirms that deaths in which oxycodone is a factor are most commonly cases of combined drug toxicity. The high incidence of alprazolam as a co-intoxicant has not been previously recognized.",

Seventy-six patients who participated in a randomized clinical trial of two different gradual withdrawal treatment approaches were assessed. The trial was conducted between February 1995 and July 1999. The mean age +/- SD of subjects was 40.0 +/- 9.6 years, 55% were male, 38% were married or cohabiting, and 70% had received more than nine years of education. The median benzodiazepine dose was 35 mg/day (range 2.5-180) in diazepam equivalents. The median duration of benzodiazepine use was 84 (range 8-360) months. Subjects with lower benzodiazepine doses and no previous withdrawal attempts were more successful at benzodiazepine discontinuation. Cluster B personality/borderline personality disorder was associated with an inability to stop benzodiazepine use and with \"dropping out\" of treatment. Alcohol use-related disorders or other psychiatric diagnoses were not associated with outcome. Further studies on predictors of successful benzodiazepine discontinuation in different populations are required. Patients manifesting cluster B personality/borderline personality disorder and benzodiazepine dependence may need concomitant treatment for their personality disorders to benefit from benzodiazepine discontinuation treatment.",

All subjects received a single oral dose of zolpidem (10 mg), triazolam (0.25 mg) or placebo at 9 P.M.: and slept for 7.5+/-0.2 h. The effect of sleep on memory was investigated by comparing the performance of this group of volunteers with a group of 21 subjects in wakefulness condition. Declarative memory was evaluated by using a free-recall test of ten standard word and seven nonword lists. Subjects memorized the word and nonword lists 1 h before dosing and they were asked to recall the memorized lists 10 h after dosing.

Moreover, the action of diazepam and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), having the opposite effect on GABA(A) receptors, was evaluated on the exploratory behaviour in these mice. Expression levels of GABA(A) receptor subunit genes were also measured.",

The action of diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg i.p.) and DMCM (0.25-1 mg/kg i.p.) was studied in the light-dark box. The effect of DMCM was also evaluated in the motor activity test to demonstrate that its anti-exploratory action was not related to motor suppression. Expression levels of GABA(A) receptor subunit genes were determined by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).", 
    "157": "Female mice lacking CCK(2) receptors displayed increased exploratory activity in the light-dark box compared to their wild-type (+/+) littermates. Locomotor activity in the motility boxes and the intensity of freezing did not differ in wild-type (+/+) and homozygous (-/-) mice. Treatment with diazepam (0.5 mg/kg) increased the number of transitions in wild-type (+/+) animals, whereas in homozygous (-/-) mice diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg) reduced exploratory activity. Administration of DMCM (0.25-1 mg/kg) induced an anxiogenic-like effect in homozygous (-/-) mice, but did not change their locomotor activity.

To date, few laboratory studies have examined the acute, dose-related effects of benzodiazepines on human risk-taking behavior. Recent data indicate that in the United States alprazolam is the benzodiazepine most frequently misused for recreational purposes.",

Furthermore, this investigation sought to examine: (1) the behavioral mechanisms that may be involved in changes in the probability of risky decision making related to alprazolam administration and (2) risk seeking-related personality variables that may predict drug effects on risk taking.", 
    "161": "Using a laboratory measure of risk taking designed to address acute drug effects, 16 adults were administered placebo, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg alprazolam in a within-subject repeated-measures design. The risk-taking task presented subjects with a choice between two response options operationally defined as risky and nonrisky. Data analyses examined subjective effects, response rates, distribution of choices between the risky and nonrisky option, trial-by-trial response probabilities, and personality correlates related to drug effects at the 2.0-mg dose.", 
    "162": "Alprazolam administration produced dose-related changes in subjective effects, response rates, and, most importantly, dose-dependently increased selection of the risky response option. The 2.0-mg dose increased the probability of making consecutive risky responses following a gain on the risky response option. Increases at 2.0 mg were related to a combination of personality scales that included high venturesomeness and novelty seeking and low harm avoidance.", 
    "163": "Alprazolam administration produced increases in human risk taking under laboratory conditions. In union with previous studies, the observed shift in trial-by-trial response probabilities suggests that sensitivity to consequences (e.g., oversensitivity to recent rewards) may be an important mechanism in the psychopharmacology of risky decision making. Additionally, risk-seeking personality traits may be predictive of acute drug effects on risk-taking behavior.", 
    "164": "Muscle over-activity is one of the cardinal features of spasticity and it is a common disability of stroke patients. In this group, spasticity is responsible for several limitations that interfere in their daily activities and quality of life. To treat spasticity, neurologists usually prescribe drugs as baclofen, tizanidine or benzodiazepines or even use definitive treatment as phenol or surgery. Authors suggest the use of botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) for spasticity in the upper limbs after stroke, but there are few papers with adequate methodology supporting this idea. In this article we summarize the data of previous double-blind, randomised clinical trials to asses, with a meta-analysis, if BTX-A is an adequate treatment for spasticity due to stroke. The results show a statistical superiority of BTX-A ov%r placebo on reducing muscle tone by the Modified Ashworth Scale (WMD= 0.95 [0.74 to 1.17]) in patients with post-stroke upper limb spasticity.", 
    "165": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP1) facilitates DNA repair by binding to DNA breaks and attracting DNA repair proteins to the site of damage. Nevertheless, PARP1-/- mice are viable, fertile and do not develop early onset tumours. Here, we show that PARP inhibitors trigger gamma-H2AX and RAD51 foci formation. We propose that, in the absence of PARP1, spontaneous single-strand breaks collapse replication forks and trigger homologous recombination for repair. Furthermore, we show that BRCA2-deficient cells, as a result of their deficiency in homologous recombination, are acutely sensitive to PARP inhibitors, presumably because resultant collapsed replication forks are no longer repaired. Thus, PARP1 activity is essential in homologous recombination-deficient BRCA2 mutant cells. We exploit this requirement in order to kill BRCA2-deficient tumours by PARP inhibition alone. Treatment with PARP inhibitors is likely to be highly tumour specific, because only the tumours (which are BRCA2-/-) in BRCA2+/- patients are defective in homologous recombination. The use of an inhibitor of a DNA repair enzyme alone to selectively kill a tumour, in the absence of an exogenous DNA-damaging agent, represents a new concept in cancer treatment.", 
    "166": "Procedural sedation and analgesia has become a commonplace procedure in the ED, certainly falling under the domain of the EP. Every EP should approach PSA as a complex procedure requiring high-level skills and knowledge. Initially, understand that PSA represents a spectrum of goals, from anxiolysis and pain relief to deep sedation. Assess the needs of the patient and the concomitant procedure and set goals accordingly. There is a pharmacopia of drugs that provide sedation and analgesia. Become familiar with their pharmacology, advantages and disadvantages, and indications. This will allow for appropriate usage and achievement of sedation goals. Several drugs that are commonly used for general anesthesia are proving themselves to be safe and efficacious for PSA. Both etomidate and propofol have emerged as useful drugs for PSA. Continued research and practice with these agents will add to our understanding and help define their use for PSA. Performing PSA as a procedure itself requires preparedness, diligent monitoring, and risk awareness. Knowing the patient's comorbid state and choosing agents that will not exacerbate their baseline status minimize risk. Following fasting guidelines is appropriate in certain clinical situations, and is prudent when time permits. However, these guidelines are a benchmark for minimizing risk and are not supported by evidence-based medicine. It is important to be cognizant of the guidelines but also to identify the emergency scenario where action must be taken despite the fasting guidelines. Controlling sedation depth also minimizes the risk of aspiration and other complications. The ETCO2 monitor and Bispectral Index may prove to be useful adjuncts for monitoring sedation depth. However, there is nothing yet that measures sedation depth quantitatively that can replace the qualitative assessment of the EP. More and more PSA is falling under the domain of the EP. It is important for the EP to be involved in hospital policy and guidelines associated with this procedure, and to remain aware of new research in this field. EPs can thereby contribute to quality assurance throughout the medical community by setting a standard in the practice of PSA, as they are not the only practitioners using this procedure. With continued practice and research, expertise in this field will grow measurably.",

The skeleton of these compounds was designed by formally combining the N-C=O moieties of the known BzR ligands, triazoloquinoxalines (IV) and triazinobenzimidazoles (ATBIs) (VI). Most of the PTBTs displayed submicromolar/nanomolar potency at the BzR. The 9-chloro derivatives (45-49) were generally found to be more potent than their 9-unsubstituted counterparts (37-44). Compound 45 turned out to be the most potent of the PTBTs (K(i) 2.8 nM). A subset of compounds (37, 42, 45, 49), when tested for their affinity on recombinant rat alpha1beta2gamma2, alpha2beta2gamma2, and alpha5beta3gamma2 GABA(A)/Bz receptor subtypes, showed enhanced affinities for the alpha1beta2gamma2 isoform, with compounds 45 and 49 exhibiting the highest selectivity. Moreover, compounds 45 and 49 were found to display a full agonist efficacy profile at alpha1 and alpha2 receptor subtypes, and an antagonist efficacy at alpha5-containing receptors.",

Advances in managing head trauma have allowed more patients to emerge from decreased levels of consciousness and helped them cope with neurocognitive, neurobehavioural, and neuropsychiatric deficits. In this article, we review the current (1986-2002) evidence surrounding the pharmacological management of arousal states and the aforementioned neurological sequelae of head injury in either acute or chronic conditions. This article will review the evidence for the use of psychostimulants (methylphenidate), antidepressants (amitriptyline, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buproprion), Parkinson's medications (amantadine, bromocriptine, carbidopa/levodopa), anticonvulsants (valproic acid), modafinil (Provigil), lactate, hyperbaric oxygen chamber, electroconvulsive therapy, and transmagnetic stimulation, in patients following a head injury. The review did not include all anticonvulsants, neuroleptics, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, azospirones or cognitive enhancers. Unfortunately, the quality of the evidence is generally poor, and sometimes conflicting, which in turn results in indecisive guidelines for treating patients.

Evaluation of clinical symptoms measured by the Positive and Negative Syndromes scale (PANSS) revealed that female patients responded better to therapy as compared to male ones, with PANSS total, PANSS negative and PANSS general psychopathological scores being significantly reduced (p < 0.006) in females after 1 week of the treatment and in males--after 2 weeks. In the female group, a reduction of PANSS total score by 50% in the acute stage of treatment qualified as a very good response was observed in 7 (33%) patients and in the male group--in 1 (2.7%). The between-groups difference was highly significant (p = 0.002). When examined for a rate of 3H-serotonin uptake into platelets, density of sites of 3H-imipramine binding on the whole platelets, platelet serotonin level and levels of high- also low-molecular weight forms of platelet immunoreactive serotonin transporter protein, a significant decrease of the platelet serotonin level, comparing to controls, was detected in the female group before treatment. During the treatment, this parameter gradually increased up to control level. Other parameters did not change significantly for 28-weeks of therapy and did not differ from the control values. There were positive correlations between the levels of platelet serotonin before treatment and subsequent reduction of the PANSS total and positive subscale scores in the female group. In responders with a very good treatment-related response, the serotonin level in the platelets before treatment was higher compared to the values in resistant patients: 5.4 +/- 2.5 and 2.7 +/- 1.3 nmol/10(9) cells, respectively. Relative risk (RR) of unfavorable treatment outcome in patients with initially reduced levels of platelet serotonin was approximately twice lower (RR = 1.83; Cl 95% 1.1-34.9) than that in patients with normal or elevated levels of platelet serotonin. The results suggest that selection of patients with initial higher level of platelet serotonin before olanzapine treatment can reduce the risk of non-responding to therapy by 36%.",

Displacement of [3H]-pirenzepine and [3H]-QNB plus pirenzepine was performed in rat hippocampus. Both compounds showed a higher degree of affinity to M1 muscarinic receptors (P < 0.01) than to M2 muscarinic receptors. To determine the M1 agonist or antagonist role of the two huprines, studies of inositol phosphates (IP) production were performed. Both huprines significantly stimulated IP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The reversion of this effect by different antagonists showed that M1 muscarinic receptors were activated by (+/-)-huprine Y and (+/-)-huprine Z, but some other mechanisms, such as alpha1-adrenoceptors or nicotinic receptors, were involved.",

This urge has a circadian pattern - it is most pronounced in the evening or during the night. RLS symptoms are relieved by movement. The pathophysiology of RLS is related to dopamine transmission insufficiency, low iron storage in substantia nigra neurons, and spinal cord dysfunction. RLS is idiopathic or secondary (usually associated with iron deficiency, end-stage renal failure, pregnancy and spinal lesions). One half of the patients with idiopathic RLS have positive family history of RLS. RLS is curable, though the choice of therapy and proper dosage titration may take a long time, and though the therapy may sometimes have to be changed owing to augmentation. The most important pharmacologic treatment used in RLS includes L-DOPA, dopamine agonists, opiates, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines. Therapy improves significantly the condition in long-term at least in 80% of RLS patients.",

Two punishment groups were trained with response-contingent footshock that suppressed baseline rates of responding to zero. In an extinction group, remifentanil delivery was discontinued, and baseline responding stabilized at a low rate (mean=0.06 responses/min). Lorazepam (0.08-10 mg/kg, IP) was given during test sessions with the shock contingency discontinued for both punishment groups. Remifentanil delivery was maintained during testing in one punishment group but not the other.", 
    "189": "Lorazepam reinstated self-administration responding in both punishment groups but not in the extinction group. Priming injections of heroin reinstated responding in both the punishment and extinction groups, but combining heroin and lorazepam did not enhance reinstatement.", 
    "190": "This is the first demonstration that a trigger for relapse may have different effects depending on whether aversive conditioning contributed to the achievement of abstinence. It may be important to consider potential anti-punishment effects of both abused drugs and therapeutic agents in the treatment of individuals with a history of drug abuse.", 
    "191": "This single blinded observational study compared the bispectral index (BIS) monitor with a validated pediatric sedation scale, the University of Michigan Sedation Scale (UMSS), to evaluate whether the BIS score can be used to judge the depth of sedation in pediatric outpatients. Thirty-eight children, with a mean age of 5.8 years, undergoing routine sedation for both noninvasive and gastrointestinal procedures, had simultaneous BIS and UMSS scores recorded. Sedation categories were defined as light, moderate, and deep for both UMSS and BIS. There was a moderate correlation between BIS and the UMSS, Spearman's r < -0.499. The correlation was poor for children receiving chloral hydrate, r < -0.213. The BIS score was not predictive of any specific UMSS score. The UMSS and BIS categories of sedation matched only 36% of the time. BIS underestimated the clinical level of sedation.", 
    "192": "We induced radio frequency (RF) lesions in the neuronal pathway leading from the forebrain to the pontine micturition center (PMC) to produce a rat model of bladder overactivity. We studied the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists (diazepam and baclofen) and glutamate receptor antagonists (MK-801 maleate and GYKI52466 [1-(4-aminophenyl-D-4-methyl-7,8 methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine] hydrochloride) on the cystometrogram and developed a possible explanation of the neuronal mechanisms underlying RF lesion induced bladder overactivity.", 
    "193": "Seven-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and RF lesions were produced in the nuclei basalis. Five days later bladder contractions were induced by infusing fluid into the bladder and cystometrograms were measured in conscious rats.", 
    "194": "The micturition interval (MI) in rats subjected to RF lesioning was significantly shorter than that in sham operated control rats. Diazepam (0.1 and 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally), baclofen (1 mg/kg intravenously) and MK-801 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg intravenously) did not change or shortened MI in control rats but it prolonged MI in lesioned rats. GYKI52466 (0.5 and 1 mg/kg intravenously) weakly prolonged MI in lesioned rats.", 
    "195": "We consider that RF lesioning causes interruption of the inhibitory GABAergic neurons that lead from the forebrain to the PMC. This results in the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the PMC that are involved in the facilitation of voiding.", 
    "196": "Previous research shows that ketamine significantly alters cardiac signal regulation in rhesus monkeys, however relatively little is known about the mechanism for this effect. In the study reported here the relative contributions of NMDA receptor activation on cardiac signal dynamics were determined by administering a specific NMDA antagonist, MK801, to rhesus monkeys. The general effects of sedation were assessed by measuring cardiac response to lorazepam, a sedative drug without direct NMDA receptor activity. Electrocardiographic signal dynamics were examined before and after I.V. administration of either MK801 (0.16 mg/kg) or lorazepam (0.48 mg/kg). Inter-beat interval time series data were analyzed in the frequency domain after Fourier transform, and a nonlinear measure of autocorrelation, the Hurst exponent (H), was derived. After MK801 administration, log [HF /Total power] increased post-infusion (M = 1.11, SD = 0.45) compared with pre-infusion values [M = -0.19, SD = 0.32, F(1,4) = 19.49, P = 0.01] while H decreased, mean pre versus post 0.52+/-S.D. 0.10 versus 0.01+/- 0.05, P = 0.0002. Lorazepam administration did not significantly alter heart rate variability measures obtained in the frequency or nonlinear domains. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has defined the effects of peripherally administered MK801 on cardiovascular dynamics in primates and establishes that peripheral administration of NMDA antagonists result in large increases the high-frequency components of cardiac rhythm and increased heart rate variability compatible with MK801-associated increases in parasympathetic outflow.", 
    "197": "Two ultrashort-acting hypnotics, triazolam 0.25 mg and zolpidem 10 mg, were studied for their effects on equilibrium function in humans. Eight healthy male subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study after informed consent. They subjected to static equilibrium tests, oculomotor tests and an assay of drug concentrations in the blood. Zolpidem was statistically significant in postural sway in tandem stance test, as defined by parametric values of tracing sum length and polygonal area of foot pressure center measured by a gait analysis system. In the tandem stance test, triazolam was statistically significant in postural sway only as defined by the polygonal area. However, in the Romberg test, the only statistically significant difference in zolpidem use was observed in polygonal area values. Blood concentrations of triazolam and zolpidem were found to closely correlate with the extent of postural sway in both tandem stance and Romberg tests. In this study, zolpidem with minimal muscle-relaxant effect incurred imbalance more extensively than triazolam, which is known for its effect of muscle relaxation. In addition, gaze deviation nystagmus was observed only in zolpidem use in 5 of 8 subjects (62.5%). From these results, it is suggested that in the use of hypnotics, sway derives from the suppression of the central nervous system relevant to awakening rather than from muscle relaxation. The prior reference to blood concentrations of hypnotics should help improve safety care in minimizing loss of balance control and possible fall.", 
    "198": "The search for a substrate that may serve as a probe to quantitatively predict the in vivo kinetics of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) drugs has been of particular interest because more than half of all human drugs appear to be substrates for this enzyme. Even three closely related 1,4-benzodiazepines-alprazolam, midazolam, and triazolam-are inadequate probes to predict the pharmacokinetics of each other in an individual. If these drugs--all metabolized through the same CYP3A pathways in humans, all FDA Biopharmaceutical Classification System Class 1 compounds exhibiting high solubility and high permeability and thus unaffected by transporter differences--cannot quantitatively predict the pharmacokinetics of their closely related congeners, there is little hope that any quantitative CYP3A probe will ever be found.", 
    "199": "Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) are small-molecule inhibitors that selectivly inhibit farnesylation of a number of intracellular substrate proteins such as Ras. Preclinical work has revealed their ability to effectively inhibit tumor growth in vitro and in vivo in animal models across a wide range of malignant phenotypes. Acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) are appropriate disease targets in that they express relevant biologic targets such as Ras, MEK, AKT, and others that may depend upon farnesyl protein transferase activity to promote cell proliferation and survival. Indeed, different intracellular proteins are substrates for prenylation. Interruption of prenylation may prevent substrates from undergoing maturation which may result in the inhibition of cellular events that depend on the function of those substrates. Phase I trials in AML and myelodysplasia have demonstrated biologic and clinical activities as determined by target enzyme inhibition, low toxicity, and both complete and partial responses. As a result, phase II trials have been initiated in order to further validate clinical activity and to identify downstream signal transduction targets that may be modified by these agents. It is anticipated that these studies will serve to define the optimal roles of FTIs in patients with these hematologic malignancies and provide insight into effective methods by which to combine FTIs with other agents.", 
    "200": "A novel positron emitting agent, 2'-[18F]fluoroflumazenil (fluoroethyl 8-fluoro-5-methyl-6-oxo-5,6-dihydro-4H-benzo-[f]imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]diazepine-3-carboxylate, FFMZ), has been reported for benzodiazepine imaging. In the present study, biological properties of [18F]FFMZ were investigated. Stability tests of [18F]FFMZ in human and rat sera were performed. Biodistribution was investigated in mice and phosphorimages of brains were obtained from rats. A receptor binding assay was performed using rat brain (mixture of cortex and cerebellum) homogenate. A static positron emission tomography (PET) image was obtained from a normal human volunteer. Although [18F]FFMZ was stable in human serum, it was rapidly hydrolyzed in rat serum. The hydrolysis was 39%, 63% and 92% at 10, 30 and 60 min, respectively. According to the biodistribution study in mice, somewhat even distribution (between 2 approximately 3% ID/g) was observed in most organs. Intestinal uptake increased up to 6% ID/g at 1 h due to biliary excretion. Bone uptake slowly increased from 1.5% to 3.5% ID/g at 1 h. High uptakes in the cortex, thalamus and cerebellum, which could be completely blocked by coinjection of cold FMZ, were observed by phosphorimaging study using rats. Determination of Kd value and Bmax using rat brain tissue was performed by Scatchard plotting and found 1.45+/-0.26 nM and 1.08+/-0.03 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The PET image of the normal human volunteer showed high uptake in the following decreasing order: frontal cortex, temporal cortex, occipital cortex, cerebellum, parietal cortex and thalamus. In conclusion, the new FMZ derivative, [18F]FFMZ appears to be a promising PET agent for central benzodiazepine receptor imaging with a convenient labeling procedure and a specific binding property.", 
    "201": "Dizocilpine (MK-801; 0.3 mg/kg i.p.)-induced disruption in prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response (PPI) can be preferentially restored by \"atypical\" antipsychotics. In contrast, some findings indicate that not all of the \"atypical\" antipsychotics, such as clozapine and risperidone, are effective in restoring the NMDA antagonist-induced deficits in PPI. In our study, we evaluated the effect of four different \"atypical\" antipsychotic drugs on deficits in PPI induced by MK-801. Zotepine and risperidone have high affinities to D2-like and 5-HT2A receptors, while clozapine and olanzapine have multipharmacological profiles with the highest affinities to serotonin 5-HT1A,2A/2C receptors and muscarinic receptors. Results have shown that MK-801 disrupted PPI and increased the ASR in rats. Our results showed no effect of zotepine (1 and 2 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) on disrupted PPI by MK-801. Administration of clozapine (5 and 10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) restored the deficits in PPI induced by MK-801. Additionally, we found a decrease of approximately 46% in PPI after administration of clozapine (5 mg/kg) and olanzapine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) without MK-801 treatment. In summary, the four \"atypical\" antipsychotics had different efficacies to restore the disrupted PPI by MK-801. Only clozapine and olanzapin restored the MK-801-induced deficits in PPI.", 
    "202": "Nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) are proteins involved in neuronal survival, neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. Recent observations suggest that treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs affect NGF and BDNF levels in the rat brain. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine has a low incidence of side effects, such as extrapyramidal and anticholinergic symptoms. Since NGF and BDNF are involved in the regulation of cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) we hypothesized that chronic olanzapine treatment will influence the distribution of NGF and BDNF in the rat brain. To test this hypothesis we administered olanzapine for 29 days in the drinking water at the doses of 3 and 15 mg/kg body weight and measured the levels of NGF and BDNF in the brain of Wistar rats. Olanzapine increased NGF in the hippocampus, occipital cortex and hypothalamus. In contrast, olanzapine decreased BDNF in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Although the significance of these findings is not clear, a heuristic hypothesis is that olanzapine's clinical effects and a favorable side effect profile are in part mediated by neurotrophins."
