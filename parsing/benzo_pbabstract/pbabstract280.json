The patient stayed during around twenty hours unconscious, in the sitting position, with an extreme flexion of the neck on the left side. After injection of flumazenil the patient's consciousness was restored. Nevertheless a complete sensitive and motor deficit at the C4 and C5 level was then observed. Several diagnosis such as peripheral neuropathy, infectious disease, or arterial occlusion were eliminated and we finally postulated that the regulation of the spinal blood flow had likely been disturbed by the prolonged flexion of the neck, the hypotension and the putative respiratory depression. The fact that the patient suffered from cervicarthrosis would have already impaired the spinal blood flow regulation and consequently had probably damaged the spinal cord. No clinical improvement of the quadriplegia was noticed and the patient died in the intensive care unit thirteen days after admission. Such an exceptional complication after a toxic coma remind us the necessity to avoid long lasting vicious position of the cervical spine in anaesthesia and emergency practice.",

The influence of various parameters (voltage, temperature, buffer concentration and pH, ethanol percentage) on analysis time and on the theoretical plates of the two peaks was investigated by means of experimental design. A response surface study was carried out by means of a 27-run D-optimal matrix. The best background electrolyte was found to be 0.13 M, pH 2.9 Britton-Robinson buffer, containing 10% v/v ethanol. Other optimised parameters were voltage (30 kV) and temperature (30 degrees C). The UV detector for quantitation of otilonium bromide and diazepam was set at 280 nm and 230 nm, respectively. Procaine hydrochloride was used as internal standard and run time was less than five minutes. Validation was performed, for drug substance and drug product, according to ICH3 guidelines. For drug product the recovery for otilonium bromide and diazepam ranged from 98.3% to 101.2% and from 97.1% to 99.0%, respectively; the RSD values found for otilonium bromide and diazepam ranged from 2.4% to 3.0% and from 1.1% to 4.5%, respectively.",

It has analgesic activity suitable for mild to moderate pain, part of its analgesic activity being modulated via mu receptors. Adult studies have raised the question of increased electroencephalographic activity. The study examined the analgesic efficacy, respiratory effects, and behavior plus recovery-influencing properties of tramadol in the pediatric patient. Day-case dental extraction children, aged 4-7 years having 6 or more extractions, were studied. Tramadol drops, 3 mg/kg, plus oral midazolam, 0.5 mg/kg, were administered 30 minutes prior to a sevoflurane in N2O and O2 anesthetic. Forty children received this premedication treatment (T) and 10 entered a placebo control group (P), where no tramadol was administered. Entry was random, double blind, and parallel. Analgesic efficacy was measured using the Oucher face pain scale (OFPS), with responders scoring three or less. Respiration was measured by rate and oxygen saturation. Behavior and ease of mask induction were assessed on a 4-point scale. Recovery was measured with the Aldrete scale. Parameters were measured from 30 minute preanesthetic to 120 minute postanesthetic. Analgesic efficacy was shown, with an OFPS score of 11.42 (SD 18.66) (T) and 29.80 (SD 25.14) (P) (P < .05). Responders on tramadol were 77.5% versus 0% on placebo (P < .05). No respiratory depression was seen; rates and oxygen saturations were the same preanesthetic and postanesthetic. Similarly, the two groups had no cardiovascular differences. Preanesthetic behavior patterns were the same (P > .05), with 85% of the tramadol group being drowsy but awake versus 90% in the placebo group. Similarly satisfactory induction behavior was seen in 95% of the tramadol group and 90% of the placebo group. Recovery times were 48.6 minutes (SD 32.3) (T) and 43.1 minutes (SD 32.5) (P) (P > .05). It is concluded that tramadol at 3 mg/kg has no clinical respiratory depressant effect and that behavior and recovery times are unaffected. Analgesic efficacy is demonstrated.", 
    "14": "1. Benzodiazepines (BZ) and barbiturates both potentiate chloride currents through GABA(A) receptors to enhance inhibition. However, unlike barbiturates BZ do not impair autonomic control of heart rate. We hypothesised that BZ might not significantly potentiate GABAergic transmission in the caudal nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS), which is critically important for mediating the baroreceptor reflex. 2. In rat brain slices the BZ agonists chlordiazepoxide and midazolam (2 and 50 microM) did not significantly enhance currents evoked by GABA in voltage-clamped cNTS neurones. Chlordiazepoxide (50 microM) reversibly increased electrically evoked IPSPs in 5/10 rostral NTS (rNTS) neurones but only in 2/10 cNTS neurones. Pentobarbitone (50-100 microM) was effective in enhancing GABA(A)-mediated responses in all NTS neurones. An inverse BZ agonist, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM; 1 or 10 microM), failed to depress GABA-induced currents in the cNTS. 3. Microinjections of midazolam (10 and 100 microM solutions) into the cNTS did not affect the baroreceptor reflex (P > 0.2) while pentobarbitone (100 microM) significantly and reversibly depressed it (gain decrease to 53 +/- 11 % of control, P < 0.01). 4. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction revealed the presence of alpha(1), alpha(2), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(2) GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNA in the cNTS. No alternatively spliced variants of the alpha(1)- and gamma(2)-subunits were revealed. Moreover, GABA(A) epsilon-unit mRNA was found in both the cNTS and rNTS as two alternatively spliced transcripts. 5. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed numerous GABA(A) epsilon-subunit-positive neurones within the cNTS with significantly fewer epsilon-subunit-positive cells in the rNTS. 6. As incorporation of the epsilon-subunit in recombinant GABA(A) receptors may confer BZ insensitivity we propose that the paucity of BZ actions in the cNTS is due to a high level of epsilon-subunit expression. This is the first demonstration of a possible physiological impact of the epsilon-subunit on native GABA(A) receptors.",

    "21": "The functional effects of muscarinic receptor and purinoceptor agonists and antagonists were studied on isolated strip preparations of the rat urinary bladder. The muscarinic \"M3/M1-selective\" receptor antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide (4-DAMP) most conspicuously inhibited the carbachol-evoked contractile responses (pA2=9.8), while the muscarinic \"M1-selective\" receptor antagonist pirenzepine and the muscarinic \"M2-selective\" receptor antagonist methoctramine were less potent (pA2=7.0 and 6.5, respectively). Administration of 4-DAMP in combination with methoctramine in selective dosages gave no significant additional reduction of carbachol-evoked contractile responses. Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) elicited transient dose-dependent contractile responses and it caused relaxation of the carbachol-contracted detrusor strips. The relaxatory response was enhanced in the presence of methoctramine and furthermore, was attenuated by the adenosine receptor antagonist 8-p-sulfophenyltheophylline. Administration of 2-chloro-adenosine to pre-contracted strips tended to cause dose-dependent relaxations, which were significantly increased in the presence of methoctramine. The purinergic contractile response, on the other hand, was not affected by methoctramine. Thus, the results are consistent with the cholinergic contractile response in the rat urinary bladder being exerted via activation of muscarinic M3 receptors, while the muscarinic M2 receptors exerted a modulator effect on purine-evoked relaxations in the rat urinary bladder.", 
    "22": "The binding of novel nucleoside derivatives (2-7) to the Human Serum Albumin (HSA) was studied using zidovudine (AZT), as standard compound. The applicability of two different techniques to separate unbound drug from drug-protein complex was analyzed: the gel filtration and ultrafiltration methods. Ultrafiltration was found to be an adequate procedure for the separation of unbounded drug from the drug-protein complex. Incubation temperature ranging from 0 to 37 degrees C did not modify considerably the bound fractions. The same effects were observed as HSA concentration was modified. Binding assays of studied compounds to purified 1% (w/v) HSA at 0 degrees C, indicate that bound fraction of 2-7 ranges from 13 to 47%, exhibiting a higher affinity to HSA than AZT (12%), which would introduce some interesting improvements in their pharmacokinetic properties. In addition, by means of displacement studies using HSA site specific drugs such as diazepam and salicylate, it was determined that AZT binds to site I of the HSA molecule, by a mainly entropy driven process (DeltaS = 10.834 cal/mol degrees K), being these observations extensive to 2-7. Some structural basis to explain enhanced affinity of these novel derivatives was also established.", 
    "23": "To determine the best and simplest method for cryopreservation of pig hepatocytes, we compared immediate cryopreservation with cryopreservation after short-term culture. Suckling pig hepatocytes were isolated by a modified 2-step in situ collagenase perfusion method, suspended in serum-free medium, and preserved for 10 da by two cryopreservation methods. Serial measurements were made of cell viability, LDH release, synthesis of protein, urea and glucose, glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase) activity, and diazepam transformation after thawing. These measurements were performed on both groups of cultured hepatocytes, and on freshly isolated hepatocytes, which served as a control. High viability (>95%)of thawed hepatocytes was obtained and maintained in both cryopreservation groups. There were no significant differences in cell viability, protein synthesis, glucose synthesis, G-6-Pase activity, or diazepam transformation between the two cryopreservation groups. In the immediate cryopreservation group, urea synthesis was less than in the group with cryopreservation after short-term culture. Protein synthesis, glucose synthesis, and diazepam transformation were lower in both cryopreserved groups than in the controls. The results showed that a protocol of immediate cryopreservation of hepatocytes in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% DMSO, hormones, growth factors, and 10% newborn bovine serum, together with rate-controlled freezing and rapid thawing, provides indices of cell viability and function during subsequent serum-free culture that are comparable to hepatocytes cryopreserved after short-term culture, except for lower urea production.

    "38": "Crystallization of 5-methyl-2-[(2-nitrophenyl)amino]-3-thiophenecarbonitrile (1), previously found to produce six conformational polymorphs from solution, on single-crystal pimelic acid (PA) substrates results in selective and oriented growth of the metastable \"YN\" (yellow needle) polymorph on the (101)(PA) faces of the substrate. Though the freshly cleaved substrate crystals expose (101)(PA) and (111)(PA) faces, which are both decorated with [101](PA) ledges that could serve as nucleation sites, crystal growth of YN occurs on only (101)(PA). Goniometry measurements performed with an atomic force microscope reveal that the (001)(YN) plane contacts (101)(PA) with a crystal orientation [100](YN)//[010](PA) and [010](YN)//[101](PA). A geometric lattice analysis using a newly developed program dubbed GRACE (geometric real-space analysis of crystal epitaxy) indicates that this interfacial configuration arises from optimal two-dimensional epitaxy and that among the six polymorphs of 1, only the YN polymorph, in the observed orientation, achieves reasonable epitaxial match to (101)(PA). The geometric analysis also reveals that none of the polymorphs, including YN, can achieve comparable epitaxial match with (111)(PA), consistent with the absence of nucleation on this crystal face. In contrast, sublimation of 1 on cleaved succinic acid (SA) substrates, which expose large (010)(SA) faces decorated with steps along [101](SA), affords growth of several polymorphs, each with multiple orientations, as well as oriented crystals of a new metastable polymorph on the (010)(SA) surfaces. The lack of polymorphic selectivity on (010)(SA) can be explained by the geometric lattice analysis, which reveals low-grade epitaxial matches between (010)(SA) and several polymorphs of 1 but no inherent selectivity toward a single polymorph. These observations demonstrate the sensitivity of crystal nucleation to substrate surface structure, the potential of crystalline substrates for selective nucleation and discovery of polymorphs, and the utility of geometric lattice modeling for screening of substrate libraries for controlling polymorphism.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether treatment with talampanel would protect in a rat model of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Twenty-four hours prior to TBI, a fluid-percussion interface was positioned parasagittally over the right cerebral cortex. On the following day, fasted rats were anesthetized with 3% halothane, 70% nitrous oxide, and a balance of oxygen; mechanically ventilated and physiologically regulated; and subjected to right parieto-occipital parasagittal fluid-percussion injury (1.5-2.0 atm). The agent (talampanel, bolus infusion of 4 mg/kg followed by infusion of 4 mg/kg/h over 72 h) or vehicle was administered i.v. starting at either 30 min or 3 h after trauma. Seven days after TBI, brains were perfusion-fixed, coronal sections at various levels were digitized, and contusion areas were measured. Treatment with talampanel, when instituted 30 min after trauma, significantly reduced total contusion area compared to vehicle-treated rats (0.54 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.79 +/- 0.42 mm2, respectively). When talampanel treatment was begun at 3 h, the neuroprotective effect of the drug was lost. In addition, treatment with talampanel starting at 30 min significantly attenuated neuronal damage in all three subsectors of the hippocampal CA1 sector compared to vehicle-treated rats (normal-neuron counts, right (ipsilateral) medial CA1: 80.3 +/- 2.0 [talampanel] vs. 66.3 +/- 2.1 [vehicle] (mean +/- SEM); middle CA1: 71.5 +/- 2.0 vs. 60.3 +/- 2.2; lateral CA1: 74.5 +/- 3.0 vs. 63.0 +/- 3.2, respectively).

    "47": "In humans, some psychotropic agents (alcohol, drugs, illicit substances) have been suggested to play a role in the occurrence of major behavioural disorders, mainly due to the suppression of psychomotor inhibition. Behavioural disinhibition is a physiological mechanism which allows humans to behave appropriately according to a given environmental situation. The behavioural disinhibition induced by either therapeutic dosage or misuse involves the loss of restraint over certain types of social behaviour and may increase the risk of auto or hetero-aggression and acting out. The increased use of psychotropic agents in recent years and the occurrence of unwanted effects are worrying and must be detected and evaluated. The objective of the present study was to establish a causal relationship between psychoactive substance use and occurrence of major behavioural disorders, such as paradoxical rage reactions and suicidal behaviour, based on a literature analysis. It consisted of reviewing reports of drug-induced violent reactions in healthy volunteers and demonstrating, where possible, a cause-effect relationship. Patients with schizophrenia and psychopathic personalities were not included in our study since psychiatric comorbidity could influence behavioural responses. Psychotropic agents included drugs, licit and illicit substances already associated with violence in the past. Many reports used the \"Go/No Go test\" to evaluate the disinhibiting effect of psychotropic substances; this allows the \"cognitive mapping\" of drugs. The results suggest that only alcohol, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and coca\u00efne are related to aggressive behaviour. The best known precipitant of behavioural disinhibition is alcohol, which induces aggressive behaviour. However, there are large differences between individuals, and attentional mechanisms are now recognised as being important in mediating the effects of alcohol. Suicidal tendency as an adverse antidepressant reaction is rare, especially with atypical antidepressants. However, the risk of acting out exists and the responsibility of antidepressant agents in the genesis of suicidal tendencies is now established. The disinhibiting effects of benzodiazepines are well-known and proven by clinical trials. It's a \"model\" of acting out, and the causal relationship is undeniable. That coca\u00efne is related to violent behaviour is demonstrated by its pharmacological actions on CNS. The chronic use of coca\u00efne induces \"a limbic dyscontrol syndrome\" based on the altered activity of limbic structures. On the contrary, we could not demonstrate a causal relationship between aggression and either cannabis, ecstasy or phencyclidine. Cannabis abusers look particularly for euphoria and relaxing effects. Aggression as an adverse cannabis reaction is very rare and occurs in most cases in association with other drugs and in predisposed individuals. Ecstasy use may lead to long-term alterations of neuronal function in the human CNS and cause psychiatric disorders. However, there is insufficient information about long-term use of ecstasy to estimate its role in the occurrence of behavioural disorders. Clinical and forensic assumptions about phencyclidine and violence were not warranted. However, the substance-effect relationships can be criticized in the case of alcohol, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and coca\u00efne. In fact, individual, social and psychiatric factors exert an influence on behaviour that is superior to the pharmacological effect of psychotropic agents. The most important parameter in drug-induced behavioural disinhibition is dosage, but mode of administration is also important. In addition, polysubstance abuse is very common. Substances may be taken simultaneously and alcohol is frequently combined with drugs. The combinations of substances result in multiple interactions, and very little is known about the effects of these interactions on violence in humans. Co-occurrence of substance abuse and other mental disorders is also very frequent. Multiple substance abuse should be avoided, because potential interactions between two or more drugs are more likely to cause violent behaviour. In the future, a specific treatment of these deleterious phenomena will have to be considered in order to reduce drug-induced iatrogenic behavioural disorders.",

We shall conclude with a synthesis of the proposed practical management when confronted with such disorders. Psychiatric complications under interferon-Alpha. The appearance of psychiatric complications caused by interferon has been the subject of many publications. They have also raised the question of the toxicity mechanism which is still misunderstood today. This toxicity appears to be dose-dependent with variations depending on the daily dose given, the mode of administration, the combination with other chemotherapy treatments, the concomitance with a cerebral radiotherapy or a medical history of psychiatric disorders. Most of these effects occur after three weeks of treatment but non specific neuropsychic symptoms can be observed earlier. Non specific symptoms. They appear early but are difficult to detect, though they bring together a whole lot of clinical signs: asthenia, irritability, psychomotor slowdown, depressive mood or even a real \"subsyndromic\" depressive syndrome, anorexia, decline of the libido, concentration and attention problems, dizzy spells and headaches. Some authors have described intense and fluctuating of personality, mixing anxiety, irritability and disorder of drive control. Depression. Depression is the most frequently found psychiatric pathology in studies but the real frequency of clear cases of depressive problems is difficult to determine through lack of serious studies. So the incidence of depressive disorders usually varies from 5 to 15%. The depressive syndrome can settle as soon as the first week treatment, with a peak in the frequency during the first and third months. The seriousness and the incidence of this syndrome seem to be dose-dependent. The gravity of this complication lies in the suicidal risk, a risk all the more dreadful since there is not any identified risk factor. Suicides and suicidal behaviours. Serious complications, because they act directly on the vital prognosis. However fortunately, suicidal behaviours only represent a minority within all the side effects attributed to the interferon-alpha. These actions fit into three main clinical dimensions: complication of a severe depressive syndrome, confusional context and disorder of the impulses control. In practical terms, prevention proves to be difficult without identified predictive factors. Nevertheless, some authors point out the importance of aggravating comorbid disorders like alcoholism or the coinfection by the HIV. Manic syndrome. The appearance of a manic state under a chemotherapy treatment seems to be rare, given that there have been only a dozen cases published around the world. But these observations are interesting as far as both the study of imputability and the understanding of the toxicity mechanisms are concerned. Most of the cases deal with patients without a family or personal history of psychiatric disorders, and whose symptomatology disappears with the end of the treatment, which is an argument in favour of the imputation of the interferon in the appearance of manic disorders. In addition, some authors introduce the notion of tertiary mania: the appearance of an autoimmune hypothyroidism in relation with interferon and leading to athymic elation. Eventually, the appearance of manic problems at the end of the treatment makes it possible to speculate about the physiopathological mechanisms that are at issue. Anxiety disorders. These disorders are not much described: they generally are already existing disorders (like phobic or obsessive compulsive disorders), reactivated or aggravated by the interferon-alpha molecule. Adaptation disorders. It deals with adaptation disorders along with anxious temper coming at the beginning of the treatment. These problems are more concerned with the announcement of the diagnosis and its seriousness than with the toxicity of the interferon-alpha molecule. Psychotic states. There are less papers on the prevalence of psychotic disorders during the treatment, or at the end of it. But they can be found in both viral and malignant pathologies. A large retrospective study has shown ten cases of psychotic disorders and that in the absence of history of psychiatry or of a HIV co-infection. In every case the psychiatric aspect is stopped by the ending of the treatment or by an appropriated treatment. Usually, the few cases of parano\u00efd delusion described in papers seem to appear between one and three months of treatment, with patients having a history of psychiatric disorders. Aggravation of pre-existing mental disorders. Numerous authors have reported the recurrence of addictive behaviours (alcohol or other psychoactive matter) by weaned patients. Imputability to interferon-alpha in psychiatric disorders. It is difficult to draw the relationship between the chemotherapy with the interferon-alpha treatment and neuropsychiatric complications because there is a lack in specific studies. Nevertheless, it seems to be causal relations between the prescription of interferon and the appearance of psychic disorders. As a matter of fact, even if there is neither predictive criterion nor diagnosis of clinical type (set apart a dose effect), it is clear that there are diagnostic criteria of chronological kind: delay of appearance and disappearance of side effects compatible with the kinetics of the molecule and test of positive reintroduction. The imputability is thus most likely towards, given the reported clinical observations and signs of direct cerebral toxicity described for interferon: induction of neurophysiological changes among healthy volunteers, reversible EEG impairments the second week of treatment, direct vascular and neurological toxicity. Eventually, authors have shown that the psychiatric morbidity could be more important among patients under treatment than in a control group. In conclusion, the imputability of interferon appears to be very likely, more particularly in the appearance of mood disorders, mainly depressive ones, of manic syndromes and of certain psychotic episodes.", 
    "49": "The most numerous therapeutic propositions naturally concern the depressive syndromes, because of their high frequency. In a recent article, the authors have detailed the pharmacological criteria of the ideal molecule: limited hepatic metabolism, low rate of proteinic fixation, long half-life and absence of active metabolite. So they advise not to prescribe imipraminic molecules and recommend the use of some SRI in first intention: citalopram and sertraline mainly, paroxetine to avoid given its pharmacological features that do not seem adapted. Only the minalcipram seems to show all the theoretical advantages described above. If there is an indication in the introduction of an anxiolytic medication, we shall prefer a benzodiazepine with short half-life like loxazepam and alprazolam. Besides, all the publications point out the importance of a specific clinical observation during the treatment as well as in the six months following its end. The agreement must bear full medical costs, above all including psychotherapic and social aspects. The proposed treatments for the other disorders are conventional: haloperidol and lithium for bipolar disorders, fluvoxamine for obsessive compulsive disorders and neuroleptics for psychotic disorders.", 
    "50": "The appearance of neuropsychiatric side effects during a chemotherapy using the interferon-alpha molecule is a frequent complication, the consequences of which can prove tragic: involvement of the vital prognosis, family and professional relation disturbances, compliance problems, risks of psychiatric morbidity at short and middle terms.... In spite of the absence of rigorous controlled studies, the imputability to the interferon of the appearance of psychological disorders appears very likely. So the role of the psychiatrist seems to be determining in the follow-up care of these patients who must be considered at high risk to develop a psychiatric pathology. The agreement to bear medical costs has to be made in narrow collaboration with clinical practitioners and must be part of a clinical continuity, from the pre-therapeutical evaluation to the remote follow-up care. Finally, it seems important to implement controlled studies, resting on a great diagnostic and methodological rigour, in order to clarify the toxicity mechanisms of interferon and to optimise the agreement to bear medical cost for the patients.", 
    "51": "5-(2'-[18F]Fluoroethyl)flumazenil ([18F]FEF) is a fluorine-18 labelled positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for central benzodiazepine receptors. Compared with the established [11C]flumazenil, it has the advantage of the longer half-life of the fluorine-18 label. After optimisation of its synthesis and determination of its in vitro receptor affinities, we performed first PET studies in humans. PET studies in seven healthy human volunteers were performed on a Siemens ECAT EXACT whole-body scanner after injection of 100-280 MBq [L8F]FEF. In two subjects, a second PET scan was conducted after pretreatment with unlabelled flumazenil (1 mg or 2.5 mg i.v., 3 min before tracer injection). A third subject was studied both with [18F]FEF and with [11C]flumazenil. Brain radioactivity was measured for 60-90 min p.i. and analysed with a region of interest-oriented approach and on a voxelwise basis with spectral analysis. Plasma radioactivity was determined from arterial blood samples and metabolites were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. In human brain, maximum radioactivity accumulation was observed 4 +/- 2 min p.i., with a fast clearance kinetics resulting in 50% and 20% of maximal activities at about 10 and 30 min, respectively. [18F]FEF uptake followed the known central benzodiazepine receptor distribution in the human brain (occipital cortex >temporal cortex >cerebellum >thalamus >pons). Pretreatment with unlabelled flumazenil resulted in reduced tracer uptake in all brain areas except for receptor-free reference regions like the pons. Parametric images of distribution volume and binding potential generated on a voxelwise basis revealed two- to three-fold lower in vivo receptor binding of [18F]FEF compared with [11C]flumazenil, while relative uptake of [18F]FEF was higher in the cerebellum, most likely owing to its relatively higher affinity for benzodiazepine receptors containing the alpha6 subunit. Metabolism of [18F]FEF was very rapid. Polar metabolites represented about 50%-60% of total plasma radioactivity at 5 min and 80%-90% at 20 min p.i. Although [11C]flumazenil has some advantages over [18F]FEF (higher affinity, slower metabolism, slower kinetics), our results indicate that [18F]FEF is a suitable PET ligand for quantitative assessment of central benzodiazepine receptors, which can be used independently of an on-site cyclotron.", 
    "52": "A reduced amplitude of the auditory evoked P300 was interpreted as a trait marker of schizophrenia but reports about correlations between schizophrenic psychopathology and P300 amplitude indicate also a state character.", 
    "53": "To shed light upon these trait and state aspects a longitudinal study was performed to investigate the influence of symptom improvement and atypical neuroleptics on the amplitudes of the P300 and their subcomponents.", 
    "54": "P300 was recorded in 17 schizophrenic patients before and after 4 weeks under either clozapine or olanzapine in a double-blind controlled design. For comparison, 17 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were investigated. Parietal and frontal P300 subcomponents were investigated separately using dipole source analysis.", 
    "55": "Schizophrenic patients had smaller parietal (temporo-basal dipole) but not frontal subcomponent amplitudes (temporo-superior dipole) than controls. For the whole sample subcomponent amplitudes did not change over 4 weeks despite clinical improvement but patients with a pronounced improvement of the PANSS positive score showed a slight enhancement of both subcomponents. This was not significant when the P300 amplitude was measured at a single electrode (Pz). No significant difference between clozapine and olanzapine concerning effects on P300 amplitudes were observed.", 
    "56": "The results indicate that P300 subcomponents are modulated by changes of positive but not by changes of negative symptoms or different neuroleptics. This result was obvious for P300 subcomponents but not for Pz electrode measurement, which may be due to a higher reliability of the dipole source activity. The results can be integrated into a hypothetical model containing two pathophysiological subgroups of schizophrenia.",

    "59": "Responding of baboons was studied using a schedule of reinforcement that simulated food \"seeking\" and food \"taking.\" Responding during the seeking component was reinforced by stimuli paired with food, while responding during the taking component was reinforced with food. The effects of intramuscular amphetamine (AMPH), dexfenfluramine (DFEN), diethylpropion (DEP), phencyclidine (PCP), diazepam (DZP), as well as caloric prefeeding and acute food deprivation were determined.", 
    "60": "AMPH decreased food taking and increased food seeking, DEP decreased food taking without affecting food seeking, DFEN and PCP decreased both food taking and food seeking, while DZP increased both food taking and food seeking. Caloric prefeeding decreased food taking and increased food seeking, i.e., resembled AMPH, while acute deprivation increased both food taking and food seeking, i.e., resembled DZP.", 
    "61": "Manipulations that increase dopamine turnover, such as AMPH, increase food seeking, while decreasing food intake. In contrast, manipulations that increase serotonin turnover, such as DFEN, decrease both food seeking and food taking.", 
    "62": "In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, whether inverse ratio ventilation differs from high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for gas exchange under a similar mean airway pressure has not been adequately examined. The authors used arterial oxygenation, gastric intramucosal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PiCO(2)), and pH (pHi) to assess whether pressure-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (PC-IRV) offers more benefits than pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV) with PEEP.", 
    "63": "Seventeen acute respiratory distress syndrome patients were enrolled and underwent mechanical ventilation with a PCV inspiratory-to-expiratory ratio of 1:2, followed by PC-IRV 1:1 initially. Then, they were randomly assigned to receive PC-IRV 2:1, then 4:1 or 4:1, and then 2:1, alternately. The baseline setting of PCV 1:2 was repeated between the settings of PC-IRV 2:1 and 4:1. Mean airway pressure and tidal volume were kept constant by adjusting the levels of peak inspiratory pressure and applied PEEP. In each ventilatory mode, hemodynamics, pulmonary mechanics, arterial and mixed venous blood gas analysis, PiCO(2), and pHi were measured after a 1-h period of stabilization.", 
    "64": "With a constant mean airway pressure, PC-IRV 2:1 and 4:1 decreased arterial and mixed venous oxygenation as compared with baseline PCV 1:2. Neither the global oxygenation indices with oxygen delivery and uptake nor PiCO(2) and pHi were improved by PC-IRV. During PC-IRV, applied PEEP was lower, and auto-PEEP was higher.", 
    "65": "When substituting inverse ratio ventilation for applied PEEP to keep mean airway pressure constant, PC-IRV does not contribute more to better gas exchange and gastric intramucosal PiCO(2) and pHi than does PCV 1:2 for acute respiratory distress syndrome patients, regardless of the inspiratory-to-expiratory ratios.", 
    "66": "Bispectral Index (BIS) has been used to measure sedation depth. Ideally, to guide anesthetic management, range of BIS scores at different sedation levels should not overlap, and BIS should be independent of drug used. This study assessed ability of BIS to predict sedation depth between sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam. Quality of recovery was also compared.", 
    "67": "Patients undergoing surgery with local or regional anesthesia and sedation were randomized to sevoflurane (n = 23), midazolam (n = 21), or propofol (n = 22). Sedation was titrated to Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation score of 3 (responds slowly to voice). BIS and Observers's Assessment of Alertness-Sedation were measured every 5 min. BIS prediction probability (PK) was compared between drugs. Recovery was assessed by BIS and Digit Symbol Substitution and memory tests.", 
    "68": "Bispectral Index of responders to voice was significantly different from nonresponders (86 +/- 10 vs. 74 +/- 14, mean +/- SD; P < 0.001) However, wide variability and overlap in BIS were observed (25th-75th percentile, responders vs. non-responders: 79-96 vs. 65-83). BIS of responders was different for sevoflurane versus propofol and midazolam. BIS was a better predictor of propofol sedation than sevoflurane or midazolam (PK = 0.87 +/- 0.11, 0.76 +/- 0.01, and 0.69 +/- 0.02, respectively; P < 0.05). At 10 min after the procedure, 76, 48, and 24% of sevoflurane, propofol, midazolam patients, respectively, returned to baseline Digit Symbol Substitution scores (P < 0.05). Excitement-disinhibition occurred in 70, 36, and 5% of sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam patients, respectively (P < 0.05).", 
    "69": "Individual BIS scores demonstrate significant variability, making it difficult to predict sedation depth. The relation between BIS and sedation depth may not be independent of anesthetic agent. Quality of recovery was similar between drugs, but excitement occurred frequently with sevoflurane.", 
    "70": "Despite significant advances in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) technology, surgical techniques, and anesthetic management, central nervous system complications occur in a large percentage of patients undergoing surgery requiring CPB. Many centers are switching to normothermic CPB because of shorter CPB and operating room times and improved myocardial protection. The authors hypothesized that, compared with normothermia, hypothermic CPB would result in superior neurologic and neurocognitive function after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.", 
    "71": "Three hundred patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were prospectively enrolled and randomly assigned to either normothermic (35.5-36.5 degrees C) or hypothermic (28-30 degrees C) CPB. A battery of neurocognitive tests was performed preoperatively and at 6 weeks after surgery. Four distinct cognitive domains were identified and standardized using factor analysis and were then compared on a continuous scale.", 
    "72": "Two hundred twenty-seven patients participated in 6-week follow-up testing. There were no differences in neurologic or neurocognitive outcomes between normothermic and hypothermic groups in multivariable models, adjusting for covariable effects of baseline cognitive function, age, and years of education, as well as interaction of these with temperature treatment.",

    "75": "A total of 157 inpatients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and a history of suboptimal treatment response were randomly assigned to receive clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, or haloperidol in a double-blind 14-week trial. The trial was divided into two periods: eight weeks during which the dosage was escalated and then fixed, and six weeks during which variable dosages were used. The hostility item of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) was the principal outcome measure. Covariates included the items that reflect positive symptoms of schizophrenia (delusions, suspiciousness or feelings of persecution, grandiosity, unusual thought content, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinations) and the sedation item of the Nurses Observation Scale for Inpatient Evaluation (NOSIE).", 
    "76": "Patients differed in their treatment response as measured by the hostility item of the PANSS. The scores of patients taking clozapine indicated significantly greater improvement than those of patients taking haloperidol or risperidone. The effect on hostility appeared to be independent of the antipsychotic effect of clozapine on other PANSS items that reflect delusional thinking, a formal thought disorder, or hallucinations and independent of sedation as measured by the NOSIE. Neither risperidone nor olanzapine showed superiority to haloperidol.", 
    "77": "Clozapine has a relative advantage over other antipsychotics as a specific antihostility agent.", 
    "78": "Mercury compounds are neurotoxic compounds with a great specificity for cerebellar granule cells. The interaction of mercury compounds with proteins in the central nervous system may underlie some of their effects on neurotransmission. In this work we study the interaction of mercuric chloride (HgCl2) and methylmercury (MeHg) with the GABA(A) receptor in primary cultures of cerebellar granule cells. Both compounds increased, dose dependently, the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine recognition site. EC50 values for this effect were 3.56 and 15.24 microM for HgCl2 and MeHg, respectively, after 30 min exposure of intact cultured cerebellar granule cells. The increase of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by mercury compounds was completely inhibited by the GABA(A) receptor antagonists bicuculline and picrotoxinin, and by the organochlorine pesticide alpha-endosulfan. It was also partially inhibited by the anion transporter blocker DIDS, however this effect could be due to a possible chelation of mercury by DIDS. Intracellular events, like intracellular calcium, kinase activation/inactivation or antioxidant conditions did not affect [3H]flunitrazepam binding or its increase induced by mercury compounds. The sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide mimicked the effect of mercury compounds on [3H]flunitrazepam binding suggesting a common mechanism. We conclude that mercury compounds interact with the GABA(A) receptor by the way of alkylation of SH groups of cysteinyl residues found in GABA(A) receptor subunit sequences.", 
    "79": "In this cross-sectional study we explored in 101 depressive in-patients (DSM III-R) the association between level of trait anxiety and variables that have been investigated previously to discern primary and secondary depression, respectively. Besides, we explored the influence of trait anxiety level on difference in treatment response to either imipramine or mirtazapine. Trait anxiety was measured interviewing a close relative of the patient using a questionnaire related to aspects of psychic anxiety and to aspects of somatic anxiety. The interviewer focussed on fluctuating anxiety symptoms without persistent mood disturbance during the patient's normal lifelong functioning before developing a depressed mood. We found no relation between trait anxiety level and treatment response to either imipramine or mirtazapine. The most important finding of this study is the significant differential response to the diazepam test: depressive patients with high trait anxiety showed, predominantly, a disappearance of depressive symptoms without sedation and depressive patients with low trait anxiety showed, predominantly, sedation without disappearance of depressive symptoms. The opposite response to the diazepam test in patients with a different history of trait anxiety in spite of similar depressive symptomatology suggests differences in underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.", 
    "80": "The mechanism underlying the Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro sedative effect of clonidine, an alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist, remains uncertain. Because activation of alpha2-adrenoceptors induces release of nitric oxide (NO), we tested the hypothesis that the sedative effect of clonidine depends on NO-related mechanisms. The effect of 7-nitro indazole on the sleeping time induced by clonidine was studied in Wistar rats. In addition, we examined the effect of clonidine, alpha-methyldopa, and midazolam on the thiopental-induced sleeping time in rats pretreated with N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester (L-NAME). The sleeping time induced by clonidine was significantly decreased by 7-nitro indazole. Thiopental sleeping time was increased by clonidine, alpha-methyldopa, and midazolam. L-NAME reduced the prolongation effect of clonidine and alpha-methyldopa, but did not alter the effect of midazolam on the thiopental-induced sleeping time. The inhibitory effect of L-NAME on clonidine-dependent prolongation of thiopental-induced sleeping time was reversed by L-arginine. These results suggest that NO-dependent mechanisms are involved in the sedative effect of clonidine. In addition, this effect seems to be specific for the sedative action of alpha2-adrenoceptors agonists.", 
    "81": "Clonidine, an antihypertensive drug, is also a sedative. This sedative effect, although an adverse event in the treatment of hypertensive patients, can be helpful for sedation of surgical patients. The mechanism of this effect, however, is unknown. In this study, we show that the sedative effect of clonidine is mediated by nitric oxide, because it could be prevented by pretreatment with nitric oxide synthase inhibitors.", 
    "82": "We studied 160 ASA I or II patients undergoing elective otolaryngologic surgery in order to compare the anxiolytic effects of a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A agonist, tandospirone, with diazepam. To monitor preoperative anxiety, the following variables were used: systolic and diastolic arterial pressure, heart rate, and the state anxiety score yielded by the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. We performed pretreatment evaluation on the day before surgery and posttreatment examination immediately after entry into the operating room. In a double-blinded, randomized design, four groups of 40 patients each received one of the following oral medications 90 min before entry into the operating room: 1) tandospirone 10 mg (T10 group); 2) tandospirone 30 mg (T30 group); 3) diazepam 10 mg (D group); or 4) placebo (P group). After premedication, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory state anxiety decreased in the T10 (P < 0.02), T30 (P < 0.02), and D groups (P < 0.001), but it increased in the P group (P < 0.001). Tandospirone, 10 and 30 mg, safely reduced preoperative anxiety to a similar extent as oral diazepam 10 mg in patients undergoing elective otolaryngologic surgery.",

    "84": "Small-dose ketamine in combination with sedative drugs has increasingly been used for sedation and analgesia in local anesthesia. We compared the clinical efficacy of midazolam with two different ketamine infusion regimens during plastic surgery under local anesthesia. Sixty patients undergoing plastic surgery procedures with local anesthesia were randomly assigned to two groups of 30 patients each in a double-blinded fashion. All patients received a bolus of 0.05 mg/kg midazolam, followed by a stepwise infusion: 1.67 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for the first 30 min, then reduced to 1.33 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 90 min and subsequently to 1 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). Two minutes before the infiltration of local anesthetic solution, a bolus of ketamine 0.3 mg/kg IV was administered, followed by a stepwise infusion of ketamine: Group A, 16.67 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 30 min, 13.3 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 90 min, and subsequently 10 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1); Group B, 8.33 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 30 min, 6.67 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 90 min, and then 5 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1). The level of sedation was evaluated by using the modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale. We observed the effects of the two ketamine infusion regimens on sedation levels, respiratory and cardiovascular variables, and perioperative side effects. In both groups, midazolam and ketamine produced adequate sedation (with Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scores of 2-4) without significant respiratory and cardiovascular depression during surgery. However, there were fewer disruptive movements and there was less postoperative vomiting in Group B (P < 0.01). In conclusion, ketamine and midazolam provided satisfactory intraoperative sedation, analgesia, and amnesia in both groups. However, side effects associated with ketamine occurred less often in the smaller-dose ketamine group.", 
    "85": "Sedation and analgesia are often provided during local anesthesia. This study demonstrates that a small-dose ketamine infusion in combination with midazolam provided satisfactory intraoperative sedation, analgesia, and amnesia in healthy plastic-surgery patients when it was used to supplement local anesthesia.", 
    "86": "It is well documented that acute administration of the benzodiazepine hypnotic drug triazolam (Halcion) impairs episodic memory encoding. We examined the neuroanatomical substrates of this effect in healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, within-subject design. Following oral capsule administration (0.25 mg/70 kg triazolam or placebo), regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with 15O-H(2)O during the performance of semantic categorization, orthographic categorization, and visual fixation (resting) tasks. rCBF associated with episodic memory encoding was measured by the difference in rCBF during the orthographic categorization task relative to that during the semantic categorization task. Results in the placebo condition (n = 9) replicated those of previous nonpharmacological encoding studies (activation in the left prefrontal cortex, cerebellum, anterior cingulate cortex, temporal cortex, and occipital cortex). Relative to placebo, results in the triazolam condition (n = 6) revealed significantly impaired memory performance, and deactivation during encoding in a subset of areas shown previously to be associated with encoding (anterior cingulate cortex, cerebellum, and precuneus). Results are discussed in relation to triazolam's effects on mnemonic versus attentional processes.", 
    "87": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density has been found to be sensitive to stress. We set out to compare the influences of acute and repeated swim stress on behavior and PBR density. Following acute and repeated swim stress, rats were tested in an elevated plus-maze and an open-field test for anxiety levels, and tissues were collected from the adrenal gland, kidney, and hippocampus for measurements of PBR density. The acute rather than the repeated stress led to robust alterations in PBR density. The largest reduction in hippocampal and adrenal gland PBR density was found one hour after acute stress. In the hippocampus, acute stress caused a biphasic change in PBR density: a robust reduction in PBR density one hour after the acute stress and a distinct elevation in PBR density at 24 hours, while 72 hours after stress the elevation in PBR density appeared to be reduced.", 
    "88": "Among the ligands of the benzodiazepine site, one can mention the benzodiazepines as agonists and some beta-carbolines (e.g. methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, abbreviated hereafter beta-CCM) as inverse agonists. Most benzodiazepines and beta-carbolines act on processes involved in memory, anxiety, and convulsions with opposite physiological effects. Since these molecules have influences on both anxiety and convulsions, we predicted that there would exist a genetic correlation between anxiety evaluated in an elevated plus-maze and susceptibility to beta-CCM-induced seizures. Using inbred strains of mice, the genetic correlation was estimated with the Hegmann and Possidente model. An absence of genetic correlation was found, showing that the mechanisms responsible for basal anxiety measured with the elevated plus-maze test and those leading to susceptibility to beta-CCM-induced seizures do not share the same genetic pathways.", 
    "89": "We performed a retrospective analysis of data involving 121 inpatients to examine the rate of weight gain during antipsychotic-free periods and during treatment with various antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "90": "Data were analyzed to determine differences in weekly weight change during antipsychotic-free (N = 65), typical antipsychotic (N = 51), or atypical antipsychotic (N = 130) treatment periods. Atypical antipsychotic treatment periods were further subdivided into olanzapine (N = 45), clozapine (N = 47), or risperidone (N = 36) treatment periods. A paired comparison was conducted on 65 patients who had an antipsychotic-free treatment period preceding or following a neuroleptic drug treatment period. In addition, patients were classified as either non-obese (with a body mass index [BMI] < or = 29.9 kg/ml) or obese (BMI > or = 30.0 kg/m2) to test whether the rate of weight gain during treatment periods was related to initial BMI.", 
    "91": "Across all treatment periods, weekly weight gain was as follows: 0.89 lb/wk (0.40 kg/wk) on atypical antipsychotic medication, 0.61 lb/wk (0.27 kg/wk) on typical antipsychotic medication, and 0.21 lb/wk (0.09 kg/wk) on no antipsychotic medications. The atypical antipsychotic versus antipsychotic-free comparison was significant (F = 3.51; df = 2,231; p = .031), while the typical antipsychotic versus antipsychotic-free comparison was not. Among the individual atypical antipsychotic medications, significantly more weight gain occurred during olanzapine treatment (1.70 lb/wk) (0.76 kg/wk) than with either clozapine (0.50 lb/wk) (0.22 kg/wk) or risperidone (0.34 lb/wk) (0.15 kg/wk) treatments (F = 7.77; df = 2,117; p = .001). In the paired analysis with patients serving as their own controls, the difference between weekly weight gain during atypical antipsychotic treatment and antipsychotic-free treatment was significant (t = -3.91; df = 44; p = .001), while the difference between weight gain during typical antipsychotic treatment and antipsychotic-free treatment was not significant. With the individual drugs. treatment with both olanzapine and clozapine caused significantly higher weekly weight gain than antipsychotic-free treatment (p = .001 and p = .036, respectively). while treatment with risperidone did not. Non-obese patients (BMI < 29.9 kg/m2) and obese patients (BMI > 30.0 kg/m2) did not differ significantly in their weight gain during typical or atypical antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "92": "Treatment with atypical antipsychotics was associated with more weight gain than treatment with typical antipsychotics. Among the atypical drugs, olanzapine was associated with more weight gain than either clozapine or risperidone. The patient's admission BMI was not associated with the amount of weight gained during subsequent antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "93": "We report, on two, school-age girls with clinical and electroencephalographic features of early onset childhood epilepsy with occipital paroxysms (CEOP) of the \"Panayiotopoulos type\" that showed atypical evolution. Neurological examination and brain imaging were normal in both. One child presented at age 2.5 years episodes of oculocephalic deviation, and ictal vomiting during nocturnal sleep. The EEG showed left occipital spikes during wakefulness and sleep. One year later, frequent inhibitory seizures appeared in the lower limbs causing, \"pseudoataxic gait\". At the same time she presented with behavioral disturbances and aphasia. EEG showed bilateral spike-waves while awake and continuous spike-waves during slow sleep (CSWSS). After switching AEDs to benzodiazepines, control of seizures along with improvement of behavior, and partial restoration of cognitive functions were achieved. The CSWSS disappeared and the last EEG at age 8 years only showed only isolated right occipital spikes. The other girl had a personal and familial history of febrile seizures. At 4 years of age she presented the first non-febrile seizures during sleep, with oculocephalic deviation and ictal vomiting, followed by a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Partial control of seizures was obtained with antiepileptic drugs. At age 7, the child began to have weekly episodes of oculocephalic version, occasionally with secondary generalization. Repeated inhibitory seizures and absences also appeared. EEG showed frequent bilateral spikes occupying predominantly the posterior regions while awake, and CSWSS. At 7.5 years the same electro-clinical picture persisted. Ethosuximide was added to sodium valproate and clobazam. Fifteen days later, the seizures disappeared and the EEG showed less frequent bilateral occipital spikes. She is now 9 years old and she has been seizure-free for 18 months. Her present neuropsychological profile shows mild mental retardation. The two children with typical electroclinical features of \"Panayiotopoulos Type\" CEOP developed an atypical evolution which, to our knowledge, has not been described previously.", 
    "94": "In antiepileptic drugs, the marked inter- and intrapatient variability of the level-dose ratio makes it difficult to predict serum concentrations from the administered per kg dose. It is therefore important to identify factors, such as age and comedication, that could contribute to this observed variability.",

    "97": "The CZP L/D ratio increased slowly with age up to 15 years in patients on monotherapy. Associated antiepileptic therapy affected the CZP L/D ratio, which was significantly reduced in patients on polytherapy as compared to patients on monotherapy.", 
    "98": "The study therefore suggests that routine monitoring of CZP serum levels is extremely useful, especially in the paediatric age group, and in patients who require associated antiepileptic medication.",

    "101": "Passiflora extract and oxazepam were effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. No significant difference was observed between the two protocols at the end of trial. Oxazepam showed a rapid onset of action. On the other hand, significantly more problems relating to impairment of job performance were encountered with subjects on oxazepam.", 
    "102": "The results suggest that Passiflora extract is an effective drug for the management of generalized anxiety disorder, and the low incidence of impairment of job performance with Passiflora extract compared to oxazepam is an advantage. A large-scale trial is justified.",

As with the cyclic peptides, the presence of all three Rhodopeptin side chains was found to be indispensable for peptidomimetic activity. We discovered new compounds exhibiting greater antifungal activity and improved physiochemical properties in comparison to the parent compounds.", 
    "104": "[reaction: see text]. Novel nonpeptide peptidomimetics of the antifungal cyclic peptide Rhodopeptin were designed utilizing hydantoin, benzimidazole, D-glucosamine, quinolone, and benzodiazepine units as scaffolds.

    "105": "The currently used antidotal treatment of intoxication with nerve agents, consisting of an anticholinergic drug and an acetylcholinesterase reactivator, is often completed with the anticonvulsive drug diazepam to prevent poisoned organisms from centrally mediated seizures and subsequent tonic-clonic convulsions. The aim of this study was to find out whether the complementation of the antidotal treatment with diazepam can influence antidotal treatment-induced elimination of acute lethal effects of the chosen nerve agent--soman.", 
    "106": "In experiments on mice, the values of medium lethal dose of soman in the case of 24 h surviving of soman-exposed mice, treated with the basic antidotes involving various types of anticholinergic drugs and acetylcholinesterase reactivators, were evaluated and compared to the values of medium lethal dose of soman in mice treated with antidotes completed with diazepam. Our findings confirm that diazepam is able to enhance the efficacy of basic antidotal treatment to eliminate acute lethal effects of soman if atropin is used as anticholinergic drug. On the other hand, no ability of diazepam to enhance soman-induced lethal effects was demonstrated if an anticholinergic drug with central effects such as benactyzine, biperiden or scopolamin was used. The ability of diazepam to influence the efficacy of antidotes to eliminate soman-induced acute lethal effects was only observed in the case of using the oxime HI-6 as acetycholinesterase reactivator.", 
    "107": "The most perspective antidotal mixture against soman, consisting of the oxime HI-6 and atropine, should be complemented by diazepam no only because of the prevention of poisoned organisms from centrally mediated seizures and subsequent tonic-clonic convulsions but also because of the increase in the ability of antidotal treatment to eliminate soman-induced acute lethal effects.", 
    "108": "Benzodiazepines are well tolerated by young adults whereas in elderly people they are less safe and globally induce more central nervous system side-effects and falls. Falls result from a decrease of vigilance and an alteration of postural reflex. This latter includes the reception of sensory information and central integration modulated mainly by dopaminergic D2 receptors and motor stimulation. Benzodiazepines act simultaneously on the three stages, decreasing their efficacy. The risk increases when certain other drugs are coprescribed, especially synergistic drugs such as another psycholeptic drug, an aminoside or a centrally active antihypertensive drug. Thus their co-prescription with a benzodiazepine increases the risk of falls. The pharmacokinetic parameters of benzodiazepines may be modified or remain constant during ageing. The choice of molecules whose parameters do not vary seems advisable. Whatever the selected benzodiazepine, it is obvious that it must be administered at the lowest possible dose, this dose being increased only if necessary, the overall prescription being time limited.", 
    "109": "For many years, the use of benzodiazepines has been particularly high in France. This use can be described through pharmacy delivery. A cross-sectional one-day survey was conducted in June 1999, within a randomly selected network of community pharmacies in Aquitaine. Pharmacists were asked to interview each patient presenting with a prescription form including at least one benzodiazepine. A total of 58 pharmacies participated in this study; 328 patients were included representing 356 benzodiazepines prescribed. Among the 20 different benzodiazepines concerned, bromazepam, lorazepam and alprazolam represented more than half (54 per cent) of the prescriptions. The mean age of the patients was 62 years (median: 64) and 70 per cent of them were women. Most patients (93 per cent) were known to the pharmacist and 86 per cent had benzodiazepines prescribed by a single physician. In most cases (77 per cent), the prescribed benzodiazepine had been used for more than one year and in one quarter for more than five years. For 81 per cent of chronic users, no dose increase was observed. This study confirmed that long-term use of benzodiazepines is frequent, particularly in the elderly. This use is commonly accepted by health professionals as well as by patients, although it clearly reflects the dependence potential of benzodiazepines.", 
    "110": "The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of homeopathic drugs Hom\u00e9og\u00e8ne 46 and S\u00e9datif PC with a placebo as substitute for benzodiazepines in patients treated for at least 3 months with low doses (less than 10 mg/d of diazepam equivalents). A double-blind randomized trial was carried out in general practice. The treatment lasted one month. Several rating scales were used. The main outcome was success/failure defined according to the doctor's clinical judgement and interruption of treatment. A total of 61 patients were randomized, and 19 interrupted their treatment. Comparability between the groups was good. No statistically significant difference between homeopathic drugs and placebo was observed for the main outcome or for the secondary outcomes. The lack of statistical power due to accrual difficulties limits the conclusions of this trial which did not confirm the efficacy of homeopathic drugs in this indication.", 
    "111": "There are three areas in which functional imaging may be applied to malformations of cortical development (MCD) that give rise to epilepsy: the localization of epileptic activity; the identification of areas of functional abnormality; the mapping of normal cerebral functions, and how these may be displaced. Single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) commonly shows interictal hypoperfusion and ictal hyperperfusion. Positron emission tomography (PET), using (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose, often shows glucose metabolism in ectopic grey matter and hypometabolism in MCD, compared with normal cortex. Cognitive activation tasks, using PET or fMRI, have shown that malformed cortex may participate in cerebral functions, but also widespread atypical cortical organization. Cognitive activation tasks using fMRI are useful when planning surgical resections close to eloquent cortex. Binding of (11)C-flumazenil to central benzodiazepine receptors (cBZR) is often abnormal in MCD, and in areas of cortex that appear normal on MRI, with increased and decreased binding. MR Spectroscopy also reveals abnormalities that are more extensive than the MRI visible lesion, implying more widespread structural and functional abnormalities. The recording of EEG during fMRI has allowed the latter to be used to localize cerebral areas involved in the generation of interictal epileptiform activity. Electroencephalograph source localization and magneto-encephalography may also prove to be useful in the localization of interictal epileptiform activity, particularly when fMRI data are used to constrain the solutions.", 
    "112": "The neurosteroid allopregnanolone, a reduced metabolite of progesterone, induces anxiolytic effects by enhancing GABA(A) receptor function. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GABA are thought to interact functionally in the amygdala, and this interaction may be important in the regulation of anxiety. By using Y(1)R/LacZ transgenic mice, which harbour a fusion construct comprising the promoter of the mouse gene for the Y(1) receptor for NPY linked to the lacZ gene, we previously showed that long-term treatment with benzodiazepine receptor ligands modulates Y(1) receptor gene expression in the medial amygdala. We have now investigated the effects of prolonged treatment with progesterone or allopregnanolone on Y(1)R/LacZ transgene expression, as determined by quantitative histochemical analysis of beta-galactosidase activity. Progesterone increased both the cerebrocortical concentration of allopregnanolone and beta-galactosidase expression in the medial amygdala. Finasteride, a 5alpha-reductase inhibitor, prevented both of these effects. Long-term administration of allopregnanolone also increased both the cortical concentration of this neurosteroid and transgene expression in the medial amygdala. Treatment with neither progesterone nor allopregnanolone affected beta-galactosidase activity in the medial habenula. These data suggest that allopregnanolone regulates Y(1) receptor gene expression through modulation of GABA(A) receptor function, and they provide further support for a functional interaction between GABA and neuropeptide Y in the amygdala.", 
    "113": "Analysis of respiratory mechanics using impulse oscillometry is applicable to sedated, or non-sedated (trained) pigs when they are fixed in a sling. In this study, the influence of the following sources of variability on measurement results was examined: (i) sedation with diazepam; (ii) body weight of animals (ranging in age: 40 to 102 days); and (iii) time of the measurement (circadian influences). The following parameters were examined: respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (v(t)), spectral resistance, reactance and coherence, each at 5, 10, 15 and 20 Hz (R5,...R20, X5,...X20, CO5...CO20, respectively), distal respiratory resistance (Rdist), and proximal airway resistance (Rprox). After sedation (using 1.5 mg diazepam per kg body weight), RR and v(t) decreased significantly. There was a significant improvement of CO5, CO10 and CO15. Increase in body weight was strongly correlated to v(t), furthermore to spectral resistance parameters. Impulse oscillometry system (IOS) parameters showed only slight non-significant alterations in dependency on the time of day. In consequence, different sources of variability must be taken into account when performing IOS measurements in swine.", 
    "114": "The management of depression is often complicated by comorbid psychiatric illness. Incomplete diagnoses or inadequate treatment can severely limit a patient's improvement. However, careful diagnosis and straightforward treatment can relieve suffering and restore function. This article will examine recent research investigating the coexistence of depression with a number of different anxiety disorders and review literature on the prevalence and recognition of depression with comorbid anxiety disorders. Finally, current data on treatment will be discussed, with a focus on optimal treatment approaches and duration of treatment.", 
    "115": "Nocturia is one of the major problems of elderly people. The possible causes of nocturia include irritation of lower urinary tract obstruction, disturbance of the fluid balance, and sleep disturbance. In a significant proportion of patients, the mechanism of nocturia is still unclear and a definitive method of treatment has yet to be determined. This study investigated how to treat nocturia.", 
    "116": "We analyzed 51 patients who visited Kobe City General Hospital between January 1998 and June 1999 with nocturia (three or more nocturnal voidings) and no daytime urological problems. Twenty-two of these patients were given daytime diuretic therapy (azosemide 60 mg), while 29 other patients received a minor tranquilizer. The method of treatment was selected randomly. Correlations between the plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide (hANP) and the effect of treatment were analyzed.", 
    "117": "Daytime diuretics decreased the nocturnal frequency of voiding in 10 out of 22 patients. The plasma hANP level at the first visit was significantly higher in the patients with improvement (p = 0.0026). Furthermore, the plasma hANP level was significantly decreased after daytime diuretic therapy in patients who showed improvement of nocturia with diuretic therapy (p = 0.0180). Minor tranquilizer administration decreased nocturia in 22 out of 29 patients. The plasma hANP level at the first visit was significantly lower in the patients who improved (p = 0.0021).", 
    "118": "These findings suggest that patients with higher plasma hANP levels should be treated as having subclinical heart failure, while nocturia in patients with a normal plasma hANP level might be caused by sleep disturbance.", 
    "119": "This prospective study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midazolam as a sedative agent in 14 critically ill patients without coma admitted to the intensive care unit at Nihon University Itabashi Hospital, Japan. Adequate sedation (sedation score [SS] 4-6) was induced with 0.058- 0.372 mg/ kg midazolam and maintained with a dose range of 0.03-0.4 mg/kg per h. Most burn or trauma patients required higher midazolam doses than patients with cardiovascular disease. The most frequent adverse events observed were hypotension, heart-rate fluctuation and electrocardiogram abnormalities. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the population suggested that lower drug clearance rates correlated with presence of complications. Plasma concentrations (EC50) of SS 5, estimated by logistic regression analysis, varied among patients (mean 194 ng/ml). Midazolam infusion achieved successful sedation in this critical care setting, but the optimum dose differed by patient and was influenced by the presence of complications.", 
    "120": "This prospective, phase II study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midazolam as a sedative agent in nine critically ill Japanese patients without coma who had been admitted to an intensive care unit. An adequate level of sedation (sedative score [SS] 4-6) was induced by midazolam 0.14 - 0.39 mg/kg and maintained with a dose range of 0.08 - 0.24 mg/kg per h. One patient was excluded from the efficacy analysis since optimum sedation was not maintained by continuous infusion. The percentage of time during which SS 5 was achieved varied among the patients. The most frequent adverse events were hypotension, partial pressure of carbon dioxide elevation and premature ventricular contraction. Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that lower drug clearance rates were correlated with the presence of complications. The 50% of effective concentration values of SS 5, estimated by logistic regression analysis, varied greatly (mean, 251 ng/ml). In conclusion, midazolam infusion achieved successful sedation in this critical care setting. The optimum dose differed among the patients, however, and was influenced by the presence of complications.",

    "122": "A seven-year-old boy with sickle cell anemia was admitted to the emergency department with severe pain unresponsive to high doses of oral acetaminophen; subsequently, intravenous codeine phosphate was administered. The patient immediately developed a tonic-clonic seizure, which was treated with intravenous diazepam and naloxone.", 
    "123": "Seizures associated with the intravenous administration of codeine phosphate have not been extensively reported in the literature, and special precautions for using the parenteral route for this drug have been vague and limited. Because of the frequent need for acute pain control in children with sicke cell crisis, they may be exposed to this type of reaction when intravenous narcotics are administered. The need for clear guidelines regarding the drug's appropriate parenteral dosing and administration is essential.", 
    "124": "Codeine phosphate-induced seizures are not common. The need for special instructions for its intravenous administration may prevent this type of reaction, especially in patients in need of acute pain control requiring intravenous narcotics.", 
    "125": "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarctions and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) was first reported in European families and since 1993 it has been observed in America, Africa and Asia, suggesting that today the disease probably still remains largely underdiagnosed. CADASIL appears to be essentially a disorder of the arteries linked to single missense mutations in the Notch3 gene locus on chromosome 19; the aberrant dimerisation of Notch3, due to abnormal disulphide bridging with another Notch3 molecule or with another protein, may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disorder. It is characterized by recurrent stroke episodes and focal neurologic deficits progressing to pseudobulbar palsy and dementia, caused by multiple lacunar infarctions with ischemic and diffuse white matter abnormalities on neuroimaging. Migraine with aura, epileptic seizures and affective disorders are frequent additional symptoms of CADASIL. It is usually observed in the 3rd decade, but some individuals remain asymptomatic close to the age of 60. MRI displays a marked leukoencephalopathy in affected individuals as early as in the age of 20. The authors emphasize the role of a direct DNA test for gene mutation to make a differential diagnosis between CADASIL and other forms of vascular leukoencephalopathy as Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis and Binswanger's subcortical arteriopathic encephalopathy where CADASIL's arteriopathy is characterized by major alterations of vascular smooth muscle cells and the presence of specific granular osmiophilic deposits.", 
    "126": "There is an asymmetry between the extraordinary development of measures and tools aimed at studying the beneficial effects of the drugs and the more limited methods to assess their safety profile. The goal of our study was to develop a global measuring tool to assess drugs' safety. We conducted a survey of Spanish psychiatrists in mental health centers and outpatient treatment units to assess the severity scores that they would assign to a list of the most common adverse events (AEs) that usually occur with antipsychotic treatment. The severity scores were then applied to the list of AEs that really occurred along a naturalistic pharmacoepidemiological study on the use of different antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia. The Global Index of Safety (GIS) of the experimental group treated with olanzapine (OLZ) was compared with the GIS of the control group and with the GIS of specific antipsychotics for which the number of treated patients was greater than 100. A total of 194 psychiatrists rated the severity of each AE on a scale of 1 (insignificant) to 5 (extremely severe). The individual severity was applied to the 2949 schizophrenic patients included in a pharmacoepidemiological study. A GIS was calculated for every group of patients receiving the same treatments. The GIS of the control group was higher (4.3) than that calculated from the experimental group (2.5) (P < 0.001). The GIS of the risperidone (3.6) and haloperidol (6.0) subgroups were higher than that calculated from the OLZ group (P < 0.001). The development of a GIS may facilitate the comparison of the safety of several drugs and may constitute a very valuable aid for those involved in selecting drugs.", 
    "127": "We investigated the effect of the phosphodiesterase type 4 (PDE4) inhibitory activity of diazepam on the arterial wall. To this purpose, we examined the interaction of diazepam with 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-elevating agents on vasodilatation and cyclic AMP levels in rat aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine. The involvement of benzodiazepine receptors was also studied. Diazepam (5-100 microM) produced a relaxation of this preparation which was neither mimicked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), nor antagonized by flumazenil and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK 11195), inhibitors of central or peripheral type benzodiazepine receptors, respectively. The diazepam-induced relaxation was potentiated by the presence of isoprenaline (10 nM), forskolin (50 nM) or milrinone (0.1 microM). Furthermore, diazepam increased the enhancement of cyclic AMP levels induced by these three agents in this tissue. Our results demonstrate a functional and biochemical synergistic interaction of diazepam with cyclic AMP-elevating agents on rat aortic rings.", 
    "128": "Gemcitabine (1) is a promising new anticancer agent used in pancreatic cancer. Improvement in the selective targeting of compound 1 and other cytotoxic agents to solid tumors may be enhanced by conjugation to ligands that target peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) located on mitochondria and known to be overexpressed in human brain tumors. Development of such chemical conjugates requires selective protection on 4-NH(2), 3'-OH, and 5'-OH of compound 1. All three monoprotected and three diprotected gemcitabine derivatives (2 to 7) were synthesized in good yield by employing a single commonly used protecting reagent, di-tert-butyl dicarbonate, under different conditions. Consequently, the three mono-ligand-gemcitabine conjugates coupled at 4-NH(2), 3'-OH, and 5'-OH respectively (14 to 16) were synthesized in high yield using the PBR ligand PK11195. This selective protection/deprotection strategy offers a relatively straightforward means to modify other nucleosides.", 
    "129": "A short and efficient synthesis of the novel 1,4,2-benzodiazaphosphepin-5-one 2-oxide ring system, a phosphonamidate isostere of the 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-dione system, has been carried out in good overall yield. The key step is the base-induced cyclization of (2-aminobenzamido)methylphosphonates 6a-c to the 1,4,2-benzodiazaphosphepin-5-one 2-oxides 7a-c. Alkylation of 7b with methyl iodide gives the expected N-methyl analogue 9. When a tandem one-pot cyclization/alkylation is carried out from 6b in the presence of excess base, the sole isolable product obtained is the phosphonate 13, presumably via ethanolysis of a transiently formed 9. Carrying out the tandem cyclization/alkylation in the absence of excess base, however, affords only 9. Thionation of 7 with Lawesson's reagent occurs at either the phosphonamidate oxygen (P-2) or the amide carbonyl (C-5) depending on the steric constraint of the N-4 substituent.", 
    "130": "St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) is a popular over-the-counter dietary supplement and herbal remedy that has been implicated in drug interactions with substrates of several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes.

    "131": "Twelve healthy subjects (5 female, 7 male) completed this 3-period, open-label, fixed schedule study. Tolbutamide (CYP2C9), caffeine (CYP1A2), dextromethorphan (CYP2D6), oral midazolam (intestinal wall and hepatic CYP3A), and intravenous midazolam (hepatic CYP3A) were administered before, with short-term St John's wort dosing (900 mg), and after 2 weeks of intake (300 mg 3 times a day) to determine CYP activities.", 
    "132": "Short-term administration of St John's wort had no effect on CYP activities. Long-term St John's wort administration caused a significant (P <.05) increase in oral clearance of midazolam from 121.8 +/- 70.7 to 254.5 +/- 127.8 and a corresponding significant decline in oral bioavailability from 0.28 +/- 0.15 to 0.17 +/- 0.06. In contrast to the >50% decrease in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) when midazolam was administered orally, long-term St John's wort administration caused a 20% decrease in AUC when midazolam was given intravenously. There was no change in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, or CYP2D6 activities as a result of St John's wort administration.", 
    "133": "Long-term St John's wort administration resulted in a significant and selective induction of CYP3A activity in the intestinal wall. St John's wort did not alter the CYP2C9, CYP1A2, or CYP2D6 activities. Reduced therapeutic efficacy of drugs metabolized by CYP3A should be anticipated during long-term administration of St John's wort.", 
    "134": "Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is often diagnosed based on abolition of rhythmic sharp waves by benzodiazepines. It is possible that sharp waves resulting from metabolic (nonepileptic) encephalopathies may also respond to benzodiazepines and are potentially misdiagnosed as NCSE. The authors hypothesized that triphasic waves (TW) resulting from metabolic encephalopathy are abolished by benzodiazepines. They retrospectively identified patients with TW resulting from metabolic encephalopathy who had EEG recordings before, during, and after benzodiazepine administration. Benzodiazepines were given either because of the possibility of NCSE or for a medically indicated purpose. All patients were diagnosed definitively with a metabolic cause of encephalopathy and not NCSE. Ten patients (mean age, 59 years) met the criteria and were reviewed. TW resolved persistently in four patients and intermittently in six patients. Background activity slowed in five patients and was attenuated in five patients. Unresponsive patients did not arouse and three of five drowsy patients became less responsive. Rhythmic sharp waves resulting from metabolic encephalopathy are abolished by benzodiazepines, similar to NCSE, but without improvement in mental status. This suggests that definitive electrographic diagnosis of primary NCSE should not be based entirely on abolition of sharp waves by benzodiazepines. This also implies that gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission is important in the expression of TW.", 
    "135": "A strain of Wistar rats, genetic absence epilepsy rats from Strasbourg (GAERS), was selected and inbred over 40 generations for occurrence of spontaneous spike-wave discharges characteristic of absence seizures, simultaneously with a strain of non-epileptic rats (NER). GAERS demonstrate an excessive sensitivity to antagonists of the GABA(A) receptor. The sensitivity to convulsions induced by various inverse agonists of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor was compared in GAERS and NERs. The beta-carbolines FG 7142 and DMCM, and the imidazobenzodiazepines RO 19-4603 and the alpha 5-selective RY 024 were several times more convulsant in GAERS than in NERs. The largest differences were found with the non-selective RO 19-4603- and FG 7142. The proconvulsant imidazobenzodiazepine RO 15-4513, binding also to diazepam-insensitive receptors, had low efficacy. The high affinity binding of GABA(A)/BZD receptors with (3H) RO 15-1788 in the brain of naive rats and after administration of FG 7142 did not differ in GAERS and NERs. The data indicate that the hypersensitivity of GAERS to various inverse agonists of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor involves cortical GABA(A) receptors and is not related to differential activity of a subunit-selective receptor.", 
    "136": "The benzodiazepine flunitrazepam is extensively prescribed to patients with insomnia in many countries, but has also become popular among alcohol- and drug abusers. Several reports indicate that it is used as a date rape drug and suggest that it may precipitate violent behavior. Furthermore, flunitrazepam is involved in many fatal intoxications in Sweden. This study was designed and conducted to explore the negative consequences of flunitrazepam abuse in Sweden, and to assess the trends in its use and abuse. The occurrence of flunitrazepam in cases referred to the Department of Forensic Chemistry in Link\u00f6ping, Sweden 1992-1998, was investigated in detail. The detections were studied separately for different groups; medicolegal death investigations, drug abuse cases, driving under influence cases, and other medicolegal cases. These data were further compared with the sales, and seizures by the Swedish Customs and the Swedish Police. During 1992-1998, 641 fatalities occurred, where the cause of death was attributed to intoxication with flunitrazepam solely (130) or in combination with other drugs, or concomitant conditions (511). In 78% of all driving under influence cases, where flunitrazepam was detected, the analyses also disclosed the presence of illicit drugs. A similar association was seen in drug abuse cases. The seizures reported by the Swedish Customs revealed a substantial and increasing illegal trade. Cases, where flunitrazepam seemingly induced violent behavior were identified, and one of these is described in some detail. It is concluded that the abuse pattern and the toxicity of flunitrazepam should be kept in mind by forensic investigators and that this panorama also should be considered when decisions about the registration and classification of flunitrazepam are made in different countries.", 
    "137": "Low, medium, and high doses of flunitrazepam were tested in three independent randomized, double-blind, balanced cross-over, placebo-controlled trials to study the influence of rate of onset of effects and dose administered on its acute effects. Three groups of 12 healthy male volunteers received six oral doses of placebo or flunitrazepam in slow and fast onset conditions as follows: six capsules of 0.16 mg (slow) and a single capsule of 0.8 mg (fast) in the low dose trial; six 0.25 mg (slow) and a single 1.25 mg (fast) capsules for medium dose; and six 0.4 mg (slow) and a single 2 mg (fast) capsule for high dose. At each dose level, slow or fast increasing flunitrazepam plasma concentrations lead to similar peak levels, but induced differential subjective and behavioral effects. In addition to objective and subjective sedation, flunitrazepam induced some pleasurable feelings, which were more intense in the fast than in the slow conditions. At the highest dose, unpleasant sedative effects surmounted positive effects, while at the lowest dose pleasurable effects were of low intensity. At the medium dose, the balance between pleasurable and unpleasant feelings resulted in euphorigenic effects, which were evident in the fast condition but were blunted in the slow condition.", 
    "138": "Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells were found to be vulnerable to kainate excitotoxic insults, an effect inhibited by either the selective alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466)) or the selective group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor agonist, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine. The protective effects of (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine were reversed by the selective mGlu receptor antagonist, (S)-alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. These data suggest that group I mGlu receptors may limit oligodendrocyte progenitor cell degeneration during acute brain insults.", 
    "139": "We investigated whether stress induces the release of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and dopamine from the nucleus accumbens in conscious rats and characterized the stress-induced response. Electrical foot-shock stress induced both DOPA and dopamine release, measured by microdialysis, from the nucleus accumbens in freely moving rats. Pretreatment of rats with mecamylamine completely blocked stress-induced DOPA release, but only partially blocked dopamine release. Diazepam did not affect the foot-shock-induced release of DOPA, while the same dose of diazepam partially blocked the stress-induced release of dopamine. These findings suggest a tonic function of central nicotinic receptors in stress-induced DOPA release from the nucleus accumbens in conscious rats.", 
    "140": "We assessed the anxiolytic effect of Kami-Shoyo-San (Jia-wei-xiao-yao-san; TJ-24), one of a traditional Chinese herbal medicine used for the treatment of menopausal anxiety, by the social interaction (SI) test in male mice. Acute administration of TJ-24 (25-100 mg/kg, p.o.), as well as the gamma-amino-butyric acidA/benzodiazepine (GABA(A)/BZP) receptor agonist diazepam (1-3 mg/kg, i.p.), dose dependently increased the SI time, respectively. The GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin blocked the effects of TJ-24 and diazepam. TJ-24-induced SI behavior was significantly blocked by the GABA(A)/BZP receptor inverse agonist Ro 15-4513 and the GABA(A)/BZP receptor antagonist flumazenil. In addition, 5alpha-reductase inhibitor finasteride potently blocked the effect of TJ-24 without attenuating the basal level by itself. These findings suggest that TJ-24 shows the anxiolytic effect through the neurosteroid synthesis followed by GABA(A)/BDZ receptor stimulations.", 
    "141": "Neurocognitive deficits are an enduring characteristic of schizophrenia, and remain prominent in patients whose positive symptoms have decreased after treatment with typical neuroleptics. Recent research has reported that olanzapine improves cognitive functioning in relapsing schizophrenia followed in an outpatient setting. Whether olanzapine will have an effect on improving cognitive function in chronic schizophrenics who have been hospitalized for long periods of time, and have shown a poor response to other conventional and atypical neuroleptics, has not been established. This study investigated cognitive function in chronic medication refractory schizophrenics who were treated with olanzapine or haloperidol in a double-blind study for 8 wk, and followed in an open olanzapine study for several additional months. Patients were evaluated with psychopathology rating scales and a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline, end of double-blind and end of open-label phases of the study. At the end of the double-blind phase there were no significant differences between olanzapine and haloperidol, except for a trend for improvement on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test on olanzapine, which was significant at traditional but not corrected significance levels. After an additional 3 months of treatment with olanzapine doses of 20-40 mg/d, our statistical analysis showed significant improvement on overall neuropsychological test performance and specific cognitive tasks assessing verbal memory. However, these open-label results are difficult to interpret definitively because of the lack of a comparison drug group and the olanzapine dose escalation over time. Neurocognitive changes were not correlated with changes in psychopathology as assessed by PANSS or SANS scores.", 
    "142": "Hemiballismus has traditionally been linked to lesions in the subthalamic nucleus.", 
    "143": "We studied six patients with hemiballismus presumably caused by ischaemic stroke. They were followed for up to two years.", 
    "144": "Cerebral MRI with special projections showed that four out of six patients had ischaemic lesions in other parts of the brain than the subthalamic nucleus. Knowledge of the basalganglio-thalamocortical circuits is used to try to explain the cause of hemiballismus. Neuroleptics and benzodiazepines are the usual medical treatment for hemiballism and were helpful also in our patients. The prognosis in hemiballismus is good; four of our six patients had spontaneous recovery within nine months.", 
    "145": "The prognosis was not related to the site of the lesion.", 
    "146": "The peptide hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) plays an important role in the gastrointestinal tract. The rat pancreatic CCK receptor is a highly glycosylated membrane receptor that is able to bind to plant lectins such as wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Ulex europaeus agglutinin (UEA-I).", 
    "147": "We used both lectins to block this receptor for studying the pathophysiologic relevance of its oligosaccharide side chains. In the present study we investigated the influence of WGA and UEA-I on CCK-8-induced alpha-amylase secretion of the rat pancreatic tumor cell line AR42J, which expresses both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors.", 
    "148": "Under the influence of WGA (25 microg/mL), the alpha-amylase release was reduced by 25% after 30 minutes compared with the hormone-stimulated controls. UEA-I (25 microg/mL) caused a reduction of 20%. The simultaneous application of the lectins with CCK antagonists L 364,718 or L 365,260 led to a reduction of secretion, but the assignment to CCK-A or CCK-B receptors was not possible.", 
    "149": "In long-term studies, both lectins revealed no toxic or apoptosis-inducing effects. On the contrary, WGA showed an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and led to improved differentiation of cells.", 
    "150": "Increase in extracellular Mg2+ concentration ([Mg2+]o) reduces Ca2+ accumulation during reoxygenation of hypoxic cardiomyocytes and exerts protective effects. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of increased [Mg(2+)](o) on Ca2+ influx and efflux, free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) and Mg2+ concentrations ([Mg2+]i), Ca2+ accumulation in the presence of inhibitors of mitochondrial or sarcoplasmatic reticulum Ca2+ transport, and finally mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta(psi)m). Isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes were exposed to 1 h of hypoxia and subsequent reoxygenation. Cell Ca2+ was determined by 45Ca2+ uptake, and the levels of [Mg2+]i and [Ca2+]i were determined by flow cytometry as the fluorescence of magnesium green and fluo 3, respectively. Ca2+ influx rate was significantly reduced by approximately 40%, whereas Ca2+ efflux was not affected by increased [Mg2+]o (5 mM) during reoxygenation. [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i were increased at the end of hypoxia, fell after reoxygenation, and were unaffected by increased [Mg2+]o. Clonazepam, a selective mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange inhibitor (100 microM), significantly reduced Ca2+ accumulation by 70% and in combination with increased [Mg2+]o by 90%. Increased [Mg2+]o, clonazepam, and the combination of both attenuated the hypoxia-reoxygenation-induced reduction in Delta(psi)m, determined with the cationic dye JC-1 by flow cytometry. A significant inverse correlation was observed between Delta(psi)m and cell Ca2+ in reoxygenated cells treated with increased [Mg2+]o and clonazepam. In conclusion, increased [Mg2+]o (5 mM) inhibits Ca2+ accumulation by reducing Ca2+ influx and preserves Delta(psi)m without affecting [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i during reoxygenation. Preservation of mitochondria may be an important effect whereby increased [Mg2+]o protects the postischemic heart.", 
    "151": "The purpose of this study was to investigate early electroclinical manifestations and evaluate treatment responses by video-EEG in infants with newly diagnosed spasms. Spasms were recorded in 44 infants (27 males, 17 females) before adequate treatment. Mean ages at onset of spasms and at first video-EEG were 5.3 months (range 0.9 to 9 months) and 5.9 months (range 2.4 to 11.5 months) respectively. Thirteen infants had cryptogenic and 31 had symptomatic aetiology. First treatment was vigabatrin in 36 infants. All infants were followed until 12 months of age or death. Treatment response in the first months of therapy was assessed by repeated video-EEG studies in 23 infants. On the first video-EEG, 34 infants had typical symmetric motor spasms, three infants showed asymmetric or asynchronous behaviour, and seven infants had only subtle spasms. Interictal EEG showed hypsarrhythmia in 27 infants and multifocal spikes with normal or nearly normal background in 17 infants. Subtle spasms, asymmetric or asynchronous spasms, and asymmetric ictal or interictal EEG abnormalities were associated with symptomatic aetiology and poor cognitive and seizure outcome at 12 months. Serial video-EEG recordings showed a transition from motor to subtle spasms during the first 2 weeks of vigabatrin therapy in four infants and only subtle spasms in two therapy-resistant infants at 12 months. Cessation of spasms usually preceded disappearance of hypsarrhythmia or multifocal spikes, but persistence of multifocal spikes over several weeks was always associated with existing spasms. Transition of hypsarrhythmia into multifocal spikes was observed during vigabatrin therapy even in infants with intractable spasms. Initial diagnosis of infantile spasms requires video-EEG studies especially in infants with symptomatic aetiology who may show only subtle spasms. Video-EEG is the only reliable method for assessing treatment response as spasms and interictal EEG abnormalities are modified by treatment and may become subtle.", 
    "152": "We report a rare case of Alprazolam poisoning presented with coma and respiratory depression in a young girl with positive family history of suicidal attempts by her father, mother and sister. The Alprazolam was available in large amount in form of \"Physicians Samples\" as her elder sister was a medical representative. The patient was successfully managed.", 
    "153": "Adverse reactions caused by benzodiazepines rarely occur. We present a case of a 70-year-old man who developed a maculopapular exanthema after the ingestion of tetrazepam. For his diagnosis, skin tests were performed, including prick and patch tests, not only with the benzodiazepine implicated in the reaction, but also with benzodiazepines of other groups. Single-blind oral challenge tests were also performed in the patient, in order to assess his tolerance to other benzodiazepines.", 
    "154": "Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is becoming more widely used in children and adolescents. There have been reports of olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in adults. This case report describes the development of both hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia in a male adolescent that resolved with discontinuation of olanzapine and without dietary changes or the use of insulin or oral hypoglycemics.", 
    "155": "The goal of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania in children and adolescents.", 
    "156": "This was an 8-week, open-label, prospective study of olanzapine monotherapy (dose range 2.5-20 mg/day) involving 23 bipolar youths (manic, mixed, or hypomanic; 5-14 years old). Weekly assessments were made using the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Children's Depression Rating Scale. Adverse events were assessed through self-reports, vital sign and weight monitoring, laboratory analytes, and extrapyramidal symptom rating scales (Barnes Akathisia Scale, Simpson-Angus Scale, and Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale).", 
    "157": "Twenty-two of the 23 youths (96%) completed the study. Olanzapine treatment was associated with significant improvement in mean YMRS score (-19.0 +/- 9.2, p < 0.001). Using predefined criteria for improvement of > or = 30% decline in the YMRS and a CGI-S Mania score of < or = 3 at endpoint, the overall response rate was 61%. Overall, olanzapine was well tolerated, and extrapyramidal symptom measures were not significantly different from baseline. Body weight increased significantly over the study (5.0 +/- 2.3 kg, p < 0.001).", 
    "158": "Open-label olanzapine treatment was efficacious and well tolerated in the treatment of acute mania in youths with bipolar disorder. Future placebo-controlled, double-blind studies are warranted.", 
    "159": "Because of the paucity of information on the epidemiology of acute poisoning requiring intensive medical care, all such patients treated on the medical intensive care unit of the university hospital in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, between January 1993 and December 1999, were retrospectively evaluated.", 
    "160": "Of the total of 6211 patients, 147 (80 women, 67 men, mean age 41 years, 2,3 %) were treated for acute intoxication in the intensive care unit.", 
    "161": "Reasons for admission to the intensive care unit were the need for ventilator treatment or intensive monitoring of vital functions. 52 % of the patients (n = 76) had attempted suicide, most of them using anti-depressive drugs (n = 19), paracetamol (n = 16), or benzodiazepines (n = 9). Two patients (2,6 %) died. 48 % of the patients (n = 71) were admitted because of accidental poisoning. Leading toxic agents in this group were heroin (n = 19), alcohol (n = 18) and digitalis (n = 12). 11 patients had taken herbicides, animal poisons or chemicals used at work or for house cleaning. In this cohort, three i. v. drug abusers (4,2 %) had died. Depending on the agents used, a variety of treatments (charcoal, antidots, extracorporal therapy) were undertaken.", 
    "162": "Due to excellent care in the prehospital phase and in the emergency room the number of patients requiring treatment on the intensive care unit was rather low. The mortality was in the range of other reports."
