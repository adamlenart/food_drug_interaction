Midazolam is a commonly used premedication in children but, because of its undesirable effects such as postoperative behavior changes and cognitive impairment, it is not an ideal premedicant. Dexmedetomidine, a highly specific a2-adrenergic receptor agonist, produces sedation which mimics natural stage 2 non-rapid eye movement sleep and helps in early postoperative recovery. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of sublingual dexmedetomidine in comparison to sublingual midazolam as premedicant in children", 
    "1": "This prospective, randomized, double-blind study enrolled 100 children aged 1 to 12 years belonging to ASA physical status I or II scheduled to undergo inguinal hernia repair, orchidopexy or circumcision, under general anesthesia. The children were randomly allocated into two groups of 50 each. Children in group I were premedicated with sublingual midazolam 0.25 mg/kg, while those in group II with sublingual dexmedetomidine 1.5 \u00b5g/kg. Sedation was assessed using a 6-point sedation score. Behavior at induction, wake-up behavior and mask acceptance was evaluated using a 4-point scoring system.", 
    "2": "The median sedation score at parental separation was 6 in group I as compared to 3.5 in group II (P<0.001). The behavior score at induction was comparable in both the groups. The median mask acceptance score (P<0.001) and wake-up behavior score (P=0.001) in preschool children was 2 in group I as compared to 1 in group II. However, in school-aged children both the scores were comparable.", 
    "3": "Sublingual dexmedetomidine provides more effective preoperative sedation as compared to sublingual midazolam across all the age groups and allows a smooth anesthesia induction and awakening especially in the preschool children.", 
    "4": "Zolpidem and zopiclone are two widely used non-benzodiazepine hypnotics whose usage seems to be associated to pharmacodependence. However, to our knowledge, there has as yet been no published epidemiological study which has compared their abuse or dependence potential. We used a pharmacoepidemiological approach to identify and characterise zolpidem and zopiclone users in real life situations.", 
    "5": "Regular users of zolpidem or zopiclone were identified in the database of a French regional health insurance organisation. A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify different subgroups of users of these two hypnotics.", 
    "6": "The study cohort comprised 25,168 patients who regularly used zolpidem and 21,860 who regularly used zopiclone. The results of the latent class analysis, which enables subgroups with similar patterns of response to be identified, revealed four clinical subtypes of users of zolpidem: non-problematic users, users with associations with hypnotics/anxiolytics or with associated mental disorders, and problematic users. Only three subgroups were identified for zopiclone, and LCA did not discriminate a special class of problematic users for this drug.", 
    "7": "Our analysis indicates that there is a subclass of zolpidem user suggestive of abuse; this was not the case for zopiclone. This methodology is very interesting because it allows analysis of databases and determination of a specific signature of drugs potentially leading to abuse or dependence.", 
    "8": "Previous studies indicate increased prevalences of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide in Huntington's disease (HD) compared with the general population. This study investigates correlates and predictors of suicidal ideation in HD.", 
    "9": "The study cohort consisted of 2106 HD mutation carriers, all participating in the REGISTRY study of the European Huntington's Disease Network. Of the 1937 participants without suicidal ideation at baseline, 945 had one or more follow-up measurements. Participants were assessed for suicidal ideation by the behavioural subscale of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS). Correlates of suicidal ideation were analyzed using logistic regression analysis and predictors were analyzed using Cox regression analysis.", 
    "10": "At baseline, 169 (8.0%) mutation carriers endorsed suicidal ideation. Disease duration (odds ratio [OR]=0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-1.0), anxiety (OR=2.14; 95%CI: 1.4-3.3), aggression (OR=2.41; 95%CI: 1.5-3.8), a previous suicide attempt (OR=3.95; 95%CI: 2.4-6.6), and a depressed mood (OR=13.71; 95%CI: 6.7-28.0) were independently correlated to suicidal ideation at baseline. The 4-year cumulative incidence of suicidal ideation was 9.9%. Longitudinally, the presence of a depressed mood (hazard ratio [HR]=2.05; 95%CI: 1.1-4.0) and use of benzodiazepines (HR=2.44; 95%CI: 1.2-5.0) at baseline were independent predictors of incident suicidal ideation, whereas a previous suicide attempt was not predictive.", 
    "11": "As suicidal ideation was assessed by only one item, and participants were a selection of all HD mutation carriers, the prevalence of suicidal ideation was likely underestimated.", 
    "12": "Suicidal ideation in HD frequently occurs. Assessment of suicidal ideation is a priority in mutation carriers with a depressed mood and in those using benzodiazepines.", 
    "13": "Olanzapine was the second first-line atypical antipsychotic medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult schizophrenia and later approved for adolescent schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Initial studies performed on adults demonstrated efficacy compared to placebo and a first-generation antipsychotic medication. Initial assessments in adolescents with schizophrenia demonstrated significant symptom reduction without movement disorder, but with weight gain. Later studies reported efficacy for bipolar disorder in teenagers, but with weight gain. The assessment of olanzapine safety in teenagers has shown substantial weight gain and metabolic measures. Because of equivalent efficacy to other atypical antipsychotic medications and the metabolic side-effects, olanzapine is often recommended as a second-use medication.", 
    "14": "Studies of olanzapine use in adolescents with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder demonstrate significant reduction in symptoms while causing no movement disorder side-effects. There has been reduction in use of olanzapine with adolescents as newer atypical antipsychotics have emerged associated with less weight gain.", 
    "15": "Studies of olanzapine have demonstrated effectiveness in adolescents with a psychotic illness. Metabolic side-effects are a strong concern of the field and have led to the recommendation of using the medication in a secondary fashion.", 
    "16": "Traumatic brain injuries demonstrate various symptoms, including the disturbance of higher brain function, which is not visualized as a morphological lesion on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. We examined the use of iomazenil single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for patients with traumatic brain injury and evaluated its diagnostic value. The study population included patients who were admitted to our hospital for traumatic brain injuries. All patients survived and were discharged from our hospital. MR imaging and iomazenil SPECT were examined during the acute and/or chronic phases. MR images were acquired using a 1.5-T clinical instrument. The T1- and T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) axial images were evaluated. SPECT images were acquired using a multi-detector SPECT machine 3 h after the intravenous injection of 740 MBq of iomazenil. Axial, statistically analyzed images and stereotactic extraction estimation images were reconstructed and evaluated statistically based on the Z-score for each cerebral cortex. Iomazenil SPECT showed various lesions that were not demonstrated by MR imaging. Some clinical symptoms correlated with the iomazenil SPECT findings. Iomazenil SPECT is thus considered to be valuable for evaluating both brain lesions and the brain function after traumatic brain injury.", 
    "17": "Many neurotrauma patients suffer from higher brain dysfunction even when focal brain damage is not detected with MRI. We performed functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) to clarify the relationship between the functional deficit and symptoms of such patients.",

Thirteen patients underwent PET study to image glucose metabolism by (18)F-FDG, and central benzodiazepine receptor (cBZD-R) by (11)C-flumazenil, together with measurement of cognition.", 
    "19": "Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) patients have a significant decrease in glucose metabolism and cBZD-R distribution in the cingulated cortex than normal controls. Score of cognition test was variable among patients. The degree of decreased glucose metabolism and cBZD-R in the dominant hemisphere corresponded well to the severity of cognitive disturbance. Patients with a milder type of diffuse brain injury (i.e., cerebral concussion) also showed abnormal glucose metabolism and cBZD-R distribution when they suffered from cognitive deficit.", 
    "20": "PET molecular imaging was useful for depicting the cortical dysfunction of neurotrauma patients even when morphological change was not apparent. This method may be promising in clarifying the pathophysiology of higher brain dysfunction of patients with neurotrauma, but without morphological abnormality.", 
    "21": "In patients with higher brain dysfunction (HBD) after mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI), diagnostic imaging of cortical neuron loss in the frontal lobes was studied using SPECT with (123)I-iomazenil (IMZ), as a radioligand for central benzodiazepine receptor (BZR). Statistical imaging analysis using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) for (123)I-IMZ SPECT was performed in 17 patients. In all patients with HBD defined by neuropsychological tests, cortical neuron loss was indicated in the bilateral medial frontal lobes in 14 patients (83 %). A comparison between the group of 17 patients and the normal database demonstrated common areas of cortical neuron loss in the bilateral medial frontal lobes involving the medial frontal gyrus (MFG) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). In an assessment of cortical neuron loss in the frontal medial cortex using the stereotactic extraction estimation (SEE) method (level 3), significant cortical neuron loss was observed within bilateral MFG in 9 patients and unilateral MFG in 4, and bilateral ACG in 12 and unilateral ACG in 3. Fourteen patients showed significant cortical neuron loss in bilateral MFG or ACG. In patients with MTBI, HBD seemed to correlate with selective cortical neuron loss within the bilateral MFG or ACG where the responsible lesion could be. 3D-SSP and SEE level 3 analysis for (123)I-IMZ SPECT could be valuable for diagnostic imaging of HBD after MTBI.", 
    "22": "[(123)I] iomazenil (IMZ) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has been reported to be a useful marker of neuronal integrity. We evaluated cortical damage following traumatic brain injury (TBI) with IMZ SPECT at the acute stage. After conventional therapy for a cranial trauma, an IMZ SPECT re-evaluation was performed at the chronic stage. A reduction in IMZ uptake in the location of cerebral contusions was observed during the TBI acute phase; however, images of IMZ SPECT obtained during the chronic phase showed that areas with decreased IMZ distribution were remarkably reduced compared with those obtained during the acute phase. As a result of in vivo microdialysis study, the extracellular levels of glutamate in the cortex, where decreased IMZ distribution was shown during the acute phase, were increased during the 168-h monitoring period. During the chronic phase, IMZ uptake in the region with the microdialysis probes was recovered. The results suggest that this reduction in IMZ uptake might not be a sign of irreversible tissue damage in TBI.", 
    "23": "Reproductive toxicities and endocrine disruptions caused by chemicals in adult males are still poorly understood. It is our objectives to understand further details of the initial adverse effects leading severe testicular toxicities of a pharmaceutical endocrine disruptor, diethylstilbestrol (DES). Downregulations of both testicular regulatory proteins, such as the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), which play important roles in the transport of cholesterol into the mitochondria, and cytochrome P450 mediating the cholesterol side chain cleavage reaction (P450scc), were observed in the rat orally administered DES (340\u2009\u03bcg/kg/2 days) for 2 weeks. We found that after only 1 week treatment with DES, the blood and testicular testosterone (TS) levels were drastically decreased without abnormalities of the StAR and PBR; however, the protein and mRNA levels of P450scc were diminished. Decrease in the conversion rate of cholesterol to pregnenolone was delayed in the in vitro assay using the testicular mitochondrial fraction from the rat treated with DES for 1 week. When the precursors in TS biosynthesis containing the testis were identified and determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, decreased levels of all precursors except cholesterol were observed. In conclusion, suppressed cytochrome P450scc expression in adult male rat was identified as an initial target of DES in testicular steroidogenesis disorder leading reproductive toxicities.", 
    "24": "2C designer drugs have been in use since the 1970s, but new drugs continue to develop from substitutions to the base phenethylamine structure. This creates new clinical profiles and difficulty with laboratory confirmation. 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)methyl]ethanamine (25I-NBOMe) is a relatively new 2C drug that is more potent than structural 2C analogs; exposure reports are rare. Testing for 2C drugs is developing; specific testing for new analogs such as 25I-NBOMe is a challenge. These drugs do not reliably trigger a positive result on rapid drug immunoassays. Additionally, most facilities with confirmatory testing capabilities will not identify 25I-NBOMe; methods for detecting 25I-NBOMe in biological samples have not been clearly described nor have optimal metabolic targets for detecting 25I-NBOMe ingestion.",

Urine was analyzed using quantitative LC-MS/MS methodology for 25I-NBOMe, 2-(4-chloro-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[(2-methoxyphenyl)-methyl]ethanamine (25C-NBOMe), and 2-(2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine (25H-NBOMe). 25I-NBOMe was found at a concentration of 7.5\u00a0ng/mL, and 25H-NBOMe was detected as well. Additional testing was pursued to characterize the metabolism of 25I-NBOMe; the sample was reanalyzed with UPLC-time-of-flight mass spectrometry to identify excreted metabolites. The sample was additionally analyzed for the presence of 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethylamine (2C-I), 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine (2C-B), and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylphenyl)-2-aminoethane (2C-E).",

Serial pharmacokinetic samples were collected up to 24 (midazolam) and 72 (S-warfarin) h post-dose. Plasma concentrations of midazolam, \u03b1-hydroxymidazolam and S-warfarin were measured using validated assays. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated using non-compartmental analysis, and geometric mean ratios (GMRs) and 90 % confidence intervals (CIs) for the differences between baseline and post-dosing values were calculated.", 
    "29": "Danoprevir/r and placebo/r significantly increased midazolam area under the time-concentration curve (AUC0-\u221e) and reduced the midazolam metabolic ratio while S-warfarin AUC0-\u221e was modestly decreased. When danoprevir data were pooled across doses, the midazolam GMR (90 % CI) AUC0-\u221e was 9.41 (8.11, 10.9) and 11.14 (9.42, 13.2) following danoprevir/r and placebo/r dosing, respectively, and the S-warfarin GMR (90 % CI) AUC0-\u221e was 0.72 (0.68, 0.76) and 0.76 (0.69, 0.85), respectively.

In order to ascertain their cytogenetic activity in\u00a0vitro at doses equivalent to the per os doses of common 1,4-benzodiazepine drugs, Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs) were employed, and for the determination of cytostaticity the Proliferation Rate Index (PRI) on lymphocytes of human whole blood cultures was estimated. It was found that benzodiazepines 3a, 3c, and 3e exhibit significant cytoprotection, but mild cytostatic effect (a statistically significant reduction of SCEs and a confined decrease of PRI values at similar concentrations).

The patient's initial electrocardiogram demonstrated a widened QRS of 160 ms and a normal QT/QTc interval of 400/487 ms consistent with cardiac sodium channel blockade. Within 30 min of arrival, peak citalopram and olanzapine levels were measured to be 522 ng/mL and 505 ng/mL, respectively. Measured levels remained supratherapeutic until 13.6 h and 42.6 h after arrival for citalopram and olanzapine, respectively. The patient developed bradycardia and hypotension that required multimodal therapies including sodium bicarbonate boluses, vasopressors, and transvenous pacing.

In the first study, volunteers received oral ticagrelor (400 mg daily) or placebo for 6 days, then oral midazolam (7.5 mg). The second study regimen was a single dose of ticagrelor 270 mg, then ticagrelor 180 mg BID for 6 days with a single oral (7.5 mg) or IV (2.5 mg) dose of midazolam.",

    "40": "Patients who suffer from agitated depression accompanied by psychomotor agitation and irritability are prone to suicidal ideation and attempts and must therefore be diagnosed and treated with utmost care. Clinically, there have been more than a few cases of suicidal attempts that seemed to have been provoked by careless prescription of antidepressant medication. In the present study, administration of quetiapine to 3 patients in the acute phase of agitated depression resulted in rapid improvement in irritability and alleviation of depression. Depression in these 3 patients was caused by chronic (persistent) anxiety and tension. During the acute phase, the patients evidenced psychomotor agitation and irritability, often experiencing a sudden, overwhelming urge to commit suicide. Findings from the present study suggest that treatment with quetiapine in patients with this type of agitated depression can quickly alleviate symptoms of anxiety and irritability and reduce the risk of suicide.", 
    "41": "The purpose of this study was to investigate activation of inhibitory regulation pathways by methamphetamine (METH)-withdrawal stress in rat salivary gland. Our previous study showed that METH-withdrawal stress activated steroid biosynthesis and that pregnenolone produced during the early stage of this process inhibited salivary secretion. However, how this type of stress inhibits salivary secretion and the activation pathway of steroid biosynthesis in salivary gland remain to be clarified. In the present study, using an in vivo cannulation method, METH-withdrawal stress decreased salivary secretion and increased expression of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI), an endogenous peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) agonist; Western blot and RT-PCR also showed increased expression of DBI mRNA in parotid, submandibular, and sublingual gland. In addition, METH-withdrawal stress also elicited an increase in pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and PBR mRNA, which is associated with DBI activity. These results suggest that METH-withdrawal stress activates a PACAP-DBI pathway in salivary gland, enhancing steroid genesis and inhibiting secretion.", 
    "42": "ATP-gated P2X4 purinergic receptors (P2X4Rs) are cation channels with important roles in diverse cell types. To date, lack of specific inhibitors has hampered investigations on P2X4Rs. Recently, the benzodiazepine derivative, 5-BDBD has been proposed to selectively inhibit P2X4Rs. However, limited evidences are currently available on its inhibitory properties. Thus, we aimed to characterize the inhibitory effects of 5-BDBD on recombinant human P2X4Rs.", 
    "43": "We investigated ATP-induced intracellular Ca(2+) signals and whole cell ion currents in HEK 293 cells that were either transiently or stably transfected with hP2X4Rs.", 
    "44": "Our data show that ATP (< 1 \u03bcM) stimulates P2X4R-mediated Ca(2+) influx while endogenously expressed P2Y receptors are not activated to any significant extent. Both 5-BDBD and TNP-ATP inhibit ATP-induced Ca(2+) signals and inward ion currents in a concentration-dependent manner. Application of two different concentrations of 5-BDBD causes a rightward shift in ATP dose-response curve. Since the magnitude of maximal stimulation does not change, these data suggest that 5-BDBD may competitively inhibit the P2X4Rs.", 
    "45": "Our results demonstrate that application of submicromolar ATP concentrations allows reliable assessment of recombinant P2XR functions in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, 5-BDBD and TNP-ATP have similar inhibitory potencies on the P2X4Rs although their mechanisms of actions are different.", 
    "46": "Driving with alcohol and other psychoactive substances imposes an increased risk of severe injury accidents. In a population-based case-control design, the relative risks of severe driver injury (MAIS\u22652) by driving with ten substance groups were approximated by odds ratios (alcohol, amphetamines, benzoylecgonine, cocaine, cannabis, illicit opiates, benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, i.e. zolpidem and zopiclone, medicinal opioids, alcohol-drug combinations and drug-drug combinations). Data from six countries were included in the study: Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Lithuania and the Netherlands. Case samples (N=2490) were collected from severely injured drivers of passenger cars or vans in selected hospitals in various regions of the countries. Control samples (N=15,832) were sampled in a uniform sampling scheme stratified according to country, time, road type and season. Relative risks were approximated by odds ratios and calculated by logistic regression. The estimates were adjusted for age, gender and country. The highest risk of the driver being severely injured was associated with driving positive for high concentrations of alcohol (\u22650.8 g/L), alone or in combination with other psychoactive substances. For alcohol, risk increased exponentially with blood alcohol concentration (BAC). The second most risky category contained various drug-drug combinations, amphetamines and medicinal opioids. Medium increased risk was associated with medium sized BACs (at or above 0.5 g/L, below 0.8 g/L) and benzoylecgonine. The least risky drug seemed to be cannabis and benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. For male drivers, the risk of being severely injured by driving with any of the psychoactive substances was about 65% of that of female drivers. For each of the substance groups there was a decrease in the risk of severe driver injury with increasing age. It is concluded that among psychoactive substances alcohol still poses the largest problem in terms of driver risk of getting injured.", 
    "47": "Premedication is rarely used in avian species. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of premedication on the quality of sevoflurane induction and anaesthesia in parrots. We hypothesised that premedication would facilitate handling and decrease the minimum anaesthetic dose (MAD). Thirty-six adult parrots were randomly distributed in three groups: group S (n\u2009=\u200912) was premedicated with NaCl 0.9%; group KS (n\u2009=\u200912) was premedicated with 10\u00a0mg.kg-1 ketamine; and group KDS (n\u2009=\u200912) was premedicated with 10\u00a0mg.kg-1 ketamine and 0.5\u00a0mg.kg-1 diazepam, delivered intramuscularly. After induction using 4.5% sevoflurane introduced through a facemask, the MAD was determined for each animal. The heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP), and cloacal temperature (CT) were recorded before premedication (T0), 15\u00a0minutes after premedication (T1), and after MAD determination (T2). Arterial blood gas analyses were performed at T0 and T2. The quality of anaesthesia was evaluated using subjective scales based on animal behaviour and handling during induction, maintenance, and recovery. Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis tests followed by Tukey's or Dunn's tests.",

There were no differences in HR, RR, or CT among groups, but SAP was significantly lower in group S. Sedation was observed in both the premedicated S-KS and S-KDS groups. There were no differences in the quality of intubation and recovery from anaesthesia among the three groups, although the induction time was significantly shorter in the pre-medicated groups, and the KS group showed less muscle relaxation.", 
    "49": "Ketamine alone or the ketamine/diazepam combination decreased the MAD of sevoflurane in parrots (Amazona aestiva). Ketamine alone or in combination with diazepam promoted a good quality of sedation, which improved handling and reduced the stress of the birds.

The present standard treatment has been reported to be unsatisfactory. Many novel approaches are being used and tested for acute organophosphorus (OP) poison treatment. The bioscavenger concept captured high attention among the scientific community during the last few decades. Other approaches like alkalinisation of blood plasma/serum and use of weak inhibitors against strong inhibitors, though it showed promising results, did not get such wide attention. The introduction of a novel broad-spectrum oxime has also been in focus. In this mini-review, an update of the overview of four different approaches has been discussed. The standard therapy that is atropine+oxime+benzodiazepine along with supportive measures will continue to be the best option with only the replacement of a single oxime to improve its broad-spectrum efficacy.",

A relapse was defined as increase to CGI-BP >3, worsening of CGI-BP by \u22652 points, hospitalization or death related to BD. A Cox regression was calculated for the discontinuation of mood stabilizing therapy (reference: OM). Logistic regression models with stepwise forward selection were used to explore possible predictors of maintenance of treatment and relapse.",

We hypothesized that the neurotoxicity of repeated exposure to dexmedetomidine or midazolam for neonatal mice might be different. Twenty four mice of postnatal day 8 were randomly divided into control (n=8), dexmedetomidine (n=8) and midazolam group (n=8) respectively. In the three groups, saline(10mL/kg), dexmedetomidine(10microg/kg) or midazolam(40mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally once a day, in the next five days, respectively. Then the brains of the mice in the three qroups were removed and cryosectioned. Apoptotic neural cell in hippocampus region was detected with terminal deoxynucleotydyl transferase -mediated dUTP nick end labeling(TUNEL). Bcl2 and Bax protein expression level in the hippocampus were determined by immunofluorescent staining. In the present study, the number of TUNEL-positive cells from midazolam group ((20 +/-3) /mm2) was larger than that from dexmedetomidine group ((15+/-2) /mm2, P<0. 05) and control group((13+/-3) /mm2, P<0. 05); Bcl-2 protein quantity in hippocampus from control group((790+/-103)/mm2)was significantly lower than that in midazolam group((1187+/- 162)/mm2, P<0.05)and dexmedetomidine group((890+/-125)/mm2, P<0. 05). Bax protein level in control group((942+/-104)/mm2) was also significantly lower than that in midazolam group((1839+/-160)/mm2, P<0. 05)and dexmedetomidine group((1143+/-125)/mm2, P<0. 05); Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in midazolam group(0. 64+/-0. 13) was significantly lower than that in dexmedetomidine group(0. 78 +/-0. 14, P<0. 05) and control group(0. 84+/-0. 15, P<0. 05).

    "64": "Human amniotic fluid (AF) contains eight fatty acids (FATs), and both produce anxiolytic-like effects in adult rats and appetitive responses in human newborns. The medial amygdala and lateral septal nucleus function are related to social behavior, but the action of AF or its FATs in this circuit is known. We obtained 267 single-unit extracellular recordings in Wistar rats treated with vehicle (1\u2009mL, s.c.; n = 12), human AF (1\u2009mL, s.c.; n = 12), a FAT mixture (1\u2009mL, s.c.; n = 13), diazepam (1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.; n = 11), and fluoxetine (1\u2009mg/kg, p.o.; n = 12). Compared with the vehicle group, the spontaneous septal firing rate in the AF, FAT mixture, and diazepam groups was the lowest and in the fluoxetine group the highest. Cumulative peristimulus histograms indicated that the significant change in septal firing occurred only in the AF and FAT mixture groups and exclusively in those neurons that increased their firing rate during amygdala stimulation. We conclude that human AF and its FATs produce actions comparable to anxiolytic drugs and are able to modify the responsivity of a circuit involved in social behavior, suggesting facilitation of social recognition processes by maternal-fetal fluids.", 
    "65": "NG2 cells are equipped with transmitter receptors and receive direct synaptic input from glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. The functional impact of these neuron-glia synapses is still unclear. Here, we combined functional and molecular techniques to analyze properties of GABA(A) receptors in NG2 cells of the juvenile mouse hippocampus. GABA activated slowly desensitizing responses in NG2 cells, which were mimicked by muscimol and inhibited by bicuculline. To elucidate the subunit composition of the receptors we tested its pharmacological properties. Coapplication of pentobarbital, benzodiazepines, and zolpidem all significantly increased the GABA-evoked responses. The presence of small tonic currents indicated the presence of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. To further analyze the subunit expression, single cell transcript analysis was performed subsequent to functional characterization of NG2 cells. The subunits \u03b11, \u03b12, \u03b23, \u03b31, and \u03b32 were most abundantly expressed, matching properties resulting from pharmacological characterization. Importantly, lack of the \u03b32-subunit conferred a high Zn\u00b2\u207a sensitivity to the GABA(A) receptors of NG2 cells. Judging from the zolpidem sensitivity, postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in NG2 cells contain the \u03b32-subunit, in contrast to extrasynaptic receptors, which were not modulated by zolpidem. To determine the effect of GABA(A) receptor activation on membrane potential, perforated patch recordings were obtained from NG2 cells. In the current-clamp mode, GABA depolarized the cells to approximately -30 mV, indicating a higher intracellular Cl\u207b concentration (\u223c50 mM) than previously reported. GABA-induced depolarization in NG2 cells might trigger Ca\u00b2\u207a influx through voltage-activated Ca\u00b2\u207a channels.",

Studies in major depressive disorder have demonstrated that suprathreshold, nondominant (right) hemisphere, unilateral electrode placement ECT has fewer adverse effects, especially cognitive adverse effects, than bitemporal ECT. This case series describes the use of right unilateral (RUL) ECT in 5 patients with catatonia. Before ECT, all 5 patients in this series initially failed therapy with benzodiazepines and psychotropic medications. Each catatonic patient received a series of 8 to 12 RUL ECT in an every-other-day series. After ECT, 4 of the 5 patients had a full recovery from catatonia. One patient achieved only partial response to RUL ECT, and no additional benefit was obtained with bitemporal ECT. All patients in this case series tolerated RUL ECT without major adverse effects.

Mutant MurI enzymes from these strains were characterized by structural, genetic, kinetic and biophysical methods. Both inhibitor series, pyrazolopyrimidinediones and benzodiazepines, are uncompetitive with respect to the glutamate substrate, and the resistance mutations were found to act by reducing the affinity of MurI for substrate, thereby reducing the pool of enzyme-substrate complex available for binding inhibitor, while still allowing sufficient glutamate racemase activity for peptidoglycan construction. Uncompetitive inhibitors of a single-substrate, single-product enzyme are rare, and this work gives insight into an remarkable resistance mechanism.

The mechanisms underlying these undesired side-effects are currently unknown. Chagnon et al. showed that the common allele rs7973796 of the prepro-melanin-concentrating hormone (PMCH) gene is associated with a greater body mass index in Ola-treated schizophrenic patients. As PMCH encodes for the orexigenic neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), it was hypothesized that MCH is involved in Ola-induced metabolic changes. We have recently reported that the intragastric infusion of Ola results in hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance in male rats. In order to test in vivo the possible involvement of the PMCH gene in the pathogenesis of Ola side-effects, we administered Ola intragastrically in wild-type (WT) and PMCH knock-out (KO) rats. Our results show that glucose and corticosterone levels, as well as endogenous glucose production, are elevated by the infusion of Ola in both WT and KO animals. Thus, the lack of MCH does not seem to affect the acute effects of Ola on glucose metabolism. On the other hand, these effects might be obliterated by compensatory changes in other hypothalamic systems. In addition, possible modulatory effects of the MCH KO on the long term effects of Ola, i.e. increased adiposity, body weight gain, have not been investigated yet.",

Furthermore, we tested the hypothesis that peripheral administration of a corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) receptor antagonist (astressin B) would reverse the alterations in GABAAR binding within these regions in subordinate females. After subjects received astressin B or saline for three consecutive days, GABAAR BPND was determined by positron emission tomography (PET) using (18)F-flumazenil as a radioligand. T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were also acquired for PET scan co-registration, in order to perform a region of interest analysis using the pons as a reference region. Compared to socially dominant females, subordinate females exhibited increased GABAAR BPND in the prefrontal cortex but not in the temporal lobe or the hypothalamus. Administration of astressin B eliminated the status difference in GABAAR BPND in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting that the chronic stressor of social subordination modulates GABAergic tone via effects on CRH and the LHPA axis, at least in prefrontal regions.",

Hippocampal theta frequency in urethane anaesthetized rats is suppressed by all known (and some previously unknown) anti-anxiety (anxiolytic) drugs. Although these findings support the predictive validity of this assay, its construct validity (i.e., whether theta frequency actually indexes anxiety per se) has not been a subject of systematic investigation. We reasoned that if anxiolytic drugs suppress hippocampal theta frequency, then drugs that increase anxiety (i.e., anxiogenic agents) should increase theta frequency, thus providing evidence of construct validity. We used three proven anxiogenic drugs--two benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonists, N-methyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG7142) and \u03b2-carboline-3-carboxylate ethyl ester (\u03b2CCE), and one \u03b12 noradrenergic receptor antagonist, 17\u03b1-hydroxy-yohimban-16\u03b1-carboxylic acid methyl ester (yohimbine) as pharmacological probes to assess the construct validity of the theta model. Although all three anxiogenic drugs significantly increased behavioural measures of anxiety in the elevated plus-maze, none of the three increased the frequency of hippocampal theta oscillations in the neurophysiological model. As a positive control, we demonstrated that diazepam, a proven anxiolytic drug, decreased the frequency of hippocampal theta, as in all other studies using this model. Given this discrepancy between the significant effects of anxiogenic drugs in the behavioural model and the null effects of these drugs in the neurophysiological model, we conclude that the construct validity of the hippocampal theta model of anxiety is questionable.",

Surprisingly, gelsemine effect on anxiety has until now received only little attention. Here, we used the well-validated method for anxiety assessment, the elevated plus-maze combined with video-tracking, to measure gelsemine action on rat anxiety-like behavior. Rats were intraperitoneally injected (500\u03bcl/daily/7days) with gelsemine (10(-6), 10(-10) or 10(-14)M) or control solution. Diazepam (DZP) was used as positive standard anxiolytic and additional controls were naive rats similarly manipulated except being injected. Gelsemine or diazepam treatment did not affect the number of closed arm entries and rears illustrating the rat general activity. In contrast, gelsemine (10(-6) to 10(-10)M) or DZP increased dose-dependently the number of entries and the percent of time spent in the open arms indicating that gelsemine is an anxiolytic. Consistently, we observed that gelsemine (10(-6) to 10(-10)M) or DZP also decreased dose-dependently the percent of protected stretched attend postures, an ethological index of anxiety-like state. Altogether, our results constitute a solid set of fundamental data directly demonstrating anxiolytic properties of gelsemine.

Analysis of substances that produce similar effects has been hampered by the lack of techniques to assess the localization and function of such agents in brain slices. Here we describe measurement of the sniffer patch laser uncaging response (SPLURgE), which combines the sniffer patch recording configuration with laser photolysis of caged GABA. This methodology enables the detection of allosteric GABAAR modulators endogenously present in discrete areas of the brain slice and allows for the application of exogenous GABA with spatiotemporal control without altering the release and localization of endogenous modulators within the slice. Here we demonstrate the development and use of this technique for the measurement of allosteric modulation in different areas of the thalamus. Application of this technique will be useful in determining whether a lack of modulatory effect on a particular category of neurons or receptors is due to insensitivity to allosteric modulation or a lack of local release of endogenous ligand. We also demonstrate that this technique can be used to investigate GABA diffusion and uptake. This method thus provides a biosensor assay for rapid detection of endogenous GABAAR modulators and has the potential to aid studies of allosteric modulators that exert effects on other classes of neurotransmitter receptors, such as glutamate, acetylcholine, or glycine receptors.",

Intrathecal opioids are the most frequently used; the lipophilic fentanyl and sufentanil enhance and moderately prolong the sensory block, whereas the hydrophilic morphine significantly prolongs spinal analgesia. Nausea/vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression are possible side effects. Adrenergic agonists, such as adrenaline and phenylephrine may prolong the block due to vasoconstriction, while clonidine and dexmedetomidine accelerate the onset and prolong the duration of block and analgesia. Hypotension, sedation and respiratory depression have been reported with clonidine. Other intrathecal adjuvants, such as midazolam, ketamine and neostigmine may also improve the quality of block and prolong analgesia, but are not popular because of their adverse effects. Intrathecal magnesium sulphate mainly potentiates the analgesic action of intrathecal opioids, without significant side effects. A positive impact on spinal analgesia has also been suggested \u2011 from animal studies \u2011 for intrathecal calcium channel blockers, while the analgesic efficacy of intrathecal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs remains questionable. Several drugs may also affect the spinal block characteristics after systemic administration. Opioids enhance, alpha-2 agonists and ketamine prolong the block, magnesium sulphate reduces postoperative analgesic consumption and nimodipine may delay the regression of sensory block. Nitrous oxide inhalation has also been found to enhance the level of sensory spinal block.

    "199": "It has been reported that non-subtype-selective GABAA receptor antagonists injected into the nucleus pontis oralis (PnO) of rats induced long-lasting increases in REM sleep. Characteristics of these REM sleep increases were identical to those resulting from injection of muscarinic cholinergic agonists. Both actions were blocked by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine. Microdialysis of GABAA receptor antagonists into the PnO resulted in increased acetylcholine levels. These findings were consistent with GABAA receptor antagonists disinhibiting acetylcholine release in the PnO to result in an acetylcholine-mediated REM sleep induction. Direct evidence has been lacking for localization in the PnO of the specific GABAA receptor-subtypes mediating the REM sleep effects. Here, we demonstrated a dose-related, long-lasting increase in REM sleep following injection (60 nl) in the PnO of the inverse benzodiazepine agonist, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-\u03b2-carboline (DMCM, 10(-2)M). REM sleep increases were greater and more consistently produced than with the non-selective antagonist gabazine, and both were blocked by atropine. Fluorescence immunohistochemistry and laser scanning confocal microscopy, colocalized in PnO vesicular acetylcholine transporter, a presynaptic marker of cholinergic boutons, with the \u03b32 subunit of the GABAA receptor. These data provide support for the direct action of GABA on mechanisms of acetylcholine release in the PnO. The presence of the \u03b32 subunit at this locus and the REM sleep induction by DMCM are consistent with binding of benzodiazepines by a GABAA receptor-subtype in control of REM sleep.", 
    "200": "Atypical antipsychotic (AAP) medications that have revolutionized the treatment of mental illness have become stigmatized by metabolic side effects, including obesity and diabetes. It remains controversial whether the defects are treatment induced or disease related. Although the mechanisms underlying these metabolic defects are not understood, it is assumed that the initiating pathophysiology is weight gain, secondary to centrally mediated increases in appetite. To determine if the AAPs have detrimental metabolic effects independent of weight gain or psychiatric disease, we administered olanzapine, aripiprazole, or placebo for 9 days to healthy subjects (n = 10, each group) under controlled in-patient conditions while maintaining activity levels. Prior to and after the interventions, we conducted a meal challenge and a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp to evaluate insulin sensitivity and glucose disposal. We found that olanzapine, an AAP highly associated with weight gain, causes significant elevations in postprandial insulin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), and glucagon coincident with insulin resistance compared with placebo. Aripiprazole, an AAP considered metabolically sparing, induces insulin resistance but has no effect on postprandial hormones. Importantly, the metabolic changes occur in the absence of weight gain, increases in food intake and hunger, or psychiatric disease, suggesting that AAPs exert direct effects on tissues independent of mechanisms regulating eating behavior.",

    "205": "Benzodiazepines are among the most frequently prescribed drugs due to their sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and antiepileptic properties. Considering the high consumption of benzodiazepines worldwide, there is increased potential for addiction and abuse in cases of crime, driving under the influence of drugs, suicide and drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA). For these reasons, this class of drugs and their metabolites are frequently present in both clinical and forensic cases. In a forensic toxicology laboratory, typical screening analysis for benzodiazepine involves various immunoassay screening methods. The present study investigates the cross-reactivity profiles of six benzodiazepines not included in the manufacturer's instructions (3-hydroxy-flunitrazepam, 7-amino-nitrazepam, brotizolam, delorazepam, pinazepam, \u03b1-hydroxy-midazolam) to EMIT(\u00ae) II Plus Benzodiazepine Assay. Pinazepam, delorazepam and brotizolam are the most reactive molecules, while the other ones present a very low cross-reactivity. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to confirm the concentrations of the spiked urines for immunoassay test and to make a comparison between the quantitative results of the different methods. Structure-reactivity relationships to EMIT(\u00ae) II Plus Benzodiazepine Assay were also evaluated. This paper draws attention to the problem of careless use of immunoassay tests for forensic purposes as they may provide false positive and/or negative results.", 
    "206": "Dysfunctions in the interplay among multiple neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the wide range of behavioral, emotional and cognitive symptoms displayed by major psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or major depression. The complex clinical presentation of these pathologies often needs the use of multiple pharmacological treatments, in particular (1) when monotherapy provides insufficient improvement of the core symptoms; (2) when there are concurrent additional symptoms requiring more than one class of medication and (3) in order to improve tolerability, by using two compounds below their individual dose thresholds to limit side effects. To date, the choice of drug combinations is based on empirical paradigm guided by clinical response. Nonetheless, several preclinical studies have demonstrated that drugs commonly used to treat psychiatric disorders may impact common intracellular target molecules (e.g. Akt/GSK-3 pathway, MAP kinases pathway, postsynaptic density proteins). These findings support the hypothesis that convergence at crucial steps of transductional pathways could be responsible for synergistic effects obtained in clinical practice by the co-administration of those apparently heterogeneous pharmacological compounds. Here we review the most recent evidence on the molecular crossroads in antipsychotic combined therapies with antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines, as well as with antipsychotics. We first discuss clinical clues and efficacy of such combinations. Then we focus on the pharmacodynamics and on the intracellular pathways underpinning the synergistic, or concurrent, effects of each therapeutic add-on strategy, as well as we also critically appraise how pharmacological research may provide new insights on the putative molecular mechanisms underlying major psychiatric disorders.",

We investigated further the possible involvement of the central Ox system in the metabolic side-effects of Olan by comparing the hyperglycaemic effects of an intragastric (IG) Olan infusion between animals treated intracerebroventricularly (ICV) with an Ox-1 receptor antagonist (SB-408124) or vehicle. As observed in previous studies IG Olan caused an increase in blood glucose, endogenous glucose production and plasma glucagon levels. ICV pre-treatment with the Ox-1 receptor antagonist did not affect the Olan-induced hyperglycaemia or increased plasma glucagon concentrations, but the increased endogenous glucose production was blunted by the ICV SB-408124 treatment.

All patients had a history of drug abuse, and most had psychiatric disorders as well. Treatments included benzodiazepines, mechanical ventilation, and intravenous hydration.", 
    "226": "Bath salts are available for approximately $20 (USD) in packets at truck stops and on the Internet, usually marketed with the disclaimer, \"not for human consumption.\" Their presentation mimics other sympathetic drugs and causes a significant amount of delirium, hallucinogenic-delusional symptoms, extreme agitation, combativeness, and rhabdomyolysis, often leading to hospitalizations and intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Management is largely supportive and includes aggressive intravenous hydration, dampening of the excessive sympathetic outflow with benzodiazepines, and close monitoring in the ICU setting. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recently invoked its emergency scheduling authority to control these synthetic stimulants. The DEA plans to make possessing and selling these chemicals, or products that contain them, illegal in the United States.", 
    "227": "We have previously demonstrated that riluzole has anxiolytic-like effects in rats, without affecting spontaneous alternation performance in the Y-maze test. However, the effects of riluzole on hippocampal synaptic plasticity were still unclear. In this study, we showed that bath application of riluzole did not impair long-term potentiation and long-term depression, whereas a benzodiazepine anxiolytic, diazepam, significantly impaired them. Furthermore, the acquisition of spatial memory in the Morris water maze test was impaired in diazepam-treated but not riluzole-treated rats. We thus provide further evidence for the potential usefulness of riluzole as an anxiolytic that does not cause amnesia.", 
    "228": "According to a recently published population study conducted in France, exposure to benzodiazepines may be associated with an approximately 50% increase in the risk of dementia in the elderly. However, the clinical interpretation of this finding raised some concerns. A causal link between benzodiazepine use and diagnosis of dementia may be real, but it is nevertheless possible that the increased risk might be due to other confounding factors. In this article, the main strengths and weaknesses of this study are briefly analysed, including the possibility of reverse causation. Implications for research and current practice are discussed.", 
    "229": "Solid-organ transplantations (SOT) are usually life-saving high-tech medical procedures. The transplantation itself and the intensive care unit stay could be traumatic stressors triggering posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). Our retrospective follow-up study aimed to explore preoperative risk factors of PTSS in a cohort of SOT recipients, and we investigated how PTSS are associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and life satisfaction.", 
    "230": "126 SOT recipients were enrolled in this investigation. Psychiatric examination of all SOT candidates based on the Transplant Evaluation Rating Scale was carried out before SOT, and after SOT, recipients completed the PTSS-10, the SF-36 and the FLZ.", 
    "231": "After the surgical intervention 19 (15.1%) SOT recipients had clinical significant PTSS. Preoperative risk factors for developing postoperative PTSS were: 1.) preexisting psychiatric morbidity, 2.) history of retransplantation, 3.) chronic benzodiazepine consumption, 4.) age, and 5.) type of transplantation.SOT-related PTSS were associated with maximal decrements in HRQOL and life satisfaction. The following HRQOL and life satisfaction domains were affected: Physical Functioning, Role Physical, Pain, General Health, Vitality, Social Functioning, Role Emotional, Mental Health, Occupation/Work and Character/Own Skills.", 
    "232": "SOT recipients may face a major risk of transplantation- and treatment-related PTSS and the development of impairments to HRQOL and life satisfaction.", 
    "233": "Impact of dose reduction of atypical antipsychotics on cognitive function has not been investigated in stable patients with schizophrenia. In this open-label, 28-week, randomized controlled trial, stable patients with schizophrenia treated with risperidone or olanzapine were randomly assigned to the reduction group (dose reduced by 50% in 4 weeks and then maintained) or maintenance group (dose kept constant). Assessments at baseline and week 28 included the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS). Sixty-one patients were enrolled; 2 of 31 (6.5%) and 5 of 30 (16.7%) patients prematurely withdrew from the study in the reduction and maintenance groups, respectively. While no significant differences in change in the PANSS total score were observed between the 2 groups, the reduction group showed significantly greater improvements in the RBANS and DIEPSS total scores compared with the maintenance group (mean \u00b1 SD, +7.0\u00b17.1 vs -0.1\u00b18.0, P < .001; -0.9\u00b11.7 vs +0.1\u00b11.2, P = .010, respectively). This 6-month pilot study suggests that risperidone or olanzapine dose reduction of 50% can improve cognitive function for stable patients with schizophrenia. Due to the open-label design, small sample size, and short study duration, however, there is a need to confirm the finding through double-blind, larger scale trials with longer follow-up periods. Moreover, potential risks of relapse following antipsychotic dose reduction should be thoroughly investigated in longer term studies.", 
    "234": "The frequency of severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from psychotropic drugs was investigated in hospitalised psychiatric patients in relation to their age. Specifically, the incidence of ADRs in patients up to 60 years was compared to that of patients older than 60 years.", 
    "235": "Prescription rates of psychotropic drugs and reports of severe ADRs were collected in psychiatric hospitals in Switzerland between 2001 and 2010. The data stem from the drug surveillance programme AMSP.", 
    "236": "A total of 699 patients exhibited severe ADRs: 517 out of 28,282 patients up to 60 years (1.8%); 182 out of 11,446 elderly patients (1.6%, ns). Logistic regression analyses showed a significantly negative relationship between the incidence of ADRs and patients' age in general and in particular for weight gain, extrapyramidal motor system (EPMS) symptoms, increased liver enzymes and galactorrhoea. A significantly negative relationship was observed for age and the dosages of olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, valproic acid and lamotrigine. When comparing age groups, frequency of ADRs was lower in general for antipsychotic drugs and anticonvulsants, in particular for valproic acid in the elderly. Weight gain was found to be lower in the elderly for antipsychotic drugs, in particular for olanzapine. For the group of mood-stabilising anticonvulsants (carbamazepine, lamotrigine and valproic acid) the elderly exhibited a lower incidence of reported allergic skin reactions.", 
    "237": "The results suggest that for psychiatric inpatients the incidence of common severe ADRs (e.g., weight gain or EPMS symptoms) arising from psychotropic medication decreases with the age of patients.", 
    "238": "With the widespread use of atypical or second-generation antipsychotics, switching treatment has become current practice and more complicated, as the pharmacological profiles of these agents differ substantially despite their similarity in being 'atypical'. All share the ability to block dopamine D\u2082 receptors, and most of them also block serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Apart from these common features, some atypical antipsychotics are also able to block or stimulate other dopamine or serotonin receptors, as well as histaminergic, muscarinergic or adrenergic receptors. As a result of the varying receptor affinities, in switching or discontinuing compounds several possible pitfalls have to be considered, including the occurrence of withdrawal and rebound syndromes. This article reviews the pharmacological background of functional blockade or stimulation of receptors of interest in regard to atypical antipsychotics and the implicated potential withdrawal and rebound phenomena. A MEDLINE search was carried out to identify information on withdrawal or rebound syndromes occurring after discontinuation of atypical antipsychotics. Using the resulting literature, we first discuss the theoretical background to the functional consequences of atypical antipsychotic-induced blockade or stimulation of neurotransmitter receptors and, secondly, we highlight the clinical consequences of this. We then review the available clinical literature on switching between atypical antipsychotics, with respect to the occurrence of withdrawal or rebound symptoms. Finally, we offer practical recommendations based on the reviewed findings. The systematic evaluation of withdrawal or rebound phenomena using randomized controlled trials is still understudied. Knowledge of pharmacological receptor-binding profiles may help clinicians in choosing adequate switching or discontinuation strategies for each agent. Results from large switching trials indicate that switching atypical antipsychotics can be performed in a safe manner. Treatment-emergent adverse events during or after switching are not always considered to be, at least in part, associated with the pre-switch antipsychotic. Further studies are needed to substantiate the evidence gained so far on different switching strategies. The use of concomitant medication, e.g., benzodiazepines or anticholinergic drugs, may help to minimize symptoms arising from the discontinuation or switching of antipsychotic treatment.", 
    "239": "We aimed to identify the frequency and costs of, and the disease predictors and inpatient process issues that may predispose to, 30-day readmission for an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patient.", 
    "240": "IBD patients admitted to an inpatient gastroenterology service were followed for a time-to-readmission analysis assessing factors associated with readmission within 30 days.", 
    "241": "Index admissions were more costly among those readmitted than among those not readmitted. Patients admitted with evidence of increased inflammation, infection, or obstruction or for dehydration or pain control had a higher risk of readmission. Patients treated with opioid analgesia during index admission were no less likely to be readmitted, and there was a 2.2-fold increase in readmissions when patients were discharged with no opioid analgesia. Scheduling variability and outpatient follow-up compliance were associated with readmission.", 
    "242": "Predicting readmission is complex. A predictive model developed to be used at discharge yielded an area under the curve of 0.757.", 
    "243": "Overdose deaths have increased steadily over the past decade. This report describes drug-related deaths and emergency department (ED) visits among women.", 
    "244": "CDC analyzed rates of fatal drug overdoses and drug misuse- or abuse-related ED visits among women using data from the National Vital Statistics System (1999-2010) and the Drug Abuse Warning Network (2004-2010).", 
    "245": "In 2010, a total of 15,323 deaths among women were attributed to drug overdose, a rate of 9.8 per 100,000 population. Deaths from opioid pain relievers (OPRs) increased fivefold between 1999 and 2010 for women; OPR deaths among men increased 3.6 times. In 2010, there were 943,365 ED visits by women for drug misuse or abuse. The highest ED visit rates were for cocaine or heroin (147.2 per 100,000 population), benzodiazepines (134.6), and OPR (129.6). ED visits related to misuse or abuse of OPR among women more than doubled between 2004 and 2010.", 
    "246": "Although more men die from drug overdoses than women, the percentage increase in deaths since 1999 is greater among women. More women have died each year from drug overdoses than from motor vehicle-related injuries since 2007. Deaths and ED visits related to OPR continue to increase among women. The prominent involvement of psychotherapeutic drugs, such as benzodiazepines, among overdoses provides insight for prevention opportunities.", 
    "247": "Health-care providers should follow guidelines for responsible prescribing, including screening and monitoring for substance abuse and mental health problems, when prescribing OPR. Health-care providers who treat women for pain should use their state's prescription drug monitoring program and regularly screen patients for psychological disorders and use of psychotherapeutic drugs, with or without a prescription.", 
    "248": "Evaluating the effects of novel drugs on appropriate tumor models has become crucial for developing more effective therapies that target highly tumorigenic and drug-resistant cancer stem cell (CSC) populations. In this study, we demonstrate that a subset of cancer cells with CSC properties may be enriched into tumor spheroids under stem cell conditions from a non-small cell lung cancer cell line. Treating these CSC-like cells with gemcitabine alone and a combination of gemcitabine and the novel CHK1 inhibitor PF-00477736 revealed that PF-00477736 enhances the anti-proliferative effect of gemcitabine against both the parental and the CSC-like cell populations. However, the CSC-like cells exhibited resistance to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Collectively, the spheroid-forming CSC-like cells may serve as a model system for understanding the mechanism underlying the drug resistance of CSCs and for guiding the development of better therapies that can inhibit tumor growth and eradicate CSCs.", 
    "249": "Conditioned fear is extinguished if a conditioned animal receives the conditioned stimulus without an unconditioned stimulus. The extinguished fear response can be reinstated after the animal experiences a mild unconditioned stimulus. Although extensive studies on the neuronal circuitry and neurochemical mechanisms leading to fear acquisition and extinction have been carried out, few studies have focused on reinstatement. In this study, we investigated the effects of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, protein synthesis inhibitors, cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) antagonists, and benzodiazepine on reinstatement of conditioned fear in mice. An intraperitoneal injection of the NMDAR antagonist MK-801 or the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin before the reminder shock attenuated fear reinstatement tested the next day. However, anisomycin had no effect on fear reinstatement tested 2 h after the reminder shock. CB1R antagonists, SR141716, and a benzodiazepine, diazepam, had no effect on fear reinstatement. These results suggested that NMDAR and protein synthesis-dependent plasticity contributed toward the reinstatement of conditioned fear and that protein synthesis was involved in consolidation of reinstated fear.",

    "251": "Remimazolam is a rapidly metabolized benzodiazepine. Early clinical trials confirm more rapid recovery compared with midazolam. Etomidate analogues can be designed with rapid metabolism and without adrenocortical suppression, but research is only at the preclinical stage. MR04A3 and AZD3043 are gamma-aminobutyric acid A agonists with phase I data, but the outlook for further development is uncertain. Pioneers of intravenous emulsions of volatile anesthetics continue their work.",

ED was assessed using the five-item International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Prescription medications, captured using a combination of drug inventory and self-report with a prompt by indication, included in this analysis comprised AHT, psychoactive medication, and pain and anti-inflammatory medication. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of the association of medication use with ED and to adjust for potential confounders including age, comorbid conditions and sociodemographic and lifestyle factors.",

The use of AHT, whether in monotherapy or in conjunction with other AHTs, and pain or anti-inflammatory medications were not associated with ED after accounting for confounding factors.", 
    "256": "Results of the BACH survey suggest adverse effects of some psychoactive medications (benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants). No evidence of an association of AHT or pain and anti-inflammatory medication with ED was observed.", 
    "257": "Inappropriate medication use among the aged review of the criteria Several criteria have been developed to assess inappropriate prescribing among individuals aged > or = 65 years. The criteria are classified as explicit (criterion-based) or implicit (judgment-based) and most of them have been validated using consensus methods. The criteria are based on risk-benefit definition of appropriateness; benzodiazepines and anticholinergics being the most often listed inappropriate medications. Many criteria also list inappropriate medication use due to drug-disease or drug-syndrome interactions. Avoiding unnecessary duplication is mentioned in the newest criteria. Fimea's database of medication for the elderly has been developed to support rational geriatric pharmacotherapy in Finnish healthcare. In addition to Fimea's database national evidence-based Current Care Guidelines on geriatric pharmacotherapy are needed."
