    "0": "Although functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography are useful in the clinical evaluation of intractable epilepsy, these techniques have not been widely applied to understanding the basic mechanisms of the epilepsies. Among patients with infantile spasms, PET studies with 2-deoxy-2[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) suggest that the spasms are the result of secondary generalization from cortical foci and that maturational factors result in the recruitment of basal ganglia and brainstem serotonin mechanisms that lead to secondary generalization and the unique semiology of the spasms. Attempts to develop an animal model of infantile spasms have not been successful. Glucose utilization studies in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome also indicate cortical lesions and further suggest that the electroencephalographic pattern of 1 to 2.5 Hz spike-wave activity (slow spike-wave pattern) is an interictal phenomenon. There is a remarkable consistency between 14C-2-deoxyglucose autoradiographic findings and PET observations of glucose utilization performed for patients in the ictal, interictal, and postictal states. Although three patterns of ictal glucose hypermetabolism have been described, hypermetabolism also can be seen in the postictal and interictal clinical states and in various animal models. Preliminary studies of benzodiazepine receptor binding with PET have found that the cortical epileptic region of decreased binding is smaller than the region of hypometabolism on glucose utilization studies, but detailed electrophysiologic comparisons have not been made. Development of new PET methods for the study of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurotransmitter functions will offer unique opportunities in the study of epileptic mechanisms.", 
    "1": "Synthetic routes have been investigated to prepare a novel C8-epoxide-functionalized pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine 6 as a potential sequence-selective DNA cross-linking agent (Wilson et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 6333-6336). A successful synthesis was accomplished via a 10-step route involving a pro-N10-Fmoc cleavage method that should have general applicability to other pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) molecules containing acid- or nucleophile-sensitive groups. During the course of this work, a one-pot reductive cyclization procedure for the synthesis of PBD N10-C11 imines from nitro dimethyl acetals was also discovered, although this method results in C11a racemization which can reduce DNA binding affinity and cytotoxicity. The target epoxide 6 was shown by thermal denaturation studies to have a significantly higher DNA-binding affinity than the parent DC-81 (3) or the C8-propenoxy-PBD (15), which is structurally similar but lacks the epoxide moiety. The time course of effects upon thermal denaturation indicated a rapid initial binding phase followed by a slower phase consistent with the stepwise cross-linking of DNA observed for a difunctional agent. This was confirmed by an electrophoretic assay which demonstrated efficient induction of interstrand cross-links in plasmid DNA at concentrations >1 microM. Higher levels of interstrand cross-linking were observed at 24 h compared to 6 h incubation. A Taq polymerase stop assay indicated a preference for binding to guanine-rich sequences as predicted for bis-alkylation in the minor groove of DNA by epoxide and imine moieties. The pattern of stop sites could be partly rationalized by molecular modeling studies which suggested low-energy models to account for the observed binding behavior. The epoxide PBD 6 was shown to have significant cytotoxicity (45-60 nM) in the A2780, CH1, and CH1cis(R) human ovarian carcinoma cell lines and an IC(50) of 0.2 microM in A2780cis(R). The significant activity of 6 in the cisplatin-resistant CH1cis(R) cell line (IC(50) = 47 nM) gave a resistance factor of 0.8 compared to the parent cell line, demonstrating no cross-resistance with the major groove cross-linking agent cisplatin.", 
    "2": "ESTs constitute rapid and informative tools with which to study gene-expression profiles of the diverse stages of the schistosome life cycle. Following a comprehensive EST study of adult worms, analysis has now targeted the cercaria, the parasite larval form responsible for infection of the vertebrate host. Two Schistosoma mansoni cercarial cDNA libraries were examined and partial sequence obtained from 957 randomly selected clones. On the basis of database searches, 551 (57.6%) ESTs generated had no homologs in the public databases whilst 308 (32.2%) were putatively identified, totaling 859 informative ESTs. The remaining 98 (10.2%) were uninformative ESTs (ribosomal RNA and non-coding mitochondrial sequences). By clustering analysis we have identified 453 different genes. The most common sequences in both libraries represented Sm8 calcium binding protein (8% of ESTs), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, ATP guanidine kinase and triose phosphate isomerase. One hundred and nineteen identified genes were sorted into 11 functional categories, with genes associated with energy metabolism being the most abundant (13%) and diverse. The diversity and abundance of genes associated with the transcription/translation machinery and with regulatory/signaling functions were also marked. A paramyosin transcript was identified, indicating that this gene is not exclusively expressed in adult worms and sporocysts (as had been suggested previously). The possible physiological relevance to cercariae of the presence of transcripts with homology to calcium binding proteins of the EF-hand superfamily, Gq-coupled rhodopsin photoreceptor, rod phosphodiesterase 8 subunit and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor is discussed.", 
    "3": "The influence of lead (10 mg/kg) and ethanol (10% v/v, in drinking water) administration, either alone or in combination for 8 weeks was investigated on the uptake of lead in tissues, dopamine, benzodiazepine and cholinergic (muscarinic) receptors, motor activity, number of fighting episodes and several selected lead-sensitive biochemical indices in young rats. Lead or ethanol treatment did not elicit any appreciable influence on body weight gain, tissue weight, and food intake. However, a decreased amount of mean water intake was noticed in animals ingesting ethanol plus lead. Both lead and ethanol when administered individually exacerbate the decrease of blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) activity while lead and ethanol administered together exhibited a pronounced inhibition of ALAD activity. A significant increase in hepatic GSH levels, hepatic and brain MDA levels was also observed in animals co-exposed to lead and ethanol compared to lead alone treated rats. Simultaneous exposure to lead and ethanol also resulted in a significantly more pronounced decrease in binding of [3H]fluintrazepam in membranes prepared from the fronto-cortical region compared to the corresponding controls. The binding of [3H]spiroperidol to striatal and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) to cerebellar membranes remained unaltered in all the exposed animals. Spontaneous locomotor activity and aggressive behaviour increased significantly in the group treated with both lead and ethanol compared to the control group. The lead concentrations in blood, liver, kidney and brain were significantly higher in rats exposed simultaneously to lead and ethanol compared to lead alone exposed group. The results indicate more pronounced neurotoxic and neurobehavioural changes in animals co-exposed to lead and ethanol; however, the exact mechanism or site of its action is still not clear.", 
    "4": "We have demonstrated that continuous administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-Ag) decreases the expression of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and increases the rate of DNA degradation in a time-dependent manner in the corpora lutea of pregnant rats. In the present study, we show in situ the GnRH-Ag-induced DNA fragmentation and correlate the increase of the rate of DNA degradation with the decrease in mitochondrial PBR ligand binding (r = 0.89). The GnRH-Ag-induced decrease in the 18-kDa PBR protein also correlated with the reduction in the Bcl-X(L), but not Bcl-2 (cell survival), gene product levels and the increase in the Bax (cell death) gene product expression in the luteal mitochondrial preparations. Considering the function of PBR in cholesterol uptake and intramitochondrial movement, we propose that decreased PBR expression may lead to reduced levels of mitochondrial membrane cholesterol, which, together with the ability of Bcl-X(L) and Bax to form ion channels, produces breaks in the outer membranes allowing the exit of cytochrome c, thus triggering apoptosis. Alternatively, PBR may exert an as yet unidentified anti-apoptotic function.", 
    "5": "The administration of conscious sedation by the plastic surgeon must be safe, efficient, and consistent. In the proper setting, with trained staff and appropriate backup, conscious sedation can allow optimal patient satisfaction with expedient recovery in addition to cost containment. The highly effective local anesthesia afforded by dilute, high-volume (\"tumescent\") infiltration extends the use of conscious sedation to cases previously performed under general anesthesia or deep sedation. The purpose of this analysis was to identify variables in conscious sedation that affect traditional outcome parameters in ambulatory surgery, particularly the duration of recovery and adverse events such as nausea and emesis. All perioperative and operative records of 300 consecutive patients having plastic surgical procedures under conscious sedation were carefully reviewed. Patients were ASA class I or II by requisite. Conscious sedation followed a standardized administration protocol, using incremental doses of two agents: midazolam (0.25 to 1 mg) and fentanyl (12.5 to 50 mcg). A subset of patients received preoperative oral sedation. Multivariate statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 8.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill.). Of the 300 patients, same-day discharge was intended for 281. Eight procedure categories were defined. No anesthetic complications occurred. As expected, recovery time was significantly correlated with the duration and type of procedure (p < 0.001) and the total dosage of both intraoperative sedative agents (p < 0.001). Interestingly, a negative correlation with advancing age existed (p < 0.001), likely reflecting the significantly higher intraoperative sedative dosing in younger patients (p < 0.001). When controlled for the effects of procedure duration and intraoperative sedative dosing, two other variables-use of preoperative oral sedation and postoperative nausea/emesis-significantly lengthened recovery time (p = 0.0001 for each). Fifteen unintended admissions occurred secondary to nausea, prolonged drowsiness, or pain control needs. Conscious sedation is an effective anesthetic choice for routine plastic surgical procedures, many of which would commonly be performed under general anesthesia. In our experience with a carefully structured and controlled conscious sedation protocol, the technique has proven to be safe and effective. This analysis of outcome parameters identified two important and potentially avoidable causes of recovery delay following conscious sedation-oral premedication and nausea/emesis. Nausea and emesis were particularly problematic in that they were responsible for 11 of 15 (73 percent) unintended admissions. Preoperative sedation is valuable in certain circumstances, and its use is not discouraged; however, its benefits must be weighed against its unwanted effects, which can include a prolongation of recovery.", 
    "6": "Sensitization is the general increase of responsiveness observed after aversive stimulation. Usually footshocks are used as aversive stimuli. According to the 'Dual Process Theory' by Groves and Thompson. Psychol. Rev. 1970;77:419-450, not only additional aversive stimuli but also the response-eliciting stimuli themselves have a sensitizing effect, the degree of sensitization depending upon the stimulus intensity. We tested this suggestion in the footshock sensitization paradigm of the acoustic startle response (ASR): (1) High SPL (sound pressure level) acoustic stimuli (119 dB SPL) presented instead of footshocks also elicited strong sensitization. (2) While footshocks presented after startle stimuli with low SPL (95 dB) were able to produce a strong further sensitization of the ASR, footshocks presented after startle stimuli with high SPL (110 dB) only caused a minor sensitization of the ASR. (3) Diazepam (3 mg/kg i.p.) decreased ASR to high SPL (115 dB) stimuli. In this case footshocks elicited significant sensitization of the ASR despite intense startle stimuli. The present results support the 'Dual Process Theory'. Furthermore we could show that acoustic and footshock sensitization interact. We therefore suggest that both, acoustic and footshock sensitization, are mediated partly via the same neural circuitry.", 
    "7": "Recent studies have shown that a brief 'pre-conditioning' ischaemic insult reduces the hippocampal cell death caused by a subsequent more severe test insult. In the present studies, we have examined the effects of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ((5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine, MK-801) a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, LY202157, AMPA receptor antagonist ((3S,4aR,6R,8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)]decahydroiso quinoline-3-carboxylic acid, LY293558), a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist ((-)-1-(4-amino-phenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-4,5-dihydro-3-acetyl -2,3-benzodiazepine, LY300164), and a mixed NMDA/AMPA receptor antagonist, LY246492, in a gerbil model of ischaemic tolerance. Ischaemic tolerance was induced by subjecting gerbils to a 2-min 'pre-conditioning' ischaemia (bilateral carotid occlusion) 2 days prior to a 3-min test ischaemia. The effects of MK-801 (2 mg/kg i.p.), LY293558 (20 mg/kg i.p., followed by 4 x 10 mg/kg at 3 h intervals), LY300164 (4 x 10 mg/kg i.p. at 1 h intervals), LY246492 (40 mg/kg i.p., followed by 4 x 20 mg/kg i.p. at 3 h intervals) and LY202157 (30 mg/kg i.p., followed by 4 x 15 mg/kg i.p. at 2 h intervals) were then examined in this model. Initial dosing commenced 30 min prior to the 2-min 'pre-conditioning' ischaemia. Results indicated that a 2-min 'pre-conditioning' ischaemia produced ischaemic tolerance in all cases. The non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, produced a significant (P < 0.01) reduction in the induced tolerance, while the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, LY202157, also attenuated (P < 0.05) the induction of tolerance. In contrast, two AMPA receptor antagonists (LY293558 and LY300164) and a mixed NMDA/AMPA receptor antagonist (LY246492) had no effect on the induction of tolerance. These results suggest that NMDA receptor activation, but not AMPA receptor activation is involved in the phenomenon of ischaemic tolerance.", 
    "8": "LY 300164 [7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxolo(4, 5H)-2,3-benzodiazepine], an antagonist of AMPA/kainate receptors, at 5 mg/kg exerted a significant anticonvulsant effect, as regards seizure and afterdischarge durations in amygdala-kindled seizures in rats. At lower doses, LY 300164 did not exert anticonvulsant activity. Clonazepam alone (0.003-0.1 mg/kg) significantly diminished seizure severity, seizure and afterdischarge durations. Coadministration of LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) with clonazepam (0.001 mg/kg) resulted in the significant anticonvulsant activity. Seizure severity score, seizure and afterdischarge durations were reduced from 5 to 4, from 32.6 s to 12.3 s, and 42.7 s to 23.2 s. LY 300164 (2 mg/kg), clonazepam (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and the combination of clonazepam (0.001 mg/kg) with LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) did not affect long-term memory evaluated in the passive avoidance task in rats. LY 300164 (at the subprotective dose of 2 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the anticonvulsant action of clonazepam against maximal electroshock but not against pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in mice. The results indicate that blockade of glutamate-mediated events at AMPA/kainate receptors may differently affect the protection offered by clonazepam, which seems dependent upon the model of experimental seizures.", 
    "9": "Compared to young adults, elderly individuals with schizophrenia may have a six-fold increase in the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia. The atypical antipsychotic, olanzapine, may offer particular benefit for this population. This is a prospective, open-label trial of olanzapine therapy in elderly schizophrenic patients. Individuals aged 65 years or older with DSM-IV schizophrenia and a history of neuroleptic responsiveness were given olanzapine as an add-on therapy to their existing medication regimen. Other antipsychotic medication was gradually discontinued. Psychopathology was assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Abnormal movements were assessed with the Simpson-Angus Neurological Rating Scale (SA), the Barnes Akathisia Scale (BA), and the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). Cognitive status was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE). Twenty-seven individuals received a mean dosage of 8.4 (+/- 4.2) mg/day. Mean age of the group was 70.6 (+/- 4.1) with a range of 65 to 80 years. Patients had a mean of 1.6 (+/- 1.4) significant comorbid medical illnesses. Change in BPRS scores were not significant for the group as a whole, whereas SA score change was substantial, with a pre-treatment mean of 13.7 (+/- 10.3), compared with a mean of 4.8 (+/- 4.1) for those treated with olanzapine (p < .0002). Changes in AIMS and BA score were also significant on olanzapine therapy. MMSE score change was not statistically significant. Comorbid medical illnesses were not adversely affected. Olanzapine is an effective antipsychotic medication in older adults with schizophrenia, and is associated with significant improvement in extrapyramidal side effects. Implications for effect on cognitive status should be explored in larger, long-term trials.", 
    "10": "Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) is commonly used in psychiatric research to statistically adjust for illness severity when making group comparisons. A fundamental assumption of the procedure is that the groups' differences in outcome are constant across all levels of baseline severity. This is the classic assumption of equal linear slopes. The plausibility of this assumption is rarely reported in manuscripts that use an ANCOVA. A statistical model is discussed that can be used to test the assumption, and if the assumption is not fulfilled, the model can incorporate a covariate by group interaction. An application of this model, the multiple linear regression approach to analysis of covariance, is provided using data from a large clinical trial for patients with panic disorder. The authors recommend that manuscripts reporting results from an ANCOVA also report the results of the test of the covariate by group interaction and account for the interaction when the slopes are heterogeneous.", 
    "11": "The structural-functional foundations of the heterogeneity of GABA(A)-receptors are discussed. The heterogeneity of the receptors was revealed by clone-formation methods. The existence of 5 classes of subunits (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, rho) was proved, each of them possessing isoforms (alpha 1-6, beta 1-4, gamma 1-4, delta, rho 1-2). Studies with expression of receptors showed the efficacy of neuroactive drugs of various groups (agonists, antagonists, reversible agonists of benzodiazepine receptors, barbiturates) to be dependent on the subunit composition of the complexes. Because of this, study of the properties of various recombinant receptors is very important for the advancement of neurobiology, neuropathology, neurochemistry, toxicology, and pharmacology.",

Mepivacaine, an amide local anesthetic, has been used for spinal anesthesia and considered one of the best for spinal anesthesia for its low incidence of TNS. However, we suggest that TNS associated with mepivacaine might not be a rare complication in spinal anesthesia.",

De novo absence status and benzodiazepine withdrawal should be considered when a catatonic syndrome suddenly occurs in elderly patients.", 
    "14": "In this randomized, double-blinded study, we compared the onset and recovery characteristics of an investigational benzodiazepine, Ro 48-6791 (when administered alone or combined with meperidine), a midazolam-meperidine combination for sedation during gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures. Ninety consenting outpatients scheduled for upper or lower GI procedures were randomly assigned as follows: Group I received midazolam 1 mg IV and meperidine 50 mg; Group II received Ro 48-6791 0.5 mg IV and meperidine 50 mg; or Group III received Ro 48-6791 1.0 mg IV alone. If the level of sedation did not achieve an Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S) score of 4 (where 5 = awake/alert to 1 = asleep) in < or = 2 min, a second bolus dose, equal to half of the original dose of midazolam or Ro 48-6791, was administered. The onset time was defined as the time to achieve an OAA/S score of 4. During the procedure, a bolus dose equal to half of the total induction dose was given to maintain an OAA/S score of 4. The induction and maintenance dosages, as well as recovery times to an OAA/S score of 5, were recorded. A heel-toe line walk (HTLW) test used to determine the time to \"fitness for discharge.\" Although the onset times were similar in all three groups, the induction dosages were significantly reduced in Group II compared with Groups I and III. There were significantly more patients requiring supplemental sedative boluses and \"rescue\" analgesia with Ro 48-6791 than with midazolam. The Ro 48-6791 groups also experienced more dizziness after the procedures. Ro 48-6791 was associated with a higher incidence of inadequate sedation (18% vs 3%) without the opioid. The time for the HTLW test to return to baseline values after the procedure was similar among the three groups. However, the Ro 48-6791 groups had significantly reduced times to return to an OAA/S score of 5 and to achieve the baseline HTLW value after the last dose of the benzodiazepine. In conclusion, compared with midazolam, Ro 48-6791 is more potent and may be associated with a more rapid early recovery after endoscopic GI procedures. However, sedation with Ro 48-6791 required more supplemental bolus doses and \"rescue\" analgesic medication and was associated with a higher incidence of dizziness.", 
    "15": "The investigational water-soluble benzodiazepine, Ro 48-6791, is a more potent sedative than midazolam, which appears to have a slightly shorter duration of action. Unfortunately, use of Ro 48-6791 increased the requirement for supplemental doses of the sedative medication and the need for \"rescue\" analgesics during the procedure and was associated with more dizziness after the procedure.", 
    "16": "The objective of the present study was to assess the behavioural effects of rolipram, a specific cAMP phosphodiesterase (PDE4) inhibitor, in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test in rats. Results showed that rolipram at the highest dose tested (0.1 mg/kg) increased the percentage of both time spent and entries into open arms, although a decrease of locomotor activity in the EPM test was also observed. In contrast, diazepam (3.0 mg/kg) exhibited the typical profile of an anxiolytic in the EPM test, increasing the percentage of time spent and entries into open arms as well as locomotor activity. A posterior statistical analysis, however, established that the effects of both rolipram and diazepam on parameters denoting anxiolytic-like activity were statistically independent from those reflecting locomotor activity reduction. Furthermore, the effects of both rolipram and diazepam were shown to be distinct from those exhibited by tricyclic antidepressant imipramine which did not show any anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM test, although a reduction of locomotor activity was also detected. Although these preliminary results suggest that rolipram may have some anxiolytic-like properties on the EPM test in rats, such an interpretation should be taken cautiously due to the observed effects on locomotor activity, which could complicate the interpretation of results from rolipram and other PDE4 inhibitors in the current test and in other anxiety animal models.", 
    "17": "It has been shown previously that the amplitude of the acoustic startle reflex is enhanced, and the amplitude of the light reflex reduced, when subjects anticipate an aversive event, compared to periods when subjects are resting ('fear-potentiated startle reflex' and 'fear-inhibited light reflex'). We examined whether the anxiolytic diazepam would reverse the effects of threat on the startle and pupillary reflexes. Twelve male volunteers participated in three weekly sessions in which they received oral treatment with placebo, diazepam 5 mg and diazepam 10 mg, according to a balanced crossover double-blind design. One hour after ingestion of the treatments, miotic responses to light pulses and electromyographic responses of the orbicularis oculi muscle to sound pulses were elicited during alternating periods in which the threat of an electric shock (electrodes attached to the subject's wrist) was present (THREAT) and absent (SAFE). The THREAT condition was associated with a significant increase in the amplitude of the electromyographic (EMG) response, a significant reduction of the miotic response amplitude, and an increase in self-rated anxiety. Diazepam attenuated all these effects of THREAT. Diazepam did not affect the amplitude of the miotic response under the SAFE condition, but did suppress the EMG response under this condition. These results confirm the validity of the fear-potentiated startle reflex and fear-inhibited light reflex as laboratory models of human anxiety, and reveal some differences between the effects of diazepam on the two reflexes.", 
    "18": "Brain uptake of 123I-iomazenil was studied in seven cirrhotic patients and eight normal controls using single photon emission computerized tomography. The highest concentration of the ligand was found in the occipital cortex, which corresponds to the brain region with the highest concentration of benzodiazepine receptors. The peak uptake was delayed in patients across all brain regions. The uptake in occipital cortex was higher in low albumin cirrhotics. Patients with low albumin also presented a more delayed peak uptake in occipital cortex and a higher volume of distribution of iomazenil in plasma, compared to patients with normal albumin levels and controls. The changes in brain uptake (delayed peak uptake and increased maximal uptake in occipital cortex) appears to reflect changes in the pharmacokinetics of the ligand, particularly in cirrhotics with low levels of plasma albumin. The curve of brain uptake of the tracer was modelled into a two compartments equation, which seems to provide a practical and reliable method to calculate the slopes of acquisition and decay, time to peak and maximal acquisition.", 
    "19": "Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated region-specific effects for chronic alprazolam on binding and function at the GABA(A) receptor. The present study evaluated regional changes in mRNA expression of several subunits of the GABA(A) receptor following chronic alprazolam administration that might underlie these effects. Mice received alprazolam (2 mg/kg/day) or vehicle via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps for 1, 7, 14 or 28 days. In situ hybridization histochemistry was performed on tissue sections using [35S]dATP oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the alpha1 and gamma2 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor. Specific hybridization was clearly demonstrated and alpha1 subunit mRNA expression in frontoparietal cortex (layers II-IV) on day 1 of infusion was reduced in animals receiving alprazolam compared to vehicle. On subsequent days, there were no alterations in the levels of alpha1 subunit mRNA in the frontoparietal cortex, hippocampus or dentate gyrus. Expression of gamma2 subunit mRNA was increased on day 1 in the frontoparietal cortex (layer VI), hippocampus and dentate gyrus. mRNA expression was also increased in the dentate gyrus on day 28 of infusion. Comparison of the present study with the results of chronic treatment with other benzodiazepines clearly demonstrates that the pattern of mRNA subunit alterations obtained is both treatment- and region-specific. This makes a definitive conclusion regarding benzodiazepines and their interactions with GABA(A) receptors difficult at best.",

    "25": "Multicentre trials in patients with schizophrenia confirm that olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic agent with broad efficacy, eliciting a response in both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Compared with traditional antipsychotic agents, olanzapine causes a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms and minimal perturbation of prolactin levels. Generally, olanzapine is well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of olanzapine are linear and dose-proportional within the approved dosage range. Its mean half-life in healthy individuals was 33 hours, ranging from 21 to 54 hours. The mean apparent plasma clearance was 26 L/h, ranging from 12 to 47 L/h. Smokers and men have a higher clearance of olanzapine than women and nonsmokers. After administering [14C]olanzapine, approximately 60% of the radioactivity was excreted in urine and 30% in faeces. Olanzapine is predominantly bound to albumin (90%) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (77%). Olanzapine is metabolised to its 10- and 4'-N-glucuronides, 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine [cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2] and olanzapine N-oxide (flavin mono-oxygenase 3). Metabolism to 2-hydroxymethylolanzapine via CYP2D6 is a minor pathway. The 10-N-glucuronide is the most abundant metabolite, but formation of 4'-N-desmethylolanzapine is correlated with the clearance of olanzapine. Olanzapine does not inhibit CYP isozymes. No clinically significant metabolic interactions were found between olanzapine and diazepam, alcohol (ethanol), imipramine, R/S-warfarin, aminophylline, biperiden, lithium or fluoxetine. Fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2, increases plasma concentrations of olanzapine; inducers of CYP1A2, including tobacco smoke and carbamazepine, decrease olanzapine concentrations. Orthostatic changes were observed when olanzapine and diazepam or alcohol were coadministered. Pharmacodynamic interactions occurred between olanzapine and alcohol, and olanzapine and imipramine, implying that patients should avoid operating hazardous equipment or driving an automobile while experiencing the short term effects of the combinations. Individual factors with the largest impact on olanzapine pharmacokinetics are gender and smoking status. The plasma clearance of olanzapine generally varies over a 4-fold range, but the variability in the clearance and concentration of olanzapine does not appear to be associated with the severity or duration of adverse effects or the degree of efficacy. Thus, dosage adjustments appear unnecessary for these individual factors. However, dosage modification should be considered for patients characterised by a combination of factors associated with decreased oxidative metabolism, for example, debilitated or elderly women who are nonsmokers.",

The erythromycin breath test (ERBT) is an established approach that has proven useful in this regard, but it has several limitations. More recently, the hydroxylation of midazolam has been suggested as an alternative in vivo probe approach, because it is possible to estimate CYP3A activity in the intestinal epithelium as well as in the liver. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship, if any, between the ERBT and midazolam's CYP3A-mediated metabolism.",

An ERBT value was determined 60 minutes after administration, and clearances were estimated after midazolam administration. In addition, an endogenous 0- to 4-hour urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol ratio was measured.", 
    "28": "All three measured drug trait values varied approximately threefold to fivefold, whereas the endogenous phenotype measure exhibited far greater variability (>100-fold). No statistically significant (P < .05) correlations existed between any of the trait values, including the ERBT value, obtained after intravenous administration of the radiolabeled probe and the systemic clearance of midazolam, expressed in terms of either total or unbound drug, or on an absolute or a body weight-corrected basis (r = 0.03 to r = 0.24; P = .08 to P = .90). Substratification according to sex generally did not improve such relationships.", 
    "29": "Although both erythromycin N-demethylation and the metabolism of midazolam by hydroxylation are mediated by CYP3A, the phenotypic trait measures associated with these two in vivo probe drugs do not provide the same information about the catalytic activity of the enzyme. An indirect measure such as the ERBT may reflect CYP3A activity and be useful for some purposes, but the estimation of the oral and intravenous clearance of midazolam has additional advantages, and they may be more applicable and have broader usefulness as quantitative estimates of CYP3A activity.", 
    "30": "The efficacy of psychotropic drugs varies depending on the time of administration. This phenomenon is observed with antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and psychostimulants. The presence or absence of this phenomenon and the rhythm phase in the efficacy of each drug varies depending on the drug, dose, parameter measured, animal species, and strain. A recent study demonstrating circannual changes in the phases of circadian rhythm of drug efficacy suggests that discrepancies between studies may be considerably explained by the presence of a circannual rhythm. The rhythms in drug effects are suggested not to be due to rhythmic changes in the pharmacokinetics of the drugs but rather to an endogenous rhythm in drug susceptibility resulting from a circadian rhythm in the intracerebral neurotransmission system. The presence of this phenomenon and its law have been demonstrated to a considerable extent in animals, but corresponding clinical reports in humans remain insufficient despite its clinical importance. Further study in humans is certainly warranted.", 
    "31": "Kindling, an animal model of complex partial seizures with secondary generalization, is performed by daily application of low-intensity electrical brain stimulation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of muscarinic M1 receptors on amygdala kindling in the rat. Bipolar nichrome stimulation and recording electrodes were stereotaxically implanted into the right and left basolateral amygdala. Extradural recording electrodes were also placed bilaterally in the skull over the cortex. Amygdala stimulation was applied twice daily at the current intensity of afterdischarge threshold. Seizure intensity was graded by using Racine's standard five-stage scale. In the first group of experiments, saline or pirenzepine (10, 25, 50 and 100 nmol), a muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist, was injected intracerebroventricularly 1 h before the electrical stimulation. In the second group of experiments, rats were kindled to full stage 5 seizures. After a recovery period, 50 nmol of pirenzepine was administered intracerebroventricularly to kindled animals. In the first group of experiments, none of the animals pretreated with the doses of 50 and 100 nmol of pirenzepine reached a stage 5 seizure. Pirenzepine significantly retarded kindling seizure development and increased the total number of stimulations required to reach the first stage 5 seizure. Afterdischarge duration was also reduced in the pirenzepine 10 nmol group as compared with that in the saline-pretreated group. In the second group, seizure stage and afterdischarge duration were not affected by pirenzepine in fully-kindled animals. The findings of this study suggest that muscarinic M1 receptors may have a critical role in the development of kindling epileptic activity, but not in already kindled seizures.", 
    "32": "We report a case of 61-year old man who was suffering from cerebrovascular disease with right hemiparesis and received I-123 iomazenil (IMZ) SPECT prior to carotid endoarterectomy. Severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) were revealed by cerebral angiography, and a hypoperfused area in left MCA territory and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) on I-123 IMP SPECT was demonstrated. In contrast, IMZ SPECT showed symmetric normal distribution. After the carotid endoarterectomy, the hypoperfused area in left MCA territory on IMP SPECT and hemiparesis had improved. It is thought that IMZ SPECT can be a useful tool for the prediction of improvement of cerebral perfusion and the clinical outcome.", 
    "33": "We report two patients with occlusive cerebrovascular disease who were examined by means of benzodiazepine receptor SPECT(BZR-SPECT) with 123I-iomazenil (IMZ) before extracranial-intracranial bypass surgery (EC/IC bypass). Preoperative low perfusion areas detected by cerebral blood flow SPECT (CBF-SPECT) were divided into two parts on BZR-SPECT images. In the low perfusion areas where the BZR were preserved, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) increased on postoperative CBF-SPECT, but where the BZR were not preserved, rCBF did not increase on postoperative CBF-SPECT. On visual inspection, the SPECT images of postoperative CBF-SPECT appeared similar to those of preoperative BZR-SPECT. For evaluation of the ischemic brain condition itself, instead of the cerebral metabolism, the distribution and activity of cerebral neurons indicated by BZR-SPECT with IMZ might be utilized.", 
    "34": "To investigate the relationship between prognosis of aphasia and neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex, we evaluated the distribution of central-type benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) binding in post-stroke aphasics with [123I]iomazenil and SPECT. We performed iomazenil SPECT in six aphasic patients (aged from 45 to 75 years; all right-handed) with unilateral left cerebral infarction. Three patients showed signs of Broca's aphasia and the other three Wernicke's aphasia. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) imaging was performed with [123I]iodoamphetamine (IMP). The regions of interest (ROIs) on both images were set in the cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex and language-relevant area in both hemispheres. Three patients were classified in the mild prognosis group and the other three in the moderate prognosis group. The left language-relevant area was more closely concerned with the difference in aphasic symptoms than the right one in both BZR and CBF distribution, but the ipsilateral to the contralateral ratio (I/C ratio) in the language-relevant areas in the BZR distribution was significantly lower in the moderate prognosis group than in the mild prognosis group, although no difference was seen for these values between the two groups in the CBF distribution. These results suggest that BZR imaging, which makes possible an increase in neuronal cell viability in the cerebral cortex, is useful not only for clarifying the aphasic symptoms but also for evaluating the prognosis of aphasia in patients with cerebral infarction.", 
    "35": "A method for the analysis of [1-(4-aminophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-7, 8-dimethoxy-4H-2,3-benzodiazepin-4-one] (CFM-2) and its analogues CFM-3, CFM-4 and CFM-5 in rat plasma was developed. The 2,3-benzodiazepines (2,3-BZs) were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet detection (UV) at 240 nm. The method exhibited a large linear range from 0.05 to 2 micrograms/ml with an intra-assay accuracy for all studied compounds ranging from 92 to 105.5%; whereas the intra-assay precision ranged from 0.59 to 8.16% in rat plasma. The inter-assay accuracy of CFM-2, CFM-4 and their 3-methyl derivatives, CFM-3 and CFM-5 ranged from 92.2 to 107% and the inter-assay precision ranged from 2.17 to 11.9% in rat plasma. The lower limit of detection was 5.5 ng/ml for CFM-2, 6.5 ng/ml for CFM-3, 7 ng/ml for CFM-4 and 8.5 ng/ml for CFM-5 in rat plasma. The pharmacokinetic study demonstrated that 2,3-BZs achieved a peak plasma concentration between 45 and 75 min after drug administration. Moreover, we observed that plasma chromatograms of rats treated with CFM-3, CFM-4 and CFM-5, respectively, showed a peak consistent with CFM-2. Our study suggests that CFM-4, CFM-5 and CFM-3 are prodrugs of CFM-2, in which they are biotransformed in vivo via different metabolic pathways. In particular, CFM-2 has been proven to possess anticonvulsant activity in various models of seizures, acting as alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptor antagonist.", 
    "36": "This is a report of two cases with schizophrenia in which a good response to olanzapine in an acute 6-week treatment phase was obtained, followed by early relapse without any clear contributing factors. Referring to a few other case reports of early relapse after an initial response to atypical antipsychotics other than olanzapine, the possibility is discussed that rapid displacement of these drugs due to loose binding could play a role in early relapse.", 
    "37": "In the central nervous system, magnesium ion (Mg2+) acts as an endogenous modulator of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-coupled calcium channels, and may play a major role in the pathomechanisms of ischemic brain damage. In the present study, we investigated the effects of magnesium chloride (MgCl2, 2.5, 5.0 or 7.5 mmol/kg), either alone or in combination with diazepam (DZ), on ischemia-induced hippocampal cell death. Male Wistar rats (250-300 g) were subjected to transient forebrain ischemia for 15 min using the 4-vessel occlusion model. MgCl2 was applied systemically (sc) in single (1x, 2 h post-ischemia) or multiple doses (4x, 1, 2, 24 and 48 h post-ischemia). DZ was always given twice, at 1 and 2 h post-ischemia. Thus, ischemia-subjected rats were assigned to one of the following treatments: vehicle (0.1 ml/kg, N = 34), DZ (10 mg/kg, N = 24), MgCl2 (2.5 mmol/kg, N = 10), MgCl2 (5.0 mmol/kg, N = 17), MgCl2 (7.5 mmol/kg, N = 9) or MgCl2 (5 mmol/kg) + DZ (10 mg/kg, N = 14). Seven days after ischemia the brains were analyzed histologically. Fifteen minutes of ischemia caused massive pyramidal cell loss in the subiculum (90.3%) and CA1 (88.4%) sectors of the hippocampus (P<0.0001, vehicle vs sham). Compared to the vehicle-treated group, all pharmacological treatments failed to attenuate the ischemia-induced death of both subiculum (lesion: 86. 7-93.4%) and CA1 (lesion: 85.5-91.2%) pyramidal cells (P>0.05). Both DZ alone and DZ + MgCl2 reduced rectal temperature significantly (P<0.05). No animal death was observed after drug treatment. These data indicate that exogenous magnesium, when administered systemically post-ischemia even in different multiple dose schedules, alone or with diazepam, is not useful against the histopathological effects of transient global cerebral ischemia in rats.", 
    "38": "Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and adrenomedullin (AM) are potent vasoconstrictive and vasodilative peptides. Vascular smooth muscle cells are one of the major producing tissues of these peptides. We investigated effect of thiopental, ketamine, etomidate, midazolam and propofol on the production of ET-1 and AM in cultured rat aorta vascular smooth muscle cells. Rat cultured vascular smooth muscle cells are used and the dose-dependent effect (10(-8)-10(-4) M) of thiopental, ketamine, etomidate, midazolam, and propofol on the production of ET-1 and AM was examined. The concentration of these peptides in the culture medium were measured by radioimmunoassay. Ketamine, etomidate, propofol and midazolam, but not thiopental, decreased the production of ET-1 at a concentration of 10(-4) M and the effect of midazolam is the most potent. Thiopental and etomidate produced small but significant increases in the production of AM at a concentration of 10(-4) M. Ketamine did not affect the production, but propofol and midazolam decreased the production at 10(-4) M and 10(-5) M, respectively. These results suggest that thiopental, ketamine, etomidate, propofol and midazolam differentially affect the production of ET-1 and AM in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.", 
    "39": "Progress in nuclear medicine has always been a function of technological advances, and applications in neurology and psychiatry illustrate the point. Improvements in radiation detectors now allow for three-dimensional and quantitative mapping of the distribution of a labelled compound in the human brain. New ligands permit the study of specific functioning signals of the blood/brain barrier, blood flow, metabolism (oxygen, glucose, aminoacids), and neurotransmission (dopamine, benzodiazepine, serotonin receptors). The picomolar sensitivity of nuclear medicine can now be coupled to a wide group of ligands which offer specific information that can be obtained in no other way in the living patient.", 
    "40": "L-Thyroxine (T4) is commonly prescribed medication for hypothyroidism in humans and animals. Overdose has generally resulted in limited symptomatology managed with sedatives and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. We describe the largest acute T4 ingestion ever reported, which resulted in a profound thyrotoxicosis, resistant to treatment. A 34-y-old man ingested 900 (0.8 mg) tablets of veterinary T4 (720 mg) and was given 60 g of activated charcoal. He became lethargic on post-ingestion days 2 and 3; had vomiting, diaphoresis and insomnia on day 4; on day 5 he \"looked like he had too much coffee\", began \"using a lot of words\" and became agitated, assaultive and stopped speaking intelligibly; and on day 6 returned to the hospital combative and confused. He was diaphoretic, mydriatic, hyperreflexic, tremulous, with clear lungs and active bowel sounds, and received activated charcoal, haloperidol, diazepam, and phenobarbital, and was tracheally intubated. During hospitalization he was rehydrated, treated with propranolol and diazepam, but remained continuously tachycardic. On day 12 he became afebrile and his tachycardia resolved. Free T4 levels ranged from > 13 mcg/dL on day 6 to 1.2 mcg/dL on day 12. By discharge (day 15) he had lost 20 kilograms of body weight, but was clinically euthyroid 2 w later. This case suggests that large intentional T4 ingestions should be managed differently than current T4 overdose protocol.", 
    "41": "1. The use of the Stroop Color-Word Test as a model of experimentally induced anxiety was evaluated. 2. First, the authors examined the influence of trait anxiety and the type of instructions on the anxiety state level. Subjects with high trait anxiety (above 50 on State-Trait Anxiety Scale--STAI) showed a significant increase in anxiety state only with limited time (2 minutes) and error signal (with a ringing bell) procedures. This increase was blocked by diazepam (DZP) 5.0 mg p.o. both on pre- and post-test measures, but it was not changed by placebo administration. 3. The public performance simulation (with a video-camera) was effective to raise the anxiety state on normal volunteers with mean trait anxiety (between 30 and 50 on STAI). This raise was prevented with diazepam 5.0 mg p.o. but it was not prevented with placebo administration. 4. As a whole, these data suggest that the Video-recorded Stroop Color-Word Test is an effective anxiety provoking test, able to detect the effect of standard anxiolytic drug and stressed the importance of trait anxiety level and the instructions on tests that induced anxiety experimentally.", 
    "42": "Using 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride (GYKI 52466), we tested the hypothesis that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptors are important controllers of cerebral O2 supply/consumption balance in newborn piglets during both normoxia and hypoxia. Twenty-seven 2- to 7-day-old piglets were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose and were divided into four groups: 1) normoxia (n = 7), 2) GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg, n = 7), 3) hypoxia (n = 6), and 4) hypoxia + GYKI 52466 (n = 7). We used [14C]iodoantipyrine to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in mL/min/100 g, and we determined O2 extraction by microspectrophotometry, calculating cerebral O2 consumption (VO2) in mL O2/min/100 g in the cortex, hypothalamus, and pons. GYKI 52466 had no effect on regional VO2 or rCBF in normoxic piglets compared with controls. Hypoxia resulted in an increase in local VO2 and rCBF in the cortex and hypothalamus compared with controls: rCBF from 50 +/- 10 to 97 +/- 16 and VO2 from 2.4 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.4 in the cortex, and rCBF from 41 +/- 9 to 99 +/- 17 and VO2 from 2.5 +/- 1 to 3.8 +/- 0.5 in the hypothalamus. GYKI 52466 abolished this hypoxic flow effect in both the cortex (68 +/- 14) and hypothalamus (73 +/- 12). GYKI 52466 also blocked the increased VO2 in the cortex (2.5 +/- 0.4) and hypothalamus (3.0 +/- 0.5) of the hypoxic group. These findings suggest that the AMPA receptor is an important controller of VO2 in the cortex and hypothalamus during hypoxia in this immature porcine model.", 
    "43": "The stiff-person syndrome, a rare and disabling disorder, is characterized by muscle rigidity and episodic spasms that involve axial and limb musculature. Continuous contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles caused by involuntary motor-unit firing at rest are the hallmark clinical and electrophysiologic signs of the disease. Except for global muscle stiffness, results of neurologic examination are usually normal. Results of conventional computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain are also normal. The cause of the stiff-person syndrome is unknown; however, an autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected because of 1) the presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA); 2) the association of the disease with other autoimmune conditions; 3) the presence of various autoantibodies; and 4) a strong immunogenetic association. Anti-GAD antibodies, which are found in high titers in most patients, seem to be directed against conformational forms of GAD. New evidence suggests that these antibodies may be pathogenic because they interfere with the synthesis of GABA. In addition, a reduction in brain levels of GABA, which is prominent in the motor cortex, has been demonstrated with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with the stiff-person syndrome. The stiff-person syndrome is clinically elusive but potentially treatable and should be considered in patients with unexplained stiffness and spasms. Drugs that enhance GABA neurotransmission, such as diazepam, vigabatrin, and baclofen, provide mild to modest relief of clinical symptoms. Immunomodulatory agents, such as steroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulin, seem to offer substantial improvement. Results of an ongoing controlled trial will elucidate the role of these agents in the treatment of the disease.", 
    "44": "Analysis of lymphocyte muscarinic cholinergic receptors using quantitative techniques such as radioligand binding assay is made difficult due to the low density of these sites and the lack of subtype-specific selectivity of most available muscarinic ligands. In this study, a combined kinetic and equilibrium labeling technique recently developed for brain tissue was used for labeling the five muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes in intact human peripheral blood lymphocytes. No specific muscarinic M1 receptor binding was detectable in human peripheral blood lymphocytes using [3H]-pirenzepine as a ligand. Labeling of M2-M5 muscarinic receptors using [3H]N-methyl-scopolamine (NMS) by occluding various receptor subtypes with muscarinic antagonist and mamba venom resulted in the labeling of M2-M5 receptors in brain as well as in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. The relative density of different receptor subtypes was M3 > M5 > M4 > M2. The development of a reproducible technique for assaying muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes expressed by human peripheral blood lymphocytes may contribute to clarify their role in lymphocyte function.", 
    "45": "The substituent effects at positions 6 and 8 (compounds 17-31) as well as at the amide nitrogen (compounds 32-40) of a series of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridineacetamides were evaluated at both central (CBR) and peripheral (PBR) benzodiazepine receptors. The structure-activity relationship studies detailed herein indicate the key structural features required for high affinity and selectivity for PBR. Substitution on the imidazopyridine nucleus at position 8 with lipophilic substituents and the presence of one chlorine atom at the para position of the phenyl ring at C(2) are crucial features for high binding affinity and selectivity toward PBR. A small subset of active ligands (i.e., 17, 20, 26, 34, and 35) were evaluated in vitro in Xenopus oocytes expressing cloned human GABA(A) receptors for their effects at CBR and in vivo for their ability to stimulate the synthesis of neurosteroids such as pregnenolone, progesterone, allopregnanolone, and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC). Compounds 17, 20, 26, and 34 markedly increased the levels of neuroactive steroids in plasma and cerebral cortex, unlike compound 35.",

This type of management is appropriate for patients in stage I or stage II of withdrawal who have no significant comorbid conditions and have a support person willing to monitor their progress. Adequate dosages of appropriate substitute medications are important for successful detoxification. In addition, comorbid psychiatric, personality and medical disorders must be managed, and social and environmental concerns need to be addressed.

    "47": "To implement and retrospectively evaluate a therapeutic algorithm for the treatment of refractory status epilepticus with midazolam coma.", 
    "48": "Eight consecutive patients with refractory status epilepticus were mechanically ventilated. Their arterial and central venous blood pressures were continuously monitored by indwelling vascular catheters. These patients were also continuously monitored by a 16-channel video electroencephalogram (EEG). A midazolam bolus of 0.15 mg/kg was administered, and a continuous infusion of 1-2 microg/kg/min was started. If seizures continued, the infusion was increased every 15 mins by 1-2 microg/kg/min. If seizures stopped and/or burst suppression was achieved, the patients continued to receive that dose for 48 hrs and were then weaned by decrements of 1-2 microg/kg/min every 15 mins.", 
    "49": "The patients' ages ranged from 17 days to 16 yrs, and they had various underlying diseases. In five of the eight patients, cessation of seizures occurred before achieving burst suppression on EEG, in two patients, cessation occurred during burst suppression, and in one patient, no response before or during burst suppression was encountered. The maximal midazolam doses required to achieve cessation of seizures and/or burst suppression, whichever came first, ranged from 4-24 microg/kg/min, with a mean of 14 +/- 6 microg/kg/min. The patients maintained stable cardiovascular function while receiving the maximal dose of midazolam and did not require inotropic support.", 
    "50": "Midazolam infusion, as per our described algorithm, is effective in terminating refractory status epilepticus. This treatment is not associated with cardiovascular instability, even at doses resulting in burst suppression. In the majority of cases, cessation of seizures occur before burst suppression is achieved on EEG.", 
    "51": "We tested the effect of cholinergic drugs on the concentration of intracellular free calcium in rat melanotropes. Acetylcholine, muscarine, carbachol, and nicotine resulted in a significant rise in this parameter. Effect of acetylcholine was reduced by atropine (non-selective muscarinic antagonist), pirenzepine (M1 muscarinic antagonist), and 4-DAMP (M3 > M1 muscarinic antagonist), but exposure to the M1 muscarinic agonist McN-A 343 resulted in a significantly smaller calcium-response than that seen in response to acetylcholine or to muscarine. This suggests the involvement of both M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors in the acetylcholine-induced calcium-rise. On the other hand, in the presence of atropine the acetylcholine-induced calcium-rise was not eliminated: this fact indicates that nicotinic receptors are also involved in the acetylcholine-induced intracellular calcium-rise. The acetylcholine-, and nicotine-induced calcium-rise was significantly reduced in presence of the neuronal-type nicotinic antagonist, mecamylamine. This suggests the involvement of a neuronal-type nicotinic receptor in the acetylcholine-induced intracellular calcium-response. Moreover, because in a further experiment almost 80% of the cells investigated responded to muscarine as well as nicotine, we conclude that both functionally active muscarinic and nicotinic receptors are present on the same cell.", 
    "52": "Individuals that may be especially susceptible to panic attacks in the rehabilitation setting are patients who have suffered traumatic brain injuries, post-concussion syndrome, lesions, or encephalopathy. An individual is described who suffered a traumatic brain injury and was determined to have suffered a panic attack during his rehabilitation stay. The manifestations of panic attacks are described, using the case report as an example. The psychological aetiology of panic disorders is also reviewed, and treatment options using four major classes of neuropharmacologic agents: benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamide oxidase inhibitors, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, are discussed. Given the increasing incidence and survival of patients with traumatic brain injuries, the complications of panic attacks and disorders will become more important; they are a serious condition that can affect an individual's lifestyle, employment, and relationships, and increase the risk of suicide. Rehabilitation specialists should be aware of the manifestations and management of panic attacks and come to appreciate that recognition of this treatable condition is important during all stages of rehabilitation.", 
    "53": "This article presents a consecutive case series of 70 patients treated with olanzapine, case management, and psychosocial rehabilitation in a community mental health setting. This group demonstrated highly significant improvement on all analyzed measures of symptoms and psychosocial function at 6-month follow-up. These findings suggest that results of efficacy studies of olanzapine will generalize to the community mental health setting. Furthermore, prescribing olanzapine in combination with case management and rehabilitation yields positive functional outcomes.", 
    "54": "We utilize data from a large, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of treatment for schizophrenia to compare the effect of therapy with the second generation antipsychotic olanzapine versus therapy with the conventional agent haloperidol on the perceived functioning and well-being of patients over 1 year as measured by the Medical Outcome Study Short Form (SF-36). We also compare the total cost of care between the treatment groups over 1 year and combine cost and functional outcomes information to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of both therapies in this sample. Over 1 year of therapy, patients receiving olanzapine experienced a mean of 5.75 units greater improvement than did haloperidol-treated patients on the physical health and functioning factor of the SF-36 and 1.66 units greater improvement on the mental health and functioning factor. The mean annual total cost of care, including the cost of medication therapies, was $9386.87 less for olanzapine-treated patients than for haloperidol-treated patients. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for olanzapine versus haloperidol treatment indicated a savings of $1632.50 per unit of improvement in the SF-36 physical health and functioning score and a savings of $5654.74 per unit of improvement in the mental health and functioning composite. Improvements in perceived health and functioning were also associated with reduction in hospital costs in the full sample. These findings suggest that patient-centered measures of functioning such as the SF-36 are an important component of the evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of novel treatments for schizophrenia.", 
    "55": "PHARMACOKINETICS PHARMACODYNAMICS: Methadone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver microsomes and binds selectively to mu opiate receptors. Drugs metabolized by these enzymes or mu receptor competitors can modify the action of methadone. Genetic polymorphism influences plasma concentrations of the active levo enantiomer and thus clinical efficacy. ANTITUBERCULOSIS DRUGS: Rifampicin lowers methadome plasma levels so dose must be adapted. Rifabutin does not affect methadone kinetics. ANTI-EPILEPSY DRUGS: Phenytoin lowers blood levels of methadone by about 50% in 3 to 4 days. Other anti-epilepsy enzyme inducers (phenobarbital, carbamazepine) increase methadone metabolism. ANTI-VIRAL DRUGS: The area under the curve of plasma concentrations of zidovudine in presence of methadone increase by 43%, increasing the risk of undesirable effects. PSYCHOTROPES: Plasma levels of methadone increase by 20 to 100% in the presence of fluvoxamine. The benzodiazepine-methadone combination can be fatal due to respiratory depression. OTHER DRUGS: Brupenophine is a methadone agonist at the dose of 1 and 2 mg. Chronic alcoholism reduces the area under the curve while acute alcoholism increases it. Pure morphine agonists raise a major risk of respiratory depression while partial agonists favor the development of withdrawal symptoms.", 
    "56": "After surgical operations delirium can occur as a serious and possible lethal complication in about 5-15% of patients. Additionally, risk factors such as old age, polymedication, organic and psychiatric diseases raise the incidence. After open-heart and orthopedic surgery more than half of the patients are affected. Delirium has negative effects on postoperative mobilization and reconvalescence and prolongs treatment on the ward. It is discussed in the literature that delirium may induce dementia in older patients. The correction of metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, as well as the therapy of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, belongs to prophylactic treatment. Environmental conditions which facilitate reorientation of the patient after operation have beneficial effects. Some success has been achieved by using the nootropic substance piracetam as a prophylactic. In acute treatment, the butyrophenon-neuroleptic haloperidol is the drug of choice. In delirium caused by intoxication with anticholinergic agents, physostigmin is indicated. Benzodiazepines, clonidine and clomethiazole are used in particular for the treatment of withdrawal delirium.", 
    "57": "In an attempt to systematically dissect the ligand binding properties of human serum albumin (HSA), the gene segments encoding each of its three domains were defined based on their conserved homologous structural motifs and separately cloned into a secretion vector for Pichia pastoris. We were able to establish a generally applicable purification protocol based on Cibacron Blue affinity chromatography, suggesting that each of the three domains carries a binding site specific for this ligand. Proteins were characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, gel filtration, N-terminal sequencing, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, as well as near- and far-UV CD. In addition to the affinity chromatography ligand Cibacron Blue, binding properties toward hemin, warfarin, and diazepam, each of which represents a standard ligand for HSA, respectively, were investigated by the measurement of induced circular dichroism. Clear experimental evidence is provided here for the location of the primary hemin binding site to be on domain I of HSA, and for the primary diazepam binding site to be on domain III. Further, secondary binding sites were found for hemin to be located on domains II and III, and for diazepam on domain I. The warfarin binding site was located primarily on domain II, while on domain I, a secondary binding site and/or parts of the primary binding site were found.",

The diagnosis of myocardial infarction was made on the electrocardiogram changes and lactate dehydrogenase profile. The diagnosis may be overlooked if there is no direct questioning about the use of drugs such as cocaine. Diazepam has an important role in the management of cardiac complications after cocaine use and should be used early in management.

Ovarian hormones or their metabolites have direct and indirect actions on neuronal receptors, which may affect responses to psychoactive drugs acting on the same central nervous system receptors. This study explored the effect of menstrual cycle phase on the mood-altering and performance effects of a single oral dose of the benzodiazepine triazolam. Twenty women received triazolam (0.25 mg orally) or placebo at the follicular, periovulatory, and luteal phases of their menstrual cycles in a within-subject design. Dependent measures included self-reported mood states, psychomotor performance, and plasma levels of triazolam, estradiol, progesterone, and allopregnanolone. After administration of triazolam, most subjects reported the expected increases in fatigue and decreases in arousal and psychomotor performance. Neither plasma levels nor mood and performance effects of triazolam differed across the three phases. This study illustrates a useful methodology for assessing responses to psychoactive drugs in normally cycling women and shows that the effects of this drug were highly stable across the cycle.", 
    "60": "The abrupt appearance of clozapine discontinuation symptoms represents a particularly unique situation that has not been characterized in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. A randomized, double-blind comparison of placebo (N = 53) and olanzapine 10 mg (N = 53) for 3 to 5 days following the abrupt discontinuation of clozapine (< 300 mg/day) was carried out. Subjects were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression Scale of Severity, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and the Mini-Mental State Evaluation. Subsequently both groups received open-label olanzapine (10-25 mg/day) for an additional 9 weeks. Statistically significantly more placebo-treated (24.5%) than olanzapine-treated (7.5%) patients experienced clozapine discontinuation symptoms (p = 0.017). Core symptoms included delusions, hallucinations, hostility, and paranoid reaction and translated into a significantly higher worsening from baseline on the PANSS total, PANSS General Psychopathology subscale, and MADRS among subjects randomly assigned to receive placebo. After open-label treatment with olanzapine for 9 weeks, both groups were clinically stable, suggesting that the discontinuation symptoms were transient. However, subjects who had been randomly assigned to the 3- to 5-day placebo discontinuation segment achieved somewhat less global clinical improvement. Although a pharmacologic interpretation is speculative, evidence of a clozapine discontinuation syndrome was apparent. In most cases, the direct substitution of a pharmacologically similar agent (olanzapine) prevented the syndrome. Clozapine discontinuation or noncompliance should be considered in the differential assessment of an acutely emergent psychosis. The possibility that subjects who experience a clozapine discontinuation syndrome may take longer or are less likely to clinically restabilize warrants further investigation.", 
    "61": "The aim of this study was to compare the disposition of the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine (C) in Japanese and Swedish patients receiving continuous treatment. Therapeutic drug monitoring data for C and the active metabolite N-desmethylclomipramine (DC) in Japanese patients receiving monotherapy (N = 12) and in those receiving C plus benzodiazepines (BZDs) (N = 96) as well as in Swedes receiving C monotherapy (N = 131) and in those receiving C plus BZDs (N = 43) were used. A population kinetic approach with Bayesian feedback was used to estimate the individual clearance values for C. The relationships between kinetic variables and covariates were evaluated by linear multiple regression. The median (25% and 75% quartiles, respectively) oral clearance of C was 12.7 L/hr (11.6, 30.6) in Japanese patients receiving C monotherapy, 18.1 L/hr (5.6, 31.8) in Japanese patients receiving C plus BZDs, 62.7 L/hr (40.0, 90.6) in Swedish patients receiving C monotherapy, and 56.5 L/hr (34.3, 74.1) in Swedish patients receiving C plus BZDs. When combining all populations in a linear multiple regression, clearance was correlated with ethnic group (p < 0.00001) and age (p < 0.0005), but it was uncorrelated with gender, body weight, and administration of BZDs. The C/DC plasma concentration ratios were 1.08 in Japanese patients receiving C monotherapy, 0.90 in Japanese patients receiving C plus BZDs, 0.51 in Swedish patients receiving C monotherapy, and 0.49 in Swedish patients receiving C plus BZDs. Thus, the lower oral clearance of C in Japanese patients compared with that in Swedish patients is not accounted for by the lower body weight in Japanese patients or by concomitant treatment with BZDs and is therefore likely to be a true ethnic difference. The higher C/DC ratio implicates a more pronounced serotonergic than noradrenergic effect in Japanese patients than in Swedish patients.",

    "70": "Olanzapine is a tricyclic neuroleptic agent that due to structural similarities was expected to be a safe alternative to clozapine, which has a 0.5-2% risk of agranulocytosis. So far, only rare cases of leukocytopenia and thrombocytopenia have become known. In the association, \"Drug Safety in Psychiatry\", which is made up of 25 German psychiatric hospitals, two cases of olanzapine-induced neutropenia occurred in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The adverse drug reaction was noticed 17 days after the first intake of olanzapine in case 1 and more than 5 months after the first intake in case 2. In the second case, a reexposure to olanzapine caused the neutrophil cells to decrease again. There were no clinical signs of an infection, and the blood cell counts increased immediately to normal ranges after discontinuation of olanzapine. No special treatment was necessary.", 
    "71": "Techniques for the detection of drugs of abuse were compared using data from 43 urine samples distributed by the United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme.

Significant lack of sensitivity was demonstrated for one or more analytes by all chromatographic techniques, including gas chromatography with mass spectrometry. Commercial immunoassay kits exhibited higher sensitivity, though some assays performed significantly less well than others. Significant non-specificity was also a greater problem for chromatographic techniques compared with immunoassays in samples containing therapeutic agents not structurally related to abused compounds. In the presence of therapeutic interferents structurally related to the test compounds, false positive reports for illicit materials increased from < 1% to > 6%. Use of confirmatory tests significantly reduced the incidence of both false negative and false positive reports.", 
    "72": "Porphyrias are inherited defects of heme synthesis with manifestations that can mimic surgical diseases; they can be provoked by administration of certain drugs. Manifestations such as abdominal pain, vomiting, tachycardia, hypertension, neuropathy, fever, confusion, and seizures have been described. Management of patients with porphyria is designed to avoid triggering drugs, such as barbiturates, and perhaps, benzodiazepines and ketamines. Nontriggering drugs should be used in the management of patients with porphyria. Because starvation can induce an attack, glucose infusions are important in the prevention and treatment of porphyria.", 
    "73": "The blood-brain barrier permeabilities of the type-A cholecystokinin receptor antagonists devazepide and A-65186 (Nalpha-3-quinolinoyl-D-Glu-N,N-dipentylamide) have been compared with those of the reference compounds iodoantipyrine, which readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, and mannitol, which does not. Anaesthetized rats received a bolus injection into the left carotid artery of [14C]iodoantipyrine (0.25 microCi) combined with [3H]mannitol, [3H]devazepide or [3H]A-65186 (1 microCi each). Rats were decapitated 12s after injection and the brains were removed. Four samples of left cerebrum (ca 100 mg each) were solubilized overnight and 14C and 3H activity were measured. The brain-uptake index for each test compound was determined as [(3H/l4C for sample)]/[(3H/14C for injectate)] x 100, with a value of 100 representing blood-brain barrier permeability equal to that for iodoantipyrine. The brain-uptake index (mean+/-s.e.m.) was 1.6+/-0.3 for [3H]mannitol (n=5), 90.6+/-4.1 for [3H]devazepide (n=7, P<0.001 compared with mannitol) and 3.5+/-0.7 for [3H]A-65186 (n=4, P > 0.05 compared with mannitol, P < 0.001 compared with devazepide). Thus, devazepide readily penetrated the blood-brain barrier whereas A-65186 did not. It is concluded that devazepide and A-65186 are likely to be useful pharmacological tools for determining whether cholecystokinin is acting peripherally or at brain sites beyond the blood-brain barrier to produce satiety or any other function mediated by the type A cholecystokinin receptor.", 
    "74": "It has been hypothesized that the immune system plays a pathogenetic role in psychiatric disorders, in particular in major depression and schizophrenia. This hypothesis is supported by a number of reports on altered circulating levels and in vitro production of cytokines in these disorders. However, the respective evidence is not consistent. This may be in part due to an incomplete control for numerous confounding influences in earlier studies. We investigated the plasma levels of cytokines and soluble cytokine receptors in psychiatric patients (N = 361) upon hospital admission and compared the results to those obtained in healthy controls (N = 64). By multiple regression analysis we found that circulating levels of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), soluble IL-2 receptor (sIL-2R), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF receptors (sTNF-R p55, sTNF-R p75) and IL-6 were significantly affected by age, the body mass index (BMI), gender, smoking habits, ongoing or recent infectious diseases, or prior medication. Cytokine or cytokine receptor levels were significantly increased in patients treated with clozapine (sIL-2R, sTNF-R p75), lithium (TNF-alpha, sTNF-R p75, IL-6) or benzodiazepines (TNF-alpha, sTNF-R p75). Taking all these confounding factors into account, we found no evidence for disease-related alterations in the levels of IL-1Ra, sIL-2R, sTNF-R p75 and IL-6, whereas levels of TNF-alpha and sTNF-R p55 in major depression and sTNF-R p55 in schizophrenia were slightly decreased compared to healthy controls. We conclude that, if confounding factors are carefully taken into account, plasma levels of the above mentioned cytokines and cytokine receptors yield little, if any, evidence for immunopathology in schizophrenia or major depression.", 
    "75": "The results of our study presented here establishes that gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) acts directly on the corpus luteum, leading to suppressed production and release of progesterone and thus disrupting pregnancy. A GnRH-agonist (GnRH-Ag) treatment suppressed the luteal and serum progesterone levels. This suppression is neither mediated by a fall in ovarian testosterone production nor its conversion to estradiol. Although the treatment suppressed the nuclear estradiol-receptor content and binding sites for LH in the corpus luteum, it had no effect on the luteal binding sites for GnRH and prolactin within 24 h. GnRH-Ag augmented the plasma levels of luteinizing hormone, decreased the magnitude of nocturnal surges of prolactin, and had no effect on luteal cyclic adenosine 5'-monotriphosphate levels. Yet, the treatment had no effect on the luteal content of free cholesterol. We have also demonstrated, for the first time, the presence of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in the rat corpus luteum, and the suppression of these proteins by GnRH-Ag leads to reduced steroidogenesis by the corpus luteum. Concomitantly, P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme, its activity, and its mRNA content and 3beta-hydroxy-steroid dehydrogenase content in the corpus luteum decreased. The treatment suppressed the plasma levels of pregnenolone and 20alpha-dihydroprogesterone. These data suggest that the suppression of luteal steroidogenesis by GnRH-Ag may be due to its inhibitory effect on the cholesterol transport and/or on the enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway. Furthermore, based on other observations made in our laboratory, we propose a hypothesis that an endogenous GnRH is present in the corpus luteum/ovary during pregnancy in the rat and that this GnRH may play a physiological role in the regulation, maintenance, and/or termination of pregnancy.", 
    "76": "Pigeons were trained to discriminate 5.0 mg/kg pentobarbital from saline under a two-key concurrent fixed-ratio 10 fixed-ratio 40 schedule of food presentation, in which the fixed-ratio component with the lower response requirement was programmed to reinforce responding on one key after drug administration (pentobarbital-biased key) and on the other key after saline administration (saline-biased key). After responding stabilized, pigeons averaged 98% of their responses on the pentobarbital-biased key during training sessions preceded by pentobarbital, and they averaged 90% of their responses on the saline-biased key during training sessions preceded by saline. In test sessions preceded by doses of pentobarbital, chlordiazepoxide, or ethanol, pigeons switched from responding on the saline-biased key at low doses to responding on the pentobarbital-biased key at higher doses (the dose-response curve was quantal). High doses of phencyclidine produced responding on both keys, whereas pigeons responded almost exclusively on the saline-biased key after all doses of methamphetamine. These and previous experiments using concurrent reinforcement schedules to study drug discrimination illustrate that the schedule of reinforcement is an important determinant of the shape of dose-effect curves in drug-discrimination experiments.", 
    "77": "The effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on the acid-base properties and on the solubility of a beta-blocker (pindolol) and of two benzodiazepines (diazepam and chlordiazepoxide) has been assessed. The study was performed by potentiometric and spectrophotometric determinations of the acidity constants and by spectrophotometric evaluation of the solubilities of the pharmaceutical drugs in aqueous solution and in solutions to which was added SDS with concentrations below and above the critical micelle concentration (cmc), at 25 degrees C and at an ionic strength 0.1 M (NaCl). The effect of the organized assemblies on the pKa values was quantified by the application of two theoretical models that differ in the inclusion of ionic exchange between positively charged species in solution. These models have allowed the determination of the binding constants for drug/micelle and yielded values in good agreement with those obtained by the solubility method, and in addition provide a more detailed picture of the effect of drug charge on its partition. The results can be taken to evidence different interaction modes of the drugs with the SDS micelles.", 
    "78": "In alpha1, beta2, and gamma2 subunits of the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor, a conserved lysine residue occupies the position in the middle of the predicted extracellular loop between the transmembrane M2 and M3 regions. In all three subunits, this residue was mutated to alanine. Whereas the mutation in alpha1 and beta2 subunits resulted each in about a sixfold shift of the concentration-response curve for GABA to higher concentrations, no significant effect by mutation in the gamma subunit was detected. The affinity for the competitive inhibitor bicuculline methiodide was not affected by the mutations in either the alpha1 subunit or the beta2 subunit. Concentration-response curves for channel activation by pentobarbital were also shifted to higher concentrations by the mutation in the alpha and beta subunits. Binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 was unaffected by the mutation in the alpha subunit, whereas the binding of [3H]muscimol was shifted to lower affinity. Mutation of the residue in the alpha1 subunit to E, Q, or R resulted in an about eight-, 10-, or fivefold shift, respectively, to higher concentrations of the concentration-response curve for GABA. From these observations, it is concluded that the corresponding residues on the alpha1 and beta2 subunits are involved more likely in the gating of the channel by GABA than in the binding of GABA or benzodiazepines.", 
    "79": "We determined the effects of pretreatment with midazolam or fentanyl on the ease of laryngeal mask airway insertion using propofol without a muscle relaxant. One hundred and eighty ASA class I or II patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups, 60 patients per group, to receive either placebo (Group C), midazolam 0.05 mg kg-1 (Group M) or fentanyl 2 micrograms kg-1 (Group F), respectively. Following intravenous administration of these drugs, Group C received propofol 2.5 (Group C-2.5) or 3.0 mg kg-1 (Group C-3.0). Group M and Group F received propofol 2.0 or 2.5 mg kg-1 (Group M-2.0, M-2.5, F-2.0 and F-2.5, respectively). There was a smaller incidence of severe head and limb movements on LMA insertion in Group M-2.5, Group F-2.0 and Group F-2.5 than in Group C-2.5. Airway obstruction and inadequate jaw relaxation, which were occasionally recognized in Group C and Group F patients, were not observed in Group M-2.5. Overall the ease of LMA insertion was significantly better in Group M-2.0, Group M-2.5 and Group F-2.5 than in Group C-2.5, however, the blood pressure in Group F after LMA insertion was significantly lower than in Group M. We conclude that pretreatment with midazolam 0.05 mg combined with propofol 2.5 mg kg-1 provides safe and satisfactory conditions for LMA insertion.", 
    "80": "The efficacy of anaesthetic premedication has been assessed using sedative scores or a visual analogue scale. However, in both it may be difficult to exclude evaluators' subjectivity or a placebo effect. Plasma concentration of catecholamines may also be useful for the assessment of patient anxiety. Recently bispectral electro-encephalographic analysis has been developed, and the bispectral index monitor has been reported to give measurements which correlate well with the depth of sedation. In the present study, we have examined the relation between bispectral index values and plasma catecholamine concentrations after oral diazepam premedication. Twenty-eight patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomly assigned to one of two groups: diazepam premedication group (group D(+), n = 14) and no premedication group (group D(-), n = 14). The patients were premedicated orally with diazepam 10 mg and roxatidine 75 mg in group D(+), and with roxatidine 75 mg only in group D(-) 90 min before arrival in the operating theatre. After patients arrived in the operating theatre, the bispectral index monitor was applied. Venous blood samples (6 mL) were collected in the case of patients in group D(+) for the measurement of plasma catecholamines levels using high-performance liquid chromatography. The bispectral index level (mean +/- SD) in group D(+): 93.5 +/- 773.5 was significantly lower than that in group D(-): 96.1 +/- 1.8 (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between bispectral index and plasma norepinephrine levels (r = 0.567, P < 0.05). The present study suggests that the bispectral index monitor may detect the effect of oral diazepam premedication.",

Subjects were patients younger than 21 years seen between August 1997 and July 1998, who required intravenous, intramuscular, oral, rectal, intranasal, or inhalational agents for painful procedures or diagnostic imaging. All patients who underwent procedural sedation and analgesia were continually monitored. Adverse events and complications were recorded. The ED controlled substance log was checked weekly and all sedations were reviewed. Adverse events were defined as follows: oxygen desaturation less than 90%, apnea, stridor, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, cardiovascular instability, paradoxical reactions, emergence reactions, emesis, and aspiration. Complications were defined as adverse events that negatively affected outcome or delayed recovery.",

There was no statistically significant difference in mean doses for all procedural sedation and analgesia medication regimens between those children who experienced adverse events and those who did not. No single drug or drug regimen was associated with a higher adverse event rate. In addition, there was no significant difference in the adverse event rate between males and females, among the different ages, or among the different indications for procedural sedation and analgesia.

    "89": "A single exposure to the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety reduces or abolishes the anxiolytic efficacy of benzodiazepines. The present study was designed to examine whether this phenomenon of \"one-trial tolerance\" resulted from a motivational deficit on trial 2. We hypothesized that whereas there is a motivational conflict on trial 1 in relation to the open arms (exploration drive X natural fear of open spaces), there is no \"reason\" for an animal to explore it on trial 2. A motivational conflict was introduced on trial 2 by rendering the enclosed arms of the apparatus aversive on trial 1. Thus, every time rats entered the enclosed arms, an aversive situation (light and hot air blow) was produced until they left the arm. On trial 2, rats did not receive this aversive stimulation. Chlordiazepoxide significantly enhanced the percent open arm time as well as the percent open arm entries on trial 2 in rats that had been submitted to the aversive stimulation in the enclosed arms on trial 1, but was not effective in rats which had been exposed to the apparatus in the absence of the aversive stimulation on trial 1. In addition, there was no difference in the percent open arm time and entries on trial 2 between saline-treated rats submitted to the aversive or non-aversive condition on trial 1. The aversive condition on trial 1 did not modify the number of total arm entries on trial 2, either. The results suggest that the anxiolytic effect of chlordiazepoxide in the elevated plus-maze depends on the presence of a motivational conflict situation.",

Forty-five outpatients undergoing unilateral inguinal hernia repair by one of two surgeons (D.P. or M.A.) under local anesthesia with monitored anesthesia care were evaluated. Patients were invited to participate in this investigation at the time of the preoperative surgical visit. Patients who had a contraindication to the use of clonidine or who refused repair under local anesthesia with sedation were excluded. Patients were randomized to one of three groups: (a) clonidine 0.5 microg/kg intramuscularly and saline in the surgical site (mixed with the local anesthetic); (b) clonidine 0.5 microg/kg in the surgical site and saline intramuscularly; or (c) saline in both the surgical site and intramuscularly.

    "94": "Two types of rat TRH receptor (TRH-R1 and TRH-R2) have been identified and shown previously to exhibit similar binding and stimulated signaling activity via the phosphoinositide-calcium transduction pathway. Since mouse TRH-R1 exhibits basal (or constitutive or ligand-independent) signaling activity, we compared basal signaling by TRH-R1 and TRH-R2. Basal signaling was measured as receptor-mediated reporter gene induction via different transcription factors. We found that TRH-R2 exhibited higher basal signaling activity than TRH-R1 via pathways mediated by transcription factors AP-1, Elk-1 and CREB. Furthermore, CREB-mediated transcription was directly dependent on the level of TRH-R2 expression and was inhibited by midazolam, a specific inverse agonist of basal TRH-R signaling. Since TRH-R1 and TRH-R2 exhibit distinct anatomic distributions in the rat, it is possible that TRH ligand-independent signaling is more important in tissues/cells in which TRH-R2 is expressed and less important in tissues in which TRH-R1 is found.", 
    "95": "In the present study, we investigated whether cholecystokinin (CCK) or its structurally related peptide gastrin participates in long term regulation of adipocyte leptin secretion. The levels of circulating leptin observed after 2 and 6 h of refeeding in 18-h fast rats were significantly lowered by injection of the specific gastrin/CCK-B receptor antagonist YM022 at doses that did not affect feeding behavior. Moreover, in normally fed animals, circulating leptin was markedly decreased by chronic injection of YM022 (from 4 +/- 0.6 to 2.1 +/- 0.5 ng/ml). Consistent with these observations, YM022 treatment decreased leptin messenger RNA (mRNA) levels and increased the leptin content in rat epididymal fat tissue. Rat adipocytes exclusively contain gastrin/CCK-B receptor mRNA, but not CCK-A receptor mRNA. Furthermore, adipocyte membranes bound [125I]CCK-8 in a saturable manner, with kinetics consistent with a single class of high affinity sites with a Kd of 0.2 nM. These data argue for a physiological role for the CCK-B/gastrin receptor in adipocyte leptin regulation. We therefore propose that gastrin is involved in long term regulation of leptin expression and secretion in rat fat tissues through activation of an adipocyte gastrin/CCK-B receptor.",

In chronic pancreatitis the hepatic phase-I oxidation is reduced compared with the phase-II conjugation, as shown by the model drug clearance ratios. The clearance of ICG was also affected, pointing at a reduced hepatic plasma flow, provided that the hepatic extraction fraction is normal for these patients.", 
    "100": "Today, organophosphorus nerve agents are still considered as potential threats in both military or terrorism situations. These agents act as potent irreversible inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Conventional treatment of organophosphate poisoning includes the combined administration of a cholinesterase reactivator (an oxime), a muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist (atropine) and a benzodiazepine anticonvulsant (diazepam). However, numerous studies have demonstrated that the excitatory amino acid glutamate also plays a prominent role in the maintenance of organophosphate-induced seizures and in the subsequent neuropathology especially through an overactivation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype. Contrary to other non-competitive NMDA antagonists successfully tested in rodents exposed to organophosphate, gacyclidine is a novel antiNMDA compound which is in the process of approval for human use in France for neurotraumatology. This review summarizes the therapeutic value of gacyclidine as a complement to the available emergency treatment against severe organophosphate poisoning. Previous data obtained from experiments on primates in several scenarios mimicking military or terrorist attacks, using soman as the nerve agent, were used. Primates pretreated with pyridostigmine and receiving conventional emergency therapy at the first signs of poisoning survive. However, only gacyclidine is able to ensure complete management of nerve agent poisoning for rapid normalization of EEG activity, clinical recovery and neuroprotection. Gacyclidine also ensures optimal management of severe nerve agent poisoning in animals neither pretreated nor receiving emergency therapy likewise during an unexpected exposure. However, this beneficial effect is obtained provided that medical intervention is conducted rapidly after intoxication. Globally, the current lack of any other NMDA receptor antagonist suitable for human use reinforces the therapeutic value of gacyclidine as a central nervous system protective agent for the treatment of OP poisoning.", 
    "101": "Organophosphate poisoning is associated with adverse effects on the central nervous system such as seizure/convulsive activity and long term changes in neuronal networks. This study reports on investigations designed to assess the consequences of soman exposure on excitatory amino acids receptors in the rat brain. In addition, the protective effects of caramiphen which acts at these receptors, and scopolamine, which does not, was determined on soman-induced alteration in rat brain functions. Administration of soman (1xLD50) to pyridostigmine pretreated rats produced seizure activity (measured by EEG monitoring) in all animals tested. Estimation of [3H]MK-801 binding to brain membranes from intoxicated rats revealed a marked decrease in Bmax value 24 but not 2 hrs following soman administration. The specific nature of these effects of soman was demonstrated by the findings that [3H]flunitrazepam binding to central benzodiazepine receptors remained unchanged in soman-poisoned rat brain membranes. Both scopolamine and caramiphen, when used prophylactically prevented the lethal effect of soman and completely blocked the development of electrographic seizure activity (EGSA). In contrast, only caramiphen abolished soman-induced modifications in NMDA/ion channel characteristics. Caramiphen displaced [3H]MK-801 bound to the NMDA/ion channel complex, possibly by interacting with the Zn2+ site whereas scopolamine did not. Moreover, caramiphen, but not scopolamine, partially protected mice from NMDA-induced lethality. Thus, it is suggested that an important component of the protective efficacy of caramiphen against organophosphate poisoning might be attributed to its ability to modulate NMDA receptors in addition to its anticholinergic properties.", 
    "102": "1. The present study assessed the human transplacental transport of olanzapine, a new antipsychotic drug effective in the treatment of schizophrenia. 2. Using the normal-term placenta perfused single cotyledon system, we show that: (i) 5-14% of labelled olanzapine crosses from the maternal to foetal compartments in 4 h; (ii) transport depends significantly on binding characteristics, especially of albumin; (iii) no oxidative metabolites of olanzapine appear in the placental perfusate over 4 h; and (iv) approximately 17% of olanzapine, on average, is converted to the glucuronide, which is transferred by the placenta at a rate slightly slower than the parent drug.", 
    "103": "Patients with cluster headache are often treated with lithium. However, there are some patients who can not be fully treated with lithium alone. Two patients with cluster headache were treated with clonazepam, one of the most potent benzodiazepines. Lithium prolonged the period of remission, and the addition of clonazepam further prolonged it in case 1. Treatment with clonazepam reduced the symptoms in case 2, and when combined with lithium, the disorder went into remission after 6 months. These findings suggest that the combination of lithium and clonazepam may be effective in patients with cluster headache.", 
    "104": "Approximately half of the 40-50% of North American women who crave chocolate or sweets do so principally in the perimenstrum, the part of the menstrual cycle surrounding the onset of menstruation. We test two hypotheses about the events that trigger these cravings: 1) the premenstrual drop in progesterone levels; or 2) dysphoria or tension in the perimenstruum. Chocolate craving, sweets craving, and other perimenstrual symptoms were rated daily for six menstrual cycles by a sample of women with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Forty-four women satisfied criteria for cyclicity in chocolate craving, and 44 for sweet craving, determined during the first two cycles. Thirty-four subjects satisfied criteria for craving of both chocolate and sweets. After placebo treatments during the third cycle, subjects were randomly assigned, double blind, to administration of placebo, oral micronized progesterone, or alprazolam (a tranquillizer). Treatments were administered from the beginning of the third week to the second day postonset of menstruation during the fourth to sixth months of study. Neither progesterone nor alprazolam decreased chocolate or sweets craving.", 
    "105": "Surgical residency training is acknowledged as being stressful, however the degree of stress, factors causing it, methods of coping with it, and the incidence of substance abuse has not been previously studied in our environment. We therefore used a self-administered questionnaire to survey 100 Nigerian Surgical Residents of whom 72 responded in September 1995. Our result shows that our residents spend 39.8, 36.8 and 23.3 percent of their time on patient care, educational activities and ancillary care, respectively. Eighty-nine percent of them considered their work to be stressful mainly because of lack of facilities and the unstructured nature of the program. Physical exhaustion, irresponsible behavior and sleep disorders were some of the abnormalities suffered as a result of this. In all, 5.6% rated the stress as severe, while 69.4% considered it moderate. Examinations produced the most stress, followed by operating sessions and patient care. Overall, substance abuse was uncommon with 16.7% claiming to have used alcohol in the one month preceding the study, but 8.3% claimed to need alcohol in order to function. Tobacco, benzodiazepine and barbiturates are some of the substances that our respondents have abused. There was no reported abuse of cannabis, heroin, cocaine, LSD or other psychotropic drugs. We conclude that though stress is inevitable during surgical training, some of the causes can be ameliorated. There is need to reduce the amount of time residents spend on ancillary care, while the current methods of examinations should be reconsidered to incorporate current adult learning theories. Residents should get adequate time for rest and recreation while exposure to modern surgical training in better-endowed centers should be incorporated into the training programme.", 
    "106": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor contains a binding site (or sites) for benzodiazepines and related ligands. Previous studies have shown that the residue occupying position 101 (rat numbering) of the alpha subunit is particularly important in determining how some of these compounds interact with the receptor. We have made multiple substitutions (F, Y, K, Q, and E) of the histidine at this position of the rat alpha1 subunit and coexpressed the mutant subunits with beta2 and gamma2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes. The effects of flunitrazepam, Ro15-1788, and Ro15-4513 on GABA-gated currents were then examined using electrophysiological techniques. Three substitutions (F, Y, and Q) had little effect on the ability of flunitrazepam to potentiate GABA-induced currents and had relatively modest effects on the EC(50) value of the flunitrazepam response. Other mutations (K and E) resulted in drastic reduction of flunitrazepam recognition. All substitutions also affected the EC(50) values for Ro15-1788 and Ro15-4513, and some led to dramatic changes in their efficacy. For example, H101Y, H101K, and H101Q produced receptors at which Ro15-1788 acted as a partial agonist (maximum potentiation of 164, 159, and 130%, respectively), whereas Ro15-4513 acted as a partial agonist at H101F, H101K, and H101E (potentiation of 122, 138, and 110%, respectively) and an antagonist at H101Y and H101Q. These results indicate that the characteristics of the residue at position 101 of the alpha1 subunit play a crucial role in determining the efficacy of benzodiazepine-site ligands.", 
    "107": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type C receptor channels (GABA(C)Rs) composed of rho subunits are pharmacologically distinct from GABA(A) receptor channels (GABA(A)Rs). This difference is illustrated by the insensitivity of homo-oligomeric rho(1) receptor channels to many known modulators of GABA(A)Rs, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines. A number of endogenous metabolites of corticosterone and progesterone, known as neuroactive steroids, compose yet another class of compounds that can modulate GABA(A)Rs. Here, several neuroactive steroids are shown to also modulate the rho(1) receptor channel. 5alpha-Pregnane-3alpha,21-diol-20-one (allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone), 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-11, 20-dione (alphaxalone), and 5alpha-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (allopregnanolone) potentiated the GABA-evoked currents from rho(1) receptor channels and concomitantly altered the deactivation kinetics by prolonging the decay time. In contrast, 5beta-pregnane-3alpha-ol-20-one (pregnanolone), 5beta-pregnane-3, 20-dione (5beta-dihydroprogesterone), and 5beta-pregnane-3alpha, 21-diol-20-one (tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone), all potentiators of GABA(A)Rs, inhibited the GABA-elicited currents of the rho(1) receptor channel. In comparison to GABA(A)Rs, the modulation of rho(1) receptor channels by these neuroactive compounds occurred with relatively high concentrations of the neuroactive steroids and was more prominent in the presence of low concentrations of GABA, equivalent to fractions of the EC(50) value of the rho(1) receptor channel. Structural comparison of these six neuroactive steroids reveals that the key parameter in determining the mode of modulation for the rho(1) receptor channel is the position of the hydrogen atom bound to the fifth carbon, imposing a trans- or cis-configuration in the backbone structure. This is the first demonstration of isomeric compounds that can differentially modulate the activity of the rho(1) receptor channel.",

    "110": "The transfected Caco-2 cells formed a tight monolayer with TEER values and mannitol transport similar to the untransfected parent cell strain (wild type). However, the transfected cells (grown onto Millicell) reached maturity approximately 33% faster than the wild-type cells. Permeabilities of propranolol, nifedipine, testosterone, linopirdine, mannitol, and cephalexin were similar in transfected and wild-type Caco-2 cells. On the other hand, the transfected cells of early passages were much more metabolically active, and metabolized standard CYP3A4 substrates (e.g., testosterone and nifedipine) as much as 100 times faster than untransfected cells. In addition, metabolism of standard substrates was inhibitable by ketoconazole and TAO. Using comparable data, the transfected cells metabolized testosterone the fastest, followed by linopirdine and nifedipine (approximate ratio: 10:6:2). The metabolites of standard substrates were generally preferably excreted to the apical membrane.",

    "112": "This study described the effects of GABA agonists on glucose plasma concentrations of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Low doses of an indirect GABA agonist, AOAA (aminooxyacetic acid); a GABA(A) and a GABA(B) agent, THIP (4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]pyridone) and baclofen, respectively; and a benzodiazepine were administered to non-diabetic and to diabetic rats. Plasma glucose concentrations were estimated during fasting and after an oral glucose load. Diazepam (1 mg/kg), baclofen (1 mg/kg) and AOAA (30 mg/kg), significantly decreased glycemia after oral glucose overload of streptozotocin-induced diabetes. None of the GABA-acting agents tested changed fasting or glucose overload glycemia of normal rats. Diazepam was the only drug to increase the fasting blood glucose concentration of diabetic rats. Treatment with AOAA or diazepam was accompanied by increased insulin plasma concentrations in diabetic rats to levels similar to the ones of non-diabetic animals. These results demonstrate that benzodiazepines and other GABA drugs act the endocrine pancreas in vivo, ultimately increasing plasma insulin and decreasing high blood glucose levels of diabetic rats. The acute and prolonged effects of the multitude of drugs acting on the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine-chloride ionophore complex remain to be broadly investigated as a therapeutic tool in diabetes.", 
    "113": "Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) have various mechanisms of actions and therefore have diverse anticonvulsant, psychiatric, and adverse effect profiles. Two global categories of AEDs are identified on the basis of their predominant psychotropic profiles. One group has \"sedating\" effects in association with fatigue, cognitive slowing, and weight gain, as well as possible anxiolytic and antimanic effects. These actions may be related to a predominance of potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory neurotransmission induced by drugs such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines, valproate, gabapentin, tiagabine, and vigabatrin. The other group is associated with predominant attenuation of glutamate excitatory neurotransmission and has \"activating\" effects, with activation, weight loss, and possibly anxiogenic and antidepressant effects. This group includes agents such as felbamate and lamotrigine. Agents such as topiramate, with both GABAergic and antiglutamatergic actions, may have \"mixed\" profiles. Mechanisms of actions, activity in animal models of anxiety and depression, and clinical psychotropic effects of AEDs in psychiatric and epilepsy patients are reviewed in relationship to this proposed categorization. These considerations suggest the testable hypothesis that better psychiatric outcomes in seizure disorder patients could be achieved by treating patients with baseline \"activated\" profiles (insomnia, agitation, anxiety, racing thoughts, weight loss) with \"sedating\" predominantly GABAergic drugs, and conversely those with baseline \"sedated\" or anergic profiles (hypersomnia, fatigue, apathy, depression, sluggish cognition, weight gain) with \"activating\" predominantly antiglutamatergic agents. Systematic clinical investigation of more precise relationships of discrete mechanisms of actions to psychotropic profiles of AEDs is needed to assess the utility of this general proposition and define exceptions to this broad principle.", 
    "114": "The treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail adequate trials of typical neuroleptics is a major challenge. For these patients, the availability of atypical antipsychotics is a useful therapeutic advance. Olanzapine shows a superior and broader spectrum of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia, particularly its negative symptoms, with a substantially more favorable safety profile than conventional antipsychotic agents (e.g., haloperidol). However, little information on the clinical effects of olanzapine is available in Japan. This article provides information on the efficacy of olanzapine for various symptoms of schizophrenic patients and drug safety. Olanzapine is significantly superior to haloperidol in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of patients, and for tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms. Significantly greater improvement in avolition-apathy is achieved with olanzapine as compared to risperidone. These advantages are related to high affinity at the 5-HT2 binding site, no association with an alteration in dopamine A9 firing rates, and lower D2 striatal receptor blockade of olanzapine. Treatment with 10 mg/day olanzapine is more appropriate for positive symptoms, and 12.5-17.5 mg/day olanzapine is more effective for negative symptoms. Patients will need help adapting to a new level of functioning after a successful switch to olanzapine, and overcoming the disappointment that eventually occurs when the limitations of olanzapine become apparent.", 
    "115": "A study on the biology of 'panic disorder,' which I have classified under the category of 'anxiety disorder,' made progress recently. In a genetic study, the hereditary of panic disorder was checked by a 'linkage and twins' study, and the anticipation of panic disorder was recognized as being the same as that which is also found in the psychiatric conditions known as schizophrenia and manic depression. A panic disorder patient regards the anxious sign of a model as ruinous, and this weakness in recognition has been duly noted. Therefore, I studied a patient showing a continuance state of 'hyper-sensitivity,' and compared this to a patient showing a 'sleep disorder.' Noradrenaline plays an important role in anxiety as suppression of the locus ceruleus (LN), the major NE-containing nucleus of the noradrenaline nervous system, brings on a calming effect. Yohimbine, however, which is an alpha 2 antagonist, is found to induce panic attacks. The fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) suppresses panic attacks suggests that serotonin is connected with panic disorders. It is also thought that the 'raphe nucleus' is the site of origin of the serotonin nervous system, which participates in the control of anxiety. This suggests the participation of a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) nervous system in which the administration of benzodiazepine at a high potency would be an effective agent against panic disorder. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is also suggested to have a connection with panic disorder as CCK-4 causes panic attacks. There has been no CCK antagonist found effective for an object- or time-oriented panic disorder at the present. It is thought that corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) is released during a panic attack. The development of a new CRF receptor antagonist is needed. In addition to the studies on the neurotransmitters of the traditional type, such as noradrenaline, serotonin and GABA, studies on the neuropeptides, such as CCK and CRF have become important for future consideration. Understanding this, image studies such as MRI, SPECT, fMRI and PET have become highly desirable.", 
    "116": "Linked administrative health care utilization databases offer potential benefits for postmarketing surveillance. The value of the Saskatchewan datafiles in an acute adverse event signalling scheme has been evaluated using two benzodiazepines. The first 20,000 patients dispensed lorazepam and the first 8525 patients dispensed alprazolam were followed through the datafiles over the year after their initial prescription of the relevant drug, and all medical services occurring during treatment were recorded. The most frequent adverse drug reactions to benzodiazepines are drowsiness, depression, impaired intellectual function and memory, lethargy, impaired coordination, dizziness, nausea and/or vomiting, skin rash, and respiratory disturbance. Data from our study showed that sleep disorders, depressive disorders, dizziness and/or vertigo, respiratory symptoms, esophagus and stomach disorders, and inflammatory skin conditions occurred significantly more often in the first 30 days after the initial prescription than in the succeeding six months in both drug groups, indicating that they are important adverse events. There are several limitations to the methodology; however, the results of the analysis indicate that the use of administrative health care utilization datafiles in a systematic assessment to signal potential acute adverse drug reactions is a feasible proposition, but further studies are required to assess whether events are real adverse reactions.", 
    "117": "Because benzodiazepines can cause significant morbidity and data of their use in elderly people in Canada are scarce, the patterns of benzodiazepine use by Nova Scotia's seniors were studied with the use of administrative, population-based data. The prevalence of benzodiazepine use in the fiscal years 1993/94 to 1995/96 was explored, the types of benzodiazepines used and the extent of use for periods exceeding 30 days were examined, and an attempt was made to examine the average daily doses used. Benzodiazepine use decreased from 28.74% in 1993/94 to 24.69% in 1995/96 (P<0.001). Long elimination half-life benzodiazepines accounted for 23% of benzodiazepines in 1995/96. The proportion of benzodiazepines filled for periods exceeding 30 days increased from 65% in 1993/94 to 68% in 1995/96 (P<0.001). Variability in the estimated daily doses of the benzodiazepines was such that comparison with recommended dose maxima could not be made with confidence, even though the averages of these estimated daily doses appeared to exceed recommended maxima, except for users of alprazolam, lorazepam, oxazepam or bromazepam. Although benzodiazepine use decreased, the observed patterns of use may place seniors at unnecessary risk for adverse health outcomes and increased health resource utilization.", 
    "118": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) can have effects opposite those of opioids. The present study was undertaken to determine whether peripheral injections of antagonists of the CCK1 receptor (lorglumide) and the CCK2 receptor (L-365,260) can influence the effects of morphine on maternal behavior during lactation. A total of 110 female Wistar rats were tested on days 5 and 6 postpartum. Groups were randomly assigned to morphine vehicle (MV-SC) + saline (S-IP), MV + lorglumide (LOR: 1.0 or 10.0 mg/kg), MV + L-365,260 (10 mg/kg), morphine chlorhydrate (MC: 7.0 mg/kg) + S, MC + LOR (1.0 or 10.0 mg/kg), and MC + L-365,260 (1.0 or 10 mg/kg). Maternal behavior testing was started 30 min after the injections, at which time pups were placed in the home cage of their mother. Latencies for retrieval, grouping, and crouching responses were scored. The results show that both lorglumide and L-365,260 potentiated the MC-induced inhibition of maternal behavior. In addition L-365,260 treatment alone inhibited maternal behavior. Blockade of both the CCK1 and CCK2 receptors potentiated the morphine-induced disruption of maternal behavior, while CCK2 antagonism alone also inhibited this behavior. The results suggest that CCK antagonism of opioid-induced disruption of maternal behavior occurs due to the action of CCK on both CCK1 and CCK2 receptor subtypes.", 
    "119": "Using the mouse tail-flick assay, we evaluated the antinociceptive effect and the interaction with the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonergic systems of the two \"atypical\" neuroleptic agents clozapine and olanzapine. Clozapine induced a potent antinociceptive effect in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 of 8.7 mg/kg. This effect was antagonized by the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone (p < 0.05), implying an opioid mechanism of action involved in clozapine-induced antinociception. Further evaluation demonstrated the involvement of micro1-, micro2-, kappa1- opioid receptor subtypes and of alpha2-adrenoreceptors in clozapine antinociception but not the serotonin receptors. Olanzapine induced a weak antinociceptive effect. The highest effect found was a 50% antinociception following an injection of 10 mg/kg. As the olanzapine dose increased beyond 10 mg/kg, latencies declined almost back to baseline. Yohimbine (an alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist) significantly reduced olanzapine's antinociceptive effect almost completely (to 10%; p < 0.05), while both naloxone and metergoline (a nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist) reduced it only partially. These results indicate the possible involvement of the alpha2-adrenoreceptors in olanzapine antinociception and to a less extent the involvement of opioid and serotonergic receptors. Although both clozapine and olanzapine are dibenzodiazepines with similar \"atypical\" antipsychotic properties, it seems that they differ notably not only regarding their hematological side effects, but regarding their interaction with the opioid system as well."
