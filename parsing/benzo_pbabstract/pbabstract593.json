    "0": "The combined effects of oxazolam (Tranquit), a benzodiazepine, and alcohol were examined in two separate studies. 20 healthy male student subjects participated in study I. 20 mg and 60 mg of oxazolam and placebo were combined with 0.55 g/kg alcohol and alcohol placebo. There were 3-4 subjects in each of the six cells of the 3 X 2 design. 102 healthy male employees of a company participated in study II. 20 mg of oxazolam and placebo were combined with 0.55 g/kg and 0.83 g/kg alcohol and alcohol placebo. There were 17 subjects in each of the six cells of the 2 X 3 design. In both studies achievement tests and subjective tests were applied before and after 90-120 min p.a. An analysis of covariance was used to evaluate the effects (pretest as covariate). The results in both studies showed definite effects of alcohol and only weak drug effects. All effects in the achievement tests pointed in a negative direction. In the few cases where alcohol and drug effects could be shown simultaneously, the effects added up in combination or the drug developed the negative effects of alcohol, which were not demonstrated under placebo alone. For the examined time of measurement the combined effects are comparable to the combined effects of other benzodiazepines.", 
    "1": "We injected ovariectomized female rats with estrogen and progesterone. Some of the injection regimens used are known to induce estrus, while other do not. The effects of these treatments on operant behavior were evaluated. Operant behavior was maintained under a reinforcement schedule, one segment of which involved experimentally induced conflict. Such behaviors previously have been shown to be modified by anti-anxiety drugs. Those hormone treatments effective in inducing estrus had behavioral effects similar to the effects observed for established anti-anxiety agents. Hormone-injection regimens not capable of inducing estrus were without effect on operant behavior. Our findings suggest that the reproductive cycles of female rats are associated with behavioral changes which may be indicative of changing anxiety levels mediated in part by changing titers of ovarian hormones. We suggest that the evaluation of hormonal influences on operant behaviors sensitive to tranquilizers should be a useful model system for studying possible mechanisms underlying emotional changes associated with reproductive cycles.", 
    "2": "Four benzodiazepine derivatives, reported earlier by other authors, were resynthesized and characterized by NMR, IR, GC/MS and elemental analysis. Three of the four compounds have melting points different from those initially reported by 35-70 degrees C. The differences in melting point along with the discrepancies in IR spectra between our samples and those previously reported suggest that at least three of the eight compounds reported to be 1,5-benzodiazepines have incorrect structural assignments.", 
    "3": "By kinetic analysis we estimated that all the 16 benzodiazepines investigated are inhibitors of the glucose uptake in human erythrocytes; their affinities, however, differ remarkably. The individual KI values ranged over 2 orders, the partition coefficients in a mixture of octanol/water over 3 orders of magnitude. Thus, the lipophilities of the benzodiazepines differ considerably; they don't agree with the trend of the KI values with exception of structurally very similar preparations. The thermodynamic parameters delta F degree, delta H degree and delta S degree for the association of the benzodiazepines to the transport protein were mostly of negative sign. From the results we discussed the importance of the chemical groupings for the inhibitory effect of the benzodiazepines on the glucose uptake as well as the mode of interaction between the benzodiazepines and the transport protein. Some parallels between the affinities of the benzodiazepines to the transport protein, to the serum albumin and to the receptors of the central nervous system were considered.", 
    "4": "Various stresses (i.e. transfer stress, exposition of animals to a new environment, footshock stress, anticipation stress) were found to produce hypalgesia as judged from an increase of the tail - flick latency in rats. Hypalgesia induced by transfer stress was slightly reduced by diazepam (5 mg per kg), but very significantly by chlorpromazine (5 mg per kg). Footshock-stress-induced analgesia lasted less than 15 min. Because naloxone or dexamethasone did not block the footshock-induced analgesia, the participation of the endorphinergic system in this form of stress-induced analgesia is not probable. During the 30 min lasting conditioned reaction to footshock administration (called here anticipation stress), marked analgesia was observed. This anticipation-stress-induced analgesia was blocked by naloxone, dexamethasone and chlorpromazine; no blockade was observed after diazepam. These observations suggest that the endorphinergic system in this form plays a role in stress-induced analgesia. The comparison of the effects of naloxone and/or dexamethasone on the analgesia induced by footshock on the one hand and analgesia induced by anticipation stress on the other thus suggests that different antinociceptive mechanisms are activated by the unconditioned and/or conditioned stimulus.", 
    "5": "The present study examined comparative self-administration of some typical CNS-affecting drugs with a new sleep-inducer, 450191-S, in rats, Most animals self-administered both methamphetamine and cocaine in an extremely stable and invariable fashion with cycles of alternating responding and non-responding periods during the day and at night. Response frequency increased in proportion to a fixed-ratio value. An initial increase in response rate followed by cessation of the responding was observed during extinction. Sixty-five percent of the rats tested self-administered morphine in a relatively variable and less stable fashion. Total daily morphine intake was directly related to the unit dose. Eighty-three percent of the rats self-administered pentazocine. Fifty and sixty-four percent of the rats maintained self-administration of phenobarbital and diazepam, respectively, with higher intake at night than during the day. Responding persisted at a low rate for several days during extinction. Abrupt withdrawal of 450191-S caused the same slight weight loss and moderate decrease in food intake as those seen with diazepam and nitrazepam, and cross-physical dependence between 450191-S and diazepam was found. Self-administration of 450191-S at 0.5-2.5 mg/kg/infusion was observed with 2 out of 11 rats, which was much less than that found with diazepam. These results suggest that 450191-S possesses little, if any, drug dependence liability of the tranquilizer type.", 
    "6": "We compared the effects of a single dose of flurazepam (Dalmane) 45 mg with placebo on the sleep of twelve young, healthy male volunteers. A double-blind random-order cross-over design was used. Flurazepam 45 mg had no effect on sleep latency to stage 1 or to stage 2 sleep and no effect on percent stages 3 and 4 sleep. Total sleep time and percent stage 2 sleep significantly increased on the drug night, while wake time, percent stage 1, and percent REM decreased. It is hypothesized that decreases in stages 3 and 4 that are generally seen on second administration or withdrawal of flurazepam are due to the major metabolite, N-desalkyl-flurazepam. In addition, respiration was recorded in six subjects. The number of NREM apneas increased from 15 on the placebo night to 29 on the drug night, although this was not statistically significant. The effect of flurazepam and other benzodiazepines on respiration deserves further study.", 
    "7": "Two groups of rats, Deprived and Satiated, were presented with food according to a fixed time 60-sec schedule. They were then injected with saline, 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg of chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride according to a Latin square design. During saline administration time spent visiting the food tray, time spent drinking, number of tray entries and the amount of water ingested were always greater in the Deprived than in the Satiated group; whereas the opposite was true for grooming. As chlordiazepoxide dose increased time spent visiting the food tray increased in both groups, but the effect was bigger in the Satiated than in the Deprived group. Drinking was not affected by the drug. Grooming and sniffing-rearing were reduced as the dose increased.", 
    "8": "A systematic survey of a series of high affinity binding sites in the forebrain of hens treated with a neurotoxic organophosphate has been carried out. Fourteen month old laying hens were treated with 750 mg/kg body weight triorthocresyl phosphate (TOCP) orally in gelatin capsules. Control birds received empty capsules. After 21 d, hens were killed and forebrain membrane fractions prepared for binding studies using the nitrocellulose filtration method. Incubations were carried out in the presence of low concentrations of pharmacological agents selective for certain classes of receptor sites. Nonspecific binding was characterized by simultaneous incubations in the presence of excess competing unlabeled ligands. Binding criteria that were satisfied in a prior study included specificity, saturability, and attainment of equilibrium during incubation. No significant change was found in treated hens assayed for dopaminergic, GABA, glycinergic, beta-adrenergic, and benzodiazepine receptors. However, a 30% reduction in binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate was apparent in TOCP-treated hens. These data implied a selective reduction of muscarinic receptors, suggesting a down-regulation in response to cholinergic hyperactivity. This dose of TOCP also caused paralysis and ataxia in all treated hens 21 d after exposure to the toxicant. These data demonstrate that a selective lesion in cholinergic neurotransmitter circuitry can be caused by a single administration of TOCP.", 
    "9": "Intoxicated persons appear frequently in substance abuse centers and in general hospital settings. The severity of their condition ranges from mild impairment to coma or delirium. The prominent features of intoxication with the major classes of abused drugs are described. Staff responses to intoxication are discussed. Guidelines are presented for systematic management of this condition.", 
    "10": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of two selected benzodiazepines on aspects of information processing. The theoretical framework chosen was the 'levels of processing' model by Craik and Lockhart [J. verbal Learn. verbal Behav. 11: 671-684, 1972] modified so as to permit storage strategies to be assessed directly as dependent variables. A double-blind study with 72 healthy male volunteers was used to investigate the effects of clobazam and lorazepam in comparison to placebo on storage strategies, different variables of retrieval and the extent to which storage and retrieval strategies agreed. Concentration and changes in mood were also determined. Neither clobazam nor lorazepam affected the storage strategies, but various aspects of retrieval were significantly impaired by both drugs. Thus the psychotropic agents selected do not influence the information process until after the first storage processes. One possible explanation for this retrieval deficit could be a decreased ability to develop or use a retrieval strategy which complies with the storage strategy developed. Furthermore, both substances affected mood. In addition, lorazepam led to significant impairment of concentration. This impairment of concentration is perhaps the reason why lorazepam impairs the information process to a greater extent than clobazam.", 
    "11": "In a prospective study of 211 outpatients undergoing cosmetic surgical procedures under local anesthesia supplemented with intravenous diazepam and morphine, patient pain response to the local anesthetic infiltration was graded and the recall of the operative experience was assessed. One hundred and fifty-five patients (73%) had either no pain response or a mild response, 41 (19%) had a moderate response, and 15 (7%) had a severe response. One hundred and eighty-seven patients (88%) had total amnesia for the local anesthetic infiltration and the operative procedure, and 183 (87%) could not recall pain, but had recall of events during surgery. There were no untoward drug reactions nor episodes of cardiorespiratory depression. We conclude that intravenous diazepam with or without intravenous morphine following triazolam, morphine, and premethazine premedication is a safe and effective regimen for outpatient surgery.", 
    "12": "Blood concentrations and clinical findings in 25 cases of overdose involving chlordiazepoxide (CDZ) alone (\"pure\") were compared with those in 23 cases of overdose involving ethanol in addition to CDZ (\"mixed\"). Both groups consisted predominantly of men who were chronic alcoholics. The mean blood CDZ concentrations did not show statistically significant difference between the two groups (\"pure,\" 5 mg/L; \"mixed,\" 6 mg/L). Following \"pure\" ingestion, patients were usually alert, and the level of consciousness showed no statistically significant correlation with the blood CDZ concentration. In contrast, after \"mixed\" ingestion patients were usually lethargic, and the level of consciousness correlated significantly with the blood CDZ concentration (P less than 0.05) but not with the blood ethanol concentration. In neither group was coma noted. For both groups the most common physical findings were tachycardia and dysarthria. Nystagmus was much more common following \"mixed\" ingestion while seizures, hyperreflexia, and hypertension were more frequent after CDZ overdose alone. Most patients were seen only in the emergency room and were discharged. The implications of these findings are discussed.", 
    "13": "A new electrophysiological model is described in which different types of psychoactive drugs can be differentiated from each other in the rat. Simultaneous focal recording of electrical activity from three brain regions in the presence of accumulating drug actions is followed by a calculation of the EEG power density spectrum. Division of the spectrum into 5 frequency bands for each brain region allows to evaluate a total of 15 variables. The values obtained after the last of 8 drug dosages are taken for a stepwise discriminant analysis. A distinct separation of amphetamine, chlorpromazine, diazepam and imipramine from placebo is achieved. The discriminant function obtained will serve for further drug classification.", 
    "14": "Single case experiments have been used to make pharmacotherapeutic decision making more objective. 4 single case experiments are presented. In the case of 3 patients the question was whether flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) should be administered. In the 4th patient the issue was whether self-administration of Limbitrol (amitriptyline + chlordiazepoxide) should be terminated. Planning and analysis of these experiments was carried out by the randomization test.", 
    "15": "This study investigated the emotional effects of the beta-adrenergic blocking agent oxprenolol (40 mg, p.o.) and the tranquilizing agent diazepam (5 mg, p.o.) in healthy subjects under three situational conditions: an emotionally neutral control situation and two situations designed to arouse different levels of anxiety. Both oxprenolol and diazepam induced positive emotional changes only in the more strongly anxiety-arousing situation. Significant differences between oxprenolol and diazepam in inducing emotional stabilization were not demonstrable.", 
    "16": "0.125 mg brotizolam and 2.5 mg nitrazepam proved to be equipotent in promoting and maintaining sleep in 29 elderly patients used to long-term hypnotics. These drugs were superior to placebo and they were excellently tolerated. The drugs were administered in a random order, double-blind, for 7 nights each.", 
    "17": "A 33-year old farmer ingested approximately 300 ml of a 20% solution of diquat along with about 80 mg flunitrazepam. The patient presented neurological (coma grade I), digestive (oro-pharyngeal erosions, ileus), hepatic (cytolysis), hematological (thrombopenia) and renal (tubular dysfunction) signs. Plasma creatinine did not exceed 1.22 mg/dl (upper normal value), but retinol binding protein level in urine (a marker of renal tubular dysfunction) reached a value of 337 mg/d (normal values less than 300 micrograms/d). Its level returned to normal value 18 days after the ingestion. Four hours after the poisoning, diquat level in blood amounted to 10.4 mg/l, but its level was below the detection limit (0.2 mg/l) 6 hours later. In urine, however, diquat was detected until day 13. The following therapy was applied: ventilation (FiO2:0.21), gastro-intestinal lavage, hemoperfusion, anti-oxidants and prolonged forced diuresis. The patient made an uneventful recovery. intestinal washout must be applied with caution since an ileus is a classical complication of diquat poisoning. Hemoperfusion was found to be of little value. The interest of prolonged application of forced diuresis is suggested by the detection of diquat in urine for about 2 weeks along with the presence of biological signs of renal tubular dysfunction.", 
    "18": "The level of ascorbic acid in the brain of growing rats was not influenced by efforts to accelerate neural activity. Treatments used to depress neural activity included thyroidectomy which produced a 13%-20% loss of ascorbic acid in cortical and cerebellar tissue and diazepam which produced a significant rise in the cerebellum. Ethanol and barbital were without effect.", 
    "19": "Both empirical epidemiological data on the causes of traffic accidents and conceptual models of skilled human performance stress the central role of perception and cognition. This paper examines the effects of drugs on two major components of cognitive perceptual performance, namely, concentrated attention or vigilance and divided attention. It is demonstrated that these two types of attention tasks are differentially affected by various drugs, so that sometimes one and sometimes another of these tasks is impaired. Various experimental paradigms to investigate these two attention functions are presented. It is demonstrated that attention tasks are frequently highly sensitive to drug effects, suggesting the importance of examining these functions when investigating the effects of drugs on skills performance.", 
    "20": "The authors report two cases of cutaneous porphyria in children aged 6 and 9 respectively. The clinical and biochemical patterns were similar to those of porphyria cutanea tarda. The manifestations were drug-induced in both cases (by sulfonamides and griseofulvin in the first patient, and by hydantoin and benzodiazepine in the second). The clinical examination and the determination of porphyrins in the relatives showed no abnormalities. However, the study of the erythrocyte uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase showed 50 p. 100 reduced activity in the father and grandfather of the first patient, and in the second case's mother. Treatment with chloroquine (3 mg/kg/week) produced the total remission of both cases with no recurrences in 4 and 2 years respectively.", 
    "21": "The binding of sulfisoxazole (sulfafurazole-INN) (100 micrograms/ml), diazepam (3 micrograms/ml) and digitoxin (0.025 micrograms/ml) has been studied in plasma from normal volunteers and from patients with hepatic cirrhosis. The free fraction of sulfisoxazole and diazepam in plasma was increased in these patients (22.9 +/- 3.0% and 6.5 +/- 0.7%) vs 6.6 +/- 0.6% and 3.1 +/- 0.2% in normal subjects, respectively), but binding of digitoxin did not greatly change (13.7 +/- 3.95% vs 13.9 +/- 2.27% in the control group). The increase in the free fraction of sulfisoxazole and diazepam correlated well with decreased serum albumin levels; but a change in albumin affinity, perhaps due to increased bilirubin levels, should also to be taken in consideration to explain this decreased drug binding in hepatic cirrhosis.", 
    "22": "We have developed a rapid extraction process using the DuPont Prep I automated extractor/concentrator to prepare serum samples for the high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) determination of clonazepam. The drug, at an alkaline pH, is applied to a styrene divinylbenzene preparatory extraction column. The Prep I is a reversible centrifuge that allows the sample to pass through the preparatory column, followed by a wash solution of deionized water. The rotor then reverses direction and dispenses 20 ml of ethyl acetate, which elutes the adsorbed drug into an aluminum cup that is automatically dried at 68 degrees C. The extract is reconstituted with 100 microliters of mobile-phase, 50-mM sodium acetate (pH 5.4):acetonitrile:methanol (450:235:265, vol/vol). The chromatography is performed on a C-18 radial compression cartridge and detection is by absorbance at 313 nm. A plot of peak height ratio against concentration is linear to at least 160 ng/ml. The recovery of clonazepam with this automated extraction is 97.5%, compared with 90.0% for a manual extraction method. The coefficient of variation is 2.9% with the automated extraction. Only propranolol was found to interfere with clonazepam, whereas clorazepate interferes with the elution of the internal standard, nordiazepam.", 
    "23": "The time course of the effects of caffeine (200 mg), diazepam (8 mg) and placebo on CNV magnitude, reaction time and state of mood was investigated in normal volunteers using a double-foreperiod paradigm. CNV changes were quantified by means of a linear robust fitting technique. In general, a reduction of amplitude was found for diazepam and an enhancement followed by a suppression in the caffeine condition. Emotional lability of the subjects, as measured by the Freiburg Personality Inventory was shown to strongly influence the nature and time course of these drug effects. Differential drug responses are discussed in terms of the attention arousal model.", 
    "24": "Relief of blepharospasm was achieved with clonazepan (CNZ, 1 mg i.v.) and benzhexol (BH, 5 mg i.m.) by acute parenteral administration in 5 cases of Meige's syndrome. Improvement was greater with CNZ, mean value on a quantitative scale 100%, than for BH (84.1%). Both drugs were less effective on the associated oromandibular dystonia (OMD) observed in 3 of the cases, relief again being greater when using CNZ (87.3%) compared to BH (58.3%). Intravenous administration of CNZ predicted the response to prolonged oral medication (6 mg/day) in 3 of the cases. Though both blepharospasm and OMD are thought to represent focal dystonia at different body sites, the extent of improvement achieved with these drugs at the dosage employed differed markedly.", 
    "25": "A brief review of the neurochemical effects of the convulsant agent L-methionine-dl-sulfoximine (MSO) on cerebral methylation reactions is presented. Our findings point to the involvement of a number of endogenous methyl acceptor molecules, including histamine, membrane phospholipids, and membrane proteins, in the mediation of the convulsant effect. Our findings also associate the inhibition of methylations by high levels of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine in brain with protection against MSO-induced seizures. We propose that MSO acts by eliciting the acceleration of a regulatory methylation-demethylation sequence at key molecular sites, including the benzodiazepine receptor complex, which creates an imbalance in this sequence's normal mediation of convulsant-anticonvulsant mechanisms.", 
    "26": "The authors revealed differences in the clinico-psychopathological structure, therapeutic time-course and efficiency of the treatment by tranquilizers (e. g. phenazepam, a drug whose effect is typical for the entire group of tranquilizers) in 86 patients with borderline states, the nature of differences depending on the typological characteristics of their personality structure. Hypersthenia was associated with a tranquilo-sedative effect while in hyposthenia a tranquilo-stimulating effect was observed. Electroencephalographic examinations also point to various routes of realization of the modulating influence of tranquilizers.", 
    "27": "Several C-3-substituted beta-carbolines (e.g., the ethyl ester of beta-carboline-3-carboxylic acid) have high affinities for benzodiazepine receptors and can antagonize the principal pharmacologic actions of the benzodiazepines. The observation that some of these compounds also possess 'intrinsic' actions, best described as pharmacologically opposite to the benzodiazepines, has provided a chemically induced model of extreme stress or anxiety. The actions of such compounds in currently used animal models of anxiety are reviewed, as well as the effects of these compounds in primates, including man.", 
    "28": "Oral administration of malathion (MTH) in sublethal (100 mg/kg) or minimal lethal (125 mg/kg) doses in buffalo calves produced toxicity with an onset within 15-20 min and peak effects including severe tremors and convulsions within 40-60 min. Various antidotal drugs were administered alone or in combination at the time of peak malathion toxicity (within 1 h) and were assessed for their ability to alleviate signs of cholinergic toxicity. Blood cholinesterase and aminotransferases activities were monitored at various times. A combination of atropine sulfate (0.5 mg/kg, 1/4 iv and 3/4 im) and pyridine 2-aldoxime methiodide (2-PAM, 20 mg/kg, iv) reversed the clinical evidence of malathion toxicity within 15 min. The combination of atropine sulfate and diazepam (0.75 mg/kg, iv) prevented death and cholinergic signs of toxicity except for weak muscular fasciculations, which persisted for 30-60 min. Atropine sulfate alone was less effective and also did not reverse malathion-induced biochemical changes. In contrast, administration of either 2-PAM (10-30 mg/kg, iv) or diazepam (0.5-1.0 mg/kg, iv) alone accentuated malathion toxicity. Thus, the combination of atropine sulfate and 2-PAM was the most effective antidotal treatment in acute malathion toxicity.", 
    "29": "The useful intramuscular premedication dose of midazolam was determined in 100 children divided up in three age groups: one month to three years, 3 to 10 years, 10 to 15 years. All biometric parameters were normal for the age, and comparable between similar age groups. Haemodynamic and respiratory parameters were not altered by the premedication. The reduction in anxiety, as assessed by the child's behaviour, was good or excellent in more than 85% of cases from all age groups; it was proportional to the dose used. The doses that had, for equivalent reductions in anxiety as assessed by the chi-square test, the least hypnotic effect, were: 0.5 mg X kg-1 before three years of age, 0.4 mg X kg-1 for the 3 to 10 yr olds, and 0.25 mg X kg-1 for the 10 to 15 yr olds. This fall in dose with age, quite usual in paediatrics, was not unexpected. The level of consciousness, one hour after surgery, was always normal. No undesirable side-effect was observed. These results, together with its physical, chemical and pharmacodynamic characteristics, make midazolam a choice drug for intramuscular premedication in children, with a foreseeable use in day-care anaesthesia. The unexpected finding of an age-dependent dissociation between the reduction in anxiety and the hypnotic effect is discussed in the light of a study carried out in the adult and recent data from the literature.", 
    "30": "A new water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam maleate, was used at a dosage of 0.15 mg X kg-1 to induce general anaesthesia for eye surgery in 30 patients. The following parameters were measured at times C (control), t1, t2 and t3 (2, 5 and 10 min after induction): systemic arterial blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, arterial blood gases and eye tone. Results showed very significant changes in acid-base balance, with an increase in PaCO2 and a significant fall in eye tone; changes in haemodynamic parameters were not significant. Midazolam therefore appeared to be a good drug to use for inducing anaesthesia in eye surgery, particularly in the elderly.", 
    "31": "The N-acetylation of the reduced metabolite of clonazepam 7-amino-clonazepam was studied in cytosolic preparation from human fetal and adult livers. The metabolite formed 7-acetamido-clonazepam was measured with high performance liquid chromatography. A bimodal distribution of the N-acetyltransferase activities was observed in cytosols from human adult livers. These activities were 117 +/- 11 and 27 +/- 16 pmoles X mg-1 X min-1 for rapid and slow acetylators, respectively. The data observed in the fetal specimens did not allow any conclusion about bimodality because of a low number of samples.", 
    "32": "After 2 h intraocular injections of 19 and 190 nmoles ibotenic acid in the rat retina produced an intensive vacuolization of the inner plexiform layer and cellular alterations, in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer. These alterations consisted of either cytoplasmic swelling accompanied by clumping of the nuclear chromatin or darkening of the cytoplasm along with nuclear condensation. A week later the retinas were thinner than the controls due to the disappearance of the affected cells. Pre-treatment with diazepam prevents the morphological alterations induced by 19 nmoles ibotenic acid; mainly the swelling, which was completely prevented, while the darkening was reduced drastically, although some vacuolization of the inner plexiform layer is still present.", 
    "33": "Twenty-nine patients with tardive dyskinesia (n = 20) or related syndromes [spontaneous dyskinesia (n = 3), levodopa-induced dyskinesia (n = 3), tardive dystonia (n = 3)] were treated with clonidine. Clinical effects of this drug were observed for up to 4 years. Seventy-five percent of patients showed at least moderate improvement, and in 50% of patients, full resolution occurred. In most cases, patients received concomitant medications, including neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Two patients received clonidine alone, and dyskinesia was only minimally improved; however, when bromocriptine was added, prompt improvement occurred on this combined regimen. On the basis of these findings, we suggest that not only receptor supersensitivity of dopaminergic neurons but also involvement of noradrenergic neurons is important in the pathophysiology of tardive dyskinesia and related syndromes.", 
    "34": "The imidazobenzodiazepine midazolam (MDZ), along with its 1-hydroxy and 4-hydroxy metabolites (1-OH-MDZ, 4-OH-MDZ) can be simultaneously quantitated by electron capture gas-liquid chromatography. After addition of diazepam as internal standard, alkalinized plasma samples are extracted into benzene-isoamyl alcohol. The organic extract is separated, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and chromatographed using 3% SP-2250 as the liquid phase. The identity of 4-OH-MDZ, not previously detected in human plasma in unconjugated form, was verified by negative-ion chemical ionization mass spectroscopy. After single oral doses of MDZ administered to humans, concentrations of MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ (alternatively named 1-hydroxymethyl midazolam) were similar, and both compounds were eliminated from plasma in parallel. Concentrations of 4-OH-MDZ were considerably lower, but this metabolite was also eliminated in parallel with the parent compound.", 
    "35": "The effects on sleep of a putative hypnotic, benzodiazepine (doxefazepam), were studied in 7 healthy volunteers. Subjects were administered placebo or the active compound at 10-, 20-, and 40-mg oral dose prior to 13 consecutive nights during which they slept in the EEG laboratory. Full-night EEG recordings were obtained, and the hypnogram was determined. The subjective characteristics of sleep (quality, dreams, etc.) were defined by self-administered rating scales; neuropsychological and quantitative waking EEG measurements were performed before drug/placebo administration and in the morning following the final awakening, in order to identify possible signs of 'hangover'. Volunteers thereafter slept at home for 15 nights, self-administering 10 mg doxefazepam each night, and returned to the laboratory for 2 additional full-night sleep recordings. The drug plasma concentration was monitored during the study. Doxefazepam (10 mg) reduced the number of intermediate awakenings and the shifts between distinct sleep phases; single 20- or 40-mg doses or a 2-week administration of 10 mg doxefazepam increased significantly the total sleep duration and the percent duration of the phase 2 and the synchronized sleep and decreased the percent duration of phase 1 and of the intermediate awakenings. Volunteers reported an improvement in the subjective 'quality' of sleep, while evident signs of 'hangover' were not observed. The compound appeared to be of potential use as a sleep regulator.", 
    "36": "Drugs influencing neurotransmission (alpha 1,2, beta 1,2 agonists, antagonists and diazepam) were given intraperitoneally to test their effects on the mortality of intravenous meglumine diatrizoate. Pretreatment with diazepam in two doses (0.14 and 0.56 mg/kg), alpha 1,2 agonist, beta 1 agonist and beta 1 antagonist affected LD50 so that 5 to 9 per cent more contrast medium could be administered to cause the same mortality as the contrast medium alone. Still higher (19-24%) doses could be used after an alpha 1,2 or alpha 1 antagonist. The beta 1,2 antagonist employed in the test decreased the contrast dosage by 13 per cent, causing the LD50.", 
    "37": "The effects of diazepam on visual-evoked potentials (VEP) have been studied. The general effects - increase in latencies and decrease in amplitudes of the main peaks of the VEP - were differentiated by segmented averaging (as a measure for the possible lack of stationariness of the VEP) and by psychological testing (to study the influence of personality traits on medication effects).", 
    "38": "A comparative clinical and pharmacological analysis of the neurovegetotropic activity of the tranquilizers phenazepam and diazepam (benzodiazepine derivatives) was carried out in 287 patients with neurotic disturbances. The patients were analyzed for the genesis, structure and nature of vegetative-effector permanent and paroxysmal disorders. The regular characteristics of the interrelationship between the major psychopathological syndrome and the nature of vasovegetative dysfunctions were established. Considering the above, the differential method was used to study the therapeutic time-course of the status of patients treated with the tranquilizers. Phenazepam was shown to have a predominantly sympatheticotropic action. Comparative analysis of the therapeutic response points to a higher effectiveness of phenazepam in cases of the paroxysmal and of diazepam in cases of the permanent nature of vegetative dysfunctions.", 
    "39": "A study was carried out in 37 patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery to investigate the influence of midazolam (0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg) on the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium bromide and pancuronium bromide. Neuromuscular block was measured by the force of isometric contractions of adductor pollicis muscle after 0.1 Hz supramaximal stimulation. Complete recovery time when midazolam was administered 1 minute before 1 mg suxamethonium/kg was not significantly different from that when suxamethonium alone was used, neither did midazolam have any significant influence on the intensity and duration of action of pancuronium bromide (0.075 mg/kg). It is concluded that midazolam can be combined safely with depolarising and non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agents used as adjuncts in anaesthesia.", 
    "40": "Twenty-two (22) patients with long-term benzodiazepine dependence ranging from 3.5 to 13 years (Mean 7.4 years) were referred to us for evaluation and treatment. Daily dosages ranged from 10 to 100 mg (Mean 43.8 mg) of diazepam or its equivalent. Psychiatric diagnosis by DSM-III criteria revealed that 13 (59.1%) had schizophrenic disorder; 7 (48%) had generalized anxiety disorder, and 2 (9.1%) had manic depression. Only one patient could be totally withdrawn and remain abstinent from benzodiazepines without substituting another psychotherapeutic drug. Benzodiazepine dependence appeared therapeutic in the majority of these patients since psychotic symptoms, anxiety, or alcohol abuse were reduced. Based on these observations and other studies, we suggest that long-term benzodiazepine dependence should not always be discontinued, since the patient may have severe underlying psychiatric and medical illnesses that are therapeutically well controlled.", 
    "41": "Deprived rats were given the opportunity to take water or a sweetened ethanol solution for one hour/day. Across days, intake of the ethanol solution increased. Doses of morphine prior to an opportunity to drink increased avidity for the ethanol solutions, while doses of chlordiazepoxide did not. The opioid antagonist naloxone decreased intake, whereas, the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 failed to do so. These findings confirm that certain opioids can increase ethanol intake, and further specify that, under the same testing regimen, benzodiazepines do not reliably modify rats' propensity to drink a solution containing ethanol", 
    "42": "An 18 h lasting moderate hypoxia equivalent to 7000 m altitude rises DOPAC level in the caudate nucleus and the mesolimbic area of the rat to about 130%. This elevation is counteracted by a singular high dose of nootropics of the \"energy mobilizer\" type, but not by vasoactive ones.", 
    "43": "In our studies of drug therapy in child psychiatry disorders, we have been using a battery of tests to monitor any effects of medication on the various components of cognitive processing. Our intention was to measure skills required by the children for successful classroom performance. We have used this test battery approach in open clinical trials of bupropion (Wellbutrin) and of alprazolam (Xanax) with child psychiatry patients. On no single test was the effect of bupropion vs placebo significant; however, there was no indication of any cognitive deterioration with bupropion. Group performance with alprazolam was more variable, and again no individual test showed significant changes with medication. These initial applications of the cognitive battery indicate that bupropion, a new antidepressant and alprazolam, an anxiolytic have no adverse effects on cognition at therapeutically effective doses.", 
    "44": "Seven healthy students cooperated in this study. They underwent four experimental periods at one-month intervals, each period comprising a single-dose test with diazepam (D) 15 mg, oxazepam (OX) 45 mg, nordiazepam (ND) 15 mg or placebo (given double-blind in randomized order) on day 1, followed by maintenance with respective drug for 7 days, and a retest with D 15 mg on day 8. Thus, psychomotor responses to D 15 mg were measured after one-week treatment with D 5 mg, OX 15 mg, ND 5 mg, or placebo, all taken twice daily. Serum samples were taken at each session day before and 2.5 hr after the drug intake for bioassay of serum benzodiazepine (BZ) levels against commensurable diazepam standard. On day 1, a single dose of OX 45 mg resulted in fourfold concentrations of serum BZ levels in comparison with the results of the doses D 15 mg and ND 15 mg. Psychomotor skills were also most impaired by oxazepam. ND 15 mg was less effective than D 15 mg, irrespective of the same serum BZ levels. One-week of treatment with D and OX seemed to diminish most responses to D, despite increased BZ effects on these functions. Pretreatment with ND reduced the subjective sedative effects of D. Our results support the view that the rate of development of tolerance to BZs is task-dependent. Tolerance developed mostly to the complex tests subject to learning while Maddox wing test (reflecting the degree of muscle relaxation) was resistant. ND, the main metabolite of D, plays little part in the tolerance that developed to D.", 
    "45": "This study was performed in order to correlate changes in blood levels of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam with the symptomatology of withdrawal and to examine their elimination kinetics in abusers. The determined half-life of desmethyldiazepam in five diazepam abusers had a wide range of 46.2 to 94.5 hours. Two episodic very high dose abusers exhibited shorter desmethyldiazepam half-lives than was considered normal, possibly due to auto-induction. The half-life of diazepam in a documented very high dose user exceeded that reported in the literature, probably due to accumulation. Withdrawal symptoms reported by the subjects were moderate and included some mental confusion. The most distressing symptom reported was dramatic mood swings which occurred over a matter of minutes. The disappearance of diazepam from blood appears to be the initial cause of withdrawal. Desmethyldiazepam may moderate the severity of the abstinence syndrome but probably lengthens the withdrawal process.", 
    "46": "Ro 15-1788 is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, which has also been shown to have some agonist properties. Since benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the physiological mechanisms of vision, a possible intrinsic effect of Ro15-1788 was sought in 6 healthy volunteers by study of psychophysical flicker thresholds, including critical fusion frequency and low frequency modulation threshold, and pattern reversal visual evoked response, using double blind cross-over methodology. In each session 2 tablets of Ro 15-1788 30 mg were administered. Using a two factorial univariate analysis of variance, no change was detected in any of the parameters studied.", 
    "47": "Rats were trained to discriminate nicotine from saline in a two-bar operant conditioning procedure with food reinforcement. There was partial generalization to the nicotine analogues anabasine and cytisine in rats trained to discriminate either 0.2 or 0.4 mg/kg nicotine from saline. However, generalization was complete in rats trained to discriminate 0.1 mg/kg nicotine and, in a novel procedure, any one of three doses of nicotine (0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg/kg). There was no generalization to the muscarinic-cholinergic agonist oxotremorine (0.0025-0.04 mg/kg). Additional experiments were carried to further characterize the response of rats trained with nicotine (0.1 mg/kg). These animals failed to generalize to compounds from a range of pharmacological classes (i.e., apomorphine, cocaine, chlordiazepoxide, picrotoxin, and quipazine), but there was partial generalization to amphetamine. Mecamylamine (0.5 mg/kg) but not hexamethonium (5.0 mg/kg) blocked the discrimination of nicotine and the generalization to cytisine. Anabasine (1.0-4.0 mg/kg) did not block the response to nicotine. The results support the view that the nicotine cue is mediated mainly through central cholinergic mechanisms. The dose of nicotine used for training has a very significant influence on the characteristics of the cue and 0.1 mg/kg of nicotine may be more suitable than 0.4 mg/kg as a training dose in future work.", 
    "48": "Because of the evidence that benzodiazepine binding sites are associated with GABA receptors in the central nervous system, it has been suggested that the behavioural effects of benzodiazepines may be mediated by GABAergic mechanisms. In order to investigate this hypothesis in relation to the hyperphagia produced by benzodiazepines, the effects of chlordiazepoxide were compared with those of the GABA agonists progabide and muscimol and the GABA antagonists picrotoxin and bicuculline. In rats adapted to a 22 h/day food deprivation schedule chlordiazepoxide produced a dose-related increase in food intake. Neither progabide nor muscimol produced a similar effect after IP injection, nor did these drugs potentiate the effects of a dose of chlordiazepoxide. Picrotoxin and bicuculline, each given at a sub-convulsant dose, did not affect quantities of food consumed and also did not antagonise the effect of chlordiazepoxide. These results provide no evidence for the hypothesis that chlordiazepoxide-induced hyperphagia in rats is mediated by GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "49": "Elderly normal volunteers (N = 12, mean age 70.4 years) were administered placebo or diazepam 2.5, 5, 10 mg in four consecutive sessions separated by at least a 1-week interval. Memory and psychomotor performance and plasma diazepam concentrations were assessed at baseline and at 1 and 3 h following drug administration. Significant impairments were found in response to all doses of diazepam. The maximum impairment occurred at 1 h, which coincided with the highest plasma concentration of the drug.", 
    "50": "Chronic injections of 2 mg/kg diazepam disrupted both steady-state performance and new discrimination learning in pigeons. However, the time course of disruption differed for each of the two tasks, i.e., steady-state performance was briefly disrupted early, whereas acquisition showed a more persistent delayed disruption. The difference was interpreted as resulting from a dual effect of diazepam on behavior. The early performance disruption was thought to reflect a general nonspecific sedative action of the drug, while the delayed disruption of learning was interpreted as the result of diazepam's selective interference with acquisition processes. Some support for rapid adjustment to the sedative effects of diazepam was found, but there was no evidence for the development of physiological tolerance to diazepam-induced acquisition deficits.", 
    "51": "A number of tranquilizing agents have been shown to inhibit conditioned avoidance responses (CAR) at doses that do not interfere with escape responses (ER). To test the hypothesis that this selective action may be due to differential response strengths of the two responses, rats were trained to press retractable levers in an operant chamber either to avoid a 0.5 mA shock during a 5.0-s warning period or to escape from a low-intensity shock within 5.0 s. The intensity of the latter shock was adjusted for each animal so that CAR and ER were comparable in terms of probability of occurrence and latency. While doses of chlorpromazine, clonidine, diazepam, and morphine that reduced CAR by 30%-50% did not significantly affect high-shock ER, i.e., ER on CAR trials where no CAR occurred, they interfered with low-shock ER to the same degree as CAR. These and other results suggest that the selective blockade of the CAR by these drugs in the CAR paradigm is primarily due to differential strengths of the CAR and ER. They also support studies concluding that tranquilizing drugs reduce avoidance because of a deficit in the ability to initiate motor responses, rather than interfering with associative processes or reducing situation-induced emotional reactions. However, the finding of a small differential effect, at least with chlorpromazine, on CAR and low-shock ER across trials within sessions indicated that different mechanisms may be involved in the suppression of these two responses.", 
    "52": "Although diazepam (Valium) reduces learning and memory of information presented after administration (anterograde amnesia), in some cases it improves retention of predrug information (retrograde facilitation). Three experiments examined the magnitude and the conditions for producing retrograde facilitation and tested three hypotheses about the cause of memory enhancement. Differential effort and enhanced consolidation explanations were rejected in favor of a reduced interference interpretation. Improvement in predrug memory occurs because poor postdrug learning reduces the amount of new information available to interfere with prior learning.", 
    "53": "The effects of diazepam (10-160 mg) and oxazepam (30-480 mg) were studied in volunteers with histories of drug abuse. Oral doses were administered every third day under double-blind and counterbalanced conditions. Dose-effects with area under the time-action curve data (AUC) showed diazepam to be 2.6-5.7-times more potent than oxazepam on various psychomotor, cognitive, staff-rated, and subjective measures. Comparison of relative potencies showed diazepam to be relatively more potent in producing 'liking' than in producing psychomotor and cognitive effects. Diazepam produced greater peak effects than oxazepam on a number of staff- and subject-rated measures, including liking. Onset of effect was more rapid and time to maximal effect was shorter (1-2 h versus 4-12 h) with diazepam than oxazepam, while time to offset of effect was similar for the two drugs. Diazepam was categorized as producing barbiturate-like subjective effects (38.3%) more frequently than was oxazepam (13.8%), while oxazepam was identified as placebo more often than diazepam. Repeated administration of 160 mg diazepam and 480 mg oxazepam showed that AUC liking was greater for diazepam than oxazepam and that tolerance to psychomotor and cognitive effects occurred with oxazepam but not diazepam. This study suggests that diazepam may have a higher abuse liability than oxazepam.", 
    "54": "Administration of diazepam at doses that produced ataxia (5-10 mg/kg IP) significantly decreased the discharge rate of substantia-nigral dopamine-containing neurons by 28.1% in freely moving cats. Diazepam also altered the characteristic decremental bursting pattern of these neurons, producing a steady rhythmic discharge pattern. Similar results were obtained with another centrally acting muscle-relaxant drug, mephenesin. However, the peripherally acting muscle relaxant dantrolene did not produce these effects. These data suggest that diazepam and other centrally acting muscle relaxants may produce their effects on motoric behavior in part by altering the dopaminergic input to the striatum.", 
    "55": "Effects on performance of 1, 2 and 4 g ascorbic acid were studied from 0.5-5.5 h after ingestion in six healthy females. Diazepam (5 mg) was included as an active control, and it impaired digit symbol substitution, visuomotor coordination and complex reaction time. There were no effects of any dose of ascorbic acid on performance.", 
    "56": "The distribution in subcellular fractions of pinazepam (Pz) and its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam (N-Dz) was studied after a single oral administration of Pz (20 mg/kg body wt) to rats. Animals were killed 2 min and 6 hr after dosing. The amounts of the parent drug and its metabolite retrieved in the microsomal fraction were small, but significantly higher than those in the nuclear, mitochondrial and soluble fractions. The cytosol contained the lowest percentages of both drugs. No substantial difference was found in the subcellular distribution pattern of both Pz and N-Dz 2 min and 6 hr after administration.", 
    "57": "The pharmacokinetics of the selective benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 has been studied in 6 healthy male volunteers following a single intravenous dose of 2.5 mg. The drug was only slightly bound to plasma proteins (40 +/- 8%, mean +/- SD). A negligible amount (less than 0.2% of the dose) of unchanged drug was recovered in urine. Hepatic elimination was rapid, as shown by a short t1/2 of 0.9 +/- 0.2 h, and high total plasma and blood clearances of 691 +/- 216 ml/min and 716 +/- 199 ml/min, respectively. The fast decline of plasma levels from about 60 to 2 ng/ml accounts for the short-lasting reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation by Ro 15-1788.", 
    "58": "Stimulus control was established in rats with 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide and saline by employing a two-lever response choice task and an FR10 schedule of food reinforcement. Once trained, administration of chlordiazepoxide doses different from the training dose produced dose-responsive discrimination responding and the chlordiazepoxide discriminative cue was observed to transfer to pentobarbital. Pretreatment with the convulsant bemegride antagonized the pentobarbital transfer but not the chlordiazepoxide cue, whereas the specific benzodiazepine antagonist RO15-1788 decreased the chlordiazepoxide cue in a dose-response manner without attenuating the pentobarbital transfer. Results confirm and expand upon other recent studies that suggest different mechanisms of action for chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital.", 
    "59": "Three experiments were carried out to test the long-term behavioral effects of 12 days administration of CDP (5 mg/kg/day) in rats. In the first two experiments, 4 weeks after the end of drug administration (CDP or placebo), and after 2 weeks of training to run a straight alley for food reward, animals were tested in extinction, i.e., following omission of reward (Expt. 1) or with punishment, i.e., 0.3 mA electric shock in addition to the food reward (Expt. 2). Drug-treated animals showed significantly increased resistance to extinction and to punishment compared with controls. In the third experiment, 10 weeks after drug administration, animals were exposed to 60 s of intense noise to induce audiogenic seizures. The convulsant metrazol was injected 5 min prior to successive sessions (10 min apart) with doses starting at 10 mg/kg an increased by 10 mg/kg each session up to 40 mg/kg. Drug-treated animals were significantly less susceptible to seizures than their placebo controls. These results suggest that chronic benzodiazepine treatment causes long-term neurochemical changes which are responsible for the observed behavioral effects.", 
    "60": "The effect of lorazepam (2.5 mg) was assessed in two tests of short-term retention (digit-span and Benton Visual Retention), and in verbal learning and picture recognition tests. Lorazepam was without effect in a test of digit-span, but it impaired performance in the Benton Visual Retention and picture recognition tests. In the verbal learning test lorazepam caused a severe anterograde amnesia. Increasing arousal during the presentation of material partially overcame this effect, but also improved the performance of controls. Lorazepam-treated subjects were able to learn a backwards-reading task at a rate no different from controls. The deficits caused by lorazepam are similar to those that have been observed in patients with the amnesic syndrome.", 
    "61": "Many drug interactions can be demonstrated, but only a few are so clinically significant that they necessitate adjusting drug dosages. The same drug combination may produce changes of variable extent or direction in different individuals. The reasons for this variability include genetic control of the rate and inducibility of drug metabolism, and environmental factors such as contact with chemicals. Among antimicrobial agents, chloramphenicol may cause accumulation of phenytoin (PHT) and phenobarbital (PB), and isoniazid may cause PHT, carbamazepine (CBZ), and primidone (PRM) to accumulate. Erythromycin may cause accumulation of CBZ. Among anti-ulcer agents, antacids may reduce PHT concentration while cimetidine may cause accumulation of PHT, CBZ, and diazepam (DZP). Salicylates displace strongly binding drugs such as PHT, DZP, or valproate (VPA) from the binding sites in plasma proteins, which may lead to some decline of the total plasma level with an increase in the unbound drug percentage. Conversely, anticonvulsants may influence the dosage requirements of oral anticoagulants by inducing their metabolism. Failures of oral contraceptives have been attributed to anticonvulsants in some patients. Probably the most predictable interaction that necessitates dosage adjustment is accumulation of PB caused by VPA. Intentional inhibition of PRM metabolism by nicotinamide serves as an example of attempts to utilize an interaction for improved therapeutic effect.", 
    "62": "Antiepileptic drugs prevent tonic convulsions induced by cerebral electroshocks. The present study investigated whether these drugs can also modulate the amnestic effect of the cerebral electroshock. It could be shown that phenytoin, ethosuximide, valproinate sodium, phenobarbitone, and clonazepam dose-dependently worsened the amnestic effect of electroshock (despite prevention of the convulsion). Carbamazepine, in contrast, significantly reduced the amnestic effect of the cerebral electroshock even at doses below the threshold for anticonvulsant activity.", 
    "63": "In light of the numerous but rather conflicting reports on the action of benzodiazepines upon the hypothalamo-hypophyseal-adrenal (HHA) axis activity, the effect of different doses of diazepam (0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) administered 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min before decapitation on plasma corticosterone level was studied in rats. While 0.1 mg/kg diazepam had no effect, 1.0 mg/kg diazepam decreased plasma corticosterone levels 30 and 60 min following drug administration. On the other hand, treatment with 10.0 mg/kg diazepam produced an increase in plasma corticosterone levels from 15-120 min following drug administration.", 
    "64": "In the present study we have investigated the effects of diazepam (DZP) (10 mg/kg) treatment of rat dams during different periods of gestation or during lactation on the development and behavior of their offspring. The results show that DZP exposure during different phases of early development has differing effects on later behavior. Exposure during mid-gestation resulted in early and transient hyperactivity, but no learning or memory deficits at 2 months of age were observed. However, both late prenatal and early postnatal exposure to DZP resulted in significant behavioral changes. Late prenatal treatment caused no hyperactivity but resulted in poor performance on the learning and retention of a choice discrimination task, while early postnatal exposure resulted in consistent and lasting hyperactivity and in substantial discrimination learning and retention deficits at 2 months of age.", 
    "65": "Acquisition of passive avoidance following aversive conditioning to a dark compartment was measured in mice under the influence of one of seven benzodiazepines, the GABA-mimetic drug progabide or PK 9084, a nonbenzodiazepine ligand on benzodiazepine receptors. The drugs were administered prior to the training trial and retention was measured in the absence of the drug 24 h later. Oral administration (dose in mg/kg in parentheses) of flunitrazepam (0.1), lorazepam (1.0), nitrazepam (3.0), diazepam (10), flurazepam (10) and chlordiazepoxide (30), all prevented retention whereas progabide (100-800) and PPK 9084 (10-100) were ineffective. In comparison to effects on motor capacity none of the benzodiazepines was outstanding in its acquisition interfering effects.", 
    "66": "Brain electrical activity changes induced by Ro 15-1788, an antagonist of central benzodiazepine effects, were investigated in 10 normal subjects. The diazepam-induced sedation, as ascertained by spontaneous EEG, was rapidly reversed after an intravenous injection of 5 mg Ro 15-1788. There appeared to be a good correlation between the EEG and evoked responses modifications; the decrease of the amplitude of the N2 wave may reflect an increase of alertness.", 
    "67": "Effects of flurazepam and its two principal metabolites, hydroxyethylflurazepam and desalkylflurazepam (0.5, 1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg), were studied on a delayed differentiation task in the monkey. Flurazepam (10.0 mg/kg) and hydroxyethylflurazepam (3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) decreased the number of correct responses and increased response latency; effects persisted to 4 h with the highest dose. Marked impairment of performance was observed with all doses of desalkylflurazepam and effects of 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg persisted to 24 h. Evidence of a disinhibitory effect of desalkylflurazepam was demonstrated. The study would point to a consideration of both metabolites in the hypnotic effect and in the impairment of performance observed after acute ingestion of flurazepam in man.", 
    "68": "Thirteen acute schizophrenic patients aged 14-18 years were treated with gradually increasing doses of diazepam to a maximum of 100-400 mg/day/p.o. with a total duration of treatment of 4 weeks. The clinical antipsychotic effect was evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), while the impact on the hypothalamic hypophyseal pathway was evaluated by monitoring the serum prolactin levels (SPL) determined by a highly sensitive homologous radioimmunoassay (RIA). High diazepam doses (100-400 mg/day) caused sedation but no clinical antipsychotic effect was observed. Diazepam treatment with doses up to 250 mg/day caused no significant rise in SPL, while the treatment with doses of higher than 250 mg/day resulted in a mild but still significant increase in SPL. The clinical and laboratory data suggest that diazepam has no direct antidopaminergic activity. The mild hyperprolactinemia achieved with the extremely high doses of diazepam (greater than 250 mg/day) is possibly due to activation of the GABA system which stimulates prolactin release directly or by inhibiting the dopaminergic neurons or alternatively to activation of the endorphinergic system.", 
    "69": "The effects of manipulating central serotonergic transmission were assessed on the anti-punishment effects of diazepam (2 mg/kg IP) in rats. In a paradigm involving the inhibition of pressing for food induced by the delivery of a signal previously associated with electric foot-shocks, lesioning serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raph\u00e9 with the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 1 microgram in 0.4 microliter) neither affected behavioral inhibition in control rats nor modified the ability of diazepam to release responding. Furthermore, suppression of pressing for food induced by a fixed ratio 7 schedule of shock presentation was reduced by bilateral infusion of 5,7-DHT (2 micrograms in 0.5 microliter) into the substantia nigra, but the ability of diazepam to increase punished responding was preserved. Finally, blockade of benzodiazepine-induced decrease in serotonin release by application of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (10(-5)-10(-4)M in 0.2 microliter) into the dorsal raph\u00e9 did not alter the releasing effect of diazepam on suppression of pressing for food caused by a signal of punishment. At these concentrations. Ro 15-1788 was devoid of any effect on behavioral inhibition in control rats. Taken together, these results indicate that the anti-punishment activity of benzodiazepines can be dissociated from the reduction in tryptaminergic transmission produced by these drugs.", 
    "70": "The psychomotor, cognitive, and mood effects of orally administered diazepam and placebo were measured over approximately equal to 3.5 h. A total of 120 volunteers were assigned to 12 groups of 10 each, representing the combination of four treatments (placebo, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg diazepam) and three testing sessions (7 AM, 1 PM, and 7 PM). A variety of cognitive tasks, tapping and postural stability tests, and a mood evaluation scale were used. Psychomotor and cognitive functions showed consistent dose-response effects, while for subjective evaluations, the only effect of dose level was in the duration of sedation. The pattern of impairment of cognitive functions suggests that the drug affects speed rather than accuracy, and it primarily blocks acquisition of new information or skills. Use of repeated testing may therefore be necessary to detect subtle drug effects. Subjects reported no tranquilization , which suggests that the anxiolytic action of the drug cannot be studied in healthy volunteers. There was no circadian influence on the actions of the drug.", 
    "71": "A total of 120 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to four treatments (placebo, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg) and three testing times (7 AM, 1 PM and 7 PM). Immediate and delayed free recall of word lists revealed consistent decreases in performance as oral diazepam dose increased from 0.1, 0.2, to 0.3 mg/kg. Paradoxically, as the dose increased, the number of predrug list words recalled also increased. A serial number-learning task displayed a pattern of delayed improvement of acquisition as the dose increased. Response times in a semantic-categories task were prolonged as the dose increased. Parallel recovery functions were observed for all doses and tasks. Full recovery after a single administration of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg/kg doses was estimated to occur after 3.5, 4.5, and 5.5 h, respectively. Several analyses were consistent with the view that acquisition and not retrieval was impaired by diazepam. There were no circadian interactions with the effects of the drug.", 
    "72": "An experimental paradigm for studying the discriminative stimulus effects of drugs in human subjects is presented. The paradigm was tested by training subjects to discriminate 10 mg d-amphetamine from placebo. Subjects who successfully learned the discrimination were then tested with two lower doses of d-amphetamine and with 10 mg diazepam. The discriminative stimulus properties of d-amphetamine were dose-dependent, and in two of five subjects the d-amphetamine stimulus generalized to diazepam. The simplicity and versatility of the paradigm give it the potential for use in a wide variety of experimental and clinical situations.", 
    "73": "A total of 147 outpatients waiting for a prescription to be filled at a hospital pharmacy were tested on their knowledge about diazepam (Valium). Subjects scored highest on questions about the effects of a small overdose, the drug's interaction with alcohol and hypnotics, and the relative contraindications of pregnancy and breast-feeding. Subjects were least knowledgeable about the drug's generic name, side effects, and interaction with minor stimulants (coffee, tea, cola, and cigarettes). Subjects who had previously used diazepam (N = 97) knew significantly more than subjects who had never taken it, but subjects waiting for a diazepam prescription to be filled (N = 40) were not more knowledgeable than subjects having another type of prescription filled. In contrast to recent findings that increasing patients' drug knowledge via \"Patient Package Inserts\" (PPIs) may also create an overcautious attitude toward the drug, the present study finds that diazepam knowledge gained experimentally is accompanied by an attitude shift away from such overcautiousness.", 
    "74": "The tricyclic anti-depressant clomipramine (7.5 or 15 mg/kg/day) was administered to pregnant rats between days 8 and 21 of gestation. Between postnatal days 31 and 47, both male and female offspring received three behavioural test. Prenatal clomipramine (15 mg/kg/day) increased baseline acoustic startle in females, but not in males; both sexes showed greater between-day response decrements if they had received clomipramine. In the social interaction test of anxiety, males prenatally exposed to clomipramine (both dosages), and females prenatally exposed to 7.5 mg/kg/day, revealed a similar profile to that seen after chronic administration of benzodiazepines in the adult. The likelihood that differences in within-session habituation could underlie the changes in social interaction that have been found in this and other studies is assessed.", 
    "75": "Development of single-dose tolerance to diazepam-induced neurologic deficits was assessed in mice by means of a rotarod test. Diazepam suspended in corn oil was administered orally in doses 5-20 mg/kg. Tolerance was found following a second administration of diazepam 24 h after a first dose. It decayed gradually over 4-5 weeks. Hence tolerance persists considerably longer than measurable amounts of diazepam or its metabolites are likely to be present in mice."
