    "0": "90 patients with active duodenal ulcer were admitted to a double-blind trial to compare the effects of pirenzepine (150 mg/daily), cimetidine (1 g/daily) and placebo on the healing of duodenal ulcer. 5 patients did not complete the trial. In 21 of 29 patients (72%) receiving pirenzepine and in 21 of 28 (75%) of those receiving cimetidine, the ulcers had healed after 4 weeks of treatment compared with 10 of 28 (36%) patients receiving placebo (p less than 0.01). Symptomatic improvement and reduction of antacid consumption were significantly more marked in the pirenzepine- and cimetidine-treated groups than in the placebo group. Tolerability of drugs was good. The results show that pirenzepine is as effective as cimetidine for the treatment of duodenal ulcer.", 
    "1": "A variety of agents are used as premedication for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (U.G.E.). To our knowledge, no double blind studies have been performed to compare their value. In this study phenoperidine (2 mg i.v.) was compared with diazepam (t mg i.v.) in 200 consecutive patients undergoing elective U.G.E. The study was randomized and double blind in regard to both endoscopists and patients. All patients were given atropine (0.4 mg i.v.) and a throat spray with 2% amethocaine. Patients who needed supplemental medication were given diazepam and excluded from final analysis. A graded questionnaire was recorded by endoscopists and patients after U.G.E., and a further anonymous questionnaire was returned by patients four days later. Statistical analysis revealed that phenoperidine was superior at facilitating intubation and providing more relaxation as judged by the endoscopist. Patient questionnaires, four days after U.G.E., indicated less distress during intubation and examination with phenoperidine. Nausea, vomiting, amnesia and phlebitis were uncommon after either phenoperidine or diazepam.", 
    "2": "A double-blind comparative trial was carried out in 64 depressed out-patients, comparing mianserin with a fixed combination of amitriptyline + chlordiazepoxide. Both preparations proved to be equally effective at the end of the trial, but the mianserin group showed a considerable therapeutic improvement at the end of the second week, in comparison to the other group. With regard to side-effects, mianserin produced by far less side-effects than the combination of amitriptyline + chlordiazepoxide. It was concluded that mianserin should be considered as one of the most suitable drugs for the treatment of depressed out-patients.", 
    "3": "Morphine is primarily metabolized through glucuronidation by a microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase. With the use of 14C-morphine the activity of this enzyme was measured in hepatic microsomes from ten kidney transplant donors with total cerebral infarction and four icteric patients with pancreatic carcinoma. In the former livers the rate of glucuronidation varied from 1.08 to 8.67 nmol per mg microsomal protein per min, with a mean value of 3.83. These values were somewhat higher than in the liver biopsies from the four cancer patients. Oxazepam, at 1/10 the concentration of morphine, inhibited the morphine glucuronidation by 35%. The inhibition was competitive. Salicylamide also inhibited the morphine glucuronidation but only at concentrations considerably higher than morphine. The relevance of the in vitro data for the in vivo situation is unclear, since the concentrations employed in this study are several-fold higher than those encountered in the plasma of patients treated with these drugs.", 
    "4": "The effect of 50 and 100 mg of 5,11-dihydro-11-[(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)acetyl]-6H-pyrido]2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one dihydrochloride (pirenzepine), respectively, given p.o. at 6 p.m. on nocturnal acid secretion was tested in 6 healthy volunteers. Pirenzepine showed a long-lasting antisecretory activity. The total acid output between 0 a.m. and 6 a.m. was reduced with 50 mg of pirenzepine by about 32% and with 100 mg of pirenzepine by about 41%. It is assumed that pirenzepine (100 mg at bedtime) should be tested in the prevention of relapse in chronic duodenal ulcer disease.", 
    "5": "The evaluation of new homogeneous enzyme immunoassay (EMIT) for benzodiazepines is described. The assay, although developed for direct analysis in serum, has been used to detect benzodiazepines in other body fluids and tissues; this is accomplished through two processes. The first consists of a previously reported technique of extraction and reconstitution of the original specimen. The second consists of dilution of the original specimen. The assay is compared to a gas chromatographic procedure.", 
    "6": "Immunoenzymatic test, EMIT Tox, proposed for qualitative and semi quantitative determination of toxicological levels of benzodiazepines in serum is compared with gas chromatography. When used for qualitative purposes in 102 sera, the EMIT Tox test gave 5% error. In semi quantitative determinations, the EMIT Tox test was applied to 139 sera with one or more of the three benzodiazepines (oxazepam, desmethyldiazepam, diazepam), showing a significant correlation with levels measured by gas chromatography; but the EMIT Tox test frequently yields values too low for elevated oxazepam and desmethyldiazepam concentrations.", 
    "7": "Many benzodiazepines used as anticonvulsants have nitrogen radicals in positions 1 and 4. Clobazam has nitrogen radicals in positions 1 and 5. We studied the antiepileptic effect of clobazam in 36 patients with intractable epilepsies in childhood. Their ages were 1 year 1 month to 16 years 5 months (mean 8 years). The mean initial dose was 0.33 mg/kg of daily doses and increased up to 0.71 mg/kg. Nine cases (primary generalized epilepsy 2/2, secondary generalized epilepsy 7/29) were completely free from seizures, and another 9 (secondary generalized epilepsy 8/29, partial epilepsy 1/5) experienced a decrease of 50% or more in seizure frequency. Seizure frequency did not change in 16, and increased in the other 2 (secondary generalized epilepsy 2/29). The antiepileptic effects were observed on the first day to 10th day after clobazam treatment. There were recurrences of seizures in 4 out of 9 patients with complete control of seizures, 1 month alter in 3 and 10 months later in one. Mean serum clobazam level of 7 improved cases was 73 ng/ml and that of 3 cases with no response was 94 ng/ml. Although mild clinical side effects such as drowsiness were observed transiently in 17 cases, no abnormality was found in laboratory investigations performed.", 
    "8": "Four hundred and nine patients age 30 and over with leukemia or lymphoma and a subset of 127 patients with myelocytic leukemia were compared with equal numbers of matched hospitalized control subjects and matched subscribers to the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Care Program (member controls). Prior use of phenylbutazone was somewhat more frequent in cases than in member controls only, but the difference was not statistically significant and the association appeared to be explained by an underlying relation of musculoskeletal disease to these lymphohematopoietic cancers. The association of musculoskeletal disease with myelocytic leukemia was present even when attention was restricted to the period at least two or five years before leukemia diagnosis. There was no clear association of amount and duration of phenylbutazone therapy with risk of leukemia. Several other drugs used for musculoskeletal conditions showed positive or negative relations to subsequent leukemia.", 
    "9": "Administration of benzodiazepines to male or female rats was observed to inhibit prolactin release. Basal secretion of prolactin was only slightly suppressed with the highest dose of benzodiazepines; however, the rise in prolactin release following a stimulus was prevented even at low doses (0.1-1 mg/kg). The benzodiazepine diazepam blocked stress-induced prolactin release and, when given during the critical period of proestrus, the proestrus surge of prolactin. Diazepam administration also blunted the release of prolactin induced by dopaminergic receptor blockade following haloperidol, or by serotonergic receptor activation produced by fluoxetine, a serotonergic reuptake inhibitor plus 5-hydroxytryptophan, a serotonin precursor. Inhibition of prolactin release by benzodiazepine was dose related, and inhibition was still evident after repeated diazepam injection. The potency of three benzodiazepine analogues to inhibit prolactin release correlated with their potency to displace radiolabeled diazepam binding from brain membrane fractions or to induce other biological responses (clonazepam greater than diazepam greater than chlordiazepoxide). These actions of benzodiazepines on prolactin release are similar to those reported for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The hypothesis of a benzodiazepine GABA receptor complex suggests that GABA may be involved in these in vivo actions of diazepam.", 
    "10": "(1) The active tension-extension diagram of slowly (2 mm/sec) stretched triceps surae muscle of the decerebrate cat has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of spinal motor activity. For example, diazepam at doses larger than 0.01 mg/kg shifted the diagram parallel to the right. (2) The effects of central muscle relaxants on the gamma system can be observed in functionally isolated group Ia fibres but also in the \"integrated\" afferent discharges of the whole (or a part of) S1 dorsal root in response to stretching of the triceps surae muscle. The latter has statistically more value than the former recording. The effect of diazepam could block the gamma fibres selectively. Diazepam at doses larger than 0.1 mg/kg could block the gamma activity totally. (3) More than 3 months after degeneration with dry ice, the reinnervated muscle shows a fully recovered twitch tension but fails to show gamma activity (alpha muscle). Diazepam has no effect on the discharge from the muscle spindles in the alpha muscle.", 
    "11": "In order to investigate the effect of diazepam in reducing the incidence and severity of cholesterol induced atherosclerosis in rabbits, 3 treatment groups were compared. The control Group I received the laboratory diet alone. Group II received cholesterol (1 gm daily, given by syringe). Animals in Group III additionally received diazepam (3 mg/kg/day) orally, again by syringe. After 21 days, animals were injected with Evans blue and 3 hours later their aortas were removed and examined for permeability changes. Serum was assayed for various lipid and lipoprotein components. Cholesterol feeding produced a 10-fold increase in serum cholesterol values in Groups II and III compared to the control Group I. The aortic uptake of Evans blue was significantly increased in animals treated with cholesterol but not in those which simultaneously received diazepam. Thus, diazepam prevented the increased endothelial permeability produced by hypercholesterolaemia, but it is not yet clear whether this effect involves the central nervous system or is a consequence of some more local membrane stabilizing action.", 
    "12": "The analysis of the effects of pirenzepine (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on S35 uptake of rat colonic mucus was studied by gel permeation chromatography. As it is well known, with this method two fractions - peak A and peak B - are clearly distinguished. In the included volume (peak B) pirenzepine decreases significantly the S35 uptake in the stimulated right colon. In the left one, the above effect was observed under both conditions: basal and stimulated. In the void volume (peak A), pirenzepine under basal conditions inversely shows an increase of the S35 uptake, whereas under stimulated conditions it reveals anticipated kinetic increase. Statistically, this data is less significant than that of peak B. All the findings demonstrated that muscarinic receptors of high sensitivity are present in rat colon.", 
    "13": "The effects of pirenzepine and scopolamine on presynaptic muscarine receptors (mediating inhibition of acetylcholine release) and postsynaptic receptors (mediating smooth muscle contraction) were compared in the myenteric plexus-longitudinal muscle preparation of the guinea pig. The preparation was preincubated with 3H-choline and subsequently superfused with Tyrode's solution. Field stimulation (1 Hz; 2 min) caused an outflow of 3H-acetylcholine that was depressed by the muscarinic agonist oxotremorine. Both pirenzepine and scopolamine produced shifts to the right of the concentration-response curve for the inhibitory effect of oxotremorine. Similarly, in contraction experiments, pirenzepine and scopolamine competitively antagonized the responses to oxotremorine. From the dose ratios pA2 values for pre- and postsynaptic effects were calculated. The presynaptic pA2 values for pirenzepine (6.90) and scopolamine (9.07) did not differ significantly from the respective postsynaptic pA2 values (6.66 and 9.40). Thus, pirenzepine like scopolamine does not distinguish between muscarine receptors that mediate contraction and those which mediate inhibition of acetyl-choline release.", 
    "14": "To compare in one and the same organ the presynaptic muscarine receptors located at the postganglionic adrenergic nerves with postsynaptic receptors at the atrial myocardium, the affinities of pirenzepine were determined in the perfused rabbit heart and those of pirenzepine and N-methylatropine in the isolated rat heart. Methacholine was used as an agonist to decrease the stimulation-evoked overflow of either endogenous noradrenaline (rabbit heart) or previously incorporated 3H-noradrenaline (rat heart) by a presynaptic muscarine receptor mechanism, and to reduce the atrial tension development of either the spontaneously beating perfused rabbit heart or incubated rat left atria paced at 2 Hz (postsynaptic effect). The pA2 values of the antagonists calculated from the Schild plots were very similar and, thus, did not reveal differences in the receptor structure. It is concluded that pirenzepine does not differ from seven other antimuscarinic drugs which did not differentiate presynaptic receptors from postsynaptic ones in the rabbit or rat heart.", 
    "15": "The development of receptor-specific ligands, radiolabelled to high specific activity has made possible the investigation of the binding of anti-muscarinic compounds to the muscarinic receptor in vitro. Binding of these compounds satisfies the criteria of saturability, and specificity for the muscarinic receptor, and their potencies for binding correlate with their potencies in inhibiting muscarinic responses in vivo. Whilst analysis of the binding data for 'classical' muscarinic antagonists indicate that they bind to a single, uniform population of binding sites within a given tissue, some anti-muscarinic compounds have been found to bind selectively to receptors in different tissues. Furthermore, pirenzepine binding in some preparations deviates from simple mass action behaviour indicating that it recognizes subclasses of receptors within tissues. The pharmacological profile of selective anti-muscarinic compounds compares well with their behaviour in binding studies and indicates that such studies can provide a simple and rapid primary screen for anti-muscarinic action of newly synthesised drugs.", 
    "16": "Gastric cytoprotective effects of vagotomy, PGE2 and antimuscarinic compounds (pirenzepine, atropine) were studied in the rat. Both pharmacological and surgical treatment prevented the gastric damage induced by intragastric administration of acetylsalicylic acid plus hydrochloric acid. The mechanisms of action are discussed.", 
    "17": "This study compared the effects of pirenzepine, a novel selective antimuscarinic agent, and PGE2 applied topically on the gastric mucosa or parenterally on gastric secretion and formation of ASA and ethanol-induced gastric ulcerations in rats. Pirenzepine given topically in nonantisecretory dose prevented the formation of gastric ulcerations induced by ASA + 0.15 M HCl and absolute ethanol. These cytoprotective effects were comparable to those observed after PGE2 administered intragastrically or subcutaneously. Pirenzepine did not affect ulcer formation by ASA combined with 0.30 M HCl, whereas PGE2 was fully effective under these conditions. The cytoprotective action of pirenzepine was not accompanied by any change in the mucosal generation of PGs, indicating that endogenous PGs do not contribute to the cytoprotective property of this agent.", 
    "18": "Long term pirenzepine treatment of duodenal ulcer patients was carried out. Full dose pirenzepine therapy (100 mg/day) for 28 days resulted in 34 (77%) out of 44 duodenal ulcer patients with endoscopically healed lesions. Sixteen of them, randomly chosen, were treated with low pirenzepine doses (50 mg/day) for 6 months with evidence of clinical and endoscopic ulcer relapse in 3 cases (18.7%); while in 16 subjects who interrupted the treatment completely, evidence of clinical recurrence in 11 (68.7%) and of endoscopic recurrence in 10 (62.5%) within the following six months. The statistical analysis failed to reveal significant differences between treated and not treated patients. These data were compared with what observed after interruption of treatment in 16 patients whose duodenal ulcer previously healed after 28 days of antacid therapy. Clinical ulcer recurrence in up to 6 months were shown in 9 (56.2%) of them, and endoscopic relapses were shown in 7 (43.7%). In conclusion, the maintenance therapy with low doses of pirenzepine reduces the number of ulcer relapses when compared with pirenzepine withdrawal or with antacid withdrawal, even though this difference is not statistically significant.", 
    "19": "In a randomized, controlled multicenter-study 126 patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer were treated with 100 mg Pirenzepine daily and 128 patients with 1000 mg Cimetidine daily. Endoscopic evaluation was done by an independent endoscopist after four weeks. At this time 64.3% of the Pirenzepine-treated patients and 73.4% of the patients on Cimetidine had the ulcer healed. The chi-square value of 2.48 indicates that the difference was not statistically significant, that Pirenzepine is equally or at least not essentially less effective than Cimetidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcer. Pain relief was good in both groups with a trend in favour of Cimetidine. Side effects were seldom, mild and reversible.", 
    "20": "The effect of pirenzepine on esophageal motility was studied in ten healthy volunteers by manometry. Pirenzepine reduces lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), amplitude, and duration of esophageal contractions, but it increases velocity of propagation of esophageal contractions. On the other hand, it is known that pirenzepine inhibits gastric acid secretion. Therefore, the reduction of contractile force in the esophagus caused by pirenzepine does not necessarily mean an increased risk of peptic gastroesophageal reflux.", 
    "21": "This report tests in men the effect of Pirenzepine on L-Amino acids stimulated gastric secretion and serum gastrin levels in order to evaluate the true antimuscarinic selective properties of this drug. Since L-Amino acids given intravenously stimulate gastric acid secretion by a mechanism of action selective on the cholinergic receptors of the gastric parietal cells, not mediated through the vagus nerve, gastrin or other gut hormones. Pirenzepine should be an L-Amino acids antagonist as far as the gastric acid secretion is concerned. By confirming this presumed antagonism between Pirenzepine and L-Amino acids given intravenously, this report points out in men the selective antimuscarinic effect of this anti ulcer drug on the high affinity muscarinic receptors of the gastric parietal cells. Finally a decrease in gastrin serum levels was observed after the i.v. administration of Pirenzepine and this could be explained by a possible effect of blockade of this drug on the cholinergic receptors of the antral G cells, but these data need further experimental confirm. Attention is then paid to the different mechanism of action between Pirenzepine, H2 receptors antagonist drugs and other anti ulcer drugs on healing gastric or duodenal peptic ulcers.", 
    "22": "50 mg pirenzepine inhibit basal acid secretion by 39.9% and peptone-stimulated acid output by 21.3%. The percentage of inhibition is nearly doubled if the same dose is given after a treatment with 50 mg pirenzepine twice daily for 3 to 7 days. No acute effect on serum gastrin levels can be demonstrated by a single dose of pirenzepine. After pretreatment only a small increase of basal gastrin levels is observed, serum gastrin does not change during stimulation. On the bases of these results the effect on ulcer healing by high doses of pirenzepine is probably due to a much more pronounced acid inhibition. One reason for stronger inhibition of acid secretion after pretreatment with pirenzepine is probably accumulation of the drug, other reasons may be distribution space or receptor binding. The effect of anticholinergic drugs on serum gastrin concentrations is probably dose-dependent.", 
    "23": "H2-receptor-antagonists inhibit pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion for a longer period than basal secretion. Anticholinergic drugs and pirenzepine are less effective and act differently by reduction of volume. Acid concentration is reduced to 95% by cimetidine compared to 20% by atropine and pirenzepine. By increasing electrical vagal stimulation there is a decreasing effect of cimetidine. In contrast, atropine and pirenzepine inhibit vagally transmitted acid secretion by about 45%, even when vagally stimulated acid secretion amounts to more than 50% of the pentagastrin-stimulated secretion. These results support the hypothesis of histaminergic and cholinergic receptors in man.", 
    "24": "Modified sham feeding by the chew and spit technique stimulates gastric acid secretion at a level about 50% of peak acid output. This response is vagal and can be totally blocked by vagotomy. The effect on the acid response to modified sham feeding produced by a quaternary amine, benzilonium bromide, and a presumably more selectively acting antimuscarinic drug, pirenzepine, was compared. The drugs were given 45 min and 10 min before the start of the sham feeding, respectively. Benzilonium bromide, 1 + 1 mg, blocked 73% of the acid response to sham feeding and pirenzepine, 10 + 10 mg, blocked 48% of the response. The difference was not statistically significant. The data confirm that a part, about one third, of the acid response to sham feeding is non-cholinergic, although it is vagal.", 
    "25": "Pirenzepine is a new antimuscarinic drug with a peculiar affinity for gastric parietal cells' acetylcholine receptors. Previously it has been shown that the drug effectively inhibits both basal and gastric acid secretion stimulated by several secretagogues. The aim of the present work has been to evaluate, in double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized studies on 6 male patients, the effect of pirenzepine (50 mgs orally) on gastric secretion stimulated by peptone meal, gastric emptying and gastrin release. The results show a significant decrease of gastric secretion (48 per cent in the 1st and 30 per cent in the 2nd hour) without any effect on gastric emptying and gastrin release.", 
    "26": "Pirenzepine (PIR), in contrast to classical antimuscarinic drugs, shows heterogeneity of binding that corresponds with the pharmacological activity: gastric secretion is inhibited by low doses, whereas higher doses are needed to inhibit gastrointestinal motility. This study investigated the effects of oral PIR on gastric emptying and antral motor activity. 20 healthy men (mean age 24.9 yr) participated in two experimental sessions, one week apart. According to a cross-over double blind design they received, three and a half days prior to the studies, either 50 mg PIR twice daily or placebo (PLA). A semisolid test meal labelled with 150 MBq 99mTc hSA was administered. A gamma camera coupled to a computer monitored modulation depth (MD), frequency (FR), and propagation velocity (PV) of antral contractions together with gastric emptying rate (GE) according to a modification of Akkerman's technique. PIR decreased MD (PLA: 21.2 +/- 1.7 SEM%; PIR: 17.2 +/- 1.5%; P less than 0.005) and increased FR (PLA: 3.12 +/- 0.05 cycles/min; PIR: 3.29 +/- 0.07 c/min; P less than 0.005) significantly whereas PV was accelerated (PLA: 2.9 +/- 0.2 mm/sec; PIR: 3.1 +/- 0.3 mm/sec; n.s.) and GE delayed only slightly (PLA: 50.4 +/- 8.5 kcpm; PIR: 35.5 +/- 6.0 kcpm; n.s.). PIR produced more frequent stools in three and accommodation difficulties and a dry mouth in each two subjects. PLA caused no side effects.", 
    "27": "PIR delays GE insignificantly despite of considerable effects on antral motility.", 
    "28": "The present study was performed to investigate the correlation between gastric H-ion-concentration and interdigestive motility (1) under basal conditions and (2) under the influence of pirenzepine, atropine and cimetidine. During the control period 6.5 (DZ1 5, DZ9 12) MMC's per 12-hour periods (69 +/- 7% gastrointestinal MMC's) were recorded. After administration of pirenzepine and the combination of pirenzepine and cimetidine almost exclusively gastrointestinal MMC's could be identified. On the other hand, atropine did not change the gastrointestinal/intestinal MMC ratio, but reduced total number of MMC's significancy (p less than 0.05). Percentage of observation time with antral pH greater than 4 was significantly increased by the combination of pirenzepine and cimetidine, but not by pirenzepine or cimetidine alone nor by atropine. There was a positive correlation between interdigestive cycle-length and percentage of time with antral pH greater than 4. The effect of pirenzepine on interdigestive motility (1) seems not to be mediated by the inhibition of gastric acid and (2) is different from the effect of atropine.", 
    "29": "The effect of two dose-schedules of Pirenzepine (25 mg b.d. or 50 mg t.d.s. during 2 1/2 days) on histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion was tested in eleven healthy volunteers. Gastric secretory responses were calculated as acid output values and as VG-values (VG = gastric secretory volume corrected for duodeno-gastric reflux and pyloric loss). Stimulated acid output per two hours was reduced with Pirenzepine 25 mg b.d. by 12.5% (n.s.), with Pirenzepine 50 mg t.d.s. by 21% (p less than 0.01). Stimulated VG per two hours was reduced with Pirenzepine 25 mg b.d. by 15.8% (p less than 0.01) and with Pirenzepine 50 mg t.d.s. by 24% (p less than 0.01). Pirenzepine reduces histamine-stimulated gastric acid output to a similar degree as other anticholinergic drugs. Reduction seems to be due to true inhibition of acid secretion and not to altered gastric motility.", 
    "30": "It is known, that Pirenzepine inhibits basal, pentagastrin-, insulin- and peptone-stimulated gastric secretion. In this study the effect of three different doses of Pirenzepine was studied on acid secretion stimulated by modified shamfeeding (MSF). Each of eleven healthy volunteers underwent four secretion tests after pre-treatment for 4 days in random order by: no drug, tablets Pirenzepine 25 mg b.i.d., 50 mg b.i.d., or 50 mg t.d.s. Basal acid output 0-30' was reduced by 48%, 59% and 66% respectively and stimulated acid output 0-120' by 45%, 58% and 48% respectively. When acid secretion was calculated as volume corrected for duodeno-gastric reflux and pyloric losses the corresponding figures were 33.7%, 36.3% and 42.6%. Inhibition of MSF-stimulated acid secretion by a high dose of Pirenzepine was not complete. Pirenzepine 50 mg b.i.d. seems to be a suitable dose for clinical use, as acid reduction is as good as with 50 mg t.d.s. and side-effects are known to be less.", 
    "31": "Pirenzepine exerted a powerful inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion from both the gastric fistula and the Heidenhain pouch of the dog, following intravenous infusion of bombesin. Similar results were obtained from the Heidenhain pouch when hypersecretion was stimulated by the meal test. The rise in plasma levels of radioimmunological gastrin, obtained by either bombesin or food administration, was not significantly affected by pirenzepine. The overall results indicate that the inhibitory effect of pirenzepine on gastric acid secretion in the dog was independent from the release of endogenous gastrin.", 
    "32": "The influence of food intake and of age on the kinetics of nitrazepam was examined in eight young and eight elderly healthy volunteers after single-dose administration of the drug. Serial blood samples were obtained during 0-24 hr, and the serum concentrations of nitrazepam were determined by gas chromatography. Concomitant food intake had no apparent influence on the absorption rate or on the bioavailability of nitrazepam in the young subjects, and there was no significant difference in nitrazepam kinetics between young and elderly subjects. Accordingly, nitrazepam may be taken together with food as well as on an empty stomach, at least in young subjects, and the increased nitrazepam sensitivity often seen in elderly subjects does not seem secondary to age-dependent pharmacokinetic differences.", 
    "33": "Gastric secretory functions and plasma gastrin levels in rats after the prolonged treatment of pirenzepine 2HCl were evaluated. Pirenzepine 2HCl at 100 mg/kg was given p.o. twice daily for 4 weeks. Control animals were given saline alone. The test agent potently inhibited gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats and fistula rats stimulated with pentagastrin and histamine before and after cessation of 4 weeks' treatment. At 1 day after the treatment, the acid output slightly decreased in pylorus-ligated rats and significantly decreased in fistula rats stimulated with secretagogues. At 3 days, the acid output was slightly increased in pylorus-ligated rats and significantly increased in fistula rats stimulated with pentagastrin but was unchanged in the case of histamine stimulation. At 10 days, the gastric secretion in pylorus-ligated rats tended to increase but the acid output in fistula rats was not affected. Pirenzepine 2HCl increased the plasma gastrin levels in normal rats and at 1 day after the treatment, but had no effects at 3 and 10 days. Propantheline Br showed much the same results as seen with pirenzepine 2HCl. Cessation of prolonged treatment with pirenzepine 2HCl appears to increase only slightly and transiently the sensitivity of gastric secretory cells.",

There is to date no information whether the drug combinations midazolam/fentanyl, benzoctamine/buprenorphine and etomidate/carticaine may act as central anticholinergic agents.", 
    "35": "In gross behavioral observation the minimum effective dose of zopiclone was intravenously 0.06-0.25 mg/kg and intragastrically 1-4 mg/kg in rhesus monkeys. Zopiclone suppressed barbital withdrawal signs of rhesus monkeys at a single dose of 16 mg/kg or more. The suppressing effect of zopiclone 32 mg/kg i.g. was comparable to diazepam 8 mg/kg. Crab-eating monkeys treated with zopiclone at doses up to 32 mg/kg twice daily for up to 8 weeks manifested intermediate-grade signs upon withdrawal (i.e., less severe than after treatment with diazepam and similar to nitrazepam). Zopiclone was self-administered by rhesus monkeys relatively frequently by the intravenous route; the infrequent intragastric rate was similar to or slightly higher than with diazepam.",

    "38": "Since cocaine or diazepam are used clinically and/or abused concomitantly with narcotics, this study was designed to determine if morphine-dependent, morphine-withdrawn, or acute morphine rats exhibit an altered core body temperature at 24 or 4 degrees C to either cocaine (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg i.p.) or diazepam (2 or 4 mg/kg i.p.). At 24 degrees C, each dose of cocaine manifested hyperthermia in all groups of rats except morphine-dependent whereas at 4 degrees C cocaine produced hypothermia in all groups except morphine-dependent. At both 24 and 4 degrees C, diazepam, 2 or 4 mg/kg, caused a hypothermic response in control, dependent, and withdrawn animals. At 24 degrees C, administration of acute morphine alone induced a hyperthermia which was antagonized by both doses of diazepam. At 4 degrees C, acute morphine alone induced an initial hypothermia followed by a hyperthermia; both doses of diazepam potentiated the hypothermic response to acute morphine. Thus, significant alterations in core body temperature may be induced following the administration of cocaine or diazepam to morphine-treated rats.", 
    "39": "1. The patient population consisting of fifteen patients was divided into three groups, namely: diazepam group, phenobarbital group and placebo group. After three weeks the medicated groups were switched to placebo for a week and the placebo group was given phenobarbital. 2. The parameters to be assessed once a week comprised frequency-analyzed EEG recordings, performance in two attention tests and subjectively estimated mood modalities. 3. The EEG analysis suggested that EEG patterns: a) were drug-dependent, with a differential distribution for each drug of the four frequency bands analyzed; b) showed no change during the three-week treatment period; c) changed on cessation of medication or on switch from placebo to active medication; d) were task-dependent and changed in a systematic way with the level of activation (stress, vigilance or relaxation). 4. The results would allow a better understanding of the clinical course, the choice of therapeutic measures and of the underlying mechanisms of action.", 
    "40": "1. The behavioural effects of hashish extract (10 mg delta 9-THC/kg) were compared to those of morphine (20 mg/kg), diazepam (10 mg/kg), imipramine (10/kg), amphetamine (10 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg) by testing male mice in a resident-intruder situation. 2. The drugs were given either to the resident or to the intruder male. 3. Hashish extract similar to diazepam and chlorpromazine reduced social activities in resident and intruder males. 4. Intruder males treated with hashish or diazepam were more frequently attacked and submission and light was increased. 5. Amphetamine and morphine stimulated locomotion and non-social activities but impaired social behaviour especially in residents. 6. Imipramine increased aggressive behaviour in resident and intruder males.", 
    "41": "1. Intravenous clonazepam was investigated in an open trial conducted in 24 patients suffering from status epilepticus. 2. The administration of 1-2 mg clonazepam resulted in the complete control of 7/7 Petit Mal, 7/14 Grand Mal and 2/3 partial complex cases. 3. The mean time to obtain clinical control of seizures after injection was 1.75 min. In all successfully treated cases normalization or improvement of the post-ictal EEG tracing was observed. 4. Vital signs measured before and immediately after clonazepam injections showed no clinically significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate or respiration. Side effects consisted exclusively of transient mild to moderate drowsiness in 40% of patients. 5. These results indicate that intravenous clonazepam is rapidly effective and safe in the treatment of Petit Mal status and in certain cases of Grand Mal and partial complex status epilepticus. This agent therefore represents a useful alternative to diazepam in the treatment of status epilepticus.", 
    "42": "A modified hyponeophagia test is described as an animal model of anxiety. The effects of 0, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 and 10 mg/kg diazepam, given both acutely and for 7 days pretest, were assessed in rats. Acutely, diazepam reduced hyponeophagia over the dose range 0.3-3.0 mg/kg but 10.0 mg/kg produced sedation and large variability. Chronically, the dose-response relationships were monotonic and the maximal effect was increased, suggesting that differential tolerance occurs to the sedative, but not to the anxiolytic, effects of this drug. Increased food deprivation did not mimic benzodiazepine effects on hyponeophagia, and actually prolonged eating latency in rats treated with 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (2.5 mg/kg), which does not support an interpretation of diazepam effects in terms of appetitive actions. An arousal hypothesis of hyponeophagia was proposed and supported by the antagonism of the sedative effects of 10.0 mg/kg diazepam by d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). Although both male and female rats were used throughout, sex differences were few in these studies.", 
    "43": "In the present study the effects of chronic treatment of pregnant rats with diazepam on the physical and behavioral development of their offspring were investigated. Rats that were diazepam-exposed prenatally were compared to age-matched controls in terms of the following: number of littermates; birth weight and weight gain until weaning: motor development and coordination; simple motor learning; open field activity; performance on learning tasks of varying complexity; retention of these tasks. Nulliparous Wistar rats were injected s.c. for 16 days of their pregnancy was either 2.5, 5, of 10 mg/kg diazepam or an equal volume of vehicle. Prenatal diazepam treatment did not alter litter size, birth weight, or the righting reflex, but seemed to retard early motor development transiently. Diazepam pups showed longer latencies and less rearing in the open field. There were no differences between animals exposed to drug and vehicle in simple motor learning or in acquiring a simple successive discrimination task. However, there were significant dose-dependent differences on a complex six-choice simultaneous discrimination learning task, the diazepam-exposed rats making more errors and taking more time to reach the goal. A significant difference was seen again between diazepam- and vehicle-exposed rats on the retention test 10 days later. The results indicate that diazepam administered to pregnant rats has long-range effects on the behavior of the offspring, some becoming manifest even in maturity.", 
    "44": "The effects of three monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) on performance under a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-s schedule (DRL 72-s) for water reinforcement were determined. All three drugs (isocarboxazid, iproniazid, phenelzine) reduced response rate and increased reinforcement rate in rats performing under the DRL schedule. Drugs from other classes (alcohol, chlordiazepoxide, morphine, pentobarbital) did not produce similar effects. The ability of MAOI to increase reinforcement rate under a DRL 72-s schedule is similar to that recently reported for tricyclic antidepressants and the two atypical antidepressants mianserin and iprindole. These findings support the contention that the DRL schedule may be useful as a test for identifying new antidepressants and for elucidating the neurochemical effects of antidepressants that are responsible for their therapeutic actions.", 
    "45": "In 11 preoperative women, plasma adrenaline (A) concentrations were lower after oral administration of an antianxiety dose (19.25 micrograms/kg) of chlordemethyldiazepam (Cl-DMDZ) than the predrug values, or those in 12 patients given placebo. No significant differences in supine plasma noradrenaline (NA), blood pressure (BP) and heart rate values were observed. Digital plethysmography showed finger vasoconstriction after placebo and vasodilatation after Cl-DMDZ. A mental arithmetic test caused equivalent rises in plasma A in both groups. Standing caused plasma NA to rise to similar levels in both groups of patients, but the BP decrease was less and there was a markedly lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension in the Cl-DMDZ treated group. It is concluded that the effect of Cl-DMDZ on the release of catecholamines from the peripheral sympathetic system consists essentially of decreasing basal adrenomedullary activity. CL-DMDZ appears to prevent the orthostatic hypotension which occurs when neurosympathetic reflex activation is normal.", 
    "46": "Male rats of two lines of rats psychogenetically selected and bred for extremes in performance in shuttle box avoidance received an acute IP injection of chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/kg), imipramine HCl (IMI: 0.33, 1.0, or 3.0 mg/kg), or vehicle. The rats were placed, 35 min after injection, in an enclosed maze with either a simple configuration with an unilluminated central arena or a complex configuration with a brightly illuminated central arena, and spontaneous maze patrolling was evaluated. Total locomotor activity during the 6-min maze test was significantly reduced by 5--10 mg/kg CDP for both RHA/Verh and RLA/Verh lines of rats in both the simple and the complex maze configurations. Treatment with 10 mg/kg CDP reduced the total explored area for both rat lines in both maze configurations. In addition, the maze area explored by RHA/Verh rats was also reduced by 5.0 mg/kg CDP for the simple configuration and by 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg CDP for the complex configuration. Entry into the unilluminated central field of the simple maze was reduced by 5--10 mg/kg CDP only in RHA/Verh rats. In contrast, 2.5 mg/kg CDP significantly increased entry into the brightly illuminated central arena of the complex maze for the RLA/Verh rats. The doses of IMI used were without effect on the parameters of maze patrolling behavior evaluated, with the single exception that the locomotor activity of RHA/Verh rats tested in the simple maze configuration was decreased by 3.0 mg/kg IMI. The results indicate that, although the effects of CDP were generally similar for total activity and the area explored in the two psychogenetic lines investigated, there was a qualitative difference in its effect on entry into an illuminated arena.", 
    "47": "Chlordiazepoxide and two serotonin receptor antagonists showed opposite effects when tested for their influence on morphine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Chlordiazepoxide enhanced morphine-induced hyperactivity, which was antagonized by cyproheptadine and mianserin. The results indicate that the enhancement of morphine-induced locomotor stimulation is not attributable to an antiserotonergic action of the benzodiazepine compound.", 
    "48": "The effects of a single oral dose of 6-azamianserin (2 mg) were compared to those of mianserin (6 mg), flurazepam (10 mg), and placebo in 11 healthy male volunteers, in a crossover design. Quantitative EEG, heart rate, blood pressure, task performance, and subjective state were measured. EEG and behavioral measures distinguished the substances from placebo. 6-Azamianserin was similar to mianserin in type and duration of effects. In a separate study in 12 volunteers, 0.5 and 1.0 mg of the (+) and (-) enantiomers of 6-azamianserin elicited dose-related EEG and behavioral effects, distinguishable from placebo. These effects were similar to those elicited by racemic 6-azamianserin and mianserin. Clinical trials of 6-azamianserin in depressed patients, particularly the elderly and those with cardiovascular disease, are warranted. Dosages selected should be one-third those of mianserin. The stereospecific properties of the enantiomers in preclinical tests predict that any clinical 'antidepressant' activity will reside in the (+) isomer only, while the pharmaco-EEG trials predict that both enantiomers will be clinically 'antidepressant'. Clinical testing of the isomers, particularly the (-) isomer, is indicated as a test of the predictive value of pharmacologic and pharmaco-EEG models of clinical antidepressant activity.", 
    "49": "The anticonvulsant potencies of diazepam and its metabolites desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam against convulsions elicited by intravenous injection of pentetrazole were determined in mice at times from 1-30 min after intravenous administration. Diazepam had its maximal potency (ED50 0.53 mumol/kg) at 1 min when only traces of desmethyldiazepam could be detected in plasma and brain. During the next 30 min, the drug was rapidly transformed to desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam, and its anticonvulsant ED50 rose by a factor of about 4. From the concentrations in brain at 50% protection, a potency ratio of 1.0:0.37:0.33 could be calculated for diazepam, desmethyldiazepam and oxazepam.", 
    "50": "Isoniazid is a useful chemical convulsant in that metabolic events associated with the preseizure state can be easily examined. In the present study, net levels of glucose, glycogen, ATP, and phosphocreatine were measured using enzymatic techniques in control mice, and in those injected with isoniazid. Results from this study showed a differential effect of isoniazid on cells from the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum. In the preseizure stage, the high energy phosphates ATP and phosphocreatine were decreased in layer 1 and the pyramidal cell layer of the cerebral parietal cortex, but were unchanged in the cerebellum. At the onset of seizures, metabolites were decreased not only in cortical layers, but in the molecular layer and Purkinje cell rich layer of the cerebellum as well. The somewhat delayed response of the cerebellum emphasizes the differential nature of metabolism in various brain regions. Such a delay in cerebellar energy response to perturbation may be conducive to the seizure state. In another series of mice, either sodium valproate or clonazepam was administered prior to isoniazid, and metabolite studies repeated. Results showed that at a time when each anticonvulsant acted to eliminate overt seizure activity, the reduction in ATP and phosphocreatine was not as great as it was in seizing mice treated with isoniazid alone.", 
    "51": "The responses to tests of auditory lateralization and temporal order to the administration of desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) and of chlorodesmethyldiazepam (Cl-DMDZ) have been investigated. Therapeutic doses of these two benzodiazepines were used. We have tested four groups of 10 healthy normally hearing subjects. It was demonstrated that both DMDZ and Cl-DMDZ cause a temporary disturbance in the lateralization tests: delta i but especially delta t. The temporal order test is not altered after drug administration. The physiopathological and topodiagnostic value of these tests and the site of action of the benzodiazepines are discussed.", 
    "52": "Changes in rat ambulatory activity and muscle tone after diazepam treatments (2.5, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg orally) were compared under single and repeated (for 2, 4, 7, and 14 days) administration schedules. Ambulatory activity in the open field test was enhanced by a single dose of 2.5 mg/kg and reduced by 20 mg/kg. However, after all repeated treatment schedules, diazepam resulted in dose-dependent elevations of activity. Even with a treatment period of only 2 days, 20 mg/kg diazepam produced a marked increase in ambulation, which became more conspicuous with increases in the treatment periods. Acutely administered diazepam produced a dose-dependent reduction in muscle tone, but tolerance was noted to this effect during repeated administrations. Thus, time- and dose-dependent increases in ambulation during repeated treatments with diazepam can be partially explained by time-dependent tolerance development to its muscle relaxant effects. The enhancement in ambulation after short-term repetitive dosings of benzodiazepines can be used as a simple indicator for detecting their disinhibitory potentials.", 
    "53": "The means by which diazepam alters the social behavior of male LAC mice was investigated by analyzing 6-min dyadic social encounters between untreated, individually housed resident males and experimentally manipulated, group-housed intruders. Experiment 1 showed that at 24h and particularly 14 days after access to 0.125 mM diazepam solution, drugged intruders were attacked more when placed into a resident's home cage than were intruders receiving vehicle. After 24h, but not 14 days of treatment, drugged intruders performed fewer elements of static flight. However, on both occasions they showed proportionally less flight behavior relative to the amount of aggression residents directed towards them. In experiment 2, intruders marked with mouse urine taken from donors which had ingested the 0.125 mM diazepam solution for 24 h were attacked considerably more by residents than were intruders marked with water or normal mouse urine. Urine samples taken after 14 days of drug treatment evoked additional increases in sexual and investigatory elements in unmarked residents. The results show that, in pairs of mice, the rise in aggression associated with sustained diazepam treatment, unlike the changes in flight, arises indirectly and probably through a drug-induced change in the olfactory properties of mouse urine.", 
    "54": "The plasma profile of a single oral dose of pinazepam 10 mg was studied in 6 healthy male volunteers, aged 26 to 31 years. The concentrations of the parent compound and of its metabolite in plasma were measured by gas-chromatography. The peak plasma levels of pinazepam was 36.8 +/- 5.1 ng/ml and of N-desmethyldiazepam 150 +/- 13.3 ng/ml. The plasma concentration of the metabolite become higher than that of the parent compound shortly after administration, suggesting that pinazepam acts as a prodrug.", 
    "55": "Unilateral intranigral administration of baclofen (50-200 ng), muscimol (2.5--20 ng), or THIP (50--400 ng) in the rat led to contralateral circling behavior of a qualitatively similar nature. The potency of all three GABA-mimetics was enhanced in animals which had received the depot neuroleptic fluphenazine decanoate (10 mg/kg SC) 7 days prior to their intranigral administration. Significant differences between the nigral actions of the drugs could be demonstrated by their altered activity in the presence of a benzodiazepine. Flurazepam (500 ng) enhanced the intranigral potency of THIP, but reduced that of intranigral baclofen. Muscimol-induced circling behavior was unaffected by concomitant flurazepam. The data provide evidence for a functional supersensitivity of GABA-sensitive nondopaminergic projections from the substantia nigra in response to chronic neuroleptic treatment and reveal differences between the precise sites or modes of action of baclofen, muscimol, and THIP within this structure.", 
    "56": "Diazepam, an anxiolytic, was administered to 16 undergraduate volunteers in a double-blind design. Eight subjects were selected to be high in State and Trait anxiety and were slow in recall on a semantic memory task compared to non-anxious subjects. Instead of alleviating this detrimental effect of anxiety on memory, diazepam slowed recall in both the anxious and non-anxious.", 
    "57": "The effect of pirenzepine, a muscarinic receptor blocker which does not cross the blood brain barrier, on basal and TRH-stimulated prolactin (PRL) secretion in normal subjects was studied. Administration of 75 mg oral pirenzepine had no effects on prolactin levels in male subjects whereas it significantly reduced prolactin in females. No effect on TRH induced prolactin secretion was observed.", 
    "58": "In 52 studies, performance data were obtained the next day following bedtime ingestion of a sedative-hypnotic or a placebo. Only eight of these studies used insomniac patients. Most studies used young adult males. Benzodiazepine hypnotics were most frequently administered and psychomotor performance was most often measured. Little consistent data are available on cognitive functioning and more complex behavior. Drug-related improvement in performance was not found, and, in comparing active drug to placebo, it is clear that all hypnotics, at some doses, produce decrements in performance the next day. Higher doses consistently showed a decrement, and this decrement was usually persistent over the entire day. Although long-acting drugs generally showed more performance decrement, half-life data were not consistent.", 
    "59": "Pinazepam (P) (10 mg) was orally administered to two young (22-23 years) and two elderly (74-80 years) healthy volunteers. Also, desmethyldiazepam (DD) (10 mg) was orally administered to the same young volunteers on a separate occasion. P was almost completely converted into DD 24 h after administration. Plasma levels of DD were measured in all subjects. In all cases, the DD concentration-time curve showed a biphasic decay (a first slow decay was followed by a fast one) which closely fitted by a Michaelis-Menten equation. Vmax and km constant were computed for all subjects. The kinetic analysis relative to the young subjects showed that T 1/2 of both the slow and fast decay as well as the area under the curve (AUC) were reduced when P was administered instead of DD. Comparison of DD kinetics between young and elderly subjects showed an increase of half-life in the elderly, while AUC was found unchanged.", 
    "60": "Tests of the effect of the new steroid anaesthetic alfadion in the drug Althesin are described. Experiments were carried out in three experimental groups. Intramuscular administration of Althesin to dogs at doses 5 to 15 mg. kg-1 does not induce required anaesthesia. After intravenous administration of Althesin to dogs at a dose of 2 mg. kg-1 after diazepam pre-medication at a dose of 0.25 mg.kg-1 i. m., anaesthesia started without excitations immediately after completed application. Anaesthesia lasted on the average 10 minutes and at the time of recovery excitations and side effects occurred. After intravenous administration of Althesin at a dose of 6 mg. kg-1 with diazepam pre-medication 0.25 mg. kg-1 i.m., the course of narcosis in cats was similar to that in dogs, only its duration was on the average 29 minutes.", 
    "61": "This investigation compares the effects of single and double doses of nitrazepam (5 and 10 mg) and zopiclone (7.5 and 15 mg) and placebo for 1 night in 40 psychiatric patients. The results indicate that zopiclone is an active hypnotic compound, comparable in its effects to those of nitrazepam, the higher dosage being best adapted to the type of patients included in the study.", 
    "62": "A controlled, double-blind study was made of the efficacy and safety of a new hypnotic, zopiclone, on the preoperative night's sleep by a Joint Study Unit Group of the anesthesiology departments in 6 national hospitals. The following results were found: (1) zopiclone 7.5 and 10 mg and nitrazepam 10 mg were significantly superior to placebo both on the quality of sleep and the mental state of the patient, while no significant differences were observed among these three active drugs; (2) a significantly higher incidence of side-effects was observed for nitrazepam 10 mg than for zopiclone 7.5 and 10 mg and placebo; (3) zopiclone 7.5 and 10 mg and also nitrazepam 10 mg were significantly more useful than placebo, and (4) the above results show that 7.5 and 10 mg of zopiclone are of great benefit to the preoperative night's sleep and have less side-effects than 10 mg of nitrazepam.", 
    "63": "A double-blind crossover trial was conducted in 42 outpatients of either sex in order to obtain information on the properties of 7.5 mg of zopiclone in a general practice setting compared with 2 mg of flunitrazepam. Each patient went through two periods of treatment, each period lasting 10 days. A comparison of the effect of the drugs showed a significant difference with regard to effectiveness and sleep latency favoring flunitrazepam. When patient's preferences were analyzed there was a highly significant difference favoring flunitrazepam both for effectiveness and tolerance. The side effects from both drugs were generally mild.", 
    "64": "In a six week, double-blind, predictive, clinical study 224 neurotic and anxious outpatients were randomly assigned to treatment with diazepam (Valium) of placebo and weekly brief psychotherapy administered by experienced psychiatrists. Although diazepam was significantly more effective than placebo for the first week of treatment, it accounted for only 1-4% of the outcome variance, while nonspecific variables contributed 11-22%. After the first revisit and at endpoint, only nonspecific variables accounted for outcome variance ranging from 20 to 26% over the four outcome measures. According to physicians' global and scaled ratings of improvement, diazepam had a treatment advantage (p less than 0.01-0.05) over placebo at the end of the first week of treatment for both the total and completed samples, but not thereafter. According to patients' global ratings of improvement, diazepam was moderately superior (p less than 0.05) to placebo for the total sample only at the end of the first week of treatment and modestly better (p less than 0.10) than placebo for the completed sample on a highly reliable measure of reported anxiety at the same time point. However, patient ratings did not indicate an advantage for diazepam at any of the six points of observation on global ratings of improvement for the completed sample and on reported anxiety for the total sample.", 
    "65": "One hundred and thirty one patients with duodenal ulcer were treated, in a multicentre controlled trial, with pirenzepine (50 mg three times a day for 4 weeks) or with a placebo, using the same schedule. One hundred had clinical examination and endoscopy at the beginning and at the end of the treatment plus a clinical examination at the end of the second week. The number of symptomatic responses and endoscopic healings was significantly greater in patients receiving pirenzepine than in those receiving the placebo. Complete endoscopic healing was achieved in 62% of the treatment group and 30% of controls after 4 weeks. The only detectable side effect was dryness of the mouth (26% in pirenzepine group vs 10% in controls). It is concluded, in view of its minor side effects, that pirenzepine which appears to be a very specific inhibitor of gastric muscarinic receptors provides physicians with a new, safe and effective treatment of peptic ulcer. It appears to be a good alternative to other gastric antisecretory drugs in the management of such patients.", 
    "66": "Eleven patients suffering from chronic insomnia were given 30 mg flurazepam for 28 nights. While EEG measures of total sleep time and sleep efficiency were improved, changes in sleep latency and intermittent waking time were small and nonsignificant. Subjective benefits in sleep were confined to the first 2 nights. There was neither increased nor decreased daytime sleepiness. Cognitive functioning was significantly decreased during the first 2 days, and patients were unaware of these changes. Simple motor tasks were relatively unaffected. Desalkylflurazepam concentrations showed significant accumulation over time, but were not predictive of sleep measures or daytime performance in individual subjects. The withdrawal period was characterized by subjectively disturbed sleep and daytime dysphoria.", 
    "67": "The effectiveness of pirenzepine at 50 mg daily in the treatment of non-ulcer dyspepsia was assessed in a double-blind 4-weeks clinical trial against placebo. 59 patients entered the trial of whom 11 defaulted or were withdrawn. 48 patients completed the trial. Clinical and laboratory assessment were performed on admission to the study and after 4 weeks treatment. The results of this double-blind comparative trial show that pirenzepine in a daily dose of 50 mg is very effective and significantly more effective than placebo in the treatment of non-ulcer dyspepsia.", 
    "68": "Fifty patients (with non-ulcer dyspepsia) were admitted to a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effects of pirenzepine (100 mg/daily) on non-ulcer dyspepsia. Ten patients did not complete the trial. After 4 weeks of treatment, statistically significant improvement (P less than 0.001) was observed endoscopically in the pirenzepine group. The relief of dyspepsia was significantly greater in the pirenzepine-treated group. The tolerability of pirenzepine was good.", 
    "69": "Pirenzepine is a new anticholinergic agent which selectively binds to gastric mucosal muscarinic receptors. We reviewed the double-blind, therapeutic studies on ulcer patients and the clinical pharmacology for evidence of healing and selectivity. Healing rates of ulcer at doses of 100-150 mg/day varied between 54-84% in trials with 718 duodenal ulcer patients and 630 patients with gastric ulcer. Total side effects incidence in these trials was 18.1%. At 150 mg/day, there was 13.5% incidence of dry mouth, 6.3% incidence of visual disturbance and 2.6% incidence of constipation. In clinical pharmacology trials, pirenzepine moderately inhibited gastric secretion with a slight inhibition of salivary secretion and esophageal motility at 100 mg/day. Higher doses produced the expected parasympatholytic profile, except for the absence of cardioacceleration. We conclude that pirenzepine in low doses, compared to classical antimuscarinic drugs, is relatively selective for gastric hyposecretion. It may be associated with a lower frequency of side effects in therapeutic trials at doses of 100-150 mg/day. Dry mouth and visual disturbance are the most common side effects. Selectivity is dose limited and has so far been demonstrated only at a daily dosage of 100 mg, in 2 divided doses.", 
    "70": "The published world literature on the efficacy of pirenzepine, a new anti-muscarinic agent, in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcer is reviewed. In 12 prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled studies pirenzepine was administered to 475 duodenal ulcer patients with an incidence of endoscopically proven healing of 74% when the daily dosage of the drug was 100 or 150 mg but of only 55% if the dosage of the drug was 75 mg or less. In 4 randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies in which 84 patients with gastric ulcer were admitted, the healing rates were similar (50% when daily dosage of pirenzepine was 75 mg or less, 72% when the dosage ranged from 100 to 150 mg). When pirenzepine was compared to carbenoxolone or to cimetidine in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcer respectively, results obtained were comparable. Side-effects reported have been rare and of minor importance. Pirenzepine appears to be an effective drug for the short-term treatment of duodenal ulcer. More data are required for an assessment of short-term therapy of gastric ulcer and long-term maintenance treatment.", 
    "71": "Sixty out-patients with duodenal ulcers that were healed at the end of a 4-week treatment with pirenzepine, cimetidine or placebo were admitted to a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to study the effectiveness of pirenzepine (100 mg/daily) in preventing recurrence of ulcers. Six patients did not complete the trial. After 12 months of treatment 15 of the 26 patients had recurrences in the pirenzepine-treated group and 27 of the 28 in the placebo group. The difference is highly significant (X2 = 9.570, P less than 0.01). The tolerability of pirenzepine was good.", 
    "72": "Thirty-eight of forty patients satisfactorily concluded a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to study the effects of pirenzepine (100 mg/day) on duodenal ulcers. After six weeks of treatment 14 of 18 patients (78%) in the pirenzepine-treated group and 7 of 20 patients (35%) in the placebo groups were healed. There was a statistically significant difference (P less than 0.05). The relief of day-time and night-time pain was significantly greater in the pirenzepine-treated group. Pirenzepine-treated patients consumed significantly fewer antacid tablets. The tolerability of pirenzepine was good. Pirenzepine (100 mg/day for six weeks) should be an effective and safe treatment for duodenal ulcers.", 
    "73": "The effect of pirenzepine and cimetidine on healing, symptoms and relapse rate of duodenal ulcer was studied in a placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Cimetidine (1 g daily) was superior at the beginning of therapy to a low dose of pirenzepine (75 mg daily) and placebo with regard to symptoms. No significant differences in ulcer healing were found between the 3 groups of treatment. The relapse rate after treatment with pirenzepine was lower than after treatment with cimetidine.", 
    "74": "The effect of increasing doses of pirenzepine, a tricyclic compound and new antiulcer drug, on meal-induced gastric acid secretion, gastrin release and gastric emptying of the liquid meal, was investigated in eight healthy volunteers. Gastric acid secretion was assessed using intragastric titration technique. Intra-muscularly administered doses of pirenzepine tested were 0 (placebo), 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 mg.kg-1. With increasing doses of pirenzepine a dose-related reduction of meal-stimulated acid response was noticed amounting to 53% of control values with the highest dosage. The IC 50 value is close to 200 ng.ml-1. Initial but not total gastric emptying of the liquid protein-meal was slowed by 0.5 mg.kg-1 pirenzepine dose. Gastrin responses to the meal were reduced in a dose dependent manner although to a lesser degree.", 
    "75": "In this report I briefly review the neural mechanisms of gastric acid secretion in man focussing particularly on muscarinic control of the oxyntic glands and the G-cells during the cephalic and gastric phases. Cephalic phase which is mediated by vagal nerves appears to be almost entirely due to cholinergic activation of the oxyntic glands without significant role of vagally released gastrin. Distention, which is a major component of gastric phase activates cholinergic reflexes with afferents to both oxyntic glands and the G-cells. Using highly selective antimuscarinic agent, pirenzepine, the evidence is presented that gastrin release during vagal activation or gastric distention is exerted by cholinergic transmission without involvement of cholinergic inhibitory pathway suggested previously.

    "76": "The efficacy of diazepam suppositories as sedatives was investigated in anxious patients with defined advanced malignant disease. Twenty-four patients, age range 54 to 89 years (mean 72 years) with a mean weight of 52 kg, were randomly allocated 5 mg or 10 mg diazepam suppositories for 5 nights each in a crossover fashion, with a 2-day drug-free washout period in between. Sleep was rated daily as 'well', 'same' or 'badly' by the night nurse and by the patient. The majority of patients slept well while taking diazepam, with no apparent difference between the two doses. The most common side-effects reported were day-time drowsiness (58% of patients), dry mouth (29%) and amnesia (21%). No adverse reaction necessitated premature withdrawal from the study. Results indicated that diazepam suppositories were well tolerated and appeared to provide effective night-time sedation in anxious patients with terminal cancer."
