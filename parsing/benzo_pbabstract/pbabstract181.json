    "0": "Mitochondrial permeability transition pore plays an important role in the processes of cell apoptosis and necrosis. The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, a mitochondria outer-membrane protein, is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition. In the present study, we test if PK11195, a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, can lead to the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores, and subsequently causes mitochondria cytochrome c loss and mitochondria uncoupling. In isolated cardiac mitochondria, PK11195 (50, 100, 200 microM) caused a dose-dependent mitochondrial swelling, cytochrome c loss, and the dissipation of mitochondrial potential. Cyclosporin A (0.2 microM), a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition, completely prevented the mitochondrial swelling induced by PK11195, and maintained the cytochrome c content and membrane potential. These data suggest that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, PK11195 caused mitochondrial uncoupling and cytochrome c loss via induction of mitochondrial permeability transition.", 
    "1": "The current first line treatment of status epilepticus (SE) is based on the use of compounds that enhance GABAergic transmission or block sodium channels. These treatments discontinue SE in only two-thirds of patients, and therefore new therapeutic approaches are needed. We investigated whether a novel water-soluble AMPA antagonist, NS1209, discontinues SE in adult rats. SE was induced by electrical stimulation of the amygdala or subcutaneous administration of kainic acid. Animals were monitored continuously with video-electroencephalography during SE and drug treatment. We found that NS1209 could be safely administered to rats undergoing electrically induced SE at doses up to 50mg/kg followed by intravenous infusion of 5mg/kg for up to 24h. NS1209 administered as a bolus dose of 10-50mg/kg (i.p. or i.v.) followed by infusion of 4 or 5mg/kg h (i.v.) for 2-24h effectively discontinued electrically induced SE in all animals within 30-60 min, and there was no recurrence of SE after a 24-h infusion. Kainate-induced SE was similarly blocked by 10 or 30 mg/kg NS1209 (i.v.). To compare the efficacy and neuroprotective effects of NS1209 with those of diazepam (DZP), one group of rats received DZP (20mg/kg, i.p. and another dose of 10 mg/kg 6h later). By using the administration protocols described, the anticonvulsant effect of NS1209 was faster and more complete than that of DZP. NS1209 treatment (20 mg/kg bolus followed by 5mg/kg h infusion for 24 h) was neuroprotective against SE-induced hippocampal neurodegeneration, but to a lesser extent than DZP. These findings suggest that AMPA receptor blockade by NS1209 provides a novel and mechanistically complimentary addition to the armamentarium of drugs used to treat SE in humans.", 
    "2": "Lavender is a popular treatment for stress and mild anxiety in Europe and the USA. The present study investigated the effects of (Lavandula angustifolia Mill. (Lamiaceae)) lavender odour inhalation over 2 weeks or 24 h periods, on gerbil behaviour in the elevated plus maze in mature male and female gerbils, and compared results with the effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg) i.p. after 30 min and 2-week administration. Traditional measures of open entries showed an increasing trend over the 2 weeks exposure, whereas ethological measures indicative of anxiety; stretch-attend frequency and percentage protected head-dips, were significantly lower. Exploratory behaviour, total head-dip frequency, increased after 24 h lavender and 2 weeks exposure. These results are comparable with diazepam administration. There were sex differences in protected head-dip an ethological indicator of anxiety: females showed a significant decrease in protected head-dips compared to both males and to female controls. In conclusion exposure to lavender odour may have an anxiolytic profile in gerbils similar to that of the anxiolytic diazepam. In addition, prolonged, 2-week lavender odour exposure increased exploratory behaviour in females indicating a further decrease in anxiety in this sex.", 
    "3": "Current treatment of nerve agent poisoning consists of prophylactic administration of pyridostigmine and therapy using atropine, an oxime and a benzodiazepine. Pyridostigmine does however not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier giving ineffective protection of the brain against centrally mediated seizure activity. In this study, we have evaluated donepezil hydrochloride, a partial reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) clinically used for treating Alzheimer's disease, in combination with procyclidine, used in treatment of Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, as prophylaxis against intoxication by the nerve agent soman. The results demonstrated significant protective efficacy of donepezil (2.5 mg/kg) combined with procyclidine (3 or 6 mg/kg) when given prophylactically against a lethal dose of soman (1.6 x LD(50)) in Wistar rats. No neuropathological changes were found in rats treated with this combination 48 h after soman intoxication. Six hours after soman exposure cerebral AChE activity and acetylcholine (ACh) concentration was 5% and 188% of control, respectively. The ACh concentration had returned to basal levels 24 h after soman intoxication, while AChE activity had recovered to 20% of control. Loss of functioning muscarinic ACh receptors (17%) but not nicotinic receptors was evident at this time point. The recovery in brain AChE activity seen in our study may be due to the reversible binding of donepezil to the enzyme. Donepezil is well tolerated in humans, and a combination of donepezil and procyclidine may prove useful as an alternative to the currently used prophylaxis against nerve agent intoxication.", 
    "4": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a life-threatening neurological disorder associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Benzodiazepines are the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of SE. Despite aggressive treatment, over 40% of SE cases are refractory to the initial treatment with two or more medications. It would be a major advance in the clinical management of SE to identify novel anticonvulsant agents that do not lose their ability to treat SE with increasing seizure duration. Cannabinoids have recently been demonstrated to regulate seizure activity in brain. However, it remains to be seen whether they develop pharmacoresistance upon prolonged SE. In this study, we used low Mg(2+) to induce SE in hippocampal neuronal cultures and in agreement with animal models and human SE confirm the development of resistance to benzodiazepine with increasing durations of SE. Thus, lorazepam (1 microM) was effective in blocking low Mg(2+) induced high-frequency spiking for up to 30 min into SE. However, by 1 h and 2 h of SE onset it was only 10-15% effective in suppressing SE. In contrast, the cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptor agonist, WIN 55,212-2 (1 microM) in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner completely abolished SE at all the time points tested even out to 2 h after SE onset, a condition where resistance developed to lorazepam. Thus, the use of cannabinoids in the treatment of SE may offer a unique approach to controlling SE without the development of pharmacoresistance observed with conventional treatments.", 
    "5": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of some H(1)-antagonists on the sleep-wake cycle in sleep-disturbed rats in comparison with those of nitrazepam. Electrodes were chronically implanted into the frontal cortex and the dorsal neck muscle of rats for the electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG), respectively. EEG and EMG were recorded with an electroencephalograph. SleepSign ver. 2.0 was used for EEG and EMG analysis. The total times of waking, non-rapid eye movement (non-REM), and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep were measured from 10:00 to 16:00. Nitrazepam showed a significant decrease in sleep latency, total waking time, and delta activity and an increase in the total non-REM sleep time. A significant decrease in the sleep latency was observed with diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and cyproheptadine. Cyproheptadine also caused a significant decrease in the total waking time and increases in total non-REM sleep time, REM sleep time, slow wave sleep, and delta activity, although no remarkable effects were observed with diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. In conclusion, cyproheptadine can be useful as a hypnotic, having not only sleep inducing-effects, but also sleep quantity- and quality-increasing effects.", 
    "6": "Tenryocha, rooibos, and guava teas are widely consumed as herbal beverages, especially as a therapy against pollen allergy. To investigate the possible herbal tea-drug interaction the effect of continuous ingestion of these teas on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A were studied. Rats (n = 6) were allowed free access to either tea (experimental groups) or water (control) for two weeks. Midazolam (MDZ) (20 mg/kg) was orally administered and the serum concentration was determined. The area under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC(0-infinity)) and the maximum serum concentrations (C(max)) of MDZ were reduced by more than 60% after the treatment of tenryocha and rooibos tea (P<0.05). Intestinal MDZ 1'- and 4-hydroxylation activities mediated by CYP3A were increased in tenryocha and rooibos tea-treated group by 50% compared to the control group, although the results were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the Western blot analysis showed that CYP3A content was significantly increased in the intestine after the treatment of these teas (P<0.05). Hepatic MDZ hydroxylation and CYP3A content were slightly increased by these teas. The results suggested that two weeks ingestion of tenryocha and rooibos tea reduced serum concentration of MDZ by the induction of intestinal CYP3A. The possible interaction between tenryocha or rooibos tea and medicines mediated by CYP3A was suggested.",

Hence, a platinum moiety cross-linking the imidazopyridine and the thiazole aromatic rings does not alter the affinity for PBR.

Overall, serum CK was higher than five times the upper limit of normal in 17% of patients. The prevalence of raised CK values was positively correlated with the stated quantity of olanzapine ingested, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship for acute muscle toxicity.

Furthermore, we examined the modulation effect of organic solvents on CYP3A inhibition by ketoconazole. Testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation activity was potently inhibited in the presence of DMSO and 1-propanol in a concentration-dependent manner. Midazolam 1'-hydroxylation activity, however, was weakly inhibited only by 1% of DMSO, the highest concentration used in this study. Moreover, the potency of ketoconazole to inhibit CYP3A activities was variable, depending on the organic solvent used as a dissolving solvent for ketoconazole. Our data indicate that each organic solvent had an effect on CYP3A4 activity, evaluated by both substrates with different magnitudes. Furthermore, it was shown that the effects of organic solvents on CYP3A activity are substrate-dependent. The present study also shows that methanol had little effect on either substrate.",

There is evidence for the binding of two substrates in the active site of the enzyme, but the mechanism of this cooperative binding is unclear. Diazepam is such a drug that undergoes metabolism by CYP3A4 with sigmoidal dependence. Metabolism is initiated by hydrogen atom abstraction from the drug. To understand the factors that determine the cooperative binding and the juxtaposition of the C-H bond undergoing abstraction, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations for two enzymatic conformers and examined the differences between the substrate-free and the bound enzymes, with one and two diazepam molecules. Our results indicate that the effector substrate interacts both with the active substrate and with the enzyme, and that this interaction results in side chain reorientation with relatively minor long-range effects. In accord with experiment, we find that F304, in the interface between the active and effector binding sites, is a key residue in the mechanism of cooperative binding. The addition of the effector substrate stabilizes F304 and its environment, especially F213, and induces a favorable orientation of the active substrate, leading to a short distance between the targeted hydrogen for abstraction and the active species of the enzyme. In addition, in one conformer of the enzyme, residue R212 may strongly interact with F304 and counteract the effector's impact on the enzyme.",

    "59": "Lorazepam impaired performance and flumazenil enhanced it; these cognitive effects were more salient in schizophrenic patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated positive load response in a frontoparietal system and negative load response in the temporal and posterior cingulate regions; activation of the frontoparietal cortex was positively correlated with deactivation of the temporocingulate cortex. After placebo administration, schizophrenic patients had abnormally attenuated activation of the frontoparietal cortex and deactivation of the temporocingulate cortex; this pattern was mimicked in healthy volunteers and exacerbated in schizophrenic patients by lorazepam. However, in schizophrenic patients, flumazenil enhanced deactivation of the temporocingulate and activation of the anterior cingulate cortices.",

We aim to document factors that influence residents' decisions to use analgesia and sedation during lumbar puncture and to compare pediatric and emergency medicine residents' practices.", 
    "62": "A survey was developed and sent to pediatric and emergency medicine residents from across Canada that inquired about clinical practices, learning experiences, current use of analgesia and sedation for lumbar puncture, and their clinical reasoning for using or abstaining from using analgesia and sedation. The Student's t and chi2 tests were used to compare the 2 resident groups.", 
    "63": "Of the 374 residents to whom the survey was sent, 245 completed the survey. Pediatric residents reported performing lumbar punctures with no local anesthetic much more frequently. Pediatric residents used EMLA (AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) more frequently and injectable lidocaine less frequently. Pediatric residents used sedation for lumbar puncture at least once, more frequently than emergency medicine residents, and used mostly benzodiazepines. Both groups used ketamine at a similar rate. Pediatric residents reported that they witnessed adverse events of sedation more frequently. Although pediatric residents were responsible for teaching trainees the lumbar-puncture procedure significantly more frequently, they reported less educational opportunities during residency themselves and that they were less likely to recommend the use of local anesthetic during lumbar puncture when teaching the procedure.", 
    "64": "Several significant differences exist between the pediatric residents and emergency medicine residents we surveyed. Pediatric residents were using less injectable local anesthesia for lumbar puncture in children and more sedation for the procedure and have had notably less training in the use of sedation. Pediatric residents have more teaching responsibilities than their emergency medicine residents colleagues and are inconsistently recommending the use of local anesthetics for lumbar puncture.", 
    "65": "Depression and anxiety disorders are thought to be common in palliative cancer care, but there is inconsistent evidence regarding their relevance for other aspects of quality of life. In the Canadian National Palliative Care Survey, semi-structured interviews assessing depression and anxiety disorders were administered to 381 patients who were receiving palliative care for cancer. There were 212 women and 169 men, with a median survival of 63 days. We found that 93 participants (24.4%, 95% confidence interval=20.2-29.0) fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition diagnostic criteria for at least one anxiety or depressive disorder (20.7% prevalence of depressive disorders, 13.9% prevalence of anxiety disorders). The most frequent individual diagnosis was major depression (13.1%, 95% confidence interval=9.9-16.9). Comorbidity was common, with 10.2% of participants meeting criteria for more than one disorder. Those diagnosed with a disorder were significantly younger than other participants (P=0.002). They also had lower performance status (P=0.017), smaller social networks (P=0.008), and less participation in organized religious services (P=0.007). In addition, they reported more severe distress on 14 of 18 physical symptoms, social concerns, and existential issues. Of those with a disorder, 39.8% were being treated with antidepressant medication, and 66.7% had been prescribed a benzodiazepine. In conclusion, it appears that depression and anxiety disorders are indeed common among patients receiving palliative care. These disorders contribute to a greatly diminished quality of life among people who are dying of cancer.",

During the last few years two proteins were shown to be critical for this process: the mitochondrial translocator protein, previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, and the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. In this manuscript we review evidence suggesting that these two proteins functionally interact to facilitate cholesterol transport and may be part of a larger multimeric mitochondrial complex of proteins assembled to facilitate the hormone-induced cholesterol transfer into mitochondria. This complex might include proteins such as the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel, the translocator protein-associated protein PAP7 which also functions as an A kinase anchor protein that binds and brings into the complex the regulatory subunit Ialpha of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase.",

Patients have more contact with their GP in Gjoevik, while contact with local social service and so-called \"responsibility groups\" (organised cooperation between patient and professionals) are on the same level as for the country as a whole. The patients have less contact with specialized substance abuse and MMT centres than the average Norwegian patient. Treatment outcome regarding social rehabilitation (housing, source of income, occupation) and control of addictive behaviour (injecting drugs, opiate and illegal benzodiazepines in urine tests and overall assessment of drug behaviour) is close to the national average.",

After commencing olanzapine he developed diabetic ketoacidosis and was managed in the intensive care unit of a general hospital. Olanzapine was stopped and replaced by haloperidol 5 mg/day. He was put on a strict 1500 kcal diabetic diet and required insulin injections to maintain a normal blood sugar level despite cessation of olanzapine for 4 months. Doctors prescribing olanzapine should be aware of the risk of diabetes mellitus. Baseline and regular monitoring of body weight, body mass index, and fasting blood glucose are essential to prevent serious consequences.", 
    "72": "Fourteen beagles were used to determine the effects of fentanyl and midazolam as a premedicant for mask induction of anaesthesia with sevoflurane. The drugs were administered to each dog in a randomised cross-over design with a seven-day washout period between experiments. After a 15-minute equilibration period, a treatment consisting of fentanyl (10 mug/kg bodyweight) and midazolam (0.2 mg/kg) was given either intravenously or intramuscularly. Anaesthesia was then induced by the use of a facemask with sevoflurane in 100 per cent oxygen at a flow rate of 4 l/minute. Vaporiser settings were increased by 0.8 per cent at 15-second intervals until the value corresponding to 4.8 per cent sevoflurane was achieved. The time to the onset and cessation of involuntary movements, loss of the palpebral reflex, negative response to tail-clamp stimulation, and endotracheal intubation and cardiopulmonary variables were measured. Both the treatments with tentanyl and midazolam resulted in a shorter and smoother induction of anaesthesia than treatment with saline, and the cardiopulmonary changes were smaller and milder.", 
    "73": "Previous studies have shown that low doses of GABA(A) receptor agonists facilitate maternal defense of offspring (maternal aggression), without significantly affecting other maternal behaviors. In addition, it has been demonstrated that endogenous changes in GABAergic neurotransmission occur in association with lactation. This study investigated the effects of GABA(A) receptor agonist, chlordiazepoxide (CDP), a benzodiazepine (BDZ), on maternal behaviors including aggression, and identified brain regions with altered activity in association with treatment. Another aim of the study was to determine whether CDP injections could prevent decreases in maternal aggression that occur with pup separation. Intraperitoneal injections of 1 mg/kg of CDP significantly increased maternal defense without affecting other maternal behaviors, although a trend towards elevated nursing was noted. CDP significantly reduced c-Fos in lateral septum (LS) and caudal periaqueductal gray (cPAG) in behaviorally-experienced mice relative to vehicle-injected controls. In behaviorally-na\u00efve subjects, CDP also decreased c-Fos in LS, but in cPAG this decrease was just above significance (p=0.051). CDP was not sufficient to \"rescue\" maternal aggression when pup stimulus was removed. Overall, these studies provide further insights into the role for GABA in maternal behaviors, including aggression, and how and where BDZs may act to modulate behavior.",

The total therapy duration was 4 weeks. HAMD, HAMA and self-evaluation table of chest pain were obtained before therapy, at the end of 1 and 2 weeks after therapy.", 
    "76": "Baseline HAMD and HAMA scores and self-evaluation score of chest pain were similar among 3 groups and all scores were significantly improved post various therapies in the order of group F + O > group F > group P. The rate of score decrease were seen after 1 week treatment in group F + O and after 2 week treatment in group F. There was a significant positive correlation between the rates of self-evaluation chest pain score decrease and HAMD (r = 0.867, P < 0.001) and HAMA (r = 0.854, P < 0.001) score decreases after 4 weeks therapies (P < 0.05).

    "78": "Despite an increasing number of antiemetic drugs available, nausea and vomiting (NV) remain a central problem during chemotherapy. Acute and delayed NV benefit most often from the combination of classical antiemetic (such as metoclopramide or metopimazin), corticosteroids and 5HT3 inhibitors (setrons). Since 2006, a new class of antiemetics are available, the NK1 inhibitors (aprepitant), which improve the control of NV in combination with setrons and corticosteroids. Anticipatory NV must be treated with benzodiazepines. Other causes of NV must be discussed in those patients, such as gastro intestinal or metabolic disorders, cancer evolution such as occlusion, brain metastases. A global approach is necessary to improve the quality of life all along the courses of chemotherapy, including somatic and psychologic aspects.", 
    "79": "Three cases of suicidal Morbital intoxication were presented. Morbital is a veterinarian preparation for euthanasia of small animals. This preparation is an injectable solution containing 26.7 mg pentobarbitone and 133.3 mg pentobarbitone sodium per 1 ml. In cases no 1 and no 2 the drug was administered by intravenous self-injection, in case No 3--by oral administration. In all cases the suicide was attempted after alcohol consumption. In the first case only confusion and equilibrium disorder were observed. In the second case coma and flaccidity with hyporeflexia were noted. In the first two cases the blood barbiturates concentration was low (1.46 and 1.42 microg/ml), in addition in case No 2 high benzodiazepine serum concentration was revealed (451.64 ng/m). Because of that, it was concluded that in case No 2 severe patients condition resulted from a mixed intoxication with pentobarbitone, benzodiazepines and ethanol. In the case no 3 deep coma, hypotension and circulatory insufficiency were observed. The blood barbiturates concentration was high (10.14 microg/ml). After 4 days barbiturate serum concentration was dropped and the patient developed symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) injury. The computer tomography showed intracranial hematoma in frontal lobe. Based on these results and history obtained from patients mother it was assumed that the intracranial bleeding is most probably of traumatic etiology. After a neurosurgical consult the patient was transferred to neurology word in order to continue medical treatment. Probably high pentobarbitone concentration in the first three days of hospitalisation was the cause of absence of CNS injury symptoms because diminution of high intracranial pressure associated with hematoma. In all cases the mainstay of therapy was forced diuresis and supportive care (airway protection, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors). No extracorporeal methods of toxin elimination from the blood were used. This paper indicates that self-administration of Morbital-preparation for euthanasia of small animals, may evoke severe intoxication in man.",

    "81": "A computerized bibliographic search of the literature regarding dexmedetomidine.", 
    "82": "The end-organ effects of dexmedetomidine have been well studied in animal and adult human models. Adverse cardiovascular effects include occasional episodes of bradycardia with rare reports of sinus pause or cardiac arrest. Hypotension has also been reported as well as hypertension, the latter thought to be due to peripheral alpha2B agonism with peripheral vasoconstriction. Although dexmedetomidine has no direct effects on myocardial function, decreased cardiac output may result from changes in heart rate or increases in afterload. There are somewhat conflicting reports in the literature regarding its effects on ventilatory function, with some studies (both human and animal) suggesting a mild degree of respiratory depression, decreased minute ventilation, and decreased response to CO2 challenge whereas others demonstrate no effect. The central nervous system effects include sedation and analgesia with prevention of recall and memory at higher doses. Dexmedetomidine may also provide some neuroprotective activity during periods of ischemia. Applications in infants and children have included sedation during mechanical ventilation, prevention of emergence agitation following general anesthesia, provision of procedural sedation, and the prevention of withdrawal following the prolonged administration of opioids and benzodiazepines.", 
    "83": "The literature contains reports of the use of dexmedetomidine in approximately 800 pediatric patients.

    "88": "After a long and controversial debate methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) was first introduced in Germany in 1987. The number of patients in MMT--first low because of strict admission criteria--increased considerably since the 1990s up to some 65,000 at the end of 2006. In Germany each general practitioner (GP), who has completed an additional training in addiction medicine, is allowed to prescribe substitution drugs to opioid dependent patients. Currently 2,700 GPs prescribe substitution drugs. Psychosocial care should be made available to all MMT patients.", 
    "89": "The results of research studies and practical experiences clearly indicate that patients benefit substantially from MMT with improvements in physical and psychological health. MMT proves successful in attaining high retention rates (65% to 85% in the first years, up to 50% after more than seven years) and plays a major role in accessing and maintaining ongoing medical treatment for HIV and hepatitis. MMT is also seen as a vital factor in the process of social re-integration and it contributes to the reduction of drug related harms such as mortality and morbidity and to the prevention of infectious diseases. Some 10% of MMT patients become drug-free in the long run. Methadone is the most commonly prescribed substitution medication in Germany, although buprenorphine is attaining rising importance. Access to MMT in rural areas is very patchy and still constitutes a problem. There are only few employment opportunities for patients participating in MMT, although regular employment is considered unanimously as a positive factor of treatment success. Substitution treatment in German prisons is heterogeneous in access and treatment modalities. Access is very patchy and the number of inmates in treatment is limited. Nevertheless, substitution treatment plays a substantial part in the health care system provided to drug users in Germany.", 
    "90": "In Germany, a history of substitution treatment spanning 20 years has meanwhile accumulated a wealth of experience, e.g. in the development of research on health care services, guidelines and the implementation of quality assurance measures. Implementing substitution treatment with concomitant effects and treatment elements such as drug history-taking, dosage setting, co-use of other psychoactive substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, cocaine), management of 'difficult patient populations', and integration into the social environment has been arranged successfully. Also psychosocial counseling programmes adjuvant to substitution treatment have been established and, in the framework of a pilot project on heroin-based treatment, standardised manuals were developed. Research on allocating opioid users to the 'right' form of therapy at the 'right' point in time is still a challenge, though the pilot project 'heroin-based treatment' brought experience with patients who do not benefit from methadone treatment. There is also expertise in the treatment of specific co-morbidity such as HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and psychiatric disorders. The promotion and involvement of self-help groups plays an important part in the process of successful substitution treatment.", 
    "91": "Although they are less frequently compared with the reported cases of CYP-mediated drug interactions, clinically significant transporter-mediated drug interactions, which are mainly based on efflux transporter or P-glycoprotein data, have been reported. Unlike the CYP-mediated drug interactions that can be readily defined by inhibition or induction of CYP enzymes, the evidence for the so-called transporter-mediated drug interactions is often less conclusive. The difficulty in defining transporter-mediated drug interactions is due mainly to the interplay between transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes in drug disposition, and the lack of specific and potent inhibitors for each transporter and enzyme. An important lesson learned from animal studies is that transporter inhibition has a much greater impact on the tissue distribution of drugs than on the systemic exposure of drugs measured in plasma. The potential risk of transporter-mediated drug interactions might be underestimated if only plasma concentrations are monitored.", 
    "92": "Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to examine changes in muscarinic M1/M4 and M2/M4 receptors (targeted with [3H]pirenzepine and [3H]AF-DX384 respectively), in rats treated with the typical (haloperidol) and atypical (clozapine and olanzapine) antipsychotic medications for a period of 36 days. Rats were sacrificed at either 2 h or 48 h after the last drug administration to examine immediate effects as well as the effects at 48 h after drug withdrawal. Haloperidol significantly increased [3H]pirenzepine binding in the dentate gyrus (37%) and in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (34%) in animals sacrificed 2 h after the last drug administration compared to controls. Similarly, clozapine significantly increased [3H]pirenzepine binding in dentate gyrus (29%) in rats sacrificed 2 h after the last drug administration compared to controls. Haloperidol decreased [3H]AF-DX384 binding in the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (20%) in the rats sacrificed 48 h after the last drug administration compared to controls. These findings suggest that muscarinic receptors and limbic brain regions such as hippocampus and amygdala might represent common targets that mediate beneficial clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "93": "Many behavior studies indicate that cholecystokinin (CCK) is related to nociception and anxiety/panic actions in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). We previously reported that a sulfated form of CCK octapeptide (CCK-8S) produced excitatory effects at both pre- and postsynaptic loci in PAG neurons using slice preparations and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Here, we further examined the detailed mechanism of CCK-8S in acutely isolated PAG neurons of the rat using fura-2-based imaging of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. Application of 1 microM CCK-8S produced an increase of [Ca2+]i, and its effect did not desensitize. This CCK-8S-induced [Ca2+]i increase was inhibited by the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365260 but not by the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364718. In addition, the effect of CCK-8S was eliminated by removing extracellular Ca2+, but not by an addition of the intracellular Ca2+ reuptake inhibitor thapsigargin. When simultaneous recordings of [Ca2+]i imaging and whole-cell patch-clamp were performed, CCK-8S-induced [Ca2+]i increase was significantly reduced at a membrane holding potential of -60 mV while CCK-8S-induced inward current was still observed. Current-voltage plots revealed that CCK-8S-induced inward current reversed near the equilibrium potential for K+ ions with a decreased membrane conductance. However, CCK-8S produced a significant inhibition on high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channel currents. These results suggest that CCK-8S can excite PAG neurons by inhibiting K+ channels, and CCK-8S-induced [Ca2+]i increase occurs secondary to depolarization. The evidence presented here expands our understanding of cellular mechanisms for CCK-mediated anti-analgesic and anxiogenic actions in the PAG.",

Nearly 21% were receiving medication only for psychiatric problems, 7.2% were receiving psychotherapy alone, and 24.5% were receiving both medication and psychotherapy. Patients receiving psychopharmacological treatment received similar medications, often at similar dosages, regardless of whether their prescriber was a primary care physician or a psychiatrist. One exception was that patients were less likely to be taking benzodiazepines if their provider was a primary care physician. Those receiving medications from a primary care provider were also less likely to be receiving psychotherapy. Overall, patients with more functional impairment, more severe symptoms, and comorbid major depression were more likely to receive mental health treatment. Members of racial/ethnic minority groups were less likely to be treated. Frequently endorsed reasons for not receiving pharmacological treatment were that the primary care physician did not recommend it and the patient did not believe in taking medication for emotional problems.",

Subjects were enrolled and assessed at two Phase I units. Statistical analyses sought to determine the sensitivity of the test battery to sedation-related cognitive dysfunction, any between-site differences in outcome, and also the effects of repeated test administration (i.e., practice or learning effects).", 
    "105": "There were no significant differences in data collected between sites. All standard safety measurements were completed. No substantial technical issues were noted. No learning effects were observed on four of the five cognitive tasks. ANOVA comparing baseline to post-baseline results revealed significant cognitive deterioration on all five cognitive tasks 1 h following administration of 5.25 mg midazolam. The magnitude of these changes were very large according to conventional statistical criteria. Smaller but significant changes were observed on a subset of memory and learning tasks at 1 h post-dosing in 1.75 mg condition, and at 2 h post-dosing in the 5.25 mg condition.",

Here, we present a comprehensive convergent analysis that translationally integrates brain gene expression data from a relevant pharmacogenomic mouse model (involving treatments with a psychomimetic agent - phencyclidine (PCP), and an anti-psychotic - clozapine), with human genetic linkage data and human postmortem brain data, as a Bayesian strategy of cross validating findings. Topping the list of candidate genes, we have three genes involved in GABA neurotransmission (GABRA1, GABBR1, and GAD2), one gene involved in glutamate neurotransmission (GRIA2), one gene involved in neuropeptide signaling (TAC1), two genes involved in synaptic function (SYN2 and KCNJ4), six genes involved in myelin/glial function (CNP, MAL, MBP, PLP1, MOBP and GFAP), and one gene involved in lipid metabolism (LPL). These data suggest that schizophrenia is primarily a disorder of brain functional and structural connectivity, with GABA neurotransmission playing a prominent role. These findings may explain the EEG gamma band abnormalities detected in schizophrenia. The analysis also revealed other high probability candidates genes (neurotransmitter signaling, other structural proteins, ion channels, signal transduction, regulatory enzymes, neuronal migration/neurite outgrowth, clock genes, transcription factors, RNA regulatory genes), pathways and mechanisms of likely importance in pathophysiology. Some of the pathways identified suggest possible avenues for augmentation pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia with other existing agents, such as benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants and lipid modulating agents. Other pathways are new potential targets for drug development.

Midazolam-fentanyl group (group II), received intermittent doses of midazolam and fentanyl guided by level of sedation. All patients were premedicated with midazolam 0.05 mg/kg IV, in divided doses as per patient tolerance, before starting the procedure. Sedation was assessed depending on Ramsey scale of sedation.

    "127": "The features of a new, in situ method for solubilizing poorly soluble drugs (SupraVail Instant Solubilization) are demonstrated. The resulting formulations are suitable for parenteral administration in preclinical and clinical studies. The technique avoids drug precipitation upon dilution and circumvents the need for co-administration of high organic solvent concentrations. The method involves mixing a sterile solution of a poorly water-soluble drug in a water-miscible organic solvent (the \"transfer medium\") with an excess of a sterile, stable, phospholipid dispersion prepared by high-shear homogenization. The influence of several mixing parameters which may affect the utility and viability of the method for two drugs, namely diazepam or cyclosporine A, are examined in detail. The resulting transparent dispersions were analyzed for presence of insoluble particles, transmission, particle size, and degree of solubilization. It is found that solubilizing efficiency is mainly determined by the drug and the phospholipid-to-drug ratio in the final dispersion. Complete and instant solubilization is obtained by using negatively charged phospholipids in the transfer medium. Variations in the mixing conditions, such as fast addition compared to slow addition, no shaking (agitation) versus shaking during mixing, stirring after mixing, and temperature variations of the lipid dispersion do not significantly affect the reproducibility of the method.",

SDT of a predominantly central origin has been treated successfully with benzodiazepines and GABAergic drugs. Our aim was to test the control of SDT of predominantly cochlear origin by benzodiazepines and GABAergic drugs. We followed the format of a prospective, randomized, single-blind clinical trial at an academic tertiary-care hospital. We studied 30 patients, all with SDT of clear cochlear origin. We treated 10 patients with placebo (group 1), 10 with benzodiazepine drugs (group 2), and 10 with benzodiazepine and GABAergic drugs (group 3). We recorded a decrease in the annoyance and intensity of SDT as measured by a visual analog scale ranging from 1 (negligible) to 10 (unbearable). We found statistically significant improvement in comparing groups 2 and 3 with group 1 but found no significant difference when groups 2 and 3 were compared.

A 35-year-old woman with a history of bipolar affective disorder treated with olanzapine presented with severe diabetic ketoacidosis. She had no prior history of diabetes or risk factors for diabetes. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) on admission blood sample suggested that long-term glycemic control had been poor. The authors postulate that treatment with olanzapine precipitated hyperglycemia, an elevated creatine kinase level, and a high amylase level. A concurrent urinary tract infection precipitated an episode of sepsis, which combined to precipitate life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis. During her stay in the intensive treatment unit and subsequently in the medical ward, her blood glucose concentration was intensively monitored. She remains on insulin therapy, and her antipsychotic medication was changed to risperidone. Newer atypical antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine have been introduced with the benefit of fewer extrapyramidal side effects. A number of these have reported metabolic side effects of uncertain etiology such as diabetic ketoacidosis and elevated creatine kinase. The authors believe that the diabetic ketoacidosis occurred in this patient, who had no previous history of diabetes mellitus. Blood glucose should be monitored in patients taking olanzapine, especially in those patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus.", 
    "132": "There is a general consensus that benzodiazepines affect attentional processes, yet only few studies have tried to investigate these impairments in detail. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of a single dose of Lorazepam on performance in a target cancellation task with important time constraints. We measured correct target detections and correct distractor rejections, misses and false positives. The results show that Lorazepam produces multiple kinds of shifts in performance, which suggests that it impairs multipLe processes: (a) the evolution of performance over time was not the same between the placebo and the Lorazepam groups, with the Lorazepam affecting performance quite early after the beginning of the test. This is suggestive of a depletion of attentional resources during sequential attentional processing; (b) Lorazepam affected differently target and distractor processing, with target detection being the most impaired; (c) misses were more frequent under Lorazepam than under placebo, but no such difference was observed as far as false positives were concerned. Signal detection analyses showed that Lorazepam (d) decreased perceptual discrimination, and (e) reliably increased response bias. Our results bring new insights on the multiple effects of Lorazepam on selective attention which, when combined, may have deleterious effects on human performance.", 
    "133": "The understanding that probiotic foods can have beneficial effects on health has recently led to an increase in consumer demand for such products, thus enhancing their commercial value. Daily intake of probiotic micro-organisms, such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, contributes to maintaining and improving the balance of intestinal microbe populations, and their presence in high numbers largely prevents gastro-intestinal disturbances and improves the well-being of the organism by reinforcing its natural defences. In products destined for human consumption, probiotic bacteria are mainly incorporated in fermented milk products whose consumption may be limited by allergies and intolerances, or by low-cholesterol diets. Research is currently aimed at developing probiotic vegetable products which may ensure a regular assumption of beneficial micro-organisms from foods and beverages which are part of a normal diet, thus overcoming the limitations imposed by the use of milk-based products. This paper provides an overview of probiotic products and recently developed technologies, with some details on vegetable carriers used for delivering probiotic species into the human gastro-intestinal tract.", 
    "134": "Although levodopa is the current \"gold standard\" for treatment of Parkinson's disease, there has been disputation on whether AMPA receptor antagonists can be used as adjuvant therapy to improve the effects of levodopa. Systemic administration of levodopa, the precursor of dopamine, increases brain dopamine turnover rate and this elevated turnover is believed to be essential for successful treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, long-term treatment of patients with levodopa often leads to development of dyskinesia. Therefore, drugs that feature potentiation of dopamine turnover rate and are able to reduce daily levodopa dosages might be used as adjuvant in the treatment of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease. To investigate such combined treatment, we have examined the effects of two non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonists, GYKI-52466 and GYKI-53405, alone or in combination with levodopa on dopamine turnover rate in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned striatum of the rat. We found here that repeated administration of levodopa, added with the peripheral DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor carbidopa, increased dopamine turnover rate after lesioning the striatum with 6-hydroxydopamine. Moreover, combination of levodopa with GYKI-52466 or GYKI-53405 further increased dopamine turnover enhanced by levodopa administration while the AMPA receptor antagonists by themselves failed to influence striatal dopamine turnover. We concluded from the present data that potentiation observed between levodopa and AMPA receptor antagonists may reflect levodopa-sparing effects in clinical treatment indicating the therapeutic potential of such combination in the management of Parkinson's disease.",

Our previous work has shown that CCK-8 plays an important role in the development of tolerance to morphine analgesia and electroacupuncture (EA) analgesia in the rat. The present studies were designed to examine whether the CCK(B) receptor is involved in the modulation of EA analgesia and the development of EA tolerance in mice. The latency to flick the tail in the radiant heat was used as index to assess the efficacy of EA analgesia. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of the CCK(B) receptor antagonist L365,260 produced a dose-dependent (0.125-2.0 mg/kg) potentiation of the analgesia induced by 100 Hz EA, with a maximal effect occurred at 0.5 mg/kg. In addition, L365,260 (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reversed chronic tolerance to 100 Hz EA in mice. These results suggest that the CCK(B) receptor might play a role in the tonic inhibition of 100 Hz EA-induced analgesia and in the mediation of chronic tolerance to 100 Hz EA in mice. The results opened a way for further investigation of the function of CCK-8 in pain modulation using inbred strains of mice.",

    "143": "Benzodiazepines induce an immediate anxiolytic activity at the expense of side effects such as sedation, tolerance and withdrawal. In contrast, selective serotonin receptor uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are known to offer long-term symptom improvement without inducing tolerance and withdrawal, but with a delayed onset of the anxiolytic effect. ELB139 is a novel agonist at the benzodiazepine binding site with pronounced anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity without inducing tolerance to both effects after chronic administration. ELB139 shows a selectivity for alpha-3-subunit containing GABA(A) receptors. In the present study the effect of the compound on monoaminergic neurotransmitter levels were investigated by microdialysis. ELB139 induced a significant increase of extracellular 5-HT in the striatum and the medial prefrontal cortex of rats without affecting dopamine levels in these areas. The increase of 5-HT in the striatum was reversed by systemic and by local administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil in the dorsal raphe nucleus by a microdialysis probe, suggesting that the increase in 5-HT was mediated by the activity of ELB139 at the benzodiazepine binding site. As the dorsal raphe nucleus is rich in alpha-3 subunits, this effect of ELB139 may be mediated by its subtype selectivity. Thus, ELB139 seems to combine effects seen with benzodiazepine agonists and SSRIs in one compound.",

Almost all respondents (96%) reported a 20 lb increase in patients' weight as a troublesome potential adverse event associated with the use of some agents. After initiating a new medication, more than 80% of respondents monitored their patients' weight, fasting plasma glucose level, and fasting lipid profile at regular intervals. However, 80% did not monitor waist circumference. Overall, respondents viewed several agents (aripiprazole, ziprasidone, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine) as not (or minimally) problematic in terms of weight gain and adverse metabolic concerns. Clozapine and olanzapine were viewed as highly problematic due to their propensity to induce weight gain and negatively influence lipid and glucose metabolism. Other agents considered to be minimally to moderately problematic in terms of weight gain and metabolic issues were quetiapine, risperidone, lithium, and valproate. Respondents reported that the profile of a bipolar agent in terms of weight gain and adverse metabolic effects was an important consideration in the management of bipolar disorder.",

    "177": "The effects of the neuroactive steroids alphaxalone and pregnanolone on single GABA(A) receptor channels were tested in cell-attached and inside-out patches from cultured newborn rat hippocampal neurons. The conductance of these single channels ranged between 10 and 80 pS when exposed to low (0.5-3 microM) GABA concentrations. These GABA concentrations activated low-conducting channels (<40 pS) in 78% of the patches, 22% of patches had channels with a maximum conductance above 40 pS. Alphaxalone at concentrations above 1 microM, and pregnanolone at concentrations above 0.1 microM, significantly increased the conductance of initially low-conducting single channels activated by GABA up to seven-fold and at all concentrations tested, both drugs increased open probability and mean open time and decreased closed probability and mean closed time of channels. Both steroids at higher concentrations could directly activate high conductance (>40 pS) chloride channels. Both the directly activated channels and those channels that had been previously affected by alphaxalone were modulated by diazepam, a benzodiazepine drug that is known to specifically modulate GABA(A) channels. The present study is the first one to show that neurosteroids can significantly increase single GABA(A) channel conductance, thus enlarging our current knowledge on the molecular mechanism of action of these compounds.",

Eight studies compared benzodiazepines as a sole agent with placebo. More participants receiving benzodiazepines showed a clinically significant response (n=222, 4 RCTs, RR 0.54 CI 0.3 to 1.0, NNT 3 CI 2 to 17). Only one small study found a significant group difference in favour of benzodiazepines regarding the improvement in overall BPRS mental state. Different rating scales were used to assess general mental state, and therefore many outcomes could not be pooled and no overall direction of effect emerged. Some adverse events observed in these studies suggested that benzodiazepines were more harmful than placebos but again the data were incompletely reported and without overall effect. Thirteen studies examined the effects of benzodiazepines in comparison to antipsychotics as a sole treatment. Trials that reported on clinical response found no advantage for any treatment group concerning improvement of the participants' global state, except of one small study that analysed the mean CGI severity score at one hour. This comparison is highly limited by the low numbers of studies reporting on global function and the short trial duration. Two studies showed a statistically significant superiority of antipsychotics in terms of relapse prevention at one year. Desired sedation occurred significantly more often among participants in the benzodiazepine group than among participants in the antipsychotic treatment group at 20 (n=301, 1 RCT, RR 1.32 CI 1.2 -1.5, NNT 5, CI 3 to 8) and 40 minutes(n= 301, 1 RCT, RR 1.13 CI 1.0 to 1.2, NNT 9 CI 6 to 33), but not at 30, 60 or 12 minutes. Other outcomes relating to the general or specific mental state revealed no significant differences between groups. As far as adverse events were reported there were no results in favour of any group. Sixteen studies examined whether the augmentation of antipsychotics with benzodiazepines is more effective than antipsychotics as a sole treatment. During the first hour of treatment the combination treatment group benefited from the additional benzodiazepine in terms of the participants global state. This benefit diminished over time and was not reproducible at 2 hours or longer. No superior efficacy of benzodiazepine augmentation could be found regarding the general mental state. Specific aspects of the mental state showed no group difference except for desired sedation at 30 and 60 minutes. Somnolence affected the combination treatment group significantly more than the control group (n=118, 2 RCTs, RR 3.30 CI 1.0 to 10.4, NNH 8 CI 5 to 50). We found use of antiparkinson medication to be less frequently used in the combination treatment group (n=282, RR 0.68 CI 0.5 to 1.0, NNT 9 CI 6 to 48).

In clinical practice medication that is effective both for tranquilization and prevention of aggressive escalation is recommended. Current data suggest first line treatment using neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. Due to their potential use both for rapid sedation and prevention atypical neuroleptics are of particular importance. Further controlled studies are needed to evaluate pharmacological treatment of aggressive states with potential (self) harming behaviour in children and adolescents.",

One substantial problem encountered by these patients is that, in addition to the original traumatization in their country of origin, the unstable psychosocial conditions of their legal exile condition can lead to re-traumatization which must be responded to with psychiatric treatment.", 
    "206": "The thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) provides a major source of inhibition in the thalamo-cortical circuit and is critically involved in the generation of spindle oscillations. Here we describe the properties of thalamic giant depolarizing potentials (tGDPs) that were observed in nRt during early development. tGDPs persisted in presence of ionotropic glutamate antagonists but were completely abolished by GABA(A)R antagonist SR 35591. tGDPs occurred primarily between p3 and p8 (in 30-50% of cells) and occasionally up until p15. tGDPs lasted 0.4-3 s with peak conductances of 2-13 nS and occurred at frequencies between 0.02 and 0.06 Hz. We used mice with a benzodiazepine-insensitive alpha3 subunit [alpha3(H126R)] to probe for the identity of the GABA receptors responsible for tGDP generation. Benzodiazepine enhancement of tGDP amplitude and duration persisted in nRt neurons in alpha3(H126R) mice, indicating that the GABA(A)Rs containing alpha3 are not critical for tGDP generation and suggesting that tGDPs are mediated by GABA(A)Rs containing the alpha5 subunit, which is transiently expressed in nRt neurons in early postnatal development. Furthermore we found that exogenous GABA application depolarized nRt neurons younger than p8, indicating elevated [Cl(-)](i) at this developmental stage. Taken together, these data suggest that in immature nRt, long-lasting depolarizing responses mediated by GABA receptors could trigger Ca(2+) entry and play a role in functional development of the spindle-generating circuitry.",

    "209": "The anticonvulsant effects of benzyl- and benzhydryl ureides in mice models of seizures (maximal electroshock seizure test, pentylenetetrazol test, picrotoxin-induced seizure test) and the influence on spontaneous locomotor activity has been assessed. Furthermore, the analgesic effect of ureide derivatives was studied in the hot-plate test in mice. Selected compounds were investigated for their in vitro interaction with adenosine receptors as well as the benzodiazepine binding site of GABA(A) receptors. This study demonstrated the strong anticonvulsant activity of several ureides in electrically or chemically induced seizure models, and structure-activity relationships were discussed. 1-Benzyl-3-butyrylurea (9) was found to be equipotent to ethosuximide in the pentylenetetrazol test with regard to the number of attacks as well as the time of the onset of seizures. The ureide 9 also revealed the highest protective activity against seizures in the other models, maximal electroshock seizure and picrotoxin test. Moreover, 1-benzyl-3-butyrylurea was not neurotoxic at doses up to 200 mg/kg. Benzylureides 8-10 showed affinity to the adenosine A1 receptors at low micromolar concentrations. However, the apparent anticonvulsant activity in different seizure models does not appear to result from direct activation of adenosine A1 receptors or GABA(A) receptors, respectively. In the hot-plate test, the majority of investigated compounds exhibited analgesic activity. Again, compound 9 was superior to the other substances investigated, suggesting a potential therapeutic value of that ureide derivative.", 
    "210": "There has been increasing interest in the use of anticonvulsant agents in the treatment of alcoholism. Anticonvulsant agents have mostly been evaluated as an alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Among the advantages of using anticonvulsant agents in this capacity is their purported lack of interaction with alcohol (i.e., interactions that could increase psychomotor deficits, cognitive impairment, and increase intoxication). This is particularly important in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal and relapse prevention in outpatients. Unfortunately, these untoward clinical interactions between anticonvulsants and alcohol in alcoholic patients have not been thoroughly assessed. The current clinical laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the anticonvulsant gabapentin in alcoholic subjects. In addition, the ability of gabapentin to reduce alcohol craving and consumption was evaluated.", 
    "211": "Thirty-five non-treatment-seeking alcoholic subjects were enrolled in a subacute human laboratory study and received double-blind treatment with up to 1,200 mg of gabapentin (n=18) or placebo (n=17) for 8 days.

    "212": "There was no overall effect of gabapentin on drinking or craving; however, it was tolerated (e.g., mood and sedation) as well as placebo over 5 days of natural drinking. During the bar-lab drinking session, there were no differences in subjective high or intoxication between subjects treated with gabapentin or placebo.", 
    "213": "This study provides initial evidence that the anticonvulsant gabapentin is safe if used in conjunction with alcohol consumption in alcoholic individuals.

    "214": "Binding assays still form a fundamental part of modern drug development. Receptor binding assays are mostly based on radioactivity because of their speed, ease of use and reproducibility. Disadvantages, such as health hazards and production of radioactive waste, have prompted the development of non-radioactive receptor binding assays. This application therefore focuses on measuring receptor-ligand interactions using mass spectrometry. Moreover, the novelty of this approach originates in determining multiple analytes in a single assay (multiplexing). The proof of principle of a non-radioactive multiplex receptor assay is demonstrated using a pool of receptors from rat cortical tissue with flunitrazepam, MADAM and pindolol in one vial with or without their respective displacers. Flunitrazepam, MADAM and pindolol bound specifically at 73%, 30% and 40% to their respective receptors. This corresponds to specific binding sites of 0.61 pmol/mg protein, 0.07 pmol/mg protein and 0.06 pmol/mg protein, respectively. We propose to measure the bound fraction instead of the free fraction in order to reach a significant difference in measured signals (total binding versus non-specific binding). The bound fraction can be obtained after dissociating the ligand from the receptor-ligand complex using 50% methanol in water. The current setup of the assay calls for further improvement with respect to the measurement of binding constants for a multitude of receptors in one assay with sufficient accuracy and precision.",

The shorter-acting benzodiazepine lorazepam (3.2 mg(-1) kg(-1) 8 h(-1)) was substituted for diazepam and, 11 h after lorazepam, monkeys consistently responded on the flumazenil lever. Flumazenil-lever responding after acute lorazepam deprivation was attenuated not only by benzodiazepines (lorazepam and midazolam) but also by positive GABA(A) receptor modulators acting at neuroactive steroid (pregnanolone and alfaxalone) and barbiturate sites (pentobarbital). Deprivation-induced responding on the flumazenil lever was not attenuated by low efficacy positive GABA(A) modulators (bretazenil and L-838,417) or non-GABA(A) receptor ligands (ketamine and cocaine). Neuroactive steroids were relatively more potent than other positive GABA(A) receptor modulators in attenuating deprivation-induced flumazenil-lever responding, as compared to their relative potency in monkeys discriminating midazolam and otherwise not receiving benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "219": "These results suggest that positive GABA(A) receptor modulators acting at different sites attenuate withdrawal induced by discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment, consistent with previous studies suggesting that the same compounds attenuate flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal.

    "220": "Selegiline transdermal system (STS) is a recently approved monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressant. This article reports results from 3 studies examining the potential for cytochrome P450-dependent pharmacokinetic interactions between STS and 3 psychotropic medications that might be coadministered. Three open-label, randomized, Latin square, 3-sequence crossover design studies were conducted with healthy volunteers to determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of STS 6 mg/24 h and test drug (alprazolam, olanzapine, or risperidone) when administered alone and concomitantly. All pharmacokinetic parameters of interest were unaltered following selegiline or test drug monotherapy when compared to concomitant therapy. This was confirmed by least squares mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals of log(e)-transformed C(max) and AUC(tau) values, using either standard bioequivalence criteria of 80% to 125% or study-defined 70% to 143% boundary criteria.

    "221": "In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.",

    "239": "All patients who died in home palliative care units in the Florence area between March 1-December 31, 2000 and July 1, 2003-June 30, 2004 were prospectively analysed with regard to social, demographic, and clinical characteristics.", 
    "240": "The data presented refer to 1075 patients (331 in 2000 and 744 in 2003-2004). Continuous deep sedation was applied in 14.2% and in 12% of patients, respectively. At baseline, patients who were sedated during the final stages of their life were more likely to be younger in age, to have poorer quality of life and better performance status. Such characteristics did not differ between the two periods. Hydration was not performed in 65% of all patients who finally received sedation in the period 2003-2004 versus 33% in those who did in 2000. In 2003-2004, the decision to use sedation was discussed with patients in 39% of those who were sedated. In 2003-2004, we noticed an increase in the use of benzodiazepines for continuous deep sedation from 43% to 87%. The increase in opioid average dosage from the onset of sedation until the last 24 h of their life was about seven-fold in 2000 and almost twice that amount in 2003-2004 in those patients who were not undergoing treatment with opioids when sedation started.", 
    "241": "The monitoring of end-of-life decision making and of medical practices involved in continuous deep sedation contributes to an enhancement in the quality of caring for terminally ill patients.", 
    "242": "The objective of the article is to present the available data from the literature on substance use disorders in healthcare professionals. Prevalence, risk factors, treatment options, and reentry into clinical practice are discussed.", 
    "243": "Impairment of a healthcare professional is the inability or impending inability to practice according to accepted standards as a result of substance use, abuse, or dependency (addiction). The term substance use disorder can be divided into substance abuse and dependence (addiction). Substance abuse results in adverse social and professional consequences. Addiction manifests as physiologic and behavioral symptoms related to a maladaptive pattern of substance use.", 
    "244": "It is estimated that approximately 10% to 15% of all healthcare professionals will misuse drugs or alcohol at some time during their career. Although the rates of substance abuse and dependence are similar to those of the general population, the prevalence is disturbing because healthcare professionals are the caregivers responsible for the general health and well-being of the general population. Healthcare professionals have higher rates of abuse with benzodiazepines and opiates. Specialties such as anesthesia, emergency medicine, and psychiatry have higher rates of drug abuse, probably related to the high-risk environment associated with these specialties, the baseline personalities of these healthcare providers, and easy access to drugs in these areas. Drugs and alcohol are mostly used for \"recreational\" purposes by medical students. Residents and attending physicians use drugs of abuse for performance enhancement and as self-treatment for various reasons, such as, pain, anxiety, or depression.", 
    "245": "Institutional, local, and statewide impaired-physician programs are now available for the active treatment and rehabilitation of impaired healthcare professionals. Many of these programs are also designed to assist the clinician with reentry into clinical practice. Rarely is punitive action taken when the healthcare provider undergoes successful treatment and ongoing follow-up management. Overall recovery rates for impaired healthcare professionals seem to be higher compared with other groups, particularly with intensive inpatient management and subsequent follow-up care."
