    "0": "Few studies have addressed the antiarrhythmic potential of pretreatment with diazepam in acute myocardial infarction. Thus, the effect of diazepam pretreatment prior to coronary artery occlusion was examined in conscious pigs. Animals were instrumented with aortic catheters to measure arterial pressure, a pulmonary artery catheter for drug administration, and a snare around the left anterior descending coronary artery for permanent occlusion one week later. Diazepam (1 mg/kg iv bolus) or vehicle was administered 10 minutes prior to occlusion. Eight of 14 animals receiving diazepam (57%) and 13 of 22 receiving vehicle animals (59%) developed ventricular fibrillation following coronary occlusion. However, the latency to ventricular fibrillation was significantly shorter (7 +/- 1 min) in animals receiving vehicle compared to animals receiving diazepam (11 +/- 1 min). Significant increases in heart rate were seen up to 5 hours after coronary occlusion only in animals receiving vehicle. The results indicate that diazepam pretreatment can increase ventricular fibrillation latency and prevent heart rate increases following acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "1": "Panic disorder (DSM-III, DSM-III-R) has been thoroughly studied in recent years. The main evidence for panic disorder as a nosological entity is reviewed, to delineate some important questions for future research. Validation criteria include epidemiological, phenomenological, genetic, neurobiological, pharmacological and behavioral findings. Biological, behavioral and psychodynamic considerations on etiology, pathogenesis and treatment are presented.", 
    "2": "Factors that predicted the outcome of drug treatment (alprazolam or imipramine) of panic disorder were studied in a sample of 123 Scandinavian patients participating in a multicenter placebo-controlled 8-week trial. The attrition rate was 95% for alprazolam, 73% for imipramine and 46% for placebo. For the intention-to-treat and 3-week-completer samples, drugs and anxiety symptoms at baseline were the best predictors of improvement on the Global Improvement Scale and on symptom scales focusing on panic attacks, phobic behavior and anticipatory anxiety. For completers of the 8-week trial, only baseline scores predicted outcome. Generally, more severe symptoms at baseline predicted a worse outcome. A subsample of patients had a marked placebo response. Avoidance, sex, age, childhood psychopathology and previous treatment experience had no or only a weak impact on the outcome. The relationship between panic disorder and mood disorder is presented elsewhere.", 
    "3": "Depressive symptoms are frequent in panic disorder. Among 123 Scandinavian patients participating in a placebo-controlled multicenter study of the efficacy of alprazolam and imipramine treatment in panic disorder, 21% and 23% fulfilled the DSM-III criteria of current and past major depressive episode, respectively, and 17% had dysthymia, even when melancholia and depressive episode with onset prior to the panic symptoms were excluded. According to a subscale of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) with higher validity than the full scale, 18% were classified as major depression and 57% as minor depression. A major finding was that patients with affective symptoms had higher scores on many psychopathological measures, including several Symptom Checklist-90 factors. Accordingly, secondary depression was suggested as an indicator of the severity of panic disorder. Depressed and nondepressed patients significantly improved on major outcome measures, but patients with current minor or major depression improved less. Although the sample was too small for detailed analysis of differences in drug efficacy, there was no indication that imipramine was more effective than alprazolam, considering scores on an HRSD subscale.", 
    "4": "Forty-one panic disorder patients receiving placebo were investigated in a double-blind comparison of alprazolam, imipramine and placebo in panic disorder. A significantly higher drop-out rate was found in the placebo group than in the active treatment groups, but placebo response was found in 34% of the patients, defined as reduction of panic attacks to zero, and in 23%, defined as a score of greater than or equal to 8 on the Physician Global Improvement Scale (0-10 points). Several predictors of response to placebo were found. The responders had fewer panic attacks than the nonresponders at baseline. They also reported less psychopathology and were less help-seeking than the nonresponders. The implications for psychopathology and possible response to psychotherapy among responders and nonresponders are discussed. It is hypothesized that the responders show more signs of realistic processing of internal and external stimuli and fewer signs of subjective distress than the nonresponders. Responders will therefore probably be more responsive to psychotherapy than nonresponders.", 
    "5": "A total of 123 Scandinavian patients participated in a cross-national study of panic disorder. Twelve outcome measures, including number of panic attacks and phobias, have been used to describe changes in symptoms during treatment. This article gives a trend analysis of remission for each variable, analysing changes through the total period from baseline to week 8 and also changes in first and second half of this period, separately. Important differences between treatments are demonstrated. Alprazolam had an early effect on variables relating to panic attacks, such as severity of spontaneous attacks and avoidance, whereas imipramine showed a more delayed effect on global measures. Duration of illness, sex and the occurrence of depression in patients' history all affected the sequence of improvement.", 
    "6": "As part of the cross-national collaborative panic study, a double-blind comparison of alprazolam, imipramine and placebo was performed in Scandinavian outpatients with panic disorder according to DSM-III; 41 patients were randomly allocated to each drug. Doses were increased for 3 weeks to an average of about 6 mg alprazolam, 150 mg imipramine and a corresponding number of placebo capsules, which were then given for 5 weeks. No more than supportive psychotherapy was given. Key symptoms were rated weekly. The drugs were tapered for 4 or 8 weeks and the patients were followed up for 6 months. Compliance at 3 weeks was 95% for alprazolam, 83% for imipramine and 88% for placebo; at 8 weeks 95% for alprazolam, 73% for imipramine and 46% for placebo. At 3 weeks plasma determination showed that the proportion taking diazepam outside the protocol was 0% for alprazolam, 19% for imipramine and 31% for placebo; at 8 weeks the corresponding proportions were 3%, 11% and 16%. Intention-to-treat analysis showed that freedom from panic attacks was obtained for 68% with alprazolam, 61% with imipramine and 34% with placebo. Alprazolam was more effective than imipramine and placebo on anticipatory anxiety and phobic symptoms. Globally rated by physicians and patients, about 60% had complete remission with alprazolam and imipramine and 30% on placebo. At least partial remission was obtained in about 85% with alprazolam, 70% with imipramine and 40% with placebo. Alprazolam had a more rapid onset of action than imipramine on all symptoms. Side effects were generally mild, with a preponderance of drowsiness for alprazolam and anticholinergic effects for imipramine. Tapering was uneventful without significant discontinuation phenomena. During taper and follow-up, several patients in remission relapsed, leaving approximately 30% patients in complete remission in all groups. To obtain more stable improvement, either long-term drug treatment or combinations of drug treatment and psychotherapy should be evaluated.", 
    "7": "Significant differences in diazepam pharmacokinetics in different populations of rats both within one family and within one species were revealed. A high degree of correlation between the pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic indices indicates that the myorelaxant effect is in a direct dependence on diazepam concentration in the rat organism.", 
    "8": "The composition of free fatty acids of lipids in different rat brain structures (the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and midbrain) in neurosis was studied by the gas chromatographic analysis. The difference in their spectra was established. A pronounced increase of arachidonic acid content in the cortex (by 120%, p less than 0.01) and a statistically significant elevation of linolic acid level in all studied structures were noted. The levels of pentadecanoic and myristic acids were also changed. In neurosis diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, 40 minutes before the investigation) produced a decrease in the brain cortex of levels of arachidonic, oleic and myristic acids. In the hippocampus the contents of oleic and myristic acids increased. Less pronounced changes were found in the striatum and midbrain.", 
    "9": "The regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release by the different subtypes of muscarinic (M) receptors in the hippocampus of freely-moving Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats, was investigated. Atropine (10 mumol/kg i.p.) induced a pronounced increase of ACh release (+400% over basal values) in the hippocampus of young rats (3 months) while the effect was drastically reduced (+100% over basal values) in old rats (24 months). The preferential M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 (50 mumol/kg i.p.) showed similar effects in young and old rats being, furthermore, 10 times less potent than atropine. The preferential M1 antagonist pirenzepine (50 mumol/kg i.p.) was even less potent than AF-DX 116 in enhancing ACh release in young rats, while the effect was more pronounced in the old ones. Therefore, the effect of the preferential M3 antagonist 4-DAMP was studied. 4-DAMP 10(-6) M, dissolved in the Ringer solution perfusing the hippocampus, induced an enhancement of ACh release (+200% and +70% over basal values, in young and old rats, respectively) which was comparable to that obtained after atropine at the same concentration. AF-DX 116 and pirenzepine, on the other hand, were by far less potent. Six months' pretreatment with acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR) reduced the significant differences between young and old rats in the release response after M1 and M3 receptor antagonists. Taken all together, these findings indicate that the regulation of ACh release, at least in the hippocampus, is mainly through the M3 receptors subtype of muscarinic receptors and that this subtype is the most involved in the aging process. Moreover, the ability of ALCAR to preserve the receptor-mediated functional ACh release response with respect to old animals suggests that ALCAR could be utilized in the amelioration of receptor functionality in the aging brain.", 
    "10": "Major cohort studies document that the long-term prognosis for most children with febrile convulsions (FC) is excellent. The 2 main treatment alternatives so far have been long-term prophylaxis with phenobarbital or valproate or no prophylaxis at all. Phenobarbital at times of fever is ineffective and obsolete. Consensus has emerged that long-term prophylaxis with antiepileptic drugs is rarely justified in FC considering the side effects and the favourable prognosis. No treatment at all does not appear quite satisfactory either, as FC have a high recurrence rate, disrupt family life and may have emotional consequences for the family. Moreover, all FC children face a risk, although admittedly low, of subsequent long-lasting potentially central nervous system (CNS)-damaging seizures. However, 2 further options exist: treatment with rapid-acting benzodiazepines solely at times of greatest risk, i.e., at high fever or at renewed seizures. Several clinical trials have confirmed that intermittent diazepam prophylaxis by way of a few doses of the drug per year provides effective seizure control and reduces the recurrence rate by one half or two thirds. The treatment is feasible and cheap, well tolerated by the child and well accepted by the parents. Compliance problems are common and only partly abatable. Trivial side effects are frequent. Transient respiratory apnoea does occur, but 15 years' experience substantiates that serious side effects are remarkably rare. Acute anticonvulsant treatment with rectal diazepam in solution given by the parents to stop ongoing seizures and to prevent immediate recurrences is an attractive alternative. It is feasible, is probably effective and minimizes the use of drugs, but compliance problems are common and protracted seizures are not always controlled. The subsequent management should include a risk profile approach considering a combination of risk factors for new FC rather than a single factor. By means of a risk index, based on simple clinical data including age at onset, family seizure history, seizure type and frequency of fever, children may be identified as being at low, intermediate or high risk for further febrile fits. However, risk factors for new FC and not for subsequent epilepsy should be used. It is concluded that preventing or abbreviating new FC with benzodiazepines appears to be a useful, although not ideal, drug-minimizing approach in managing many children with simple or complex FC. From a health hazard viewpoint, treatment is not strictly mandatory, although advisable. A selective strategy seems rational. Intermittent diazepam prophylaxis may preferably be offered to children at high risk for new FC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "11": "Five cases are reported of peroperative awakening in order to obtain patient cooperation during stereotaxic procedures. General anaesthesia was induced with 0.25 mg.kg-1 midazolam, 1.5 to 2 micrograms.kg-1 fentanyl, and 0.1 mg.kg-1 vecuronium. Maintenance was obtained with isoflurane, nitrous oxide, and small doses of fentanyl. Isoflurane inhalation was discontinued 30 to 40 min before the time of awakening required by surgery. Once expiratory isoflurane concentration reached a level less than or equal to 0.1%, nitrous oxide administration was stopped, and 0.5 mg flumazenil administered. After surgical checking, on the fully awake patient of the efficiency of thalamic stimulation and the lack of any motor deficit, anaesthesia was deepened again, with either isoflurane or a non benzodiazepine intravenous agent. All five patients recovered rapidly and calmly.", 
    "12": "The intracerebroventricular injection of the cholecystokinin-A receptor antagonist L-364,718, at the doses of 0.5, 5, 10 or 20 micrograms/mouse, while having no effect on pain threshold (hot plate, 51 degrees C), antagonized the analgesic activity of morphine (10 mg/kg i.p.). This effect was obtained with a dose of 10 micrograms/mouse and was associated with a reduction of brainstem opiate-binding sites.", 
    "13": "Volatile chemicals used widely as solvents can produce acute effects on the nervous system and behavior after inhalation exposure, and many are subject to abuse. This review considers the nature of the acute effects of volatile organic solvents by comparing their actions to those of classical CNS depressant drugs such as the barbiturates, benzodiazepines and ethanol. Like CNS depressant drugs, selected inhalants have been shown to have biphasic effects on motor activity, disrupt psychomotor performance, have anticonvulsant effects, produce biphasic drug-like effects on rates of schedule-controlled operant behavior, increase rates of punished responding, enhance the effects of depressant drugs, serve as reinforcers in self-administration studies and share discriminative stimulus effects with barbiturates and ethanol. Toluene and 1,1,1-trichloroethane, as well as subanesthetic concentrations of halothane, have been the most extensively studied; however, it is unclear whether important differences may exist among solvents in their ability to produce a depressant profile of acute effects. The possibility that selected solvents can have acute effects similar to those of depressant drugs may shed light on the nature of their acute behavioral toxicology and on their abuse.", 
    "14": "The atypical neuroleptic clozapine has clinical and behavioral properties that differ not only from the typical compounds, but also from atypical ones. It interacts with the dopaminergic systems, but also produces effects on the serotoninergic, GABA-ergic, cholinergic systems. In spite of the amount of papers devoted to its study, the profile of the neurochemical action of this drug is still confuse. In this paper we investigated the DA2-, opiate- and benzodiazepine-receptor modifications induced by the long term (21 days) treatment with clozapine 20 mg/kg/day in the rat brain. We found a decrease of DA2 receptor density in the target areas of the mesolimbocortical system (ventral n. caudate-putamen, cerebral cortex except for the anterior cingulate at the most anterior level and the n. accumbens) and a decrease of opiate and benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex and in the olfactory tubercle. Opiate receptors increase in the patches of the striatum. We also compared these effects with those produced by long-term (21 days), low-dosage (0.5 mg/kg day) haloperidol.", 
    "15": "We studied the effects of psychosocial stress (S) and diazepam (D) on plasma lipids, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and corticosterone (B) levels of cockerels fed an atherogenic diet (AD) consisting of 2% cholesterol plus 5% cottonseed oil added to plain mash (PM). Seventy-six eight-week-old DeKalb cockerels were randomly assigned to the following groups: I. PM; II. PM + D; III. PM + S; ;IV. PM + S + D; V. AD; VI. AD + D; VII. AD + S and VIII. AD + S + D. S was induced by housing two birds to a cage and pairing them to a different bird daily. D was administered daily by gavage. Plasma ACTH and B levels were analyzed by RIA. Aortic atherosclerosis was grossly graded on a scale of 0-4 and also by gravimetric planimetry. After 10 weeks: 1. S birds had a significantly higher incidence and severity (p less than 0.04) of aortic atherogenesis and elevated ACTH and B levels (p less than 0.001) compared to unstressed PM groups. 2. AD significantly elevated the plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and the lipoprotein cholesterol that was precipitated by heparin-manganese (LDL-C + VLDL-C), compared to initial and/or PM levels (p less than 0.001). AD birds had a greater incidence and more severe aortic lesions in comparison to PM groups (p less than 0.002). Plasma hormone levels were significantly lower in birds fed AD alone compared to controls and stressed birds. 3. D significantly reduced the severity of aortic atheroma as well as decreased hormone levels in all treated groups (p less than 0.001). Therefore, we conclude that aortic atherosclerosis in cockerels can be induced by S and/or AD, and D can markedly reduce atherogenesis under these conditions. Since both AD and D decreased plasma ACTH and B levels, the anti-atherogenic action of D in these birds does not seem to directly involve these pituitary-adrenocortical hormones.", 
    "16": "A two-lever, food-motivated discrimination was established between the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (5.0 mg/kg) and its vehicle. The FG 7142 discriminative stimulus was pharmacologically characterized by testing trained rats with a variety of benzodiazepine receptor ligands. Administration of the inverse agonist DMCM (0.15-0.30 mg/kg) dose-dependently mimicked the FG 7142 stimulus. In contrast, the benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide, partial agonist ZK 91 296, mixed agonist/antagonist CGS 9896 and antagonist RO 15-1788 blocked the FG 7142 cue. These results indicate that the FG 7142 discriminative stimulus is based on its inverse agonist activity. The generalization of FG 7142 to the anxiogenic/convulsant compound pentylenetetrazole (PTZ), but not to the anorectic agent norfenfluramine, indicates that the anxiogenic properties of FG 7142, rather than its anorectic actions, may underlie the FG 7142 discriminative stimulus.", 
    "17": "The effects of drugs representing three classes of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor-acting agents on circulating corticosterone (CS), noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) were examined in unstressed rats. Intragastric administration of a single-dose of the inverse agonist 3-carbomethoxy-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline (DMCM; 10 mg/kg) evoked 15-, 4- and 1.5-fold increases in plasma CS, A and NA, respectively, as compared to control values. The DMCM-induced CS, A and NA rises were completely blocked by combined treatment with the BDZ antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 20 mg/kg). Flumazenil given alone did not affect plasma hormone levels. Administration (either intragastrically or intraperitoneally) of a single-dose of the BDZ agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 20 mg/kg) produced a 10- to 15-fold increase in plasma CS but caused no change in plasma NA and A contents. Pretreatment with flumazenil blocked the CDP-elicited release of CS. The findings indicate that the CNS mechanisms controlling pituitary-adrenocortical and sympatho-adrenal outflow under basal conditions are functionally linked to central-type BDZ receptor system(s). Drugs with agonist or inverse-agonist actions at these receptor sites can be differentiated from each other by their distinct effects on plasma NA and A, but not CS, release.", 
    "18": "1. The EEG effects of granisetron, a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (160 micrograms kg-1), and lorazepam (2.5 mg) were examined in 12 healthy male volunteers. 2. The results indicated that lorazepam had a marked effect on the CNS, significantly increasing power in the slow (1-7 Hz) and fast (13-20 Hz; 21-30 Hz) wavebands whilst reducing power in the mid range (8-12 Hz). 3. In contrast there was no demonstrable effect of granisetron on the EEG at the dose tested, and no evidence of a pharmacodynamic interaction between the two compounds.", 
    "19": "PK 11195 is a selective ligand for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites which exhibits anti-conflict activity in animals. In a pilot open study, PK 11195 was administered to 10 psychiatric inpatients characterized by a rating of at least \"moderate\" for the item \"felt loss of vitality\" and a rating of at least \"moderate\" for the items \"anxiety\" and/or \"inhibition of drive\" from the psychopathological scale of the system developed by the Association for Methodology and Documentation in Psychiatry (AMDP). The duration of the study was two weeks, with an initial daily dose of 200 mg of PK 11195 which could be increased up to 400 mg. Patients were assessed weekly using the psychopathological and somatic AMDP scales and at days 0, 4, 7, and 14 using the Hamilton anxiety scale and a checklist of symptoms and side-effects. The results showed significant improvement in the AMDP factor scores related to somatic complaints, depression, anxiety, apathy-retardation, and psycho-organic symptoms. However, anxiolytic activity, confirmed on the Hamilton anxiety scale, remained moderate and reached maximum effect after one week. No side-effects, drowsiness in particular, were reported. This study therefore suggests a potential beneficial activity of PK 11195 on anxiety and inhibition, which merits further investigation in controlled studies.", 
    "20": "The protective effects of drugs acting at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex against ethanol-induced gastric damage in rats were investigated. Gastric lesions were induced by administration of 1 ml absolute ethanol orally to rats. Administration of clonazepam (0.625-2.5 mg/kg, IP), which binds with high affinity to the benzodiazepine binding site of the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or Ro 5-3663 (2.5 or 5 mg/kg), which binds to the piorotoxinin site of the receptor complex, protected against ethanol-induced gastric damage. The protective effect of clonazepam (1.25 mg/kg, IP) against ethanol-induced gastric damage was reversed, dose dependently, by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (5-20 mg/kg, IP). This protective effect of clonazepam or Ro 5-3663 seems to be specific to ethanol-induced gastric damage, since neither drug protected against indomethacin-induced gastric damage. These results present for the first time evidence of the involvement of drugs acting at GABA-benzodiazepine receptors in protection against ethanol-induced gastric damage.", 
    "21": "Peripheral benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors are located in a variety of tissues, including platelets, in the nuclear and/or mitochondrial membranes. We studied the density of peripheral BDZ receptors in platelets of 10 de novo Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, 18 PD patients treated with a levodopa/carbidopa combination, and in 15 healthy subjects matched for sex and age. The binding assay was conducted using [3H]PK 11195, a specific ligand for peripheral BDZ receptors. A significant decrease in the density of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites has been observed in PD patients with respect to controls (p less than 0.01), but not between de novo and treated PD patients. No correlation has been found between the decrease in density of [3H]PK 11195 binding sites in platelets and either the duration or severity of PD. Peripheral BDZ receptors are implicated in the regulation of mitochondrial respiratory function. Thus, their decrease in PD might parallel the abnormalities in mitochondrial function recently found in this neurologic disease.", 
    "22": "1. The effect of the benzodiazepines Ro5-4864, AHN 086 and clonazepam on the release of Ca2+ from rat heart and kidney mitochondria was studied. 2. The peripheral-type benzodiazepines Ro5-4864 and AHN 086 induced Ca2+ release which was blocked by Mg2+ whereas the central-type benzodiazepine clonazepam was ineffective. 3. An associated collapse of membrane potential and swelling were also induced by AHN 086 in the presence of Ca2+. 4. However, no oxidation of pyridine nucleotides or increased rate or respiration were observed. 5. Release of Sr2+ was induced by AHN 086 in the absence of inorganic phosphate but not in its presence. 6. These data are discussed in the context of the current hypotheses on the mechanism of mitochondrial Ca2+ release.", 
    "23": "In primates, treatment with scopolamine impairs performance of a spatial delayed response task in a way which mimics deficits seen spontaneously in aged primates and demented patients. Despite their efficacy in reversing scopolamine induced disruption, the effects of cholinergic agonists on cognition in aged primates and dements are unimpressive, suggesting that other neurotransmitter systems are also involved in this type of deficit. We have induced a scopolamine-like impairment of spatial delayed response performance in rhesus monkeys using phencyclidine (0.1-0.2 mg/kg i.m.), lorazepam (0.4-0.6 mg/kg s.c.) or tetrahydrocannabinol (1-4 mg/kg p.o.), but not amphetamine (0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.m.), yohimbine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.m.) or morphine (2-4 mg/kg i.m.). Our findings suggest that disruption of specific neurotransmitter systems other than acetylcholine may contribute importantly to cognitive decline in aging and dementia.", 
    "24": "The anticonvulsants diazepam (1-10 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (30-100 mg/kg) protected against lethality without altering clonic convulsions induced by 75 mg/kg cocaine (CD100) in male Swiss Webster mice. In contrast, the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, MK-801 (dizocilpine) and phencyclidine, produced dose-dependent protection against cocaine convulsions. The competitive NMDA antagonists, CPP and NPC 12626, were also anti-convulsant, without producing the behavioral disturbances associated with non-competitive antagonists. Diazepam and phenobarbital protected against convulsions induced by 60 mg/kg cocaine (90% convulsions alone). Compounds that act at the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor of the NMDA receptor complex, ACPC and 7-chlorokynurinic acid, also protected against convulsions induced by 60 mg/kg cocaine. In contrast, the non-opioid antitussive anticonvulsants (dextromethorphan, caramiphen, and carbetapentane) were not active against either dose of cocaine. The efficacy of compounds as antagonists of the convulsant effects of cocaine and NMDA appear related. These results suggest a potential role for the NMDA receptor complex in the convulsant actions of cocaine and new molecular targets for drug discovery in treating cocaine toxicity.", 
    "25": "Inhibitory effects of diazepam and flunitrazepam on the superoxide anion (O2-)-generating system in granulocytes were examined for their clinical relevance. When the effects of commercial solutions and pure preparations were compared using porcine and human polymorphonuclear leucocytes in vitro, the solutions were found to be more inhibitory than the pure drugs by 4-11 times, indicating that inhibition was caused mainly by the additives in the solutions. Concentrations of the additives required for 50% maximal inhibition of the system were 2.3, 7.5 and 0.9 microliters ml-1 for propylene glycol, ethanol and diazepam and flunitrazepam were 220 and 190 micrograms ml-1, respectively, under comparable conditions. However, plasma concentrations of the benzodiazepines and their additives during clinical use were far less than these inhibitory concentrations, indicating that they had no appreciable effect on the O2(-)-generating system in polymorphonuclear leucocytes of patients.", 
    "26": "The density of bovine peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in four tissues was highest in adrenal cortex. The adrenal cortex PBR cofractionated with a mitochondrial membrane marker enzyme and could be solubilized with intact ligand binding properties using digitonin. The membrane bound and soluble mitochondrial receptors were pharmacologically characterized and showed the rank order of potency to inhibit [3H]PK 11195 binding was PK 11195 greater than protoporphyrin IX greater than benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam, or Ro5-4864). [3H]PK 11195 binding to bovine adrenal mitochondria was unaffected by diethylpyrocarbonate, a histidine residue modifying reagent that decreased binding to rat liver mitochondria by 70%. [3H]PK 14105 photolabeled the bovine PBR and the Mr was estimated under nondenaturing (200 kDa) and denaturing (17 kDa) conditions. These results demonstrate the bovine peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor is pharmacologically and biochemically distinct from the rat receptor, but the receptor component photolabeled by an isoquinoline ligand has a similar molecular weight.", 
    "27": "Investigation of tricyclic heterocycles related to the 2-arylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-ones, structures with high affinity for the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor, led to the synthesis of 2-phenyl-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5(6H)-one, a compound with 4 nM binding affinity to the BZ receptor. Analogues were prepared to assess the importance of the 2-substituent and ring substitution in modifying activity. Several novel synthetic routes were designed to prepare the target compounds, including a two-step synthesis beginning with an anthranilonitrile and a hydrazide. Of the 34 compounds screened in this series, three compounds were found to be potent BZ antagonists in rat models. The leading compound, 9-chloro-2-(2-fluorophenyl) [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5- c]quinazolin-5(6H)-one (CGS 16228), showed activity comparable to that of CGS 8216 from the pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinoline series.", 
    "28": "Benzodiazepine discontinuation can lead to a behavioral syndrome in animals and humans. In a mouse model, this syndrome is associated with benzodiazepine receptor up-regulation. The protein-modifying reagent, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), has been used to irreversibly inactivate a number of neurotransmitter receptors including benzodiazepine receptors, and thus allows estimation of receptor recovery in vivo. To assess benzodiazepine receptor recovery after benzodiazepine discontinuation, we treated mice with lorazepam (LRZ), 2 mg.kg-1.day-1 for 1 wk. After 24 h, EEDQ (12.5 mg/kg) was administered, and benzodiazepine binding in the cortex and cerebellum was determined after 4-144 h. EEDQ treatment decreased receptor density in the cortex in both LRZ- and vehicle-treated groups by approximately 50%, with no change in apparent affinity as previously reported. Binding in both groups returned to control values after 96 h. Kinetic analysis indicated a more rapid increase in binding in LRZ-compared with vehicle-treated animals, with t1/2 for LRZ 19.1 h, and for vehicle, 30.8 h (P less than 0.05). Receptor density was decreased in the cerebellum after EEDQ by approximately 40% in both treatment groups, with no change in apparent affinity. Receptor density returned to control values at 96 h, with no difference in kinetics in LRZ- compared with vehicle-treated mice. The decrease in receptor t1/2 associated with lorazepam discontinuation is consistent with the observed increase in benzodiazepine receptors in this setting.", 
    "29": "Methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and flumazenil (Ro15-1788) are known to be respectively an inverse agonist and an antagonist of the central benzodiazepine-receptor. Surprisingly, these two drugs have shown a similar enhancing effect in a negatively reinforced multiple-trial brightness discrimination task in mice. Thus, to evaluate the role of anxiety in this task, the action of these two drugs were compared in the same learning task with a positive or a negative reinforcement. Mice were trained for sessions of ten trials per day for six consecutive days. The sessions during the first three days took place after administration of beta-CCM (0.3 mg/kg), flumazenil (15 mg/kg) or vehicles of these drugs. A negative reinforcement (electric foot-shock) was used in a first experiment, and a positive one (food reward) in a second experiment. Results showed that, whatever the reinforcement, the two drugs enhance learning in a brightness discrimination task. The hypothesis is that flumazenil could have an inverse agonist profile in learning tasks. The question remains as to whether the flumazenil enhancing learning process results from increased arousal and/or anxiogenic factors, or from a negative modulatory influence of endogenous diazepam-like ligands for benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "30": "[3H]PK 11195 binding to platelet membranes and plasma stress hormones were studied in soldiers at the beginning of a parachute training course, following 6 days of preparatory exercises, and after the fourth actual parachute jump. A slight reduction (15%; NS) in the number of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) was detected at the end of the exercise period, prior to the first jump. Reduced (26%; P less than 0.05) density of PBR was observed immediately after the repeated actual jumps. Equilibrium dissociation constants were not affected by the stressful situation. Plasma cortisol and prolactin levels remained unaltered during the entire study period.", 
    "31": "Early developmental exposure to diazepam (DZ) via administration of the drug to the pregnant rat (1.0 or 2.5 mg/kg) over gestational days 14 to 20 altered both behavior of adult progeny on two tests of anxiety and function of the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor complex (a neural substrate of anxiety-related behavior) in a sexually dimorphic manner. Adult male rats (60-90 days) exposed in utero to DZ spent significantly more time on the open arm of the elevated plus-maze than male rats exposed to vehicle, whereas plus-maze performance in female rats was unaffected by the early drug exposure. Similarly, early exposure to DZ markedly altered environment-specific social interaction in male rats, leading to increased social interaction in the unfamiliar environment and decreased social interaction in the familiar environment. Social interaction in adult female rats is not normally environment-specific; however, female rats exposed in utero to DZ at 2.5 mg/kg demonstrated a significant effect of the novel environment on social interaction, thus responding like unmanipulated male rats. The sensitivity of GABA-mediated 36chloride uptake to GABA was enhanced in synaptoneurosomes from male rats exposed in utero to DZ at 2.5 mg/kg and early exposure to either dose of DZ prevented the facilitative effect of DZ added in vitro on GABA-mediated chloride uptake. Function of the receptor complex was not altered in female rats by early DZ exposure. Thus, perinatal insults at the molecular level may underlie gender-related behavioral disorders in the young adult.", 
    "32": "Significant differences were demonstrated between the long-sleep (LS) and short-sleep (SS) selected mouse lines in the abilities of barbiturates and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) to inhibit t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) binding to well-washed cerebral cortical membranes. Thus, using phenobarbital to initiate the dissociation of [35S]TBPS, the extent of inhibition was significantly greater in LS mice (but not SS mice) than would be predicted using equilibrium conditions. Pentobarbital had the opposite effect, causing [35S]TBPS to dissociate to a greater extent in SS than LS membranes. [35S]TBPS binding was dissociated from LS and SS membranes by GABA to a greater and lesser extent, respectively, than would be predicted from equilibrium studies. Because no line differences in the potencies of these drugs to inhibit [35S]TBPS binding were found using equilibrium conditions, these results indicate that the association rates of barbiturates and GABA may be different between these lines. These findings are consistent with neurochemical studies indicating differences in the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor-chloride channel complex in these selected lines and may explain their differential sensitivities to certain agents acting through this supramolecular complex.", 
    "33": "The effect of volatile anesthetics on benzodiazepine receptor binding was examined autoradiographically in the rat brain both in vivo and in vitro with the use of [3H]-Ro-15-1788, a benzodiazepine antagonist. For in vitro studies, slide-mounted brain sections were incubated at 37 degrees C in Tris buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) with [3H]-Ro-15-1788 (flumazenil, 0.5-12.0 nM) in the presence of air (control) or 1 MAC concentrations of halothane or isoflurane. Brain sections were exposed to x-ray film and their images digitized, and specific cortical [3H]-Ro-15-1788 binding was determined. A Scatchard plot of specific cortical binding was constructed, and the dissociation constant (KD) and maximum bound ligand per milligram tissue (Bmax) were determined for each experimental group. In the in vivo trials, rats were anesthetized with 1 MAC halothane or isoflurane; 0.5 microCi/g [3H]-Ro-15-1788 was given intravenously, and the animals were killed 15 min later. Seven standardized sagittal brain sections were examined from autoradiographs. Mean specific cortical binding was determined for each group and was compared with binding in unanesthetized control rats. A third experimental trial analyzed the timed arterial blood history of [3H]-Ro-15-1788 in animals prepared exactly as in the in vivo study. The [3H]-Ro-15-1788 blood clearance over 20 min and plasma [3H]-Ro-15-1788 levels at 15 min after injection of isotope were evaluated. In vitro Scatchard analysis showed no difference in experimental groups in KD or Bmax at 37 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "The binding characteristics of gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptors and the kinetic characteristics of the target enzyme of GABA synthesis in nerve terminals, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), were studied in a dog model of portal-systemic encephalopathy obtained by porta-caval shunt performed in dimethylnitrosamine pretreated animals. Furthermore the properties of dopamine receptors and the levels of catecholamines of encephalopathic dogs were investigated. The mild stage of encephalopathy was characterized by an up-regulation of the inhibitory GABA-A receptors probably related to a decrese of GABA in nerve terminals since GAD was decreased and by a slight decrease of catecholamines and by an increased synthesis of octopamine associated with a decreased affinity of dopamine receptors. In the severe stage there was a selection of high affinity GABA-A receptors with an increased number of benzodiazepine recognition sites which were supersensitive to GABA stimulation, a decreased number of Dopamine D-2 receptors and a marked reduction of catecholamines. These data seem to suggest that the neurological disturbances of experimental portal-systemic encephalopathy might be the result of an imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory systems leading to a prevalence of the first one.", 
    "35": "An ability to predict the metabolic fate of a drug is important to drug design. Programs for predicting drug metabolites are becoming available, as are databases that will facilitate the development of such programs. Objective analysis of the performance of these programs will require statistical methods. The development of appropriate statistical methods must address a fundamental data representation problem that arises from the fact that the basic metabolic information uses chemical graph representations rather than the usual vector representations that typify statistical methodology. This study addresses the representation problem by using concepts arising from molecular similarity analysis. The statistical methods that are developed are illustrated by evaluating the performance of MetabolExpert in predicting the metabolic fate of benzodiazepines.", 
    "36": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is far from inert in terms of its cerebral effects. It can increase the cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen in animals and in man. In poor risks patients, the N2O may increase the intracranial pressure (ICP) but these effects are blocked by hyperventilation, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and narcotics. N2O is not epileptogenic but modifies evoked potentials. Because of its greater solubility than Nitrogen it can increase ICP, in case of pneumoencephalus and the size and consequences of gazous embolism. In neurosurgical patients, nitrous oxide should be used cautiously in regards of its neurological effects.", 
    "37": "For the induction of anesthesia in neurosurgical patients, the choice between thiopental and midazolam cannot be done on the basis of their respective cardiovascular, respiratory or cerebral effects, since they are similar. Among the advantages of midazolam are the absence of histamine release and excitatory effects. On the contrary the onset and the duration of action as well as the intensity of sedation are less predictable with midazolam when compared to thiopental. Therefore thiopental remains the first drug of choice in this clinical setting. For preoperative sedation in neurosurgical patients, the use of benzodiazepines should be limited, since they can induce respiratory depression mainly in patients with cranial trauma or with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The preoperative administration of a benzodiazepine in neurosurgical patients who are under chronic treatment should be decided individually, according to the level of the conscience of the patient and on the half life of the drug.", 
    "38": "Continuous intravenous sedation is often used during the intensive treatment of severe head injury. Hypnotic agents may prevent or treat the brief episodes of intracranial hypertension associated with nociceptive stimuli. However there is yet no clinical data in the literature showing beneficial effects of continuous sedation on intracranial pressure control or outcome in severe head injured patients. Sedation should be primarily administered to allow good conditions for intensive treatment. Benzodiazepines are sedatives with limited systemic side effects. Midazolam is very convenient because its short duration of action allows reasonable recovery time following prolonged administration. The abrupt reversal of sedation by means of specific antagonists may induce significant elevation of cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure and should be avoided.", 
    "39": "The effect of a single intravenous dose of pirenzepine on ventilatory indices of 22 asthmatics was studied. The following were assessed: FVC, FEV1, FEF50, FEF25-75, Raw, heart rate (HR) prior administration and after 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after receiving 10 mg of pirenzepine. A statistical significant decrease of airflow resistance was seen in control and mild asthmatics (lowering of Raw, FEF25-75). Also an increase of FEV1 was seen in both asthmatic groups. In all patients a decrease of HR was seen.", 
    "40": "The influence on cerebral hemodynamics of drugs given to infants less than 32 gestational weeks, at high risk for intracerebral hemorrhage, can be easily assessed by pulsed Doppler technique. We report on our studies in these infants who were treated with the following drugs: diazepam (0.5 mg/kg BW i.v.), pethidine (1 mg/kg BW i.v.), pancuronium bromide (0.1 mg/kg BW i.v.), phenobarbitone (loading dose = 20 mg/kg BW, maintenance dose 5 mg/kg BW i.v.), theophylline (loading dose = 6 mg/kg BW, maintenance dose = 1.5 mg/kg BW i.v.) and bovine surfactant SF-RI 1 (50 mg/kg BW intratracheally). All studied drugs proved to be safe at the administered dosage with regard to their influence on cerebral hemodynamics in very immature infants.", 
    "41": "Two types of benzodiazepines were used in premedication of flexible bronchoscopy. The agents were introduced in randomized, double-blind trial. Midazolam (Dormicum Hoffmann-La Roche AG) was given to 21 patients (0.07 mg/kg i.v.), diazepam (Seduxen Richter) to 22 patients (0.14 mg/kg i.v.) and placebo (saline) to 20 patients (0.07 ml/kg i.v.). Vigility, motor functions and anxiety were estimated from the application to 3 hours after endoscopy. Breathing, pulse rate, blood pressure and local reactions were followed as well. The course of bronchoscopy, anterograde amnesia and acceptability of further intervention were evaluated. Midazolam offered short term action, stronger sedative and anxiolytic effect than diazepam (48% to 27%). The anterograde amnesia was more frequent (90.5% to 55% in diazepam), acceptability of further bronchoscopy after midazolam was present in 95% of patients, after diazepam in 86% of patients. These favourable properties can be utilized especially in cases with enhanced anxiety and necessity of further endoscopies.", 
    "42": "The effect of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron and MDL 72,222, against various behaviours elicited by naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal were examined. Rats made dependent upon morphine by the subcutaneous implantation of a 75 mg pellet, when challenged with naloxone (0.5 mg/kg SC), 3 or 4 days later exhibited a wide range of behaviours including wet dog shakes, paw shakes, salivation and a marked weight loss. Pre-treatment with ondansetron (0.01-1 mg/kg SC) or MDL 72,222 (1-3 mg/kg SC) failed to affect the incidence of these responses except weight loss, which was attenuated by both treatments. At doses similar to and below those required to elicit the withdrawal syndrome, naloxone produced a single-trial place aversion in morphine dependent rats. The place aversion produced by naloxone (0.05 mg/kg SC) was antagonized by pre-treatment of ondansetron (0.1-1 mg/kg SC) and MDL 72,222 (1 mg/kg SC) prior to conditioning. Chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg IP) but not gepirone (3-10 mg/kg SC) was similarly effective. It is concluded that 5-HT3 antagonists may attenuate some but not all behavioural signs associated with morphine withdrawal. Reasons for this apparent selectivity are discussed.", 
    "43": "l-Tetrahydroberberine-d-camphor sulfonate (THB-CS) possessed an inhibitory effect on apomorphine-induced chewing movement in a similar manner to that of tetrahydroberberine (THB). Both compounds enhanced barbiturate-induced hypnosis. They did not have an anticonvulsant effect on convulsive seizures induced by bicuculline, pentetrazole or strychnine. THB and THB-CS blocked dopamine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These compounds showed almost equipotent affinities to dopamine D1 (3H-SCH-23390) and D2 (3H-spiperone) receptors but did not have significant affinity to mu-opioid, muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, and benzodiazepine binding sites. Furthermore, both compounds did not elicit cataleptogenic behavior, even at very high doses. These data suggest that THB and THB-CS have a central depressant effect through both D1 and D2 dopaminergic receptors and may have different modes of action from that of standard neuroleptics.", 
    "44": "Possible involvement of dopamine receptors in diazepam-induced (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous (sc] hyperphagia was studied in nondeprived rats. Pretreatment with the selective D-1 antagonist, SCH23390 (0.03 mg/kg, sc) inhibited diazepam-induced hyperphagia. In addition, pretreatment with the preferential D-2 antagonists, haloperidol (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg, sc) and clebopride (0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg, sc) inhibited diazepam-induced hyperphagia in a dose-dependent manner. Pretreatment with co-administration of SCH23390 (0.1 mg/kg, sc) and clebopride (0.03 mg/kg, sc) completely inhibited this hyperphagia. The selective D-2 antagonist, sulpiride (40 mg/kg, sc) and the peripheral D-2 antagonist, domperidone (10 mg/kg, sc) did not affect diazepam-induced hyperphagia. However, sulpiride (10 micrograms, icv) or domperidone (2 micrograms, icv) administered centrally inhibited this hyperphagia. The highest dose of haloperidol (0.3 mg/kg, sc) or clebopride (0.3 mg/kg, sc) and higher doses of SCH23390 (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, sc) or SCH23390/clebopride (0.01/0.03 and 0.01/0.1 mg/kg, sc) tended to decrease spontaneous feeding in non-deprived rats. In addition, the highest dose of haloperidol, clebopride or SCH23390/clebopride inhibited spontaneous feeding in deprived rats. Interestingly, diazepam-induced hyperphagia was inhibited significantly by doses of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, sc), clebopride (0.1 mg/kg, sc) and SCH23390/clebopride (0.003/0.03 and 0.003/0.1 mg/kg, sc) which did not affect spontaneous feeding in non-deprived or deprived rats. Pretreatment with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (40 mg/kg, IP x 2, 6 and 2 h prior to diazepam administration) failed to inhibit this hyperphagia. Furthermore, pretreatment with a large dose of haloperidol (5 mg/kg, sc, 4 days before diazepam administration) augmented the sub-hyperphagic effect to diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, sc). Thus, these findings suggest that hyperphagia to diazepam is mediated in part by both dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors in non-deprived rats.", 
    "45": "In order to establish the clinical validity of currently used ways of subtyping panic disorder the predictive power of associated current avoidance behaviour and (secondary) major depression for the response to active treatment (alprazolam, imipramine) was tested. The analysis was based on the data from the Cross-National-Collaborative-Panic-Study. Limited support for validity evidenced by predicting drug response was found for grading panic disorder by the severity of avoidance behaviour; patients with panic attacks and agoraphobia are more responsive to imipramine (compared with alprazolam) when using the reduction of the total number of panic attacks (or of spontaneous panic attacks) as the outcome criterion; patients without any avoidance behaviour did better with alprazolam (compared with imipramine).", 
    "46": "In 52 patients 0.5-3.0 ml of iohexol, 180 mg/ml, was injected using lateral injection technique and fluoroscopy control. A total of 146 lumbar discs using local anaesthesia was injected. Two types of premedication were used; either diazepam alone or diazepam in combination with pethidine and glycopyrronium bromide. There was no difference in the discography injection pain between the groups (X2 = 0.774, P greater than 0.05]. During discography, some patients had nausea (2%), convulsions (4%), back pain (6%) and hypotension (10%), but no allergic reactions were seen. This suggests that these immediate reactions are more related to the procedure itself than to the non-ionic ratio 3.0 iohexol contrast medium. More troublesome iatrogenic complications were seen the day after the discography in the form of severe headache (10%) probably related to liquor leakage, and increasing low back pain (81%). The latter may be caused by local haematoma or chemical irritation from iohexol. Patients with no pain during injection had a relatively slight need for analgesics (Somer's D = -0.196, P less than 0.05).", 
    "47": "The potential antagonism of a single oral dose of RU 41 656 (10 mg) on the memory and attention disturbances induced by oral administration of triazolam (0.25 mg) have been investigated in a 3-period, placebo controlled, double blind, cross-over study involving 12 healthy young volunteers. The effects of the compounds were evaluated by objective tests (Buschke selective reminding test, CFF, simple reaction time, tapping, arithmetical calculation) and subjective measurements (visual analogue scale, side effects questionnaire). Measurements were taken before treatment and 2, 4 and 7 h after RU 41 656 intake. Triazolam caused anterograde amnesia as already described with other benzodiazepine with few sedative effects at this dosage. Under the experimental conditions of the trial, RU 41 656 failed to counteract the memory deficits induced by triazolam.", 
    "48": "Buspirone reduces anxiety clinically but, unlike classical anxiolytics, is not muscle relaxant, sedative, anticonvulsant or effective in increasing GABA function. The basis for its clinical action is not known, but action at both dopamine D2 and serotonin1A receptors has been suggested. Buspirone, like classical anxiolytics, produces a general reduction in the frequency of hippocampal rhythmical slow activity elicited by stimulation of the midbrain in the rat. Methysergide (3 mg/kg i.p.), GR38032F (0.3 mg/kg i.p.) and haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg and 2.0 mg/kg i.p.) failed to block this effect of buspirone (10 mg/kg i.p.). Apomorphine (0.3 mg/kg i.p.) had minor effects, but did not produce a general reduction in frequency. Pindolol (2 mg/kg i.p.) produced a small reduction in frequency itself. In the presence of pindolol, buspirone was without effect, while the effect of chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg i.p.) was potentiated. These results show that: (a) the similar effects of buspirone and classical anxiolytics such as chlordiazepoxide on reticular-elicited hippocampal rhythmical slow activity are achieved through different mechanisms; (b) the effects of buspirone in this particular test are more likely to depend on its interaction with serotonin1A receptors than its interaction with D2 receptors; and (c) that, as in other tests, buspirone does not act via serotonin2 or serotonin3 receptors.", 
    "49": "The relevance of the chronology between panic disorder and avoidance behavior and of an early, medium or late onset of panic disorder was tested. Groups from the sample of the cross-national collaborative panic study (CNCPS) were compared for differences in basic characteristics and for the ability to predict treatment response. Patients who developed avoidance behavior before the full syndrome of panic disorder had less often a full agoraphobia but were not different in their response to treatment. Patients with an early onset of panic disorder suffered more often from agoraphobia. The treatment response was similar in the groups with early, medium or late onset of panic disorder. Neither the chronology between panic disorder and avoidance behavior nor the age of onset of panic disorder predicted outcome in short-term treatment with alprazolam or imipramine.", 
    "50": "In order to investigate the role of the dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) area in the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines male Wistar rats (N = 10), weighing 200-250 g at the time of surgery, were microinjected into this structure with midazolam (80 nmol) and submitted to the elevated plus-maze, an ethologically based model of anxiety. Midazolam significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries from 32.4 +/- 4.6 (control) to 49.5 +/- 3.0 and of time spent in the open arms from 21.0 +/- 4.5 (control) to 35.6 +/- 4.8 without affecting the total number of entries into either open or enclosed arms. This effect typifies an anxiolytic effect in the test and was antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (80 nmol) microinjected into the same site 10 min before the midazolam (80 nmol) microinjection. Microinjection of flumazenil alone had no effect. These results provide additional evidence for the participation of the DPAG in the physiopathology of anxiety and suggest that it may be a site for the anxiolytic effect of systemically injected benzodiazepines.", 
    "51": "1. We examined the effect, in rats, of an intraseptal microinjection of fasciculin (FAS), an irreversible peptide acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor, on a) AChE activity measured in septum and hippocampus, b) 3H-quinuclidinyl benzylate (3H-QNB) and 3H-oxotremorine (3H-OXO) binding to hippocampal cholinergic muscarinic receptors, c) 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FNZ) binding to hippocampal benzodiazepine receptors as a control for QNB and OXO binding, d) acquisition and retention in three different behavioral paradigms, i.e., water-finding (in which there is concomitant habituation to the apparatus), step-down inhibitory avoidance, and shuttle avoidance. 2. AChE activity in septum decreased 2 days (-66%) and 5 days (-48%) after FAS microinjection; a slight reduction (-35%) occurred in the dorsal hippocampus on day 2 (P less than 0.05; N = 6 per group); no changes in AChE activity were observed in ventral hippocampus on day 2 or day 5. 3. No changes in 3H-QNB, 3H-OXO, or 3H-FNZ binding constants were demonstrable in the hippocampus either 2 or 5 days after intraseptal FAS administration. 4. No changes in training or test session performance in any of the three behavioral situations were observed 2-3 days after the intraseptal microinjection of FAS. 5. The persistent inhibition of septal AChE caused by FAS microinjection into the septum is not sufficient to induce major changes either in hippocampal cholinergic muscarinic receptors, or in the learning or retention of behaviors regulated by the septum and/or hippocampus.", 
    "52": "The objective of the studies was to examine the influence of sedatives drugs: Relanium and Fenactil on clinical parameters, blood pressure, blood composition, acid-base balance, arterial blood oxygenation, electrolytes, bilirubin and activity of enzymes in sera of sheep. Basing on these data the more effective drug for sedation in sheep has been chosen. It was found that intravenous injection of Relanium at a dose of 1 mg/kg b.w. enables an appropriate sedation with immobilisation lasting for 20 minutes, whereas Fenactil at a dose of 3 mg/kg b.w. injected intravenously caused a sedation of a various intensity lasting for about 20 minutes. Moreover, Fenactil revealed a depressive action in the respiratory center which was manifested by decrease in oxygenation of arterial blood and disturbances in acid-base balance. Relanium affected these parameters only slightly. The disturbances developing after Fenactil were more intense and long lasting. On the basis of the above data--Relanium (diazepam) appeared to be more convenient that Fenactil to sedation in sheep.", 
    "53": "The aim of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of diazepam in normal rats and rats with a carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic cirrhosis after intravenous and oral administration of the drug (4 mg/Kg). When animals are pretreated with this hepatotoxic agent, a significant prolongation in plasma half-life of diazepam is observed, due more to an increase in volume of distribution rather than to a decrease in clearance. Our findings confirm that diazepam is highly extracted by the liver of the rat. This parameter is not affected by the hepatotoxic agent, but probably there is a saturation of the hepatic enzyme activity when the drug is orally administered at the dose of 4 mg/Kg. Diazepam binds to a high degree to plasma proteins in normal and damaged rats, though in the last case a significant increase in the unbound fraction of drug in plasma is observed. Pretreatment of rats with Cl4C does not produce any change in distribution of diazepam into erythrocytes.", 
    "54": "Pharmacokinetics of Prazepam and 14C-Prazepam were studied in rat. Prazepam was measured in blood and plasma by a gas-liquid chromatography assay with an electron capture detector. Its major metabolite, Desmethyldiazepam, was also determined in blood in the same way. Total radioactivity was measured in plasma by scintillation spectrometry. Pharmacokinetic analysis were carried out by two ways; according to compartmental pharmacokinetic models and by statistic moments.", 
    "55": "An algebraic deconvolution procedure adopted from the literature has been used to estimate the absorption profiles of rectally administered midazolam (0.3 mg/kg) in 8 healthy subjects. The extent of absorption estimated by the conventional AUC approach has previously been published and was compared to the deconvolution results. In the original study the sampling period was 840 min. When a deconvolution approach is used there may be no need to sample after the absorption is completed. Thus in this communication only samples drawn within the first 120 min and 300 min were used. The bioavailability estimated by the AUC ratio (mean 0.52 +/- SDrel 16%) is compared to the deconvolution results obtained using only data points within 120 (0.46 +/- 22%) (p = 0.02) and 300 min (0.51 +/- 20%) (p = 0.6) after drug administration. The absorption is almost complete after 120 min. Regarding the absorption rates 40% (range 27.55%) of the dose is absorbed after 60 min. The relative (normalised) absorption profiles showed that 79% (range 63-90%) of the maximum absorbed amount is absorbed within 60 min.",

The algorithm used is relative easy to implement and is very easy to use with polyexponential parameters obtained by curve fitting as input.", 
    "57": "The effect of intrathecal administration of antiepileptic drugs on electroshock-induced convulsions (maximal electroshock seizure, MES test) was investigated in an experimental study in rats. Drugs tested were phenobarbital sodium (50-800 micrograms), sodium valproate (50-6,400 micrograms) and midazolam (50-250 micrograms), delivered into the cerebrospinal fluid via a catheter placed in the upper cervical intrathecal space. Control animals were tested with saline. The animals were tested in the MES test 30 min after drug administration. Phenobarbital sodium showed a dose-related protective effect on the tonic phase of the convulsion, with a 50% effect at a dose of 200 micrograms. Sodium valproate showed a less protective effect, even when reaching doses that produced neurological symptoms. Midazolam protected at a high dose but produced a severe decrease in motor activity. The results indicate the feasibility to treat experimental convulsions by means of intrathecal injection of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "58": "Benzodiazepines are generally well tolerated (compared to barbiturates or antidepressants, their side-effects are milder). They may be used safely, their toxicity is low. Benzodiazepine overdosage may be lethal only if the drug is taken simultaneously with other drugs or alcohol. They act primarily through inhibiting the GABA system, their anxiolytic and sedative effects are of primary importance from the psychiatric aspect. Their classification is based on the difference in their receptor affinity (potency) and kinetics. Derivatives of low, medium and high potency are known. The introduction of high potency benzodiazepines in psychiatry has increased the therapeutic means. The major field of indication of benzodiazepine therapy is DSM-III anxiety disorders and insomnias but they may be successfully used in the treatment of manic conditions, schizophrenia, delirium tremens, clinical conditions accompanied by anxiety-depression, acute restlessness, neuroleptic-induced acute distonias, and akathisias. Even if therapeutic doses are used, tolerance to benzodiazepines may develop after some weeks of therapy. The general withdrawal symptoms are not severe, but the rebound symptoms often hinder the discontinuance of the drug or the reduction of doses. When prescribing benzodiazepines the risk of long-term therapy and the prevention of the development of drug addiction have to be considered.",

The determination of nitrazepam in blood plasma can be carried out directly by measurement at 402 nm in the fourth order derivative spectra with a limit of detection of 1.5 micrograms ml-1. Clonazepam can be determined directly in urine samples at 384 nm by using sixth order derivative spectra with a limit of detection of 1 microgram ml-1 and in blood plasma by using fourth order derivative spectra at 384 nm with a limit of detection of 0.5 ppm.", 
    "60": "Forty-four patients with chronic cervical osteoarthritis took part in this study. Patients were treated with acupuncture, sham-acupuncture, diazepam or placebo-diazepam in randomized order. Pain was rated on visual analogue scales before, during, and after treatment. Two scales were separately used to rate the intensity (sensory component) and the unpleasantness (affective component) of pain. The results analyzed from these trials show that diazepam, placebo-diazepam, acupuncture and sham-acupuncture have a more pronounced effect on the affective than on the sensory component of pain. Acupuncture was significantly more effective than placebo-diazepam (p less than 0.05), but not significantly more effective than diazepam or sham-acupuncture.", 
    "61": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a lentivirus which replicates within critical cells of the immune system, particularly CD4+ T-cells and monocyte/macrophages, leading to a progressive loss of helper T-cells and profound immunosuppression. This condition is known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). A rational screening strategy was adopted to evaluate new anti-HIV agents. Primary in vitro evaluation of antiviral compounds and studies of the relationship between structure and antiviral activity were carried out in a CD4+ T-cell line (MT-4). These cells develop a cytopathic effect (CPE) within a few days after infection. Initially, protection against the HIV-induced cytopathic effect as well as the MT-4 host cell cytotoxicity was determined by a highly automated evaluation system. Promising lead compounds emerging from these studies were then further investigated for their anti-HIV properties in other target cells and against different HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains. This strategy allowed the identification of several potent and selective inhibitors of HIV replication in vitro. Following the 3'-azidothymidine (AZT) lead, we synthesized and evaluated other 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogues with modifications in the base and/or sugar moiety. Based on their selectivity indexes in vitro, several congeners of this group, including 2',3'-thymidine (ddeThd, D4T) and 5-chloro-3'-fluoro-2',3'-dideoxyuridine (FddClUrd), seem at least as promising as AZT. From a series of phosphonylmethoxyalkylpurines and -pyrimidines, 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) and 9-(2-phosphonylmethoxyethyl)-2,6-diaminopurine (PMEDAP) emerged as a new class of broad-spectrum anti-retrovirus agents. Sulfated polysaccharides and sulfated polymers represent another class of compounds achieving high therapeutic indexes in vitro. Comparative studies allowed to define the structural requirements for anti-HIV activity. Finally, a rational screening strategy allowed the identification of tetrahydro-imidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepine-2(1H)-one and -thione (TIBO) derivatives which represent a complete new class of anti-HIV-1 agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "62": "The interaction between a single dose of 20 mg of prazepam and 0.5 g/kg body weight ethanol was investigated in 12 healthy male volunteers by nine objective performance tests, eight visual analogue self-rating scales and measurement of prazepam and ethanol plasma concentrations, using a double-blind three-way crossover design. The volunteers were each given three treatments (prazepam+ethanol, placebo+ethanol and prazepam alone), separated by a 2-week interval. They completed the performance tests before treatment and 1.5 and 4 h thereafter, and the self-rating scales before treatment, 1.5, 4 and 8 thereafter. To determine prazepam and ethanol plasma levels, venous blood samples were drawn before drug intake and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 4, 5 and 8 h thereafter. In two of the performance tests: auditory reaction time and digit symbol substitution, the combination of prazepam and ethanol was shown to impair performance more than either drug taken alone 1.5 h after their administration. A similar result was found for the drowsiness scored in the self-ratings. The time needed to complete the two-symbol cancellation test was longer when the subjects received prazepam either alone or combined with ethanol. Simultaneous ingestion of prazepam and ethanol did not alter the bioavailability of either drug.", 
    "63": "The biotransformation of midazolam is mediated by a cytochrome P-450 isozyme (P-450 IIIA) whose activity is highly variable. The kinetics of the 1'- and 4-hydroxylation of midazolam, the major routes of midazolam oxidation, by human liver microsomes have been examined to characterize further the cytochrome isozyme(s) catalysing these reactions, and to screen for drugs that might interfere with them. In hepatic microsomal preparation from two kidney donors (extensive and poor metabolisers of debrisoquine) KM values for 1'-hydroxylation were 4.2 and 6.1 microM (extensive and poor metabolisers, respectively), and for the 4-hydroxylation they were 14.7 and 18.1 microM, respectively. The corresponding Vmax values were 25.8 and 29.8 and 17.0 and 18.1 nmol.mg P-1.h-1. Both reactions appeared to be catalysed by the same or by coregulated isozymes. Midazolam hydroxylations in vitro are inhibited by many drugs, including nifedipine and other dihydropyridine-type calcium channel blockers, ergot alkaloids, cyclosporine, erythromycin and phenothiazine-type neuroleptics. A clinical case report illustrates the consequence of such a drug-drug interference with hepatic biotransformation; midazolam-induced sleep in a patient lasted for 6 days (t1/2 = 25 h).", 
    "64": "In order to ascertain if pirenzepine (Pz), an antimuscarinic drug, could inhibit GH secretion in acromegaly, 8 patients were submitted to 3 successive treatment courses of 9 days each: Pz, bromocriptine (BRC) and Pz plus BRC. No change in basal levels of GH after Pz administration was seen, but its reduction (p less than 0.05) by BRC was observed. Pz plus BRC did not improve this response. None of these drugs abolished the paradoxical GH response to TRH. In 7 normal controls, Pz suppressed the GH responsiveness to GHRH (p less than 0.001), but not in acromegalic patients. BRC, instead, blunted this response. In conclusion, cholinergic control of GH secretion is altered in acromegaly. Pz, either when administered alone or associated with BRC, is not useful for the treatment of this disease.", 
    "65": "CD-1 strain, female mice, aged 5 to 7 months, were mated with males of the same age. Females presenting vaginal plug were separated and randomly distributed in two groups to be treated from the 6th to 17th day of gestation. One group received single daily diazepam doses (2.7 mg/kg i.p.), the other, 0.9% saline in equivalent volumes. Females were killed on 18th day, the placentas removed and fixed in 10% formaldehyde, pH 7.3, dehydrated and embedded in paraplast; 3 microns thick sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and Weigert hematoxylin and analyzed under light microscopy. Placentas of the diazepam-treated females presented dilated chorion vessels and intervillous spaces. Trophoblastic cell nuclei presented chromatin in coarse granules, atypically distributed in the karyolymph, which had lesser staining affinity. Giant cells showed vacuolized cytoplasm and coarsely granulated chromatin. Results indicate that diazepam causes structural changes, possibly placental and fetal physiology.", 
    "66": "The last decade has witnessed substantial progress in our understanding of ethnic differences and similarities between Asians and other ethnic groups in response to various psychotropics. Capitalizing on recent advances in cross-cultural and psychobiological research methodology, a number of recent studies have suggested a special sensitivity of Asians to various psychotropic medications. Whereas pharmacokinetic differences have been consistently found with haloperidol and some benzodiazepines, results of studies focusing on tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have remained inconclusive. In addition, ethnic differences in protein binding and in the pharmacodynamics of some of these drugs have also been reported. Future studies should explore newer assay methods and imaging techniques capable of measuring receptor-drug interactions, in addition to utilizing existing research methodologies to more systematically scrutinize the nature and extent of such differences. They should be designed not only to ascertain differences in drug responses, but also to examine genetic and environmental (e.g., diet, exposure to enzyme inducers) factors that may contribute to these differences. Pharmacogenetic probes could be used in combination with studies examining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic issues for such purposes.", 
    "67": "A double-blind pilot study was undertaken to test the administration of low doses of the long-acting benzodiazepine drug clonazepam in the management of chronic intractable temporomandibular disorder/myofascial pain patients who were not responsive to occlusal splint, behavioral, and physical therapy. Clonazepam was selected for its long duration and its cholinergic/GABA-ergic/serotonergic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Clonazepam appears to be effective when compared to a placebo. However, caution must be observed with long-term administration of clonazepam because of potential side effects such as depression and liver dysfunction. Indiscriminate administration of clonazepam may be harmful to the patient.", 
    "68": "Diazepam (2 mg/kg, DZP) or placebo were administered by oral gavage throughout gestation in 40 mice. The automatic hole board test for mice (Boissier and Simon) was used to measure the locomotor activity and the number of holes explored by the offspring (mean age 30.6 days). During the first test, this number represents curiosity. Its progressive decrease when the test is repeated (4 times at 1-day intervals) is a consequence of learning retention. In the first test, neither curiosity nor activity were linked with the mother's treatment or sex. During the next tests, there was no difference in locomotor activity between DZP and placebo groups. However, the DZP exposed pups explored fewer holes than controls. Although there was a tendency towards greater activity in the female group, the number of holes explored in the placebo group was significantly higher in females than in males. Paradoxically, this difference in learning memory function which exists between control males and females was not observed in the DZP group, corresponding to an impaired learning retention.", 
    "69": "Albumin was isolated from pooled fetal serum obtained at normal delivery at term and from pooled adult plasma. Albumin isolation was carried out by means of PEG precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex A 50 and then on SP-Sephadex C 50. The binding of diazepam (1 microM), salicylic acid (2 mM) and digitoxin (6 nM) to albumin (40 g/l) was measured by equilibrium dialysis at 37 degrees C. The unbound fraction (mean +/- SD) for fetal and adult albumin of diazepam was 1.86 +/- 0.24 and 1.82 +/- 0.15% (NS), that of digitoxin was 3.18 +/- 0.27 and 3.36 +/- 0.04% (NS) and that of salicylic acid was 11.65 +/- 0.99 and 9.47 +/- 0.75% (p less than 0.05), respectively. With both fetal and adult albumin, a single class of binding sites was observed for diazepam and digitoxin, whereas two classes of binding sites were observed for salicylic acid. The number of binding sites (n, moles of drug per mole of albumin) for fetal and adult albumin was 0.83 and 1.02 for diazepam and 0.014 and 0.018 for digitoxin, respectively. For salicylic acid, n was 1.45 (fetal albumin) and 1.55 (adult albumin) for the higher affinity site, and 3.06 (fetal albumin) and 3.27 (adult albumin) for the lower affinity site. The association constant (Ka, M-1) for diazepam was 1.36 x 10(5) (fetal albumin) and 1.00 x 10(5) (adult albumin) and that for digitoxin was 4.12 x 10(6) (fetal albumin) and 2.7 x 10(6) (adult albumin). For salicylic acid, Ka was 38.4 x 10(3) (fetal albumin) and 35.8 x 10(3) (adult albumin) for the higher affinity site, and 2.7 x 10(3) (fetal albumin) and 4.3 x 10(3) (adult albumin) for the lower affinity site. This work shows that fetal and adult albumin have similar binding properties and corroborates our previous findings with furosemide.", 
    "70": "Delirium is the second most common psychiatric diagnosis among hospitalized elderly cancer patients. A variety of factors are known to cause delirium in cancer patients, and the most frequently observed are outlined. History, presence of an altered mental state with identification of the cognitive impairment, and a close watch of mental function will help to differentiate delirium from a normal stress reaction, an adjustment disorder to cancer diagnosis, or early dementia. As in other medically ill patients, antipsychotic drugs are the cornerstone of treatment for delirium not manageable with environmental manipulation or causal therapy. Haloperidol is the most commonly prescribed drug for delirium in the cancer setting because of its low cardiovascular and anticholinergic effects. Cancer patients who are debilitated require a much lower starting dose than do the physically healthy.", 
    "71": "After administration of high-dose codeine we found that in two cases 20-40% of the total morphine-equivalents in the 24-hour urine sample were free morphine. After another 24 hours the proportion of free morphine was up to 70% and after roughly 96 hours even went up to 96%. Although 10% of the administered codeine was eliminated as morphine. In contrast to the values reported in literature we found that even with codeine/morphine ratios greater than 0.5 and morphine concentrations of up to 2000 ng/ml urine one cannot naturally conclude that morphine/diamorphine has been consumed. The short half-life of codeine in serum was 2-4 hours, the final half-life was 9-11 hours. In urine we found a short half-life of 1-6 hours as well as a long half-life of 7-12 hours. When diazepam was administered simultaneously with codeine the expected half-life in serum was up to 1.5 times and in urine 2.5 times. The codeine/morphine ratios were hardly affected so far as evidence goes which they give of preceding drug-intake.", 
    "72": "In acute local myocardial ischaemia produced in mongrel dogs, the sensitivity of baroreflex decreased as electrical instability (vulnerability) of cardiac ventricles increased. Simultaneous administration of a benzodiazepine and a powerful analgesic (analgosedation) augmented both baroreflex sensitivity and ventricular fibrillation threshold. Modulation of neurovegetative activation of the heart by drugs in the early stage of ischaemia holds promise as a potential technique of sudden coronary death prevention.", 
    "73": "The effect of flumazenil, a specific benzodiazepine antagonist, on the midazolam-induced suppression of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) following strong electrical stimulation of the upper lip was investigated in Wistar albino rats. The averaged SEPs were recorded from the contralateral surface of the skull in the temporal area. Each rat received midazolam in a dose of 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Five min after midazolam injection, the relative amplitude of the P1N1 wave of the SEPs was reduced significantly. A 0.5 mg dose of flumazenil or physiological saline was injected intraperitoneally 7.5 min after midazolam injection. The P1N1 amplitude recovered rapidly to the control value in the flumazenil group but not in the physiological saline group. No significant differences were found in the latencies of the P1 and N1 peaks before or after midazolam or flumazenil injection. It is suggested that flumazenil strongly antagonizes the midazolam-induced suppression of SEPs in the rat.", 
    "74": "Fifty-eight patients undergoing restorative dental treatment at Guy's Hospital had been previously allocated on the basis of clinical assessment, including that of their dental anxiety, to treatment under local anaesthetic alone or in combination with i.v. midazolam or inhalation nitrous oxide. They were tested before and after dental treatment to determine their memory of dental procedures and changes in mood and bodily symptoms. The patients allocated to the midazolam treatment had significantly higher pre-treatment scores on the Bond & Lader mood factors of \"anxiety\" and \"discontent\". All the groups showed significant pre- to post-treatment reductions in sweating, palpitations, restlessness, dry mouth, muscular tension, nausea, loss of appetite and upset stomach and the extent of these reductions were not different for the different treatments. Midazolam treatment resulted in significantly greater reductions in self-ratings of bodily symptoms of anxiety, shaking and trembling compared with the control (local anaesthetic) group. Nitrous oxide resulted in a significant reduction in irritability, compared with controls. Both midazolam and nitrous oxide significantly reduced the patients' memory of the dental procedures and the impairments in memory were independent of any changes in anxiety or sedation. Of the items remembered there were no differences between the groups in their ratings of how well explained, how pleasant or unpleasant, or how painful the procedures were.", 
    "75": "The central nervous system effects of flosequinan (100 mg), a chemically novel quinolone vasodilator, were assessed by a double-blind crossover comparison with placebo and diazepam (10 mg) in 12 healthy volunteers. After five practice sessions on a battery of automated psychomotor tests, assessments of psychomotor function and mood ratings were made on each volunteer at baseline and 1, 3, 6 and 24 h after dosing. Compared with placebo, diazepam (10 mg), the verum control, significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced subjective alertness, impaired critical flicker fusion threshold at 1 and 3 h, digit symbol substitution at 6 h, overall total choice reaction time and overall rate on two of five finger tapping tests. Flosequinan (100 mg), however, was indistinguishable from placebo in all tests with two contrasting exceptions: improved alternate right and left finger tapping (mean 5.1/s) compared to either diazepam (4.7/s) or placebo (4.8/s) (p less than 0.05), and impaired digit symbol substitution at 6 h (45.7/min) in comparison with placebo (50.7/min) (p less than 0.01). Ten volunteers reported 12 adverse effects after flosequinan treatment (10 of which were headaches), two reported drowsiness after diazepam and one reported headache after placebo. It was concluded that flosequinan has no central nervous system depressant effects despite the occurrence of headache in 10 volunteers.", 
    "76": "\"Agitation\" is a term that is used to describe a wide range of dysfunctional behaviours in geriatric populations. The term is so widely used that in many cases it loses clinical meaning and therefore a more restricted use of the term is suggested. When patients with agitation are identified it is important to look for underlying treatable pathology which is often present. Controversy surrounding the most appropriate medications is reviewed with particular reference to both neuroleptics and benzodiazepines. A randomized double-blind comparison of lorazepam and alprazolam in demented patients with agitation was carried out. While both drugs were efficacious for some patients, there were significantly more serious side-effects with lorazepam. It appears that there is a role for benzodiazepines such as alprazolam in the management of the agitated demented patient.", 
    "77": "Disposition kinetics of drug from the fetus were studied by subcutaneous injection of indomethacin, salicylic acid, and diazepam into the fetuses of the rats. The mean residence time (MRT) for drugs increased with the day of gestation and the clearance decreased. The values of MRT were in the order indomethacin greater than salicylic acid greater than diazepam, and degrees of the developmental change of MRT were in the order indomethacin greater than salicylic acid greater than diazepam. The steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) for drugs showed little change, corresponding to no significant change in the tissue/plasma drug concentration ratio. The developmental profile of the rate of transplacental transference calculated from a one-compartment open model decreased with the day of gestation.", 
    "78": "Twelve children 1-5 y old were randomly assigned to receive midazolam 0.2 mg.kg-1 either by the intravenous (IV) or intranasal (IN) routes. After IN administration the rapid onset of absorption was observed (tmax 12 min). After both routes of administration the half-life was similar (2.2 h IN and 2.4 h IV). After IN administration the apparent plasma clearance and volume of distribution were about twice as high as after IV administration. The results are consistent with an estimated mean bioavailability of 55%.", 
    "79": "In order to potentiate the efficacy of antiemetic drugs such as metoclopramide (MCP) and the new drug GR 38032F, adjuvant antiemetic drugs such as benzodiazepines are used in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The purpose of our prospective study was to investigate the efficacy of alprazolam (APZ), a newer diazepam, as an adjuvant antiemetic drug, when combined with MCP, in carboplatin (JM8)-based chemotherapy. Thus, 42 patients entered this study. First they received only MCP 1 mg/kg in 15 min infusion (arm A). In the next cycle they received the combination of MCP in the same dose and a tablet of APZ 0.25 mg, 30 min before JM8 infusion and then 3.5, 5.5 and 11.5 h after (arm B). JM8 was administered alone (400 mg/m2) or in combination (300 mg/m2) with vinblastine (6 mg/m2), etoposide (100 mg/m2) or 5-fluorouracil (1,000 mg/m2). In arm A, according to the WHO classification, nausea was intense (p less than 0.003) and the duration of nausea longer (p less than 0.002). In arm B more patients did not present vomiting (p less than 0.018). Secondary effects such as appetite (p less than 0.04), diarrhea (p less than 0.064), diaphoresis (p less than 0.085) and headache (p less than 0.024) were worst in arm A. We conclude that APZ increases the antiemetic effect of MCP on JM8. APZ is a useful adjuvant antiemetic drug, especially against the development of anticipatory anxiety, nausea and vomiting that many cancer patients presented during chemotherapy.", 
    "80": "Pirenzepine is a tricyclic antimuscarine drug with antisecretory effect on gastric secretion and inhibitory effect on esophageal peristalsis (EP). The effect of pirenzepine in graded doses on basal and pentagastrin-stimulated lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) was studied in 8 volunteers. The effect was compared with the effect of atropine and placebo using a double dummy technique. Intravenously administered pirenzepine and atropine inhibited basal LESP and EP regardless of the employed doses. No difference between atropine and pirenzepine could be demonstrated. The pentagastrin-stimulated LESP was inhibited in patients treated with pirenzepine perorally (50 mg b.i.d.). Basic acid output was significantly reduced by pirenzepine or atropine in contrast to peak acid output. We conclude that muscarinic receptors of type M play a role in the LES function in man.", 
    "81": "The present study examined the agreement between two measures of prevalence of drug use in the community: self-report and specific pharmacological analyses of urine samples. The data were collected in the context of a random community survey of health practices and attitudes. A random 20% of the households participating in the health study were targeted for biochemical assay. Compliance with urine delivery was relatively high at 79%. Urine samples were screened qualitatively for cannabinoids and benzodiazepines using the enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) (Syva Diagnostics, Palo Alto, CA). Screening for pharmaceuticals used a standard thin-layer chromatography (TLC) technique. Agreement between the self-report and biochemical assay estimates of prevalence was statistically significant (p less than .05). While self-report of substance use is not a perfect measure of consumption, it remains a relatively economical and reasonably accurate method of obtaining estimates of substance use in community samples.", 
    "82": "Two hundred and twenty cases of acute overdoses are revised using a specific protocol. We have found a larger number of cases of overdoses to exist in women (62.73%), at an average of 32 years of age, the typical deviation being that of 15.8. Intentional overdoses are predominant (80%), 55.1% using benzodiazepines. The abuse of one sole drug (67.3%) is greater in comparison to combining drugs sole drug (67.3%) is greater in comparison to combining drugs with alcohol (10.2%). The treatment most often used was stomach pumping (49.5%), being effective in 76.1% of the cases Hospitalizations total 16.8%, with 30% remaining in observation. A comparison of our study is made with available Spanish sources, demonstrating: a) The smaller number of acute overdoses. b) The increasing importance of the acute overdoses caused by benzodiazepines and derivatives of opium, thus the interest in the use of antidotes such as Naloxone and Flumazenil which improve the prognosis of these patients. In our series in particular, there is a 0% death rate.", 
    "83": "Two drug models of memory dysfunction, namely the benzodiazepine and the cholinergic models, have emerged from the considerable number of studies which have examined drug effects on information processing. The reported impairments produced by administration of compounds from these two families appear to be more similar than dissimilar, and to date, direct comparisons on traditional memory tasks have failed to differentiate the models. This study compared the effects of diazepam and scopolamine on tasks associated with separable components of working memory. The results indicate that this model also fails to discriminate between the drug models; both compounds selectively impaired tasks associated with the central executive mechanism and failed to disrupt tasks associated with the articulatory loop or the visuospatial scratchpad.", 
    "84": "The efficacy and safety of alprazolam and buspirone for treating generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) were compared in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 94 outpatients. Mean daily doses at the end of the study were 1.9 mg alprazolam and 18.7 mg buspirone. As judged by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, Physician's Global Improvement Scale, and other efficacy scales, alprazolam and buspirone were similar in efficacy, but more effective than placebo, for treating anxiety and depression symptoms in these patients. Clinically important differences were noted between drugs in the onset of effect, with alprazolam producing rapid and sustained improvement within the first week of treatment and buspirone producing more gradual, continuous improvement throughout the study. Significantly more buspirone-treated than alprazolam-treated patients failed to complete the study, primarily because of side effects or inefficacy. No clinically important differences were noted between alprazolam and buspirone in side effects, vital signs, or laboratory test results. Alprazolam-treated patients most frequently reported central nervous system-related side effects (drowsiness and sedation), while buspirone-treated patients most frequently reported gastrointestinal system-related side effects (appetite disturbances and abdominal complaints).", 
    "85": "The influence of the CCK-A antagonist devazepide and the CCK-B/gastrin antagonist L-365,260 on the locomotor activity of mice was studied. Devazepide and L-365,260 had opposite effects on spontaneous locomotor activity, and on caerulein- and apomorphine-induced hypomotility in the mouse. Devazepide in high doses (0.1-1 mg/kg IP) reduced spontaneous motor activity, whereas L-365,260 at a high dose (1 mg/kg IP) increased the activity of mice. Devazepide (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) moderately antagonized the sedative effect of apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg SC) and caerulein (25 micrograms/kg SC), whereas L-365,260 (1-10 micrograms/kg) significantly potentiated the actions of dopamine and CCK agonists. Concomitant administration of caerulein (15 micrograms/kg SC) and apomorphine (0.1 mg/kg SC) caused an almost complete loss of locomotor activity in the mouse. Devazepide and L-365,260 (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) were completely ineffective against caerulein-induced potentiation of apomorphine hypomotility. Devazepide in high doses (0.1-1 mg/kg), reducing the spontaneous motor activity of mice, counteracted the motor excitation induced by d-amphetamine (5 mg/kg IP). The CCK agonist caerulein (100 micrograms/kg SC) had a similar antiamphetamine effect. Devazepide (1-100 micrograms/kg) and L-365,260 (1 micrograms/kg) reversed completely the antiamphetamine effect of caerulein. The results of present study reflect apparently distinct role of CCK-A and CCK-B receptors in the regulation of motor activity. The opposite effect of devazepide and L-365,260 on caerulein- and apomorphine-induced hypolocomotion is probably related to the antagonistic role of CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes in the regulation of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons. The antiamphetamine effect of caerulein is possibly linked to the stimulation of CCK-A receptors in the mouse brain, whereas the blockade of both subtypes of the CCK-8 receptor is involved in the antiamphetamine effect of devazepide.", 
    "86": "Rats entrained to 12-h on /12-h off light schedule and injected with triazolam 0.4 mg/kg at the mid-point of their activity phase (6 h after lights out: circadian time = CT-18) had a stronger hypnotic response than animals free-running in constant dark injected at the equivalent circadian time. In contrast, entrained rats injected 5 h after lights on (CT-5) showed increased wake after injection relative to baseline, largely due to REM sleep inhibition. Hypnotic efficacy was found to be inversely related to prior accumulated sleep. During the 6 h before injection, entrained rats injected at CT-18 slept significantly less than the free-running rats, which in turn slept significantly less than entrained rats injected at CT-5. Taken together, the results suggest that the amount of prior sleep was a more important influence on the response to triazolam than either light/dark per se or circadian phase. Methodologically, automated sleep scoring was found to be an efficient method for examining drug effects, particularly when corroborated by concurrent independent physiological variables and spectral analysis.", 
    "87": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of varying doses of pirenzepine, a selective muscarinic subtype M1 antagonist, on the prevention of acute gastric mucosal lesions in male Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to spinal cord section at the C7 level. It was also intended to evaluate the effects of the drug on gastric acid output and gastric mucosal blood flow. Pirenzepine 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg every 2 h all caused a significant reduction in mean total ulcer length (p less than 0.01) compared to controls. This was associated with a significant decrease in acid output (p less than 0.05). There was no significant effect on gastric mucosa blood flow as measured by hydrogen gas clearance. These results indicate that the protective effects of pirenzepine on gastric mucosa, in the spinal rat model, are associated with the acid-inhibitory action of the drug and not on mucosal blood flow effects.", 
    "88": "1. Recent evidence indicates that post-training memory processes are down-regulated by benzodiazepine/GABA-A systems in the amygdala, septum and hippocampus. Habituation and avoidance learning are accompanied by a decrease of benzodiazepine-like immunoreactivity in the three structures, explainable by a release of benzodiazepines. Immediate post-training microinjection of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil into the hippocampus enhances retention of habituation. The post-training administration of flumazenil into any of the three structures enhances retention of avoidance learning. 2. The mode of operation of these systems was studied in detail in the amygdala using avoidance paradigms. The release of endogenous benzodiazepines during and particularly after training enhances sensitivity of local GABA-A receptors to muscimol, activation of the GABA-A receptors opens chloride channels that can be selectively blocked by picrotoxin and by Ro5-4864. Training enhances, and flumazenil reduces, sensitivity of the amygdala to the amnestic effect of locally injected muscimol by a factor of 100. Post-training intra-amygdala administration of picrotoxin or Ro5-4864 enhances retention. 3. These findings suggest that the endogenous benzodiazepine/GABA-A mechanisms that down-regulate memory in the amygdala, septum and hippocampus are activated in response to the anxiety and/or stress associated with each task. Memory lability which occurs in the post-training period and characterizes consolidation would thus be a consequence of the brain's response to anxiety or stress.", 
    "89": "Tea prepared from lemongrass (Cymbopogon citratus) is used for its supposed anxiolytic, hypnotic and analgesic properties in Brazilian folk medicine. beta-Myrcene, a major constituent of lemongrass, produces analgesia in rodents but there is some controversy about whether this action is central or peripheral or both. Rats and mice received beta-myrcene, 1 g/kg po in corn oil, or corn oil alone 1 h before being evaluated for a series of responses which included exploratory and emotional behavior, anxiolytic activity in a plus maze and inhibition of conditioned avoidance. No evidence was demonstrable for an effect of beta-myrcene on any of these behaviors. Similarly, beta-myrcene had no protective effect on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice. These data suggest that beta-myrcene has no benzodiazepine-like anxiolytic activity and that an activity on the central nervous system (antidepressive or antipsychotic) is unlikely. Despite the negative results of this study, folk use of lemongrass tea may still be justified by its analgesic properties.", 
    "90": "The combination of two epileptogenic factors--rhythmic photostimulation at frequencies of 5-6 Hz, and local injury to the visual cortex by freezing--were used to induce paroxysmal spike-and-wave type activity in rabbits. This activity (5-6 discharges per second) was observed near the injured site, as well as in the mirror foci, but it never extended to the frontal cortex. Spike-and-wave discharges were also observed in the lateral geniculate body and the superior colliculus. Diazepam completely inhibited this epileptic activity, but pentylenetetrazol and caffeine potentiated its manifestation. The dominant theta-rhythm frequency coincides with the main electroencephalogram synchronization frequency, and with the frequency of rhythmical photostimulation which was able to induce the seizures. These findings are discussed with respect to the theory of synchronization of biorhythms in the brain.", 
    "91": "In general, chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and amphetamine reduce high rates of responding and increase low rates (rate-dependent effect). However, unlike CDP, amphetamine does not typically increase low rates resulting from suppression of responding by noxious stimuli. In the present experiment, key pecking by pigeons was reinforced under a random ratio schedule of food presentation. This responding was then suppressed by stimuli correlated with electric shocks of varying intensity (2 or 4 mA) or reduced by the omission of the food (extinction). Treatment with CDP (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) and morphine (0.3-10.0 mg/kg) increased the rate of suppressed responding: lower rates being increased to a proportionately greater extent than high rates. d-Amphetamine (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) further reduced the rate of suppressed responding: the lower rates being reduced proportionately more than the higher rates. Thus the effects of all three drugs depended upon the control rates of responding, but the effects of amphetamine were the inverse of those of CDP, and morphine. The effects of amphetamine on low, suppressed or punished response rates are therefore not an exception to the generality of rate-dependency, but a different aspect of the same principle - \"inverse rate-dependency\".", 
    "92": "Results of previous studies suggest that N-desmethyladinazolam, the major metabolite of adinazolam in man, contributes substantially to psychomotor effects and sedation observed following adinazolam administration. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of N-desmethyladinazolam were explored following administration of single oral doses of placebo and solutions containing 10, 30, and 50 mg N-desmethyladinazolam mesylate in a double-blind, randomized, four-way crossover design to 15 healthy male volunteers. Plasma concentrations of N-desmethyladinazolam were determined by HPLC. Psychomotor performance tests (digit symbol substitution and card sorting by fours and suits), memory tests and sedation scoring were also performed following drug administration. N-Desmethyladinazolam pharmacokinetics were dose independent over this range. Dose-related performance effects were observed at 1, 2, and 6 h after dosing. Memory was likewise affected at 2 h. Psychomotor performance decrements correlated with log N-desmethyladinazolam plasma concentrations. Analysis of the relationship between percentage decrements in digit-symbol substitution and plasma N-desmethyladinazolam using the Hill equation revealed a EC50 of 325 ng/ml. These results establish the relationship between N-desmethyladinazolam plasma concentrations and performance effects; these data will be helpful in assessing the contribution of N-desmethyladinazolam to clinical effects observed after adinazolam administration."
