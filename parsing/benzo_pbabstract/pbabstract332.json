    "0": "Positron emission tomography has offered the possibility to investigate the pathophysiology of idiopathic generalized epilepsies. Absence epilepsies demonstrate normal cerebral glucose metabolism and benzodiazepine receptor density. Conversely, juvenile myoclonic epilepsies are associated with frontal hypometabolism, which aggravates during a working memory task. Typical 3 Hz spike and wave discharges lead to a diffuse hypermetabolism. The latter resembles that observed during GAERS rats absences, and clearly differs from the hypometabolism encountered in partial epilepsies associated with generalized spike and wave discharges. Overall, functional imaging data provide further evidence of syndromic specificities in idiopathic generalized epilepsies.", 
    "1": "Several factors suggest that endogenous benzodiazepines and gamma-amino-butyric acid may be involved in pathophysiology of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). Contrasting opinions exist on the therapeutic efficacy of flumazenil in the treatment of HE. This study was planned to assess the efficacy of flumazenil by a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design in a large and selected population of cirrhotic patients in stage 4a HE admitted to intensive care units over a 4-year period. Out of 236 patients selected for the study, 132 received flumazenil, whereas 131 patients received placebo. Improvement of the neurological score was documented in 31 patients (23%) of flumazenil group and in two patients (1.5%) of placebo group (p < 0.001) during the first study period, whereas during the crossover period, improvement of the neurological score was documented in seven patients (5.3%) of the flumazenil group and in none of the placebo group (p = 0.022). Improvements in EEG tracings were observed in 44 patients (33.3%) of flumazenil group and in five patients (3.8%) of placebo group (p < 0.001) during the first study period; during the crossover period, improvements in EEG tracings were observed in 10 patients (7.5%) of the flumazenil group and in two patients (1.5%) of the placebo group (p = 0.040). The presence of benzodiazepines was detected in the serum of three responders and in two non-responders. The presence of diazepam and NN-desmethyl diazepam was documented in two responders; prior intake of synthetic diazepam was later confirmed in these patients. The results of our study suggest that flumazenil is beneficial only in a selected subset of cirrhotic patients with severe HE; the applicability of this treatment to unselected patients with hepatic coma or to cirrhotic patients with less severe HE still remains to be determined.", 
    "2": "The adaptive characteristics of the body, including the specific features of increased cold resistance upon repeated exposures to cold, are determined not only by the properties of thermogenic structures themselves, but largely depend on the contribution of the central mechanisms which control the processes of habituation and mobilization of functions. The experiments revealed an increase in cold resistance in rats after preexposure to cold. Immobilization stress prior to training cold significantly decreased rapid cold resistance in the animals, but increased the training effect of the first cooling. On the contrary, chlordiazepoxide increased cold resistance during the first cooling. Testing of the untreated animal showed no effect of training. No adaptive changes in cold resistance occurred in rats with impaired amygdaloid complex. Analyzing adrenal catecholamines revealed a significant elevation of dopamine concentrations in the rats exposed to cold. Hypothalamic catecholamines did not change with cold and serotonin in intact rats and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in amygdalectomized rats substantially increased.", 
    "3": "The solubility and stability of the chemically unstable drug tetrazepam which has poor water solubility have been studied in bile salts-phosphatidylcholine-mixed micelles (BS-PC-MM). The solubilization potential of BS-PC-MM was much higher than that of BS alone. The use of soya-PC (SPC) instead of egg-PC (EPC) increased the solubilization capacity of MM. The results of the stability studies indicated first order degradation kinetics in most cases under aerobic conditions. An Arrhenius plot could be constructed in a temperature range from 30 to 60 degrees C in sodium deoxycholate-SPC-MM (SDC-SPC-MM) as well as in phosphate buffer at pH 7.4. Sodium glycocholate-SPC-MM (SGC-SPC-MM) interfered with the degradation kinetics and displayed better stabilizing effects under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The addition of ascorbic acid (AA) protected tetrazepam to some extent, whereas Na2SO3 or Na2S2O5 were incompatible with it. Formulating tetrazepam in SGC-SPC-MM containing 0.1% AA resulted in a shelf stability of more than 1 year under anaerobic conditions.", 
    "4": "Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent that is commonly used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Many studies have found it to be equal in efficacy to the benzodiazepines in the treatment of this illness. Its use has gained favor over the past few years because of its relatively mild and tolerable side-effect profile. The authors report a case of buspirone overdose that resulted in a generalized tonic clonic seizure approximately 36 hours after ingestion. Although there have been no previous cases of seizure induction by buspirone in humans, there are animal models of this phenomenon. The authors describe the case, review the literature regarding buspirone overdose and toxicity, and discuss treatment recommendations.", 
    "5": "MK-801 (dizocilpine), a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, induces dystonia in monkeys at doses of 0.08 mg/kg. This syndrome was tested with the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist NNC 756, the DA D2 receptor antagonist raclopride, the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, the dopamine D1 receptor agonist SKF 81297, the dopamine D2/D3 receptor agonist quinpirole, the anticholinergic biperiden, amphetamine, and the benzodiazepine midazolam in 7 Cebus apella monkeys previously treated with dopaminergic agents. NNC 756 (0.004 and 0.01 mg/kg), raclopride (0.004 and 0.01 mg/kg), SKF 81297 (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg), quinpirole (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg), amphetamine (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), and biperiden (0.125 and up to 1.0 mg/kg), had no significant effect on MK-801-induced dystonia. In contrast, both clozapine (2.0 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.4 and 1.0 mg/kg) reduced the dystonia caused by MK-801. Dystonia induced by dopamine D1 and D2 antagonists is easily antagonized by biperiden and dopamine agonists, whereas these drugs had no significant effect on MK-801-induced dystonia. It has been proposed that dystonia may be caused by a sudden drop in the output from the basal ganglia that is primarily GABAergic. Midazolam's enhancing effect on the GABAergic tone is consistent with this hypothesis. The effect of clozapine is more difficult to explain, but this drug has a rich pharmacology and suggests an agonistic glutamatergic effect.", 
    "6": "In the treatment of epilepsy, benzodiazepines are often administered in combination with other antiepileptic drug (s) because of the development of tolerance. In this study, the influence of concurrently administered antiepileptic drugs on tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of the nitrazepam (NZP) was studied using an animal tolerance model. Mice were given vehicle, NZP alone or NZP concurrently with one of six antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine CBZ, phenytoin PHT, zonisamide ZNS, vigabatrin VGB, lamotrigine LTG, or flunarizine FNR) twice daily for 5 days. Tolerance was assessed by the ability of NZP to prevent pentylenetetrazol-induced clonic convulsions. Tolerance developed in mice treated with NZP alone, NZP plus CBZ, PHT, ZNS, VGB or LTG. On the other hand, mice receiving NZP + FNR showed no tolerance; there was no significant difference in seizure frequency between the vehicle group and NZP + FNR group. These data suggest that co-administration of FNR but not CBZ, PHT, ZNS, VGB or LTG may delay if not prevent development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of benzodiazepines.", 
    "7": "Astroglial swelling occurs in acute hyperammonemic states, including acute hepatic encephalopathy. In these conditions, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a receptor associated with neurosteroidogenesis, is up-regulated. This study examined the potential involvement of PBRs and neurosteroids in ammonia-induced astrocyte swelling in culture. At low micromolar concentrations, the PBR antagonist PK 11195, atrial natriuretic peptide, and protoporhyrin IX, which are known to interact with the PBR, attenuated (16-100%) the effects of ammonia, whereas the PBR agonists Ro5-4864, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI51-70), and octadecaneuropeptide exacerbated (10-15%) the effects of ammonia. At micromolar concentrations, diazepam, which interacts with both the PBR and the central-type benzodiazepine receptor (CBR), increased swelling by 11%, whereas flumazenil, a CBR antagonist, had no effect. However, at 100 nM diazepam and flumazenil abrogated ammonia-induced swelling. The neurosteroids dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, tetrahydroprogesterone, pregnenolone sulfate, and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC), products of PBR stimulation, at micromolar concentrations significantly enhanced (70%) ammonia-induced swelling. However, at nanomolar concentrations, these neurosteroids, with exception of THDOC, blocked ammonia-induced swelling. We conclude that neurosteroids and agents that interact with the PBR influence ammonia-induced swelling. These agents may represent novel therapies for acute hyperammonemic syndromes and other conditions associated with brain edema and astrocyte swelling.", 
    "8": "Ketamine, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has psychotomimetic activity. NMDA receptor antagonists cause morphological damage in the posterior cingulate cortex, which may be the brain region responsible for their psychotomimetic effects. Benzodiazepines are effective in preventing these effects through gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor activation. We investigated the effect of propofol, which has both GABAA receptor-activating and NMDA receptor-suppressing activity, on ketamine-induced c-fos expression in the rat posterior cingulate cortex. Propofol or vehicle was continuously infused IV. Fifteen minutes later, 100 mg/kg ketamine or isotonic sodium chloride solution was injected intraperitoneally. Two hours later, brain sections were prepared, and c-fos expression was detected using immunohistochemical methods. Propofol significantly inhibited ketamine-induced c-fos expression in the posterior cingulate cortex. Propofol itself did not induce c-fos expression in this brain region. We conclude that propofol may be able to inhibit ketamine-induced psychotomimetic activity and neuronal damage.", 
    "9": "In the present study, we demonstrated that the clinically relevant dose of propofol significantly inhibited ketamine-induced c-fos expression in the rat posterior cingulate cortex. This finding implies that propofol may inhibit ketamine-induced psychotomimetic activity and neuronal damage.",

Group 1 patients (n = 33) were sedated by an anesthesiologist and group 2 patients (n = 26) were sedated by an electrophysiologist. Anesthesiologists used propofol and electrophysiologists used midazolam and morphine for sedation. A cost analysis based on professional charges and cost of medications was performed for both groups and compared. Hospital charges were similar for both groups and were excluded from the cost analysis. Although time to sedation in group 1 was shorter than that in group 2, sedation was adequate in both groups such that no patient in group 1 and only 1 patient in group 2 recalled being shocked. There were no complications in either group. The cost incurred in group 2 was less than that in group 1.",

    "14": "Eight mild cirrhotics and eight healthy subjects received antipyrine (po), lorazepam (IV), indocyanine green (IV) and minoxidil 5 mg (po). Blood and urine were sampled for up to 72 h after each drug, and drug concentrations were measured by validated HPLC methods. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured for safety.", 
    "15": "For unchanged minoxidil, the serum elimination rate constant was significantly smaller and mean residence time was significantly longer in cirrhotic patients. Urinary elimination rate constant for minoxidil glucuronide was significantly smaller and fraction of dose excreted in urine was significantly higher in cirrhotic patients. Antipyrine elimination was significantly slower for cirrhotic patients. No differences were observed in lorazepam pharmacokinetic parameters.", 
    "16": "Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests a longer dosage interval may be appropriate in patients with hepatic impairment. In the absence of multiple-dose minoxidil pharmacodynamic studies in this population, minoxidil should be used as in other populations: begin with a modest dose, and adjust the dose based on clinical response.", 
    "17": "Recently, it has been shown that infusion of the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide induced proliferation of hepatocytes and bile duct epithelium in the rat liver. The aim of this study was to further evaluate the influence of devazepide and sulfated cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8S) on the intact rat liver and rat liver after resection.", 
    "18": "In the first experiment, either saline or devazepide was injected subcutaneously twice daily to rats for 18 and 36 h and 3 and 7 days. In the second experiment, a 70% liver resection was followed by infusion of either DMSO, devazepide, saline or CCK-8S for 2 or 7 days. Prior to sacrifice, all rats received 1 mCi/kg of tritiated thymidine intraperitoneally. The liver was excised and the contents of protein, DNA and water and incorporation of tritiated thymidine were measured.", 
    "19": "Intermittent injections of devazepide increased the liver protein content after 36 h, followed by a decrease after 7 days. The weight, DNA content or cell proliferation was not affected. Two days after liver resection hyperCCKemia was evoked, which was less prominent after 7 days. Devazepide lowered the plasma concentration of CCK, while the infusion of CCK-8S resulted in extremely high concentrations at both time points. The DNA synthesis measured by thymidine incorporation was increased by devazepide on day 2, whereas the weight or protein and DNA contents of the liver were not influenced. CCK-8S infusion decreased the body and liver weight throughout the study, and the protein and DNA contents after 7 days.", 
    "20": "Intermittent devazepide treatment did not affect the intact liver. Devazepide increased the DNA synthesis 2 days after liver resection but was without other influences on the liver regeneration. CCK-8S induced decreased body weight with ensuing negative effects on the liver regeneration. Neither devazepide nor CCK seem to be of any therapeutic use after liver resection or liver failure.", 
    "21": "A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive visual disturbance, ataxia, and dementia. The cerebral cortex became atrophic, as the disease progressed, and electroencephalography showed periodic synchronous discharges. The patient's prion gene revealed a point mutation (232Met to Arg), and a diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease was made. Iomazenil single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed to assess neuronal degeneration. Accumulation of the tracer in the late images was severely decreased diffusely spread throughout the cerebral cortex. Our experience with this case suggests that iomazenil SPECT is useful for detecting neuronal degeneration in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.", 
    "22": "We report the effective use of epidural block in three patients with 'painful legs and moving toes' syndrome, which is characterized by involuntary movements of the toe (and sometimes of the foot) and excruciating pain in the leg. Several treatments had been unsuccessful in the management of the three patients reported including baclofen, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine and antidepressants. In two patients, lumbar sympathetic block was performed, the symptoms being alleviated temporarily in one patient. In contrast, injections of mepivacaine into epidural space suppressed pain and movements in all patients. In one patient, symptoms disappeared for many years after several epidural blocks. In the remaining two patients, epidural injections were repeated when the symptoms were severe.", 
    "23": "I-123-iomazenil is a SPECT probe for central benzodiazepine receptors (BZR) which may reflect intact cortical neuron density after ischemic insults. We evaluated whether neuronal damage in rats could be characterized by iomazenil as compared with cerebral blood flow (CBF). Serial changes in I-125-iomazenil for BZR and I-123-IMP for CBF were analyzed after the unilateral middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats by using an in vivo dualtracer technique. Uptake ratios of affected to contralateral regions were calculated. The iomazenil as well as IMP were decreased in all regions except for the cerebellum (remote area). Both iomazenil and IMP increased over time except in the temporal region (ischemic core). The iomazenil uptake was higher than IMP except in the ischemic core between 1 and 3-4 wk when iomazenil was lower than IMP. Iomazenil showed a moderate decrease in the proximal and middle parietal regions (peri-infarct areas) at 3-4 wk. The triphenyl-tetrazolium-chloride (TTC) stain at 1 wk demonstrated unstained tissue in the temporal region indicating tissue necrosis. With hematoxylin-eosin (HE) stain at 1 wk, widespread neuronal necrosis with occasional intact neurons were found in the proximal parietal region, and isolated necrotic neurons were represented in the distal parietal region. Iomazenil correlated well with the neuron distribution and the finding of a discrepancy between iomazenil and IMP might be useful in evaluating the neuronal damage.", 
    "24": "The present study describes an ultra-rapid opiate detoxification method using direct transition from heroin or methadone to oral naltrexone after deep sedation with oral midazolam in conjunction with ondansetron and clonidine treatment. Twenty patients were detoxified with the method. No serious events occurred, but two out of three patients vomited during the acute phase of deep sedation, which involves some risks. Withdrawal symptoms were still present 24 h after detoxification and 80% of the patients relapsed during a 6-month follow-up.", 
    "25": "Acamprosate is a new psychotropic drug used in the treatment of alcohol (ethanol)-dependence. Recent studies suggest that acamprosate inhibits neuronal hyperexcitability by antagonising excitatory amino acids. It is available as a 333 mg enteric-coated tablet, with a recommended dosage of 1.3 g/day for patients with a bodyweight < 60 kg and 2 g/day for patients with a bodyweight > or = 60 kg. Treatment with higher dose strength tablets 2 x 500 mg twice daily is bioequivalent to treatment with the 2 x 333 mg 3 times daily dosage regimen. Acamprosate is absorbed via the paracellular route in the gastrointestinal tract. Absorption is rapid but limited after oral administration. At steady-state, acamprosate has a moderate distribution volume of about 20L. Acamprosate is not protein bound or metabolised. Half of the elimination of acamprosate occurs as unchanged acetyl-homotaurine in urine, the other half might be eliminated by biliary excretion. The administration of the enteric-coated tablets showed a flip-flop mechanism with a terminal elimination half-life 10-fold higher than the 3-hour half-life reported after intravenous infusion. During repeated oral administration of 666 mg 3 times daily, steady-state is reached after 5 to 7 days and leads to plasma concentrations ranging from 370 to 650 micrograms/L. The pharmacokinetics of acamprosate administered as an enteric-coated tablets are time- and dose-independent, and its accumulation ratio is about 2.4 at steady-state. Acamprosate disposition does not differ between males and females. The pharmacokinetics of acamprosate are not modified in patients with hepatic insufficiency or chronic alcoholism. In contrast, renal insufficiency influences the elimination of acamprosate and it is, therefore, contraindicated under such circumstances. Interaction studies have confirmed that when acamprosate is concomitantly administered with food, the amount absorbed is decreased. When combined with diazepam, disulfiram or alcohol, the pharmacokinetic disposition of acamprosate is not modified. Acamprosate does not influence the kinetics of diazepam, alcohol or imipramine and its metabolite desipramine.", 
    "26": "X-ray diffraction and ab initio MO theoretical calculations were used in order to investigate the structural and electronic properties of sarmazenil, a weak inverse agonist at the omega modulatory sites (benzodiazepine receptors). This compound was compared to bretazenil, a partial agonist, and to the antagonist flumazenil on the basis of structural and electronic data. The conformational and theoretical properties (interatomic pi overlap populations, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), the topology of frontier orbitals, and proton affinity) of these three imidazobenzodiazepinones were determined in order to analyse the stereoelectronic properties in relation with their distinct intrinsic efficacies at the omega modulatory sites.", 
    "27": "An animal model of self-sustaining status epilepticus (SSSE) induced in rats by brief intermittent perforant path stimulation (PPS) was examined with regard to the effects of two conventional antiepileptic drugs, diazepam and phenytoin. Thirty or sixty minutes PPS induced SSSE characterized by continuous behavioral and electrographic seizures lasting for hours. Both diazepam (10 mg/kg i. v.) and phenytoin (50 mg/kg i.v.) prevented the establishment of SSSE when administered 10 min prior to PPS. The injection of diazepam to seizing animals, 10 min after the end of 30 min PPS, was significantly less effective than pretreatment in attenuating SSSE. Administration of diazepam after 60 min PPS was characterized by a further decrease of its efficacy. Phenytoin was effective in aborting SSSE when injected 10 min after 30 min PPS. However, its efficacy was vastly decreased if injected 40 min after 30 min PPS, or 10 min after 60 min PPS. It is concluded that antiepileptic drugs, while highly effective in blocking the induction of SSSE, failed to affect its maintenance. SSSE induced by PPS is an advantageous animal model of refractory status epilepticus, which may be used in preclinical studies of novel antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "28": "Chronic administration of methamphetamine to rats induces neurotoxicity characterized by a loss of striatal dopaminergic terminals and reactive gliosis. Subcutaneous administration of methamphetamine in a scheduled procedure of four doses (10 mg/kg) at 2 h interval also induces a significant increase in the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) density. This increase is maximum (76%) at 72 h post-treatment in the striatum and disappears at 7 days, suggesting that microglia may have a predominant role in necrosis-phagocytosis of neuronal debris rather than acting in a restorative manner. Microgliosis is not restricted to the striatum since it is also evident in cerebellum (75.4% of PBR increase) and hippocampus (37.2% of PBR increase). In the areas with high density of adenosine transporter, the microgliosis phenomenon correlates well with a decrease of this nucleoside transporter (about 39%). Although the microgliosis and the decrease in adenosine transporter could be parallel and not related events, we can speculate that when microglia are activated, a down-regulation of adenosine transporter occurs, playing a role in tissue homeostasis. With the same dosing schedule, methamphetamine induces HSP72 expression in both cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of the striatum, cerebellum and hippocampus. This expression is also evident in the cerebral cortex, where adenosine transporter population did not show any variation.", 
    "29": "A number of pharmacological agents, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and beta blockers, have proven effective for the treatment of social phobia. Nefazodone, a relatively novel antidepressant, has demonstrated potential efficacy for the treatment of panic disorder but has not been formally studied in patients with social phobia. The authors conducted a clinical case study in which five consecutive patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for generalized social phobia were treated with nefazodone (dose range: 200-600 mg/day) for 3 months. Three of the patients completed all 3 months of the treatment, one discontinued after 2 1/2 months due to adverse gastrointestinal effects and one discontinued after 2 months due to lack of efficacy. The patients completed the Liebowitz. Social Phobia Scale and the Sheehan Disability Scale at every clinic visit, and were evaluated by the clinicians with the Brief Social Phobia Scale and CGI-Severity and CGI-Improvement scales. Analysis of endpoint data demonstrated significant improvement on most measures of outcome. Results from this case series suggest that nefazodone may be an effective treatment for social phobia and that formal randomized trials are warranted.", 
    "30": "In previous work, we found effects of prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ) on sexual behavior of adult mice. The aim of this work was to compare sexual behavior during their reproductive span of CD-1 strain male mice exposed in utero to DZ. One group of female mice was treated with DZ (2.5 mg/kg/day; s.c.) from 6th to 17th days of gestation and a control group received saline. The spontaneous offspring male sexual activity to receptive females was tested in 3 sessions (1/week) twice, on the 6th month of age and later on the 20th. Tests were performed during the dark stage of the photoperiod and video recorded under red light. During copulating stage adult DZ-treated males showed greater incidence of interruptions of intravaginal penetration, while senile DZ-treated males had lower latencies of mount series and greater proportion of ejaculations. Both adult and senile DZ-treated males exhibited a significant larger incidence of falls and pauses during mount series with intromission. Results show a permanent effect of prenatal exposure of DZ on sexual behavior.",

In our prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, children (n = 102, age range 12 to 129 months) scheduled for day surgery were randomized to receive either midazolam in one of three doses (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mg.kg-1) or placebo. Injectable midazolam was mixed with a thick grape syrup and placed under the tongue; the patient was asked to hold it as long as possible before swallowing. Children readily accepted the mixture. Analysing all patients randomized, none of the children receiving placebo vs 28% receiving 0.25 mg.kg-1 (P = 0.02), 52% receiving 0.5 mg.kg-1 (P < 0.001), and 64% receiving 0.75 mg.kg-1 (P < 0.001) of midazolam showed satisfactory sedation (drowsy) at 15 min after administration.

Drugs superfused included edrophonium (0.1-500 microM), neostigmine (0.1-10 microM), and muscarinic M1 and M2 antagonists pirenzepine and AFDX-116 (200 nM-10 microM), respectively. To evaluate a presynaptic action, the effect of edrophonium on basal and high-K+ (35 mM) evoked release of [3H]ACh from the superior cervical ganglion was studied in vitro. To evaluate a postsynaptic action, edrophonium's effect on postganglionic nerve discharge in response to arterial injection of ACh (100 micrograms) into the superior cervical ganglion was determined in vivo.",

Circulatory status was monitored with non invasive methods and the level of vigilance assessed using the Ramsay scale. Statistical analysis was obtained with Anova for repeated measurements with two within factors (drug and time).", 
    "47": "VO2 decreased similarly and significantly between T0 and T45 min (P < 0.05). The decrease continued only after midazolam until T60 min. However the variation of VO2 between the midazolam and placebo group was not significant. The haemodynamic variables remained unchanged. Midazolam had a stronger sedative effect at T120 min.", 
    "48": "The observation that cerebellar Purkinje cells contain type-I benzodiazepine-sensitive GABA(A) receptors is consistent with findings in the present work that the majority of Purkinje neurons are sensitive to enhancement of GABA by the type-1 benzodiazepine agonist, zolpidem. Previous work has demonstrated a relation between zolpidem and ethanol enhancement of GABA responses in several brain regions, but had not tested Purkinje neurons. Therefore, given that a majority of Purkinje neurons were found to be sensitive to zolpidem, ethanol would have been expected to enhance GABA responses from this cell type. However, in agreement with earlier electrophysiological studies, ethanol enhanced GABA inhibitory responses from only a small proportion of these cerebellar Purkinje neurons. Rather than enhancement of GABA, local application of ethanol either inhibited or did not affect responses to GABA from a majority of cerebellar-Purkinje neurons. Nonetheless, as previously reported, a portion of the Purkinje neurons initially insensitive to ethanol enhancement of GABA became sensitive to this action of ethanol with co-application of the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol. Thus, these results collectively implicate a beta-adrenergic input dependency for ethanol enhancement of GABA from some, but not all, cerebellar Purkinje neurons sensitive to zolpidem. Because a beta-adrenergic input did not allow ethanol enhancement of GABA from all Purkinje neurons, future studies should explore the possibility that other auxiliary neural inputs to zolpidem-sensitive cerebellar Purkinje neurons may be required for ethanol enhancement of GABA responsiveness when a beta-adrenergic input does not have this action. Likewise, knowing that the action of zolpidem can predict ethanol enhancement of GABA in other brain regions, the present findings suggest that a future determination be made concerning whether zolpidem-sensitive neurons in these other regions of brain require a beta-adrenergic or an alternative neural input for ethanol enhancement of GABA responses.", 
    "49": "This electrophysiological study was performed to elucidate the interactions of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and cholecystokinin (CCK) on mesenteric afferents supplying the rat jejunum. 5-HT and CCK produced characteristic responses in multi-unit recordings of mesenteric afferents. Waveform analysis to extract single units from the whole nerve recording identified populations of single afferents that were sensitive to either 5-HT or CCK, but not both. Furthermore, devazepide (0.5 mg/kg) completely abolished the response to CCK without altering the response to 5-HT while granisetron (0.5 mg/kg) abolished the response to 5-HT with no effect on the response to CCK. These results suggest that there are discrete, noninteractive populations of jejunal afferents that possess either 5-HT3 or CCK-A receptors but not both.", 
    "50": "Midazolam has been reported to cause hypotension or to depress sympathetic activity following intravenous injection. However, little information is available concerning the mechanism of these effects. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of midazolam on release of noradrenaline (NA) at nerve terminals and on receptors in the venous smooth muscle.", 
    "51": "The effect of midazolam at nerve terminals was examined by measuring the amount of NA release from superfused canine mesenteric vein helical strips during electrical stimulation (ES; 5 Hz, 2 ms, 9 V). The NA was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection; tension development evoked by ES was also recorded simultaneously. In a separate series of experiments, ring preparations from the isolated vein were mounted in Krebs-Ringer solution for isometric tension recording to assess the effect of midazolam on alpha-adrenoceptors.", 
    "52": "Application of tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M) or replacement of superfusate with Ca(2+)-free solution decreased both the release of NA and the tension development evoked by ES. Yohimbine (5 x 10(-8) M) increased the ES-evoked release of NA, whereas it decreased tension development in the vein strips. Midazolam (10(-4) M) did not affect either the basal release of NA or the basal tension, but inhibited both the NA release (P < 0.01) and the tension development (P < 0.01) during ES; midazolam at 10(-5) M inhibited the tension development (P < 0.05) but had no effect on NA release. In the ring preparations, midazolam (10(-5) and 10(-4) M) attenuated responses to NA (a mixed alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, 10(-8) to 10(-3) M), phenylephrine (the alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonist, 10(-8) to 10(-3) M) and 5-bromo-6-[2-imidazolin-2yl-amino]-quinoxaline (UK14304; the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, 10(-7) to 10(-3) M) in a dose-dependent manner.", 
    "53": "The data obtained in the present study suggest that midazolam at 10(-4) M may reduce venous tone by inhibiting the release of NA from sympathetic nerve endings and both alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor mediated smooth muscle contractions. It is also postulated that a stage of the post-receptor transduction mechanism linked to the venous smooth muscle contraction may be more sensitive to midazolam than the NA release mechanism at nerve terminals since midazolam at the low concentration tested inhibited ES-evoked tension development with no effect on the release of NA.",

    "55": "Ten healthy male volunteers received single oral doses of placebo, 10 mg zaleplon, 20 mg zaleplon, 10 mg zolpidem, and 20 mg zolpidem in a double-blind, 5-condition crossover study, with 48 hours elapsing between trials. Plasma drug concentrations and pharmacodynamic effects were measured during the 8 to 24 hours after administration.", 
    "56": "Kinetics of zaleplon and zolpidem were not significantly related to dose. However, zaleplon had more rapid elimination (apparent elimination half-life [t1/2] of 1 hour) and higher apparent oral clearance (approximately 4300 mL/min) than zolpidem (t1/2, 2.0 to 2.2 hours; apparent oral clearance, 340 to 380 mL/min). Active treatments produced pharmacodynamic effects consistent with benzodiazepine agonist activity: self- and observer-rated sedation, impairment of digit symbol substitution test (DSST) performance, impaired memory, and increased electroencephalographic activity in the beta frequency range. The overall order of agonist potency was as follows: placebo < 10 mg zaleplon < 20 mg zaleplon < 10 mg zolpidem < 20 mg zolpidem; on a number of measures, 20 mg zaleplon was comparable to 10 mg zolpidem. Quantitative effects of zolpidem 20 mg far exceeded those of other treatments. Dynamic effects of both drugs were significantly related to plasma concentration.",

    "58": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) effects were evaluated, as a behavioural model of inert gas narcosis, in rats performing a vigilance task in which they were required to respond to a slight luminous increment of the house-light. A dose-related decrease of correct responses was produced by the tested range of concentrations of N2O (from 30 to 70% N2O), with a parallel increase of anticipatory responses up to 60% N2O and a dramatic increase of omissions at 70% N2O. The influence of preparatory period duration on hits delays suggested a 'conditional probability effect' conserved under N2O. Pretreatment of animals with flumazenil (a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) did not improve performance under 40% N2O. Naltrexone, an opiate receptor antagonist, however, increased the N2O-induced deficits. These results suggest that benzodiazepine receptors are not involved in N2O-induced impairments in this attentional task, but opiate mechanisms may be implicated.", 
    "59": "Acute and chronic antidepressant drug treatments respectively decrease and increase the aggressive behaviour of resident rats during encounters with unfamiliar conspecifics. We have now examined the effect of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor antagonist, WAY-100635, on fluoxetine-, paroxetine- or venlafaxine-induced changes in aggression. WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg), which did not modify behaviour when given alone, potentiated the venlafaxine (5.54 mg/kg)-induced reduction in aggression after acute treatment and, during chronic treatment, accelerated the fluoxetine (0.34 mg/kg/day)-induced increase in aggression, from day 5 to day 2. A similar change in time course was seen with paroxetine (0.33 mg/kg/day), although the increase in aggression was smaller. Venlafaxine (5.54 mg/kg/day, alone or co-administered with WAY-100635) increased aggression by day 2. During chronic treatment, therefore, venlafaxine, at the dose used, had a more rapid onset of action than either fluoxetine or paroxetine, whereas the fluoxetine- and paroxetine-, but not the venlafaxine-, induced increase in aggression was accelerated by WAY-100635. These studies further support the hypothesis that selective blockade of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor augments the effects of antidepressant drugs in an animal model predictive of antidepressant activity, presumably by concomitant blockade of the somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine1A autoreceptor-mediated negative feedback system of serotonergic neurones.",

Triazolam and zolpidem produced similar dose-related decrements on several performance measures, and similar dose-related increases on most observer-rated and several subject-rated measures. The drugs differed in the time course of their effects on these measures; the effects of zolpidem typically peaked 30 min earlier (1-1.5 h postdrug) than the effects of triazolam (1.5-2 h postdrug). Triazolam and zolpidem produced a different profile of effects on other performance measures which could not be attributed to time course differences. Triazolam produced significantly more impairment than zolpidem in time estimation. Triazolam, but not zolpidem, produced significant impairment on a short-term memory task. Zolpidem produced significantly more impairment than triazolam on several novel measures of performance on a computerized trail-making test. The observed differences between triazolam and zolpidem may be related to zolpidem's reported binding selectivity for the omega 1 receptor subtype.", 
    "61": "The present experiments compared the behavioural effects of one cholecystokininA (CCKA; lorglumide) and two CCKB (PD 135,158 and LY 288513) receptor antagonists in classical animal models of anxiety, including conflict tests (punished lever pressing and Vogel drinking tests in rats) and exploratory models (elevated plus-maze test in rats and light/dark choice test in mice), and a recently developed mouse defence test battery (MDTB) which has been validated for the screening of both anti-panic and classical anxiolytic (i.e. benzodiazepines) drugs. Diazepam was used as a positive control. Results showed that all three CCK receptor antagonists were inactive in both conflict tests. Furthermore, despite the incorporation of more ethologically-derived measures (i.e. risk assessment activities or directed exploration, or both) no effects were observed in the elevated plus-maze and in the light/dark tests. These profiles contrast with that of diazepam which displayed clear anxiolytic-like effects in these models. In the MDTB, the CCK receptor antagonists failed to modify parameters (i.e. risk assessment, defensive threat/attack and escape attempts), which have been shown to be particularly sensitive to drugs effective in the treatment of generalized anxiety. By contrast, the CCKB receptor antagnoists PD 135,158 (0.001-0.01, 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and LY 288513 (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly decreased avoidance distance when the rat was first placed in the test apparatus, an effect which is consistent with an anti-panic-like action. Overall, these findings support the idea that classical animal models of anxiety may not be suitable for evaluation of the behavioural effects of CCK receptor antagonists, whereas tests which may model certain aspects of human panic such as the MDTB appear to be more reliable tools when screening such compounds.", 
    "62": "The present experiments were aimed at investigating the ability of established or putative anxiolytics to reduce the neophobia exhibited by BALB/c mice in the free exploratory paradigm. Results confirm the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepine receptor full agonist chlordiazepoxide (2.5-7.5 mg/kg), of meprobamate (15-60 mg/kg) and of ethanol (0.5-1.5 g/kg) and extend the pharmacological action of these compounds to a test situation devoid of anxiogenic components, that is to trait anxiety. The non-competitive NMDA antagonist MK 801 (0.04-0.16 mg/kg) elicited very similar behavioural effects. However, the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists yohimbine (0.5-2 mg/kg) and idazoxan (0.3-2.7 mg/kg), the barbiturate pentobarbital (3.75-30 mg/kg), the mixed 5HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin (0.25-4 mg/kg) and the D2 dopaminergic antagonist sulpiride (8-32 mg/kg) failed to decrease neophobia in BALB/c mice. The discussion focuses on the adequacy of this animal model of human pathology. The BALB/c neophobia may not model panic attacks because of the absence of worsening by the panic-provoking agent yohimbine and the lack of attenuation by CCK-B receptor antagonists. Because of its chronicity, this paradigm may model generalized anxiety, a pathology that has been suggested to overlap trait anxiety.", 
    "63": "Numerous procedures have been developed to facilitate preclinical research on the behavioural pharmacology of anxiety and, as a result of this application, are often referred to as animal models of 'anxiety'. This is an unfortunate misnomer, not only because of the apparent inability of many tests to detect novel anxiolytics consistently, but also because the term implies that anxiety is a unitary emotion. Such difficulties have arisen largely as a consequence of test development strategies which, by emphasizing pharmacological (i.e. benzodiazepine) validation, have yielded models predictive of a specific type of anxiolytic activity. The present review argues that the refinement of existing tests as well as the development of new procedures requires urgent attention to the much neglected issue of behavioural validation. From an evolutionary perspective, normal human anxiety may be conceptualized as a repertoire of defence reactions tailored to meet different forms of threats, and disorders of anxiety as the inappropriate activation or exaggeration of these usually adaptive response patterns. In this context, consideration of the defensive reactions typically observed in our animal models reveals substantially greater commonality in the behavioural effects of benzodiazepine and 5-HT1A anxiolytics than would otherwise be apparent. Therefore, with the exception of the conventional plus-maze paradigm (discussed at some length), better correspondence is seen in tests involving unconditioned response to potential threat (e.g. social interaction, distress vocalizations and light/dark exploration) than in tests of conditioned fear reactions. Even within the latter grouping, however, greater commonality is seen in procedures based on reactions to proximal threat (e.g. freezing, startle, ultrasonic vocalizations, burying) than those involving reactions to distal threat (e.g. avoidance/flight). Significantly, very similar findings have been reported in tests specifically designed to study defensive reactions (e.g. rat and mouse defence test batteries) or which incorporate a more detailed knowledge of defence into established procedures (e.g. ethological plus-maze and defensive burying paradigms). Furthermore, recent evidence also suggests that drugs with proved clinical efficacy in panic attacks/panic disorder have reliably stronger effects on flight responses than other components of the defensive repertoire. It is concluded that a focus on defensive behaviour patterns improves test validity (predictive/face/construct), offers a more rational basis for test selection in drug development programmes, and provides a firmer theoretical framework for future methodological and therapeutic advance.", 
    "64": "When ethanol is used as a training stimulus in drug discrimination experiments, benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) as well as non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists (such as ketamine) substitute for ethanol; in contrast, when a benzodiazepine or an NMDA antagonist is used as a training drug, ethanol does not substitute reliably. In the present experiments, we trained rats to discriminate a mixture of diazepam and ketamine, to test the hypothesis that ethanol would substitute for this drug combination. Using a two-lever choice procedure with food as a reinforcer, 22 rats were trained to discriminate a mixture of diazepam (5.6 mg/kg) and ketamine (10 mg/kg) from vehicle. When administered as a mixture, diazepam and ketamine substituted for the training mixture in a dose-dependent manner. When administered separately, diazepam or ketamine substituted for the mixture with full substitution occurring at 5.6 and 17.8 mg/kg, respectively. Ethanol almost completely substituted for the mixture at 1 g/kg. There was no cross-substitution between diazepam and ketamine in rats trained to discriminate diazepam (5.6 mg/kg, n = 10) or ketamine (10 mg/kg, n = 12) from vehicle. In addition, ethanol did not substitute for the training drug in either of these discriminations. These results suggest that the simultaneous action of GABAA agonist and NMDA antagonist mechanisms produce a greater ethanol-specific discriminative stimulus than activation of either component individually.", 
    "65": "Intravenous zolpidem self-injection, and the concurrent development of physical dependence under conditions of continuous drug availability, was characterized in three baboons. Previously, under similar conditions, 1.0 mg/kg midazolam maintained low, but stable, daily rates of self-injection (e.g. less than 20 injections/day) over 30 or more days and resulted in the development of physical dependence in baboons. In the current experiments, saline and zolpidem (1.0 mg/kg) were available for self-injection under a fixed-ratio (FR-30) schedule of lever-pull responses with a 5 min time-out after each injection. Saline maintained only low levels of responding (i.e. less than five injections per day). Zolpidem maintained an orderly spaced within-day pattern of injections and daily rates of self-injection were higher than saline (i.e. 10 or more injections per day). Daily rates of zolpidem self-injection were relatively stable in two baboons, and increased over time in the third baboon. Substitution of saline for zolpidem produced a rapid decrease in responding that remained low (i.e. less than five injections per day) in all three baboons. Chronic self-injection of zolpidem produced an increase in responding maintained by food pellet delivery and an increase in body weights. Administration of flumazenil (0.1-1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) after at least 35 days of zolpidem self-injection produced postures and behavioral signs typical of a classic flumazenil-precipitated benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Substitution of saline after chronic zolpidem self-injection produced a time-limited spontaneous withdrawal syndrome. Behavioral signs and postures were similar to those observed during flumazenil-precipitated withdrawal and were most prominent during the first 8 days after zolpidem was discontinued. Therefore, like midazolam, zolpidem maintained self-injection and physical dependence developed under conditions of long-term continuous availability.", 
    "66": "The effects of CR 2945, an antranilic acid derivative member of a novel family of non-peptide CCKB receptor antagonists, have been compared with those of CAM-1028, an analogue of the CCKB receptor antagonist CI-988, L-365,260 a benzodiazepine derivative CCKB antagonist, CR 1795, an analogue of the CCKA receptor antagonist lorglumide and diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, in several rodent screens sensitive to conventional anxiolytics. CR 2945 displayed nanomolar affinity for rat CCKB receptors and showed a selectivity ratio of about 9000 for the CCKB over the CCKA receptor. In ex-vivo binding studies, CR 2945, after i.v. and s.c. administration, inhibited the binding of [125I] (BH)-CCK8 in rat cortex homogenate with ID50s of 10.9 mg/kg and 13.5 mg/kg, respectively. In four rodent tests of anxiety (mouse black/white box, rat elevated plus-maze, rat elevated zero-maze and punished licking test in the rat) CR 2945 (0.1-10 mg/kg s.c. or orally) showed significant dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effects. The reference CCKB antagonist compounds CAM-1028 and L-365,260 showed an anxiolytic-like activity less robust than that of CR 2945 in the elevated zero-maze after s.c. administration, and these compounds were inactive in the elevated plus-maze after oral administration. The magnitude of the activity of CR 2945 was comparable to that of diazepam, but without signs of sedation and ataxia. Furthermore, a 7-day repeated treatment with CR 2945 at 10 mg/kg/day s.c. did not induce tolerance or withdrawal anxiety in rats. CR 1795 showed anxiolytic-like activity with a bell-shaped dose-response curve in the elevated zero-maze model in rats (0.1-10 mg/kg, orally and s.c.), whereas in the mouse black/white box test and in the rat elevated plus-maze test it was less effective. The results suggest that CR 2945 might be a promising alternative to the existing therapy of anxiety-related disorders.", 
    "67": "Previous research has shown that the rate of punished lever pressing of monkeys is typically decreased by cocaine administration. However, cocaine increases punished responding in monkeys with a history of responding maintained by the postponement of shock presentation. This raises the question of whether other behavioral effects of cocaine differ following a history of postponing shock. The present experiment examined whether a history of postponing shock alters the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. Three squirrel monkeys were trained to discriminate cocaine (0.56 mg/kg, intramuscular) from saline. Presses on the left lever produced food following saline injections whereas presses on the right lever were reinforced following administration of cocaine. Occasional test sessions were conducted in which cocaine (0.1-0.56 mg/kg), midazolam (0.03-0.56 mg/kg) or pentobarbital (0.3-5.6 mg/kg) was injected prior to the session and responding on either lever was reinforced. Discrimination training was discontinued during a second experimental phase in which responding was maintained by shock postponement. Pulling a chain postponed mild shocks for 25 s, whereas shocks occurred every 5 s in the absence of responding. Next, the drug discrimination dose-response curves were redetermined. The dose-response curves for all drugs before and after the shock postponement history were similar. This outcome suggests that the influence of a history of shock postponement is specific to punished responding.", 
    "68": "Rats were trained in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure using saline or clomethiazole (8 mg/kg, s.c. 15 min) as the training stimuli. A criterion of 9/10 days correct lever choice was adopted to select rats for substitution tests. The clomethiazole (CMZ) cue was not especially strong, and stable performance at this level was not achieved consistently. Nevertheless, in a series of substitution tests carried out in extinction, diazepam (3 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg), phenobarbital (60 mg/kg), dizocilpine (0.1 mg/kg) and mianserin (3.0 mg/kg) were found to substitute for the training dose of CMZ. The first two of these produced a percentage choice of the drug lever equal to that produced by the training dose of CMZ (full generalization) whereas the latter three produced only partial generalization. Ethanol, muscimol, allopregnanolone, chlorpromazine and amitriptyline did not generalize to CMZ. CMZ is known to potentiate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor function, a finding supported by the generalization to CMZ of the two benzodiazepines and phenobarbital. However, not all drugs acting at GABAA receptors generalized to CMZ. Although CMZ has no affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, it antagonizes a number of pharmacological responses mediated by NMDA receptors. The generalization in the drug discrimination procedure reported here support the suggestion that altering GABA activity can modulate NMDA-mediated responses. The lack of generalization after treatment with ethanol, chlorpromazine and amitriptyline suggests that the interoceptive cues are not mediated by a generalized sedation or drug-induced motor impairment.", 
    "69": "In steroid-synthesizing cells, like the MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cells, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. Expression of PBR in Escherichia coli DE3 cells, which have no PBR, no cholesterol, and do not make steroids, induced the ability to take up cholesterol in a time-dependent, temperature-sensitive, and energy-independent manner. These cells took up no other steroids tested. Addition of the high affinity PBR ligand PK 11195 to cholesterol-loaded membranes, obtained from cells transfected with PBR, resulted in the release of the uptaken cholesterol. Expression in DE3 cells of mutant PBRs demonstrated that deletions in the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus dramatically reduced the cholesterol uptake function of PBR, although it retained full capacity to bind PK 11195. Site-directed mutagenesis in the carboxy-terminal region of PBR demonstrated that bacteria expressing the mutant PBR proteins PBR(Y153S) and PBR(R156L) do not accumulate cholesterol, suggesting that amino acids Y153 and R156 are involved in the interaction of the receptor with cholesterol. Considering these results, we postulate the existence of a common cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus pattern (-L/V-(X)(1-5)-Y-(X)(1-5)-R/K-). Indeed, we found this amino acid consensus pattern in all proteins shown to interact with cholesterol. In conclusion, these data suggest that the expression of PBR confers the ability to take up and release, upon ligand activation, cholesterol. Considering the widespread occurrence of this protein and its tissue and cell specific subcellular localization, these results suggest a more general role of PBR in intracellular cholesterol transport and compartmentalization.", 
    "70": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) dose dependently increased extracellular acidification rate in Ltk cells stably expressing human recombinant alpha1beta3gamma2 GABA(A) receptors but had no effect in non-transfected controls. Cells seeded at 1 x 10(5) cells/cup, with 4-5 days induction, had basal acidification rates of 105+/-2 microVs(-1) at 37 degrees C (mean+/-standard error of mean, n=37). GABA responses had a characteristic time-course with an initial alkalinisation followed by a peak of acidification, which was optimized by increasing agonist exposure from 15 s to 25-30 s. The maximum concentration of GABA tested (100 microM) produced a 40+/-2% increase over basal acidification rate (n=3), with an EC50 of 15.5 microM and a Hill slope of 1.5. Responses were specifically antagonized by bicuculline and could be modulated by benzodiazepine ligands with varying efficacies. Full benzodiazepine agonists flunitrazepam (1 microM) and zolpidem (10 microM) significantly potentiated the response to 10 microM GABA by 124+/-15% (n=7) and 117+/-23% (n=3), respectively. The partial agonist bretazenil (100 nM) produced a 45+/-13% (n=3) potentiation whilst the inverse agonist DMCM (10 microM) (methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) inhibited the response to 20 microM GABA by 53+/-5%. The microphysiometer offers an alternative functional measure for GABA(A) receptors with the sensitivity to measure subtle modulatory effects of benzodiazepine site ligands and to determine their relative efficacy.", 
    "71": "This study examined the influence of benzodiazepine receptors on amylase release from rat parotid acinar cells. Diazepam (10(-8)-10(-6) M), which is a potent agonist of both central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, dose dependently decreased amylase release induced by isoprenaline and carbachol, which are beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor agonists, respectively. The maximum inhibitory response was obtained with 10(-6) M diazepam: amylase release was decreased to 57% (isoprenaline) and 39% (carbachol) of maximal levels, while these responses were completely inhibited by propranolol and atropine, respectively. Clonazepam and 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-5-p-chlorophenyl)-2H-1,4-benzodiazepine-2- one (Ro 5-4864), which are selective agonists of central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, respectively, also produced a significant and dose-dependent decrease in isoprenaline-induced amylase release. The inhibitory potency was diazepam > clonazepam > Ro 5-4864. Flumazenil and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK 11195), which are selective antagonists of central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, respectively, dose dependently blocked the inhibition of isoprenaline-induced amylase release by diazepam. At a concentration of 10(-5) M, flumazenil and PK 11195 restored amylase release to approximately 75% of that in the presence of isoprenaline alone. The combination of both antagonists completely prevented the inhibition by diazepam. Similarly, the inhibitory responses of clonazepam and Ro 5-4864 were completely blocked by flumazenil and PK 11195, respectively. These results suggest that, in rat parotid acinar cells, benzodiazepines inhibit beta-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor-stimulated amylase release and that both central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors contribute to this inhibitory regulation.", 
    "72": "In the present study, the regulation of acetylcholine release from the ventral hippocampus by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was investigated in vivo. GABA receptor agonists and antagonists were administered locally in the medial septum and the adjacent vertical limb of the diagonal band of Broca, or in the hippocampus by retrograde dialysis. Acetylcholine release was measured in the ventral hippocampus. In addition, the modulation of acetylcholine release via septal benzodiazepine binding sites was assessed by intraseptal administration of an agonists and an antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site. Intraseptal administration of the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol and the GABA(B) receptor agonist baclofen, but not the agonist of the benzodiazepine binding site midazolam, decreased acetylcholine release in the hippocampus. The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline and the antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site flumazenil, but not the GABA(B) receptor antagonist 3-N-(3,4,-dichlorobenzyl) aminopropyl-P-diethoxymethyphosphinic acid (CGP 52432) increased acetylcholine release in the hippocampus upon intraseptal administration. The same GABA receptor ligands were administered in the ventral hippocampus. CGP 52432 induced a small increase in acetylcholine release, whereas baclofen, muscimol and bicuculline did not affect local acetylcholine release. Thus, endogenous GABA causes tonic inhibition of acetylcholine release in the ventral hippocampus via septal GABA(A) receptors and, to a lesser extent, via GABA(B) receptors in the medial septum and hippocampus. The GABAergic inhibition in the medial septum is reduced by antagonists of the benzodiazepine binding site.", 
    "73": "LY 300164 [7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-1,3-dioxolo(4, 5H)-2,3-benzodiazepine], administered intraperitoneally up to 2 mg/kg, did not influence the threshold for electroconvulsions. In doses of 2.5-4 mg/kg, LY 300164 significantly raised the threshold. In subprotective doses against electroconvulsions, this excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist enhanced the protective activity of intraperitoneally given valproate, carbamazepine and diphenylhydantoin against maximal electroshock-induced convulsions in mice. The anticonvulsive action of phenobarbital was potentiated by LY 300164 only at 2 mg/kg. The non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist did not affect the plasma levels of the antiepileptic drugs, so a pharmacokinetic interaction is not probable. Combined treatment with LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) and the antiepileptics studied (providing 50% protection against maximal electroshock) did not impair the motor performance of mice, evaluated in the chimney test. Valproate, at its ED50 of 280 mg/kg against maximal electroshock, produced motor impairment. As shown in the passive avoidance task, combination of LY 300164 (2 mg/kg) with valproate or diphenylhydantoin resulted in impairment of long-term memory. Alone among the antiepileptics, valproate (280 mg/kg) and phenobarbital (28.5 mg/kg) disturbed long-term memory. The results suggest that blockade of glutamate-mediated events via non-NMDA receptors leads to enhancement of the anticonvulsive activity of conventional antiepileptics. Some combinations of LY 300164 with antiepileptic drugs were superior to these antiepileptics alone in terms of their lack of adverse effects.", 
    "74": "Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and micro-high-performance liquid chromatography (mu-HPLC) coupled to electrospray ionisation (ESI) mass spectrometry were compared with respect to their applicability to problems arising in pharmaceutical drug research and development. Both techniques, which are similar with regard to their operational parameters, were coupled to an API III plus triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using laboratory-built interfaces. The results achieved with the two combinations were compared for sensitivity and general applicability to the quantitative analysis of pharmaceuticals in biological fluids. Midazolam, the 8-chloro-6-(2-fluoro-phenyl)-1-methyl-4H-imidazo-[1,5-a][1,4]-benzodiaze pine, and three of its metabolites were used as test compounds, either as standard solution or after sample clean-up from human plasma. Following different sample preparation routes, liquid-liquid extraction or solid-phase extraction, differences in detection limits as well as robustness in CZE or mu-HPLC coupled with ion spray mass spectrometry (IS-MS) were investigated. Detection limits of about 500 pg/ml for the drug and 2 ng/ml for the metabolites were achieved, using 1 ml of human plasma, only when liquid-liquid extraction was used for sample preparation. Sample preparation using the simpler and faster solid-phase extraction route resulted in deterioration of the separation or clogging of the columns. In all cases, when standard solutions or sample extracts were used, CZE-ESI-MS provided both different selectivity and greater sensitivity.", 
    "75": "1. The objective of this investigation was to determine quantitatively whether experimental epilepsy is associated with a change in the pharmacodynamics of benzodiazepines in vivo. For that purpose the pharmacodynamics of midazolam were quantified by an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic approach in three different models of experimental epilepsy: amygdala kindling, cortical stimulation and genetic absence epilepsy. 2. The time course of the EEG effect was determined in conjunction with the decline of drug concentrations after intravenous administration of 10 mg kg(-1) midazolam. The pharmacokinetics of midazolam were most adequately described by a bi-exponential equation. No influence of epilepsy on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam was observed. 3. The increase in beta activity (11.5-30 Hz) of the EEG as derived by Fast Fourier Transformation analysis was used as pharmacodynamic endpoint. For each individual rat the increase in beta activity was directly related to the concentration in blood on the basis of the sigmoidal Emax pharmacodynamic model. In all three models a significant reduction in the maximal effect was observed, in amygdala kindling 28%, in the cortical stimulation model 49% and in genetic absence epilepsy 37%. No differences in the other pharmacodynamic parameters, E0 EC50,u and Hill factor, were observed. 4. It is inferred that in three different models of epilepsy there is a similar change in GABAergic functioning which is associated with a significant reduction in the intrinsic activity of midazolam in vivo. These models provide therefore a useful basis for further studies on the mechanism of epilepsy-induced changes in pharmacodynamics of anti-epileptic drugs.", 
    "76": "We investigated the withdrawal of temazepam in a single general practice using two alternative prescribing policies: an alternative benzodiazepine; or an alternative group of drugs recommended for short-term management of insomnia, including sedative antihistamines and chloral hydrate. The study showed that temazepam prescribing in general practice can be reduced or stopped by using a simple intervention. An alternative benzodiazepine is useful in helping patients to stop their use of hypnotic agents. The use of antihistamines as substitute hypnotics is not advocated on the basis of our findings.", 
    "77": "Kainic acid-induced multifocal status epilepticus in the rat is a model of medically intractable complex partial seizures and neurotoxicity. The exact mechanisms of kainic acid epileptogenic and neurotoxic effects are unknown, but enhanced glutamate release seems to be an important factor. PNU-151774E ((S)-(+)-2-(4-(3-fluorobenzyloxy) benzylamino) propanamide, methanesulfonate) is a broad-spectrum new anticonvulsant with Na+ channel-blocking and glutamate release inhibiting properties. We have examined the effect of pretreatment with this compound on both seizure activity and hippocampal neuronal damage induced by systemic injection of kainic acid in rats. Lamotrigine, a recently developed anticonvulsant with similar glutamate release inhibitory properties, was tested for comparison, together with diazepam as reference standard, on the basis of its anticonvulsant and neuroprotectant properties in this animal model. PNU-151774E, lamotrigine (10, 30 mg/kg; i.p.) and diazepam (20 mg/kg; i.p.) were administered 15 min before kainic acid (10 mg/kg; i.p.). In the vehicle-treated group, kainic acid injection caused status epilepticus in 86% of animals. Hippocampal neuronal cell loss was 66% in the CA4 hippocampal area at 7 days after kainic acid administration. Diazepam inhibited both seizures and neurotoxicity. Lamotrigine reduced hippocampal neuronal cell loss at both doses, even when it did not protect from seizures, although it showed a trend toward protection. On the other hand PNU-151774E protected from both hippocampal neurodegeneration and status epilepticus. Thus, these data support the concept that seizure prevention and neuroprotection might not be tightly coupled. Glutamate release inhibition may play a major role in neuroprotection, but an additional mechanism(s) of action might be relevant for the anticonvulsant activity of PNU-151774E in this model.", 
    "78": "A 1-year-old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate. She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum (multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome. However, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem (mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome. A relative gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-mimetic agent, was strikingly effective. This is the first reported patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate.", 
    "79": "Local anaesthesia is increasingly being used for nasal manipulation. Doubt remains over the discomfort associated with this procedure. We studied in a prospective manner, the acceptability and effectiveness of nasal manipulation with intravenous sedation and local anaesthesia, in a case series of thirty-five patients. Patients used linear analogue scales to assess outcome and pain associated with the procedure. More than half of the patients (60%) returned pain scores of only 1 out of 10. Thirty-two patients (90%) found the procedure less painful than receiving a tooth filling from the dentist, while thirty-four patients (97%) said they would undergo the same procedure again if they re-fractured their nose. The effectiveness of the treatment as assessed by an independent observer revealed that 90% of patients had achieved a significant reduction in their deformity (P = 1.27 x 10(-9).", 
    "80": "Current treatment for burning mouth syndrome is usually directed at correction of detected organic causes or is empiric, and it often involves the use of tricyclic antidepressants. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the use of benzodiazepines for burning mouth syndrome. The present study was designed to assess the effect of clonazepam in burning mouth syndrome.", 
    "81": "Thirty patients, each with a chief complaint of mouth burning without oral mucosal lesions, were entered into the study. All patients underwent routine blood screens. Identified abnormalities were corrected, when possible, before clonazepam was prescribed. The starting dose was 0.25 mg daily, with an increase in dose of 0.25 mg on a weekly basis if symptoms continued.",

All subjects had been symptomatic (average premorbid burning intensity, 7.0 +/- 1.9 on 10-point scale) for 1 month to 12 years (mean, 3.9 +/- 3.4 years; median, 2.75 years), and 16% had had burning for more than 2 years. Three groups of patients were identified: those who experienced partial to complete relief with clonazepam and who were using the medication at the last follow-up (group 1; 43%); those who found the clonazepam helpful but withdrew from the medication because of side effects--usually drowsiness (group 2; 27%); and those who did not benefit from clonazepam (group 3; 30%). Among the 3 groups, age was found to be significantly lower for group 1 than for group 2 but not significantly lower for group 1 than for group 3. Although the difference did not reach significance, the mean dose of clonazepam appeared lower for group 1 patients than for the other 2 patient groups. The number of patients with burning for less than 2 years was larger in group 1 than in the other groups.", 
    "83": "The results suggest that clonazepam may be helpful in burning mouth syndrome, inasmuch as 70% of patients (groups 1 and 2) experienced pain reduction with effects at low doses. These findings suggest that the mechanism of action of clonazepam may be specific and separate from the anxiolytic effect of the benzodiazepines and that clonazepam may represent a useful therapy in a subset of patients with burning mouth syndrome. Double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are warranted.",

All studies were performed interictally and within four weeks in each patient. Duration of epilepsy ranged from 0.1 to 42 years (median 4.0 years). SPECT was performed with the triple-headed SPECT camera Multispect 3, PET with the PET camera ECAT EXACT 47. Using linear profiles, glucose consumption, as well as uptake of ECD and IMZ, were measured in four temporal regions of interest (ROIs), and asymmetry indices were calculated (ASY).

As statistical synthesis was not possible given the heterogeneity of outcome criteria, a qualitative review is provided. Neither the SSRIs nor the TCAs appear to cause major congenital anomalies, but both may be associated with a small increased risk of minor anomalies, prematurity and neonatal complications. Benzodiazepines, lithium, anticonvulsants and chlorpromazine do lead to an increased rate of congenital anomalies as well as neonatal problems. Studies of longer-term neurobehavioural sequelae of psychotropic medications are very limited, but at present do not indicate any adverse effects.",

The treatment had no long-term effects on the acquisition of social roles related to feeding. However, DZ-exposed rats were less efficient than controls in carrying food from the feeder to the cage during the 1st session but were able to adapt and improve their performances during the 2nd one. In the home cage, DZ-exposed rats were more aggressive toward conspecifics than controls and compensated for their deficit of food by stealing it from the others. These results suggest that an early DZ exposure has long-term consequences on social behavior of rats, possibly reflecting a reduction of the level of emotionality.", 
    "99": "1. A test battery consisting of a standard open field, an enriched open field and an elevated plus maze was used to study behavior in rats. 2. Male rats of the strains PVG/OlaHsd (PVG) and Sprague-Dawley-Hsd (SPRD) (150-200 g body wt) were used to assess interstrain differences as well as handling effects. In a subsequent experiment an other set of male PVG rats (150-200 g body wt) treated either with diazepam or zolpidem was used to evaluate the test battery for pharmacological purposes. 3. SPRD rats displayed higher motor activity levels and also higher levels of exploratory behavior than the PVG rats. In contrast plus-maze activity indicated more anxiety of SPRD than PVG rats. One week pre-test handling increased the activity of both strains but it increased explorative behavior in the enriched open field only in SPRD rats. Diazepam had a substantial anxiolytic effect. Zolpidem enhanced the explorative activity in a differently to diazepam and exerted only minor anxiolytic properties. 4. We concluded that the test battery used here enables to reveal differentially strain, and treatment effects in rats.",

    "108": "We assessed the clinical utility of [11C]flumazenil-PET (FMZ-PET) prospectively in 100 epileptic patients undergoing a pre-surgical evaluation, and defined the specific contribution of this neuro-imaging technique with respect to those of MRI and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET). All patients benefited from a long term video-EEG monitoring, whereas an intracranial EEG investigation was performed in 40 cases. Most of our patients (73%) demonstrated a FMZ-PET abnormality; this hit rate was significantly higher in temporal lobe epilepsy (94%) than in other types of epilepsy (50%) (P < 0.001). Most FMZ-PET findings coexisted with a MRI abnormality (81%), including hippocampal atrophy (35%) and focal hypometabolism on FDG-PET (89%). The area of decreased FMZ binding was often smaller than that of glucose hypometabolism (48%) or larger than that of the MRI abnormality (28%). FMZ-PET did not prove superior to FDG-PET in assessing the extent of the ictal onset zone, as defined by intracranial EEG recordings. However, it provided useful data which were complementary to those of MRI and FDG-PET in three situations: (i) in temporal lobe epilepsy associated with MRI signs of hippocampal sclerosis, FMZ-PET abnormalities delineated the site of seizure onset precisely, whenever they were coextensive with FDG-PET abnormalities; (ii) in bi-temporal epilepsy, FMZ-PET helped to confirm the bilateral origin of seizures by showing a specific pattern of decreased FMZ binding in both temporal lobes in 33% of cases; (iii) in patients with a unilateral cryptogenic frontal lobe epilepsy, FMZ-PET provided further evidence of the side and site of seizure onset in 55% of cases. Thus, FMZ-PET deserves to be included in the pre-surgical evaluation of these specific categories of epileptic patients, representing approximately half of the population considered for epilepsy surgery.",

The mean age at onset (+/- SD) was 38.3 +/- 13.7 years (range 13-68 years), and the age at last follow-up was 46.3 +/- 15.7 years (range 15-80 years). These patients had received DRAs for schizophrenia (39%), for other psychiatric conditions (51.5%) and for non-psychiatric disorders (9.5%). All classes of neuroleptics used were implicated in producing tardive dystonia, which was found to develop at any time, ranging from 4 days to 23 years after their introduction (median 5, mean 6.2 +/- 5.1 years); there was no 'safe' period. Men were significantly younger than women at onset of dystonia, which developed after shorter exposure in men. At onset, the dystonia was focal in 83% of cases, but progressed over months or years and remained focal in only 17% at the time of maximum severity. The craniocervical region was involved in 87% of cases, and was the most commonly affected site both at onset and at maximum severity. There was a correlation between the site and age of onset; the site of onset ascended from the lower limbs to the face as the mean age of onset increased. Overall, the phenomenology of tardive dystonia was indistinguishable from that of primary (idiopathic) dystonia, although retrocollis and anterocollis, as well as torticollis to the right, were significantly more common in tardive dystonia. It is a very persistent disorder; only 14% of our patients had a remission over a mean follow-up period of 8.5 years. Remission occurred after a mean of 5.2 years from onset (range 1-12 years) and 2.6 years after discontinuation of neuroleptics (range 1 month to 9 years). Discontinuation of neuroleptics increased the chances of remission fourfold. Patients with < or = 10 years on neuroleptics had a five times greater chance of remission than those with > 10 years exposure, suggesting that the pathogenetic changes in tardive dystonia may become irreversible after long-term use of these drugs. None of the numerous treatments tried in these patients, including clozapine and botulinum toxin injections, seemed to relate to overall outcome, but there was a significant negative association between the occurrence of remission and the use of benzodiazepines. Although there were hints of a possible genetic predisposition, the question as to whether patients with tardive dystonia have an underlying vulnerability remains unanswered.", 
    "110": "Contraction of the guinea pig taenia caeci is mediated by muscarinic M3 receptors; however, they comprise only 30% of the muscarinic receptors present. This study investigated the role of the predominant M2 receptor population in contractions and possible second messengers involved after M3 receptors were selectively alkylated by 4-DAMP mustard [N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyldiphenylacetate] (60 nM) in the presence of otenzepad (AF-DX 116; 1 microM). Concentration-response curves to oxotremorine-M (oxo-M) in the presence of histamine and isoprenaline were performed in the presence of otenzepad (1 and 3 microM), resulting in a mean apparent pK(B) of 6.49, indicative of an M2 response. As the taenia has intrinsic tone, precontraction with histamine was not necessary and, therefore, in some experiments only isoprenaline was included. In these studies, an M3 response to oxo-M was observed, as the mean apparent pK(B) for otenzepad was 5.89. To investigate protein kinase C (PKC) involvement in the M2 response following M3 inactivation, the inhibitor chelerythrine (1 microM) was included with histamine and isoprenaline in the absence and presence of otenzepad. The oxo-M concentration-response curve was shifted by otenzepad with an apparent pK(B) value of 6.05, a value significantly different from that seen in the absence of chelerythrine (P < 0.05). These results suggest that activation of PKC by a spasmogen such as histamine is necessary to see an M2 response following M3 receptor inactivation.",

    "122": "A higher incidence of adverse events was documented than literature data. Further periods of intensive monitoring will be required to obtain a greater quantity of data from the intensive monitoring of adverse events through the MIO '97 programme.", 
    "123": "The amino acid gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) prevails in the CNS as an inhibitory neurotransmitter that mediates most of its effects through fast GABA-gated Cl(-)-channels (GABAAR). Molecular biology uncovered the complex subunit architecture of this receptor channel, in which a pentameric assembly derived from five of at least 17 mammalian subunits, grouped in the six classes alpha, beta, gamma, delta, sigma and epsilon, permits a vast number of putative receptor isoforms. The subunit composition of a particular receptor determines the specific effects of allosterical modulators of the GABAARs like benzodiazepines (BZs), barbiturates, steroids, some convulsants, polyvalent cations, and ethanol. To understand the physiology and diversity of GABAARs, the native isoforms have to be identified by their localization in the brain and by their pharmacology. In heterologous expression systems, channels require the presence of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits in order to mimic the full repertoire of native receptor responses to drugs, with the BZ pharmacology being determined by the particular alpha and gamma subunit variants. Little is known about the functional properties of the beta, delta, and epsilon subunit classes and only a few receptor subtype-specific substances like loreclezole and furosemide are known that enable the identification of defined receptor subtypes. We will summarize the pharmacology of putative receptor isoforms and emphasize the characteristics of functional channels. Knowledge of the complex pharmacology of GABAARs might eventually enable site-directed drug design to further our understanding of GABA-related disorders and of the complex interaction of excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in neuronal processing.", 
    "124": "Although the precise mechanisms whereby HIV-1 infection induces neurodegeneration have yet to be determined, a great deal of evidence has incriminated glial cells and the production of proinflammatory mediators in this pathologic process. For this reason, ideal therapeutic agents for the treatment of AIDS dementia would attenuate HIV-1 neuropathogenesis through both direct inhibition of viral expression and suppression of brain cell-produced immune mediators. Benzodiazepines (BDZs), such as Valium, are extensively prescribed drugs for anxiety disorders, which readily cross the blood-brain barrier and have demonstrated immunomodulatory properties. BDZs bind to primary human microglial cells, the principal site of HIV-1 replication in the brain, and inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) production by these cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of HIV-1-infected primary human microglial, as well as mixed glial/neuronal, cell cultures with BDZs inhibits the expression of HIV-1 p24 antigen. BDZ-induced inhibition of HIV-1 expression in chronically infected promonocytic (U1) cells has been found to be associated with decreased activation of the nuclear transcription factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Because HIV-1 expression is critically dependent on the cellular transcription machinery, inhibition of the activation of transcription factors, which participate in both HIV-1 expression and the production of neurotoxic immune mediators, by BDZ analogs may provide new therapeutic options for AIDS dementia.",

    "129": "None.", 
    "130": "A retrospective chart review was performed. The dosages of medications used were tabulated, and milligram per kilogram dosages were calculated. The procedures performed, their durations, and any complications of the anesthesia and sedation were noted. These complications included: oxygen desaturations <90%, vital sign alterations requiring intervention, rashes, subjective complaints of dizziness by the patient, and emergence reactions to ketamine. A total of 127 pediatric patients were admitted to the ICU sedation area for a total of 295 procedures. All patients received ketamine and midazolam intravenously in divided doses and titrated to effect. A total of nine complications were observed. These complications included oxygen desaturation <90% (n = 1), vital sign alterations requiring treatment (n = 3), rash (n = 2), dizziness (n = 1), wheezing (n = 1), and emergence reaction (n = 1). No patient required admission to the ICU because of a complication. There were no episodes of bradycardia or other cardiopulmonary compromise.", 
    "131": "Pediatric anesthesia and sedation, using ketamine and midazolam, can be performed in a designated monitored setting, outside of the operating room, by experienced personnel, including nonpediatricians. This therapeutic combination allows painful procedures to be performed with less anxiety and discomfort. In experienced hands, a limited number of side effects occur.", 
    "132": "The effect of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) substrates (erythromycin, midazolam) and an inhibitor (ketoconazole) on P-glycoprotein-mediated transport was studied in Caco-2, the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line expressing various functions of differentiated intestinal epithelial cells. The involvement of P-glycoprotein in the transport of these drugs was also examined. The basal-to-apical transport of rhodamine 123, a P-glycoprotein substrate, was inhibited by erythromycin, midazolam and ketoconazole, as well as by P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as verapamil. The apical-to-basal transport of rhodamine 123 was increased by these drugs. The transepithelial transport of erythromycin and midazolam, but not of ketoconazole, was much greater from the basal to apical side than from the apical to basal side. The inhibitory effect of verapamil was observed on the basal to apical transport of erythromycin, but not on midazolam and ketoconazole transport. In conclusion, erythromycin, midazolam and ketoconazole could interact with P-glycoprotein-mediated transport, and P-glycoprotein could be, at least in part, involved in the transport of erythromycin, but not of midazolam and ketoconazole, in the intestinal epithelia.", 
    "133": "A liquid chromatographic/tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) assay was developed for the quantitative determination of olanzapine (LY170053, OLZ) in human plasma and serum. Bond Elut C2 solid-phase extraction cartridges (single cartridge or 96-well format), in conjunction with a positive pressure manifold, were used to extract OLZ and its internal standard, LY170222, from the biological matrix. Chromatographic resolution of OLZ from endogenous plasma interferences and its metabolites was accomplished with a MetaChem monochrom HPLC (4.6 x 150 mm, dp 5 microns). Detection was effected with a Perkin-Elmer SCIEX API III Plus mass spectrometer using positive ion atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and a multiple reaction monitoring protocol. The linear dynamic range was from 250 pg ml-1 to 50 ng ml-1 of human plasma/serum using a 0.5 ml aliquot. The inter-day precision (relative standard deviation) and accuracy (relative error) in plasma ranged from 6.26 to 7.66% and from -3.54 to 7.52%, respectively. The intra-day precision and accuracy in serum ranged from 3.46 to 8.76% and from -8.06 to 12.46%, respectively. This assay is sensitive and selective, and will be used to support both human clinical and toxicological analyses. Furthermore, using the 96-well solid-phase extraction format, sample preparation can be easily automated.", 
    "134": "Sensory experience in early life shapes the mammalian brain. An impairment in the activity-dependent refinement of functional connections within developing visual cortex was identified here in a mouse model. Gene-targeted disruption of one isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase prevented the competitive loss of responsiveness to an eye briefly deprived of vision, without affecting cooperative mechanisms of synapse modification in vitro. Selective, use-dependent enhancement of fast intracortical inhibitory transmission with benzodiazepines restored plasticity in vivo, rescuing the genetic defect. Specific networks of inhibitory interneurons intrinsic to visual cortex may detect perturbations in sensory input to drive experience-dependent plasticity during development.",

    "136": "Anxiety of the child during the perioperative period was the primary end point. Secondary end points included anxiety of the parent and compliance of the child during induction. Children (n = 88) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) 0.5 mg/kg oral midazolam; (2) parental presence during induction of anesthesia; or (3) control (no parental presence or premedication). Using multiple behavioral measures of anxiety, the effect of the intervention on the children and their parents was assessed.", 
    "137": "Observed anxiety in the holding area (T1), entrance to the operating room (T2), and introduction of the anesthesia mask (T3) differed significantly among the three groups (P = 0.032). Post hoc analysis indicated that children in the midazolam group exhibited significantly less anxiety compared with the children in the parental-presence group or control group (P = 0.0171). Similarly, parental anxiety scores after separation were significantly less in the midazolam group compared with the parental-presence or control groups (P = 0.048). The percentage of inductions in which compliance of the child was poor was significantly greater in the control group compared with the parental-presence and midazolam groups (25% vs. 17% vs. 0%, P = 0.013).",

    "141": "Of 25 hospitalizations, 13 (52%) resulted in death, and 12 (48%) patients survived to discharge. Death was associated with the number of acute, life-threatening medical problems on presentation (survivors, 1.8; fatalities, 2.8; p = 0.013) and with generalized EEG pattern (p = 0.017). Higher doses or greater number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) did not improve outcome. Treatment with intravenous benzodiazepines was associated with increased risk of death (p = 0.033). Ten patients with advance directives were managed outside the intensive care unit (ICU). Mean hospitalization was 39 days in the ICU group and 22 for those with advance directives (p = 0.017).", 
    "142": "Severity of illness correlates with mortality in critically ill elderly patients with NCSE. Treatment with intravenous benzodiazepines may increase their risk of death. Aggressive ICU management may prolong hospitalization at considerable cost, without improving outcome. It is unclear whether NCSE affects outcome in the critically ill elderly or is merely a marker for severity of disease in predisposed patients. The benefits of aggressive therapy are unclear. Carefully controlled, prospective trials will be necessary to determine the best therapies for NCSE in the critically ill elderly and the appropriate role of the ICU in their management.",

    "144": "Williams syndrome (WS) is associated with neurobehavioral abnormalities that include irritability and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Parents often report children having difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep because of restlessness and arousals. Therefore we evaluated a group of children with WS for the presence of a movement arousal sleep disorder.", 
    "145": "Twenty-eight families of children with WS participated in a telephone survey aimed to screen for a movement arousal disorder. Of the 16 children identified as having such a disorder, 7 (mean age, 3.9 +/- 2.2 years) underwent polysomnography. Their studies were compared with those of 10 matched control subjects (mean age, 5.3 +/- 2.0 years).", 
    "146": "The 7 subjects with WS who were screened by the survey had sleep latency, total sleep time, arousals, and awakenings that were similar to those of control subjects. However, they presented with a disorder of periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS). The PLMS index in the subjects with WS was 14.9 +/- 6.2 versus 2.8 +/- 1.9 in control subjects (P < .0001). In addition, arousal and awakening in subjects with WS were strongly associated with PLMS. Moreover, children with WS spend more time awake during sleep periods than control subjects (10.0% +/- 7.0% vs 4.4% +/- 4.7%; P < .05). Five children were treated with clonazepam, and in 4 a significant clinical response was noted.",

Baclofen and THPO induced antinociception in the tail flick test. Morphine, and the CCK receptor antagonists, MK-329, L-365,260 and proglumide also induced antinociception. The CCK receptor antagonists potentiated antinociceptive response induced by both baclofen and THPO. It may be concluded that cholecystokinin receptor mechanism(s) may interact with antinociception induced by GABA receptor mechanism(s).", 
    "149": "Opioid tolerance and withdrawal have been challenges for decades. The neurochemical mechanisms of tolerance and dependence are clinically important only because they can affect weaning schedules and the adjustment of doses for neonates. Analgesic effects are characterized by an increased depolarization threshold for the neuron, shorter duration of the action potential generated, and reduced release of neurotransmitters. Tolerance and withdrawal are associated with the reversal of these cellular effects. Adverse clinical effects associated with the use of opioids in neonates include respiratory depression, chest wall rigidity, urinary retention, and decreased gastrointestinal motility. The physiological systems most prominently affected by opioid withdrawal include the central nervous system, gastrointestinal system, and the autonomic nervous system. Opioid withdrawal symptoms in neonates can be assessed by using easily available scoring systems, although these need to be validated for different populations. Management of opioid withdrawal includes the use of other opioids, benzodiazepines and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor antagonist, clonidine. Careful titration of opioids with attention given to appropriate weaning schedules can reduce the incidence of withdrawal in neonates.",

    "151": "Using a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study design, 14 subjects were administered midazolam on two separate occasions (at least 2 weeks apart). The subjects were randomly distributed into two groups: syringe and needle (saline)/jet injector (midazolam) or syringe and needle (midazolam)/jet injector (saline). The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) or a placebo at the injection site for the first administration and the other topical agent on the second visit. Each subject received one subcutaneous injection in the deltoid region per arm per day. Each injection contained the same volume of solution. Subjects completed visual analog scale (VAS) questionnaires assessing the discomfort of the injection. Blood samples were taken at specified intervals over 2 hours for determination of midazolam levels.", 
    "152": "The discomfort associated with the injection was less with the Biojector 2000 (Bioject Inc, Portland, OR) although this was not statistically significant. However, persistent discomfort was significantly greater at the needle site. The mean peak plasma level of midazolam was achieved more rapidly with the Biojector 2000 than with the syringe and needle (P < .05). However, the peak plasma level after jet injection or injection with a syringe and needle was not statistically different.", 
    "153": "The results of the study show that the Biojector 2000 is a needle-free injection system that can be used for the administration of a premedicant before induction of anesthesia. It has several advantages, including the potential reduction of anxiety associated with the \"fear of needles\" and occupational injuries.", 
    "154": "The authors administered to two groups (56 and 44) patients before gastroscopy analgosedation-5 mg diazepam and local anaesthesia of the throat. To the first group diazepam was administered by the i.v., to the second group by the sublingual route. The objective was to find out whether analgosedation is desirable from the patients aspect and whether the sublingual form of premedication is accepted by the patients. The authors found that 90% of the patients wish to have analgosedation and anaesthesia before the procedure. The sublingual form of administration was accepted by 89% of the patients."
