Expression of Aes was decreased in liver metastases compared with primary colon tumors in both mice and humans. Aes inhibited Notch signaling by converting active Rbpj transcription complexes into repression complexes on insoluble nuclear matrix. In tumor cells, Notch signaling was triggered by ligands on adjoining blood vessels, and stimulated transendothelial migration. Genetic depletion of Aes in Apc(\u0394716) intestinal polyposis mice caused marked tumor invasion and intravasation that were suppressed by Notch signaling inhibition. These results suggest that inhibition of Notch signaling can be a promising strategy for prevention and treatment of colon cancer metastasis.",

    "3": "Forty consecutive patients with neurological disorders (encephalopathy, autism, and epilepsy) were referred to dental treatment, and 45 sedations were performed; all were sedated with Midazolam (intramuscular 0.2-0.3 mg/kg or intravenous 0.1mg/kg) and all were anesthetised with lidocaine 2% (0.5-2 mL). During the dental procedure, their behavior was analysed and classified into 3 categories: A (indifferent), B (reacted but allowed treatment), and C (did not allow treatment). Data were tabbed and statistically analysed.",

Methods: As part of a larger research program on high-risk medications and patient injuries, we identified 17,558 patients receiving benzodiazepine outpatient prescriptions at one Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospital system, with 9,304 individuals more than 59 years old. Adverse outcomes of interest, viz., inpatient or outpatient health care encounters coded as injuries while using benzodiazepines, were analyzed. Direct medical costs for inpatient stays and average costs for outpatient visits were obtained from cost extracts from the VHA Decision Support System. Modified Beers criteria (Zhan et al., JAMA 2001;286(22):2823\u20139) for potentially inappropriate medications in the elderly, irrespective of dose, were applied to three years of outpatient prescription data for the cohort of patients more than 59 years old. More than 1 million outpatient prescriptions were analyzed by Zhan's modified Beers inappropriateness categories, namely, always avoid, rarely appropriate, and some indications. Results: For the 17,558 patients receiving outpatient benzodiazepines, we identified 297 inpatient injury admissions and 2,977 outpatient injury encounters for 1,352 patients that occurred while using benzodiazepines at the time of the injury. Over $3 million dollars in direct medical costs were associated with these injuries. Conclusions: Pharmacy Benefit Management data linked with clinical administrative data can be used to identify evidence of adverse events (patient injuries) linked to potentially inappropriate prescribing patterns in elderly outpatients.",

    "12": "The review currently includes 45 blinded RCTs with 7760 participants. The number of RCTs available for each comparison varied: four studies compared risperidone with amisulpride, two with aripiprazole, 11 with clozapine, 23 with olanzapine, eleven with quetiapine, two with sertindole, three with ziprasidone and none with zotepine. Attrition from these studies was high (46.9%), leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Furthermore, 60% were industry sponsored, which can be a source of bias.There were few significant differences in overall acceptability of treatment as measured by leaving the studies early. Risperidone was slightly less acceptable than olanzapine, and slightly more acceptable than ziprasidone in this regard.Risperidone improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) slightly less than olanzapine (15 RCTs, n = 2390, MD 1.94 CI 0.58 to 3.31), but slightly more than quetiapine (9 RCTs, n = 1953, MD -3.09 CI -5.16 to -1.01) and ziprasidone (3 RCTs, n = 1016, MD -3.91 CI -7.55 to -0.27). The comparisons with the other SGA drugs were equivocal. Risperidone was also less efficacious than olanzapine and clozapine in terms of leaving the studies early due to inefficacy, but more efficacious than ziprasidone in the same outcome.Risperidone produced somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects than a number of other SGAs (use of antiparkinson medication versus clozapine 6 RCTs, n = 304, RR 2.57 CI 1.47 to 4.48, NNH 6 CI 33 to 3; versus olanzapine 13 RCTs, n = 2599, RR 1.28 CI 1.06 to 1.55, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100; versus quetiapine 6 RCTs, n = 1715, RR 1.98 CI 1.16 to 3.39, NNH 20 CI 10 to 100; versus ziprasidone 2 RCTs, n = 822, RR 1.42 CI 1.03 to 1.96, NNH not estimable; parkinsonism versus sertindole 1 RCT, n = 321, RR 4.11 CI 1.44 to 11.73, NNH 14 CI 100 to 8). Risperidone also increased prolactin levels clearly more than all comparators, except for amisulpride and sertindole for which no data were available.Other adverse events were less consistently reported, but risperidone may well produce more weight gain and/or associated metabolic problems than amisulpride (weight gain: 3 RCTs, n = 585, MD 0.99 CI 0.37 to 1.61), aripiprazole (cholesterol increase: 1 RCT, n = 83, MD 22.30 CI 4.91 to 39.69) and ziprasidone (cholesterol increase 2 RCTs, n = 767, MD 8.58 CI 1.11 to 16.04) but less than clozapine (weight gain 3 RCTs n = 373, MD -3.30 CI -5.65 to -0.95), olanzapine (weight gain 13 RCTs, n = 2116, MD -2.61 CI -3.74 to -1.48), quetiapine (cholesterol increase: 5 RCTs, n = 1433, MD -8.49 CI -12. 23 to -4.75) and sertindole (weight gain: 2 RCTs, n = 328, MD -0.99 CI -1.86 to -0.12). It may be less sedating than clozapine and quetiapine, lengthen the QTc interval less than sertindole (QTc change: 2 RCTs, n = 495, MD -18.60 CI -22.37 to 14.83), produce fewer seizures than clozapine (2 RCTs, n = 354, RR 0.22 CI 0.07 to 0.70, NNT 14 CI 8 to 33) and less sexual dysfunction in men than sertindole (2 RCTs, n = 437, RR 0.34 CI 0.16 to 0.76, NNT 13 CI 8 to 33).", 
    "13": "Risperidone seems to produce somewhat more extrapyramidal side effects and clearly more prolactin increase than most other SGAs. It may also differ from other compounds in efficacy and in the occurrence of other adverse effects such as weight gain, metabolic problems, cardiac effects, sedation and seizures. Nevertheless, the large proportion of participants leaving studies early and incomplete reporting of outcomes makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions. Further large trials, especially comparing risperidone with those other new drugs for which only a few RCTs are available, are needed.", 
    "14": "Hippocampal function has been implicated in mood and anxiety disorders, as well as in the response to antidepressant (AD) treatment. However, the significance of new neurons in the therapeutic mechanism of ADs remains unclear. In this study, the proliferation of new neurons was inhibited through conditional deletion of ataxia telangeictasia-mutated and rad-3 related (ATR), a cell cycle checkpoint kinase, and cellular and behavioral outcomes following AD exposure were evaluated. ATR was conditionally deleted by microinjecting a Cre recombinase-expressing virus into the hippocampus of floxed-ATR mice. Behavioral assessment in multiple rodent models of affective state revealed anxiolytic-like behavior in the elevated zero maze, marble burying test, and novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test. The efficacy of chronic desipramine (DMI) treatment was evaluated in the NIH test, as this paradigm is thought to be sensitive to increases in neurogenesis by chronic AD exposure. Chronic exposure to DMI reduced hyponeophagia in the NIH test in control mice, whereas DMI had no behavioral effect in ATR-deleted mice. Although DMI did not alter cell proliferation in either group, it did produce a robust increase in dendritic spine density in control mice, indicative of enhanced neuronal plasticity. This effect of DMI on spine density was severely attenuated following ATR deletion. These findings demonstrate that reductions in basal neurogenesis produce an anxiolytic phenotype and reduce AD efficacy in behaviors requiring chronic exposure. Furthermore, attenuated capacity for synaptic remodeling may underlie these behaviors. ATR deletion may serve as a valuable model to study the various proposed roles of newborn neurons in the hippocampus.", 
    "15": "GABA(A) receptors mediate the action of many clinically important drugs interacting with different binding sites. For some potential binding sites, no interacting drugs have yet been identified. Here, we established a steric hindrance procedure for the identification of drugs acting at the extracellular \u03b11+\u03b23- interface, which is homologous to the benzodiazepine binding site at the \u03b11+\u03b32- interface. On screening of >100 benzodiazepine site ligands, the anxiolytic pyrazoloquinoline 2-p-methoxyphenylpyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 9895) was able to enhance GABA-induced currents at \u03b11\u03b23 receptors from rat. CGS 9895 acts as an antagonist at the benzodiazepine binding site at nanomolar concentrations, but enhances GABA-induced currents via a different site present at \u03b11\u03b23\u03b32 and \u03b11\u03b23 receptors. By mutating pocket-forming amino acid residues at the \u03b11+ and the \u03b23- side to cysteines, we demonstrated that covalent labeling of these cysteines by the methanethiosulfonate ethylamine reagent MTSEA-biotin was able to inhibit the effect of CGS 9895. The inhibition was not caused by a general inactivation of GABA(A) receptors, because the GABA-enhancing effect of ROD 188 or the steroid \u03b1-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone was not influenced by MTSEA-biotin. Other experiments indicated that the CGS 9895 effect was dependent on the \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunit types forming the interface. CGS 9895 thus represents the first prototype of drugs mediating benzodiazepine-like modulatory effects via the \u03b1+\u03b2- interface of GABA(A) receptors. Since such binding sites are present at \u03b1\u03b2, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3, and \u03b1\u03b2\u03b4 receptors, such drugs will have a much broader action than benzodiazepines and might become clinical important for the treatment of epilepsy.", 
    "16": "Affective disorders, which include anxiety and depression, are highly prevalent and have overwhelming emotional and physical symptoms. Despite human brain imaging studies, which have implicated the prefrontal cortex including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), little is known about the ACC in anxiety disorders. Here we show that the ACC does modulate anxiety-like behavior in adult mice, and have identified a protein that is critical for this modulation. Absence of neurabin, a cytoskeletal protein, resulted in reduced anxiety-like behavior and increased depression-like behavior. Selective inhibition of neurabin in the ACC reproduced the anxiety but not the depression phenotype. Furthermore, loss of neurabin increased the presynaptic release of glutamate and cingulate neuronal excitability. These findings reveal novel roles of the ACC in anxiety disorders, and provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of anxiety disorders.",

Their physical stability in air at room temperature and oral mucosal absorption in rats were investigated.",

The effective concentration for humans and rats (20\u2009ng/mL or more) was achieved within 30\u2009min after buccal administration for both PEG/CZ/OA and PEG/CZ. The plasma concentration increased gradually and less varied at each time point for PEG/CZ/OA. PEG/CZ/OA was found to show more rapid and higher absorption of CZ in buccal administration than in sublingual administration.",

Twenty-one epidemiological studies (13 case-control and 8 cohort studies) fulfilled the inclusion criteria by estimating the accident risk associated with drug exposure (ascertained by blood/urine analysis or prescription records). Sixty-nine experimental studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria by testing actual or simulated driving performance after administering a single dose or multiple doses.",

Co-ingestion of benzodiazepines and alcohol was associated with a 7.7-fold increase in the accident risk (pooled OR 7.69; 95% CI 4.33, 13.65). Subgroup analysis of case-control studies showed a lower benzodiazepine-associated accident risk in elderly (>65 years of age) drivers (pooled OR 1.13; 95% CI 0.97, 1.31) than in drivers <65 years of age (pooled OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.31, 3.73), a result consistent with age-stratified risk differences reported in cohort studies. Anxiolytics, taken in single or multiple doses during the daytime, impaired driving performance independent of their half-lives. With hypnotics, converging evidence from experimental and epidemiological studies indicates that diazepam, flurazepam, flunitrazepam, nitrazepam and the short half-life non-benzodiazepine hypnotic zopiclone significantly impair driving, at least during the first 2-4 weeks of treatment. The accident risk was higher in the elderly (>65 years of age) who use tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs); however, the evidence for an association of antidepressants with accident risk in younger drivers was equivocal. Sedative but not non-sedative antidepressants were found to cause short-term impairment of several measures of driving performance. Limited epidemiological research reported that opioids may be associated with increased accident risk in the first few weeks of treatment.",

The association was more pronounced in the younger drivers. The accident risk was markedly increased by co-ingestion of alcohol. Driving impairment was generally related to plasma half-lives of hypnotics, but with notable exceptions. Anxiolytics, with daytime dosing, impaired driving independent of their half-lives. TCAs appeared to be associated with increased accident risk, at least in the elderly, and caused short-term impairment in driving performance. Opioid users may be at a higher risk of traffic accidents; however, experimental evidence is limited on their effects on driving.",

    "35": "GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS). The type A GABA receptor (GABA(A)R) system is the primary pharmacological target for many drugs used in clinical anesthesia. The \u03b11, \u03b22, and \u03b32 subunit-containing GABA(A)Rs located in the various parts of CNS are thought to be involved in versatile effects caused by inhaled anesthetics and classic benzodiazepines (BZD), both of which are widely used in clinical anesthesiology. During the past decade, the emergence of tonic inhibitory conductance in extrasynaptic GABA(A)Rs has coincided with evidence showing that these receptors are highly sensitive to the sedatives and hypnotics used in anesthesia. Anesthetic enhancement of tonic GABAergic inhibition seems to be preferentially increased in regions shown to be important in controlling memory, awareness, and sleep. This review focuses on the physiology of the GABA(A)Rs and the pharmacological properties of clinically used BZDs. Although classic BZDs are widely used in anesthesiological practice, there is a constant need for new drugs with more favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects and fewer side effects. New hypnotics are currently developed, and promising results for one of these, the GABA(A)R agonist remimazolam, have recently been published.",

Male Wistar rats were pretreated with a specific CCK(1) receptor antagonist (devazepide; 1 mg kg(-1); i.p.) or vehicle; 30 min later they received LPS (100 \u03bcg kg(-1); i.p.) or saline injection. Food intake, corticosterone responses and Fos-CRF and Fos-\u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) immunoreactivity in the hypothalamus and Fos-tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) were evaluated. In comparison with saline treatment, LPS administration decreased food intake and increased plasma corticosterone levels, as well as the number of Fos-CRF and Fos- tyrosine hydroxylase double-labelled neurons in vehicle-pretreated rats; no change in Fos-\u03b1-MSH immunoreactivity was observed after LPS injection. In saline-treated animals, devazepide pretreatment increased food intake, but it did not modify other parameters compared with vehicle-pretreated rats. Devazepide pretreatment partly reversed LPS-induced hypophagia and Fos-CRF and brainstem neuronal activation. Devazepide did not modify the corticosterone and Fos-\u03b1-MSH responses in rats treated with LPS. In conclusion, the present data suggest that LPS-induced hypophagia is mediated at least in part by CCK effects, via CCK(1) receptor, on NTS and hypothalamic CRF neurons.", 
    "51": "A rapid, sensitive, and specific ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS/MS) assay method for simultaneous determination of 13 benzodiazepine compounds in human urine was developed and validated. Aliquots of 0.5 mL of urine specimens were used for the analysis and the benzodiazepines were extracted by single step methanol (containing 0.2% formic acid) precipitation and then separated on a BEH C18 (50 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm) analytical column with the temperature maintained at 45\u00b0C. The mobile phases consisted of methanol and water (both containing 0.2% formic acid) and the flow rate was 0.4 mL/min. The TQ detector, equipped with an electrospray ionization ion source, was set up with a positive mode. The acquisitions were performed in multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM) and the limit of quantification was 20 ng/mL for all of the 13 compounds. The low limits of detections (LODs) of the benzodiazepines in this method were between 0.5 and 2 ng/mL. The chromatographic separation time was 4 min and calibration curves in human urine were generated over the range of 20-2000 ng/mL. The method validation parameters such as accuracy, precision, carryover, recovery, stability, and specificity for all of the 13 compounds were within the acceptable range. This method is suitable for the high throughput screening of benzodiazepines in clinical laboratories.", 
    "52": "The (1)H\u2192(13)C NMR cross-polarization (CP) was studied under magic-angle spinning at 7.5 kHz in various crystal forms of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine: two polymorphs (metastable I and stable II) and eight solvates containing organic solvent and water molecules. The CP kinetics followed the non-classical I-I(*)-S model, in which CP begins in a spin cluster of proximate abundant spins I(*) and rare spins S, then is controlled by spin diffusion of the abundant spins I from bulk to the I(*) spins of the spin cluster and finally is governed by spin-lattice relaxation of the abundant spins in the rotating frame. The corresponding CP kinetics parameters were determined and analyzed. It was demonstrated that the, \u03bb and T(df) values (the CP time constant, the cluster composition parameter and the (1)H spin-diffusion constant, respectively) were very useful to discriminate the functional groups, especially in the 3D parameter space. In order to conveniently analyze the large amount (175) of the collected CP parameters, the number of the observed variables was reduced using the principal component (PC) analysis. The 2D plot of PC2 vs. PC1 showed adequate separation of the CH(3), CH(2), CH and C cases (C stands for carbons without adjacent hydrogens). It was demonstrated that those cases were located along the PC1 axis in the order of increasing (1)H-(13)C dipolar couplings: C<CH(3)<CH<CH(2). Our study showed the I-I(*)-S model at work and established ranges of its parameters for various functional groups.",

    "59": "Linear dependence between temperature (t) and retention coefficient (k, reversed phase HPLC) of bile acids is obtained. Parameters (a, intercept and b, slope) of the linear function k=f(t) highly correlate with bile acids' structures. Investigated bile acids form linear congeneric groups on a principal component (calculated from k=f(t)) score plot that are in accordance with conformations of the hydroxyl and oxo groups in a bile acid steroid skeleton. Partition coefficient (K(p)) of nitrazepam in bile acids' micelles is investigated. Nitrazepam molecules incorporated in micelles show modified bioavailability (depo effect, higher permeability, etc.). Using multiple linear regression method QSAR models of nitrazepams' partition coefficient, K(p) are derived on the temperatures of 25\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. For deriving linear regression models on both temperatures experimentally obtained lipophilicity parameters are included (PC1 from data k=f(t)) and in silico descriptors of the shape of a molecule while on the higher temperature molecular polarisation is introduced. This indicates the fact that the incorporation mechanism of nitrazepam in BA micelles changes on the higher temperatures. QSAR models are derived using partial least squares method as well. Experimental parameters k=f(t) are shown to be significant predictive variables. Both QSAR models are validated using cross validation and internal validation method. PLS models have slightly higher predictive capability than MLR models.", 
    "60": "Recent studies have suggested that some atypical antipsychotic drugs may have protective properties against oxidative stress. To confirm these findings, we investigated the protective effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone on oxidative stress induced by the N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)) ion in PC12 cells. Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic drug, was used for comparison. We determined the antioxidant effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs using a number of measures, including cell viability, the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and Bax levels. MPP(+) treatment induced significant loss of cell viability, the formation of ROS, reduction of SOD activity, and up-regulation of Bax expression. However, olanzapine, aripiprazole and ziprasidone reversed these effects caused by MPP(+) treatment, but ziprasidone did not influence cell viability. In contrast, haloperidol did not affect all these effects. Moreover, haloperidol strongly increased the expression of Bax under MPP(+)-free conditions. Olanzapine, aripiprazole, and ziprasidone, but not haloperidol, may exert antioxidant effects through modulating ROS levels, SOD activity, and Bax expression to provide protective effects against MPP(+)-induced oxidative stress in PC12 cells. These results suggest that some atypical antipsychotic drugs have a useful therapeutic effect by reducing oxidative stress in schizophrenic patients.", 
    "61": "The scototaxis test has been introduced recently to assess anxiety-like phenotypes in fish, including zebrafish. Parametric analyses suggest that scototaxis represents an approach-avoidance conflict, which hints at anxiety. In this model, white avoidance represents anxiety-like behavior, while the number of shuttling events represents activity. Acute or chronic fluoxetine, buspirone, benzodiazepines, ethanol, caffeine and dizocilpine were assessed using the light-dark box (scototaxis) test in zebrafish. Acute fluoxetine treatment did not alter white avoidance, but altered locomotion in the higher dose; chronic treatment (2 weeks), on the other hand, produced an anxiolytic effect with no locomotor outcomes. The benzodiazepines produced a hormetic (inverted U-shaped) dose-response profile, with intermediate doses producing anxiolysis and no effect at higher doses; clonazepam, a high-potency benzodiazepine agonist, produced a locomotor impairment at the highest dose. Buspirone produced an anxiolytic profile, without locomotor impairments. Moclobemide did not produce behavioral effects. Ethanol also produced a hormetic profile in white avoidance, with locomotor activation in 0.5% concentration. Caffeine produced an anxiogenic profile, without locomotor effects. These results suggest that the light-dark box is sensitive to anxiolytic and anxiogenic drugs in zebrafish.", 
    "62": "Harmane, harmine and norharmane are \u03b2-carboline compounds which have been referred to as inverse agonists of benzodiazepine receptors. The effect of these compounds on apomorphine-induced licking behavior was studied in rats. Subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg) induced licking. The licking behavior was counted with a hand counter and recorded for a period of 75 min by direct observation. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of harmane (1.25-5 mg/kg), harmine (2.5-10 mg/kg) and norharmane (1.25-5 mg/kg) significantly reduced the licking behavior. In rats pretreated with reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p., 18 h before the test), the effects of harmane (4 mg/kg, i.p.), harmine (7.8 mg/kg, i.p.) and norharmane (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.) were unchanged. When flumazenil (2 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 20 min before apomorphine, it was able to antagonize the effects of harmane, harmine and norharmane. It was concluded that the \u03b2-carbolines harmane, harmine and norharmane reduce the licking behavior via an inverse agonistic mechanism located in the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "63": "Many patients with refractory epilepsy are treated with polytherapy, and nearly 15% of epilepsy patients receive two or more anti-convulsant agents. The anti-convulsant stiripentol is used as an add-on treatment for the childhood epilepsy syndrome known as severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (Dravet syndrome). Stiripentol has multiple mechanisms of action, both enhancing GABA(A) receptors and reducing activity of metabolic enzymes that break down other drugs. Stiripentol is typically co-administered with other anti-convulsants such as benzodiazepines which also act through GABA(A) receptor modulation. Stiripentol slows the metabolism of some of these drugs through inhibition of a variety of cytochrome P450 enzymes, but could also influence their effects on GABAergic neurotransmission. Is it rational to co-administer drugs which can act through the same target? To examine the potential interaction between these modulators, we transiently transfected HEK-293T cells to produce \u03b13\u03b23\u03b32L or \u03b13\u03b23\u03b4 recombinant GABA(A) receptors. Using whole-cell patch clamp recordings, we measured the response to each benzodiazepine alone and in combination with a maximally effective concentration of stiripentol. We compared the responses to four different benzodiazepines: diazepam, clonazepam, clobazam and norclobazam. In all cases we found that these modulators were equally effective in the presence and absence of stiripentol. The \u03b4-containing receptors were insensitive to modulation by the benzodiazepines, which did not affect potentiation by stiripentol. These data suggest that stiripentol and the benzodiazepines act independently at GABA(A) receptors and that polytherapy could be expected to increase the maximum effect beyond either drug alone, even without consideration of changes in metabolism.", 
    "64": "Dihydrocodeine (DHC) is an opioid analgesic sometimes prescribed as an alternative to other medications (e.g. methadone and buprenorphine) for opioid misuse. Its effectiveness is, however, still controversial. DHC prescription rates seem to be related to levels of DHC fatalities, possibly in relation to levels of disregard of the availability of supervised or interval dispensing of opioids, but no large-scale analysis of DHC fatalities has been carried out. We analysed here involvement of DHC in fatalities that occurred between 1997 and 2007 among individuals with a history of opiate/opioid misuse reported to the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD).", 
    "65": "DHC, either alone or in combination, was identified in 584 fatalities. Typical cases identified were males in their early thirties. In accidental overdoses, DHC, which had been prescribed to 45% of the victims, was typically identified in combination with other drugs, such as heroin/morphine, methadone and hypnotics/sedatives. Both paracetamol and antidepressants were more typically identified in combination with DHC in suicides. Opiate/opioid misusers should be educated about risks associated with polydrug intake and prescribers should carefully consider a pharmacological intervention alternative to DHC (e.g. methadone, buprenorphine) when managing and treating opiate addiction.",

These cases represented about 6.8% of all opiate/opioid-related deaths during this period. Typical DHC cases identified were White males in their early thirties. Accidental deaths (96%) were likely to involve DHC in combination with other psychoactives, mainly heroin/morphine, hypnotics/sedatives and methadone. Both paracetamol and antidepressants were found in proportionately more suicide cases than in accidental overdoses. DHC had been prescribed to the decedent in at least 45% of cases.", 
    "69": "Opiate/opioid misusers should be educated about risks associated with polydrug intake.

    "70": "For patients who have Eisenmenger syndrome (ES), perioperative risks are high even for noncardiac surgery, such as dental extractions. We report on the case history of a 38-year-old male patient with Down syndrome (DS), intellectual disability (ID), and ES. The patient was scheduled for extraction of the right maxillary second molar tooth. His physical health was poor. Following oxygenation, midazolam was administered intravenously very slowly until the optimum sedative level was obtained, with a total dosage of 3.5 mg. There were no marked changes in vital signs during the perioperative period, and the patient was discharged the same day. This case suggests that moderate or conscious sedation using midazolam for dental treatment of a patient with DS, ID, and ES was well tolerated. Several critical points are presented in this review.", 
    "71": "Taurine, a sulfur-containing amino acid, has high hydrophilicity and is poorly absorbed. Tauropyrone, a taurine-containing 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, is suggested to have greater activity than taurine owing to improved physicochemical properties that facilitate delivery of the compound to target cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether the 1,4-dihydropyridine moiety in tauropyrone improves the pharmacological efficacy of taurine in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "72": "The effects of taurine and tauropyrone, as well as of the 1,4-dihydropyridine moiety were compared in in-vitro experiments to determine the binding to GABA receptors and influence on mitochondrial processes (isolated rat liver mitochondria), and in in-vivo tests to assess the influence on behavioural effects caused by the GABA-A receptor ligands, bicuculline, diazepam and ethanol.", 
    "73": "Unlike taurine, tauropyrone did not display binding activity for the GABA-A receptor, and only taurine (but not tauropyrone) at low doses (0.1, 1.0 and 10 mg/kg) antagonised the bicuculline-induced convulsion effect. Taurine and tauropyrone had no effect on diazepam myorelaxing action, and they both exerted a comparable 'anti-ethanol' effect (shortening of the ethanol-sleeping time). Taurine and tauropyrone did not influence processes of mitochondrial bioenergetics.", 
    "74": "The action of tauropyrone at the level of the GABA-A receptor differs qualitatively from that of taurine, probably because of its 1,4-dihydropyridine moiety, which may hinder access to the GABA-A receptor GABA site.

For triazolam, testosterone, and midazolam \u03b1-hydroxylation, mean values of \u03b1 (indicating the 'mix' of competitive and noncompetitive inhibition) ranged from 2.1 to 6.3. However, inhibition of midazolam 4-hydroxylation was consistent with a competitive process. Determination of K(i) and \u03b1 based on the relation between 50% inhibitory concentration values and substrate concentration yielded similar values. Pre-incubation of ketoconazole with microsomes before addition of substrate did not enhance inhibition, whereas inhibition by troleandomycin was significantly enhanced by pre-incubation.",

Injection of buprenorphine (28%), benzodiazepines (28%) and methamphetamines (49%) was reported. Nearly all (97%) of those reporting unprotected sex did so with someone not known to be HIV-infected. While 51% believed that opioid substitution therapy (OST) would be helpful, only 33% believed they needed it to prevent relapse after prison release. Most participants (70%) expressed interest in learning more about OST. Those reporting the highest injection risks were more likely to believe OST would be helpful (p<0.05), to believe that it was needed to prevent relapse post-release (p<0.05), and to express interest in learning more about OST (p<0.01).",

The forensic autopsy showed many superficial skin lacerations, bruises and minor brain swelling, but there was no definitive cause of death. Toxicological analysis showed a high concentration of mephedrone in femoral blood (5.1mg/L) and traces of cocaine, MDMA and oxazepam. The remaining dose of mephedrone in the stomach contents was estimated at 113 mg. Tablets that were found in the house of the deceased also contained mephedrone. We attribute this man's death to a fatal oral intake of mephedrone, which probably led to a state of excited delirium. This was aggravated by blood loss from multiple wounds.",

It is generally approved for the treatment of major depression, its efficacy is well-documented in elderly patients, and it has been widely used for replacement of benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine-type sleeping drugs due to its anxiolytic efficacy and sleep normalizing effect in depression. Trazodone was further found to be clinically useful in generalized anxiety disorder, agitation of patients with dementia and organic disorders, chronic pain disorders, alcohol and benzodiazepine dependence. Tolerability of trazodone is comparable to the novel antidepressants. It is weight neutral and does not decrease sexual function.

    "108": "Oral fluid is an alternative biological matrix that might have advantages over urine for drug analysis in treatment programs. A liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method has been used for screening 32 of the most commonly abused drugs and their metabolites in 0.5 mL preserved oral fluid, and the results were compared to results obtained from urine samples taken at the same time. In all, 164 pairs of oral fluid and urine were obtained from 45 patients stabilized on either methadone or buprenorphine. The total number of detections of drugs other than buprenorphine or methadone was 535 in oral fluid and 629 in urine. Morphine was found more often in urine (n = 66) than in oral fluid (n = 48), whereas the opposite was the case for 6-monoacetylmorphine (n = 20 in urine and n = 48 in oral fluid). Methadone showed the same detection frequency in urine and oral fluid (n = 75), whereas amphetamine (n = 45 in urine and n = 51 in oral fluid), methamphetamine (n = 39 in urine and n = 45 in oral fluid), and N-desmethyldiazepam (n = 37 in urine and n = 51 in oral fluid) were detected slightly more often in oral fluid. The other benzodiazepines, cannabis and cocaine were found more frequently in urine samples. If using a sensitive LC-MS-MS technique, oral fluid might be a good alternative to urine for detection of relatively recent use of drugs.", 
    "109": "As a central integrator of basal ganglia function, the external segment of the globus pallidus (GP) plays a critical role in the control of voluntary movement. The GP is composed of a network of inhibitory GABA-containing projection neurons which receive GABAergic input from axons of the striatum (Str) and local collaterals of GP neurons. Here, using electrophysiological techniques and immunofluorescent labeling we have investigated the differential cellular distribution of \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b13 GABA(A) receptor subunits in relation to striatopallidal (Str-GP) and pallidopallidal (GP-GP) synapses. Electrophysiological investigations showed that zolpidem (100 nm; selective for the \u03b11 subunit) increased the amplitude and the decay time of both Str-GP and GP-GP IPSCs, indicating the presence of the \u03b11 subunits at both synapses. However, the application of drugs selective for the \u03b12, \u03b13 and \u03b15 subunits (zolpidem at 400 nm, L-838,417 and TP003) revealed differential effects on amplitude and decay time of IPSCs, suggesting the nonuniform distribution of non-\u03b11 subunits. Immunofluorescence revealed widespread distribution of the \u03b11 subunit at both soma and dendrites, while double- and triple-immunofluorescent labeling for parvalbumin, enkephalin, gephyrin and the \u03b32 subunit indicated strong immunoreactivity for GABA(A) \u03b13 subunits in perisomatic synapses, a region mainly targeted by local axon collaterals. In contrast, immunoreactivity for synaptic GABA(A) \u03b12 subunits was observed in dendritic compartments where striatal synapses are preferentially located. Due to the kinetic properties which each GABA(A) \u03b1 subunit confers, this distribution is likely to contribute differentially to both physiological and pathological patterns of activity.",

However, both of these routes have potential limitations. This study investigated the pharmacokinetics of diazepam following i.v., intranasal (i.n.) drop and atomized nasal administration in dogs. Six dogs were administered diazepam (0.5\u2003mg/kg) via all three routes following a randomized block design. Plasma samples were collected and concentrations of diazepam and its active metabolites, oxazepam and desmethyldiazepam were quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mean diazepam concentrations >300\u2003ng/mL were reached within 5\u2003min in both i.n. groups. Diazepam was converted into its metabolites within 5 and 10\u2003min, respectively, after i.v. and i.n. administration. The half lives of the metabolites were longer than that of the parent drug after both routes of administration. The bioavailability of diazepam after i.n. drop and atomized nasal administration was 42% and 41%, respectively. These values exceed previously published bioavailability data for rectal administration of diazepam in dogs. This study confirms that i.n. administration of diazepam yields rapid anticonvulsant concentrations of diazepam in the dog before a hepatic first-pass effect.",

(11)C-[R]-PK11195 is a radioligand with a high and specific affinity for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, expressed by activated microglia in cases of neuroinflammation, and therefore it is applicable to the in vivo detection of neuroinflammation with positron emission tomography. (11)C-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography demonstrated increased tracer binding in the occipital, parietal, and posterior temporal white matter, in the genu of the corpus callosum, the bilateral posterior thalami, most of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the bilateral cerebral peduncles, and the brainstem, indicating underlying neuroinflammation. The rest of the brain, including the cerebral cortices and cerebellum, exhibited minimal (11)C-[R]-PK11195 binding. Our findings indicate significant neuroinflammation associated with white matter destruction in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which can be visualized in vivo with an (11)C-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography scan. (11)C-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography may also help evaluate the inflammatory burden and follow-up of the disease evolution.

Anaesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in oxygen and fentanyl infusion following both treatments. All dogs were mechanically ventilated to maintain normocapnia. Systolic blood pressure (SAP) was measured by Doppler ultrasound before and immediately after anaesthetic induction, but before isoflurane administration. Parameters recorded every 5 minutes throughout subsequent anaesthesia were heart and respiratory rates, end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide and isoflurane, oxygen saturation of haemoglobin and invasive systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure. Quality of anaesthetic induction and recovery were recorded. Continuous variables were assessed for normality and analyzed with the Mann Whitney U test. Repeated measures were log transformed and analyzed with repeated measures anova (p<0.05).",

Therefore, we examined the dissolution behavior when the drug was covered with oblate or agar jelly. Three types of commercially available formulations of benzodiazepine were used: medazepam sugarcoated tablets, prazepam uncoated tablets, and clorazepate dipotassium capsules. Dissolution tests were performed using solutions of pH 1.2 and 5.6 to simulate normal gastric juice and gastric anacidity, respectively. Drugs covered with oblate were tested by the paddle method, and those covered with agar jelly were tested using the rotating basket method. Dissolution of clorazepate capsules not covered with oblate increased by approximately 10% when the pH was adjusted from 1.2 to 5.6, while those of medazepam and prazepam tablets decreased by approximately 40-60%. In contrast, the dissolution decreased significantly at both pH values for each drug covered with oblate. Dissolution further decreased when the amount of oblate was doubled. No detectable dissolution of medazepam tablets or of clorazepate capsules occurred when the drug was covered with agar jelly. Dissolution of prazepam tablets covered with agar jelly was only about 10% at the end of the test. These results indicate that dissolution is slowed and prolonged when a drug is covered with oblate or agar jelly, permitting sustained release of the drug. But, it is necessary to improve a suitable method for the dissolution.", 
    "139": "Cryopreserved human hepatocytes suspended in human plasma (HHSHP) represent an integrated metabolic environment for predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs). In this study, 13 CYP3A reversible and/or time-dependent inhibitors (TDIs) were incubated with HHSHP for 20 min over a range of concentrations after which midazolam 1'-hydroxylation was used to measure CYP3A activity. This single incubation time method yielded IC(50) values for the 13 inhibitors. For each CYP3A inhibitor-victim drug pair, the IC(50) value was combined with total average plasma concentration of the inhibitor in humans, fraction of the victim drug cleared by CYP3A, and intestinal availability of the victim drug to predict the ratio of plasma area under the curve of the victim drug in the presence and absence of inhibitor. Of 52 clinical DDI studies using these 13 inhibitors identified in the literature, 85% were predicted by this method within 2-fold of the observed change, and all were predicted within 3-fold. Subsequent studies to determine mechanism (reversible and time-dependent inhibitors) were performed by using a range of incubation periods and inhibitor concentrations. This system differentiated among reversible inhibitors, TDIs, and the combination of both. When the reversible and inactivation parameters were incorporated into predictive models, 65% of 52 clinical DDIs were predicted within 2-fold of the observed changes and 88% were within 3-fold. Thus, HHSHP produced accurate DDI predictions with a simple IC(50) determined at a single incubation time regardless of the inhibition mechanism; further if needed, the mechanism(s) of inhibition can be identified.",

Our objective was to assess the extent of abuse of this drug with a method quantifying doctor-shopping in comparison with other antidepressants and benzodiazepines (BZD). All dispensations of antidepressants and BZD during the year 2005 in a French area of 4.5 million inhabitants were extracted from a reimbursement database. For each patient, two quantities were computed: quantity dispensed and obtained by doctor-shopping. Tianeptine and other drugs were compared using their doctor-shopping indicator (DSI), defined as the percentage of drug obtained by doctor-shopping among dispensed quantity; 410 525 patients received at least one antidepressant dispensation during the year 2005. Tianeptine was the sixth most dispensed antidepressant. The DSI of tianeptine was 2.0%, ranking it first among antidepressant (the second being mianserine with a DSI of 1%). Flunitrazepam has the highest DSI (30.2%), the DSI of the five following BZD (clonazepam, zolpidem, oxazepam, diazepam, bromazepam) range from 3.0% to 2.0%. Tianeptine is associated with higher DSI, compared with other antidepressants, suggesting that it may be subject to abuse in the population.

Diltiazem interaction studies assess a given compound's sensitivity to moderate CYP3A inhibition. The present study compared the effect different durations and formulations of diltiazem (extended release [XR] and conventional release [CR]) had on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of midazolam. The geometric mean ratio (GMR; midazolam + diltiazem(XR \u00d7 5 days)/midazolam + diltiazem(XR \u00d7 2 days)) for midazolam AUC(0-\u221e) was 0.98 (90% confidence interval [CI], 0.87, 1.10). The GMR (midazolam + diltiazem(XR \u00d7 2 days)/midazolam + diltiazem(CR \u00d7 2 days)) for midazolam AUC(0-\u221e) was 0.82 (90% CI, 0.73, 0.92). Simcyp simulations accurately predicted the observed clinical results only when a hepatic CYP3A degradation rate (k(deg)) different from that provided by the software was used. The data suggest that dosing diltiazem XR for 2 days predicts the change in midazolam AUC as reliably as 5 days of XR dosing and 2 days of CR dosing. In addition, the authors believe that a hepatic CYP3A kdeg of 0.03 h(-1) should be considered for future Simcyp studies.",

Studies of syndrome-defined anxiety disorders reveal that risperidone monotherapy did not separate from placebo and that olanzapine was superior to lamotrigine when used to augment lithium treatment. A study using open-label divalproex sodium and an uncontrolled study of group cognitive-behavioral therapy both suggest some benefit from these treatments in patients with bipolar disorder with panic disorder. Studies of nonspecific anxiety reveal some benefit for divalproex, quetiapine, olanzapine, and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination.

The other subcategories of emergency situations were treated after a mean of 25.0 min, and the seizure activity ceased after a mean of 7.4 min in the diazepam group and 7.6 min in the midazolam group (NS). The success rate was 83.3% in the diazepam group and 74.4% in the midazolam group (NS). The difference was mostly due to slightly more seizure relapses during the first 2 h in the midazolam group.

Approximately 2/3 of the depressed in both groups used antidepressants and of those, approximately 50% had responded. Depression in the group without dementia was, among other factors, associated with higher total number of medication, the use of significant more analgesics and benzodiazepines, loneliness, inability of going outside and recent loss of child. The loss of a child was the only factor that was independently associated with depression in those with dementia.",

A large proportion, both with and without dementia, are under-diagnosed and untreated, and in addition many subjects in both groups studied were non-responders to treatment. Many of the factors associated with depression among people without dementia in this study were not associated with depression among those with dementia, thus supporting the theory that the spectrum of associated factors for depression in dementia seems to be different from that for depression in people without dementia.", 
    "178": "Type A \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptors represent a large and diverse family of ligand-gated CI(\u2212) channels that mediate the majority of fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain [1] by causing transient reduction in the probability of action potential firing due to plasma membrane hyperpolarization. Modifications of GABAA receptor function are believed to be critical for development and coordination of neuronal activity underlying all physiological and behavioral processes, and the vast majority of neurons in the brain express these receptors on their plasma membrane. Native, bicuculline-sensitive GABAA receptors are hetero-pentamers of subunits with multiple isoforms classified as: \u03b1 (1\u20136), \u03b2 (1\u20133), \u03b3 (1\u20133), \u03b4, \u025b, \u03c0 and \u03b8 [2\u20134], with a common transmembrane topology comprising a large N-terminal domain, four transmembrane domains (TMs), and a major intracellular domain between TMs 3 and 4 [5] (Figure 4.1b and Figure 4.1c). Some of the most common subunits, such as \u03b23 [6] and \u03b32 [7] are essential for synaptic inhibition and organism survival. In contrast, individual isoforms of the \u03b1 subunit are highly specialized to maintain function of neuronal circuits associated with specific behavioral phenotypes, including sedation, memory, anxiety, arousal and others [8,9]. GABAA receptors are also the main sites of action for a variety of compounds with potent sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, neurosteroids and anaesthetics [10,11].", 
    "179": "Over the years, drug self-administration procedures in animals have been found to be valid and reliable for determining the abuse liability of drugs in humans. It is well established that animals will self-administer most drugs that are abused by humans [16,17]. In particular, studies in nonhuman primates have made a significant contribution to the field of drug abuse research. Nonhuman primates are ideal subjects since they are phylogenetically more closely related to humans than are other species [18]. Potential species differences in drug metabolism also illustrate the importance of nonhuman primate models in substance abuse research. Thus, we can apply information obtained from nonhuman primates to problems of human drug abuse with greater accuracy. This chapter discusses methods of self-administration in non-human primates, including different preparations and schedules of drug reinforcement. While the focus is primarily on self-administration of psychoactive stimulants such as cocaine, the methodology and general principles apply to other pharmacological classes including opiates, benzodiazepines, and alcohol.",

Stable isotope-labeled midazolam-D(4) and 1'-hydroxymidazolam-D(4) were used as internal standards. Compounds were extracted from 0.5 mL plasma by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate-heptane (1:4). Chromatography was achieved using a Sunfire C(18) column. The mobile phase was a gradient with 10 m m formic acid in Milli-Q water and methanol at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. Total run time was 10 min. Detection was performed using a tandem mass spectrometer with positive electrospray ionization. Calibration curves were linear over the range of 0.10-50.0 ng/mL for midazolam and 0.025-25.0 ng/mL for both metabolites. For all compounds the lower limit of quantification was 0.10 ng/mL. Imprecision was assessed according to the NCCLS EP5-T guideline and was below 10% for all compounds. Mean recoveries were between 94 and 109% for midazolam and its metabolites.

    "190": "Tolerance has been recognized for some time where chronic exposure to certain drugs, particularly benzodiazepines and opioids, is associated with apparent tachyphylaxis. When these drugs are stopped or progressively reduced as in 'tapering', withdrawal symptoms may result. Tolerance and the flip side of the coin, withdrawal, are the determinants of addiction. It is increasingly apparent that tolerance can occur acutely, even within the time span of a single anesthetic for a surgical procedure. Addiction is caused by agents, foreign to the body, that provoke adaptation by homeostatic biological processes. When these agents are withdrawn, the adaptive mechanisms, devoid of substrate, take time to diminish and produce symptoms recognizable under the term of 'withdrawal'. Children may be exposed to these agents in different ways; in utero, as a result of substances that the mother ingests by enteral, parenteral or inhalational means that are transmitted to the infant via the placenta; as a result of an anesthetic for surgery; or as a result of sedation and analgesia administered to offset the stresses and trauma inherent from intensive care treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit or pediatric intensive care unit. Additionally, anesthetic and intensive care staff are exposed to powerful and addictive drugs as part of everyday practice, not simply by overt access, but also by subliminal environmental exposure.",

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of subanaesthetic doses of midazolam, ketamine and propofol on the short latency (ES1) and long latency (ES2) reflex in the jaw-closing muscles. First, we tried to evaluate the various methodological criteria for ES recording. We then examined the effect of subanaesthetic doses of midazolam (0\u00b7035 mg kg(-1)), ketamine (0\u00b730 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (0\u00b735 mg kg(-1)) on these reflexes of recording left masseter and temporalis muscle. ES duration did not differ greatly in the present study, recorded with the correct adjustment of stimulating and recording conditions. None of the subanaesthetic doses of the agents influenced ES1, and no significant effects on ES2 were observed with midazolam and ketamine. However, significant inhibitory change was observed in ES2 with propofol. ES2 is thought to be mediated by afferents, which descend in the spinal trigeminal tract and connect with a polysynaptic chain of excitatory interneurones located in the lateral reticular formation. Our observations indicate that propofol is uniquely effective not only through involvement of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor, but also through a range of other effects.",

Before and for 10 min after each MMF injection the following vascular variables [at the left common carotid artery (ACC) after the first injection and at the abdominal aorta (AA) after the second injection]: vessel diameter (D), peak systolic, minimum diastolic, end-diastolic and average blood flow velocities (psBFV, mdBFV, edBFV, Vave), average volumetric flow (VFave), resistance index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) and other clinical variables: mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), peripheral arterial oxygen saturation and end-tidal CO\u2082 were recorded. Echocardiography was used after the third injection to investigate changes in cardiac parameters. Additionally, hemodynamic effects were observed at the ACC after complete subcutaneous antagonism of anesthesia by atipamezole-flumazenil-naloxone (AFN) until recovery of the animals.Medetomidine-midazolam-fentanyl IV caused a significant decrease of blood flow velocity in both investigated vessels which was associated with a significant decrease of HR and cardiac performance indicated by the decrease of FS and average volumetric blood flow. Mean arterial pressure significantly increased after each MMF injection; whereas, it significantly decreased after AFN injection. Therefore, MMF and AFN should be carefully used in rabbits and may not be suitable in patients with ventricular dysfunction.",

An institutional treatment protocol using benzodiazepines (diazepam and midazolam) was assessed in a retrospective case study. The treatment protocol (Ege Pediatric Status Epilepticus Protocol or EPSEP) was developed based on an operational definition of pediatric SE according to the duration of seizure activity. Pediatric SE is divided into three categories: initial SE (20-30 min), established SE (30-60 min) and refractory SE (>60 min). Eight (30%) of the studied episodes were initial SE, 10 (37%) were established SE, and 9 (33%) were refractory SE. With respect to the etiological spectrum of SE, 11 (40%) children had meningitis or encephalitis. Febrile SE was identified in 7 (26%) patients. Only 2 episodes of initial SE (7.5%) were controlled with first step of the protocol (two concomitant-doses of rectal diazepam). Midazolam bolus and infusions (up to 1.2 \u03bcg/kg/min) were used to treat 22 episodes of SE (9 refractory SE, 10 established SE and 3 initial SE). Complete arrest of convulsive SE was achieved in 21 of 22 (95%) episodes with midazolam infusion.

    "209": "Chronic (8 weeks) exposure to both haloperidol and olanzapine resulted in significant decreases in whole-brain volume (6% to 8%) compared with vehicle-treated control subjects, driven mainly by a decrease in frontal cerebral cortex volume (8% to 12%). Hippocampal, corpus striatum, lateral ventricles, and corpus callosum volumes were not significantly different from control subjects, suggesting a differential effect of APD on the cortex. These results were corroborated by ex vivo MRI scans and decreased cortical volume was confirmed postmortem by stereology.",

Although caution needs to be exerted when extrapolating results from animals to patients, the approach provides a tractable method for linking in vivo MRI findings to their histopathological origins.", 
    "211": "Suppression of conditioned avoidance response is a preclinical behavioral index of antipsychotic activity. Previous work shows that olanzapine and risperidone disrupt avoidance response elicited by a less salient conditioned stimulus (CS2) to a greater extent than avoidance elicited by a more salient stimulus (CS1), suggesting that antipsychotic drugs may have a weakening action on motivational salience of stimuli. In the present study, we further examined this mechanism of antipsychotic action, focusing on the possible impact of baseline difference of CS1 and CS2 response rates on the avoidance-disruptive effect of olanzapine and risperidone. Rats were first trained to acquire avoidance responding in a procedure in which the number of CS2 trials (i.e. 20) was twice the number of CS1 trials (i.e. 10), but the percentage of CS2-shock pairing was set at 25% lower (15 trials out of 20) than the percentage of CS1-shock pairing (20 trials out of 20). They were then tested daily under olanzapine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, sc) or risperidone (0.33 and 1.0 mg/kg, sc) for 5 consecutive days. Repeated olanzapine and risperidone treatment dose-dependently disrupted avoidance responding to both CS1 and CS2. Both drugs at the high dose disrupted the CS2 avoidance to a greater extent than the CS1 avoidance. In the final challenge test, rats previously treated with olanzapine were tested under risperidone (0.33 mg/kg), whereas rats previously treated with risperidone were tested under olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg). Results show that rats previously treated with risperidone 1.0mg/kg group made significantly fewer avoidance responses than the vehicles under olanzapine at 0.5 mg/kg. These findings confirm that olanzapine and risperidone disrupt avoidance response primarily by selectively attenuating the motivational salience of the CS. The present study also suggests that there is a generality of antipsychotic drug experience that is mediated by a shared interoceptive drug state mechanism.",

Use of dexmedetomidine as a sedative in the critically ill is associated with fewer opioid requirements compared with propofol and a similar time at goal sedation compared with benzodiazepines. Dexmedetomidine may produce negative hemodynamic effects including lower mean heart rates and potentially more bradycardia than other sedatives used in the critically ill. Recent studies have demonstrated that dexmedetomidine is safe at higher dosages, but more studies are needed to determine whether the efficacy of dexmedetomidine is dose dependent. In addition, further research is required to define dexmedetomidine's role in the care of delirious critically ill patients, as many, but not all, studies have indicated favorable outcomes.", 
    "223": "Khat is a drug widely used in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Khat leaves contain, among other substances, the psychoactive alkaloid cathinone, which induce central nervous system stimulation leading to euphoria, hyperactivity, restlessness, and insomnia. However, it also could cause psychological adverse effects such as lethargy, sleepiness, psychoses, and depression necessitating pharmacologic treatment. Here we report the case of a 35-year-old man from Somalia who became unconscious and developed aspiration pneumonia and subsequent ARDS after excessive consumption of khat leaves. His unconsciousness was possibly caused by the sleepiness developed after khat consumption and a benzodiazepine intake by the patient himself. Thus, khat-induced adverse effects should not primarily be treated pharmacologically, but patients should be urged to quit khat consumption in order to eliminate or, at least, reduce the severity of present psychological adverse effects.",

An 18-question survey was e-mailed to a sample of emergency physicians. Fifty-eight respondents completed the survey. Most (71%) were associated with an emergency medicine residency training program. Annual census ranged from 12,000 to >170,000 visits. TH is used by the majority (69%) of respondents, 79% of which report the presence of a formal institutional protocol. The majority of respondents use TH in arrest rhythms including but not limited to ventricular fibrillation, and 21% begin the process in the prehospital setting. To induce hypothermia, a majority of respondents use commercial cooling products. The average time to target temperature was 95 minutes. The majority of respondents report a goal temperature between 32\u00b0C and 34\u00b0C. A shivering protocol is used by 76% of respondents, and as a first line medication, 46% use benzodiazepines. For those who do not use TH or do not have a protocol in place, the reasons cited include \"too expensive,\" \"too difficult to implement,\" and \"not enough science to warrant it.\" In this sample of practicing emergency physicians, TH after cardiac arrest is not being used as described in the original literature. Although awareness and implementation of TH have increased, there appears to be a wide variation in the application of this therapy.", 
    "225": "The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved naltrexone, a synthetic competitive antagonist at opioid receptors, in oral form in 1984 for use in the management of opioid abuse and addiction. Because naltrexone and its major metabolite, 6-\u03b2-naltrexone, are both competitive antagonists at opioid receptors - and thereby inhibit opioid agonist-induced effects including those desired by abusers - it was hypothesized that once maintained on naltrex-one, opioid-induced desirable effects would be diminished to the point that relapse to illicit use would decline because it was no longer rewarding. However, good medication compliance is a requisite for such a strategy to be effective and a systematic review of oral naltrexone concluded that this method of treatment was not superior for any outcomes measured (ie, retention, abstinence, or side effects) to placebo, psychotherapy, benzodiazepines, or buprenorphine treatment. In addition, the retention rate on oral naltrexone was very low (less than 30%). Recently, the FDA approved an extended-release formulation (intramuscular depot injection) of naltrexone for prevention of relapse to opioid dependence following opioid detoxification and to be used along with counseling and social support. Since it needs to be administered only monthly, as opposed to the daily administration required for the oral formulation, naltrexone injection has the potential for increasing adherence and retention rates. Concerns include liver damage at high doses (oral formulation) and possible opioid overdose if an attempt is made to surmount receptor antagonism by taking higher doses of an opioid agonist or if opioid receptors become \"sensitized\" under long-term antagonism. The focus of the present review is the current information regarding the safety and efficacy of naltrexone extended-release therapy.", 
    "226": "1,5-Benzodiazepine derivatives were synthesized by the condensation reactions of o-phenylenediamine and ketones catalyzed by bismuth (III) salts under mild conditions. This method is easy, efficient, environment and eco-friendly, free of toxic catalysts, and gives good to excellent yields of 1, 5-benzodiazepines.", 
    "227": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) activity on (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT can introduce an undesirable element of complexity when attempting to discern physiologic activity from more ominous entities. Recent studies have demonstrated several methods to reduce BAT FDG uptake. Benzodiazepines, however, have yet to been proven effective against BAT.", 
    "228": "Twenty-five patients with increased BAT FDG uptake were selected retrospectively from our PET/CT database between November 2004 and January 2011. These patients had been asked to return on a different day for repeat scanning with 5mg of intravenous diazepam, administered ten minutes prior to FDG. Two patients underwent this procedure on a second occasion (for a follow-up scan at a later date), thus resulting in a total of twenty-seven scans from twenty five patients. FDG uptake in BAT was recorded using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).", 
    "229": "The mean basal BAT SUVmax was 10.1 \u00b1 4.6 compared to a mean SUVmax of 2.8 \u00b1 3.3 post IV diazepam (p < 0.0001). Approximately 89% (24 of 27) of scans had no significant residual BAT activity. The three remaining scans had a reduction in SUVmax ranging from 23-64% following diazepam administration. No adverse effects were noted.", 
    "230": "We observed a significant reduction in brown fat activity in para-spinal, cervical, mediastinal, para-adrenal, and supra- and infra-clavicular regions on PET/CT following premedication with intravenous diazepam. We feel that IV benzodiazepines should be considered a pharmacologic option for reducing BAT FDG uptake, which in turn, will aid in distinguishing physiologic metabolic activity from pathology.", 
    "231": "In many countries of the industrialised world second generation (\"atypical\") antipsychotics have become the first line drug treatment for people with schizophrenia. The question as to whether, and if so how much, the effects of the various second generation antipsychotics differ is a matter of debate. In this review we examined how the efficacy and tolerability of olanzapine differs from that of other second generation antipsychotics.", 
    "232": "To evaluate the effects of olanzapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics for people with schizophrenia and schizophrenia-like psychosis.", 
    "233": "1. Electronic searching We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group Trials Register (April 2007) which is based on regular searches of BIOSIS, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and PsycINFO. 2. Reference searching We inspected the reference of all identified studies for more trials. 3. Personal contact We contacted the first author of each included study for missing information. 4. Drug companies We contacted the manufacturers of all atypical antipsychotics included for additional data.", 
    "234": "We included all randomised trials that used at least single-blind (rater-blind) design, comparing oral olanzapine with oral forms of amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone or zotepine in people with schizophrenia or schizophrenia-like psychosis.", 
    "235": "We extracted data independently. For dichotomous data we calculated relative risks (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) on an intention-to-treat basis based on a random effects model. We calculated numbers needed to treat/harm (NNT/NNH) where appropriate. For continuous data, we calculated weighted mean differences (WMD) again based on a random effects model.", 
    "236": "The review currently includes 50 studies and 9476 participants which provided data for six comparisons (olanzapine compared to amisulpride, aripiprazole, clozapine, quetiapine, risperidone or ziprasidone). The overall attrition from the included studies was considerable (49.2%) leaving the interpretation of results problematic. Olanzapine improved the general mental state (PANSS total score) more than aripiprazole (2 RCTs, n\u2009=\u2009794, WMD -4.96 CI -8.06 to -1.85), quetiapine (10 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091449, WMD -3.66 CI -5.39 to -1.93), risperidone (15 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20092390, WMD -1.94 CI -3.31 to -0.58) and ziprasidone (4 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091291, WMD -8.32 CI -10.99 to -5.64), but not more than amisulpride or clozapine. This somewhat better efficacy was confirmed by fewer participants in the olanzapine groups leaving the studies early due to inefficacy of treatment compared to quetiapine (8 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091563, RR 0.56 CI 0.44 to 0.70, NNT 11 CI 6 to 50), risperidone (14 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20092744, RR 0.78 CI 0.62 to 0.98, NNT 50 CI 17 to 100) and ziprasidone (5 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091937, RR 0.64 CI 0.51 to 0.79, NNT 17, CI 11 to 33).Fewer participants in the olanzapine group than in the quetiapine (2 RCTs, n\u2009=\u2009876, RR 0.56 CI 0.41 to 0.77, NNT 11 CI 7 to 25) and ziprasidone (2 RCTs, n\u2009=\u2009766, RR 0.65 CI 0.45 to 0.93, NNT 17 CI 9 to 100) treatment groups, but not in the clozapine group (1 RCT, n\u2009=\u2009980, RR 1.28 CI 1.02 to 1.61, NNH not estimable), had to be re-hospitalised in the trials.Except for clozapine, all comparators induced less weight gain than olanzapine (olanzapine compared to amisulpride: 3 RCTs, n\u2009=\u2009671, WMD 2.11 kg CI 1.29 kg to 2.94 kg; aripiprazole: 1 RCT, n\u2009=\u200990, WMD 5.60 kg CI 2.15 kg to 9.05 kg; quetiapine: 7 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091173, WMD 2.68 kg CI 1.10 kg to 4.26 kg; risperidone: 13 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20092116, WMD 2.61 kg CI 1.48 kg to 3.74 kg; ziprasidone: 5 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091659, WMD 3.82 kg CI 2.96 kg to 4.69 kg). Associated problems such as glucose and cholesterol increase were usually also more frequent in the olanzapine group. Other differences in adverse effects were less well documented. Nevertheless, olanzapine may be associated with slightly more extrapyramidal side effects than quetiapine (use of antiparkinson medication (6 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091090, RR 2.05 CI 1.26 to 3.32, NNH 25 CI 14 to 100), but less than risperidone (use of antiparkinson medication 13 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20092599, RR 0.78 CI 0.65 to 0.95, NNH 17 CI 9 to 100) and ziprasidone (use of antiparkinson medication 4 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091732, RR 0.70 CI 0.50 to 0.97, NNH not estimable). It may also increase prolactin somewhat more than aripiprazole, clozapine and quetiapine, but clearly less so than risperidone (6 RCTs, n\u2009=\u20091291, WMD -22.84 CI -27.98 to -17.69).", 
    "237": "Olanzapine may be a somewhat more efficacious drug than some other second generation antipsychotic drugs. This small superiority in efficacy needs to be weighed against a larger weight gain and associated metabolic problems than most other second generation antipsychotic drugs, except clozapine. These conclusions are tentative due to the large number of people leaving the studies early which possibly limits the validity of the findings. Further large, well-designed trials are necessary to establish the relative effects of different second generation antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "238": "Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) is a powerful treatment option in severe or chronic catatonic states and has been reported to be useful in oligophrenic patients. We report the followup medical history of a patient with corpus callosum aplasia (or agenesis) who was continuously treated with ECT over three years. First, he improved considerably after a series of ECT, but relapses of catatonia made a continuous, weekly ECT necessary. Due to the severity of the brain malformation, an add-on medication with benzodiazepines and second generation antipsychotics was necessary to treat catatonic symptoms. This case emphasises the benefits of long-term ECT in oligophrenic patients."
