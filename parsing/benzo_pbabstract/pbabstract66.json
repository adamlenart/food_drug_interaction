    "1": "An open, fixed-sequence study was carried out in 12 healthy subjects. Single ascending doses of ritonavir (0.1-300 mg) were evaluated for CYP3A inhibition in two cohorts using midazolam as a marker substance.", 
    "2": "Ritonavir administered as a single oral dose produced a dose-dependent CYP3A inhibition with an ID50 of 3.4 mg. Using the measured ritonavir concentrations an exposure-inhibition effect curve was established with an IC50 of 600 h pmol/L (AUC2-4). Over the ritonavir dose range studied non-linear exposure of ritonavir was observed.", 
    "3": "Ritonavir shows a dose and concentration effect relationship of CYP3A inhibition. In addition, a proposed auto-inhibition of ritonavir metabolism resulted in a non-linear exposure of ritonavir with sub-proportional concentrations at low doses. A time-dependent CYP3A activity may result when inhibitors of CYP3A with short elimination half-lives are used.",

    "5": "In this open-label, monocenter, one-sequence crossover clinical trial ten male healthy participants were stratified according to CYP2C19 and SLCO1B1 (encoding for OATP1B1) genotype into two groups: group 1 (n\u2009=\u20096), with CYP2C19 1/1 (extensive metabolizer, EM) and SLCO1B1 wild-type; group 2 (n\u2009=\u20094), with CYP2C19 EM and homozygous (n\u2009=\u20093) or heterozygous for SLCO1B1 15 (n\u2009=\u20091). The participants were administered a once-daily oral dose of 5 mg ambrisentan on study days 1 and days 3-14 and twice-daily oral doses of 500 mg clarithromycin on study days 11-14. To monitor CYP3A activity 3 mg midazolam was given orally 1 day before the first ambrisentan administration and on days 1, 10, and 14 of ambrisentan treatment. Ambrisentan plasma kinetics was assessed on days 1 (single dose), 10 (steady-state), and 14 (CYP3A4/OATP1B1 inhibition by clarithromycin).", 
    "6": "Consistent with the expectation that ambrisentan does not induce its own metabolism, ambrisentan exposure and peak concentration (Cmax) were similar after the first dose and at steady-state. Clarithromycin increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of ambrisentan by 41 % and Cmax by 27 % (n\u2009=\u200910, both p\u2009<\u20090.05).

Efficacy of olanzapine was assessed by comparing the proportion of responders (an at least 50% drop in Young Mania Rating Scale [YMRS] score from baseline) and remitters (YMRS \u2264 12 and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D] \u2264 8) in both groups. Craving and days of abuse/use were assessed with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Time-line Follow-Back (TLFB), respectively.", 
    "10": "Differences in response and remission percentages were statistically not significant at discharge and during follow-up. A reduction of days of abuse has been observed in the drug-abuse group, while craving was only slightly decreased.",

    "12": "Patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) often require sedatives which commonly include midazolam and the more recently developed \u03b12-receptor agonist, dexmedetomidine. It was our aim to compare the sedative and clinical effectiveness of dexmedetomidine vs midazolam in adults admitted to ICU, using an objective appraisal of randomized control trials. Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, Web of Knowledge, Cinhal, the United States National Library of Medicine, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched using keywords: 'dexmedetomidine', 'midazolam', and 'intensive care'. These were limited to human studies and adults (>18 yr old). Six randomized controlled trials were found and were critically appraised using a standardized appraisal method. Two papers described the time spent by each intervention group within a specified target sedation range and both found no statistically significant difference between midazolam and dexmedetomidine (P=0.18 and P=0.15). A third paper found no statistically significant difference in the length of time that patients were sedated within a target zone (P=0.445). Two additional pilot studies did not report P values as they were insufficiently statistically powered. A final paper found that, of the eight occasions measured, patients on dexmedetomidine were more often within the target sedation range than patients on midazolam. The sedative benefits of dexmedetomidine vs midazolam remain inconclusive. While some secondary outcomes showed clinical effectiveness of dexmedetomidine, more research is needed to validate the findings of these studies.", 
    "13": "Data on psychopharmacological treatment of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are scarce, especially for European countries. This study evaluated psychopharmacotherapy utilisation in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of ASD in Germany. Data of a large statutory health insurance company were analysed and outpatients aged 0-24 years with a diagnosis of ASD during a 1-year-period (2009) were identified. For this cohort, the prescription of psychopharmacotherapy was evaluated. Aditionally, we analysed time trends in prescriptions from 2004 to 2009. One thousand one hundred twenty-four patients (75.4% male; mean age: 11.1 years) matched the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of ASD was 0.37% in males and 0.12% in females, respectively. Of all ASD patients, 33.0% were prescribed psychotropic drugs in 2009. 12.5% of ASD patients were treated with stimulants or atomoxetine, 11.7% with antipsychotics, 9.1% with antiepileptics, 6.8% with benzodiazepines, and 3.8% with antidepressants/SSRI. Regarding substances, methylphenidate (24.4% of all psychotropic prescriptions), risperidone (13.3%) and valproate (9.1%) were most frequently prescribed. Psychopharmacologic treatment prevalence was age-related and increased from 16.3% in individuals aged 0-4 years to 55.1% in 20-24 year olds. From 2004 to 2009, the proportion of ASD patients treated with psychotropic drugs rose from 25.9% to 33.0%. This naturalistic study furnishes evidence that the proportion of ASD patients treated with psychotropic drugs has grown considerably in Germany over the least years, with methylphenidate and risperidone being the most frequently prescribed substances. Compared with data from the USA, the proportion of ASD patients with psychopharmacological treatment is noticeably lower in Germany.", 
    "14": "Dental anxiety and specific phobia of dental procedures are prevalent conditions that can result in substantial distress and oral health impairment. This paper critically reviews 22 randomized treatment trials aimed at reducing dental anxiety and avoidance in adults, published in peer-reviewed journals between 1974 and 2012. The following treatment techniques are reviewed: various forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation training, benzodiazepine premedication, music distraction, hypnotherapy, acupuncture, nitrous oxide sedation, and the use of lavender oil scent. CBT delivered in a variety of formats, including one-session treatment, has the most evidence for its efficacy. Cognitive techniques, relaxation, and techniques to increase patients' sense of control over dental care are also efficacious but perform best when combined with repeated, graduated exposure. Other interventions require further study in randomized trials before conclusions about their efficacy are warranted. Limitations of the extant outcome research and implications for future treatment and research are discussed.",

The number of babies needing abstinence treatment (45% vs. 51% (O), P = 0.411) and length of hospital stay (median days 9 vs. 11(O), P = 0.067) were similar, but buprenorphine infants required lower maximum morphine doses (mg/kg/day) (median 0.4 mg vs. 0.5 mg (O), P = 0.009).", 
    "18": "Short-term medical outcomes of infants of buprenorphine-using mothers are similar to those of non-buprenorphine opiate-using mothers, but interpretation of these results is confounded by the high rates of polydrug exposure in the buprenorphine group. This and other social concerns noted in buprenorphine mothers and infants warrant further study.", 
    "19": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is the most dangerous life-threatening complication of antipsychotic medication. It's development is connected with the blockade of dopaminergic transmission (D2 receptors) in the nigrostriatal system of the brain. Fever is one of the main symptoms of this syndrome and it's elevation is due to the activation of the immune system. Numerous studies report that treatment with clozapine (doses 37.5-600 mg) or olanzapine (doses 10-25 mg) or the use of these drugs in polytherapy cause pyrexia between 37.8-40.6 \u00b0C. Additionally, levels of proinflammatory interleukins such as IL-6, IL-1,TNF-\u03b1 were increased. The aim of this article is to describe how olanzapine and clozapine influence fever development in NMS, in relation to the dose of the drug taken by schizophrenic patients including changes in immunological system.", 
    "20": "Patients with generalized epilepsy exhibit cerebral cortical disinhibition. Likewise, mutations in the inhibitory ligand-gated ion channels, GABAA receptors (GABAARs), cause generalized epilepsy syndromes in humans. Recently, we demonstrated that heterozygous knock-out (Het\u03b11KO) of the human epilepsy gene, the GABAAR \u03b11 subunit, produced absence epilepsy in mice. Here, we determined the effects of Het\u03b11KO on the expression and physiology of GABAARs in the mouse cortex. We found that Het\u03b11KO caused modest reductions in the total and surface expression of the \u03b22 subunit but did not alter \u03b21 or \u03b23 subunit expression, results consistent with a small reduction of GABAARs. Cortices partially compensated for Het\u03b11KO by increasing the fraction of residual \u03b11 subunit on the cell surface and by increasing total and surface expression of \u03b13, but not \u03b12, subunits. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that Het\u03b11KO increased the fraction of \u03b11 subunits, and decreased the fraction of \u03b13 subunits, that associated in hybrid \u03b11\u03b13\u03b2\u03b3 receptors. Patch clamp electrophysiology studies showed that Het\u03b11KO layer VI cortical neurons exhibited reduced inhibitory postsynaptic current peak amplitudes, prolonged current rise and decay times, and altered responses to benzodiazepine agonists. Finally, application of inhibitors of dynamin-mediated endocytosis revealed that Het\u03b11KO reduced base-line GABAAR endocytosis, an effect that probably contributes to the observed changes in GABAAR expression. These findings demonstrate that Het\u03b11KO exerts two principle disinhibitory effects on cortical GABAAR-mediated inhibitory neurotransmission: 1) a modest reduction of GABAAR number and 2) a partial compensation with GABAAR isoforms that possess physiological properties different from those of the otherwise predominant \u03b11\u03b2\u03b3 GABAARs.",

There was no correlation between OLZ concentrations and tested metabolic parameters. DMO concentrations were negatively correlated with glucose (r s\u200a=\u200a-0.45) and DMO concentrations normalized by doses were also negatively correlated with insulin levels (r s\u200a=\u200a-0.39); however, there was a marginally positive correlation between DMO and homocysteine levels (r s\u200a=\u200a+0.38).",

'Soft methods' were used significantly more often than 'hard methods'. Of the suicide attempt methods employed, a relatively high proportion was accounted for by self-poisoning with drugs (X60-64), especially with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. Significant gender differences were found in the various methods and in the frequency of psychiatric diagnoses. A total of 98.7% of the attempters were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder according to ICD-10; 35% suffered from an affective disorder. Men were significantly more frequently affected by substance abuse disorder or psychosis, whereas in women adjustment disorders and personality disorders were diagnosed significantly more often.",

Patients in the former two groups were given a loading dose of propofol or midazolam and followed by continuous infusion of the same drugs. Those in the combination group were given a loading dose of propofol and followed by continuous infusion of propofol together with midazolam. In this study, Ramsay anesthesia score was used to evaluate the effectiveness of sedation. The patients in three groups were maintained at depth of sedation level 2-4 according to the Ramsay score, and reassessed every 1-2 hours after the initiation.

Soft esophageal bolus impaction is an emergency that requires skilled endoscopic removal if persistent obstructive symptoms do not resolve spontaneously after careful observation. Expedited care of these patients is crucial to avoid respiratory and mechanical complications. Other possible options for management include medical agents used to manage it prior to performing endoscopy if access to endoscopy was not available or declined by the patient. Aim. To review the available pharmacological and other nonmedicinal options and their mechanism of relief for soft esophageal impaction. Method. Pubmed, Medline and Ovid were used for search of MESH terms pertinent including \"foreign body, esophageal, esophageal bolus and medical\" for pharmacological and non medicinial agents used for management of esophageal soft bolus impaction as well as manual review of the cross-references. Results. Several agents were identified including Buscopan, Glucagon, nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and papaveretum. Non medicinal agents are water, effervescent agents, and papain. No evidence was found to suggest preference or effectiveness of use of a certain pharmacological agent compared to others. Buscopan, Glucagon, benzodiazepines, and nitrates were studied extensively and may be used in selected patients with caution. Use of papain is obsolete in management of soft bolus impaction.", 
    "50": "Eight fatty acids (C12-C18) were previously identified in human amniotic fluid, colostrum, and milk in similar proportions but different amounts. Amniotic fluid is well known to be the natural environment for development in mammals. Interestingly, amniotic fluid and an artificial mixture of fatty acids contained in amniotic fluid produce similar anxiolytic-like actions in Wistar rats. We explored whether the lowest amount of fatty acids contained in amniotic fluid with respect to colostrum and milk produces such anxiolytic-like effects. Although a trend toward a dose-response effect was observed, only an amount of fatty acids that was similar to amniotic fluid fully mimicked the effect of diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) in the defensive burying test, an action devoid of effects on locomotor activity and motor coordination. Our results confirm that the amount of fatty acids contained in amniotic fluid is sufficient to produce anxiolytic-like effects, suggesting similar actions during intrauterine development.",

Retarded and excited types exist, both of which often go unrecognised in clinical practice. We describe a 64-year-old woman who gradually developed insomnia, started communicating less, complained of feeling restless and ended up injuring relatives. Initiation of symptoms followed a fibula fracture. The patient was diagnosed with excited-type catatonia with prominent combativeness because of minor trauma and rapidly recovered after lorazepam treatment instatement. Our case demonstrates that catatonia can follow minor traumatic injury and how excited-type catatonic features may go unrecognised in general practitioner and specialist settings. Moreover, we show that catatonia may be recurrent, necessitating long-term treatment and very gradual lorazepam tapering.",

The relative change increased significantly after 2001 for both sexes and for the majority of age groups. Within birth cohorts, the prevalence increased with age until the year 2001 and leveled thereafter. The age-period approach overall had worse model fit indicators than the within-cohort approach and predicted larger long-term effects than the within-cohort approach. The age-period projection estimated 36% decline in benzodiazepine use relative to 2008, whereas the birth-cohort projection estimated 8% decline.",

The harmonic vibrational frequencies were calculated and the scaled values have been compared with experimental FT-IR and FT-Raman spectra. A detailed interpretation of the vibrational spectra of this compound has been made on the basis of the calculated potential energy distribution (PED). The linear polarizability (\u03b1) and the first order hyperpolarizability (\u03b2) values of the investigated molecule have been computed using DFT quantum mechanical calculations. The observed and the calculated frequencies are found to be in good agreement. The experimental spectra also coincide satisfactorily with those of theoretically calculated values.",

Screening using human liver microsomes and hepatocytes can help predict DDIs but do not always provide the degree of certainty required for confident progression of a candidate drug. Thus a suitable in vivo test system could be of great value. Here a Cyp2c knockout (KO) mouse was investigated for studying DDIs using midazolam (MDZ) a standard human CYP3A4 substrate and troleandomycin (TAO) a potent human CYP3A4 inhibitor. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and biotransformation of MDZ were investigated following dosing to Cyp2c KO and wild type mice before and after TAO treatment. The noteworthy differences in the metabolism of MDZ in Cyp2c KO compared to wild type mice confirms the important role that Cyp2c enzymes play in the murine metabolism of MDZ in vivo. The impact of Cyp3a inhibition produced a further increase in circulating MDZ concentrations in all individuals from both strains of mice though the impact of the elimination of the Cyp2c pathway in the KO mice on the AUC was less than perhaps expected. We have shown that TAO produces an increase in the MDZ concentration and a reduction in the 1'hydroxymidazolam/midazolam formation ratio but the expected difference in the magnitude of this effect between the wild type and the Cyp2c KO mice was not seen. The magnitude of the TAO effect was also smaller than is reported in humans. Hence further work is required before this animal model could be used to predict clinical interactions.",

Currently approved treatments for insomnia primarily target \u03b3-aminobutyric acid-A (GABA-A) receptor signalling and include benzodiazepines and GABA-A receptor modulators. These drugs are used to address this sleep disorder, but have the potential for side effects such as tolerance and dependence, making them less attractive as maintenance therapy. Forward and reverse genetic approaches in animals have implicated orexin signalling (also referred to as hypocretin signalling) in the control of vigilance and sleep/wake states. Screening for orexin receptor antagonists using in vitro and in vivo methods in animals has identified compounds that block one or other of the orexin receptors (single or dual orexin receptor antagonists [SORAs and DORAs], respectively) in animals and humans. SORAs have primarily been used as probes to further elucidate the roles of the individual orexin receptors, while a number of DORAs have progressed to clinical development as pharmaceutical candidates for insomnia. The DORA almorexant demonstrated significant improvements in a number of clinically relevant sleep parameters in animal models and in patients with insomnia but its development was halted. SB-649868 and suvorexant have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in Phase II and III trials respectively.

We hypothesized that by modeling anxiety in a male C57BL/6 mouse model it would be possible to reveal a preference for benzodiazepines within this subpopulation through negative reinforcement. Using the Tube Test of Social Dominance and the Resident/Intruder Paradigm we investigated whether animals identified as dominant or submissive/defeated would differentially display a preference for midazolam (a short acting benzodiazepine) in a conditioned place preference paradigm. Consistent with our hypotheses, benzodiazepine conditioned motivation was mediated by negative reinforcement as submissive but not dominant mice displayed a preference for midazolam. Furthermore, different neural systems mediated midazolam conditioned motivation depending on the stress status of the animal (single vs. repeated stress-as induced by the Resident/Intruder Paradigm). Singly stressed animals showed midazolam place preferences through a dopamine-independent pathway, whereas the place preferences of repeatedly stressed animals were mediated through a dopamine-dependent pathway. This demonstrates that stress is sufficient for switching the neural system mediating midazolam conditioned motivation. Finally, midazolam reinforcement in the conditioned place preference paradigm was shown to be predictive for dominance/submission status.",

The TCM candidates exhibited higher affinity than GABA and Zolpidem, a phenomenon that could be attributed to higher quantity of stabilizing H-bonds. Efficacy profiles using support vector machines and pharmacophore contour also suggest drug potential of the TCM candidates. Fragments added to the de novo derivatives 3a, 3b, 3c for GABA binding site, and 1a, 2a, and 3d for BZ binding site contributed to new binding sites and structural stability, further optimizing binding to GABA or BZ binding sites. Increased opening of the ion channel by candidate ligands provide strong support for their potential biological functions. The dual binding properties of the TCM candidates present a unique opportunity to develop twin-targeting drugs with less side effects.

Medications used to treat agitation include antipsychotics and benzodiazepines, usually administered intramuscularly when rapid action is desired. Loxapine, a first-generation antipsychotic, has recently been reformulated into an inhaled powder that allows for direct administration to the lungs, resulting in rapid absorption into the systemic circulation. Administered via a single-use device, inhaled loxapine was tested in randomized controlled trials in agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania; doses of 5 mg and 10 mg were found to be efficacious, with an apparent dose response. In the Phase III studies, number needed to treat versus placebo for a \u226540% reduction from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale - Excited Component (PANSS-EC) at 2 hours was three for patients with bipolar disorder, and five for 5 mg and four for 10 mg for patients with schizophrenia, with effect sizes comparable to what has been observed in analogous studies of intramuscular injection of antipsychotics or lorazepam. Separation from placebo on the PANSS-EC was as early as 10 minutes postinhalation, the first time point where this was measured. Dysgeusia was the most commonly encountered spontaneously reported adverse event. Adverse events related to extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia were relatively rare. Spirometry studies identified the potential for bronchospasm particularly in persons with asthma. Because of concerns over pulmonary safety, inhaled loxapine is restricted to use in hospitals and patients need to be prescreened for the presence of pulmonary disease, as well as monitored for signs and symptoms of bronchospasm for 1 hour postdose administration, as per a Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy.", 
    "110": "The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of CYP3A5 expression on inhibitory potency (Ki or IC50 values) of CYP3A inhibitors, using recombinant CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 (rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5) and CYP3A5 genotyped human liver microsomes (HLMs). IC50 ratios between rCYP3A4 and rCYP3A5 (rCYP3A5/rCYP3A4) of ketoconazole (KTZ) and itraconazole (ITZ) were 8.5 and 8.8 for midazolam (MDZ), 4.7 and 9.1 for testosterone (TST), 1.3 and 2.8 for terfenadine, and 0.6 and 1.7 for vincristine, respectively, suggesting substrate- and inhibitor-dependent selectivity of the two azoles. Due to the difference in the IC50 values for CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, nonconcordant expression of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 protein can significantly affect the observed magnitude of CYP3A-mediated drug-drug interactions in humans. Indeed, the IC50 values of KTZ and ITZ for CYP3A-catalyzed MDZ and TST metabolism were significantly higher in HLMs with CYP3A5*1/*1 and CYP3A5*1/*3 genotypes than in HLMs with the CYP3A5*3/*3 genotype, showing CYP3A5 expression-dependent IC50 values. Moreover, when IC50 values of KTZ and ITZ for different HLMs were kinetically simulated based on CYP3A5 expression level and enzyme-specific IC50 values, a good correlation between the simulated and the experimentally measured IC50 values was observed. Further simulation analysis revealed that both the Ki ratio (for inhibitors) and Vmax/Km ratio (for substrates) between CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were major factors for CYP3A5 expression-dependent IC50 values. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that CYP3A5 genotype and expression level have a significant impact on inhibitory potency for CYP3A-catalyzed drug metabolism, but that the magnitude of its effect is inhibitor-substrate pair specific.", 
    "111": "A novel, rapid and sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) method combined with flow-injection (FI) has been established for the estimation of olanzapine. This method is based on the CL signal generated between N-chlorosuccinimide and olanzapine in an alkaline medium in the presence of calcein and Zn(II). Under optimum conditions, the CL signal was proportional to the olanzapine concentration ranging from 1.0 \u00d7 10(-10) to 3.0 \u00d7 10(-7) g/mL. The detection limit is 8.9 \u00d7 10(-11) g/mL olanzapine (3\u03c3) and the relative standard deviation for 3.0 \u00d7 10(-9) g/mL of olanzapine is 1.9% (n = 11). The current CL method was applied to determine olanzapine in pharmaceutical formulations and biological fluids with satisfactory results. The possible CL reaction mechanism is discussed briefly.", 
    "112": "Non-selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) are known to impair anterograde memory. The role of the various GABAAR subtypes in the memory-impairing effects of non-selective GABAAR PAMs has not been fully elucidated. The current study assessed, in rhesus monkeys, effects of modulation of \u03b11, \u03b12/3, and \u03b15GABAARs on visual recognition and spatial working memory using delayed matching-to-sample (DMTS) and self-ordered spatial search (SOSS) procedures, respectively. The DMTS procedure (n=8) involved selecting a previously presented 'sample' image from a set of multiple images presented after a delay. The SOSS procedure (n=6) involved touching a number of boxes without repeats. The non-selective GABAAR PAM triazolam and the \u03b11GABAA preferential PAMS zolpidem and zaleplon reduced accuracy in both procedures, whereas the \u03b15GABAA preferential PAMs SH-053-2'F-R-CH3 and SH-053-2'F-S-CH3, and the \u03b12/3GABAA preferential PAM TPA023B were without effects on accuracy or trial completion. The low-efficacy \u03b15GABAAR negative allosteric modulator (NAM) PWZ-029 slightly increased only DMTS accuracy, whereas the high-efficacy \u03b15GABAAR NAMs RY-23 and RY-24 did not affect accuracy under either procedure. Finally, the slopes of the accuracy dose-effect curves for triazolam, zolpidem, and zaleplon increased with box number in the SOSS procedure, but were equivalent across DMTS delays. The present results suggest that (1) \u03b11GABAARs, compared with \u03b12/3 and \u03b15GABAARs, are primarily involved in the impairment, by non-selective GABAAR PAMs, of visual recognition and visuospatial working memory in nonhuman primates; and (2) relative cognitive impairment produced by positive modulation of GABAARs increases with number of locations to be remembered, but not with the delay for remembering.", 
    "113": "The light/dark (LD) test is a commonly used rodent test of unconditioned anxiety-like behavior that is based on an approach/avoidance conflict between the drive to explore novel areas and an aversion to brightly lit, open spaces. We used the LD test to investigate developmental differences in behavior between adolescent (postnatal day (PN) 28-34) and adult (PN67-74) male rats. We investigated whether LD behavioral measures reflect anxiety-like behavior similarly in each age group using factor analysis and multiple regression. These analyses showed that time in the light compartment, percent distance in the light, rearing, and latency to emerge into the light compartment were measures of anxiety-like behavior in each age group, while total distance traveled and distance in the dark compartment provided indices of locomotor activity. We then used these measures to assess developmental differences in baseline LD behavior and the response to anxiogenic drugs. Adolescent rats emerged into the light compartment more quickly than adults and made fewer pokes into the light compartment. These age differences could reflect greater risk taking and less risk assessment in adolescent rats than adults. Adolescent rats were less sensitive than adults to the anxiogenic effects of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist N-methyl-\u03b2-carboline-3-carboxamide (FG-7142) and the \u03b1\u2082 adrenergic antagonist yohimbine on anxiety-like behaviors validated by factor analysis, but locomotor variables were similarly affected. These data support the results of the factor analysis and indicate that GABAergic and noradrenergic modulation of LD anxiety-like behavior may be immature during adolescence.", 
    "114": "Vortioxetine (Lu AA21004) is an investigational novel antidepressant with multimodal activity that functions as a 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT(1D) receptor antagonist, 5-HT(1B) receptor partial agonist, 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and inhibitor of the 5-HT transporter in vitro. Here we explore its anxiolytic and antidepressant potential in adult mice. Vortioxetine was assessed in BalB/cJ@RJ mice using the open-field and forced-swim tests (acute: p.o. 1 h, repeated: daily p.o. 21 days), and in 129S6/SvEvTac mice using the novelty suppressed feeding paradigm (acute: p.o. 1 h, sustained: daily p.o. 14 or 21 days). Fluoxetine and diazepam were controls. Acute and repeated dosing of vortioxetine produced more pronounced anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activities than fluoxetine. Vortioxetine significantly increased cell proliferation and cell survival and stimulated maturation of immature granule cells in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus after 21 days of treatment. After 14 days, a high dose of vortioxetine increased dendritic length and the number of dendrite intersections, suggesting that vortioxetine accelerates the maturation of immature neurons. Vortioxetine displays an antidepressant and anxiolytic profile following repeated administration associated with increased neurogenesis at several stages. Vortioxetine effects were observed at low levels of 5-HT transporter occupancy, suggesting an alternative mechanism of action to 5-HT reuptake inhibition.", 
    "115": "There continues to be consistent pressure for bioanalytical scientists to achieve lower limits of quantitation. The reasons range from smaller sample volumes available for analysis, to more potent analytes and the growth of biologics in drug development. This has led scientists to investigate alternative LC techniques, including microflow and nanoflow. These techniques have been shown to increase sensitivity of electrospray methods and reduce ionization matrix effects. Because high-resolution MS has significant benefits for the analysis of biologics, this type of mass spectrometer is becoming increasingly important in bioanalysis.",

This cohort study investigates the effect of BDZ doses in SE patients in terms of morbidity and mortality. It considers incident SE episodes from a prospective registry (2009-2012), comparing patients receiving standard BDZ dose to those receiving exceeding doses (>30% above recommended dose), in terms of likelihood to receive intubation, morbidity, and mortality. Duration of hospitalization was assessed for subjects needing intubation for airways protection (not for refractory SE treatment) versus matched subjects not admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). We identified 29 subjects receiving \"excessive\" and 173 \"standard\" BDZ dose; 45% of the overtreated patients were intubated for airways protection, but only 8% in the standard-dose group (p < 0.001). However, both groups presented similar clinical outcomes: 50% returned to baseline, 40% acquired a new handicap, and 10% died. Orotracheal intubation due to airways protection was associated with significantly longer hospitalization (mean 2 weeks vs. 1 week, p = 0.008). In conclusion, although administration of excessive BDZ doses in SE treatment does not seem to influence outcome, it is related to higher respiratory depression risk and longer hospitalization, potentially exposing patients to additional complications and costs.",

The results of new studies have directed significant changes in critical care practice. Using the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the guidelines were revised, resulting in 32 recommendations and 22 summary statements. This article provides guidance toward guideline implementation strategies and outlines 10 key points to consider. Compared with its predecessor, the 2013 PAD guidelines are less prescriptive in that they recommend approaches to patient care rather than giving specific medication recommendations. This will help focus care teams on the process and structure of patient management and result in more flexibility when choosing specific medications. This article outlines approaches to guideline implementation that take into account the changes in philosophy surrounding medication selection. The manuscript focuses on the areas anticipated to generate the most change such as lighter sedation targets, avoidance of benzodiazepines, and early mobility. A gap analysis grid is provided. The release of any guideline should prompt reevaluation of current institutional practice standards.

    "134": "An extensive literature has implicated the endocannabinoid system in the modulation anxiety-related responses. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain what would be the effects of endocannabinoid-related compounds against responses related to specific subtypes of anxiety disorders, particularly generalized anxiety and panic. In this context, the elevated T maze (ETM) has been developed to evaluate two distinct tasks in the same rat, inhibitory avoidance and escape response from an open arm, predictive of anxiolytic and panicolytic effects, respectively. Thus, the present study tested the hypothesis that drugs that facilitate endocannabinoid-signaling would inhibit both types of aversive responses in this model. As positive controls, diazepam attenuated only inhibitory avoidance (anxiolytic-like effect), whereas alprazolam was effective against both avoidance and escape (anxiolytic- and panicolytic like effects). The synthetic cannabinoid WIN55,212-2 (1.0 mg/kg) promoted an anxiolytic-like effect, which was prevented by pre-treatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist, AM 251 (1.0 mg/kg). At the higher dose (3.0 mg/kg), this antagonist promoted an anxiogenic-like effect. None of these drugs interfered with the escape task. The endocannabinoid (anandamide) hydrolysis inhibitor, URB 597 at doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, induced, respectively, panicolytic- and anxiolytic-like effects, which were reversed by pretreatment with AM 251. These results suggest that drugs that act on the endocannabinoid system have different effects on the behaviors assessed in the ETM.", 
    "135": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is seen as the clinical manifestation of a low grade cerebral edema with formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RNOS). Astrocyte swelling is a crucial event and in cultured astrocytes HE-relevant factors almost instantaneously induce the formation of RNOS. However, short term effects of ammonia, inflammatory cytokines and RNOS on the volume of astrocytes and other brain cells as well as the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown, although a pathogenic link between RNOS formation and swelling in HE has been proposed. This issue was addressed in the present study by means of live-cell volume microscopy of brain cells in vitro. Ammonia, diazepam and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor-necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interferon-\u03b3, interleukin-1\u03b2 induced within 20min astrocyte swelling by about 25% accompanied by nuclear swelling of similar magnitude. Astrocyte swelling in response to NH4Cl, TNF-\u03b1 or diazepam was abolished by the antioxidant epigallocatechin-gallate pointing to an involvement of RNOS. NH4Cl-induced astrocyte swelling was sensitive to inhibition of glutamine synthetase, NADPH oxidase or nitric oxide synthases. In line with a NMDA receptor-, prostanoid- and Ca(2+)-dependence of NH4Cl-induced RNOS formation, Ca(2+) chelation and inhibition of NMDA receptors or cyclooxygenase suppressed NH4Cl-induced astrocyte swelling, whereas the Ca(2+)-ionophore ionomycin, NMDA, glutamate and prostanoids induced rapid astrocyte swelling. NH4Cl also induced swelling of cultured microglia in a glutamine-synthesis dependent way, but had no effect on cell volume of cultured neurons. It is concluded that the pathways which trigger RNOS formation in astrocytes also trigger astrocyte swelling, whereas conversely and as shown previously hypoosmotic astrocyte swelling can induce RNOS formation. This establishes a complex interplay with an auto-amplificatory loop between RNOS formation and astrocyte swelling as an important event in the pathogenesis of HE.",

    "137": "Brucine, one of the main active ingredients in semen Strychni, has been included in many oral prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, we investigated the in vitro metabolism of brucine by human liver microsomes (HLMs) and the metabolic interactions of brucine with the substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP450). Brucine was incubated with HLMs or CYP3A4 and then analysed by Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. The Km and Vmax values for HLMs were 30.53\u00b13.14\u03bcM and 0.08\u00b10.0029nmol/mg protein/min, respectively, while the corresponding values for CYP3A4 were 20.12\u00b13.05\u03bcM and 6.40\u00b10.21nmol/nmol P450/min. CYP3A4 may be the major enzyme responsible for brucine metabolism in HLMs, other human isoforms of CYP showed minimal or no effect on brucine metabolism. The inhibitory action of brucine was observed in CYP3A4 for the 1'-hydroxylation of midazolam, with inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) of 8.4-fold higher than specific inhibitors in HLMs. Furthermore, brucine significantly inhibited the CYP3A4-catalyzed midazolam 1'-hydroxylation (Ki=2.14\u03bcM) at a concentration lower than 10\u03bcM, but no obvious inhibitory effects were observed on other CYP substrates (IC50>50\u03bcM).

    "138": "Clinicians treating schizophrenia routinely employ high doses and/or antipsychotic switching to achieve response. However, little is actually known regarding the value of these interventions in early schizophrenia. Data were gathered from a treatment algorithm implemented in patients with first-episode schizophrenia that employs two antipsychotic trials at increasing doses before clozapine. Patients were initially treated with either olanzapine or risperidone across three dose ranges, (low, full, high), and in the case of suboptimal response were switched to the alternate antipsychotic. We were interested in the value of (a) high dose treatment and (b) antipsychotic switching. A total of 244 patients were evaluated, with 74.5% (184/244) responsive to Trial 1, and only 16.7% (10/60) responsive to Trial 2. Percentage of response for subjects switched from olanzapine to risperidone was 4.0% (1/25) vs. 25.7% (9/35) for those switched from risperidone to olanzapine. High doses yielded a 15.5% response (14.6% for risperidone vs. 16.7% for olanzapine).The present findings concur with other research indicating that response rate to the initial antipsychotic trial in first-episode schizophrenia is robust; thereafter it declines notably. In general, the proportion of responders to antipsychotic switching and high dose interventions was low. For both strategies olanzapine proved superior to risperidone, particularly in the case of antipsychotic switching (i.e. risperidone to olanzapine vs. vice versa). It remains to be established whether further antipsychotic trials are associated with even greater decrements in rate of response. Findings underscore the importance of moving to clozapine when treatment resistance has been established.",

Electroencephalography (EEG) revealed marked photoparoxysmal responses (PPR) at 3-20 Hz of photic stimulation and diffuse spike-wave bursts during sleep. A 24-h video EEG identified 11 episodes of repetitive blinking, 3 of which resulted in widespread spike-wave discharges. These suggested that the behavior of the patient represented self-induction of PPR. Valproate sodium was ineffective in decreasing PPR, as revealed by EEG, and the frequency of blinking episodes, but clonazepam attenuated PPR and significantly decreased the blinking behavior.", 
    "140": "Anecdotal reports have surfaced concerning misuse of the HIV antiretroviral medication efavirenz ((4S)-6-chloro-4-(2-cyclopropylethynyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2,4-dihydro-1H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one) by HIV patients and non-infected teens who crush the pills and smoke the powder for its psychoactive effects. Molecular profiling of the receptor pharmacology of efavirenz pinpointed interactions with multiple established sites of action for other known drugs of abuse including catecholamine and indolamine transporters, and GABAA and 5-HT(2A) receptors. In rodents, interaction with the 5-HT(2A) receptor, a primary site of action of lysergic acid diethylamine (LSD), appears to dominate efavirenz's behavioral profile. Both LSD and efavirenz reduce ambulation in a novel open-field environment. Efavirenz occasions drug-lever responding in rats discriminating LSD from saline, and this effect is abolished by selective blockade of the 5-HT(2A) receptor. Similar to LSD, efavirenz induces head-twitch responses in wild-type, but not in 5-HT(2A)-knockout, mice. Despite having GABAA-potentiating effects (like benzodiazepines and barbiturates), and interactions with dopamine transporter, serotonin transporter, and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (like cocaine and methamphetamine), efavirenz fails to maintain responding in rats that self-administer cocaine, and it fails to produce a conditioned place preference. Although its molecular pharmacology is multifarious, efavirenz's prevailing behavioral effect in rodents is consistent with LSD-like activity mediated via the 5-HT(2A) receptor. This finding correlates, in part, with the subjective experiences in humans who abuse efavirenz and with specific dose-dependent adverse neuropsychiatric events, such as hallucinations and night terrors, reported by HIV patients taking it as a medication.", 
    "141": "We examined initiation of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) to determine whether ChEIs were being newly prescribed without sufficient evaluation for dementia and/or delirium and to explore whether there are differences in outcomes, such as mortality, hospital readmission rates, and duration of hospitalization, between patients newly started on ChEI and those who continued such medications prior to admission. Patients hospitalized in fiscal year 2008 and prescribed ChEI were identified. We reviewed electronic medical records. Of 282 patients, 15.6% (44) were new-starts and 84.4% (238) were continuations. Median length of stay was 16 days in new-starts versus 6 days in continuations (P < .05). Of new-starts, 38.6% were also treated of infection. Chart review additionally suggested possible treatment of delirium by initiation of benzodiazepines and antipsychotics in 11.4% and 22.7% of new-starts, respectively. We observed a substantive practice of initiating ChEIs in hospitalized elderly patients at risk of delirium. Although there was no difference in the 30-day mortality or readmission rates, new-starts were more likely to have a longer hospital stay than continuation patients.", 
    "142": "Insomnia is a serious medical and social problem, its prevalence in the general population ranges from 9 to 35% depending on the country and assessment method. Often, patients are subject to inappropriate and therefore dangerous pharmacotherapies that include prolonged administration of hypnotic drugs, benzodiazepines and other GABAA receptor modulators. This usually does not lead to a satisfactory improvement in patients' clinical states and may cause lifelong drug dependence. Brain state transitions require the coordinated activity of numerous neuronal pathways and brain structures. It is thought that orexin-expressing neurons play a crucial role in this process. Due to their interaction with the sleep-wake-regulating neuronal population, they can activate vigilance-promoting regions and prevent unwanted sleep intrusions. Understanding the multiple orexin modulatory effects is crucial in the context of pathogenesis of insomnia and should lead to the development of novel treatments. An important step in this process was the synthesis of dual antagonists of orexin receptors. Crucially, these drugs, as opposed to benzodiazepines, do not change the sleep architecture and have limited side-effects. This new pharmacological approach might be the most appropriate to treat insomnia.",

Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was inhibited not only by nitric oxide synthase inhibitors (10 \u00b5M L-NAME or 10 \u00b5M 7-nitroindazole) but also by 10 \u00b5M atropine and some selective muscarinic receptor antagonists (10(-6) M 11-([2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperdinyl]acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one and 10(-6) M 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine). In contrast, relaxation was significantly increased by pretreatment of the strips with 10 mM L-arginine.",

    "149": "Signs of acute cor pulmonale were detected on transthoracic echocardiography despite lack of pulmonary embolism in computed tomography. It was assumed that microembolisms were the cause of acute pulmonary hypertension after intravenous injection of heroin and flunitrazepam.", 
    "150": "Because of lack of thrombus in CT scan therapeutic anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin and oxygen insufflation was initiated resulting in rapid improvement of oxygen saturation and blood pressure. On the following day pulmonary pressure in transthoracic echocardiography was already decreased significantly. Without signs of deep venous thrombosis in duplex scan and only a marginal sub segmental perfusion deficit in ventilation-perfusion-scintigraphy therapeutic anticoagulation was recommended for three months.", 
    "151": "The most likely cause of micro embolisms in this case are particles of talc, which are often used to cut heroin, or the microcrystalline cellulose used in tablets. There have been reports of tissue necrosis due to arterial embolism/vasospasm by crystalloid or oily substances (embolia cutis medicamentosa) in the extremities after intraarterial injection of grinded flunitrazepam tablets. Therefore it seems plausible that intravenous application may cause a serve but transient deficit of perfusion in pulmonary circulation.", 
    "152": "Effects of green tea extract (GTE) on the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and pharmacokinetics of simvastatin (SIM) were investigated in rats. Inhibitory effects of GTE on CYP3A activity were investigated in rat hepatic microsomes (RHM) using midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation as a probe reaction. SD female rats received a single oral dose of GTE (400 mg/kg) or troleandomycin (TAO, a CYP3A selective inhibitor, 500 mg/kg), followed 30 min later by SIM (20 mg/kg). Plasma concentrations of SIM and its active metabolite, simvastatin acid, were determined up to 6 h after the SIM administration using LC/MS/MS. In RHM, GTE inhibited MDZ 1'-hydroxylation with IC\u2085\u2080 and K(i)(app) values of 12.5 and 18.8 \u00b5g/mL, respectively, in a noncompetitive manner. Area under plasma concentration-time curves for SIM in the GTE and TAO groups were increased by 3.4- and 10.2-fold, respectively, compared with the control. The maximum concentrations of SIM were higher in the GTE (3.3-fold) and TAO (9.5-fold) groups. GTE alters the pharmacokinetics of SIM, probably by inhibiting intestinal CYP3A.", 
    "153": "Anxiety disorders and substance abuse, including benzodiazepine use disorder, frequently occur together. Unfortunately, treatment of anxiety disorders still includes benzodiazepines, and patients with an existing comorbid benzodiazepine use disorder or a genetic susceptibility for benzodiazepine use disorder may be at risk of adverse treatment outcomes. The identification of genetic predictors for anxiety disorders, and especially for benzodiazepine use disorder, could aid the selection of the best treatment option and improve clinical outcomes. The brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor I-associated protein 3 (Baiap3) is a member of the mammalian uncoordinated 13 (Munc13) protein family of synaptic regulators of neurotransmitter exocytosis, with a striking expression pattern in amygdalae, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray. Deletion of Baiap3 in mice leads to enhanced seizure propensity and increased anxiety, with the latter being more pronounced in female than in male animals. We hypothesized that genetic variation in human BAIAP3 may also be associated with anxiety. By using a phenotype-based genetic association study, we identified two human BAIAP3 single-nucleotide polymorphism risk genotypes (AA for rs2235632, TT for rs1132358) that show a significant association with anxiety in women and, surprisingly, with benzodiazepine abuse in men. Returning to mice, we found that male, but not female, Baiap3 knockout (KO) mice develop tolerance to diazepam more quickly than control animals. Analysis of cultured Baiap3 KO hypothalamus slices revealed an increase in basal network activity and an altered response to diazepam withdrawal. Thus, Baiap3/BAIAP3 is gender specifically associated with anxiety and benzodiazepine use disorder, and the analysis of Baiap3/BAIAP3-related functions may help elucidate mechanisms underlying the development of both disorders.",

Exclusion of epilepsy, acute, atrophic or expansive lesion of central nervous system and usual etiology associated with reversible dementia (infectious diseases, an endocrine etiology and deficiency of vitamins other than cobalamin); finding of cobalamin deficiency only and complete neuropsychiatric recovery after substitution, confirmed etiology.

Anesthesia was induced with midazolam (5 mg) and remifentanil (0.1.ag x kg-1 x min-1) and the trachea was intubated following administration of rocuronium. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol (1.2-4.0 mg x kg-1 x hr-1), remifentanil (0.1-0.4microg kg 1 x min-1), and rocuronium (10 mg) as needed. The dose of propofol was controlled so that bispectral index (BIS) ranged between 40 and 60 during surgery. The duration of surgery was 10 hr 29 min. Administration of propofol and remifentanil was terminated at the end of surgery. After confirmation of T2 appearance by train-of-four stimuli, sugammadex (2 mg x kg 1) was intravenously administered. Although respiratory rate and tidal volume were 12-18 breaths x min-1 and 350-450 ml, respectively, she remained unconsciousness at about 40 of BIS. We could not find any factors associated with delayed emergence from anesthesia. Flumazenil (0.5 mg) was administered intravenously 90 min after termination of anesthesia. Two min later, she became fully awake and alert with increase in BIS (above 90). Laboratory examination showed that the plasma concentrations of propofol, midazolam, and its active metabolite alpha-hydroxymidazolam before administration of flumazenil were within the range considered to have no sedative effects. From experience of this case, administration of flumazenil may be beneficial for improvement in consciousness in cases with unexpectedly delayed emergence from anesthesia.",

Second-generation antipsychotic agents (SGAs; e.g., risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine) have generally shown a better safety profile compared to the first-generation agents (FGAs; e.g., haloperidol and phenothiazines), particularly in terms of a lower potential for involuntary movement disorders. Risperidone, the only SGA with an official indication for the management of inappropriate behaviour in dementia, has emerged as the antipsychotic most commonly prescribed to older patients. Most clinical trials evaluating the risk of movement disorders in elderly patients receiving antipsychotic therapy have been of limited sample size and/or of relatively short duration. A few observational studies have produced inconsistent results.",

The users reported significantly more difficulties with falling asleep, had more midnight awakenings, felt less rested in the morning, and had a poorer self-perceived sleep quality compared to nonusers. Sleep duration and time to fall asleep did not differ. The self-perceived sleep quality was mainly determined by difficulties during initiation of sleep. After controlling for demographic, medication, and functional characteristics, BZD use remained strongly associated with poor sleep (r=0.173; P=.003), and a study centre effect (differences among nursing homes) was observed (r=0.229; P<.001).",

These properties can be calculated rapidly and are thus amenable to high-throughput industrial applications. Their statistical performance was compared with that of conventional 3D-QSAR approaches using nine data sets (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchE), benzodiazepine receptor ligands (BZR), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX2), dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (DHFR), glycogen phosphorylase b inhibitors (GPB), thermolysin inhibitors (THER), thrombin inhibitors (THR), and serine protease factor Xa inhibitors (fXa)). The 3D-QSAR models generated were tested thoroughly for robustness and predictive ability. The average performance of the quantum mechanical molecular interaction field (QM-MIF) models for the nine data sets is better than that of the conventional force field-based MIFs. In the individual data sets, the QM-MIF models always perform better than, or as well as, the conventional approaches. It is particularly encouraging that the relative performance of the QM-MIF models improves in the external validation. In addition, the models generated showed statistical stability with respect to model building procedure variations such as grid spacing size and grid orientation. QM-MIF contour maps reproduce the features important for ligand binding for the example data set (factor Xa inhibitors), demonstrating the intuitive chemical interpretability of QM-MIFs.",

    "190": "This study assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic interaction between PA-824, a novel antitubercular nitroimidazo-oxazine, and midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, in 14 healthy adult male and female subjects. The study followed up on observations in vitro that PA-824 caused weak and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4. Subjects received a single oral dose of midazolam (2 mg), followed by a 2-day washout. After the washout, all subjects received PA-824 (400 mg) once daily for 14 consecutive days. On day 14, all subjects received the final PA-824 dose coadministered with a 2-mg oral dose of midazolam. The pharmacokinetic endpoints AUC0-t, AUC(0-\u221e), and C(max) for midazolam and 1-hydroxy midazolam were compared between midazolam administered alone versus midazolam coadministered with PA-824. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the mean midazolam values of C(max), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-\u221e) parameters were reduced by ca. 16, 15, and 15%, respectively, when PA-824 was coadministered with midazolam. The total exposure (AUC) of 1-hydroxy midazolam was 13 to 14% greater when coadministered with PA-824 compared to midazolam administered alone. The Cmax of 1-hydroxy midazolam was similar between treatments. Based on these results, PA-824 does not inhibit or induce CYP3A4 to a clinically meaningful extent and is not likely to markedly affect the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 metabolized drugs.",

The preliminary findings suggest that the study protocol used to collect and analyze the samples was unable to produce results that could be generalized to the young adult population in Norway. Analysis of hair samples may underestimate the use of cannabis, alcohol, amphetamine and methamphetamine. It may, however, be done to estimate cocaine and general drug use if a sample-collection procedure different from that described in our study is used and includes information about hair length, sample length, length from the scalp, cosmetic treatment, washing and whether the samples always get washed/decontaminated prior to analysis.", 
    "192": "Prescribing benzodiazepines during buprenorphine treatment is a topic of active discussion. Clinical benefit is unclear. Overdose, accidental injury, and benzodiazepine misuse remain concerns. We examine the relationship between benzodiazepine misuse history, benzodiazepine prescription, and both clinical and safety outcomes during buprenorphine treatment.", 
    "193": "We retrospectively examined outpatient buprenorphine treatment records, classifying patients by past-year benzodiazepine misuse history and approved benzodiazepine prescription at intake. Primary clinical outcomes included 12-month treatment retention and urine toxicology for illicit opioids. Primary safety outcomes included total emergency department (ED) visits and odds of an ED visit related to overdose or accidental injury during treatment.", 
    "194": "The 12-month treatment retention rate for the sample (N=328) was 40%. Neither benzodiazepine misuse history nor benzodiazepine prescription was associated with treatment retention or illicit opioid use. Poisson regressions of ED visits during buprenorphine treatment revealed more ED visits among those with a benzodiazepine prescription versus those without (p<0.001); benzodiazepine misuse history had no effect. The odds of an accidental injury-related ED visit during treatment were greater among those with a benzodiazepine prescription (OR: 3.7, p<0.01), with an enhanced effect among females (OR: 4.7, p<0.01). Overdose was not associated with benzodiazepine misuse history or prescription.", 
    "195": "We found no effect of benzodiazepine prescriptions on opioid treatment outcomes; however, benzodiazepine prescription was associated with more frequent ED visits and accidental injuries, especially among females. When prescribing benzodiazepines during buprenorphine treatment, patients need more education about accidental injury risk. Alternative treatments for anxiety should be considered when possible, especially among females.", 
    "196": "Digoxin is the recommended substrate for assessment of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) in vivo. The overall aim of our study was to investigate the inhibitory potential of both verapamil and norverapamil on the P-gp-mediated efflux of digoxin in both gut and liver. Therefore, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for verapamil and its primary metabolite was developed and validated through the recovery of observed clinical plasma concentration data for both moieties and the reported interaction with midazolam, albeit a cytochrome P450 3A4-mediated DDI. The validated inhibitor model was then used in conjunction with the model developed previously for digoxin. The range of values obtained for the 10 trials indicated that increases in area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) profiles and maximum plasma concentration observed (Cmax ) values of digoxin following administration of verapamil were more comparable with in vivo observations, when P-gp inhibition by the metabolite, norverapamil, was considered as well. The predicted decrease in AUC and Cmax values of digoxin following administration of rifampicin because of P-gp induction was 1.57- (range: 1.42-1.77) and 1.62-fold (range: 1.53-1.70), which were reasonably consistent with observed values of 1.4- and 2.2-fold, respectively. This study demonstrates the application of permeability-limited models of absorption and distribution within a PBPK framework together with relevant in vitro data on transporters to assess the clinical impact of modulated P-gp-mediated efflux by drugs in development.",

    "203": "60 children were recruited; 29 were assigned for treatment with midazolam and 31 for the combination of midazolam and ketamine. There were no differences in basic demographics and wound characteristics between the groups. VAS assessment by a parent was 4.5\u00b13.3 mm in the midazolam+ketamine group versus 4.4\u00b12.7 mm in the midazolam alone group (mean difference 0.1, CI -1.9 to 1.71). Sedation Score during procedure was lower in the midazolam+ketamine group (mean difference 1.14, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.6). Intravenous sedation was required in two (6%) of the children in the midazolam+ketamine group, and in eight (27%) in the midazolam alone group. p=0.039. No clinically significant adverse effects were documented in either group.", 
    "204": "No difference was found in pain assessment during local anaesthetic injection between the group treated with midazolam and ketamine, and the group treated with midazolam alone.

    "206": "Synthesis of ligands inactive or with low activity at \u03b1\u2081 GABA(A) receptors has become the key concept for development of novel, more tolerable benzodiazepine (BZ)-like drugs. WYS8, a remarkably (105 times) \u03b1\u2081-subtype selective partial positive modulator, may serve as a pharmacological tool for refining the role of \u03b1\u2081 GABA(A) receptors in mediation of BZs' effects.", 
    "207": "Here, the effects of WYS8 on GABA-induced currents and on diazepam-induced potentiation of recombinant BZ-sensitive GABA(A) receptors were studied in more detail. In addition, the behavioral profile of WYS8 (0.2, 1, and 10 mg/kg i.p.), on its own and in combination with diazepam, was tested in the spontaneous locomotor activity, elevated plus maze, grip strength, rotarod, and pentylenetetrazole tests.", 
    "208": "WYS8, applied at an in vivo attainable concentration of 100 nM, reduced the stimulation of GABA currents by 1 \u03bcM diazepam by 57 % at \u03b1\u2081\u03b2\u2083\u03b3\u2082, but not at \u03b1\u2082\u03b2\u2083\u03b3\u2082, \u03b1\u2083\u03b2\u2083\u03b3\u2082, or \u03b1\u2085\u03b2\u2083\u03b3\u2082 GABA(A) receptors. The administration of WYS8 alone induced negligible behavioral consequences. When combined with diazepam, WYS8 caused a reduction in sedation, muscle relaxation, and anticonvulsant activity, as compared with this BZ alone, whereas ataxia was preserved, and the anxiolytic effect of 2 mg/kg diazepam was unmasked.", 
    "209": "Hence, a partial instead of full activation at \u03b1\u2081 GABA(A) receptors did not necessarily result in the attenuation of the effects assumed to be mediated by activation of these receptors, or in the full preservation of the effects mediated by activation of other GABA(A) receptors. Thus, the role of \u03b1\u2081 GABA(A) receptors appears more complex than that proposed by genetic studies.", 
    "210": "GABA is an inhibitory transmitter found in rat salivary gland. However, the inhibitory potential of GABA on salivary secretion is unclear. Using an in vivo cannulation method, intraperitoneal administration of GABA was ineffective in the absence of gabaculine, a GABA transaminase inhibitor, on pilocarpine-induced salivary secretion, suggesting that GABA was rendered metabolically inactive before reaching the salivary gland. We hypothesized that the action of a drug on the salivary glands could be measured directly using a submandibular gland perfusion system. The submandibular gland artery, veins, and duct were cannulated in situ so that physiological functions such as innervation would not be compromised. Hank's balanced salt solution (pH 7.4) was perfused at a rate of 0.5 ml/min together with 1 \u03bcM carbachol (CCh) over a 5-min period every 30 min. Amount of secreted saliva showed no change to the recurrent addition of CCh to the perfusate. GABA or muscimol dose-dependently inhibited CCh-induced salivary secretion. This effect was blocked by bicuculline, a GABA(A)-receptor (GABA(A)-R) antagonist, and enhanced by clonazepam, a central-type benzodiazepine-receptor agonist. These results suggest that salivary secretion is suppressed by GABA(A)-R in rat salivary gland and that the perfusion method used was effective in clarifying inhibitory regulation of GABA(A)-R.",

    "212": "This was a prospective study of elderly patients (>65 years) with ABD requiring parenteral sedation and physical restraint in the ED. Patients were treated with a standardized sedation protocol that included droperidol. Drug administration, time to sedation, additional sedation, and adverse effects were recorded. Effective sedation was defined as a drop in the sedation assessment tool score by 2 or a score of zero or less.", 
    "213": "There were 49 patients with median age of 81 years (range, 65-93 years); 33 were males. Thirty patients were given 10 mg droperidol, 15 were given 5 mg droperidol, 2 were given 2.5 mg, and 2 were given midazolam. Median time to sedation for patients receiving 10 mg droperidol was 30 minutes (interquartile range, 18-40 minutes), compared with 21 minutes (interquartile range, 10-55 minutes; P = .55) for patients receiving 5 mg droperidol. Three patients were not sedated within 120 minutes. Eighteen patients required additional sedation-10 of 30 (33%; 95% confidence interval, 18%-53%) given droperidol 10 mg compared with 7 of 15 (47%; 95% confidence interval, 22%-73%) given 5 mg. Fourteen patients required resedation. Adverse effects occurred in 5 patients (hypotension [2], oversedation [2], hypotension/oversedation [1])-2 of 30 given 10 mg droperidol and 3 of 19 not treated according to protocol. Midazolam was given initially or for additional sedation in 2 of 5 adverse effects. No patient had QT prolongation.",

    "215": "Olanzapine (OZ) is atypical antipsychotic drug that suffers from low brain permeability due to efflux by P-glycoproteins and hepatic first-pass metabolism. The current work aimed to develop OZ-loaded micellar nanocarriers and investigate their nose-to-brain targeting potential. OZ-loaded (5mg/ml) micelles (F1-F12) were prepared, using a Pluronic(\u00ae) mixture of L121 and P123, adopting thin-film hydration method. The micelles were evaluated for turbidity, particle size, morphology, drug-entrapment efficiency (EE%), drug-loading characteristics, in vitro drug release and ex vivo nasal toxicity in sheep. The in vivo biodistribution and pharmacokinetic studies in the brain/blood following intravenous (i.v.) and intranasal (i.n.) administrations of technetium-labeled OZ-loaded micelles and OZ-solution were evaluated in rats. Spherical micelles ranging in size from 18.97 to 380.70 nm were successfully developed. (1)H NMR studies confirmed OZ incorporation into micelle core. At a drug:Pluronic(\u00ae) L121:Pluronic(\u00ae) P123 ratio of 1:8:32 (F11), the micelles achieved a conciliation between kinetic and thermodynamic stability, high drug-EE%, controlled drug-release characteristics and evoked minor histopathological changes in sheep nasal mucosa. The significantly (P<0.05) higher values for F11 micelles (i.n.); brain/blood ratio (0.92), drug targeting index (5.20), drug targeting efficiency (520.26%) and direct transport percentage (80.76%) confirm the development of a promising non-invasive OZ-loaded nose-to-brain delivery system.", 
    "216": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine derivative drug that has powerful anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, and sedative properties. The cytoprotective effect of midazolam on brain astrocytes is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the cytoprotective effect of midazolam on astrocytes exposed to corticosterone, a stress-produced glucocorticoid. We found that midazolam stimulated pregnenolone and progesterone secretion in astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Midazolam protected astrocytes from corticosterone-induced damages in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we demonstrated that progesterone reduced corticosterone-induced damages. Finally, we applied trilostane, an inhibitor of 3\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, to inhibit pregnenolone metabolism and found that pretreatment with trilostane significantly inhibited the cytoprotective effect of midazolam on corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity in rat astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, these results demonstrate that midazolam has cytoprotective effect on astrocytes. This is, at least partially, derived from midazolam-induced steroidogenesis including progesterone and downstream products in astrocytes. Our data provide new insights into the cytoprotective effect of midazolam.",
