Six combinations of three PN solutions with amino acid concentrations of 1.5%, 2.5%, and 5% and two midazolam concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL) were prepared in triplicate and stored at room temperature under normal fluorescent lighting. Duplicate samples were visually inspected for color change, precipitation, or gas formation and tested for pH. The samples were evaluated for midazolam and amino acid content by high-performance liquid chromatography at zero, one, three, and five hours. Midazolam and amino acid concentrations did not change significantly during the study. There was no evidence of color change, precipitation, or gas formation with any midazolam-PN solution combination when the combinations were examined visually and under a microscope, and no substantial changes in pH occurred. Midazolam 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL (as the hydrochloride salt) was stable in the three PN solutions studied; in addition, the amino acids present in the 1.5%, 2.5%, and 5% amino acid PN solutions were stable when combined with midazolam at concentrations of 0.1 and 0.5 mg/mL.", 
    "1": "Male Mol: SPRD rats were treated with 5 or 20 mg/kg of diazepam for 4 days. The treatment was repeated at two different ages. Diazepam was either dissolved in Intralipid (KABI, Sweden) or dispersed in gummi arabicum. Tolerance induced by the treatment was tested with an EEG-threshold technique where hexobarbital was infused intravenously on day 1, 4, 7 and 14 of the abstinence. The threshold was the dose of hexobarbital needed to induce a burst suppression of 1 sec. or more (silent second). After the first diazepam treatment significant increase in the hexobarbital threshold doses were recorded in all but one of the diazepam treated groups. The pattern varied depending on dose, age and solvent. After the second treatment tolerance was seen only when diazepam had been dissolved in Intralipid. Short term treatment with diazepam can induce cross-tolerance to hexobarbital which probably is due to an increased excitation (physical dependence) in abstinence after treatment with diazepam.", 
    "2": "Lorazepam is commonly used to produce sedation in infants. As errors may occur with the measurement of small volumes of concentrated drugs, we studied the stability of lorazepam diluted from 4 mg/ml to 1 mg/ml in bacteriostatic water for injection at two temperatures. The diluted lorazepam was stored in 10 glass vials (five at 22 degrees C and five at 4 degrees C). Samples were collected at 0, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 70 and 91 days after storage at each temperature. Lorazepam was measured in duplicate from each of five vials (n = 10) at each temperature by a specific and stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method. After 7 days' storage, the mean lorazepam concentration was 88% of the original concentration at 22 degrees C, and 90% of the original concentration at 4 degrees C. After 2 weeks of storage, the mean lorazepam concentration was 42% of the original concentration at 22 degrees C, and 1.5% of the original concentration at 4 degrees C. Crystals appeared after 4 weeks of storage at 22 degrees C and after 2 weeks of storage at 4 degrees C. At 3 months the mean lorazepam concentration was 6.1% and 7.5% of the original concentration at 22 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively. Thus, lorazepam diluted in bacteriostatic water for injection and stored in glass vials is stable for less than 7 days at 22 degrees C and for 7 days at 4 degrees C.", 
    "3": "The effects of 0.014 mg/kg intravenous alprazolam administration on cerebral blood flow (CBF), memory, sedation, and plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine were determined in eight healthy males at baseline levels and following 1 week of daily oral alprazolam treatment. At baseline, intravenous alprazolam administration caused acute reductions in whole-brain CBF (25% to 30% decrease), memory, plasma epinephrine, and self-rated alertness. Following 1 week of alprazolam treatment, tolerance developed to the acute effects of intravenous alprazolam on CBF, memory, and plasma epinephrine. There were no consistent regional neuroanatomic differences in the CBF effects of acute alprazolam, or in the development of tolerance to these effects, and no correlations between the various measures of acute alprazolam effects on either test day.", 
    "4": "To evaluate whether midazolam has analgesic properties in humans after intravenous injection we studied the influence of a subhypnotic dose of midazolam (50 micrograms/kg) on the cumulative alfentanil consumption in 53 patients during extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) using a patient-controlled analgesia system (PCAS). In a randomised double blind fashion all patients received either midazolam or an equal volume of saline (placebo) prior to ESWL. Heart rate and arterial blood pressure were measured before and during ESWL. Alfentanil consumption was assessed 20 minutes after injection of midazolam or placebo, respectively. All patients received oxygen via face mask. In patients older than 60 years (median: 70 years, range: 61-88 years) pretreatment with midazolam resulted in a significantly lower cumulative alfentanil consumption (0.41 vs 0.97 mg; p = 0.027) compared with patients younger than 60 years after midazolam pretreatment (0.84 vs 0.71 mg; p = 0.27). Mean arterial pressure also was significantly lower in the former compared with the latter group, while heart rate remained unchanged. In contrast, in patients younger than 60 years (median: 47 years, range: 24-56 years) no significant differences were observed between the midazolam and the placebo group. Thus, low dose intravenous midazolam pretreatment led to a significant decrease of alfentanil consumption in patients beyond 60 years of age. We conclude that subhypnotic doses of midazolam are capable of reducing alfentanil demand in elderly but not in younger patients during ESWL.", 
    "5": "A cross-sectional community survey was undertaken to investigate the pattern of psychotropic drug consumption in 453 community residents of South Verona. Overall, 15.0% of the subjects were taking psychotropics (benzodiazepines 13.5%, antidepressants 2.2%, neuroleptics 1.1%). Prevalence was higher in females (20.0%), in those over 45 years (25%), in high General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) scorers (26.2%), and in subjects with physical ill-health (27.0%), with social problems (20.0%), with distressing events (22.0%) and with alcohol abuse (32.3%). Logistic regression analysis showed that age, sex, GHQ score, physical ill-health and life events were all significantly and independently associated with psychotropic drug consumption.", 
    "6": "Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine of long half-life with sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant properties. It has proved effective in controlling terminal agitation, confusion, restlessness, dystonia and fitting in adults and can be given by subcutaneous infusion in combination with other drugs. Its use in children during their terminal illness is described. Good symptom control without excessive sedation was achieved over the 24 h prior to death.", 
    "7": "A three days old mature female newborn presented with seizures. The diagnostic data revealed a hyponatraemia (113 mmol/l) as pathogenic origin. Further causes of convulsions could be excluded. Administering saline solution (0.9%) intravenously the plasma sodium level reached normal ranges within 36 hours. We propose that an excessive enteral administration of glucose solution during the first three days of life must have led to dilutional hyponatraemia. This suggestion is in accordance with observations in older children presenting with similar symptoms.", 
    "8": "Twenty-two patients who underwent chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) at doses > 100 mg/m2 also received antiemetic treatment comprised of the combination of ondansetron plus dexamethasone. The results obtained have shown a good activity from this combination with these high doses of CDDP, with a response of 81.8% (complete+major protection). There were also three therapeutic failures in patients with a few negative prognostic characteristics. It is our intention to use a benzodiazepine and adequate psychological support in an attempt to increase the response percentages in these kinds of patients.", 
    "9": "In an effort to validate methods to be used in a screen for drugs effective as anticonvulsants for soman-induced convulsions, scopolamine (0.2 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 mg/kg) were given (i.m.) to male guinea pigs as a pretreatment 30 min before a convulsant dose of soman. Pyridostigmine, atropine and pralidoxime chloride also were given to counteract the lethality of soman. All animals challenged with soman and which did not receive either diazepam or scopolamine exhibited convulsive status epilepticus (SE), identified by continuous electrographic seizure activity (EGSA) and continuous motor convulsions. Despite the presence of continuous motor convulsions in all animals pretreated with diazepam and challenged with soman, EGSA was not observed in five of the seven animals. Continuous motor convulsions developed in four of seven animals pretreated with scopolamine and challenged with soman, but EGSA was not observed in any scopolamine-pretreated guinea pig. Neuronal necrosis was observed in the hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala, and cerebral and pyriform cortices in each animal with EGSA, but not brain damage was found in subjects without EGSA. Thus, although convulsions, EGSA and brain damage normally occur together in animals exposed to soman, the convulsions can be pharmacologically dissociated from the EGSA and brain damage, demonstrating that the clinically manifested convulsions are not dependent on EGSA recorded from the cortex or on abnormal activity which leads to neuronal necrosis in the forebrain.", 
    "10": "A new sensitive method using solid-phase column extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) has been developed for the determination of lorazepam and its glucuronide metabolite in human plasma. Extraction was performed with a C2-Bond Elut column followed by reverse-phase HPLC of the sample. The detection limit of lorazepam in plasma was 0.5 micrograms/L. Standard curves over the concentration range from 2.5 to 75 micrograms/L had good linearity. Intra-assay variability ranged from 2.0 to 6.2% and interassay variability from 4.8 to 8% at the concentration range of 5-50 micrograms/L.", 
    "11": "The use of a drug screening service has been investigated over a nine month period during which 1500 urine samples from 765 patients were analysed. Preliminary drug screening of urine samples was performed by EMIT immunoassays adapted for use on the Cobas Bio analyser; further identification and confirmation were carried out by Toxi-Lab thin-layer chromatography and capillary gas chromatography. A large number of positive results were obtained for benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, methadone and opiates (mainly dihydrocodeine). Only a limited number of urines gave positive results for amphetamine and related stimulants; cocaine metabolite was rarely detected in samples. The service proved to be of considerable value in the management of drug misusers, and for the identification of new substances taken by the local population.", 
    "12": "The effect of pyritinol, a commonly used nootropic drug, on receptor properties and function was investigated in different neuronal systems, possibly associated with age-related decline in brain function. Chronic treatment (15 days) of aged (22 months) female NMRI mice with pyritinol (200 mg/kg) restored the reduced density of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the aged mouse brain. Furthermore, the total number of binding sites of the alpha 2-receptor ([3H]yohimbine binding) decreased after treatment with drug, while the number of high-affinity agonist binding sites ([3H]UK 14304 binding) was not changed. In both systems, receptor affinity was not influenced. The densities of other receptors investigated (muscarinic-cholinergic, benzodiazepine and beta-adrenergic) were not altered by treatment with pyritinol. Additionally, the effect of pyritinol on phosphatidylinositol (PI) metabolism was investigated in dissociated neurones from young and aged mice. Muscarinic-cholinergic induced accumulation of phosphatidylinositol and the inositol phosphate response due to activation of G-protein by fluoride was increased in aged animals, treated with drug. The inositolphosphate response after stimulation with pilocarpine was slightly but not significantly increased. The metabolism of phosphatidylinositol in young animals was not altered by treatment with drug. These results support the hypothesis of a nootropic-mediated restoration of age-related brain deficits. Changes caused by pyritinol may be due to beneficial effects on age-related alterations of the properties of the neuronal membrane.", 
    "13": "Antidepressants reportedly increase appetite, carbohydrate craving and weight in some patients with depression and panic disorder. This paper presents the results of changes in appetite and weight in patients with panic disorder treated with imipramine, diazepam or placebo in a double-blind prospective study. Forty-four patients with panic disorder were randomly assigned imipramine, diazepam and placebo. The investigators monitored weight and the patients rated their appetite and cravings during the eight week study. No significant increases in weight or appetite were found in the patients with panic disorder patients.", 
    "14": "Cholecystokinin-JMV-180 (JMV-180) is an analogue of cholecystokinin C-terminal octapeptide (CCK-8), which has been shown to be an agonist at the proposed CCK pancreatic high-affinity site and a functional antagonist at the pancreatic low-affinity site in rats and to have agonist activity at both high- and low-affinity sites in the mouse. In this study we used JMV-180 to evaluate the potential participation of these two CCK-A sites in the satiety effect of CCK-8 in rats and mice. When tested at doses that ranged from 0.01 to 9.2 mumol/kg, JMV-180 did not reliably affect food intake of solid or liquid test diets in rats. When combined with CCK-8 (3.2 or 8.5 nmol/kg) JMV-180 dose dependently reversed the satiety effect of CCK-8. In contrast to these results in the rat, both JMV-180 (3.7-14.8 mumol/kg) and CCK-8 (1.7-6.8 nmol/kg) dose dependently reduced the intake of 20% sucrose in mice. Both CCK-8- and JMV-180-induced suppression of food intake were attenuated by the CCK-A antagonist MK-329 (24.8 nmol/kg). The results of these studies suggest that agonist activity at sites pharmacologically similar to the CCK pancreatic high-affinity site is not sufficient for expression of CCK satiety, whereas agonist activity at low-affinity-like sites is necessary to reduce food intake. Thus the anorexic activity of CCK appears to be mediated through an interaction with a receptor site pharmacologically similar to the pancreatic low-affinity CCK receptor site.", 
    "15": "General practitioners are responsible for about 90% of all prescriptions for psychotropic drugs which benzodiazepines account for approximately 75%. In order to obtain a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the consumption in Svendborg, all benzodiazepine prescriptions were registered during a two-month period (February and March 1990). A total of 3364 prescriptions were issued to 6% (2262 persons) of the population. Of these, 1837 (54.6%) were prescriptions for tranquillizers, 1272 (37.8%) for hypnotics and 255 (7.6%) for both tranquillizers and hypnotics. The prevalence of benzodiazepine users increased with age and women were responsible for about 2/3 of the total consumption. Small but frequent prescriptions were issued to the younger users of benzodiazepines while older users generally received prescriptions for greater quantities at longer intervals. One in four persons over 80 years of age used sedatives. On account of the pharmaceutical, social and economic consequences of the widespread use of benzodiazepines in the elderly population, restrain should be observed in prescribing benzodiazepines.", 
    "16": "Extracellular single-unit recording techniques were used to study the effects of the cholecystokinin-A (CCK-A) antagonist, L-364,718, and the CCK-B antagonist, PD 134308, on DA neuronal activity in chloral hydrate anesthetized rats. Neither L-364,718 (0.1-1.6 mg/kg i.v.) nor PD 134308 (0.1-6.4 mg/kg) altered the basal firing rate of substantia nigra or ventral tegmental area DA neurons. The ability of PD 134308 and L-364,718 to alter the apomorphine-induced inhibition of substantia nigra DA neurons was assessed. Pretreatment with L-364,718 (0.6 or 4.16 mg/kg i.v.) did not shift the apomorphine dose-response curve (0.5-32 micrograms/kg i.v.). In contrast, PD 134308 (0.6 or 6.4 mg/kg i.v.) produced dose-related, significant shifts to the right of the apomorphine dose-response curves. However, these effects were small in comparison to the haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg i.p.)-induced shift of the apomorphine curve. These data suggest that in the substantia nigra there may be a tonic level of CCK release that, through actions on CCK-B receptors, may modulate DA agonist-induced inhibition of DA neuronal activity.", 
    "17": "The specificity of benzodiazepine pretreatment on the reinforcing efficacy of cocaine was investigated using a multiple schedule of cocaine and food presentation. Cocaine was available under a fixed-ratio 4 schedule of reinforcement during 1 h of the session, while food was delivered under a discrete-trial, fixed-ratio 10 schedule during the other. Following initial exposure to alprazolam, responding maintained by both cocaine and food was significantly reduced. However, tolerance quickly developed to the sedative effects of alprazolam on food-maintained responding, while no reduction in the effects of the drug on cocaine self-administration was observed. Alprazolam (0.5 to 4.0 mg/kg, IP) significantly reduced cocaine intake without affecting food-maintained responding following subsequent testing with the drug. These data suggest a potential specific effect (e.g., anxiolytic) of alprazolam in cocaine reinforcement.", 
    "18": "Untreated rats normally avoid the open arms of the \"elevated plus-maze,\" preferring instead the closed arms, whereas rats treated with antianxiety drugs (e.g., diazepam) show far less open-arm avoidance. Although it has often been assumed that rats avoid the open arms because of novelty, height, or open space, the anxiogenic role of these stimuli in the plus-maze has not been systematically examined. In Experiment 1, rats were repeatedly exposed to the elevated plus-maze with the expectation that their \"fear\" of the open arms would habituate over trials. Instead, open-arm avoidance actually increased on the second trial and showed no evidence of habituating after 18 trials. In Experiment 2, three 30-min sessions of confinement to the open arms (\"flooding\") failed to decrease rats' open-arm avoidance. Instead, rats that had received flooding avoided the open arms significantly more than control rats during the first test. Experiment 3 showed that although diazepam-treated rats avoided the open arms less than vehicle-controls on the first test this difference dissipated across test trials. Further, diazepam had no carryover effect on rats' subsequent avoidance of the open arms in a nondrugged state. In Experiment 4, plus-maze height was varied from 50 to 6 cm, but rats did not display more open-arm activity as maze height decreased. In Experiment 5, height cues were manipulated by placing a \"floor\" 8 cm beneath one open arm while leaving the floor of the other open arm at 50 cm. Rats did not avoid the \"low\" open arm less than the \"high\" open arm.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "Recent studies have shown that lesions of the amygdala, as well as systemic administration of benzodiazepine receptor agonists, block the hypoalgesia and defensive behavior normally observed when rats are exposed to stimuli associated with shock. The present study was conducted to determine if the direct application of a small quantity of the benzodiazepine diazepam (DZP) to the amygdala would affect defensive freezing and hypoalgesia as measured by the formalin test. Independent groups of rats were prepared with chronic cannulae aimed at the basolateral or central regions of the amygdala. Bilateral injection of DZP (30 micrograms) into the basolateral amygdala attenuated both the defensive freezing behavior and the hypoalgesia seen during an 8-min period following a series of three brief foot-shocks. The same dose of DZP applied to the central amygdala attenuated the freezing response, although this effect may have been due to limited diffusion of the drug into the basolateral region. Baseline levels of formalin-induced behavior were not affected by DZP in either group. These results support the idea that hypoalgesia is one component of an integrated defensive response shown by rats in anxiety- or fear-related situations and that the amygdala represents an important forebrain component of a neural circuit that subserves the expression of this response.", 
    "20": "1. The effects of metoprolol-Oros 14/190 once daily, propranolol 80 mg twice daily and temazepam 10 mg once daily on central nervous system (CNS) related performance and haemodynamic variables were evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Drugs were administered for 3 consecutive days except for temazepam, which was administered on days 1 and 3 only. Treatment effects were evaluated at 0, 2, 5 and 8 h on days 1 and 3. 2. Neither beta-adrenoceptor blocker had significant effects in a battery of tests after single or 3 days dosing. Temazepam caused a decrease in saccadic peak velocity of 37.4 degrees s-1 (95% CI: 6.0, 68.9) at 2 h and an increase of auditory reaction times of 11.5 ms (0.2, 22.8) at 8 h on day 1. No significant effects of temazepam were detected on day 3. 3. Both beta-adrenoceptor blockers reduced exercise heart rate. Peak effects were measured at 2 h 40 min after propranolol but not metoprolol-Oros (difference, day 1:20 (11, 29) beats min-1, day 3:13 (8, 19) beats min-1). Both beta-adrenoceptor blockers significantly reduced baseline exercise heart rate on day 3. Compared with day 1, metoprolol-Oros caused larger reductions of exercise heart rate at all times on day 3. 4. Metoprolol-Oros and propranolol caused similar reductions of systolic- and diastolic blood pressure on days 1 and 3. Temazepam caused a small reduction in diastolic blood pressure at 5 h 40 min on day 1 but was otherwise devoid of haemodynamic effects.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "21": "The trophic effect of cholecystokinin (CCK) on the pancreas was examined in portacava-shunted (PCS) rats. Exogenous CCK-8s and the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide were infused continuously by means of osmotic minipumps. HyperCCKemia of endogenous origin was induced by pancreaticobiliary diversion (PBD), which is known to cause growth of the pancreas. The results showed that PCS as such was without a trophic effect on the pancreas, whereas the combination of CCK-8s and PCS or PBD and PCS increased the trophic effects on the pancreas compared with CCK-8s or PBD alone. Moreover, the trophic effects of PBD and of the combination of PBD and PCS could be prevented by CCK-A receptor blockade (devazepide infusion). The results suggest that the capacity of the pancreas to respond to CCK is exaggerated--for as yet unknown reasons--after PCS.", 
    "22": "Surface-induced hypothermia is used to protect tissues from ischemic events during surgery. In a review of 19 clinical cases in dogs, the technique was used to enable intracardiac surgery (4 dogs) and to facilitate removal of extensive thoracic or abdominal masses (15 dogs). For 16 dogs (84%), anesthesia was induced with an opioid/benzodiazepine combination and maintained with a balanced technique by use of an opioid, a neuromuscular blocking agent, and isoflurane in oxygen. Dogs were cooled in an ice bath to a mean esophageal temperature of 27.8 +/- 1.4 C. Mean anesthesia time was 4.04 +/- 1.37 hours. Hypothermic-induced adverse effects, such as increased blood viscosity, increased myocardial irritability, and shivering, were managed by hemodilution, manipulation of acid-base balance, and administration of opioid and neuromuscular blocking agents. Complications requiring treatment included severe hypotension (74%), arrhythmias (47%), hypoxemia (42%), and acidemia (58%). Six dogs (32%) went into cardiac arrest and all were successfully resuscitated once the surgical procedure was completed. One dog was euthanatized during surgery, another died after surgery, and the 17 remaining dogs (90%) were discharged from the hospital to their owners. The technique appears beneficial in selected cases to decrease the morbidity and mortality associated with the risk of prolonged ischemia and life-threatening hemorrhage.",

Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl and propofol and maintained with isoflurane 1.3 MAC until incision and isoflurane 1.0 MAC in 70% nitrous oxide thereafter. Fentanyl was used for supplementation of anesthesia. During anesthesia, one of two 50-min tapes containing the test material was played to each patient on a portable cassette player.

    "27": "Chemical and toxicological investigations were carried out on blood and/or urine samples from 367 cases from the years 1980 to 1989 when there was a suspicion of driving under the influence of medication or drugs. During the investigation period no increase in the number of cases was found. This shows a clear discrepancy to the increasing misuse of medication and drugs an subsequently poses a substantial problem in traffic medicine. In 72% of the cases substances were found, which are capable of reducing the psychic and physical competence, most commonly benzodiazepines, barbiturates and opiates. In some cases these substances were present in overdose levels. The proportion of female road-users was 20% of the total. The age group between 20 and 29 was the most strongly represented rein both men and women.", 
    "28": "A drug discrimination based upon the competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist 2-amino-4,5-(1,2-cyclohexyl)-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid (NPC 12626) was assessed for pharmacological specificity. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate 20 mg/kg i.p. of NPC 12626 from saline under a standard two-lever fixed ratio 32 schedule of food reinforcement. Stimulus generalization tests were conducted to examine the similarities and differences between NPC 12626, its active (2R,4R,5S) enantiomer NPC 17742, other competitive and noncompetitive NMDA antagonists and a number of drugs representative of other classes. During test sessions, the competitive NMDA antagonists NPC 12626, CGS 19755, [1-(cis-2-carboxypiperidine-4-yl)- methyl-1-phosphonic acid], NPC 17742, CSP 37849 [DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pen-tenoic acid] and CPPene [D-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-1-propenyl-1-phosphonic acid] all completely substituted for the training dose of NPC 12626 with ED50 values of 18.1, 2.3, 2.1, 0.8 and 0.8 mg/kg, respectively. In contrast, drugs that failed to substitute for NPC 12626 included (+)-amphetamine, baclofen, chlorpromazine, dextromethorphan, diazepam, dizocilpine (MK-801), imipramine, (-)-ketocyclazocine, L-N6-phenylisopropyladenosine, methocarbamol, morphine, muscimol, phenytoin, physostigmine and valproate. These results provide evidence that the NPC 12626 discriminative stimulus is unique and specific, shared fully only by its active enantiomer NPC 17742 and other competitive NMDA antagonists. This specificity provides further support for the hypothesis of NMDA receptor mediation of NPC 12626 discrimination, and suggests that this is a useful model to evaluate behavioral effects of competitive NMDA antagonists.", 
    "29": "In this study we investigated the effects of antimuscarinics with different selectivity on the intestinal migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) in five fasting, conscious dogs, chronically fitted with electrodes along the small bowel. Furthermore, we evaluated the chronotropic and mydriatic effects to assess the in vivo selectivity of the agents tested. Dose-response studies were performed with the following drugs administered i.v.: atropine, telenzepine (M1 antagonist), AF-DX 116 [11,2-(diethylamino)methyl-1-piperidinyl-acetyl-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido-2 ,3b- 1,4-benzodiazepine-6-one (M2 antagonist)] and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N- methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) (M3 antagonist). All the antimuscarinics tested dose-dependently increased the duration of the MMC period and inhibited spike activity, except low-dose telenzepine (3-10 nmol/kg), which shortened the MMC period and stimulated spike activity. High-dose telenzepine (> 100 nmol/kg) mimicked the inhibitory effect of atropine on the intestine. ED50 values for delay of MMC onset were 87,232, > 10,000 and 129 nmol/kg for atropine, telenzepine, AF-DX 116 and 4-DAMP, respectively. At doses lengthening the MMC period, atropine and 4-DAMP also induced tachycardia and mydriasis. At doses shortening the MMC period, telenzepine had no effect on pupil diameter or heart rate, except at the dose of 10 nmol/kg, which reduced heart rate. Finally, AF-DX 116, at doses inducing marked tachycardia, had a minor intestinal effect and no mydriatic effect. The present data are consistent with the hypothesis that both M1 and M3 receptors are involved in the regulation of the MMC: M1 receptors are probably located on an inhibitory pathway, whereas M3 receptors mediate excitatory stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "30": "1,1,1-Trichloroethane (TCE), a widely used and abused solvent, was investigated for its ability to produce physical dependence in mice. Cessation of 4 days of continuous inhalation of TCE (500-4000 ppm) resulted in a withdrawal syndrome characterized by handling-induced convulsions and increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions. The severity of withdrawal convulsions was diminished by 30 to 60 min of reexposure to 2000 to 4000 ppm TCE or to the vapor of another widely used and abused solvent, toluene (1000-2000 ppm). Ethanol (1-2 g/kg), midazolam (0.3-1 mg/kg) and pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) were also effective in decreasing the withdrawal severity; however, chlorpromazine (3 mg/kg) and phenytoin (30 mg/kg) were without effects. These data suggest that TCE has the ability to produce physical dependence of the central nervous system depressant drug type. Taken together with other evidence for similarities in the pharmacological and behavioral effects of TCE and depressant drugs of abuse, these data support the hypothesis that the basis for TCE abuse may be its ability to produce ethanol- and depressant drug-like effects.", 
    "31": "Muscarinic cholinergic receptor function in rat brain cortex was characterized by performing binding assays with [3H](-)quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) in parallel with assays of phospholipase C (PLC) activation by carbachol using membrane preparations and exogenous [3H]-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([3H]PIP2). Competitive binding studies revealed high- and low-affinity binding sites for the receptor antagonists, pirenzepine, methoctramine and the p-fluoro analog of hexahydro-sila-difenidol (p-F-HHSiD). Carbachol-stimulated [3H]-phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate breakdown was specifically inhibited by pirenzepine and p-F-HHiSD. The inhibition curves for these antagonists were best described by interactions at two sites. There was quantitative agreement between the antagonist affinity constants and the proportion of high- and low-affinity sites derived in functional and binding studies. The characteristics of the putative subtypes of muscarinic receptors and their stimulation of phospholipase C was examined after treatment with two alkylating agents, N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline and propylbenzilylcholine mustard. Loss of receptors was closely correlated with loss of PLC activation by carbachol, without alteration of the EC50 value (21 microM) of this agonist, clearly demonstrating a lack of receptor reserve. When both alkylating treatments were adjusted to induce a decrease of 60% in the maximal number of [3H]QNB binding sites, a similar (60%) reduction in the maximal effect of carbachol on PLC activation was found. However, the characteristics of the remaining receptors after the treatment with the two alkylating agents differ markedly as determined by competition of pirenzepine, p-F-HHSiD and methoctramine for [3H]QNB binding, and for inhibition of carbachol-stimulated phospholipase C by pirenzepine and p-F-HHSiD.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "33": "Repeated assessments of psychopathology, together with personality status, were made over two years on 181 psychiatric out-patients with generalised anxiety disorder (59), panic disorder (66), or dysthymic disorder (56) diagnosed using an interview schedule for DSM-III. Patients were randomly allocated to drug treatment, cognitive and behaviour therapy, or a self-help treatment programme. Although there were no overall differences in compliance rate and efficacy between the three modes of treatment, the psychological treatment methods, particularly self-help, were more effective in patients without personality disorder, and those with personality disorder responded better to drug treatment, primarily antidepressants. The findings suggest that assessment of personality status could be a valuable aid to selection of treatment in neurotic disorders and that self-help approaches are particularly valuable once personality disorder has been excluded.",

Glucose 20 mmol litre-1 with the addition of noradrenaline 10 mumol litre-1 was used as a control. In contrast with noradrenaline, midazolam did not inhibit glucose-induced insulin secretion. Noradrenaline 10 mumol litre-1 inhibited secretion to basal values in response to glucose 20 mmol litre-1 (P < 0.001).",

I.v. injections of midazolam 0.075 and 0.15 mg kg-1 decreased striatal dopamine concentrations in a dose-dependent manner without affecting the concentrations of DOPAC and HVA. Flunitrazepam 0.015 and 0.03 mg kg-1 also decreased striatal dopamine concentrations in a dose-related manner, but the reductions in DOPAC and HVA were not significant. Flumazenil 6 micrograms kg-1 alone did not affect striatal concentrations of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, but it prevented the effects of midazolam and flunitrazepam. Flunitrazepam 10 mumol litre-1 also decreased striatal dopamine release when infused through a dialysis probe placed into the striatum, but it failed to affect striatal dopamine release when infused into the ipsilateral substantia nigra. Central administrations of midazolam were effective only when the drug was infused into both sites simultaneously (10 and 100 mumol litre-1) or given by intraventricular injection (0.5 and 1 micrograms). These results suggest that midazolam and flunitrazepam affect striatal dopamine release in a different manner.",

Upper airway reflex sensitivity (UARS) was assessed using small concentrations of ammonia vapour as a stimulus to upper airway receptors. A threshold concentration of ammonia, at which reflex glottic closure occurred in response to the ammonia stimulus, was used as a measure of UARS. With diazepam, there was significant depression of UARS from 30 to 150 min after administration.",

    "39": "Anxiety in older patients is more often a symptom of an underlying mental or physical disorder than a primary diagnosis. Its various forms include situational anxiety, adjustment disorder, and phobias. A search for underlying organic causes is important, as age-related diseases, drug side effects, and substance abuse/withdrawal may have etiologic significance. Anxiety may also mask primary psychiatric disorders such as depression or delirium. Therapy requires treating any underlying psychiatric illness and seeking psychosocial intervention for functional causes. If medical therapy is indicated, short-acting benzodiazepines are the first choice, but patients should be followed closely for possible side effects.", 
    "40": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the clinical effects, safety, and economic cost of propofol and midazolam in the sedation of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Eighty-eight critically ill patients were studied and randomly allocated to receive short-term (less than 24 h), medium-term (24 h to 7 days), and prolonged (more than 7 days) continuous sedation with propofol (n = 46) or midazolam (n = 42). Mean doses required were 2.36 mg/kg/h for propofol and 0.17 mg/kg/h for midazolam. Patients in the group receiving propofol showed a percentage of hours of sedation at the desired level (grade 2, 3, 4, or 5 on the Ramsay scale) of 93 percent, compared with 82 percent (p < 0.05) in the group receiving midazolam. Both agents were considered safe with respect to the induction of adverse reactions during their use in prolonged sedation. Recovery after interrupting sedation was significantly faster in patients treated with propofol than in those sedated with midazolam (p < 0.05). Recovery of total consciousness was predictable according to sedation time in propofol-treated subgroups (r = 0.98, 0.88, and 0.92, respectively), while this correlation was not observed in the midazolam-treated group. In the subgroup with sedation of less than 24 h, propofol provided a cost savings of approximately 2,000 pesetas (pts) per patient, due to shorter stays in the ICU. We conclude that propofol is a sedative agent with the same safety, higher clinical effectiveness, and a better cost-benefit ratio than midazolam in the continuous sedation of critically ill patients.", 
    "41": "Control of hemodynamic parameters during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a desirable goal of the anesthesiologist. Diazepam is known to reduce systemic vascular resistance (SVR) during CPB. This study tested the hypothesis that diazepam reduces SVR during CPB through the action of its vehicle, alcohol-propylene glycol (APG). The study protocol was approved by the Institution's Human Experimentation Review Board and all patients gave informed consent. Premedication, induction, and maintenance of anesthesia were standardized. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing nonemergent cardiac surgical procedures were randomized to receive a standardized amount of diazepam, diazemuls, or alcohol-propylene glycol during stable CPB. SVR in the diazepam group decreased significantly (1,242 to 968 dyne.s.cm-5, P < 0.05) compared to baseline; whereas there was no significant change in SVR in the diazemul group, and a statistically significant increase in SVR (1,217 to 1,537 dyne.s.cm-5, P < 0.05) in the APG group. It is concluded that diazepam reduces SVR during CPB. Diazepam's vehicle does not reduce SVR during CPB, and is in fact associated with an increase in SVR.", 
    "42": "The effect of intravenous midazolam on the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP's) elicited from median nerve stimulation was investigated in a study on 20 volunteers. SEP's were recorded from contralateral scalp before and at 5, 30, and 60 min after drug administration. Relative amplitudes of the early components (N18-N20) were essentially stable, while relative amplitudes of the late components (N50-P90, P90-N160, N160-P250 and P250-N380) were reduced significantly after midazolam administration and had not returned to baseline 60 min after administration. Given the correlation between late SEP amplitude and subjective reports of experimental pain, the data support the possibility that administration of midazolam in conscious sedation doses may have some effect on pain in addition to its better documented sedative and amnesic properties.",

We report that, when added to the previously fielded treatment regimen (pyridostigmine, atropine, and pralidoxime chloride), diazepam significantly protects the performance of rhesus monkeys trained in an equilibrium task, the Primate Equilibrium Platform (PEP), against deficits induced by the nerve-agent soman. If administered soon enough to minimize the occurrence of convulsions, diazepam should increase the probability of mission accomplishment and eventual complete recovery from nerve agent poisoning.

    "44": "The effects of fluid percussion trauma on brain interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels have been studied. In the cortex and hippocampus of control and sham-operated rats, the levels of these cytokines were very low (below 4 units/mg protein) and constant. IL-6 and IL-1 levels in the ipsilateral cortex increased rapidly following trauma to reach a maximum of 350 and 16 units/mg protein, respectively, 8 h after the lesion, remained elevated until 18 h and decreased thereafter to basal values. TNF-alpha levels were maximally elevated (12 units/mg protein) at 3 h and 8 h and returned to basal values by 18 h. Qualitatively similar changes, but with 25-80-fold smaller amplitude, were seen in the contralateral cortex and in the ipsi- and contralateral hippocampus. The levels of IL-6 in the plasma of sham-operated and lesioned rats were only slightly elevated, whereas IL-1 and TNF-alpha were undetectable. Histological studies of brain tissue at early stages after trauma demonstrated an acute hemorrhage associated with neutrophil invasion. The administration of Ro5 4864 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a specific ligand of p (peripheral-type benzodiazepine) binding sites, did not result in any significant effect on the levels of IL-6, IL-1 or TNF-alpha in the brain of control or sham-operated animals. However, when administered 24 h before or 15 min after trauma, this benzodiazepine enhanced the increase of these cytokines by 2-4-fold in the ipsilateral cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "45": "Muscarinic receptors play important roles in the regulation of glandular secretion and vasomotor tone in human nasal mucosa. M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes were pharmacologically characterized in human inferior turbinates by receptor-binding assays using [3H](-)quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB, identifies total muscarinic receptors) and [3H]-pirenzepine (PZ). Receptors were localized by autoradiography, and their function examined in vitro by assaying mucus secretion from cultured nasal mucosal explants. In competition assays, PZ was employed as a selective muscarinic antagonist for M1 receptors, gallamine and AF-DX 116 for M2 receptors, and 4-DAMP for M3 receptors. These ligands are selective at low nanomolar concentrations, but can interact with other muscarinic receptors at higher concentrations. It is not known if they can interact with putative M4 and M5 muscarinic receptor subtypes. Using [3H](-)QNB, total muscarinic receptor binding was 688.4 +/- 49.6 fmol/mg protein (Bmax), with a Kd of 1.47 +/- 0.13 nM. [3H]-PZ bound to 45% of the total QNB binding sites. In competition experiments, 4-DAMP displaced [3H](-)QNB with the lowest IC50, followed by PZ and AF-DX 116. Autoradiograms demonstrated that [3H](-)QNB binding was completely displaced by 4-DAMP, partially displaced by PZ, but not displaced by gallamine or AF-DX 116, and suggested that M1 and M3 subtypes coexist in submucosal glands. The localization of M1 receptors on submucosal glands was confirmed by direct labeling with [3H]-PZ. [3H]-PZ also labeled vessels, but with a low silver grain density. Autoradiographic [3H]-QNB binding was displaced by 4-DAMP and atropine, but not by PZ, gallamine, or AF-DX 116. In studies of mucus secretion in vitro, 4-DAMP significantly inhibited methacholine-induced secretion. Although less effective, PZ also had significant inhibitory effects. Neither gallamine nor AF-DX 116 had any inhibitory effect. M1 receptors (PZ binding sites) may regulate glandular secretion while M3 receptors (4-DAMP binding sites) may regulate glandular secretion and vasomotor tone in human nasal mucosa.",

Increases in heart rate, arterial pressure, tidal volume, respiratory rate, PaCO2, minute ventilation, and base deficit occurred in all piglets during seizures as compared with baseline. Five minutes after bicuculline was administered, increases in minute ventilation (4.5 +/- 0.4 L/min at baseline to 13 +/- 2.1 L/min) were accounted for by increases in both tidal volume and respiratory rate. More abrupt decreases in respiratory rate were observed in anticonvulsant-treated piglets as compared with controls.

In this study the Swedish Diagnosis and Therapy Survey was used in order to analyze high-quantity prescriptions of benzodiazepines. The total amount of benzodiazepines prescribed--measured as defined daily doses (DDD)--was calculated for each visit. Prescriptions with quantities equal to or greater than the 90th percentile applied on the distribution of prescribed DDD per visit were defined as high-quantity prescriptions. Using this definition, prescriptions on 200 DDD or more--14.9% of all--were classified as high-quantity prescriptions. In the analysis the proportions of high-quantity prescription in different subgroups were compared. The study showed that there was a strong relationship between age of the patient and high-quantity prescriptions while the sex of the patient was of minor importance. Doctors specializing in internal medicine and psychiatrists prescribed high-quantity prescriptions to a greater extent than other doctors but differences with regard to the doctor's ages were small. Patients with sleeping disturbances obtained high-quantity prescriptions to a greater extent than other patients while patients with nervous problems obtained fewer. Patients with new prescriptions on benzodiazepines obtained high-quantity prescriptions to a lesser extent than patients making repeat visits. In addition the study showed that it was not as common with high-quantity prescriptions in the three major cities and in the most sparsely populated communities as in mid-sized communities.",

The first study demonstrated that 0.25 mg of triazolam in combination with nitrous oxide provides therapeutic effects but with a more rapid recovery than a 0.50 mg dose in combination with nitrous oxide. In the second study, triazolam produced a significant anxiolytic effect that was comparable to the effects of diazepam titrated to the usual clinical endpoint (mean dose = 19.3 mg). Less impairment in cognitive-psychomotor impairment and ambulatory function was seen after triazolam in comparison with diazepam. Triazolam appears to be a safe, effective alternative to parenteral sedation with a benzodiazepine for dental outpatients.", 
    "60": "The \"antimuscarinic effect\" of fentanyl and its dependence on subtypes of receptors were characterized in isolated porcine coronary arteries. Left anterior descending coronary arteries were dissected from the hearts of 60 adult pigs obtained at a slaughterhouse and prepared for isometric tension studies. The effects of fentanyl on the cumulative concentration-response curve for acetylcholine were obtained in the presence and absence of muscarinic blockade by atropine. Fentanyl shifted the concentration-response curve to the right in a concentration-dependent fashion. Atropine shifted the concentration-response curve to the right, and no further shift was caused by fentanyl. To investigate the dependence on muscarinic receptor subtypes, the effect of fentanyl on acetylcholine-induced contraction was examined in the presence of specific M1-, M2-, and M3-muscarinic antagonists. The pA2 values for fentanyl decreased significantly in the presence of atropine (a nonspecific antagonist) and also in the presence of p-F-HHSiD (an M3-antagonist). In contrast, no significant change of pA2 value for fentanyl was observed in the presence of both pirenzepine (an M1-antagonist) and methoctramine (an M2-antagonist). We conclude that fentanyl has an antimuscarinic effect, and that this antagonism occurs in a competitive manner. Furthermore, the significant decrease of the pA2 value for fentanyl in the presence of M3-, but not in the presence of M1 + M2-antagonists, suggests that the attenuation of cholinergic contraction of porcine coronary arteries by fentanyl is mediated through the M3-muscarinic receptor subtype.", 
    "61": "Children hospitalized in a pediatric intensive care unit are frequently distressed. The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of use of sedative agents in pediatric critical care patients. A questionnaire survey was mailed to 45 directors of Pediatric Critical Care Fellowship Training Programs listed in Critical Care Medicine, January 1989. The response rate was 75.6% (34 questionnaires). The most commonly identified goals of sedation were reduced patient discomfort or distress and fewer unplanned extubations. The agents most frequently employed for this purpose were opioids (morphine or fentanyl), chloral hydrate, or benzodiazepines. Although conventional doses are used, opioids and benzodiazepines are often given hourly or by continuous infusion. Satisfaction with the efficacy and safety of commonly used opioids was greater (most common response \"very satisfied\") than for the benzodiazepines (\"somewhat satisfied\"). The physician's or nurse's clinical impression was reported to be the \"most important\" criterion for deciding when a patient required a dose of sedative; objective criteria were selected as less important. The majority of patients (65.7%) in the surveyed units were ideally \"sedated to the point of no distress with as-needed medication.\" The majority of respondents (76.4%) identified efficacy as the major problem with sedation. Drug withdrawal was considered to be the major problem with sedative use by only a minority of respondents (6.9%). Although withdrawal is seen in 61.8% of units, it is generally treated when recognized, rather than prevented by routine tapering of sedation. Optimal sedation of pediatric intensive care unit patients is considered problematic, despite the use of frequent doses of many sedatives. Systematic investigation of pharmacodynamic response to these agents in the pediatric critical care population is indicated.",

A severe form of hypersensitivity vasculitis, with extensive visceral involvement and poor prognosis, has been encountered very rarely following phenytoin and in isolated cases following carbamazepine and trimethadione administration. Drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus is much more frequent, with distinct clinical and laboratory abnormalities. The syndrome was described following treatment with most anticonvulsants in clinical use--phenytoin, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, trimethadione, primidone, and valproate, but not phenobarbital or benzodiazepines. The early recognition of these syndromes as being related to drugs is important, because they usually remit upon withdrawal of the offending agent.", 
    "67": "Benzodiazepine (BZP) hypnotics are now classified into four groups according to their plasma elimination rates: ultrashort-, short-, intermediate-, and long-acting drugs. Since the specific binding affinities for the BZP receptor vary widely among the BZPs and their active metabolites, it may be more reasonable to correlate their pharmacological activities with the BZP receptor occupancy rather than with their plasma concentrations. The time courses of total plasma concentrations of BZPs and their active metabolites after a single oral administration were obtained from the literature, and their unbound concentrations (Cu) were calculated from the reported values of their plasma unbound fractions. The data of the receptor binding affinities of the BZPs, reported as dissociation constants (Kd) determined by in vitro binding experiments, were also obtained from the literature. Using these values, the time courses of receptor occupancies [Cu/(Kd + Cu) x 100%] were calculated for the various BZPs. A mutual competitive inhibition was considered in the case of the drugs that had active metabolites. Although plasma total and unbound concentration time profiles of the BZPs showed a wide variation, similar patterns were obtained for the time courses of the receptor occupancy among the BZPs in each group, indicating that the BZP hypnotics can be classified more conveniently based on receptor occupancy theory.",

MK 801 (0.025-0.1 mg/kg) produced anxiolytic effect at all the doses in rats. Effect was potentiated by diazepam in rats. Both, FG-7142 and Ro 15-1788 reversed the effects of MK 801 and diazepam, when these agents were concomitantly administered.

Compounds bearing a protic group on the aromatic system of the side chain show a pharmacological profile of inverse agonist, while the products lacking this group behave as partial agonist. We now report the affinity data at the BzR of new compounds in which the distance between the phenyl ring and the amide group of the side chain has been changed. The benzylamine derivatives showed a good affinity at the BzR, generally higher than that of the phenylethylamine derivatives. In this series the pharmacological profile showed to be opposite to that of the corresponding phenylethylamine derivatives, since the compounds substituted with protic groups on the phenyl ring behaved as partial agonists.

    "72": "The GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor is the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor in the mammalian brain and is assembled from sequence-related subunits, such as alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2. In contrast to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors, alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors fail to exhibit high-affinity binding of allosteric positive modulators of GABA-activated chloride currents. The critical determinant responsible for this difference in ligand binding was previously traced to a position in the extracellular domain of the two alpha subunits (alpha 1 His100 and alpha 6 Arg 101). We now show by patch clamp analysis that this amino acid exchange also determines the diazepam potentiation. Thus, alpha 1(Arg101)beta 2 gamma 2 receptors do not, but alpha 6(His100)beta 2 gamma 2 receptors do exhibit diazepam potentiation. However, the same extracellular determinant is not responsible for the increased GABA sensitivity of alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors relative to alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors as revealed by electrophysiological analysis and by differential GABA sensitivity of [35S]TBPS binding.",

The concentrations of this compound needed to inhibit specific [3H]muscimol binding, specific [3H]diazepam binding, and specific [3H]strychnine binding were greater than those of imipenem, as demonstrated by the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50S of LJC 10,627, greater than 10 mM for each; IC50S of imipenem, 0.6, 1.9, and 0.2 mM, respectively). These results reflect the fact that LJC 10,627 does not evoke severe convulsions or cause death, even when it is administered intraventricularly at a high dose (300 micrograms per rat), and suggest that the low neurotoxic potential of LJC 10,627 may be attributed to the chemical structure of this compound, which has a methyl radical at the 1 beta site and a triazolium radical at the side chain of the second site.", 
    "74": "Brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems have long been associated with the behavioral actions of ethanol. This study investigated the effects of GABAergic agents on ethanol reinforcement. Rats were trained to orally self-administer ethanol in a 30-min, free-choice operant task. Responses at one of two levers produced contingent access to ethanol (10% w/v) or water. Pretreatment with RO 15-4513, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist (0.375 to 3.0 mg/kg ip), selectively reduced responses for ethanol, and a higher dose of RO 15-4513 (6.0 mg/kg) reduced both ethanol and water responses. Self-administration of saccharin in a free-choice task with access to saccharin (0.05%) and water was unaffected by RO 15-4513, suggesting that the effects of RO 15-4513 on ethanol reinforcement may not necessarily generalize to other reinforcers. Isopropylbicyclophosphate (IPPO), a picrotoxin ligand (5 and 10 micrograms/kg ip), selectively reduced responses for ethanol in alcohol-preferring, nonpreferring and Wistar rats. However, the highest dose of IPPO (20 micrograms/kg) reduced both ethanol and water responses. Chlordiazepoxide, a benzodiazepine, did not reduce responses for ethanol in the selectively bred animals, suggesting that this drug does not substitute for the reinforcing properties associated with acute ethanol intake. Together, these results suggest that compounds that act at the benzodiazepine inverse agonist and picrotoxin sites of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex may decrease motivated responding for ethanol.", 
    "75": "The effects of benzodiazepine inverse agonists on the long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices of the guinea pig were examined using an extracellular recording technique. Benzodiazepine inverse agonists, beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE), 2-phenylpyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS-8216) and 2-[5-methylthien-3-yl]-2,5-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3-one (S-135), augmented the magnitude of long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation of input fibers in both the CA1 and the CA3 regions. beta-Carboline-3-carboxylate was more effective in augmenting long-term potentiation in CA1 than in CA3. Augmentation of long-term potentiation produced by beta-CCE was antagonized by concomitant application of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Therefore, the enhancing action of benzodiazepine inverse agonists on long-term potentiation, which is suggested to be a specific action, mediated by the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, might help to explain the mechanism of the memory-enhancing effects of benzodiazepine inverse agonists, observed in some in vivo behavioral paradigms.", 
    "76": "Benzodiazepines and naltrexone administered before inescapable shock block behavioral consequences of the inescapable shock such as poor shuttle box escape, reduced activity in reaction to shock, reduced social interaction, and so on. Anxiogenic beta-carboline derivatives such as FG-7142 can produce these effects by themselves. In the present study, neither diazepam nor naltrexone had any effect on the interference with Y-maze choice escape accuracy produced by inescapable shock even though they both eliminated the reduction in Y-maze escape response speed produced by inescapable shock. Analogously, FG-1742 did not lead to a reduction in Y-maze choice escape response accuracy even though it did slow escape responding. These data imply that inescapable shock interferes with escape choice learning and escape response speed by different mechanisms, the former not involving fear-anxiety processes.", 
    "77": "The geniculo-hypothalamic tract (GHT) provides input to the mammalian circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Several recent reports indicate that GHT ablation blocks phase shifts to the benzodiazepines triazolam and chlordiazepoxide at circadian times (CTs) 6 and 21. In this study we tested if GHT ablation blocks phase shifts to chlordiazepoxide at a wide range of circadian phases. Syrian hamsters were housed under constant dim light, and running-wheel activity rhythms were monitored. Intraperitoneal injections of either chlordiazepoxide (100 mg/kg) or saline were administered at various circadian times, and a phase-response curve was constructed. In intact animals, chlordiazepoxide produced phase-advance shifts at CTs 0, 4, 6, and 8, and phase-delay shifts between CTs 12-14. Although bursts of increased activity were sometimes observed on the day of injection, activity does not appear to mediate chlordiazepoxide-induced phase shifts. Hamsters with > 45% GHT ablation showed no phase shifts > 20 min to chlordiazepoxide. Our results indicate that the geniculo-hypothalamic tract is necessary for the phase-shifting effects of the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide throughout the circadian cycle.", 
    "78": "Prenatal administration of the anxiolytic drug diazepam (DZP), 2.5 mg/kg) to the pregnant rat over gestational days 14-20 altered function and stressor-induced responsiveness of the GABAA receptor in the cerebral cortex of exposed animals as adults. In Experiment 1, the impact of 15 min of restraint on chloride-facilitated benzodiazepine binding was evaluated in male and female rats at 70-90 days of age. Early exposure to DZP led to an enhanced potency of chloride on binding in both males and females. In Experiment 2, GABA stimulation of 36chloride uptake was measured in male rats at 35 or 70 days of age following 10 min of forced swimming at ambient temperature. In control animals, stressor-induced changes in receptor function were not evident until 70 days, and in DZP-exposed rats the stressor had no effect on receptor function at either age. These changes in GABAA receptor responsiveness induced by early exposure to DZP may underlie the disrupted behavioral responses to environmental challenge that have been previously reported.", 
    "79": "Fluorescence image analysis of the calcium sensitive dye Indo-1 was used to characterize platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced calcium mobilization in hepatic macrophages and endothelial cells. PAF, but not lyso-PAF, an inactive analog, induced a rapid and transient increase in intracellular levels of calcium that appeared to depend on the presence of extracellular calcium. In both macrophages and endothelial cells, these effects were dose dependent, reaching maximal levels with 10 nM PAF. However, the kinetics of the calcium response to PAF in macrophages and endothelial cells was distinct. The endothelial cells responded more rapidly to PAF than the macrophages (within 1 min vs. 2-3 min, respectively) and displayed longer recovery periods (4 min vs. > 10 min, respectively). In contrast, the magnitude of the response to PAF was greater in the macrophages. In both cell types, triazolam and alprazolam, two PAF antagonists, and the calcium channel blocker verapamil inhibited PAF-induced calcium mobilization. PAF also stimulated superoxide anion production alone and in combination with the macrophage activator 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in both cell types. Macrophages produced more of this reactive oxygen intermediate in response to PAF and TPA than endothelial cells. Interestingly, in the absence of extracellular calcium or when verapamil was added to the cultures, superoxide anion production by the macrophages, but not the endothelial cells, was significantly reduced. These results demonstrate that, although hepatic macrophages and endothelial cells mobilize calcium in response to PAF, the characteristics of the response in each cell type are different. These differences may underlie, at least in part, distinct functional responses of the cells to PAF.", 
    "80": "The modulation of 35S-t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (35S-TBPS) binding by in vitro addition of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), diazepam, pentobarbital, etomidate and etazolate was studied in the presence of KCl (100 mM) in the cerebellum and in the cortex of C57Bl mice. In the cortex, all of the depressant drugs caused a biphasic effect (stimulation followed by inhibition) on 35S-TBPS binding, whereas in the cerebellum only inhibition was observed. Saturation analysis revealed that the enhancement of 35S-TBPS binding was due to an increase in the affinity of 35S-TBPS for its binding sites. The introduction of a GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (10 microM), into assay media altered the effects of the depressants, except for those of diazepam, on 35S-TBPS binding in a complex manner. Our results indicate that bicuculline, in addition to its GABAA receptor blocking properties, also influenced the binding of 35S-TBPS through some other, as yet unknown, mechanism(s). Thus, bicuculline not only produced a rightward shift of the dose-response curves of the central depressant drugs in the cortex, but also increased the maximal stimulation of 35S-TBPS binding. Furthermore, in the cerebellum, the previously observed drug-induced inhibition of 35S-TBPS binding was replaced by stimulation followed by inhibition in the presence of bicuculline. Finally, it was found that the in vitro addition of bicuculline had no effect on the diazepam-induced stimulation of 35S-TBPS binding. It is suggested that the regional differences in the modulation of 35S-TBPS binding in various brain structures may be due to endogenous differences in the molecular composition of GABAA receptors in various brain areas.", 
    "81": "Alprazolam (APZ) is a benzodiazepine with unique antidepressant activity for a drug of its class. There is some evidence of inhibition of the unstimulated hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis by APZ which may be important in its therapeutic action, and could be detrimental in APZ-treated subjects who encounter stressful stimuli. To assess the effect of APZ on stimulated ACTH and cortisol secretion, we studied 14 normal subjects in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. APZ or placebo capsule was administered orally in doses of 0.5 mg and 2 mg, 90 min before either naloxone, 125 micrograms/kg body weight i.v. bolus dose, a known stimulator of ACTH and cortisol release, or placebo. After naloxone stimulation, the area under the plasma ACTH/time curves was significantly reduced by APZ, in both the 2 mg (P < 0.0005) and 0.5 mg (P < 0.005) doses, compared to their respective placebo studies; similar reductions in area under the plasma cortisol/time curves occurred after 2 mg (P < 0.00002) and 0.5 mg (P < 0.0005) APZ doses. We conclude that APZ is a potent inhibitor of naloxone-stimulated ACTH and cortisol release in humans. Since APZ has been shown to inhibit CRH release in vitro, and naloxone-induced ACTH secretion is likely to be caused through CRH release, this suggests that APZ inhibition of naloxone action is via the parvocellular CRH neurons of the paraventricular nucleus and/or central neurotransmitter pathways impinging directly or indirectly on these CRH neurons. Thus APZ may exert at least some of its clinical effects through inhibition of central CRH release. APZ treatment could lead to a relative hyporesponse of the pituitary-adrenal axis during stress. APZ may be an important tool for manipulation of hypothalamic CRH release in studies of pituitary-adrenal function.", 
    "82": "We studied the effect of pertussis toxin (PT) and partial muscarinic antagonism using pirenzepine (PIR) on beta-adrenergic relaxation of muscarinic contraction in 188 tracheal smooth muscle (TSM) preparations from 25 dogs in vitro. Strips of TSM were incubated for 4 h at 37 degrees C in Krebs-Henseleit (K-H) perfusate with or without 10 micrograms/ml of PT. In tissues contracted to target tension (TT; 50% of maximal response to 127 mM potassium-substituted K-H [KCl]) with acetylcholine (ACh), pretreatment with PT decreased the concentration of isoproterenol (ISO) causing 30% relaxation from TT (RC30) from 1.3 +/- 0.8 x 10(-7) M (control) to 2.8 +/- 0.7 x 10(-8) M (p = 0.013). Pretreatment with PT also augmented the maximal relaxation elicited by 10(-5) M ISO. In separate studies, strips of TSM were contracted with ACh; pretreatment with 10(-7) M PIR decreased the concentration of ISO causing 50% relaxation (RC50) from 3.4 +/- 0.6 x 10(-7) to 9.6 +/- 1.5 x 10(-8) M (p = 0.042). Pretreatment with PIR did not affect relaxation elicited by ISO for strips contracted equivalently with KCl. In addition, PIR increased both the potency and efficacy of ISO in relaxing muscarinic contraction in sham-incubated strips of TSM but had no effect after incubation with PT. Neither PT nor PIR affected beta-adrenergic relaxation of TSM contracted with KCl. Our data demonstrate that beta-adrenergic receptor relaxation of muscarinic contraction is augmented by (1) incubation with PT and (2) partial blockade of muscarinic receptors.", 
    "83": "Two forms of the multisubunit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor were expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injecting mRNA encoding the bovine GABAA receptor subunit cDNAs for alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L and alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L. The properties of these two combinations were examined by electrophysiological recording of GABA currents using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. The actions of several benzodiazepine site ligands were compared in terms of their affinity for and efficacy at these two subunit combinations. Flunitrazepam potentiated control GABA responses to a maximum of 77% with alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L and 105% with alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L, with EC50 values of 29 +/- 11 nM and 23 +/- 10 nM, respectively. Flunitrazepam also produced a greater shift to the left of the GABA concentration-response curve with alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L than with alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L. Concentration-response curves for the type I benzodiazepine receptor-preferring compounds zolpidem and CL218,872 showed a selectivity for the alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L receptor, with respective affinity ratios 7-fold and 17-fold higher, compared with alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L. The inverse agonist methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta- carboline-3-carboxylate produced a maximum inhibition of 30% with both receptor combinations and also had a higher affinity for alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L than alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L. For the first time CL218,872 and FG8205 were shown to be partial agonists of individual receptor combinations, compared with a full agonist such as flunitrazepam. The FG8205 concentration-response curve reached a maximum approximately 60% that of a full agonist with both alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L and alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L. CL218,872 reached a lower maximum efficacy with alpha 3 beta 1 gamma 2L (30%) than with alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L (51%), demonstrating not only that different compounds can have varying levels of partial agonist activity but also that the same compound can have differing degrees of efficacy at different receptor combinations.", 
    "84": "The effects of chemical modification of a disulfide bond(s) (-SS-) or sulfhydryl group(s) (-SH) on the [3H]-flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ) binding to membrane-bound or immunoprecipitated benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors (BZD-R) from bovine cerebral cortex were examined. Reduction of -SS- with dithiothreitol (DTT) brought about a reversible, time- and dose-dependent inhibition of [3H]FNZ binding to the membrane-bound BZD-R. Alkylation of the membranes with the -SH-modifying reagent iodoacetamide (IAA) or 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) produced a slight inhibition of [3H]FNZ binding in a dose-dependent manner. Scatchard analysis of saturation curves of [3H]FNZ binding in the presence and absence of 5 mM DTT revealed changes in affinity without modification in the maximal binding capacity, thus indicating a competitive mode of interaction. DTT pretreatment of both the membrane-bound and the immunoprecipitated BZD-R led to [3H]FNZ binding inhibition. Consistent with the modification of a binding site is the observation that reduction of -SS- does not bear on the binding affinity, but rather reduces the number of sites. Complete protection from DTT inhibition of [3H]FNZ binding by FNZ (an agonist) or by Ro 15-1788 (an antagonist) suggests the presence of -SS- at, or very close to, the BZD recognition binding site. No protection against IAA or DTNB inhibition was provided by FNZ. Photoaffinity labeling experiments with [3H]FNZ revealed a clear-cut band of 50 kDa in native and alkylated membranes but an extremely weak label in 5 mM DTT/IAA-treated membranes. The present results provide evidence for the participation of a disulfide bond in the recognition binding site of the bovine cerebral cortex BZD-R.",

    "86": "We reported a 25-year-old male with chronic thinner intoxication. He had been sniffing thinner from the age of 15 to 20. Since the age of 20, he developed gait disturbance, weakness of lower extremities, and scanning speech. At the age of 23, three years after he stopped sniffing thinner, he had hyperkin\u00e9sie volitionnelle (HV) of bilateral upper extremities. MRI study revealed diffuse high intensity areas in the cerebral white matter, thinning of the corpus callosum, and cerebellar and brainstem atrophy on T1 weighted images. On T2 weighted images, low intensity areas in the thalamus, the striatum, the anterior limb of the internal capsule, the tegmentum of midbrain, high intensity areas in middle cerebellar peduncle, the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the lateral part of the cerebral peduncle, and the cerebral white matter were noted. HV almost disappeared with 2.5 mg of clonazepam daily administered. The disappearance of HV by ischemic compression of his arm suggested that input from the periphery might be relevant to the etiology of HV. The time interval between exposure to thinner and the recognition of HV in our case was in agreement with that between the occurrence of cerebrovascular disease and the recognition of HV in the previous reports. We postulated that HV in this case was the manifestation of the denervation hypersensitivity in the dentatorubroolivary system.", 
    "87": "For the mass-screening of benzodiazepines in urine, radioimmunoassays (RIAs) for two benzophenones (metabolites of the drugs) were established, and an animal experiment was carried out to verify their usefulness. Immunogens were prepared by condensing 2-hemisuccinyl derivatives of 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone (A-CBP) or 2-amino-5-nitrobenzophenone (A-NBP) to bovine serum albumin (BSA). Antisera were produced in rabbits by immunization with the individual antigens. Two kinds of RIA were established separately for A-CBP and A-NBP using each antiserum, and their sensitivities were 150 pg/tube and 30 pg/tube, respectively. The antisera had broad cross-reactivity with many chlorbenzophenone and nitrobenzophenone derivatives, respectively. Diazepam or nitrazepam was administered to rats, and the total amounts of each in urine (benzodiazepines plus their metabolites such as benzophenones) were determined relative to time using the RIAs after acid hydrolysis of the specimen. The benzophenones were positive in urine even 9 h after administration, whereas diazepam was undetectable using a RIA against diazepam. The characterization of the antisera and the results of the animal experiments indicate that these RIAs will be very useful for mass-screening of benzodiazepines.", 
    "88": "The prevalence and correlates of benzodiazepine use and anxiolytic abuse and dependence are examined in a sample of 427 patients in Toronto, Canada, who met lifetime DSM-III criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence. The patients were evaluated with the NIMH-DIS and other standard psychiatric and substance abuse rating scales. Forty per cent were recent users of benzodiazepines and 20% had abused or been dependent upon anxiolytics, including benzodiazepines, during their lifetime. Patients with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) were at higher risk for an anxiolytic disorder as were women and the unemployed. Recent users of benzodiazepines showed more current psychological distress, depressive symptomatology and more severe substance abuse problems than other patients and were more likely to have a lifetime DSM-III anxiety disorder. Patients with anxiolytic disorders, even if ASPD was controlled for, showed more psychiatric impairment and drug abuse problems than the remaining patients. Of those with a positive urine screen, 46% did not report using benzodiazepines in the previous week. Nineteen per cent of the patients who did not report benzodiazepine use in the previous week had a positive urine screen and were more likely to be found in the detoxification unit.", 
    "89": "Findings. Specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding to \"neuronal\"-type sites was significantly lower in anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, somatomotor cortex, cerebellar cortex, and globus pallidus in small postmortem samples of schizophrenic brains than in non-schizophrenic controls. Four of these five brain regions were reported by others to exhibit atrophy and/or neuronal loss in schizophrenia.", 
    "90": "Selective loss of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in postmortem schizophrenic brains has been reported (11). Pyramidal neurons are known to be glutamatergic (14,26) and to exhibit high densities of benzodiazepine binding sites (25,31). Glutamatergic neurons are known to be abundant in most layers of the cerebral cortex, and most of these are pyramidal neurons (26). All layers of the cerebral cortex display high densities of benzodiazepine binding sites (24,25,31). The number of larger pyramidal cells is little affected in most layers of the anterior cingulate cortex, but the number of small neurons is significantly lower, particularly in layer II (10). Pyramidal neurons range in size from very large to very small, and many very small pyramidal cells are often counted, together with small \"stellate\" neurons, as \"granule\" cells (28). Further, non-pyramidal glutamatergic neurons are reportedly also found in cerebral cortex (26). Thus, it seems possible that the large reduction in [3H]flunitrazepam binding we find in anterior cingulate cortex reflects the selective loss of glutamatergic neurons. The hypothesis that selective loss of glutamatergic neurons form various brain regions is associated with major psychoses can be easily tested by immunohistochemical studies of these regions using glutamate- and GABA-specific antibodies.", 
    "91": "In the absence of a 3D structure of the target biomolecule, to propose the 3D requirements for a small molecule to exhibit a particular bioactivity, one must supply both a bioactive conformation and a superposition rule for every active compound. Our strategy identifies both simultaneously. We first generate and optimize all low-energy conformations by any suitable method. For each conformation we then use ALADDIN to calculate the location of points to be considered as part of the superposition. These points include atoms in the molecule and projections from the molecule to hydrogen-bond donors and acceptors or charged groups in the binding site. These positions and the relative energy of each conformation are the input to our new program DISCO. It uses a clique-detection method to find superpositions that contain at least one conformation of each molecule and user-specified numbers of point types and chirality. DISCO is fast; for example, it takes about 1 min CPU to propose pharmacophores from 21 conformations of seven molecules. We typically run DISCO several times to compare alternative pharmacophore maps. For D2 dopamine agonists DISCO shows that the newer 2-aminothiazoles fit the traditional pharmacophore. Using site points correctly identifies the bioactive enantiomers of indoles to compare with catechols whereas using only ligand points leads to selecting the inactive enantiomer for the pharmacophore map. In addition, DISCO reproduces pharmacophore maps of benzodiazepines in the literature and proposes subtle improvements. Our experience suggests that clique-detection methods will find many applications in computational chemistry and computer-assisted molecular design.", 
    "92": "The present study was performed to assess the anxiolytic activity of the novel anxiolytic SC-48274 in comparison with those of buspirone and diazepam. Drugs were administered p.o. The experimental anxiety models included gastric lesions of mice induced by socio-psychological stress in the communication box (CB) and the passive avoidance paradigm in rats. In the CB experiments, non-foot-shocked mice (responder) exposed to the emotional responses of foot-shocked mice (sender), 3 hr per day for 3 days, developed gastric lesions. Single treatments of diazepam (1, 2, 5 mg/kg) and SC-48274 (25, 50 mg/kg) prevented gastric lesion formation, but buspirone at 2.5-10 mg/kg did not. A 3-day treatment with SC-48274 at doses over 5 mg/kg prevented gastric lesions; and a 3-day treatment with buspirone at 2, 5 and 10 mg/kg prevented the lesions with a U-shaped dose-response. Diazepam also prevented gastric lesion formation at the doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg. In the passive avoidance response study, rats which had a single acquisition trial for 2 days were used. The step-down latency for rats to enter from the illuminated compartment to the dark one was recorded. Single treatments of SC-48274 (25 mg/kg), diazepam (5, 10 mg/kg) or buspirone (25 mg/kg) shortened the delayed latency. These results suggest that SC-48274 has anxiolytic activity of the same potency as buspirone and repeated-dose administration is needed to induce anxiolytic activity.", 
    "93": "The effects of three anxiolytics--gepirone, diazepam, and ethanol--on high-frequency ultrasonic vocalizations elicited from rats via a new method are described. Subjects confronted with an anesthetized, same-sex conspecific in a neutral test cage emitted ultrasonic vocalizations in the 35- to 70-kHz range. The great majority of these were calls with frequencies higher than 40 kHz; of these, short calls (< 50 ms) occurred significantly more frequently than long calls (> 50 ms). Female subjects emitted far more of these high-short and high-long vocalizations than males did. In females, but not males, these calls were reduced in number by gepirone, 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) agonist, at both 1.0- and 10.0-mg/kg doses and by diazepam, a benzodiazepine, at 3.0 but not 1.0 mg/kg. Ethanol (0.6 and 1.2 g/kg) had no detectable effect. The utility of this method, both for the study of ultrasounds and assessment of serotonergic anxiolytics, is discussed.", 
    "94": "Benzodiazepines are the most prescribed psychotropic drugs in the world. Comparative international data on benzodiazepine use, specifically among developed and developing countries, are unavailable. To determine the different patterns of benzodiazepine use in two representative countries, use of benzodiazepines in Chile (a developing country) and Canada (a developed country) was undertaken. Wholesale data as provided by the Intercontinental Medical statistics and drug import data were used as databases. Data on trends of benzodiazepine use was determined for 5 years using the methodology recommended by the WHO for drug use research, the defined daily dose/1000 inhabitants/day. Total benzodiazepine use was similar in both countries, but Canadian use had increased slowly. Patterns of use, however, differ widely among the two countries. A linear increase of rapidly eliminated benzodiazepines was observed in Canada, whereas the reverse occurs in Chile: the slowly eliminated benzodiazepines are the ones that have increased use. Hypnotic benzodiazepines are used twice as frequently in Canada than in Chile. Striking differences in the use of individual benzodiazepines are observed. Differences in healthcare systems determine wide differences in the way these drugs are prescribed. Demographic characteristics of the two countries also may account for the differences in benzodiazepine use. The authors conclude that, although total benzodiazepine consumption is similar in the two countries, patterns of benzodiazepine use vary widely. The different patterns of use may determine differences in the morbidity rates associated with the use of these drugs.", 
    "95": "These experiments tested the efficacy of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 antagonist ondansetron (OND) in reversing various aspects of benzodiazepine withdrawal in rats. Three tests were used in which the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was administered to rats receiving chronic administration of chlordiazepoxide. In one test, the elevated plus-maze, flumazenil produced a reduction in time spent in the open arms of the maze; OND completely reversed this effect of flumazenil in a dose-related fashion. However, OND failed to block the effects of the anxiogenic drug pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in the elevated plus-maze. In a second test, rats were trained to discriminate PTZ. After chlordiazepoxide, flumazenil substituted for PTZ; OND failed to block flumazenil. In a third test, rats maintained on a chronic base line of chlordiazepoxide were trained to discriminate flumazenil from vehicle. In this discrimination, PTZ substituted for flumazenil, and pentobarbital blocked the flumazenil stimulus; OND, however, failed to block the flumazenil stimulus. In a separate set of experiments, OND also failed to reverse the suppression of responding produced in a conditioned emotional response paradigm. Thus, some data from the elevated plus-maze are consistent with the hypothesis that benzodiazepine withdrawal shares common effects with other stimuli known to be anxiogenic, and that OND blocks this aspect of withdrawal. However, all other data are inconsistent with the hypotheses that OND is anxiolytic or has efficacy in reversing benzodiazepine withdrawal. We suggest that ondansetron is likely to have minimal efficacy in humans for the treatment of sedative-hypnotic withdrawal.",

Pyridostigmine 120 mg significantly augmented the GH response to GHRH in normal subjects. In diabetic subjects, pyridostigmine failed to increase GH response to GHRH compared to GHRH alone (mean GH: pyridostigmine vs control: 75.7 +/- 12.6 vs 38.9 +/- 5.4 mU/l, P = NS). GH responses to GHRH after pyridostigmine pretreatment in both normal and diabetic subjects did not differ and the GH response to GHRH after pyridostigmine in normal subjects did not differ from the GH response to GHRH alone in diabetic subjects. In normal subjects, GH pretreatment significantly reduced subsequent GH responsiveness to GHRH (delta peak GH 26.4 +/- 5.2 vs 7.7 +/- 5.4 mU/l, P < 0.04). In contrast, GH pretreatment did not cause any significant reduction in GH responsiveness to GHRH in diabetics (delta peak GH 53.6 +/- 9.7 vs 33.4 +/- 11 mU/l, P = NS). No significant correlation was demonstrated between measures of diabetic control and the responses to GHRH alone or after cholinergic modulation and GH pretreatment.", 
    "101": "These data suggest that ambient hypothalamic cholinergic tone in diabetes is high, and of similar degree to the enhanced cholinergic tone in normal subjects pretreated with pyridostigmine. We suggest that in diabetic subjects, the reduced responsiveness to autofeedback may be secondary to the enhanced cholinergic tone demonstrated in these patients. The mechanisms linking the uncontrolled diabetic state to this abnormal neuroregulation of GH remains unknown at present.", 
    "102": "Semi-purified diets supplemented with either a high linoleate (n-6) (safflower) oil or a high alpha-linolenate (n-3) (perilla) oil were fed to mouse mothers and their offspring through 6 weeks of age. The proportions of n-3 and n-6 highly unsaturated fatty acids in brain phospholipids reflected the n-3/n-6 balance of the diets while no difference was found in phospholipid compositions or cholesterol/phospholipid ratios. In the elevated plus maze task, the total number of entries into the open- and enclosed-arms was smaller and the time spent in the dark enclosed arms tended to be longer in the perilla group than the safflower group. The time required to reach a safe platform in Morris's water maze test was less in the perilla group, but no significant difference was observed in the entries into the arms darkened with a movable cover in Y-maze dark-preference task. The safflower group was more sensitive to pentobarbital; the anesthesia onset time was less and the anesthetic time was longer than in the perilla group. Increased locomotion induced by scopolamine injection was less in the safflower group as compared with the perilla group. These results indicate that in mice the dietary alpha-linolenate/linoleate balance affects the n-3/n-6 ratio of brain phospholipid acyl chains and that this is accompanied by general behavioral changes as well as changes in sensitivities to drugs known to affect behavior.", 
    "103": "Several studies examined in vivo and in vitro biologic activity of the human gallbladder in response to cholecystokinin (CCK). However, few studies have demonstrated directly the interaction of CCK with receptors on the human gallbladder, which is responsible for this biologic activity.", 
    "104": "To characterize CCK receptors on human gallbladder tissue, gallbladders were removed from human donor grafts that were being used for liver transplantation. The gallbladders were rapidly frozen and sectioned for measurement of binding of 125I-Bolton-Hunter-labeled-CCK-8 and were cut into strips for in vitro bioassay.", 
    "105": "Binding of 125I-BH-CCK-8 to human gallbladder was saturable, specific, and dependent on time, pH, and temperature. The binding was inhibited only by cholecystokinin-related peptides including CCK-8 (IC50 10 +/- 1.0 nmol/L) (mean +/- SD), des(SO3) CCK-8 (IC50 0.9 +/- 0.2 mumol/L), and gastrin-17-I (IC50 9.0 +/- 2.0 mumol/L) or specific CCK receptor antagonist L-364,718. Computer analysis of binding of 125I-BH-CCK-8 to gallbladder tissue showed a single class of binding sites with high affinity for CCK-8. Autoradiography localized binding of 125I-BH-CCK-8 only to the smooth muscle layer of the gallbladder. In the bioassay des(SO3) CCK-8 (EC50 1.2 +/- 0.7 mumol/L) and gastrin-17-I (EC50 4.5 +/- 2.4 mumol/L) were 150- and 563-fold less potent than CCK-8 (EC50 8.0 +/- 2.2 nmol/L). The relative potencies of CCK agonists for inhibiting binding of 125I-BH-CCK-8 agreed closely with their relative potencies for causing gallbladder contraction. The dose-response curve for CCK-8 alone to induce gallbladder contraction was not significantly different from those caused by CCK-8 plus 1 mumol/L tetrodotoxin or 1 mumol/L atropine.", 
    "106": "These results characterized the CCK receptors on smooth muscle of human gallbladder as sulfate dependent and causing gallbladder contraction.", 
    "107": "While the visual projections to the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) play a role in mediating the effects of light on circadian rhythms, the functional significance of the serotonergic projection from the raphe nuclei (RN) to the SCN is uncertain. Because previous results indicated that RN would appear to be a likely site for triazolam (Tz)-induced phase shifts, we used the expression of Fos-protein as a marker of Tz-induced neuronal activation. Immunocytochemistry was used to visualize the presence of Fos-like protein. Tz-induced Fos-labeled nuclei were found in superior colliculi, Edinger-Westphal nuclei (EW) and dorsal tegmental nuclei (DTg), but not in the RN. The SCN showed only occasionally labeled nuclei in all experimental groups, whereas there was no Tz-induced Fos-immunoreactivity in the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL). The present data not necessarily exclude the implication of the RN in the phase shifting effect of Tz. The phase shift could still be accomplished using a different set of immediate early genes (IEG), or without an IEG response. Alternatively, as will be discussed, other pathways could mediate the phase shifting effect of Tz.", 
    "108": "The selectively outbred alcohol-non-tolerant (ANT) rat line is highly susceptible to impairment of postural reflexes by benzodiazepine agonists such as diazepam. ANT cerebella are generally devoid of diazepam-insensitive high-affinity binding of the benzodiazepine [3H]Ro15-4513, whereas in non-selected strains such binding marks a granule-cell-specific GABAA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor containing the alpha 6 subunit. A critical determinant for diazepam insensitivity of this 'wild-type' cerebellar GABAA receptor is an arginine residue in alpha 6 position 100, where other alpha subunits carry a histidine. Here we report that the alpha 6 gene of ANT rats is expressed at wild-type levels but carries a point mutation generating an arginine-to-glutamine substitution at position 100. In consequence, alpha 6(Q100)beta 2 gamma 2 receptors show diazepam-mediated potentiation of GABA-activated currents and diazepam-sensitive binding of [3H]Ro15-4513. Our results suggest that cerebellar motor control may be a distinct behavioural correlate of the alpha 6-subunit-containing GABAA receptor subtype.", 
    "109": "Attacks of sustained dystonia of the limbs and trunk can be initiated by handling or mild environmental stimuli (e.g. new cage) in mutant (gene symbol dtsz) Syrian golden hamsters. The severity of the dystonic syndrome in these mutant hamsters is age-dependent, with a peak at weaning (21 days of age) and a second peak at about 30-40 days of age. Spontaneous remission occurs at an age of about 70 days. The syndrome in hamsters is thus similar to transient paroxysmal dystonia in children. In the present experiments, it was examined whether dystonic hamsters exhibit age-dependent differences in susceptibility to drugs which affect GABA (gamma-aminobutyrate)ergic, glutamatergic or dopaminergic functions. After acute administration, the GABA-elevating drug aminooxyacetic acid was significantly less potent in attenuating the severity of dystonic attacks at 21 days than at 31 days of age. Similar but less marked age-dependent differences in antidystonic activity were found for phenobarbital and diazepam. In contrast to these GABAmimetic drugs, the NMDA receptor antagonist CGP 37849 (DL-[E]-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid) or the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol had about the same antidystonic potency at both 21 and 31 days of age. Chronic treatment of dystonic hamsters with aminooxyacetic acid, starting at 21 days of age, did not alter the time course or the severity of dystonia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "110": "The effect of muscarinic receptor activation on phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the rat olfactory bulb was investigated by determining either the inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) mass or the accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates ([3H]InsPs). In miniprisms of rat olfactory bulb, carbachol produced an atropine-sensitive increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration. In a membrane preparation, the formation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was stimulated by guanosine-5'-(3-O-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S), but not by carbachol. However, carbachol potentiated the GTP gamma S stimulation when the two agents were combined. In miniprisms prelabelled with [3H]myo-inositol, carbachol increased the accumulation of [3H]InsPs and this effect was significantly reduced by tissue treatment with either 1 microM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or 1 mM dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Analysis of concentration-response curves indicated that carbachol (EC50 = 96 microM) and oxotremorine-M (EC50 = 8.2 microM) behaved like full agonists, whereas oxotremorine, BM5, arecoline and bethanechol were partial agonists. The carbachol stimulation of [3H]InsPs accumulation was counteracted with high affinity by the M1 antagonist pirenzepine (pA2 = 8.26), and less potently by the M3 antagonist para-fluorohexahydro-sila-difenidol (pA2 = 6.7) and the M2 antagonist AF-DX 116 (pA2 = 6.12). The biochemical and pharmacological properties of the muscarinic stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis were compared with those displayed by the muscarinic stimulation of adenylate cyclase in the rat olfactory bulb.", 
    "111": "Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK8) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) in rats induces a rapid elevation in serum oxytocin (OT). The receptor subtype mediating this action of CCK was investigated with selective CCK-A and CCK-B receptor agonists and antagonists. CCK8 and A-71623, a potent CCK-A selective agonist, were similar in efficacy and potency for stimulating OT secretion. Both compounds at 10 nmol/kg elicited approximately one-half the response of 100 nmol/kg, which elevated serum OT to approx. 20 to 30-fold above basal level. The potent CCK-B selective agonist, A-63387, at doses up to 100 nmol/kg did not increase serum OT. MK-329, a CCK-A receptor selective antagonist, at a dose of 20 nmol/kg fully inhibited the action of 20 nmol/kg CCK8, while 100 nmol/kg of (R)L-365,260, a CCK-B selective antagonist, had no effect on the CCK8 response. These results, together with previous lesion studies, suggest that vagal CCK-A receptors in the periphery mediate the activation of the oxytocinergic pathway in vivo.", 
    "112": "Neurotransmitters acting on presynaptic terminals regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. Because of the difficulty of direct electrophysiological recording from small presynaptic terminals, little is known about the ion channels that mediate these actions or about the mechanisms by which transmitter secretion is altered. The patch-clamp technique is used to show that the predominant inhibitory presynaptic neurotransmitter, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), activates a GABAA receptor and gates a chloride channel in the membranes of peptidergic nerve terminals of the posterior pituitary. The opening of a chloride channel by GABA weakly depolarizes the nerve terminal membrane and blocks action potentials. In this way, GABA limits secretion by retarding the spread of excitation into the terminal arborization.", 
    "113": "Chronic administration of benzodiazepines has been reported to produce tolerance in animals and humans. We investigated whether benzodiazepines produce tolerance to the amnesic effects and effects on benzodiazepine receptors, GABAergic and/or cholinergic neuronal systems of repeated administration of chlordiazepoxide, using a passive avoidance task and autoradiographic techniques. Tolerance developed to the amnesic effect of chlordiazepoxide when the drug was administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg (i.p.) once a day for 14 days. Bicuculline (1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg), a GABAA receptor antagonist, did not induce amnesia in normal mice, but did so in chlordiazepoxide-tolerant mice. Muscimol (0.25 mg/kg), a GABAA receptor agonist, in combination with a low dose of chlordiazepoxide, induced amnesia in normal mice, but not in chlordiazepoxide-tolerant mice. Scopolamine, an acetylcholine receptor antagonist, induced amnesia in normal mice, but not in chlordiazepoxide-tolerant mice. In the autoradiographical study, although repeated treatment with chlordiazepoxide had no effect on [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding to benzodiazepine receptors, it decreased [3H]muscimol binding to GABAA receptors, with a decrease in affinity in the cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, repeated administration of chlordiazepoxide increased [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the hippocampus. These results suggest that tolerance develops to the amnesic effects of chlordiazepoxide, and that tolerance may be due to down-regulation of GABAA receptors and/or up-regulation of acetylcholine receptors."
