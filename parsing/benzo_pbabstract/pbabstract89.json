Because of this semiological and etiological heterogeneity, robust clinical trials are rare. Specific etiological treatments are available for only a few forms (e.g. Wilson's disease and dopa-responsive dystonia), which places the emphasis on symptomatic treatment. This is based on the combinations of three complementary approaches: drug therapy (anticholinergics, tetrabenazine and benzodiazepines are first-line drugs, but many others have been tested in small clinical trials), botulinium toxin injections in case of focal dystonia or focal targets in patients with more widespread dystonia, and physiotherapy. This review provides a short overview of available treatments and proposes a basic therapeutic strategy for dystonic patients.", 
    "1": "The use of psychotropic medications in Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been associated with both deleterious and potentially beneficial outcomes. We examined the longitudinal association of psychotropic medication use with cognitive, functional, and neuropsychiatric symptom (NPS) trajectories among community-ascertained incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study.", 
    "2": "A total of 230 participants were followed for a mean of 3.7 years. Persistency index (PI) was calculated for all antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), antipsychotics (atypical and typical), and benzodiazepines as the proportion of observed time of medication exposure. Mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between PI for each medication class and Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-Sum), and Neuropsychiatric Inventory - Total (NPI-Total) trajectories, controlling for appropriate demographic and clinical covariates.", 
    "3": "At baseline, psychotropic medication use was associated with greater severity of dementia and poorer medical status. Higher PI for all medication classes was associated with a more rapid decline in MMSE. For antidepressant, SSRI, benzodiazepine, and typical antipsychotic use, a higher PI was associated with a more rapid increase in CDR-Sum. For SSRIs, antipsychotics, and typical antipsychotics, a higher PI was associated with more rapid increase in NPI-Total.", 
    "4": "Psychotropic medication use was associated with more rapid cognitive and functional decline in AD, and not with improved NPS. Clinicians may tend to prescribe psychotropic medications to AD patients at risk of poorer outcomes, but one cannot rule out the possibility of poorer outcomes being caused by psychotropic medications.", 
    "5": "It is thought that clopidogrel bioactivation and antiplatelet response are related to cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19). However, a recent study challenged this notion by proposing CYP2C19 as wholly irrelevant, while identifying paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and its Q192R polymorphism as the major driver of clopidogrel bioactivation and efficacy. The aim of this study was to systematically elucidate the mechanism and relative contribution of PON1 in comparison to CYP2C19 to clopidogrel bioactivation and antiplatelet response.", 
    "6": "First, the influence of CYP2C19 and PON1 polymorphisms and plasma paraoxonase activity on clopidogrel active metabolite (H4) levels and antiplatelet response was assessed in a cohort of healthy subjects (n = 21) after administration of a single 75 mg dose of clopidogrel. There was a remarkably good correlation between H4 AUC (0-8 h) and antiplatelet response (r2 = 0.78). Furthermore, CYP2C19 but not PON1 genotype was predictive of H4 levels and antiplatelet response. There was no correlation between plasma paraoxonase activity and H4 levels. Secondly, metabolic profiling of clopidogrel in vitro confirmed the role of CYP2C19 in bioactivating clopidogrel to H4. However, heterologous expression of PON1 in cell-based systems revealed that PON1 cannot generate H4, but mediates the formation of another thiol metabolite, termed Endo. Importantly, Endo plasma levels in humans are nearly 20-fold lower than H4 and was not associated with any antiplatelet response.", 
    "7": "Our results demonstrate that PON1 does not mediate clopidogrel active metabolite formation or antiplatelet action, while CYP2C19 activity and genotype remains a predictor of clopidogrel pharmacokinetics and antiplatelet response.",

After receiving the above-mentioned drugs, all patients received i.v. fentanyl (3 \u03bcg/kg). After fentanyl administration, the onset time and the severity of cough for 1 min were recorded. Severity of coughing was graded as mild (1-2), moderate (3-5) and (>5) based on the number of cough per minute.",

This case of venlafaxine-associated hypoglycaemia was treated first by glucose perfusion, but despite large doses, hypoglycaemia recurred. Blood glucose normalized after injection of octreotide, eliminating the need for hypertonic glucose. Octreotide has been shown to decrease glucose requirements and the number of hypoglycaemic episodes in patients with sulfonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia but, to our knowledge, its ability to resolve hypoglycaemic episodes due to massive venlafaxine overdose has not yet been described.",

LAL was performed with a 980-nm diode laser after tumescent anaesthesia. The following laser settings were used: 600-\u03bcm optical fiber, continuous mode, power depending on individual body areas (18-40 W). The cumulative energy used for each area was recorded. Early and late complications were defined and reviewed for the whole series. Satisfaction was assessed by the patients using a visual analogue scale from 0 (unsatisfied) to 10 (highly satisfied).", 
    "15": "Mean cumulative energy ranged from 12 to 60 kJ. Ecchymoses were observed in all patients but resolved in less than 10 days. A touch up was needed in four patients to remove small cushions of fat missed. Mean patient satisfaction ranged from 6/10 to 9.5/10 depending on the treated area. Moreover, all patients reported they would be willing to undergo the procedure again, if needed.",

Patients who had at least 24 weeks of olanzapine exposure (N=4,280 from adult database and N=179 from adolescent database) were analyzed in this study. Weight data were collected for all patients, fasting glucose and lipids data were collected in some patients. For weight gain, data in 34.5% adults (4,280/12,425) and 36.6% adolescents (179/489) were analyzed while for glucose and lipids, data in 8.4% (1,038/12,425) adults and 24.9% adolescents (122/489) were analyzed. Adult patients were treated with oral (5-20 mg/day) or depot formulations (doses equivalent to oral doses of 5-20 mg/day) of olanzapine and adolescent patients were treated with oral olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day). The incidences of potentially clinically significant categorical changes in weight and metabolic parameters were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Nonoverlapping 95% CIs were considered as indicating a statistically significant difference. Weight, lipid, and glucose change comparisons are summarized.", 
    "19": "The mean age for adolescents and adults was 15.8 and 38.8, respectively. The percentage of the male population was similar for both adults (58.5%) and adolescents (62.8%). The median duration of the follow-up period was 201 days for adolescent database and 280 days for adult database. The mean weight gain from baseline to endpoint in adolescents was 11.24 kg when compared with 4.81 kg in adults. The 95% CI for adolescents (10.1, 12.4) and adults (4.57, 5.04) are not overlapping, which indicates that the difference between adolescents and adults is statistically significant. The percentage of olanzapine-treated adolescents with \u2265 7% mean weight gain was 89.4% compared with 55.4% in adults (Number need to harm [NNH]=3). Mean changes from baseline to endpoint were also greater for adolescents than for adults in fasting total cholesterol (5.49 mg/dL vs. 2.06 mg/dL), LDL (5.41 mg/dL vs. 0.49 mg/dL), and triglycerides (20.49 mg/dL vs. 16.72 mg/dL), but overlapping 95% CIs were observed for all lipid parameters. Mean changes from baseline to endpoint in fasting glucose values were similar between adolescents and adults (3.13 mg/dL vs. 3.95 mg/dL). However, the incidence of treatment-emergent significant glucose changes was greater in adults. Among olanzapine-treated adults and adolescents, 8.9% and 0.9% experienced a shift from normal to high and 12.5% and 3.3% experienced a shift from normal/impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) to high fasting glucose, respectively. The incidence of IGT to high elevations in glucose was greater in adolescents, but overlapping 95% CI was observed.", 
    "20": "The types of metabolic changes during the long-term olanzapine treatment in adolescents were similar to those observed in adults.

Previous mathematical modelling suggested that 0.1 kJ was required in order to destroy 1 ml of fat, in dual emission mode at 924/975 nm. Patients were asked to fill out a satisfaction questionnaire. Ultrasound was used to measure the fat thickness pre-and post-operatively.", 
    "23": "Other than one patient who developed mild hyperpigmentation that disappeared after 2 months, there were no complications in the series. Pain during the anaesthesia and discomfort after the procedure were minimal. Return to normal activities never took longer than 2 days and mean downtime was 0.92 days.

    "30": "As predicted, patients prescribed any hypnotic had substantially elevated hazards of dying compared to those prescribed no hypnotics. For groups prescribed 0.4-18, 18-132 and >132 doses/year, HRs (95% CIs) were 3.60 (2.92 to 4.44), 4.43 (3.67 to 5.36) and 5.32 (4.50 to 6.30), respectively, demonstrating a dose-response association. HRs were elevated in separate analyses for several common hypnotics, including zolpidem, temazepam, eszopiclone, zaleplon, other benzodiazepines, barbiturates and sedative antihistamines. Hypnotic use in the upper third was associated with a significant elevation of incident cancer; HR=1.35 (95% CI 1.18 to 1.55). Results were robust within groups suffering each comorbidity, indicating that the death and cancer hazards associated with hypnotic drugs were not attributable to pre-existing disease.", 
    "31": "Receiving hypnotic prescriptions was associated with greater than threefold increased hazards of death even when prescribed <18 pills/year. This association held in separate analyses for several commonly used hypnotics and for newer shorter-acting drugs.

We assessed the anxiety level of 99 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with (n=15) or without (n=84) BDZ for seizure control, using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) or the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA). Independent risk factors for high anxiety levels were being a female patient (O.R.=2.93; 95% C.I.=1.05-8.16; p=0.039), having uncontrolled seizures (O.R.=4.49; 95% C.I.=1.66-12.11; p=0.003) and having a history of a psychiatric disorder (O.R.=4.46; 95% C.I.=1.63-12.21; p=0.004). However, there were no statistically significant differences in anxiety levels between patients utilizing or not utilizing BDZ prescribed exclusively for seizure control. We concluded that in our study, patients with chronic use of BDZ prescribed exclusively for seizure control showed similar anxiety levels than patients who were not using this class of drug. Additional studies are needed to define better strategies for the treatment of anxiety disorders in epilepsy.", 
    "34": "Weight gain is commonly observed with olanzapine treatment. Zonisamide is an antiepileptic drug associated with weight loss. This study examined the effectiveness of zonisamide in preventing weight gain in 42 patients beginning olanzapine for bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Each patient had a body mass index of 22 mg/kg or greater and was randomized to taking olanzapine with either zonisamide (n = 20) or placebo (n = 22) for 16 weeks. The primary outcome measure was change in body weight in kilograms from baseline. In the primary analysis using longitudinal regression, patients who received zonisamide had a significantly slower rate of weight gain and increase in body mass index than those who received placebo. The patients treated with zonisamide gained a mean (SD) of 0.9 (3.3) kg, whereas those treated with placebo gained a mean (SD) of 5.0 (5.5) kg; P = 0.01. None of the patients in the zonisamide group, compared with 7 patients (33%) in the placebo group, gained 7% of body weight or greater from baseline (Fisher exact test, P = 0.009). The zonisamide group, however, reported significantly more cognitive impairment as an adverse event than the placebo group (25% vs 0, respectively; P = 0.02). Zonisamide was effective for mitigating weight gain in patients with bipolar disorder or schizophrenia initiating treatment with olanzapine but was associated with cognitive impairment as an adverse event.", 
    "35": "There are epidemiological data indicating that medical and/or nonmedical use of prescription opioids oftentimes involves concurrent use of other substances. One of those substances is benzodiazepines. It would be of relevance to characterize the effects of an opioid and a benzodiazepine when taken together to determine if measures related to abuse liability-related effects and psychomotor performance impairment are increased compared to when the drugs are taken alone.", 
    "36": "Twenty volunteers participated in a crossover, randomized, double-blind study in which they received placebo, 0.5mg alprazolam, 10mg oxycodone, and 0.5mg alprazolam combined with 10 mg oxycodone, all p.o. Subjective, psychomotor, and physiological measures were assessed during each of the four sessions.", 
    "37": "Oxycodone by itself increased drug liking and \"take again\" ratings relative to placebo, but these ratings were not increased when oxycodone was taken with alprazolam, which by itself did not increase either of these ratings. The two drugs in combination produced stronger effects (larger in magnitude or longer lasting) than when either was taken alone on a number of measures, including psychomotor performance impairment.", 
    "38": "In healthy volunteers, abuse liability-related subjective effects of oxycodone were not enhanced by alprazolam. There was enhanced behavioral toxicity when the drugs were taken together, and thus, this is of significant concern from a public safety standpoint.", 
    "39": "The aim of the study is to determine the acute toxicity and anxiolytic-like effects of a mixture of cis and trans of (+)-limonene epoxide in animal models of anxiety. After acute treatment with (+)-limonene epoxide at doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg (i.p.) no mortality was noted during 14 days of observation. In general, behavior, food and water consumption showed no significant changes. In open field test, (+)-limonene epoxide at doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg, after intraperitoneal administration, significantly decreased the number of crossings, grooming and rearing (p<0.001). All these effects were reversed by the pre-treatment with flumazenil (25 mg/kg, i.p.), similar to those observed with diazepam used as a positive standard. In the elevated-plus-maze test, (+)-limonene epoxide increased the time of permanence and the number of entrances in the open arms. All these effects were reversed by flumazenil, an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors. In addition, (+)-limonene epoxide (75 mg/kg) also produced a significant inhibition of the motor coordination (p<0.01), that was reversed by flumazenil. In conclusion, the present work evidenced sedative and anxiolytic-like effects of (+)-limonene epoxide, which might involve an action on benzodiazepine-type receptors. These results indicate that the properties of (+)-limonene epoxide should be more thoroughly examined in order to achieve newer tools for management and/or treatment of central nervous system diseases and anxiolytic-like effects. The LD50 obtained for the acute toxicity studies using intraperitoneal route of administration was 4.0 g/kg. These findings suggest that acute administration of the (+)-limonene epoxide exerts an anxiolytic-like effect on mice, and it could serve as a new approach for the treatment anxiety, since it practically does not produce toxic effects.",

    "49": "Translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), has been described in several tissues and characterized as one of the main elements of steroidogenesis. However, TSPO is also involved in other pathways and cell functions, such as apoptosis regulation, protein import, membrane biogenesis, cell cycle regulation, oxygen homeostasis and mitochondrial membrane fluidity regulation. In the kidney, TSPO is normally located in the distal parts of the nephron from the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle to the medullary collecting ducts. However when the kidney is submitted to a stress such as ischemia reperfusion injury there is a defined change in TSPO expression towards more proximal areas of the nephron, and the protein can be detected as high as proximal tubular cells and the Bowman Capsule. As the injury persists, TSPO is also located in invading mononucleated cells, in a pattern reproducing invasion by CD4+ helper T cells, and in the damaged vessels where TSPO is expressed both in endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Herein we review the potential use of TSPO-directed treatment for ischemia reperfusion injury, particularly regarding pre-conditioning of the organ. We also detail the relationship of proximal TSPO staining with the intensity of the injury, particularly the implication of monomeric (18 kDa) TSPO and its role in hypoxia-reoxygenation and apoptosis prevention. The potential implications of the protein with regeneration processes activated in response to injury and their relation with embryogenesis pathways are discussed.", 
    "50": "Various \u03b1(2,3) subtype selective partial GABA-A agonists are in development to treat anxiety disorders. These compounds are expected to be anxiolytic with fewer undesirable side effects, compared to nonselective GABA-A agonists like benzodiazepines. Several \u03b1(2,3) subtype selective and nonselective GABA-A agonists have been examined in healthy volunteers, using a battery addressing different brain domains. Data from five placebo-controlled double-blind studies were pooled. Lorazepam 2\u2009mg was the comparator in three studies. Three \u03b1(2,3)-selective GABAA agonists (i.e., TPA023, TPACMP2, SL65.1498), one \u03b1(1)-selective GABAA agonists (zolpidem), and another full agonist (alprazolam) were examined. Pharmacological selectivity was assessed by determination of regression lines for the change from baseline of saccadic-peak-velocity- (\u0394SPV-) relative effect, relative to changes in different pharmacodynamic endpoints (\u0394PD). SPV was chosen for its sensitivity to the anxiolysis of benzodiazepines. Slopes of the \u0394SPV-\u0394PD relations were consistently lower with the \u03b1(2,3) selective GABA-A agonists than with lorazepam, indicating that their PD effects are less than their SPV-effects. The \u0394SPV-\u0394PD relations of lorazepam were comparable to alprazolam. Zolpidem showed relatively higher impairments in \u0394PD relative to \u0394SPV, but did not significantly differ from lorazepam. These PD results support the pharmacological selectivity of the \u03b1(2,3)-selective GABA-A agonists, implying an improved therapeutic window.", 
    "51": "Agitation is one of the most frequent causes for palliative sedation. It often requires urgent control to avoid negative consequences and even endangerment of all involved, including the patients themselves. A protocol for the control of episodes of agitation was developed, based on a previous experience. The protocol includes a combination of haloperidol and midazolam. The protocol was used 86 times in 27 patients. Each patient was sedated from 1 to 12 times, median 2 times. The median time from the beginning of sedation to the control of agitation was 15 minutes with a range from 1 minute (2 cases) to 3 hours and 5 minutes (only 1 case). In 71 cases (83%), only the first dose was needed. There were no significant complications.",

Symptoms subsided when rivastigmine was withdrawn and did not reappear when a different cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil was introduced. Physicians should be aware of Pisa syndrome and should alert patient of this possibility when starting and stepping up medications. The purpose of reporting this case is to create awareness among general practitioners as it is a reversible condition which responds to removal of the offending drug.", 
    "57": "Considerable attention focuses on the ability to develop therapeutic agents that elevate levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors have been developed on the basis of their ability to raise HDL-C to a greater extent than lipid-modifying therapies currently used in clinical practice. Initial enthusiasm for CETP inhibition decreased as a result of adverse clinical outcomes observed with the agent torcetrapib. Elucidating off-target toxicities of torcetrapib has provided hope that other CETP inhibitors may still be of potential benefit. Evacetrapib is a novel CETP inhibitor, with favorable effects on plasma lipids and no adverse effects on blood pressure or mineralocorticoid activity in early clinical evaluation. The potential effects on cardiovascular outcomes remain to be determined.",

The catatonic symptoms were alleviated by intravenous lorazepam, and manic symptoms were adequately treated with risperidone.

    "59": "Uric acid (UA) has proven to be a causal agent in endothelial dysfunction in which ROS production plays an important role. Calcium overload in mitochondria can promote the mitochondrial production of ROS. We hypothesize that calcium transduction in mitochondria contributes to UA-induced endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "60": "We first demonstrated that high concentrations of UA cause endothelial dysfunction, marked by a reduction in eNOS protein expression and NO release in vitro. We further found that a high concentration of UA increased levels of [Ca2+]mito, total intracellular ROS, H2O2, and mitochondrial O2\u00b7-, and \u0394\u03c8mito but not the [Ca2+]cyt level. When the mitochondrial calcium channels NCXmito and MCU were blocked by CGP-37157 and Ru360, respectively, the UA-induced increases in the levels of [Ca2+]mito and total intracellular ROS were significantly reduced. Mitochondrial levels of O2\u00b7- and \u0394\u03c8mito were reduced by inhibition of NCXmito but not of MCU. Moreover, inhibition of NCXmito, but not of MCU, blocked the UA-induced reductions in eNOS protein expression and NO release.", 
    "61": "The increased generation of mitochondrial O2\u00b7- induced by a high concentration of UA is triggered by mitochondrial calcium overload and ultimately leads to endothelial dysfunction. In this process, the activation of NCXmito is the major cause of the influx of calcium into mitochondria. Our results provide a new pathophysiological mechanism for UA-induced endothelial dysfunction and may offer a new therapeutic target for clinicians.", 
    "62": "Lynch gene carriers undergo regular surveillance colonoscopies. Polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG) is routinely prescribed for bowel cleansing, but often poorly tolerated by patients. Sodium phosphate (NaP) may be an alternative. Prospective and random comparison of bowel preparation with PEG and NaP on colon cleansing and patients' acceptance. Patients, who previously underwent a colonoscopy, were invited to participate and randomly assigned to either PEG or NaP. They were asked to fill in a questionnaire about preparation tolerability and future preferences. The endoscopist filled out a report about the quality of colon cleansing. 125 Patients were included in the study. Nine (7%) were excluded because of missing data. The remaining 116 patients (53 PEG and 63 NaP) were included in the analysis. Baseline characteristics did not differ between groups. Before colonoscopy 20 (38%) patients using PEG experienced the preparation almost intolerable, in contrast to 7(11%) of those using NaP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Eleven patients in the PEG group and 48 in the NaP group would prefer NaP in the future. The colonoscopy was poorly tolerated in 17% of the individuals in both groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.963). The endoscopist observed a more than 75% clean colon in 83% of patients on PEG and in 71% of patients on NaP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.076), however the coecum (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025) and ascending colon was cleaner after PEG. Lynch patients tolerated NaP better and preferred this formula for future bowel preparation. Colon cleansing was suboptimal with both treatments with a tendency towards a cleaner proximal colon with PEG.", 
    "63": "Adherence to treatment in psychiatric as in other chronic or recurrent conditions, is often suboptimal. A high proportion of relapses is due to non-adherence to prescribed treatment. Adherence to treatment is a potent predictor of effectiveness, both in clinical trials and cohort studies, therefore is a very relevant area where any improving tool is looked forward. Orally Disintegrating Tablets (ODT) were developed with the aim to improve patient's compliance due to their fast oral absorption. They are particularly useful in psychiatric patients who often simulate drug assumption or experience difficulties in taking pills. ODT formulations have been developed for many antypsychotics including olanzapine. The ODT formulations of olanzapine show to be significantly different one from the other in the dissolution time, thus having a potential impact on compliance. In this review, the results of different studies consistently highlight the positive risk/benefit profile, the contribution to patient's compliance and their preference while using ODT formulation of olanzapine produced throughout the ZYDIS technology (Velotab). Moreover, the differences between olanzapine ODT (Velotab) and the standard formulation of olanzapine and other antipsychotics are described focusing on in efficacy, safety, patient acceptance and health economic impact. The ODT formulation of olanzapine (Velotab) seems to ameliorate patient's adherence thus improving psychiatrist/caregiver/patient alliance.", 
    "64": "In the present study was examined the effect of treatment with olanzapine or risperidone, given separately or in combination with fluoxetine, in the elevated plus-maze test (an animal model of anxiety) in male Wistar rats. The obtained results showed that treatment with olanzapine (1 mg/kg), risperidone (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (5 and 10 mg/kg) induced an anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus-maze test. Olanzapine, risperidone and fluoxetine, tested in doses effective in the model of anxiolytic-like actions, did not affect motor coordination, while olanzapine (3 mg/kg) and risperidone (0.3 mg/kg) produced a significant reduction of exploratory activity in the open field test. In a combination study, the anxiolytic-like effect of olanzapine or risperidone was significantly antagonized by co-treatment with fluoxetine. Additionally, co-treatment with olanzapine or risperidone and fluoxetine disturbed the motor coordination of rats in a rota-rod test. These findings indicate that olanzapine, risperidone and fluoxetine per se may be clinically effective in treating anxiety disorders, but their effects may be attenuated when they are used in combination with other medications.",

Because pharmacological stimulation of K(v)7 channel function has shown anti-manic like efficacy in the D-amphetamine and chlordiazepoxide (AMPH+CDP) induced hyperactivity mouse model of mania, we addressed whether this effect of K(v)7 channels could be associated with changes in cerebral [\u00b9\u2074C]2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, a surrogate marker of brain metabolic activity. Acute administration of the Kv7 channel modulators, retigabine (pan K(v)7.2-K(v)7.5 channel opener) and ICA-27243 (K(v)7.2/K(v)7.3 channel-preferring opener) reduced 2-DG uptake in several mouse forebrain structures with a brain regional signature similar to the mood stabilizers, lithium and valproate. Combined administration of AMPH+CDP enhanced 2-DG uptake in the striatum, cortex and thalamus, and both retigabine and ICA-27243 fully prevented this stimulatory effect of AMPH+CDP. In addition, both K(v)7 channel openers dose-dependently increased phospho-serine-9 levels of GSK3\u03b2 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, a common molecular mechanism shared by anti-manic drugs. In combination, these data emphasize the potential of K(v)7 channel openers in the treatment of bipolar disorder, and suggest that heteromeric K(v)7.2/K(v)7.3 channels may present a novel anti-manic therapeutic target.",

We enrolled adult ASA I-III patients who came for elective surgery to the Aga Khan University Hospital preoperative surgery suite for 3 months. Hundred patients were enrolled. The majority of patients got 7.5 mg of PO Midazolam. Our median Ramsay sedation score was 2 and the Median drug to door time was 52.35 minutes. 11 patients were reportedly 'drowsy' in the recovery room one hour after surgery was completed. These were mostly the same patients who had a higher (Ramsay V) sedation score in the preoperative period (p = 0.36). There was no significant difference in the 2 midazolam dosages and the Ramsay sedation score (p = 0.12). We concluded that our sedation score is too low and our median time interval is too long making most patients coming for surgery under sedated.

An emissive fluorescence at 472 nm was detected in colourless spirits (vodka and tequila) at room temperature. 2-M perchloric acid was the most appropriated proton source. By using electron ionization mass spectrometry and time-dependent density functional theory calculations, the possible structure of protonated flunitrazepam was identified to be 2-nitro-N-methylacridone, an acridone derivative as opposed to 2-methylamino-5-nitro-2'-fluorobenzophenone, a benzophenone derivative.",

    "90": "Sex differences exist in tobacco smoking behaviors. Nicotine, the primary addictive ingredient in tobacco smoke, indirectly affects \u03b3-amino butyric acid (GABA) function. Previous studies reported sex-by-smoking interactions in brain GABA levels. The goal of the present study was to evaluate if there is a sex-by-smoking interaction at the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors (GABA(A)-BZRs), as well as relationships between GABA(A)-BZR availability and behavioral variables before and after 1 week of smoking cessation. Twenty-six women (8 non-smokers, age 36.0 \u00b1 13.4 years; 19 smokers, age 34.6 \u00b1 8.9 years) and 25 men (8 non-smokers, age 37.9 \u00b1 13.8 years; 17 smokers, 34.1 \u00b1 12.4 years) were imaged using [123I]iomazenil and single-photon emission computed tomography. Smokers were imaged at baseline 7 hours after the last cigarette. A significantly great number of men were able to abstain from smoking for 1 week (P = 0.003). There were no significant differences in nicotine dependence and cigarette craving, mood or pain sensitivity between male and female smokers. There was a significant effect of gender across all brain regions (frontal, parietal, anterior cingulate, temporal and occipital cortices, and cerebellum; P < 0.05), with all women (smokers and non-smokers combined) having a higher GABA(A)-BZR availability than all men. There was a negative correlation between GABA(A)-BZR availability and craving (P \u2264 0.02) and pain sensitivity (P = 0.04) in female smokers but not male smokers. This study provides further evidence of a sex-specific regulation of GABA(A)-BZR availability in humans and demonstrates the potential for GABA(A)-BZRs to mediate tobacco smoking craving and pain symptoms differentially in female and male smokers.",

The butanol fraction did not significantly increase the time taken to complete the task and number of foot slips in the beam walking assay, suggesting that it does not induce significant motor coordination deficit. Diazepam (2mg/kg), the standard agent used significantly (P<0.01) increased the number of foot slips. In the open field test, the butanol fraction significantly reduced the number of square crossed as well as the number of rearing.

Many researchers solely employ male animals in studies; this is primarily due to concerns about the impact of variations in the female estrous cycle on behavioural responses. The objective of the present study therefore was to examine whether sex has any effect in some commonly employed behavioural pharmacology tests. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were examined in the following behavioural pharmacology tests: diazepam (DZP) effects on anxiolytic behaviour in the elevated plus maze (EPM); desipramine (DMI) effects on immobility time in the forced swim test (FST); amphetamine (AMP) and apomorphine (APO) effects on locomotor activity in the homecage monitoring apparatus (HCMA). Baseline investigations revealed that females were more active than males in all three tests. DZP increased open arm time and entries for males but not for females. Similarly, significant reduction in immobility time with DMI was found for males in the FST, with no effect observed in females. There was a significant effect of AMP dose on distance moved for both sexes; the peak locomotor stimulating effects were seen following 1-2 mg kg\u207b\u00b9 AMP doses for males, while 0.5 mg kg\u207b\u00b9 produced the greatest effect in females. APO impaired locomotor activity in both sexes. These results demonstrate that male and female rats respond differently to psychotropic drugs. The absence of female responses to the effects of DZP and DMI in the EPM and FST respectively was due to the high baseline activity levels seen with females; thus behavioural tests must be designed to account for sex differences in baseline behaviours to allow for unambiguous extrapolation of the results.",

In the first period, several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) such as phenobarbital, diphenylhydantoin, ethosuximide, carbamazepine, benzodiazepines and valproic acid were introduced to epilepsy treatment. After 1990 many new generation drugs (lamotrigine, topiramate, gabapentine, pregabaline, felbamate, lacosamide, levetiracetam etc.) have been developed. These novel AEDs have offered some advantages such as fewer side effects, fewer drug-drug interactions, and better pharmacokinetic properties. But pharmacoresistance and therapeutic failure in 20-25% of the patients remain the main reasons to continue efforts to find safer and more efficacious drugs and ultimate a treatment for this devastating disease. Several AEDs especially novel compounds have been found to be effective also in the treatment of several other neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Chemical diversity of the newer antiepileptic drugs as well as those currently in clinical development is another point that encourages medicinal chemists to study this subject. This review summarizes recent studies on the development of potential anticonvulsant compounds in different chemical structures, their structure-activity relationships and also therapeutic usages of AEDs other than epilepsy.",

The syndrome, latrodectism, is characterized by painful muscle rigidity and autonomic disturbances such as tachycardia, hypertension, and diaphoresis. Symptoms typically last for 1-3 days. Treatment has ranged from local folk remedies to administration of specific antivenom. Opioid analgesics combined with muscle relaxants, such as benzodiazepines, are only effective at symptomatic and temporary control. Antivenom is by far the most efficacious therapy available based on symptom resolution, need for subsequent therapy, and hospital admission rates. Fear of allergic type reactions from antivenom administration has limited its use in the United States. A new purified F(ab)2 fragment Latrodectus mactans antivenom, Analatro\u00ae, is currently undergoing clinical trials. The product is expected to have similar efficacy and be associated with fewer adverse reactions when compared to the currently available partially purified whole IgG Merck product. This shift in the risk-benefit analysis may ultimately lead to more antivenom administration in significantly envenomated patients.",

Several theories have been proposed to explain the mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant efficacy of the KD, however, the precise anticonvulsant mechanism of the KD is still unknown. We speculated the mechanism underlying the effect of the KD in patients with intractable epilepsy, based on the results of the [11C] flumazenil (FMZ)-positron emission tomography (PET) study. A patient developed frontal lobe epilepsy at the age of 2 years. At the age of 4 years 11 months, she was admitted to our hospital for the initiation of a KD. At the time of admission, she had several epileptic attacks each day: frequent postural tonic seizures, hypermotor seizures, head nodding, and intermittent loss of consciousness (non-convulsive status epilepticus). MR imaging showed no abnormal signal intensity in the brain. With the KD, the seizure frequency reduced dramatically on the fifth day. Interictal [11C] FMZ-PET was performed before and 2 months after the initiation of the KD. Before the KD, the [11C] FMZ-PET images and [11C] FMZ-PET binding potential (BP) images showed extremely low accumulation of FMZ throughout the cerebral cortex. Two months after the initiation of the KD, significantly increased binding potential of [11C] FMZ was observed, implying the increased binding potential of the benzodiazepine receptors, probably due to the anticonvulsant effect of the KD. These PET findings suggested that KD may control seizures by directly or indirectly increasing the binding potential of the benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "108": "This study examined the usefulness of 123I-iomazenil SPECT (IMZ-SPECT), a type of brain scintigram that focuses on the central benzodiazepine receptor in order to determine its distribution and the function of inhibitory neurons. IMZ-SPECT has been used for the detection of epileptogenic foci, especially when surgical intervention is considered. Interictal study by IMZ-SPECT is widely available at numerous institutions and its usefulness has been confirmed in patients with not only focal cortical dysplasia and hippocampal sclerosis, but also tuberous sclerosis and neuronal migration disorders, even when magnetic resonance image fails to demonstrate any abnormal findings. When interpreting scintigrams, the developmental dynamic change of the central benzodiazepine receptor in childhood and the duration of the benzodiazepine exposure period should be taken into consideration. It is expected that IMZ-SPECT will be used in various neurological disorders other than epilepsy in the future allow medical services to be provided based on findings in the inhibitory synaptic system obtained with IMZ-SPECT.",

    "110": "Subjects were 671 drug-related disorder patients diagnosed according to the ICD-10 classification as \"F1: mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use,\" who abused psychoactive substances other than alcohol. Of all the psychiatric hospitals in Japan between September and October 2010, these drug-related disorder patients had consecutively consulted or were admitted to 153 psychiatric hospitals.", 
    "111": "The present study was conducted by means of a mail survey. Subjects' clinical information, including history of psychoactive substance use, means of access to the primary drug of abuse, other ICD-10 diagnoses including the F1 subcategory and comorbid psychiatric disorders, and recent history of self-destructive behavior, were collected from the attending psychiatrists of each subject. The data thus gathered concerning sedative-related disorder patients were compared with those of patients with methamphetamine-related disorder, which has been the most serious drug-related problem in Japan since the 1950s.", 
    "112": "Out of the 671 subjects, 119 patients mainly abusing sedatives (SRD group) were identified, while 361 patients were identified as mainly abusing methamphetamine (MRD group). The MRD group was the largest population (53.8% of the total subjects), followed by the SRD group (17.7%), and then the inhalant-related disorder group with 56 patients (8. 3%). Compared with the MRD group, the SRD group was younger, contained more female patients, and had a lower incidence of a history of involvement with anti-social societies and anti-social behavior. Patients in the SRD group were more likely to have started abusing drugs with the intention of reducing the unpleasant symptoms of insomnia (42.9%), anxiety (26.1%), and depression (16.0%), and to acquire the drugs they abused from medical institutions such as psychiatric or primary care clinics (82.1%), while patients in the MRD group were more likely to have started out of curiosity (35.1%) or in response to peer pressure (47. 1%), and to acquire their drugs from a \"pusher\" (32.8%). Additionally, in the SRD group, the ICD-10 F1 subcategory diagnoses that were the clinically most important were \"dependence syndrome\" (64.0%), \"harmful use\" (16.2%), and \"acute intoxication\" (16.2%), while the most important subcategory diagnosis in the MRD group was \"psychotic disorder\" (34.3%) and \"residual disorder and late-onset psychotic disorder\" (32.9%). Further, comorbid psychiatric disorders were more frequently found in the SRD group than in the MRD group; notably, co-occurrence of mood disorder was found in 45.0% of the SRD group in contrast to the MRD group (11.9%). Recent episodes of deliberate self-harm behavior were also more frequently found in the SRD group than the MRD group (33.6 vs. 10.5%, respectively) ; the major means by which these patients harmed themselves was by overdosing on prescribed drugs (23.5 vs. 4.7%, respectively).", 
    "113": "The present study suggests that sedative-related disorder is an important clinical issue in the field of drug-related disorders in Japan today, and that SRD patients may represent a distinct type of drug abuser whose clinical characteristics are different from those of MRD patients. The development and spread of treatment programs for \"dependence syndrome\" and \"harmful use\" will help SRD patients, and educating psychiatrists about SRD will help prevent future sedative abuse.",

    "115": "This is a retrospective case-control study. Data were extracted from the Agis Health Database. This insurance database contains the healthcare consumption of 1.3 million inhabitants of the Netherlands. We analyzed the use of psychotropics in cancer patients and an equally sized randomly selected control group of noncancer patients from 2006 to 2008. Odds ratio (OR) were adjusted for age, gender, immigrant status, neighborhood socio-economic status, and premorbid medical condition. Additionally, the numbers of new user in the 3 months after cancer was diagnosed and in the 3 months before death were compared.",

Lower socio-economic status, immigrant, and premorbid chronic medical conditions were significantly associated with higher risk of psychotropic use. Odds for a new prescription for all three psychotropic drugs were significantly less in the first 3 months after cancer diagnosis than the 3 months before death (benzodiazepine, OR = 0.673, CI = 0.647-0.705; antidepressant, OR = 0.592, CI = 0.544-0.644; antipsychotic, OR = 0.177, CI = 0.165-0.190) CONCLUSIONS: Psychotropic drug prescription is common in cancer patients, starts soon after diagnosis, and increases in the terminal stage. Prescription rates were significantly higher in patients from lower socio-economic group, immigrants, or with premorbid chronic medical condition.", 
    "117": "To examine the mechanism accounting for the diverse alteration of hepatic metabolism of CYP3A substrates observed with renal function being severely impaired, the hepatic drug metabolizing activity was evaluated using liver microsomes prepared from rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure (ARF). Midazolam, nifedipine and rifabutin were employed as representative CYP3A substrates. When the Michaelis-Menten parameters, K(m) and V(max) , were examined in the incubation study, the K(m) values of midazolam and nifedipine in ARF rats were shown to decrease by 50.9% and 29.9% compared with the normal value, respectively. The V(max) values of midazolam and nifedipine in ARF rats also decreased by 49.3% and 28.0%, respectively, showing that their decreased K(m) values accompanied the decreased V(max) values. The parameters of nifedipine seemed to alter to a lesser extent than those of midazolam. As for rifabutin metabolism, the decrease in the K(m) value was observed in ARF rats, but it did not accompany the decrease in the V(max) value. Then, the hepatic expressions of the CYP3A subfamily were examined with western blotting using anti-CYP3A1 and anti-CYP3A2 antibodies. It was revealed that the hepatic expression of CYP3A2 decreased, while that of CYP3A1 was unaffected. Additionally, a band signal deduced to originate from CYP3A9 was clearly detected in ARF, but not in normal rats. Considering each substrate having different specificities for CYP3A subfamily member proteins, individual alterations of hepatic CYP3A subfamily expression seem to underlie the diverse alterations of hepatic metabolism of CYP3A substrates in ARF rats.", 
    "118": "The presence of M3 cholinoreceptors and their role in mediation of action potential waveform modulation were determined by immunolabeling of receptor proteins and standard microelectrode technique, respectively. The sinoatrial node (SAN), which was determined as a connexin 43 negative area within the intercaval region, the surrounding atrial tissue, and the working ventricular myocardium exhibited labeling of both M3 and M2 receptors. However, the density of M3 and M2 labeling was about twofold higher in the SAN compared to working myocardium. The stimulation of M3 receptors was obtained by application of nonselective M1 and M3 muscarinic agonist pilocarpine (10(-5)\u00a0M) in the presence of selective M2 blocker methoctramine (10(-7)\u00a0M). Stimulation of M3 receptors provoked marked shortening of action potential duration in atrial and ventricular working myocardium. In the SAN, M3 stimulation leads to a significant reduction of sinus rhythm rate accompanied with slowing of diastolic depolarization and increase of action potential upstroke velocity. All electrophysiological effects of selective M3 stimulation were suppressed by specific blocker of M3 receptors 4-DAMP (10(-8)\u00a0M). We conclude that M3 cholinoreceptors are present in pacemaker and working myocardium of murine heart, where they mediate negative cholinergic effects: slowing of sinus rhythm and shortening of action potentials.", 
    "119": "A simple and sensitive GC-EI-MS method using solvent extraction and evaporation was developed for the determination of olanzapine concentrations in plasma samples. Because olanzapine and promazine, which was used as the internal standard (IS), are nitrogenous bases, they can adsorb to the weakly acidic silanol groups on the surfaces of glass centrifuge tubes during solvent extraction and evaporation. Silylation of the glass tubes, addition of triethylamine (TEA), and use of a sample solution with a basic pH could prevent adsorption loss. The extraction method involved mixing plasma (500 \u03bcL) in a silylated glass tube with a promazine solution (2 \u03bcg/mL, 25 \u03bcL) in methanol containing 1% TEA. After addition of aqueous sodium carbonate (0.5 mol/L, pH 11.1, 1 mL) and extraction into 3 mL of dichloromethane/n-hexane (1:1, v/v) containing 1% TEA, the organic phase was evaporated to dryness in a silylated glass tube. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate containing 1% TEA (50 \u03bcL). For GC-EI-MS analysis, the calibration curves of olanzapine in human plasma were linear from 0.5 to 100 ng/mL. Intra- and interday precisions in plasma were both less than 7.36% (coefficient of variation), and the accuracy was between 94.6 and 110% for solutions with concentrations greater than 0.5 ng/mL. The limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/mL in plasma. The assay was applied to therapeutic drug monitoring in samples from three schizophrenic patients.", 
    "120": "The translocator protein (TSPO) (18 kDa) is an emerging drug target for the treatment of numerous pathologies including cancer and neurodegenerative disease. However, our limited knowledge of TSPO binding site(s) has hindered the development of TSPO ligands with potential therapeutic effects. We have synthesized a series of pyrrolobenzoxazepines (1-10) to better characterize the interaction of ligands with the TSPO across species, and to determine their functional profiles. All ligands 1-10 displaced the binding of [3H]PK 11195 to the TSPO at nanomolar concentrations, with discrepancies in binding affinity between rat and human TSPO. Interestingly, non-linear regression analysis revealed that some ligands bound to the protein with a Hill slope not equal to 1.0, suggesting possible additional TSPO binding sites with allosteric effects. However, this trend was not conserved between rat and human. When tested for their effects on pregnenolone production in rat C6 glioma cells, nitric oxide release in murine microglia, and cell proliferation in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, the pyrrolobenzoxazepines (40 \u03bcM) displayed functional effects which did not correlate to the binding trend observed in competition assays. We propose that consideration of species differences and binding site cooperativity, plus optimization of currently accepted functional assays, will aid in the development of drugs targeting TSPO that can be used as therapeutics for human disease.", 
    "121": "Several molecular and cellular markers are currently used as prognostic indicators for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of breast cancer. Although some of these markers have helped clinicians provide an earlier diagnosis (or prognosis), they have failed to provide adequate information about the mechanisms responsible for different stages of tumor malignancy so that more effective anticancer therapies can be developed. Recently translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), has received attention as a potential target for anticancer drug development. It is a well-conserved protein, located at outer-inner mitochondrial membrane contact sites, and is expressed in almost all tissues, although the level of expression varies. TSPO is closely associated with the 32 kDa voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and the 30 kDa adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), considered to form the core of a mitochondria multiprotein complex [named the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)] and plays a role in apoptotic cell death. As the major role of TSPO is steroid biosynthesis, TSPO expression is particularly high in organs involved in steroidogenesis such as the adrenals, testes, ovaries, placenta, prostate, colon, kidney, and cardiovascular system. It is well known that TSPO is over-expressed in highly aggressive tumors, especially those of the breast, and that expression correlates with advancing stages of this malignancy. TSPO expression, nuclear localization, and TSPO-mediated cholesterol transport into the nucleus are involved in breast cancer cell proliferation and aggressive phenotype expression. Hence, it can be used as a biomarker in the stage-dependent diagnosis of this cancer. In addition, cell proliferation, invasion and migration appears to be decreased when treated with high doses of TSPO ligand PK-11195, a compound that may represent a therapeutic agent for the control of breast cancer progression. Control of breast cancer development by consumption of dietary soy protein has been linked to down-regulation of the expression of TSPO-mediated angiogenic signaling molecules. This chapter provides insight into the potential of TSPO as a rational target for the development of novel therapeutics for breast cancer.", 
    "122": "The mitochondrial 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) was first detected by its capability to bind benzodiazepines in peripheral tissues and later also in glial cells in the brain, hence its previous most common name peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). TSPO has been implicated in various functions, including apoptosis and steroidogenesis, among others. Various endogenous TSPO ligands have been proposed, for example: Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI), triakontatetraneuropeptide (TTN), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), and protoporphyrin IX. However, the functional implications of interactions between the TSPO and its putative endogenous ligands still have to be firmly established. The TSPO has been suggested to interact with a mitochondrial protein complex, summarized as mitochondrial membrane permeability transition pore (MPTP), which is considered to regulate the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). In addition, the TSPO is associated with several other proteins. The associations of the TSPO with these various proteins at the mitochondrial membranes have been attributed to functions such as apoptosis, steroidogenesis, phosphorylation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, ATP production, and collapse of the \u0394\u03a8m. Interestingly, while TSPO is known to play a role in the modulation of steroid production, in turn, steroids are also known to affect TSPO expression. As with the putative endogenous TSPO ligands, the effects of steroids on TSPO functions still have to be established. In any case, steroid-TSPO interactions occur in organs and tissues as diverse as the reproductive system, kidney, and brain. In general, the steroid-TSPO interactions are thought to be part of stress responses, but may also be essential for reproductive events, embryonic development, and responses to injury, including brain injury. The present review focuses on the role of TSPO in cell death i.e. the notion that enhanced expression and/or activation of the TSPO leads to cell death, and the potential of steroids to regulate TSPO expression and activation.", 
    "123": "Throughout the last decade, efforts to identify and develop effective inhibitors of the ricin toxin have focused on targeting its N-glycosidase activity. Alternatively, molecules disrupting intracellular trafficking have been shown to block ricin toxicity. Several research teams have recently developed high-throughput phenotypic screens for small molecules acting on the intracellular targets required for entry of ricin into cells. These screens have identified inhibitory compounds that can protect cells, and sometimes even animals against ricin. We review these newly discovered cellular inhibitors of ricin intoxication, discuss the advantages and drawbacks of chemical-genetics approaches, and address the issues to be resolved so that the therapeutic development of these small-molecule compounds can progress.",

The effect on CYP3A-mediated drug metabolism in rats after single dose administration of P. amarus extract was investigated using midazolam (MDZ) as a probe substrate. The effect of multiple dose administration of P. amarus extract on activity and expression of various CYP isoforms were studied. Oral administration of P. amarus extract (800\u2009mg/kg) 1\u2009h before oral MDZ increased the C(max) and AUC(0--\u221e) of MDZ by 3.9- and 9.6-fold and decreased the clearance by 12%, but did not alter the pharmacokinetics of intravenous MDZ. Daily administration of P. amarus extract (200 or 800\u2009mg/kg/day) for 15 days in rats increased the activity and expression of CYP3A and CYP2B1/2. In contrast, the activities and expressions of CYP1A, CYP2C and CYP2E1 were not significantly changed. The dual effects of P. amarus extract on CYP enzymes were demonstrated. Single dose administration of the extract increased oral bioavailability of MDZ through inhibition of intestinal CYP3A whereas repeated administration of the extract slightly induced hepatic CYP3A and CYP2B1/2 in rats, which suggested that herb-drug interactions by P. amarus may potentially occur via CYP3A and 2B.", 
    "167": "Patients with schizophrenia or related disorders often switch antipsychotic therapy, most commonly due to lack of efficacy and side effects. The differences in anticipated efficacy and tolerability among atypical antipsychotics may drive switching behaviours. Switching to long-acting antipsychotics may improve adherence. Improving adherence is essential as relatively short medication gaps significantly increase the risk of schizophrenia hospitalizations. Long-term treatment with risperidone long-acting injectable (RLAI), the first available long-acting atypical antipsychotic, versus oral atypical antipsychotics showed better adherence with RLAI. Stable patients with schizophrenia or related disorders treated with a stable dose of antipsychotic showed improved efficacy when switched to flexible doses of RLAI. The most common reason for patients to switch from olanzapine to another antipsychotic is excessive weight gain. Metabolic dysfunction also occurs more commonly with olanzapine than with risperidone. Patients switching from olanzapine to risperidone experienced significant decreases in body weight, body mass index and triglyceride levels, whereas patients switching from risperidone to olanzapine experienced significant increases in body weight and triglyceride levels. The efficacy, tolerability and safety of RLAI in non-acute patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder previously treated with oral olanzapine needs to be explored.",

The trial evaluated non-acute adult patients with psychotic disorders treated with a stable olanzapine dose who required a treatment change. Three weeks after RLAI initiation, olanzapine was tapered off over 1 week or 3 weeks. Efficacy and safety measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI-S), Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).",

Sixty subjects between 18 and 65 years of age, who fulfilled the ICD-10 criteria for schizophrenia, were enrolled. Patients' detailed demographic and clinical evaluation was conducted and they were administered efficacy assessment scales (BPRS, PANSS) and safety assessments scale (Simpson Angus Scale, UKU side effect rating scale) at regular intervals of 1 week each throughout the study. The laboratory tests (complete haemogram, electrocardiogram (ECG), lipid profile, liver and renal function tests) were conducted at baseline and after 1-week intervals until 6 weeks of treatment. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either aripiprazole or olanzapine.", 
    "175": "Both aripiprazole and olanzapine led to significant reductions on BPRS and PANSS total score over a period of 6 weeks. Weight gain was observed more frequently in the olanzapine-treated group (22.20%) as compared to aripiprazole (7.70%). More patients in the aripiprazole treatment group required comedications (trihexiphenidyl and lorazepam) than olanzapine recipients.",

This study is the first in an Indian population to have compared aripiprazole and olanzapine.", 
    "177": "We present a case of diltiazem intoxication resulting in repeated asystole after the induction of anesthesia. A 39-year-old man was diagnosed as subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral aneurysm clipping was scheduled on the next day. Electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with complete right bundle branch block. Continuous intravenous administration of diltiazem, nicardipine and midazolam were started for intractable hypertension and tachycardia. In the operating room, electrocardiogram showed atrioventricular nodal rhythm. Nicardipine and midazolam were stopped and anesthesia was induced with thiamylal, fentanyl and vecuronium, and was maintained with sevoflurane. After tracheal intubation, the patient developed asystole, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation was provided immediately. Diltiazem was stopped. Cardiac rhythm was restored 8 min afterwards; however, asystole recurred six times. Temporary cardiac pacing was effective, and percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS), intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP), and continuous hemodiafiltration (CHDF) were initiated. The operation was canceled. On the next day, normal sinus rhythm was restored and the temporary pacing, PCPS, IABP, and CHDF were discontinued. Cerebral aneurysm was treated by endovascular coiling and the patient was discharged from the hospital without sequelae. This case illustrates asystole associated with diltiazem intoxication. It is necessary to consider this potential complication when diltiazem is used.", 
    "178": "Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are potent psychoactive drugs used for their sedative and anxiolytic properties (1, 2). There are two types of benzodiazepine receptors, which have been identified as the central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. The central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) is found exclusively in the central nervous system on the membranes of neurons and is coupled to the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor/chloride channel (3). In contrast, the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is a mitochondrial protein found in brain and peripheral tissues (adrenal gland, heart, lung, kidney, and testis) (4, 5). The brain has lower levels of PBR than do the peripheral tissues. Both glial cells and macrophages contain high levels of PBR (6-8). Increased PBR expression after brain injury or neuroinflammation is associated with microglial activation, such as occurs with the neuronal damage accompanying several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Wernicke\u2019s encephalopathy, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy. PBR has been studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[(11)C]methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([11C]PK11195), an isoquinoline carboxamide with specific PBR antagonistic activity (9). [(11)C]PK11195 is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of microglia and macrophage activation in the brain, lung, and heart.",

Our data show that, under the conditions used, [(3)H]pirenzepine binding was highly selective for the muscarinic M(1) receptor whereas both [(3)H]AF-DX 386 and [(3)H]4DAMP had less discriminatory power. In addition, the data suggest that a marked decrease in [(3)H]pirenzepine binding in BA 9 from a subset of people with schizophrenia is predictive of decreases in muscarinic receptors in other CNS regions. However, there were some region-specific decreases in muscarinic receptors in tissue from people with schizophrenia who were outside this subset. These data add to a growing body of evidence suggesting there are widespread decreases in muscarinic receptors in the CNS of some subjects with schizophrenia, as demonstrated by neuroimaging. Our data have implications for understanding the potential clinical utility of drugs directed at the orthosteric and allosteric sites of muscarinic receptors to treat schizophrenia.", 
    "180": "A clinical study was conducted to compare the use of oral fluid to urine for compliance monitoring of pain patients. Patients (n = 133) undergoing treatment for chronic pain at four clinics participated in the study and provided paired oral fluid and urine specimens. Oral fluid specimens were collected with Quantisal(TM) saliva collection devices immediately following urine collection. Oral fluid specimens were analyzed for 42 drugs and/or metabolites by validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry procedures. Accompanying urine specimens were initially screened by immunoassay and non-negative results were confirmed. Of the 1544 paired tests, 329 (21.3%) drug analytes were positive, and 984 (63.7%) were negative for both specimens resulting in an overall agreement of 85%. There were 83 (5.4%) analyte results that were positive in oral fluid and negative in urine, and 148 (9.6%) were negative in oral fluid and positive in urine for an overall disagreement of 15%. Cohen's Kappa value was 0.64, indicating \"substantial\" agreement. The primary exceptions to agreement were the lower detection rates for hydromorphone, oxymorphone, and benzodiazepines in oral fluid compared to urine. The authors conclude that, overall, oral fluid tests produced comparable results to urine tests with some minor differences in detection rates for different drug classes.", 
    "181": "Drug overdose death rates have increased steadily in the United States since 1979. In 2008, a total of 36,450 drug overdose deaths (i.e., unintentional, intentional [suicide or homicide], or undetermined intent) were reported, with prescription opioid analgesics (e.g., oxycodone, hydrocodone, and methadone), cocaine, and heroin the drugs most commonly involved\u00a0. Since the mid-1990s, community-based programs have offered opioid overdose prevention services to persons who use drugs, their families and friends, and service providers. Since 1996, an increasing number of these programs have provided the opioid antagonist naloxone hydrochloride, the treatment of choice to reverse the potentially fatal respiratory depression caused by overdose of heroin and other opioids. Naloxone has no effect on non-opioid overdoses (e.g.,\u00a0cocaine, benzodiazepines, or alcohol)\u00a0. In October 2010, the Harm Reduction Coalition, a national advocacy and capacity-building organization, surveyed 50 programs known to distribute naloxone in the United States, to collect data on local program locations, naloxone distribution, and overdose reversals. This report summarizes the findings for the 48 programs that completed the survey and the 188 local programs represented by the responses. Since the first opioid overdose prevention program began distributing naloxone in 1996, the respondent programs reported training and distributing naloxone to 53,032 persons and receiving reports of 10,171 overdose reversals. Providing opioid overdose education and naloxone to persons who use drugs and to persons who might be present at an opioid overdose can help reduce opioid overdose mortality, a rapidly growing public health concern.",

All participants completed the eight-week trial, indicating that both drugs were well tolerated. Unfortunately, this study provided little usable data. We excluded a total of 81 studies, 77 studies because they either studied interventions other than antipsychotic medication or because they involved elderly people with chronic - not late-onset - schizophrenia.

Subjects whose convulsions had persisted for more than 5 minutes and who were still convulsing after paramedics arrived were given the study medication by either intramuscular autoinjector or intravenous infusion. The primary outcome was absence of seizures at the time of arrival in the emergency department without the need for rescue therapy. Secondary outcomes included endotracheal intubation, recurrent seizures, and timing of treatment relative to the cessation of convulsive seizures. This trial tested the hypothesis that intramuscular midazolam was noninferior to intravenous lorazepam by a margin of 10 percentage points.",

The two treatment groups were similar with respect to need for endotracheal intubation (14.1% of subjects with intramuscular midazolam and 14.4% with intravenous lorazepam) and recurrence of seizures (11.4% and 10.6%, respectively). Among subjects whose seizures ceased before arrival in the emergency department, the median times to active treatment were 1.2 minutes in the intramuscular-midazolam group and 4.8 minutes in the intravenous-lorazepam group, with corresponding median times from active treatment to cessation of convulsions of 3.3 minutes and 1.6 minutes.

In 1857 of 8709 cases of driving under the influence of drugs, amphetamine-like drugs (amphetamine, methamphetamine, and methylendioxyamphetamine) were present either alone or together with other licit or illicit drugs. In 338 cases, amphetamines were the only psychoactive substance group in plasma at mean, median, and highest concentrations of 0.18, 0.12, and 1.05 mg/L, respectively. A widespread opinion is that after the consumption of amphetamines, centrally stimulating effects with corresponding consequences on safe driving are expected. In contrast, many cases were observed that rather suggested an influence of centrally sedating substances when considering the psycho-physical conditions. Relations between concentration and effect could not be established. The apparent sedation is probably the consequence of sleep deprivation during an amphetamine binge and the after-effects of the drug.", 
    "194": "The anticholinergic effects of 7 benzodiazepines, bromazepam, camazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, lorazepam, medazepam and triazolam, were compared by examining their inhibitory effects on the acetylcholine receptor-operated potassium current (I(K).(ACh)) in guinea-pig atrial myocytes. All of these benzodiazepines (0.3-300 \u00b5M) inhibited carbachol (1 \u00b5M)-induced I(K).(ACh) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ascending order of IC(50) values for carbachol-induced I(K).(ACh) was as follows; medazepam, diazepam, camazepam, triazolam, bromazepam, lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide (>300 \u00b5M). The compounds, except for bromazepam, also inhibited I(K).(ACh) activated by an intracellular loading of 100 \u00b5M guanosine 5'-[\u03b3-thio]triphosphate (GTP\u03b3S) in a concentration-dependent manner. The ascending order of IC(50) values for GTP\u03b3S-activated I(K).(ACh) was as follows; medazepam, diazepam, camazepam, lorazepam, triazolam chlordiazepoxide (>300 \u00b5M) and bromazepam (>300 \u00b5M). To clarify the molecular mechanism of the inhibition, IC(50) ratio, the ratio of IC(50) for GTP\u03b3S-activated I(K).(ACh) to carbachol-induced I(K).(ACh), was calculated. The IC(50) ratio for camazepam, diazepam, lorazepam, medazepam and triazolam was close to unity, while it for chlordiazepoxide could not be calculated. These compounds would act on the GTP binding protein and/or potassium channel to achieve the anticholinergic effects in atrial myocytes. In contrast, since the IC(50) ratio for bromazepam is presumably much higher than unity judging from the IC(50) values (104.0 \u00b1 30.0 \u00b5M for carbachol-induced I(K).(ACh) and >300 \u00b5M for GTP\u03b3S-activated I(K).(ACh), it would act on the muscarinic receptor.

None of the antipsychotic drugs studied altered number of errors in naive mice, whereas MK-801 significantly increased working memory errors in RAM test. Olanzapine and clozapine potently reversed MK-801 induced increasement of working memory errors. Olanzapine and clozapine prolonged latency of the animals in naive mice. The MK-801-induced enhancement in the speed of mice in performing the RAM task was blocked by olanzapine but not clozapine.

    "201": "CO(2) administration is a common euthanasia method for research mice, yet questions remain regarding whether CO(2) euthanasia is associated with pain and stress. Here we assessed whether premedication with acepromazine, midazolam, or anesthetic induction with isoflurane altered behavioral and physiologic parameters that may reflect pain or stress during CO(2) euthanasia. Mice were assigned to 1 of 6 euthanasia groups: CO(2) only at a flow rate of 1.2 L/min which displaces 20% of the cage volume per minute (V/min; control group); premedication with acepromazine (5 mg/kg), midazolam (5 mg/kg), or saline followed by 20% V/min CO(2); induction with 5% isoflurane followed by greater than 100% V/min CO(2) (>6L/min); and 100% V/min CO(2) only (6 L/min). Measures included ultrasonic sound recordings, behavioral analysis of video record- ings, plasma ACTH and corticosterone levels immediately after euthanasia, and quantification of c-fos from brain tissue. Compared with 20% V/min CO(2) alone, premedication with acepromazine or midazolam did not significantly alter behavior but did induce significantly higher c-fos expression in the brain. Furthermore, the use of isoflurane induction prior to CO(2) euthanasia significantly increased both behavioral and neuromolecular signs of stress. The data indicate that compared with other modalities, 20% V/min CO(2) alone resulted in the least evidence of stress in mice and therefore was the most humane euthanasia method identified in the current study.",

Treatment groups included: unmanipulated control, restraint control, dry gavage, and gavage, with all rats singly housed (n = 9 or 10 per group). In addition, a group of pair-housed rats (n = 18) was included to determine whether social housing affected response to gavage. Weekly body weights and food consumption were recorded as well as use of a nylon chew toy for enrichment. Feces were collected biweekly at the end of the light and dark phases for fecal corticoid metabolite determinations. After 28 d of treatment, animals underwent conditioned place preference testing to evaluate sensitivity to motivational properties of the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide (5.6 mg/kg SC). Brain and paired adrenal gland weights were collected at necropsy. Week 2 total fecal corticosterone levels were elevated in all groups and attributed to a fire alarm accidentally tripped during building renovations. No differences occurred in body weight or food consumption between any groups. All groups used a nylon chew toy given for enrichment and demonstrated mild preference for the drug-associated chamber. Fecal weights and corticoid metabolite levels were similar between all groups at week 4 and showed normal diurnal variation. No biologically significant variations were noted in brain or paired adrenal gland to body weight ratios. We conclude that orogastric gavage of aqueous solutions at 5 mL/kg does not negatively affect the welfare of laboratory rats acclimated to handling.",

The charts of all neonates and infants who received DEX in the authors' pediatric CVICU between August 2009 and June 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. The demographic data collected included age, weight, sex, diagnosis, and Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS-1) score. To evaluate the hemodynamic effects of DEX, physiologic data were collected including heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), inotrope score, near-infrared spectroscopy, and central venous pressure (CVP). To assess the efficacy of DEX, the amount and duration of concomitant sedation and analgesic infusions over a period of 24 h were examined together with the number of rescue boluses. The potential side effects evaluated in this study included nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, dysrhythmias, neurologic abnormalities, seizures, and signs and symptoms of withdrawal. During the study period, 50 neonates and infants received DEX for a median period of 78 h (range, 40-290 h). These patients had an average age of 3.53 \u00b1 2.64 months and a weight of 4.85 \u00b1 1.67 kg. Whereas 34 patients (68%) received DEX after surgery for CHD, 15 patients (30%) received DEX after heart transplantation. Of these 50 infants, 10 (20%) had a single-ventricle anatomy, whereas 13 (26%) had a risk adjustment score (RACHS-1) in the category of 4-6. The median CVICU stay was 29 days (range, 8-69 days). Despite a significant decrease in heart rate, MAP, inotrope score, and CVP, all the patients remained hemodynamically stable during DEX infusion. There was no substantial difference in major hemodynamic variables between neonates and infants, single- and two-ventricle repair, RACHS 4-6 and RACHS 1-3 categories for patients undergoing surgery, or patients undergoing heart transplantation and patients undergoing other surgical procedures. Dexmedetomidine infusion for neonates and infants with heart disease is safe from a hemodynamic standpoint and can reduce the concomitant dosing of opioid and benzodiazepine agents. Furthermore, DEX infusion may be useful for reducing vasopressor agent dosing in children with catecholamine-refractory cardiogenic shock.", 
    "216": "This study evaluated the effect of intermittent administration in the development of dependence to diazepam in chronic use of the drug. Gabapentin was used to provide an anxiolytic effect on drug-free days. During a 28-day treatment schedule, rats were given diazepam (15 mg/kg) once daily continuously, or intermittently with saline or gabapentin (50 mg/kg) on days 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed on days 10 and 30 using the elevated plus-maze test and novelty-induced grooming test. Contrary to continuous administration, intermittent diazepam did not provide anxiolytic-like activity on day 10; instead, it prevented withdrawal anxiety on day 30. Gabapentin produced anxiolytic-like effects during the withdrawal period, but not on day 10. These results suggest that intermittent administration of diazepam (given either alone or alternatively with a drug possessing anxiolytic activity) may be of value in preventing the development of physical dependence during the chronic use of the drug. However, further studies are needed to demonstrate that this protocol could effectively produce anxiolytic activity on diazepam-free days.", 
    "217": "Benzodiazepines negatively affect motor coordination and balance and produce myorelaxation. The aim of the present study was to examine the extent to which populations of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) receptors containing \u03b11 and \u03b15 subunits contribute to these motor-impairing effects in rats. We used the nonselective agonist diazepam and the \u03b11-selective agonist zolpidem, as well as nonselective, \u03b11-subunit and \u03b15-subunit-selective antagonists flumazenil, \u03b2CCt, and XLi093, respectively. Ataxia and muscle relaxation were assessed by rotarod and grip strength tests performed 20 min after intraperitoneal treatment. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) induced significant ataxia and muscle relaxation, which were completely prevented by pretreatment with flumazenil (10 mg/kg) and \u03b2CCt (20 mg/kg). XLi093 antagonized the myorelaxant, but not the ataxic actions of diazepam. All three doses of zolpidem (1, 2, and 5 mg/kg) produced ataxia, but only the highest dose (5 mg/kg) significantly decreased the grip strength. These effects of zolpidem were reversed by \u03b2CCt at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. The present study demonstrates that \u03b11 GABAA receptors mediate ataxia and indirectly contribute to myorelaxation in rats, whereas \u03b15 GABAA receptors contribute significantly, although not dominantly, to muscle relaxation but not ataxia."
