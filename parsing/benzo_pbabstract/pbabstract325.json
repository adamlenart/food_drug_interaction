Behavioral dysfunctions were also reported in infants from mothers with high benzodiazepine (BDZ) intake during pregnancy. The present experiment was undertaken to reconsider the potential action of diazepam during ontogeny in order to obtain further information about developmental processes using a refined methodology. Time-pregnant rats were treated subcutaneously with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg/day,: group E1) or with diazepam vehicle (group C1) from gestational day 14 to 20. Other dams (group E2) received the same BDZ dose from the 1st to the 21st day of lactation (weaning) or were not treated, remaining undisturbed in their home cages (group C2). The following results were obtained for animals perinatally treated with diazepam compared to groups C1 and C2: 1--increased time for testis descent and decreased time for vaginal opening (group E2); 2--no changes in the dates for ear end eye opening, or incisor tooth eruption (groups E1 and E2); 3--increased locomotor activity in the open-field (group E2) and/or in the plus maze (groups E1 and E2); 4--decreased levels of anxiety measured in the plus maze (groups E1 and E2); 5--decreased macrophage spreading and phagocytosis (groups E1 and E2). These results, which occurred in the absence of overt signs of maternal or fetal toxicity, demonstrate developmental, neuro- and immunotoxic effects of perinatal diazepam treatment in rats.", 
    "1": "1. Many drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders contain a chiral center or a center of unsaturation and are marketed as a mixture of the resultant enantiomers or geometric isomers, respectively. These enantiomers or geometric isomers may differ markedly with regard to their pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetic properties. 2. Examples of the effects of chiral centers or geometric centers on such properties are given for drugs from the following classes: antidepressants (tricyclics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, viloxazine, bupropion, trazodone, mianserin, venlaflaxine); benzodiazepines, zoplicone, and antipsychotics. 3. As described in this review, there are several notable examples of psychiatric drugs currently available where the individual enantiomers or geometric isomers differ considerably with regard to factors such as effects on amine transport systems, interactions with receptors and metabolizing enzymes, and clearance rates from the body. Indeed, relatively recent developments in analytical and preparative resolution of racemic and geometric drug mixtures and increased interest in developing new drugs which interact with specific targets, which have been described in detail at the molecular level, have resulted in increased emphasis on stereochemistry in drug development.", 
    "2": "N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-type glutamate receptors play important roles at developing synapses and in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. Recent studies in Aplysia suggest that NMDA-like receptors may contribute to some forms of plasticity of sensorimotor synapses accompanying associative learning. We examined at various times after plating neurons in culture the contribution of NMDA- and alpha-amino-3 hydroxy-5 methyl-4 isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA)-like glutamate receptors to responses evoked in motor cell L7 either by action potentials in sensory neurons (SNs) or by focal applications of glutamate. We found that (D,L)-2-amino-5-phosphopentoic acid-sensitive receptors contributed significantly to postsynaptic responses in 1-day cultures but contributed little in the same cultures on day 4. By contrast, postsynaptic responses on day 4 increased significantly in amplitude by the addition of functional 6-cyano-7 nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione- or 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylendioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine hydrochloride-sensitive receptors. Receptors with NMDA-like properties are detected on day 1 only at sites on L7 apposed to SN varicosities, and are not detected on L7 cultured alone. The results indicate that changes in expression and distribution of functional receptors on L7 accompany the formation and maturation of SN synapses. Signals from the SN appear to trigger expression and clustering of functional NMDA-like receptors at sites contacted by presynaptic structures capable of transmitter release. With time, functional AMPA-like receptors are added to these sites enhancing synaptic efficacy. The results are consistent with the idea that the expression and sequential clustering of NMDA- and AMPA-type receptors may be essential for the formation and maturation of central synapses.", 
    "3": "Pregnant women with epilepsy constitute 0.5% of all pregnancies. Proper seizure control is the primary goal in treating women with epilepsy. The commonly used anticonvulsants are established human teratogens. Factors such as epilepsy, anticonvulsant-induced teratogenicity, patient's genetic predisposition and the severity of convulsive disorder may attribute to adverse pregnancy outcome for the children of women with epilepsy. Anticonvulsant interaction with folic acid and phytomenadione (vitamin K) metabolism may lead to an increased risk for neural tube defect and early neonatal bleeding. Psychological, hormonal and pharmacokinetic changes in pregnancy may escalate seizure activity. Preconceptional counselling should include patient education to ensure a clear understanding of risks of uncontrolled seizures and possible teratogenicity of anticonvulsants. Genetic counselling should be performed if both parents have epilepsy or the disease is inherited. Seizure control should be achieved at least 6 months prior to conception and, if clinically possible, by the lowest effective dose of a single anticonvulsant according to the type of epilepsy. The new anticonvulsants are not recommended in pregnancy and require further research to prove their safety in humans. Folic acid 5 mg/day should be administered 3 months before conception and during the first trimester to prevent folic acid deficiency-induced malformations. Antenatal management should include assessment of patients for anticonvulsant-associated birth defects through detailed ultrasound examination and levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoproteins. Therapeutic drug monitoring should be performed monthly, or as clinically indicated. If phenobarbital, carbamazepine or phenytoin is administered, maternal phytomenadione supplementation should begin 4 weeks before the expected date of delivery. In order to prevent convulsions during labour, proper seizure control should be achieved during the third trimester. Benzodiazepines or phenytoin are found to be effective for seizure cessation during labour and delivery. Phytomenadione should be administered immediately after birth to the newborn. The neonate should be assessed carefully for epilepsy and anticonvulsant-associated dysmorphology. Advising the patient on postpartum management regarding contraception and breast-feeding will help maximise the best possible outcome for the newborn and mother. With proper preconceptional, antenatal and postpartum management up to 95% of these pregnancies have been reported to have favourable outcomes.", 
    "4": "Gastrin-recognizing CCK2 receptors are expressed in parietal cells and in so-called ECL cells in the acid-producing part of the stomach. ECL cells are endocrine/paracrine cells that produce and store histamine and chromogranin A (CGA)-derived peptides, such as pancreastatin. The ECL cells are the principal cellular transducer of the gastrin-acid signal. Activation of the CCK2 receptor results in mobilization of histamine (and pancreastatin) from the ECL cells with consequent activation of the parietal cell histamine H2 receptor. Thus, release of ECL-cell histamine is a key event in the process of gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. The oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase (HDC) activity and the serum pancreastatin concentration are useful markers for the activity of the gastrin-ECL cell axis. Powerful and selective CCK2 receptor antagonits have been developed from a series of benzodiazepine compounds. These agents are useful tools to study how gastrin controls the ECL cells. Conversely, the close control of ECL cells by gastrin makes the gastrin-ECL cell axis well suited for evaluating the antagonistic potential of CCK2 receptor antagonists with the ECL-cell HDC activity as a notably sensitive and reliable parameter. The CCK2 receptor antagonists YF476, YM022, RP73870, JB93182 and AG041R were found to cause prompt inhibition of ECL-cell histamine and pancreastatin secretion and synthesis. The circulating pancreastatin concentration is raised, was lowered when the action of gastrin on the ECL cells was blocked by the CCK2 receptor antagonists. These effects were associated with inhibition of gastrin-stimulated acid secretion. In addition, sustained receptor blockade was manifested in permanently decreased oxyntic mucosal HDC activity, histamine concentration and HDC mRNA and CGA mRNA concentrations. CCK2 receptor blockade also induced hypergastrinemia, which probably reflects the impaired gastric acid secretion (no acid feedback inhibition of gastrin release). Upon withdrawal of the CCK2 receptor antagonists, their effects on the ECL cells were readily reversible. In conclusion, gastrin mobilizes histamine from the ECL cells, thereby provoking the parietal cells to secrete acid. While CCK2 receptor blockade prevents gastrin from evoking acid secretion, it is without effect on basal and vagally stimulated acid secretion. We conclude that specific and potent CCK2 receptor antagonists represent powerful tools to explore the functional significance of the ECL cells.", 
    "5": "This study describes the treatments that 253 patients affected by major depressive disorder, according to DSM-III-R criteria, received by their general practitioner prior to their referral to the outpatients clinic of the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Rome \"La Sapienza\". Out of 253 study subjects only 97 had received prescriptions of antidepressant drugs. In about 50% of these cases (corresponding to 27.4% of the study population) prescribed dosages were inadequate. In 34.7% of subjects who sought medical help antidepressants were not prescribed and other psychotropic drugs (mostly benzodiazepines) or pseudodrugs were used. In 6% of cases no treatment was prescribed. Over one third of the outpatients had been ill for over one year prior to their referral to a psychiatrist. Remedial actions are considered.", 
    "6": "Endoscopic manometry of the sphincter Oddi (SO) is a sophisticated method which requires a cooperative patient. Therefore, during endoscopic manometry sufficient i.v. sedation is crucial, and additionally must no affect SO-motility. In a pilot trial SO-motility was determined in ten patients with suspected SO-dysfunction (SOD) under initial sedation with 4.8 +/- 1 mg midazolam (baseline), and 3 min after an i.v. bolus of 50 mg of propofol. In addition, endoscopic manometry was performed in 57 consecutive patients with suspected SOD from 10/94-9/95 under sedation with midazolam (6.2 +/- 1.6 mg), and from 10/95-9/96 with propofol (268 +/- 111 mg). Sedation was always performed by an independent physician according to a standardized protocol. Neither the SO-baseline pressure nor the parameters of phasic SO-motility were significantly altered by propofol (including two patients with proven SOD). Propofol causes a more rapid onset of sedation, and the time interval to obtain successful biliary cannulation was shorter than under midazolam (p < 0.05). Successful manometric recordings could be obtained in 82% of the patients under midazolam but in 96% of the patients under propofol-sedation (p < 0.05), respectively. The patient cooperation was significantly better rated (by the endoscopist) in the propofol group than in the midazolam group (p < 0.01). The blood pressure and the heart rate were not significantly affected in both groups, however, propofol caused a significant decrease of the oxygen saturation (p < 0.05). Accordingly, an apnea episode had to be mastered by mask ventilation via ambu bag in one patient under propofol-sedation (uneventful recovery). In the midazolam group flumazenil-administration was necessary in four patients. The post-procedure recovery was faster after propofol--than after midazolam-sedation (p < 0.05). In conclusion, propofol is suitable for i.v. sedation during endoscopic manometry of the spincter of Oddi.",

The survey was carried out during the months of November and December 1997. Thirty-seven (52.1%) centres were in the NHS sector and 33 (47.8%) in the private sector. A response was available from 60 (84%) centres. A standard questionnaire was used which requested information about the procedures carried out, anaesthetic technique and pharmacological agents used. Forty-seven centres carried out IVF, two centres GIFT and 11 centres both. Out of 58 centres carrying out IVF, sedation was used in 28, general anaesthesia in 17, sedation combined with regional anaesthesia in seven and regional anaesthesia in one. Five centres gave a choice. Out of 22 centres using general anaesthesia for IVF, 12 used inhalational agents (isoflurane eight, enflurane four, sevoflurane two), eight used total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) with propofol and two centres inhalational agents or TIVA. Propofol was the induction agent in all but two centres. For IVF under sedation, 18 centres used midazolam, five used diazepam, three used opioids, one used entonox and the remaining ones a combination. When sedation was combined with regional anaesthesia, four centres used midazolam, two used propofol, one used midazolam with propofol, one used opioids and one used entonox. The regional technique in the 11 centres was either paracervical block with lignocaine (eight) or subarachnoid block with bupivacaine (three). Systemic analgesia was secured with fentanyl (22), pethidine (16), alfentanil (15), diclofenac (14), piroxicam (two), ketorolac (one) and ibuprofen (one). Five centres did not use any opioids; 40 centres did not use any nonsteroidal agents (NSAIDs). Out of the 13 centres that carried out GIFT, 12 used general anaesthesia while the thirteenth gave the patient a choice between general or regional anaesthesia. 11 centres used inhalational agents (isoflurane nine, enflurane two) while two used TIVA with propofol; propofol was the induction agent used in six centres while thiopentone was used in five. The range of analgesics was wide--fentanyl in six centres, alfentanil in three, morphine in two, diclofenac in five and ketorolac in one. Two centres did not use any opioids and seven centres did not use an NSAID. The only agreement at present appears to be that halothane is an unwise choice for IVF. No other technique has yet been proven to be either advantageous or detrimental.",

    "11": "In an open-label noncontrolled investigation, the effect of the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam on PPI was assessed in the absence and presence of the antagonist flumazenil. After an initial control period of 60 min three consecutive periods, each of 60 min, with progressively increasing concentrations of midazolam were studied (0. 02, 0.06, 0.14 mg kg-1 h-1 ). A final 60 min period during the administration of flumazenil (0.004 mg kg-1 h-1 ) and while the agonist was still present was also studied. Drug was administered intravenuously as a combination of bolus, 50% of total dose and continuous infusion over the 60 min period. Electromyographic (EMG) response of the right orbicularis oculi muscle was used to assess the startle response to noise bursts of 50 ms duration (95 dB(A)). Noise bursts were randomly preceded by nonstartling prepulses (800 Hz sinus, 50 ms duration, 65 dB(A), prepulse to noise interval 120 ms). The magnitude of PPI was calculated by dividing the EMG response to nonprepulsed stimuli by the response to prepulsed stimuli for each individual and period. Eleven subjects participated in the study, two of them were excluded from the statistical analysis because startle responses could not be reliably elicited (final sample size n=9).", 
    "12": "The magnitude of PPI was inversely related to the concentration of midazolam. This relationship was described by a sigmoidal Emax model, giving an Emax of 0.65+/-0.13, an ED50 of 33.9+/-10.9 ng ml-1 and gamma of 3.5+/-1.0. During infusion of flumazenil and in the presence of midazolam, the magnitude of PPI increased by 0.11 (95% CI, 0-0.22, P</=0.04), which is consistent with its mode of action as a benzodiazepine antagonist.",

From this extract a proteinaceous complex was purified; its molecular weight was as high as 880 kD. The complex contained both hexokinase and creatine kinase activity. When incorporated into phospholipid bilayer membranes, the complex formed a channel whose activity was different than the channel activity of purified porin isolated either by adsorption chromatography or by dissociation from protein complexes. A ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (Ro5-4864) in submicromolar concentrations had an apparent influence on the kinetic behavior of enzymatic coupling of hexokinase and creatine kinase. It is suggested that the 880-kD complex is formed by mitochondrial contact sites. The role of the isolated protein complex in the formation of nonspecific permeability in mitochondria is discussed.",

In oocytes expressing the M1 receptor, ACh induced the Ca2+-activated C1- current, in a dose-dependent manner (EC50= 114 nM). Propofol (5-50 microM) reversibly and dose-dependently inhibited induction of the Ca2+-activated Cl- current by ACh (100 nM) (IC50=5.6 microM). To determine a possible site affected by propofol in this signal transduction, we tested the effects of this anesthetic (10 microM) on the activation of current by injection of CaCl2 and aluminum fluoride (AlF4-). Propofol did not affect activation of the current by the intracellular injected Ca2+, or activation of the current by the intracellular injected AlF4-. These results indicate that propofol does not affect G protein, the inositol phosphate turnover, release of Ca2+ from Ca2+ store or the Ca2+-activated Cl- channel.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the frequency of aneuploid sperm induced by each of these chemicals by sperm FISH. Male (102/ElxC3H/El)F1 mice were treated with acrylamide (120 and 60 mg/kg single dose i.p.), colchicine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg single dose, i.p.), diazepam (300, 150 and 75 mg/kg single dose by oral intubation) or thiabendazole (100 and 300 mg/kg daily for 11 days by oral intubation).

Lesions of the ILn have been found to produce behavioral effects comparable to benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor agonists. We compared the effects of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), a BDZ agonist, and FG 7142, a partial inverse agonist at the BDZ receptor, in rats with thalamic lesions and in unlesioned controls. Delayed matching-to sample (DMS) performances were studied during treatment with ascending doses of CDP, counterbalanced trials with 2.5 mg/kg CDP and saline, ascending doses of FG 7142, and (for unlesioned controls only) counterbalanced trials with saline and higher doses of CDP. CDP had effects similar to the ILn lesion, decreasing response speed and percent correct responding in a delay-independent fashion. These effects were additive with the impairments associated with the ILn lesion. The effects of FG 7142 were more complex. At lower doses, it increased response speed without affecting response accuracy. At higher doses, it diminished both the speed and the accuracy of DMS responding. These results support the hypothesis that ILn lesions and BDZ agonists have similar effects on DMS performance. The biphasic effects observed for FG 7142 are consistent with other evidence that low doses of this drug enhance while higher doses impair memory performance. Although DMS accuracy was not improved, the enhancement observed for response speed provides evidence that partial inverse BDZ agonists have potential utility as treatments for cognitive impairments associated with amnesia.", 
    "45": "Acute catatonic syndromes occurring in the context of various medical and neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, have been shown to respond well to benzodiazepines (BZD). However, there have been no studies specifically designed to address the BZD treatment response of persistent catatonic states. Eighteen patients with clinically stable chronic schizophrenia, who also displayed enduring catatonic features, underwent a 12-week long, random assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over trial with lorazepam (6 mg/day). A comprehensive assessment, including the subjects' clinical and motor (catatonic as well as drug-induced movement disorders) condition, was performed at baseline and four weekly intervals thereafter. Pre-existing medication was kept constant throughout the study. Lorazepam had no effect on the subjects' catatonic signs and symptoms, suggesting that acute and chronic catatonic syndromes associated with schizophrenic illness might have a different neurobiological basis.", 
    "46": "The inferior colliculus is involved in conveying auditory information of an aversive nature to higher cortical structures. Gradual increases in the electrical stimulation of this structure produce progressive aversive responses from vigilance, through freezing, until escape. Recently, we have shown that microinjections of NMDA into the inferior colliculus mimic these aversive effects and that the neural substrates responsible for learned escape behavior in the inferior colliculus are regulated by GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms. In the present study, we extend these observations showing that unlearned aversive responses are also depressed by muscimol and midazolam, both GABA-benzodiazepine agonists, and that microinjection of glutamate, an excitatory amino acid, into the inferior colliculus can trigger freezing responses. Electrical stimulation of the inferior colliculus of rats placed inside an open field allowed the determination of thresholds for the aversive responses, alertness, freezing and escape. Systemic administration (3 and 5.6 mg/kg) as well as microinjections into the inferior colliculus of the anxiolytic compound midazolam (10, 20 and 40 nmol) caused increases in threshold for these aversive responses. Similar results were obtained following microinjections of the GABA-A agonist muscimol (0.1, 1 and 5 nmol) into this brainstem structure. Microinjections of low doses of glutamate (5 nmol), presumed to activate mainly AMPA/kainate receptors, into the ventrolateral division of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus of rats placed inside a circular arena induced aversive reactions, characterized by freezing responses. However, higher doses of glutamate caused no apparent effects. GDEE, an AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist, inhibited, whereas AP7, a NMDA receptor antagonist, did not influence these responses. It is suggested that GABA-benzodiazepine processes modulate the expression of defensive reactions in the inferior colliculus and that activation of fast-acting excitatory amino acid receptors in this midbrain region can trigger the initial steps of the defense reaction without eliciting the motor explosive behavior usually seen following the activation of NMDA receptors.",

The ability of olanzapine to activate or antagonize a number of neuronal receptors was investigated in vitro, in cell lines transfected selectively with receptor subtypes and in receptor-selective isolated tissue studies. Olanzapine had no agonist activity at any of the receptors examined. However, olanzapine was a potent antagonist of 5-HT-stimulated increases in IP3 in cell lines transfected with 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors with IC50 values of 30-40 nM. Olanzapine weakly blocked 5-HT-induced formation of IP3 in cell lines transfected with 5-HT2c receptors, but in this cell line potently inhibited 5-HT-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding with a Ki value of 15 nM. Olanzapine blocked dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in rat retina with modest potency (Ki = 69 nM), consistent with its relatively low affinity for dopamine D1 receptors. Olanzapine blocked agonist-induced activities at the muscarinic receptor subtypes M1, M2, M3, and M5 with Ki values of 70, 622, 126, and 82 nM, respectively. In studies using cell lines transfected with muscarinic M4 receptors, olanzapine and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine did not have agonist activities as determined with cAMP inhibition and stimulation assays, arachidonic acid release and [35S]GTP gamma S binding assays. However, olanzapine antagonized agonist-induced effects in muscarinic M4 cells with a Ki value of 350 nM. In isolated tissue studies, olanzapine potently blocked agonist-induced effects at alpha 1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (KB = 9 and 19 nM, respectively). Thus, olanzapine was an antagonist at all receptors investigated and was a particularly potent antagonist at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, alpha 1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Olanzapine was a weaker antagonist at muscarinic and dopamine D1 receptors.",

    "73": "Gastrin acts via cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptors to control histamine- and chromogranin A-producing ECL cells, which constitute the quantitatively predominant endocrine cell population in the acid-producing part of the rat stomach. Cholecystokinin-B receptor blockade is known to suppress the activity of ECL cells and to prevent their ability to respond to gastrin stimulation. The present study examines the reversibility of long-standing cholecystokinin-B receptor blockade of ECL cells. YM022, a potent and selective cholecystokinin-B receptor antagonist, was administered in a maximally effective dose by continuous subcutaneous infusion for 4 weeks (via osmotic minipumps). The resulting receptor blockade was manifested in elevated serum gastrin concentration (due to the ensuing acid inhibition), while the serum pancreastatin concentration, oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity, histidine decarboxylase- and chromogranin A- mRNA levels and histamine and pancreastatin concentrations were lowered. After withdrawal of YM022, all these parameters returned to normal after varying lengths of time. The serum gastrin concentration and the oxyntic mucosal histidine decarboxylase activity returned to normal within a week after termination of treatment. The serum pancreastatin concentration and the mucosal histidine decarboxylase- and chromogranin A-mRNA levels returned to normal within 2 weeks of drug withdrawal. The mucosal pancreastatin and histamine concentrations remained unchanged for about a week before gradually returning to control levels within the next two weeks. Hence, the various effects of cholecystokinin-B receptor blockade of the ECL cells are fully reversible within 1-3 weeks of drug withdrawal.", 
    "74": "Previous studies have indicated that peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands inhibit aldosterone secretion in isolated adrenal zona glomerulosa cells although positive responses have been demonstrated in other steroidogenic tissues. In the present study, aldosterone secretion was measured in bovine cells after 6 days of primary culture. At this time, basal aldosterone secretion was very low and cells appeared less sensitive to the steroidogenic effects of extracellular [K+] (maximal response required K+ concentration > 32 mmol/L) but were sensitised to angiotensin II (maximal response achieved with 3 nM) when compared with previous studies with freshly isolated cells. Diazepam concentration in the range 0.1 nM to 1 microM increased basal aldosterone secretion, an effect which was not enhanced by pre-treatment with diazepam. The effects were small compared with those of angiotensin II or K+. Over the same concentration range, diazepam also potentiated the stimulatory effects of sub-maximally effective concentrations of angiotensin II. When cells were treated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL-3) as a source of cholesterol, diazepam and the PBR ligands Ro5-4864 and PK11195 also stimulated aldosterone secretion at nanomolar concentrations. In addition, the conversion of added 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) to aldosterone was increased by nanomolar concentrations of diazepam and Ro5-4864 but inhibited by high micromolar concentrations of these drugs (100 microM). We conclude that adrenocortical responses to PBR ligands are complex. At high concentrations, inhibitory effects involving competition for steroidogenic enzymes and calcium channel blockage predominate. At low concentrations, an enhancement of basal, angiotensin-II and cholesterol-dependent aldosterone synthesis is revealed which may involve a PBR-mediated mitochondrial uptake of cholesterol and DOC.", 
    "75": "The effects of intra-amygdala injection of midazolam (20 nmol) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 8 and 16 nmol) were investigated in rats submitted to the elevated T-maze, a new animal model of anxiety. This test allows the measurement, in the same rat, of conditioned and unconditioned fear/anxiety responses. Both drugs impaired inhibitory avoidance of the open arms of the T-maze (task representing conditioned fear), indicating an anxiolytic effect, but did not change escape performance from one of the open arms (representing unconditioned fear). The results further implicate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine and serotonergic systems within the basolateral/lateral amygdala in the modulation of conditioned anxiety responses.", 
    "76": "gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors comprise a subfamily of ligand-gated ion channels whose activity can be modulated by ligands acting at the benzodiazepine binding site on the receptor. The benzodiazepine binding site was characterized using a site-directed mutagenesis strategy in which amino acids of the alpha5 subunit were substituted by their corresponding alpha1 residues. Given the high affinity and selectivity of alpha1-containing compared with alpha5-containing GABAA receptors for zolpidem, mutated alpha5 subunits were co-expressed with beta2 and gamma2 subunits, and the affinity of recombinant receptors for zolpidem was measured. One alpha5 mutant (bearing P162T, E200G, and T204S) exhibited properties similar to that of the alpha1 subunit, notably high affinity zolpidem binding and potentiation by zolpidem of GABA-induced chloride current. Two of these mutations, alpha5P162T and alpha5E200G, might alter binding pocket conformation, whereas alpha5T204S probably permits formation of a hydrogen bond with a proton acceptor in zolpidem. These three amino acid substitutions also influenced receptor affinity for CL218872. Our data thus suggest that corresponding amino acids of the alpha1 subunit, particularly alpha1-Ser204, are the crucial residues influencing ligand selectivity at the binding pocket of alpha1-containing receptors, and a model of this binding pocket is presented.", 
    "77": "The isozymes CYP1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5 are involved in the majority of all cytochrome P450-mediated drug biotransformations. In this study we investigated the inhibition profiles of CYP1A2 (substrate: caffeine) CYP2D6 (substrate: dextromethorphan), and CYP3A4/5 (substrate: dextrorphan) by cimetidine, ranitidine, and the novel H2-receptor antagonist ebrotidine in human liver microsomes. The inhibitory effect of the drugs on the enzymes activities were as follows: CYP1A2: cimetidine > ranitidine = ebrotidine; CYP2D6: cimetidine > ranitidine = ebrotidine; CYP3A4/5: ebrotidine > cimetidine > ranitidine. The inhibition of CYP3A4/5 enzyme activity by ebrotidine was competitive. To test whether the inhibitory effect of ebrotidine in CYP3A activity was also found in vivo, we analyzed the biodisposition of midazolam in 8 healthy volunteers. Midazolam biodisposition was significantly reduced when administered together with cimetidine (P < .05), whereas no significant inhibition was observed with ebrotidine or ranitidine compared with placebo. Psychomotor performance analysis revealed no significant effect of the observed reduction on midazolam biodisposition. We concluded that patients who are receiving treatment with drugs metabolized through CYP3A may experience enhanced drug effects as a result of pharmacokinetic interaction when treated concomitantly with cimetidine. In contrast, the effect of ranitidine or ebrotidine on CYP3A activity in vivo seems to have little clinical significance.", 
    "78": "In laboratory animals as well as in human beings a depth of anaesthesia, where the subject has no pain or recall of events from the surgery, should be provided. Haemodynamic parameters such as heart rate and blood pressure are not a guarantee for an optimal depth of anaesthesia, especially when using neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA). A number of studies suggest that the Middle Latency Auditory Evoked Potentials (MLAEP) contain information about the state of consciousness in humans. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the AEP could serve as an indicator of depth of anaesthesia in rats. The AEP was elicited with a click stimulus and monitored in an 80 ms window synchronised to the stimulus. The AEP was extracted applying an Auto Regressive Model with Exogenous Input (ARX-model) from which a Depth of Anaesthesia Index (DAI) was calculated. DAI was normalised to 100 while awake and decreasing gradually to a level between 50 and 20 as the rat was anaesthetised. Nine rats were anaesthetised and included in the study. Four doses of Hypnorm vet. and Dormicum were given as a total, each with 5 minutes interval. Clinical signs of the level of anaesthesia were observed simultaneously with the AEP. The results showed that in four rats DAI decreased to a level below 30 while anaesthetised. In the remaining five rats the AEP was only decreased to a level below 45. The results indicated that a simple dosing regimen based on weight was unable to give the same depth of anaesthesia in individual rats. The decrease in the DAI correlated well with the loss of stimulus response. In conclusion, MLAEP could be used as an indicator of depth of anaesthesia in rats during Hypnorm vet. and Dormicum administration. However studies applying other anaesthetic drugs should be carried out, before a conclusion of the general utility of the method can be made.",

    "80": "Nonprecipitated benzodiazepine (BZ) withdrawal has been reported to increase anxiety levels in rats. The present experiment determined if gender or hormonal status would modulate putative changes in anxiety-related behaviors during precipitated BZ withdrawal in rats. Intact and gonadectomized male and female rats were treated for 4 weeks with empty or diazepam (DZ)-filled silastic capsules. Animals were injected with the BZ antagonist flumazenil (RO15-1788; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle, and immediately placed on the elevated plus-maze. Following the 10-min behavioral test, rats were decapitated and trunk blood was collected to measure corticosterone and gonadal hormone levels. During precipitated BZ withdrawal rats showed significantly decreased percent open-arm time; however, this finding was confounded by a significant decrease in activity levels (e.g., closed-arm entries and total-arm entries). Precipitated BZ withdrawal did not significantly attenuate percent open-arm entries, which factors out drug-induced changes in activity levels, compared to vehicle control animals. Overall, the results of this experiment suggest that precipitated BZ withdrawal does not significantly increase anxiety levels when compared to control animals.", 
    "81": "Sleep disorders are a major, although often minimized and underdiagnosed, medical problem. Current therapy is based on the use of hypnotics, mainly benzodiazepines, which disrupt the sleep pattern often suppressing rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep. Here, new types of pharmacological tools such as cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonists are examined. In particular, since the awake-sleep rhythm is mainly altered in old age in humans, the influence of these compounds over REM and non-REM sleep has been studied in aged rats (21 months) vs. young rats (5 months) prepared for electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Basal EEG data indicated that REM and non-REM sleep was reduced in aged rats vs. young rats. GV-150013, a selective CCK-B receptor antagonist, was found to increase REM sleep, as well as non-REM sleep, and therefore total sleep (non-REM + REM) mainly in aged rats. The dose-range of activity (0.5-60 micrograms/kg) together with the evidence that another CCK-B receptor antagonist, L-365,260 (5 micrograms/kg) increased, while devazepide (a CCK-A receptor antagonist; 20 micrograms/kg) decreased non-REM sleep and total sleep time, support the original hypothesis that the activity of GV-150013 on sleep progress through CCK-B receptors. Furthermore, no tolerance was detected after chronic treatments with GV-150013. In contrast, typical EEG modifications (decrease of REM) and the development of tolerance towards benzodiazepines were monitored following chronic treatment with triazolam (400 micrograms/kg). These results suggest that the CCKergic compounds studied are involved via a different mechanism of action than benzodiazepines in the modulation of the awake-sleep rhythm. A further observation is that the total sleep time recorded in aged rats after treatment with GV-150013 reached the value of the total sleep time of young untreated rats also prepared for EEG. Finally, this work suggests that CCK receptor antagonists, GV-150013 in particular, are more effective in aged resulting in an improvement of sleep quality towards that of young rats.", 
    "82": "The conventional method of inducing status epilepticus by injecting pilocarpine 24 h after lithium chloride (LiCl) administration lacks kinetic correlate. Therefore, the present study was conducted to see the effect of altering the time schedule of lithium administration (from 2 to 72 h) on the convulsive behavior in response to pilocarpine challenge in rats. It was observed that reducing the pretreatment time of lithium from 24 to 2 h produced convulsions in 100% of the rats. However, incidence of convulsions decreased when lithium pretreatment time was increased to 48 h and no convulsions were recorded with 72-h lithium time schedule. The neuronal damage assessed histologically and the effectiveness of diazepam was similar irrespective of time schedule. This study provides evidence that LiCl pretreatment schedule can be adopted at any time between 2 to 24 h to suit the convenience and objectives of the experiment.", 
    "83": "The effects of two selective CCK(B) agonists, BC 264 and BC 197, on memory processes were investigated in rats using a recently developed two-trial recognition memory task. Control animals showed recognition memory after a 2 but not a 6 h time interval between the two trials, thus allowing a memory impairing (2 h) or improving (6 h) effect of pharmacological treatments to be measured. Drugs were injected i.p. before the second trial (retrieval phase). This experimental procedure was first studied with scopolamine and DL-amphetamine, for which a significant deficit after a 2 h interval or improvement after a 6 h interval of performance was observed, respectively. The CCK(B) agonist, BC 264, was ineffective after a 2 h time interval, whereas the dose of 0.3 microg/kg significantly enhanced performance after a 6 h inter-trial interval. In contrast, BC 197 (30 microg/kg) produced a significant disruption of performance after a 2 h inter-trial interval but was without effect after a 6 h time interval. The effects of the two CCK(B) agonists were abolished by pretreatment with a selective CCK(B) antagonist, L365,260 but not by a selective CCK(A) antagonist, L364,718. The present results suggest that CCK(B) receptors display functional heterogeneity and that CCK(B) agonists like BC 264 could offer a new perspective for the treatment of attentional and/or memory deficits.", 
    "84": "Many mentally ill women want to breast-feed their babies but, if they are taking psychotropic drugs, there is very little systematic data upon which to base decisions about whether or not it is safe to do so. We therefore attempt to provide a comprehensive and critical summary of existing case reports and of studies of breast-feeding in relation to commonly used psychotropic drugs. The literature review focuses on the following drugs: antidepressants: tricyclics and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs); antipsychotic drugs: chlorpromazine, perphenazine, haloperidol and clozapine; mood stabilizers: lithium and carbamazepine; and benzodiazepines. The research literature consists mainly of single case reports and there have been very few attempts at controlled, longitudinal investigations. Findings are often difficult to compare because of differences in methods or because of lack of key information. Most data are available about the tricyclic antidepressants but even here we have found that the reports cover only a grand total of 66 mother-infant pairs. Dilemmas about whether or not to contraindicate breast-feeding arise most commonly in relation to postnatal depression. The findings to date suggest that provided that infants are healthy at the outset it is likely that the benefits of breast-feeding will outweigh potential hazards if their mothers are taking established tricyclic drugs at recommended dose levels. Much less is known about risks associated with SSRI antidepressants or about antipsychotic drugs such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones or mood stabilizers such as carbamazepine, all of which enter breast-milk. Safeguards are suggested for future single case studies, which, as they accumulate, will provide a platform for mounting controlled prospective studies properly to test for any acute toxic effects and for possible long-term adverse effects of such drugs on infants' development. Appendix 1 is a review of assay methods. Appendix 2 examines pharmacokinetic factors in newborn preterm and sick infants with special reference to contraindications to breast-feeding. Appendix 3 is a review of methods for assessing infant health and development.", 
    "85": "Zolpidem is an imidazopyridine hypnotic with preferential binding affinity for the omega1-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor. The present double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of orally administered zolpidem (15mg/70kg) on specific memory functions in 16 healthy volunteers using a battery of word and picture memory tasks. Relative to placebo, zolpidem significantly impaired memory for material presented after drug administration when memory was assessed directly by referring subjects back to the prior study episode (explicit memory: recall and recognition) but not when memory was assessed indirectly by evaluating subjects' ability to identify degraded versions of studied stimuli (implicit memory: fragment completion). Zolpidem did not impair explicit memory for material presented before drug administration or memory for previously acquired knowledge (semantic memory: categorization). There was evidence suggesting that zolpidem enhanced explicit and implicit memory for material presented before drug administration and that zolpidem produced a specific deficit in the acquisition of contextual information about material presented after drug administration. Despite zolpidem's unique pharmacological profile, the observed selectivity of zolpidem's memory-impairing effects for particular functions appears qualitatively similar to the selectivity observed with classic BZDs in previous studies.",

    "90": "We have previously reported that brain sensitivity to thiopental with respect to electroencephalogram (EEG) is enhanced in uranyl acetate pretreated renal dysfunction rats. The results were attributed to pharmacodynamic factors. In this study, in vivo EEG and in vitro binding studies for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex were performed to investigate the mechanism of the enhanced effect of thiopental. The receptor binding properties in the brain membrane from normal and renal dysfunction rats were examined using [3H]tertbutylbicycloorthobenzoate (TBOB), [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol. The effect of plasma dialysate from normal (ND) and renal dysfunction rats (RDD) on the thiopental induced EEG and receptor binding were also examined to confirm the role of endogenous compounds. The intrinsic receptor binding characteristics of various sites and their allosteric interaction with thiopental was similar in membrane preparations from normal and renal dysfunction rats. However, RDD, when compared to ND, enhanced the EEG induced by thiopental. At the receptor level, RDD significantly enhanced the thiopental induced inhibition of TBOB. No difference was found between the influence of ND and RDD on the interaction between thiopental and flunitrazepam or muscimol binding. These results showed that the thiopental induced allosteric inhibition of TBOB binding was potentiated by some endogenous compounds in RDD and suggests that this action might be the mechanism, at least in part, for the increased sensitivity of thiopental in renal dysfunction rats.", 
    "91": "Patients with primary insomnia typically complain of daytime fatigue and stress and have been shown to have long latencies on the Multiple Sleep Latency Test and increased whole body metabolism. However, typical treatment strategies for patients with insomnia rarely include any component to deal with these daytime symptoms. In the present study it was hypothesized that a 24-h treatment, lorazepam 0.5 mg TID, would be superior to an evening treatment, lorazepam 1.5 mg HS, in patients with primary insomnia. In a repeated measures crossover design, 12 patients with chronic insomnia received placebo or lorazepam 0.5 mg TID in one 4-night lab stay and placebo or lorazepam 1.5 mg HS in another lab stay. Both doses of medication were effective in improving objective and subjective measures of sleep and in reducing nocturnal whole body metabolic rate. Latencies on daytime nap testing were significantly reduced from a 14-min average to an average of 10 and 12 min, respectively, in the lorazepam 0.5 and 1.5 mg conditions. Significant differences were not found on psychomotor performance. Subjective reports of anxiety and confusion were increased in the morning after receiving lorazepam 0.5 mg in the evening but tension was reduced and subjective alertness was improved in the evening after daytime administration of lorazepam 0.5 mg. It was concluded that measurement and treatment of daytime symptoms is appropriate in patients with chronic insomnia but that rebounds in anxiety near the end of metabolic activity of lorazepam may make it a poor treatment choice.", 
    "92": "Whole-cell voltage clamp recordings have been used to identify and characterise inward currents mediated by native kainate receptors in rat cultured cerebellar granule cells. While the selective AMPA receptor antagonist GYKI 53655 (50 microM) completely abolished inward currents evoked by AMPA (10-100 microM) in the presence of cyclothiazide (100 microM), kainate evoked currents in cells pretreated with concanavalin A (Con A) always showed a component (35-140 pA, n = 13) resistant to blockade. The majority (73+/-7%, n = 5) of GYKI 53655-resistant kainate-evoked inward currents remained in the presence of 100 microM AMPA. However, these currents were reversibly blocked by the competitive AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX (100 microM). (2S, 4R)-4-methylglutamate (SYM 2081, 10 microM) evoked inward currents in Con A treated cells (15-60 pA, n = 7), which were resistant to complete blockade by GYKI 53655 (50 microM) but antagonised by NBQX (100 microM). Kainate-evoked responses in the presence of GYKI 53655 (50 microM) had linear or slightly outwardly rectifying current-voltage (I-V) relationships in all cells examined (n = 5) and were resistant to blockade by Joro spider toxin (JsTx, 1 microM; n = 5). These results provide evidence that rat cultured cerebellar granule cells express functional kainate receptors made up of subunits which are edited at the Q/R site, and that SYM 2081 is an agonist at these native kainate receptors with a greater selectivity than kainate itself.", 
    "93": "The effect on memory processes of inactivation of the M1 gene by an antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (aODN) was investigated in the mouse passive avoidance test. Mice received a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of M1 aODN (0.3, 1.0 or 2.0 nmol per injection), degenerated ODN (dODN) or vehicle on days 1, 4 and 7. An amnesic effect, comparable to that produced by antimuscarinic drugs, was observed 12, 24, 48 and 72 h after the last i.c.v. aODN injection, whereas dODN and vehicle, used as controls, did not produce any effect. Reduction in the entrance latency to the dark compartment induced by aODN disappeared 7 days after the end of aODN treatment, which indicates the absence of any irreversible damage or toxicity caused by aODN. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that a decrease in M1 mRNA levels occurred only in the aODN-treated group, being absent in all control groups. Furthermore, a reduction in M1 receptors was observed in the hippocampus of aODN-treated mice. Neither aODN, dODN nor vehicle produced any behavioral impairment of mice. These results indicate that the integrity and functionality of M1 receptors are fundamental in the modulation of memory processes.", 
    "94": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the site of the primary mammalian circadian clock, contains one of the densest serotonergic terminal plexes in the brain. Although this fact has been appreciated for some time, only in the last decade has there been substantial approach toward the understanding of the function of serotonin in the circadian rhythm system. The intergeniculate leaflet, which projects to the SCN via the geniculohypothalamic tract, receives serotonergic innervation from the dorsal raphe nucleus, and the SCN receives its serotonergic input from the median raphe nucleus. This separation of serotonergic origins provides the opportunity to investigate the function of the two projections. Loss of serotonergic neurones of the median raphe yields earlier onset and later offset of the nocturnal activity phase, longer duration of the activity phase, and increased sensitivity of circadian rhythm response to light. Despite the simplicity of the origins of serotonergic anatomy with respect to the circadian rhythm system, the actual involvement of serotonin in rhythm modulation is not so obvious. A variety of pharmacological studies have clearly implicated serotonin as a direct regulator of circadian rhythm phase, but others employing different methods suggest that simple elevation of SCN serotonin concentrations does not modify rhythm phase. The most convincing role of serotonin is its apparent ability to modulate sensitivity of the circadian rhythm to light. The putative method for such modulation is via a presynaptic 5-HT1B receptor on the retinohypothalamic tract, the activation of which attenuates photic input to the SCN thereby reducing phase response to light. Serotonin may modulate phase response to benzodiazepines, but does not appear to modify such response to environmentally induced locomotor activity. Current interest in serotonergic modulation of circadian rhythmicity is strong and the research is vigorous. There is an abundance of information about serotonin and circadian rhythm function that lacks a satisfactory framework for its interpretation. The next decade is likely to see the gradual evolution of this framework as the role of serotonin in circadian rhythm regulation is further elucidated.",

Venous blood samples were obtained before introduction as a control and 0.5, 1, 3, 5 min after the administration of midazolam-ketamine in order to measure the plasma histamine level. In addition, any observed hemodynamic changes were simultaneously recorded. The plasma histamine level was measured using the HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) post-label system.",

NZP was discontinued if there was < 50% seizure reduction or significant side effects. In some patients with > 50% reduction, it also was discontinued for lack of sufficient effect. At the end of follow-up for this study, 62 patients remained taking NZP. Patients took NZP from 3 days to 10 years.", 
    "102": "Twenty-one of 302 patients died after institution of NZP. Fourteen of 21 of these were taking NZP at death, and in five of 21, the NZP had been discontinued. Two patients were excluded from analysis, because it is unclear whether NZP had been discontinued before death. Six other patients were lost from follow-up. Of the 14 deaths with NZP, seven were sudden, six were of pneumonia, and one was of cystinosis. Nine had at least one contributing factor, such as dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, or recurrent aspirations. The 294 patients took NZP for a total of 704 patient years (ptyrs), and were discontinued for a total of 856 ptyrs. There were 1.98 deaths/ 100 ptyrs on NZP compared with 0.58 deaths/100 ptyrs without NZP, most of the former being associated with side effects of NZP. Mortality in patients younger than 3.4 years was 3.98 with NZP compared with 0.26 deaths/100 ptyrs without NZP (p = 0.0002).

    "104": "We used fura-2 microfluorometry to investigate the role of mitochondria in regulating the increase in the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca]in) and the mechanism(s) underlying the subsequent Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. The rate of [Ca]in decay during and following stimulation with 100 mM KCl depolarization was markedly increased when the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger was inhibited by clonazepam or CGP-37157(CGP). In contrast, the addition of gramicidin, which increased the cytosolic Na+ concentration, following KCl depolarization caused a secondary increase in [Ca]in. This secondary increase in [Ca]in was prevented by the addition of clonazepam or CGP, and by the removal of external Na+. The subsequent removal of clonazepam or CGP, or the delayed addition of Na+ caused a slow increase in [Ca]in. A protonophore (FCCP) applied following KCl depolarization also caused a robust, secondary increase in [Ca]in, which was insensitive to blocking by clonazepam or CGP. Neither gramicidin nor FCCP altered the [Ca]in decay when applied following stimulation with histamine or caffeine, which mobilized Ca2+ from intracellular stores. These results suggest that the large [Ca]in increase induced by Ca2+ influx, but not by intracellular Ca2+ release, is buffered by mitochondria, and that the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger makes a major contribution to the subsequent Ca2+ efflux from mitochondria.",

    "106": "Glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated in a variety of acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases but early phase clinical trials with competitive antagonists at both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptors and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors have been disappointing. A family of atypical 2,3 benzodiazepines, exemplified by GYKI 52466, have been described recently which function as non-competitive AMPA-receptor antagonists. We have investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of LY303070 and LY300164, two analogs of GYKI-52466, in an embryonic rat hippocampal culture model of non-NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxicity using kainic acid (KA) as an agonist at the AMPA/KA receptor. Overnight treatment with 500 microM KA resulted in prominent neuronal excitotoxicity as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase efflux. LY300164 and LY303070 attenuated KA-excitotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50s of 4 and 2 microM, respectively. In contrast, their stereoisomers, LY300165 and LY303071 showed no neuroprotection at concentrations up to 25 microM. In addition, AMPA-mediated excitotoxicity in cyclothiazide pre-treated cultures was also completely blocked by LY303070. Finally, neuroprotection by this class of 2,3 benzodiazepines was not influenced by antagonism of the classical benzodiazepine receptor. LY303070 and LY300164 represent novel non-competitive AMPA-receptor antagonists which may offer unique advantages in the clinic over competitive AMPA-receptor antagonists.", 
    "107": "Effects of status epilepticus and chronic temporal lobe epilepsy on benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor binding in the rat brain were evaluated using in vitro autoradiography, 24 h and 40 days after kainic acid (KA) administration (10 mg/kg i.p). One day after KA-induced status epilepticus and in comparison to saline control group, significantly increased BDZ binding was detected in pyriform cortex (53%), whereas decreased binding was found in anterior amygdaloid nucleus (28%), fields CA1-3 of Ammon's horn (25%) and dentate gyrus (27%). Forty days after status epilepticus, significantly BDZ binding augmentation was noticed in dentate gyrus (65%) and in periaqueductal gray dorsolateral (52%), whereas decreased binding was found in medial thalamic nucleus (70%). Our data indicate different patterns of BDZ binding following KA administration, which may depend on the consequences of the status epilepticus (24 h after KA) and temporal lobe epilepsy (40 days after KA) per se.",

    "109": "The gamma subunit of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)-R) is essential for bestowing both normal single channel conductance and sensitivity to benzodiazepines on native GABA(A)-Rs. The long splice variant of the gamma2 subunit (gamma2L) has been postulated to be essential in mediating the modulatory actions of ethanol at the GABA(A)-R. In order to evaluate this hypothesis, gene targeting was used to delete the 24bp exon which distinguishes gamma2L from the short splice variant (gamma2S). Mice homozygous for this exon deletion (gamma2L-/-) are viable and indistinguishable from wild-type (gamma2L+/+) mice. No gamma2L mRNA was detected in these mice, nor could gamma2L-containing GABA(A)-R protein be detected by specific antibodies. Radioligand binding studies showed the total amount of gamma2 subunit protein to be not significantly changed, suggesting that gamma2S replaces gamma2L in the brains of the knockout animals. Electrophysiological recordings from dorsal root ganglion neurons revealed a normal complement of functional receptors. There was no difference in the potentiation of GABA currents by ethanol (20-200 mM) observed in neurons from gamma2L+/+ or gamma2L-/- mice. Several behavioral effects of ethanol, such as sleep time, anxiolysis, acute functional tolerance, chronic withdrawal hyperexcitability and hyperlocomotor activity were also unaffected by genotype. It is concluded that gamma2L is not required for ethanol's modulatory action at the GABA(A)-R or whole animal behavioral effects.", 
    "110": "In vivo microdialysis was used to measure the effects of partial deafferentation of cortical cholinergic inputs on acetylcholine efflux in young (four to seven months) and aged (24-28 months) male F344/BNNIA rats. Partial deafferentation was produced by bilateral infusions of the immunotoxin 192 immunoglobulin G-saporin (0.56 microg/1.0 microl) or its vehicle solution into the ventral pallidum/substantia innominata region of the basal forebrain. The lesion produced comparable (65%) decreases in basal cortical acetylcholine efflux in young and aged rats. Presentation of a complex environmental stimulus (exposure to darkness/palatable food), in conjunction with the systemic administration of the benzodiazepine receptor weak inverse agonist ZK 93 426, increased cortical acetylcholine efflux in young shams, aged shams and young lesioned rats, but not in aged lesioned rats. Administration of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist FG 7142, in the absence of the environmental stimulus, comparably stimulated cortical acetylcholine efflux in young and aged sham rats. FG 7142-induced increases in acetylcholine efflux were attenuated by approximately 50% following partial deafferentation in both young and aged rats. These results suggests that, under certain conditions, ageing potently interacts with the integrity of the cortical cholinergic afferent system. The effects of ageing on cortical cholinergic function may be most potently revealed by experiments assessing age-related limitations in the responsiveness of a partially deafferented cholinergic system to certain behavioral and/or pharmacological stimuli.", 
    "111": "The goal of anesthesia in the ambulatory management of fractures in children is to provide analgesia and relieve anxiety in order to facilitate successful closed treatment of the skeletal injury. Numerous techniques short of general anesthesia are available. These methods include blocks (local, regional, and intravenous), sedation (conscious and deep), and dissociative anesthesia (ketamine sedation). Important factors in choosing a particular technique include ease of administration, efficacy, safety, cost, and patient and parent acceptance. Local and regional techniques, such as hematoma, axillary, and intravenous regional blocks, are particularly effective for upper-extremity fractures. Sedation with inhalation agents, such as nitrous oxide, and parenterally administered narcotic-benzodiazepine combinations, are not region-specific and are suitable for patients over a wide range of ages. Ketamine sedation is an excellent choice for children less than 10 years old. With any technique, proper monitoring and adherence to safety guidelines are essential.", 
    "112": "1. We have investigated the binding of a novel radiolabelled CCKB/gastrin receptor ligand, [3H]-JB93182 (5[[[(1S)-[[(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)amino]carbonyl]-2-phenylethyla mino]-carbonyl]-6-[[(1-adamantylmethyl) amino]carbonyl]-indole), to sites in rat cortex membranes. 2. The [3H]-JB93182 was 97% radiochemically pure as assessed by reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and was not degraded by incubation (150 min) with rat cortex membranes. 3. Saturation analysis indicated that [3H]-JB93182 labelled a homogeneous population of receptors in rat cortex membranes (pKD=9.48+/-0.08, Bmax=3.61+/-0.65 pmol g(-1) tissue, nH=0.97+/-0.02, n=5). The pKD was not significantly different when estimated by association-dissociation analysis (pKD=9.73+/-0.11; n=10). 4. In competition studies, the low affinity of the CCKA receptor antagonists, L-364,718; SR27897 and 2-NAP, suggest that, under the assay conditions employed, [3H]-JB93182 (0.3 nM) does not label CCKA receptors in the rat cortex. 5. The affinity estimates obtained for reference CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonists were indistinguishable from one of the affinity values obtained when a two site model was used to interpret [125I]-BH-CCK8S competition curves obtained in the same tissue (Harper et al., 1999). 6. This study provides further evidence for the existence of two CCKB/gastrin sites in rat cortex. [3H]-JB93182 appears to label selectively sites previously designated as gastrin-G1 and therefore it may be a useful compound for the further discrimination and characterization of these putative receptor subtypes.", 
    "113": "1. The previously described complex behaviour of the CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonist, L-365,260, in radioligand binding assays could be explained by a variable population of two binding sites. We have investigated whether other CCKB/gastrin receptor ligands (PD134,308, PD140,376, YM022 and JB93182) can distinguish between these sites. 2. In the mouse cortex assay, Hill slopes were not different from unity and the ligand pKI values did not differ when either [125I]-BH-CCK-8S or [3H]-PD140,376 was used as label as expected for a single site (G2). 3. In the rat cortex, where previous analysis of replicate (n=48) L-365,260 data indicated the presence of two CCKB/gastrin sites (G1 and G2), the competition data for PD134,308, PD140,376, YM022 and JB93182 could be explained by a homogeneous population of CCKB/gastrin sites because the Hill slope estimates were not significantly different from unity. However, the estimated affinity values for JB93182 and YM022 were significantly higher and that for PD134,308 was significantly lower than those obtained in the mouse cortex when the same radioligand was used. In view of our previous data obtained with L-365,260, the rat cortex data were also interpreted using a two-site model. In this analysis, SR27897 expressed approximately 9 fold, PD134,308 approximately 13 fold and PD140,376 approximately 11 fold selectivity for the G2 site. In contrast, JB93182 expressed approximately 23 fold and YM022 approximately 4 fold selectivity for the G1 site. If the two-site interpretation of the data is valid then, because of its reverse selectivity to L-365,260, JB93182 has been identified as a compound which if radiolabelled could provide a test of this receptor subdivision.", 
    "114": "The GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites on GABA(A) receptors are allosterically coupled. The in vitro binding of 2 nM [3H]flunitrazepam to cortical and cerebellar membranes prepared from drug-naive rats was potentiated approximately 1.6-fold by 100 microM GABA. Potentiation in both regions was significantly reduced 4 or 12 but not 24 h after a single dose of 15 mg/kg diazepam. At 24 h after the last of 14 daily doses of diazepam, no differences in GABA potentiation were observed. Diazepam-induced changes in GABA(A) receptor gamma2-subunit gene transcription and alpha1-, beta2-, and gamma2-subunit steady-state mRNA levels did not appear to be temporally related to allosteric uncoupling.", 
    "115": "Relatively few effective therapies exist for the multitude of disorders that comprise dementia, a clinical syndrome manifested by impairments in cognition, language and memory. Treatment of Alzheimer s disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a primary goal of research in cognitive enhancement. However, despite intense research, effective pharmacological interventions remain to be developed. The preponderance of pharmacological strategies which are being pursued in AD research attempt to relieve cognitive and memory deficits which are attributed to cholinergic dysfunction. This paper briefly reviews the status of other efforts that have in common the potential to enhance the use-dependent activity of multiple neurotransmitters system through the modulation of gated ion channels. Discussed are recent advances in the areas of: 1) g-aminobutyric acid subtype A receptor/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) inverse agonists; 2) nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists; 3) serotonin subtype 3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonists; and 4) potassium (K+) M-channel inhibitors.", 
    "116": "Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the decrease in drug biotransformation in hepatic failure depends on the metabolic pathways involved. To test whether glucuronidation reactions supported by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are differentially affected in such conditions, we investigated the in vitro glucuronidation of four selected drugs and xenobiotics (zidovudine, oxazepam, lamotrigine, and umbelliferone) by using microsomes from human healthy and unhealthy (cirrhosis, hepatitis) livers as enzyme sources. Theses substances are glucuronidated by several UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms. Lidocaine N-deethylation activity measured concomitantly was used as a positive control, because the inhibition of this reaction in patients with hepatic diseases is well documented. The metabolic clearances of zidovudine and lidocaine were decreased significantly in liver cirrhosis (0.17 versus 0.37 microliter/min/mg protein and 0.40 versus 2.73 microliter/min/mg protein, respectively) as a consequence of a decrease of their corresponding Vmax of metabolism. By contrast, the metabolic clearances of oxazepam, umbelliferone, and lamotrigine glucuronidation remained unchanged. Previous studies reported that the in vivo oral clearances of zidovudine and lidocaine were decreased by 70% and 60%, respectively, in cirrhotic livers, whereas those of lamotrigine and oxazepam were not affected. Consequently, it is likely that the in vitro metabolic data, which support the in vivo results, therefore could contribute to reasonably predict the level of impairment of hepatic clearance in patients with liver cirrhosis.", 
    "117": "It has been suggested that the binding of a drug to plasma proteins will influence the intestinal extraction efficiency when drug is delivered to the mucosal epithelium via either the gut lumen or vasculature. We evaluated this hypothesis using cytochrome P-450 (CYP)3A4-expressing Caco-2 monolayers as a model for the intestinal epithelial barrier and midazolam as a CYP3A-specific enzyme probe. The rate of 1'-hydroxylation was measured following apical or basolateral midazolam administration to monolayers incubated in the presence or absence of 4 g/dl of human serum albumin (HSA) in the basolateral compartment medium. The midazolam-free fraction in culture medium containing HSA was 3.3%. Inclusion of HSA in the basolateral medium decreased peak intracellular midazolam accumulation after an apical midazolam dose (3 microM) by 35% and reduced the 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation rate by approximately 20%. Because of the accelerated diffusion of midazolam through the cell monolayer and into the basolateral compartment, there was a 61% reduction in the first-pass metabolic extraction ratio: 13.3 +/- 0. 12% for control versus 5.2 +/- 1% with HSA. Compared with control, addition of HSA resulted in a 91% decrease in the peak intracellular midazolam level and a 86% decrease in the rate of 1'-hydroxylation after the administration of midazolam into basolateral medium. These findings suggest that, in vivo, binding of a drug to plasma proteins will impact both first-pass and systemic intestinal midazolam extraction efficiency. Furthermore, the effect will be more pronounced for a drug that is delivered to mucosal enterocytes by way of arterial blood, compared with oral drug delivery.", 
    "118": "Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 3A4 accounts for approximately 50% of all P-450s found in the small intestine (Paine et al., 1997) and contributes to the extensive and variable first-pass extraction of drugs such as cyclosporine and saquinavir. We recently demonstrated that CYP3A4 expression in a differentiated Caco-2 subclone is increased when cell monolayers are treated with 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-vitamin-D3 (Schmiedlin-Ren et al., 1997). This improved metabolic capacity permits the in vitro modeling of first-pass intestinal metabolic kinetics. Midazolam (MDZ) 1'-hydroxylation was used as a specific probe for CYP3A-mediated metabolism in modified Caco-2 monolayers. Caco-2 cells were grown to confluence on laminin-coated culture inserts, and then for two additional weeks in the presence of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy vitamin-D3. Cell monolayers were subsequently exposed to MDZ for varying lengths of time and concentrations. The amount of MDZ in the monolayer increased rapidly after apical drug administration, reaching a pseudo steady state within 6 min. The cellular uptake rate was considerably slower after a basolateral dose. By either route of administration, the rate of 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation was stable and linear for 2 h. Under basolateral sink conditions and low apical MDZ dosing concentration (1-8 microM), the first-pass extraction ratio was found to be approximately 15%. Higher dosing concentrations led to saturation of the hydroxylation reaction and reduction in the extraction ratio. The modified Caco-2 cell monolayer is an excellent model for studying drug absorption and first-pass intestinal metabolic kinetic processes. In this system, the selective CYP3A probe MDZ was rapidly absorbed, yet extensively metabolized, as is observed in vivo.", 
    "119": "The pharmacodynamic interaction between midazolam and its active metabolite alpha-OH-midazolam was investigated to evaluate whether estimates of relevant pharmacodynamic parameters are possible after administration of a mixture of the two. Rats were administered 10 mg/kg of midazolam, 15 mg/kg of alpha-OH-midazolam, or a combination of 3.6 mg/kg of midazolam and 35 mg/kg of alpha-OH-midazolam. Increase in the 11.5- to 30-Hz frequency band of the electroencephalogram was used as the pharmacodynamic endpoint. The pharmacodynamics of midazolam and alpha-OH-midazolam after combined administration were first analyzed according to an empirical and a competitive interaction model to evaluate each model's capability in retrieving the pharmacodynamic estimates of both compounds. Both models failed to accurately estimate the true pharmacodynamic estimates of midazolam and alpha-OH-midazolam. The pharmacodynamic interaction was subsequently analyzed according to a new mechanism-based model. This approach is based on classical receptor theory and allows estimation of the in vivo estimated receptor affinity and intrinsic in vivo drug efficacy. The relationship between stimulus and effect is characterized by a monotonically increasing function f, which is assumed to be identical for midazolam and alpha-OH-midazolam. The pharmacodynamic interaction is characterized by the classical equation for the competition between two substrates for a common receptor site. This mechanism-based interaction model was able to estimate the pharmacodynamic parameters of both midazolam and alpha-OH-midazolam with high accuracy. It is concluded that pharmacodynamic parameters of single drugs can be estimated after a combined administration when a mechanistically valid interaction model is applied.", 
    "120": "An assay for measuring agonist-stimulated [35S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPgamma35S) binding to heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins was developed for use in 96-well format using commercially available anti-G protein antibodies captured by anti-IgG-coated scintillation proximity assay beads. Use of an anti-Galphaq/11 antibody to measure GTPgamma35S binding mediated by M1, M3, and M5 receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulted in a marked increase in agonist-stimulated/basal binding ratio compared with whole membrane binding. Pertussis toxin (PTX) treatment of CHO M1 cells before membrane preparation resulted in a marked reduction in agonist-stimulated GTPgamma35S binding to whole membranes. Direct coupling of M1 receptors in CHO cells to inhibitory G proteins was demonstrated using an anti-Galphai(1-3) antibody, and this binding was inhibited by 76% following PTX treatment. However, PTX had no effect on M1-mediated binding determined using anti-Galphaq/11. CHO M2 receptors mediated robust agonist-stimulated GTPgamma35S binding measured with anti-Galphai(1-3), but coupled only weakly to Galphaq/11. Using membranes from rat striatum, GTPgamma35S binding stimulated by oxotremorine M was demonstrated using anti-Galphaq/11, anti-Galphai(1-3), and anti-Galphao antibodies. Agonist-stimulated binding to striatal membranes showed a marked antibody-dependent GDP requirement with robust signals obtained using 0.1 microM GDP for anti-Galphaq/11 compared with 50 microM GDP for anti-Galphai(1-3) and anti-Galphao. The potencies observed for pirenzepine and AFDX 116 blockade of agonist-stimulated GTPgamma35S binding to striatal membranes determined with anti-Galphaq/11 and anti-Galphao suggested mediation of these responses primarily by M1 and M4 receptors, respectively. Antibody capture GTPgamma35S binding using scintillation proximity assay technology provides a convenient, productive alternative to immunoprecipitation for exploration of receptor-G protein interaction in cells and tissues.", 
    "121": "SR146131 inhibited the binding of [125I]-Bolton Hunter (BH)-sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8S) for the human recombinant cholecystokinin subtype 1 (CCK1) receptor (IC50 = 0.56 nM) with high (300-fold) selectivity to the CCK2 receptor. The biological activity of SR146131 was characterized in vitro in a NIH-3T3 cell line expressing the human recombinant CCK1 receptor (3T3-hCCK1). Measuring intracellular calcium release, SR146131 behaved as a full agonist with an efficacy comparable with that of CCK-8S (EC50 = 1.38 +/- 0.06 nM). On individual cells, SR146131 induced, like CCK-8S, Ca2+ oscillations at subnanomolar concentrations and sustained responses at higher concentrations. Like CCK-8S, SR146131 also fully stimulated inositol monophosphate formation (EC50 = 18 +/- 4 nM). SR146131 partially activated mitogen-activated protein kinase and enhanced the expression of the immediate early gene krox 24. In the human CHP212 and IMR32 neuroblastoma cell lines, which constitutively express the CCK1 receptor, SR146131 behaved as a partial agonist on intracellular calcium release and inositol monophosphate formation. All of these effects of SR146131 were inhibited by the CCK1 receptor antagonists SR27897B and devazepide, suggesting that the effects of SR146131 were entirely mediated by the CCK1 receptor. In contrast, high concentrations (>1 microM) of SR146131 had only minimal effects on CCK-8S-stimulated and unstimulated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the human CCK2 receptor, indicating that SR146131 is functionally inactive on the CCK2 receptor. In conclusion, these in vitro experiments show that SR146131 is a highly potent and selective agonist of the CCK1 receptor.", 
    "122": "Eight hundred and sixty-two patients who visited the department of neuropsychiatry and who were prescribed benzodiazepine (BZ) hypnotics were investigated to evaluate the actual state of their use, in terms of age, gender, diagnostic categories according to ICD-9, duration of prescription and dose equivalent to diazepam prescribed. The frequency of prescriptions in subjects were surveyed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at every 3 months. Mean survival time to discontinuation was 8.5 months. A total of 60% of the subjects did not receive BZ hypnotics at the end of the third month, but 20% remained to be prescribed after 1 year. Moreover, 7.9% of the subjects were prescribed BZ hypnotics even after 3 years. The results indicated that 20% of patients who had started prescriptions for BZ hypnotics had the potential to induce dependence. The following variables were found in the long-term prescription: male patients; aged patients over 60; and affective psychoses (which mainly consisted of depression) including neurotic depression, in the present study. A low dose was considered to be associated with an ability to be free from BZ hypnotics in an early period.", 
    "123": "Some vagal afferent fibres are exquisitely sensitive to exogenous administration of cholecystokinin (CCK) but their sensitivity to endogenous CCK released by luminal stimuli has not been demonstrated directly, although implied from reflex and behavioural studies. We have therefore utilised electrophysiological techniques to record afferent discharge in mesenteric nerve bundles supplying the rat jejunum in response to luminal application of casein acid hydrolysate (CAH). CAH stimulated whole nerve afferent discharge in both in vivo and in vitro preparations (P < 0.01) while single unit analysis revealed that fibres sensitive to CAH also responded to exogenous CCK. The responses to both CCK and CAH were abolished by the CCKA antagonist devazepide. This study therefore supports the hypothesis that a functional relationship exists between CCK-containing enteroendocrine cells and the afferent fibres whose terminals lie within close proximity.", 
    "124": "To determine the electroclinical characteristics and causative factors of nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) of frontal origin.", 
    "125": "The authors conducted a 5-year prospective study.", 
    "126": "Ten patients were studied (seven men, three women; mean age, 56.4 years). Six patients did not have previous epilepsy. The mean diagnostic delay was 48 hours (range, 3 to 96 hours). Two types of frontal NCSE were identified. In type 1 (n = 7), mood disturbances with affective disinhibition or affective indifference were associated with subtle impairment of cognitive functions without overt confusion. EEG showed a unilateral frontal ictal pattern and normal background activity. In type 2 (n = 3), impaired consciousness was associated with bilateral, asymmetric frontal EEG discharges occurring on an abnormal background. Ictal and postictal 99mTc hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) SPECT was performed in five patients and showed unilateral or bilateral frontal HMPAO uptake that aided localization, especially in type 2 NCSE of frontal origin. Etiologies included a focal frontal lesion in six patients (three of which were tumors), neurosyphilis, and nonketotic hyperglycemia. Eight patients did not respond to initial IV benzodiazepine (BZ), but IV phenytoin controlled six patients successfully. The immediate outcome was favorable in all patients. There was no long-term recurrence of SE in seven patients.", 
    "127": "NCSE of frontal origin is a heterogeneous syndrome. Some cases are best described as simple partial NCSE, others as complex partial SE, and there are forms that overlap with absence SE. Emergency EEG and neuropsychological assessment are diagnostic, and SPECT may be useful. Many patients may not respond to IV BZ.", 
    "128": "Gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian Central Nervous System (CNS). GABA participates in the regulation of neuronal excitability through interaction with specific membrane proteins (the GABAA receptors). The binding of GABA to these postsynaptic receptors, results in an opening of a chloride channel integrated in the receptor which allows the entry of Cl- and consequently leads to hyperpolarization of the recipient cell. The action of GABA is allosterically modulated by a wide variety of chemical entities which interact with distinct binding sites at the GABAA receptor complex. One of the most thoroughly investigated modulatory site is the benzodiazepine binding site. The benzodiazepines constitute a well-known class of therapeutics displaying hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects. Their usefulness, however, is limited by a broad range of side effects comprising sedation, ataxia, amnesia, alcohol and barbiturate potentiation, tolerance development and abuse potential. Consequently, there has been an intensive search for modulatory agents with an improved profile, and a diversity of chemical entities distinct from the benzodiazepines, but with GABA modulatory effects have been identified. The existence of endogenous ligands for the GABAA receptor complex beside GABA has often been described, but their role in the regulation of GABA action is still a matter of controversy. The progress of molecular biology during the last decade has contributed enormously to the understanding of benzodiazepine receptor pharmacology. A total of 14 GABAA receptor subunits have been cloned from mammalian brain and have been expressed/co-expressed in stable cell lines. These transfected cells constitute an important tool in the characterization of subtype selective ligands. In spite of the rapidly expanding knowledge of the molecular and pharmacological mechanisms involved in GABA/benzodiazepine related CNS disorders, the identification of clinically selective acting drugs is still to come.", 
    "129": "During the last few years, cholecystokinin (CCK) has emerged as an important hormone. This polypeptide has been located either in peripheral tissues such as the gastro-intestinal tract and the pancreas as well as in the central nervous system. High affinity CCK receptors are divided in two main subtypes: the CCK-A (A for (A for \"alimentary\") and the CCK-B (B for \"brain\") receptors. The latters are currently associated with the gastrin receptors. Since CCK is involved in many different biological processes such as gut function, digestive processes, control of feeding behaviour and neurotransmitter release, the therapeutical potential of cholecystokinin receptor ligands seems to be extremely broad and promising. Several families of CCK receptor ligands (peptides, peptidomimetics, peptoids or non-peptides) were prepared during the last twenty years. The main goal of these researches was to improve agonistic or antagonistic potency but also to find selective compounds for a specific CCK receptor subtype. This review presents the recent developments (since 1995) in the chemistry of CCK receptor ligands.", 
    "130": "Neuroanatomical studies of schizophrenia suggest that progressive neuropathological changes (such as neuronal atrophy and/or cell death) occur over the lifetime course of the disease. Early intervention with atypical neuroleptics has been shown to prevent progression of at least some symptoms, although the mechanisms by which neuroleptics may do this remain unknown. In this study, PC12 cells were used to determine the effects of the new atypical antipsychotic olanzapine on the gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD1) and the low affinity nerve growth factor receptor (p75). The results show that olanzapine increases SOD1 at concentrations of 10 and 100 microM after 48 hr of incubation in PC12 cultures. The treatment decreases p75 gene expression at concentrations 100 microM after 48 hr of incubation. Since both the upregulation of SOD1 mRNA and the antisense blockade of p75 mRNA have been associated with reduced cell death, our results suggest that olanzapine has neuroprotective potential and thus may be useful in preventing further neurodegeneration accompanying schizophrenia.", 
    "131": "The effects of two calculated plasma sufentanil (SUF) concentrations on the hemodynamic and bispectral index (BIS) responses to Mayfield head holder (MH) application were studied in 20 patients scheduled for intracranial surgery. Premedication consisted of hydroxyzine, alprazolam, and atropine given orally 1 hour before surgery. Anesthesia was provided with propofol (PPF) and SUF using a target-controlled infusion device. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups according to calculated plasma concentrations: 3 microg/mL(-1) of PPF and 0.5 ng/mL(-1) of SUF in group I (GI) and 3 microg/mL(-1) of PPF and 1 ng/mL(-1) of SUF in group II (GII). The MH was fixed 33.0+/-6.6 minutes (mean +/- SD) after induction. Systolic (SAP), diastolic (DAP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP) as well as heart rate (HR) and BIS were recorded 1 minute before pinning (baseline) as well as 1 minute (P1), 2 minutes (P2), and 3 minutes (P3) after pinning. Multivariate repeat-measured analyses of variance were applied to the baseline-subtracted measurements of hemodynamic and BIS values. Groups were compared using the Student's t test, and P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. Patients' characteristics, baseline hemodynamic values, and BIS values were similar in both groups. A significant overall time effect was observed for all variables, but no significant overall SUF effect was detected. Increases in SAP, MAP, DAP, and HR did not differ significantly between groups. The increase in hemodynamic variables did not exceed 20% of baseline value in either group. In contrast, at P1, the increase in BIS over the baseline value was significantly higher in GI (15.0+/-7.9) than in GII (6.7+/-6.5). In conclusion, MH application was associated with a significant, although not clinically relevant, increase in hemodynamic variables whatever the calculated plasma SUF concentration (0.5 or 1.0 ng/mL(-1)). In contrast, the increase in BIS observed at pinning was significantly higher in patients with the lowest calculated plasma SUF concentrations. This suggests that the BIS response to noxious stimulation is modulated by the analgesic regimen.", 
    "132": "This paper reports the functional expression and pharmacological characterization of a full length complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) (pIVY12) cloned from a Heliothis virescens fertilized egg cDNA library that encodes for a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor subunit (HVRDL-Ser 285). Two electrode voltage clamp recordings of Xenopus oocytes expressing the HVRDL GABA-gated chloride channel revealed robust chloride ion conductance in response to GABA and the GABAA receptor agonist, muscimol. Baclofen, a GABAB agonist had no effect. Phenobarbital showed a positive dose-dependent allosteric modulatory effect, whereas the benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam, had no effect. Chloride conductance was depressed by the novel insecticide, fipronil ((+/-)-5-amino-1-(2,6 dichloro-alpha, alpha, alpha-trifluoro-p-tolyl)-4-trifluoromethyl-sulfinylpyrazole-3-carb onitrile) and the GABAA antagonist, picrotoxinin. The HVRDL GABA receptor was insensitive to blockage by dieldrin and the GABAA antagonist, bicuculline. The comparative actions of fipronil, picrotoxinin and dieldrin were examined on oocytes expressing the H. virescens wild-type (HVRDL-Ser 285), the site-directed mutant (HVRDL-Ala 285), the Drosophila melanogaster Rdl wild-type (DMRDL-Ala 302) and the Rdl dieldrin resistant (DMRDL-Ser 302) homo-oligomeric GABA receptors. HVRDL-Ala 285 was 15-fold more sensitive to blockage by fipronil than HVRDL-Ser 285. DMRDL-Ala 302 and DMRDL-Ser-302 showed a similar level of sensitivity to blockage by fipronil. HVRDL-Ser 285 and DMRDL-Ser 302 exhibited a similar level of insensitivity to picrotoxinin. HVRDL-Ala 285 and DMRDL-Ala 302 showed a similar range of picrotoxinin sensitivity. DMRDL-Ala 302 and HVRDL-Ala 285 showed some sensitivity to blockage by dieldrin. Fipronil sensitivity was significantly altered by the serine to alanine mutation at position 285 in the M2 region of the HVRDL subunit, whereas no difference was observed between the DMRDL-Ser 302 and DMRDL-Ala 302 receptors.", 
    "133": "It is demonstrated that acetylcholine released from cholinergic interneurons modulates the excitability of neostriatal projection neurons. Physostigmine and neostigmine increase input resistance (RN) and enhance evoked discharge of spiny projection neurons in a manner similar to muscarine. Muscarinic RN increase occurs in the whole subthreshold voltage range (-100 to -45 mV), remains in the presence of TTX and Cd2+, and can be blocked by the relatively selective M1,4 muscarinic receptor antagonist pirenzepine but not by M2 or M3 selective antagonists. Cs+ occludes muscarinic effects at potentials more negative than -80 mV. A Na+ reduction in the bath occludes muscarinic effects at potentials more positive than -70 mV. Thus, muscarinic effects involve different ionic conductances: inward rectifying and cationic. The relatively selective M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116 does not block muscarinic effects on the projection neuron but, surprisingly, has the ability to mimic agonistic actions increasing RN and firing. Both effects are blocked by pirenzepine. HPLC measurements of acetylcholine demonstrate that AF-DX 116 but not pirenzepine greatly increases endogenous acetylcholine release in brain slices. Therefore, the effects of the M2 antagonist on the projection neurons were attributable to autoreceptor block on cholinergic interneurons. These experiments show distinct opposite functions of muscarinic M1- and M2-type receptors in neostriatal output, i.e., the firing of projection neurons. The results suggest that the use of more selective antimuscarinics may be more profitable for the treatment of motor deficits.", 
    "134": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist alprazolam is known to decrease adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol concentrations. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is secreted synchronously with cortisol by the adrenal glands and demonstrates diurnal variation. The major objective of this study was to determine whether alprazolam affects concentrations of DHEA and DHEA-S, the sulfated metabolite. In vitro studies have demonstrated that DHEA-S, and perhaps DHEA, have GABA antagonistic activity. Another objective was to determine whether DHEA-S and/or DHEA concentrations are related to psychomotor impairment after alprazolam. Thirty-eight healthy volunteers (25 young men, aged 22-35, and 13 elderly men, aged 65-75) received a single intravenous dose of alprazolam 2 mg/2 min (part 1). Fifteen young and 13 elderly men responded to alprazolam and agreed to participate in part 2 of the study, which was a crossover of placebo and alprazolam infusion to plateau for 9 hours. Plasma samples at 0, 1, 4, and 7 hours were assayed for steroid concentrations. Alprazolam produced (1) significant increases in DHEA concentrations at 7 hours in both young and elderly men; (2) significant decreases in cortisol concentrations; and (3) no change in DHEA-S concentrations. The relationship between psychomotor decrement and DHEA concentrations at 7 hours after alprazolam 2 mg/2 min was described by a u-shaped curve (p < 0.0047). Both the linear and quadratic components of the equations for the tests were significant (p < 0.002). These results suggest that alprazolam modulates peripheral concentrations of DHEA and that DHEA and/or DHEA-S may have an in vivo role in modulating GABA receptor-mediated responses.",

    "141": "This study focuses on 19 juvenile offenders who were frequently intoxicated by flunitrazepam (FZ), almost exclusively under the brand name Rohypnol. Street names for Rohypnol tablets are Rophies, Ropies, Roofies, Ropes, Roches, Rochas, Rochas Dos, Rophs, Ropers, Ribs, R-25, Roach-2s, Trip and Fall, Remember All, Mind Erasers, Forget Pills, and the Date Rape Drug. An overdose of FZ gives an increased feeling of power and self-esteem, reduces fear and insecurity, and provides the belief that everything is possible. FZ is also associated with loss of episodic memory and with impulsive violence, particularly when combined with alcohol. The subjects were taken from a subpopulation of 47 male juvenile offenders from Swedish national correctional institutions. Background information for subjects was obtained by in-depth interviewing and personality inventories including the Zuckerman Sensation-Seeking Scales, the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and the Karolinska Scales of Personality. Data concerning previous criminal offenses was obtained from the Swedish National Police Board. Almost all of the FZ abusers had been previously sentenced for serious violent offenses. Our data suggest that FZ abused by psychiatrically vulnerable subjects (i.e., with high scores on boredom susceptibility and verbal aggression) poses a serious hazard both to the abusers as well as the community. Our results support the finding that FZ should be classified as a Schedule I drug (i.e., a drug similar to heavy narcotics).", 
    "142": "Long-term (mean, 8 years) users of benzodiazepines (BZs) were administered a small battery of cognitive tests on three occasions (before BZ taper, and 5 and 12 weeks post taper) as part of their BZ discontinuation program. Ninety-six patients had 5-week and 77 patients had 12-week data. For taper successes, BZ-free status was confirmed by weekly BZ plasma level determinations. Age and education, as well as baseline test scores, were used as covariates for all data analyses. Patients who successfully tapered off BZ were able to complete symbol copying (SC) and digit symbol substitution (DSST) tasks faster than patients still taking BZ (p < 0.05). In addition, using an adjective check list, patients with taper success, i.e., BZ-free patients, reported lower levels of mental and physical sedation and higher levels of tranquilization (p < 0.05) than did patients still taking BZ. These results were confirmed in two multiple regression analyses with SC and DSST as the dependent variables. Higher baseline, younger age, and successful taper status (off BZ) were selected as significant independent predictors of SC and DSST scores. In summary, cognitive functions improved for many long-term BZ users after discontinuing their BZ intake.", 
    "143": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a putative endogenous polypeptide ligand for benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors, has been shown to act as an inverse BZD receptor agonist in the brain. We previously suggested that the social isolation stress-induced decrease in pentobarbital sleeping time in mice was partly due to an increase in the activity of endogenous substances with an inverse BZD receptor agonist-like property such as DBI. In this study, we examined whether the DBI gene expression is affected by socially isolated stress. Consistent with the previous findings, the in situ hybridization result showed very strong signals of DBI mRNA around the regions of the third ventricle, especially the lining cells, the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the cerebellum, in both socially isolated and group-housed animals. Unexpectedly, however, semi-quantitative experiments with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique revealed that socially isolated mice had significantly less expression of DBI mRNA in the hypothalamus than group-housed animals, and no difference in the expression in the other brain areas was observed between two animal groups. We discuss the relationship between the decrease of DBI mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and the decrease of GABA(A) receptor function following long-term social isolation in mice.",

Based on data following the initial six weeks of observation (during which patients underwent medication change and AIMS assessments as frequently as every three days), the one-year risk was 0.52% with olanzapine (n = 513) and 7.45% with haloperidol (n = 114). The relative risk throughout this follow-up period was 11.37 (95% CI = 2.21-58.60).",

    "149": "Olanzapine possesses a broad pharmacological profile, interacting with a range of different neurotransmitter receptors. Although its affinity for muscarinic receptors is relatively greater than for dopamine receptors, on schedule-controlled behaviour olanzapine displays a profile resembling a dopamine antagonist. Likewise, in a test of cognitive function, olanzapine does not produce anticholinergic-like deficits. In drug discrimination assays, olanzapine substitutes for clozapine in clozapine-trained animals and clozapine generalises to olanzapine in olanzapine-trained animals. Olanzapine also reverses the behavioural deficits produced by inhibiting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor glutamatergic transmission. This profile suggests that olanzapine will be effective against both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia while producing minimal extrapyramidal side-effects.", 
    "150": "Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, has a broad receptor binding profile, which may account for its pharmacological effects in schizophrenia. In vitro receptor binding studies showed a high affinity for dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptors; all 5-HT2 receptor subtypes and the 5-HT6 receptor; muscarinic receptors, especially the M1 subtype: and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. In vivo studies showed that olanzapine had potent activity at D2 and 5-HT2A receptors, but much less activity at D1 and muscarinic receptors, and that it inhibited dopaminergic neurons in the A10 but not the A9 tract, suggesting that this agent will not cause extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS). Microdialysis studies showed that olanzapine increased the extracellular levels of norepinephrine and dopamine, but not 5-HT, in the prefrontal cortex, and increased extracellular dopamine levels in the neostriatum and nucleus accumbens, areas of the brain associated with schizophrenia. Studies of gene expression showed that olanzapine 10 mg/kg also increased Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex, the dorsolateral striatum, and the nucleus accumbens. These findings are consistent with the effectiveness of olanzapine on both negative and positive symptoms and suggest that, with careful dosing, olanzapine should not cause EPS."
