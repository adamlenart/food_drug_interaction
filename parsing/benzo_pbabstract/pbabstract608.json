    "0": "The potential of zopiclone, a non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotic, to induce physical dependence in normal human volunteers was investigated. 9 male subjects (age range 21-39 years) participated in a 56-day double-blind study with random assignment to initial treatment A or B: (A) zopiclone 7.5 mg p.o. nightly for 21 days followed by placebo for 7 days, and (B) placebo nightly for 21 days followed by placebo for 7 days. Heart rate, blood pressure, hand tremor and auditory-evoked EEG were repeatedly measured during the withdrawal periods. No differences in any of these variables between phases were found (beta = 0.90 for mean differences of 16% between phases). Subjects slept longer (mean 28 min, p less than 0.013) on zopiclone than on placebo. Symptoms of state anxiety were greater on days 2 and 4 after discontinuing zopiclone compared to all other withdrawal days (p less than 0.0021). The mean relative increase on days 2 and 4 was 30%. Sleep depth (self-rating scale) was no deeper on drug than on placebo, but during the withdrawal phases, sleep was less deep on days 2 and 4 of withdrawal from zopiclone compared to all other withdrawal days (p less than 0.0001). Subjects were unable to identify the pattern of drug administration on withdrawal, and none reported important symptoms. Discontinuation of zopiclone (7.5 mg for 21 days) is associated with detectable increase in state anxiety and lighter sleep on days 2 and 4 of withdrawal. Quantitatively, similar changes occur with other hypnotic drugs of relatively low dependence liability.", 
    "1": "The new non-benzodiazepine hypnotic, zopiclone, was investigated as a preanaesthetic medication in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy patients scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery. Initially a dose-finding study was conducted in which zopiclone 3.75 mg, 7.5, and 11.25 mg was compared with diazepam 10 mg and placebo; 7.5 mg was established as the optimum dose of zopiclone. In the main study zopiclone 7.5 mg was comparable to diazepam 10 mg at 20, 40, and 60 min after administration and more efficacious at 90 min.", 
    "2": "A controlled, double-blind study was made of the efficacy and safety of a new hypnotic, zopiclone, on the preoperative night's sleep by a Joint Study Unit Group of the anesthesiology departments in 6 national hospitals. The following results were found: (1) zopiclone 7.5 and 10 mg and nitrazepam 10 mg were significantly superior to placebo both on the quality of sleep and the mental state of the patient, while no significant differences were observed among these three active drugs; (2) a significantly higher incidence of side-effects was observed for nitrazepam 10 mg than for zopiclone 7.5 and 10 mg and placebo; (3) zopiclone 7.5 and 10 mg and also nitrazepam 10 mg were significantly more useful than placebo, and (4) the above results show that 7.5 and 10 mg of zopiclone are of great benefit to the preoperative night's sleep and have less side-effects than 10 mg of nitrazepam.", 
    "3": "Zopiclone, a new hypnotic with an original chemical structure, was compared in a sleep laboratory study with nitrazepam according to a double-blind, parallel group randomized design. Zopiclone (7.5 mg) and nitrazepam (5 mg) were each given for 14 nights to 5 insomniacs; a placebo washout period of 4 nights and a placebo withdrawal period of 10 nights were included in the design. Both drugs were found to be immediately and lastingly effective. Some slight insomnia rebound was found with nitrazepam, but not with zopiclone. Stage 2 was decreased, slow wave sleep (SWS) increased, and rapid eye movement unchanged by both drugs: however, only nitrazepam increased rapid eye movement latency. The differences between the effects of the drugs were quite limited. However, 3 out of 50 comparisons favoured zopiclone and none nitrazepam.", 
    "4": "Interaction between alcohol and zopiclone or flunitrazepam as well as the residual effects of both these hypnotics were studied in 20 normal male volunteers who received each 3 of 6 different drug and drink combinations according to a balanced incomplete block design as follows: placebo, zopiclone (7.5 mg), or flunitrazepam (2 mg) was administered double-blind in identical capsules at 23.00 h, and 0.5 g/kg body weight of alcohol or placebo alcohol was given at 08.30 h the following morning. Psychomotor skills of the volunteers were measured before drinking and 30 min, 1.5 h and 2.5 h after it. As compared with placebo, zopiclone had no residual effects, while flunitrazepam had some effects on standing steadiness, tracking, and flicker recognition. Alcohol alone had a non-significant effect on skills, and the combination zopiclone plus alcohol behaved as alcohol alone. Flunitrazepam plus alcohol impaired significantly standing steadiness, tracking, and reactive skills when compared with all other treatments. Time anticipation and hand and foot proprioception were not affected by any treatment. The results suggest that flunitrazepam, unlike zopiclone, has residual effects and interacts with alcohol in the morning following overnight ingestion of the drug.", 
    "5": "The influence on memory of 7.5 mg zopiclone, given in single and repeated doses was compared with that of 2 mg flunitrazepam, 5 mg nitrazepam and placebo. Compared with placebo, all three drugs induced some impairment of memory especially after the first day of administration. Effects were more pronounced for the two benzodiazepines and more marked for flunitrazepam. There was one report of an anterograde amnestic episode after flunitrazepam.", 
    "6": "The clinical effects of zopiclone were predicted by using two psychophysiological tests: the averaged photopalpebral reflex and the frontal midline theta activity. Zopiclone at 5 and 10 mg showed a rapid, dose-dependent, moderately lasting prolongation of the latencies of the averaged photopalpebral reflex related to the lowering of the arousal level. Diazepam 5 mg increased markedly the frontal midline theta activity, the appearance of which seems to be related to the relief from anxiety, while zopiclone 10 mg only slightly modified the frontal midline theta activity. The results suggest that zopiclone possesses a potent hypnotic effect, whereas its anxiolytic potential in humans is probably low.", 
    "7": "A study was carried out in general practice in 85 habitual barbiturate takers, many of whom had been using this hypnotic for over 30 years, to assess the clinical practicability and acceptance of barbiturate substitution with flurazepam. Each barbiturate capsule or tablet being taken by patients was replaced by 15 mg flurazepam, either immediately or by gradual substitution. Patients were followed-up over a period of 6 months. The results showed that 5% of the patients were able to stop hypnotic therapy after initial substitution with flurazepam, a further 7% were maintained on occasional flurazepam and 65% on repeated doses, while 18% continued to take barbiturates.", 
    "8": "Hemodialysis tolerance was studied in 3 children during periods of respectively 6, 7 and 9 months comparing bicarbonate (B) versus acetate (A) with equivalent number of sessions. Parameters used for tolerance in these three cases were: hypotensive bouts, solutes perfused during sessions, mean alimentary intake, vomiting, headache, abdominal pain and benzodiazepine prescriptions, taking account of ultrafiltration and dry weight variations during this periods. Results with bicarbonate are following: Obs. n degrees 1 (11 year old female, cystinosis, A: 38 sessions, B: 44 sessions): significant improvement of hypotension episodes and reduction of solutes perfused (p less than 0,05), of vomiting (p less than 0,001), and increase of mean alimentary intake (p less than 0,001). Obs. n degrees 2 (11 year old male, glomerular nephropathy, A: 25 sessions, B: 27 sessions): non significant improvement of hypotension episodes, but improvement for mean alimentary intake (p less than 0,01). Obs. n degrees 3 (4 year old male, uropathy with renal hypoplasia): no significant improvement, but for this child A hemodialysis tolerance was better than for both others. B hemodialysis seems a good alternative for children with A intolerance.", 
    "9": "Eight healthy men received an oral dose of 0.25 mg/kg diazepam followed 40 min later by an intravenous infusion of 100 ml physiological sodium chloride solution, with or without 4.4 mg/kg theophylline. Psychomotor function was assessed after each blood sampling up to 5 h post-infusion. Thirty min after diazepam psychomotor performance measured by Card Sorting test and Digit Symbol Substitution test was impaired and subjects felt sleepy and could think less clearly (two factors of the Clyde Mood Scale). Theophylline antagonized the diazepam-induced impairment statistically significantly for up to 5 h and subjects felt less tense and less apprehensive (State Anxiety Inventory). Since pharmacokinetic parameters of diazepam seemed not to be different after theophylline, interaction at receptor level can be assumed.", 
    "10": "A patient with Meige's disease was given several pharmacological trials, including muscle relaxants, dopaminergic antagonists, monoamine depletors, anticholinergics, dopamine agonists, cholinergics, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and lithium. Improvement of dystonic movements was best obtained by a combined treatment, haloperidol-benztropine. A review of the literature on Meige's disease is presented. The hypothesis of a simultaneous dopaminergic and cholinergic overactivity is discussed and the use of physostigmine for diagnostic purposes is suggested.", 
    "11": "Brotizolam (0.25 mg) was compared with placebo, and in a separate study, with nitrazepam (5.0 mg) in patients being treated for insomnia in general practice. Brotizolam (0.25 mg) and nitrazepam (5.0 mg) were equally effective and there was no evidence of residual effects the next day with either drug.", 
    "12": "Efficacy of and tolerance to brotizolam were studied over 6 days in elderly patients (62 to 93 years) suffering from sleep disturbance requiring medication: 62.9% used 0.125 mg and 32.0% used 0.25 mg. Effectiveness of brotizolam was assessed as good-to-satisfactory in 87.1% of the patients. Efficacy of and tolerance to brotizolam were compared with nitrazepam in mainly elderly patients (56-91 years) with sleep disturbances requiring medication. Efficacy was assessed as good-to-satisfactory in 89.8% of patients with 0.125 mg brotizolam, 93.9% with 0.25 mg brotizolam and 95.9% with 5 mg nitrazepam. Patients reported improved sleep with all three preparations. The dose range of brotizolam recommended for the elderly is 0.125-0.25 mg, though for the vast majority of patients the lower dose will be sufficient.", 
    "13": "Auditory awakening thresholds (AAT) and the back-to-sleep latency (BSL) after nocturnal awakenings from Stage 2 sleep were studied in normal male subjects after placebo, brotizolam (0.25, 0.375 and 0.50 mg) and flurazepam (30 mg). AAT (dB) was measured in five trials spaced across the night in a 'double awakening' procedure with the second awakening in each trial made from Stage 2 sleep. Each drug condition was associated with elevated mean AAT across the five trials in comparison with placebo. In a trial-by-trial analysis only 0.50 mg brotizolam and 30 mg flurazepam were consistently higher in the first three trials compared with placebo. All active drug conditions decreased the mean BSL across all trials in comparison with placebo, but only 30 mg flurazepam and 0.50 mg brotizolam consistently shortened BSL in the first three trials. Brotizolam (0.50 mg) and 30 mg flurazepam are similar in their effects. The subjective improvement reported in insomniac subjects following hypnotic administration may be related to elevation in arousal thresholds and a quick return to sleep after nocturnal sleep disruption.", 
    "14": "Residual effects of brotizolam (0.25 mg) and flurazepam (30 mg) were studied in healthy young adults. Performance and subjective assessments were observed from 7 to 8 h after overnight ingestion, and effects were compared with that of placebo. Visuo-motor coordination, visuo-mental processing time, visuo-motor reaction time and reading errors were not impaired with brotizolam. There were residual effects with 30 mg flurazepam. Visuo-motor coordination, visuo-mental processing time, visuo-motor reaction time, and reading errors were impaired compared with placebo and 0.25 mg brotizolam. Subjective assessments of performance correlated with measured performance. There was a decrease with flurazepam (visuo-motor coordination and visuo-mental processing time) compared with placebo.", 
    "15": "The amount of acetylcholine (ACh) released in perplex cylinders filled with 0.5 ml eserinized Ringer solution and placed on the exposed rat cerebral cortex was determined every 10 min. For the purpose bioassay on leech dorsal muscle was used. ACh was calculated in pmoles/cm2 min-1. It was found that diazepam decreased by 30 per cent, hyoscine increased by 36 per cent and oxotremorine also decreased by 24.5 per cent the ACh output from the cerebral cortex. Hyoscine counteracted to a considerable extent the diazepam-induced inhibition of ACh output, but oxotremorine did not potentiate the inhibitory effect of diazepam on ACh output, in some cases it even prevented it. It could be assumed that the effects of hyoscine and oxotremorine result to a considerable extent from their action on presynaptic autoinhibitory muscarinic receptors. However, it is also possible for the effects of oxotremorine to be important influences on the cortical cholinergic mechanisms, mediated by adrenergic structures. The results obtained suggest a definite role of the cerebral cholinergic system in the mechanism of action of the benzodiazepine derivative diazepam.", 
    "16": "A placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study was carried out in 18 patients, aged under 65 years, with sleep disturbance to compare the hypnotic effects of 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg flunitrazepam and placebo. Patients received each treatment in random order for 7 days. Assessments by both doctor and patients were made on entry and at the end of each treatment period. The results showed that the 1 mg flunitrazepam dose was optimal with respect to speed of action, duration of action, quality of sleep and lack of residual clinical sequelae.", 
    "17": "Nausea and vomiting may be the most distressing part of cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignant disease and frequently leads to default from treatment. Furthermore, in some patients, anxiety associated with chemotherapy precipitates anticipatory vomiting. 24 patients with refractory vomiting associated with chemotherapy were selected from a homogeneous group of malignancies. 25% of these also had anticipatory vomiting. Lorazepam, a benzodiazepine, in a dose of 3 mg/m2, was given by mouth in conjunction with a standard centrally acting antiemetic 30 min before chemotherapy. Vomiting was totally abolished in 70% of patients; in only 4% two vomiting episodes occurred. In addition, 17% of patients had complete amnesia of the events of chemotherapy. This pilot study suggests that lorazepam in conjunction with standard antiemetic therapy may be an effective means of controlling refractory nausea and vomiting.", 
    "18": "Using a double-blind procedure, 16 out of 32 volunteer subjects (students) each took 2.5 mg of lorazepam (Ativan) orally and the remainder took a placebo. To overcome the problem of wide variation in individual tolerance to the drug, impairment on a task unrelated to memory (a manual dexterity task) was used to divide drug subjects into a group appreciably affected by the drug, subgroup 1, and a group minimally affected, subgroup 2. Only subgroup 1 showed consistent impairment of episodic memory. Both subgroups showed some impairment in a semantic memory task (generation of words from a specified category), but this was confined to the rate at which the task was carried out. The main aim of the experiment was to examine the effect of lorazepam on the rate of forgetting of word lists when drug and control subjects' initial recall levels were equalized. There was no evidence that the drug affected rate of forgetting: this suggests that it does not affect retention. There was also no evidence that it affected retrieval, since there was no impairment in the recall of material presented before administration of the drug. Hence its locus of action is attributed to input, specifically to impaired encoding of contextual information.", 
    "19": "During galactosamine-induced acute liver failure in white male Wistar rats, EEG was recorded at regular intervals. Spectral analysis was done as described by Kropveld and co-workers in 1983. The specificity of the anomalies in the power-density spectra is tested by comparing the changing patterns with those caused by several pharmaceutical agents--ether, diazepam, pentobarbital. Quantification of the observed anomalies is discussed.", 
    "20": "The effects of midazolam 15 mg and alcohol 0.5 g/kg on short-term storage in the visual system (iconic memory) and free recall of a word list were investigated in 8 normal volunteers. Acute doses of midazolam, alcohol and midazolam in combination with alcohol were all found to decrease iconic memory whereas only midazolam and midazolam + alcohol impaired immediate recall. Anterograde amnesia was observed following treatment with midazolam and midazolam in conjunction with alcohol. The results suggest a potentiation of the effects of midazolam, on aspects of human memory by the co-administration of small doses of alcohol.", 
    "21": "To demonstrate the effect of diazepam on serum growth hormone and prolactin levels in acromegaly, 7 acromegalics were studied. Every patient received 10 mg diazepam orally at zero time, and blood samples were obtained at 30-min intervals. The same patients also underwent a standard L-dopa test. They were given 500 mg L-dopa orally at zero time, and blood samples were obtained at 30-min intervals. The administration of diazepam did not induce any significant changes in either growth hormone or prolactin levels. On the other hand, the administration of L-dopa resulted in a significant decrease in growth hormone level from 74.25 +/- 22 ng/ml (mean +/- SEM) at zero time to a level of 52.8 +/- 21 and 58.77 +/- 22.7 ng/ml at the 60- and 90-min intervals, respectively (p less than 0.05), and a significant decrease in prolactin level from a baseline of 56.18 +/- 17 to 25.5 +/- 8.4 ng/ml (p less than 0.001) at the 60-min interval. It is suggested that the response of growth hormone to diazepam in acromegalics is qualitatively different from nonacromegalic controls.", 
    "22": "Four groups of 6 pregnant Long-Evans rats were intubated on days 6, 7, 9, 12, 15, and 18 of gestation with (a) 4 g/kg ethanol (E), (2) 10 mg/kg diazepam (D) plus isocaloric amounts of sucrose, (3) 10 mg/kg diazepam plus 4 g/kg ethanol (DE), and (4) gum arabic suspension plus sucrose solution in isocaloric amount with E (PF). All groups were pair-fed with group DE and had ad libitum access to water. On day 19 there were no differences in maternal weight gain, litter size, fetal weight, and protein content in fetal brain. Fetal brain and placental weight were significantly decreased in E, D, and DE. The decrease in placental weight in DE was significantly higher than in E or D. The concentrations of glutamic acid, alanine, glycine, serine, threonine, leucine, valine, and tyrosine in fetal brains were significantly decreased after E and D, but not different in DE from PF. Diazepam did not potentiate the effects of ethanol. Undernutrition could be a confounding factor in the observed effects.", 
    "23": "The binding of indomethacin to albumin was investigated at 37 degrees C, pH 7.4. The first stoichiometric binding constant is 2.5 X 10(5) M-1. Indomethacin utilizes both the bilirubin and diazepam binding functions equally. The effect on bilirubin binding to albumin is negligible at therapeutic indomethacin blood levels. Oleic acid does not affect indomethacin binding until the oleate/albumin molar ratio exceeds 2. A method for measuring the reserve albumin equivalent for binding indomethacin is described. Measurement of this reserve binding equivalent in 33 neonatal serum samples shows no significant correlation of the reserve binding to the albumin level. This methodology may be useful in studying the variable response of infants with patent ductus arteriosus to indomethacin.", 
    "24": "The efficacy and clinical effects of flunitrazepam (1 mg) and nitrazepam (5 mg) as somnifacients were studied in 37 psychogeriatric inpatients. Each drug was administered in a double-blind manner to randomized groups of patients for 14 nights. Compared with placebo, both benzodiazepines proved to be effective in inducing and maintaining sleep. Although both drugs were well tolerated, insomnia resulted when each was withdrawn.", 
    "25": "The hemodynamic changes during anesthetic induction for elective abdominal aortic surgery were studied in two groups of patients. Group M (9 patients) received midazolam 0.3 mg . kg-1 and fentanyl 6 micrograms . kg-1. Group T (10 patients) received thiopentone 6 mg . kg-1 and fentanyl 5 micrograms . kg-1. The radial and pulmonary arteries were catheterized under local anesthesia. An intravenous infusion was administered in order to normalize pulmonary wedge pressure. Systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, pulmonary wedge pressure, cardiac output and heart rate were measured after the infusion and 5 min after intubation. Mean arterial pressure showed a statistically significant reduction in both groups. Cardiac index remained unchanged in group M, but was significantly diminished in group T. There was no significant reduction in the systemic vascular resistance index for group M, but group T showed a statistically significant increase. This study confirmed the good hemodynamic tolerance of the midazolam induction technique, even with a high dose of 0.3 mg . kg-1.", 
    "26": "The hemodynamic effects of flunitrazepam were studied in eight coronary patients (group I) and in six patients with compensated cardiac failure (group II) during the induction of anesthesia with droperidol 5 mg and fentanyl 4 micrograms . kg-1. A right sided cardiac catheterization was performed to measure cardiac output by thermodilution. In coronary patients, the hemodynamic parameters were only slightly modified (NS). Cardiac output (-12.7%) and oxygen consumption (-20.4%) decreased; Pvo2 increased from 6.4 +/- 0.1 to 7.3 +/- 0.3 kPa. In patients with cardiac failure, significant cardiovascular changes were not observed. Arterial pressure (-13%), cardiac output (-2.6%), oxygen consumption (-6%) and systemic vascular resistance (-13.4%) decreased; Pvo2 increased from 6.4 +/- 0.5 to 6.8 +/- 0.7 kPa. In both groups, heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were unchanged. There was only a significant difference (p less than 0.05) between the decrease in systemic resistance in group II and in the absence of change in systemic resistance in group I. Decrease in oxygen consumption be decrease in oxygen demand could explain the slight decrease in cardiac output. Flunitrazepam was a good hypnotic for the induction of anesthesia in normovolaemic coronary patients and in patients with compensated cardiac failure.", 
    "27": "The authors report a case in which a non-24-h (hypernychthemeral) sleep-wake cycle appeared as a late complication of a more fundamental disturbance in the quality of sleep (difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, nonrefreshing sleep). The sleep disturbance began abruptly after a series of stressful events. The patient reported that he extended his hours of bedrest in the morning in order to increase his total sleep time and feel mor rested, and that he gradually extended his hours of activity in the late evening in order to increase his drowsiness and ability to fall asleep. At first this behavior, which was a deliberate attempt to compensate for inefficient nighttime sleep, led to a delayed sleep period, as also occurs in the delayed sleep phase syndrome. After several years in which sleep efficiency progressively deteriorated, this behavior led to a non-24-h free-running sleep-wake cycle. After the patient was treated with thyroxine for borderline hypothyroidism, and then flurazepam and finally vitamin B12, his sleep disturbance progressively improved and his sleep-wake cycle shortened. After B12 treatment he was able to advance the timing of ;his sleep period for the first time in nearly 10 years and to follow a normal 24-h sleep-wake regimen.", 
    "28": "A test procedure, inducing a defined state of vigilance in rats, has been investigated to ascertain its usefulness for EEG monitoring of the effects of drugs. In order to prevent spontaneous fluctuations in the level of vigilance, rats were trained to walk in a slowly rotating treadwheel. The level of vigilance recorded under these conditions could be shifted by amphetamine, 1.0 mg/kg p.o., to a higher state of arousal, as shown by a reduction in power in all frequency bands, and by diazepam, 0.3 mg/kg p.o., to a lower state of arousal, as indicated by a rise in the activity at low frequencies. Imipramine (1.0, 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg p.o.) caused a dose-related reduction in power in the intermediate frequency bands (3-18 Hz).", 
    "29": "The pharmacokinetic interaction between clobazam and cimetidine was studied in 9 healthy male volunteers in an open-labelled study. After a single oral dose of clobazam 30 mg, a wash-out period of 14 days was followed by daily doses of cimetidine 1 g for one week. Thereafter a single oral dose of clobazam 30 mg was again given. The plasma concentrations of clobazam and its main metabolite N-desmethyl-clobazam were measured by gas-chromatography. The area under the curve (AUC0-infinity) of plasma clobazam level was significantly larger after pretreatment with cimetidine and the elimination half life of clobazam was significantly longer. There were no statistically significant differences in Cmax and tmax for plasma clobazam. The plasma levels of N-desmethyl-clobazam did not show any significant change after the intake of cimetidine.", 
    "30": "The clearance of the antipyretic-analgesic drug acetaminophen, biotransformed in humans by glucuronide and sulfate conjugation, was evaluated in 32 healthy young and elderly volunteers. Subjects received a single 650-mg dose of acetaminophen, and multiple plasma concentrations measured over the next 12 h. Random subgroups of subjects also participated in studies of the oxidized benzodiazepines diazepam, desmethyldiazepam and alprazolam, and of the conjugated benzodiazepines lorazepam, oxazepam and temazepam. Acetaminophen clearance was not related to that of the oxidized benzodiazepines, but was highly correlated with clearance of lorazepam (r = 0.70, n = 11, p less than 0.02), oxazepam (r = 0.76, n = 14, p less than 0.005) and temazepam (r = 0.63, n = 16, p less than 0.01). Thus acetaminophen may serve as a probe or marker compound to evaluate drug conjugating capacity in humans.", 
    "31": "Self-poisoning with antidepressant drugs was studied retrospectively in 225 patients admitted to an intensive care unit. Amitriptyline accounted for the overwhelming majority of cases (70%); 106 patients (47%) had taken two or more drugs, in 81 patients (36%) ethanol was found in the blood. Four patients (2%) died. On admission, 111 patients (49%) were unconscious (grade III). A further 30 patients (13%) were in grade IV coma, and of these 27 had taken amitriptyline. Twenty-four hours after admission, 22 patients (10%) remained in coma. Thirty-six patients (16%) required assisted ventilation. Nineteen patients (8%) had convulsions and 6 (3%) aspired stomach contents. Sixty-one patients (27%) had a widened QRS interval exceeding 100 msec, 18 (30%) of them required assisted ventilation, 21 (34%) were in stage IV coma and 15 (25%) had convulsions. This relationship between a widened QRS interval and the severity of intoxication should be considered in the initial assessment of patients with tricyclic antidepressant poisoning.", 
    "32": "The antimyotonic effect of Faustan (diazepam) was investigated in the experimentally induced myotonia by 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D). The results show that Faustan does not improve the myotonic phenomena. Neither was the fall in membrane potential prevented nor were the myotonic muscle fiber changes of 2,4-D and had in its turn a depressive influence on the muscle. Depending on the concentration the drug developed a more depressive effect on the mechanical reaction than the electrical activity. These findings are compared with the results described in the relevant literature and are discussed in connection with the inhibition of electro-mechanical coupling.", 
    "33": "Benzodiazepines are widely used for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and certain neuromuscular and convulsive disorders. However, their widespread availability has given rise to fears that they are over-prescribed. The problem is compounded by the fact that there is no universal agreement among medical practitioners as to the clinical indications warranting the use of these drugs. Although most industrialized countries exercise control over the sale and manufacture of benzodiazepines, many developing countries do not have sufficient control of these drugs. As a result, information on drug utilization and associated problems is difficult to obtain and there is a lack of comparative data on drug consumption in different countries.The present article describes the current knowledge on the pharmacological, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics of benzodiazepines, and the problems associated with their use, and indicates areas where more research is needed. Recommendations are made for future work.", 
    "34": "The experience obtained over 226 cases of endoscopically diagnosticated acute, bleeding, gastroduodenal lesions (A. B. G. D. L.), is submitted. The close relation among authors concerning diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up of patients, may allow them to offer the following results: 1) To elaborate an anatomopathological-endoscopic classification of the A. B. G. D. L., this being composed of five groups: a) microerosive or petechial form; b) macroerosive; c) acute ulcerous and d) fissurate form. The macroscopic, endoscopic and microscopic features of each of the forms, have being designated. 2) To present an entity: the Hemorrhagic Gastroenteropathy (HGP) pointing on the alarming possibility that, the denominated Hemorrhagic Gastroduodenitis (HDG), do not be such, but a simply high lesional constituent of a picture extending also to other digestive area (politopic disease) (HGP). This proposal is supported by clinic, endoscopic and experimental findings. 3) To propose the treatment now we consider the suitable one, based on the clinical prospective research fulfilled over 186 cases. This therapeutic consists on the psiquic disconnection achieved by the use of a lithic mixture combined with H2 and H1 blockers. Since the results are invariably effectives, we think that this disease is a medical entity and most exceptionally surgical.", 
    "35": "The hemodynamic effects of isoflurane and halothane when used to control intraoperative hypertension were evaluated in 20 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. The patients were anesthetized with flunitrazepam, fentanyl, pancuronium, and N2O-O2. Control measurements were made after skin incision. When mean arterial pressure increased to 110 mm Hg due to sternal spread or surgical manipulation of the aorta, isoflurane or halothane were used to return arterial pressure to control levels. Using a non-rebreathing system, inspired isoflurane concentrations of 1.5-2.0 vol% or halothane concentrations of 1.0-1.5 vol% were necessary. Measurements were repeated during the hypertensive episode and after treatment with isoflurane or halothane while surgical stimulation continued. Both inhalation anesthetics decreased arterial pressure to baseline values within 5-10 min. The lowering of arterial pressure with halothane was not accompanied by significant decreases in the elevated systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Cardiac index and stroke volume index decreased markedly when halothane was used (18% and 25%, respectively). In contrast, isoflurane significantly decreased systemic vascular resistance (42%). This reduction of left ventricular afterload was associated with an increase in cardiac index (22%) and a decrease in left ventricular filling pressure. Heart rate did not change significantly. These findings indicate that isoflurane is superior to halothane for controlling intraoperative hypertension during coronary artery bypass surgery.", 
    "36": "Infant and small children are not always able to cooperate in impedance measurements. For this reason it was decided, -in special cases, -to perform acoustic reflex examination under general anaesthesia. The first report on stapedius reflex and general anaesthesia was published by Mink et al. in 1981. Under the effect of Tiobutabarbital, Propanidid and Diazepam there is no reflex response. Acoustic reflex can be elicited with Ketamin-hydrochlorid and Alphaxalone-alphadolone acetate narcosis. The reflex threshold remains unchanged and the amplitude of muscle contraction is somewhat increased. The method was used: 1. to assess the type and degree of hearing loss in children with cleft palate and/or lip prior to surgery. 2. to exclude neuromuscular disorders with indication of pharyngoplasties. 3. to quantify hearing level in children--mostly multiply handicapped--with retarded speech development. The results of Behavioral Observation and Impedance Audiometry are discussed and evaluated.", 
    "37": "The substantia innominata complex (SI) is the major source of cholinergic innervation to the amygdala, entorhinal and pyriform cortices, and the neocortex. Immunohistochemical studies using both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) have clearly identified that the large size neurons of this area are cholinergic. We have lesioned this area by three methods: electrocoagulation, kainic acid (KA) injection and folic acid (FA) injection. Biochemical (GAD, ChAT and QNB binding) and histological studies of the SI and its known target areas as well as the hippocampus, thalamus and striatum were undertaken. Histologically, electrolytic and KA (2 nmol) lesions produced extensive local damage, but local damage was minimal with FA (100-250 nmol). Electrolytic lesions produced no remote neuronal damage. KA injections produced mild to moderate damage in the amygdala and cortex, while FA produced severe damage in the amygdala and pyriform cortex, with less severe damage in the entorhinal cortex and neocortex. Biochemically, electrolytic lesions produced drops in ChAT only in remote areas. Kainic acid produced moderate drops in ChAT, GAD and QNB binding. FA, on the other hand, produced only a minimal change in ChAT, but very heavy reductions in GAD and QNB binding. Thus, GABA neurons of the cortex were damaged. They may also be the cholinoceptive neurons that were damaged. The remote damage following KA and, particularly, FA, is presumed to be due to the epileptiform activity induced by the local injection of these agents. Reduction in both seizures and remote damage was brought about by pre-treatment of the animals with valium (20 mg/kg) or scopolamine (50 mg/kg). Injection of FA into the amygdala or striatum produced some remote damage but it was much less in magnitude than after SI injection.", 
    "38": "A case report is presented here. A 33-year-old female who had been medicated with Chinese medicine showed a typical psychomotor status which conformed to all items of Heintel's and Treiman and Delgado-Escueta's diagnostic criteria of psychomotor status. When she was 33 years old in the 34th week of pregnancy on April 11, 1981, she was found to be in an epileptic twilight state during which a delirious state and some automatisms were observed. As the incidence of automatisms gradually increased, she was finally seized with a typical psychomotor status in which automatisms were quite periodically and frequently repeated without complete recovery of consciousness between seizures. This status still continued despite an intravenous injection of diazepam and phenytoin and barely ceased with the medication of clonazepam and carbamazepine four days after the beginning of the status.", 
    "39": "Twelve cases of adult absence status were seen over 7 years. Clinically the disorder was characterised by long periods of clouding of consciousness with myoclonic phenomena of varying degrees of severity. The EEGs showed sustained spike-wave, polyspike and rhythmic slow activity. In one exceptional patient bizarre hemitonic seizures were documented clinically and on EEG. Diagnosis of the condition was frequently delayed and the histories of most patients showed episodes of obscure confusional behaviour, undiagnosed over the previous months or years. Psychiatric disturbances of various types were surprisingly common, contributing to diagnostic difficulty. Treatment with conventional anticonvulsants was often disappointing. In contrast, sodium valproate and clonazepam were found to be very effective.", 
    "40": "The protein binding of diazepam, desmethyldiazepam, furosemide, indomethacin, warfarin, and phenobarbital in maternal and fetal cord serum at the time of birth, and in serum of neonates between 1 and 11 days of age was studied. The protein binding of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam was higher in the fetus than in the mother, thus explaining the fetal cumulation of these drugs in vivo. After birth, both drugs were partially displaced from neonatal binding sites. The decreased protein binding capacity in the mother and the neonate related to increased free fatty-acid levels. The pattern of protein binding of warfarin in the groups investigated was a mirror image of those of diazepam and its metabolite. The protein binding of indomethacin progressively decreased in the neonate during the first two postnatal weeks, while that of furosemide remained at lowered levels throughout this time interval. The protein binding of phenobarbital was similar in the groups investigated. Our results suggest that drugs such as diazepam, which can be displaced from binding sites by free fatty acids, may cumulate in the fetus and may exhibit much decreased protein binding and possibly unexpectedly strong effects in the neonate after birth.", 
    "41": "Side effects of carbamazepine (CBZ), valproate (VPA) and clonazepam (CZP) are rare during long-term use but rather common and usually transient during the early phases of treatment. The usual side effects of CBZ are drowsiness, dizziness, and diplopia, which are dose dependent in long-term use, but CBZ does not seem to cause cognitive disturbances, as do phenobarbital and phenytoin. Other reactions to CBZ may include leukopenia, hyponatremia, disturbances of vitamin D metabolism and fortunately rarely, agranulocytosis and hepatitis. Use of VPA can lead to gastrointestinal discomfort, weight gain, hair loss, tremor and sedation, but these side effects are rather uncommon, mild, and transient during VPA monotherapy. Potentially hazardous reactions such as hepatitis and pancreatitis have occurred in a few patients on VPA, generally with multidrug therapy. Some of the side effects are dose related. They infrequently lead to withdrawal of VPA. Side effects limited to initiation of CZP therapy include drowsiness, ataxia, and behavioral changes; they are usually transient but can lead to dose reduction or even withdrawal of the drug. Except for development of tolerance, CZP seems to be practically free of long-term side effects.", 
    "42": "A series of 47 children with absence seizures was analysed retrospectively. Fourteen of these children also had other types of seizures, and four had repeated episodes of absence status. The age at onset of absence seizures ranged from 1 1/2 to 13 years (mean, 7.9 years). The mean follow-up was 5.5 years. Ethosuximide (ESM) was used as the drug of first choice in 43 children, and valproate (VPA) was used first in 4 children; 15 of the patients later received VPA alone or in combination with ESM. A 100% reduction in seizure frequency was achieved in 38 children (80.8%). Of these, 23 has received ESM (21 ESM; 2 ESM + nitrazepam) and 15 had received VPA (6 VPA; 9 VPA + ESM). Of the latter group, 11 children had had an unsuccessful trial of ESM. VPA was superior in the treatment of children who had EEG polyspikes or absence status. A seizure reduction of 50% to 75% was achieved in 7 children (14.9%). Two patients (4.3%) had refractory seizures. A transient Stevens-Johnson syndrome occurred in a patient treated with ESM. Other side effects were mild and transient. Both ESM and VPA are needed in the treatment of absence seizures. In refractory cases, the combination of these drugs appears to be beneficial.", 
    "43": "In gerbils, 'minor' (myoclonic) and 'major' (clonic-tonic) seizures were induced by blowing at the animals with compressed air. The anticonvulsant ED50 of the following drugs was determined after oral administration against both types of seizures: phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, ethosuximide, and diazepam. Valproate, ethosuximide, and diazepam were most potent against 'minor' seizures which could not or only partially be suppressed by phenytoin or carbamazepine, respectively. The 'grand mal' drugs phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine were, on the other hand, more potent against 'major' than against 'minor' seizures. When phenobarbital was administered for several days, a strong induction of hepatic microsomal enzymes occurred.", 
    "44": "The effectiveness of pirenzepine in the prevention of duodenal ulcer relapses was assessed by means of a double-blind controlled trial versus cimetidine. Seventy duodenal ulcer out-patients endoscopically healed after a 6-week treatment with either pirenzepine or cimetidine were admitted to the trial. The former pirenzepine patients were treated again with pirenzepine: 1 tablet at breakfast and 2 tablets at bedtime (75 mg daily). The former cimetidine patients were treated again with cimetidine: 2 tablets at bedtime (400 mg daily). They received one placebo tablet at breakfast. Both treatments lasted 12 months. Tablets of a mild antacid were permitted only if necessary to relieve severe ulcer pain and heartburn. Patients underwent clinical and endoscopic assessments after 4, 8 and 12 months of treatment and whenever ulcer symptoms lasted more than 4-5 consecutive days. Only 47 out of the 70 patients that entered the trial underwent all clinical and endoscopic controls. Sixteen out of 23 patients on pirenzepine (70%) and 17 out of 24 patients on cimetidine (71%) did not relapse after 12 months. The difference is not statistically significant. Both treatments were well tolerated. The results show that pirenzepine was as effective as cimetidine in the prevention of duodenal ulcer relapses when administered at a dosage of 75 mg daily (of which 50 mg at bedtime) for one year.", 
    "45": "Twenty-three endoscopically healed duodenal ulcer patients entered a long-term treatment with pirenzepine for 1 year (two 25-mg tablets at breakfast and two tablets at bedtime). One day before and 7 days after the long-term treatment started, gastric pH and BAO were measured in each patient after fasting. The patients were clinically examined monthly and underwent endoscopy 4, 8 and 12 months after the trial started or when they complained of ulcer symptoms. Blood and urine laboratory tests were carried out before treatment began and 6 and 12 months afterwards. Eighteen of the 22 patients that completed the trial (82%) did not relapse. The statistical analysis tended to show a relationship between absence of pH increase and relapses. No severe side-effects or changes in the results of laboratory tests were observed.", 
    "46": "The effects of the benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam on the rigidity produced by systemic administration of morphine (15 mg/kg i.p.) were studied in rats. The rigidity was recorded as a tonic activity from the gastrocnemius-soleus muscle of non-anesthetized rats in the electromyogram. Both diazepam (1-5 mg/kg i.p.) and midazolam (2.5 and 5 mg/kg i.p.), when administered 45 min after morphine, temporarily antagonized the muscular rigidity. When the competitive antagonist Ro 15-1788 (ethyl-8-fluoro-5, 6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a]-[1,4]benzodiazepine-3 -carboxylate) (5 mg/kg i.p.) was administered together with diazepam (5 mg/kg i.p.), it prevented the effect of diazepam, although by itself it did not affect the morphine-induced muscular rigidity. Our results suggest that diazepam, by acting on benzodiazepine receptors, can antagonize the morphine-induced muscular rigidity. The latter phenomenon might serve as a model for some types of muscular rigidity observed in humans.", 
    "47": "Recent advances in understanding the pathophysiology of status epilepticus (SE) have increased the urgency with which the study of this disorder should be approached. The clinical pharmacology of anticonvulsants useful in treating SE is reviewed and their application in several of the different types of SE is discussed. The potential for future advances is briefly considered.", 
    "48": "The study was designed to determine the steady-state pharmacokinetic profile of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam following a 15-mg controlled-release capsule dosed once daily at either 7 a.m. or 11 p.m. compared with the respective profiles of the conventional 5-mg tablet dosed three times a day at 7 a.m., 12 p.m., and 5 p.m. Plasma concentrations of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam were assayed by an electron-capture gas-liquid chromatographic method. Plasma concentrations indicated that there were no differences between the pharmacokinetic profiles following the 7 a.m. or 11 p.m. dosings of the controlled-release capsule. Steady-state concentrations of diazepam were attained between days 7 and 9 during the controlled-release dosing, and the accumulation profiles are similar to those observed for the conventional tablet given three times a day. Nearly identical areas under the diazepam plasma concentration-time curves (AUC) on day 1 and at steady state for both regimens indicate equal extents of absorption from the two formulations. In addition, the steady-state AUCs for desmethyldiazepam were independent of formulation. The data indicate that a single daily dose of the 15-mg controlled-release capsule results in accumulation and steady-state profiles comparable to those observed following a regimen of the 5-mg conventional tablet three times a day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "A subeffective dose (2 mg/kg) of diazepam produced only 50% protection against picrotoxin-induced (PTX) convulsions in rats. Simultaneous administration of GABA and other GABA-ergic substances such as piracetam and sidium valproate, which did not have any effect by themselves, potentiated diazepam action. The onset of convulsions and mortality due to PTX were significantly delayed. The other conventional anticonvulsants phenobarbitone, phenytoin and ethosuximide also enhanced the protective effect of diazepam. Inosine, a putative benzodiazepine ligand, also enhanced diazepam action. These observations are explained on the basis of data from in vitro studies indicating that GABA-ergic agents and barbiturates enhance both the number of benzodiazepine binding sites and benzodiazepine binding. The protective effect of clonidine, however, may be mediated by a different mechanism unrelated to the GABA-ergic system.", 
    "50": "Rhesus monkeys were trained to track a moving disk using a procedure in which responses on a lever were reinforced with water delivery only when the disk, oscillating in a horizontal plane on a screen at a frequency of 0.4 Hz in a visual angle of 20 degrees, dimmed for a brief period. Pursuit eye movements were recorded by electrooculography (EOG). IM phencyclidine, secobarbital, and diazepam injections decreased the number of reinforced lever presses in a dose-related manner. Both secobarbital and diazepam produced episodic jerky-pursuit eye movements, while phencyclidine had no consistent effects on eye movements. Lever pressing was disrupted at doses which had little effect on the quality of smooth-pursuit eye movements in some monkeys. This separation was particularly pronounced with diazepam. The similarities of the drug effects on smooth-pursuit eye movements between the present study and human studies indicate that the present method using rhesus monkeys may be useful for predicting drug effects on eye tracking and oculomotor function in humans.", 
    "51": "The nature of the tolerance that develops to the sedative action of lorazepam was investigated using a hole-board apparatus. Rats treated with lorazepam (0.125, 0.25 and 0.50 mg/kg) once daily for 3 days showed similar degrees of tolerance to the effects of a test dose of 0.25 mg/kg lorazepam. Tolerance was also observed in animals treated once every 2 days with lorazepam (0.50 mg/kg). Measurement of the plasma and brain concentrations of lorazepam immediately after the behavioural test showed that this tolerance was functional and not dispositional. In contrast, the behavioural effects of lorazepam were not reduced as a result of 3 days of treatment with a sedative dose of sodium pentobarbitone (20 mg/kg), although this led to lower brain concentrations of lorazepam at the time of testing.", 
    "52": "Two cases of benzodiazepine-induced thrombocytopenia are described. Drug-dependent antibodies with antiplatelet activity of the IgG class were detected by inhibition of complement-dependent hemolysis. This technique permitted also the demonstration of cross-reactivity of these antibodies with different benzodiazepines.", 
    "53": "Rats were exposed to a fixed-interval 60-s schedule under which responding was maintained by electrical stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus. The duration of stimulation was controlled by the duration of each lever press that initiated reinforcement. The effects of variation in current intensity and administration of several chlordiazepoxide (CDP) doses (2.5--20 mg/kg IP) were investigated. The duration of stimulation was inversely related to current intensity. Administration of CDP resulted in increases in response rate and the durations of reinforced and non-reinforced responses. CDP increased the response duration reliably more with non-reinforced responses than with responses that served to regulate the duration of stimulation. Thus CDP-induced increases in the duration of brain stimulation with the single lever self-regulation procedure may not be attributed to a specific effect of this compound on neural processes underlying reinforcement. The present results indicate the utility of intermittent schedules in establishing the specificity of drug effects on self-regulated duration of brain stimulation in the single-lever condition.", 
    "54": "A number of compounds have been tested for their abilities to inhibit the rapid uptake of adenosine by rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes. Prostaglandins PGI2, PGA2, and PGE1 and PGE2 were potent inhibitors of adenosine uptake with IC20 values in the 10(-7) M-10(-6) M range. PGA1, PGD2 and PGF2 alpha also inhibited uptake but were less active. The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 inhibited adenosine uptake and failed to antagonize the effects of diazepam. Another antagonist, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, was a weak inhibitor of adenosine uptake. Ro 5-4864, the so-called peripheral benzodiazepine ligand, inhibited adenosine uptake. Hydroxyzine and tracazolate, two anxiolytic agents, inhibited uptake as did flunarizine, a coronary vasodilator. Two calmodulin antagonists, W7 and R 24571, were effective inhibitors of adenosine uptake. Their IC50 values were comparable to those at which they have been demonstrated to inhibit calmodulin-mediated reactions in other systems. These observations suggest that adenosine uptake may be a calmodulin-regulated process.", 
    "55": "Lever pressing by squirrel monkeys was maintained under second-order schedules of either food presentation or IM cocaine injection. Under one second-order schedule, every tenth response produced a brief (1-s) visual stimulus and the first brief stimulus presented after 30 min had elapsed was followed either by ten 300 mg food pellets or by a 3.0 mg IM injection of cocaine. Under another second-order schedule, the first response after 3 min produced the brief stimulus and the tenth brief stimulus was followed either by food or by cocaine. The two types of second-order schedules generated distinctly different patterns of responding. Furthermore, the temporal distribution of responding maintained by food presentation or cocaine injection sometimes differed slightly under the same schedule. Food presentation or cocaine injection occurred only at the end of each daily session, thereby allowing assessment of the effects of presession administration of cocaine, chlorpromazine (CPZ), and chlordiazepoxide (CDP) on responding at times when the direct effects of consequent cocaine injections were minimal or absent. Presession treatment with suitable doses of cocaine increased low rates of food- or cocaine-maintained responding under both types of second-order schedules, whereas CPZ only decreased responding. CDP increased responding in some monkeys, whereas in other monkeys it had little or no effect. Individual differences in the effects of CDP were not related to the schedule of reinforcement, the maintaining event, or the control rate of responding. Thus, the behavioral effects of cocaine, CDP, and CPZ were largely independent of whether responding was maintained by food or by cocaine.", 
    "56": "Three metabolites (F 1756, diazepam and N-desmethyl-diazepam) of N-methyl-N'-methyl-2'-allyl-2-benzoyl-4-chloro-glycinanilide (F 1797), a new potential anxiolytic agent, are formed by N-desmethylation or cyclisation in the rat. They were compared with F 1797 for their antileptazol activity in order to assess their contribution to the effect of the parent compound. F 1756 had little effect in this test. However, diazepam and N-desmethyl-diazepam formed after F 1797 certainly contributed to its antileptazol effect.", 
    "57": "Treatment with drugs that produce active metabolites in the organism may sometimes resemble playing cards that includes a joker. Both kinetically and dynamically the metabolites may be different from their parent compound, and antiepileptic drugs are no exception. Primidone, carbamazepine and valproate all have active metabolites, and the various problems which these mean for the treatment of epileptic patients are briefly discussed. Models for studying a parent compound and its active metabolite parallelly in man have been proposed for diazepam. These and other may be applied to antiepileptic drugs in order to increase the quality of their clinical use and the development of new drugs.", 
    "58": "The benzodiazepines are typified by a profile of side effects which includes drowsiness, ataxia and incoordination. Ro 15-1788, an imidazodiazepine derivative, exhibits marked antagonism of the behavioural and biochemical effects of the benzodiazepines in animals and man. It is devoid of any behavioural activity in animals, except at very high doses. In the present study the effects of single rising oral doses of Ro 15-1788 on cognitive, psychomotor and subjective function in man have been assessed using a battery of psychometric tests designed to identify the sedative action of the benzodiazepines. At all doses up to 600 mg, Ro 15-1788 demonstrated none of the classical behavioural effects of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "59": "Halazepam and its major metabolite desmethyldiazepam (DMDZ) can be reliably quantitated in human plasma following single doses of halazepam. After addition of appropriate internal standards, halazepam and DMDZ are extracted directly into an organic solvent at physiological pH. The organic extract is separated, evaporated to dryness, reconstituted, and directly chromatographed using a 50:50 methyl:phenyl silicone column (SP-2250) and an electron-capture detector. After a single 40 mg oral dose of halazepam, the parent compound appears in plasma only transiently and at low levels. DMDZ appears in higher concentrations and is slowly eliminated. During multiple-dose therapy with halazepam, DMDZ will be the major active substance in blood.", 
    "60": "This study compared the effects of l-tryptophan (1 g), secobarbital (100 mg), flurazepam (30 mg), and placebo on sleep in 96 serious insomniacs. Each treatment was given nightly for 7 nights in a separate-group design. Outcome measures were subjective estimates by subjects of a number of sleep parameters during the week of treatment and for 1 week after, and an overall evaluation made by subjects and investigators at the end of the 2 weeks. During the treatment week, flurazepam produced significant improvement on several sleep measures compared to placebo, while tryptophan and secobarbital did not. Flurazepam and secobarbital produced withdrawal symptoms during the post-treatment week, while tryptophan and placebo did not. Sleep latency was not significantly improved by tryptophan during the treatment week, but continued to improve during the post-treatment week, resulting in a significant difference between tryptophan and baseline in week 2.", 
    "61": "A sensitive and specific HPLC-assay was developed for the determination of the benzodiazepine antagonist ethyl 8-fluoro-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo-[1,5-a] [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate (Ro 15-1788; envisaged INN: flumazepil) in plasma. Ro 15-1788 and the internal standard were extracted from plasma at a basic pH, separated from coextracted plasma components on a reversed-phase column and quantitated by means of a UV detector. Ro 15-1788 was extracted quantitatively from plasma in the concentration range 25.6 to 300 ng/ml. The sensitivity limit was about 10 ng/ml plasma using a 1-ml specimen. The method was shown to be specific with respect to several benzodiazepines and their main metabolites. The method was successfully applied to pharmacokinetic studies in man after oral and intravenous administration of Ro 15-1788.", 
    "62": "On the basis of results obtained from passive avoidance studies, we have argued that the neuropeptide vasopressin could act on arousal, rather than memory processes in rats (Sahgal et al. 1982). In this report, we examine the effects of substances that are known to increase (d-amphetamine) or decrease (chlordiazepoxide) behavioural arousal, and compare the data with those obtained after vasopressin or oxytocin treatment. All four substances yielded broadly similar bimodal results (although the oxytocin data failed to reach significance). We argue for an arousal interpretation which suggests that performance and arousal are related in an \"inverted-U\" manner. The data also indicate that care must be taken in selecting appropriate statistical tests.", 
    "63": "The effect of diazepam (0, 5, 10 mg) and methylphenidate (0, 5, 10 mg) on the identification of briefly displayed letter strings composing words was investigated. Each letter was presented for 70 ms. The interstimulus interval (ISI) between two successive letters was 10, 100 or 200 ms. The length of the words (WL) was three, five, seven or nine letters. The dependent variable was the number of correctly identified words. As predicted, strong visual masking effects, the strength of which was dependent on ISI and WL, appeared. In the 10 ms condition, diazepam at both doses, but not methylphenidate, further enhanced masking. It is suggested that the results reflect the effect of GABA on masking, and support certain psychological theories about the inhibitory neuronal pathways that are involved in masking. The human peripheral visual system is a promising model for the experimental assessment and integration of pharmacodynamic, neurophysiological and psychological observations.", 
    "64": "Negative contrast that occurs when rats are shifted from 32% to 4% sucrose has been shown to be reduced by chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and ethanol (ETOH). In a previous experiment, doses of 0.75 and 1.0 g/kg ETOH substantially reduced contrast while doses of 0.25 and 0.5 g/kg ETOH were much less effective. In this study, doses of 6 and 8 mg/kg CDP were shown to attenuate the negative contrast effect while smaller doses (2 and 4 mg/kg) influenced contrast to a lesser degree. Evidence for an additive effect of CDP and ETOH on contrast reduction was obtained when 4 mg/kg CDP and 0.5 g/kg ETOH were administered together.", 
    "65": "Psychological performance tasks were given to normal subjects under different conditions of experimental stress: high stress (being filmed on video), or low stress (tested without filming); and after different pharmacological treatments: clobazam 20 mg (an anxiolytic 1,5-benzodiazepine derivative), or placebo. On all five performance assessments (choice reaction times, serial subtraction times, critical flicker fusion values), there was a consistent tendancy for clobazam performance to be comparatively better under high stress, and for placebo performance to be comparatively better under low stress. From these, and previous similar findings, it seems that the level of experimental \"stress\" under which subjects are tested, can have important influences upon the psychopharmacological performance levels obtained.", 
    "66": "The maturation of temporal acuity in the auditory system of the rat was evaluated following prenatal exposure to diazepam (DZ; 0, 2.5, 10 mg/kg to the dam on each of the last 8 days of gestation). Acuity was defined by the effectiveness of brief silent periods in white noise (gaps) as in inhibitors of an immediately subject acoustic startle reflex. In uninjected control rats the gaps became effective at 25-28 days of age, and onset was delayed in prenatally exposed animals according to dose. No DZ was present in the rat offspring at animals in adulthood (0, 0.5, 1.5, 4.5 mg/kg). These injections reduced the inhibitory effect of the gap on startle behavior in all animals, but less so in those previously exposed to DZ in utero. The threshold of temporal acuity in the rat approximates that found in humans and the function matures at the same relative rate in the two species. Further, administration of DZ in the adult human has the same effect on temporal acuity in the auditory system as it does in the adult rat. There are presently no data available on the effects on human auditory development of exposure to DZ in utero. The data we present have the importance of temporal acuity in the perception of speech and, thus, in the maturation of language ability.", 
    "67": "A sensitive (to 3 ng/ml) and specific method for analysis of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 is described. The method utilizes gas-liquid chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. A neutral pH ethyl acetate extraction of 0.1-3.0 ml plasma is used for sample preparation. Standard curves using methylclonazepam as the internal standard are linear for plasma concentrations up to 200 ng/ml. Applicability of the method is demonstrated by a pharmacokinetic study in a normal volunteer who received 10 mg Ro 15-1788 intravenously.", 
    "68": "Serum levels of free diazepam as determined with equilibrium dialysis depend on the composition of the dialyzing buffer with respect to Ca2+ and Cl-. Physiological concentrations of these ions double the obtained free serum levels, in line with data of diazepam containing albumin solutions. The diazepam binding capacity of serum was found to be higher than that of albumin alone, suggesting that albumin is probably not the only diazepam binding protein in serum. Evidence was also found that the diazepam binding to these other serum proteins is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and Cl-.", 
    "69": "Intraventricular (IVT) administration of digoxin (7.5 micrograms) induced 'popcorn-type' convulsions in rats. Though the convulsions looked similar to morphine-induced seizures, naloxone failed to antagonize these effects. Other anticonvulsants like phenobarbitone, ethosuximide, or GABAergic substances like piracetam and semicarbazide also had no protective effect against digoxin-induced convulsions. While calcium chloride potentiated these effects of digoxin, phenytoin, magnesium chloride, and potassium chloride treatment showed blocking actions. These observations suggest the involvement of Na/K-ATPase system in digoxin-induced convulsions. Clonidine and diazepam also provided protection against digoxin-induced convulsions through an unknown mechanism.", 
    "70": "The protective effects of acute and chronic diazepam administration (4 mg/kg) against seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) and picrotoxin were investigated. Considering the incidence of tonic-clonic convulsions, tolerance to the protective effects of diazepam was evident by day 5 if the mice were challenged with PTZ (120 mg/kg), by day 10 if the challenge was picrotoxin (8 mg/kg) and by day 20 if the challenge was PTZ (105 mg/kg). Diazepam retained its protective effects against tonic-clonic convulsions induced by PTZ (90 and 60 mg/kg) for 45 days, but the incidence of myoclonic jerks revealed tolerance after 5 days.", 
    "71": "The role of reinforcers in influencing choice was studied by use of a schedule that included a random intermixing of reinforced and explicitly non-reinforced components. The just-reinforced response had a high likelihood of being repeated (win-stay), although there was no differential reinforcement for doing so, whereas responses just followed by explicit non-reinforcement had a very low probability of repetition (lose-stay). Non-parametric indices based on the theory of signal detection were used to derive a choice measure of reinforcement which was independent of alterations in average response rate. Treatments with d-amphetamine (0.2-4.5 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (0.25-16 mg/kg) and alpha-flupenthixol (0.03-0.6 mg/kg) showed that changes in the choice measure could be dissociated from changes in the response rate. These findings were supported by extinction and satiation tests.", 
    "72": "The clinical, biologic, and pathologic features and the course and treatment of acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) due to drug hypersensitivity are reviewed. The authors report 19 additional cases of AIN, outlining some particular and unusual features. The drugs most often responsible now are penicillins and cephalosporins, cotrimoxazole, thiazide diuretics, glafenin and its derivatives, and nonsteroid anti-inflammatory agents. Diagnosis of AIN should be considered in any case of rapidly progressive renal failure occurring during drug therapy, especially when fever, skin rash, arthralgias, macroscopic hematuria, and blood or urinary eosinophilia are present. In the absence of the preceding symptoms, systematic early renal biopsy may be helpful to detect intersitial infiltrates containing lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils and/or granulomas with epithelioid cells. Immunologic tests are inconstantly positive. Their sensitivity and specificity often are doubtful in the absence of precise knowledge of the pathogenetic factors involved. Recovery may be hastened in some cases by corticoid therapy. Recurrence of the disease will be avoided by definitive suppression of offending and related drug(s).", 
    "73": "In two experiments, phenobarbitone sodium (30 mg/kg) reliably enhanced water consumption and extended the duration of drinking in 24h water-deprived male rats. The opiate receptor antagonists naloxone (0.1-10 mg/kg) and naltrexone (0.1-10 mg/kg) both decreased water intake and reduced the duration of drinking. When the barbiturate was given in conjunction with either naloxone or naltrexone, phenobarbitone and the opiate antagonist exerted opposite effects on the two measures of drinking. While it was true that both opiate antagonists reduced water intake and drinking duration in barbiturate-treated animals, the barbiturate-induced enhancement of drinking was in no way modified by concurrent opiate antagonist treatment. Hence, the effects of phenobarbitone and of the two opiate antagonists upon the drinking measures appeared to be quite independent. There was no evidence, therefore, that the effects of phenobarbitone upon drinking were related to endogenous opioid mechanisms. The possible contrast between benzodiazepine- and barbiturate-induced hyperdipsia is briefly considered in the light of these results.", 
    "74": "Pharmacokinetics as the basis for dosage calculation for acute and subacute treatment of status epilepticus have been discussed. Bolus injection and intravenous infusion are the most common forms of drug administration in these cases. Rectal administration may be a good alternative in certain conditions. Intravenous diazepam and phenytoin are the first-line drugs against status epilepticus. Diazepam and sodium valproate have been reported to be effective by the rectal route. Depending on its pharmacokinetic parameters, each drug effect has a different onset, intensity, and time course.", 
    "75": "In order to study the role of GABA in behaviour, various GABA-mimetic and GABA-blocking drugs were tested for their effects on a conditioned avoidance response (CAR). Sodium valproate slowed the acquisition of CAR and failed to affect the latency of a well-learned CAR, but interestingly, showed a marked anti-conflict effect similar to that of benzodiazepine-derivatives. The similarity of effects of drugs such as benzodiazepines and sodium valproate, which are postulated to potentiate GABA-ergic transmission, suggests that GABA plays a role in conditioning, memory and learning.", 
    "76": "The speed, side effects and cardiovascular changes associated with anaesthetic induction and endotracheal intubation following alfentanil (20 micrograms/kg/min, IV), thiopental (84 micrograms/kg/min, IV), etomidate (5 micrograms/kg/min, IV) and midazolam (20 micrograms/kg/min, IV) prior to halothane-nitrous oxide general anaesthesia were evaluated and compared in 80 patients undergoing elective general surgical operations. Anaesthetic induction was fastest with etomidate and thiopental (approximately one minute) and slowest with midazolam (about two minutes). Systolic arterial blood pressure (SBP) was decreased at the moment of unconsciousness with thiopental but unchanged with the other compounds. Heart rate (HR) was increased at unconsciousness with midazolam and thiopental but unchanged with etomidate and alfentanil. After intubation HR was increased in all groups except those induced with alfentanil. Arrhythmias were infrequent (5 per cent or less in all groups). Rigidity during induction only occurred with alfentanil (55 per cent) and pain on injection only with etomidate (35 per cent) and alfentanil (5 per cent). Postoperative vomiting was infrequent in all groups (15 per cent) except etomidate (55 per cent). No patient remembered any aspect of laryngoscopy or the operation and all rapidly regained consciousness at the end of operation. The results of this study demonstrate that with the exception of rigidity (which is easily overcome with succinylcholine) and a slightly slower onset of action, alfentanil compares favourably as an induction agent with thiopental and is better than midazolam and etomidate. Alfentanil is superior to all three other induction agents with respect to cardiovascular stability during induction and intubation."
