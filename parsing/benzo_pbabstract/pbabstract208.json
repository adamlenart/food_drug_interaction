    "0": "A parenteral formulation for the water-insoluble benzodiazepine diazepam was developed. Different cyclodextrins (CDs) suitable for parenteral injection: hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD), hydroxy-propyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HP-gamma-CD), sulfobutylether-7-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-7-beta-CD) and maltosyl-beta-cyclodextrin (malt-beta-CD) were used as alternatives to cosolvents to increase solubility. The increase in solubility displayed a concentration dependency for the four CDs used. Diazepam's solubility is enhanced linearly as a function of each CD concentration. The highest improvements in solubility (dissolved concentration circa 3.5 mg/ml in 40% CD) were found by adding HP-beta-CD or SBE-7-beta-CD. The additional use of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) did not further increase the solubility of diazepam with HP-beta-CD. A parenteral aqueous diazepam solution was prepared containing 10 mg diazepam/5 ml 30% HP-beta-CD or SBE-7-beta-CD solution. The preparations are in agreement with the requirements for parenteralia. Sterilisation by filtration is required since autoclaving degrades the active compound. The stability of the preparations, with and without pH adjustment to pH 5, was investigated during 18 months and during this period no noticeable degradation was observed.", 
    "1": "The resource investment required to characterise the metabolic fate of a compound is relatively large, meaning that within a drug discovery environment relatively few compounds are characterised in depth. Rate-limiting steps include the setting up of a complex array of mass spectrometry experiments and the subsequent analysis of the large data sets produced. We describe here a strategy for the evaluation of metabolic routes using full-scan high-resolution liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/QToFMS) with automated data analysis using Metabolynx, a commercially available software package. Data from several structurally diverse compounds taken from the literature illustrate that, with careful setting of key parameters, this approach is able to indicate the presence of a wide range of metabolites with only a limited requirement for manual intervention.",

    "6": "There have been conflicting reports as to whether olanzapine produces lower occupancy of striatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor than typical antipsychotic drugs and preferential occupancy of extrastriatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors. We performed [(18)F] fallypride PET studies in six schizophrenic subjects treated with olanzapine and six schizophrenic subjects treated with haloperidol to examine the occupancy of striatal and extrastriatal dopamine receptors by these antipsychotic drugs. [(18)F] setoperone PET studies were performed in seven olanzapine-treated subjects to determine 5-HT(2A) receptor occupancy. Occupancy of dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors by olanzapine was not significantly different from that seen with haloperidol in the putamen, ventral striatum, medial thalamus, amygdala, or temporal cortex, that is, 67.5-78.2% occupancy; olanzapine produced no preferential occupancy of dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors in the ventral striatum, medial thalamus, amygdala, or temporal cortex. There was, however, significantly lower occupancy of substantia nigra/VTA dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors in olanzapine-treated compared to haloperidol-treated subjects, that is, 40.2 vs 59.3% (p=0.0014, corrected for multiple comparisons); in olanzapine-treated subjects, the substantia nigra/VTA was the only region with significantly lower dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor occupancy than the putamen, that is, 40.2 vs 69.2% (p<0.001, corrected for multiple comparison). Occupancy of 5-HT(2A) receptors was 85-93% in the olanzapine- treated subjects. The results of this study demonstrated that olanzapine does not produce preferential occupancy of extrastriatal dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptors but does spare substantia nigra/VTA receptors. Sparing of substantia nigra/VTA dopamine D(2)/D(3) receptor occupancy may contribute to the low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects in olanzapine-treated patients.", 
    "7": "Clinically, it has been reported that chronic pain induces depression, anxiety, and reduced quality of life. The endogenous opioid system has been implicated in nociception, anxiety, and stress. The present study was undertaken to investigate whether chronic pain could induce anxiogenic effects and changes in the opioidergic function in the amygdala in mice. We found that either injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve ligation produced a significant anxiogenic effect at 4 weeks after the injection or surgery. Under these conditions, the selective mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2,N-MePhe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)- and the selective delta-opioid receptor agonist (+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC80)-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes of the amygdala was significantly suppressed by CFA injection or nerve ligation. CFA injection was associated with a significant increase in the kappa-opioid receptor agonist 2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[(1S)-1-phenyl-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)ethyl]acetamide hydrochloride (ICI199,441)-stimulated [35S]GTPgammaS binding in membranes of the amygdala. The intracerebroventricular administration and microinjection of a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist, a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist, and the endogenous kappa-opioid receptor ligand dynorphin A caused a significant anxiogenic effect in mice. We also found that thermal hyperalgesia induced by sciatic nerve ligation was reversed at 8 weeks after surgery. In the light-dark test, the time spent in the lit compartment was not changed at 8 weeks after surgery. Collectively, the present data constitute the first evidence that chronic pain has an anxiogenic effect in mice. This phenomenon may be associated with changes in opioidergic function in the amygdala.", 
    "8": "Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may increase the risk of impulsive acts including suicide, while data from epidemiological studies suggest that the effect of SSRIs in the elderly may be beneficial. We aimed to evaluate the association between exposure to antidepressants and suicidality in a cohort of elderly patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD). This was a retrospective matched case-controlled evaluation over a 10-year period. All records of admissions of patients with MDD (ICD-10) were assessed. The index group comprised all patients who had attempted suicide in the month prior to admission. The case-controlled group was the next admission of a patient suffering from MDD, matched for sex and age who had not attempted suicide in the month prior to admission. The index group during the 10-year period (1995-2004) consisted of 101 patients suffering from MDD who were hospitalized following a suicide attempt. Mean age for the group was 76.5+/-6.6 years; there were 42 men and 59 women. The control group patients (N=101) were matched for age (mean 76.6+/-6.9 years) and sex. The proportion of patients exposed to an antidepressant was significantly greater in the control group, than in the group of patients who had attempted suicide (58 vs 42%, odds ratio 1.94 (95% CI: 1.1-3.4), p=0.019). SSRIs were prescribed in 29% of patients in the control group vs 21% of patients in the index group (p=0.03). It is of interest to note that concomitant prescription of benzodiazepines also conferred a protective effect. In conclusion, elderly depressed patients treated with antidepressants may be at reduced risk of attempting suicide. These findings need support from prospective randomized trials.", 
    "9": "The amygdala is involved in behavioral and physiological responses to fear, and the anxiolytic properties of several drugs are localized to this region. Activation of endogenous opioid systems is known to occur in response to stress and a growing body of literature suggests that opioid systems regulate the properties of anxiolytic drugs. These experiments sought to elucidate the role of opioid receptors in the central (CeA) and basolateral (BLA) nuclei of the amygdala in regulating the anxiolytic properties of ethanol and diazepam. Male rats fitted with cannula received bilateral microinjections of the nonselective opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (NAL) immediately followed by systemic delivery of either ethanol (1 g/kg) or diazepam (2 mg/kg) in the elevated plus maze. Both diazepam and ethanol decreased anxiety-like behavior. Delivery of NAL into the CeA blocked the anxiolytic properties of diazepam. Delivery of NAL into the BLA slightly increased open arm avoidance, but had no effect on the anxiolytic properties of diazepam. Microinjection of NAL into either nucleus failed to block the effects of ethanol. These results were specific to the anxiolytic properties of diazepam, since baseline behaviors were unaffected by microinjection of NAL. Microinjection of lidocaine produced results distinct from NAL and failed to block the anxiolytic actions of diazepam. These studies indicate distinct roles for opioid receptor systems in the CeA and BLA in regulating the anxiolytic properties of diazepam in the elevated plus maze. Further, opioid receptor systems in the CeA and BLA do not regulate the anxiolytic properties of ethanol in this test.", 
    "10": "Gefitinib (Iressa) is an anticancer drug that selectively inhibits tyrosine kinases of epidermal growth factor receptor. Gefitinib might affect CYP3A4-mediated metabolism, since the drug is a substrate of human CYP3A. In this study, we evaluated the effects of gefitinib on drug metabolism catalyzed by human CYP3A4. The effects of gefitinib on the CYP3A4-mediated formation of NPC (7-ethyl-10-(4-amino-1-piperidino)carbonyloxycamptothecin) and that of APC (7-ethyl-10-[4-N-(5-aminopentanoic acid)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxycamptothecin) from irinotecan were examined with the use of human liver and small intestinal microsomes. Gefitinib inhibited the formation of NPC in liver and small intestinal microsomes. The apparent intrinsic metabolic clearance (CL(int)) in the presence of 40 microM gefitinib was equivalent to about 26% of control in liver microsomes and 45% of control in small intestinal microsomes. Gefitinib stimulated the formation of APC by CYP3A4. CL(int) in the presence of 20 microM gefitinib with human liver microsomes was about 1.9 times higher than control. In human small intestinal microsomes, APC formation was enhanced by the addition of gefitinib at concentrations 20 microM or higher. CL(int) in the presence of 40 microM gefitinib was 2.8 times higher than control. Thus, we discovered that gefitinib inhibited the formation of NPC but stimulated the formation of APC from irinotecan.", 
    "11": "Clinical guidelines for treatment and research of bipolar disorder greatly benefit from the synthesis of data from individual studies. The British Association for Psychopharmacology bases its guidelines on evidence from opinions (level D) to systematic reviews of primary trial data (level A). The report details conclusions of its 1-day consensus meeting to develop guidelines covering diagnosis, clinical management, pharmacotherapy for acute episodes, relapse prevention and treatment discontinuation. Monotherapy for long-term management is preferred, having reduced side-effects and drug interactions and improved compliance. Combination therapy is often preferred for acute episodes, using antipsychotics for mania or antidepressants for depression. Increased efficacy may be attributed to multiple mechanisms of action and potentially lower doses. In clinical practice, maintenance monotherapy has limited success for chronic episodes and polypharmacy is frequently used, though the best combination remains unclear. A new collaborative approach based on simple clinical trials is required to change current medical practice.", 
    "12": "A hexane extract of leaves of Annona cherimolia produced anxiolytic-like actions when administered to mice and tested in two animal models of anxiety: the mouse avoidance exploratory behavior and the burying behavior tests. In order to discard unspecific drug-actions on general activity, all treatments studied in the anxiety paradigms were also analyzed in the open field test. Results showed that A. cherimolia induced anxiolytic-like actions at the doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25.0 and 50.0 mg/kg. Picrotoxin (0.25 mg/kg), a GABA-gated chloride ion channel blocker, antagonized the anxiolytic-like actions of A. cherimolia, while a sub-effective dose of muscimol (0.5 mg/kg), a selective GABA(A) receptor agonist, facilitated the effects of a sub-optimal dose of A. cherimolia (3.12 mg/kg). Thus, the involvement of the GABA(A) receptor complex in the anxiolytic-like actions of A. cherimolia hexane extract is suggested. In addition the extract was also able to enhance the duration of sodium pentobarbital induced sleeping time. Taken together, results indicate that the hexane extract of A. cherimolia has depressant activity on the Central Nervous System and could interact with the GABA(A) receptor complex. On the other hand, the chromatographic separation of this extract led to the isolation of palmitone, and beta-sitosterol as major constituents. In addition a GC-MS study of some fractions revealed the presence of several compounds such beta-cariophyllene, beta-selinene, alpha-cubebene, and linalool that have been reported to show effects on behavior that could explain some of the extract effects.", 
    "13": "NCSE, once thought to be a rare disorder, should be considered in any patient presenting with an alteration in mental status of indeterminate cause. The psychiatrist needs to be aware of the different clinical characteristics of this disorder as well as similarities and differences from psychiatric disorders. A history of seizure is not necessary for the diagnosis, nor is motor activity necessarily associated with NCSE. An EEG is required to confirm the diagnosis and should be performed when possible, because early recognition and treatment may improve outcome. There is usually a good response to an intravenous benzodiazepine; when response has been delayed, other anticonvulsants have been used as adjuncts. The EEG is necessary to distinguish AS from CPS so that, when indicated, the proper long-term antiepileptic drug therapy can be started. Although NCSE has been described in the literature for many years, there is still a great need for carefully designed prospective studies to help define clear guidelines to assist in clinical and management decision making and, ultimately, to improve outcomes.",

    "18": "During status epilepticus (SE), GABAergic mechanisms fail and seizures become self-sustaining and pharmacoresistant. During lithiumpilocarpine-induced SE, our studies of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors in dentate gyrus granule cells show a reduction in the amplitude of miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs). Anatomical studies show a reduction in the colocalization of the beta2/beta3 and gamma2 subunits of GABA(A) receptors with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin and an increase in the proportion of those subunits in the interior of dentate granule cells and other hippocampal neurons with SE. Unlike synaptic mIPSCs, the amplitude of extrasynaptic GABA(A) tonic currents is augmented during SE. Mathematical modeling suggests that the change of mIPSCs with SE reflects a decrease in the number of functional postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors. It also suggests that increases in extracellular [GABA] during SE can account for the tonic current changes and can affect postsynaptic receptor kinetics with a loss of paired-pulse inhibition. GABA exposure mimics the effects of SE on mIPSC and tonic GABA(A) current amplitudes in granule cells, consistent with the model predictions. These results provide a potential mechanism for the inhibitory loss that characterizes initiation of SE and for the pharmacoresistance to benzodiazepines, as a reduction of available functional GABA(A) postsynaptic receptors. Novel therapies for SE might be directed toward prevention or reversal of these losses.",

The changes for the two measures were highly correlated with each other (r =-0.94, P < 0.001) based on aggregate values at individual time points. However, the variations in area under the curve of pharmacodynamic effect vs. time (AUCeffect) measured by either method did not reflect the variations in plasma AUC across individuals.

Because of respiratory failure due to generalized muscle spasm, she was intubated and required mechanical ventilation. Midazolam was administered as an antispastic therapy followed by human tetanus immune globulin and tetanus toxoid. Propofol was added on 9 days after intubation, since muscle spasm such as opisthotonus or respiratory spasm did not improve under midazolam and intermittent administration of vecuronium. Thereafter, her muscle spasm and hypertensive response were well controlled.

Most such patients (29/32) were controlled with 2-6 capsules of cyamemazine (100-300 mg). In the PP population, cyamemazine (n = 28) was significantly non-inferior to diazepam (n = 33), with a threshold of 10% for non-inferiority bound and 2.5% for one-sided type I error rate.

Ketamine produces its anesthetic effects primarily by N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism, but it may also have GABA(A) receptor agonistic properties. By using PET, we studied the cerebral (11)C-flumazenil binding in 10 healthy subjects before and during a subanesthetic racemic ketamine infusion reaching a serum concentration of 350 +/- 42 ng/mL.

    "35": "The immature brain is intrinsically hyperexcitable, a feature that, despite being crucial for learning, synaptogenesis and neuronal plasticity, predisposes the neonate to seizures. Seizures represent the most common neurologic manifestation of impaired brain function in this age group. Importantly, although seizure-induced neuronal injury is minimal in the \"healthy\" neonatal brain, the \"metabolically-compromised\" brain appears more vulnerable. Even in the \"healthy\" brain, however, seizures result in impaired learning, enhanced susceptibility to further seizures, and increased risk of brain injury with seizures later in life, as a result of altered hippocampal circuitry. Given these findings, an aggressive approach to neonatal seizures appears warranted. However, our current conventional therapies (including phenobarbital, phenytoin, and benzodiazepines), even when used in combination, are often ineffective in controlling seizures. Lidocaine may yield better efficacy but requires more study. Recent animal data suggest that alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole proprionic acid (AMPA) antagonists such as topiramate may have a neuroprotective role. However, further work is needed to confirm the safety of excitatory amino acid antagonists in neonates because there remains a prevailing concern that such agents may impair normal neurodevelopmental processes.",

This disturbance is always associated with the existence of ascites and is characterized by an inability to adjust the amount of water excreted in the urine to the amount of water ingested. Vasopressin (AVP) is of major importance in the pathogenesis of water retention and hyponatremia in cirrhosis. 2 The current study assessed the renal, hormonal and hemodynamic effects induced by 10-day chronic oral administration of RWJ-351647 (0.5 mg kg(-1) daily), a new nonpeptide V(2)-AVP antagonist, in rats with CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis, ascites and severe water retention. Urine volume (UV), urine osmolality and sodium and potassium excretion were measured daily. At the end of the study, systemic hemodynamic parameters were also assessed. 3 Long-term administration of RWJ-351647 has an aquaretic effect in rats with cirrhosis, ascites, water retention and hypo-osmolality. It increases UV (ANOVA: F=7.32, P<0.0001) and reduces urine osmolality (ANOVA: F=12.69, P<0.0001) throughout the entire period of treatment, thereby leading to a greater renal ability to excrete a water load at the end of the 10-day treatment period (the percentage of water load excreted improved from 30+/-8 to 92+/-21%, P<0.025). 4 The nonpeptide AVP V(2)-receptor antagonist RWJ-351647 also increased sodium excretion without affecting creatinine clearance and blood pressure. 5 These data suggest that RWJ-351647 could be therapeutically useful in the treatment of water retention in human cirrhosis.",

Recently, we have found in young normal male controls after repetitive administration of NPY a shortened sleep latency and a decrease of time awake and, in the second half of the night, EEG delta-power; cortisol and ACTH levels were blunted. Since during depression there is an overactivity of CRH, we tested the capacity of NPY to affect sleep endocrine activity in patients with depression compared with controls.

Throughout the night ACTH, cortisol and prolactin levels were measured, simultaneously the sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Depressed patients as well as healthy controls exhibited significant shortening of sleep onset latency (SOL) (mean+/-SD; controls: 41.9+/-48.2 min PL vs 22.1+/-17.3 min NPY; patients: 31.8+/-19.8 min PL vs 24.7+/-20.1 min NPY; P<0.06) and REM latency (controls: 79.3+/-27.5 min PL vs 69.0+/-19.4 min NPY; patients: 79.8+/-45.5 min PL vs 52.4+/-51.2 min NPY; P<0.05). Both patients and controls showed a trend to an increase of prolactin during the night. In contrast to our recent observation in young normal subjects time awake, ACTH and cortisol remained unchanged in patients and controls in response to NPY. Whereas also an adaptation effect may contribute to the shortening of SOL, this change and the prolactin elevation are in line with a CRH antagonistic and GABA(A) agonistic/benzodiazepine-like effect of NPY. The lack of effects on time awake and HPA hormones may be explained by the higher CRH activity due to age and depression in the investigated samples in comparison to our recent study in young subjects.", 
    "43": "A simple, sensitive, selective, and reproducible reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method with UV detection was developed for the determination of lorazepam (LZP) in human plasma, using oxazepam (OZP) as internal standard. LZP and OZP were extracted from alkalinized (pH 9.5) spiked and clinical plasma samples using a single step liquid-liquid extraction with a mixture of n-hexane-dichloromethane (70:30%; v/v). Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed-phase Synergi Max RP analytical column (150 mmx4.6 mm i.d.; 4 microm particle size), using an aqueous mobile phase (10 mM KH2PO4 buffer (pH 2.4)-acetonitrile; 65:35%, v/v) delivered at a flow-rate of 2.5 ml/min. Retention times for OZP and LZP were 10.2 and 11.9 min, respectively. Calibration curves were linear from 10 to 300 ng with correlation coefficients (r2) better than 0.99. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were 2.5 and 10 ng/ml, respectively, using 0.5 ml samples. The mean relative recoveries at 20 and 300 ng/ml were 84.1+/-5.5% (n=6) and 72.4+/-5.9% (n=7), respectively; for OZP at 200 ng the value was 68.2+/-6.8% (n=14). The intra-assay relative standard deviations (R.S.D.) at 20, 150 and 270 ng/ml of LZP were 7.8%, 9.8% (n=7 in all cases) and 6.6% (n=8), respectively. The inter-assay R.S.D. at the above concentrations were 15.9%, 7.7% and 8.4% (n=7 in all cases), respectively. Intra- and inter-assay accuracy data were within the acceptance interval of +/-20% of the nominal values. There was no interference from other commonly co-administered anticonvulsant, antimicrobial, antipyretic, and antimalarial drugs. The method has been successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of LZP in children with severe malaria and convulsions following administration of a single intravenous dose (0.1 mg/kg body weight) of LZP.", 
    "44": "Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment as a result of human and veterinary use, posing relevant environmental concerns. The present paper reports the acute toxic effects of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate and clofibric acid) and a detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), to the hypersaline crustacean Artemia parthenogenetica. This study specially focused on oxidative stress parameters, namely (1) total and selenium-dependent glutathione-peroxidase (GPx), (2) glutathione reductase (GRed), (3) total superoxide dismutase (SOD), and (4) glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). The effects of tested substances on lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS), and soluble cholinesterases (ChE) were also investigated. Diazepam caused a significant inhibition of ChE (LOEC = 7.04 mg/l) and total GPx activities. SDS was responsible for a decrease in the activity of both ChE (LOEC = 8.46 mg/l) and GRed (LOEC = 4.08 mg/l). Both fibrates (clofibrate and clofibric acid) were responsible for significant decreases in Se-dependent GPx, with LOEC values of 176.34 and 3.09 mg/l, respectively. Clofibrate also caused a slight increase of TBARS content of A. parthenogenetica homogenates. These results indicate that the exposure to all the tested compounds induced alterations on the cellular redox status in A. parthenogenetica. In addition, diazepam was shown to have the capability of interfering with A. parthenogenetica neurotransmission, through the inhibition of ChE.", 
    "45": "Alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists have been shown to have neuroprotective effects in stroke models and although clinical trials with some agents are still ongoing, published results have not been favourable. We therefore wished to compare the effects of GYKI 52466, GYKI 53405, EGIS-8332 and EGIS-10608, non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonists with homophthalazine chemical structures, in standard animal stroke models with effects in a neurodegenerative model--excitoxicity in newborn mice. All compounds inhibited the S-AMPA-induced spreading depression in the chicken retina, in vitro, and were potent anticonvulsants against maximal electroshock in mice, in vivo. The AMPA receptor antagonists prevented domoate-induced cell death of motoneurons, in vitro, and reduced infarct size in a dose-dependent manner in the permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model in mice, in vivo. In newborn mice (P5, histopathology at P10), local injection of the AMPA receptor agonist S-bromo-willardiine at day 5 after birth induced cortical damage and white matter damage, which was reduced in a dose-dependent manner by the AMPA receptor antagonists. EGIS 10608 was a very powerful receptor antagonist of white matter damage. In contrast, GYKI 52466 did not antagonize cortical and white matter damage induced by ibotenic acid. These models allow quantification of the effects of AMPA receptor antagonists in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "46": "Exposure to cat odor, an innate threat stimulus for rats, engages a conditioning process whereby the environment in which the odor was experienced comes to elicit fear. Additionally, response to cat odor appears to change with repeated exposure, with benzodiazepines having an anxiolytic effect upon first, but not second, cat odor exposure. We explored the neural correlates of these two phenomena using Fos immunohistochemistry. Rats were exposed to cat odor (a worn cat collar) and were allowed to hide from this stimulus. A 'trial 1' group was perfused after a single exposure, and a 'trial 2' group after two exposures. A 'context' group was exposed to cat odor once, then perfused after re-exposure to the odor-paired context. Trial 1, trial 2 and context groups showed similar defensive responses including avoidance and hiding. The trial 1 group showed Fos expression in limbic, hypothalamic and brainstem regions associated with defensive behavior. The trial 2 group showed a similar pattern although with less activation in the lateral septum, anterior and ventromedial hypothalamus, and dorsolateral periaqueductal gray. The context-exposed group showed Fos expression in a subset of the regions activated by cat odor itself: the dorsal premammillary nucleus, ventrolateral periaqueductal grey, cuneiform nucleus and locus ceruleus. Little activation was seen in the amygdala or hippocampus. These results show that stimuli associated with predatory threat come to activate similar brain regions to the threat stimulus itself.", 
    "47": "The two recently characterized vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUT) presynaptically mark and differentiate two distinct excitatory neuronal populations and thus define a cortical and a subcortical glutamatergic system (VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 positive, respectively). These two systems might be differentially implicated in brain neuropathology. Still, little is known on the modalities of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 regulations in response to pharmacological or physiological stimuli. Given the importance of cortical neuronal activity in psychosis we investigated VGLUT1 mRNA and protein expression in response to chronic treatment with commonly prescribed psychotropic medications. We show that agents with antidepressant activity, namely the antidepressants fluoxetine and desipramine, the atypical antipsychotic clozapine, and the mood stabilizer lithium increased VGLUT1 mRNA expression in neurons of the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus and in concert enhanced VGLUT1 protein expression in their projection fields. In contrast the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, the cognitive enhancers memantine and tacrine, and the anxiolytic diazepam were without effect. We suggest that VGLUT1 could be a useful marker for antidepressant activity. Furthermore, adaptive changes in VGLUT1 positive neurons could constitute a common functional endpoint for structurally unrelated antidepressants, representing promising antidepressant targets in tracking specificity, mechanism, and onset at action.",

    "50": "The study used a crossover design. Measurements were obtained in normovolemic dogs during isoflurane. Hypovolemia was induced (blood loss of 30 mL/kg) and measurements repeated following recovery from anesthesia, after HydroD (hydromorphone, 0.1 mg/kg; diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg; i.v.) or OxyD (oxymorphone, 0.05 mg/kg; diazepam, 0.2 mg/kg; i.v.), after another dose of the same opioid, during administration of isoflurane (end-tidal concentration, 0.9%), and after glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg, i.v.). Significant changes were identified.", 
    "51": "Induction effect was evident within 1 minute. All dogs were intubated after the second dose of opioid. No significant differences were found between inductions. The HydroD decreased heart rate (mean +/- SEM, -41 +/- 9.8 beats/min), whereas both inductions increased stroke index (0.4 +/- 0.09 mL/kg/beat) and caused moderate respiratory depression. Cardiac index was decreased (-30.2 +/- 6.04 mL/kg/min) and there was minor metabolic acidosis during isoflurane following HydroD, compared with values for anesthetized normovolemic dogs. Glycopyrrolate increased heart rate (50 +/- 8.6 beats/min) and decreased systolic blood pressure (-23.2 +/- 4.87 mm Hg) in dogs induced with HydroD and decreased stroke index (-0.3 +/- 0.08 mL/kg/beat) for both inductions.", 
    "52": "Similar effects were detected after administration of HydroD or OxyD in hypovolemic dogs. Either combination should be safe for use in hypovolemic dogs. Administration of glycopyrrolate was not beneficial.", 
    "53": "We studied the effects of lorazepam and dextromethorphan on the responses to 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied to the left human motor cortex. Lorazepam, dextromethorphan or placebo was administered to 45 normal controls in a double-blind fashion 2.5 h before the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation procedure. Motor cortical excitability was measured with single transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses before and after 15 min of 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied at supra-threshold intensity. 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation resulted in a decrease in motor cortical excitability in the placebo group but not in the groups taking lorazepam or dextromethorphan. These results suggest that cortical responses to 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation are dependent on activity at both gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methyl-D-asparate receptor systems.", 
    "54": "The development of a parenteral lorazepam formulation, using cyclodextrins (CDs) as inclusion complexation agents, was investigated. CDs suitable for parenteral injection, i.e., hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD), hydroxypropyl-gamma-cyclodextrin (HP-gamma-CD), sulfobutylether-7-beta-cyclodextrin (SBE-7-beta-CD), and maltosyl-beta-cyclodextrin (malt-beta-CD) were studied for the possibility to increase the solubility of lorazepam. Lorazepam interacted with all tested CD derivatives and 1:1 complexes are formed. HP-beta-CD exerts the highest solubility improvement, reaching about 6 mg/ml lorazepam in 30% (w/v) CD solution. When using SBE-7-beta-CD or malt-beta-CD only half of that concentration can be dissolved. HP-gamma-CD interacts much less with lorazepam. Parenteral solutions with 4 mg/ml in 30% (w/v) HP-beta-CD solution, with 2 mg/ml in 30% (w/v) SBE-7-beta-CD, and with 2 mg/ml lorazepam in 15% (w/v) HP-beta-CD, were prepared. Sterile filtration of the formulation needs to be applied because of massive degradation of lorazepam during autoclaving. No precipitation is observed after dilution of the different formulations with (physiological) water or with 5% dextrose in water, which proves their suitability for administration with perfusions. The stability of the preparations was investigated in aqueous medium. During the first month, in all solutions more than 90% of lorazepam remained; after 3 months, less than 60% of lorazepam remained in the solutions with 15% (w/v) HP-beta-CD and around 65-70% in the solutions with 30% (w/v) of CDs. Because of this short stability time, the preparations need to be lyophilized.", 
    "55": "The protein binding characteristic of 2'-Benzoyloxycinnamaldehyde (BCA) was investigated, which has demonstrated a potent antitumor effect against several human solid tumor cell lines and in human tumor xenograft nude mice. Protein binding of BCA in human serum was 86 +/- 0.91% and the predominant binding protein of BCA was fatty-acid-free human serum albumin (HSA) (81 +/- 0.91%). The binding of BCA to HSA was outlined by one class, and Ka and n of BCA were 1.65 x 10(5) M(- 1) and 0.374, respectively. Displacement studies with fluorescence probes suggested that BCA mainly binds to site I on HSA, and BCA-induced enhancement in site II binding. The limited drug-drug interaction experiments suggested that BCA influences both site I and site II drug-HSA bindings via different mechanisms; a competitive displacement and a probable allosteric conformational change in HSA, respectively.", 
    "56": "In a single-blinded and randomized pilot study efficacy and tolerability of oxcarbazepine versus carbamazepine were investigated in 29 patients during therapy of alcohol withdrawal. No initial differences were found regarding sociodemographic data and alcohol-related parameters, indicating successful randomization. The oxcarbazepine group showed a significant decrease of withdrawal symptoms and reported significantly less 'craving for alcohol' compared to the carbamazepine group. Subjectively experienced side effects, normalization of vegetative parameters and improvement in the cognitive processing speed did not reveal differences for both groups. Therefore, oxcarbazepine might be an interesting alternative to carbamazepine, and having almost no addictive potential, no clinically relevant interaction with alcohol and no prominent sedatory effect, possibly also to other drugs such as benzodiazepines or clomethiazole, in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.",

Investigations were unremarkable for structural and biochemical causes of dystonia. Chorea, paraballismus, and restless legs syndrome are known to occur during pregnancy, attributable to high estrogen levels. Dystonia, on the other hand, has not been described to occur de novo in pregnancy. This association should be considered in women of reproductive age who present with cervical dystonia.", 
    "58": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease presenting with voluntary gaze difficulties, early falls, and Parkinsonism. Neuronal loss, associated with intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and activated microglia, is found targeting the basal ganglia, brainstem nuclei, and frontal cortex. [11C](R)-PK11195 PET is a marker of peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS) expressed by activated microglia. We have used [11C](R)-PK11195 PET to demonstrate in vivo the degree and distribution of the glial response to the degenerative process in four patients with PSP. Compared to normal age-matched controls, the PSP patient group showed significantly increased mean [11C](R)-PK11195 binding in the basal ganglia, midbrain, the frontal lobe, and the cerebellum. Two of the patients were rescanned after 6 to 10 months and during that time the level of microglial activation remained stable. [11C](R)-PK11195 PET reveals a pattern of increased microglial activation in PSP patients involving cortical and subcortical regions that corresponds well with the known distribution of neuropathological changes. [11C](R)-PK11195 PET, therefore, may help in characterizing in vivo the underlying disease activity in PSP.",

    "64": "Excitotoxicity is one pathogenic mechanism proposed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and loss of cortical inhibitory influence may be contributory. Patients with ALS who are homozygous for the D90A superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) gene mutation (homD90A) have a unique phenotype, associated with prolonged survival compared with patients with sporadic ALS (sALS). In this study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to explore cortical excitation and inhibition. Flumazenil binds to the benzodiazepine subunit of the GABA(A) receptor, and (11)C-flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) was used as a marker of cortical neuronal loss and/or dysfunction, which might in turn reflect changes in cortical inhibitory GABAergic mechanisms.", 
    "65": "Cortical responses to single and paired stimulus TMS were compared in 28 patients with sALS and 11 homD90A patients versus 24 controls. TMS measures included resting motor threshold, central motor conduction time, silent period, intracortical inhibition (ICI), and facilitation. (11)C-flumazenil PET of the brain was performed on 20 patients with sALS and nine with homD90A. Statistical parametric mapping was used to directly compare PET images from the two patient groups to identify those areas of relatively reduced cortical (11)C-flumazenil binding that might explain differences in cortical excitability seen using TMS.", 
    "66": "Increased cortical excitability, demonstrated by reduction in ICI, was seen in the patients with sALS but not the homD90A patients. A relative reduction in cortical (11)C-flumazenil binding was found in the motor and motor association regions of the superior parietal cortices of the patients with sALS.", 
    "67": "A cortical inhibitory deficit in sALS was not demonstrable in a homogeneous genetic ALS population of similar disability, suggesting a distinct cortical vulnerability. (11)C-flumazenil PET demonstrated that neuronal loss/dysfunction in motor and motor association areas may underlie this difference. The corollary, that there may be relative preservation of neuronal function in these areas in the homD90A group, has implications for understanding the slower progression of disease in these patients.", 
    "68": "The effects of prolonged exposure to and subsequent withdrawal of the thienotriazolobenzodiazepine etizolam on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor gene expression and function were compared with those of the benzodiazepine lorazepam. Exposure of rat hippocampal neurons in culture to 10 microM etizolam for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha5 and gamma2S receptor subunit mRNAs, whereas etizolam withdrawal was associated with a persistent reduction in gamma2S mRNA and an increase in alpha2 and alpha3 mRNAs. Neither chronic exposure to nor withdrawal of etizolam affected the acute modulatory effects of etizolam or lorazepam on GABA-evoked Cl- current. Treatment with 10 microM lorazepam for 5 days reduced the amounts of alpha1 and gamma2S subunit mRNAs and increased that of alpha3 mRNA, whereas lorazepam withdrawal was associated with persistence of the changes in alpha3 and gamma2S mRNAs and an increase in alpha2 and alpha4 mRNAs. Parallel changes in the abundance of alpha1 and alpha4 subunit proteins induced by chronic exposure to and withdrawal of lorazepam, but not etizolam, were detected by immunocytofluorescence analysis. Chronic lorazepam treatment resulted in a reversible reduction in the modulatory efficacy of this drug and conferred on flumazenil the ability to potentiate GABA-evoked Cl- current. The anticonvulsant action of etizolam was not altered in mice chronically treated with this drug, whereas lorazepam-treated animals became tolerant to the acute anticonvulsant effect of this benzodiazepine. These data suggest that etizolam is endowed with a reduced liability to induce tolerance and dependence compared with classical benzodiazepines.", 
    "69": "(1) Lithium, the standard preventive treatment for patients with bipolar disorder, reduces the number of relapses and suicide attempts. (2) Olanzapine is the first neuroleptic to be approved in France for prevention of relapse in patients with bipolar disorder. Many neuroleptics are already used for this indication but their efficacy has not been established in comparative clinical trials. (3) One placebo-controlled double-blind trial involved 361 patients who were treated just after recovering from a manic episode. The trial was supposed to last 48 weeks, but only 146 patients were treated for more than 8 weeks. Therefore, the trial results, including an observed effect on mania, cannot be interpreted to imply long-term prevention. (4) One double-blind trial compared olanzapine plus a mood stabiliser with placebo plus a mood stabiliser in 344 patients who had recovered from an acute episode. Only 21 patients completed the 12-month trial, and the percentage of patients who had relapses (manic or depressive) did not differ significantly between the groups. (5) In a third double-blind trial, 431 patients in remission from a manic episode after treatment with olanzapine + lithium were treated for 12 months with lithium or olanzapine. This trial suggested that olanzapine was more effective in preventing depressive and manic relapses (30% of patients, compared to 38.8% with lithium), but only 171 patients completed the trial. Most dropouts were due to adverse events (19% with olanzapine, 26% with lithium). The impact of treatment on suicide risk was not studied. (6) In a fourth study, 101 patients in remission from a mixed or manic episode continued their initial treatment with olanzapine or sodium divalproate in double-blind manner for 11 months. The risk of relapse was not significantly different between the groups, but the study sample size was too small to tell whether or not the treatments were equally effective. (7) Trials focusing on prevention of relapse in patients with bipolar disorder confirmed the known adverse effects of olanzapine, including weight gain and QTc prolongation. Olanzapine was associated with more weight gain and sedation than lithium. Hyperglycaemia occurring on olanzapine can cause life-threatening ketoacidosis. (8) Lithium remains the standard treatment for preventing recurrent bipolar disorder. There is no firm evidence that olanzapine is more effective than a mood stabiliser after lithium failure, or that it boosts the efficacy of lithium.",

    "79": "The estimated number of employees in the United Stated screened annually for illicit drugs is approximately 20 million, with marijuana being the most frequently abused drug. Urine adulterants provide an opportunity for illicit drug users to obtain a false-negative result on commonly used primary drug screening methods such as the enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique and the fluorescence polarized immunoassay technique (FPIA). Typical chemical adulterants such as nitrites are easily detected or render the urine specimen invalid as defined in the proposed SAMHSA guidelines for specimen validity testing based on creatinine, specific gravity, and pH. Papain is a cysteine protease with intrinsic ester hydrolysis capability. The primary metabolite of the psychoactive chemical in marijuana, 11-norcarboxy-Delta9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC-COOH), was assayed by FPIA in concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 ng/mL, at pH values ranging from 4.5 to 8, over the course of 3 days with papain concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 mg/mL. FPIA analysis of other frequently abused drugs: amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, opiates, and phencyclidine, along with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) of THC-COOH and high-pressure liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV) of nordiazepam was performed in order to determine if the mechanism of urine adulteration by papain was analyte specific. Control and adulterated urine specimens (n = 30) were assayed for creatinine, specific gravity, and pH to determine if papain rendered the specimens invalid based on the proposed SAMHSA guidelines. There was a direct pH, temperature, and time-dependent correlate between the increase in papain concentration and the decrease in THC-COOH concentration from the untreated control groups (p < 0.01). The average 72-h THC-COOH concentration decrease at pH 6.2 with a papain concentration of 10 mg/mL was 50%. Papain did not significantly decrease the concentration of the other drugs analyzed with the exception of nordiazepam. GC-MS of THC-COOH and HPLC-UV of nordiazepam revealed a 66% and 24% decrease in concentration of the respective analyte with 10 mg/mL papain after 24 h at room temperature (approximately 23 degrees C). No adulterated specimens were rendered invalid based on the SAMHSA guidelines. Immediate FPIA analysis is suggested to minimize the interfering effects of papain with regards to primary drug screening.",

However, with respect to long-term therapy the atypical antipsychotics do have clinically significant side-effects of which clinicians need to be aware.",

Past medical history consisted of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, bipolar disorder, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and cluster headaches. A combined spinal-epidural technique was chosen. Isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (15 mg), was provided for the spinal anesthetic, along with 1 mg iv midazolam for procedural sedation and 0.5 mg iv droperidol for mild nausea. Throughout the operation, many apneic events were noted, often with respiratory efforts. The patient was easily arousable during each event and would breathe normally until the next episode. Vital signs remained stable throughout. Postoperative respirology consultation was requested, and a sleep study revealed severe obstructive sleep apnea. The patient was subsequently started on continuous positive airway pressure with marked improvement in symptoms, including the cluster headaches.", 
    "95": "Recent literature suggests that high spinal blockade can result in altered levels of arousal by producing a de-afferentation of peripheral proprioceptive and sensory stimuli necessary for maintaining an awake state. In patients predisposed to upper airway obstruction, decreasing the level of consciousness can result in airway obstruction as occurs during sleep in these patients. This serves to underline the importance of considering capnography for all cases utilizing a neuraxial anesthetic technique.",

The present study aimed at investigating the modulatory effects of this drug on brain dynamics. Specifically, the effects of bromazepam (3 mg) on the P300 component of the ERP were tested in a double-blind experiment. The sample, consisting of 15 healthy subjects (7 male and 8 female), was submitted to a visual discrimination task, which employed the \"oddball\" paradigm. Electrophysiological (P300) and behavioral measures (stroop, digit span, and reaction time) were analyzed across three experimental conditions: placebo 1, placebo 2, and bromazepam. Results suggest that the effects of bromazepam (3 mg) on cognitive processes are not apparent. In spite of what seems irrefutable in current literature, bromazepam did not produce evident effects on the behavioral and electrophysiological variables analyzed.",

On hospital admission, serum levels of lithium were found to be 3.0 mM/L which were far above toxic level. Immediate discontinuation of both drugs resulted in complete resolution of most of the symptoms except for perioral dyskinesia which persisted for three more months. We critically discussed the differential diagnosis of lithium intoxication and assessed confounding factors which induce delirium and extrapyramidal signs related with combination therapy of lithium and olanzapine.", 
    "102": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) expression increases in small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons after peripheral nerve injury. To determine the functional significance of this induction, we evaluated the effects of PBR ligands on rodent sensory axon outgrowth. In vitro, Ro5-4864, a PBR agonist, enhanced outgrowth only of small peripherin-positive DRG neurons. When DRG cells were preconditioned into an active growth state by a prior peripheral nerve injury Ro5-4864 augmented and PK 11195, a PBR antagonist, blocked the injury-induced increased outgrowth. In vivo, Ro5-4864 increased the initiation of regeneration after a sciatic nerve crush injury and the number of GAP-43-positive axons in the distal nerve while PK 11195 inhibited the enhanced growth produced by a preconditioning lesion. These results show that PBR has a role in the early regenerative response of small caliber sensory axons, the preconditioning effect, and that PBR agonists enhance sensory axon regeneration.", 
    "103": "Although treatment with different compounds such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, high-potency benzodiazepines, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors has been proven effective in anxiety disorders, 20% to 40% of patients are nonresponders. Given the limited efficacy, the delayed onset of response (it takes several weeks before a clinical effect can be seen for most of these drugs), and the occurrence of side effects associated with pharmacotherapy, predicting response in anxiety disorders would be immensely valuable. This review surveys the literature over the past years on predictors of response to pharmacotherapy in obsessive-compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Prediction of treatment response may be founded on demographic and clinical variables, neurochemical and electrophysiologic parameters, imaging studies, and genetic markers.",

Patient characteristics did not differ significantly during the two periods (predominance of women: 66 vs 69%; mean age: 33 +/- 12 vs 37 +/- 13.5 years). Psychotropic drugs predominated in both periods (78 and 77%), but the prevalence of benzodiazepines declined (67 to 55%; p < 0.01) and that of antidepressants increased (9.5 to 15%; p < 0.01). Bromazepam was the ben-zodiazepine used most often during both periods (P1: 30% and P2: 35%), but the use of aprazolam increased (from 6 to 17%; p < 0.01). Among the antidepressants, the use of tricyclics decreased (from 43 to 14%; p < 0.01) and that of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increased (31 to 71%; p < 0.01). The proportion of benzodiazepine-related drugs increased over time (8.1 to 14%: p < 0.01). The other therapeutic classes remained quite similar to each other between P1 and P2, except for anti-inflammatories (P1: 1.3%, P2: 2.7%; p = 0.01). Among the analgesics, paracetamol alone or combined with other agents predominated (68 and 64% respectively), but use of opiate analgesics was fre-quent during the later period (2.7 vs 22%; p < 0.01).",

    "110": "Most patients (83%) knew the reason for their prescription. Thirteen (28%) reported using over-the-counter medication. Only 89% of the patients reported complete compliance with the prescription. The average age of the patients was 72.1 +/- 6.3 years and the median was 71 years [65-91]; 43% were women and 57% men. The 257 lines of prescriptions analyzed averaged 5.7 +/- 2.6 drugs (range: 2-10) per prescription. The average number of possible interactions was 3.1 +/- 2.8 per prescription for a total of 89 listed potential interactions. The levels observed were 3 warnings (3%), 37 precautions (42%) and 49 possible adverse interactions (55%). No contraindication was noted. The drugs mentioned most often were benzodiazepines, diuretics, conversion enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II inhibitors, and beta-blockers. The potential risks most often found were hypotension, depression of the central nervous system, hypoglycemia and acute renal failure. The drug interactions were mainly due to the accumulation of the effects of separate drug classes. Deterioration in renal function was often noted as plasma concentration of the second drug increased.", 
    "111": "This exploratory study shows the reality of the iatrogenic risk for elderly patients. This analysis of outpatient prescriptions is consistent with findings in the literature. Analysis of interactions is conducted on a pairwise basis. It is thus difficult to envisage the consequences of the association of 5 or more drugs in patients with complex illnesses and diminished physiological and metabolic capacity. Patient files kept by the pharmacist could provide information about individual combinations ofthe prescription and over-the-counter drugs.", 
    "112": "Zolpidem is a hypnotic drug that is chemically distinct from benzodiazepines (BDZ). It has been suggested that it acts selectively on gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. However, recent evidence has shown that the behavioural effects of zolpidem are generally similar to those of BDZs. Flumazenil is usually considered to be a BDZ antagonist. Nonetheless, in chronic BDZ users, it acts as a partial, bland agonist. We describe two cases of zolpidem dependence that were detoxified by the use of flumazenil infusion. BDZ dependence is usually treated with tapering of the medication. As an alternative, abrupt discontinuation of the medication and rapid detoxification using flumazenil has been used. Flumazenil may represent an alternative to detoxification treatment by employing a tapering approach, or by replacement therapy with BDZs with a long half-life, particularly where patients are hard to treat or have low compliance to treatment.", 
    "113": "Some microplate-based direct assays with different fluorometric substrates have been developed, among which 7-benzyloxyquinoline (BOQ) has demonstrated the highest degree of selectivity for CYP3A subfamily. In our study, we firstly developed and validated an efficient, fast and cheap HPLC/spectrofluorometric analytical method to quantify 7-hydroxyquinoline (BOQ metabolite). Secondly, BOQ oxidation rate (1.95 +/- 0.24 microM/mg protein/min) was compared to that of midazolam (MDZ) (1.4 +/- 0.21 microM/mg protein/min), an other specific CYP3A probe. However, the difference did not reach statistically significance (test of Sign; p = 0.125, two tailed). Thirdly, the potential use of BOQ in other species than the rat (mouse, dog and monkey) was studied. The highest BOQ activity was observed in rat microsomes (3.75 micromol/mg protein/min) with lower P450 content (0.3 nmol/mg protein) compared to other species. Finally, the effect of CYP3A enzymes-selective inhibitor ketoconazole on the dealkylation of BOQ in control and dexamethasone (DM)-treated rat microsomes was studied. Ketoconazole inhibition potency was greater in control (IC(50) approximately 21.6 microM) compared to DM induced (IC(50) approximately 32.3 microM) microsomes. At concentrations greater than that considered to be enzyme-selective (e.g., 10-30 microM), ketoconazole inhibitory activity did not rise significantly, and at the maximal concentration tested (1,000 microM) a nearly similar inhibition (76%) was observed than that at 50 microM concentration (68.2%).",

Following a design methodology including pharmacophoric requirements and ADME-predicted properties, we have synthesized a library of 3-amino-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridin-6(7H)-ones and their N1-alkyl derivatives as new scaffolds for designing non-benzodiazepine BZ receptor ligands.", 
    "115": "There is growing evidence that anxiety disorders are associated with impairments of cellular plasticity and resilience. Paralleling these advances in our understanding of the neurobiologic underpinnings of anxiety disorders is the growing appreciation of the diverse functions that mitochondria play in regulating integrated CNS function. The emerging data suggest that mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration has a key role in modulating the tone of synaptic plasticity in a variety of neuroanatomical regions, including those implicated in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders. Furthermore, activation of peripheral mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors resulted in reduced anxiety in rats. One of the major modulators of mitochondrial function is Bcl-2 proteins imbedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Bcl-2 overexpression increases mitochondria Ca2+ uptake capacity and resistance to Ca2+-inhibition of respiration and upregulation of Bcl-2 increases maximal uptake capacity of mitochondria. We have, therefore, explored the significance of Bcl-2 in the association between mitochondrial function and affective disorders testing Bcl-2 heterozygote mice in models of affective and anxiety disorders. Mutant mice have reduced mitochondrial Bcl-2 levels, and although they have no gross behavioral abnormalities, they demonstrate a significant increase of anxiety-like behaviors. Bcl-2 heterozygote mice spent less time in the center of an open field, spent less time outside an enclosure in the \"emergence test\", were less likely to explore the transparent part of a black/white box or the open arms of an elevated plus maze compared with WT controls. Mutant mice did not differ from WT in measures of locomotion or in the forced swim test for depression-like behavior suggesting a specific effect on anxiety-like behaviors. Our study, therefore demonstrates that Bcl-2 may be a key factor in anxiety disorders and that its effects may possibly originate from its role in the mitochondria.", 
    "116": "Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) positive neurons are located in most brain areas related to defensive reactions, including the dorsolateral periaqueductal grey (dlPAG). NOS inhibitors injected into this structure induce anxiolytic-like responses whereas NO donors promote flight reactions. Intra-dlPAG administration of carboxy-PTIO, a NO scavenger, or ODQ, a soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor, produced anxiolytic-like effects on rats exposed to the elevated plus-maze (EPM). A double-staining experiment using NADPHd histochemistry and c-Fos immunohistochemistry in rats exposed to a cat or to the EPM showed increased activation of NO producing neurons in the dlPAG, paraventricular and lateral nuclei of hypothalamus and dorsal raphe nucleus. Cat exposure also increased activation of NOS neurons in the medial amygdala, dorsal pre-mammillary nucleus and bed nucleus of stria terminalis. Local infusion into the dlPAG of a glutamate NMDA-receptor antagonist (AP7) or a benzodiazepine agonist (midazolam) completely prevented the flight reactions induced by intra-dlPAG administration of SIN-1, a NO donor. The responses were also inhibited by the 5-HT2A/C agonist DOI but not by a 5-HT1A agonist. These results suggest a modulatory role for NO on brain areas related to defensive reactions, probably by interacting with glutamate, serotonin and/or GABA-mediated neurotransmission.",

We examined medication-prescribing patterns for the treatment of these anxiety disorders for 12 years to assess changes in patients' anti-anxiety psychotropic medication usage during that period of evolving practice guidelines. We examined psychotropic medication use in 305 patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 232 with social phobia enrolled in the Harvard/Brown Anxiety Disorders Research Project (HARP), a prospective, longitudinal study of anxiety disorders. Psychotropic treatment patterns seem to have remained relatively stable over 12 years with benzodiazepines the medications most commonly used for both generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia. Comparatively, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and venlafaxine usage as stand-alone medications for these disorders remained low throughout the follow-up period. At the 12-year follow-up, 24% of patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 30% of patients with social phobia were utilizing neither an SSRI/selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) nor a benzodiazepine. Treatment recommendations for use of SSRIs and venlafaxine in the management of generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia initially promulgated in 1998 had a modest impact on changes in psychopharmacologic practice 4-5 years later. Difficulties in the implementation of treatment guidelines are discussed.", 
    "126": "The effects of PK11195, a high-affinity peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligand, on protein phosphorylation in isolated purified rat brain mitochondria were investigated. The isoquinoline carboxamide ligand of PBR, PK11195, but not the benzodiazepine ligand Ro5-4864, in the nanomolar concentration range strongly increased the phosphorylation of 3.5 and 17 kDa polypeptides. The effect of PK11195 was seen in the presence of elevated Ca(2+) levels (3 x 10(-7) to 10(-6) m), but not at very low Ca(2+) levels (10(-8) to 3 x 10(-8) m). This indicates that PBR involves Ca(2+) as a second messenger in the regulation of protein phosphorylation. Staurosporine, an inhibitor of protein kinase activity was able to suppress the PK11195-promoted protein phosphorylation. When the permeability transition pore (PTP) was opened by threshold Ca(2+) load, phosphorylation of the 3.5-kDa polypeptide was diminished, but strong phosphorylation of the 43-kDa protein was revealed. The 43-kDa protein appears to be a PTP-specific phosphoprotein. If PTP was opened, PK11195 did not increase the phosphorylation of the 3.5 and 17-kDa proteins but suppressed the phosphorylation of the PTP-specific 43-kDa phosphoprotein. The ability of PK11195 to increase the protein phosphorylation, which was lost under Ca(2+)-induced PTP opening, was restored again in the presence of calmidazolium, an antagonist of calmodulin and inhibitor of protein phosphatase PP2B. These results show a tight interaction of PBR with the PTP complex in rat brain mitochondria. In conclusion, a novel function of PBR in brain mitochondria has been revealed, and the PBR-mediated protein phosphorylation has to be considered an important element of the PBR-associated signal transducing cascades in mitochondria and cells.", 
    "127": "A treatment protocol, called experiential cognitive therapy (ExCT), was developed. It integrated traditional cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) with virtual reality exposure for the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia (PDA). The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of short-term (four sessions) ExCT compared with a traditional 12-session panic control program (PCP) for the treatment of PDA. Forty patients diagnosed as having PDA by the diagnostic criteria of DSM-IV were randomly assigned to ExCT and PCP groups of 20 patients each. The treatment effects were measured with self-report questionnaires, including the BDI, STAI, ASI, PBQ, ACQ, and BSQ. The authors also assessed high end-state functioning (HES), including the success rate of stopping or reducing medication at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. In all ratings, both ExCT and PCP groups showed significant improvement post-treatment compared with pre-treatment scores. There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in HES and medication discontinuation at post-treatment, but there was a significant difference in medication discontinuation at 6-month follow-up. These results suggested that although short-term effectiveness of ExCT might be comparable to the effectiveness of PCP, long-term effectiveness of ExCT might be relatively inferior to the effectiveness of PCP.",

    "129": "1-(2-Chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195) is a prototypic ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein. PK11195 can be used to chemosensitize tumor cells to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, both in vitro and in vivo. PK11195 has been suggested to exert this effect via inhibition of the multiple drug resistance (MDR) pump and by direct mitochondrial effects which could be mediated by the PBR. Here, we established a model system in which PK11195 and another PBR ligand, 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864), sensitize to nutrient depletion-induced cell death. In this MDR-independent model, PK11195 and Ro5-4864 are fully active even when the PBR is knocked down by small interfering RNA. Cells that lack PBR possess low-affinity binding sites for PK11195 and Ro5-4864. The starvation-sensitizing effects of PK11195 are not due to a modulation of the adaptive response of starved cells, namely autophagy and NF-kappaB activation. Rather, it appears that the combination of PK11195 with autophagy or NF-kappaB inhibitors has a potent synergistic death-inducing effect. Starved cells treated with PK11195 exhibit characteristics of apoptosis, including loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation and chromatin condensation. Accordingly, stabilization of mitochondria by overexpression of Bcl-2 or expression of the viral mitochondrial inhibitor (vMIA) from cytomegalovirus inhibits cell death induced by PK11195 plus starvation. Thus, PK11195 potently sensitizes to apoptosis via a pathway that involves mitochondria, yet does not involve the PBR.",

The pulmonary problem resolved, but her hospitalization and subsequent rehabilitation were complicated by agitated delirium, which was treated with olanzapine and modification of contributory factors. At the time of admission to the rehabilitation facility, the patient had been receiving warfarin for 2 weeks and olanzapine for 6 days. On the eighth day after initiation of olanzapine, erythematous skin lesions developed on dependent areas. The international normalized ratio for warfarin was within the acceptable range; however, because warfarin has been associated with subcutaneous bleeding presenting as petechiae and ecchymosis, subcutaneous enoxaparin was substituted for warfarin. The skin lesions continued to worsen over the next week and developed into palpable lesions. Biopsy of the rash revealed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In the absence of another cause, olanzapine was discontinued and the rash improved significantly. When the agitation recurred, risperidone was initiated, but the patient experienced dizziness with this agent. Olanzapine was resumed and the skin lesions recurred. Olanzapine was then changed to quetiapine, and the skin lesions improved over the next few weeks.",

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is an infrequently reported adverse drug reaction with olanzapine. Its exact pathogenic mechanism is unknown, but both cell-mediated and humoral immunity appear to play important roles. Because drug-induced vasculitis has an identical clinical presentation and identical serologic/pathologic parameters to idiopathic forms of vasculitis, a high index of suspicion is necessary for its accurate diagnosis.", 
    "134": "Because adverse drug reactions are common in elderly patients taking multiple medications, physicians should be vigilant when starting new medications and should attempt to eliminate unnecessary medications.

    "135": "Current choices for sustained sedation in the critically ill include the benzodiazepines, the opiates, and propofol. Each of these groups of medications has their particular benefits: benzodiazepines provide the greatest amnesia, opiates are the only agents to provide analgesia, and propofol is the most easily titratable and the least likely to excessively accrue. The literature seems to favor propofol over the benzodiazepines as the most cost-effective solution to sustained sedation. A newly approved agent, dexmedetomidine, holds promise as a continuous infusion that can provide both anxiolysis and analgesia, but without the ventilatory depression seen in the other classes of sedatives. Further research is needed to determine the role of dexmedetomidine in the ICU. The emerging standard of care for sustained sedation is the use of standardized protocols, formulated with the help of clinical practice guidelines, and titrated with the guidance of sedation monitoring.", 
    "136": "Chronic administration of triazolam (0.25 mg/kg/day, i.p.) on days 1-8 and its withdrawal produced an anxiogenic reaction in mice as assessed in the mirrored-chamber test. Daily administration of bupropion (2 or 5 mg/kg, i.p.) prior to triazolam for 8 days prevented withdrawal-induced anxiety in mice. Triazolam withdrawal also induced a significant increase in the locomotor activity of mice indicating an anxiogenic response. Daily administration of bupropion (2 or 5 mg/kg) prior to triazolam for 8 days also prevented withdrawal-induced increased locomotor activity. In conclusion, chronic administration of bupropion (2 and 5 mg/kg) exhibited a significant protection against triazolam withdrawal-induced anxiety and hyperlocomotor activity in mice. The result suggests the protective effect of bupropion in the management of triazolam withdrawal reactions.",

The complainant did not recall the events due to benzodiazepine-induced anterograde amnesia. The use of flunitrazepam was uncovered when its major metabolite, 7-amino flunitrazepam, was detected in a urine specimen collected when the complainant attended hospital approximately one day after consuming the adulterated drink.", 
    "144": "Benzodiazepines are sedatives used for anxiolysis, hypnosis, muscle relaxation and the treatment of epilepsy. Paradoxical reactions including agitation, talkativeness, confusion, disinhibition, aggression, violent behavior and loss of impulse control may, however, occur in some subjects. It has been claimed that high doses of flunitrazepam may cause aggression on a more regular basis in all individuals. The present study makes use of a Norwegian forensic toxicological database containing analytical results from drivers suspected of driving under the influence and suspects of violent crime to analyze the relationship between behavior and blood flunitrazepam concentration. Four-hundred and fifteen cases of drivers suspected of driving under the influence and seven cases of suspects of violent crime were studied. These selected cases had flunitrazepam as the only drug in blood samples and had been evaluated by a clinical test for impairment (CTI) performed by a police physician at the time of blood sampling. The impaired drivers had higher blood flunitrazepam concentrations than the not impaired drivers. Multivariate analysis revealed that both blood flunitrazepam concentration and age of the suspected drivers had independent impact on impairment, indicating tolerance with age. Most of the effects measured were sedative effects of flunitrazepam and these effects were related to flunitrazepam level. Possible paradoxical reactions were observed in a subgroup of 23 individuals (6%), but these reactions did not relate to blood flunitrazepam concentration. The suspects of violent crime showed similar degree impairment and had not more paradoxical reactions than the suspected drugged drivers. The findings were in agreement with other research that claims paradoxical reactions should be viewed as a reaction in certain individuals, and does not support the notion that flunitrazepam in high concentration produces aggression in all individuals taking the drug.", 
    "145": "The primary aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of 12 months' treatment with olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, or haloperidol in preventing relapse of schizophrenia. The study also examined other measures of clinical effectiveness and tolerability.", 
    "146": "Outpatients with schizophrenia (ICD-10 or DSM-IV), who initiated or changed antipsychotic treatment, entered this 3-year, naturalistic, prospective, observational study between November 2000 and December 2001. At baseline, subsets of patients were prescribed monotherapy with olanzapine (N = 3222), risperidone (N = 1116), quetiapine (N = 189), or haloperidol (N = 256). Patients remaining on monotherapy were assessed using the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia scale. Relapse rate was determined from the responder subset. Treatment patterns, patient perception of treatment compliance, substance and alcohol intake patterns, and treatment tolerability were recorded. Results are based on 12-month treatment data.", 
    "147": "Compared to haloperidol-treated patients, olanzapine- and risperidone-treated patients had approximately 3 to 4 times higher odds of response at 12 months (p <or= .001) and 6 times lower odds of relapse (p <or= .001 for olanzapine-treated patients). Among patients treated with atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine- and risperidone-treated patients had lower odds of relapse (although the difference was not significant at p <or= .001) and significantly higher odds of response (p <or= .001) compared to quetiapine-treated patients. The tolerability profile generally favored the atypical antipsychotics over haloperidol.", 
    "148": "These interim results support the findings of randomized controlled trials and verify that in this naturalistic study, patients treated with olanzapine or risperidone monotherapy were less likely to experience relapse than patients who received haloperidol. The clinical effectiveness and tolerability profile varied significantly between the atypical antipsychotics.", 
    "149": "Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCSs) frequently occur in schizophrenia and seem to worsen prognosis. Many case studies suggest that OCSs appear or worsen with an atypical antipsychotic agent treatment (that is, with risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine). Therefore, family or personal history of OCS should be investigated before initiating such treatment, and OCS onset should be monitored during treatment. Clozapine is involved in most such cases. When OCSs appear with clozapine, dosage can be reduced and a serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment added. Current studies suggest that patients with schizophrenia and OCSs should benefit from treatment with an antipsychotic and an antiobsessive medication. Two controlled trials deal with OCS treatment in schizophrenia: the first, with clomipramine; and the second, with fluvoxamine. Both have proven their efficacy, but these trials include a small number of patients with heterogeneous characteristics.", 
    "150": "This article explores the history of psychiatry and the rise of biological psychiatry and suggests ways in which the study of history can shed light on current psychiatric practice and debate. Focusing on anxiolytics (meprobomate in the 1950s and benzodiazepines in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s) as a case study in the development of psychopharmacology, it shows how social and political factors converged to popularize and later stigmatize outpatient treatments for anxiety. The importance of social context in the creation of new therapeutic paradigms in modern psychiatry suggests the need to take into account a broad range of historical variables to understand how modern psychopharmacology has emerged and how particular treatments for disorders have been developed, diffused, and assessed.", 
    "151": "Charles Bonnet syndrome (CBS) is characterised by the triad of complex visual hallucinations, ocular pathology causing visual deterioration and preserved cognitive status. We report a case of a 62-year-old man with a brief history of visual hallucinations. The patient complained of amaurosis with optic nerve atrophy in his left eye and a severe impairment of visual acuity in the right and suddenly experienced complex, vivid, elaborate and coloured visual hallucinations persisting long after eye closure and stopping during sleep. The patient maintained his insight, criticising these visions as unreal and felt distressed by them. Hallucination onset was 3 days before hospital admission. No cognitive impairment and no diseases apart from prostatic adenoma treated with alpha-lythic therapy were reported. Neurological examination and neuroimaging data were normal. Therapy with olanzapine (OLZ) 5 mg/day led to a progressive clearance of visual hallucinations in seven days and was gradually reduced and withdrawn. Three months later the visions reappeared and OLZ 5 mg/day yielded a persisting remission so that at the follow-up examination after 1 year on therapy the patient is still asymptomatic. To date, no established treatment for CBS is stated and in some patients the hallucinations fade spontaneously; in our case an antipsychotic therapy with OLZ was effective while generally anticonvulsant drugs with different mechanism of action such as carbamazepine, valproate and gabapentin are proposed.",

    "153": "Patients with moderate-to-severe psychotic symptoms associated with dementia were recruited from outpatient or residential settings and randomly assigned to 10-week, double-blind, flexible-dose treatment with olanzapine (N=204; 2.5 mg-10 mg/day; mean: 5.2 mg/day), risperidone (N=196; 0.5 mg-2 mg/day; mean: 1.0 mg/day) or placebo (N=94).", 
    "154": "Most measures of neuropsychiatric functioning improved in all treatment groups, including the placebo group, and no significant treatment differences occurred. Overall discontinuation was lowest in the placebo group, and the olanzapine group had a significantly higher incidence of discontinuation due to adverse events (16.2%) relative to placebo (3.2%) and risperidone (8.7%) groups. Treatment-emergent extrapyramidal symptoms were more numerous for risperidone- than placebo- or olanzapine-treated patients. Abnormally high prolactin levels occurred in 78.0% of risperidone patients, compared with 16.7% for olanzapine and 5.0% for placebo. The incidence of weight gain greater than 7% from baseline was higher in the olanzapine group relative to risperidone, but neither active-treatment group showed a statistical difference from placebo (1.1%). No other statistically significant and clinically relevant differences were seen for any other vital sign, electrocardiographic measure, or laboratory hematology and chemistry, including glucose, except for cholesterol, which decreased from baseline to endpoint in both active-treatment groups.",

    "156": "Serious efforts have been made to develop anxiolytics with improved clinical utility and reduced side effects. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2C) receptor antagonists are potential anxiolytics; however, their effects on vigilance are not well characterized. To compare the effects of benzodiazepines and subtype-selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonists on anxiety, vigilance, and electroencephalogram (EEG) power density, social interaction test and polygraphic recordings were performed in male Sprague-Dawley rats after chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 4.0 mg/kg i.p.) and SB-242084 (6-chloro-5-methyl-1-[2-(2-methylpyrid-3-yloxy)-pyrid-5-yl carbamoyl] indoline) (0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg/kg i.p.) treatment. CDP and SB-242084 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg) had similar anxiolytic effects. Spectral analysis of EEG in wakefulness (W) and paradoxical sleep (PS) showed an opposite effect on activity (5-9 Hz); it decreased after CDP, whereas it increased after SB-242084 (even at 0.1 mg/kg). In addition, CDP significantly decreased slow-wave activity (0.5-4 Hz) in deep slow-wave sleep (SWS-2) and increased power at frequencies above 12 Hz mainly in W and PS. A markedly increased intermediate stage of sleep was also found after CDP treatment. At the highest dose, SB-242084 increased W and decreased SWS-2. In summary, low but potent anxiolytic doses of the subtype-selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist SB-242084 did not affect vigilance states but caused an increased activity in W, raising the possibility of a cognitive-enhancing effect of the drug. In contrast, acute CDP administration, based on spectral analysis of the EEG, produced a more superficial sleep along with a decreased activity.", 
    "157": "Catalase is one of the enzymes that convert hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to H2O presenting a protective role against free radicals. In this study, catalase activity was determined in homogenates of striatum (ST) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) in order to examine the participation of oxidative stress (OS) on cocaine actions in mice brain. Male Swiss mice were injected (i.p.) with cocaine at low (10 and 30 mg/kg) and high doses (90 mg/kg), and observed for 1 h. After cocaine overdose (90 mg/kg) some animals presented only status epilepticus (SE) while others died after seizures. These animals were dissected and divided in two groups, SE and death. Catalase activity was also determined after pretreatment with the anticonvulsant drug, diazepam, alone or injected before cocaine 90 mg/kg, and after seizures induced by a high dose of bupropion, a known inhibitor of NE and DA reuptake used for comparison. Results showed a decrease in catalase activity of the PFC and ST after SE and death induced by cocaine and bupropion overdoses. Cocaine at low doses decreased the enzyme activity only in ST. Diazepam treatment alone and before cocaine overdose did not interfere with catalase activity. This reduction in catalase activity may reflect an increase in H2O2 content in PFC and ST. Previous data reports that H2O2 inhibits dopamine transporter activity, suggesting that the decrease in catalase activity may potentiate the toxic mechanism of drugs that inhibit monoamines reuptake. As far as we know, this is the first report showing an involvement of OS in the cocaine's central mechanism of action.", 
    "158": "A fast and sensitive method of coupled high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry for the assay of lorazepam in human plasma was developed. Plasma samples were simply treated with acetonitrile to precipitate and remove proteins and the isolated supernatants were directly injected into the HPLC/MS/MS system. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Zorbax C(18) (100 x 2.1 mm I.D.) column with a 65:35 (v/v) mixed solution of acetonitrile and 10mM aqueous formic acid being used as mobile phase. With diazepam as an internal standard, quantification was performed by selected reaction ion monitoring of the transitions of m/z 321--> m/z 275 for lorazepam and m/z 285--> m/z 193 for the internal standard. The assay was validated in the concentration range of 0.71-71.3 ng/ml in human plasma. A detection limit of 0.10 ng/ml for lorazepam was achieved, and inter- and intra-run precisions of better than 4.4% (R.S.D.) were observed. The developed method has been successfully applied for pharmacokinetic study of the drug in man.", 
    "159": "The present study investigated the short-term efficacy of brief, intensive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for panic disorder (PD). The treatment involved 9h of therapist contact over two consecutive days and was developed for the purpose of delivering CBT for PD to a largely rural patient population that must travel long distances to find a treatment provider. Ten patients who elected to participate in brief, intensive CBT instead of weekly CBT were recruited from routine clinical practice in a hospital-based anxiety disorders clinic. Patients were not excluded based on the presence of agoraphobia, diagnostic comorbidity, concurrent use of PRN benzodiazepine medications, or previous nonresponse to psychotherapy for PD. Assessments conducted at pre-treatment and 1-month follow-up revealed large, clinically significant reductions in PD symptoms, anxiety sensitivity, body vigilance, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Most patients (60%) were panic-free after treatment and evidenced normative levels of symptomatology at follow-up. The present study suggests that brief, intensive treatment may be an effective means of delivering CBT for PD.",

Schizophrenia outpatients who initiated or changed to a new antipsychotic are followed in this non-interventional, prospective observational study for up to 3 years, with 6-months data now available on the entire cohort (N=7655). The presence or absence of verbal or physical hostility/aggression was assessed retrospectively for the period of 6 months before enrollment, and prospectively in the period of 6 months after enrollment (the study treatment period). At baseline, patients in five monotherapy treatment groups (combined N=3135) were prescribed one of the treatments: clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or haloperidol, and had complete data.", 
    "162": "Hostile/aggressive behavior was reduced during the treatment period. Olanzapine and risperidone were significantly superior to haloperidol and to clozapine in this respect. These results remained essentially unchanged when adjusting for baseline imbalances in age, gender, age of onset, and substance abuse.", 
    "163": "As monotherapy, both olanzapine and risperidone were superior to haloperidol and clozapine in reducing aggression. The relative lack of effectiveness of clozapine may be specific to this study population.", 
    "164": "GABA(A) receptors mediate most of the fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain. Prolonged occupancy of these receptors by ligands leads to regulatory changes often resulting in reduction of receptor function. The mechanism of these changes is still unknown. In this study, stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were used as a model to study the effects of prolonged flumazenil (antagonist of benzodiazepine binding sites at GABA(A) receptors) exposure on the recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors, the most common type of GABA(A) receptors found in the brain. Exposure (48 h) of HEK 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors to flumazenil (1 or 5 microM) in the presence of GABA (1 microM), enhanced the maximum number (B(max)) without affecting the affinity (K(d)) of [(3)H]TBOB labeled binding sites for convulsants. Diazepam (1 nM-1 mM) in the presence of GABA (1 microM) modulated [(3)H]TBOB binding to control and flumazenil pretreated cells according to a two-site model. No significant differences between the groups were observed in either the potency or efficacy of diazepam to modulate [(3)H]TBOB binding, as evidenced by a lack of significant changes between their IC(50) and I(max) values. The results suggest that chronic exposure of HEK 293 cells stably expressing recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors to flumazenil up-regulates the binding sites for convulsants, but it does not appear to affect the functional coupling between these sites and benzodiazepine binding sites. Along with our recent data, these results suggest that chronic treatment with flumazenil enhances the number of GABA(A) receptors."
