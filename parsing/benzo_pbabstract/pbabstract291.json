    "1": "A total of 1,600 patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia underwent 2,138 percutaneous radiofrequency rhizotomy procedures between 1974 and 1999. Sixty-seven patients had bilateral idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia, and 36 of them were treated with bilateral RF-TR; 1,216 patients (76%) were successfully managed with a single procedure, and the remainder were treated with multiple procedures. Benzodiazepines and narcotic analgesics were used for anesthesia because patient cooperation during the procedures was essential so that the physician could create selective, controlled lesions.", 
    "2": "The average follow-up time was 68.1 +/- 66.4 months (range, 12-300 mo). Acute pain relief was accomplished in 97.6% of patients. Complete pain relief was achieved at 5 years in 57.7% of the patients who underwent a single procedure. Pain relief was reported in 92% of patients with a single procedure or with multiple procedures 5 years after the first rhizotomy was performed. At 10-year follow-up, 52.3% of the patients who underwent a single procedure and 94.2% of the patients who underwent multiple procedures had experienced pain relief; at 20-year follow-up, 41 and 100% of these patients, respectively, had experienced pain relief. No mortalities occurred. After the first procedure was performed, early pain recurrence (<6 mo) was observed in 123 patients (7.7%) and late pain recurrence was observed in 278 patients (17.4%). Complications included diminished corneal reflex in 91 patients (5.7%), masseter weakness and paralysis in 66 (4.1%), dysesthesia in 16 (1 %), anesthesia dolorosa in 12 (0.8%), keratitis in 10 (0.6%), and transient paralysis of Cranial Nerves III and VI in 12 (0.8%).

    "6": "Novel antipsychotic agents, risperidone and olanzapine, as well as the specific angiotensin-II receptor blocking drug, irbesartan were employed at selected intervals in a study lasting nearly 3 years. A strict behavioural management programme was ongoing, in which diurnal weight change and the number of breaches of weight limits, requiring management in a low-stimulus environment, were documented on a daily basis. Summary measures of diurnal weight change and behavioural intervention were charted against changes in treatment.",

    "8": "We suggest that the D2-sparing profiles of receptor binding achieved with low-dose risperidone and olanzapine may account for this beneficial effect. The benefit derived with irbesartan implicates the involvement of brain angiotensin systems centrally in helping to regulate drinking behaviour.", 
    "9": "Epilepsy is rather common, affecting 0.5 to 2% of the population. Numerous patients, particularly those resistant to the antiepileptic therapy, can be surgically treated after a thorough evaluation. Surgery for epilepsy can be carried out either under general or local anaesthesia with sedation. This second approach is reserved for the extirpation of foci localised in motor, sensory or language areas. During the preoperative anaesthetic evaluation, two specific points have to be taken into account: the psychological aspect and the antiepileptic medication. During the procedure, an electrocorticography with or without stimulation may be indicated, particularly when a perioperative stimulation is scheduled. Low doses of volatile agents are chosen, and no curare and large doses of benzodiazepines and barbiturates. Awakening takes place on the operation table for a rapid and reliable neurological evaluation. During procedures performed under local anaesthesia, the anaesthetist must be ready at any time to intubate the patient in order to secure the airway.", 
    "10": "The presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant partial epilepsies primarily relies on two major investigations, including a long term video-EEG monitoring which aimed at recording the patient's typical seizures, and a specifically designed high quality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The latter demonstrates an abnormality within the epileptogenic lobe in the majority of cases, which might not, however, necessarily match the epileptogenic zone. Numerous functional neuro-imaging techniques have been progressively added to the pre-surgical evaluation of refractory partial epilepsies, such as the study of cerebral glucose metabolism, benzodiazepine receptor availability, and methionine incorporation using positron emission tomography (PET), the evaluation of ictal cerebral blood flow changes using single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), the measurement of N-acetyl-aspartate concentration with magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the mapping of eloquent areas using functional MRI. These investigations can help to confirm the origin of seizure onset previously suggested by MRI and electro-clinical data, and provide independent prognostic information regarding the chance of a successful surgical treatment. Moreover, functional neuro-imaging data can have a critical diagnostic value when MRI is strictly normal or shows multifocal abnormalities. However, the variety and rapid evolution of functional neuro-imaging techniques makes it difficult to propose a standard protocol. Finally, it remains mandatory to proceed to an intracranial EEG investigation in a substantial number of patients, including the majority of those suffering from an extra-temporal epilepsy.",

They were randomly allocated to receive in a double-blind fashion an intravenous bolus of either (a) remifentanil given as a bolus dose 1 microgram kg-1 (n = 15), or else (b) sufentanil 0.1 microgram kg-1 infused over 60 s (n = 15). In each instance this loading dose was followed by a continuous intravenous infusion (0.1 microgram kg-1 min-1 or 0.01 microgram kg-1 min-1 of remifentanil or sufentanil, respectively). General anaesthesia was induced with propofol (2 mg kg-1), followed by atracurium besilate (0.5 mg kg-1) to facilitate tracheal intubation. Following intubation, the lungs were mechanically ventilated with a 60% nitrous oxide in oxygen mixture and a 1% inspired sevoflurane.", 
    "13": "Arterial pressure and heart rate were recorded before induction of anaesthesia (baseline), immediately before intubation, immediately after tracheal intubation and every minute for the first five minutes thereafter. No differences in systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were observed between the two groups. At the end of the study period, systolic and diastolic pressures slightly decreased from preinduction values in both groups. Four patients in the remifentanil group (26%) and five patients in sufentanil group (33%) showed at least one systolic pressure value < 90 mmHg during the study period (P = not significant); however, the observed decreases in systolic pressure were transient and did not require treatment. Heart rate values were not affected by tracheal intubation in either group.",

    "16": "Thirty-one patients undergoing radical cystectomy were studied. The initial regimen was calculated from drug pharmacokinetic variables and tailored in a pilot study (15 patients) to develop the approximation regimen dosage. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam (150 micrograms kg-1) and ketamine (2 mg kg-1). Tracheal intubation and ventilation with oxygen enriched air (FiO2 = 0.35) were facilitated by muscle relaxants. Anaesthesia was maintained by the approximation regimen doses. Routine monitoring was used for all patients, but pulmonary artery catheters were inserted in 11 patients, to obtain haemodynamic and oxygenation variables.",

    "19": "RG 12525 (2-[[4-[[2-(1H-tetrazole-5-ylmethyl)phenyl]methoxy]phenoxy]methyl] quinolone) is a novel peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist. In vitro microsomal inhibition assays indicated that RG 12525 is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, with a Ki value of 0.5 microM. With the conservative assumption that the total plasma concentration of drug was available to metabolic enzymes following RG 12525 oral administration, marked inhibition of CYP3A4 was expected to substantially reduce the systemic clearance of compounds metabolized by this enzyme. The possibility also existed for inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A4 by RG 12525 to reduce \"first-pass\" metabolism and increase absolute bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates orally coadministered. Consequently, an in vivo drug-drug interaction study was performed to evaluate the effects of orally administered RG 12525 on in vivo CYP3A4 activity in healthy male subjects. The pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam, a probe for intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, was not influenced by either the low (100 mg qd for 4 days) or high (600 mg qd for4 days) RG 12525 dosing regimen despite the resulting total plasma concentrations of inhibitor that were well above in vitro Ki values. The point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of mean midazolam AUC for subjects administered 100 mg RG 12525 (110.6; 98.7-124.1) and 600 mg RG 12525 (98.4; 84.4-114.7) versus midazolam alone were within 80% to 125%. To explain these results, factors that could limit the accuracy of in vitro models in predicting metabolic drug interactions, mainly the high degree of RG 12525 protein binding (> 99.9%), were considered. The lack of correlation between the in vitro inhibition of CYP3A4 by RG 12525 and the inconsequential effects of this compound on midazolam pharmacokinetics accentuate the need to recognize factors other than plasma drug concentrations and potency of in vitro enzyme inhibition when extrapolating in vitro data to predict in vivo drug-drug interactions.", 
    "20": "In this article, the authors reevaluate the traditional position that benzodiazepines should be avoided in anxiety disorder patients with a history of substance abuse or dependence. The efficacy of benzodiazepines in each of the anxiety disorders is reviewed, as are their side effects and toxicity. The definitions of benzodiazepine abuse and dependence are discussed, and relevant animal, experimental, and clinical data are reviewed and analyzed. A manual and computerized (MEDLINE) search was performed from 1966 to the present to examine the English-language literature published on benzodiazepines, substance abuse, and each of the anxiety disorders listed in DSM-IV. The authors found that benzodiazepines have demonstrated efficacy in generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agoraphobia; they are promising agents in the treatment of social phobia and alcohol-induced anxiety disorders. They are generally well tolerated. There is much ambiguity over appropriate definitions for benzodiazepine abuse and dependence: although most benzodiazepine abusers concurrently abuse other substances, there is little evidence to indicate that a history of substance abuse is a major risk factor for future benzodiazepine abuse or dependence. Furthermore, benzodiazepines do not appear to induce relapse of substance abuse in these patients. The authors conclude that the position that benzodiazepines are contraindicated in former substance abusers appears to lack empirical justification. Benzodiazepines may be indicated in certain patients with anxiety disorders and a history of substance abuse or dependence.", 
    "21": "Some anticonvulsants have been shown to be as effective as some benzodiazepines for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. Anticonvulsants may offer advantages over benzodiazepines in the outpatient treatment of alcohol withdrawal: they lack abuse potential, have minimal interactions with alcohol, and may be more effective in ameliorating psychiatric symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. Carbamazepine appears to be as effective as lorazepam and oxazepam in ameliorating the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. In addition, a recent study indicates that carbamazepine may suppress post-withdrawal alcohol use. Divalproex may also reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal, based on several open-label studies. However, both carbamazepine and divalproex have limited usefulness in alcoholics with severe hepatic or hematologic complications. Newer anticonvulsants, such as gabapentin and vigabatrin, also appear to reduce alcohol withdrawal symptoms in preclinical and open-label clinical trials while lacking the toxicities of carbamazepine and divalproex. Controlled trials are underway exploring the efficacy and safety of newer anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "22": "Sho-ju-sen (SK), a Japanese herbal medicine with a nourishing tonic action, is composed of a water extract of Kumazasa leaves (Sasa kurinensis Makino et Sibata) (SS), and ethanol extracts of Japanese red pine needles (Pinus densiflora Sieb. et Zucc) (PN) and Ginseng roots (Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer) (PX) in the ratio 8:1:1. In this study, an elevated plus-maze test in mice was carried out to assess whether SK had an anxiolytic effect. No significant change was observed in either the plus-maze or activity test following a single administration of SK (10 and 20 mL/kg p.o.). However, mice allowed a free intake of SK (10% solution) for 5 days and longer showed a significant prolongation of the time spent in the open arms (an anxiolytic effect), as long as that caused by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (1 mg/kg p.o.). SK (1%, 3% and 30% solutions for 7 days) tended to develop the anxiolytic effect. Of the constituents of SK, SS (8% solution), but not PN (1% solution) or PX (1% solution), resulted in the anxiolytic effect. Except for a slight acceleration in the motor activity by PN (1% solution), no significant change in the motor activity was produced by any treatment with SK, SS or PX. The combined treatment of SK (10% solution) or SS (8% solution) with 1 mg/kg diazepam enhanced the anxiolytic effect. Flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, alone did not change the time spent in the open arms. However, it completely reversed the anxiolytic effect of SK, SS and diazepam. The present results suggest that: (1) long-term treatment with SK develops an anxiolytic effect, (2) SS is the main constituent for the anxiolytic effect of SK, and (3) benzodiazepine receptors are involved in the anxiolytic effect of SK and SS.", 
    "23": "Cyclic AMP is hydrolyzed by members of at least eight classes of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Although it has been reported that cyclic AMP PDE activity in mammalian tissues can be inhibited by benzodiazepines, it has not been conclusively demonstrated that members of the class of cyclic AMP-specific, rolipram-inhibitable PDEs (PDE4s) are targets for these drugs. Moreover, no PDE4s expressed in mice have been characterized. To address these issues, we isolated two cDNAs representing homologues of PDE4A1 and PDE4B3 from a mouse brain library. After transient transfection in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the mouse PDEs hydrolyzed cyclic AMP with a low K(m) and were inhibited by rolipram; both are properties typical of other mammalian PDE4 enzymes. In addition, we found that diazepam inhibited cyclic AMP hydrolysis by the mouse PDE4 subtypes. Interestingly, PDE4B was significantly more sensitive to inhibition by both rolipram and diazepam than the PDE4A subtype. This is the first demonstration that recombinantly expressed PDE4s are inhibited by diazepam, and should facilitate future studies with mouse models of depression and anxiety.", 
    "24": "The number of cycles of alcohol detoxification is suggested to be an important variable in the predisposition to severe withdrawal seizures in alcohol-dependent individuals. Several clinical studies have suggested that exposure to repeated alcohol withdrawals may lead to increased severity of subsequent withdrawal episodes. Consistent with these observations, exposure to multiple cycles of ethanol withdrawal in our previous study significantly increased sensitivity to the convulsive effects of the GABA(A) receptor inverse agonist, Ro15-4513, in comparison to continuous ethanol exposure with no intermittent withdrawals. There was also a selective increase in the occurrence of spontaneous spike and sharp wave (SSW) activity in the EEG recorded from hippocampal area CA(3) in proportion to the number of withdrawal episodes experienced. It is hypothesized that during such repeated episodes of ethanol intoxication and withdrawal, changes in neuronal excitation during prior withdrawals could serve as initially subconvulsive kindling stimuli that might eventually result in the increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. There is some evidence of the successful suppression of such neuronal excitation during acute ethanol withdrawal by positive modulators of the GABA(A) receptor. In the present study, the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, at a dose (4.0 mg/kg) that suppresses acute withdrawal symptoms, when administered during intermittent withdrawals, did not alter seizure sensitivity during a subsequent nonmedicated withdrawal. Diazepam treatment during prior withdrawals also did not have any effect on the multiple withdrawal-associated increase in SSW activity in hippocampal area CA(3) during an untreated withdrawal. This finding suggests that suppression of acute withdrawal symptoms by diazepam does not prevent long-lasting changes in CNS function resulting from repeated exposures to ethanol withdrawal.", 
    "25": "This study was aimed at determining the effects of systemic administration of diazepam and methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) both on spatial working memory and on emotional reactivity in mice. Results showed that diazepam and beta-CCM induced opposite effects in both memory and emotional reactivity tests. Indeed, as a function of dose, diazepam reduced anxiogenic-like reactions but increased vulnerability to interference in the memory task at a 30-s but not at a 5-s delay interval. As a function of dose, beta-CCM reduced vulnerability to interference and increased emotional reactivity, these effects being antagonised by concurrent administration of flumazenil (RO 15-1788). Thus, our study showed the bidirectional effects of these two drugs on a spatial working memory task involving a spontaneous processing of information and suggested a direct link between the emotional effects of the drugs and memory performance.", 
    "26": "Strong evidence is emerging that mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) may be important in certain physiological conditions and, above all, in the processes of cell damage and death. Reversible MPT, triggered by inducing agents in the presence of calcium ions, has resulted in the opening of a dynamic multiprotein complex formed in the inner mitochondrial membrane and has caused large-amplitude mitochondrial swelling. In the present work, the exposure of de-energized rat cardiac mitochondria to peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) ligands (1-(2-chlorophenyl-N-methyl-1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK 11195), 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864), and diazepam) produced a dose-dependent and cyclosporin A (CSP)-sensitive loss of absorbance, which was indicative of mitochondrial swelling. By contrast, the addition of a high-affinity central benzodiazepine receptor ligand (clonazepam) was ineffective, even at the highest concentration tested. The ultrastructural changes associated with swelling were similar in mitochondria exposed either to PK 11195 or to calcium. Supporting the apoptotic role of PK 11195-induced swelling, supernatants from mitochondria that had undergone permeability transition caused apoptotic changes in isolated cardiac nuclei. In addition, ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in rat cardiac tissue following in vivo PK 11195 administration, with these abnormalities being prevented by CSP co-administration. These data indicate that PBR ligands induce mitochondrial permeability transition and ultrastructural alterations in isolated cardiac mitochondria as well as in myocardiocytes, suggesting a novel strategy for studying the implication of PBR ligands as apoptosis inducers, through a probable effect on the MPT pore.",

    "29": "Transformation of HSC led to a transient expression of PBR at the messenger RNA and protein level, which was maximal after about 3 and 7 days of culture, respectively, and declined thereafter. Immunoreactive PBR showed a punctate staining and colocalized with mitochondrial manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase and adenine nucleotide translocator 1. The selective PBR ligands 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195) and 4' chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864), but not the centrally acting benzodiazepine ligand clonazepam, induced dose-dependent apoptosis in HSC. The apoptotic potency of PK11195 paralleled the level of PBR expression. PK11195 induced dephosphorylation of protein kinase B/Akt and Bad and a downregulation of Bcl-2. Collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential preceeded PBR-ligand-induced apoptosis. No apoptosis was induced by PK11195 in parenchymal cells, despite the presence of PBR, and PK11195 had no effect in these cells on Bad phosphorylation and Bcl-2 expression.",

    "39": "1. Muscarinic cholinoceptors (MChR) in freshly dispersed rat salivary gland (RSG) cells were characterized using microphysiometry to measure changes in acidification rates. Several non-selective and selective muscarinic antagonists were used to elucidate the nature of the subtypes mediating the response to carbachol. 2. The effects of carbachol (pEC(50) = 5.74 +/- 0.02 s.e.mean; n = 53) were highly reproducible and most antagonists acted in a surmountable, reversible fashion. The following antagonist rank order, with apparent affinity constants in parentheses, was noted: 4-DAMP (8.9)= atropine (8.9) > tolterodine (8.5) > oxybutynin (7.9) > S-secoverine (7.2) > pirenzepine (6.9) > himbacine (6.8) > AQ-RA 741 (6.6) > methoctramine (5.9). 3. These studies validate the use of primary isolated RSG cells in microphysiometry for pharmacological analysis. These data are consistent with, and extend, previous studies using alternative functional methods, which reported a lack of differential receptor pharmacology between bladder and salivary gland tissue. 4. The antagonist affinity profile significantly correlated with the profile at human recombinant muscarinic M(3) and M(5) receptors. Given a lack of antagonists that discriminate between M(3) and M(5), definitive conclusion of which subtype(s) is present within RSG cells cannot be determined.", 
    "40": "1. Several lines of evidence suggest a crucial involvement of glutamate in the mechanism of action of anxiolytic and/or antidepressant drugs. The involvement of group I mGlu receptors in anxiety and depression has also been proposed. Given the recent discovery of a selective and brain penetrable mGlu5 receptor antagonists, the effect of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), i.e. the most potent compound described, was evaluated in established models of anxiety and depression. 2. Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats or male Albino Swiss or C57BL/6J mice. The anxiolytic-like effects of MPEP was tested in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats as well as in the four-plate test in mice. The antidepressant-like effect was estimated using the tail suspension test in mice and the behavioural despair test in rats. 3. MPEP (1 - 30 mg kg(-1)) induced anxiolytic-like effects in the conflict drinking test and the elevated plus-maze test in rats as well as in the four-plate test in mice. MPEP had no effect on locomotor activity or motor coordination. MPEP (1 - 20 mg kg(-1)) did shorten the immobility time in a tail suspension test in mice, however it was inactive in the behavioural despair test in rats. 4. These data suggest that selective mGlu5 receptor antagonists may play a role in the therapy of anxiety and/or depression, further studies are required to identify the sites and the mechanism of action of MPEP.",

We evaluated the effectiveness of intranasally administered midazolam spray in preventing claustrophobic responses of patients undergoing MR imaging.", 
    "49": "Fifty-four patients scheduled for MR imaging were included in this prospective study. Anxiety and sedation of patients were evaluated before drug administration, immediately before MR imaging, and at the end of the procedure. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the visual analogue scale of anxiety, and a five-point sedation scale were used. Half the patients received intranasal spray applications of 4 mg midazolam, whereas the other patients received a placebo, in a randomized, double-blind study design (six sprayings of 0.5% midazolam solution or NaCl 0.9%, respectively). The intensity of the sensation of burning of the nasal mucosa was rated by patients using a three-point scale (no, slight, or strong burning). The quality of scan images was evaluated by a radiologist using a five-point scale (0 = extremely poor, 5 = excellent).",

    "52": "1. The light/dark paradigm is based on the innate aversion of rodents to brightly illuminated areas and on the spontaneous exploratory behaviour of the animals, applying mild stressors i.e. novel environment and light. The test apparatus consists of a small dark secure compartment (one third) and a large illuminated aversive compartment (two thirds). 2. The test was developed with male mice. The strain, weight and age may be crucial factors. 3. The extent to which an anxiolytic compound can facilitate the exploratory activity depends on the baseline level in the control group. Differences between the type and severity of external stressors might account for variable results reported by different laboratories. 4. In conclusion, the black and white test may be useful to predict anxiolytic-like or anxiogenic-like activity in mice. Transitions have been reported to be an index of activity-exploration because of habituation over time and the time spent in each compartment to be a reflection of aversion. Classic anxiolytics (benzodiazepines) as well as the newer anxiolytic-like compounds (e.g. serotonergic drugs) can be detected using this paradigm. It has the advantages of being quick and easy to use, without requiring the prior training of animals.",

The presented screening conditions provide the basis for a unique routine screening method for low-dosed benzodiazepines with a broad polarity range.", 
    "54": "A novel sequence-selective pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer 5 (SJG-136) has been developed that comprises two C2-exo-methylene-substituted DC-81 (3) subunits tethered through their C8 positions via an inert propanedioxy linker. This symmetric molecule is a highly efficient minor groove interstrand DNA cross-linking agent (XL(50) = 0.045 microM) that is 440-fold more potent than melphalan. Thermal denaturation studies show that, after 18 h incubation with calf thymus DNA at a 5:1 DNA/ligand ratio, it increases the T(m) value by 33.6 degrees C, the highest value so far recorded in this assay. The analogous dimer 4 (DSB-120) that lacks substitution/unsaturation at the C2 position elevates melting by only 15.1 degrees C under the same conditions, illustrating the effect of introducing C2-exo-unsaturation which serves to flatten the C-rings and achieve a superior isohelical fit within the DNA minor groove. This behavior is supported by molecular modeling studies which indicate that (i) the PBD units are covalently bonded to guanines on opposite strands to form a cross-link, (ii) 5 has a greater binding energy compared to 4, and (iii) 4 and 5 have equivalent binding sites that span six base pairs. Dimer 5 is significantly more cytotoxic than 4 in a number of human ovarian cancer cell lines (e.g., IC(50) values of 0.0225 nM vs 7.2 nM, respectively, in A2780 cells). Furthermore, it retains full potency in the cisplatin-resistant cell line A2780cisR (0.024 nM), whereas 4 loses activity (0.21 microM) with a resistance factor of 29.2. This may be due to a lower level of inactivation of 5 by intracellular thiol-containing molecules. A dilactam analogue (21) of 5 that lacks the electrophilic N10-C11/N10'-C11' imine moieties has also been synthesized and evaluated. Although unable to interact covalently with DNA, 21 still stabilizes the helix (Delta T(m) = 0.78 degrees C) and has significant cytotoxicity in some cell lines (i.e., IC(50) = 0.57 microM in CH1 cells), presumably exerting its effect through noncovalent interaction with DNA.", 
    "55": "We report a case of intracerebral haemorrhages associated with continuous spinal analgesia. Continuous spinal analgesia is frequently employed for postoperative analgesia in high-risk patients in our institution. The analgesia is administered via a 20 gauge catheter passed through an 18 gauge Tuohy needle (Portex). A 71-year-old man with severe respiratory impairment had an intrathecal catheter placed for postoperative analgesia. He had a difficult postoperative course, including wound dehiscence, and died from respiratory failure some five weeks postoperatively. On day nine postoperatively he had two tonic-clonic seizures and was subsequently found to have developed bilateral frontal intracerebral haemorrhages. There was no previous history of seizures. Although several confounding variables exist, the most likely explanation for the intracerebral event appears to be an association with the dural puncture and intrathecal catheter Possible mechanisms and risk factors are discussed.", 
    "56": "Ketamine remains one of the most commonly used anaesthetic agents around the world. Despite it being the anaesthetic agent of choice in many developing nations, there is a paucity of literature describing ketamine in the developing world. In what we believe is the first randomized controlled trial to be performed in Vanuatu (formerly the New Hebrides) we compared the use of ketamine 0.9 mg/kg and diazepam 0.07 mg/kg with ketamine 0.3 mg/kg and 2% lignocaine infiltration in 50 Melanesian women undergoing post partum tubal ligation. All women received 0.5 mg/kg intramuscular pethidine. Visual analog pain scores and verbal numeric satisfaction scores were similar between the groups. However the time to obeyed command was significantly faster in the 0.3 mg/kg ketamine group (7.0+/-4.9 vs 13.0+/-9.2 min). The incidence of dreaming was similar and the content rated as pleasant by both groups. In institutions where post-anaesthesia care resources are limited, 0.3 mg/kg ketamine with local anaesthesia provides for earlier self-care of patients after tubal ligation, without compromise of analgesia, emergence or satisfaction. The implications of these findings extend to other procedures that require short general anaesthesia, which can be adequately performed with low-dose ketamine and local anaesthesia. The latter technique allows more rapid awakening.",

The implication of opioid and benzodiazepine system in the MFs-induced alteration of pain thresholds was also studied. 2. There was an increase at night time and a decrease at daytime of pain thresholds in normal mice. Exposure of MFs (24 h, 20 gauss (G)) inhibited the increase of pain thresholds at night time and even produced hyperalgesia at daytime. 3. The increase of pain thresholds induced by melatonin at daytime was inhibited by exposure to MFs (24 h, 20 G) or opioid antagonist naloxone. The MFs and naloxone synergically inhibited hypoalgesia produced by melatonin. The hyperalgesia at daytime after MFs exposure was potentiated by the benzodiazepine agonist, diazepam, and inhibited by the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. There was no significant difference in all rotarod performance we tested. 4. From these results, it is suggested that exposure to MFs inhibits the increase of pain thresholds at night time and produces hyperalgesia at daytime with the involvement of opioid and benzodiazepine systems.",

    "70": "Using in vitro quantitative autoradiography and [3H]flunitrazepam we examined the rostrocaudal distribution of benzodiazepine binding sites in the human neonate/infant hypothalamus. The autoradiographic analysis shows the presence of a heterogeneous distribution throughout the rostrocaudal extent of this brain structure. High [3H]flunitrazepam binding corresponds primarily to the diagonal band of Broca and the preoptic region. The labelling in the preoptic region showed a rostrocaudal increase, contrasting in that with the other hypothalamic structures. Intermediate densities were present in the septohypothalamic, suprachiasmatic, periventricular and paraventricular nuclei as well as in the mammillary complex. Low binding was observed in the other hypothalamic structures. The benzodiazepine binding sites analyzed belong mostly to type II receptors. In an attempt to unravel possible differences related to age, we compared the autoradiographic distribution in three postnatal age ranges. The topographical distribution of these binding sites was almost identical in each period analyzed. We found, however, that benzodiazepine binding is generally low in the neonatal period and a tendency in increasing densities is observed during development. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a large distribution of benzodiazepine binding sites in neonate/infant hypothalamus, suggesting their implication in the development of this brain structure and the maintenance of its various functions.", 
    "71": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), the principal inhibitory neurotransmitter, activates a persistent low amplitude tonic current in several brain regions in addition to conventional synaptic currents. Here we demonstrate that GABA(A) receptors mediating the tonic current in hippocampal neurons exhibit functional and pharmacological properties different from those of quantal synaptic currents. Patch-clamp techniques were used to characterize miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) and the tonic GABAergic current recorded in CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices and in dissociated neurons grown in culture. The competitive GABA(A) receptor antagonists, bicuculline and picrotoxin, blocked both the mIPSCs and the tonic current. In contrast, mIPSCs but not the tonic current were inhibited by gabazine (SR-95531). Coapplication experiments and computer simulations revealed that gabazine bound to the receptors responsible for the tonic current but did not prevent channel activation. However, gabazine competitively inhibited bicuculline blockade. The unitary conductance of the GABA(A) receptors underlying the tonic current (approximately 6 pS) was less than the main conductance of channels activated during quantal synaptic transmission (approximately 15--30 pS). Furthermore, compounds that potentiate GABA(A) receptor function including the benzodiazepine, midazolam, and anesthetic, propofol, prolonged the duration of mIPSCs and increased tonic current amplitude in cultured neurons to different extents. Clinically-relevant concentrations of midazolam and propofol caused a greater increase in tonic current compared with mIPSCs, as measured by total charge transfer. In summary, the receptors underlying the tonic current are functionally and pharmacologically distinct from quantally activated synaptic receptors and these receptors represent a novel target for neurodepressive drugs.", 
    "72": "We examined the current stimulus threshold in rats with the Neurometer, a device used clinically for measuring perception and pain thresholds. Although many studies have indicated the usefulness of this device in the quantification of nerve dysfunction in patients, we have found no published reports on the use of the Neurometer in animals. Transcutaneous nerve stimuli of the three sine-wave pulses produced by the Neurometer (at 2000, 250, and 5 Hz) were applied to plantar surface of rats. The intensity of each stimulation at which rats vocalized or were hardly startled was defined as the current stimulus threshold. With repeated stimulation, the thresholds were almost constant. Repeated topical application to the area around the stimulating electrode of a high concentration of capsaicin, which acts on small-diameter fibers, increased the thresholds at 250 and 5 Hz, but did not affect the 2000-Hz threshold. Intravenous morphine (2-5 mg/kg) increased all three thresholds, whereas intrathecal morphine (20 or 80 microg) increased only the 5-Hz threshold. Intravenous injection of a minor tranquilizer, diazepam, at 1 mg/kg raised the thresholds at 2000 and 250 Hz, but did not affect the 5-Hz threshold. Higher dose of diazepam increased all three thresholds. These results suggest that the Neurometer makes possible selective examination of subsets of nerve fibers that differ in diameter not only in humans but also in animals. The present study in rats, in which we established a method of measurement, may provide helpful suggestions for the interpretation of data in humans.", 
    "73": "In response to stressful events, neonatal mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs), which are suppressed by BZ agonists. The present study examined the role of the benzodiazepine/alpha1 (BZ/alpha1) receptor subtype in the suppression engendered by the BZ/alpha1-preferring agonist zolpidem and the nonselective BZ agonists triazolam and diazepam. The role of BZ receptor subtypes was explored further by conducting antagonism studies using the BZ/alpha1-preferring antagonist beta-carboline-3-carboxylate-t-butyl ester (beta-CCt), in comparison with the nonselective BZ antagonist flumazenil. Mouse pups (CFW strain) were separated from their dam and littermates at day 7, and placed for 4 min in a test chamber with reduced ambient temperature (19 +/- 1 degrees C) for recording USVs, motor incoordination (measured as a pup rolling on its back per grid cross), and body temperature. Zolpidem, triazolam, and diazepam suppressed USVs in a dose-dependent manner, concomitant with increases in incoordination and augmentation of hypothermia. These effects of the three BZ agonists were blocked by flumazenil in a manner consistent with surmountable antagonism. The ability of zolpidem, but not triazolam or diazepam, to suppress USVs and augment hypothermia was antagonized by beta-CCt, whereas the increase in motor incoordination engendered by zolpidem, triazolam, and diazepam was not sensitive to beta-CCt administration. Collectively, these results suggest that zolpidem suppresses distress USVs in mouse pups by a mechanism distinct from that of typical BZs. Furthermore, suppression of distress USVs by zolpidem may involve BZ/alpha1 receptors and a nonanxiolytic mechanism, such as hypothermia.", 
    "74": "Antiepileptic drugs provide neuroprotection in several animal models of brain damage, including those induced by status epilepticus (SE). The mechanisms involved in this action are unknown, but neurotrophic factors such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play a role. In this study we investigated the changes in BDNF levels in rats in which SE had been induced by pilocarpine injection (400 mg/kg i.p.) and continued for several hours (unprotected group). In other animals (protected groups), SE was suppressed after 30 min by intraperitoneal injection of either diazepam (10 mg/kg) + pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) or paraldehyde (0.3 mg/kg). In diazepam + pentobarbital-treated rats the hippocampal damage caused by SE was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in unprotected animals. In addition, 2 and 24 h after pilocarpine injection, the levels of BDNF mRNA were moderately increased in the unprotected group, but 'superinduced' in protected animals, especially in the neocortex and hippocampus. A time-dependent increase in BDNF immunoreactivity was also found by western blot analysis in rats treated with diazepam + pentobarbital. In contrast, a decrease of BDNF immunoreactivity occurred in the unprotected group. In conclusion, these results show that neuroprotection induced by anti-epileptic drugs in pilocarpine-treated rats is accompanied by strong potentiation of BDNF synthesis in brain regions involved in SE.", 
    "75": "Mitochondrial localization of p53 has been observed in several cell systems, but an understanding of its organelle-based physiological activity remains incomplete. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mitochondrial DNA genomic response to dominant-negative p53 mutant miniprotein (p53DD) fused to a mitochondrial import signal. Constructs were generated to express mitochondrial targeted enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) or dominant-negative mutant p53 miniprotein (m53DD) by in-frame fusion to the signal peptide sequence of murine Cox8l. Control cytosolic vectors (cEGFP, c53DD) had the signal sequence placed in antisense orientation. NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with these vectors in various combinations. Mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) expression and fluorochrome staining with Mitotracker Red CMXRos (DeltaPsim) were decreased in cells expressing m53DD. Both alterations were specific for mitochondrial import competence (e.g., m53DD vs. c53DD) as well as the passenger protein (e.g., m53DD vs. mEGFP). The normal functional state of mitochondria was restored with PK11195, a specific ligand of the mitochondrial peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. Negative dominance of m53DD on 16S rRNA expression and CMXRos staining, and rescue of these parameters with PK11195, imply a direct positive effect of p53 on mitochondrial biogenesis and function.", 
    "76": "Recent advances in neuroscience and genetics have enabled a better understanding of genetically influenced differences in ethanol (\"alcohol\")-related responses and differential vulnerability to alcohol dependence at the cellular and molecular levels. Heritability studies reveal that the role of genetic factors in alcoholism is largely substance-specific, with the exception of nicotine. One focus of genetic research in alcoholism is the study of functional polymorphisms influencing alcohol metabolism, such as the aldehyde dehydrogenase type 2 Glu487Lys and alcohol dehydrogenase type 2 His47Arg polymorphisms, which affect vulnerability to alcoholism via pharmacokinetic mechanisms, and cross-population studies have begun to reveal important gene-environment interactions. The other focus is on functional genetic variants of proteins involved in the neuronal response to alcohol, including alcohol sensitivity, reward, tolerance, and withdrawal. Studies on the roles of GABA(A) alpha6-amino acid substitutions in rodents in alcohol and benzodiazepine sensitivity, and potential roles in human alcohol and benzodiazepine sensitivity are reviewed. These studies, together with recently developed knowledge on a GABA(A) receptor gene cluster at a quantitative trait loci for alcohol withdrawal on mouse chromosome 11, indicate that research investigation of variation at GABA(A) neurotransmission is a promising area in the pharmacodynamics of alcohol and in differential susceptibility to alcoholism. Genes for proteins involved in alcohol-mediated reward include genes for transporters and receptors for dopamine, serotonin, opioids, and GABA. These genes and their functional variants also represent important targets for understanding alcohol's effects in humans. Identification of genes for alcoholism vulnerability is important in the near future, not only for prevention, but also for development and targeting treatments.", 
    "77": "We have identified CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 as the principal cytochrome P450s involved in the metabolism of flunitrazepam to its major metabolites desmethylflunitrazepam and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam. Human CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 mediated the formation of desmethylflunitrazepam with Km values of 11.1 and 108 microM, respectively, and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam with Km values of 642 and 34.0 microM, respectively. In human liver microsomes (n = 4) formation of both metabolites followed biphasic kinetics. Desmethylflunitrazepam formation was inhibited 31% by S-mephenytoin and 78% by ketoconazole, suggesting involvement of both CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. Formation of 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam was also significantly inhibited by ketoconazole (94%) and S-mephenytoin (18%). In support of these chemical inhibition data, antibodies directed against CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 selectively inhibited formation of desmethylflunitrazepam by 26 and 45%, respectively, while anti-CYP3A4 antibodies reduced 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam formation by 80%. Our data also suggest that CYP1A2, -2B6, -2C8, -2C9, -2D6, and -2E1 are not involved in either of these metabolic pathways. We estimate that the relative contributions of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 to the formation of desmethylflunitrazepam in vivo are 63 and 37%, respectively, at therapeutic flunitrazepam concentrations (0.03 microM). We conclude that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2C19 importantly mediates flunitrazepam demethylation, which may alter the efficacy and safety of the drug, while CYP3A4 catalyzes the formation of 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam.", 
    "78": "The extent of decreases in apparent hepatic clearance and intrinsic hepatic clearance of midazolam (MDZ) after intravenous administration of MDZ with concomitant oral administration of cimetidine (CIM), itraconazole (ITZ), or erythromycin (EM) was predicted using plasma unbound concentrations and liver unbound concentrations of inhibitors. When MDZ was concomitantly administered with CIM, the observed increase in MDZ concentration was successfully predicted using inhibition constants assessed by human liver microsome and liver-to-plasma unbound concentration ratios in rats. However, the extent of interaction with ITZ or EM was still underestimated even taking into account the concentrative uptake of inhibitors into liver. We could predict the degree of \"mechanism-based\" inhibition by EM on the hepatic metabolism of MDZ, after repeated administration of EM, by a physiological model incorporating the amount of active enzyme as well as the concentration of inhibitor. The maximum inactivation rate constant and the apparent inactivation constant of EM on MDZ metabolism were 0.0665 min(-1) and 81.8 microM, respectively. These kinetic parameters for the inactivation of the enzyme were applied to the physiological model with pharmacokinetic parameters of EM and MDZ obtained from published results. Consequently, we estimated that cytochrome P450 3A4 in the liver after repeated oral administration of EM was inactivated, resulting in 2.6-fold increase in the plasma concentration of MDZ. The estimated extent of increase in MDZ concentration in our study correlated well with the observed value based on metabolic inhibition by EM from published results.", 
    "79": "The potential for using antisense compounds as therapeutic agents has generated great enthusiasm. Strategies for delivery of these compounds are, therefore, of great interest. Transdermal iontophoresis has been used successfully as an enhancement technique for the transdermal delivery of these compounds in vitro. The effectiveness of using percutaneous penetration as a means to deliver therapeutic levels of these compounds in vivo, however, remains to be demonstrated. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the ability of iontophoretically delivered compounds to alter enzyme levels in the intact rat. A C5 propyne-modified phosphorothioate oligonucleotide (PS-ODN) targeted to the cytochrome p450-3A2 (CYP3A2) mRNA translational start site and the reverse sequence, used as a control, were synthesized. A patch containing either an oligonucleotide or a buffer control was placed on the animal's back, and an iontophoretic current of 0.5 mA/cm2 was applied for 3.5 hours. Twenty-four hours later, CYP3A2 levels were measured noninvasively using the midazolam-induced sleeping rat model. Liver and small intestinal microsomes were made after completion of sleep studies and assayed for CYP3A2, CYP1A1/2, CYP2B1/2, and CYP2E1. Midozolam-treated animals with antisense to CYP3A2 slept significantly longer than did the controls (p < 0.05). CYP3A2 levels were significantly lower in liver microsomes from antisense-treated animals than in either buffer control (p < 0.001) or reverse sequence animals (p < 0.05). The reverse sequence was also significantly different from the buffer control (p < 0.01), indicating a nonspecific effect of the PS background. Nontarget cytochrome levels were not altered by treatment. There were no significant differences in small intestine CYP3A2 levels between treatment groups. These data demonstrate that transdermally delivered PS-ODN can reach concentrations sufficient to induce changes in specific target enzymes in vivo. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential uses for these molecules.", 
    "80": "The inotropic effect of diazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, and its mechanism of action were examined using guinea pig heart and single ventricular cell preparations. In Langendorff hearts and right ventricular free-wall preparations, diazepam (10 to 100 microM) produced a monophasic negative inotropic effect in a concentration dependent manner. Neither a central type (flumazenil 1 microM) nor a peripheral type (PK11195 10 microM) of benzodiazepine receptor antagonist antagonized the monophasic negative inotropic effects of diazepam. Diazepam (10 to 100 microM) shortened action potential duration of papillary muscle in a concentration dependent manner. In isolated single ventricular cells, diazepam (30 and 100 microM) inhibited the calcium current (I(Ca)) in a concentration dependent manner. Diazepam produced a significant decrease in I(Ca) elicited by first depolarizing pulses, however, the decrease of I(Ca) was not augmented during a train of depolarizing pulses. Thus, diazepam appears to produce a tonic block of cardiac calcium channels and the mode of inhibition is clearly different from the use-dependent block of verapamil. From these results, it was concluded that diazepam produces a monophasic negative inotropic effect that is independent of the benzodiazepine receptor, and is probably mediated through an inhibition of I(Ca) in guinea pig heart preparations.", 
    "81": "Radioligand binding assays evaluating directly the ability of a drug to interact with a defined molecular target is part of the drug discovery process. The need for a high throughput rate in screening drugs is actually leading to simplified experimental schemes that increase the probability of false negative results. Special concern involves voltage-gated ion channel drug discovery where a great care is required in designing assays because of frequent multiplicity of (interacting) binding sites. To clearly illustrate this situation, three different assays used in the academic drug discovery program of the authors were selected because they are rich of intrinsic artifacts: (I) (20 mmol/l caffeine almost duplicated [3H]ryanodine binding (89% higher than control) to rat heart microsomes at 0.3 mumol/l free calcium but did not exert any effect when using a high (107 mumol/l) free calcium, as mostly used in ryanodine binding assays; (II) An agonist for the ionotropic glutamate receptor of the kainate type can distinctly affect [3H]kainate binding to chicken cerebellum membranes depending on its concentration: unlabelled kainic acid per se either stimulated about 30% (at 50-100 nmol/l), had no effect (at 200 nmol/l) or even progressively decreased (at 0.3-2 mumol/l) the binding of 5 nmol/l [3H]kainate, emphasizing the risk of using a single concentration for screening a drug; (III) in a classical [3H]flunitrazepam binding assay, the stimulatory effect of a GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) agonist was only observed when using extensively washed rat brain synaptosomes (10 mumol/l GABA increased flunitrazepam binding by 90%). On the other hand, the inhibitory effect of a GABA antagonist was only observed when using crude synaptosomes (10 mumol/l bicuculine reduced [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 40%). It can be concluded that carefully designed radioligand assays which can be performed in an academic laboratory are appropriate for screening a small number of drugs, especially if these are potential hits because of their rational design. Therefore, the low throughput rate could be partially balanced by a higher performance when compared to what is done in a robotic high throughput screening where simplification of assay conditions can lead to false negative results.", 
    "82": "Stiff-person syndrome (SPS) is a disorder of motor function characterized by rigidity of axial musculature and fluctuating painful spasms, which are often induced by startle or emotional stimuli. Neurophysiological studies have demonstrated the presence of continuous motor unit activity in muscle at rest, with abnormally enhanced extereoceptive reflexes. Although criteria for the diagnosis of SPS were proposed, several variants of this syndrome have been described before. In this communication, we report the case of a patient with a focal form of SPS. A 39-year-old woman developed progressive instability in her gait, spasms and stiffness restricted to both legs. The electromyographic examination showed continuous motor unit activity of the affected muscles at rest. Moreover, high anti-GAD antibodies titers were found in CSF and serum. Clinical symptoms, electrophysiological and immunological profiles suggest a focal form of SPS. Clinical and immunological findings indicate that SPS is a heterogeneous disease, suggesting the need to redefine its diagnostic criteria. Definition of the range of clinical expression and immunological profiles could be important for the clinical management of these patients.", 
    "83": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) peptide is a recently described neuropeptide that has been localized to areas of the central and peripheral nervous systems. CART has been shown to be involved in feeding behavior when injected centrally, however, its effects upon peripheral tissues have not been studied. This report describes the effects of CART peptide on rat pancreatic exocrine secretion. Infusion of CART peptide caused four-fold increases in amylase secretion from anesthetized rats that had been fashioned with a bile-pancreatic duct cannula. CART peptide-induced increases in pancreatic secretion appear to involve pathways that are sensitive to both acetylcholine (ACh) and cholecystokinin (CCK) since pre-treatment with atropine (ACh receptor antagonist) or L-364,718 (CCK-A receptor antagonist) inhibited the effects of CART peptide on amylase secretion. Pre-treatment with a combination of atropine and L-364,718 abolished the effects of CART peptide. When isolated rat pancreatic acini were exposed to varying doses of CART peptide, no increase in amylase secretion was observed. The results of the present study suggest that CART peptide has stimulatory effects upon pancreatic exocrine secretion. CART peptide-induced increases in pancreatic secretion appear to be indirectly mediated as no direct effect upon pancreatic acini was shown. CART peptide likely acts upon either peripheral or central regulators of pancreatic secretory function that are distant from the acinar unit.",

This report presents a series of 11 consecutive cases documenting the use of ketamine anesthesia in a remote hospital at an altitude of 3,900 m, by primary-care physicians without specialist training in anesthesia. The method of administration is fully described. At a low dose of 2.0 mg/kg, ketamine produces a dissociative anesthesia that does not depress the hypoxic drive, or interfere with the pharyngeal or laryngeal reflexes. Although supplemental oxygen is useful in the recovery phase for less acclimatized individuals, it is usually not required as reductions in oxygen saturation can be raised by physical stimulation that encourages the patient to breathe faster and deeper. The common side effect of emergent nightmares was avoided using midazolam as premedication and a quiet recovery area.

In the second prospective study 64 patients undergoing two necessary endoscopic procedures were included: one deep sedation with propofol alone, the second one with combination of midazolam bolus followed by propofol.", 
    "91": "It was demonstrated that induction of deep sedation by an i.v. bolus of 2.5 mg midazolam, followed by small doses of propofol is safe, without undesirable side effects, e.g. respiratory or circulation depression. Recovery time increased (4 to 8 minutes) with the combination M/P, costs decreased by saving 59% propofol per minute. This may be important for longer endoscopic procedures.",

    "94": "The general premise that receptor theory provides a useful framework for understanding the behavioral effects of psychoactive drugs has been a central tenet of behavioral pharmacology.", 
    "95": "The purpose of this review is to reiterate this basic theme and, in particular, the proposition that current concepts of pharmacological efficacy can be effectively used to examine behavioral effects of drugs with abuse or dependence potential in a way that contributes to the discovery of drugs to treat drug dependence.", 
    "96": "The review begins by briefly introducing the concept of efficacy and follows with several illustrations of how our current understanding of efficacy can be used to address important research questions in drug discovery. In the first, the likelihood of developing novel opioid analgesics with reduced abuse potential is addressed by considering the different efficacy requirements for the discriminative-stimulus and antinociceptive effects of mu-opioids. From a pharmacologically different perspective within drug abuse research, the review continues with an exposition of efficacy-related differences in the behavioral effects of dopamine D1 agonists and how such differences might be exploited in different medications strategies for treating cocaine dependence. The principles of pharmacological efficacy also have come to guide the development of novel GABAA-related antianxiety medications, and this is illustrated in a discussion of the utility of low-efficacy agonists in the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence. The second half of the paper provides counterpoint to the several examples of how principles of efficacy can be applied in drug discovery. The counterpoint includes, first, a critical evaluation of how the concept of efficacy has been applied in the development of monoamine transport inhibitors as anti-cocaine medications and, in particular, the difficulties this may pose for data analysis. The review ends with a discussion of efficacy-based analysis in drug discrimination research and illustrates some of the obstacles that may be encountered in pharmacologically classifying drugs on this basis.", 
    "97": "Ample evidence indicates that many receptor systems can be activated in a graded manner and that principles of efficacy can be judiciously applied to understand and exploit the behavioral effects of drugs that result from such graded activation. However, as cautioned in the last sections, the misapplication of pharmacological concepts in behavioral studies of drugs may obscure their behavioral pharmacology and potentially confound drug discovery.",

To test receptor subtype specificity, displacement studies were carried out by competitive binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 against six benzodiazepine receptor ligands, flunitrazepam [5-(2-fluoro-phenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-7-nitro-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one], alpidem [N,N-dipropyl-6-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide], zolpidem [N,N-6 trimethyl-2-(4-methyl-phenyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide hemitartrate], and beta-CCM (methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate). Saturation studies showed that [3H]Ro 15-1788 bound saturatably, reversibly and with a high affinity to a single class of binding sites (Kd value of 1.18-1.5 nM and Bmax values of 124-1671 fmol/mg of protein, depending on brain regions). The highest concentration of benzodiazepine recognition sites labeled with [3H]Ro 15-1788 was present in the optic lobe and the olfactory bulb and the lowest concentration was found in the medulla oblongata, cerebellum and spinal cord. The rank order of displacement efficacy of unlabelled ligands observed suggested that central-type benzodiazepine receptors are present in one class of binding sites (Type I-like) in brain membranes of Mugil cephalus. Moreover, the uptake of 36Cl- into M. cephalus brain membrane vesicles was only marginally stimulated by concentrations of GABA that significantly enhanced the 36Cl- uptake into mammalian brain membrane vesicles. The results may indicate a different functional activity of the GABA-coupled chloride ionophore in the fish brain as compared with the mammalian brain.",

The assay has a lower limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/ml in tissue homogenate and utilizes a liquid-liquid extraction followed by reversed-phase HPLC for the quantitative analysis of olanzapine. The method provided a linear response for olanzapine over a concentration range of 0.5-100 ng/ml with a coefficient of determination (r2) greater than 0.9995. The extraction efficiencies of olanzapine and internal standard (LY170158) were greater than 82% in brain tissue. The intra-assay and inter-assay relative errors ranged from -5.38 to 17.60% and -3.25 to 10.53%, respectively. The intra-assay and inter-assay RSD values were in the range of 1.12 to 6.96% and 3.78 to 6.68%. Long-term stability studies showed that brain tissue homogenate samples spiked with olanzapine and internal standard are stable at -70 degrees C for at least 110 days. However, a room temperature stability study showed that olanazapine was not stable in brain homogenate if the sample was exposed at 25 degrees C longer than 2 h. This method has been used for the study of the disposition and pharmacokinetics of olanzapine in male Sprague-Dawley rats.", 
    "105": "Conditions were worked out for the separation of carbamazepine, olanzapine, and their main metabolites carbamazepine 10,11-epoxide, 10-hydroxycarbamazepine, and desmethylolanzapine. The separation was based on electrokinetically driven methods in the capillary format. The main difficulty in separating these compounds is related to their different chemical classes. Whereas the carbamazepine members are amides, and are electrically neutral, the olanzapine members have aliphatic amino groups and are thus cationic under most experimental conditions. Different additives were applied as pseudo-stationary phases to implement selectivity. Poly(diallyldimethylammonium), PDADMA, is a polycationic replaceable and soluble polymer, that interacts mainly according to the polarisability of the analyte molecules. The MEKC principle was applied with the common SDS as micelle former. In both systems, only partial resolution of the analytes was obtained. The most favorable system consisted of a charged, oligomeric additive: full separation of all analytes within 4 min was achieved with heptakis-6-sulfato-beta-cyclodextrin (7 mM) in 30 mM borate buffer, pH 8.5.",

Treatment was carried out in children aged 4-17 years with low dose escalation from 5 to 45 mg/day, in three doses until good clinical effects were obtained. In 3 patients aged 4 years, in 11 children aged 5-12 years and in 11 children aged above 17 years Gabitril was used. Follow up period was 8-10 months. Frequency of epileptic seizures before implementation of Gabitril treatment, even during polytherapy with 2 or more antiepileptic drugs was several to hundred per day (status epilepticus was observed in 2 children with Rasmussen syndrome). During the observation 5 children became seizure free, in 11 patients reduction in seizures frequency above 50% was observed and in 9 children effects of treatment were not good enough. Gabitril was well tolerated, and any adverse events were observed in add-on therapy. Preliminary observation and good results of add-on therapy with Gabitril are positive. Drug is safe and generally well-tolerated with good effects at add-on therapy in 64% children with resistant partial complex and secondary generalized seizures.", 
    "107": "DRUG ABUSERS: Drugs are widely used by toxicomaniacs to reproduce drug effects. Drug abusers generally start with psychotrops, but other abuse drug classes. Toxicomanic behavior leads to addictive practices that are difficult to control. BARBITURATES: Both the oral and intravenous routes are used. The expected result is a state of ecstasy with a feeling of comfort. Intoxication may cause respiratory depression. Barbiturates induce physical and psychic dependence. Abuse is not widespread with this class of drugs. BENZODIAZEPINES: Drug abuses widely use benzodiazepines orally or intravenously. They search for a flash effect, with sedation and a feeling of comfort. All benzodiazepines induce physical and psychic dependence. Death may result from combinations leading to respiratory depression. Flunitrazepam is the most widely abused benzodiazepine in France. It induces serious neuropsychic disorders. ANTIDEPRESSANTS: Few are used, mostly at high doses. OPIATES: Administration gives the same effect as heroine injection. Opiates induce physical and psychic dependence. The adverse effects are similar to those of morphine with a higher risk of respiratory depression. AMPHETAMINES: Few are used, either orally or intravenously. They induce a flash with excitation, euphoria, and a period of invincibility. This is followed by a period of depression with risk of suicide. Psychic dependence is high. ANTICHOLINERGIC ANTIPARKINSONIANS: These drugs are well known to abusers for their hallucinatory effect. They induce atropinic adverse effects and physical and psychic dependence. GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRATE: This anesthetic is used for its euphoria and sedation effects. It may induce falling sickness or coma, with a risk of respiratory depression. KETAMINE: Administered via the intranasal route, ketamine induces a state of indifference. Death has been observed. ANABOLIC AND ANDROGENIC STEROIDS: These drugs are used for their physical and psychic stimulating effect. They induce potentially dangerous adverse effects such as cardiovascular, hepatic, neurological and psychiatric disorders. Clinical signs of addiction and weaning are observed. OTHERS: Several other drug classes are used by abusers, including analgics, beta-adrenergic agents, nasal vasoconstrictors and corticosteroids.",

A diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is best made by ruling out other psychiatric and general medical conditions and by collecting daily ratings of symptom expression across the menstrual cycle. Recent treatment findings support the use of (1) antidepressants that block the serotonin transporter, and (2) the benzodiazepine anxiolytic alprazolam.

More than half of all subjects were receiving concomitant antidepressants, of whom nearly 50% received the SSRI antidepressants and nearly 25% received buproprion. Approximately 40% of subjects received benzodiazepines. Only 18% of subjects received monotherapy, and nearly 50% received three or more psychotropic agents. In general, no associations were noted between demographic parameters including age, gender, marital or educational status, and psychotropic prescriptions.",

    "122": "We studied female GRP-R-deficient mice with respect to olfactory function and social behavior toward male conspecifics. Results of a food exploration test (hidden cookie method) revealed that the olfactory ability of these mutant mice is identical to that of wild-type mice. However, when preference toward either a socially dominant or subordinate male mouse was assessed in a social preference test, wild-type mice showed a greater preference for socially dominant males than did GRP-R-deficient mice. In contrast, in a social investigation test to an anesthetized male mouse, GRP-R-deficient mice exhibited greater investigatory behavior toward the target male than did wild-type mice. When female C57BL/6J mice were given diazepam (0, 1, 2 or 4 mg/kg, i.p.), their investigatory behavior to the anesthetized male target was increased in a dose-dependent manner. Conversely, i.p. administration of bicuculline (1 mg/kg) significantly decreased the social investigatory behavior of female GRP-R-deficient mice, but not of wild-type mice. These results indicate that female GRP-R-deficient mice exhibit altered responsiveness to male conspecifics relative to their wild-type counterparts, and suggest that this outcome may be attributable, at least in part, to altered GABAergic function in these mutant mice.", 
    "123": "Olanzapine is a serotonin-dopamine receptor antagonist primarily used in the treatment of psychotic illnesses. It has been shown in numerous large trials to be as equally effective as haloperidol in the acute treatment and maintenance treatment of schizophrenia. However, olanzapine was shown to be more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of negative symptoms and to cause significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms. Furthermore, early reports suggest that olanzapine produces less tardive dyskinesia than haloperidol, though longer follow-up data are needed. Current studies have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of refractory schizophrenia. One comparison trial of olanzapine versus risperidone has indicated similar efficacy. Clinical trials in acute mania have found olanzapine to be more effective than placebo. However, there is no role for olanzapine monotherapy in bipolar disorder given current studies. Although olanzapine has shown a low rate of extrapyramidal symptoms, it is not without adverse effects. Clinically significant weight gain has been noted with olanzapine in each of the large clinical trials. The degree of weight gain is similar to clozapine and probably greater than that observed with risperidone. The long-term medical consequence of atypical antipsychotic-induced weight gain is not known at this time. While generally considered first-line drugs from an efficacy and adverse effect standpoint, pharmacoeconomic studies are needed to justify the large acquisition cost of olanzapine compared to typical agents.",

Compounds with an affinity significantly higher than the parent compound CGS-8216 were obtained, the most active ligand showing a pIC50 = 10.35. Hansch and comparative molecular field analyses gave coherent results suggesting the main structural requirements of high receptor binding affinity. The possible formation of a three-centred hydrogen bond (HB) at the HB donor site H2, as a key interaction for high receptor binding affinity, was assessed by the calculation and comparison of the molecular electrostatic potentials of a series of selected ligands.", 
    "126": "A large number of structurally different classes of ligands, many of them sharing the main characteristics of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) nucleus, are active in the modulation of anxiety, sedation, convulsion, myorelaxation, hypnotic and amnesic states in mammals. These compounds have high affinity for the benzodiazepine binding site (BDZ-bs) of the GABA(A) receptor complex. Since 1989 onwards our laboratories established that some natural flavonoids were ligands for the BDZ-bs which exhibit medium to high affinity in vitro and anxiolytic activity in vivo. Further research resulted in the production of synthetic flavonoid derivatives with increased biochemical and pharmacological activities. The currently accepted receptor/pharmacophore model of the BDZ-bs (Zhang, W.; Koeler, K. F.; Zhang, P.; Cook, J. M. Drug Des. Dev. 1995, 12, 193) accounts for the general requirements that should be met by this receptor for ligand recognition. In this paper we present a model pharmacophore which defines the characteristics for a ligand to be able to interact and bind to a flavone site, in the GABA(A) receptor. closely related to the BDZ-bs. A model of a flavone binding site has already been described (Dekermendjian, K.; Kahnberg, P.; Witt, M. R.; Sterner, O.; Nielsen, M.; Liljerfors, T. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4343). However, this alternative model is based only on graphic superposition techniques using as template a non-BDZ agonist. In this investigation all the natural and synthetic flavonoids found to be ligands for the BDZ-bs have been compared with the classical BDZ diazepam. A QSAR regression analysis of the parameters that describe the interaction demonstrates the relevance of the electronic effects for the ligand binding, and shows that they are associated with the negatively charged oxygen atom of the carbonyl group of the flavonoids and with the nature of the substituent in position 3'.", 
    "127": "Neurotoxicity has often been associated with glutamate receptor stimulation and neuroprotection with glutamate receptor blockade. However, the relationship may be much more complex. We dissociated cells from the rat neocortical anlage at an early stage of prenatal development (embryonic day 14). The cells were exposed in vitro to agonists and antagonists of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA)/kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and the effects on differentiation and survival have been quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated. NMDA and the non-competitive antagonist (5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate (MK-801) had the expected effects (the agonist decreasing and the antagonist increasing neuronal survival) when applied at a relatively advanced stage of in vitro maturation, but no significant effect in either direction at earlier stages. Kainate also had an effect on cell survival only at an advanced stage (where it decreased the number of cells). However, this cannot be attributed to the absence of functional AMPA/kainate receptors at earlier stages, since: (1) cells could be loaded with cobalt; and (2) early application of kainate dramatically reduced the number of cobalt-positive cells. Furthermore, exposure at early stages to 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), or GYKI 53655, (competitive and non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonists, respectively) strongly reduced cell survival. The effects were concentration- and time-dependent with a complex time--curve. The decrease in cell number was maximal after antagonist application from 2 to 5 days in vitro. The effects of DNQX could be cancelled by co-application of kainate. When exposed to an antagonist at later stages of development, the number of surviving cells gradually approached control values and finally became significantly higher. Our results suggest that cells of the developing neocortex (and perhaps newly generated cells in the adult brain) require at different stages of their development, an appropriate level of AMPA/kainate receptor activation.", 
    "128": "Protracted administration of diazepam elicits tolerance, whereas discontinuation of treatment results in signs of dependence. Tolerance to the anticonvulsant action of diazepam is present in an early phase (6, 24, and 36 h) but disappears in a late phase (72-96 h) of withdrawal. In contrast, signs of dependence such as decrease in open-arm entries on an elevated plus-maze and increased susceptibility to pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures were apparent 96 h (but not 12, 24, or 48 h) after diazepam withdrawal. During the first 72 h of withdrawal, tolerance is associated with changes in the expression of GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) receptor subunits (decrease in gamma(2) and alpha(1); increase in alpha(5)) and with an increase of mRNA expression of the most abundant form of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), GAD(67). In contrast, dl-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor GluR1 subunit mRNA and cognate protein, which are normal during the early phase of diazepam withdrawal, increase by approximately 30% in cortex and hippocampus in association with the appearance of signs of dependence 96 h after diazepam withdrawal. Immunohistochemical studies of GluR1 subunit expression with gold-immunolabeling technique reveal that the increase of GluR1 subunit protein is localized to layer V pyramidal neurons and their apical dendrites in the cortex, and to pyramidal neurons and in their dendritic fields in hippocampus. The results suggest an involvement of GABA-mediated processes in the development and maintenance of tolerance to diazepam, whereas excitatory amino acid-related processes (presumably via AMPA receptors) may be involved in the expression of signs of dependence after withdrawal.",

The drugs (ketrodol--0.5 mg/kg, diazepam--0.15 mg/kg, clofelin--1 microg/kg) were used to potentiate local anesthesia in operation--submucosal resection of the nasal septum under novocain solution anesthesia. Control 15 patients were operated under local anesthesia with morphine premedication (dose 10 mg). Adequacy of anesthesia was assessed by parameters of central and peripheral hemodynamics. Local anesthesia with morphine significantly activated sympathoadrenal system. Hyperdynamia was secured at the expense of accelerated cardiac rhythm with relatively low myocardial performance. Premedication with the chewing gum allowed to avoid pressor responses to the trauma in moderate hyperdynamia with adequate cardiac performance and minimal shifts in myocardial contractility.",

Therapeutic failure rates were 19.6% and 33.4% for the propofol 2% and propofol 1% groups, respectively (p =.127). The lower frequency of hypertriglyceridemia was associated with a higher number of patients reaching weaning. Weaning time was similar in the two propofol groups, 32.3 hrs ($1,744) for the propofol 2% group vs. 97.9 hrs ($5,287) for the midazolam group. Cost of sedation was $2.68 per hour for the midazolam group and $7.69 per hour for the propofol group. There was a favorable cost-benefit ratio for the propofol group, attributable to the shorter weaning time, although benefit was less than expected because higher doses of propofol 2% than propofol 1% were required during the first 48 hrs (p <.05).", 
    "141": "The new propofol 2% preparation is an effective sedative agent and is safe because of the low frequency of associated hypertriglyceridemia. The shorter weaning time associated with the use of propofol 2% as compared with midazolam compensates for its elevated cost. The economic benefit of propofol 2% is less than expected because higher doses of propofol 2% than propofol 1% are required over the first 48 hrs.", 
    "142": "Many hypotheses have been made to explain the high rate of benzodiazepine consumption in France, including a general cultural and/or familial tendency to use certain types of psychotropic drugs. This study explored the association between lifetime medication use by parents and their children. Two hundred and twenty-one young patients (158 boys and 63 girls) consulting at a child and adolescent psychiatry department, six to 16 years of age (mean = 9.7 years), were screened for lifetime use of psychotropic drugs using a structured interview. Parents were asked about their own consumption, as well as their children's. Lifetime consumption rates (at least once) were 22.2% in boys and 20.6% in girls, and 19.6% in children less than 11 years old. Higher rates were found in patients with emotional disorders (anxiety disorders and depression). In parents, 45.1% of mothers and 24.1% of fathers reported using medications at least once. A significant association was found between child and parental medication use: 34.1% of children had positive lifetime consumption when their mothers also used medications at least once versus only 13.6% in other children (odds ratio = 3.31 [1.68-6.50]; P = 0.001). The most significant association was found between medication use by girls and their mothers (odds ratio = 12.1 [2.38-61.5]; P = 0.003). These data point to the existence of a family pattern of psychotropic drug consumption, especially in females.",

The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation in a modified Clevenger extractor and analysed by GC/ MS. This analysis revealed in the oil the presence of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and of arylpropanoids. The compound sarisan, a myristicin analogue, was isolated from the oil to perform the pharmacological tests. Emulsions of the oil and of sarisan (5.0 and 10.0% v/v) were used in the tests. Pentobarbital (30 mg/ kg s.c.) or diazepam (2.5 mg/ kg s.c.) were tested as standard drugs to verify depressant or anxiolytic effects, respectively. Both essential oil and sarisan showed to have exciting and depressant effects in the tested animals.", 
    "144": "We have investigated the GABA(A) alpha(6) subunit molecular composition in two rat lines selectively bred for high or low ethanol preference and consumption, namely Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and Sardinian non-alcohol-preferring (sNP) rats, which have been bred at the University of Cagliari, Italy, since 1981. A total of 27 sP, 22 sNP and 25 control rats belonging to five other different strains, were studied by direct sequencing and amplification refractory mutation system analysis. Among the sNPs, only one was found to be normal, 11 heterozygotes, and 10 homozygotes for the G-->A substitution in codon 100, the same R100Q point mutation previously described in Alcohol Non Tolerant rats, while no other animal showed any mutated allele. Pharmacological studies have extensively demonstrated that this substitution in the mature peptide changes the benzodiazepine-insensitive receptor to a sensitive one. In order to test the functional significance of this mutation in native cerebellar GABA(A) receptors, selective breeding from Q/R rats was employed to obtain a sufficient number of R/R homozygotes. Xenopus laevis oocytes were then injected with cerebellar synaptosomes extracted from Q/Q, R/Q and R/R sNP rats. Consistently, utilizing the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, GABA-evoked currents mediated by GABA(A) receptors containing the mutated alpha(6) subunit were potentiated by diazepam with about a two-fold increased potency, as compared to receptors containing the wild-type, benzodiazepine-insensitive alpha(6) subunit. Our data show for the first time that a mutated GABA(A) alpha(6) receptor subunit segregates in a rat line which voluntarily avoids alcohol consumption, and further support a possible involvement of the GABA(A) receptor containing a mutated alpha(6) subunit in the genetic predisposition to alcohol preference.", 
    "145": "Systemic administration of amphetamine results in increases in the release of acetylcholine in the cortex. Basal forebrain mediation of this effect was examined in three experiments using microdialysis in freely-moving rats. Experiment 1 examined whether dopamine receptor activity within the basal forebrain was necessary for amphetamine-induced increase in cortical acetylcholine by examining whether intra-basalis perfusion of dopamine antagonists attenuates this increase. Systemic administration of 2.0 mg/kg amphetamine increased dopamine efflux within the basal forebrain nearly 700% above basal levels. However, the increase in cortical acetylcholine efflux following amphetamine administration was unaffected by intra-basalis perfusions of high concentrations of D1- (100 microM SCH 23390) or D2-like (100 microM sulpiride) dopamine receptor antagonists. Experiments 2 and 3 determined whether glutamatergic or GABAergic local modulation of the excitability of the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons influences the ability of systemic amphetamine to increase cortical acetylcholine efflux. In Experiment 2, perfusion of kynurenate (1.0 mM), a non-selective glutamate receptor antagonist, into the basal forebrain attenuated the increase in cortical acetylcholine produced by amphetamine. Experiment 3 revealed that positive modulation of GABAergic transmission by bilateral intra-basalis infusion of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (40 microg/hemisphere) also attenuated the amphetamine-stimulated increase in cortical acetylcholine efflux. These data suggest that amphetamine increases cortical acetylcholine release via a complex neuronal network rather than simply increasing basal forebrain D1 or D2 receptor activity.", 
    "146": "The GABA(A) receptor is an important target for a variety of general anesthetics (Franks and Lieb, 1994) and for benzodiazepines such as diazepam. Specific point mutations in the GABA(A) receptor selectively abolish regulation by benzodiazepines (Rudolph et al., 1999; McKernan et al., 2000) and by anesthetic ethers (Mihic et al., 1997; Krasowski et al., 1998; Koltchine et al., 1999), suggesting the existence of discrete binding sites on the GABA(A) receptor for these drugs. Using anesthetics of different molecular size (isoflurane > halothane > chloroform) together with complementary mutagenesis of specific amino acid side chains, we estimate the volume of a proposed anesthetic binding site as between 250 and 370 A(3). The results of the \"cutoff\" analysis suggest a common site of action for the anesthetics isoflurane, halothane, and chloroform on the GABA(A) receptor. Moreover, the data support a crucial role for Leu232, Ser270, and Ala291 in the alpha subunit in defining the boundaries of an amphipathic cavity, which can accommodate a variety of small general anesthetic molecules.", 
    "147": "GABA receptors within the mesolimbic circuitry have been proposed to play a role in regulating alcohol-seeking behaviors in the alcohol-preferring (P) rat. However, the precise GABA(A) receptor subunit(s) mediating the reinforcing properties of EtOH remains unknown. We examined the capacity of intrahippocampal infusions of an alpha5 subunit-selective ( approximately 75-fold) benzodiazepine (BDZ) inverse agonist [i.e., RY 023 (RY) (tert-butyl 8-(trimethylsilyl) acetylene-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo [1,5a] [1,4] benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate)] to alter lever pressing maintained by concurrent presentation of EtOH (10% v/v) and a saccharin solution (0.05% w/v). Bilateral (1.5-20 microgram) and unilateral (0.01-40 microgram) RY dose-dependently reduced EtOH-maintained responding, with saccharin-maintained responding being reduced only with the highest doses (e.g., 20 and 40 microgram). The competitive BDZ antagonist ZK 93426 (ZK) (7 microgram) reversed the RY-induced suppression on EtOH-maintained responding, confirming that the effect was mediated via the BDZ site on the GABA(A) receptor complex. Intrahippocampal modulation of the EtOH-maintained responding was site-specific; no antagonism by RY after intra-accumbens [nucleus accumbens (NACC)] and intraventral tegmental [ventral tegmental area (VTA)] infusions was observed. Because the VTA and NACC contain very high densities of alpha1 and alpha2 subunits, respectively, we determined whether RY exhibited a \"negative\" or \"neutral\" pharmacological profile at recombinant alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha2beta3gamma2, and alpha5beta3gamma2 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. RY produced \"classic\" inverse agonism at all alpha receptor subtypes; thus, a neutral efficacy was not sufficient to explain the failure of RY to alter EtOH responding in the NACC or VTA. The results provide the first demonstration that the alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors in the hippocampus play an important role in regulating EtOH-seeking behaviors.", 
    "148": "The present investigation dealt with the effect of simultaneous administration of flumazenil on the hypnotic activity of propofol using a behavioral model of ddY mice. The mixed solution of propofol and flumazenil was administered intravenously into the mice tail vein and the achievement of hypnosis was defined as the loss of the righting reflex. Flumazenil 0.2 mg.kg-1 significantly decreased the required dose of propofol for hypnosis (8.43 +/- 0.46 mg.kg-1) compared to the control group (10.55 +/- 0.55 mg.kg-1). The mixture with a pH-3.9 acetate buffer solution did not change the hypnotic dose of propofol (10.88 +/- 0.62 mg.kg-1). The results suggest that flumazenil might potentiate the hypnotic activity of propofol in ddY mice.", 
    "149": "The effects of N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester (L-NAME) a nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor and L-arginine, a NO precursor, were investigated on lidocaine-induced convulsions. In the first experiment, four groups of mice received physiological saline (0.9%), L-arginine (300 mg/kg, i.p.), L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg), respectively. Thirty minutes after these injections, all mice received lidocaine (50 mg/kg, i.p.). In the second experiment, four groups of mice received similar treatment in the first experiment, and 30 min after these injections, all mice received a higher dose of lidocaine (80 mg/kg). L-NAME (100 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (2 mg/kg) significantly decreased the incidence of lidocaine (50 mg/kg)-induced convulsions. In contrast, the L-arginine treatment increased the incidence of lidocaine (80 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced convulsions significantly. These results may suggest that NO is a proconvulsant mediator in lidocaine-induced convulsions.",

Acute administration of the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam has been shown to decrease false recognition rates. However, no false recognition studies have examined the effects of scopolamine, an anticholinergic drug that might produce a different profile of memory-impairing effects than the benzodiazepines due to its distinct neurochemical profile.",

There were 1-2 syncopes in a month. Both before and after the treatment an active orthostatic test was performed with ECG registration and following analysis of variability of the cardiac rhythm. Clonazepam was administered in a dose of 2-2.5 mg/day during 8-9 weeks. Clinical improvement in the form of a lack of syncopes was observed in 20 patients (74%); 3 patients (10%) had isolated lipothymic states; 2 patients discontinued the treatment because of side-effects (dizziness).

    "156": "Epidemiological data indicate that the long-term prognosis in the vast majority of children with febrile seizures is good. Three main problems are important for the treatment: febrile seizures are extremely upsetting for the parents, the recurrence rate is 30-40% and the febrile status occurs unpredictably and is potentially damaging to the CNS. There is universal agreement that daily prophylaxis with valproate, primidone, or phenobarbital should only be used in highly selected cases, if at all. The effectiveness of phenytoin and carbamazepine has not been documented. Antipyretic treatment does not reduce the recurrence rate. Intermittent diazepam prophylaxis at times of fever may or may not reduce the recurrence rate significantly, but there is no data to suggest that it improves the long-term outcome, as compared with short-term seizure control, in terms of IQ, cognition, academic progress, motor control, and subsequent epilepsy. Acute anticonvulsive treatment with rectal diazepam in solution or other benzodiazepines is effective in aborting recurrent seizures with almost the effectiveness of i.v. treatment and is safe, simple, and easy to use for the parents. The long-term prognosis is probably uninfluenced by the type of treatment given in early childhood. It has not been established that acute anticonvulsive treatment with benzodiazepine is better than placebo.",

Rats received intraperitoneal injections of vehicle, diazepam (2.5 mg/kg), or EMD 68843 (10, 20, or 40 mg/kg) 1 h prior to testing. Diazepam at the single dose tested and EMD 68843 dose-dependently (significantly at 20 and 40 mg/kg) reduced burying in shock-probe.

In rats deprived of food from 9:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., i.c.v. injection of ODN (30 to 100 ng) provoked a dose-dependent reduction of food consumption during the following 12-h nocturnal period. At a dose of 100 ng, ODN almost completely suppressed food intake. Treatment of rats with diazepam (2 mg/kg s.c.; 15 min before ODN administration) did not affect the anorexigenic response evoked by 100 ng ODN. Continuous i.c.v. infusion of ODN (10 ng/h during 15 days) using osmotic minipumps, significantly reduced food intake during the 2nd, 3rd and 4th days of treatment. The decrease in food consumption was associated with a significant reduction in body weight, which persisted during the 15-day duration of the experiment. In mice deprived of food for 18 h, i.c.v. administration of a low dose of ODN (5 ng) significantly reduced food intake. Treatment of mice with diazepam (1 mg/kg s.c.; 10 min before ODN administration) did not prevent the inhibitory effect of ODN (100 ng) on food intake. The C-terminal octapeptide fragment of ODN mimicked the anorexigenic effect of the intact peptide. Taken together, the present data demonstrate that i.c.v. injection of ODN causes, in both rat and mouse, a long-lasting anorexigenic effect that is not mediated through central-type benzodiazepine receptors. The biologically active region of ODN appears to be located in the C-terminal domain of the peptide.",

BR is highly resistant, and BS, highly sensitive to beta-CCM-induced seizures. Tests used included an assessment of general locomotor activity, several situations classically used for measuring fear-motivated behaviors (open field, thigmotaxis, elevated plus-maze, light-dark discrimination, staircase), a test for measuring exploration (holeboard), and a test for measuring nociception (hot-plate). In the absence of beta-CCM, the results provide evidence of reduced motor activity and higher levels of anxiety in the BR line as compared to the BS line.", 
    "169": "Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs), all of which are relatively more potent as serotonin (5-HT)(2A) than dopamine D(2) antagonists, may improve negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, in part, via increasing cortical dopamine release. 5-HT(1A) agonism has been also suggested to contribute to the ability to increase cortical dopamine release. The present study tested the hypothesis that clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and perhaps other atypical APDs, increase dopamine release in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) via 5-HT(1A) receptor activation, as a result of the blockade of 5-HT(2A) and D(2) receptors. M100907 (0.1 mg/kg), a 5-HT(2A) antagonist, significantly increased the ability of both S:(-)-sulpiride (10 mg/kg), a D(2) antagonist devoid of 5-HT(1A) affinity, and R:(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg), a 5-HT(1A) agonist, to increase mPFC dopamine release. These effects of M100907 were abolished by WAY100635 (0.05 mg/kg), a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, which by itself has no effect on mPFC dopamine release. WAY100635 (0.2 mg/kg) also reversed the ability of clozapine (20 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg), risperidone (1 mg/kg), and the R:(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.2 mg/kg) to increase mPFC dopamine release. Clozapine is a direct acting 5-HT(1A) partial agonist, whereas olanzapine and risperidone are not. These results suggest that the atypical APDs via 5-HT(2A) and D(2) receptor blockade, regardless of intrinsic 5-HT(1A) affinity, may promote the ability of 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation to increase mPFC DA release, and provide additional evidence that coadministration of 5-HT(2A) antagonists and typical APDs, which are D(2) antagonists, may facilitate 5-HT(1A) agonist activity.",

This article examines more closely this association. A review of relevant published literature from 1970 to date was undertaken following Medline and Embase searches in June 2000. Hyperglycaemia with clozapine was widely reported: spontaneous reports of either hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis were described in a total of 17 people. In a five-year naturalistic study, 30.5% of patients taking clozapine were eventually diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. With olanzapine, a total of 10 cases of hyperglycaemia and 5 cases of ketoacidosis have been published. Reports of hyperglycaemia with other atypicals are relatively scarce. The association of hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis with clozapine and olanzapine appears to be a true drug-induced effect. Risk factors may include male gender, age of around 40 years and being non-Caucasian. The management of hyperglycaemia depends on the causative agent. With clozapine, treatment with oral hypoglycaemics has been successful. With olanzapine, other atypical antipsychotics may be considered.

These potentially life-threatening phenomena have led to treatment discontinuation and the consequent reemergence of psychiatric symptoms. We report three cases of patients who developed leukopenia during olanzapine treatment. In each case, the leukopenia was dose-dependent. Reduction in the dose of olanzapine was followed by normalization of the white blood count which allowed continuation of the medication. These cases suggest the possibility that, in some patients, leukopenia or agranulocytosis during olanzapine treatment might be dose-related. Thus, olanzapine dose reduction may permit treatment continuation where this is clinically indicated. In our cases, haematological side-effects were satisfactorily controlled by dose reduction without allowing the reemergence of psychiatric symptoms. This clinical management may offer an alternative to treatment suspension. A careful monitoring of the white blood count is obviously recommended. Olanzapine may be considered a potential and safer treatment for a this specific group of patients."
