Eleven healthy men, 20-30 years old, with normal sleep by both subjective and polysomnographic criteria, received each of four treatments in a double-blind Latin Square design (triazolam 0.50 mg for 1, 6, and 12 nights and placebo for 12 nights), followed by two placebo discontinuation nights. Triazolam increased sleep compared with placebo without differences in effects between the first and last nights of treatment. On discontinuation following active drug, sleep efficiency was reduced compared with placebo, but duration of administration did not alter the likelihood or intensity of rebound insomnia. Those subjects (5) showing poorer sleep on discontinuation from the 12-night treatment also had poorer sleep in the 1- and 6-night treatment. Subjects with rebound insomnia had poorer baseline sleep and a greater drug effect than did subjects without.", 
    "1": "The effects of alprazolam and buspirone at varying dosages were compared with placebo in a battery of memory and cognitive tests in a sample of 125 young, healthy medical students by utilizing a single-dose, double-blind design. Although the dosages in this study did not impair visuomotor reaction time in any of the experimental groups, 1.0 mg of alprazolam did result in significantly impaired performance on selective aspects of memory function as assessed by the memory battery.", 
    "2": "We studied the efficacy of propranolol (Inderal) compared to alprazolam (Xanax) in 29 patients with a diagnosis of agoraphobia with panic disorder or panic disorder with or without limited phobic avoidance in a 6-week double-blind controlled experiment. Alprazolam is effective in those syndromes, whereas to date only negative or ambiguous results had been reported for propranolol. Fourteen patients received a mean daily dose of 5.0 +/- 2.3 mg of alprazolam and 15 patients received 182.0 +/- 60.5 mg mean daily dose of propranolol. We found both drugs to be effective to suppress panic attacks and reduce avoidance behavior. The only significant between-drug difference was a more rapid onset of alprazolam's panicolytic effect. Propranolol merits further study. We suggest patients worthy of a clinical trial.", 
    "3": "Pretreatment 24 hr urinary 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) levels and the Depression-type (D-type) scores (derived from a multivariate discriminant function equation based on levels of urinary catecholamines and metabolites) were examined as possible predictors of antidepressant responses to either imipramine or alprazolam. In the case of imipramine, the responders had significantly lower pretreatment urinary MHPG levels (p = 0.002) and D-type scores (p less than 0.001) than did nonresponders. In contrast, responders to the antidepressant effects of alprazolam had significantly higher pretreatment urinary MHPG levels (p less than 0.05) and D-type scores (p = 0.02) than did nonresponders. For each antidepressant treatment, D-type scores appeared to provide a better separation of responders from nonresponders than did urinary MHPG levels. For each drug, the effect size for the difference in mean log-transformed D-type scores between responders and nonresponders was greater than the effect size for the difference in mean log-transformed MHPG levels. The difference between the effect sizes was statistically significant for imipramine (p = 0.02) and tended toward significance for alprazolam using two-tailed tests. These results suggest that the D-type equation, which was initially derived to separate bipolar manic-depressive depressions from other subgroups of depressive disorders, can also be used to predict differential responses to certain antidepressant drugs in patients with unipolar depressions.", 
    "4": "Elective cardioversion is a short procedure performed under general anesthesia for the treatment of cardiac dysrhythmias. Selection of the anesthetic agent is important, because a short duration of action and hemodynamic stability are required. Forty-four patients scheduled for elective cardioversion in the coronary care unit were studied prospectively. All patients were randomly assigned, according to the last digit of their clinical record number, to receive one of the four anesthetic agents studied: group 1, 12 patients who received 3 mg/kg of sodium thiopental; group 2, 10 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg of etomidate; group 3, 12 patients who received 1.5 mg/kg of propofol; and group 4, 10 patients who received 0.15 mg/kg of midazolam. All patients also received 1.5 micrograms/kg of fentanyl 3 minutes before induction. All four drugs provided satisfactory anesthesia for cardioversion and there were no major complications. Midazolam produced a more prolonged duration of effect and more interindividual variability. Propofol was associated with hypotension and a higher incidence of apnea, and its duration of action was similar to that of etomidate or thiopental. Etomidate produced myoclonus and pain on injection; however, it was the only agent that did not decrease arterial blood pressure. Thiopental reduced blood pressure but otherwise seemed an appropriate anesthetic for this procedure. In conclusion, all four anesthetic agents were acceptable for cardioversion, although their pharmacological differences suggest specific indications for individual patients.", 
    "5": "Protein adsorption and subsequent cellular reactions are important biological events at the blood-polymer interface. Mediators like drugs, vitamins, and steroid hormones play a significant role in protein adsorption. An attempt is made to understand the effect of several i.v. agents on protein-platelet interaction with an artificial surface, polycarbonate. Pentothal, an anesthetic; lignocaine, a local anesthetic; pethidine, a narcotic anesthetic; Calmpose, a tranquilizer; and Novalgin, an analgesic, were drugs used for this study. Competitive adsorption of proteins is evaluated using a trace-labeled technique from a mixture of proteins (25 mg/dl of albumin, 15 mg/dl of tau-globulin, and 7.5 mg/dl of fibrinogen). Platelet and lymphocyte adhesion and plasma recalcification time are studied from calf blood. It is observed that these agents modulate the protein and cellular interaction and also the blood coagulation time. Therefore, proper selection of such including agents should not be overlooked for an implant surgery or while ministering to a patient with an implant.", 
    "6": "Musical hallucinations developed in a healthy 57-year-old man after using hypnotic triazolam (Halcion) for eight nights; the hallucinations continued for over one year. Although a causal relationship to triazolam cannot be proved, use of this drug has been associated with other bizarre alterations of memory.", 
    "7": "Although Halcion has received a great deal of attention and scrutiny, Halcion and the other benzodiazepines have a place in the pharmacotherapy of anxiety, panic, and sleep disturbances. Obviously, any physician's prescribing practices are going to be influenced by a variety of factors, including the popular press, to some extent. However, by paying careful attention to prudent and appropriate prescribing practices, following indications and guidelines for safety, efficacy, and patient acceptance, and by prescribing Halcion with the same cautions one would prescribe any other short-acting benzodiazepine or other hypnotic, this medication can be safe, efficacious, and a useful adjunct to the treatment of insomnia. Side effects--even such rare ones as musical hallucinations--will occur, to a greater or lesser extent, as with any medication, but these can be managed by the prudent physician, taking into account the risk/benefit considerations of Halcion, or any benzodiazepine, as a physician would in prescribing any medication for any reason.", 
    "8": "The parasympathetic neurotransmitter acetylcholine, acting postsynaptically at the smooth muscle muscarinic receptor, is a principle determinant of colonic motility. In order to elucidate the receptor signal-transduction events responsible for muscarinic receptor-induced contraction of colonic circular smooth muscle, we present here and in the accompanying work studies designed to characterize the muscarinic receptors present in colon and to determine their biochemical coupling. Muscarinic receptor subtypes in canine colonic circular smooth muscle were characterized using radioligand binding techniques. The nonselective muscarinic receptor antagonist radioligand [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([3H]QNB) binds rapidly and reversibly to a single class of saturable sites in colon circular smooth muscle membranes, with an affinity (KD) for the antagonist radioligand of 79.8 +/- 12.6 pM and a density of 123.3 +/- 18.7 fmol/mg of protein. Experiments using membranes prepared from isolated cells purified from the circular smooth muscle layer of canine colon (KD = 102.4 +/- 13.5 pM) confirm the smooth muscle origin of the binding and yield a receptor density of 124,340 receptors/cell. The order of potencies of selective muscarinic receptor antagonists in competition with [3H]QNB for binding to colonic receptors is 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide greater than methoctramine greater than AF-DX 116 greater than pirenzepine. Unlike other antagonists tested, pirenzepine competition of [3H]QNB binding is biphasic. The high and low affinities deduced from nonlinear fit of the binding data in colon correlate very well with affinities determined for pirenzepine in mixtures of both submandibular gland (M3) and atrium (M2), indicating the presence of two muscarinic receptor subtypes (82% M2, 18% M3) in colon circular smooth muscle. The muscarinic agonist carbachol binds to both high and low affinity sites in colon, and addition of guanine nucleotide (100 microM GTP gamma S) shifts the agonist competition curve to the right, without eliminating high affinity binding sites. Agonist competition studies with a known ratio of M2 and M3 receptors, obtained by mixing pure M2 and M3 populations, predict the result obtained in colon. cDNA probes specific for each of the muscarinic receptors m1 through m4 were hybridized to colon RNA in a Northern blot analysis. Only m2 and m3 probes hybridized to colon RNA, suggesting the presence of both M2 and M3 receptors. Our data demonstrate that the colon circular smooth muscle contains muscarinic receptors of both the M2 and M3 subtypes, which may be coupled to disparate signal transduction pathways important in the physiological actions of acetylcholine in this tissue.", 
    "9": "We present a case of accidental injection of oral methadone and flunitrazepam into the ulnar artery, with resultant severe ischaemia of the hand. Initial therapy consisted of systemic vasodilators, low molecular weight dextran and aspirin. When this therapy failed to produce improvement and amputation of the involved hand seemed inevitable, the patient was referred for hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy. In spite of a 12 day delay in the initiation of HBO, the response was dramatic, with almost complete resolution of the ischaemic signs and symptoms. Intra-arterial injection, which is only rarely encountered in drug addicts, frequently results in severe ischaemia of an extremity, and carries with it a poor prognosis with currently accepted therapy. Given the presently reported experience and the known physiology of HBO, we conclude that HBO should be started early in the treatment of intra-arterial injection of drugs, and should also be considered following prolonged delays.",

    "14": "The concentration-effect relationship of alprazolam plasma concentration and growth hormone changes was studied in six healthy volunteers by use of three different intravenous bolus doses of alprazolam (0.003, 0.007, and 0.02 mg/kg) in a random blind order. There was a linear increase in peak concentration (Cmax) and area under the curve (AUC) of alprazolam with increasing dose (r = 0.96). There was no significant correlation between alprazolam Cmax and effect on growth hormone measured as either maximum increase or maximum percentage change from baseline. There was, however, an overall positive correlation (r = 0.58) between the AUC values of alprazolam and growth hormone from 0 to 120 minutes, although the relative degree of increased AUC of growth hormone with increasing AUC of alprazolam varied greatly across individuals. The difficulties of interpreting the mechanisms underlying differential growth hormone responses even when concentration of stimulus is controlled are discussed.",

Only 41 (31%) of the orthopedists indicated that they inquire about alcohol and drug use before prescribing opiates for more than a week. We offer suggestions for self-education for interested physicians.", 
    "16": "Interactions with the hepatic cytochrome P-450 microsomal enzyme system, as evidenced by statistically significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters, have been described with some H2-receptor antagonists. Omeprazole is the first of a new class of antisecretory agents inhibiting gastric secretion by blocking hydrogen potassium ATPase. Omeprazole contains a benzimidazole moiety and thus has the potential to interact with the cytochrome P-450 enzyme group. In vitro, in vivo and human clinical studies have assessed whether such an interaction occurs, and the potential clinical consequences, in patients receiving omeprazole therapy. In vitro studies have demonstrated that omeprazole influences O-deethylation and N-demethylation in liver microsomes and the clearance and elimination half-life of antipyrine in isolated perfused liver preparations. Overall, the studies reviewed suggest that omeprazole has a differential affinity toward specific cytochrome P-450 isozymes. In vivo animal studies have demonstrated that omeprazole prolongs pentobarbital sleep times and half-life and decreases [14C]-aminopyrine elimination. Human clinical studies have not demonstrated the \"all or none\" effect of omeprazole on cytochrome P-450-mediated drug interactions, as is seen with cimetidine. These studies confirm in vitro findings that omeprazole is a differential inhibitor of drug metabolism: interactions have been demonstrated with the model drugs aminopyrine and antipyrine, and the therapeutic drugs diazepam, phenytoin, and warfarin but not with theophylline or propranolol. Although caution should be exercised when initiating omeprazole therapy in patients taking concomitant diazepam, warfarin, and phenytoin, clinically significant drug interactions appear unlikely.",

    "24": "Flumazenil is a specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated when the central effects of a benzodiazepine need to be attenuated or terminated. Following intravenous administration of up to 1 mg, flumazenil effectively reverses sedation and improves psychomotor performance following administration of short and longer acting benzodiazepines used for sedation, or general anaesthesia supplemented with benzodiazepines. The duration of action is short at generally 30 to 60 minutes and supplemental doses of flumazenil may be needed to maintain the desired level of consciousness in some patients. After poisoning with high dosages of benzodiazepines alone or combined with other drugs, the initial single dose of flumazenil will require supplementing with repeated low intravenous doses or an infusion to maintain wakefulness. In such patients, flumazenil also facilitates differential diagnosis and reduces the necessity for interventions. Flumazenil thus enhances recovery and allows more rapid discharge of patients sedated with benzodiazepines for diagnostic procedures and facilitates management of patients during the initial recovery period following general anaesthesia supplemented with benzodiazepines, but does not preclude normal monitoring during the recovery period. Flumazenil is clearly very useful in treating drug poisoning when benzodiazepines are a major component. By virtue of its specific benzodiazepine antagonist effects, flumazenil provides an innovative and well tolerated approach in clinical situations requiring rapid reversal of benzodiazepine-induced central nervous system depressant effects.", 
    "25": "Considerable evidence suggests that at least some of the effects of ethanol are mediated by an action on the GABAA receptor chloride channel complex. More speculative is the suggestion that ethanol might interact with endogenous ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor on the complex. This paper considers the evidence for such interactions.", 
    "26": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor complex is a hetero-oligomeric protein which contains an integral chloride channel and several modulatory domains. The ligands of benzodiazepine recognition sites can up- or down-regulate the activity of the GABAA receptor. The effects of DBI (diazepam binding inhibitor) on GABAA receptors have been studied in cultured mammalian central neurons. Experiments performed with patch-clamp techniques, as well as with conventional intracellular microelectrodes, have revealed a reversible reduction of GABA-induced responses by micromolar concentrations of DBI. This effect was prevented by Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil), a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. From these data, DBI is capable of reducing the activity of the GABAA receptor complex by specifically interacting with the benzodiazepine recognition site. The idea of DBI being a negative allosteric modulator of GABAA receptor channels is in agreement with biochemical, as well as behavioral, pharmacology data.", 
    "27": "The binding affinities of muscarinic antagonists were compared with their abilities to block carbachol (CCh)-mediated stimulation of Ca2+ mobilization and inhibition of isoproterenol-elicited adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in rat parotid cells. The binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to membranes was inhibited by antagonists with the following potencies (dissociation constant, nM): atropine (1.1) approximately 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methbromide (4-DAMP) (1.6) much greater than pirenzepine (136) greater than 11-[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl]acetyl]-5,11- dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116) (5,293). AF-DX 116 blocked Ca2+ mobilization and inhibition of cAMP accumulation with low affinities [inhibitory concentration at 50% (IC50) = 3150 and 6,528 nM, respectively], whereas 4-DAMP blocked these responses with considerably higher affinities (IC50 = 4.3 and 11.4 nM, respectively). Schild plots of 4-DAMP and AF-DX 116 antagonism of CCh-stimulated inositol trisphosphate accumulation showed inhibitor constant (Ki) values of 0.85 and 1,585 nM, respectively, whereas Schild plots of 4-DAMP, AF-DX 116, and methoctramine antagonism of CCh-induced inhibition of cAMP accumulation showed Ki values of 1.3, 1,585, and 2,754 nM, respectively. Preincubation of cells with 0.1 mM 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine did not prevent the capacity of CCh to inhibit cAMP accumulation. Pertussis toxin blocked the CCh-elicited and Gi-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation. Northern blot analysis showed the presence of mRNA for the M3, but not for the M2, subtype in parotid gland. An immunochemical procedure using m1-m5 specific antibodies was performed in parotid membranes and showed that the m3 receptor accounts for 93% of precipitable receptors. These data suggest that M3 receptors in the rat parotid are coupled to both the stimulation of Ca2+ mobilization and the inhibition of cAMP accumulation.", 
    "28": "The anti-conflict activities of diazepam and buspirone were examined on three schedules designed to condition the suppression of licking. The schedules differed in the degree to which they predicted (signalled) the presentation of a conflict inducing electric shock. The first study investigated the effects of three doses of diazepam (0.5, 2, and 5 mg/kg IP) on a predictable, a moderately predictable, and an unpredictable schedule of shock presentation. Diazepam induced a significant increase from baseline in licking during the shock component on all three schedules. These anticonflict effects were the most consistent on the predictable schedule, and least consistent on the unpredictable schedule. A second experiment investigated the anticonflict activity of three doses of buspirone (0.125, 0.25, and 0.625 mg/kg SC) on each of these three schedules. The predictable and moderately predictable schedules failed to detect anticonflict activity at any dose of buspirone. However, the lowest dose (0.125 mg/kg) of buspirone increased shocked licking and the highest dose (0.625 mg/kg) decreased shock component licking on the unpredictable schedule. Thus the unpredictable schedule was sensitive to both anticonflict (anxiolytic) and proconflict (anxiogenic) effects of buspirone.", 
    "29": "The effects of known anxiolytic agents and putative anxiolytic agents were assessed in mice in a fully automated 2-compartment light/dark test. Significant increases in lit area activities (e.g., time spent in the lit area, locomotor activity, rearing behavior) were used as possible indicators of anxiolytic-like action. The measurement found most consistent and useful for assessing antianxiety-like activity was the time mice spent in the lit area. The benzodiazepine, diazepam; the 5-HT1A agent, ipsapirone; and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, produced significant anxiolytic-like activity between doses of 1.0 to 10.0 mg/kg, 17.8 to 31.6 mg/kg, and 0.0001 to 1.0 mg/kg respectively. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH DPAT, also exhibited anxiolytic-like action between doses of 0.0005 to 3.16 mg/kg. In contrast, the peripheral 5-HT3 receptor agonist, N-phenylbiguanide; the antidepressant, imipramine; the neuroleptic, chlorpromazine; and the CNS stimulant, S(+)-amphetamine, did not display antianxiety-like activity. The positive results obtained for the three types of compounds (benzodiazepine, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT3) indicate that this fully automated light/dark apparatus may be useful for identifying known and putative anxiolytic agents.", 
    "30": "The effect of diazepam on cardiac contractility was investigated in electrically-driven right ventricular strips of the rat. Diazepam produced a concentration-dependent negative inotropic effect which was antagonized by either flumazenil, a benzodiazepine central-type receptor antagonist, or PK 11195, a benzodiazepine peripheral type receptor antagonist. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of diazepam on cardiac contractility in the rat is mediated by both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.",

The urethane-anaesthetized, vagotomised rat preparation was used to investigate the effects of the histamine H2-antagonist ranitidine, the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole and the CCKB/gastrin antagonists CI-988, PD 136450 and L-365,260 on pentagastrin-, histamine- and bethanechol-induced gastric acid secretion. 2. The novel CCKB/gastrin antagonists CI-988 and PD 136450, and L-365,260 dose-dependently inhibited pentagastrin-induced secretion. The ED50 value for PD 136450 was 0.05 mumol kg-1, the same following intravenous or subcutaneous administration. 3. CI-988 and PD 136450 administered subcutaneously at dose levels highly effective for antagonism of pentagastrin responses had no effect on basal acid secretion. 4. Ranitidine inhibited pentagastrin-, bethanechol-, and histamine-induced acid secretion, whereas the CCKB/gastrin antagonists inhibited only the secretory response to pentagastrin. 5. The selective CCKA antagonist, devazepide, was inactive at up to 300 mumol kg-1 i.p. against the three stimulants of acid secretion. 6. CI-988 and PD 136450 will be useful research tools with which to investigate the role of CCKB/gastrin receptors in gastric acid secretion and the trophic activities of gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) on the gastrointestinal tract.", 
    "32": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in humans and animals. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by these agents may be mediated through GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. This proceeding briefly summarizes the evidence presented in our previous review (Yu S and Ho Ik: Alcohol 7: 261, 1990) as to how the GABA system plays a part in the barbiturate actions and the development of tolerance to and physical dependence on barbiturates. The comparisons of the effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines at different steps of GABA synapse are also discussed. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used; (b) brain regions used; (c) protocols (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) used in treating animals and/or (d) techniques (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.) used.",

In a second stage of the investigation, patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire evaluating among other things the consumption of alcohol and the use of benzodiazepines during the last 24 hours before the accident. 81 (20.1%) samples were found to be positive for alcohol, in 34 cases (8.5%) benzodiazepines were detected by urinalysis. 10 samples were positive for both alcohol and benzodiazepines. Subjects positive for alcohol and benzodiazepines presented with significantly more severe injuries than the negative controls. Native accident victims were significantly less frequently positive for alcohol than were subjects from foreign countries. Accidents most commonly occurred early in the afternoon, the positive urine samples, however, were evenly distributed over the whole day. The questionnaire was answered and returned by 76.6% of the study population. 80% of the patients with urine samples positive for alcohol reported having consumed alcohol before the accident, whereas none of those who had been positive for benzodiazepines admitted having ingested tranquilizers.", 
    "34": "Seizures were induced in rats by systemic administration of kainic acid and, 1.5-12 h after, expression of preprosomatostatin and c-fos mRNAs in 9 hippocampal areas and in the cerebral perirhinal cortex was investigated using in situ hybridization histochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was also performed to study somatostatin peptide. In the control animals preprosomatostatin mRNA was expressed in some cells in the dentate hilus, the stratum oriens and the stratum radiatum of Ammon's horn, the subiculum and the cortex. Starting 3 h after kainic acid administration preprosomatostatin mRNA was expressed in a subpopulation of granule and pyramidal cells which did not normally express it. Preprosomatostatin mRNA-positive cells were markedly increased in the subiculum. Immunohistochemical examination confirmed that preprosomatostatin mRNA in granule and pyramidal cells was translated into peptide. In contrast, c-fos mRNA was induced in most hippocampal and cortical neurons starting 1.5 h after the kainic acid injection. When diazepam was injected to suppress the generalized seizures, preprosomatostatin mRNA was still expressed in pyramidal and subicular cells but not in granule cells.", 
    "35": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (pBDZr) were analyzed in lymphocyte membranes from patients with anxiety disorders (generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), n = 15; panic disorder (PD), n = 10; obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), n = 18), other mental disorders (n = 40) and 50 healthy controls, by the specific binding of 3H-PK11195. The number of binding sites (Bmax) was significantly decreased in groups with both GAD and OCD as compared with age-matched controls, by 45% and 25% respectively, whereas the binding affinity (Kd) was the same in all disorder and control groups. Conversely, no changes in binding capacity was observed in the other disorder groups and particularly in the one with PD. The abnormality in pBDZr observed in patients with GAD was restored to a normal value after long-term treatment with 2'-chloro-N-desmethyldiazepam, which also coincided with their recovery from anxiety. Our data suggest that the clinical heterogeneity in anxiety disorders might be related to different biological mechanisms and that lymphocyte pBDZr might be useful in demonstrating these differences.", 
    "36": "Anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics are commonly used drugs. Benzodiazepines have largely replaced barbiturate and non-barbiturate anxiolytics and sedative/hypnotics as they are as effective and safer. Experiments in laboratory animals have shown that chronic administration of benzodiazepines tested to date can induce physical dependence. The severity of the withdrawal syndrome is clearly related to the dose, duration of administration and elimination rate of the drugs. It is now also clear that high doses of barbiturates and benzodiazepines can induce physical dependence in humans. In addition, a withdrawal syndrome after discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine therapeutic treatment, with and without tolerance, has been well characterized. Symptoms may resemble those of anxiety or 'rebound' phenomena but some are typical of withdrawal. A relationship between benzodiazepine discontinuation and self-administration has been well documented. Negative reinforcement associated with a reduction of withdrawal symptoms may play a role supporting persistent benzodiazepine use.", 
    "37": "This paper describes the rationale, practical details, and laboratory lore relevant to conducting an acute dose-effect crossover evaluation for abuse liability of a novel anxiolytic/hypnotic compound relative to a standard compound. Basic principles underlying meaningful abuse liability assessments are presented and illustrated with examples from a comparative evaluation of the hypnotics zolpidem and triazolam. These principles include using a double-blind placebo-controlled design, selecting an appropriate comparison compound, evaluating a wide range of doses including supratherapeutic doses, using subjects with histories of sedative drug abuse, and using a range of dependent measures. The dose-effect crossover evaluation is proposed as a crucial first step in any rigorous drug abuse liability evaluation of a novel anxiolytic or hypnotic drug. Such a study can be expected to generate a broad data base which not only provides a prediction about the likelihood of abuse of the novel compound, but provides an assessment of some of the adverse consequences of recreational abuse. The crossover study also establishes parameters for subsequent studies such as direct assessment of reinforcing effects with drug self-administration testing.",

Metabolic profiles, which were evaluated in urine and in rat bile, were similar following oral and i.v. dosing to rats and dogs. 4. Unchanged drug was not detected in rat, dog or human excreta. Glucuronide conjugates of 4-hydroxyenciprazine, m-desmethylenciprazine, p-desmethylenciprazine and enciprazine were detected in the excreta of all three species. A glycol metabolite was present only in rat bile and human urine. A metabolite desmethylated in the phenyl ring of the phenylpiperazine moiety also appeared to be present only in human urine. 5. Structural confirmation of the major metabolites in human urine and rat bile was accomplished by h.p.l.c.-mass spectrometry.", 
    "39": "After murine fetal cells from the rostral mesencephalic tegmentum were isolated, prepared, and cultured; neuronal and glial cells in primary mixed cell cultures were exposed to ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) at varying concentrations. Studies were performed at 23 days in culture after 14 day exposure to Fe-NTA. In addition to morphologic studies, biochemical assays including specific [3H]flunitrazepam (FLU) binding, clonazepam (CLO)-displaceable [3H]-FLU binding, Ro5-4864-displaceable [3H]-FLU binding, [3H]-FLU binding, [3H]dopamine (DA) uptake, [3H]haloperidol (HAL) binding, [3H]spiperone (SP) binding, glutamine synthetase activity (GS), and protein determinations were performed. The data demonstrate that chelated ferric iron has an adverse effect on these cells. The data also demonstrate that increasing concentrations of Fe-NTA resulted in massive neuronal dropout leaving the culture population virtually all glial; however, the specific binding of [3H]HAL and [3H]SP increased. There was a concomitant decrease in both glutamine synthetase activity and overall protein content. The mechanism of enhancement in the presence of Fe-NTA of [3H]HAL and [3H]SP binding is unknown and may be unique, but may be related to the known increase in D2 receptor ligand affinity in the presence of other multivalent cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+).", 
    "40": "Cimetidine delays the elimination from plasma of those benzodiazepines that are subject to oxidative drug metabolism. An open-label cross-over study was conducted to discover whether cimetidine also changes the plasma level profile of lormetazepam. METHODS. Ten volunteers (5 female, 5 male) took part in the study. After oral administration of 1 mg lormetazepam alone followed by a 6-day washout phase, the subjects received five 200-mg cimetidine tablets at intervals of 6 h (Table 1). The subjects took another 1-mg dose of lormetazepam p.o. together with the last tablet of cimetidine. Blood was sampled at specified intervals after both lormetazepam administrations, and the concentration of the drug in the plasma was determined by means of a specific radioimmunoassay. RESULTS. Cimetidine had no influence on the plasma levels of lormetazepam (Fig. 1). The drug concentrations increased quickly after both treatments regardless of sex and reached their highest values 1-2 h after oral ingestion. half-lives of 30-40 min were determined for the beta-phase and 8-10 h for the terminal elimination phase (Table 2). DISCUSSION. Lormetazepam, over 90% of which is excreted in humans as lormetazepam glucuronide, like oxazepam and lorazepam, does not obviously interact with cimetidine. All other benzodiazepines, which have to undergo oxidation before excretion, interact with drugs that inhibit the microsomal (cytochrome-P-450-dependent) enzyme system. CONCLUSION. In this study, no influence of simultaneous administration of cimetidine--a well-known inhibitor of P-450 dependent drug metabolism--on the pharmacokinetics of lormetazepam in either men or women was observed. This is in agreement with theoretical considerations: due to a 3-hydroxy group, lormetazepam does not require oxidation (hydroxylation) before it is metabolized into a water-soluble form capable of being excreted from the body. Cimetidine is therefore unlikely to potentiate the sedative effect of lormetazepam.", 
    "41": "Molecular and clinical effects of benzodiazepines (BDZs) subsequent to their prenatal and postnatal application to animals and man are reviewed. BDZs interactions with neurotransmitter systems and with metabolic processes are presented and analysed. The experimental data obtained after prenatal application indicate that BDZs can cause malformations, functional deficits and long-lasting behavioural anomalies. The prenatal toxicity of BDZs is probably due to their interaction with neurotransmitter systems. Moreover, a BDZs interaction with mechanisms regulating the excitability of cell membranes and protein synthesis could also play a role. The consequences of prenatal exposition to BDZs in man, particularly their behavioural aspects, have not been sufficiently investigated as yet. Postnatal BDZs application can bring about behavioural disturbances and neurological deficits in animals and man. A part of this pathology can be compensated by means of the functional and structural redundance as well as the tolerance. Limitations in functional and morphological reserves of the nervous system can entail severe disturbances, e.g. cardio-respiratory insufficiency. The pharmacological and toxic BDZs effects could partly be due to their interactions with the same molecular mechanisms. These effects can possibly be mediated through BDZs receptors of the central and peripheral type. Regulatory mechanisms for excitability of cell membranes, cellular energetic processes and protein synthesis seem to be particularly sensitive to the BDZs impacts. A close dosis-effect relation for pharmacological and toxic BDZs effects does not seem to exist.", 
    "42": "In order to firstly evaluate the efficacy of flumazenil in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation because of drug overdose and secondly to register adverse events, 13 patients admitted to the intensive care unit because of drug intoxication, were given flumazenil intravenously to a maximum of 1.0 mg. Sedation state was scored on a modified Glasgow Coma Scale and arterial blood pressure, heart rate and arterial blood gases were recorded before and after flumazenil was given, and every 30 min for 2 h. Results showed that flumazenil reversed the sedation due to benzodiazepines effectively increasing the coma score significantly (P less than 0.005). We found no change in arterial blood pressure (apart from one patient), heart rate or arterial blood gases. Two patients gave further information about drug intake after flumazenil was given. Six patients became resedated, only one needed additional flumazenil. One patient developed a hypertensive crisis after flumazenil was given as a result of the unmasking of an untreated hypertension. Another patient aspirated gastric content to the trachea during resedation and needed respiratory support.", 
    "43": "The platelet-activating factor, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, (PAF) antagonistic activity of thienotriazolodiazepines has recently been described. The lead compound in this series was brotizolam, which also exhibits sedative and hypnotic effects. By combination of brotizolam with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist RO 15-1788, PAF antagonistic and central nervous system (CNS) activities could be segregated. Systematic structure variation has led to potent and selective PAF antagonists without CNS effects. WEB 2086 and its analogues WEB 2170 and STY 2108 are representative examples of this structural type and have shown a high potency and selectivity in PAF-induced and PAF-dependent in vitro tests and in experimental models. Studies in healthy volunteers have demonstrated potent pharmacological activity and good safety and tolerance of oral, intravenous or inhaled WEB 2086 in man. These agents should therefore prove useful for the further elucidation of the pathophysiological role of PAF and provide an opportunity for therapeutic applications in diseases in which the involvement of PAF has been implicated.", 
    "44": "To evaluate the effects of chronic caffeine on the impairment of discriminative fine motor control produced by midazolam, rats were trained to hold a force transducer steady to deliver food pellets. Chronic, daily doses of midazolam (3 mg/kg SC) led to a stable level of motor impairment. Chronic caffeine (20 mg/kg IP) alone usually produced a more moderate deficit or, for one animal, no deficit. Combined, chronic administration of these doses yielded a sustained synergism in motor performance impairment, which contrasted with the antagonism usually found between the benzodiazepines and methylxanthines when performance is evaluated by psychomotor tests not requiring fine motor control. The observed synergism was not explicable in terms of measured disposition of the drugs. The synergistic production of fine motor dyskinesia by the concurrent administration of caffeine and midazolam may be relevant to the triggering of anxiety attacks by caffeine observed in panic disorder patients.", 
    "45": "Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP) is an endogenous substance that regulates the response of the organism to stress. It was found that DSIP, like diazepam and ethanol, activates muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake in the rat brain cortex and partially counteracts the stimulatory action of ethanol on this process. The effect of peptide disappears at the lowering of the incubation temperature. We propose that DSIP is a concordant regulator partly mediating its action through the membrane phospholipids.", 
    "46": "Mouse brain membrane vesicles (microsacs) were transiently permeabilized by hypo-osmotic shock. This permeabilization method resulted in the encapsulation of both [14C]sucrose and exogenous alkaline phosphatase. The efficiency of this method was estimated by [14C]sucrose encapsulation experiments to be approximately 81%. External membrane binding experiments with the lectin [3H]concanavalin A demonstrate that the microsacs were not inverted by permeabilization. Following permeabilization, the functional integrity of a ligand-gated ion channel, the GABAA receptor complex, was investigated. Muscimol-stimulated 36Cl-uptake experiments show that this receptor retains its functional properties including blockade by the receptor antagonist bicuculline and potentiation by the allosteric modulators flunitrazepam and pentobarbital. The osmotic permeabilization technique described here provides several advantages over other permeabilization methods. These advantages include a high trapping efficiency, the encapsulation of not only small solutes but large membrane impermeant compounds such as enzymes and the functional preservation of at least one transmembrane protein. Furthermore, this method does not require specialized equipment and does not result in large, permanent holes in the plasma membrane.", 
    "47": "Since the introduction of treatment by in vitro fertilization/embryo transfer (IVF-ET) in humans, a harmless approach to identifying the ovum with a greater chance of producing an implantable embryo has been sought worldwide. Our previous studies indicated a high correlation between degree of follicular maturation and benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor density in rats. We hypothesized that if such a correlation existed in humans, the latter might be used to evaluate degree of follicular maturation and, consequently, its corresponding oocyte competence. We used [3H]PK 11195, a ligand selective to peripheral BZ receptors, to determine their density in human granulosa-lutein (G-L) cells. [3H]PK 11195 bound to G-L cells with high affinity in a saturable manner. Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of a single population of receptors. The average equilibrium dissociation constant and maximal number of receptors (Bmax) measured in G-L cells were 3.4 +/- 0.2 nM and 608 +/- 61 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In G-L cells obtained from individual follicles, a significant increase in the specific binding to peripheral BZ receptors was noted in G-L cells of follicles yielding oocytes at an advanced stage of cumulus maturation or oocytes competent for fertilization and subsequent cleavage. When G-L cells were pooled from all the follicles of each individual woman, the average Bmax value of [3H]PK 11195 in G-L cells was 900 +/- 127 fmol/mg protein in women who conceived, which was 80% higher (P less than 0.01) than in women who did not conceive.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "48": "Ethopharmacological procedures and a two-compartment black and white test box were used to examine behavioural effects produced by the benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), when given by intraperitoneal injection (0.4 and 1.0 mg/kg) to pair-housed adult CD1 male mice. Control mice received injections of the solvent. Behaviour in the light-dark box was examined at 30 min after the injection and behaviour during encounters with an untreated group-housed male, in a neutral cage, was then assessed by ethological procedures. In dominant mice, aggressive behaviour was significantly reduced and the ratio of flight, relative to aggression received, was significantly increased by DMCM at 0.4 mg/kg. At 1 mg/kg but not 0.4 mg/kg, DMCM decreased time spent by dominant mice in the light compartment of the test box. In both dominant and subordinate mice, flight was increased by DMCM at 1 mg/kg to a level close to statistical significance. Treatment with DMCM had no other detectable effect on the behaviour of subordinate animals. It is suggested that anxiogenic activity of this compound might induce a shift of agonistic behaviour from aggression to \"fear-induced flight\".", 
    "49": "Ethanol possesses anxiolytic and anticonflict effect in low dose, but exhibits consciousness depression in higher serum level. It also has addictive effects on benzodiazepines (BZD) and its mechanism has been thought to be closely related to GABA-BZD receptor complex. Flumazenil is a well-known potent antagonist in benzodiazepine intoxication. It can restore the patients' consciousness in case of BZD overdose in comatose condition. In the treatment of ethanol intoxication, flumazenil has not been well-accepted as an antidote. We report a case of severe ethanol intoxication (serum level: 512 mg/dl) with deep coma. Flumazenil 0.5 mg restored her consciousness 90 mins after antidote had been administrated. According to the literature, improvement of conscious level was not due to decay of serum ethanol level but flumazenil itself, which has potential benefit to the condition of ethanol intoxication. This effect is delayed as compared with its using in BZD overdose.", 
    "50": "Diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) acts in brain by binding to GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors (GBR) and to mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBR). Because DBI acting at MBR, has been shown to be an effector of ACTH-induced steroidogenesis and stress is known to change the level of GBR and MBR, the model of acute noise stress in rats was used to study modifications of DBI and GRB or the content of MBR in various areas of the brain and adrenal gland. It was found that, in the brain of stressed rats, DBI and its processing products (ODN-like immunoreactivity), increased selectively in the hippocampus. This increase in the content of DBI was preceded and followed by a net decrease of GBR and an increase of MBR. Similarly, in adrenal cortex, the content of DBI and MBR increased during the first hour, following acute stress and this increase paralleled the increase in plasma corticosterone. These data suggest that DBI, acting on MBR may regulate steroidogenic function in stress.", 
    "51": "Because diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) and its processing products coexist with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in several axon terminals, DBI immunoreactivity was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of individuals suffering from various neuropsychiatric disorders, that are believe to be associated with abnormalities of GABAergic transmission. Increased amounts of DBI-like immunoreactivity were found in the CSF of patients suffering from severe depression with a severe anxiety component (Barbaccia, Costa, Ferrero, Guidotti, Roy, Sunderland, Pickar, Paul and Goodwin, 1986). Moreover, the amount of DBI and its processing products was found to be increased in the CSF of patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) (Rothstein, McKhann, Guarneri, Barbaccia, Guidotti and Costa, 1989; Guarneri, Berkovich, Guidotti and Costa, 1990). The clinical rating of HE correlated with the extent of the increase in DBI in CSF. Other lines of research suggest that DBI and DBI processing products may be important factors in behavioral adaptation to stress, acting via benzodiazepine (BZD) binding sites, located on mitochondria. DBI and its processing products, ODN and TTN, are present in high concentrations in the hypothalamus and in the amygdala, two areas of the brain that are important in regulating behavioral patterns associated with conflict situations, anxiety and stress. In CSF, the content of DBI changes in association with corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) (Roy, Pickar, Gold, Barbaccia, Guidotti, Costa and Linnoila, 1989). Finally DBI is preferentially concentrated in steroidogenic tissues and cells (adrenal cortical cells, Leydig cells of the testes and glial cells of the brain).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "52": "The rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of steroids is the transport of the substrate cholesterol from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, where cholesterol is metabolized to pregnenolone. This transport is markedly stimulated by the action of hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) for adrenocortical and testicular Leydig cells, respectively. Recently, it was demonstrated that the peripheral-type or mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, abundant in steroidogenic tissues, is involved in the regulation of steroid biosynthesis. In search for an endogenous ligand for mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors, regulating steroidogenesis, the effects of Diazepam Binding Inhibitor (DBI) were studied. The model systems used were the Y-1 adrenocortical and the MA-10 Leydig cell lines, previously shown to be valid steroidogenic models. Both cell lines contain significant levels of immunoreactive DBI. Purified DBI from rat brain, at high nanomolar concentrations, increased formation of pregnenolone, when added to mitochondrial preparations of both cell types; but at concentrations of DBI above 1 microM, a decrease in the stimulation was observed. Flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine which binds to mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors, with high nanomolar affinity, inhibited the stimulatory action of DBI on the formation of mitochondrial pregnenolone, indicating that DBI exerts its stimulatory effects through an action on mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors. In order to determine the biologically active amino acid sequence in the DBI molecule, various fragments of DBI were synthesized and tested; also, peptides structurally unrelated to DBI were tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The distribution of diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), a multi-function peptide which has recently been discovered, was studied in the rat and human central nervous system and in peripheral organs of the rat by light and electron microscopical immunohistochemistry. In the central nervous system, DBI-LI was localized in many glial cells and glial tumors, and in some neurons. In the periphery, DBI-LI was found in many tissues but it was expressed selectively in specialized cell types. Intense DBI-LI was observed in some endocrine, steroid-producing cells such as glomerular cells of the adrenal gland and Leydig cells of the of the testis. Different types of epithelial cells, for instance distal convoluted tabular cells of the kidney and mucosal cells of the small intestine, displayed moderate DBI-LI. Some supporting cells, such as Schwann cells and Sertoli cells, were also immunopositive. The frequent localization of DBI in cells, also known to contain large amounts of mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors, indicates that DBI may play an important role as an endogenous regulator of intracellular metabolic functions via the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor.",

    "55": "Regional differences in neuroactive steroid modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor-chloride ionophore complex (GBRC), as measured by t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate ([35S] TBPS) binding and 36Cl- uptake, were demonstrated in rat spinal cord versus frontal cortex. The rank order of potencies of a series of 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reduced isomers of 3 alpha-hydroxylated steroids against [35S]TBPS binding were different between regions. The differences in rank order of potencies imply the possible existence of heterogeneous populations of GBRC-coupled steroid recognition sites. The relative potencies of selected 5 alpha- and 5 beta-reduced isomers as potentiators of 36Cl- uptake paralleled their potencies as inhibitors of [35S]TBPS binding. Differential sensitivity of the steroid recognition site to the allosteric influence of gamma-aminobutyric acid was also demonstrated. It appears that regionally specific responses to GBRC-active steroids do occur, although the functional consequences of these effects await evaluation in appropriate in vivo models.", 
    "56": "GABA is a putative inhibitory neurotransmitter in adult mammalian visual cortex but also has been implicated as playing a crucial role in cortical information processing during development. In order to understand better the role of GABA during primate visual cortex development, we have examined the time course of GABAA and GABAB receptor ontogenesis in 18 Macaca nemestrina monkeys ranging from fetal day 61 (F61d) to adulthood. The GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites of the GABAA receptor were detected by 3H-muscimol (3H-MS) and 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FZ), respectively. GABAB receptors were detected by 3H-baclofen (3H-BA). All ligands were visualized by in vitro autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of film density was done to compare laminar changes during pre- and postnatal development. Saturation binding experiments were done for MS and FZ binding sites to determine receptor number (Bmax) and affinity (Kd) at selected pre- and postnatal ages. Both MS and FZ binding sites were present at F61d-72d throughout the cortical plate and marginal zone. FZ binding sites were more dense than MS binding sites over the cortical plate at young ages and were especially dense over the marginal zone. FZ binding sites also were present in lesser amounts over the subplate and intermediate zone, but not over the subventricular zone. By F119d-126d, layer 4 could be distinguished by its higher density for both ligands. The basic adult laminar pattern was established for both MS and BZ binding sites by birth (birth = F165d-170d). After birth, MS density increases dramatically in all layers, but layer 4C remains most dense to adulthood. FZ labeling is heavy in both layers 4 and 3 at birth but after 4 weeks after birth (P4 wk) it declines somewhat in the supragranular layers so that layer 4C now predominates. Labeling in layers 5/6 virtually disappears after birth. BA binding sites were present at F126d, at which time layer 4 was slightly lighter than the remainder of striate cortex; this laminar pattern remained basically the same throughout our series to adulthood. Competitive binding of agonist and antagonists for the GABAA receptor showed that MS binding characteristics were similar at F126d and P8.5 years (yr). MS binding site Bmax was about 8% of adult values at F72d, 24% by F126d, and 56% at F152d. Bmax then rose rapidly after birth to peak at P18wk at 169% of adult values, and then declined to P1yr. A second peak of 143% was found around P3.5yr, with adult values reached by P8.5yr.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "57": "The influence of propofol, a new intravenous anesthetic agent, on brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic transmission has been investigated both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, propofol, like benzodiazepines, 1) markedly enhanced 3H-GABA binding in cortical membrane preparations; 2) potentiated muscimol-induced stimulation of 36Cl- uptake in membrane vesicle preparations (the propofol potentiating effect was antagonized by bicuculline); and 3) inhibited 35S-TBPS binding to unwashed membrane preparations from rat cerebral cortex. Finally, propofol failed to displace 3H-flunitrazepam from its binding site, indicating that its site of action in brain is different from that of benzodiazepines. In vivo, the effect of propofol was studied using single-unit recording of the electrical activity of both nondopaminergic neurons in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (PR neurons) and of dopaminergic neurons in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra (DA neurons). PR neurons are known to be inhibited by GABA-mimetic drugs and benzodiazepines, whereas DA neurons are tonically inhibited by PR neurons. The intravenous administration of propofol, in a fat emulsion formulation, produced a brief dose-dependent inhibition of the firing rate of PR neurons. The dose producing 50% inhibition of the firing rate was calculated to be 1.2 +/- 0.1 mg/kg. The inhibitory effect lasted less than 5 min. Repeated injections of propofol reproduced the same inhibitory response, whereas continuous infusion (0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1) produced a persistent inhibition of neuronal firing. The inhibitory effect of propofol on PR neurons was potentiated by diazepam and reversed by picrotoxin and bicuculline but was not influenced by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. These findings suggest that propofol exerts a GABA-mimetic action on PR neurons by acting on a site distinct from the benzodiazepine recognition site. Unlike benzodiazepines, propofol inhibited the firing rate of DA neurons with a potency proportional to its inhibitory effect on PR neurons. The inhibition of DA neurons was reversed by bicuculline and picrotoxin. The results suggest that propofol enhances the inhibitory control over DA neurons by strionigral GABAergic neurons.",

To investigate whether these effects are specific for hepatic encephalopathy or just reflect a nonspecific arousal reaction, various benzodiazepine antagonists like flumazenil or with inverse agonistic properties (Ro 15-4513, Ro 15-3505) were studied in uremic encephalopathy in rats after bilateral ureteral ligation (n = 20) and compared with hepatic encephalopathy caused by thioacetamide-induced acute liver failure (n = 33). As soon as the animals developed clear signs of metabolic encephalopathy, their motor activity was recorded in an animal activity meter for 10 min. Furthermore, a composite score was calculated by grading various behavioral signs from 0 = absent to 3 = apparently normal.

    "59": "To determine whether genetic differences in development of ethanol dependence are related to changes in gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor function, we measured 36Cl- uptake by brain cortical membrane vesicles from withdrawal seizure prone and withdrawal seizure resistant (WSP/WSR) mice treated chronically with ethanol. Muscimol-stimulated chloride flux was not different between WSP and WSR mice before or after ethanol treatment. Also, augmentation of muscimol action by flunitrazepam or inhibition of muscimol action by the inverse agonists Ro 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5a]- [1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) was not different for ethanol-naive WSP and WSR mice. However, chronic ethanol administration enhanced the inhibitory actions of DMCM and Ro 15-4513 on membranes from WSP but not WSR mice. Conversely, chronic ethanol treatment attenuated the action of flunitrazepam on membranes from WSR but not WSP mice, suggesting that the actions of benzodiazepine agonists and inverse agonists are under separate genetic control. These genetic differences in actions of DMCM and Ro 15-4513 indicate that sensitization to benzodiazepine inverse agonists produced by chronic ethanol treatment may be related to development of withdrawal seizures and suggest that differences in the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex represent alleles that have segregated during the selection of the WSP/WSR mice.",

In this study, metabolites of progesterone and deoxycorticosterone, 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha-o1-20-one (3 alpha-OH-DHP) and 5 alpha-pregnan-3 alpha,21-diol-20-one (5 alpha-THDOC), respectively, were tested for anxiolytic effects in N.I.H. Swiss-Webster mice using the light/dark transition, open-field and lick-suppression tests. Similar to the benzodiazepine (BZ) diazepam, 3 alpha-OH-DHP (5-40 mg/kg) and 5 alpha-THDOC (5-40 mg/kg) significantly increased the number of light/dark transitions. 3 alpha-OH-DHP's effects were stereospecific as its diasteriomer, 3 beta-OH-DHP was devoid of activity. The benzodiazepine antagonist CGS-8216 (10 mg/kg) blocked diazepam's (1.0 mg/kg) anxiolytic effects, but did not have any effect against 3 alpha-OH-DHP (20 mg/kg). The data indicate that the pregnane steroids produce their anxiolytic effects through a separate mechanism than the BZs. 3 alpha-OH-DHP (20 mg/kg), 5 alpha-THDOC (20 mg/kg) and diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) increased activity in a open-field test. 3 beta-OH-DHP had no effect in the open-field test. Furthermore, 3 alpha-OH-DHP produced a 235% increase in punished responding in a lick-suppression test.

    "61": "Recent studies have demonstrated that measurement of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites (PTBBS) levels may be useful as an index for quantification of neuronal damage. In the present study, we investigated the accuracy of this index as a marker of neuronal damage induced by transient forebrain ischemia in the rat (4-vessel occlusion model). Seven days after ischemia, a good correlation was found between the increase of PTBBS levels (measured using [3H]PK 11195 as a specific radioligand) in hippocampal, striatal and cortical homogenates and the duration of ischemia. The progression of PTBBS increase was examined from 3 h to 14 days of recirculation. Increase in the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) rather than an effect on the affinity (KD) for the radioligand was found in the 3 brain regions. Treatment of the animals with 1,3 butanediol (BD) prior to ischemia resulted in a neuroprotective effect as assessed by an improved neurological score and histological studies. The protective effect of BD was also correlated with a reduced expression of PTBBS as compared to ischemic animals not treated with the drug. No protective effects, on neurological score or PTBBS level were afforded by MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, R-phenylisopropyladenosine (RPIA), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, or BN 52021, an antagonist of platelet-activating factor (PAF). These results suggest that PTBBS provide a useful marker of neuronal damage in a transient forebrain ischemia model and confirm the beneficial effect on ischemic damage exerted by BD.",

Neuromuscular blocking agents were also used at nearly all the ICUs surveyed; however, most gave these drugs to fewer than 20% of patients experiencing respiratory failure. Orders for the use of sedating drugs and neuromuscular blocking agents were written exclusively by house staff at 65% of the ICUs surveyed.", 
    "65": "Sedating drugs and neuromuscular blocking agents are widely used for patients requiring mechanical ventilation in ICUs at US teaching hospitals. There is considerable variation in the choice, frequency, and method of administration. Given the expense (up to $1000 a day) and the potential hazards to patients of prolonged deep sedation and paralysis, more research is warranted to determine optimal use of these drugs during mechanical ventilation.", 
    "66": "The effect of benzodiazepine and beta-carboline inverse agonists on body temperature in mice was investigated using doses shown to be pro-convulsant in other studies. The benzodiazepine partial inverse agonists Ro 15-3505 (0.1-30 mg/kg i.p.), Ro 15-4513 (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.) and the fuller benzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 19-4603 (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on rectal temperature. Ro 19-4603 (1 mg/kg i.p.) produced a small hypothermic response. In contrast, the beta-carboline partial and full inverse agonists, FG 7142 (30, 60 mg/kg i.p.) and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (3, 10 mg/kg i.p.), produced large decreases in body temperature. These differential effects of benzodiazepine and beta-carboline inverse agonists on body temperature may provide further evidence for the existence of benzodiazepine receptor subtypes.", 
    "67": "A material of 100 patients aged 18-70 years, ASA groups 1-2, who were otherwise healthy with slight generalized sequelae of their illness but without limitations in their usual habits, who were admitted for gastroscopy were randomized to sedation with either diazepam or propofol. Prior to the examination, 0.2 mg/kg diazepam or 1 mg/kg propofol was administered. If necessary, this was supplemented with half of the initial dosage. No difference were found in the sedation. Patients in the propofol group remembered the surgeon's information significantly better and woke significantly more rapidly. Propofol caused significantly more pain on injection. We consider that propofol can be employed for outpatient gastroscopy.", 
    "68": "The beta-carbolines, methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM) and 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) are known to have pharmacological properties opposite to those of agonistic benzodiazepines. Convulsions induced by these drugs lead to differential patterns, such as clonus, myoclonic or tonic seizures. In 10 different inbred strains of mice we investigated whether the responsiveness to the two drugs was the same, irrespective of the pattern of convulsions. We found the same ranking in the responsiveness of the strains to both drugs in the case of myoclonic seizures. No such correlation could be found for clonus or tonic seizures. Our conclusion is that the same genetic factors determine myoclonic seizures, whereas a plurality of mechanisms underly the other patterns. Thus, myoclonic seizures seem to be the most appropriate index for evaluating the convulsant action of beta-carbolines in genetic experiments.", 
    "69": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding site (PTBBS) ligand, PK 11195, is known to be a marker of damage in the central nervous system, the binding being predominantly to macrophages. Using photochemically induced focal cortical ischaemia as a lesion model in the rat, we have investigated the detection of secondary lesions using [3H]PK 11195 and ex vivo autoradiography. Secondary lesions in the thalamus became apparent during the second week post-lesioning, at a time when [3H]PK 11195 binding around the primary lesion was beginning to subside. Using Brain Browser software, the identity of the labelled thalamic nucleus was confirmed, objectively, as the ventrolateral nucleus, known to have reciprocal connections with the lesioned cortical area. As with the primary lesion, high densities of PTBBS correlated with infiltration of macrophages. Three-dimensional reconstruction of [3H]PK 11195 autoradiograph images showed binding along white matter tracts between the primary and secondary lesions. We conclude that radiolabelled PK 11195 given in vivo can be used in the visualisation of secondary lesions and their associated degenerating tracts.", 
    "70": "Mammalian pinealocytes possess synaptic ribbons (SR) which are commonly present in photoreceptor cells at synaptic junctions. Pineal SR numbers undergo a diurnal rhythm parallel to that of pineal N-acetyltransferase (NAT) activity and melatonin levels. Recent findings suggest that SR numbers, unlike NAT activity and melatonin synthesis and release, do not seem to be regulated by adrenergic mechanisms or neuropeptides in adult rats. Since the pineal gland also receives cholinergic nerve fibres, we have investigated in vitro effects of acetylcholine (ACh) and carbamyl-beta-methylcholine (CBMC; a specific muscarinic agonist) in the presence and absence of pirenzipine (a specific inhibitor of muscarinic M1 receptors). ACh and CBMC increased SR numbers significantly. Pirenzipine inhibited the CBMC-induced increase in SR numbers. On the basis of these findings, it is suggested that cholinergic agonists increase pineal SR numbers by acting through muscarinic M1 receptors. Hence muscarinic mechanisms may have a functional role in pineal physiology.", 
    "71": "Multiple intrahippocampal injections of gallamine impair performance of a representational memory task in rats. The binding of [3H]-(-)-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) to rat brain sections was measured to determine if changes in receptor binding were associated with the deleterious effects of gallamine. [3H]-(-)-QNB binding to sections taken from gallamine-injected animals was compared with binding in saline-injected control animals. Autoradiographic analyses indicated an increase in [3H]-(-)-QNB binding sites within all layers of the cerebral cortex and in the superior colliculus in gallamine-treated animals as compared to saline-injected controls. Significant increases were noted in cortical layers IV and V (P less than 0.025) in gallamine-treated animals. No significant changes (P greater than 0.05) in the number of binding sites were observed in the hippocampus, neostriatum or various thalamic nuclei. The ability of unlabeled pirenzepine, gallamine and carbamylcholine to inhibit 0.2 nM [3H]-(-)-QNB binding also was measured to determine changes in the distribution of receptor subtypes. No significant changes were observed in any brain region for the binding of the selective antagonists pirenzepine and gallamine or the agonist carbamyl-choline. Although other possibilities are considered, the data suggest that an increase in the number of muscarinic receptors may contribute to the observed behavioral deficits associated with long-term gallamine treatment.", 
    "72": "The gamma 3-subunit of the GABAA-receptor in rat brain has been identified by molecular cloning. When co-expressed with the alpha 5- and beta 2-subunits in transfected cells a high potency for GABA (Ka = 4.9 +/- 1.2 microM) and a strong cooperativity in gating the channel (H = 1.9 +/- 0.2) was observed. The GABA response was potentiated in the presence of flunitrazepam and reduced by beta CCM. An analogous bi-directional modulation of the GABA response was observed with diazepam and DMCM as tested with the subunit combinations alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 3 and alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Since the benzodiazepine receptor ligands were virtually inactive in the absence of the gamma 3-subunit, as tested with the alpha 3 beta 2- and alpha 5 beta 2-subunit combinations, the gamma 3-subunit is a prerequisite for the benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity of the expressed GABAA-receptors. The gamma 3-subunit could functionally replace the gamma 2-subunit with regard to the bi-directional allosteric drug modulation.", 
    "73": "Naltrexone is a pure narcotic antagonist with optimum pharmacologic properties for the long-term management of opiate addiction. The above study confirms the usefulness of naltrexone for the prevention of relapse in subjects who have been weaned from narcotics. However, the short follow up does not yet permit evaluation of its medium and long-term efficacy. The better course and outcome of treatment are significantly related to certain characteristics and types of addicts. It may be said that by assuring complete, albeit time-limited, remission the antagonist allows the addict to open a window through which to face the world, and offers the therapist the possibility to apply all the instruments at his disposal in an effective manner.", 
    "74": "A rapid, sensitive and selective assay of midazolam and two of its metabolites in plasma, based on high-performance liquid chromatography, has been developed. The compounds are subjected to solid-phase extraction, using C18 cartridges (Bond-Elut). Recoveries are in excess of 90% for midazolam and its metabolites. The limit of quantitation of the assay is 50 ng/ml of plasma for each compound.", 
    "75": "In the central nervous system brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) are predominantly located in neurons. Here we demonstrate that the balance between the activity of the glutamatergic and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic systems controls the physiological levels of BDNF and NGF mRNAs in hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. The blockade of the glutamate receptors and/or stimulation of the GABAergic system reduces BDNF and NGF mRNAs in hippocampus and NGF protein in hippocampus and septum. The reduction of NGF in the septum reflects the diminished availability of NGF in the projection field of NGF-dependent septal cholinergic neurons. These neurons do not synthesize NGF themselves but accumulate it by retrograde axonal transport. The refined and rapid regulation of BDNF and NGF synthesis by the glutamate and GABA transmitter systems suggests that BDNF and NGF might be involved in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity.",

    "78": "the 531 self poisonings represented 1% of attendances with peak demand on emergency services during the evenings. Sixty-four percent were admitted accounting for 16.5% of ICU admissions and 8.5% of acute medical admissions with a mean hospital stay of two days. Only 5% of patients suffered complications, despite the potential seriousness of many events, with an overall mortality rate of 0.5%. The self poisoning rate in Christchurch is currently 20 per 10,000 population. The most frequently involved drugs were benzodiazepines (23%), tricyclic antidepressants (16%) and paracetamol (11%). There were no barbiturate poisonings and no deaths due to tricyclic antidepressants despite their prevalence amongst admissions. All beta blocker poisonings required ICU admission and one death resulted.", 
    "79": "self poisoning is an activity associated with a low morbidity and mortality that remains a resource consuming problem, even in postbarbiturate times. It is infrequently seen acutely by general practitioners however it is a condition that needs greater awareness as prescribed drugs are usually involved. The tricyclic antidepressants and the beta blockers are of relatively greater importance in utilising ICU services.", 
    "80": "To examine muscarinic receptor subtypes involved in cholinergically mediated contractions of the airway, we studied the effects of the M1-selective antagonist, pirenzepine, the M2-selective antagonist, AF-DX 116, the M3-selective antagonist, 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) methiodide, and the non-selective antagonist, atropine, on acetylcholine (ACh)- and electrically induced contractions in dog bronchi and bronchioles. The relative potencies of the antagonists based on IC50 values of each antagonist for contractions induced by the two concentrations of ACh that produced 50% of the maximum (ED50) and the maximum (EDmax) contractions and the pA2 values were atropine greater than or equal to 4-DAMP methiodide greater than pirenzepine = AF-DX 116 in both the bronchi and bronchioles. The IC50 and pA2 values of each antagonist did not differ significantly between the bronchi and bronchioles. 4-DAMP methiodide significantly inhibited the contractile response to electrical field stimulation (EFS) at 5 Hz at concentrations that did not alter the contractile responses to exogenous ACh in both the bronchi and bronchioles, whereas pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and atropine inhibited the EFS-induced contraction only at the concentrations that reduced the contraction induced by exogenous ACh. The present results suggest that the cholinergic contraction is mediated via the postsynaptic receptor M3, based on functional potencies of muscarinic antagonists and presynaptic receptor auto-facilitatory M3, based on the suppression of the contractile response to EFS by 4-DAMP methiodide in central and peripheral airways.", 
    "81": "Treatment of rat brain slices with veratrine and monensin decreased (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity in the membranes in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of monensin, like that of veratrine, was accompanied by a decrease of maximal binding sites for ouabain. The inhibitory effect of monensin on the enzyme activity was dependent on external Ca2+ at low concentrations, but not at a high concentration. The decreased enzyme activity induced by monensin was restored by subsequent incubation of the slices in a Ca(2+)-free medium containing 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), a chelator of intracellular Ca2+. The effect of monensin at a low concentration on enzyme activity was antagonized by amiloride (1 mM), bepridil (5 microM), quinacrine (30 microM) or verapamil (30 microM), but not by nifedipine (1 microM) or omega-conotoxin (1 microM). Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of monensin at a high concentration under Ca(2+)-free conditions was blocked by BAPTA-AM (30 microM) and by bepridil (100 microM) or diazepam (500 microM), inhibitors of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange. Inhibitors of calmodulin, protein kinase C, phospholipase A2 and calpain did not affect the monensin-induced decrease of enzyme activity. Dithiothreitol (10 mM) blocked the effect of monensin on enzyme activity but did not affect the ionophore-induced influx of Ca2+ in the slices.", 
    "82": "The mechanisms of muscarinic receptor-linked increase in cAMP accumulation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells has been investigated. The dose-response relations of carbachol-induced cAMP synthesis and carbachol-induced rise in intracellular free Ca2+ were similar. The stimulated cAMP synthesis was inhibited by about 50% when cells were entrapped with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA or in the presence of the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor staurosporine. Production of cAMP could be induced also by the Ca2+ ionophore, ionomycin and by TPA, an activator of PKC. When added together TPA and ionomycin had a synergistic effect. When cAMP synthesis was activated with cholera toxin, PGE1 or PGE1 + pertussis toxin carbachol stimulated cAMP production to the same extent as in control cells. Ca2+ and protein kinase C thus seem to be the mediators of muscarinic-receptor linked cAMP synthesis by a direct action on adenylate cyclase.", 
    "83": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors have been identified in brain and are predominantly localized to astrocytes. To determine their potential role in controlling astroglial proliferation, DNA synthesis, growth curves and mitotic index were investigated in primary astrocyte cultures which had been exposed to Ro5-4864 (a peripheral-type BZD ligand) and PK11195 (a peripheral-type BZD receptor antagonist). There was a dose-dependent inhibition of mitosis when two-week-old cells in culture were exposed to 50 nM, 500 nM, 1 microM and 10 microM Ro5-4864 for 24 h. Exposure of 5-, 8-, 12- and 15-day-old cultures to Ro5-4864 and PK11195 for 24 h did not affect growth rate and DNA synthesis; however, continuous exposure to 10 microM Ro5-4864 caused a persistent inhibition of cell growth and [3H]thymidine incorporation (P less than 0.05) while nanomolar concentrations did not cause any significant change. Concurrent administration of Ro5-4864 with PK11195 resulted in a partial reversal of Ro5-4864-induced inhibition in DNA synthesis and mitosis. These results indicate that peripheral-type BZDs are capable of inhibiting proliferation of astrocytes in culture.",

The optimum conditions for determining this drug (0.4-4.0 mug/ml) are described. The relative standard deviation achieved is 1.7%.

    "89": "Rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus properties of the selective 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.4mg/kg i.p.) versus saline, using a discriminated taste aversion procedure. Tests of stimulus generalization and drug substitution were conducted using two-bottle choice tests between saccharin and water. Rats that received pairings of 8-OH-DPAT with LiCl demonstrated significant reductions of saccharin preference when administered 8-OH-DPAT at doses of 0.1mg/kg or higher. 8-OH-DPAT did not alter saccharin preference significantly in controls that did not receive LiCl injections. Other drugs with high affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors, such as the azapirones gepirone, ipsapirone and buspirone, produced selective reductions of saccharin preference in rats trained to discriminate 8-OH-DPAT from saline but not in controls. Three drugs with low affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors, the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam, d-amphetamine, and a common metabolite of the azapirones 1-(2-pyrimidinyl) piperazine (1-PP) altered fluid intake significantly but failed to produce significant changes in saccharin preference in either the discrimination or control groups. This study indicates that two-bottle preference tests can be used to measure the stimulus properties of 8-OH-DPAT trained using a discriminated taste aversion procedure, because the stimulus effects of drugs, measured using saccharin preference, can be separated from the nonspecific effects of drugs on fluid consumption.", 
    "90": "In the first paper of this series a new structure with anti-HIV-1 activity was disclosed and analogues were synthesized to explore the structure-activity relationship of changes in the substituent (R) attached at the N-6 position of 9. This study describes the syntheses and anti-HIV-1 testing of analogues with variations of the five-membered urea ring of the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-5-methylimidazo[4,5,1-jk] [1,4]benzodiazepin-2(1H)-one (TIBO) structures. Although many different rings were synthesized to replace the cyclic urea of TIBO, most were found to be inactive in inhibiting the replication of the HIV-1 virus in MT-4 cells. The exceptions were replacement of the urea oxygen with sulfur or selenium to give the corresponding thio- or selenoureas. These were found to be more active than the oxygen counterparts. A small series of analogues was synthesized and tested which allowed direct comparison of urea and thiourea derivatives. Without exception, the latter were always more active than the former. The most active compound of this series (8d) was found to inhibit the HIV-1 virus with an IC50 of 0.012 microM which is comparable to that of AZT.", 
    "91": "High dose metoclopramide and adjuvant drugs, such as corticosteroids, benzodiazepines, and drugs with antidopaminergic, anticholinergic, or antihistaminic effects, are the most widely used antiemetics in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, particularly cis-dichloro-diammine platinum II (cisplatin). The purpose of our prospective randomized study was to investigate the possible antiemetic efficacy of diphenhydramine as an adjuvant antiemetic drug when combined with metoclopramide (MCP). A total of 91 patients were assigned to either group A (N = 44) who received only MCP and group B (N = 47) who received the combination of MCP and diphenhydramine. All patients received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for the first time and were evaluated only once in order to exclude the effects of anticipatory nausea and vomiting. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups except that patients treated with diphenhydramine presented more sedative effects and had more limited activity. Also diphenhydramine did not give absolute protection from the extrapyramidal side effects of MCP. Side effects of diphenhydramine were minimal and well tolerated. We conclude that diphenhydramine is not a useful adjuvant drug in the antiemetic therapy.",

Two placebos and an active control drug, oxazepam (15 mg), were included. Medication was administered double-blind at 10.00 h. The effects of drugs on performance and subjective feelings were assessed before and from 1.5-2.5 h and 3.5-4.5 h after ingestion, and recordings of the electrical activity of the brain (EEG) and body sway carried out. 2. Performance was assessed using digit symbol substitution, continuous attention, letter cancellation, choice reaction time, finger tapping, immediate and short-term memory, together with critical flicker fusion and two flash fusion. The EEG was recorded with eyes open while the subjects carried out a mental arithmetic task, and with eyes closed, when they were required to relax. Body sway was recorded with eyes open and with eyes closed. Subjects assessed their mood and well-being on a series of 12 visual analogue scales. 3. Nifedipine did not alter performance levels on any of the skills tested, while oxazepam (15 mg) increased the number of errors (P less than 0.01) and reduced accuracy at continuous attention (P less than 0.01). 4. Nifedipine (10 mg) reduced total power of the EEG in the frequency range (0.5-30 Hz), and nifedipine (20 mg) increased total alpha power (7.5-13 Hz) (P less than 0.05).

    "94": "To elucidate the delayed effects of midazolam, we assessed electrophysiologic and motor responses by measuring auditory event-related potentials and a button-press reaction time response in 10 normal volunteers (aged 25-36 yr). Fifty minutes after intravenous infusion of 0.07 mg/kg of midazolam, subjects were mildly sedated, oriented, and readily responsive to verbal commands. To obtain ERPs, frequent tones (85%: 1000 Hz) and rare tones (15%: 2500 Hz) were presented at intervals of 1.5 s. Electroencephalographic signals were collected from FZ, CZ, and PZ for 1000 ms after stimulus presentation until 40 artifact-free rare-tone responses were obtained (average time, 6 min). Peak-to-peak amplitudes and latencies for N2, P3, and the subsequent negative slow wave (N3) were averaged within condition and were analyzed by repeated measures analysis of variance. After midazolam infusion, there was a 50% decrease in amplitude of P3 in response to target tones (P less than 0.006), whereas N3 latency increased by 40 ms (P less than 0.05). Event-related potential amplitudes were still significantly larger to rare (target) stimuli (P less than 0.003) after midazolam infusion. Although reaction time increased by 70 ms (P = 0.031), performance accuracy remained unchanged. Self-ratings of sleepiness and concentration show that a significant sedation effect was still present 50 min after infusion. Although routine clinical examination may be normal, full recovery from the effects of a typical intravenous dose of midazolam requires more than 50 min. The potential for adverse drug interaction, particularly with narcotics, is still present at this time.", 
    "95": "Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with aortic cross-clamping represents a controlled period of global cardiac ischemia. We hypothesized that CPB (asanguineous prime), with aortic cross-clamping and repeated cardioplegia, alters myocardial function, which would be manifested as an exaggerated myocardial depression caused by halothane after CPB. In nine dogs anesthetized with fentanyl and midazolam, halothane dose-response curves (0.0%-2.0%) were compared before and after CPB. A reduced mean arterial blood pressure (46.4 +/- 3.7 vs 85.8 +/- 5.9 mm Hg), associated with a marked hemodilution (hematocrit, 19% +/- 1% vs 41% +/- 2%), was observed after CPB. Cardiac output and systolic shortening were not significantly different after versus before CPB during fentanyl-midazolam anesthesia. Normalized to fentanyl-midazolam hemodynamics, halothane dose-response curves before and after CPB were identical for all variables except cardiac output, where halothane caused a slight but statistically significantly more pronounced decrease after CPB compared with before CPB. The effect of halothane on left ventricular function, therefore, is relatively unaffected by CPB with cardioplegia.", 
    "96": "We have proposed that cholecystokinin's (CCK) inhibition of gastric emptying contributes to its ability to inhibit food intake. To directly test this hypothesis in rats, the effect of the presence of a 5-ml gastric saline load on the ability of a long-acting cholecystokinin analogue U-67827E (0.1-10.0 nmol/kg) to inhibit intake of a 0.5 kcal/ml glucose solution was measured. The CCK analogue alone inhibited intake at a threshold dose of 2.5 nmol/kg. Although lower doses of the CCK analogue alone had no effect on subsequent glucose intake, when combined with the gastric load such doses did significantly inhibit intake. Thus the presence of a gastric load reduced the threshold dose of the CCK analogue required to inhibit intake. Furthermore, at suprathreshold doses, the peptide-load combination suppressed intake more than the peptide alone. In addition, administration of 0.5 and 5.0 nmol/kg doses of the CCK analogue inhibited gastric emptying at 10, 20, and 30 min in a dose-dependent fashion. The CCK analogue's inhibition of food intake and gastric emptying were reversed by pretreatment with 100 micrograms/kg L364,718, indicating that the analogue was having its effects by interacting with specific type A CCK receptors. Together these data support the notion that CCK satiety derives from an integration of the visceral afferent signals generated by CCK's promotion of gastric distension and those produced directly by CCK.", 
    "97": "Experiments were conducted in golden hamsters to examine the relationship between induced acute increases in locomotor activity and phase shifts in the circadian clock underlying the rhythm of activity. Injections of the short-acting benzodiazepine triazolam (TZ) 6 h before the onset of activity resulted in an acute increase in activity and a phase advance in the rhythm of activity; injections of TZ induced larger phase shifts in animals housed without running wheels than in those housed with wheels. Transfer to a cage with access to a running wheel for 1 h at different circadian times induced large phase advances (mean of 2 h) and small phase delays depending on the circadian time of transfer. Maximal mean phase advances resulted when animals were transferred to a cage with wheel 3 h before activity onset, and at this circadian time there was a significant correlation between the magnitude of the phase shift and the amount of increase over baseline activity for the first hour after transfer. These results indicate that access to a running wheel in animals housed without wheels can be a significant phase-shifting stimulus to the circadian clock and that the phase shifts induced by injection of TZ or transfer to a new cage with wheel are related to the activity state of the animal or to the amount of locomotor activity that is induced at particular times.", 
    "98": "In rat olfactory bulb, stimulation of muscarinic receptors activates adenylate cyclase. In the present study we have examined a variety of muscarinic receptor stimulants to characterize the agonist profile of this response. Analysis of agonist concentration-response curves revealed the following rank order of potency: oxotremorine-M greater than oxotremorine greater than BM5 greater than acetylcholine greater than carbachol = methacholine greater than (+/-)muscarine greater than arecoline greater than pilocarpine greater than RS 86 greater than McN-A-343 greater than bethanechol. Acetylcholine, oxotremorine-M, carbachol, (+/-)muscarine and metacholine behaved as full agonists, whereas the other stimulants displayed lower efficacies. The slope values of the concentration-response curves were close or equal to 1, except those of the carbachol and pilocarpine curves, which showed values significantly lower than 1. Moreover, the slope of the pilocarpine curve was differentially changed by the M1 antagonist pirenzepine and the M2 antagonist AF-DX 116. The agonist profile of the muscarinic stimulation of adenylate cyclase in the olfactory bulb correlated well with that exhibited by the muscarinic inhibition of the enzyme activity in the striatum, suggesting that the two responses are mediated by a similar receptor subtype. Sodium ion modulated the agonist affinity for both adenylate cyclase-coupled receptor systems.",

There were uniform classes of sites for the radioligand in the M2-rich tissues, heart (Kd = 2.3 nM) and brainstem (Kd = 2.4 nM). However, [3H]AF-DX 384 bound to all four cloned receptor subtypes. Using kinetic methods, the calculated Kd values were M2 (1 nm) greater than M4 (2.2 nM) greater than M3 (15 nM) greater than M1 (55 nM). Scatchard analysis with the CHO cells confirmed the high affinity of this radioligand for the M2 (1.8 nM) and M4 (2.5 nM) receptors. To evaluate the potential for selectively binding to M2 and M4 receptors in cortex and striatum, low concentrations (0.5-0.8 nM) of the radioligand were used and a two-site competition model was used to derive the binding constants for pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 [(+-)-11-2((-((diethylamino) methyl)-1-piperidinyl)acetyl)-5,11-dihydro-6H- pyrido(2,3-b)(1,4)-benzodiazepine-6-one] and to compare them with values obtained with cloned M2 and M4 receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "100": "The development of methods for production of a radiotracer for use in human studies with positron emission tomography (PET) is often a time-consuming process of optimizing radiolabelling yields and handling procedures. Sometimes the radiotracer is not the original drug, but rather a derivative with unknown in vivo pharmacological properties. We have developed a fast and simple method of testing putative new PET tracers in vivo in small animals. The procedure has been validated in rats with different PET tracers with known kinetic and pharmacological properties ([2-18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose, [N-methyl-11C]Ro 15-1788, and [15O]butanol). The tracer concentration in arterial blood was continuously measured to obtain the brain input function. Following image reconstruction of the scans, time-activity curves of selected regions of interest were generated. Estimations of CMRglc (1.0 +/- 0.2 mumol g-1 min-1), CBF (1.4 +/- 0.4 ml g-1 min-1) and transport rate constants for [N-methyl-11C]Ro 15-1788 (K1 = 0.44 +/- 0.01 ml g-1 min-1 and k2 = 0.099 +/- 0.005 min-1) as well as calculated first pass extraction (0.32 +/- 0.1) are in reasonable agreement with literature values. Small animal studies require minimal amounts of radioactivity and can be performed without sterility and toxicology tests. They may serve as a preliminary basis for radiation safety calculations because whole body scans can be performed even with a head scanner.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "101": "Cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors are currently divided into at least two subtypes: a CCK-A subtype, responsive to the sulfated form of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) and selectively antagonized by L-364,718, and a CCK-B subtype, which shares equal affinities for gastrin and CCK-8. In the present study the receptor subtype that mediates guinea pig ileal secretion by evaluating the potencies of CCK- and gastrin-related peptides to evoke increases in transmucosal short-circuit current was characterized. The antagonist potencies of L-365,260 (CCK-B selective) and L-364,718 (CCK-A selective) against CCK-8 were also determined. Both CCK-8 and cerulein, when added to the serosal side of the tissue, evoked increases in the short-circuit current, having EC50 values of 0.8 and 0.2 nmol/L, respectively. Desulfated (SO3) CCK-8, CCK-4, gastrin17-I, pentagastrin, gastrin17-II, and gastrin13-I were relatively weak agonists (EC50 greater than 1000 nmol/L. Cholecystokinin octapeptide-induced short-current responses were competitively antagonized by L-364,718 (pA2, 10.3) and L-365,260 (pA2, 7.4). The high selectivity of the tissue for sulfated CCK-8 suggests that the secretory effect of CCK-8 on guinea pig ileal electrolyte transport is mediated by a CCK-A receptor. The potent effect of L-364,718 against CCK-8 is also consistent with an action at the A-subtype receptor."
