    "0": "Seven benzodiazepine-receptor ligands of the beta-carbolines' group were administered IP in Wistar rats from (1) a strain displaying spontaneous petit mal-like seizures (PMLS) characterized by spike and wave discharges (SWD) and, (2) a strain where no seizure is ever observed (NS). Five different types of effects were observed. (1) Injection of a full agonist (ZK 93 423) suppressed SWD in PMLS rats, in a dose-dependent manner, and induced marked sedation with alteration of EEG background activity; (2) Injection of partial agonists (ZK 95 962, ZK 91 296) suppressed SWD in PMLS rats without sedation; (3) Injection of low doses of a full inverse agonist (DMCM) significantly increased the total duration of SWD in PMLS rats and induced SWD in NS rats. Higher doses of DMCM induced convulsions in both strains; (4) Injection of partial inverse agonists (FG 7142, ZK 90 886) aggravated SWD in PMLS and induced SWD in NS rats. FG 7142 induced convulsions only in PMLS animals, whereas no convulsions were ever observed with ZK 90 886; (5) Injection of an antagonist (ZK 93 426) did not significantly modify SWD in PMLS rats. However, this compound was able to reverse both antiepileptic effects of agonists and epileptogenic effects of inverse agonists. These results suggest the involvement of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor complex in the control of petit mal-like seizures in rats.", 
    "1": "The anticonvulsant activity of N-[beta-[4-beta-phenylethyl)phenyl]-beta-hydroxyethyl]-imidazole hydrochloride, denzimol, was studied following intraperitoneal administration in DBA/2 mice (seizures induced by sound). Protection against sound-induced seizures was observed after intraperitoneal administration of denzimol (3-15 mg/kg). The ED50 values for the suppression of tonic, clonic and wild running phases of sound-induced seizures were 1.24, 2.61 and 6.03 mg/kg, respectively. This protective action was significantly reduced by pretreatment with aminophylline (25 mg/kg i.p.), CGS 8216 (1 or 5 mg/kg i.p.) and Ro 15-1788 (2.5 mg/kg i.p). The present experiments suggest an involvement of purinergic and benzodiazepine mechanisms in the anticonvulsant action of denzimol.", 
    "2": "Doses of benzodiazepine, clorazepate, and also of the inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, beta-CCM, which failed to present sedative or postictal depressive effects, were at first determined in a free exploratory situation. Then, the effects of clorazepate dosed at 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg and beta-CCM dosed at 1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg were studied in the light/dark box choice procedure. Clorazepate tended to produce an increase of the time spent by mice in the lit box as well as of the number of transitions between the two boxes, whereas the dose of 1.0 mg/kg of beta-CCM had opposite effects. The benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788 completely counteracted the anxiolytic effects of clorazepate dosed at 2.0 mg/kg and the anxiogenic effects of beta-CCM.", 
    "3": "The binding properties of the putative M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine (PZ) to muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) embedded in membranes and freed by solubilization with digitonin have been studied in the rat forebrain and heart. In the forebrain membranes, the k+1 and k-1 of [3H]PZ binding was 7.05 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 1.84 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 3.34 nM), respectively, whereas those in heart membranes were estimated to be 1.21 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 7.46 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 66 nM) by an indirect method. After solubilization, the kinetic parameters were determined as 3.17 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 2.23 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 7.16 nM) in the forebrain and 2.41 X 10(5) min-1 M-1 and 1.41 X 10(-3) min-1 (Kd = 6.35 nM) in the heart. Similar dissociation constants were obtained from equilibrium saturation binding studies of [3H]PZ. Both high and low affinity binding sites for PZ were found in the forebrain membranes, whereas only one low affinity site was detected in the heart membranes. After solubilization, the inhibition curves in both tissues were better fitted to a one-site model with similar Ki values. The affinity of the agonist carbachol was decreased greatly in the heart and decreased slightly in the forebrain after solubilization to IC50 values that were similar in both tissues. Although 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate was able to reduce the affinity of carbachol for membrane bound mAChR and to increase slightly the binding of (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate it had no effect on ligand binding to the solubilized mAChR. The affinities of classic antagonists (-)-[3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate and atropine were not altered significantly by solubilization. Our results suggest that several different factors appear to be involved in the association and dissociation processes of PZ binding to the putative M1 (in forebrain) and M2 (in heart) mAChR in membranes. Most of these factors were separated from the receptors by solubilization under our conditions.", 
    "4": "Clobazam was compared with placebo as antiepileptic adjunct medication in 129 therapy-resistant epileptic patients who were mainly suffering from complex partial seizures. The study was performed in five European countries according to a double-blind crossover design lasting 7 months. Two treatment periods of 3 months (1 month adjustment and 2 months maintenance medication) were separated by one medication switch-over month. The difference in seizure reduction between clobazam and placebo was significant (p less than 0.05). Nineteen percent of patients receiving clobazam became seizure-free during the maintenance dose period. In contrast, freedom from seizures was not observed in any placebo patient. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signs, mood ratings, and global impressions also indicated therapeutic effects of clobazam in epilepsy. The most frequent adverse reactions to clobazam were drowsiness and dizziness. However, the sedative effects of clobazam seemed to be less pronounced in comparison with other benzodiazepines. The study gives evidence of the therapeutic value of clobazam as adjunct medication in therapy-resistant partial seizures. The use of clobazam as monotherapy and long-term treatment, as well as the particular seizure response pattern to clobazam, has to be further investigated.", 
    "5": "The effects of the anxiogenic beta-carboline FG 7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate) on motor activity and dopamine release in nucleus accumbens and striatum were measured in the rat. Changes in extracellular homovanillic acid (HVA) concentration, monitored by computer-controlled linear sweep voltammetry with carbon-paste electrodes, were used as an index of changes in dopamine release. An intraperitoneal injection of FG 7142 was followed by an inhibition of the nocturnal rise in motor activity and in dopamine release in nucleus accumbens, but not striatum. Two days after the drug injection, dopamine release in nucleus accumbens returned to control level and then increased on days 3-6 after the injection; there was no delayed change in motor activity or in striatal dopamine release. In parallel experiments using ex vivo changes in the ratio of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) to dopamine as an index of changes in dopamine turnover, a similar early depression and delayed increase of dopamine turnover in nucleus accumbens, with no change in striatum, was found after an intraperitoneal injection of FG 7142. Regression analysis of motor activity versus dopamine release showed a decrease in correlation between these 2 parameters for nucleus accumbens but not striatum after FG 7142 injection. These results suggest that the inverse benzodiazepine receptor agonist FG 7142 has a biphasic effect on dopamine release from mesolimbic neurons and support the hypothesis that dopamine release in nucleus accumbens and striatum has a modulatory effect on the control of motor activity but does not play a determining role in the regulation of movement.", 
    "6": "The regional distribution of [3H]zolpidem, a novel imidazopyridine hypnotic possessing preferential affinity for the BZD1 (benzodiazepine subtype 1) receptor, has been studied autoradiographically in the rat CNS and compared with that of [3H]flunitrazepam. The binding of [3H]zolpidem to rat brain sections was saturable, specific, reversible, and of high affinity (KD = 6.4 nM). It occurred at a single population of sites whose pharmacological characteristics were similar to those of the benzodiazepine receptors labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam. However, ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate and CL 218,872 were more potent displacers of [3H]zolpidem than of [3H]flunitrazepam. The autoradiographic brain distribution of [3H]zolpidem binding sites was qualitatively similar to that previously reported for benzodiazepine receptors. The highest levels of [3H]-zolpidem binding sites occurred in the olfactory bulb (glomerular layer), inferior colliculus, ventral pallidum, nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca, cerebral cortex (layer IV), medial septum, islands of Calleja, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, whereas the lowest densities were found in parts of the thalamus, pons, and medulla. Comparative quantitative autoradiographic analysis of the binding of [3H]zolpidem and [3H]flunitrazepam [a mixed BZD1/BZD2 (benzodiazepine subtype 2) receptor agonist] in the CNS revealed that the relative density of both 3H-labeled ligands differed in several brain areas. Similar levels of binding for both ligands were found in brain regions enriched in BZD1 receptors, e.g., substantia nigra pars reticulata, inferior colliculus, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex lamina IV. The levels of [3H]zolpidem binding were five times lower than those of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in those brain regions enriched in BZD2 receptors, e.g., nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus, and striatum. Moreover, [3H]zolpidem binding was undetectable in the spinal cord (which contains predominantly BZD2 receptors). Finally, like CL 218,872 and ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, zolpidem was a more potent displacer of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in brain regions enriched in BZD1 receptors than in brain areas enriched in BZD2 receptors. The present data add further support to the view that zolpidem, although structurally unrelated to the benzodiazepines, binds to the benzodiazepine receptor and possesses selectivity for the BZD1 receptor subtype.", 
    "7": "While tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have now long been used in treatment for depressive and panic-phobic disorders, we reviewed and reported on their efficacy in generalized anxiety states. These ill-defined states usually have admixtures of anxiety and depression. While there is no neat diagnostic categorization to fit this wasteland of yet-to-be-defined disorders, they show surprising responsiveness to imipramine. The onset of efficacy appears to begin at about 2 weeks or later and is probably superior to at least one well-known benzodiazepine, chlordiazepoxide, well beyond that time. It is not possible to dismiss these observed antianxiety effects as secondary to antidepressant effects or as attributable to the unintended inclusion of a peculiarly sensitive subset of individuals such as panic-phobic patients. These findings indicate that affect regulation by TCAs applies to so-called generalized anxiety as well as to depression and panic-phobic disorder. Brief reminders and guidelines are outlined for the possible clinical use of TCAs in anxiety disorders, but there remain more questions than answers. Several replication studies concerning the results reviewed here are now under way.", 
    "8": "Buspirone is a new anxiolytic that is structurally unrelated to other psychotropic drugs. The drug is as effective as benzodiazepines for the treatment of generalized anxiety, and superior to placebo. The effect of buspirone on other anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder, remains untested. Although buspirone's mechanism of action is unknown, it clearly does not act on the same receptor systems that are affected by benzodiazepines. Buspirone appears to lack dependence and abuse potential and has little or no sedative effect. In addition, the drug does not potentiate sedative-hypnotic drugs and does not potentiate functional impairment produced by alcohol. Like benzodiazepines, buspirone appears to be safe even when given in very high doses.", 
    "9": "This paper reviews data concerning the possible role of opioid neuropeptides in the central action of psychotropic drugs. The results summarized provide an evidence that the long term interruption of the central dopaminergic mechanisms by administration of neuroleptics causes specific alterations in the content, release and biosynthesis of several opioid peptides. Moreover, the dynamic changes of the enkephalin level in brain structures after one year of fluphenazine administration were described. The acute and chronic treatment with benzodiazepines induced pronounced changes in brain enkephalin concentrations. The first evidences are provided that chronic antidepressant treatment changes the level of enkephalins in discrete brain areas.", 
    "10": "To examine differences in prescribing patterns in relation to patient age, all drugs dispensed during 1 week in a sample of community pharmacies were recorded. The mean number of drugs per prescription increased linearly from 1.5 in children aged 0-9 years to 2.8 in patients 80 years and over. The rate of prescribing of diuretics, benzodiazepines, non-steroidal antiinflammatory agents and drugs acting on the cardiovascular system increased markedly with advancing age. Drugs with a low therapeutic ratio were also prescribed more frequently for patients over 65 years. Psychotropic agents (15.9%), diuretics (13.8%) and cardiovascular drugs (13.7%) were the most commonly prescribed drugs in this age group. While a minority of elderly patients were prescribed a large number of drugs, prescribing rates overall did not appear excessive.", 
    "11": "All drugs in a prospective series of 309 consecutive patients with cervical fractures and 300 with trochanteric fractures were recorded and compared with an age- and sex-matched randomly selected group from the city population files. A greater consumption of drugs was observed in the hip fracture group compared with the control group. Significant differences were observed for men regarding selective beta 2-adrenergic stimulants and xanthines, laxatives, phenothiazines and anti-psychotic drugs, as well as anti-glaucoma drugs. Women with hip fractures had a significantly greater consumption of diuretics, laxatives, insulin, phenothiazines and other antipsychotic drugs.", 
    "12": "1. (-)[125I]-Cyanopindolol (CYP) binding to non-beta-adrenoceptor sites in dog kidney was characterized in homogenate preparations and their distribution in sections determined using autoradiography. 2. In homogenate studies, (-)[125I]-CYP bound to a single population of non-interacting sites (Bmax = 5.45, s.e.m. = 1.00 fmol/mg wet weight; nH = 0.99, s.e.m. = 0.01) with high affinity (KD = 3.84, s.e.m. = 0.76 nmol/l, n = 40. 3. In competition studies, compounds selective for alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors, muscarinic cholinoceptors and receptors for 5-HT, histamine and benzodiazepines, calcium channel antagonists, catecholamine uptake inhibitors, MAO inhibitors and adrenergic neurone blockers were ineffective at concentrations of 10 mumol/l. 4. Compounds selective for dopamine D1-receptors (fluphenazine, SCH 23390 and SK & F 82526) and D2-receptors (pimozide, domperidone, spiperone, haloperidol, sulpiride, cis- and trans-flupenthixol) competed with similar affinities (5-25 mumol/l) for (-)[125I]-CYP binding. 5. In autoradiographic studies, (-)[125I]-CYP binding to non-beta-adrenoceptor sites was localized over glomeruli, juxtaglomerular apparatus, distal tubules, blood vessels and medullary rays and tubules. 6. It is concluded that in dog kidney, (-)[125I]-CYP binds to a site closely associated with dopamine receptors.", 
    "13": "Effects of lithium, carbamazepine, zotepine, and clonazepam were examined on the behaviour mediated by 5-HT1A receptor and at 5-HT1A binding sites in rats. Forepaw treading, one component of 5-HT behavioural syndrome following subcutaneous injections of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), was not altered by reserpine, p-chlorophenylalanine, or alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine; in reserpine-treated rats, it was antagonized only by spiperone or by (-)-propranolol. These results indicate that 8-OH-DPAT-induced forepaw treading is produced by the direct stimulation of 5-HT1A receptor postsynaptically and also that this behaviour is not mediated by monoaminergic neurons. Lithium, carbamazepine, and zotepine inhibited forepaw treading in untreated rats; only lithium and clonazepam inhibited it in reserpine-treated rats. After 14 days treatment, only lithium enhanced it while its enhancement was abolished by reserpine. Radioligand binding studies using [3H]-8-OH-DPAT demonstrated that zotepine possessed weak affinity for 5-HT1A receptor; others lacked affinity. These results from acute experiments suggest that all drugs tested have inhibitory effects on the 5-HT1A receptor function. These effects, however, were not mediated by 5-HT1A receptor. And it is also suggested that the 5-HT1A receptor function after chronic lithium treatment might be enhanced by monoaminergic systems transsynaptically.", 
    "14": "Behavioral evidence in laboratory animals and human beings indicates possible links between the endogenous opiate and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor systems, especially with regard to antagonistic properties. To assess possible interactions between endogenous opiate antagonists and benzodiazepine receptor binding, we evaluated the effects of the peptides MIF-1 and Tyr-MIF-1 on benzodiazepine receptor binding in mouse brain membranes. Neither peptide affected receptor binding in cortex over a broad dose range, but both peptides significantly augmented GABA-stimulated benzodiazepine receptor binding at GABA concentrations of 10(-8) and 10(-7) M. Rosenthal-Scatchard analysis indicated that the increase in binding was largely due to increased apparent affinity. Both peptides augmented GABA-enhanced binding at low doses (MIF-1 10(-11) M, Tyr-MIF-1 10(-13) M) with decreased effects at higher doses. In cerebellum and brainstem, MIF-1 tended to enhance GABA-stimulated binding but Tyr-MIF-1 was inactive. These results indicate benzodiazepine-opiate and benzodiazepine-peptide interactions.", 
    "15": "Five clinical cases of interaction between benzodiazepines on one hand and erythromycin, troleandomycin, josamycin and cimetidine on the other hand have been analyzed. These interactions resulted in severe disorders of behaviour, amnesia (including amnesia-automatism syndrome in one case), disturbances of consciousness and withdrawal syndrome. These disorders were consecutive to inhibition of the hepatic cytochrome P-450 system. Practical means of avoiding this risk consists in limiting such drug combinations, reducing benzodiazepine dosage and, if a combined treatment is necessary, using by preference either benzodiazepines degraded by conjugation instead of oxidation, or macrolides, or anti-H2 compounds with reduced inhibitory effect on microsomes.", 
    "16": "The pattern recognition theory was used to demonstrate that phenazepam effect on the differentiation of structured visual stimuli by animals is connected with the alteration of the processes of visual information elaboration in the somatosensory and association cortex.", 
    "17": "Benzodiazepines are unique chemicals with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and hypnotic properties. Twelve preparations of this group are available in the U.S.A.: two of them belong to the triazolo and one to the 3-nitro groups, the remaining ones are 3-OH or 2-keto benzodiazepines. A number of commonly employed drugs interact with benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists which block only one of its actions have been isolated. These promise to lead to preparations with only anxiolytic action without sedation or anticonvulsant action in the future. Guidelines for the selection of the proper drug and for the prevention of dependence are described.", 
    "18": "Benzodiazepines, particularly alprazolam, are quickly becoming the drugs of first choice in the treatment of many cases of panic and agoraphobia. The reason for this choice is that these drugs are safer to use, quicker in onset of action, easier for the physician to prescribe and more pleasant for the patient to take than the alternatives. Although the treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia has been best studied with the benzodiazepine alprazolam, it now appears likely that other benzodiazepines, for example diazepam, lorazepam and chlorazepam, may also be effective when correctly used. There is no reason at this point to believe that any of the benzodiazepines are unique in this regard. Future research will undoubtedly clarify this observation. In the meantime, it is hoped that some of the guidelines in this paper will help the practicing clinician in the management of his patient with this disabling and neglected disease.", 
    "19": "Studies evaluating the antianxiety and antipanic properties of beta-blockers do not support their routine use in treating either generalized anxiety disorder or panic disorder. The use of propranolol for anxiety disorders accompanied by physical symptoms, especially cardiovascular complaints, may be effective in some patients when combined with benzodiazepines or perhaps in some non-responders to conventional treatment. Better designed studies are needed to evaluate the exact role of beta-blocking agents in treating anxiety. The efficacy of propranolol in patients with panic disorder has not been widely researched, but preliminary results have not been encouraging. Propranolol may provide symptomatic relief in some patients with residual somatic complaints (i.e., palpitations and tachycardia), when combined with the patient's ongoing drug regimen. Because beta-blockers may induce depression, they should be used cautiously--if at all--in panic patients with concurrent depressive illness.", 
    "20": "Benzodiazepines (BDPs) are widely used drugs that are effective in controlling the symptoms of anxiety. Tolerance develops rapidly to some of the effects but not to anxiolytic effect in most patients. Dependence occurs at usual therapeutic doses and in a small proportion of patients is accompanied by an enormous increase in the dose taken. The majority of subjects using very high doses are dependent on other substances concurrently. On discontinuing BDPs patients may suffer from relapse of the original condition, rebound in the severity of the symptoms of the original condition or the onset of new symptoms in an abstinence syndrome. If BDPs are discontinued abruptly there may be severe consequences such as seizures. With tapering of the dose, even if this is rapid and from high dose, high potency BDP, the subject will probably experience considerable discomfort but rarely life-threatening effects. Whilst there is concern that BDPs are used too freely, the conditions treated are accompanied by significant morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of pure BDP dependence is low and it is still a matter of debate as to how often BDPs should be prescribed, for which conditions and for what length of time.", 
    "21": "First results from studies in healthy subjects with the beta-carbolines ZK 91 296, ZK 95 962 and ZK 93 426 are reviewed. ZK 91 296 and ZK 95 962, characterized as partial benzodiazepine agonists in preclinical research, were unable to induce some typical benzodiazepine effects like sedation when administered intravenously in high doses. ZK 95 962, reported to be effective in photoepileptic patients, was able to reverse lormetazepam-induced sleep as documented by EEG-parameters. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK 93 426 dose-dependently elicited alertness, restlessness and mild apprehension--symptoms opposite those known for the benzodiazepines. The activating effect of ZK 93 426 was confirmed by the results from e.g., self-rating scales and the logical reasoning test. In another placebo-controlled study comparing the effects of ZK 93 426 alone and in combination with lormetazepam vigilosomnograms obtained after ZK 93 426 alone clearly confirmed the activating effect. In combination with lormetazepam ZK 93 426 was able to reverse the benzodiazepine induced sleep. The attenuation of benzodiazepine effects was also evident from multiple sleep latency tests. Our results support findings from animal experiments which classify these beta-carbolines as benzodiazepine receptor ligands with partial agonist and antagonist properties. beta-Carbolines may prove to be beneficial drugs in the treatment of anxiety, convulsions and diseases with an impairment of cognitive functions as well as in the reversal of unwanted benzodiazepine effects.", 
    "22": "The anticonflict activity of the triazolobenzothiadiazine G\u00f6 4962 (40 mg/kg po) in the four-plate test using male NMRI mice was selectively antagonized by beta CCE (10 mg/kg iv), but not by Ro 15-1788 (20 mg/kg ip) or CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg ip), although G\u00f6 4962 has affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor. In contrast, the anticonflict activity of diazepam (4 mg/kg po) was antagonized by all three BZ antagonists. Relative to known putative anxiolytics, this profile of G\u00f6 4962 is unexpected and unique.", 
    "23": "The intravenous injection of cisplatin in the ferret caused a consistent emetic (vomiting/retching) response. Emesis induced by cisplatin was abolished by the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) M-receptor antagonists ICS205-930, zacopride, dazopride and metoclopramide. The neuroleptic agents haloperidol, fluphenazine, domperidone, sulpiride and tiapride also antagonized emesis induced by cisplatin but only a proportion of the animals were completely protected and diazepam and prednisolone only reduced the intensity of the response. It is concluded that compounds used in the clinic to antagonise emesis induced by chemotherapy are effective in the ferret model. Antagonism of emesis induced by cisplatin in the ferret was most potently achieved by the use of the 5-HT M-receptor antagonists ICS205-930 and zacopride. However, an antagonism of dopamine receptors would appear relevant to the anti-emetic effects of the neuroleptic agents and may contribute to the anti-emetic effects of metoclopramide. Diazepam and prednisolone exert their modest antagonism by unknown mechanisms. The use of the 5-HT M-receptor antagonists is revealed as a novel approach to the treatment of emesis induced by cisplatin.", 
    "24": "Seventeen nursing home residents with sleeping problems were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial of temazepam 15 mg, diphenhydramine (DPH) 50 mg, and placebo. Each drug was given for five consecutive nights with a 72-hour washout period between drugs. Subjects were assessed three times weekly with tests of psychomotor and cognitive function and four times weekly with observer sleep diaries and morning sleep questionnaires. Three subjects failed to complete the study. By report of the subjects, DPH resulted in shorter sleep latency than did placebo (t = 2.77, p less than 0.05). On the fifth night, use of DPH was associated with longer duration of sleep than temazepam (t = 2.88, p less than 0.05). No significant difference in tests of neurologic function was noted although, compared with placebo, subjects performed more poorly on seven of eight tests while taking temazepam and five of eight tests while taking DPH. Several instances of daytime hypersomnolence were noted in subjects taking temazepam and DPH, but none in subjects given placebo.", 
    "25": "Fully amygdala-kindled rats were used to study the effect of diazepam, RO 15-1788, and CGS-8216 on aminophylline-induced prolongation of elicited kindled afterdischarges. Similar proportional reductions in seizure afterdischarge durations were seen with diazepam and with RO 15-1788 after aminophylline although the absolute length of the afterdischarge durations were increased significantly with both drugs after aminophylline. The partial agonist effect of the benzodiazepine antagonist RO 15-1788 was demonstrated before and after aminophylline pretreatment. However, no specific interaction (pro- or anticonvulsant) was demonstrated with the benzodiazepine antagonist CGS-8216 before or after aminophylline pretreatment. Together these data do not support the theory that the prolongation of elicited kindled seizures by the methylxanthine, aminophylline, is through a specific benzodiazepine receptor mechanism.", 
    "26": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was employed to evaluate the place of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, in the early management of 60 patients who went to an accident and emergency center with overdosage of sedatives. The level of consciousness was monitored by a modified Glasgow Coma Scale, and the response to the intravenous administration of up to 1 mg flumazenil or placebo was followed for periods between 1 and 24 hours. The increases in the glasgow coma scale at 5 minutes in the flumazenil-treated group were significant in the group as a whole (+4.9; P less than 0.005), in those who had taken benzodiazepines only (+5.3; P = 0.005), and in those with mixed overdosages (+5.6; P less than 0.005). There were no significant changes in the placebo-treated group. Some patients with overdosage with ethanol also responded to flumazenil, but there was no effect in patients with overdosage of barbiturates alone or tricyclic antidepressants. Flumazenil was well tolerated although three patients had mild withdrawal reactions. The need for intensive physiologic support was avoided in several cases, and the differential diagnosis of the unconscious patient was facilitated.", 
    "27": "Thirty-one patients with severe drug-resistant epilepsy entered the study. Vigabatrin (2 to 3 g/d, stratified according to weight) and placebo were administered orally, as add-on therapy in random order under double-blind conditions, each for three months using a crossover design. Thirty patients completed both periods. Of these, ten patients (33%) showed a decrease in seizure frequency of 50% or more. In the 15 patients presenting with complex partial seizures, \"temporal\" electroencephalographic abnormalities, and relatively low seizure frequency, there was a significant reduction in seizure frequency during vigabatrin treatment. No significant treatment effect was found for the remaining 15 patients, who presented with mixed seizure types, multifocal electroencephalographic abnormalities, and high seizure frequencies. Tolerability to vigabatrin was good; the most frequently reported unwanted effect was drowsiness. Plasma concentrations of phenytoin showed a significant reduction during the vigabatrin period. The results demonstrate the efficacy and good tolerability of vigabatrin therapy in patients with severe complex partial epilepsy.", 
    "28": "Stress can induce a naloxone reversible and a naloxone non reversible analgesia according to its parameters. We showed that naloxone non reversible analgesia can be reversed by antagonists of the kappa opiate receptor and that naloxone reversible analgesia can be related to mu receptors and beta-endorphin, while the kappa receptor mediated analgesia can be related to dynorphin. We have also shown that the characteristics of the receptors might change in consequence to stress and that the analgesic responses might be modulated by benzodiazepine agonists and antagonists.", 
    "29": "The progressive course of hepatic encephalopathy developing in rats after massive hepatic ischemia due to hepatic artery ligation within 48 hr of a portacaval shunt was not altered by the injection of a benzodiazepine antagonist, CGS 8216, in a dose that was sufficient to reverse diazepam-induced coma quickly. The onset of hepatic coma was shortened 20 to 25% by the antagonist, rather than being delayed, as would be expected if hepatic coma were due to a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic effect. The neural binding of GABA by brains from rats in deep hepatic coma was unaffected by the injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist.", 
    "30": "Following our previous reports on pyrazolo[4,5-c]quinoline derivatives some isosteric pyrazolo[4,5-c] [1,8]naphthyridines were synthesized and tested for their ability to displace [3H]flunitrazepam from rat brain membranes. The lack of activity of the synthesized compounds and structure-activity relationships for the whole series are discussed.", 
    "31": "Mice were given chronic treatment with lorazepam 10 mg/kg PO or FG 7142 40 mg/kg IP once a day for 14 days. The pretreatments with lorazepam and FG 7142 did not change the sensitivity of the mice to the convulsant effect of DMCM. Lorazepam pretreated mice showed a significantly lower sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effects of the benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor ligands lorazepam, ZK 93423, ZK 91296, Ro 15-1788 and ZK 93426 administered acutely by the IP route when challenged with DMCM 24 hr after the last dose of lorazepam. FG 7142 pretreated mice showed a significantly lower sensitivity to the anticonvulsant effect of the two agonists lorazepam and ZK 93423 and to the antagonist Ro 15-1788, whereas the effects of ZK 91296 and ZK 93426 were left unchanged. The reduced DMCM antagonistic effects of the BZ receptor ligands may indicate that these ligands may either have lost some of their affinity to those BZ receptors being responsible for the DMCM-induced seizures or they may have lost some efficacy in allosterically inhibiting DMCM binding or as a third possibility may have lost efficacy at a BZ receptor site downstream to the seizure-inducing center in the brain.", 
    "32": "The biochemical and behavioural effects of the chronic administration of the beta-carboline inverse agonist FG 7142 were studied in the rat. Repeated administration of FG 7142 (15 mg/kg IP, twice daily for 10 consecutive days) induced sensitization to the effects of this drug, which from proconvulsant became a full convulsant. Thus, myoclonic seizures were observed in 30% and 80% of the animals by the third and the eighth day of treatment, respectively. The sensitization to the convulsant effect of FG 7142 persisted for up to 50 days after withdrawal and was completely prevented by the concurrent administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788 (15 mg/kg IP, twice a day for 10 days). Moreover, four to twelve days after withdrawal from chronic treatment with FG 7142, an increased sensitivity to the proconvulsant beta CCE and to the convulsant DMCM was observed. In addition, convulsions induced by isoniazid (350 mg/kg, SC) were potentiated in rats chronically treated with FG 7142 at 5 and 20 days after withdrawal. These pharmacological effects were paralleled by a decrease in the density of low affinity GABA receptors in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. These results are consistent with the view that repeated administration of FG 7142 induces a long-lasting down-regulation of the GABAergic function which results in an increased sensitivity to beta-carboline inverse agonists and isoniazid. The possibility that a concomitant decrease in the responsiveness to benzodiazepines and Ro15-1788 takes place after chronic treatment with FG 7142 is also discussed.", 
    "33": "We have studied in rodents the effects of beta-carboline inverse agonists on chronic treatment and after repeated administration of benzodiazepine agonists. Chronically, the inverse agonist FG 7142 caused chemical kindling, i.e., a decrease in the threshold to the convulsive effects of the drug. This change was accompanied by decreases in the effects of beta-carboline but not benzodiazepine agonists. In addition the effects of GABA receptor agonists were decreased and the effects of GABA antagonists marginally increased. The GABA stimulated benzodiazepine binding was lower after FG 7142 kindling. Some evidence was found in mice to suggest that these changes were accompanied by behavioural alterations, but studies in rats did not show any changes. Repeated administration of benzodiazepine agonists, sufficient to cause tolerance to their pharmacological actions and to those of beta-carboline agonists, increased all of the effects of the partial inverse agonists and some of the actions of the full inverse agonists. We suggest that this is due not to precipitation of withdrawal but to a \"withdrawal shift\" in the coupling at the receptor inophore. This would increase the intrinsic properties of inverse agonists and decrease those of agonists. Evidence for this hypothesis is summarised.", 
    "34": "beta-Carboline derivatives provide examples of benzodiazepine receptor ligands which span the range: full agonist-partial agonist-antagonist-partial inverse agonist-full inverse agonist. Taken together, the effects of these compounds illustrate two important principles: firstly, the bidirectionality of effects which can be achieved using benzodiazepine receptor ligands; secondly, the selectivity of effects which are produced by partial agonists. Applied to the study of feeding processes, these principles imply that both hyperphagic and anorectic effects can be generated by actions of selected ligands at benzodiazepine receptors. Furthermore, they suggest that a hyperphagic effect may occur in the absence of side-effects (e.g., sedation, muscle-relaxation), which are characteristic of classical benzodiazepines. Experimental data in support of these predictions are presented. A microstructural approach to feeding behavior indicated that a benzodiazepine receptor agonist and an inverse agonist extend and abbreviate, respectively, the duration of individual bouts of eating. Preference for a saccharin solution was attenuated by the beta-carboline inverse agonist, FG 7142, but rejection of a quinine solution was not increased. Adrenalectomy had no effect on the anorectic effect of inverse agonists.", 
    "35": "Several beta-carbolines and other benzodiazepines (BZ) receptor ligands have been investigated for anxiolytic or anxiogenic action in 4 unrelated animal models of anxiety using rats. The substances could be grouped into essentially 2 groups. The first, anxiolytics, exhibited antipunishment activity in a lick-suppression test, antagonised the discriminative stimulus provided by pentylenetetrazol, resembled chlordiazepoxide (CDP) in a drug discrimination test, and reduced the rise in plasma corticosterone levels following swim stress. Such substances included several benzodiazepines, the beta-carboline ZK 93 423, and the triazolapyridazine CL 218 872. A subgroup of anxiolytics were active in only some of these tests. They included two beta-carbolines, ZK 91 296 and ZK 95 962, and the pyrazoloquinoline CGS 9896, and these 3 substances were also distinguishable in not producing rate-decreasing effects in any of the 3 operant tests. The second group were anxiogenic in that they produced a discriminative stimulus resembling that of PTZ, they antagonised the CDP cue, exhibited propunishment effects in the lick-suppression test, and themselves caused increases in plasma corticosterone in otherwise unstressed animals. Such substances included the beta-carbolines DMCM, FG 7142 and ZK 90 886, and the pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216. Two substances, Ro 15-1788 and ZK 93 426 had little or only weak activity in any test. The classification of these substances into anxiolytics or anxiogenics could be predicted qualitatively both by their ability to enhance (anxiolytics) or decrease the binding of 35S-TBPS to rat brain membranes and by whether their own binding was increased (anxiolytics) by adding the GABA agonist muscimol to the in vitro incubation medium. For the limited number of substances for which full data was available, there was also a quantitative relationship between the degree of enhancement of 35S-TBPS binding by a substance and its potency in the CDP cue test when such potency was expressed as numbers of BZ receptors occupied at the ED50 value in the pharmacological test. Furthermore, for the anxiolytics, activity in the CDP cue correlated significantly with potency in 2 other tests. Otherwise, surprisingly weak correlations existed between potencies in the different tests. In particular, the beta-carboline ZK 95 962 was highly potent in antagonising the PTZ cue but inactive in both a conflict test and in protecting against stress. These results are discussed in terms of differences in the neuropharmacologies of the 4 tests and in selectivity of the BZ receptor ligands for subtypes of BZ receptor.", 
    "36": "The cerebral cortex of unstressed (handling-habituated) rats has a higher number of low affinity GABA receptors than stressed (naive) rats. Foot shock stress delivered to unstressed rats decreases the density of cortical low affinity GABA receptors to the level found in the naive animals. The effect of stress on GABA receptors is mimicked by anxiogenic beta-carbolines, both after in vitro addition (10(-6) M) to cortical membrane preparations or after the in vivo administration (20 mg/kg IP) to unstressed rats. Vice versa, benzodiazepines or anxiolytic beta-carbolines (ZK 93423, 10(-5) M) added to membranes from naive rats increase GABA binding to the level of unstressed rats and remove the decrease in the density of GABA receptors elicited by anxiogenic beta-carbolines. Rats chronically treated with the anxiogenic beta-carboline, FG 7142 (15 mg/kg IP twice a day for 10 consecutive days) have an enhanced sensitivity to punishment at 5 and 15 days after the last treatment. The behavioural effect is paralleled by a marked decrease in the total number of cortical low affinity GABA receptors. Both biochemical and behavioural effects elicited by chronic FG 7142 are prevented by the concurrent administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro15-1788. These results suggest that (a) anxiolytic beta-carbolines, like benzodiazepines, increase the GABAergic transmission, (b) acute and chronic anxiogenic beta-carboline administration, like stress, decreases GABAergic transmission. Since all these effects are antagonized by the benzodiazepine receptor blocker Ro15-1788, it is tempting to speculate that stress releases an endogenous ligand for benzodiazepine recognition sites.", 
    "37": "The use of improved affinity chromatographic techniques has allowed for the substantial copurification of both the benzodiazepine and the GABA receptor from brain. These preparations have been used to begin characterization of the benzodiazepine receptor at a molecular level. We have recently purified benzodiazepine receptor from human and rat cerebellum, and SDS-PAGE has revealed that both preparations consist of a major protein of 50 kDa and a minor protein of 55 kDa. These proteins are recognized by a series of monoclonal antibodies prepared against the rat benzodiazepine receptor suggesting the rat and human receptors share several common antigenic domains. Several other approaches have been employed to further investigate possible homology between the rat and human receptors. Proteolytic degradation studies have shown that the major limiting photolabeled peptide fragment generated in rat and human is similar as determined by HPLC analysis. Isoelectric focusing and SDS (two-dimensional) electrophoresis have revealed that the immunoreactive, photolabeled 50 kDa protein, and the purified receptor have identical PI values. The receptor from both human and rat are glycoproteins as determined by lectin binding studies. However, exposure of these proteins to neuraminidase fails to alter the pharmacology of the receptors indicating possible similarities in their posttranslational glycosylation. Thus, it appears that some degree of structural homology exists between the rat and human benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "38": "Pipequaline (PK 8165), a quinoline derivative and a ligand of the benzodiazepine binding site, is a clinically-effective anxiolytic, which is devoid of sedative and anticonvulsant properties. Several biochemical and behavioral studies have indicated that this molecule shares some properties with both agonists and antagonists of benzodiazepine receptors. The present in vivo electrophysiological studies were undertaken to determine the effects of microiontophoretic applications and of intravenous injections of pipequaline on hippocampal pyramidal neurons, activated by kainate, glutamate or acetylcholine and to characterize the effects of pipequaline on the action of benzodiazepines. Intravenously administered pipequaline exerted a partial suppression of activations by kainate, glutamate and acetylcholine. Microiontophoretic applications of pipequaline reduced the neuronal activation by kainate. This effect was blocked by RO 15-1788. In small intravenous doses, pipequaline potentiated the effect of microiontophoretically-applied flurazepam whereas, in larger doses, it suppressed the effects of microiontophoretically-applied flurazepam and of intravenously administered lorazepam on kainate-induced activation. Similarly, microiontophoretic applications of pipequaline blocked the suppressant effect of microiontophoretically-applied flurazepam on kainate-induced activation. These results constitute further evidence that the selective anxiolytic activity of pipequaline might be ascribed to its partial agonistic action on benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "39": "Acetylcholine inhibits FSH-induced cAMP accumulation in cultured Sertoli cells from immature hamsters. This action of acetylcholine is mimicked by muscarinic cholinergic agonists with a rank order of carbachol greater than acetylcholine greater than arecoline greater than pilocarpine. The carbachol-induced inhibition of stimulated cAMP accumulation is blocked by atropine greater than pirenzepine but not by d-tubocurarine, indicating an apparent muscarinic receptor similar to that found in other peripheral tissues. The fact that pirenzepine is less effective as an inhibitor of the carbachol effect than atropine further defines the muscarinic effect as of the M2 subtype. The ability of carbachol to inhibit FSH-induced cAMP accumulation is blocked by pertussis toxin, which inhibits the action of the Ni inhibitory transducer of adenylate cyclase. These data indicate that cultured Sertoli cells from immature hamsters contain an M2 type muscarinic cholinergic receptor that is negatively coupled to the adenylate cyclase system through the inhibitory Ni transducer.", 
    "40": "Pharmacokinetic profiles of the 1,4-substituted benzodiazepines are defined by their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion characteristics. An ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and the onset of pharmacological activity have been associated with the physiochemical properties of the benzodiazepines. In addition, drug concentrations in the CSF correlate with the unbound drug concentrations in blood or plasma. Duration of pharmacological activity of the benzodiazepines in humans is associated with the affinity of these compounds for the benzodiazepine receptors in human brain. Therefore, benzodiazepines with high affinity for the benzodiazepine receptor sites in human brain tend to exhibit prolonged half-lives of elimination from the CSF which correlate with the prolonged duration of clinical and pharmacological effects and lower therapeutic doses of these drugs in vivo.", 
    "41": "Earlier results indicate that the neurons of the midbrain central gray (CG) responsible for the elaboration and/or expression of aversive states are tonically inhibited by the GABA-benzodiazepine system. In the present study, chemitrodes were implanted in the medial hypothalamus (MH) of the rat, another aversive area of the brain deeply interrelated with the dorsal CG. Microinjection of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam raised the aversive threshold of electrical stimulation of the MH in a dose-dependent way, though in only about half of the animals tested. In the remaining rats, midazolam was ineffective. Similar antiaversive effects were caused by the GABA-A receptor agonist THIP. In contrast, microinjection of the GABA-A receptor blocker bicuculline induced aversive-like behavioral and autonomic changes. The effects of bicuculline were antagonized by pretreatment with either THIP or midazolam, the latter being counteracted by the competitive benzodiazepine receptor blocker Ro 15-1788. These results extend to the MH, the hypothesis of GABA-benzodiazepine modulation of neurons integrating aversive motivational states.", 
    "42": "The interaction of several phenothiazines, benzodiazepines, butyrophenones, polycyclic neuroleptics and tricyclic antidepressants with calmodulin and troponin C was investigated using the fluorescent dye 3,3'-dipropylthiocarbocyanine iodide. In the presence of Ca2+, trifluoperazine (2-trifluoromethyl-10-[3-(1-methylpiperazinyl-4)propyl]-phenothiaz ine dihydrochloride, TFP), which is commonly used as a selective calmodulin inhibitor, half maximally increased the fluorescence of the complex formed of the fluorescent dye with calmodulin at a concentration of 4 mumol/l, and with troponin C at 24 mumol/l. TFP completely inhibited the calmodulin dependent stimulation of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase with a Ki of 4 mumol/l and decreased the maximum Ca2+ dependent troponin C mediated activation of actomyosin ATPase by 35% at a concentration of 100 mumol/l. Metofenazate (3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate-2-chlor-10-(3-[(beta-oxyethyl) piperazinyl-4]-propyl)phenothiazine diethanesulfonate, methophenazine, MP) produced half maximal fluorescence enhancement of the calmodulin dye complex at a concentration of 6 mumol/l and did not influence the fluorescence of the troponin C dye complex at concentrations of up to 1000 mumol/l. MP also completely inhibited the calmodulin dependent stimulation of phosphodiesterase with a Ki of 7 mumol/l but it had not effect on maximum Ca2+ stimulation of actomyosin ATPase. MP increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of skinned cardiac muscle with an about 10fold lower potency than TFP. In view of these results, we propose MP as a useful tool for distinction between processes mediated by either calmodulin or troponin C.", 
    "43": "The muscarinic receptors of muscularis mucosa have some recognition properties that suggest they resemble receptors of the M1 subtype. The nerves of these tissues also contain muscarinic receptors which inhibit tonic contractions caused by release of a substance-P-like material by field stimulation. These receptors also appear to be M1 in type as they are maximally activated by McNeil A343 as well as by carbachol (pD2, 5.5 and 7.5, respectively). They are also inhibited by pirenzepine, as well as by atropine (negative logarithms of the required dose for 50% inhibition or potentiation, 6.6-6.7 compared with 8.2-8.3). Hexahydrosiladifenidol, an antagonist selective or M2 receptors of guinea pig ileum, had a low (approximately 7.1) pA2 value for antagonism of both agonists in smooth muscle in this tissue. However, it was closer to atropine in potency with respect to potentiating tonic responses to field stimulation or to inhibiting phasic responses to field stimulation than it was to antagonizing smooth muscle contractions. Thus, atropine was about 40 times more potent than pirenzepine and 2-5 times more potent than hexahydrosilafenidol. There were some quantitative differences in the effectiveness of these three antagonists in blocking the phasic (acetylcholine-mediated) response to field stimulation. Atropine was 70-100 times more potent than pirenzepine and 8-25 times more potent than hexahydrosiladifenidol. This greater potency difference for inhibition of phasic contractions compared with potentiation of tonic contractions was discussed. This tissue appears to be one of the first smooth muscles in which both nerves and muscles contain muscarinic receptors with some recognition properties resembling those of the M1 subtype.", 
    "44": "The role of the plasma membrane potential (delta psi p) in the commitment to differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells has been studied by analyzing the ionic basis and the time course of this potential in the absence or the presence of different types of inducers. delta psi p was determined by measuring the distribution of tetraphenylphosphonium (TPP+) across the plasma membrane and displayed a 22-hour depolarization phase (from -28 to +5 mV) triggered by factors contained in foetal calf serum (FCS) and followed by a nearly symmetrical repolarization phase. After measuring the electrochemical equilibrium potential of Na+, K+, and Cl-, the relative contribution of these ions to delta psi p was evaluated by means of ion substitution experiments and by the addition of ion flux inhibitors (tetrodotoxin [TTX], 4-acetoamide-4'-isothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate [SITS]) and ionophores (Valinomycin, A23187). The Na+ contribution to delta psi p appeared negligible, the potential being essentially generated by K+ and Cl- fluxes. When evaluated by a new mathematical approach, the effects of Valinomycin and A23187 at different times of incubation provided evidence that both the depolarization and the repolarization phase were due to variations of the K+ permeability across the plasma membrane (PK) mediated by Ca2+-activated K+ channels. All the inducers tested (dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO], hexamethylen-bis-acetamide [HMBA], diazepam), although they did not modify the ionic basis of delta psi p, strongly attenuated the depolarization rate of this potential. This attenuation was not brought about when the inducers were added to noninducible MEL cell clonal sublines. Cell commitment occurred only during the depolarization phase and increased proportionally to the attenuation of this phase up to a threshold beyond which the further increase of the attenuation was associated with the inhibition of commitment. The major role of the inducers apparently consisted of the stabilization of the Ca2+-activated K+ channels, suggesting that a properly modulated delta psi p depolarization through these channels is primarily involved in the signal generation for MEL cell commitment to differentiation.", 
    "45": "The benzothiazepine diltiazem is a potent Ca-channel blocker, which also inhibits the Na-dependent Ca-efflux from heart mitochondria. In this study, the action of the 4 stereoisomers of diltiazem has been investigated using guinea-pig heart and liver mitochondria. The rate of the Na-dependent Ca-efflux from liver mitochondria has been found to be 10 times smaller than in heart mitochondria. Otherwise, the exchange systems from the two tissues have been found to be pharmacologically indistinguishable. Both the (+)-optical isomers of the cis- and trans-forms of diltiazem inhibit Na-Ca exchange activity with comparable potency (IC50 of 10-20 microM), while the (-)-optical isomers are ineffective (IC50 greater than 200 microM). Radioligand binding experiments have revealed that only one stereoisomer of diltiazem, the (+)-cis form, interacts with high affinity with the Ca-channel receptors of guinea-pig heart sarcolemma preparations (KD = 120 nM). The results have shown that the Ca-channel of plasma membranes and the mitochondrial Na-Ca exchanger have different stereospecific requirements for the binding of diltiazem.", 
    "46": "The use of benzodiazepine sensitivity testing in the management of 40 children with intractable seizure disorders was studied. The aetiology and clinical syndromes varied widely with myoclonic, atonic and complex absence seizures predominating. Twenty-five cases had mixed seizure disorders. There was, likewise, a wide range of EEG abnormalities. Seven cases were in non-convulsive status at the time of testing. Diazepam (0.2 mg/kg) was given slowly intravenously and its effect on the EEG was observed. In 21 cases epileptiform activity was abolished. No change was seen in 13 cases and an unusual result was seen in 3. There was a paradoxical response in 3 cases, two of these associated with clinical seizures. Only 1 child in non-convulsive status had a positive result. Following testing, 32 patients went on to long-term oral benzodiazepine treatment. Twenty-one of these patients showed subsequent clinical improvement and 16/21 (76%) had had a positive sensitivity test previously. Eleven of these patients did not improve on long-term treatment. Seven out of the 11 (64%) had had a negative sensitivity test. These results suggest that the benzodiazepine sensitivity test is of value in the long-term management of intractable seizure disorders in childhood, but also emphasise the variability and unpredictability of response to benzodiazepine treatment.", 
    "47": "The allosteric modulation of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding by flunitrazepam was studied in well-washed brain membranes prepared from control and swim-stressed rats. Swim stress has been reported to decrease the KD and increase the Bmax of this radioligand. Flunitrazepam increased radioligand binding with equal potency (EC50 approximately 11 nM) in both groups, but the maximal enhancement (efficacy) produced by this drug was significantly greater in control than in swim-stressed rats. Ro 15-1788 (a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist) blocked the effect of flunitrazepam on t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding in both groups. This increase in t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding resulted from a significant reduction in KD with no alteration in Bmax. The KD values obtained in cortical membranes of control rats after addition of flunitrazepam were not significantly different from those in the swim-stressed group. Preincubation of cortical homogenates from control animals with flunitrazepam prior to extensive tissue washing resulted in Bmax and KD values of t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate similar to those obtained in stressed animals. These findings suggest that stress and flunitrazepam may share a common mechanism in regulating t-[35S]butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding and support the concept that stress-induced modification of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride channels in the CNS results from the release of an endogenous modulator (with benzodiazepine-like properties) of the benzodiazepine-GABA receptor chloride ionophore receptor complex.", 
    "48": "A comparison of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor binding to sections of rat, mouse and guinea pig brain has been performed using 125I-Bolton Hunter CCK and the selective peripheral CCK receptor antagonist L-365,031. In both rat and mouse, 125I-Bolton Hunter CCK binding in the region of the interpeduncular nucleus (IPN) was inhibited by L-365,031 indicating that these receptors resemble CCK receptors found in peripheral tissues. In the mouse especially, dense regions of peripheral CCK receptors were detected either side of the IPN. By contrast, in the guinea pig IPN no evidence of L-365,031-sensitive binding could be found. The present reports shows that in different species, regional variations in brain CCK receptor binding occur not only in the case of classical 'brain' receptors, but also for the more discretely localised 'peripheral' type CCK receptors.", 
    "49": "In a holeboard test the imidazodiazepine Ro 15-4513 (1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg) reduced exploratory head-dipping. This effect was reversed both by the imidazodiazepine Ro 15-1788 (5 mg/kg) and by the beta-carboline ZK 93426 (2.5 mg/kg). These results indicate that the reduction in exploration caused by Ro 15-4513 is mediated by central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "50": "Three neuroscientists traveled on different occasions from New York to Europe to attend scientific meetings. In an attempt to minimize \"jet lag,\" they all took triazolam, 0.5 mg, during the flight. In addition to the medication, they also consumed ethyl alcohol to a variable degree, none to clinical intoxication. All three experienced an episode of anterograde amnesia that lasted several hours. In two of the individuals, neurologists associated with them did not detect any memory disturbance at the time. These episodes of transient global amnesia were evidently secondary to the triazolam or the combination of triazolam and ethyl alcohol. These episodes suggest caution if using this medication to avoid jet lag, especially if ethyl alcohol will be consumed.", 
    "51": "The naturally occurring progesterone metabolites 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one and 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione reversibly enhance membrane currents elicited by locally applied GABA in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells. Such potentiation was not influenced by the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. At concentrations in excess of those necessary to evoke potentiation of GABA currents, 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one and 5 beta-pregane-3,20-dione directly activated a membrane conductance. The resulting currents were potentiated by phenobarbitone and diazepam, and abolished by the GABAA-receptor antagonist, bicuculline. On outside-out membrane patches, 5 beta-pregnan-3 alpha-ol-20-one and 5 beta-pregnane-3,20-dione activated single channel currents of similar amplitude to those evoked by GABA. The results suggest that certain naturally occurring steroids potentiate the actions of GABA and, additionally, directly activate the GABAA receptor.", 
    "52": "Tabernanthine, an indol alkaloid, is structurally related to carbolines (harmane, harmaline) which, in vitro, displace specific flunitrazepam binding to brain benzodiazepine receptors. In vivo, both tabernanthine and carbolines cause a fine general tremor, suggesting that a possible interaction with benzodiazepine receptors could be involved in the activity of tabernanthine. This hypothesis was validated by the in vitro and in vivo antagonism of benzodiazepine by tabernanthine. In vitro, tabernanthine inhibited specific flunitrazepam binding in a competitive manner with an affinity (IC50 150 microM) in the same range as harmane. Tabernanthine appeared as a benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist in a discriminant in vitro binding assay. In vivo, the time course of tremorigenic activity was related to the tabernanthine concentration in brain (half-life = 2 h). Moreover, tabernanthine-induced tremor was inhibited reversibly by flunitrazepam or by Ro-15 1788 (an antagonist of benzodiazepine-receptors). These results suggest that part of the action of tabernanthine may be mediated by an interaction at the benzodiazepine receptor level.", 
    "53": "The gamma-aminobutyric-acid-receptor protein complex from rat brain was solubilized in high yield, purified in milligram amounts by benzodiazepine affinity chromatography and used to generate a high-titer rabbit antiserum. High concentrations of Triton X-100 detergent plus KCl solubilized about 90% of the membrane-bound gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (assayed by [3H]muscimol binding) and benzodiazepine receptor (assayed by [3H]flunitrazepam binding) activities. Both activities were retained on an affinity column using an immobilized benzodiazepine ligand, and most of the column-absorbed receptor could be eluted by a solution of free benzodiazepine plus 4 M urea. The purified protein bound [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam with receptor-like pharmacological specificity and specific activities of about 1700 pmol and 700 pmol bound/mg protein, respectively, for the two ligands. This corresponds to a purification of over 600-fold and a near theoretical purity, with a yield of milligram quantities from 100 g brain. Four peptide bands were observed on gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate, with molecular mass values of 31, 47, 52 and 57 kDa. The latter two were most significantly stained, and identified as receptor subunits by photolabeling with [3H]flunitrazepam (52 kDa) and [3H]muscimol (57 kDa), and by reaction on Western blots with monoclonal antibodies to this protein produced by Schoch et al. [(1985) Nature (Lond.) 314, 168-171]. Rabbit antiserum was raised to the purified protein and could, at high dilutions, both coprecipitate soluble gamma-aminobutyric-acid/benzodiazepine-receptor-binding activities and stain the receptor subunits (principally 52-kDa band) on Western blots.", 
    "54": "Solubilized and Purified gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors from membrane vesicles of the bovine cerebral cortex were reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles and 36Cl- influx into the vesicles was examined. GABA induced a significant stimulation of the 36Cl- influx into reconstituted vesicles with 1.5% CHAPS/0.15% asolectin solubilized receptor and flunitrazepam further enhanced the GABA-stimulated influx. The purification of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex and Cl- channel solubilized by 1.5% CHAPS/0.15% asolectin from membrane vesicles was achieved by 1012-S affinity column chromatography. The reconstituted vesicles with the purified receptor complex and Cl- channel also exhibited GABA-stimulated 36Cl- influx. This GABA-stimulated influx of 36Cl- was also enhanced by flunitrazepam, while suppressed by bicuculline, a GABAA receptor antagonist. These results strongly suggest that GABAA receptor is directly coupled with Cl- channel, whereas benzodiazepine receptor may be functionally coupled with GABAA receptor and modulates the GABA-stimulated Cl- influx through GABAA receptor. The present results also indicate that the purified GABAA receptor complex is coupled with Cl- channel and possesses functional characteristics as GABAA receptor.",

Reversed ion-pair high-performance liquid chromatography with a photodiode array detector saves the ultraviolet spectrum of every chromatographically significant peak. Post-run data-processing, provided by a microcomputer, retrieves candidate substances from a library of ultraviolet spectra. Selected standard ultraviolet spectra are compared with the unknown by five different similarity tests. The discriminatory efficiency of these algorithms has been determined. Multicomponent analysis, a built-in program of the spectrophotometer, provided the most reliable results.", 
    "56": "Rings of canine bronchi were suspended for isometric tension recording. Contractions produced by exogenously added acetylcholine were inhibited by pirenzepine and pancuronium. The pKB values were 6.76 for pirenzepine (calculated at 10(-6) M) and 5.30 and 5.13 for pancuronium (calculated at 10(-5) and 3 X 10(-5) M, respectively). Contractile responses evoked by cholinergic nerve stimulation (0.2-16 Hz, 9 V) were depressed by pancuronium in a concentration-dependent manner, while concentrations of pirenzepine selective for M1-muscarinic receptors were without effect. The results indicate that exogenous and nerve-released acetylcholine activate a homogenous population of M2-muscarinic receptors in isolated preparations of canine bronchial smooth muscle.", 
    "57": "The imidazobenzodiazepine, Ro15-4513, which is a partial inverse agonist at brain benzodiazepine receptors, reversed the incoordinating effect of ethanol in mice, as measured on an accelerating Rotarod. This effect was blocked by benzodiazepine receptor antagonists. In contrast, Ro15-4513 had no effect on ethanol-induced hypothermia in mice. However, Ro15-4513 reversed the hypothermic effect of pentobarbital, and, at a higher dose, also reversed the incoordinating effect of pentobarbital in mice. The data support the hypothesis that certain of the pharmacological effects of ethanol are mediated by actions at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor-coupled chloride channel.", 
    "58": "The ability of etizolam, 6-(o-chlorophenyl)-8-ethyl-1-methyl-4H-s-triazolo[3,4-c]thieno[2,3-e] [1,4]diazepine (Y-7131), an anti-anxiety drug, to inhibit platelet-activating factor (PAF)-induced reactions was investigated in experimental animals in vivo. Etizolam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) dose dependently inhibited PAF (0.3 microgram/kg, i.v.)-induced bronchoconstriction (Konzett and R\u00f6ssler's method) in guinea pigs, but even at doses as large as 3 mg/kg, i.v., it had no effect on bronchoconstriction induced by histamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, arachidonic acid, bradykinin, angiotensin l or leukotriene D4. Etizolam (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.v.) also dose-dependently reversed PAF (1 microgram/kg, i.v.)-induced hypotension in anesthetized rats. Injection of PAF into the tail veins of mice produced lethal shock within 10-30 min. Etizolam (0.1-3 mg/kg, i.v. and 1-10 mg/kg, p.o.) protected against the lethal effect of PAF (75 micrograms/kg, i.v.) in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that etizolam specifically inhibits the action of PAF in vivo.", 
    "59": "Drug use self-reports were compared with urinalysis for 248 clients in four methadone treatment programs. The validity of self-reporting based on urinalysis as a criterion depended on the type of drug examined. Opiate reporting was least valid, while benzodiazepine and cocaine reporting were moderately and highly valid, respectively. EMIT urinalysis was far more useful as a criterion of validity than TLC urinalysis. Self-reports helped identify drug users who were missed by urinalysis because of the latter's limited detection period, but urinalysis in turn detected an equal number of drug users missed by the interviews. The age of clients and the type of interviewer directly affected the rate of underreporting. Some respondents systematically denied disvalued behaviors (i.e., drug use and criminality), leading to a spurious correlation between these behaviors. This has important implications for future research.", 
    "60": "An interstrain comparison was conducted between male spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats, in both the open field and the elevated plus-maze. Wistar-Kyoto rats, as compared to the hypertensive animals, showed, beside an attenuated locomotor activity in both test situations, a higher reaction to aversive environments (less entries into the central area of the open field and less visits to the open arms of the elevated plus-maze). Chlordiazepoxide, as potent anxiolytic, increased (1) general activity, (2) the frequency of entries into the open area of the open field, and (3) the number of visits to the open arms of the elevated plus-maze in both rat strains.", 
    "61": "1. The pharmacokinetics of pirenzepine (Gastrozepin) was studied after single and multiple oral administration in gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer patients. 2. With a dose of 50 mg of pirenzepine, plasma levels reached a maximum 2 h after the administration in both groups (gastric ulcer patients: 57.2 +/- 31.8 ng/ml, duodenal ulcer patients: 48.0 +/- 18.0 ng/ml), and decreased bi-phasically with an elimination half-life (t1/2 beta) of 13.9 +/- 4.0 and 17.9 +/- 4.5 h, respectively. The area under the plasma level curve were 844 +/- 319 ng X h/ml and 663 +/- 151 ng X h/ml in the respective group. 3. The plasma levels of pirenzepine after multiple administration (50 mg was given as a loading dose, and thereafter 25 mg was given as a maintenance dose at an interval of 12 h for 7 days) maintained certain steady state levels from just after the start of administration. 4. It can be concluded that there is no significant difference in the pharmacokinetics of pirenzepine between gastric and duodenal ulcer patients. It can be judged that twice-daily administration of pirenzepine is enough for ulcer treatment.", 
    "62": "Protective and reactivating effects of oximes HI-6 and PAM-2, combined with atropine and diazepam, were investigated in quinalphos-poisoned rats. In protective experiments, atropine and diazepam decreased acute toxicity of the insecticide 3.3 times. Later administration of a single injection of oximes led to further improvement of protective indexes which were 1.45 (PAM-2) and 1.52 (HI-6) times larger. Plasma HI-6 concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, continuously maintained by osmotic minipumps and supported by a single administration of atropine and diazepam, protected animals from 18.6 LD50 of quinalphos, while its higher concentrations (ranging from 1 to 5.4 micrograms/ml) provided markedly better protection (up to 72 LD50). Corresponding plasma PAM-2 concentrations were even more effective in overcoming toxic effects of quinalphos. PAM-2 concentrations, continuously maintained in plasma, were distinctly better in protecting and reactivating peripheral cholinesterase activity than corresponding HI-6 concentrations in the case of quinalphos poisoning. On the basis of our findings we suggest that continuous maintenance of low oxime concentrations is preferred to single oxime administration in the therapy of organophosphate intoxications.", 
    "63": "The action of clonazepam (CZP) pretreatment on metrazol-induced ECoG phenomena was studied in Wistar albino rats. ECoG was recorded in acute experiments in male rats 7, 12, 18, 25 and 90 days old (N = 162). CZP (0.1 or 0.02 mg/kg) was injected i.p. 10 min prior to the start of repetitive administration of metrazol (PTZ, 20 mg/kg i.p. every 5 min). Latencies of the first signs of PTZ action, of the rhythmic metrazol activity, of the first ictal activity and of the generalized seizure were measured. CZP exhibited a dose-related effect against ECoG signs elicited by PTZ. A statistically significant increase in latencies was observed with the dose of 0.1 mg/kg in 18 day old and older animals. The 0.1 mg/kg dose of CZP also completely blocked generalized ictal activity in 7 day old rats. In adult animals, CZP pretreatment led to the appearance of partial seizures, a phenomenon never seen in controls. The development of CZP effects corresponds to the maturation of benzodiazepine binding sites.", 
    "64": "Seasonal accumulation of duodenal ulcer recurrences suggests that maintenance therapy could be limited to the more risky periods. We carried out a 2-year, multi-centre, randomized, double blind study in 250 patients in whom the last ulcer proved to be healed at the endoscopy on entry. One-hundred-and-twenty-six patients in group A were given pirenzepine 2 X 25 mg while 124 in group B had 2 X 50 mg daily from the beginning of January to the end of March, and from the beginning of September to the end of November for two consecutive years. Test endoscopies were performed each year at the end of February, May and November. Both groups proved to be well comparable. Thirty-five patients dropped out from group A in the first and 10 in the second year; in group B 27 and 29, respectively. As the effect did not show any dose relation, the four yearly cycles were summarized. Recurrence rate checked in May was 22.1% while in both pirenzepine protected months it was 11.3% (p less than 0.0005) and 13.4% (p less than 0.001), respectively. We conclude that pirenzepine administered in the risky seasons prevents the peak ulcer incidence and reduces the recurrence rate to a level lower than in the non-risky season. Thus pirenzepine is effective in ulcer prevention even if administered in an interrupted manner.", 
    "65": "The effects of pirenzepine and ranitidine on luminal HCO3- outflow occurring in subjects with chronic antral erosions have been investigated in a double-blind study. Thirty outpatients with chronic erosions of the gastric antrum were randomly treated for 4 weeks with either pirenzepine 50 mg b.i.d. or ranitidine 150 mg b.i.d. Endoscopic appearance and intragastric bicarbonate content were assessed before and after treatment. At endoscopic follow-up pirenzepine was found to be significantly more effective than ranitidine in promoting disappearance of antral erosions. In the ranitidine group the abnormally high intraluminal HCO3 content was reduced only in healed subjects, while no changes were observed in patients with persisting erosions. In contrast pirenzepine induced normalization of intragastric bicarbonate both in healed and in unhealed patients. The results suggest that pirenzepine suppresses luminal HCO3 leakage by functionally strengthening mucosal defences even before anatomical repair is obtained.", 
    "66": "Two short-acting benzodiazepines, midazolam 15 mg and triazolam 0.25 mg, were compared with diazepam 10 mg and placebo as oral premedicants in 120 patients presenting for minor urological surgery. Midazolam was found to produce the greatest degree of amnesia and sedation at the time of anaesthetic induction and triazolam was found to have the greatest degree of residual sedation at the time of discharge, four hours postoperatively. These effects are consistent with the greater potency and more rapid onset of action of midazolam at this dose compared with triazolam. The relative merits of the compounds as anxiolytics varied depending upon the observer, time and method of assessment. It was considered that the doses of midazolam and triazolam used were excessive for routine day case anaesthesia.", 
    "67": "The outstanding success of H2-blocking agents in ulcer therapy proves gastric acid as a dominating factor in the pathogenesis of ulcers. Motility disturbances can be demonstrated in ulcer patients but up to now in therapeutic terms played only a minor role. The therapeutic success of the antimuscarinic drug pirenzepine which inhibits only gastric secretory volume without influencing gastric pH but exerting a significant influence on interdigestive motility of the upper gastrointestinal tract reestablishes this factor to be of pathogenetic relevance. The pathophysiological factor of motility disturbances in the etiology of gastric ulcers is stressed also by the results of a recent therapeutic study comparing ranitidine and cisapride, where the motility-stimulating benzamide showed exactly the same rate of success as the H2-blocker; this holds true for both healing rate and symptomatic improvement. Therefore as far as chronic gastric ulcer is concerned a combination therapy should be preferred thus avoiding the side-effects of a strong and long lasting suppression of gastric acid secretion.", 
    "68": "Mice of four inbred strains (BALB, C57BL, DBA and C3H) were administered either saline or oxotremorine, a muscarinic agonist, at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/hr by constant infusion through cannulas implanted in the right jugular veins. Chronic treatment resulted in the development of tolerance to the effects of oxotremorine both on rotarod performance and on body temperature. For drug-treated BALB mice, the dose-response curves for both measures were parallel to those for saline-treated mice, while for DBA and C3H mice the slopes of the dose-response curves were significantly less for treated mice than they were for controls. The equi-effective doses for the drug-treated animals were at least 8-fold greater than those for saline-treated mice. Drug treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the total number of muscarinic receptors in cortex as measured by the binding of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) without effect on the KD for this ligand. Similarly, drug treatment did not affect the affinity of carbamylcholine as an inhibitor of QNB binding, but did significantly decrease the levels of both the high- and low-affinity agonist binding sites in cortex. The number of M1 muscarinic receptors measured by high affinity [3H]pirenzepine (PZ) binding was also significantly decreased in cortex without effect on the KD. The experiments were extended to five other brain regions. Full saturation curves were not constructed, however. Oxotremorine treatment significantly reduced QNB binding in every brain region. While the binding to agonist affinity states measured by carbamylcholine inhibition of QNB binding and M1 receptor levels measured by high affinity PZ binding tended to decrease with oxotremorine treatment not all changes were statistically significant. The changes in muscarinic receptor subtype levels induced by oxotremorine infusion did not differ among the strains. The results demonstrate that chronic treatment with a muscarinic agonist results in substantial tolerance to the effects of the drug in all four mouse strains. Although some differences in tolerance development exist, these differences are not readily explained by differences in the number or affinity states of brain muscarinic receptors.", 
    "69": "In children painful diagnostic and therapeutic investigations require sedation and sometimes local anaesthesia. We tested Midazolam, a new benzodiazepine, for its sedative effect. Midazolam is the first derivate of imidabenzodiazepine and is remarkable for its rapid effect and a short half-life. It has good hypnotic, anxiolytic and amnesic properties. Sleep sets in immediately after intravenous application of Midazolam, and all patients reported anterograde amnesia afterwards. Over 24 months we observed 266 children who had been given Midazolam as a basic sedative before painful investigations. For sleep induction Midazolam was given in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg in children older than 6 years and 0.4 mg/kg in children younger than 6 years. The maximal dose was 15 mg. All patients fell asleep and did not remember anything about the procedure. In 30 patients pulse, blood pressure and respiration rate were measured before and after application of Midazolam. The quality of sleep was determined by the Glasgow-Coma-Scale. We did not observe any side effects.", 
    "70": "This study was designed to determine whether the severity of liver dysfunction in cirrhosis affects the kinetics and next-day effects of triazolam after bedtime administration of a single oral dose. Eight patients with biopsy-proven cirrhosis and seven normal subjects matched for age, weight, and sex participated as paid volunteers. The first night was the control night, when no nighttime sedative was administered. The next day, psychomotor testing was performed at 8:30 AM, 2 PM, and 5 PM. Triazolam 0.25 mg was administered at 10:30 PM that evening. Psychomotor testing was repeated on the posttriazolam day in the same manner as on the control day. Blood samples were obtained from a venous catheter at 11 predetermined times in the 14 hours after triazolam administration. Memory testing was also performed. Apparent oral clearance of triazolam was directly related to albumin concentration and indocyanine-green elimination rate constant, and inversely related to partial thromboplastin time expressed as seconds over control. Clearance was 6.69 +/- 2.52 mL/min/kg in the normal subjects and 4.99 +/- 3.14 in the subjects with cirrhosis. There were no significant differences in Cmax between normal subjects (1.43 +/- 0.44 ng/mL) and subjects with cirrhosis (1.62 +/- 0.31 ng/mL) or in tmax (2.0 +/- 1.0 vs 2.5 +/- 1.9 hr) between normal and cirrhosis subjects, respectively. Posttriazolam, cirrhotic subjects took significantly longer to sort cards at 8:30 AM than on the control day. There was a significant correlation between extent of impairment on 8:30 AM card sorting by suit and AUC0-8 (r = 0.687; P = 0.0046).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "71": "Serum binding of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) was studied by equilibrium dialysis. In therapeutic concentrations, 8-MOP binding in serum was high, 91.4%, and constant, indicating concentration-independent kinetics. This binding involved the two main proteins, human serum albumin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, in a saturable process with one class of binding sites (n) and affinity constants (Ka) of 1.295 X 10(4) mol/l and 2.115 X 10(4) mol/l, respectively. Binding to lipoproteins and gamma globulins was negligible and non-saturable in therapeutic concentrations, with nKa values of 0.35, 0.024, 0.013 and 0.0004 mumol/l for VLDL, LDL, HDL and gamma globulins, respectively. Inhibition of 8-MOP serum binding was observed with salicylic acid and indomethacin, but not with diazepam, warfarin or erythromycin. Over a range of therapeutic concentrations, the ration of 8-MOP concentration in red blood cells (RBCs) and in serum was constant at 20.3% and three times higher than would be expected if a simple diffusion of the 8-MOP plasma free fraction (fu) occurred. According to the measured and calculated parameters, simulations of 8-MOP blood binding in pathological states (hypoalbuminaemia with or without inflammation) showed variations of fu which were partially 'buffered' by RBCs. Simulation of 8-MOP protein binding at cutaneous interstitial fluid level showed that fu is approximately 30% and permitted prediction of a decrease of fu available to the epidermis in case of local or systemic inflammation. This may imply an increase in the minimum phototoxic dose relevant for PUVA and explain some cases of 'poor' responsiveness of psoriatic patients to PUVA therapy.", 
    "72": "Platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine or AGEPC) is a potent phospholipid mediator elaborated by a variety of mammalian cells. CV-3988 (a unique structural analog of AGEPC), L-652731 (a lignan derivative of a natural product) and two triazolobenzodiazepines (triazolam and alprazolam) were evaluated for their ability to selectively antagonize aggregation and secretion responses in washed, [3H]serotonin-labeled rabbit platelets stimulated with graded doses of AGEPC. When 0.2 nM AGEPC was used as the stimulus, the concentration of antagonist needed for 50% inhibition (IC50) of secretion was obtained at 0.05 uM, 0.15 uM, 0.6 uM and 2.5 uM, for L-652732, CV-3988, triazolam and alprazolam, respectively. The corresponding IC50 values for aggregation were obtained at 0.2 uM, 0.1 uM, 1.5 uM and 6.5 uM, respectively. The inhibitory effects could be overcome by increasing the amount of AGEPC used to stimulate the platelets. Of the four compounds tested, L-652731 was the most potent antagonist of AGEPC-induced activation of washed rabbit platelets.", 
    "73": "The effect of diazepam on brain 5-HT-mediated neuroendocrine responses was studied in healthy male volunteers. An acute dose of diazepam (15 mg) significantly attenuated the prolactin and growth hormone responses to intravenous L-tryptophan. After 3 weeks administration of diazepam (25 mg/d) these responses had returned to normal despite much higher plasma diazepam concentrations, suggesting that tolerance had occurred. A reduction in brain 5-HT function may underlie some of the acute therapeutic actions of benzodiazepines. It is possible that excessive 'rebound' 5-HT activity may contribute to the abstinence syndrome seen on benzodiazepine withdrawal.", 
    "74": "1 Athletes may use benzodiazepines before events to improve sleep, but these drugs may adversely affect performance. 2 Nitrazepam (10 mg) and temazepam (30 mg) were compared with placebo in 27 physical education students, (14 males, 13 females). Treatments were administered at night, using a double-blind, double dummy protocol, for 9 nights. Observations were made in the morning after night 2 and night 9. At least 2 weeks interval was allowed between each treatment. 3 At each examination lung mechanics were measured, a Leeds Sleep Evaluation Questionnaire completed, recognition reaction time, choice reaction time and the critical flicker fusion threshold test were used to assess psychomotor activity and an exercise test was performed. The subject exercised to exhaustion on a bicycle ergometer while ventilation, gas exchange and heart rate were recorded on an FM tape unit for off-line digital analysis. 4 The questionnaire indicated that both drugs were equally effective in promoting and maintaining sleep, but nitrazepam had a marked 'hangover' effect. The psychomotor activity and lung mechanics however seemed unaffected. On day 2, maximum exercise levels attained using either drug were comparable to placebo whilst on day 9 temazepam and placebo were significantly higher than nitrazepam. 5 Heart rate was significantly increased at each exercise level with both drugs. 6 Although there may be some effect of these drugs on athletic performance this is likely to be small especially with temazepam.", 
    "75": "In various anxiolytic tests, benzodiazepines produce a maximal anxiolytic response only upon repeated treatment. The question arises as to whether repeated treatment produces an increase in anxiolytic efficacy or a decrease in another benzodiazepine-mediated effect (i.e., muscle relaxation/sedation) that functions to attenuate the full expression of the anxiolytic response. To address this issue, rats were pretreated in their home cages with either vehicle, diazepam or CGS 9896 (a nonsedating, non-muscle relaxant partial benzodiazepine agonist with anxiolytic efficacy) and challenged, 7 days later, with either diazepam or CGS 9896 in either a conflict (anxiolytic efficacy) or a rotorod (muscle relaxant/sedative effects) procedure. Rats who first experienced diazepam in the test situation (vehicle home cage pretreatment) showed only a moderate anxiolytic response and a compromised motor response. Pretreatment with diazepam in the home cage produced a tolerance to the motor-decreasing effects of diazepam and induced a maximal anxiolytic effect upon first challenge with diazepam in the test situation. CGS 9896, on the other hand, produced a maximal anxiolytic effect regardless of home cage pretreatment. Home cage pretreatment with CGS 9896 did not obviate the muscle relaxant/sedative or submaximal anxiolytic effects of diazepam, suggesting that repeated exposure to an anxiolytic effect is not the underlying basis for the repeated benzodiazepine treatment phenomenon. Rather, the motor-impairing effects of the benzodiazepines cause the submaximal response noted upon first exposure to these drugs in the anxiolytic test situation. This effect tolerates, leaving the expression of the maximal response.", 
    "76": "A case of episodic delirium with incapacitating myoclonus associated with therapeutic doses of phenelzine is described. No evidence of epilepsy was found. The delirium and the myoclonus remitted rapidly after phenelzine was stopped and treatment with a benzodiazepine was started. No previous reports of the association of phenelzine with myoclonus and delirium have been found. The possible neurophysiology of the association is explored. Treatment with phenelzine should be reviewed if myoclonus occurs.", 
    "77": "The effects of unilateral intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, a potent neuroexcitant and neurotoxin, on subsequent susceptibility to kindling of the contralateral hippocampus or contralateral amygdala were investigated in albino rats. At the chosen doses (0.20 to 1.25 micrograms dissolved in physiologic saline), the kainic acid-induced lesion was confined to the injected hippocampus and in two cases the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex; never were there contralateral lesions. Approximately 2 to 6 weeks post-injection, each animal received daily afterdischarge-producing electrical stimulations until stage 5 kindled limbic seizures occurred. Kindling in pretreated animals was significantly accelerated compared with controls; the hippocampal kindling rate decreased from 13.2 stimulations to 3.7, the amygdala kindling rate from 7.8 stimulations to 3.0. Many treated animals had first-stimulation stage 5 seizures, compared with none for controls. Importantly, this facilitation of kindling was not reversed by suppression of the acute, induced seizures with the anticonvulsants, diazepam and phenobarbital, which have repeatedly been demonstrated to effectively suppress limbic kindling. Such results, considered together with findings from the literature, suggest that partial kindling does not occur during kainic acid-induced seizures, and that the observed susceptibility to kindling and other epileptogenic agents subsequent to kainic acid treatment may in fact be related to neurophysiologic and neurochemical consequences of kainic acid-induced lesions.", 
    "78": "The elimination of diazepam and antipyrine and the urinary excretion of their metabolites were investigated in 21 healthy volunteers before and after 7 days of administration of antipyrine, 1200 mg, and rifampin, 600 or 1200 mg. After administration of antipyrine and rifampin in two doses, antipyrine total body clearance increased by 53% and 60% or 98%, respectively. The clearance to metabolite showed a preferential induction of the norantipyrine pathway with different proportions after antipyrine and rifampin; rifampin, 1200 mg, also enhanced the 4-hydroxyantipyrine pathway further. After antipyrine, diazepam total body clearance was increased by 102%, affecting all metabolic pathways to a similar extent. After rifampin in both doses, diazepam total body clearance rose equally to 300% and desmethyl- and 3-hydroxydiazepam metabolic clearance to 400%. Therefore rifampin preferentially affects norantipyrine or desmethyl- and 3-hydroxydiazepam metabolic formation, suggesting induction of different (iso)zymes of cytochrome P-450.", 
    "79": "The effects of midazolam on atrial rate and contractile force in the isolated canine atrium perfused with donor blood were investigated. When midazolam in a dose range of 100-1000 micrograms was injected directly into the sinus node artery of the isolated atrium, biphasic (negative followed by positive) chronotropic and triphasic (positive, negative followed by positive) inotropic effects were induced. After propranolol or imipramine, the positive chronotropic and the secondary positive inotropic effects were significantly suppressed, but the initial positive inotropic effect was not affected. Tetrodotoxin, atropine, or R05-4864, a selective ligand for peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites, did not modify midazolam-induced effects. When midazolam in a dose of 0.1-1 mg/kg was administered intravenously to the donor dog, monophasic negative chronotropic and inotropic effects in the isolated atrium were observed but were not as prominent. We conclude that midazolam has direct cardiac inhibitory properties including catecholamine release due to a tyramine-like action.",
