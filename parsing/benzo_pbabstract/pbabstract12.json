Duplications on 16p11.2 and 22q11.2 were previously implicated in psychiatric disorders, but not in catatonia, and were therefore considered likely pathogenic. Driven by the identification of a rare 14q11.2 duplication in one catatonic patient, additional patients with overlapping duplications were gathered to delineate a novel susceptibility locus for intellectual disability and psychiatric disorders on 14q11.2, harboring the gene SUPT16H.

    "19": "Excited delirium syndrome (ExDS) is defined by marked agitation and confusion with sympathomimetic surge and incessant physical struggle, despite futility, which may lead to profound pathophysiologic changes and sudden death. Severe metabolic derangements, including lactic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, and hyperthermia, occur. The pathophysiology of excited delirium is a subject of ongoing basic science and clinical research. Positive associations with ExDS include male gender, mental health disorders, and substance abuse (especially sympathomimetics). Excited delirium syndrome patients often exhibit violent, psychotic behavior and have \"superhuman\" strength which can result in the patient fighting with police and first responders. Continued struggle can cause a patient with ExDS to experience elevated temperature (T) and acidosis which causes enzymes to fail, leading to sudden death from cardiovascular collapse and multi-system organ failure. Therefore, effective early sedation is optimal to stop this fulminant process. Treatment of ExDS must be focused on rapidly, safely, and effectively sedating the patient and providing intensive, supportive care. Benzodiazepines, like midazolam, may not be ideal to sedate ExDS patients since their onset takes several minutes, and their side effects include loss of airway control and respiratory depression. Injectable antipsychotic medications have a relatively slow onset and may cause prolongation of the QTc interval. Ketamine is the ideal medication to sedate patients with ExDS. Ketamine has a rapid, predictable onset within three to four minutes when given by intramuscular (IM) injection. It does not adversely affect airway control, breathing, heart rate, or blood pressure (BP). In this retrospective case series, prehospital scenarios in which ExDS patients received ketamine by paramedics for sedation, and their subsequent treatment in the emergency department (ED) and hospital, are described. It is demonstrated that ketamine administered by paramedics in the prehospital setting of a community hospital based Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system is a safe and effective treatment for ExDS.

    "21": "Using a comprehensive checklist for a successful guideline enterprise, we conducted a national modified Delphi consensus process to identify priorities for deprescribing guidelines, then conducted scoping exercises to identify feasible topics, and sequentially developed three deprescribing guidelines. We selected guideline development team members for clinical expertise; a GRADE member worked with staff to ensure guideline development processes were followed. We conducted or used systematic searches and reviews of deprescribing trials of selected drug classes, reviews or systematic reviews of drug class effectiveness, reviews of reviews of drug class harm and narrative syntheses of contextual questions to inform recommendations and guideline development. Our 8 step process for guideline development included defining scope and purpose, developing a logic model to guide the process and generate key clinical questions, setting criteria for admissible evidence and conducting systematic reviews, synthesizing evidence considering additional contextual information and performing quality estimates, formulating recommendations and providing strength estimations, adding clinical considerations, conducting clinical and stakeholder review and finally updating content pre-publication. Innovative aspects of the guideline development process included synthesizing evidence for outcomes of tapering or stopping medication, and incorporating evidence for medication harm into the recommendation strength rating.

This study was designed to investigate the alterations of major hepatic cytochrome P450s and UDP-glucuronyltransferase enzymes in db/db mice. Mouse liver microsomes (MLMs) were obtained from male db/db mice and their wild type littermates. After incubation of the substrates separately with MLMs, the samples were pooled and analysed by high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system for the simultaneous study of nine phase I metabolic reactions and three glucuronidation conjugation reactions to determine the activity of the metabolic enzymes. Compared with normal controls, the Clint estimate for testosterone-6\u03b2-hydroxylation was lower (46%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while the Vmax and Clint estimates for propofol O-glucuronidation were 5-fold higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the liver microsomes from db/db mice.

Objective We aimed (1) to determine PIP prevalence in older nursing home (NH) residents with polypharmacy using the GheOP\u00b3S-tool and (2) to identify those PIPs that are most frequently detected. Method A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and June 2014 in 10 NHs in Belgium, supplied by a community pharmacy chain. For each NH, 40 residents (\u226570\u00a0years, using \u22655 chronic drugs) were included. PIP prevalence was determined using the GheOP\u00b3S-tool. Results 400 NH residents were included [mean age (\u00b1SD) 86.2 (\u00b16.3) years; median number of drugs (\u00b1IQR) 10 (7-12)]. A total of 1728 PIPs were detected in 387 (97\u00a0%) participants (Median 4; IQR 2-6). The most prevalent items can be assigned to three categories: long-term use of central nervous system drugs (i.e. benzodiazepines, antidepressants and antipsychotics), use of anticholinergic drugs (mutual combinations and with underlying constipation/dementia) and underuse of osteoporosis prophylaxis. Conclusion Screening for PIP by means of the GheOP\u00b3S-tool revealed a high prevalence of PIP among older NH residents with polypharmacy.

The present study aimed to evaluate the behavioral effects and dependence liability of these drugs using conditioned place preference and self-administration paradigms in rodents. Additionally, biochemical techniques were used to assess the substance-induced alterations in synaptosome-released dopamine. While both of the tested substances elicited increases in conditioned place preference and dopamine, neither of them facilitated self-administration, suggesting that 5-APB and phenazepam have rewarding effects, rather than reinforcing effects.", 
    "43": "The atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine remains one of most effective treatments for schizophrenia, given a lack of extrapyramidal side effects, improvements in negative symptoms, cognitive impairment, and in symptoms in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. The adverse effects of clozapine, including agranulocytosis, make finding a safe clozapine-like a drug a goal for drug developers. The drug discrimination paradigm is a model of interoceptive stimulus that has been used in an effort to screen experimental drugs for clozapine-like atypical antipsychotic effects. The present study was conducted to elucidate the receptor-mediated stimulus properties that form this clozapine discriminative cue by testing selective receptor ligands in rats trained to discriminate a 1.25mg/kg dose of clozapine from vehicle in a two choice drug discrimination task. Full substitution occurred with the 5-HT2A inverse agonist M100907 and the two preferential D4/5-HT2/\u03b11 receptor antagonists Lu 37-114 ((S)-1-(3-(2-(4-(1H-indol-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)indolin-1-yl)ethan-1-one) and Lu 37-254 (1-(3-(4-(1H-indol-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one). Partial substitution occurred with the D4 receptor antagonist Lu 38-012 and the \u03b11 adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. Drugs selective for 5-HT2C, 5-HT6 muscarinic, histamine H1, and benzodiazepine receptors did not substitute for clozapine. The present findings suggest that 5-HT2A inverse agonism and D4 receptor antagonism mediate the discriminative stimulus properties of 1.25mg/kg clozapine in rats, and further confirm that clozapine produces a complex compound discriminative stimulus.",

A retrospective, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on outpatients' prescriptions in Khorasan Razavi province, Iran, over 12 months. A list of 25 clinically relevant DDIs, which are likely to occur in the outpatient setting, was used as the reference. Most frequent clinically relevant pDDIs, most common drugs contributing to the pDDIs, and the pattern of pDDIs for each medical specialty were determined. Descriptive statistics were used to report the results. In total, out of 8,169,142 prescriptions, 6,096 clinically relevant pDDIs were identified. The most common identified pDDIs were theophyllines-quinolones, warfarin-nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, benzodiazepines-azole antifungal agents, and anticoagulants-thyroid hormones. The most common drugs contributing to the identified pDDIs were ciprofloxacin, theophylline, warfarin, aminophylline, alprazolam, levothyroxine, and selegiline. While the incidence rate of clinically relevant pDDIs in prescriptions of general practitioners, internists, and cardiologists was the highest, the average pDDI incidence per 10,000 prescriptions of pulmonologists, infectious disease specialists, and cardiologists was highest. Although a small proportion of the analyzed prescriptions contained drug pairs with potential for clinically relevant DDIs, a significant number of outpatients have been exposed to the adverse effects associated with these interactions.

    "67": "Midazolam, fentanyl, and propofol are commonly used for sedation in modern anesthesia practice. These agents possess characteristics that have afforded various anesthetics to be delivered and produce relatively safe and effective outcomes. However, each agent has certain drawbacks in clinical practice. Remimazolam, a novel benzodiazepine created out of so-called soft drug development, is an ultrashort-acting intravenous sedative-hypnotic currently being investigated in clinical trials. In this review, we evaluate the recent literature on the use of remimazolam in clinical practice as compared with current sedative agents, and we describe its potential roles for use in sedation. A literature search of the Medline database (2012-May 2016) was performed. Additional references were identified from a review of literature citations, manufacturer reports, and professional meeting abstracts. All premarket studies involving remimazolam as the primary study drug were evaluated. Literature describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of remimazolam, propofol, and midazolam was also included. Phase I and II studies in the United States have shown remimazolam to be a safe and effective option for procedural sedation. Unlike midazolam and propofol, remimazolam undergoes organ-independent metabolism to an inactive metabolite. Because remimazolam follows first-order pharmacokinetics, prolonged infusions or higher doses are unlikely to result in accumulation and\u00a0extended effect, making it favorable for use as an intravenous anesthetic and for sedation in the intensive care unit. It is expected that phase III trials will further describe the niche that remimazolam\u00a0may be able to occupy in clinical practice. Postmarket cost-benefit analyses will need to be performed.",

    "71": "The relatively common view indicates a possible dissociation between the anxiolytic and sedative/hypnotic properties of benzodiazepines (BZs). Indeed, GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subtypes have specific cerebral distribution in distinct neural circuits. Thus, GABAAR subtype-selective drugs may be expected to perform distinct functions. However, standard behavioral test assays provide limited direction towards highlighting new action mechanisms of ligands targeting GABAARs. Automated behavioral tests, lack sensitivity as some behavioral characteristics or subtle behavioral changes of drug effects or that are not considered in the overall analysis (Ohl et al., 2001) and observation-based analyses are not always performed. In addition, despite the use of genetically engineered mice, any possible dissociation between the anxiolytic and sedative properties of BZs remains controversial. Moreover, the involvement the different subtypes of GABAAR subtypes in the anxious behavior and the mechanism of action of anxiolytic agents remains unclear since there has been little success in the pharmacological investigations so far. This raises the question of the involvement of the different subunits in anxiolytic-like and/or sedative effects; and the actual implication of these subunits, particularly, \u03b1-subunits in the modulation of sedation and/or anxiety-related disorders. This present review was prompted by several conflicting studies on the degree of involvement of these subunits in anxiolytic-like and/or sedative effects. To this end, we explored the GABAergic system, particularly, the role of different subunits containing synaptic GABAARs. We report herein the targeting gene encoding the different subunits and their contribution in anxiolytic-like and/or sedative actions, as well as, the mechanism underlying tolerance to BZs.",

A total of 5664 participants who enrolled in the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST) were included in the study. Multiple logistic regression was applied to investigate the association of depression, psychotropic medication use, and mental illness, separately, with cardiovascular disease. The results suggested that cardiovascular disease was significantly associated with various definitions of depression, including: the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale (CES-D)\u200a\u2265\u200a16, self-reported, and physician-diagnosed for depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u200a=\u200a1.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.00 for CES-D; AOR\u200a=\u200a3.29; 95% CI: 1.99-5.42 for self-reported; and AOR\u200a=\u200a2.45; 95% CI: 1.51-3.97 for physician-diagnosed). Additionally, significant associations of cardiovascular disease with the use of antipsychotics (AOR\u200a=\u200a2.04; 95% CI: 1.25-3.34), benzodiazepines (BZDs) (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.84; 95% CI: 1.52-2.21), and Z-drugs (AOR\u200a=\u200a1.41; 95% CI: 1.03-1.93), respectively, were also observed, but not the use of antidepressants. In addition, a significant association of cardiovascular disease with mental illness was found in this study (AOR\u200a=\u200a2.33; 95% CI: 1.68-3.24). In line with previous reports, these findings provided supportive evidence that depression and/or mental illness were significantly associated with cardiovascular disease in a community-dwelling elderly population in Taiwan. Moreover, significant associations of cardiovascular disease with the use of antipsychotics, BZDs, and Z-drugs, individually, were found. Further investigation would be of importance to clarify the causal relationship of depression and/or psychotropic medications with cardiovascular disease, especially among elderly populations.",

The optimal thresholds for R d and R a (R dth and R ath) were estimated by comparing the results with those of previous drug interaction studies for six drugs. Four drug interaction risk categories for 68 drugs at each dose interval were defined according to the indices of dissolution and absorption against their thresholds.",

During the same period, analysis of STRIDA project samples confirmed 3-FPM use in a total of 19 patients (84% men) aged 22-54 (median 30) years. 3-FPM was detected in 15 out of 19 serum (2.7-1416\u2009ng/mL) and in 14 out of 14 urine (1.0-6857\u2009\u03bcg/mmol creatinine) samples. All patients were also tested positive for other psychoactive substances, with benzodiazepines being most common (57% of the cases). Ten patients were monitored in the ED for <4\u2009h, while six needed ICU monitoring of which five were graded as severe intoxications (Poisoning Severity Score 3). Prominent clinical signs were tachycardia (47%), depressed consciousness (42%), agitation/anxiety (37%), delirium (37%), dilated pupils (26%), and seizures (16%). All patients survived.",

These results emphasize the importance of performing bioanalytical investigation in cases of suspected NPS intoxication.", 
    "81": "Daily life events confront us with new situations demanding responses to usual and unusual rules. Diazepam (DZ), a clinically important drug, facilitates the inhibitory activity of the GABAergic system. Prefrontal cortex, rich in DZ receptors, coordinates necessary resources to direct actions according to rules. The balance between excitatory and inhibitory activity is critical to achieve optimal function of brain systems leading to complex functions. Major sex differences in the physiological mechanisms of the GABAergic system have been reported. However, the differential influence of DZ on men and women in neural activity during behavior directed by frontal lobes remains unexplored. The ability of healthy volunteers to select responses following usual/congruent and novel/incongruent rules, and brain correlates were measured with fMRI under the administration of DZ and a placebo. 10\u00a0mg of DZ was enough to decrease the performance in a different manner between men and women. While reaction times increased in both men and women, women committed more errors selecting responses than men under DZ. Men demonstrated increased activity, while women demonstrated decreased activity in frontal regions involved in response selection of rules. These findings could have important consequences in understanding the differential influences of DZ between the sexes in complex daily life situations. More importantly, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the differential effects on men and women of drugs widely employed by society, thereby achieves better therapeutic results and avoids side effects that the present study revealed to be different between sexes.", 
    "82": "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder worldwide and anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are always the first choice for treatment. However, more than 50% of patients with epilepsy who take AEDs have reported bone abnormalities. Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzymes are induced by AEDs, especially the classical AEDs, such as benzodiazepines (BZDs), carbamazepine (CBZ), phenytoin (PT), phenobarbital (PB), and valproic acid (VPA). The induction of CYP450 isoenzymes may cause vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, increased fracture risks, and altered bone turnover, leading to impaired bone mineral density (BMD). Newer AEDs, such as levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (OXC), lamotrigine (LTG), topiramate (TPM), gabapentin (GP), and vigabatrin (VB) have broader spectra, and are safer and better tolerated than the classical AEDs. The effects of AEDs on bone health are controversial. This review focuses on the impact of AEDs on growth and bone metabolism and emphasizes the need for caution and timely withdrawal of these medications to avoid serious disabilities.", 
    "83": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system, is also known to be important for brain development. Therefore, disturbances of GABA receptor (GABA-R) mediated signaling (GABA-R signal) during brain development may influence normal brain maturation and cause late-onset brain malfunctions. In this study, we examined whether the stimulation of the GABA-R signal during brain development induces late-onset adverse effects on the brain in adult male mice. To stimulate the GABA-R signal, we used either the benzodiazepine sleep-inducing drug triazolam (TZ) or the non-benzodiazepine drug zolpidem (ZP). We detected learning and memory deficits in mice treated with TZ during the juvenile period, as seen in the fear conditioning test. On the other hand, ZP administration during the juvenile period had little effect. In addition, decreased protein expression of GluR1 and GluR4, which are excitatory neurotransmitter receptors, was detected in the hippocampi of mice treated with TZ during the juvenile period. We measured mRNA expression of the immediate early genes (IEGs), which are neuronal activity markers, in the hippocampus shortly after the administration of TZ or ZP to juvenile mice. Decreased IEG expression was detected in mice with juvenile TZ administration, but not in mice with juvenile ZP administration. Our findings demonstrate that TZ administration during the juvenile period can induce irreversible learning and memory deficits in adult mice. It may need to take an extra care for the prescription of benzodiazepine sleep-inducing drugs to juveniles because it might cause learning and memory deficits.",

Mice were treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with saline, RA (2 or 4\u00a0mg/kg), or CA (4 or 8\u00a0mg/kg) alone or associated to low-dose DZP. After, mice received a single dose of PTZ (88\u00a0mg/kg) or PIL (250\u00a0mg/kg) and were monitored for the percentage of seizures and the latency to first seizure (LFS) >3\u00a0s.

The alkaline comet assay was performed after acute seizure tests to evaluate the antigenotoxic profiles of RA and CA. The doses of RA and CA tested alone did not reduce the occurrence of seizures induced by PTZ or PIL. The association of 4\u00a0mg/kg RA + low-dose DZP was shown to increase LFS in the PTZ model, compared to the group that received only the DZP. In the DZP-induced sleeping time test, the latency to sleep was reduced by 4\u00a0mg/kg RA and 8\u00a0mg/kg CA. The PTZ-induced genotoxic damage was not prevented by RA or CA, but the PIL-induced genotoxic damage was decreased by pretreatment with 4\u00a0mg/kg RA (in cortex) and 4\u00a0mg/kg CA (in hippocampus). In conclusion, RA and CA presented neuroprotective effect against PIL-induced genotoxic damage and reduced the latency to DZP-induced sleep. Of the rosmarinic acid, 4\u00a0mg/kg enhanced the DZP effect in the increase of latency to clonic PTZ-induced seizures.",

Patients may have acute episodes of insomnia related to a traumatic event, but more commonly insomnia occurs chronically. While proper sleep hygiene and behavioral therapy play important roles in the nonpharmacologic management of short-term and chronic insomnia, medications may also be required. Historically, insomnia has been treated with agents such as benzodiazepines, nonbenzodiazepine receptor agonists, and melatonin agonists. Dual orexin receptor antagonists represent a new class of medications for the treatment of insomnia, which block the binding of wakefulness-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their respective receptor sites. Suvorexant (Belsomra) is the first dual orexin receptor antagonist to be approved in the US and Japan and has demonstrated efficacy in decreasing time to sleep onset and increasing total sleep time. Its unique mechanism of action, data to support efficacy and safety over 12 months of use, and relative lack of withdrawal effects when discontinued may represent an alternative for patients with chronic insomnia who cannot tolerate or do not receive benefit from more traditional sleep agents. Suvorexant is effective and well tolerated, but precautions exist for certain patient populations, including females, obese patients, and those with respiratory disease. Suvorexant has only been studied vs placebo, and hence it is unknown how it directly compares with other medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia. Suvorexant is not likely to replace benzodiazepines or nonbenzodiazepine receptor antagonists as a first-line sleep agent but does represent a novel option for the treatment of patients with chronic insomnia.",

As a result, abnormal thyroid gland function and in particular hypofunction, might cause principally depression and neurocognitive dysfunction. Psychosis, presented mainly with thought disorders and perceptual disturbances, is a much rarer manifestation of hypothyreoidism. A correlation between hypothyreoidism and psychosis has been described since 1888, especially in cases of advanced hypothyreoidism. A few years later (1949), Asher first added the terminology \"myxedema madness\" to the literature. Psychotic symptoms typically appear after the onset of physical symptoms, usually with a delay of months or years. The case of a female patient who presented a psychotic episode as a first manifestation of hypothyroidism will be described. NE, a 48 yearold female patient, was admitted for the first time to an inpatient mental health care unit due to delusions of persecution and reference, as well as auditory hallucinations that appeared a few weeks ago. After the patient admission, routine laboratory examination was conducted. In order to relieve the patient from her sense of discomfort and while awaiting laboratory results, olanzapine, 5 mg/day, was administered. Neurological examination and cranial computed tomography scan were unremarkable. Hormonal laboratory tests though revealed severe low thyroid hormone levels. Thyroid antibody testing certified Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Olanzapine was discontinued and the patient received thyroid hormone substitution, levothyroxine 75 \u03bcg/day, instead. The patient was discharged showing a significant improvement of psychotic symptoms after a 12-day hospitalization. A month later the patient was reevaluated. She had fully recovered from the psychotic episode. A year later, the patient continues to remain free from psychiatric symptoms, while thyroid hormone levels have been restored within normal range. The patient continues receiving only thyroid hormone substitution therapy with levothyroxine. Cases of acute psychosis associated with low levels of thyroid hormones in the context of primary hypothyreoidism have been repeatedly reported. The present case report emphasizes the importance of hypothyroidism exclusion as a secondary cause of psychosis. Thyroid disease treatment ameliorates psychotic disorder symptoms and recovers patients' mental condition.", 
    "155": "The gender based or gender sensitive pharmacology is a new research area. Differences among sexes are observed in several parameters of their pharmacokinetic which may relate to alteration of their pharmacodynamic as well. Most psychotropics are given per os, and the greater part of their absorption takes place in the small intestine. Premenopausal women have slower gastric emptying times and lower gastrointestinal blood flow which probably reduces the extent of drug absorption. The distribution of drugs is influenced by the relative lower body mass index, the lower blood volume and flow and the greater percentage of body fat of women. Further, the elimination and renal clearance is reduced in women and the hepatic metabolism differ between sexes. Besides, women differ from men in physiological conditions which may have an impact on the psychotropic medication and dosage required for efficacy and response. Women are exposed to monthly hormonal fluctuations (menstruation), pregnancy, puerperium, menopause and use of contraceptives or synthetic hormonal replacement therapies. Throughout of these conditions changes may occur in total body water, in renal clearance, cardiovascular and autoimmune system, which may cause fluctuations in the activity of the psychotropics, changes in the central neurotransmitters, in the number and sensitivity of the receptors, and the general metabolism as well. Despite the fact that women are the primer consumers of psychotropic medication, taking more psychotropics as well as more multiple medications than men, little attention has been paid to sex differences in psychopharmacology. Till recently women were under-represented or excluded from most of the pharmacological clinical trials. The treatment guidelines for psychotropic medication are based on studies verified and investigated almost exclusively in men. Results from such studies were generalized and recommended for use in the clinical practice without any critique and justification between the sexes. In conclusion, women compared to men, tend to have a greater bioavailability and slower elimination of drugs leading to higher concentrations of free circulating drugs in serum and causing more side effects and adverse reactions to the psychotropic medication than men do. In general, women require lower doses of antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines than men. For safety and efficacy reasons and despite the fact that research is still being carried out to determine the exact differences in pharmacodynamic of several psychotropics between genders, the clinician must be aware of the reported effect of the recommended medications on serum levels and organ tissues both for men and women.", 
    "156": "Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine that is commonly prescribed for the treatment of anxiety and other related disorders. Like other benzodiazepines, it is thought to exert its effect through interaction with GABAA receptors. However, it has also been described as a potent and selective protein interaction inhibitor of bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins. Indeed, the only crystal structure of alprazolam bound to a protein is a complex between alprazolam and the BRD4 bromodomain. The structure shows that the complex also involves many water interactions that mediate contacts between the drug and the protein, a scenario that exists in many drug-protein complexes. How such waters relate to solvation patterns of small molecules may improve our understanding of what dictates their appearance or absence in bridging positions within complexes and thus will be important in terms of future rational drug-design. Here, we use neutron diffraction in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations to provide a detailed analysis of how water molecules interact with alprazolam in methanol/water mixtures.

Inter-assay precision (RSD) and accuracy (relative error) were <15% and 13 to 5%, respectively, for all compounds at concentrations equal to or higher than the lower limit of quantification. Extraction recoveries were between 58 and 76% (RSD\u2009<\u20098%), except for tetrahydrocannabinol and three 7-amino benzodiazepine metabolites with recoveries between 23 and 33% (RSD between 51 and 52 % and 11 and 25%, respectively). Ion enhancement or ion suppression effects were observed for a few compounds; however, to a large degree they were compensated for by the internal standards used. Deuterium-labelled and (13) C-labelled internal standards were used for 8 and 11 of the compounds, respectively.

Objectives\u2003To evaluate the effects of the pASP in mechanically ventilated postsurgical children regarding drug dosage, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and rate of withdrawal symptoms. Methods\u2003This is a two-phase prospective observational control study. The preimplementation group was managed by the physician's order and the postimplementation group was managed with the pASP including COMFORT-B, nurse interpretation of sedation, and Sophia observation withdrawal symptoms scale scoring. Measurements and Main Results\u2003One hundred and sixteen patients were included before and one hundred and ten patients after implementation.

    "193": "Oesophageal cancer ranks as the sixth most common malignancy in the world, and recent evidence has shown that its incidence is increasing. ACBPs (Acyl-coA binding proteins) act as intracellular carrier-proteins for medium to long chain acyl-coA, mediating fatty acid transport to the mitochondrion for \u00df-oxidation. ACBPs are also believed to be putative ligands of PBR (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), and once they bind to this receptor they facilitate mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, presumably favouring apoptosis. The main aim of the study was to establish the expression patterns of 1- Acyl-coA binding proteins (1-ACBP), B- Acyl-coA binding proteins (B-ACBP), and peripheral bezodiazepine receptor (PBR) in oesophageal cancer, and to link their roles with the disease. In situ hybridization and quantitative real-time PCR methods were performed to determine localization and the expression levels of the three genes in oesophageal cancer. All three genes illustrated substantial up-regulation within the malignant tissue sections as compared to normal oesophageal sections, all three transcripts localized specifically to mast cells, plasma cells and lymphocytes in diseased and normal tissue section. In the diseased tissue B-ACBP and 1-ACBP mRNA localized to endothelial cells of blood vessels in the submucosa. B-ACBP also localized to the nucleus of squamous epithelial cells. PBR localization was indicated in tumour islands of invasive tissue sections. Quantitative RT-PCR also indicated that the expression levels of PBR were higher as compared to the ACBP genes expression in tumours. These results show that 1-ACBP, B-ACBP and PBR play a role in the pathogenesis of oesophageal tumours and possibly in carcinogenic angiogenesis.", 
    "194": "Older people with chronic disease have great potential to benefit from their medications but are also at high risk of harm from their medications. The use of medications is particularly important for symptom control and disease progression in older people. Under-treatment means older people can miss out on the potential benefits of useful medications, while over-treatment (polypharmacy) puts them at increased risk of harm. Deprescribing attempts to balance the potential for benefit and harm by systematically withdrawing inappropriate medications with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes. The evidence base for deprescribing in older people is growing. Studies to reduce polypharmacy have used a range of methods. Most evidence for deprescribing relates to the withdrawal of specific medications, and evidence supports attempts to deprescribe potentially inappropriate medicines (such as long-term benzodiazepines). There is also evidence that polypharmacy can be reduced by withdrawing specific medications using individualised interventions. More work is needed to identify the sub-groups of older people who may most benefit from deprescribing and the best approaches to undertaking the deprescribing interventions.", 
    "195": "This article describes the therapeutic potential of neurosteroids as anticonvulsant antidotes for chemical intoxication caused by organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents or gases like sarin and soman. Toxic manifestations following nerve agent exposure, as evident in chemical attacks in Japan and Syria, include hypersecretion, respiratory distress, tremors, convulsions leading to status epilepticus (SE), and death. Benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, are the current anticonvulsants of choice for controlling nerve agent-induced life-threatening seizures, SE, and brain injury. Benzodiazepines can control acute seizures when given early, but they are less effective for delayed treatment of SE, which is characterized by rapid desensitization of synaptic GABAA receptors, benzodiazepine resistance, and brain injury. Neurosteroid-sensitive extrasynaptic GABAA receptors, however, remain unaffected by such events. Thus, anticonvulsant neurosteroids may produce more effective protection than benzodiazepines against a broad spectrum of chemical agents, even when given late after nerve agent exposure.",

Little is known about rates of use of these medications or prescribing patterns among communities of prescribers. The goal of this study was to examine rates of prescribing to Medicaid-enrollees in the calendar year after an opioid use disorder diagnosis, and to examine individual, county, and provider community factors associated with such prescribing. 2008 Medicaid claims data were used from 12 states to identify enrollees diagnosed with opioid use disorders, and 2009 claims data were used to identify rates of prescribing of each drug. Social network analysis was used to identify provider communities, and multivariate regression analyses was used to to identify patient, county, and provider community level factors associated with prescribing these drugs. The authors also examined variation in rates of prescribing across provider communities. Among Medicaid-enrollees identified with an opioid use disorder, 45% filled a prescription for an opioid analgesic, 37% filled a prescription for a benzodiazepine, and 21% filled a prescription for both in the year following their diagnosis. Females, older individuals, individuals with pain syndromes, and individuals residing in counties with higher rates of poverty were more likely to fill prescriptions. Prescribing rates varied substantially across provider communities, with rates in the highest quartile of prescribing communities over 2.5\u00a0times the rates in the lowest prescribing communities. Prescribing opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines to individuals diagnosed with opioid use disorders may increase risk of relapse and overdose. Interventions should be considered that target provider communities with the highest rates of prescribing and individuals at the highest risk.",

ERK5 regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition may be sensitive to cell types and/or the cellular microenvironment and its role in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process remain elusive. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a promising chemopreventive agent for several types of cancers. In the present study we investigated the regulatory role of ERK5 in tobacco smoke-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the stomach of mice and the preventive effect of EGCG. Exposure of mice to tobacco smoke for 12 weeks reduced expression of epithelial markers E-cadherin, ZO-1, and CK5, while the expression of mesenchymal markers Snail-1, Vimentin, and N-cadherin were increased. Importantly, we demonstrated that ERK5 modulated tobacco smoke-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition in mice stomach, as evidenced by the findings that tobacco smoke elevated ERK5 activation, and that tobacco smoke-triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition was reversed by ERK5 inhibition. Treatment of EGCG (100 mg/kg BW) effectively attenuated tobacco smoke-triggered activation of ERK5 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition alterations in mice stomach. Collectively, these data suggested that ERK5 was required for tobacco smoke-triggered gastric epithelial-mesenchymal transition and that EGCG suppressed ERK5 activation to reverse tobacco smoke-triggered gastric epithelial-mesenchymal transition in BALB/c mice. These findings provide new insights into the mechanism of tobacco smoke-associated gastric tumorigenesis and the chemoprevention of tobacco smoke-associated gastric cancer.",

    "216": "This is a retrospective study of all patients presenting to our paediatric unit with status dystonicus (SD) over a period of five years. Anonymous information was collected and a descriptive analysis is made. There were four episodes of SD in three children between 11 and 15 years of age. All children are known to have severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy and presented with an acute or sub-acute deterioration in their symptoms. Symptoms were triggered by infections in three of the four episodes. Early features included frequent and repetitive generalized muscle spasms, poor swallowing, poor sleep, distress and pain. Patients responded to supportive treatment, rehydration, benzodiazepines, baclofen and l-dopa. Intensive care was not necessary in any of the patients and patients made full recovery within 5-14 days. This report shows the value of early recognition and treatment of SD can be successful in preventing serious complications.", 
    "217": "Simple benzo-fused nitrogen heterocycles (indolines, tetrahydroquinolines, and their homologues) undergo migratory ring expansion through deprotonation of their benzylic urea derivatives with lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) in the presence of N,N'-dimethylpropylideneurea (DMPU). The products of the reactions are benzodiazepines, benzodiazocines, and their homologues, with ring sizes of 8-12. The reactions tolerate a range of substituent patterns and types, and may exhibit enantiospecificity or diastereoselectivity. Considerable complexity is rapidly generated in an efficient synthesis of these otherwise difficult-to-obtain medium-ring nitrogen heterocycles.", 
    "218": "Neuronal oscillations are fundamental to hippocampal function. It has been shown that GABAergic interneurons make an important contribution to hippocampal oscillations, but the underlying mechanism is not well understood. Here, using whole-cell recording in the complete hippocampal formation isolated from rats at postnatal days 14-18, we showed that GABAA receptor-mediated activity enhanced the generation of slow CA1 oscillations. In vitro, slow oscillations (0.5-1.5 Hz) were generated in CA1 neurons, and they consisted primarily of excitatory rather than inhibitory membrane-potential changes. These oscillations were greatly reduced by blocking GABAA receptor-mediated activity with bicuculline and were enhanced by increasing such activity with midazolam, suggesting that interneurons are required for oscillation generation. Consistently, CA1 fast-spiking interneurons were found to generate action potentials usually preceding those in CA1 pyramidal cells. These findings indicate a GABAA receptor-based mechanism for the generation of the slow CA1 oscillation in the hippocampus.",

Participants with pain in the area between the lower posterior margin of the ribcage and the horizontal gluteal fold for at least 3 months were classified as having cLBP (N\u200a=\u200a700). The drug use questionnaire was self-administered in a private setting, and included data on lifetime and current use of marijuana or hashish, cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine. Chi-square tests, one-way analysis of variance, and logistic regression, adjusted for age, gender, race, and level of education, were used for comparisons.", 
    "223": "About 46.5% of US adults with cLBP used marijuana versus 42% of those without cLBP [Adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.06-1.74]. About 22% versus 14% used cocaine (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.45-2.24), 9% versus 5% used methamphetamine (aOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.30-3.16), and 5% versus 2% used heroin (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.44-4.11). Subjects with cLBP who reported lifetime illicit drug use were more likely to have an active prescription for opioid analgesics than those without illicit drug use history: 22.5% versus 15.3%, P\u200a=\u200a0.018.",

    "226": "The present work describes a multi-residue SPE-UPLC-MS/MS method aiming at the characterization of 68 compounds in natural waters, including parent compounds as well as their major metabolites and glucuronide conjugates. Development was conducted toward the quantitative determination of a broad range of analytes belonging to different class of psychotropic drugs such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, stimulants, opiates and opioids, anticonvulsants, anti-dementia drugs, analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs (as anthropic indicators) in the low ngL(-1) range of concentration. Satisfactory extraction recoveries >70% were obtained for the majority of analytes (49 out of 68) allowing low limits of quantification. LOQ ranged between 0.1 and 17.8ngL(-1) and were lower than 5ngL(-1) for 94% of investigated analytes. Furthermore, addition of 25 isotopic labeled standards allowed to ensure reliability of the optimized method. Quantification errors were typically below 15% with relative standard variations <10% in intermediate precision conditions. Finally, the developed method was implemented in natural waters; sampling campaigns were conducted in the Seine River as a demonstration of the applicability and adequation of the method for its purpose. As a result, 48 out of 68 analytes were identified or quantified; some of them like memantine, rivastigmine, zolpidem 4-phenyl-carboxylic acid, zolpidem 6-carboxylic acid for one of the first time in surface waters. Among investigated psychotropic compounds and metabolites, tramadol, codeine, oxazepam, venlafaxine, O-desmethylvenlafaxine, gabapentin, carbamazepine and 10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxycarbamazepine were found to be the most abundant.", 
    "227": "Anxiety disorders represent a common psychiatric comorbidity in patients with epilepsy, affecting prognosis and quality of life. However, they are still underdiagnosed and undertreated. In clinical practice, a number of compounds are currently used as anxiolytics, with benzodiazepines being the most popular. Other drug classes, especially antiepileptic drugs, are increasingly prescribed for the treatment of anxiety. This article discusses the neurobiological targets and basic neuropharmacological aspects of anxiolytics in order to give the reader clear insight into their activity and mechanism of action. Clinical data regarding the treatment of anxiety in both adults and children with epilepsy are also summarised, emphasising the need for further studies.", 
    "228": "Hepatic drug metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes is altered by the nutritional status of patients. The expression of P450 enzymes is partly regulated by the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Fasting regulates the expression of both P450 enzymes and CAR and affects hepatic drug clearance. We hypothesized that the fasting-induced alterations in P450 mediated drug clearance are mediated by CAR.", 
    "229": "To investigate this we used a drug cocktail validated in humans consisting of five widely prescribed drugs as probes for specific P450 enzymes: caffeine (CYP1A2), metoprolol (CYP2D6), omeprazole (CYP2C19), midazolam (CYP3A4) and s-warfarin (CYP2C9). This cocktail was administered to wild type (WT, C57Bl/6) mice or mice deficient for CAR (CAR-/-) that were either fed ad libitum or fasted for 24 hours. Blood was sampled at predefined intervals and drug concentrations were measured as well as hepatic mRNA expression of homologous/orthologous P450 enzymes (Cyp1a2, Cyp2d22, Cyp3a11, Cyp2c37, Cyp2c38 and Cyp2c65).", 
    "230": "Fasting decreased Cyp1a2 and Cyp2d22 expression and increased Cyp3a11 and Cyp2c38 expression in both WT and CAR-/- mice. The decrease in Cyp1a2 was diminished in CAR-/- in comparison with WT mice. Basal Cyp2c37 expression was lower in CAR-/- compared to WT mice. Fasting decreased the clearance of all drugs tested in both WT and CAR-/- mice. The absence of CAR was associated with an decrease in the clearance of omeprazole, metoprolol and midazolam in fed mice. The fasting-induced reduction in clearance of s-warfarin was greater in WT than in CAR-/-. The changes in drug clearance correlated with the expression pattern of the specific P450 enzymes in case of Cyp1a2-caffeine and Cyp2c37-omeprazole.", 
    "231": "We conclude that CAR is important for hepatic clearance of several widely prescribed drugs metabolized by P450 enzymes. However the fasting-induced alterations in P450 mediated drug clearance are largely independent of CAR.", 
    "232": "Febrile infection-related epilepsy syndrome (FIRES) is a rare condition which evolves into refractory status epilepticus (SE), with poor outcome in most cases. Conventional antiepileptic drugs fail to control SE in FIRES patients. We report the case of a previously healthy 4-year-old boy who was diagnosed with FIRES. One week after pharyngitis and high fever he started seizures, followed by refractory SE. Benzodiazepines, phenytoin, high-dose barbiturates that induce burst suppression, high doses of corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, immunoglobulins, propofol, lidocaine, ketamine, inhaled desflurane, ketogenic diet, lacosamide, and therapeutic hypothermia were tried at different times in a period of 8 weeks, but all of them were ineffective. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been used in refractory SE in children. We report a case in which ECT was successfully used for treatment of refractory SE in a pediatric patient with FIRES syndrome.", 
    "233": "Clobazam (CLB) is an older anti-epileptic drug, with a slightly different chemical structure from that of the classic benzodiazepines currently used in the treatment of epilepsy, which confers less sedative properties in terms of negative adverse effects. It is also thought to be better tolerated than other anti-epileptic drugs, whilst maintaining a very similar level of efficacy. It has been tested extensively in over 50 studies on more than 3000 patients with epilepsy and is now approved as an adjunctive treatment of epilepsy in >100 countries. The aim of this review is to evaluate several existing studies on the effectiveness of CLB as an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of epilepsy and whether this therapy is more useful in particular types of epilepsy or seizure prevention. This is not a systematic review but a general overview of some of the most recent studies on the effectiveness of CLB as an adjunctive therapy. Additionally, the benefits of having an oral suspension of CLB will be evaluated with regards to patient groups benefiting from this formulation. The last issue addressed is that of the importance of prescribing CLB by brand, along with the benefits and risks of not doing so.", 
    "234": "The major therapeutic approach for treating fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic widespread pain syndrome, is pharmacotherapy-centered symptom management. Complexity of treatment often leads to multiple medication prescriptions. While there is no current alternative to the probable need for polypharmacy in this patient population, there remains concern related to potential side effects and adverse drug events. In this secondary analysis of data on medications taken collected from two parent studies, all medications were broken down into the following categories: opioid, nonopioid, antidepressant, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and benzodiazepine. The impact on pain severity and pain interference of these medication categories as well as perceived stress, fatigue, and depression scores was assessed. Baseline pain severity (p = .0106) and pain interference (p = .0002) were significantly correlated with opioid use as compared to nonopioid use. A multivariate regression with backward elimination resulted in a model for pain severity with one significant predictor variable, fatigue (p < .0001); pain interference had three significant predictor variables: opioid use (p = .04), fatigue (p < .0001), and depression (p = .04). While future studies should further address the utility of opioids and examine the role of polypharmacy as part of symptom management strategies for individuals with FM, study findings suggest that, for those who suffer chronic widespread pain as the predominant symptom experience, a challenge equally as perplexing for nurses and nursing research alike as managing the pain lies in addressing the fatigue and depression in this patient population.", 
    "235": "Over the past decade, patients admitted to addiction treatment programs have reported increasing rates of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine (BZD) use. This drug combination places individuals at high risk for accidental overdose. Little is known about reasons for BZD use among individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorders.",

    "237": "Forty percent of persons surveyed used a BZD in the month prior to admission, and 25% of these met criteria for BZD dependence (DSM IV). BZD users averaged 32.0 years of age, 63.6% were male, 85.2% used heroin, and reported, on average, 13.3 (\u00b111.2) days of BZD use during the past month. Alprazolam (Xanax) was the most commonly used BZD (52%), and buying it on the street the most common source (48%). The most commonly reported reason for BZD use was 'to manage anxiety' (42.6%), followed by 'to get or enhance a high' (27.7%), 'to help with sleep' (11.4%), and 'to decrease opioid withdrawal' (10.2%). The most common reason for BZD use was significantly associated (p<.001) with most likely source of BZDs, with persons who got their BZDs from a prescriber (23%) more likely to report BZD anxiety as their primary reason for use, while persons who bought BZDs on \"the street\" (48%) had the highest likelihood of reporting using BZD to get or enhance a high. Participants using BZDs most commonly for anxiety did not endorse lower anxiety than those using BZDs for other reasons.", 
    "238": "Two in five persons seeking detoxification for an opioid use disorder used a BZD in the prior month. Anxiety was the most common reason patients reported using a benzodiazepine, but they also reported using BZDs to enhance a 'high' and manage opioid withdrawal. Evidence-based discussions about the risks of combining BZDs and opioids, and alternatives to BZDs should be a high priority in detoxification settings.",

    "241": "Acute respiratory failure manifesting with apneic episodes is a life-threatening and unpredictable complication of SPS. Its pathophysiology is not well known. The two suggested mechanisms are as follows: (1) apnea due to muscle rigidity and paroxysmal muscle spasms, and (2) paroxysmal autonomic hyperactivity. Sudden and unexpected deaths have been reported in SPS, and all described cases have been associated with apnea. Thus, the onset of apnea during SPS should be considered a criterion of high severity and should lead to intensive care unit (ICU) admission for continuous monitoring. In patients with severe disease who are unresponsive to symptomatic treatment with benzodiazepines and baclofen, or in patients with life-threatening complications, early immunotherapy by intravenous immunoglobulins should be considered.", 
    "242": "Onset of apneas during SPS should be considered as a signal of possible progression toward acute respiratory failure and sudden death, and should lead to ICU admission for continuous monitoring. Early immunotherapy should be started in such situations, including intravenous immunoglobulins as the first-line treatment.",

    "245": "One-half (47%) exclusively consumed opioids without benzodiazepines/alcohol; 26% had days of opioid use with and without benzodiazepines/alcohol; and 26% always used opioids and benzodiazepines/alcohol. Same-day use of opioids with benzodiazepines/alcohol typically occurred on 1-3days in the past week. Six in ten (61%) participants reported high dose opioid use on at least one day; one in five (20%) reported high dose opioid and high dose benzodiazepine/alcohol use on at least one day. The latter group were more likely to use prescribed opioid substitution therapy, often alongside diverted pharmaceutical opioids. Socio-demographic and clinical profiles did not vary according to high dose opioid, alcohol and benzodiazepine use, and there was no association with harms.", 
    "246": "Same-day use of opioids with benzodiazepines/alcohol, and high dose combinations, are common amongst people who tamper with pharmaceutical opioids. Assessment of concomitant benzodiazepine/alcohol use during opioid therapy, implementation of real-time prescription monitoring systems, and research to clarify upper safe limits for polydrug depressant use, are potential implications.", 
    "247": "Antipsychotic drugs (APDs) were developed to treat schizophrenia in adults; however they have been increasingly prescribed (mostly \"off-label\") for children and adolescents. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone on the binding of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptors in juvenile rat brain regions that are involved in antipsychotic efficacy.",

In the caudate putamen (CPu), olanzapine attenuated 5-HT2AR binding in both genders, and reduced 5-HT2CR binding in male rats. Olanzapine increased D2 receptor (D2R) binding in the NAcS of male rats, but decreased it in females. Olanzapine increased D1 receptor (D1R) binding in the Cg, while aripiprazole decreased D1R binding in the PFC of males. Aripiprazole significantly reduced 5-HT2AR binding in the male PFC. Risperidone decreased 5-HT2AR binding in the PFC of female rats, while attenuating D1R binding in the PFC and Cg of males. However, APDs have no effects on the binding of serotonin and dopamine transporters.", 
    "250": "This study revealed that aripiprazole, olanzapine and risperidone affected 5-HT2AR, 5-HT2CR, 5-HTT, D1R and D2R bindings differently in the brains of juvenile male and female rats.", 
    "251": "Ex vivo drug permeation studies are useful for early screening of drug candidates for buccal delivery. However, it is not always feasible to obtain fresh tissue for each experiment. Therefore, a method for storing excised tissue for later use is needed. The purpose of this study was to determine if permeability barriers for small molecules (nicotine and diazepam) were maintained after freezing porcine buccal mucosa with cryoprotectants to -80\u00b0C. Combinations of dimethyl sulfoxide, bovine serum albumin, glycerol and sucrose were used as cryoprotectants. The permeability of nicotine and diazepam across fresh or frozen/thawed tissue was determined using modified Ussing chambers. Haematoxylin-eosin stained tissue sections for histology were prepared. The permeability of nicotine across tissue frozen without cryoprotectants was significantly higher compared to tissue frozen with cryoprotectants or fresh tissue. Freezing with or without cryoprotectants did not significantly affect the flux of diazepam compared to fresh tissue. Only minor histological changes were seen in frozen/thawed porcine buccal mucosa compared to fresh tissue. In conclusion, permeability barriers for nicotine and diazepam were preserved after freezing with any of the combinations of cryoprotectants; however, the barrier may be damaged when freezing without cryoprotectants.", 
    "252": "Neuroleptics are a group of drugs widely used in the treatment of psychotic symptoms. Among their adverse effects is the ability to trigger a neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). The diagnosis of NMS is determined by exclusion, and its initial therapeutic management should be the withdrawal of neuroleptics, the administration of benzodiazepines, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT is an effective treatment in these patients, and in those cases with a poor response to treatment with antipsychotic drugs. A review is presented on the treatment options and anaesthetic implications of ECT used to handle a patient diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in the context of NMS."
