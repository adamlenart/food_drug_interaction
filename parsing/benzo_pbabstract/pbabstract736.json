    "0": "Delirium is not a clinical entity but a symptom-complex of manifold etiology. Its presence signifies acute cerebral insufficiency and often represents a medical and/or psychiatric emergency.Though some forms of delirium have distinctive features, the fundamental phenomena are common to all, with clouding of consciousness the sine qua non. The condition has two major components: (1) the basic \"acute brain syndrome\" and (2) associated release phenomena.Clinicians must first make the vital differentiation between delirium and \"functional\" mental disorder, then proceed with the elucidation of the underlying diagnosis and the concurrent organization of symptomatic and etiologic treatment.Proper treatment combines management of the acute brain syndrome with general and specific procedures for control of the underlying condition. Dealing with the symptom-complex itself involves the principles and practice of sedation, hydration, and nutrition, nursing care and supportive measures. Provided the basic organic condition is treatable, the prognosis today is usually good.", 
    "1": "Diazepam was administered to seven severely affected athetoid children for a period of two to three months to determine whether beneficial effects could be demonstrated from its use. All patients were started on a daily dose of 2.5 mg. and the dose was increased as tolerated. The patients were assessed by a neurologist, an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist and a speech therapist before and after the trial.The dose of diazepam cannot be determined in advance. The optimum dose must be established by trial in each individual patient. No beneficial effects were noted in four of these children. One of those who showed improvement became significantly worse when the drug was withdrawn and it was necessary to reinstitute the drug. The response in any individual patient is unpredictable. The most significant side effect was drowsiness."
