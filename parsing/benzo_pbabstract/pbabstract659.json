The investigation was carried out using thin-layer and column chromatography, UV-spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. Acetylation of the substrate was inhibited in mitochondria but in soluble fraction the reaction was activated by equimolar concentrations of coenzyme A. The acetylating activity towards substrate was 1,000-fold higher in leukocytes than in erythrocytes.", 
    "1": "In tests on flaxedyl immobilized rats the effect of clonazepam on the action produced by gamma-aminobutyric acid, acetylcholine and L-glutamate, delivered microionophoretically to neurons of the sensomotor brain cortex, was investigated. Clonazepam was found to potentiate the inhibiting action of gamma-aminobutyric acid and reduce the exciting effect of acetylcholine and L-glutamate on the spontaneous neuronal activity. The ability of clonazepam, like other tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine series, to augment the sensitivity of the receptive neurons formations to gamma-aminobutyric acid and also influence the ionic permeability of the post-synaptic membrane is suggested.", 
    "2": "The GABA receptor agonists, GABA and muscimol, increased, while the GABA receptor antagonist, (+)-bicuculline, decreased the affinity of the benzodiazepine receptor for 3H-diazepam. The effect was seen at both 0 and 25 degrees C in spite of a large difference of affinity for 3H-diazepam at the two temperatures.", 
    "3": "Dose-effect curves were determined in rats for the effects of drugs on punished and unpunished responding maintained by fixed-interval schedules of food presentation before, during and after the drinking of large daily doses of chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital. An average intake of 50 mg/kg/day of chlordiazepoxide produced tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of chlordiazepoxide on unpunished responding and cross-tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of pentobarbital. During chlordiazepoxide drinking, rate-increasing effects of both chlordiazepoxide and pentobarbital on punished responding became apparent. There was no evidence for cross-tolerance between chlordiazepoxide and chlorpromazine. An average intake of 100 mg/kg/day of pentobarbital produced similar evidence of tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of pentobarbital on unpunished responding and cross-tolerance to the rate-decreasing effects of chlordiazepoxide. Removal of chlordiazepoxide from the drinking water temporarily increased unpunished responding; however, 6 weeks after withdrawal of chlordiazepoxide or pentobarbital from the drinking water, the dose-effect curves for injections of these drugs appeared to be returning to their original positions.", 
    "4": "A rapid GLC method was developed for the assay of chlordiazepoxide in serum. After chlordiazepoxide was extracted with ether, it was methylated with trimethylanilinium hydroxide in the injection port and detected by electron capture. The assay is simple and sensitive and can be automated for large-scale clinical analysis.", 
    "5": "We report a method for simultaneous measurement of five commonly used tricyclic antidepressant drugs (doxepin, desipramine, nortriptyline, imipramine, and amitriptyline) in serum by paired-ion high-performance liquid chromatography, with use of a reversed-phase column and ultraviolet detection at 254 nm. The drugs are extracted from 2 ml of serum at pH 14 into hexane/isoamyl alcohol (99/1 by vol) and re-extracted into 200 microliter of 0.1 mol/liter HCI. An aliquot of the aqueous acid phase is chromatographed with use of a methanol/acetonitrile/water (41/15/44) solvent system, containing 5 mmol of pentanesulfonic acid per liter of phosphate buffer (0.1 mol/liter, pH 6.5), at a flow rate of 1,5 ml/min. Analytical recoveries of the drugs from serum increase with increasing concentration, from 62% at 25 microgram/liter to 93% at 300 microgram/liter. Linear response is observed for drug concentrations up to 1500 microgram/liter and the detection limit is 2-3 microgram/liter. Within-run precision ranges from 1.4 to 2.9% and day-to-day precision from 1.7 to 7%, depending on the specific drug. The entire procedure can be completed within 45 min and is well adapted to the routine clinical laboratory. Of 48 common basic and several neutral drugs tested for possible interferences, only three benzodiazepines, three phenothiazines, and three antihistamines interfere with the assay of doxepin, desipramine, and nortriptyline, respectively.", 
    "6": "The rate of transplacental passage of diazepam (DZ) has been studied in 33 cases of cephalic presentation where operative forceps delivery was indicated by intrauterine hypoxia or by prolonged second stage of labor. The drug (30 mg) was injected intravenously immediately before delivery either during uterine contractions (Group I) or in the relaxation period (Group II) according to a randomized protocol. As judged by the concentration in the newborn and the child/mother concentration ratio at 2 hr after delivery, and the concentration on the second day, the fetal exposure to the drug was probably less when the injection was timed to coincide with uterine contractions. In the group of patients given the drug in the relaxation period, the injection-delivery (I-D) interval was up to 305 sec and the 2-hr child/mother concentration ratio was close to unity in some cases. It therefore appears that the transplacental passage of DZ is rapid when the high initial concentrations in the maternal circulation coincide with favorable conditions for transfer in the relaxation period. Although sleep was induced by the injection of DZ in all of the mothers, the amounts of drug transferred during the short I-D intervals in the present study did not exert delterious effects on the newborn infants.", 
    "7": "Respiratory function was measured before and 1 hour after premedication with diazepam (10 mg IM) or droperidol (5 mg IM) in 2 groups of 14 normal patients scheduled for elective surgery. Diazepam had no significant effects on respiratory rate, tidal volume, minute ventilation, dead space, VD/VT %, alveolar ventilation, expired Po2, or Pco2, end-tidal Pco2, arterial Po2 or Pco2, or alveolar-arterial Po2 or Pco2 gradients. Droperidol was associated with statistically significant but modest reductions in tidal volume (-13.3%) and minute ventilation (-8.4%) while other respiratory functions remained unaffected.", 
    "8": "In a double-blind cross-over trial ten healthy male volunteers were administered placebo as well as one representative of each of the four hypothetical psychotropic drug classes, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and psychostimulants. The drugs were: 75 mg of chlorpromazine, 75 mg of amitriptyline, 10 mg of diazepam and 18 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate. The effects of the compounds were assessed by pharmaco EEG, an adjective checklist, and a battery of psychological performance tests. The results demonstrate that the test model differentiates well between sedative and stimulatory drug effects. In addition, this multidimensional test approach discriminates adequately the effects of the various sedative drugs. The advantages and limitations of multidimensional test approaches for the description of psychotropic drugs along with the importance of employing such an approach for the development of psychotropic drugs are discussed.", 
    "9": "The analgesic effects of single oral doses of viminol (70 mg), of viminol (70 mg) combined with chlordiazepoxide (10 mg) and of chlordiazepoxide (10 mg) were compared in 41 outpatients with chronic pain mostly due to neoplasms. Alone, or combined with chlordiazepoxide, viminol proved significantly more effective than chlordiazepoxide; No difference in analgestic effect was observed between viminol combined with chlordiazepoxide and viminol alone. The use of self-administered questionnaires was found particularly convenient for study of analgesics in outpatients.", 
    "10": "Chlordiazepoxide and its 4 major metabolites were assayed after separation by thin-layer chromatography following extraction from biological fluids. The compounds become intensely fluorescent in the presence of red, fuming nitric acid. The resulting compounds are quantitated with a spectrodensitometer with a fluorescent attachment. The sensitivity varies between 0.05 and 0.1 microgram. The coefficient of variation is 1.4% for assays in urine and 6.4% in serum.", 
    "11": "Five newborn infants (birth weight 2900--3600 g) were given diazepam (Valium, LaRoche) for convulsive disorders in 4 equal doses intravenously, intramuscularly, rectally and orally with at least 24 hours intervals. Three infants were given doses of 1 mg diazepam/kg body weight, and 2 0.5 mg/kg. The parenteral solution of the drug was given intravenously, intramuscularly and rectally. Powder of tablets was given orally. After intravenous administration very high peak values of plasma-diazepam concentration were obtained (5775--10800 ng/ml after 1 mg/kg, 2750 and 6450 ng/ml after 0.5 mg/kg). Next to intravenous administration rectal administration caused the most rapid increase in plasma-diazepam concentration. Presumed anticonsulsive concentrations (150--300 ng/ml) were obtained within 5 min with 1 mg/kg as well as 0.5 mg/kg rectally. Rectal administration therefore could be a suitable treatment for seizures in the newborn infant. Accumulation of the main depressive metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam occurred in all infants. This phenomenon must be taken into account when repeated doses of diazepam are administered.", 
    "12": "Chlorodiazepoxide (CDP) produces stimulation of the locomotor activity of CD-1 and DBA/2 mice. This effect is strongly pronounced at the commencement of the testing session, and it is followed by a decline of the locomotor activity. The drugs impairing noradrenergic transmission: reserpine, clonidine and alpha-methyltyrosine, depressed or abolished the stimulatory effect of CDP; clonidine, in addition antagonized the subsequent decline of the locomotor activity in CDP-treated mice. Mice receiving reserpine subchronically (in the dose of 0.5 mg/kg daily for 3 days) displayed either motor depression or hypermotility. In approx. 50% of subchronically reserpinized mice CDP produced a strong hypermotility, lasting for at least 1 hr. It can be concluded that a noradrenergic mechanism is involved in the stimulatory effect of CDP on exploratory locomotor activity in mice, and that there exist two distinct subpopulations within the CD-1 strain, reacting differently to chronic reserpine treatment.", 
    "13": "The formation of hydrogen bonds between the minor tranquilizers diazepam and nitrazepam and a few nucleobases was studied in deuterochloroform solution by means of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The thermodynamic and spectroscopic data of the associations were evaluated on the basis of a dimer model, using the concentration dependent shifts of the protons involved in hydrogen bonds. The interactions of nitrazepam (deltaH0=-10 to -21 kJ/mol; deltaG025 -0.2 to -7.4 kJ/mol) were found to be stronger than those of diazepam (deltaH0=-10 to -13 kJ/mol; deltaG025=6.0 to 6.4 kJ/mol). The various binding sites of the benzodiazepines for hydrogen bonds are discussed.", 
    "14": "Monkeys were treated intravenously with various anticonvulsant drugs before and after the intravenous administration of gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) and temperature monitoring was performed throughout all experiments. The GHB-induced EEG changes were abolished by ethosuximide and clonazepam, marginally improved by diazepam, and unaffected by phenobarbital. The GHB-induced myoclonic jerks were abolished by ethosuximide, significantly improved by diazepam, and worsened by clonazepam. Phenobarbital was effective in diminishing the frequency of GHB-induced myoclonic jerks only when given prior to administration of GHB. The GHB-induced stupor was improved only by ethosuximide. The GHB model of petit mal seizures is quite specific for drugs used in this disorder. GHB may play a role in the pathogenesis of absence seizures in children.", 
    "15": "The effects of low doses of nabilone, chlorpromazine, pentobarbital, meprobamate, diazepam, chlordiazepoxiOde and d-amphetamine on behavioral responding to cues signalling the availability of food rewards, and on the M-wave, an evoked cortical potential previously reported to reflect the conditioned incentive value of the cues were determined in the squirrel monkey. Nabilone and chlorpromazine simultaneously depressed both the M-wave and behavior. Pentobarbital, meprobamate, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide could depress the M-wave without depressing behavior. This effect was most marked with diazepam. The only augmentation of the M-wave observed was the d-amphetamine, and this occurred in only one of five animals. The benzodiazepines were the only drugs to augment behavioral output. However, diazepam occasionally increased the number of cures responded to while concomitantly decreasing both total behavioral output and the amplitude of the M-wave. It is concluded that the M-wave cannot directly reflect the incentive value of the cue, but must rather reflect something that tends to parallel this value.", 
    "16": "The in vitro effect of several benzodiazepine derivatives on purified blood cholinesterases were determined. The results were generally in close agreement with previous results obtained on freshly drawn human blood.", 
    "17": "The research methodology of 78 double-blind studies comparing benzodiazepines and placebo in treating neurotic anxiety is critically reviewed. Many faults are noted in areas of subject selection, assessment of clinical response, study design and data analysis. Although 56.4% of the studies reviewed had results demonstrating a significant difference in clinical response between benzodiazepines and placebo, the frequent methodologic difficulties and inconsistent results from study to study lead the authors to question the efficacy of these drugs as a treatment for anxiety. A need for better designed studies is discussed and some research methodologies proposed.", 
    "18": "Acute and chronic ethanol ingestion can alter both the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of other drugs. For psychotherapeutic drugs, modification of drug action by alcohol is much more important than kinetic interaction, such as ethanol induced drug metabolism. In contrast, the importance of the effects of alcohol on the kinetics of other classes of drug is incomplete. The probability and mechanism of alcohol kinetic interactions with other drugs can nevertheless be anticipated, in part, on the basis of the extent of binding of the drug to plasma proteins, the capacity of the liver for extracting the drug from blood passing through the liver and the true distribution space of the drug. Highly bound drugs with low intrinsic hepatic clearance are among the most commonly reported to have their kinetics altered by ethanol (e.g. benzodiazepines, phenytoin, tolbutamide and warfarin). Less highly bound drugs are less consistently affected (e.g. meprobamate, glutethimide, pentobarbitone and phenobarbitone). Acute administration of ethanol to laboratory animals or incubation of microsomal preparations with ethanol inhibits the mixed function oxidase activity. In the human, the elimination half-life of meprobamate, pentobarbitone and tolbutamide is increased by acute ethanol administration. Chronic administration of ethanol to rats and humans causes proliferation of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, increase in microsomal protein content and cytochrome P450 and results in an augmentation in drug metabolising ability of the microsomes in vitro. Even though the plasma half-life of some drugs is decreased by chronic ethanol ingestion, the clinical determination of the mechanism is incomplete because few studies have measured drug metabolite levels. In addition, alcohol effects on drug distribution have not been studied very extensively. The effects of chronic alcohol ingestion on drugs with low and high hepatic extraction, high and low binding, important tissue localisation and microsomal and non-microsomal metabolism will be quite different. Systematic studies of the mechanism of alcohol kinetic interactions are needed. Such kinetic studies should be combined with pharmacodynamic measures in order to establish the clinical importance of changes in drug kinetics.", 
    "19": "Lorazepam 3 or 4 mg i.m. was given to 100 patients as premedication before bronchoscopy under thiopentone-suxamethonium anaesthesia. Forty-nine of the patients assessed as anxious received oral lorazepam as preoperative night sedation also. Lorazepam was an effective night sedative. Forty-two of the 49 patients slept well and were calm and co-operative in the morning. Following the i.m. injection of lorazepam, 64% of patients had complete lack of recall for 4--10 h following premedication. Only 5% recalled correctly a simple objective test of memory initiated in the anaesthetic room. The frequency of recall was higher in those who consumed alcohol regularly and in females. There was one case of awareness during bronchoscopy in a patient who received only a small dose of lorazepam (2.8 mg per 70 kg). Side-effects were minimal and patient acceptance was impressive. These results show an advance on previous studies using pethidine and diazepam. Further improvement is needed, particularly in adjusting the dose of lorazepam to body weight and to factors such as age, sex and alcohol intake.", 
    "20": "Some investigators have found benzodiazepines effective in the treatment of anxious depression and thus have argued that benzodiazepines were \"antidepressants.\" We reviewed the literature on benzodiazepines in depressive disorders. Comparative studies indicate they are less effective than standard antidepressants in the treatment of several types of depressive illnesses. Although they display definite anxiolytic properties and may elevate mood, they exert limited effect on the core symptoms of endogenous depression. An argument is made that benzodiazepines are primarily anxiolytic rather than antidepressant.", 
    "21": "The disposition of chlordiazepoxide (50 mg, intravenously), diazepam (0.143 mg/kg, orally), and oxazepam (0.429 mg/kg, orally) were studied in normal and alcoholic men before and after chronic disulfiram administration. Decreases in the plasma clearance of chlordiazepoxide (54%, p less than 0.05), diazepam (41%, p less than 0.05), and their active N-desmethyl metabolites were observed. Oxazepam has no important active metabolites and its net disposition is minimally altered by disulfiram. Oxazepam disposition is unaffected by age and liver disease. These considerations together with that of the short half-life of oxazepam (median, 6.1 hr) suggest that oxazepam may be the drug of choice if benzodiazepine therapy is used for patients taking disulfiram.", 
    "22": "The predatory behavior of ferrets (Putorius putorius furo L.) consists mainly of instinctive behavioral patterns that are elicited by simple external stimuli. For the ferret, the time needed to catch and kill rats depends on the size of the rats in relation to that of the ferret. Killing success decreases with a relative increase in prey size. Chlordiazepoxide hydrochloride injections (1 mg/kg, i.m.) modified this behavior. Drugged ferrets needed less time and less bites to kill relatively large rats; killing success was also increased. Chlordiazepoxide seemed to disinhibit the ferrets when they were presented with large rats, which they normally attack more cautiously.", 
    "23": "Inhibitory avoidance behaviour of mice was studied by using an automated procedure. Animals were subjected to five 15-min sessions. Facilitation of the inhibitory avoidance behaviour was observed following the administration of chlordiazepoxide at doses which did not produce significant effects on spontaneous locomotor activity.", 
    "24": "Chlordiazepoxide increased the spontaneous locomotor activity of both normal and reserpinized mice and facilitated the avoidance behaviour of mice pretreated with reserpine. These effects of chlorodiazepoxide on reserpinized animals were unexpected, since they are usually considered characteristic of antidepressant drugs.", 
    "25": "Chlordiazepoxide, imipramine, and amitriptyline, given alone or in combination, were tested in mice subjected to 5 daily 100-trial avoidance sessions in the shuttle-box. When the drugs were given alone, chlordiazepoxide and the lower doses of imipramine facilitated avoidance behaviour. The higher doses of the two antidepressants impaired avoidance behaviour. Mixtures of chlordiazepoxide and imipramine produced some facilitating effects, while depressant effects prevailed in the chlordiazepoxide-amitriptyline combinations.", 
    "26": "Lesions of the locus coeruleus system were induced by combined stereotaxic injections of 6-OH-dopamine to the ascending fibres and just lateral to the locus coeruleus itself, to deplete the noradrenaline content of both the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. A group of rats with cortical noradrenaline concentrations of less than 30 ng/g were compared with a group with lesser destruction of the system (mean noradrenaline concentration 71 +/- 44 ng/g) and with controls (mean noradrenaline 347 +/- 58 ng/g). Lesioned rats showed normal motor activity and exploration (assessed with a holeboard) and showed normal habituation of these behaviours. The lesioned rats gave no evidence of increased susceptibility to distracting auditory stimuli whilst licking for water, and the groups did not differ in their rate of habituation to these stimuli, or in dishabituation. In a social interaction test, lesioned animals showed a decrease in social contacts in an unfamiliar situation (interpreted as a response to anxiety) of similar magnitude to that seen in the control group. In this test, lesioned animals engaged in more 'aggressive' behaviour (boxing and wrestling) than did the controls. These findings are incompatible with hypotheses that the locus coeruleus system is an integral part of the physiological mechanisms which control gross motor behaviour, attention, habituation or anxiety. Together with previous findings with the benzodiazepines, the results with the social interaction test make it unlikely that the benzodiazepines exert their anxiolytic effects by inhibiting the locus coeruleus system.", 
    "27": "These experiments characterized the analgesia resulting from exposure to certain noxious and/or stressful manipulations. Rats exposed either to electric grid shock (0.35-2.0 mA for 10-30 sec) or to 5 min of presumably non-painful centrifugal rotation (about 7.0 transverse g's) were analgesic as measured by tail-flick, hot plate and responses to applications of a calibrated paw pinch or alligator clip. Analgesia produced by shock (SA) or centrifugal rotation (RA) persisted after termination of these manipulations. Neither SA nor RA were attended by generalized sensory, attentional or motoric deficits. Intraperitoneal injection of hypertonic saline also increased tail-flick latencies. Exposure to brief ether anesthesia or horizontal oscillation, both of which have been reported to increase ACTH secretion (a commonly used indicator of stress), did not produce analgesia as measured by the tail-flick test. The use of classical conditioning procedures to pair shock with environmental stimuli resulted in increased tail-flick latencies. The narcotic antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.) did not reduce the tail-flick inhibition produced by shock, rotation, hypertonic saline or classical conditioning. Chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg, i.p.) also failed to antagonize the increased tail-flick latencies produced by shock or conditioning. Tail-flick inhibition produced by shock or rotation was markedly reduced by complete spinal cord transection at thoracic levels. These results suggest that: (1) the selective modulation of nociceptive input at the level of the spinal cord can be mediated by a supraspinal system or systems physiologically distinct from those involved in analgesia produced by the administration of opiates; (2) non-narcotic modulation of nociceptive input occurring within the spinal cord can be learned by exposure to classical conditioning procedures; and (3) noxious stimuli are sufficient but not necessary to produce a non-narcotic analgesia; stress alone, however, is not always sufficient to produce this analgesia.", 
    "28": "Two patients were hospitalized in moderately deep coma after ingestion of large doses of diazepam (500 and 2,000 mg) with suicidal intent. Neither patient experienced important complications; both recovered fully and were discharged within 48 hours. Concentrations of diazepam and its three pharmacologically active metabolites (desmethyldiazepam, temazepam, and oxazepam) were determined in multiple samples drawn during and after hospitalization. High concentrations of all four compounds were present in early samples, then declined slowly during the next one to two weeks. Rapid clinical recovery after diazepam overdose is not attributable to rapid elimination of active compounds from the body, but more likely to adaptation or tolerance to their depressant effects.", 
    "29": "The benzodiazepine derivative (Ro 11-3128) which has central nervous effects similar to other benzodiazepines, and praziquantel (PZ), are two new antischistosomal drugs. At low concentrations these drugs will produce a marked spastic paralysis of male Schistosoma mansoni musculature. An analysis of the action of these drugs on the parasite's musculature shows that Ro 11-3128 and PZ produced a rapid rise in the tension of the musculature of male schistosomes. Various compounds known to interact with the schistosome's neuroreceptive sites did not block of potentiate the action of these drugs. Removal of Ca2+ or addition of Mg2+ to the incubation medium blocked the action of these drugs on the schistosome's musculature. Uptake studies of inorganic cations by male schistosome's indicate that Ro 11-3128 and PZ decrease the influx of K+ but stimulate the influx of Ca2+ and Na+ into the male schistosome. It is suggested that this interference with inorganic ion transport mechanisms causes the contraction of the schistosome musculature.", 
    "30": "The analysis of serum samples for the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin by a simple extraction technique and chromatographic analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography is described. The method is a micro one which correlates well with gas-liquid chromatographic procedures. Coefficients of variation are smaller than 3%.", 
    "31": "Following reports that unilateral intranigral injections of putative GABAergic drugs induce contralateral rotational behaviour in rats, the effects of similar injections of the benzodiazepine flurazepam have been studied. Flurazepam mimicked the effects of the GABA agonist muscimol and the GABA analogue baclofen by inducing a dose-related contralateral rotation. This response was anatomically associated with the GABA-rich zona reticulata of the substantia nigra and was attenuated by the GABA antagonist picrotoxin but not by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol or by destruction of the ipsilateral nigrostriatal dopamine pathway with 6-hydroxydopamine. These results suggest that in this behavioural model flurazepam may show GABAergic activity by indirectly enhancing GABA transmission at synapses with receptors located on nigral non-dopaminergic neurons controlling postural asymmetry.", 
    "32": "Intra-amygdaloid unilateral application of low doses of kainic acid rapidly elicits, in both chronic and acute conditions, secondarily generalized convulsive seizures which often culminate in fatal true status epilepticus unless appropriate anti-epileptic drugs are provided. Spontaneous recurrent seizures are observed for several hours starting approximately 10 min. after the application of kainic acid. In addition to the primary degeneration in the amygdaloid complex, a secondary cell loss is seen in CA3 area of the dorsal hippocampus. It is suggested that this procedure may constitute a particularly suitable model for the study of true focalized status epilepticus.", 
    "33": "The prescribing of psychotropic drugs by general practitioners was assessed by analysing the drug treatment of all patients referred from general practice to a psychiatric outpatient clinic over four years. Of the 287 patients, 220 were taking one or more of 56 different psychotropic drugs at referral, diazepam being the most common. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates had been taken for significantly longer than other drugs, and, of a total of 342 drugs, 61 had been prescribed regularly for over a year. Half of the drugs were considered to be incorrectly prescribed on pharmacological grounds, the main errors being unnecessarily prolonged regular treatment, incorrect dosage (particularly common with antidepressants), and polypharmacy with drugs of similar pharmacological action. A basic grounding in the pharmacology of psychotropic drugs might help practitioners to avoid prescribing errors of this kind.", 
    "34": "The interaction of several non-benzodiazepine drugs with [3H] diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors in rat brain synaptosomal membranes was investigated. Baclofen, benzoctamine, hydroxyzine, chlorpromazine, haloperidol, imipramine, and amitriptyline displace specific [3H] diazepam binding, but the concentrations needed are too high to explain pharmacological effects of these drugs by an interaction with benzodiazepine receptors. The most potent non-benzodiazepine drug for inhibiting specific [3H] diazepam binding was methaqualone (IC50 value of 150 micrometer). It is suggested that interactions with benzodiazepine receptors may account for the anxiolytic and anticonvulsive side effects of this drug. The analeptic drug pentylenetetrazole interacts with benzodiazepine receptor binding with an IC50 value of about 1 mM, which is possibly too high to explain its convulsive properties by an antagonism at the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "35": "Thirty-two couples with the presenting problem of female sexual unresponsiveness were treated in a controlled study using a balanced factorial design. Treatment involved a combination of drug therapy and counselling. Half the subjects received testosterone and half diazepam, half received weekly and half monthly counselling. They were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment and at six months follow-up. Those receiving testosterone did significantly better on a number of behavioural and attitudinal measures than the diazepam group. There were no notable differences in outcome between the two counselling regimes. There were no undesirable side-effects with the testosterone. Further work is needed to establish the indications for testosterone therapy for unresponsive women.", 
    "36": "Three healthy volunteers (2 male and one female) participated in single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic studies of oral chlordiazepoxide (CDX) hydrochloride. Following single 50-mg oral doses of CDX.HCl, absorption and elimination proceeded as apparent first-order processes. Values of absorption half-life were: 14.5, 189, and 18.9 minutes; elimination half-lives were: 7.6, 9.8, and 12.6 hours. Disappearance of CDX was mirrored by appearance of its first active metabolite, desmethylchlordiazepoxide (DMCDX). During once-daily ingestion of 50 mg of CDX.HCl, observed values of CDX accumulation half-life (0.0, 5.8, and 52.5 hours) differed substantially from values predicted based upon the single-dose study; pre-dose steady-state CDX blood concentrations also differed from the predicted values. Accumulation half-lives for the metabolite DMCDX were: 17.7, 9.9, and 15.8 hours. Accumulation in blood of a second active metabolite, demoxepam (DMX), proceeded with half-life values of 21.1, 34.2, and 78.5 hours. Minimum steady-state concentrations of DMCDX and DMX exceeded those of the parent compound. Thus accumulation and persistence of at least two active metabolites during long-term treatment with chlordiazepoxide renders the drug suitable for single-daily dose therapy of anxiety.", 
    "37": "We describe a gas-chromatographic micromethod, with use of a solid injection system and an electron capture detector, for determination of underivatized clonazepam in serum. Vigorous mixing of 100 microliter of serum with 20 microliter of borate buffer (pH 9.0) and 100 microliter of a cyclohexane/dichloromethane mixture (4/6 by vol) containing methyl nitrazepam as internal standard suffices to extract 86% of the clonazepam into the organic layer. We obtained a linear response curve for clonazepam in serum in the concentration range 5 to 150 microgram/liter. The lowest detectable concentration by our method is about 1 microgram/liter of serum. Interference by several anticonvulsant drugs, metabolites, and related compounds was investigated. The assay is simple, rapid, and suitable for clinical routine determination of clonazepam in serum in therapeutic concentrations. We illustrate the steady-state concentration of clonazepam in serum during chronic oral administration to 28 patients.", 
    "38": "1. The effects of diazepam in 5 mg dosage were assessed on a range of psychological tasks. Seventy-eight healthy subjects were tested in an independent groups design; subjects were randomly assigned to either control, placebo or drug group. Treatments were administered orally under double blind conditions. 2. Auditory vigilance performance was unimpaired, in terms of (a) correct detections, (b) false alarms or (c) the subjects' estimates of the duration of the task. 3. The short term retention of digit strings was impaired by diazepam (P less than 0.05), especially for those digits presented in the middle of the sequence. 4. Searching for a few letters among many was significantly impaired by diazepam (P less than 0.01). 5. Diaepam had no effect on performance at a mental arithmetic task; neither was there a placebo effect. 6. Results were discussed in the light of the characteristics of drug sensitive tasks. It was concluded that characteristics such as feedback of results, monotony, and memory load are more likely to be drug sensitive when in combination than in isolation.", 
    "39": "The effects of agents which modulate thromboxane A2 synthesis or action, were tested in the R3230AC transplanted mammary tumour. Three different inhibitors of thromboxane A2 synthesis or action (copper, dipyridamole and diazepam) all caused an increase in tumour growth. Colchicine and melatonin, both stimulators of thromboxane A2 synthesis, inhibited the growth of the tumour significantly.", 
    "40": "Effects of three treatments that induce mouse killing by rats were examined with cats. Food deprivation induced about 50% killing after 24 hr and almost 100% killing by 27 hr. Pilocarpine (at doses of 1.0 mg/kg that produced marked side-effects, and whether or not methyl atropine pretreatment blocked those side-effects) and chlordiazepoxide (at doses of 1.0--2.0 mg/kg) did not induce any killing. Pilocarpine produced a dose-related inhibition of spontaneous mouse killing (as it does in rats), but this was antagonised by methyl atropine. The side-effects of pilocarpine and chlordiazepoxide did not seem to account for their failure to induce killing. In contrast with food deprivation, the mechanisms by which pilocarpine and chloridazepoxide induce killing in rats may not have homologs in cats.", 
    "41": "A sensitive fluorescence--TLC densitometric procedure was developed for the specific determination of diazepam (I) and its two metabolites, desmethyldiazepam (II) and oxazepam (III), in serum. After extraction from serum with benzene, the compounds were separated by TLC and converted with a sulfuric acid spray to greenish-yellow fluorescence spots with Rf values of 0.72, 0.43, and 0.17, respectively. Quantitation of the TLC plate was accomplished by scanning with a densitometer at 380 nm. The sensitivities of the assay were 18 (I), 6 (II), and 5 (III) ng/ml of serum. This procedure was also was applicable to other 1,4-benzodiazepines in biological fluids.", 
    "42": "Mianserin is a tetracyclic compound advocated for the treatment of depressive illness and depression associated with anxiety. It combines antidepressant activity with a sedative effect and has an EEG and clinical activity profile similar to that of amitriptyline. It has an overall efficacy comparable with amitriptyline and imipramine in depressive illness, but at dosages which have achieved a similar overall clinical improvement, mianserin causes significantly fewer anticholinergic side effects than amitriptyline or imipramine and also appears less likely than these drugs to cause serious cardiotoxicity on overdosage. Mianserin also has anti-anxiety activity, but its role in treating patients with anxiety associated with primary depression has still to be clarified. Mianserin appears to be well tolerated by the elderly and by patients with cardiovascular disease, including those recovering from a recent myocardial infarction, and does not appear to antagonise the action of adrenergic neurone blocking antihypertensive drugs or affect the anticoagulant action of phenprocoumon.", 
    "43": "Electron-capture gas-liquid chromatography was used for simultaneous quantitation of plasma diazepam (I) and its major metabolite, desmethyldiazepam(II). Because concentrations of I can greatly exceed those of II after single doses of I, two benzodiazepine-analog internal standards were added to all samples, thereby allowing reliable quantitation of high concentrations of I and low concentrations of II. After extraction at neutral pH with benzene (containing isoamyl alcohol), the organic extract is evaporated and the residue is reconstituted in a small volume of solvent and chromatographed on a 3% OV-17 column. The sensitivity limits are 2 to 3 ng of I or II per milliliter of original sample, with a CV for identical samples of less than 5%. The applicability of the method to single-dose pharmacokinetic studies of I in humans is illustrated.", 
    "44": "In rats and rabbits with chronically implanted electrodes CS-430(10-bromo-2, 3, 7, 11b-tetrahydro--11b-(2-fluorophenyl)-oxazolo(3, 2d) [1, 4]benzodiazepine-6(5H)-one) (3 mg/kg, .o.) decreased the slightly awake period and increased the slow-wave sleep period. The onset time of sleep was significantly shortened. In the rat pre-treated with p-chlorophenylalaine (500 mg/kg, p.o.), the awake period was remarkable increased and the slow wave sleep period was considerably decreased at 48 hours after the pre-treatment. In these rats CS-430 given in the same dose decreased significantly the awake peiod and the onset time of sleep and increased the slow wave sleep period. CS-430 raised the threshold of the arousal response with stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus, but not of the mesencephalic reticular formation. These effects of CS-430 were almost as potent as those of nitrazepam (NZP). CS-430 reduced duration of after-discharges following stimulation of the hippocampus, depressed the decerebrate rigidity and inhibited activity of lumbar gamma-motoneurons in anesthetized cats. CS-430 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited the evoked responses recorded from the proreus gyrus following stimulation of either the baso-magnocellularis of the amygdaloid nuclear or the ventral hippocampus, although such did not inhibit the responses between the olfactory bulb and the pyriform cortex, the thalamus and the sensory-motor cortex. Thus CS-430 has a sleep-inducing effect in animals of almost the same potency as is seen with NZP, and site(s) of the action in the limbic system appear to be specific.", 
    "45": "A study of the pharmacological properties of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine derivatives led to the choice of (+)-1,2,3,11a-tetrahydro-10-methyl-5H-pyrrolol[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11)10H)-dione as a candidate for anxiolytic evaluation in a limited clinical trial in man. Metabolism studies in laboratory animals have pointed to rapid hydroxylation, possibly in the 3 and 11a positions. A series of compouds containing methyl groups in one or more of these positions has been prepared in an effort to block metabolism and thereby obtain more active or longer acting compounds. All of these derivatives were less active than the parent compound.", 
    "46": "Using a common protocol, 9 gastroenterologists assessed the comparative antianxiety efficacy of lorazepam and placebo under double-blind conditions in 48 patients with moderate to severe anxiety associated with chronic enteritis and ulcerative colitis. The initial dose of lorazepam was 3 mg per day given b.i.d., 2 mg h.s. and 1 mg a.m.; the duration of treatment was 4 weeks. The physician-rated Global and Hamilton and patient-rated 35-Item Scales were used. Efficacy was analyzed from the results of the pooled patient data. By all 3 rating scales and at virtually all times of assessment, lorazepam was associated with statistically significantly greater improvement in symptoms related to anxiety associated with chronic enteritis and ulcerative colitis than was placebo. Side effects in general were infrequent. (J Clin Psychiatry 39:[No. 10--2] 53--57, 1978).", 
    "47": "The effectiveness of lorazepam was assessed under double-blind conditions in 70 ambulant patients suffering from anxiety associated with gastrointestinal symptomatology. In this 4-week study, the usual daily dose of lorazepam, 3.0 mg given in a b.i.d. regimen, produced a greater decrease in symptoms associated with anxiety than placebo at almost all evaluation periods, as indicated by Kruskal-Wallis analyses of Global, Hamilton, and 35-Item ratings--a decrease which was clinically and statistically significant. In addition, lorazepam was well accepted and well tolerated by the majority of patients and was compatible with concomitant medications. Side effects were infrequent and usually controlled by dosage adjustment."
