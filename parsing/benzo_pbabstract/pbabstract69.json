We investigated whether this interaction may be partly attributable to disease-related disturbances in metabolism of the major cortical endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). Transcript levels for the recently discovered 2-AG metabolizing enzyme, \u03b1-\u03b2-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6), were assessed using quantitative PCR in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia and healthy subjects (n=84) and antipsychotic- or tetrahydrocannabinol-exposed monkeys. ABHD6 mRNA levels were elevated in schizophrenia subjects who were younger and had a shorter illness duration but not in antipsychotic- or tetrahydrocannabinol-exposed monkeys. Higher ABHD6 mRNA levels may increase 2-AG metabolism which may influence susceptibility to cannabis in the earlier stages of schizophrenia.",

Despite its proven efficacy, most older children and adults object to this route of administration. As a result, many patients do not realize the benefit of a therapy that can improve outcomes and decrease healthcare costs. Intranasal administration of benzodiazepines offers a potential alternative. The primary objective of this study was to compare the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of two novel intranasal (IN) diazepam (DZP) formulations versus intravenous (IV) administration in healthy volunteers. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were randomized into an open-label, three-way crossover study. 10mg doses of two investigational intranasal DZP formulations (solution, suspension) and a 5mg IV dose of commercially available DZP injectable, USP were given. A two-week washout period separated treatments. Plasma samples for DZP analysis were collected pre-dose and at regular intervals up to 240 h post-dose. DZP concentration-time data were analyzed using a non-compartmental pharmacokinetics approach. Exposure following administration of DZP IN solution (absolute bioavailability - 97%) was greater than the IN suspension (absolute bioavailability - 67%). Mean Cmaxvalues for the suspension and solution formulations were 221 ng/mL and 272 ng/mL, respectively. Median time to maximum concentration (Tmax) was 1h and 1.5h for suspension and solution formulation, respectively. Both investigational intranasal formulations were well tolerated. The results of this pilot study indicate that development of an intranasal diazepam formulation with high bioavailability, reasonable variability, and good tolerability is feasible.",

Such cocaine-induced mPFC disinhibition was not observed in adult-exposed animals. Furthermore, the normal developmental upregulation of parvalbumin immunoreactivity observed in the mPFC from PD 35 to PD 65 is lacking following early adolescent cocaine treatment.",

Respective mean K(m) and V(max) values for R- and S-lorazepam glucuronidation by HLM were 29 \u00b1 8.9 and 36 \u00b1 10 \u00b5M, and 7.4 \u00b1 1.9 and 10 \u00b1 3.8 pmol/min \u22c5 mg. Microsomal intrinsic clearances were not significantly different, suggesting the in vivo clearances of R- and S-lorazepam are likely to be similar. Both R- and S-lorazepam were glucuronidated by UGT2B4, 2B7, and 2B15, whereas R-lorazepam was additionally metabolized by the extrahepatic enzymes UGT1A7 and 1A10. Based on in vitro clearances and consideration of available in vivo and in vitro data, UGT2B15 is likely to play an important role in the glucuronidation of R- and S-lorazepam. However, the possible contribution of other enzymes and the low activities observed in vitro indicate that the lorazepam enantiomers are of limited use as substrate probes for UGT2B15. To identify potential drug-drug interactions, codeine, fluconazole, ketamine, ketoconazole, methadone, morphine, valproic acid, and zidovudine were screened as inhibitors of R- and S-lorazepam glucuronidation by HLM. In vitro-in vivo extrapolation suggested that, of these drugs, only ketoconazole had the potential to inhibit lorazepam clearance to a clinically significant extent.",

He had not been known to have any neuromuscular diseases or psychiatric diseases, with the exception of anxiety disorder. Brain computed tomography did not show cerebrovascular disorders. Consultation with a neurologist led to a suspicion of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). Epidural droperidol was stopped and administration of dantrolene was initiated. These measures, in addition to supportive care, only partially ameliorated the symptoms of the patient, and consciousness disturbance developed; the patient finally became comatose on POD3. However, intravenous diazepam (10 mg) improved his symptoms abruptly. Subsequently, oral administration of lorazepam (1 mg/day) was started, and his symptoms disappeared within 2 days (POD5). Although NMS-like symptoms are rarely seen in clinical practice, some factors may induce it during the perioperative period, such as the administration of dopamine antagonists and the cessation of benzodiazepines.

In an effort to develop better tolerated medicines, we have identified dual orexin 1 and 2 receptor antagonists (DORAs), which promote sleep in preclinical animal models and humans. We compare the effects of orally administered eszopiclone, zolpidem, and diazepam to the dual orexin receptor antagonist DORA-22 on sleep and the novel object recognition test in rat, and on sleep and two cognition tests (delayed match to sample and serial choice reaction time) in the rhesus monkey. Each compound's minimal dose that promoted sleep versus the minimal dose that exerted deficits in these cognitive tests was determined, and a therapeutic margin was established. We found that DORA-22 has a wider therapeutic margin for sleep versus cognitive impairment in rat and rhesus monkey compared to the other compounds tested. These data were further supported with the demonstration of a wider therapeutic margin for DORA-22 compared to the other compounds on sleep versus the expression of hippocampal activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc), an immediate-early gene product involved in synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that DORAs might provide an effective treatment for insomnia with a greater therapeutic margin for sleep versus cognitive disturbances compared to the GABAA-positive allosteric modulators currently in use.",

The main objective was to achieve and maintain the desired sedation level: observed RASS = target RASS \u00b1 1. Three hundred high-risk patients were planned to be randomly assigned to receive either intravenous propofol/midazolam or enteral melatonin/hydroxyzine/lorazepam. Group assignment occurred through online minimization process, in order to balance variables potentially influencing the outcomes (age, sex, SAPS II, type of admission, kidney failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sepsis) between groups. Once per shift, the staff recorded neurological monitoring using validated tools. Three flowcharts for pain, sedation, and delirium have been proposed; they have been designed to treat potentially correctable factors first, and, only once excluded, to administer neuroactive drugs. The study lasted from January 24 to December 31, 2012. A total of 348 patients have been randomized, through a centralized website, using a specific software expressly designed for this study. The created network of ICUs included a mix of both university and non-university hospitals, with different experience in managing enteral sedation. A dedicated free-access website was also created, in both Italian and English, for continuous education of ICU staff through CME courses.",

All evaluated single agents and combinations were found to be effective for AWS prevention. Clomethiazol was found to be associated with a higher tracheobronchitis rate and thus disadvised for critically ill patients. For AWS therapy, BZO, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and clomethiazol were evaluated in randomized controlled trials as single agents and phenobarbital, clonidine, and haloperidol as adjuncts. All evaluated regimens were found to be effective for AWS therapy. Overall, in the ICU, BZO were found to be superior to GHB and clomethiazol regarding safety and efficacy. Furthermore, 4 cohort trials with historical control groups evaluated the effect of the implementation of a standardized protocol of BZO therapy for AWS in ICUs. All of these 4 studies found better outcome for the intervention groups.",

    "71": "Signaling pathways involving phospholipase C (PLC) are involved in various neural functions. Understanding how these pathways are regulated will lead to a better understanding of their roles in neural functions. Previous studies demonstrated that receptor-driven PLC\u03b2 activation depends on intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i), suggesting the possibility that PLC\u03b2-dependent cellular responses are basically Ca(2+) dependent. To test this possibility, we examined whether modulations of ion channels driven by PLC-coupled metabotropic receptors are sensitive to [Ca(2+)]i using cultured hippocampal neurons. Muscarinic activation triggered an inward current at -100 mV (the equilibrium potential for K(+)) in a subpopulation of neurons. This current response was suppressed by pirenzepine (an M1-preferring antagonist), PLC inhibitor, non-selective cation channel blocker, and lowering [Ca(2+)]i. Using the neurons showing no response at -100 mV, effects of muscarinic activation on K(+) channels were examined at -40 mV. Muscarinic activation induced a transient decrease of the holding outward current. This current response was mimicked and occluded by XE991, an M-current K(+) channel blocker, suppressed by pirenzepine, PLC inhibitor and lowering [Ca(2+)]i, and enhanced by elevating [Ca(2+)]i. Similar results were obtained when group I metabotropic glutamate receptors were activated instead of muscarinic receptors. These results clearly show that ion channel modulations driven by PLC-coupled metabotropic receptors are dependent on [Ca(2+)]i, supporting the hypothesis that cellular responses induced by receptor-driven PLC\u03b2 activation are basically Ca(2+) dependent.",

Long-acting injectable (LAI) anti-psychotic drugs, developed to improve adherence and provide and alternative antipsychotic drug treatment fro schizophrenia, have been associated with improved treatment outcomes including reduction of relapse rates approximately 30% and reduction in hospitalizations. However, LAI antipsychotic drugs remain underutilized in the United States despite a growing body of literature supporting positive outcomes of LAI versus oral antipsychotic drugs.

Here we used pharmacological conditioning with carbamazepine, dextrometorphan, lorazepam, and placebo to elucidate the type of plasticity underlying this facilitation, and to probe if mechanisms reminiscent of long-term potentiation are involved. Over the primary motor cortex of 10 healthy subjects, we applied biphasic rTMS pulses of effective posterior current direction in the brain. We used six blocks of 200 pulses at 5-Hz frequency and 90% active motor threshold intensity and controlled for corticospinal excitability changes using motor-evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and latencies elicited by suprathreshold pulses before, in between, and after rTMS. Target muscle was the dominant abductor digiti minimi muscle; we coregistered the dominant extensor carpi radialis muscle. We found a lasting facilitation induced by this type of rTMS. The GABAergic medication lorazepam and to a lesser extent the ion channel blocker carbamazepine reduced the MEP facilitation after biphasic effective posteriorly oriented rTMS, whereas the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-antagonist dextrometorphan had no effect. Our main conclusion is that the mechanism of the facilitation induced by biphasic effective posterior rTMS is more likely posttetanic potentiation than long-term potentiation. Additional findings were prolonged MEP latency under carbamazepine, consistent with sodium channel blockade, and larger MEP amplitudes from extensor carpi radialis under lorazepam, suggesting GABAergic involvement in the center-surround balance of excitability.",

Exposures to risperidone, quetiapine and olanzapine were assessed during the 30 days prior to the stroke episode. We set two control periods with lengths which were the same as the hazard periods. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by conditional logistic regression. A total of 1601 cases of ischemic stroke with a mean age of 75.6 (\u00b16.7) years were identified, among which 933 (58.3%) were female. An increased risk of ischemic stroke was associated with the use of risperidone (aOR=3.5, 95% CI 3.3-4.6) and quetiapine (aOR=2.7, 95% CI 2.0-3.6) during the 30 days prior to stroke: however, no significant risk was observed with olanzapine (aOR=1.2, 95% CI 0.7-2.0).

The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor is the primary mediator of central inhibitory neurotransmission, and GABA-receptor agonists are well known to convey anxiolytic effects. Using an in vitro screening approach to identify naturally occurring phytochemical GABA agonists, we discovered the plant secondary metabolite p-coumaric acid to have significant GABAergic activity, an effect that could be blocked by co-administration of the specific GABA-receptor antagonist, picrotoxin. Oral administration of p-coumaric acid to rodents induced a significant anxiolytic effect in vivo as measured using the elevated plus paradigm, in line with the effects of oral diazepam. Given that p-coumaric acid is reasonably well absorbed following oral consumption in man and is relatively nontoxic, it may be suitable for the formulation of a safe and effective anxiolytic functional food.",

It has recently become clear that the central nervous system is not spared from the deleterious effects of diabetes, since diabetic encephalopathy was recognized as a complication of this heterogeneous metabolic disorder. There is a well recognized association between depression and diabetes, once prevalence of depression in diabetic patients is higher than in general population, and clonazepam is being used to treat this complication. Oxidative stress is widely accepted as playing a key mediatory role in the development and progression of diabetes and its complications. In this work we analyzed DNA damage by comet assay and lipid damage in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats submitted to the forced swimming test. It was verified that the diabetic group presented DNA and lipid damage in the brain areas evaluated, when compared to the control groups. Additionally, a significant reduction of the DNA and lipid damage in animals treated with insulin and/or clonazepam was observed. These data suggest that the association of these two drugs could protect against DNA and lipid damage in diabetic rats submitted to the forced swimming test, an animal model of depression.",

The PTP is regulated by matrix cyclophilin D (CyPD), which also binds the lateral stalk of the FOF1 ATP synthase. We show that CyPD binds the oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein subunit of the enzyme at the same site as the ATP synthase inhibitor benzodiazepine 423 (Bz-423), that Bz-423 sensitizes the PTP to Ca(2+) like CyPD itself, and that decreasing oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein expression by RNAi increases the sensitivity of the PTP to Ca(2+). Purified dimers of the ATP synthase, which did not contain voltage-dependent anion channel or adenine nucleotide translocator, were reconstituted into lipid bilayers. In the presence of Ca(2+), addition of Bz-423 triggered opening of a channel with currents that were typical of the mitochondrial megachannel, which is the PTP electrophysiological equivalent. Channel openings were inhibited by the ATP synthase inhibitor AMP-PNP (\u03b3-imino ATP, a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) and Mg(2+)/ADP.

However, HRN mice still exhibit low levels of mono-oxygenase activity in spite of the absence of detectable reductase protein. To investigate whether this is because cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome b(5) reductase can act as the sole electron donor to the P450 system, we crossed HRN with HBN mice to generate a line lacking hepatic expression of both electron donors (HBRN). HBRN mice exhibited exacerbation of the phenotypic characteristics of the HRN line: liver enlargement, hepatosteatosis, and increased expression of certain P450s. Also, drug metabolizing activities in vitro were further reduced relative to the HRN model, in some cases to undetectable levels. Pharmacokinetic studies in vivo demonstrated that midazolam half-life, C(max), and area under the concentration-time curve were increased, and clearance was decreased, to a greater extent in the HBRN line than in either the HBN or HRN model. Microsomal incubations using NADPH concentrations below the apparent K(m) of cytochrome b(5) reductase, but well above that for POR, led to the virtual elimination of 7-benzyloxyquinoline turnover in HRN samples. These data provide strong evidence that cytochrome b(5)/cytochrome b(5) reductase can act as a sole electron donor to the P450 system in vitro and in vivo.",

    "160": "The chronic use of opioids in humans, accompanied by the development of tolerance, is a dangerous phenomenon in its own right. However, chronic opioid use is often made more dangerous by the coconsumption of other substances. It has been observed that the blood level of opioids in postmortem analyses of addicts, who consumed ethanol along with the opioid, was much less than that observed in individuals who died from opioids alone. This relationship between ethanol and opioids led us to investigate the hypothesis that ethanol alters tolerance to opioids. In the present study, we report that ethanol significantly and dose-dependently reduced the antinociceptive tolerance produced by morphine and the cross-tolerance between [D-Ala2,N-Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) and morphine in the mouse tail-flick test. The reversal of morphine tolerance was partially blocked by both the gamma receptor blocker bicuculline and by the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)(B) receptor blocker phaclofen and the administration of both inhibitors completely reversed the effects of ethanol on morphine tolerance. Diazepam, like ethanol, decreased morphine tolerance. However, this inhibition was reversed by the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline but not by the GABA(B) antagonist phaclofen. These findings have important implications for individuals who abuse opioids and ethanol as well as suggest a mechanism to reduce the amount of opioid needed in chronic pain treatment.",

A new delivery modality has been devised using an inhalation-activated, thermally generated drug aerosol which can produce peak plasma concentrations in a few minutes.

    "172": "Translocator protein (TSPO; 18 kDA) is a high-affinity cholesterol-binding protein that is integrally involved in cholesterol transfer from intracellular stores into mitochondria, the rate-determining step in steroid formation. Previous studies have shown that TSPO drug ligands are able to activate steroid production by MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells and by mitochondria isolated from steroidogenic cells. We hypothesized herein that the direct, pharmacological activation of TSPO might induce aged Leydig cells, which are characterized by reduced T production, to produce significantly higher levels of T both in vitro and in vivo. To test this, we first examined the in vitro effects of the TSPO selective and structurally distinct drug ligands N,N-dihexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indole-3-acetamide (FGIN-1-27) and benzodiazepine 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864) on steroidogenesis by Leydig cells isolated from aged (21-24 months old) and young adult (3-6 months old) Brown Norway rats. The ligands stimulated Leydig cell T production significantly, and equivalently, in cells of both ages, an effect that was significantly inhibited by the specific TSPO inhibitor 5-androsten-3,17,19-triol (19-Atriol). Additionally, we examined the in vivo effects of administering FGIN-1-27 to young and aged rats. In both cases, serum T levels increased significantly, consistent with the in vitro results. Indeed, serum T levels in aged rats administered FGIN-1-27 were equivalent to T levels in the serum of control young rats. Taken together, these results indicate that although there are reduced amounts of TSPO in aged Leydig cells, its direct activation is able to increase T production. We suggest that this approach might serve as a therapeutic means to increase steroid levels in vivo in cases of primary hypogonadism.", 
    "173": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a common sensory motor neurological disorder that is characterised by an irresistible urge to move the legs that significantly affects the quality of life of the patient. Prevalence in the general population is 5-25% and it is twice as prevalent in women as in men. RLS is the most common movement disorder in pregnancy with a fourfold increased risk of developing this disorder later in life. The pathophysiology of RLS is centred on dopaminergic dysfunction, reduced central nervous system iron, genetic linkages, or alteration in neurotransmitters such as hypocretins, endorphins levels and immune dysfunction and inflammatory mechanisms. With the emergence of new evidence, there are changes to the previous treatment recommendations for RLS. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that dopamine agonists such as rotigotine transdermal patch, pramipexole, ropinirole, gabapentin enacarbil, pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in the short-term treatment of RLS and rotigotine, followed by gabapentin enacarbil, ropinirole, pramipexole and gabapentin for long-term treatment. Based on expert consensus, the recommendation for daily RLS is dopamine agonists or gabapentin or low-potency opioids. Levodopa is less preferred for treating daily RLS due to its high risk of augmentation. For intermittent RLS, it is levodopa or dopamine agonists or low-potency opioids or benzodiazepines. For refractory RLS, the choice is to change to gabapentin or a different dopamine agonist, addition of a second agent like gabapentin or benzodiazepine to the existing drug or changing to a high-potency opioid or tramadol. Medications with safety record in pregnancy include opioids and antiepileptics such as carbamazepine and gabapentin. There are concerns that patients with RLS are at risk for metabolic deregulation, autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular morbidity. However, a recent study concluded that RLS is not associated with increased risk of cardiovascular complications.",

The extract was orally administered at dosages of 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg/kg of body weight. The CJ-induced behavioral changes were assessed using the open-field and elevated-plus maze test. The ethanol extract of CJ did not affect overall locomotor activity of mice in the open-field test, however, it showed increase exploration in the unprotected center zone, which is thought to reflect anxiolyticlike effects. Furthermore, the CJ extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) significantly increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms of the elevated plus-maze, indicating the anxiolytic effects of the substance. This anxiolytic effects of the extract were comparable to that of the benzodiazepine, diazepam. To further characterize the anxiolytic activities of CJ, its action on human neuroblastoma cells were assessed. The CJ extract dose-dependently increased chloride ion (Cl(\u2012)) influx, which was blocked by coadministration of the GABA(A) receptor competitive antagonist, bicuculline, suggesting a GABA(A) receptor - Cl(\u2012)) channel mechanism of action. Taken altogether, the present study demonstrates that the ethanol extract of CJ has anxiolytic effects, probably mediated through GABAergic neurotransmission.", 
    "175": "Analgesics and sedatives are frequently used in the treatment of acute brain injury and subsequent brain swelling. Most agents act on specific receptors to modulate neuronal activity, which is normally involved in feedback loops that direct system building and maintenance. We investigated the neurodegenerative effects of midazolam and isoflurane in a rat model of controlled cortical impact injury (CCII). Two hours prior to CCII, four experimental groups were treated with different agents including a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC 1.0) of isoflurane. For additional sedation, isoflurane MAC 1.67, midazolam alone, or midazolam in combination with flumazenil was used. Blood pressure and blood gas analysis were monitored to investigate systemic side effects. Two days after treatment, relative apoptotic cell counts were determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method. With isoflurane and midazolam, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings revealed a decrease in amplitude size and altered frequency distribution. Treatment using deep sedation with isoflurane MAC 1.67 or midazolam increased relative apoptotic cell count by 14.8% (95% CI 3.6 to 26.1, p<0.01) and 18.0% (95% CI 6.8 to 29.3, p<0.01), respectively. Co-treatment with flumazenil reversed the neurodegenerative effect of midazolam by -13.2% (95% CI -24.5 to -2.0, p<0.05). Functional neurological outcome was worse after isoflurane MAC 1.67 (18.8 score points; p<0.01) and midazolam (21.4 score points, p<0.001). Flumazenil antagonized the neurodegenerative effects of midazolam. In conclusion, neuronal survival and functional recovery are reduced by sedative use in a rat model of acute brain injury.",

Rats were repeated administered with physiological saline (negative control group), ketoconazole (75 mg/kg, positive control group) or varied doses of Sch B (experimental groups) for three consecutive days. Subsequently, changes in hepatic microsomal CYP3A activity and the pharmacokinetic profiles of midazolam and 1'-hydroxy midazolam in plasma were studied to evaluate CYP3A activity. The results indicated that Sch B significantly dose-dependently inhibited rat hepatic microsomal CYP3A activity with Ki value of 16.64 mg/kg and showed the characteristic of a noncompetitive inhibitor. Oral administration of Sch B for 3 days in rats produced significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral midazolam. Sch B resulted in a significant, dose-dependent increase in midazolam AUC0-\u221e except at the dose of 2 mg/kg, while AUC0-\u221e increased by 26.1% (8 mg/kg) and 60.6% (16 mg/kg), respectively. In the pharmacokinetic profiles of 1'-hydroxy midazolam, the significant, dose-dependent decrease in AUC0-\u221e was observed except at the dose of 2 mg/kg, while AUC0-\u221e reduced by 44.5% (8 mg/kg) and 49.2% (16 mg/kg), respectively. These results suggested that 3-day treatment of Sch B could increase concentration and oral bioavailability of drug metabolized by CYP3A. When the drug, consisting of Sch B, is used in the clinic for more than 3 days, the possible drug-drug interactions should be taken into consideration.",

    "205": "The parasubiculum (PaS) is a component of the hippocampal formation that sends its major output to layer II of the entorhinal cortex. The PaS receives strong cholinergic innervation from the basal forebrain that is likely to modulate neuronal excitability and contribute to theta-frequency network activity. The present study used whole cell current- and voltage-clamp recordings to determine the effects of cholinergic receptor activation on layer II PaS neurons. Bath application of carbachol (CCh; 10-50 \u00b5M) resulted in a dose-dependent depolarization of morphologically-identified layer II stellate and pyramidal cells that was not prevented by blockade of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Bath application of the M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (1 \u00b5M), but not the M2-preferring antagonist methoctramine (1 \u00b5M), blocked the depolarization, suggesting that it is dependent on M1 receptors. Voltage-clamp experiments using ramped voltage commands showed that CCh resulted in the gradual development of an inward current that was partially blocked by concurrent application of the selective Kv7.2/3 channel antagonist XE-991, which inhibits the muscarine-dependent K(+) current I M. The remaining inward current also reversed near EK and was inhibited by the K(+) channel blocker Ba(2+), suggesting that M1 receptor activation attenuates both I M as well as an additional K(+) current. The additional K(+) current showed rectification at depolarized voltages, similar to K(+) conductances mediated by Kir 2.3 channels. The cholinergic depolarization of layer II PaS neurons therefore appears to occur through M1-mediated effects on I M as well as an additional K(+) conductance.",

Considering that PRG is currently under investigation for the treatment of benzodiazepine dependence and withdrawal as well as relapse prevention in alcohol dependence, assessment of PRG's abuse and dependence potential is indispensable. We report the case of a 38-year-old female patient with borderline personality disorder and past alcohol abuse who developed PRG abuse. The patient took up to 800 mg PRG per day, initially administered to treat unspecific anxiety, and experienced euphoric feelings after PRG intake. In the further course, she increased the daily PRG dosage and consulted other physicians to receive additional PRG prescriptions. During reduction of PRG, the patient developed a moderate withdrawal syndrome with vegetative symptoms. Because of the early detection of the developing PRG abuse (4 months after first application of PRG), the development of PRG dependence was prevented. This case illustrates the possibility of PRG to trigger the development of addictive behaviors and should encourage physicians to be very careful when administering PRG to patients with current or past substance-related disorders.",

Their determination in biological fluids, mainly urine, is of primary importance; nevertheless, although they are excreted almost entirely as metabolites, available methods deal mainly with the determination of the unmetabolized drug. This paper describes a method for the determination in urine of Z-compounds and their metabolites by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and UHPLC coupled with high resolution/high accuracy Orbitrap\u00ae mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). The metabolic profile was studied on real samples collected from subjects in therapy with zolpidem or zopiclone; the main urinary metabolites were identified and their MS behaviour studied by MS/MS and HRMS. Two carboxy- and three hydroxy- metabolites, that could be also detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as trimethylsylyl derivatives, have been identified for zolpidem. Also, at least one dihydroxilated metabolite was detected. As for zopiclone, the two main metabolites detected were N-demethyl and N-oxide zopiclone. For both substances, the unmetabolized compounds were excreted in low amounts in urine. In consideration of these data, a UHPLC-MS/MS method for the determination of Z-compounds and their main metabolites after isotopic dilution with deuterated analogues of zolpidem and zopiclone and direct injection of urine samples was set up. The proposed UHPLC-MS/MS method appears to be practically applicable for the analysis of urine samples in analytical and forensic toxicology cases, as well as in cases of suspected DFSA.",

Population pharmacokinetic modeling with systematic covariate analysis was performed by use of NONMEM v6.2.", 
    "243": "Across the entire lifespan from premature neonates to adults, bodyweight was a significant covariate for midazolam clearance. The effect of bodyweight was best described by use of an allometric equation with an exponent changing with bodyweight in an exponential manner from 0.84 for preterm neonates (0.77\u00a0kg) to 0.44 for adults (89\u00a0kg), showing that the most rapid maturation occurs during the youngest age range.", 
    "244": "An in-vivo maturation function for midazolam clearance from premature neonates to adults has been developed. This function can be used to derive evidence-based doses for children, and to simulate exposure to midazolam and possibly other CYP3A substrates across the pediatric age range in population pharmacokinetic models or physiologically based pharmacokinetic models.", 
    "245": "In Flemish emergency psychiatry droperidol is still an option for the treatment of agitation. However, its efficacy and safety are contested.", 
    "246": "To find out whether the continuing use of droperidol to treat agitation is justified on scientific grounds.", 
    "247": "Randomised controlled trials of droperidol (intramuscular or intravenous) were traced via a systematic search of the literature. These data were supplemented with a description of the drug\u2019s most important pharmacological properties and a survey of the literature on cardiac side-effects and of the place accorded to droperidol in some guidelines.", 
    "248": "The efficacy and safety of droperidol (IM/IV) were studied in 8 randomised control-led trials: 352 patients treated with droperidol. Droperidol was compared with benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and combination treatment. A single injection of droperidol was successful in 64-92% of patients. Droperidol tended to act faster and be more effective than haloperidol and lorazepam. There were very few side-effects. No clinically important cardiac side-effects were reported; this is also in keeping with evidence revealed in systematic reviews on the subject. The ecological validity of the trials was high.", 
    "249": "In spite of a decline in the popularity of droperidol in most guidelines, the drug still seems to play a valuable role in the treatment of the agitated patient. Because it acts rapidly over a short period of time and is safe to use in patients with high (co)morbidity, it is still in favour with many health professionals.", 
    "250": "Awake fibreoptic intubation (AFOI) is the gold standard of management of the predicted difficult airway. Sedation is frequently used to make the process more tolerable to patients. It is not always easy to strike a balance between patient comfort and good intubating conditions on the one hand and maintaining ventilation and a patent airway on the other. In the last 30 years, many drugs and drug combinations have been described, but there is very little in the literature to help guide the practitioner to choose between them. The objective of this article is to discuss the evidence supporting the use of the agents described with regard to their efficacy, recommended doses and techniques, and limitations to their use for AFOI.", 
    "251": "Publication databases were searched for articles published from 1996 to 2012 relating to sedation for AFOI.", 
    "252": "Benzodiazepines, propofol, opioids, alpha2-adrenoceptor agonists, and ketamine are the main classes of drugs that have been described to facilitate AFOI. Drugs that are most suitable have a combination of both anxiolytic and analgesic properties. The ideal choice of drug may vary depending on the patient and the indication for AFOI.", 
    "253": "There is good evidence to support the use of two drugs in particular, remifentanil and dexmedetomidine. Each has certain unique characteristics that make them an attractive choice for an AFOI.", 
    "254": "In the UK, two treatment options are used for acute epileptic seizures in the community-rectal diazepam and unlicensed buccal midazolam. In practice, the former is rarely used, with unlicensed buccal midazolam being widely recommended and prescribed by physicians. In September 2011, Buccolam(\u00ae) (licensed midazolam oromucosal solution) became the first medicine to receive a Paediatric-Use Marketing Authorization (PUMA) and it is indicated for the treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures by caregivers in the community for children (aged 6 months to <18 years) diagnosed with epilepsy. The approval process for a PUMA product differs from other marketing authorization processes and may be based upon small population subsets and may not, in some cases, require new safety or efficacy data to be generated; a similar situation to that seen for orphan drugs. This can lead to challenges when conducting economic evaluations.", 
    "255": "The aim of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of Buccolam(\u00ae) for children with a diagnosis of epilepsy suffering prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures occurring in the UK community setting. DESIGN AND PERSPECTIVE: A hybrid model was developed according to a UK payer perspective. The model included a time-to-event simulation for the frequency and location of occurrence of seizures, along with a decision-tree model that assessed the treatment pathway when a seizure occured. The model compared treatment with Buccolam(\u00ae) with standard care in the community (95 % unlicensed buccal midazolam and 5 % rectal diazepam) or either treatment alone. The model was informed by data from a variety of sources, including clinical effectiveness estimates, and costs based on published UK data, using 2012-13 prices, where possible. To determine current practice and real-world effectiveness, a Delphi panel and a survey of parents of children with epilepsy were conducted.", 
    "256": "Buccolam(\u00ae) showed a reduction in costs of \u00a32,939 compared with standard care, \u00a314,269 compared with rectal diazepam alone and \u00a3886 compared with unlicensed buccal midazolam alone. Increases of 0.025, 0.082 and 0.013 quality-adjusted life-years, respectively, were also seen. Buccolam(\u00ae) remained dominant across a range of scenario analyses.", 
    "257": "This model demonstrates the possibility of constructing a thorough economic case when trial or real-world data are not available. The results of the model show Buccolam(\u00ae) to be cost saving compared with rectal diazepam due to a reduction in the need for ambulance callouts and hospital stays, and compared with unlicensed buccal midazolam, through reduced drug costs and wastage.", 
    "258": "The objective of the study was to establish an in vivo method for assessing cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) activity using therapeutically inert nanogram doses of midazolam. We administered four escalating single doses of oral midazolam (0.0001-3\u2009mg) to 12 healthy participants, stratified according to CYP3A5 carrier status, to assess pharmacokinetics linearity. We then evaluated the interactions with the CYP3A inhibitor ketoconazole (400\u2009mg q.d.) after nanogram and regular doses of midazolam. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and peak plasma concentration (C(max)) were linear over the entire range of doses. Ketoconazole reduced midazolam oral clearance by 92.8%. AUC and C(max) increased by 1,540 and 363%, respectively. CYP3A5 carrier status had no influence on midazolam oral clearance or its inhibition by ketoconazole. This is the first study showing that midazolam pharmacokinetics is linear in a 30,000-fold concentration range, and therefore that nano- and microgram doses of midazolam can reliably predict the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in therapeutic doses and can be used to assess CYP3A activity even in the presence of strong CYP3A inhibitors."
