    "0": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by pervasive and highly distressing anxiety and worries, is associated with severe impairment. Although numerous agents from various drug classes are available to treat GAD, as many as 50% of patients have inadequate response, constituting an important medical frontier. In the face of this challenge, new pharmacological alternatives need to be further studied aiming at clinical improvement and better quality of life for patients. To assess the efficacy of pregabalin (PGB) compared with placebo for amelioration of anxiety symptoms in patients with GAD. A systematic literature search was performed using databases such as MEDLINE and EMBASE and other sources. The main outcome was Hedges' g for continuous scores. We used a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was evaluated with the I (moderate heterogeneity was assumed if I was >50% and high heterogeneity if I was >75%) and the \u03c7-test (P<0.10 for heterogeneity). Publication bias was evaluated using the funnel plot. Meta-regression was performed using the random-effects model. For safety evaluation, we compared patients' dropout rates. We included eight randomized-controlled trials (n=2299) in our study, comparing the use of PGB in different dosages and placebo. In terms of the main outcome, PGB was found to be superior to the placebo group (Hedges' g=0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.30-0.44). The funnel plot assessment showed a low risk of publication bias. Between-study heterogeneity was not significant (I=0%), strengthening our results. Meta-regression showed no particular influence of any variable on the results. A categorical analysis of safety, using dropout as the most severe possible outcome, was carried out. No difference between PGB and placebo groups was observed in terms of the dropout rates. PGB was superior to placebo for the amelioration of GAD symptoms. In addition, the dropout rate was not significantly higher than that of the placebo groups. PGB was comparable to benzodiazepines in clinical response, but had lower dropout rates than benzodiazepine.", 
    "1": "Frequency and gender differences of psychiatric medication intake in a sample of suicide victims from the Athens Greater Area were investigated with a particular focus on the implications for suicide prevention. Data were collected from the toxicological analyses of the suicide cases of the period November 2007-October 2009. Information was available for 262 individuals, 196 men (74.8%) and 66 women (25.2%); 109 of these (41.6%) were receiving psychiatric medication(s). Women were statistically more frequently under treatment: antidepressants (32.8% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001), antiepileptics (9.1% vs. 0.5%, p = 0.001), antipsychotics (24.2% vs. 9.2%, p = 0.003), and benzodiazepines (16.7% vs. 6.6%, p = 0.024). Campaigns aiming to bring men with psychological difficulties in contact with mental health services and to lessen the stigma of mental illness, together with better training of nonpsychiatrists into \"suspecting\" \"male\" depression, could be particularly helpful for decreasing male suicides. More thoughtful choice of psychiatric medication could possibly already prevent a number of female suicides.", 
    "2": "Poisoning with impaired mental state is a frequent cause for hospital admission. The initial management includes assessment of vital functions and airway management followed by focussed diagnostics. Poison Emergency Centers can provide valuable assistance in acute intoxications. Clinically important agents causing mental state alterations include opiates, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol, methanol and ethylene glycol, carbon monoxide and salicylates. Most important therapeutic measures comprise supportive care, decontamination or elimination. For certain toxins specific antidotes are available. In presence of severe intoxications and impaired vital functions, the patient should be transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU).", 
    "3": "A high performance liquid chromatographic method with ultra violet detection for simultaneous analysis of six benzodiazepines (BZDs) (chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clonazepam, midazolam , flurazpam, and lorazepam) has been developed for forensic screening of adulterated non-alcoholic drinks. Samples were analyzed after a simple procedure for preparation using pH adjustment and filtering. Isocratic elution on a C18 column (250mm \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5\u03bcm) in the temperature 45\u00baC with a mobile phase consisting of 15mM phosphate buffer: methanol (50:50 v/v) at a flow rate 1.4 mL/min has been done. The column eluent was monitored with a UV detector at 245 nm. This allowed a rapid detection and identification as well as quantization of the eluting peaks. Calibration curves for all drugs in the range of 0.5- 10 \u00b5g/ mL that all the linear regression and has more than 0.996. Recovery rates for the BZDs were in the range 93.7- 108.7%. The limits of detection were calculated between 0.01- 0.02 \u00b5g/ mL. Also, the limits of quantification were 0.03- 0.05 \u00b5g/mL. Within-day and between -day coefficient of variation for all BZDs at all concentrations in the range of 0.45 - 7.69 % was calculated. The procedure can provide a simple, sensitive and fast method for the screening of six BZDs in adulterated soft drinks in forensic analysis.", 
    "4": "Poisoning with opioid analgesics including tramadol represents a challenge. Tramadol may induce respiratory depression, seizures and serotonin syndrome, possibly worsened when in combination to benzodiazepines. Our objectives were to investigate tramadol-related neurotoxicity, consequences of diazepam/tramadol combination, and mechanisms of drug-drug interactions in rats. Median lethal-doses were determined using Dixon-Bruce's up-and-down method. Sedation, seizures, electroencephalography and plethysmography parameters were studied. Concentrations of tramadol and its metabolites were measured using liquid-chromatography-high-resolution-mass-spectrometry. Plasma, platelet and brain monoamines were measured using liquid-chromatography coupled to fluorimetry. Median lethal-doses of tramadol and diazepam/tramadol combination did not significantly differ, although time-to-death was longer with combination (P=0.04). Tramadol induced dose-dependent sedation (P<0.05), early-onset seizures (P<0.001) and increase in inspiratory (P<0.01) and expiratory times (P<0.05). The diazepam/tramadol combination abolished seizures but significantly enhanced sedation (P<0.01) and respiratory depression (P<0.05) by reducing tidal volume (P<0.05) in addition to tramadol-related increase in respiratory times, suggesting a pharmacodynamic mechanism of interaction. Plasma M1 and M5 metabolites were mildly increased, contributing additionally to tramadol-related respiratory depression. Tramadol-induced early-onset increase in brain concentrations of serotonin and norepinephrine was not significantly altered by the diazepam/tramadol combination. Interestingly neither pretreatment with cyproheptadine (a serotonin-receptor antagonist) nor a benserazide/5-hydroxytryptophane combination (enhancing brain serotonin) reduced tramadol-induced seizures. Our study shows that diazepam/tramadol combination does not worsen tramadol-induced fatality risk but alters its toxicity pattern with enhanced respiratory depression but abolished seizures. Drug-drug interaction is mainly pharmacodynamic but increased plasma M1 and M5 metabolites may also contribute to enhancing respiratory depression. Tramadol-induced seizures are independent of brain serotonin.", 
    "5": "Activation of A1 adenosine receptors (ARs) has been associated with anxiolytic-like effects in different behavioral tests, but development of A1AR agonists for therapeutic use has been hampered, most likely due to the presence of side effects. With the aim to identify a safer approach for the treatment of anxiety, we investigated, in mice, the anxiolytic-like properties of a novel A1AR positive allosteric modulator, TRR469. Acute administration of TRR469 (0.3-3\u00a0mg/kg) resulted in robust anxiolytic-like effects in the elevated plus maze, the dark/light box, the open field and the marble burying tests. The magnitude of the anxiolytic action of TRR469 was comparable to that obtained with benzodiazepine diazepam (1\u00a0mg/kg). The use of the A1AR antagonist DPCPX (3\u00a0mg/kg) suggested that the effects of TRR469 were mediated by this receptor subtype. In contrast to diazepam, the novel positive allosteric modulator did not potentiate the sedative effect of ethanol (3.5\u00a0g/kg) evaluated by the loss of righting reflex. While diazepam produced motor coordination impairment in the rotarod test, this effect being enhanced by the presence of ethanol (1.5\u00a0g/kg), TRR469 did not elicit locomotor disturbances either when administered alone or in the presence of ethanol. In\u00a0vitro, TRR469 was able to increase the number of A1AR recognizable by the agonist radioligand [(3)H]-CCPA in mouse brain regions involved in emotional processes. TRR469 markedly increased the affinity of the agonist CCPA, suggesting the capability, in\u00a0vivo, to increase the affinity of endogenous adenosine. Taken together, these findings indicate that the positive allosteric modulation of A1AR may represent a promising approach for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders.", 
    "6": "Mal de d\u00e9barquement syndrome (MdDS) is typified by a prolonged rocking sensation - for a month or longer - that begins immediately following a lengthy exposure to motion. The provoking motion is usually a sea voyage. About 80% of MdDS sufferers are women, and most of them are middle-aged. MdDS patients are troubled by more migraine headaches than controls. Unlike dizziness caused by vestibular disorders or motion sickness, the symptoms of MdDS usually improve with re-exposure to motion. The long duration of symptoms - a month or more - distinguishes MdDS from land-sickness. Treatment of MdDS with common vestibular suppressants is nearly always ineffective. Benzodiazepines can be helpful, but their usefulness is limited by the potential for addiction. Studies are ongoing regarding treatment with visual habituation and transcranial magnetic stimulation.", 
    "7": "to summarize the previously published results of a multicenter randomized clinical research phase III study trial of afobazole (INN: fabomotizole) versus diazepam in the treatment of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and adjustment disorders (AD).", 
    "8": "Five investigating centers included 150 patients aged 18 to 60 years (60 patients with GAD and 90 with AD) a simple structure of anxiety disorders without concurrent mental, neurological or somatic disorders. Patients were randomized to take afobazole (30 mg/day; n=100) or diazepam (30 mg/day; n=50) for 30 days. Prior to drug administration, patients susceptible to placebo were excluded according to the results of its 7-day use. Withdrawal syndrome was evaluated within 10 days after completion of active therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change of Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) total score. The scores of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Scale and the Sheehan Scale as secondary efficacy endpoints \u00a0were analyzed. Drug safety was evaluated by assessment of adverse events.", 
    "9": "Afobazole and diazepam caused a significant reduction of HAMA total score. In the afobazole group, the reduction of anxiety \u00a0exceeded that in the diazepam group (the difference in the total score changes was 2.93 [0.67; 5.19]; p=0,01).The proportion of patients with reduction of disease severity was 72% in the afobazole group and 58% in the diazepam group. After therapy completion, the proportion of patients with no or mild disorder in the afobazole group was significantly higher than that in the diazepam group (69 and 44%, respectively; \u03c72=12.46; p=0,014). There was a trend toward a higher subjective patient-rated estimate of the afobazole effect using the Sheehan scale. There were a total of 15 and 199 adverse events in the afobazole and diazepam groups, respectively. No manifestations of afobazole withdrawal syndrome were found. Diazepam withdrawal syndrome was observed in 34 (68%) patients.",

As the variations of benzodiazepines concentrations in biological samples during bleeding, postmortem changes, and redistribution could be biasing forensic medicine examinations, hence selecting a suitable sample and a validated accurate method is essential for the quantitative analysis of these main drug categories. The aim of this study was to develop a valid method for the determination of four benzodiazepines (flurazepam, lorazepam, alprazolam, and diazepam) in vitreous humor using liquid-liquid extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography.", 
    "13": "Sample preparation was carried out using liquid-liquid extraction with n-hexane: ethyl acetate and subsequent detection by high-performance liquid chromatography method coupled to diode array detector. This method was applied to quantify benzodiazepines in 21 authentic vitreous humor samples.

    "14": "The limit of detection and quantitation were 30 and 100\u2009ng/mL respectively for four drugs. The method showed an appropriate intra- and inter-day precision (coefficient of variation\u2009<\u200910%). Benzodiazepines recoveries were estimated to be over 80%. The method showed high selectivity; no additional peak due to interfering substances in samples was observed.",

We noted no changes in new prescriptions. We observed the same patterns across patient age and physician specialties, except psychiatry. Despite no growth over time, the prevalence of visits involving continuing and new BZD and nBZRA prescriptions was much higher in psychiatry than in primary care and other specialties.", 
    "19": "Increased sedative-hypnotic prescribing in recent years may be attributable to long-term growth in continuing prescriptions, rather than new prescriptions. Public Health Implications. Findings call for renewed efforts to limit continuing prescribing of sedative-hypnotics to reduce their use in the population.", 
    "20": "Background: Alprazolam is a benzodiazepine used to treat anxiety, insomnia, depression, and panic disorders. When taken without medical supervision or in larger amounts than prescribed (e.g., nonmedical use (NMU)) of alprazolam can have serious health consequences. Even short-term use can lead to dependence, causing withdrawal symptoms such as tremors and seizures. In 2011, the estimated number of emergency department (ED) visits in the Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) involving nonmedical use of alprazolam accounted for 10 percent of all ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Method: National estimates of alprazolam-related ED visits involving NMU were analyzed using data from the 2005 to 2011 DAWN. We examined trends by age and gender, other drugs identified in these ED visits and the disposition of visits that resulted in admission to the hospital or transfer to another health care facility and those treated and released. Results: The estimated number of alprazolam-related ED visits involving NMU doubled from 57,419 visits in 2005 to 124,902 visits in 2010, but then remained stable in 2011 with 123,744 visits. The proportion of alprazolam-related ED visits involving NMU was approximately equal for males and females; there was a significant increase in the number of visits from 2005 to 2011 for both genders. Between 2005 and 2011, the estimated number of ED visits involving NMU of alprazolam among patients aged 25 to 34 increased threefold; visits in this age group accounted for 32% of visits in 2011. Among alprazolam-related ED visits involving NMU, 19% involved alprazolam only, 39% involved alprazolam in combination with another drug, 21% in combination with two drugs and 21% with three or more drugs. Conclusion: The age distribution of alprazolam-related ED visits involving NMU changed between 2005 and 2011. In 2005, patients aged 25 to 34 had a similar number of visits as other young and middle adult age groups (18 to 24 and 35 to 54). However, by 2011, the 25 to 34 age group had nearly twice the number of visits as other young and middle adult age groups. This suggests that adults aged 25 to 34 may have the greatest need for interventions addressing NMU of alprazolam.", 
    "21": "Background: Benzodiazepines are used to relieve symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, and seizures and are safe and effective when taken as prescribed and directed. However, benzodiazepines depress central nervous system (CNS) activity and, when combined with other drugs that depress CNS activity such as alcohol or opioid pain relievers, may present serious or even life-threatening problems. Concerns exist about the increasing number of patients prescribed both benzodiazepines and opioids and about serious complications arising from the use of benzodiazepines with alcohol. Methods: Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) data on drug-related emergency department (ED) visits from 2005 to 2011 were combined to ensure adequate sample size. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between ED visit outcome and benzodiazepine combinations with opioids and alcohol, patient age, gender, and the year in which the visit occurred. Results: During the 7 years from 2005 to 2011, almost a million (an estimated 943,032) ED visits involved benzodiazepines alone or in combination with opioid pain relievers or alcohol and no other substances. The predicted risk of a more serious outcome (hospitalization or, rarely, death in the ED rather than treatment and release), was greater than 20% for all age categories for benzodiazepines alone. Combinations of benzodiazepines with opioid pain relievers or alcohol were associated with a 24 to 55% increase in the predicted risk of a more serious outcome compared with benzodiazepines alone. Increasing age was associated with increasing predicted risk of a more serious outcome for visits involving benzodiazepines alone or in combination with opioid pain relievers or alcohol and no other substances. Conclusion: ED visits involving benzodiazepines alone pose a significant risk of hospitalization. Combining benzodiazepines with opioid pain relievers or alcohol significantly increases the risk of serious ED visit outcome for all age groups. Further, older patients experience increased risk of a serious outcome, even for visits involving benzodiazepines alone. Together, these facts suggest that individuals are at risk and that the baseline risks are high enough to suggest a public health concern.", 
    "22": "Generalized motor seizures, usually tonic-clonic, tonic-vibratory, myoclonic or clonic, and stimulus-sensitive/action myoclonus are typical features of progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs). Despite the introduction of many anticonvulsants, the treatment of these symptoms, particularly myoclonus, remains challenging, due to the incomplete and often transitory effects of most drugs. Moreover, treatment is only symptomatic, since therapy targeting the underlying aetiology for these genetic conditions is in its infancy. Traditional antiepileptic drugs for the treatment of PMEs are valproate, clonazepam, and phenobarbital (or primidone). These drugs may improve the overall performance of PME patients by decreasing their generalized seizures and, to a lesser extent, their myoclonic jerks. Newer drugs which have been shown to be effective include piracetam, levetiracetam, topiramate, zonisamide, and possibly perampanel for Lafora disease. The potential of other drugs (such as L-triptophan and N-acetylcysteine) and procedures (such as vagal and deep brain stimulation) has also been discussed. The available data on the efficacy of drugs are mainly based on small series or anecdotal reports. Two prospective, randomized, double blind studies investigating the novel SV2A ligand, brivaracetam, in genetically confirmed Unverricht-Lundborg patients have been performed with disappointing results. When treating PMEs, particular care should be paid to avoid drugs known to aggravate myoclonus or myoclonic seizures, such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, lamotrigine, vigabatrin, tiagabine, gabapentin, and pregabalin. The emergency treatment of motor status, which often complicates the course of PMEs, consists of intravenous administration of benzodiazepines, valproate, or levetiracetam.", 
    "23": "Herein, we tested in a model of generalized reflex epilepsy in mice different 1,4-benzodiazepines and 1,5-benzodiazepines with agonistic activity at the GABAA receptor population contributing to the peak component of the chloride current elicited by GABA in cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) in culture. The substances have all higher lipophilia than clobazam, an antiepileptic drug well known and used in human therapy. This ensures that they all can pass relatively easily the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The benzodiazepines were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) and tested for their activity against sound-induced tonic and clonic seizures in a genetic model of experimental epilepsy, the DBA/2 mouse. Our data demonstrates an interesting inverse correlation between the ED50s and the efficacy (E %) of the drugs in increasing the peak chloride current elicited by GABA in cerebellar granule cells in culture. There is indication of the existence of a threshold of E % above which the increase of ED50 with increasing E % becomes linear. This is statistically significant for the clonic phase, whereas it is at the limit of significance for the tonic one. A possible interpretation of these results is that in this epilepsy model, projections from the cerebellum exert a convulsion prevention activity.",

    "28": "The melastatin-like transient receptor potential 7 (TRPM7) has been implicated in proliferation or apoptosis of some cancers, indicating the potential of TRPM7 as an anti-anaplastic target. Here, we identified the characteristic TRPM7 channel currents in human malignant glioma MGR2 cells, which could be blocked by a pharmacologic inhibitor Gd(3+). We mined the clinical sample data from Oncomine Database and found that human malignant glioma tissues expressed higher TRPM7 mRNA than normal brain ones. Importantly, we identified a widely used clinical anesthetic midazolam as a TRPM7 inhibitor. Midazolam treatment for seconds suppressed the TRPM7 currents and calcium influx, and treatment for 48\u00a0h inhibited the TRPM7 expression. The inhibitory effect on TRPM7 accounts for the proliferation loss and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest induced by midazolam. Our data demonstrates that midazolam represses proliferation of human malignant glioma cells through inhibiting TRPM7 currents, which may be further potentiated by suppressing the expression of TRPM7. Our result indicates midazolam as a pharmacologic lead compound with brain-blood barrier permeability for targeting TRPM7 in the glioma.",

Oxycodone and morphine or fentanyl was the most frequently used per oral (PO) and intravenous (IV) opioid premedication, respectively. The most common IV premedication anxiolytic were benzodiazepines. Sixty-eight percentage always used a long-acting opioid.

    "75": "Background: Buprenorphine is a medication used to treat opioid addiction. A properly prescribed dose of buprenorphine can help opioid-addicted individuals to stop misusing opioids without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Although buprenorphine is itself an opioid, and can thus have the same effects as other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone), its maximum effects are less than those of other opioids. Therefore, with buprenorphine there is a decreased risk of abuse, addiction, and side effects compared with other opioids. Buprenorphine was approved for use in the United States for the treatment of opioid dependence in 2002. Methods: National estimates of Emergency Department (ED) visits involving buprenorphine were analyzed using data from the 2005 to 2011 Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN). The ED visits analyzed included nonmedical use, seeking detoxification/treatment services and adverse reactions involving buprenorphine. Results: ED visits involving buprenorphine increased substantially from an estimated 3,161 in 2005 to 30,135 visits in 2010 as availability of the drug increased. Buprenorphine-related ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals increased 255% from 2006 to 2010, with 4,440 visits to 15,778 visits, respectively. In 2010, 52% (15,778 visits) of buprenorphine-related ED visits were classified as nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals, 24% (7,372 visits) were by patients seeking detoxification or substance abuse treatment, and 13% (4,017 visits) were attributed to adverse reactions. In 2010, additional drugs were involved in 59% of buprenorphine-related ED visits involving nonmedical use of pharmaceuticals. Conclusion: Findings in this report show significant growth in the number of ED visits involving buprenorphine at the same time that there was an increase in its availability for treatment of opioid dependence. These data show that buprenorphine is sometimes used nonmedically, resulting in health events that require acute treatment in the ED. Buprenorphine use can be risky for individuals who are not opioid dependent because its effects are similar to other opioids (although usually more mild), leading to injuries and other health consequences. Additionally, dangerous effects can occur if buprenorphine is combined with certain other drugs, including benzodiazepines.",

The polymerization was optimized primarily by changing the ratio of porogen content. The optimized polymer monolith had a homogeneous and continuous column bed, good permeability and mechanical stability. Poly(NVC/DVB) had good affinity to BZPs because of its through-pore structure and strong \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions derived from the rich benzene functional groups in the polymer. Potential factors that affect the extraction efficiency were studied in detail. In the optimized method, 3mL of sample (pH 2) was extracted with the polymer monolithic column and eluted with 80\u03bcL of methanol, and the eluent was analysed with ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC/Q-Orbitrap MS). Under these conditions, the developed method gave the linear range of 0.005-0.5ng/mL for most of the six BZPs, whereas 0.05-0.5ng/mL for nitrazepam, 0.01-0.5ng/mL for lorazepam, respectively, with coefficients of determination (R(2))\u22650.9991.

Methods: This study analyzed 1\u2009813 suicide-related drug reports involving 553 patients collected from the Japanese National Adverse Drug Report Database between October 2001 and January 2012 to investigate psychotropic drugs associated with completed suicide vs. other suicide-related behaviors, including ideation and self-injury. The drugs investigated included antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepine hypnotic agents, noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and other drugs. Results: These reports referenced 300 (54.2%) individuals who completed suicide. Adjusting for age, sex, and drugs used, the multivariate model revealed that participants who took antipsychotics were 1.70 times (95% CI, 1.11-2.61) more likely to complete suicide compared with those who did not.

    "100": "Preclinical Research Insomnia is one of the most common sleep disorders that is characterized by difficulty in sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, and/or poor sleep quality. Treatment for insomnia includes both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Recently, the development of pharmacological treatment for insomnia has been prompted by the understanding of the molecular neurobiology of sleep-wake regulation. For pharmacological treatment, benzodiazepines that target GABAergic system are the most widely used hypnotics. Besides GABA, the hypocretin/orexin system, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are involved in sleep-wake regulation and may also play important role in the pathogenesis of insomnia. Genetic studies have revealed the critical role of several important genes related to the above-mentioned systems in the regulation and function of sleep, suggesting the genetic/epigenetic factors could also contribute to the development and regulation of insomnia. Non-pharmacological interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) that is an effective insomnia treatment with less risk and side effects of drug therapy. Here the current treatments for insomnia based on the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep-wake regulation, were reviewed and some newer targets that may be beneficial in the development of new treatments for insomnia were discussed.

Psychogenic pruritus, also referred to as functional itch disorder, is a distinct clinical entity. According to the definition proposed by the French Psychodermatology Group (FPDG) in 2007, the disorder is characterized by pruritus which is the chief complaint and psychologic factors that contribute to eliciting, worsening, and sustaining the symptoms. Specific diagnostic criteria were proposed, including 3 compulsory and 7 optional, of which 3 have to be met in order to establish the diagnosis. Psychogenic pruritus may require cooperation between dermatologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists. Psychotherapy and psychopharmacotherapy are mainstays of managing the disease. However, publications regarding psychogenic itch management are uncommon. Initially, general measures have to be taken, including avoiding irritating factors, preventing skin dryness, and frequent application of emollients. As in pruritus of other causes, several drugs are used, with more emphasis on substances that influence central nervous system: H1-antihistamines (hydroxyzine, chlorpheniramine, cyproheptadine, diphenhydramine, promethazine), tricyclic antidepressants (doxepin), tetracyclic antidepressants (mirtazapine), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline), antipsychotic drugs (pimozide), anticonvulsants (topiramate), and benzodiazepines (alprazolam), preferably depending on the coexisting symptoms.", 
    "133": "Nonmedical benzodiazepine use is common among adults with opioid use disorder; however, little is known about this co-occurrence. Anxiety sensitivity-the fear of anxiety symptoms and sensations-motivates behaviors to escape and avoid distressing states, and accordingly is associated with coping motives for substance use. This might be particularly relevant among women, who report using substances to cope with negative emotions more often than men. The aim of the current study was to examine whether nonmedical benzodiazepine use was associated with higher anxiety sensitivity among treatment-seeking adults diagnosed with opioid use disorder, and to investigate whether gender moderated this association. A sample of adults (ranging in age from 18 to 81years) receiving inpatient treatment for opioid use disorder (N=257) completed measures of anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, and benzodiazepine use frequency. Results of an analysis of variance indicated that frequency of past-month nonmedical benzodiazepine use was associated with significantly higher anxiety sensitivity. This effect remained when controlling for the effect of anxiety symptoms (F[1, 251]=3.91, p=0.049, \u03b7p(2)=0.02). Gender moderated this association, and post-hoc analyses found a strong association between nonmedical benzodiazepine use and anxiety sensitivity in women, and not men. Anxiety sensitivity, which can be reduced with treatment, might be a candidate therapeutic target in this population, particularly in women.",

However, hypnotic effect by oral supplementation and the molecular mechanism of \u03b1-pinene have not been determined yet. By combining in vivo sleep behavior, ex vivo electrophysiological recording from brain slices, and in silico molecular modeling, we demonstrate that (-)-\u03b1-pinene shows sleep enhancing property through a direct binding to GABAA-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors by acting as a partial modulator at the BZD binding site. The effect of (-)-\u03b1-pinene on sleep-wake profiles was evaluated by recording electroencephalogram and electromyogram. The molecular mechanism of (-)-\u03b1-pinene was investigated by electrophysiology and molecular docking study. (-)-\u03b1-pinene significantly increased the duration of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS) and reduced the sleep latency by oral administration without affecting duration of rapid eye movement sleep and delta activity. (-)-\u03b1-pinene potentiated the GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic response by increasing the decay time constant of sIPSCs in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. These effects of (-)-\u03b1-pinene on sleep and inhibitory synaptic response were mimicked by zolpidem, acting as a modulator for GABAA-BZD receptors, and fully antagonized by flumazenil, an antagonist for GABAA-BZD receptor. (-)-\u03b1-pinene was found to bind to aromatic residues of \u03b11- and -\u03b32 subunits of GABAA-BZD receptors in the molecular model. We conclude that (-)-\u03b1-pinene enhances the quantity of NREMS without affecting the intensity of NREMS by prolonging GABAergic synaptic transmission, acting as a partial modulator of GABAA-BZD receptors and directly binding to the BZD binding site of GABAA receptor.",

Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), a master regulator of hematopoiesis, plays critical roles in T cells; however, its roles in Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammation in macrophages are unclear. Here, we demonstrated that upon TLR4 ligand stimulation by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophages reduced the expression levels of RUNX1 Silencing of Runx1 attenuated the LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production levels, but the TNF-\u03b1 levels were not affected. Overexpression of RUNX1 promoted IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 production in response to LPS stimulation. Moreover, RUNX1 interacted with the NF-\u03baB subunit p50, and coexpression of RUNX1 with p50 further enhanced the NF-\u03baB luciferase activity. Importantly, treatment with the RUNX1 inhibitor, Ro 5-3335, protected mice from LPS-induced endotoxic shock and substantially reduced the IL-6 levels. These findings suggest that RUNX1 may be a new potential target for resolving TLR4-associated uncontrolled inflammation and preventing sepsis.",

According to recent guidelines, HE has been classified into different types, depending on the severity of hepatic dysfunction, the presence of porto-systemic shunts and the number of previous episodes or persistent manifestations. From a clinical point of view, HE can be recognized as unimpaired, covert (that deals with minimal and grade 1 according to the grading of mental state), and overt (that is categorized from grade 2 to grade 4).

We were interested whether this therapeutic benefit might extend to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients because GABAergic neurotransmission is implicated in postural control. Prior to initiating clinical studies in PD patients, we wished to better understand clarithromycin's mechanism of action. In this work we investigated whether the proposed activity of clarithromycin at the GABAA receptor is associated with the benzodiazepine binding site using in vivo [(11)C]flumazenil positron emission tomography (PET) in primates and ex vivo [(3)H]flumazenil autoradiography in rat brain. While the studies demonstrate that clarithromycin does not change the K d of FMZ, nor does it competitively displace FMZ, there is preliminary evidence from the primate PET imaging studies that clarithromycin delays dissociation and washout of flumazenil from the primate brain in a dose-dependent fashion. These findings would be consistent with the proposed GABAA allosteric modulator function of clarithromycin. While the results are only preliminary, further investigation of the interaction of clarithromycin with GABA receptors and/or GABAergic medications is warranted, and therapeutic applications of clarithromycin alone or in combination with flumazenil, to treat hyper-GABAergic status in PD at minimally effective doses, should also be pursued.",

Multiple pairwise comparisons were conducted using Welch t tests for continuous variables to determine whether dosing was different for the older groups vs the younger group; separate analyses were performed within and across ASA-PS class. This approach was also used to determine differences in mean arterial pressure change in the older groups vs the younger group, whereas the rates of hypotension among different age groups were compared by Cochran-Armitage trend test.",

For propofol, there was a significantly lower dosing for older patients: 17% for patients aged 65-79 and 29% for those aged >80, which was still in less than the recommendations. An inverse relationship was observed between propofol dosing and ASA-PS class, but no consistent relationship was noted for fentanyl and midazolam. There were a significantly larger drop in mean arterial pressure and a greater likelihood of hypotension following induction in patients aged 65-79 years and >80 years as compared with those aged <65 years.",

In chronic pain patients on opioids, the prevalence of SDB ranged from 71% to 100%; 17-80% had CSA and 20-39% had OSA. In MMPs, studies found a positive association between BMI, weight gain, duration of MMT, non-Caucasian race and the number of obstructive apneas, as well as blood methadone concentrations and the number of central apneas. In chronic pain patients on opioids, older age, higher BMI, male gender, and higher opioid doses predicted more obstructive apneas; older age, lower BMI, male gender, higher pain levels, higher benzodiazepine doses, and higher opioid doses predicted more central apneas.",

Drugs from four main classes of NPS were identified: psychostimulants, dissociative anaesthetics, hallucinogens (phenylalkylamine-based and lysergamide-based materials) and finally benzodiazepines. For inclusion in the review, the 'user reviewers' on drugs forums were selected based on whether or not the particular NPS of interest was used alone or in combination. NPS that were used alone were considered. Each of the classes contained drugs that are modelled on existing illegal materials and will be covered by the UK New Psychoactive Substances Bill in 2016.",

    "203": "The \u03b14\u03b22 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is the most abundant subtype in the brain and exists in two functional stoichiometries: (\u03b14)3(\u03b22)2 and (\u03b14)2(\u03b22)3. A distinct feature of the (\u03b14)3(\u03b22)2 receptor is the biphasic activation response to the endogenous agonist acetylcholine, where it is activated with high potency and low efficacy when two \u03b14-\u03b22 binding sites are occupied and with low potency/high efficacy when a third \u03b14-\u03b14 binding site is occupied. Further, exogenous ligands can bind to the third \u03b14-\u03b14 binding site and potentiate the activation of the receptor by ACh that is bound at the two \u03b14-\u03b22 sites. We propose that perturbations of the recently described pre-activation step when a third binding site is occupied are a key driver of these distinct activation properties. To investigate this, we used a combination of simple linear kinetic models and voltage clamp electrophysiology to determine whether transitions into the pre-activated state were increased when three binding sites were occupied. We separated the binding at the two different sites with ligands selective for the \u03b14-\u03b22 site (Sazetidine-A and TC-2559) and the \u03b14-\u03b14 site (NS9283) and identified that when a third binding site was occupied, changes in the concentration-response curves were best explained by an increase in transitions into a pre-activated state. We propose that perturbations of transitions into a pre-activated state are essential to explain the activation properties of the (\u03b14)3(\u03b22)2 receptor by acetylcholine and other ligands. Considering the widespread clinical use of benzodiazepines, this discovery of a conserved mechanism that benzodiazepines and ACh potentiate receptor activation via a third binding site can be exploited to develop therapeutics with similar properties at other cys-loop receptors.",

Therefore, drug stability is important for interpretation in both antemortem (blood and urine) and postmortem (blood, brain, liver, stomach contents) cases. In this study, 23 benzodiazepines (2-hydroxyethylflurazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam, \u03b1-hydroxytriazolam, alprazolam, bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, demoxepam, desalkylflurazepam, diazepam, estazolam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam, lorazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, phenazepam, temazepam and triazolam) and three sedative hypnotics (zaleplon, zopiclone and zolpidem) were spiked into the six matrices at two different concentrations for each drug. The samples were stored in either a refrigerator (4\u00b0C) or freezer (-20\u00b0C) and analyzed in triplicate at various time intervals over an 8-month period using an SWGTOX validated method. The concentrations decreased over time regardless of the initial spiked concentration, and the storage conditions had little effect on the decrease of most drugs. Conversion from drug to metabolite was difficult to determine since all 26 drugs were present in each sample. Zopiclone and phenazepam were the least stable drugs; zopiclone was the only drug that completely disappeared in any matrix (both antemortem and postmortem blood). Urine was the most stable matrix with only phenazepam, 7-aminoclonazepam, 7-aminoflunitrazepam, 2-hydroxyethylflurazepam, and zopiclone decreasing >20% over the 8 months in either storage condition. Postmortem blood, the least stable matrix, had only two drugs, zolpidem and bromazepam, decreasing <20% in the 8-month time period. Further experiments on stability of these drugs should be undertaken to remove the freeze-thaw cycle effect and more thoroughly examining drug-metabolite conversion.", 
    "205": "Urine drug testing (UDT) has become an essential component in the management of patients prescribed opioid analgesics for the treatment of chronic non-malignant pain. Several laboratory methods are available to monitor adherence with the pharmacological regimen and abstinence from illicit or unauthorized medications. Immunochemical screening methods are rapid and economical, but they have limitations, including lack of specificity, and confirmatory methods are often necessary to verify presumptive positive results. We analyzed the results of confirmatory assays in an outpatient setting to determine the predictive value of presumptive positive urine drug screen results using an automated immunoassay for eight common drugs or drug classes. Positive predictive values (PPVs), in descending order, were as follows: cannabinoids (100%), cocaine (100%), opiates (86.8%), benzodiazepines (74.6%), oxycodone (67.6%), methadone (44.1%) and amphetamines (9.3%). The number of positive barbiturate results was too small to be included in the statistical analysis.", 
    "206": "Combining opioids with benzodiazepines and skeletal muscle relaxants ('The Holy Trinity') has been reported to potentiate the 'high'. Through unique interactions with colocalized \u03bc-opioid and GABAA receptors, the combined use of these agents induces a synergistic increase in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) and depression of respiration. The inhibition of GABA release mediated by \u03bc1 -opioid receptor activation results in a subsequent increase in dopamine in the NAc. Benzodiazepines activate the GABAA R to suppress respiration in the medullary respiratory centres. The skeletal muscle relaxant, carisoprodol, appears to bind to a unique binding domain within the GABAA R to further enhance the respiratory depressant effects of the benzodiazepines. Therefore, the opioids, the benzodiazepines and carisoprodol alone or in combination are capable of inducing respiratory depression. Current guidelines for opioid prescribing recommend against the concomitant use of benzodiazepines but do not recognize the potential risk associated with the addition of skeletal muscle relaxants.", 
    "207": "The Na(+)/K(+)-ATPases maintain Na(+) and K(+) electrochemical gradients across the plasma membrane, a prerequisite for electrical excitability and secondary transport in neurons. Autosomal dominant mutations in the human ATP1A3 gene encoding the neuron-specific Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase \u03b13 isoform cause different neurological diseases, including rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (RDP) and alternating hemiplegia of childhood (AHC) with overlapping symptoms, including hemiplegia, dystonia, ataxia, hyperactivity, epileptic seizures, and cognitive deficits. Position D801 in the \u03b13 isoform is a mutational hotspot, with the D801N, D801E and D801V mutations causing AHC and the D801Y mutation causing RDP or mild AHC. Despite intensive research, mechanisms underlying these disorders remain largely unknown. To study the genotype-to-phenotype relationship, a heterozygous knock-in mouse harboring the D801Y mutation (\u03b13(+/D801Y)) was generated. The \u03b13(+/D801Y) mice displayed hyperactivity, increased sensitivity to chemically induced epileptic seizures and cognitive deficits. Interestingly, no change in the excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons in the \u03b13(+/D801Y) mice was observed. The cognitive deficits were rescued by administration of the benzodiazepine, clonazepam, a GABA positive allosteric modulator. Our findings reveal the functional significance of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase \u03b13 isoform in the control of spatial learning and memory and suggest a link to GABA transmission.", 
    "208": "Benzodiazepine (BZD) inappropriate use (i.e., misuse and overuse) is a worldwide public health problem. Despite current knowledge about increased sensitivity to side effects in the elderly, that should lead to more caution, only a third of BZD prescriptions in this age group are considered appropriate. The most frequent inadequate situations are excessive duration and/or dosage of a medical prescription or self-medication, especially in a context where it would be contraindicated, e.g., long-acting BZD in the elderly. Polypharmacy and comorbidities are major risk factors. Consequences of BZD inappropriate use are falls, delirium and other cognitive dysfunction, acute respiratory failure, car accidents, dependence, and withdrawal symptoms. An emerging concern is a potentially increased risk of dementia. Contrary to most clinicians' belief, discontinuation of chronic BZD use in elderly patients is feasible, with adequate psychotherapeutic or pharmacological strategies, and can lead to long-term abstinence. Brief cognitive therapy mostly relies on psychoeducation and motivational enhancement and is particularly useful in this context. Further research is needed, notably in three areas: (1) assessing the impact of public health programs to prevent BZD inappropriate use in the elderly, (2) developing alternative strategies to treat anxiety and insomnia in elderly patients, and (3) exploring the association between chronic BZD use and dementia.",

Future healthcare initiatives can utilize similar methodology to collect data prospectively via the electronic medical record to inform the development, delivery, and evaluation of interventions.", 
    "213": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia pose management challenges for caregivers and clinicians. Firstline nonpharmacologic treatments include eliminating physical and emotional stressors, modifying the patient's environment, and establishing daily routines. Family members and caregivers benefit from education about dementia symptoms and reminders that the behaviors are normal and unintentional. Cognitive and emotion-oriented interventions, sensory stimulation interventions, behavior management techniques, and other psychosocial interventions are modestly effective. In refractory cases, physicians may choose to prescribe off-label antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has the most consistent evidence of symptom improvement; however, this improvement is small. Olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone have inconsistent evidence of benefit. Physicians should use the smallest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize adverse effects, most notably an increased mortality risk. Other adverse effects include anticholinergic and antidopaminergic effects, extrapyramidal symptoms, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, postural hypotension, metabolic syndrome, cardiac arrhythmia, and sedation. Patients should be monitored for these effects while receiving treatment; however, laboratory monitoring may be limited to patients receiving long-term therapy.",

This 61-year-old female patient was brought to the emergency department with lethargy and within hours had declined into a state of catatonia. Although there was never a complaint of chest pain, ECG showed deep anterior T-wave inversions and cardiac enzymes were elevated. An echocardiogram was consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She later received 1\u2009mg of midazolam and within minutes had resolution of catatonic symptoms. Careful history revealed that she had omitted her daily dose of lorazepam for 3 days prior to admission. To our knowledge, the case presented herein is the first report of simultaneous catatonia and takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of benzodiazepine withdrawal. The pathogenesis of both conditions is poorly understood but may be indirectly related to the sudden decrease in \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling during benzodiazepine withdrawal.",

In this study we sought to determine whether those who were first exposed to an opioid through a physician's prescription, and subsequently developed a substance use disorder, had a history of using psychoactive drugs prior to abusing opioids. Patients entering one of 125 drug treatment programs across the country for opioid abuse were asked to provide detailed histories of psychoactive drug use prior to their initial opioid exposure. Nearly half (47.1%, N=4493) indicated they were first exposed to opioids through a prescription from their physician to treat pain. Of these, 94.6% indicated experience with at least one other psychoactive substance (mean=4.55\u00b10.05) prior to, or coincident with, their first exposure to an opioid from a physician. Alcohol (92.9%), nicotine and/or tobacco (89.5%), and marijuana (87.4%) were used by nearly all patients prior to, or coincident with, their first opioid prescription. If one excludes these drugs, 70.1% (N=2913) still reported some psychoactive drug use of licit or illicit stimulants (77.8%), benzodiazepines (59.8%) or hallucinogens (55.2%). Our results indicate that pain patients who developed a substance use disorder were rarely drug na\u00efve prior to receiving their first opioid prescription. Rather, most have an extensive history of psychoactive drug use. As such, physicians should routinely ascertain complete licit and illicit drug histories in patients for whom they prescribe opioids.",

While surgery, benzodiazepines, and anti-cholinergic drugs may accelerate decline or even raise the risk of dementia, other medications act directly on the brain to potentially slow the pathology that underlies Alzheimer's and other dementia. In other words, the functional and cognitive decline in vulnerable patients may be influenced by the choice of treatments for other medical conditions.

    "234": "Both hypoactivity and hyperactivity in the amygdala are associated with perturbations in social behavior. While >60 years of experimental manipulations of the amygdala in animal models have shown that amygdala is critical for social behavior, many of these studies contradict one another. Moreover, several questions remain unaddressed. (1) What effect does activation of amygdala have on social behavior? (2) What is the effect of transient silencing, rather than permanent damage? (3) Is there a dissociation between the roles of the central (CeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in regulating social behavior? (4) Can the prosocial effects of amygdala manipulations be explained by anxiolytic effects? We focally manipulated activity within the CeA or BLA in macaques by intracerebral microinjection of muscimol (to inactivate) or bicuculline (to activate) to these amygdaloid subregions. Social interactions were observed in pairs of highly familiar monkeys. We compared these effects to those achieved with systemic diazepam. Activation of the BLA but not CeA suppressed social behavior. Inhibition of either structure increased social behavior, although the effect was greater following inhibition of the BLA. Systemic diazepam was without effect. These studies, which are the first to bidirectionally manipulate the primate amygdala for effects on social behavior, revealed that (1) the amygdala, as a critical regulator of the social network, is bidirectionally sensitive to perturbations in activity, and (2) increased sociability after amygdala inactivation cannot be solely explained by decreased fear.", 
    "235": "Many previous studies reported loss of social interactions following permanent damage to the amygdala in nonhuman primates. In contrast, we report that transient inhibition of the basolateral amygdala triggered a profound increase in social interactions in dyads of monkeys highly familiar with each other. We compared these effects to those of systemic diazepam, which failed to increase social behavior. While it has been suggested that suppression of \"fear\" could underlie the prosocial effects of amygdala manipulations, our data strongly suggest that impairment in fear processing per se cannot account for the prosocial effects of amygdala inhibition. Furthermore, our studies are the first to examine activation of the amygdala and to assess the separate roles of the amygdaloid nuclei in social behavior in primates.", 
    "236": "The elevated T-maze was developed to test the hypothesis that serotonin plays an opposing role in the regulation of defensive behaviors associated with anxiety and panic. Previous pharmacological exploitation of this test supports the association between inhibitory avoidance acquisition and escape expression with anxiety and fear/panic, respectively. In the present study, we extend the pharmacological validation of this test by investigating the effects of other putative or clinically effective anxiety- and panic-modulating drugs. The results showed that chronic, but not acute injection of the reversible monoamine oxidase-A inhibitor moclobemide (3, 10 and 30mg/kg) inhibited escape expression, indicating a panicolytic-like effect. The same effect was observed after either acute or chronic treatment with alprazolam (1, 2 and 4mg/kg), a high potency benzodiazepine. This drug also impaired inhibitory avoidance acquisition, suggesting an anxiolytic effect. On the other hand, subcutaneous administration of the 5-HT1D/1B receptor agonist sumatriptan (0.1, 0.5 and 2.5\u03bcg/kg) facilitated escape performance, indicating a panicogenic-like effect, while treatment with \u03b1-para-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA; 4days i.p injections of 100mg/kg, or a single i.p injection of 300mg/kg), which caused marked 5-HT depletion in the amygdala and striatum, was without effect. Altogether, these results are in full agreement with the clinical effects of these compounds and offer further evidence that the elevated T-maze has broad predictive validity for the effects of anxiety- and panic-modulating drugs.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted on November 1, 2014, including all inpatients and outpatients at the Mental Health Centre for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Capital Region of Denmark, aged 0 to 17 years receiving medical treatment with antidepressants, antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, melatonin and/or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medication. We included a total of 5555 prescriptions representing 2932 patients. The main findings were that 32.3% of all prescriptions were off-label, and 41.6% of subjects received at least 1 off-label prescription. The most frequent off-label category was low age, 72.2%, meaning that the drug was not approved for the age group of the patient. The off-label rates for each drug class were as follows: melatonin, 100%; antipsychotic agents, 95.6%; benzodiazepines, 72.5%; antidepressants, 51.1%; and ADHD medication, 2.7%. Prescription of 2 or more psychopharmacological drugs per patient was common (31.5%). The group of subjects with 4 or more prescriptions (n = 36) was characterized by a higher frequency of inpatients, older age, and a different distribution of diagnoses. This study found a frequent use of off-label prescriptions when treating children and adolescents with psychopharmacological drugs other than ADHD medication. In addition, prescription of more than 1 psychotropic drug is common. These findings support the need for extending the evidence base for psychopharmacologic treatment in children and adolescents.", 
    "238": "Catatonia is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome. There is a life-threatening subtype of this disease known as malignant catatonia. One of the hypotheses regarding the pathogenesis is an imbalance of multiple neurotransmitters (gaba, glutamate and dopamine). The first step in treatment is to administer benzodiazepines; if the response is insufficient, the treatment can be replaced by electroconvulsive therapy (ect). So far, there is no consensus with regard to the tertiary treatment step. On the basis of a case report we describe the beneficial effects of administering an nmda receptor antagonist, amantadine, as the tertiary step for treating a patient with treatment-resistant malignant catatonia.", 
    "239": "There are currently no disease-modifying treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and no approved pharmacological or therapeutic treatments that are effective in controlling their symptoms. The use of most pharmacological treatment options are based on experience in other disorders or from non-randomized historical controls, case series, or expert opinion. Levodopa may provide some improvement in symptoms of Parkinsonism (specifically bradykinesia and rigidity) in PSP and CBD; however, evidence is conflicting and where present, benefits are often negligible and short lived. In fact, \"poor\" response to levodopa forms part of the NINDS-SPSP criteria for the diagnosis of PSP and consensus criteria for the diagnosis of CBD (Lang Mov Disord. 20 Suppl 1:S83-91, 2005; Litvan et al. Neurology. 48:119-25, 1997; Armstrong et al. Neurology. 80(5):496-503, 2013). There is some evidence that intrasalivery gland botulinum toxin is useful in managing problematic sialorrhea and that intramuscular botulinum toxin and baclofen are helpful in reducing dystonia, including blepharospasm. Benzodiazepines may also be useful in managing dystonia. Myoclonus may be managed using levetiracetam and benzodiazepines. Pharmacological agents licensed for Alzheimer's disease (such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists) have been used off-label in PSP, CBD, and other tauopathies with the aim of improving cognition; however, there is limited evidence that they are effective and risk of adverse effects may outweigh benefits. The use of atypical antipsychotics for behavioural symptoms is not recommended in the elderly or those with demetia associated conditions and most antipsychotics will worsen Parkinsonism. Antidepressants may be useful for behavioral symptoms and depression but are often poorly tolerated due to adverse effects. In the absence of an effective drug treatment to target the underlying cause of CBD and PSP, management should focus on optimizing quality of life, relieving symptoms and assisting patients with their activities of daily living (ADL). Patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team consisting of neurologists, physiotherapists (PT), occupational therapists (OT), speech and language therapists (SALT), dieticians, ophthalmologists, psychologists, and palliative care specialists.",

    "241": "Retrospective cohort study including all infants <1500\u2009g birth weight and <32 weeks gestational age (GA) mechanically ventilated at 348 Pediatrix Medical Group neonatal intensive care units from 1997 to 2012. The primary outcome is the proportion of mechanically ventilated days in which infants were administered drugs of interest. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictors of administration of drugs of interest.", 
    "242": "We identified 85\u2009911 mechanically ventilated infants. Infants received a drug of interest (opioids, benzodiazepines, other sedatives, and paralytics) on 433\u2009587/1\u2009305\u2009413 (33%) of mechanically ventilated infant days. The administration of opioids increased during the study period from 5% of infant days in 1997 to 32% in 2012. The administration of benzodiazepines increased during the study period from 5% of infant days in 1997 to 24% in 2012. Use of paralytics and other drugs remained \u22641% throughout the study period. Predictors of drug administration included younger GA, small for GA status, male sex, presence of a major congenital anomaly, older postnatal age at intubation, exposure to high-frequency ventilation, exposure to inotropes, more recent year of discharge, and neonatal intensive care unit site.", 
    "243": "Administration of opioids and benzodiazepines in mechanically ventilated premature infants increased over time. Because infant characteristics were unchanged, site-specific differences in practice likely explain our observations. Increased administration over time is concerning given limited evidence of benefit and potential for harm."
