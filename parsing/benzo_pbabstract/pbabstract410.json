Zn2+ inhibited [3H]TBOB binding in a dose-dependent manner at physiological concentrations. Saturation analysis revealed noncompetitive inhibition in various brain regions. The inhibitory effect of Zn2+ had regional heterogeneity; regions showing the greatest inhibition of [3H]TBOB binding were cortical laminae I-III, most areas of hippocampus, striatum, septum, and cerebellar cortex. Regions with relatively less inhibition of [3H]TBOB binding included cortical laminae V-VI, thalamus, superior colliculus, inferior colliculus, and central gray matter. The effect of Zn2+ and those of other GABAA ligands, such as benzodiazepines, bicuculline, isoguvacine, and picrotoxin, on [3H]TBOB binding seemed to be additive. Ni2+, Cd2+, and Cu2+ also inhibited [3H]TBOB binding with a regional heterogeneity similar to that produced by Zn2+. These results are consistent with Zn2+ acting at the previously detected recognition site on the GABAA receptor complex, distinct from the picrotoxin, GABA, and benzodiazepine sites. The regional heterogeneity of the Zn2+ effect may reflect differential regional distribution of GABAA receptor subtypes among brain regions. Other divalent cations probably act at the Zn2+ binding site.", 
    "1": "Twenty-one patients with significant long-term therapeutic benzodiazepine (BZ) use, who remained abstinent at 6 months follow-up after successfully completing a standardized inpatient BZ withdrawal regime, and 21 normal controls matched for age and IQ but not for anxiety, were repeatedly tested on a simple battery of routine psychometric tests of cognitive function, pre- and post-withdrawal and at 6 months follow-up. The results demonstrated significant impairment in patients in verbal learning and memory, psychomotor, visuo-motor and visuo-conceptual abilities, compared with controls, at all three time points. Despite practice effects, no evidence of immediate recovery of cognitive function following BZ withdrawal was found. Modest recovery of certain deficits emerged at 6 months follow-up in the BZ group, but this remained significantly below the equivalent control performance. The implications of persisting cognitive deficits after withdrawal from long-term BZ use are discussed.", 
    "2": "Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) is useful method for compensate of respiratory function in anesthetized horses. However, IPPV may decrease cardiac output. Alterations in cardiac output of three groups (N = 5) healthy, halothane-anesthetized mares were determined and compared during a 120 min period of anesthesia. The groups were as follows: spontaneous ventilation (SV), controlled ventilation using an end-inspiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O (CV20) and a third group using 25 cmH2O (CV25) inspiratory pressure. In the CV groups, respiratory function was adequately maintained. Although, cardiac output tended to decrease over time in each group. After 105 min of anesthesia in the CV groups, the cardiac outputs decreased below 50 percent of pre-anesthetic values. In the CV25 group, cardiac outputs were significant difference (p < 0.05) from the SV group after 45, 90 and 120 min of anesthesia. There was no significant difference in cardiac output between SV and CV20 group over time. These values suggest that when long durations of anesthesia was used with the IPPV, decrease of cardiac output should be improved. In clinical use of halothane anesthesia, an end-respiratory pressure of 20 cmH2O seems to be appropriate because the mild decrease in cardiac output was observed even though a little high PaCO2.", 
    "3": "For PET studies of benzodiazepine receptors, N-11C-methyl-2'-iododiazepam (2'-IDZ) was synthesized by N-methylation of its desmethyl derivative with 11C-methyl iodide, and was subsequently purified by HPLC. The labeling and purification procedures were completed within 45 min after 11C-methyl iodide trapping, and the radiochemical yield (corrected for decay) was approximately 40% based on the initial trapped radioactivity of 11C-methyl iodide. Biodistribution studies in mice demonstrated that 11C-2'-IDZ was rapidly and noticeably accumulated in the brain, and subsequently decreased with time. Accumulation was greater in the cortex than in other brain regions. When compared with 125I-2'-IDZ, the distribution was almost the same until 5 min after injection, but levels were low after 20 min. Metabolic studies indicated that the difference between these two compounds in the time course of brain radioactivity distribution may be due to N-demethylation in vivo.", 
    "4": "We conducted a retrospective chart review of older (n = 48; mean age = 69) and younger (n = 36; mean age = 30) patients who were admitted to residential/inpatient treatment for alcohol withdrawal and dependence. Although the two age groups did not differ in terms of recent drinking history, the elderly group had significantly more withdrawal symptoms for a longer duration than the younger group. The elderly group also had more symptoms of cognitive impairment, daytime sleepiness, weakness, and high blood pressure. Finally, no significant differences were found between age groups in either the dosage or number of days of detoxification medication, although a trend was found for more days of medication in the elderly. We conclude that alcohol withdrawal may be more severe in elderly than in younger persons. Accordingly, treatment may take longer and should target the specific profile of symptoms that characterize alcohol withdrawal in the elderly.", 
    "5": "A competitive (NBQX) and a non-competitive (GYKI 52466) AMPA antagonist, and a competitive NMDA antagonist (D-CPPene) were tested against the development of kindling and against fully kindled seizures in amygdala-kindled rats. GYKI 52466, 10 mg/kg given i.p. 5 min prior to electrical stimulation in fully kindled animals, reduces both the cortical after-discharge duration and the behavioural seizure score. GYKI 52466, 20 mg/kg, reduces seizure score and after-discharge duration significantly (after 5-30 min) but the animals show severe motor side effects and an irregular cortical and hippocampal EEG. Administration of GYKI 52466, 10 mg/kg, prior to kindling stimulation on days 3-8, does not slow the development of kindling. NBQX, 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg i.p., 30 min prior to stimulation, significantly reduces the seizure score in fully kindled animals. NBQX 20 mg/kg i.p. has no effect on the development of kindling. D-CPPene, 8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg, 120 min prior to stimulation reduces the behavioural seizure score in fully kindled animals. D-CPPene, 8 mg/kg on days 3-8, delays the development of kindling. NMDA receptors play a key role in the kindling process. Expression of kindled seizures involves non-NMDA and NMDA receptors.", 
    "6": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either naloxone (75 micrograms/h) or saline (0.5 microliter/h) s.c. for 14 days delivered with osmotic minipumps. Two days after termination of either treatment, daily amygdala kindling stimulation was applied until the animals experienced stage V kindled seizures. Benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding sites were labeled with [3H]flunitrazepam (2 nM), and changes in specific brain areas were determined by in vitro quantitative autoradiography. Twenty-four hours after the last electrical stimulation, the saline pretreated fully kindled rats showed enhanced BDZ receptor binding in dentate gyrus, and decreased binding in cingulate cortex ipsilateral to the stimulation compared to saline controls. Twenty-eight days after the last stage V kindled seizure, the significant alterations were no longer evident. In agreement with a previous study, we found that naloxone pretreated amygdala kindled rats showed stage V kindled seizures followed by intervals of 3-5 days in which the same electrical stimulation failed to induce any behavioral and EEG alterations. In comparison with the saline pretreated kindled and saline control groups, the naloxone pretreated kindled rats had significantly higher BDZ binding in different cortical areas, amygdala complex, hippocampus, substantia nigra and periaqueductal gray, 24 h after the last electrical stimulation. The present study indicates that previous chronic exposure to naloxone increases BDZ receptor binding in kindled rats, and suggests that this effect may be associated with the enhanced seizure suppression observed in these animals.", 
    "7": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) has been shown to be a neuropeptide with potent anti-opioid activity. Previous studies have shown that central administration of nanogram dose of CCK-8 totally abolished morphine analgesia in the rat, an effect mediated by CCK-B receptor in central nervous system. In the present study CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 was injected intracerebroventricularly (icv) to Wistar rats to see its effect on the analgesic effect induced by electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation. A marked potentiation of EA-induced analgesia was observed. The degree of potentiation depends on the frequency of EA used, with a rank order of 100 Hz > 15 Hz = 2/15 Hz > > 2 Hz. In a strain of rat with acoustically evoked epileptic seizure (P77PMC rats), an extra-ordinarily strong analgesic effect was produced in response to 100 Hz EA stimulation, which was similar to that in Wistar rats pre-treated with L-365,260. However, L-365,260 was not effective in potentiating EA analgesia in P77PMC rats. The results suggest that (1) high frequency EA is more likely to increase the release of CCK-8 in CNS as compared to low frequency EA, and (2) P77PMC rats may have a functional defect of the central CCK neurons in the nature of either a low CCK content or a reduced rate of release of CCK-8 in the CNS.", 
    "8": "The effect of an ascending dose regimen on the development of tolerance to diazepam's anticonvulsant effect was assessed. During the 22 trials of the tolerance development phase, amygdala-kindled rats received either a series of dosage injections ranging from high (10 mg/kg), to low (1.0 mg/kg), and ascending (1.0 mg/kg and increased by 0.2-mg/kg increments to 3.0 mg/kg) or saline injections. Diazepam was administered by ip injection once every 48 hr, and each injection was followed 1 hr later by a convulsive stimulation. The ascending dose rats displayed significantly more tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam than did the high dose, low dose, or saline rats. By contrast, both the ascending and high dose rats displayed a significant withdrawal effect (i.e., increased duration of convulsions) after the cessation of diazepam injections. Results demonstrate that administration of ascending dosages can facilitate the development of tolerance to anticonvulsant drug effects and that tolerance and withdrawal are not necessarily inextricably related.", 
    "9": "Three experiments examined the antinociceptive response shown by rats during exposure to loud noise. Noise exposure resulted in a time-dependent elevation of radiant heat tail flick latency that varied as a function of stimulus intensity. Noise stress hypoalgesia in response to a 90-dB stimulus was blocked by pretreatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone (0.1-7.0 mg/kg). Systemic administration of midazolam (2 mg/kg) prior to exposure to the stressor attenuated the elevation in tail flick latency. Because topographically similar antinociceptive responses may be elicited with a low intensity noise stimulus that has served as a Pavlovian conditional stimulus for shock, the use of this paradigm may permit direct comparisons of associative and nonassociative fear responses using qualitatively similar auditory stimuli.", 
    "10": "Systemic administration of benzodiazepines before exposure to inescapable shock (IS) blocks the enhanced fear conditioning and escape learning deficits that follow exposure to IS, whereas administration before the subsequent behavioral testing eliminates the enhanced fear but not the interference with escape. The failure of benzodiazepines to reduce the IS-produced escape learning deficit when given before testing is inconsistent with a recent proposal that interference with escape is mediated by an IS-induced sensitization of dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) activity. The present experiments demonstrate that chlordiazepoxide will block both the enhancement of fear and interference with escape responding when given before either IS or testing if microinjected in the region of the DRN. This suggests that systemic benzodiazepines fail to block escape deficits when given before testing because action at a site distant from the DRN counters the effect of the drug at the DRN.", 
    "11": "Parents of 40 patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease completed a questionnaire detailing developmental history, life course, management, medication, factors influencing variability and topography of self-injury. Several conclusions were reached. Characteristics: Biting was the predominant form, perhaps only because of the difficulty of preventing it. There was considerable variability in self-injury which was strongly related to stress rather than to operant influences. Even though patients could not inhibit self-injury they could predict it and request restraints. Aggression against others was as prevalent as self-injury.", 
    "12": "Stress reduction, teeth extraction, and physical restraint were the most commonly used management techniques. Behavior modification was of limited efficacy. Benzodiazepines were the most commonly used medications for controlling self-injury.", 
    "13": "The severity of self-injury did not change over years. Age of onset was a predictor of outcome. The earlier the age of onset the worse the self-injury eventually became. The discussion describes research strategies, suggests dimensions along which self-injury can be classified, and highlights behavior not commonly described in patients with Lesch-Nyhan disease.", 
    "14": "Traditionally, general or regional anesthesia has been employed during endourologic procedures. The success of sedative-analgesic sedation during SWL prompted an investigation into its use in minor endourologic procedures. We compared intravenous alfentanil-midazolam anesthesia (n = 30) with spinal anesthesia (n = 35) during procedures such as ureteroscopy and stent placement using physiologic measures and patient and anesthetist ratings. The former series was prospective; the latter was retrospective. Physiologic measures remained stable and oxygen saturation was above 90% in all patients in both groups during the procedures. The average anesthesia and recovery room times were significantly shorter for patients given alfentanilmidazolam: 23.3 v 36.1 minutes and 85.5 v 179.6 minutes, respectively (P < 0.001; t-test), and this difference reduced the anesthesia cost an average of 46%. The anesthetists rated the intravenous regimen satisfactory in 92% of the patients, and 94% of the patients rated the procedure as comfortable. All 18 of the patients who had previously had spinal anesthesia considered alfentanil-midazolam superior. Intravenous alfentanil-midazolam sedation anesthesia can provide adequate analgesia for many minor endourologic procedures while shortening the anesthesia recovery time.", 
    "15": "Twenty four hours after mice were forced to swim for up to 10 minutes in cold water, there was a reduction in the ability of MK-801 to antagonize the electrical precipitation of tonic hindlimb extension. Milacemide, a lipophilic prodrug of glycine, restored the antiseizure efficacy of MK-801 to the same level observed in unstressed animals treated with milacemide and MK-801. Stimulation of the glycine-gated chloride ionophore subsequent to the liberation of free glycine could explain milacemide's pharmacologic action as an adjuvant to MK-801. Consistent with this interpretation, milacemide was able to potentiate the antiseizure effects of flurazepam, a benzodiazepine agonist, in stressed and unstressed mice and carbamazepine in unstressed animals. D-cycloserine, a partial glycine agonist with greater specificity for the strychnine-insensitive modulatory site on the NMDA receptor complex, was examined for its effect on MK-801's antiseizure efficacy. At a high dose (320 mg/kg), D-cycloserine alone had an anticonvulsant effect. Moreover, this dose of D-cycloserine administered with MK-801 showed a significantly greater anticonvulsant efficacy than MK-801 alone. The data support the development of glycinergic interventions as adjunctive agents in the pharmacotherapy of seizure disorders.", 
    "16": "Eight anticonvulsant drugs-including clonazepam, diazepam and phenobarbital-were tested for their effects on GABA-stimulated chloride uptake in rat cerebral cortical microsacs (unfiltered synaptoneurosomes). \"Mid\" and \"high\" therapeutic concentrations were screened, and, if significant enhancement was found, full concentration-response tests were done. In the initial screens, enhancement of GABA-stimulated uptake was found only with phenobarbital, clonazepam and diazepam. In subsequent concentration-response tests, the effects of phenobarbital were found to occur throughout the range of normal, anticonvulsant concentrations, whereas the effects of clonazepam and diazepam were observed only above the concentrations normally used for the chronic control of seizures or anxiety. These data suggest that phenobarbital's anticonvulsant effects are mediated via the GABAA receptor complex, but that the low-dose effects of the benzodiazepines may be mediated via some other mechanism.", 
    "17": "A sample of 222 methadone maintenance clients was tested for levels of depression, anxiety, and anti-social personality disorder. The prevalence of each type of psychopathology was high. There were large proportions of subjects exhibiting extremely severe depression, anxiety and a majority were classified as \"psychiatric cases\". Depression and anxiety were strongly related, but anti-social behaviour was unrelated to personal distress. Personal distress levels were predicted by benzodiazepine use, poorer social functioning and poorer health. Anti-social personality disorder was predicted by younger age, being male, poorer social functioning, and current criminality.", 
    "18": "This review is an update on anesthetic agents and their excretion into breast milk; it presents the reported effects on suckling infants, and discusses the precautions which should be considered. For most anaesthetic agents, there is very sparse information about breast milk excretion and even less published knowledge about the possible effects on the suckling infant. Generally, when an anaesthetic agent is given on a single-dose basis, there is no evidence that it is excreted in breast milk in clinically significant amounts, even if there are detectable concentrations of the drug in the milk. Most anaesthetics are rapidly cleared from the mother, and, consequently, it should be possible to allow suckling as soon as practically feasible after surgery. However, repeated administration of certain opiates and benzodiazepines has been reported to cause adverse effects in neonates, with premature neonates apparently being more susceptible. Thus, in long-term treatment with these drugs, the importance of uninterrupted breast feeding should be assessed against possible adverse drug effects in the neonate.", 
    "19": "During induction of anesthesia in 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), we measured the QT-interval (QTI) in the ECG, heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Based on the HR, we corrected the QT-interval (QTcI). Prior to induction, six patients (10%) already had abnormal prolongation of QTcI (> or = 440 ms). After injection of fentanyl and vecuronium, the QTcI increased significantly (P < 0.01); to a far lesser extent after injection of hypnotics (i.e. etomidate, midazolam or propofol). Orotracheal intubation caused significant shortening of QTcI (P < 0.01). HR decreased markedly after injection of fentanyl. MAP decreased, however, only after injection of hypnotics. In the immediate post intubation period, HR and MAP increased significantly. The various hypnotics produced no significant difference in HR and QTcI at any measurement point. MAP changed only after injection of hypnotics. The decrease of HR and MAP during induction of anesthesia is thought to result from a corresponding reduction of adrenosympathetic stimulation. We believe that QTcI is similarly influenced.", 
    "20": "The effects of cholecystokinin (CCK)-A, CCK-B, and 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor antagonists on the postprandial myoelectric activity of the ileum and the proximal and distal colon in rats were studied. After L364,718, a CCK-A receptor antagonist, or ritanserin, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, the duration of the ileal postprandial motor pattern was reduced by 60%. In contrast, L365,260, a CCK-B receptor antagonist, had no effect. In the distal colon, the postprandial response was inhibited by CCK-A, CCK-B, and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, whereas they were inactive in the proximal colon. CCK-8 administered at the end of the meal suppressed the inhibitory effect of ritanserin on the ileum and the distal colon. These results suggest that, in rats, CCK-8 is involved in the control of the ileal motor response to feeding through CCK-A receptors and in that of the distal colon through both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors. Serotonin seems to play a role in CCK-8 control through 5-HT2 receptors.", 
    "21": "We investigated the discrete regional effects of bilateral olfactory bulbectomy on central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors in rat brains at weekly intervals until one month after bulb ablation. Persistent increases in [3H]flunitrazepam binding to central benzodiazepine receptors were observed in the cingulum (27%) and in the frontal (15%) and parietal (14%) cortices. Progressive increases in central benzodiazepine receptors, reaching statistical significance four weeks after olfactory bulbectomy, were observed in the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (35%), the lateral hypothalamic region (22%), the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus (23%) and substantia nigra (25%). Persistent major increases (between four- and six-fold) in [3H]PK-11195 [eH]1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide binding to peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors were observed in all anterior olfactory nuclei. Similarly, throughout the time period studied, [3H]PK-11195 binding densities were increased two- to three-fold in the piriform cortex and lateral olfactory tract. These observations confirm the usefulness of [3H]PK-11195 binding as a marker of neuronal insult in the brain. Moreover, the persistent regional increases in [3H]flunitrazepam binding to central-type benzodiazepine receptors suggest that GABAergic transmission is altered following olfactory bulb ablation.", 
    "22": "Twenty two patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome were examined by nocturnal polysomnography (n-PSG), and the obstructive sites in the upper airway were observed by nasendoscopic diurnal polysomnography using diazepam (n-d-PSGD). The types of apnea were divided into three groups according to the obstructive sites in the upper airway: soft palate apnea, tongue base apnea, and combined type apnea. Among the 22 patients, there were 17 soft palate apneas, 3 tongue base apneas and 2 combined type apneas. All patients underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). Preoperative values of AI, AR, DI and mean sleep SaO2 were 37.2, 24.5%, 31.4 and 92.5%, and the postoperative values were 10.4, 7.3%, 6.8 and 94.8%, respectively. Criteria were established to define UPPP responders, as follows: 50% or more reduction in AI and postoperative AI less than 20. The overall improvement rate was 81.0%. The improvement rates for soft palate apnea, combined type apnea and tongue base apnea were 93.8%, 50.0%, and 0%, respectively. In 15 of the 22 patients, measurements of mesopharyngeal and esophageal pressures were performed simultaneously with n-d-PSGD. In these 15 patients, 12 soft palate apneas, 2 combined type apneas and 3 tongue base apneas were observed with n-d-PSGD, while 7 soft palate apneas, 3 combined type apneas and 5 tongue base apneas were detected by measuring the pressures. The results of these two methods concurred in only nine of fifteen patients. It was suspected that the obstructive sites in the upper airway were identified by tissues with n-d-PSGD, but by region with the pressure measuring method. It was suggested that UPPP is the most suitable treatment for patients with soft palate type apnea, without pathologic obesity.",

    "24": "The distribution of octadecaneuropeptide (ODN)-like immunoreactivity (LI) and its relationship to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-LI were investigated in the cerebellar cortex of adult rats with electron microscopy. At the electron microscopic level, ODN-LI was found exclusively in glial cells. In addition to Bergmann glia and its processes, cerebellar astrocytes were also labelled, encapsulating unlabelled neuronal elements of the cerebellum. These ODN-LI glial processes were observed in close apposition to synaptic junctions, but immunoreactivity could not be found in the synaptic cleft or in association with neuronal membranes. Since GABA-LI is always associated with neuronal elements, the colocalization of GABA- and ODN-LI could not be confirmed in the cerebellar cortex. Our results do not support the assumption that ODN is a neuron-specific processing product of diazepam binding inhibitor.", 
    "25": "We retrospectively investigated the efficacy of high dose omeprazole compared to a combined therapy of famotidine, pirenzepine and antacid for acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage (AUGIH) also adjuvant to endoscopic injection therapy if indicated. The clinical course of AUGIH was evaluated, if emergency endoscopy revealed lesions substantially dependent on intragastric acidity with respect to pathogenesis and/or healing (peptic ulcer, erosive gastroduodenitis, reflux-esophagitis, Mallory-Weiss tears) and patients either received a combined therapy of famotidine (20 mg i.v. every 12 hrs), pirenzepine (10 mg i.v. every 12 hrs) and antacid (control group: n = 96) or omeprazole (40 mg i.v. every 6 hrs; omeprazole group: n = 100). Rate of rebleeding was lower in the omeprazole group without reaching significance (12 vs. 21; p = 0.06). No difference was found for rates of operation (6 vs. 6; p = 0.94), death from bleeding (5 vs. 9; p = 0.22), transfusions ([mean +/- SD] 3.3 +/- 5.0 vs. 3.2 +/- 5.7; p = 0.51) and hospitalisation ([mean +/- SD] 26.8 +/- 12.1 vs. 27.8 +/- 16.0 days; p = 0.88). Considering prognostic risk factors (age > or = 65, actively bleeding lesion, initial state of shock) logistic regression showed that high dose omeprazole inhibited rebleeding (p = 0.01) but had no effect as regards surgery or mortality. Within two selected subgroups defined by additional criteria (no endoscopic treatment and anamnestic peptic lesion) omeprazole-treated cases showed lower rates of rebleeding (3/49 vs. 12/54, p \" 0.02 and 3/44 vs. 13/48, p = 0.01 resp.) and death from bleeding (0/46 vs. 6/50, p = 0.03 and 0/43 vs. 5/45, p = 0.03 resp.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "We compared effects of midazolam as intramuscular premedicant on hypnosis, sedation and antegrade amnesia when administered 15 (32 cases) and 30 (35 cases) min before induction of anesthesia. Hypnosis was obtained in 97 and 91%, and sedation in 97 and 100% of patients administered midazolam 15 and 30 min before induction, respectively. Antegrade amnesia was observed in 97 and 72% of patients administered midazolam 15 and 30 min before, respectively (statistically significant). If midazolam is administered 15 min before, the respiratory depression, one of its unacceptable side effects, may hardly occur because patient arrives operating room before its onset. We conclude that the appropriate time for administration of midazolam as intramuscular premedicant is 15 min, rather than 30 min, before the induction of anesthesia.", 
    "27": "The stability of lorazepam 0.1 mg/mL in three intravenous infusion solutions in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin bags at 37, 24, 4, and -20 degrees C was evaluated over seven days of storage. Triplicate test solutions of lorazepam 0.1 mg/mL in 50-mL PVC bags and 50-mL polyolefin bags containing 0.9% sodium chloride injection, 5% dextrose injection, and lactated Ringer's injection were prepared and stored at 37, 24, and 4 degrees C. Samples were removed initially and at various times over seven days and analyzed for lorazepam content. In addition, lorazepam 0.1 mg/mL in 5% dextrose injection in polyolefin bags was stored at -20 degrees C and samples were removed initially and after seven days and analyzed for lorazepam content. The rate of lorazepam sorptive loss to PVC bags was evaluated with lorazepam 0.1 mg/mL in 5% dextrose injection in PVC bags and stored at 24 degrees C. Samples were removed initially and after two, four, six, and eight hours. High-performance liquid chromatography was performed in duplicate on each sample for lorazepam quantitation. Rapid loss of lorazepam occurred in all samples stored in PVC bags. After seven days at 4 degrees C, 8-9% was lost from 0.9% sodium chloride injection and 5% dextrose injection. At 24 degrees C, 17% was lost in 24 hours; at 37 degrees C, 27-29% was lost in 24 hours. About 10% of the lorazepam was lost from the lactated Ringer's solution in PVC bags after three days at 4 degrees C; 25% was lost in 24 hours at 24 degrees C; and 25% was lost in eight hours at 37 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Nitrazepam (0.5-10 mg/kg, IP) dose dependently induced behavioral sleep in day-old chicks. Fluoxetine (0.1-1 mg/kg) did not produce sleep in the young birds, but the 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg) potentiated nitrazepam (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg)-induced hypnosis. Doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) of the benzodiazepine that did not produce sleep in any or all the chicks, when administered alone, induced sleep in some or all the chicks in the presence of fluoxetine (0.1 and 0.5 mg/kg). Ketanserin (0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg) effectively antagonized the effect of fluoxetine on nitrazepam-induced behavioral sleep. These results suggest that enhancement of 5-HT level by fluoxetine may be the mechanism involved in the potentiation of nitrazepam-induced sleep in the young chicks.", 
    "29": "Many new psychotherapeutic drugs are being developed for the major clinical indications for which they might be useful. As usual, we hope not only to obtain better drugs but also to posit hypotheses based on the presumed mode of action of effective drugs. Thus, we have a chance to test the role of serotonin, via the 5HT1A receptor, in anxiety or to test the possible significance of multiple benzodiazepine receptors. Among antidepressant agents, we have a chance to determine the relative roles of norpinephrine and serotonin in the pathogenesis of these disorders. We may also determine whether antidepressant actions involve a number of aminergic neurotransmitters. Among antipsychotic drugs, the importance of dopamine D2 receptor blockade has diminished with the advent of atypical drugs affecting a variety of other receptors. It might also be possible to delineate more clearly the role of serotonin in psychosis. The GABA hypothesis of mania can be tested in a number of ways by current drugs. The role of calcium antagonism remains to be demonstrated. The acetylcholine hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease will be tested further by new compounds under trial. However, it seems increasingly doubtful that current drugs under test will explicate the current hypothesis of the abnormal processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein in that disorder. Thus, we hope, as we have for the past three decades, to be able to use drugs not only to treat, but also to generate hypotheses. It is a kind of bootstrapping enterprise, but our ultimate hope is not only to be better able to treat our patients, but also to better understand their afflictions.",

This report presents the results of analysis of concentrations in plasma of adinazolam and its primary metabolite, N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD), determined as a part of a flexible-dose, double-blind study of the efficacy of adinazolam mesylate sustained release tablets in the treatment of panic disorder with agoraphobia. Dosages administered in the study were titrated from 30 mg/day up to a maximum of 120 mg/day. Concentrations in plasma were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography at clinical evaluations at the end of treatment weeks 1, 2, and 4. The concentrations of both compounds were proportional to the administered dose. An inverted U-shaped concentration-response curve was apparent, where response was based on a priori definitions contained in the study protocol. However, this was probably a result of the flexible-dose study design used. By use of the post hoc definitions of response, as measured by the Clinician's Global Improvement Scale and the total panic attack frequency, logistic regression analysis resulted in more adequate predictions of actual response frequencies. Results indicate that NDMAD contributes to the therapeutic effects of adinazolam mesylate sustained release tablets in the treatment of panic disorder. The exact contributions of adinazolam and NDMAD to response in panic disorder could not be determined, because of the correlation between adinazolam and NDMAD concentrations on multiple dosing.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "31": "Paradoxical sleep (PS) in mice, rats, and cats is preceded and sometimes followed by a short-lasting stage characterized by cortical high-amplitude spindles and hippocampal low-frequency theta rhythm. This intermediate stage (IS) seems to correspond to a transient functional disconnection of the forebrain from the brainstem. Pentobarbital and benzodiazepines greatly extend IS at the expense of PS, which is suppressed. Zolpidem, a new imidazopyridine hypnotic, was studied at 2.5, 5, and 7.5 mg/kg IP. At 2.5 mg/kg, which is already a true hypnotic dose, it only decreased PS during the first 2 h of recording with a rebound during the following 4 h of recording. At 5 mg/kg, zolpidem increased the number and total duration of IS episodes, increased IS episodes not followed by PS, and increased PS latency of occurrence. PS amount was decreased during the first three h with a rebound in the next 3 h. At 7.5 mg/kg, the total amount of PS was also decreased. The eye movement number and theta rhythm frequency of PS were unchanged. These results show that zolpidem produces less disruption of the association between IS and PS than do previous hypnotics.", 
    "32": "This study evaluated a possible mechanism by which glycine potentiates the activity of diazepam (DZP) and valproic acid (VAL) against the clonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in rats. Neither 7-chlorokynurenic acid (7-CLKYNA) nor strychnine in doses of 10, 50, or 100 nmol ICV significantly altered the clonic seizure response to PTZ. However, 7-CLKYNA (100 nmol, ICV), but not strychnine (100 nmol, ICV), antagonized the anticonvulsant activity induced by coadministration of DZP (1.0 mg/kg, IP) and glycine (40 mmol/kg, PO). Neither 7-CLKYNA (100 nmol, ICV) nor strychnine (100 nmol, ICV) significantly altered the anticonvulsant activity induced by coadministration of VAL and glycine. 7-CLKYNA (100 nmol, ICV) had no effect on the anticonvulsant activity of DZP or VAL in the absence of glycine. These results provide evidence that the glycine potentiation of the anticonvulsant activity of DZP in clonic seizures induced by PTZ may be mediated by the strychnine-insensitive glycine receptor.", 
    "33": "Postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra-abdominal operations. The postoperative delay of bowel movement, however, is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used. In order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic-induced postoperative delay of bowel movement, two types of intravenous-based anaesthesia using fentanyl/midazolam (1 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h), and ketamine/midazolam (250 mg/25 mg; dosage 0.1 ml/kg/h) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique (enflurane; mean concentration 1.5 vol%). METHODS. In three groups of patients (each n = 15) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities, induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital (1-1.5 mg/kg) to facilitate intubation. For the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium bromide was used. All patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis, and they were artificially ventilated with N2O/O2 (60:40) to normal end-expiratory CO2 concentrations. No anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility. In order to determine gastro-intestinal motility, the H2 exhalation test was used. For this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a gastral tube shortly before extubation. Lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it enters the colon, and H2 is released, taken up by the vascular system and exhaled. Postoperatively, patients were asked to exhale into a 20-ml syringe every 10 min. The content was analysed for hydrogen (ppm), using an electrochemical sensor (GMI exhaled hydrogen monitor). From the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in end-expiratory hydrogen concentration (compared to the preoperative value), gastro-coecal transit time was computed. RESULTS. All three groups of patients were comparable in age, height and body weight. Also, the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups. Mean gastro-coecal transit time was 204 (+/- 19.6, SD) min following enflurane, 302 (+/- 32.8 SD) min following fentanyl/-midazolam and 210 (+/- 28.8 SD) min following ketamine/midazolam anaesthesia. The gastro-intestinal inhibition after the opioid-based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged (p < 0.001, Kruskal-Wallis test). There was no significance between patients after ketamine-based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION. When using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid, gastro-intestinal inhibition, especially in patients prone to have constipation, is likely to develop postoperatively. In classical neuroleptanaesthesia and in analgosedation in the ICU, the simultaneous use of the butyrophenone droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid-related gastrointestinal motility. In cases of opioid-related gastrointestinal atonia a gastrokinetic compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility.", 
    "34": "Histamine and the guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)-inducing agent sodium nitroprusside both increased serotonin (5-HT) uptake and cGMP levels in isolated human platelets in vitro. Histaminergic stimulation was observed at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 0.25 microM [mean effective concentration (EC50) = 0.1 microM histamine]. The inhibition produced by the H2-receptor antagonists tiotidine, metiamide, and cimetidine was 10-10(5) times more potent on histamine receptors regulating 5-HT uptake and cGMP generation in human platelets than on the histaminergic receptors H1, HIC, H2, and H3 in other tissues. The in vitro histamine-induced 5-HT uptake was prevented by preincubation of isolated human platelets in the presence of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor NG-monomethyl-L-arginine or the cGMP-lowering agent LY-83583. Histamine was ineffective in stimulating cAMP generation in human platelets and did not interact with effector sites known to downregulate 5-HT uptake, including imipramine, gamma-aminobutyric acid A, peripheral type benzodiazepine-binding sites, and V1a vasopressin receptors inducing human platelet shape change and aggregation. These atypical human platelet histaminergic receptors differ from the previously classified histamine receptors by their apparent high affinity to histamine H2-receptor antagonists and their apparent link with the soluble, nitric oxide-dependent guanylate cyclase. These findings suggest that human platelets express a new subtype H2h of histamine receptors.", 
    "35": "Muscarinic receptors (mAChRs) in the pontine reticular formation comprise a critical part of the REM sleep-generating system. Although the role of specific mAChR subtypes remains unclear, data from in vivo microinjection studies suggest that in the pons the M2 subtype is important for REM sleep generation. The present study tested the hypothesis that M2 antagonists would show a greater binding potency in feline pons than M1 or M3 antagonists. Competition binding assays showed 4-DAMP to be more potent than pirenzepine or AF-DX 116 in its ability to displace tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate, and linear regression analyses indicated that 4-DAMP and pirenzepine each interacted with more than one binding site. These data demonstrate the presence of a mixture of mAChR subtypes in the feline pons, and are consistent with the view that REM sleep is mediated by more than one mAChR subtype.", 
    "36": "The purpose of this study was to compare HMPAO- and IMZ-SPECT findings in treated and untreated patients with focal epilepsies. We examined 20 patients (untreated 13; treated 7). All patients had a normal CT and/or MRI scan. In all patients both whole-brain activity and regional count density (rcd) were evaluated by SPECT. Furthermore, the specific and non-specific binding of IMZ were calculated for each ROI and the results of both, treated and untreated patients were compared. Our data indicate that the normalized cerebral total binding of IMZ was significantly increased in all regions in the group of treated patients (p < 0.001). In contrast, no difference in the tracer binding was found with HMPAO-SPECT. We conclude that the difference in the IMZ-binding might be due either to exogenous or endogenous factors. In our study IMZ-SPECT had a higher sensitivity and a lower specificity in the detection of decreased rcd in areas with EEG findings that indicate an epileptogenic focus compared with HMPAO-SPECT.", 
    "37": "The purpose of this study was to examine the anaesthetic requirement of intrathecal midazolam in a dose-response fashion in isoflurane-anaesthetized, tracheostomized rats, and to evaluate the apnoeic threshold after each intrathecal midazolam dose. Intrathecal midazolam, 5, 10, 20, and 30 micrograms, was administered to 25 anaesthetized tracheotomized rats. Isoflurane MAC was determined by the tail-clamp method. The effect of intrathecal midazolam on the apnoeic threshold was evaluated, and light and electron microscopy studies were performed on cervical, thoracic and lumbar sections of the spinal cord to investigate possible midazolam-induced neurotoxic effects. Intrathecal midazolam 5, 10, 20 and 30 micrograms decreased isoflurane MAC by 16%, 31%, 42%, and 53% respectively (P < 0.05). The apnoeic threshold was increased by midazolam 5 micrograms (from a PaCO2 of 4.25 +/- 0.55 to 5.28 +/- 0.76 kPa, P < 0.05) when compared with baseline values, but not further by additional doses. Light and electron microscopy studies on sections taken from the spinal cord of four animals did not show any morphological changes suggestive of midazolam-induced neurotoxicity when compared with similar preparations obtained from controls. These data suggest that intrathecal midazolam possesses dose-dependent antinociceptive properties which, associated with the ceiling effect of the apnoeic threshold obtained at the lowest midazolam dose and the lack of neurotoxic effects, may potentiate inhalational anaesthesia without producing marked respiratory depression.", 
    "38": "This investigation studied the effect of two intravenous benzodiazepines and the specific reversal agent, flumazenil, on the sensitivity of upper airway reflexes. In a blinded, randomised, crossover study, we have investigated the effect of a single dose of diazepam ('Diazemuls') (0.2 mg.kg-1) and midazolam (0.07 mg.kg-1), both given intravenously on the sensitivity of upper airway reflexes in eight male volunteers. Reflex sensitivity was assessed by identification of reflex glottic closure in response to a threshold concentration of inhaled ammonia vapour. Both diazepam and midazolam produced significant depression of upper airway reflex sensitivity. This was maximum with both drugs within 10 min of administration, but baseline sensitivity was regained within 60 min. Flumazenil (300 micrograms) administered 10 min after midazolam, resulted in significant reversal of the upper airway reflex sensitivity depression.", 
    "39": "We previously demonstrated that O-demethylation of the pendant dimethoxyphenol ring of epipodophyllotoxins to produce their respective catechol metabolites is catalyzed by cytochrome(s) P450 in human liver microsomes. Our objective was to identify the specific human cytochrome(s) P450 responsible for catechol formation. Using a panel of prototypical substrates and inhibitors for specific cytochromes P450, we identified substrates for CYP3A4 (midazolam, erythromycin, cyclosporin, and dexamethasone) as inhibitors of catechol formation from both etoposide and teniposide. Dexamethasone inhibition was competitive, with Ki values of 60 and 45 microM for etoposide and teniposide, respectively. In 58 human livers, the correlation coefficients for teniposide catechol formation versus 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam formation were 80% and 85%, respectively; for etoposide catechol formation versus 1'- and 4-hydroxymidazolam formation r2 was 83% and 79%, respectively. Teniposide and etoposide catechol formation rates were also significantly correlated with immunodetectable CYP3A (r2 = 49% and 51%, respectively) and not with immunodetectable CYP1A2, 2E1, or 2C8. Finally, cDNAs for human CYP3A4, 3A5, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, and 2C9 were functionally expressed in HepG2 cells, using a vaccinia viral vector. Teniposide and etoposide catechol formation was catalyzed primarily by 3A4 (15.4 and 40.9 pmol/pmol/hr, respectively) and to a lesser degree by 3A5 (1.94 and 11.3 pmol/pmol/hr, respectively), whereas there was no detectable O-demethylation of epipodophyllotoxins by 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, or the control virus alone. Moreover, the relative activities of midazolam hydroxylation, compared with O-demethylation of epipodophyllotoxins, were similar for heterologously expressed 3A4 and for human liver microsomes. We conclude that catechol formation from teniposide and etoposide is primarily mediated by human CYP3A4, making these reactions susceptible to inhibition by prototypical 3A substrates and inhibitors.", 
    "40": "The peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) was identified and characterized by its high affinity for two distinct classes of compounds, the benzodiazepines (BZs) and the isoquinolines (IQs). An M(r) 18,000 IQ-binding protein has been identified as the PBR. In this report we isolated and sequenced a 626-base pair cDNA, specifying an open reading frame of 169 amino acid residues with a predicted molecular weight of 18,843, from MA-10 mouse tumor Leydig cells [i.e., mouse peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (mPBR)]. Expression of mPBR cDNA in simian virus 40-transformed 3T3 fibroblasts resulted in an increase in the density of both BZ and IQ binding sites. To examine whether the increased drug binding was due to the M(r) 18,000 PBR protein alone or to other constitutively expressed components of the receptor, an in vitro system was developed using recombinant mPBR protein. The mPBR cDNA was inserted in the pMAL-c2 vector downstream from the malE gene, which encodes maltose-binding protein (MBP). Transfection of the recombinant pMAL-c2 in Escherichia coli provided high levels of expression of the MBP-mPBR fusion protein. Purified MBP-mPBR recombinant fusion protein incorporated into liposomes, but not MBP alone, was able to bind IQs but not BZs. Addition of MA-10 mitochondrial extracts to the liposomes resulted in the restoration of BZ binding. The protein responsible for this effect was then purified and identified as the M(r) 34,000 voltage-dependent anion channel protein, which by itself does not express any BZ and IQ binding. These results provide strong evidence that PBR is not a single protein receptor but a multimeric complex in which the IQ binding site is on the M(r) 18,000 subunit and expression of the BZ binding site requires both the M(r) 18,000 and 34,000 voltage-dependent anion channel subunits.", 
    "41": "Regional downregulation of brain benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors was studied in rats treated with flurazepam or diazepam protocols known to produce anticonvulsant tolerance. Zolpidem, a selective BZ1 receptor agonist, was used to detect BZ1 receptors; flunitrazepam, a nonselective BZ receptor agonist, was used to detect the total BZ receptor population. Rats were treated 4 weeks with flurazepam, then sacrificed immediately or 48 hr later. After flurazepam treatment, the maximal binding capacity of [3H]zolpidem binding decreased 22% in the cerebral cortex, 32% in the cerebellum and 25% in the hippocampus. The Kd increased in the cerebellum. The maximal binding capacity of [3H]flunitrazepam binding decreased by 13% in the cerebral cortex and 14% in the hippocampus, but did not change in the cerebellum. The Kd increased in the hippocampus. At 48 hr after flurazepam treatment, there was no significant difference in [3H]zolpidem binding between treated and control rats. In rats treated 3 weeks with diazepam released from s.c. reservoirs, there was no change in [3H]zolpidem binding. The data suggest that chronic flurazepam treatment causes downregulation primarily involving BZ1 receptors. The differing effects on [3H]-zolpidem and [3H]flunitrazepam binding, especially in the cerebellum in which more than 90% of the receptors are the BZ1 subtype, may indicate a shift in BZ receptor subtypes in flurazepam-tolerant rats, suggesting a change in the subunit composition or conformation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA/BZ receptors.", 
    "42": "Various brain imaging techniques have become available in the past decade. These include techniques to evaluate brain structure using X-ray computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and techniques to assess brain functional activities (cerebral blood flow, brain energy metabolism and brain protein synthesis) using positron emission tomography (PET). PET also makes it possible for the first time to evaluate the states of various types of neurotransmitter receptors, such as dopamine D2 and D1, serotonin 5-HT2, muscarinic cholinergic, opiate, benzodiazepine and histamine H1, and to determine the state of monoamine oxidase (A and B) under in vivo conditions. These techniques cannot only be used to map \"brain neurochemistry\" in normal human beings, but they will also increase our knowledge by demonstrating neurochemical abnormalities in a wide range of neurological and psychiatric disorders or those that happen during normal aging. The PET techniques may be applicable to the development of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry. We have been exploring the methodology of using 11C-labeled antagonists for mapping functional neurotransmitter receptors in human brain directly and noninvasively by PET. The present review article provides an outline of the conceptual and methodological progress over the past several years that has made it possible to visualize neurotransmitter receptors in the living human brain by PET on the basis of our original work.",

Twenty-four patients were exposed to one of four tape-recorded lists of words and 24 were presented with a blank tape. There was no instance of free recall of presented words. Analysis of the responses in the implicit memory test revealed no difference between the performance of the patients who had been exposed to a word list and those who had not.", 
    "44": "The imidazobenzodiazepine ethyl 8-azido-5,6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5-a][1,4]benzodiazepine -3-carboxylate (Ro 15-4513) is important as a potential \"drink and drive\" drug due to effects on receptors in brain neurones, resulting in alcohol intoxication-antagonistic properties. Because of the molecule's importance its effect on alcohol metabolism in liver has been investigated. Ro 15-4513 was found to be, like its parent compound the 8-fluoro analogue flumazenil, a reversible alcohol competitive inhibitor of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) with a dissociation constant of 345 microM at pH 7.0. Due to its azido group Ro 15-4513 was developed as a potential photoaffinity-labeling reagent for benzodiazepine receptors. Used with horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase, the enzyme is chemically modified and inactivated in a Michaelis-Menten type reaction via a reversible enzyme-Ro 15-4513 complex with a dissociation constant of 8.6 mM at pH 7.0. The inactivation reaction has been studied over the pH 6.0-10.0 range. The dissociation constants for the binding of Ro 15-4513 to the enzyme and the first-order rate constants for inactivation have been determined as a function of pH. These give pKa values of 7.2 and 8.8 for the free enzyme, the latter being assigned to the zinc-water ionization. The enzyme is protected from inactivation in a competitive manner by flumazenil and by many heterocyclic and thiol compounds which combine with the active-site zinc. Flumazenil has a similar binding affinity as Ro 15-4513 with an enzyme-flumazenil dissociation constant of 6.0 mM at pH 7.0. Ro 15-4513 may also have potential as a photoaffinity-labeling reagent for other metallo enzymes. Whether the effects of Ro 15-4513 on alcohol-metabolizing enzymes are also of clinical significance remains to be determined.",

    "51": "Forms from 656 patients were collected from 32 hospitals. The male/female ratio was 2/1; the median age, 38 years (range, 18-80). Thirty-five percent received concomitant antipsychotics, 28% benzodiazepines, 19% anticholinergics, 11% antidepressants, 8% antiepileptics, (carbamazepine, valproate, and phenobarbital), and 2% lithium. While there were no gender differences with respect to concurrent psychotropics, women received lower doses of clozapine than men (median dose, women 300 mg/day and men 400 mg/day, p < .02). Ten percent had had a neutrophil count < 2000/microL (3.2% < 1500/microL). Five percent had repeated neutrophil counts < 2000/microL (1.5% < 1500/microL).

They both underwent a complete neurological evaluation also including neuroradiological, neurophysiological and neuropsychological assessment. Both patients had already been treated with benzodiazepines and amitriptyline; the older one was also given haloperidol and chlorimipramine with definite, but short-lasting improvement. During hospitalization a therapeutic trial with fluoxetine (20 mg/day in the younger patient and 40 mg/day in the older) in association with chlorimipramine (75 mg/day) was initiated, leading to a significant reduction (at least 50%) of abnormal movements and obsessive-compulsive behaviour. The older patient had no side effects while the 21 year old subject complained of insomnia, urinary retention and anorexia; despite the objective improvement, these side effects led us to modify the therapy after the first month. The favourable action of serotoninergic agents on TS symptoms supports the hypothesis that the multiple tics of the syndrome are motor compulsions.", 
    "54": "1. Endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands are thought to influence the human hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and naloxone, a known stimulator of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release, is thought to act via release of hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing hormone. 2. The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of endogenous benzodiazepine-receptor ligands by administering flumazenil (Ro15-1788), a benzodiazepine antagonist, and measuring ACTH and cortisol release, both basal and during naloxone-stimulation. 3. Nine normal volunteers in a placebo-controlled double-blind design were studied. Flumazenil (0.5 mg, i.v. bolus) was given 2 min before naloxone (125 micrograms/kg bodyweight, i.v. bolus) immunoreactive-adrenocorticotropic hormone (IR-ACTH) and cortisol levels were measured at frequent intervals from 60 min before to 120 min after naloxone injection. 4. Flumazenil had no effect on ACTH and cortisol release when given alone; flumazenil area under the ACTH/time curve (pmol/L.min) = -36.5 +/- 63.5 compared with placebo = -53.5 +/- 31.8, flumazenil area under the cortisol/time curve (nmol/L.min x 10(-3)) = - 2.4 +/- 2.4 compared with placebo -0.56 +/- 1.4. Flumazenil did not change the ACTH and cortisol release achieved with naloxone; naloxone area under the ACTH/time curve (pmol/L.min) = 327.8 +/- 61.7 compared with flumazenil/naloxone = 366.3 +/- 88.1, naloxone area under the cortisol/time curve (nmol/L. min x 10(-3) = 12.2 +/- 3.4 compared with naloxone/flumazenil = 10.5 +/- 2.1. 5. The authors conclude that flumazenil dose not modify basal or stimulated ACTH and cortisol release in healthy humans. This would suggest that endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligands and the benzodiazepine/gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor complex do not tonically influence the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.", 
    "55": "The relationship between subjective effects and drug preferences in normal volunteers was explored in a meta-analysis of several previously published studies. Subjective effects of, and preference for, ethanol and diazepam vs. placebo were measured using a choice procedure. Subjects were grouped according to their drug choices: 'non-choosers' never chose drug, whereas 'choosers' always chose drug. The two groups were compared on their subjective responses to drug and on demographic variables. Ethanol decreased Arousal, Elation, Positive Mood and Vigor, and increased Anxiety, Depression and Fatigue in the non-choosers, whereas it increased Arousal and Vigor in the choosers. Ethanol choosers were also more likely to be males and/or full-time students than non-choosers. Diazepam produced sedative-like effects in both choosers and non-choosers, but markedly decreased Anxiety and increased Friendliness in choosers only. Diazepam choice was also associated with more frequent recreational use of marijuana and stimulants. Thus, both demographic variables and subjective drug effects were related to drug preference.", 
    "56": "The molecular mechanisms regulating GABAA receptor activity in cultured frog melanotrophs were studied using the patch-clamp technique. In the whole-cell configuration, application of GABA evoked a dose-related increase of inward chloride currents. The ED50 value, estimated from the sigmoidal dose-response curve was 2 x 10(-6) M and the Hill coefficient was 1.55. The amplitude of the GABA-induced current decayed with time. Kinetics analysis of the desensitization revealed that the time-course of the current decrement was fitted by one exponential. Graded doses of GABA or association of GABA with the benzodiazepine receptor agonist flunitrazepam accelerated the desensitization process. In contrast, the time-course of the current did not significantly vary at different holding potentials. In the outside-out configuration, GABA was found to activate channels which displayed three unitary conductance levels (8, 15 and 30 pS). The channel openings of the more frequent conductance level (30 pS) exhibited short and long lasting open states (1.2 and 28.3 ms at -60 mV). Altogether these data reveal that frog melanotrophs possess a single population of GABAA receptors which interconvert into a higher affinity state in the presence of benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Two GABA molecules must bind to the receptor to trigger long lasting channel openings. In addition, the activity of the GABAA receptor appears to be independent of the accumulation of intracellular chloride ions.", 
    "57": "1. Activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors in the brainstem network of respiratory neurones is required to terminate inspiration in the absence of lung afferents, but it is not required in the inspiratory motor act of lung inflation. In the present study we examined the involvement of non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptors in these two mechanisms in the adult mammal. 2. Adult cats were either decerebrated or anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone, paralysed and ventilated. Inspiratory motor output was recorded from the phrenic nerve and central respiratory activity from neurones in the bulbar ventral respiratory group. 3. In decerebrate vagotomized cats, ionophoretic application of 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo(F)quinoxaline (NBQX) onto single respiratory neurones decreased their spontaneous discharge rate and abolished the excitatory effect of exogenously applied (RS) alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazoleproprionic acid (AMPA) but not NMDA. 4. In these animals, intravenous infusion (12 mg kg-1) of the non-NMDA receptor blockers GYKI 52466 (1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylene-dioxy-5-H-2,3-benzodi aze pine) or NBQX: (1) decreased (in 10/15 cats) or abolished (in 5/15 cats) the inspiratory-related discharge of the phrenic nerve; (2) did not prolong the inspiratory phase; (3) reduced or abolished the spontaneous discharge of respiratory neurones; and (4) profoundly decreased the excitatory effects of AMPA but not NMDA ionophoresed onto these neurones. When both the phrenic nerve and the recorded respiratory neurone were silenced, neuronal excitation by ionophoretic application of NMDA first revealed a subthreshold respiratory modulation without lengthening of the inspiratory phase, then respiratory modulation became undetectable. 5. Additional blockade of NMDA receptors by a small dose (0.15 mg kg-1) of dizocilpine (MK-801), abolished the phrenic nerve activity which persisted after NBQX (apnoea), but the discharge or the subthreshold modulation of the bulbar respiratory neurones showed a lengthening of the inspiratory phase (apneusis). 6. Elevation of FA,CO2 increased or re-established phrenic nerve discharges after blockade of non-NMDA receptors or of both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. 7. Small doses of NBQX or GYKI 52466 induced apnoea in five of five cats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. 8. In decerebrate animals with intact vagi, GYKI 52466 and NBQX depressed the Hering-Breuer expiratory-lengthening reflex. 9. The results suggest that: (1) there is a specialization of different classes of glutamate receptors participating in timing mechanisms and transmission within the mammalian respiratory network. Neural transmission predominantly involves activation of non-NMDA receptors, acting in synergy with NMDA receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "58": "Recent advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) have allowed the development of appropriate pharmacological interventions. Although at the present time there are no approved medications for this indication in the US, several well-designed studies have been conducted that guide the clinician's treatment of PMS. As a result, less-proven nonpharmacological modalities, such as dietary modification, exercise regimens and psychotherapy, are more quickly supplanted by the use of medication. Three classes of agents have been proven efficacious and are widely used to treat the disorder. These include benzodiazepines (especially alprazolam), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (especially fluoxetine), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) [luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH)] agonists. In addition to these medications which are used to treat the generalised syndrome of PMS, a variety of other drugs are used in the treatment of specific aspects of this disorder. Despite the success of these treatments, each has a substantial adverse effect profile which modulates their use in some patients. Knowledge of these potential adverse effects and their management should help optimise therapy. In addition, a variety of less well-proven pharmacological remedies are commonly in use. The adverse effects of these medications may well outweigh their benefits.", 
    "59": "As colonoscopy is often painful, a premedication appears to be indispensable. Commonly, benzodiazepines, i.e. midazolam, alone or in combination with analgesic drugs are used. Besides all advantages, midazolam especially is known to have the risk of oversedation and respiratory depression. Therefore it should be used at minimal dose. In a double-blind, randomized study, three premedication-schedules of midazolam (mid) plus ketamine (ket) were compared in 33 patients, aged between 8 and 60 years, with regard to safety and acceptance by patients and endoscopist. I: ket 1 mg/kg+mid 0.1 mg/kg, max. 5 mg II: ket 1 mg/kg+mid 0.05 mg/kg, max. 2.5 mg III: ket 0.75 mg/kg+mid 0.1 mg/kg, max. 5 mg Oxygen-saturation, heart rate and blood pressure were recorded as well as the evaluations of sedation, cooperation and complaint of pain. To assess the recovery-time of the patients, the reaction time and the attention were evaluated by \"Wiener's determination apparatus\" and \"test d2\", respectively, before and at 1, 2, 3 and 4 hours after premedication. Medication I resulted in heavy sedation, good cooperation and amnesia but had the strongest tendency towards hypoxemia. Under schedule III, reduced cooperation and acceptance were seen due to a strong experience of pain. The best conditions during the examination with regard to cooperation, experience of pain and acceptance were found after premedication II without relevant depression of vital parameters. It can be concluded that midazolam can be used at minimal recommended doses as premedication for colonoscopy if combined with ketamine in a sufficient analgesic dosage.",

Thermodynamic parameters (Eact, delta H++, delta S++, delta G++) involved in the rearrangement reaction, studied using either CH3CN-0.2 N NaOH in H2O (1:1, v/v) or CH3CN-0.2 N NaOD in D2O (1:1, v/v) as the solvent, were similar with an isotope effect (kH/kD) of 0.77 +/- 0.03. Kinetics of the rearrangement reaction were studied as a function of NaOH concentration, temperature and ionic strength. Results indicated that the rate-determining step did not involve proton exchange with solvent. Mass spectral analysis of the cyclic diamides derived by using either D2O or H2(18)O in the solvent mixtures suggested that the formation of the cyclic diamide involved a nucleophilic addition of a hydroxide ion at the C2 carbonyl carbon of temazepam.",

    "63": "Critically ill patients experience many unpleasant and frightening events while in an ICU. Appropriate concern for pain, discomfort, and anxiety is required from caregivers. The use of reassuring mannerisms, honest communication, and analgesics and sedatives, especially during therapeutic paralysis, improves patient comfort and reduces the morbidity rate. This article reviews the therapeutic options for sedation and experience with these agents in the critically ill.", 
    "64": "Elderly patients are susceptible to disruptions in mood from a variety of sources: primary anxiety or mood disorders, medical illnesses and treatments, and psychosocial stressors. The goals of intervention are to discover reversible etiologies, treat in the least intrusive manner, and improve or restore quality of life. The clinical presentation may vary from typical anxiety or depression, to mixed symptoms, to a highly somatized or dementia-like picture. The most common disturbance is mixed anxiety/depression. Once the threshold is reached for drug therapy, there are safe and effective remedies, including azapirones, short-acting benzodiazepines, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and others. Because elderly patients are more vulnerable to drug side effects such as sedation and orthostatic hypotension, selection of the therapeutic agent is crucial. Management strategies, therefore, tend to avoid sedating agents and those with strong autonomic effects. Antipsychotic drugs, unless specifically indicated--for example, in cases of delusional depression--are to be avoided in simple anxiety/depression syndromes. Prescribers for patients in nursing facilities must also observe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) regulations. These include preference for psychosocial over drug therapies, avoidance of physical and chemical restraint, and minimal use of any psychotropic medication.",

Behavioral symptoms frequently present the greatest challenge for caregivers and are often the determining factor in institutional placement. Determining the need for pharmacologic treatment of an agitated patient requires considering the full range of biopsychosocial variables and ultimately involves assessing the risks and benefits of the medications selected for the patient. In this article, the phenomenology of agitation is reviewed along with the pharmacologic treatment of agitation in patients with dementia, including the use of benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, beta-adrenergic-blocking agents, serotonergic agents, carbamazepine, and lithium.",

    "68": "Insomnia improved after 1 night of treatment with 15 mg of quazepam. Eighty-five percent of patients rated their quality of sleep as fair-to-excellent after 1 week of treatment. Similar efficacy outcomes also were observed on the second through sixth nights of treatment. Improvement occurred for patients who had an initial sleep latency complaint or unsatisfactory duration of sleep and for those who either had difficulty in staying asleep or complained of early morning awakening. The mean number of insomnia complaints was significantly (p < .001) reduced after the first and the seventh nights of treatment both in the population of all evaluable patients and in a subset of patients with more severe insomnia.",

    "70": "An involvement of GABAA receptors in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) gene expression in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) was investigated using immunohistochemistry (IMHC) and nonradioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISH). The number of TH-positive cells was increased for both ISH and IMHC 8 h after a single administration of benzodiazepine diazepam, which facilitates GABAA-receptor-mediated transmission and reduces dopamine release in the substantia nigra (SN). Such increase in TH staining was suppressed when a dopamine D2 receptor agonist quinpirole was administered 10 min after diazepam. Co-administration of diazepam with a dopamine antagonist haloperidol did not further elevate, but rather, reduced haloperidol-induced increases in TH labeling. These results suggest that haloperidol and diazepam regulate TH gene expression in the SNr commonly by depressing dopaminergic transmission, and that diazepam activates TH expression in a group of SNr neurons which express this gene after haloperidol treatment. Moreover, a GABAA receptor antagonist, picrotoxin, activated TH gene expression in the SNr, and diazepam antagonized picrotoxin effects. Since picrotoxin increases neuronal activity, additional mechanisms will operate on TH gene expression. In conclusion, GABAergic substances will activate TH gene expression in SNr neurons (1) through decreasing spontaneous somato-dendritic dopamine release in the substantia nigra and/or (2) by increasing the activity of these neurons.", 
    "71": "1. In the immature rat in vitro hemisected spinal cord preparation the dorsal root-evoked depolarizing potential recorded from an adjacent dorsal root DR-DRP had a mean peak amplitude (+/- s.e.mean, n = 27) of 2.9 +/- 0.2 mV and a mean latency to peak amplitude of 106 +/- 3 ms. The DR-DRP amplitude was maximal with a stimulus intensity of four times the threshold intensity required to activate the lowest threshold fibres. The peak amplitude and/or integral over a time-source of 0.5 s were used to assess the effects of applied drugs. 2. The DR-DRP was abolished by baclofen (mean IC50 190 +/- 46 nM, n = 7). The depressant effect of baclofen was reversed by CGP35348 (1 mM). The mean apparent Kd value calculated from dose-ratios was 16.7 +/- 6.4 microM (n = 3). 3. At a maximally effective concentration, tizanidine (1 microM) produced at the most only a 14% depression of the DR-DRP (n = 4). Clonidine (0.3 microM) had an effect similar to that of tizanidine. These depressant effects were reversed by idazoxan (1 microM). 4. The DR-DRP was potentiated by diazepam in a flumazenil (1 microM)-reversible manner. A maximal potentiation of 23.2 +/- 2.7% (n = 5) was produced by 1 microM diazepam. 5. Diazepam (1 microM) induced a mean bicuculline- (10 microM, n = 2) and flumazenil- (1 microM, n = 8) sensitive depolarization in the dorsal root of 0.25 +/- 0.03 mV (n = 8). However, diazepam failed to depolarize dorsal roots (n = 3) which had been excised from the spinal cord. 6. Comparison of the above effects with previously reported depressant effects of these drugs on the synaptic output from ventral roots suggests that actions on presynaptic inhibition, as reflected in the DR-DRP, are of subsidiary importance in explaining the muscle relaxant actions of tizanidine or diazepam.",

First-time psychotropic medication use, severity of agoraphobic disability, and longer duration of illness predicted less global improvement at post-treatment. Pre-treatment severity of agoraphobia predicted less improvement both in the short- and the long-term. Predictors of poorer outcome at 6-month follow-up were older age, past history of depression, severity of phobia targets, and longer duration of illness. Sex, source of referral, pre-treatment depression-anxiety-panic, and expectancy from treatment did not relate to outcome.", 
    "73": "1. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, acute pharmacokinetic, neurophysiological and psychotropic effects of suriclone, a new cyclopyrrolone derivative, were investigated and compared with alprazolam. 2. Fifteen normal young volunteers received randomized oral single doses of placebo, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg suriclone as well as 1 mg alprazolam as reference compound. Investigations were carried out before and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h after drug administration. 3. Pharmacokinetic investigations by radioimmunoassay showed a dose-dependent fast rise of plasma concentrations with a peak at 1 h and a rapid decline thereafter. Both the Cmax and the AUC values exhibited a linear relationship to dose. 4. EEG brain mapping demonstrated significant CNS effects of both compounds, characteristic for tranquillizers (increase of beta, decrease of alpha and increase of delta activity; attenuation of total power and acceleration of the centroid, i.e. centre of gravity frequency). When compared with alprazolam, suriclone exerted less sedative effects. 5. Time-efficacy calculations showed the pharmacodynamic peak effect of suriclone from the 2nd to the 4th hour, and of alprazolam in the 1st hour. Dose-efficacy calculations showed that the most pronounced CNS changes occurred after 1 mg alprazolam, followed by 0.4, 0.2 and 0.1 mg suriclone. 6. Psychometric investigations demonstrated no significant effects after the two lower doses of suriclone, while 0.4 mg and 1 mg alprazolam induced a decrement both in noopsychic and thymopsychic variables seen after higher doses of anxiolytic sedatives. Psychophysiology (critical flicker fusion, pupillometry, and skin conductance measures) pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. 7. Psychophysiology (critical flicker fusion, pupillometry and skin conductance measures) showed differential dose-dependent effects. Pulse rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged. Anxiolytic-characteristic side-effects (tiredness, drowsiness, etc.) occurred predominantly after the highest doses 0.4 mg suriclone and 1 mg alprazolam.", 
    "74": "Using a longitudinal life-table analysis, we assessed the efficacy of lithium alone, administered within the context of a naturalistic clinical setting, by calculating the probability of patients remaining free of an affective episode (manic or depressive) over a five-year course. In addition, for those who suffered a manic or depressive relapse, we attempted to analyse the subsequent course of patients who suffered a manic/hypomanic or depressive relapse and were then restabilised on lithium plus either a neuroleptic, carbamazepine, or a benzodiazepine, or lithium plus an antidepressant. Lithium alone offered an average 83% probability against an affective relapse after one year, 52% after three years, and 37% after five years. For patients who failed on lithium alone, it appeared that combination treatment offered greater protection against subsequent affective relapse than the initial course on lithium alone.", 
    "75": "Fourier transform-Raman and IR spectra of four compounds that are closely related to diazepam (Valium) have been recorded. The compounds, delorazepam, fludiazepam, flurazepam, and tetrazepam, are all 7-chloro-1,3-dihydro-[2H]-1,4-benzodiazepine -2-ones and differ from diazepam by the substituents at positions 1 and 5 of the diazepine ring. The spectra show characteristic features associated with both the diazepine ring and substituents. A strong line near 1610 cm-1 in the Raman spectra is assigned to the C = N stretch of the diazepine ring, and very strong IR absorption near 1690 cm-1 is attributed to the C = O stretching mode. Various IR and Raman vibrational features serve to characterize and differentiate these molecules. Evidence for intermolecular hydrogen bonding in one of the compounds (delorazepam) is presented.", 
    "76": "Therapeutic drug monitoring data for amitriptyline (AT) and nortriptyline (NT) collected during 10 years (total of 4,278 analyses in 2,937 patients) were evaluated to study how other drugs affect the kinetics at steady state. The distribution of the ratio concentration/daily dose (C/D) in patients treated with the antidepressant only was compared with that in patients on different concomitant drugs. Patients on phenothiazines or dextropropoxyphene had a significantly higher mean C/D of NT than controls, both when AT and when NT had been given. The highest values were seen with levomepromazine and thioridazine. On the contrary, the mean C/D of both AT and NT in patients on carbamazepine was about 50% lower than in those treated with the antidepressant only. Benzodiazepines did not affect the steady-state kinetics of AT or NT. Intraindividual comparisons of the ratio C/D in subjects with analyses performed when off and on concomitant drugs corroborate previous results showing that drugs metabolized by the debrisoquine hydroxylase (CYP2D6) inhibit the metabolism of NT and that carbamazepine induces the metabolism of both AT and NT. Modeling of the dose dependency of the NT interactions with levomepromazine, perphenazine, and thioridazine revealed that the ratio C/D was most affected at low doses of the antidepressant and at high doses of the phenothiazine. The distribution of the doses given was the same in patients on monotherapy as in patients with interacting drugs, which means that many patients treated with phenothiazines had concentrations above the therapeutic range and that most patients treated with carbamazepine had subtherapeutic levels. The present study shows that therapeutic drug monitoring may serve as a valuable tool to discover and quantify drug interactions.", 
    "77": "In a study designed to evaluate the impact of benzodiazepine use on the outcome of behaviour therapy, 91, severe, chronic agoraphobics (46 BDZ users and 45 non-users) were randomly allocated on a double-blind basis to in vivo exposure with low-dose diazepam (ED) or placebo (EP). Drug doses were adjusted on the basis of weekly psychiatric assessments over weeks 1-4. Patients had 8 x 2 hr exposure sessions (weeks 5-12) and were then withdrawn from medication (weeks 13-16). Re-assessments were completed at weeks 4, 12 and 16, and follow-up assessments at approx 20, 46 and 72 weeks. In the analysis of the results, the clinical outcome was evaluated in relation to the therapeutic regime (ED vs EP) and prior BDZ use (users vs non-users). The results showed that the ED group had greater changes in anxiety than the EP group during the drug manipulation phases (anxiety increasing during BDZ withdrawal). There were no group differences in agoraphobic symptoms and no evidence that the outcome of the behavior therapy was significantly affected by concurrent BDZ treatment. There were significant improvements in agoraphobic symptoms over the treatment period, with no evidence for relapse of treatment gains on withdrawal from BDZ, nor for differential responses over the one year follow-up. Initial differences between users and non-users were less marked than expected, although there was a trend for more drop-outs among users across both ED and EP groups.", 
    "78": "Immunodeficiency is frequently invoked as an ethiopathogenetic factor for many somatic diseases. On the other hand, stress, depression, and psychotic disturbances are associated with severe immunological disorders. Taking into account that the benzodiazepines (BZ) are the psychoactive drugs more widely used than any other to treat psychological disturbances, it seems important to elucidate the immuno-enhancing or immunosuppressant potential of such drugs. Our goal was easily reached, since 69% of the outpatients visiting our Institute are chronic BZ consumers and because neurochemical, hormonal, immunological, and psychiatric investigations are routinely performed on all of our patients. In the present study, immune function was investigated on two occasions: while the patient was on active medication and 15 days after discontinuation. We concluded that chronic consumption of BZ provokes significant immunological disorders that should be further investigated. Said disorders could not be linked to a pre-existing affective disease or psychosis, since we only selected those BZ users in whom psychiatric investigations ruled out a past or present history of major psychiatric disease.", 
    "79": "Four non-selective 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists, mianserin (2-8 mg/kg), 1-naphthyl piperazine (1-NP) (0.5-1 mg/kg), ICI 169,369 (20 mg/kg) and LY 53857 (5 mg/kg), increased punished responding for a food reward in the rat Geller-Seifter test 30 min after subcutaneous (SC) administration. This property was shared by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg SC). However, the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists ketanserin (0.2-1 mg/kg SC) and altanserin (0.5, 1 mg/kg SC) had little effect. The 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists pindolol and cyanopindolol (6 mg/kg SC) did not affect punished responding either, nor did the 5-HT1D receptor partial agonist and alpha 2 adrenergic receptor antagonist yohimbine (2.5 mg/kg SC) or the histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 mg/kg SC). Unpunished responding was also modestly increased after some doses of the 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists. However, this effect was inconsistent and was also seen after chlordiazepoxide. Furthermore, it was not associated with the increase in punished responding observed in rats orally treated with mianserin (10, 20 mg/kg), 1-NP (10, 20 mg/kg) or ICI 169,369 (50 mg/kg). The action of the 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists tested is therefore consistent with anxiolysis. The results also strongly suggest that this effect is mediated by blockade of the 5-HT2C receptor, although the possibility of 5-HT2B receptor mediation is discussed.", 
    "80": "Dose-dependent effects of intravenously administered lorazepam on haemodynamic fluctuations were studied by means of spectral analysis, in order to elucidate sympathetic and parasympathetic components in cardiovascular control during situations of rest and mental stress after benzodiazepine administration. In a double-blind randomized cross-over study, nine male volunteers participated in two sessions: a placebo and lorazepam session. During these sessions, the subjects repeatedly performed a 10-min version of the Stroop Color Word Test (CWT), with 10 min of rest between the CWTs. Lorazepam was administered before each rest period in increasing doses of 0.0, 0.06, 0.13, 0.25 and 0.5 mg (total cumulative dose: 0.94 mg). During the placebo session the subjects received five placebo injections. For five of the nine subjects the lorazepam session was their first session. Heat rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and respiration were recorded continuously. Power spectra were calculated per 2.5-min periods for HR, systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP). Spectral density was assessed for three frequency bands: low (LFB: 0.02-0.06 Hz), mid (MFB: 0.07-0.14 Hz) and high (HFB: 0.15-0.40 Hz). During the consecutive periods of rest, lorazepam induced a dose-dependent decrease in HR, and a dose-dependent increase in LFB, MFB and HFB power of HR, but lorazepam had no effect on BP. The effects were significant after 0.44 mg lorazepam for HR and HFB power, and after 0.94 mg lorazepam for the HR fluctuations in the LFB and MFB. Lorazepam did not influence the cardiovascular responses to the CWT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "81": "The effects of four serotonin (5-HT)-1A compounds (buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone and zalospirone) were compared with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) [a 5-HT precursor with antidepressant (AD) efficacy], and diazepam (a benzodiazepine anxiolytic), on a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-s (DRL 72-s) schedule. Past research has shown that AD and anxiolytic compounds each have distinct effects on the DRL 72-s interresponse time (IRT) distribution profile. In the present paper, the profile of the IRT distribution was quantitatively characterized by three metrics: burst ratio, peak location and peak area. 5-HTP shifted the IRT distribution peak toward longer IRT durations, increased reinforcement rate and decreased response rate. The profile of the IRT distribution was not disrupted by 5-HTP. Diazepam disrupted the IRT distribution and increased bursting. In general, the arylpiperazine, 5-HT1A compounds increased reinforcement rate, decreased response rate and disrupted the profile of the IRT distribution. The effects of the four arylpiperazine 5-HT1A compounds on the IRT distribution profile were different from the AD profile of 5-HTP and the benzodiazepine anxiolytic profile of diazepam. Disruption of the IRT distribution by buspirone, gepirone, ipsapirone and zalospirone may result from decreased 5-HT transmission mediated by the presynaptic, somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptor.", 
    "82": "This study was designed to test whether or not flumazenil (1 mg IV) would change levels of anxiety induced by simulation of public speaking (PSS). Forty normal volunteers were randomly allocated in a parallel groups design to treatment with flumazenil or placebo (double-blind) and one of two stress conditions (PSS/control task). PSS increased anxiety and flumazenil antagonized this effect. The anxiolytic activity of flumazenil was particularly strong on anticipatory anxiety measures. The results were discussed in terms of the involvement of endogenous benzodiazepine-type ligands in the regulation of the human response to stress.", 
    "83": "The efficacy and the tolerance of milnacipran (100 mg/day), a second generation antidepressant which equipotently inhibits both noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake, was compared to fluoxetine (20 mg/day), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in two parallel groups of, respectively, 97 and 93 major depressive outpatients. The duration of the study was 6 weeks, with assessments every 2 weeks by means of the Montgomery and Asberg depression scale (MADRS), the Hamilton depression scale, the clinical global impressions (CGI), and a checklist of symptoms and side-effects. Results showed significant superiority of fluoxetine over milnacipran on most rating instruments: MADRS (P = 0.01) including five individual items, Hamilton depression scale (P = 0.002) including ten individual items, CGI of severity (P = 0.01) and therapeutical index (P = 0.002). On visual analogue scales assessing the clinical profile of the compounds, fluoxetine was rated as exhibiting more psychostimulating activity than milnacipran (P = 0.0008). The tolerance of the two antidepressants was very similar, with the exception of symptoms of dizziness which were more frequently reported with milnacipran (P = 0.01). These differences in efficacy favoring fluoxetine could result from the selection of a dose of milnacipran below the optimal therapeutic dose for this type of psychiatric patients or to the administration of the compounds in single daily intakes, whereas milnacipran possesses a plasma elimination half-life of only 7 h.", 
    "84": "The aim of the present study was to determine whether in a task with stimuli inducing frequent saccadic eye movements, ingestion of oxazepam impairs performance more than in a task in which the stimuli remained fixed at the same location, due to effects of oxazepam on the ocular system. Eighteen males performed a vigilance task with static and dynamic stimuli under the influence of oxazepam (20 and 40 mg) in a placebo-controlled, double blind, crossover design. Oxazepam (40 mg) had a larger effect on vigilance performance in the first part of the dynamic task, relative to its static counterpart. Oxazepam also had an effect on oculomotor behavior, but this effect was unrelated to impaired performance. There were dose-dependent effects of oxazepam on absolute, overall level of performance but not on the decrement with time. The non-dose-dependent aggravation of the decrement in correct detections, caused by the drug, could only partly be accounted for by pharmacokinetics and increased eyelid closures, and was also caused by pharmacodynamic effects of the drug, such as those on attention. Different effects were noted for the two signal detection measures of response behavior, B\" and RI.", 
    "85": "It has proven difficult to demonstrate and study the \"anxiogenic\" quality of drug withdrawal states in animals. Ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) in response to acoustic startle stimuli have shown promise as a measure of affect and may represent \"distress\" responses during diazepam withdrawal. Three experiments evaluated the association between USV and \"distress\" by comparing the effects of diazepam as a prototypic benzodiazepine agonist and the putative anxiolytic gepirone with affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptors in naive and diazepam-withdrawn subjects. Adult male Long-Evans rats were exposed to acoustic startle sessions consisting of nine 105 dB and nine 115 dB stimuli. USV at 20-30 kHz were readily emitted during startle and often commenced after the third or fourth stimulus presentation. Acutely, intraperitoneal (IP) administration of diazepam (0.1-3 mg/kg) and gepirone (0.1-1 mg/kg) decreased USV dose-dependently without affecting the startle reflex; gepirone also decreased tail flick latency. Startle-induced USV were also sensitive to the \"anxiogenic\" effects of withdrawal from diazepam exposure (0, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg b.i.d. IP x 5 days). Twenty-four hours after the last diazepam injection, rats were hyperreactive to startle stimuli and doubled their rate of USV over vehicle-treated controls. Gepirone (0.1-1 mg/kg IP), but not diazepam (3-20 mg/kg IP) antagonized the increased rate of USV in rats withdrawn from 10 mg/kg b.i.d. diazepam. Diazepam (2.5-10 mg/kg IP) antagonized the increased rate of USV in rats withdrawn from 2.5 mg/kg b.i.d. diazepam.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "86": "Cholinergic and serotonergic receptors of Aplysia californica buccal muscles were characterized pharmacologically by determining compounds that effectively inhibited contractile responses to acetylcholine (ACh) and modulatory effects of serotonin (5-HT), respectively. pA50 for ACh to elicit contraction averaged 4.7 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- SE, equivalent to 2 x 10(-5) M). Both hexamethonium bromide and atropine inhibited ACh-elicited contractions, but neither inhibited the response completely, nor were the two together able to antagonize the response completely. Curare caused inhibition only at low ACh doses, and muscarinic antagonists pirenzapine and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide caused partial inhibition. The most effective blocker of ACh-elicited contractions was the nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine. 10(-4) M mecamylamine completely blocked the cholinergic response. ACh contractions were inhibited 90% within 10 min and took > 40 min to recover from mecamylamine. Specificity was indicated by the lack of effect of mecamylamine on potassium-elicited contraction. NAN-190 blocked the potentiating effect of 5-HT without having inhibitory or potentiating effects by itself on ACh-elicited contractions. NAN-190 blocked the potentiating effect of 8-OH-DPAT. Cholinergic receptors on Aplysia buccal muscles are most effectively inhibited by mecamylamine and may have mixed nicotinic/muscarinic character. Serotonergic receptors have pharmacological similarities to vertebrate 5-HT1A receptors and may be closely related to the gastropod 5-HTlym receptor.", 
    "87": "Combinations of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Tat protein antagonist Ro 24-7429 with either the HIV protease inhibitor Ro 31-8959 or the HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors AZT (3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine), ddC (2',3'-dideoxycytidine), ddI (2',3'-dideoxyinosine), and nevirapine were synergistic or additive in reducing HIV type 1 p24 antigen production in CEM cells or inhibiting HIV type 1-induced syncytium formation in HT4-6C cells.", 
    "88": "Human muscarinic receptors comprise a family of five separate gene products, three of which (designated as M1, M2 and M3 subtypes) can be distinguished pharmacologically. Previous work indicates that sympathetic nerve terminals in the anterior uvea contain prejunctional muscarinic receptors that, upon activation by agonists, inhibit the neural release of norepinephrine. The aim of this study was to characterize the prejunctional effects of muscarinic agents on the electrically-evoked secretion of 3H-norepinephrine in isolated, superfused human iris-ciliary body tissue segments. Stimulation-evoked 3H-norepinephrine release was inhibited > 80% by carbachol and muscarine, but was unaffected by the M1-selective agonist McN A-343. Pilocarpine behaved as a partial agonist in this system, producing less than 40% of the maximum inhibition. The rank order of potency of selective antagonists at prejunctional muscarinic receptors was methoctramine (M2) > AF-DX 116 (M2) > pirenzepine (M1) > or = para-fluoro hexahydro-sila-definidol (M3). These data suggest that prejunctional muscarinic receptors in the human iris-ciliary body correspond to the M2 subtype. No evidence for age-related differences in prejunctional muscarinic receptor activity was seen in tissues obtained from 13 human donors, aged 10-83 years. Prejunctional muscarinic receptors may play a role in mediating the inhibitory effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation or cholinomimetic drugs on ocular sympathetic neurotransmission in vivo.", 
    "89": "Alprazolam administered for 43 days in doses of 6 to 10 mg/day had an antidepressant effect in four of nine depressed patients. Decreases in slow wave sleep, increases in rapid eye movement (REM) latency, and decreases in REM minutes and percent and REM sleep eye movements were found in the group as a whole. The drug had a general hypnotic effect with a trend toward increased total sleep time. Nonsignificant changes in the concentrations of 3-methyl-4-hydroxyphenylglycol and homovanillic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were qualitatively similar to those found after treatment with tricyclic antidepressant drugs; however, only the larger decreases in CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid achieved statistical significance. Baseline sleep and CSF metabolites and changes in these measures on drug did not predict the therapeutic effects of alprazolam.", 
    "90": "The amino-terminal extracellular domain of the subunits comprising the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor contains two cysteine residues (designated at relative positions 1 and 15) separated by 13 amino acids. These two cysteines (presumably disulfide bonded) are located approximately 150 amino acids from the amino terminus. There is significant homology in the amino acid sequence of this cysteine loop both between the different subunits of the GABA receptor and with subunits of other members of this ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (nicotinic acetylcholine- and glycine-activated ion channels). A number of highly conserved amino acids within the cysteine loop have been postulated to play a role in agonist binding. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis and oocyte expression, we have examined the effects of mutating amino acids comprising the cysteine loop on the activation of recombinant GABA channels composed of rat alpha 1, beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits. Preventing the formation of the putative cysteine-cysteine disulfide bond in any of the subunits, by mutating the cysteine at position 15 to serine, prevented the functional expression of that subunit. For example, coexpression of gamma C15S with wild-type alpha and beta subunits resulted in GABA-activated currents with properties identical to those of GABA-activated currents from coexpression of alpha and beta subunits alone. These properties included sensitivity to activation by GABA (similar EC50 values), blockade by Zn2+, and lack of modulation by the benzodiazepine diazepam. We also mutated conserved amino acids in the beta subunit that had been specifically proposed to form the GABA binding site (beta R6, beta Y8, and beta D11). These mutations (as well as several others within or adjacent to the cysteine loop) produced either a very moderate effect or no effect on GABA sensitivity, suggesting that these particular amino acids do not play a key role in activation of the GABA channel. The data presented in this study support a role for the cysteine loop in subunit assembly, rather than channel activation.", 
    "91": "The pharmacological profile of FK480[(S)-(+)-N-<1-(2)-fluorophenyl)-3,4,6,7-tetra hydro-4-oxo-pyrrolo(3,2,1-jk) (1,4)benzodiaze-pine-3-yl>-1H-indole-2- carboxamide], a novel cholecystokinin type-A (CCK-A) receptor antagonist, was compared with that of the CCK-A receptor antagonist, loxiglumide. Both FK480 and loxiglumide inhibited 125I-labeled CCK-8 (125I-CCK-8) binding to rat pancreatic and guinea-pig gallbladder membranes with IC50 values of 0.40 +/- 0.04 and 0.06 +/- 0.02 nM for FK480 and 330 +/- 66 and 66 +/- 10 nM for loxiglumide, respectively. These two agents also inhibited 125I-CCK-8 binding to guinea-pig brain (cerebral cortex) receptors with respective IC50 values of 72 +/- 11 nM and > 10 microM, indicating less affinity to central receptors. Intravenous administration of FK480 (ED50 = 18 micrograms/kg) was 2800 times more potent than that of loxiglumide (ED50 = 50 mg/kg) in inhibiting CCK-8-induced pancreatic amylase secretion in rats. Furthermore, FK480 had ED50 values of 10 and 8.4 micrograms/kg, respectively, in antagonizing CCK-8-induced inhibition of charcoal meal gastric emptying in mice when administered orally 1 or 5 hr before the CCK-8. Loxiglumide (ED50 = 23.5 mg/kg, when administered orally 1 hr before the CCK-8) also antagonized it, but its activity was 2400 times less than that of FK480. We conclude that FK480 is a potent, orally effective CCK-A receptor antagonist with long duration of action.", 
    "92": "The reverse transcriptase (RT) of equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) shares sequence similarity with the RTs of other lentiviruses, particularly with the RTs of human immunodeficiency viruses types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2, respectively), the causative agents of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). There is a 41-42% sequence identity between EIAV RT and both HIV RTs (which have 61% sequence identity to each other). We have compared the enzymic properties of EIAV RT with those of HIV-1 RT. Several aspects of the activities of EIAV RT differ from the corresponding activities of HIV-1 RT. There are significant differences in the inhibition of the DNA polymerase activities by the deoxynucleoside triphosphate analogs, 3'-azido-2,3'-dideoxythymidine triphosphate, dideoxyTTP and dideoxyGTP and by the nonnucleoside inhibitor, tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk-1,4]benzodiazepin-2-(1H)-one and thione; in the dependence of DNA polymerase and RNase H activities on pH; in the inhibition of the DNA polymerase activities by the thiol-specific reagent N-ethylmaleimide; in the specific DNA polymerase activity; in the inhibition of the ribonuclease H activity by the zinc chelator orthophenanthroline. However, there are several cases in which EIAV RT and HIV-1 RT are more similar than was previously found for HIV-1 RT and HIV-2 RT. These include the Km values for the DNA polymerase activities, the heat stability of the DNA polymerase functions and the specific activity of the RNase H function.", 
    "93": "Behavioral and electrophysiological studies suggest that neurons in the medial septum may express ethanol sensitive GABAA receptors. In the present study, patch-clamp recordings of whole-cell currents were used to directly characterize the ethanol sensitivity of GABAA receptors on acutely dissociated neurons, isolated from the medial septum/nucleus of the diagonal band (MS/nDB) of the adult rat brains. MS/nDB neurons displayed inward currents in response to GABA applied rapidly with a large-bore dual pipette system. The currents were mediated by the activation of GABAA receptors, since they reversed near the calculated reversal potential for chloride and were completely blocked by bicuculline. GABA responses were concentration dependent with an EC50 of 8.7 microM GABA and a slope of 1.35 suggesting cooperativity. Pharmacologically relevant concentrations of ethanol (3-300 mM) neither significantly increased nor decreased mean responses to GABA in neurons from Sprague Dawley or High Alcohol Sensitivity (HAS) rats. Mean GABA currents were significantly increased by 300 mM ethanol in neurons from 'ethanol sensitive' Fischer 344, ACI and Wistar Kyoto inbred rats. In subsets of neurons, 12.5 to 57.1% of those tested from these 5 rats strains, ethanol (30-300 mM) significantly increased GABA currents by > or = 20%. An additional, 10 percent of cells from Sprague Dawley rats showed ethanol-induced inhibition of GABA-activated current by < or = 20%. Allosteric modulators pentobarbital (10 microM), midazolam (1 microM) and lanthanum (300 microM), enhanced, while zinc (30 microM) decreased GABA-activated currents in all neurons, consistent with the well-known actions of these agents. These results suggest that GABAA receptors on MS/dDB neurons are pharmacologically similar to those on other neurons with respect to regulation by allosteric modulators. On the other hand, ethanol sensitivity of GABAA receptors varies considerably from cell to cell ranging from significant enhancement to inhibition of GABA-activated current.", 
    "94": "GABAA receptors have been solubilized from bovine brain membranes and, following purification by benzodiazepine affinity chromatography, have been reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. Reconstituted vesicles were about 120 nm in diameter, and, on average, each vesicle contained fewer than one GABAA receptor which was reconstituted in an outside-out orientation. These preparations have been used in parallel studies of radiolabeled ligand binding and chloride flux, the latter being measured by following the fluorescence changes of a chloride-sensitive probe which was trapped within the vesicles at the time of reconstitution. The benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam binds to an apparently homogeneous population of sites in these preparations (Kd of 5 nM) whereas the GABA analogue [3H]muscimol binds to both high- and low-affinity sites (KdS of 10 nM and 0.27 microM). Muscimol stimulated chloride flux with an EC50 of 0.2 microM and, at similar concentrations (EC50 = 0.16 microM), potentiated [3H]flunitrazepam binding, suggesting that occupancy of the low-affinity sites may be important for these effects. Diazepam shifted the dose-response curve for muscimol-stimulated flux to about 4-fold lower concentrations without affecting the maximum response. Diazepam did not, however, alter the equilibrium binding of [3H]muscimol. The purified receptor showed densensitization since flux responses were abolished by prior exposure to muscimol. The competitive antagonist bicuculline and the channel blocker picrotoxin completely inhibited ion flux mediated by 3 microM muscimol with EC50 values of 5.3 and 2.5 microM, respectively. These results are discussed in terms of possible mechanisms for activation, inhibition, and modulation of GABAA receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "95": "Clinical course and results of therapy were analysed in the group of 92 children, aged between 3 and 9 years, with diagnosed Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. The obtained results of an analysis have shown that Lennox-Gastaut syndrome origin is not clear--causative factor can not be established in 1/3 of patients whereas in 1/2 of them abnormal course of pregnancy and perinatal period is noted. Together with seizures of various origin, other focal neurological symptoms, mental retardation and abnormalities in CT scans of the brain are frequently seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Clinical course, prognosis and results of therapy are largely dependent on the degree of mental development before the onset of epileptic seizures, course of pregnancy and perinatal period, and the time of therapy. Children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome require relative polytherapy in which valproic acid derivatives are predominating together with benzodiazepines, and temporary corticosteroids. An improvement was achieved in about 30% of the treated children. Prognosis in the remaining 70% of children is rather poor. Irregular administration of drugs, frequent changes of anti-epileptic agents, too low doses and abnormal environmental effects (abnormal parental attitudes) affect the results of therapy. An emphasis is on the poor prognosis in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome proceeded with West syndrome.", 
    "96": "The gamma aminobutyric acidA/benzodiazepine (GABAA/BZ) receptor is a multisubunit (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and rho) ligand-gated chloride channel; there are several variants of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits, each of which has been localized throughout the central nervous system. A large number of GABAA/BZ subunit variants are expressed within the cerebellar cortex. In previous studies from other laboratories, alpha 6 subunit mRNA has been reported to be present exclusively in cerebellar granule cells. The developmental expression of alpha 6 mRNA in cerebellar and cochlear granule cells is of interest because it has been suggested that each of these cell types is derived from a common precursor pool. The polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a cDNA fragment encoding a portion of the M3-M4 intracellular loop of the alpha 6 subunit of the GABAA/BZ receptor. A [35S] riboprobe, transcribed from this cDNA fragment, was used to examine the expression of the alpha 6 subunit mRNA by in situ hybridization in developing normal mice and in adult mutant mice with known deficits in synaptic circuitry. A strong hybridization signal was observed over the granule cell layers of both the cerebellum and cochlear nuclei in adult mice. The signal over the cochlear nuclei appeared after birth toward the end of postnatal week 1, coinciding with the appearance of labeling in the cerebellar cortex. The intensity of the hybridization signal in both regions increased rapidly until postnatal day 14, after which it increased more gradually, reaching adult levels during postnatal week 3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "97": "The biotransformation of taxol by human liver was investigated in vitro with microsomes isolated from adult and developing human tissues. In vitro, no metabolism was detected with kidney microsomes, whereas two metabolites were generated by liver microsomes. The most prominent metabolite, termed M5, corresponded to an hydroxylation at the C6 position on the taxane ring, while the other metabolite, termed M4, corresponded to an hydroxylation at the para-position on the phenyl ring at the C3'-position of the C13 side chain. These two taxol derivatives have been shown to be the major metabolites recovered in bile from a patient infused with taxol. Several approaches have been used to identify the cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes involved in these reactions. No positive correlation was observed between the in vitro synthesis of these two metabolites, suggesting that two cytochrome P450 isozymes could be involved, although they could not be distinguished by their apparent affinities (Km approximately 15 microM). The formation of metabolite M4 was substantially reduced both by antibody directed against CYP3A and by the addition of CYP3A substrates such as orphenadrine, erythromycin, troleandomycin, and testosterone. Conversely, the formation of metabolite M5 remained unaffected by antibodies against CYP3A and by CYP3A substrates but was sensitive to diazepam inhibition, a preferential substrate of CYP2C. Correlation between CYP2C content or diazepam demethylation and the synthesis of metabolite M5 was highly positive. The formation of metabolite M4 developed during the early postnatal period. In contrast, the synthesis of metabolite M5 rose only after 3 months of age. These data clearly implicate CYP3A in the formation of metabolite M4 and CYP2C in the synthesis of metabolite M5. Microsomes from patients treated with barbiturates and benzodiazepines increased the formation of metabolite M4 to the level of metabolite M5, demonstrating that drug interactions could modify the human metabolism of taxol.", 
    "98": "The impermeant SH-cleavable reagent, 125I-labeled 3,3'-dithiopropionyl 1-sulfosuccinimidyl 1'-glycyltyrosine (DPSgt) and specific immunoprecipitation were used to quantitate gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor polypeptides with domains exposed on the surface of chick cortical neurons. The 125I label incorporated into 50- and 53-kDa receptor subunits was completely removed by washing the cells with glutathione (GSH) buffer. A single dose of 100 microns GABA or GABA agonist was added to the neurons, and after 5 days in culture the cells were washed and labeled with 125I-DPSgt. This treatment with GABA or isoguvacine reduced the level of the receptor 125I-labeled subunits by 50-60%, while the reduction by 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-3-ol was less than 17%. The subunit down-regulation by agonist was prevented by the GABAA antagonist 3 alpha-hydroxy-16-imino-5 beta-17-aza-androstan-11-one (R5135). Direct iodination of membranes isolated from treated cells revealed a similar loss of subunits, indicating that the down-regulated polypeptides are not retained intracellularly. Furthermore, the level of intracellular [3H]flunitrazepam binding (per mg of protein) did not change significantly during chronic GABA treatment, while the fraction of intracellular binding rose from 7% to 15% of the total, owing to a decline in surface binding. The fate of the surface subunits during acute agonist exposure was examined by labeling intact neurons with 125I-DPSgt at 0 degrees C, incubating with GABA for 2-4 h at 37 degrees C and then washing with GSH buffer. Of the 50-53-kDa receptor peptides originally on the surface, 16 +/- 2% became protected from GSH during the 2-h GABA treatment. This sequestration was not found in cells incubated without GABA, with GABA + R5135, or with GABA at 0 degree C. A consistently lower level of sequestered subunits was recovered after a 4- versus 2-h GABA treatment at 37 degrees C, suggesting polypeptide degradation. Overall, the results indicate that GABAA receptor sequestration and subsequent degradation play an important role in agonist-dependent down-regulation.", 
    "99": "The present study examines the effects of pre and/or early postnatal administration of diazepam on the mitral cell and on the light and dark granule cell populations in the sexually dimorphic accessory olfactory bulb of the rat. Quantitative differences related to sex were observed in the numbers of the three types of neurons, with vehicle males showing greater numbers of cells than vehicle females. The number of mitral cells in males decreased to the levels shown by female rats following prenatal and pre-postnatal diazepam treatments, whereas the DZ treatments did not affect the females. In addition, the diazepam administration during the prenatal, postnatal and pre-postnatal periods decreased the numbers of both light and dark granule cells in males, while these two granule cell subpopulations were not affected in diazepam treated females. These results indicate that perinatal administration of diazepam can alter the sexual dimorphism in the accessory olfactory bulb and that the GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complex is involved in the sexual differentiation this part of the brain.", 
    "100": "Selected examples from three series of isomeric (alkylthio)-1,2,4-triazoles were prepared and examined for anticonvulsant activity versus strychnine-, maximal-electroshock-, pentylenetetrazole-, and 3-mercaptopropionic-acid-induced seizures in mice. A number of 5-aryl-3-(alkylthio)-4H-1,2,4-triazoles were selective antagonists of strychnine-induced convulsions. The isomeric 3-aryl-5-(alkylthio)- and 5-aryl-3-(alkylthio)-1H-1,2,4-triazoles were essentially inactive as anticonvulsants. The most potent antagonist of strychnine-induced convulsions was 5-(2-fluorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(methylthio)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (3s), while the most selective antagonist was 5-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (3aa). The anticonvulsant profiles of these 4H-1,2,4-triazoles suggested that they were acting functionally like glycine receptor agonists. Since it has recently been postulated that compounds possessing glycine-agonist-like properties might be useful in the treatment of spasticity, we examined 5-phenyl-4-methyl-3-(methylsulfonyl)-4H-1,2,4-triazole (3c) in an in vivo model of spasticity. In this regard, 3c reduced the occurrence of hyperreflexia in rats that had received spinal transections 5-10 weeks previously. While triazole 3c appeared to possess glycine-agonist-like properties in vivo, it did not displace [3H]strychnine binding from rat brain stem/spinal cord membranes in vitro. On the other hand, 3c enhanced muscimol-stimulated 36Cl influx in a rat cerebellar membrane preparation, indicating a possible interaction of these triazoles with the GABAA receptor."
