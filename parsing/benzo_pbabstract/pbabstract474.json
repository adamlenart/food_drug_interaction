Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, fentanyl and pancuronium, and maintained with midazolam as a continuous infusion, fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide in oxygen or oxygen in air. The concentration of midazolam in the blood of 10 patients was about 300 ng/litre during two measurements; the patients' lungs were ventilated with N2O in oxygen. The concentration of midazolam in the blood of another 10 patients was doubled to about 600 ng/litre during the second flow measurement; the patients' lungs were ventilated with N2O/O2. The concentration of midazolam in the blood of the third group of 10 patients was doubled to 600 ng/litre during the second flow measurement; the patients' lungs were ventilated with oxygen in air. No relationship was found between the dose of midazolam and cerebral blood flow or oxygen consumption. Nitrous oxide in combination with midazolam also had no effect on these variables.", 
    "1": "An 8-yr-old boy suffering from an asymptomatic ventricular septal defect was given erythromycin for antibiotic prophylaxis before adenoidectomy. Sixty minutes after premedication with oral midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1 and oral atropine 0.03 mg kg-1, an infusion of erythromycin 400 mg was started. When 200 mg of erythromycin had been infused, the patient lost consciousness, but other vital functions remained normal. After 45 min, he awakened spontaneously. At the time the plasma concentration of midazolam was 134 ng ml-1. In order to investigate possible interactions between midazolam and erythromycin, we studied the pharmacokinetics of midazolam in six children of the same age undergoing minor otolaryngological surgery. The plasma concentration of midazolam in the patient who lost consciousness was significantly greater than in six other children without concomitant administration of erythromycin. The altered pharmacokinetics of midazolam may result from reduced hepatic clearance of midazolam caused by an enzyme inhibiting drug, erythromycin.", 
    "2": "Nicotine poisoning is a rarely reported toxicosis. The clinical signs and symptoms are complex and are mostly of central nervous system derangement. In addition, animals may have hypersalivation, vomiting, diarrhea, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypertension and hyperthermia. Some animals are presented in total collapse with slow and shallow respirations, hypotension, dilated pupils, and a weak, rapid and irregular pulse. Treatment is directed toward removing the unabsorbed poison and diluting, and counteracting or controlling the animal's signs. This report emphasises the comparative ease with which a dog would readily ingest chewing tobacco, which is sweet in taste, and come down with nicotine poisoning, as compared to cigarette tobacco which is nonpalatable and therefore less of a threat. The report further discusses clinical nicotine toxicosis, its incidence, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment.", 
    "3": "Zolpidem, which is currently marketed in Europe as a hypnotic, is a short-duration imidazopyridine whose actions are mediated at the gamma-aminobutyric acid benzodiazepine receptor complex. However, zolpidem produces a variety of biochemical differences from classic benzodiazepine agonists including showing selectivity for the central BZ1 (omega 1) receptor subtype as well as showing a different pattern of distribution of binding sites. This study compared zolpidem to the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam in 15 healthy male volunteers with histories of sedative drug abuse. Placebo, zolpidem (15, 30 and 45 mg) and triazolam (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75 mg) were administered p.o. in a mixed sequence in a double-blind, cross-over design. The onset time with zolpidem was faster than with triazolam, with peak effects of both drugs occurring at 1 to 2 hr after administration. Both zolpidem and triazolam produced dose-related decrements in performance on various performance tasks including circular lights, reaction time, balance, number recall and the digit symbol substitution test. Both drugs also produced similar dose-related changes on various observer ratings including overall strength of drug effect. Triazolam, but not zolpidem, increased subject- and observer-rated sleepiness and produced greater impairment on a picture memory task. Zolpidem, but not triazolam, produced increases in subject ratings of various somatic symptoms (e.g., dizzy, anxious and queasy) and there were 9 days on which subjects vomited after zolpidem, but none after triazolam. Although the highest dose of both drugs was identified by subjects as being active, the highest dose of triazolam was identified as being barbiturate, benzodiazepine or alcohol, almost twice as often as the highest dose of zolpidem. Overall, this study shows that although zolpidem produces many effects in common with triazolam, it also has a unique profile of effects distinguishable from classic benzodiazepine agonists. The mechanism(s) underlying these differences is unclear, but may be related to the atypical biochemical profile of zolpidem.", 
    "4": "The effects of the cholecystokinin antagonist devazepide on analgesia and respiratory depression induced by morphine in squirrel monkeys were examined. Pain thresholds were determined using the tail withdrawal procedure, in which monkeys restrained in chairs kept their tails in cool (35 degrees C) water for at least 20 sec, but withdrew them from warm (55 degrees C) water in less than 4 sec. Morphine produced a dose-related increase in tail withdrawal latencies from warm water. Devazepide (injected i.p. or p.o.) had no effect on tail withdrawal latencies when given alone but enhanced the analgesic effects of morphine. The devazepide dose-response curve for morphine enhancement was bell-shaped with doses of 3, 10, 30 and 100 micrograms/kg injected i.p. increasing morphine analgesia whereas higher and lower dose did not. In a separate group of monkeys, morphine produced dose-dependent decreases in respiratory rate and oxygen tension and increases in carbon dioxide tension. In contrast to its effects on morphine analgesia, devazepide had no effect on the various indices of morphine-induced respiratory depression. These data suggest that devazepide may have therapeutic utility as an adjuvant to morphine analgesia allowing lower dose of the opiate to be used to relieve pain and reducing the risk of opiate-induced respiratory depression.", 
    "5": "The distribution of subtypes of the muscarinic receptor in homogenates of the rat brain was investigated by measuring the competitive inhibition of the binding [3H]N-methylscopolamine by pirenzepine and AF-DX 116 (11[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one). In most brain regions, the competitive binding curves for AF-DX 116 and pirenzepine were consistent with a two-site model. The dissociation constant of pirenzepine for its high-affinity site (M1 receptor) was approximately 10(-8) M, whereas the dissociation constant of AF-DX 116 for its high affinity site (M2 receptor) was approximately 10(-7) M. In many regions, particularly those in the forebrain, the sum of the densities of the M1 and M2 binding sites was substantially less than 100% of the total sites, indicating the existence of a third population of sites lacking high affinity for both pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. We have designated these latter sites as non-M1, non-M2 muscarinic receptors. In general, the densities of the M1 and non-M1, non-M2 binding sites were highest in cerebral cortex, corpus striatum and hippocampus, intermediate in thalamus and hypothalamus, and lowest in midbrain, medulla-pons and cerebellum, whereas the M2 binding site had a relatively low, uniform density throughout the brain. The binding capacity of [3H]N-methylquinuclidinyl benzilate was estimated to be 20 to 30% lower than that of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate in various regions of the forebrain, but not in more caudal regions of the brain where the two radioligands had approximately the same binding capacities. Treatment of homogenates of the cerebral cortex with benzilylcholine mustard caused a selective loss of the majority of the [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding sites but spared 25% of the sites labeled by [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate The results of pirenzepine/[3H]quinuclinyl benzilate competitive binding experiments on cerebral cortex treated with benzilylcholine mustard showed that the residual binding sites for [3H] quinuclidinyl benzilate were enriched in M1 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "6": "The role of the central noradrenergic systems and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in modulating defensive withdrawal behavior was studied in rats. The apparatus consisted of a small chamber set on one side of a one-meter open field, into which the rat was placed to start the test. When rats were unfamiliar with the apparatus, they displayed species typical defensive withdrawal behavior with long latencies to emerge from and a high proportion of time spent in the small chamber. Intraperitoneal administration of clonidine (0.03 mg/kg), l-propranolol (2.5 micrograms/kg), prazosin (0.1 mg/kg) or chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 5 mg/kg) each significantly decreased the latency to emerge from and the mean time spent in the small chamber (MTIC) and increased the number of chamber entries. When rats were familiar with the apparatus, prior restraint for 20 min significantly increased the latency and MTIC, and decreased the number of chamber entries and rears, but did not alter locomotor activity. Prazosin, clonidine, CDP, l-propranolol and the CRF-antagonist, alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 micrograms i.c.v.), reversed the restraint-induced increase in the latency and MTIC. CRF (10-100 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior in rats familiar with the apparatus; the minimum statistically significant dose was 50 ng. dl-Propranolol (5 mg/kg) and CDP blocked the CRF-induced changes in the latency to emerge and the MTIC; whereas clonidine and prazosin significantly reduced the latency, but had no statistically significant effects on the MTIC. Phenylephrine (25-200 ng i.c.v.) dose-dependently induced defensive withdrawal behavior. This effect of phenylephrine (200 ng) was significantly antagonized by prazosin or alpha-helical CRF9-41 (25 or 50 mg i.c.v.), but not by CDP. Our results suggest that the hyperactivity of the central noradrenergic systems caused by exposure to the novel environment may stimulate the release of CRF, which through some unknown mechanism induces defensive withdrawal behavior in rats. Activation of beta adrenergic receptors may also induce defensive withdrawal.", 
    "7": "A series of optically pure 2-[substituted-3-aminopropynyl]pyrrolidine derivatives, which are restricted-rotation analogues of the muscarinic agent N-methyl-N-(1-methyl-4-pyrrolidino-2-butynyl)acetamide (BM-5, compound 1), have been prepared from d- and l-proline. The compounds when tested in a series of in vitro muscarinic assays [[3H]CD (cortex), [3H]QNB (cortex), [3H]PZ (cortex), [3H]QNB (heart), [3H]QNB + GppNHp (heart)] were found to have weaker muscarinic properties than compound 1. The decrease in affinity was attributed to the increased size of the molecule resulting from the addition of a methylene group to form the pyrrolidine ring. The use of optically active compounds provided a more detailed examination of the complex pharmacological effects of the flexible muscarinic agent 1. The R enantiomers in the acetamide derivatives 12b, 12d, and 12f had a 5-10-fold greater affinity for the muscarinic receptor than the corresponding S enantiomers. A 5-fold difference or less found in the (R)- and (S)-carbamate derivatives 9, 15, and 16 suggested close overlap of the two enantiomers in the receptor binding domain. The affinity differences found in the enantiomeric acetamido derivatives when compared to those of the carbamate analogues may be the result of limited rotation of the acetamido group.", 
    "8": "The lifelong nature of panic disorder and the development of effective new treatments have focused attention on long-term use of antipanic medications, particularly benzodiazepines and their possibly addictive nature. Benzodiazepines are generally safe and effective. An understanding of the distinction between chemical dependence and physical dependence places problems involved in the use and discontinuation of benzodiazepines into perspective. Patients with a dual diagnosis of panic disorder and chemical dependence are at risk of addiction. Others may develop physical dependence but are able to discontinue benzodiazepine treatment when panic symptoms subside. The approach to benzodiazepine use and discontinuation should be different for patients with chemical dependence as opposed to patients with physical dependence. A four-step approach to discontinuation that is applicable to both groups is offered.", 
    "9": "High-potency benzodiazepines such as clonazepam and alprazolam are effective and safe in the short-term treatment of panic disorder, but less is known about their effectiveness and safety over the long term. Further understanding of these issues is important since panic disorder is usually chronic and may call for long-term treatment. Available naturalistic data suggest that tolerance to the antipanic or antiphobic effects of clonazepam and alprazolam does not occur in panic disorder/agoraphobia; doses also tend to decrease over time. Withdrawal symptoms occur after short-term treatment with alprazolam, but less is known about clonazepam in this respect. Other issues discussed include management of withdrawal, clinical use of benzodiazepines, importance of comorbidity, and the use of benzodiazepines in association with behavior therapy.", 
    "10": "Clinical experience and controlled studies confirm the efficacy of pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral interventions for the acute treatment of panic disorder and agoraphobia. However, while some patients experience long periods of true remission, panic disorder remains chronic for many, with intermittent periods of acute exacerbation and continued residual distress. Findings from the Massachusetts General Hospital Naturalistic Study of the Longitudinal Course of Panic Disorder suggest that (1) a number of factors contribute to the severity and persistence of panic disorder, including phobic subtype, comorbid anxiety disorders, depression, personality disorders, and anxiety sensitivity; (2) chronicity is common; (3) for some, an anxiety diathesis is manifested early in childhood and sets the tone for later chronicity and comorbidity; (4) maladaptive personality characteristics may be manifestations of an underlying anxiety disorder; (5) patients with continued symptomatology despite improvement may benefit from the flexible integration of pharmacologic and cognitive-behavioral treatment approaches; and (6) long-term treatment is indicated for many patients.", 
    "11": "Five subtypes of muscarinic receptors have been distinguished by pharmacological and molecular biological methods. This report characterizes the muscarinic subtype present in human gastric mucosa by radioligand binding studies. The receptor density was 27 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein and the tritiated ligand N-methylscopolamine had an affinity of (KD) 0.39 +/- 0.08 nM (n = 11). The M1 receptor selective antagonist pirenzepine and the M2 receptor selective ligand AF-DX 116 had low affinities of 148 +/- 32 nM (n = 13) and 4043 +/- 1011 nM (n = 3) KD, respectively. The glandular M3 antagonists hexahydrosiladifenidol and silahexocyclium had high affinities of KD 78 +/- 23 nM (n = 5) and 5.6 +/- 1.8 nM (n = 3). The agonist carbachol interacted with a single low-affinity site and binding was insensitive to modulation by guanine nucleotides. Antagonist and agonist binding studies thus showed an affinity profile typical of M3 receptors of the glandular type.", 
    "12": "The long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics by the elderly is associated with serious side effects, and prescriptions of large quantities of these agents allow such use. Therefore, we determined the quantities of these agents prescribed to outpatients in our Veterans Administration teaching hospital, and the relationship of patient age to total number of doses prescribed per prescription.", 
    "13": "Pharmacy and patient records related to 655 consecutive prescriptions for triazolam (Halcion) and flurazepam (Dalmane) were reviewed. Only 266 (41%) of the prescriptions were for 30 or fewer doses, while 178 (27%) were written for 180 or more doses.", 
    "14": "Thirty-six percent of prescriptions for patients aged 65 years or older were for 180 or more doses, compared with 24% for those aged 45 to 64 years old, and 16% of the prescriptions for patients less than 45 years old (p less than 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis controlling for six other factors related to the total number of doses prescribed, patients aged 65 years or older were still more likely to receive a prescription for 180 or more doses (relative risk 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 2.8).", 
    "15": "We conclude that inappropriately large quantities of benzodiazepine hypnotics were commonly prescribed, and that patients aged 65 years or older were at greatest risk for receiving such prescriptions.", 
    "16": "We have carried out an extensive pharmacological characterization of muscarinic binding sites in rabbit lung and chicken heart in parallel with M1, M2, and M3 sites, [3H]Pirenzepine, a selective antagonist at M1 receptors, bound saturably and reversibly to membranes from chicken heart and rabbit lung. These binding sites were not M1 receptors, however, because the cardioselective antagonist himbacine had 10-fold higher affinity at these sites than at [3H]pirenzepine sites in rat and rabbit cortex (true M1 sites). We measured the inhibitory potency of 28 antagonists at [3H]N-methylscopolamine-labeled sites in chicken heart, rabbit lung, rat heart (M2 sites), and rat submandibular gland (M3 sites) and at M1 sites in rat cortex. The sites in rabbit lung were different from M1, M2, and M3 sites, because they had moderate to high affinity for M1-selective compounds (pirenzepine and telenzepine), M2-selective compounds (himbacine and methoctramine), and M3-selective compounds (hexahydrosiladifenidol and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide). The sites in chicken heart resembled most those in rabbit lung, with similar high affinity for secoverine, but they were not the same because tropicamide, diphenylacetoxybutynyl dimethylamine, and [3H]-N-methylscopolamine were more potent in rabbit lung. In a further series of experiments, we compared the affinity of six of the most discriminating antagonists in membranes from rabbit lung and NG108-15 cells, a neuroblastoma-glioma cell line reported to express the muscarinic m4 receptor gene. The antagonists had very similar affinities in the two tissues, the largest discrepancy being that pirenzepine was twice as potent in rabbit lung as in NG108-15 cells. Northern blots using probes designed to discriminate between five species of muscarinic receptor RNA detected only m4 mRNA in rabbit lung. We conclude that rabbit lung contains a muscarinic M4 binding site with a quite distinctive pharmacology and that chicken heart contains a receptor with similarities to the M4 sites. This is the first report to characterize native M4 binding sites in a nonneuronal mammalian tissue.", 
    "17": "The tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of adinazolam and N-desmethyladinazolam (NDMAD) were assessed after single oral doses of 10, 30, and 50 mg adinazolam mesylate, NDMAD mesylate, and placebo. Within doses, six healthy male volunteers received these treatments in a double-blind crossover design. No clinically significant changes were observed in blood pressure, pulse, respiration, or clinical laboratory test results. Untoward effects were typical of benzodiazepines. Adinazolam and NDMAD kinetics were dose independent. Greater than 95% of the adinazolam dose was metabolized to NDMAD. Adinazolam and NDMAD mesylate produced dose-related increases in uric acid clearance and decreases in plasma uric acid. Both adinazolam and NDMAD mesylate administration resulted in dose-related sedation and decrements in psychomotor performance. Within doses, decrements produced by adinazolam and NDMAD were quantitatively similar. These results suggest that both adinazolam and NDMAD possess uricosuric activity and support the hypothesis that NDMAD primarily mediates benzodiazepine-like effects of adinazolam mesylate.", 
    "18": "To examine whether hepatic drug metabolism is altered in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of three model pharmacologic substrates (antipyrine, a marker of hepatic oxidative metabolism; lorazepam, a marker of hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity; and indocyanine green (ICG), a marker of hepatic blood flow and biliary secretion) in 14 patients with CF (14.6 to 29.2 years of age) and in 12 children and adolescents with cancer (7.2 to 19.4 years of age), which was treated with only surgery and radiation. Each study subject received a single intravenous dose of the combined model substrates (0.03 mg/kg lorazepam, 10 mg/kg antipyrine, and 0.5 mg/kg ICG) for 5 minutes, followed by repeated blood sampling (n = 10) during a 24-hour postinfusion period. Patients with CF had a significantly greater plasma clearance of lorazepam (56.5 +/- 5.2 vs 25.9 +/- 1.9 ml/min/m2) and ICG (892.5 +/- 176.4 vs 256.5 +/- 41.7 ml/min/m2) but not of antipyrine (27.2 +/- 3.8 vs 20.7 +/- 2.0 ml/min/m2) in comparison with control subjects. The apparent steady-state volume of distribution for lorazepam, ICG, and antipyrine was significantly higher in the patients with CF (2.0-, 3.1-, and 1.4-fold, respectively) than in control subjects. Clearance of the model substrates did not correlate with standard biochemical markers of hepatic function. Similarly, no significant relationships were observed between the clearance or steady-state volume of distribution of the compounds and the National Institutes of Health prognostic scores for the patients with CF. These data demonstrate that the plasma clearance of lorazepam and ICG is increased in patients with CF and suggest that hepatic glucuronosyltransferase activity and biliary secretory capacity are enhanced in this disease.", 
    "19": "The objective of this study was to determine if flexible FOB could be performed safely without premedication other than topical anesthesia. A total of 281 procedures performed during a 12-month period at a VA medical center were reviewed. Ninety-one procedures performed without premedication were compared with 190 procedures performed with premedication. Complications occurred in 5 percent of patients in each group. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in age, spirometry, P(A-a)O2 or SaO2 between both groups. Despite the proven safety of outpatient FOB without sedation, many bronchoscopists administer complicated premedication regimens and employ ambulatory surgery beds or recovery rooms to monitor patients before and after procedures. These results support a simplified approach to routine FOB which would include no premedications and greater use of outpatient facilities resulting in decreased expenditures without compromising patient care, safety or comfort.", 
    "20": "Acute edematous pancreatitis follows excessive cholinergic stimulation in patients exposed to anticholinesterase-containing insecticides. We describe the role of cholecystokinin and the benefits of cholecystokinin receptor blockade in this form of pancreatitis. A cholinergic mimetic (carbachol) was administered to rats weighing 300 to 350 g and produced a form of edematous pancreatitis that mimics that seen in humans. Animals received carbachol intraperitoneally, either alone (250 micrograms/kg of body weight) or with cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist devazepide (3 mg/kg of body weight) and were killed 4 hours later. Carbachol administration resulted in a 19% increase in pancreatic weight, a fourfold increase in serum amylase levels, and a 14-fold increase in serum lipase levels. Plasma cholecystokinin levels, however, were not altered. Devazepide administered prior to cholinergic hyperstimulation blocked pancreatic weight increase and reduced elevations in serum amylase levels twofold and lipase levels fourfold. Although cholecystokinin levels are not elevated in this model of pancreatitis, blockade of even low, background concentrations of this regulatory peptide is beneficial.", 
    "21": "Fifty-nine elderly residents of long-term care facilities who had DSM-III diagnoses of dementia were studied in an 8-week randomized, double-blind comparison trial of haloperidol, oxazepam, and diphenhydramine to test the efficacy of these agents in the treatment of clinically significant behavioral disturbances in patients with dementia. All three agents demonstrated modest but significant efficacy as measured by clinician ratings of agitated behavior and activities of daily living. The absolute magnitude of improvement was greater for haloperidol and diphenhydramine than for oxazepam, but differences among groups did not approach statistical significance. Frequencies of acute adverse events during the trial were similar across the drug treatment groups. Although these drugs may differ in terms of long-term safety and efficacy, they appear to be equivalent for short-term management of agitated behavior in severely demented patients.", 
    "22": "The neurologic complications of cocaine toxicity are responsible for a major portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with cocaine. Most of the complications appear to be related to the hyperadrenergic state induced by cocaine and may be treated symptomatically. Diazepam is the most effective drug for cocaine-induced seizures.", 
    "23": "Hemodynamic function during induction of anesthesia, the alfentanil and naloxone requirements, and the speed of recovery from total intravenous anesthesia with alfentanil/midazolam (group M, n = 10) or alfentanil/propofol (group P, n = 10) were compared in patients undergoing lower limb surgery. Twenty patients were randomly assigned to receive either 2 mg/kg propofol in 5 min followed by 9 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 30 min and 4.5 mg.kg-1.h-1 until skin closure, or 0.42 mg/kg midazolam in 5 min followed by 0.125 mg.kg-1.h-1 until skin closure. Simultaneously, a variable-rate infusion of alfentanil was given. Patients were ventilated with 30% oxygen in air. In both groups blood pressure and heart rate decreased significantly (P less than 0.02) and to a similar extent during induction. The total dose of alfentanil was similar in both groups. No patient in group P and nine patients in group M needed naloxone (average dose 130 +/- 70 micrograms, P less than 0.001). Recovery, as judged by psychomotor tests (90% score was reached at 1 h in the P group and at about 4 h in the M group, P less than 0.001), sedative scores, and orientation in time and place, was shorter in group P than in group M. The conclusion is reached that propofol is superior to midazolam in total intravenous anesthesia with alfentanil.", 
    "24": "Recent studies have suggested that the GABAA, receptor complex, the site of action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma amino-butyric acid (GABAA) and the anxiolytic benzodiazepines, is heterogeneous. Moreover, its composition may change during development. To better understand the molecular basis of receptor heterogeneity, the levels and distribution of the mRNA encoding the alpha 1 receptor subunit were examined in the developing and adult rat brain with quantitative in situ hybridization histochemistry. Our studies demonstrate that alpha 1 subunit mRNA expression changes during ontogeny. At late embryonic stages and in the first postnatal week, low levels of the mRNA were detected in the cortex, inferior colliculus, and hippocampus. The mRNA levels in these regions increased during the second and third postnatal weeks. Furthermore, a dramatic change in the distribution of the alpha 1 subunit mRNA was seen in the second postnatal week when the message first became detectable in the cerebellar cortex. During subsequent development and in the mature brain, the alpha 1 subunit mRNA was most abundant in the cerebellum, olfactory bulb, and inferior colliculus, although the absolute levels of mRNA varied by as much as sixfold in selected brain regions. The mature distribution of alpha 1 subunit mRNA, along with its temporal appearance in the cerebellum, suggests that this subunit is a constituent of the Type 1 benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor complex. Furthermore, the onset of alpha 1 subunit mRNA expression in the cerebellar cortex coincides with a period of extensive synapse formation, raising the possibility that synaptic interactions modulate the appearance of this GABAA receptor subunit in the cerebellum.", 
    "25": "1. We have studied the effect of inhibiting the interaction of platelet-activating factor with its receptor by using two structurally different antagonists BN-52021 (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) and alprazolam (1 and 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on the evolution of glomerular filtration and renal blood flow, in the experimental model of acute renal failure induced by the intramuscular injection of glycerol in rats. 2. We have also measured arteriovenous differences in platelet-activating factor concentration, as well as platelet-activating factor content in glomeruli from rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure. 3. After glycerol injection, untreated rats showed a marked reduction in inulin clearance which reached 77% in the first 30 min. The reduction was only 27% in the rats treated with BN-52021 and 38% in the rats treated with alprazolam (5 mg/kg), with statistically significant differences between treated and untreated groups. 4. Clearance of p-aminohippuric acid was also improved with BN-52021 or alprazolam treatment. 5. This protective effect of BN-52021 was observed in a more prolonged follow-up (3 days). 6. Glomeruli from rats with acute renal failure, treated or untreated with BN-52021, showed similar amounts of platelet-activating factor, whereas it was undetectable in glomeruli from normal rats. Furthermore, rats with glycerol-induced acute renal failure released greater amounts of platelet-activating factor. 7. These results provide evidence of a role for platelet-activating factor in the genesis of this model of experimental acute renal failure.", 
    "26": "The cloning and expression of five mammalian muscarinic receptor genes (m1-m5) have shown that the individual receptor subtypes differ in their functional and ligand-binding properties. To study the role of the carboxyl terminal receptor domains in this pharmacological diversity, we constructed chimeric m2/m3 receptors in which a region comprising part of transmembrane domain VI, the third extracellular loop, transmembrane region VII, and the cytoplasmic tail (collectively referred to as C-terminal domains) was exchanged between the human m2 and the rat m3 receptor. The ability of the cloned receptors to mediate stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and to bind subtype-selective muscarinic ligands was studied after their transient expression in COS-7 cells. Whereas wild-type m3 strongly stimulated phosphoinositide breakdown, wild-type m2 gave only a poor response. Exchange of the C-terminal domains between m2 and m3 had no significant effect on the magnitude of these responses. In N-[3H]methylscopolamine competition binding studies, the muscarinic antagonists AF-DX 116 and methoctramine showed 11- and 23-fold higher affinities, respectively, for m2 than for m3, whereas hexahydro-silad-ifenidol (HHSiD) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) displayed the reverse selectivity profile, having approximately 10-fold higher affinities for m3. In comparison with wild-type m3, the mutant m3 receptor containing the C-terminal domains of m2 displayed 2.5- and 8-fold higher affinities for AF-DX 116 and methoctramine but 7- and 3-fold lower affinities for HHSiD and 4-DAMP, respectively. The mutant m2 receptor with the C-terminal domains of m3 showed 2-3-fold lower affinities for AF-DX 116 and methoctramine but 2-3-fold higher affinities for HHSiD and 4-DAMP, as compared with wild-type m2. These data suggest that the C-terminal domains of the muscarinic receptors are not involved in conferring selectivity of coupling to phosphoinositide hydrolysis but contain major structural determinants of antagonist binding selectivity.", 
    "27": "The role of endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligands in the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy was studied in humans and in rat models of hepatic encephalopathy. Endogenous benzodiazepine ligands were extracted from rat brain and human CSF by acid treatment and purification by HPLC. Detection and partial characterization of these endogenous benzodiazepine ligands were carried out using both radioreceptor binding assays and radioimmunoassays with anti-benzodiazepine antibodies. Four different benzodiazepine receptor ligands were identified in human and rat tissue, two of which may be diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, based on elution profiles and anti-benzo-diazepine antibody reactivity. Human CSF and serum from patients with hepatic encephalopathy contained approximately 10 times more endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand than CSF from controls or nonencephalopathic patients with liver disease. The levels of brain benzodiazepine receptor ligand compounds were also increased approximately 10-fold in rats suffering from fulminant hepatic failure, but not in rats with portacaval shunts, a model of chronic hepatic disease. The increased concentrations of these substances could be behaviorally significant and may contribute to the pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy.",

Because of the simple technique and advantageous pharmacological properties, ketamine, and later its Hungarian analogue, Calypsol, were used.", 
    "29": "Unilateral stereotaxic injection of small amounts of the cholinotoxin, AF64A, caused minimal nonselective tissue damage and resulted in a significant loss of the presynaptic cholinergic markers [3H]hemicholinium-3 (45% reduction) and choline acetyltransferase (27% reduction). No significant change from control was observed in tyrosine hydroxylase or tryptophan hydroxylase activity; presynaptic neuronal markers for dopamine- and serotonin-containing neurons, respectively. The AF64A lesion resulted in a significant reduction of dopamine D2 receptors as evidenced by a decrease in [3H]sulpiride binding (42% reduction) and decrease of muscarinic non-M1 receptors as shown by a reduction in [3H]QNB binding in the presence of 100 nM pirenzepine (36% reduction). Saturation studies revealed that the change in [3H]sulpiride and [3H]QNB binding was due to a change in Bmax not Kd. Intrastriatal injection of AF64A failed to alter dopamine D1 or muscarinic M1 receptors labeled with [3H]SCH23390 and [3H]pirenzepine, respectively. In addition, no change in [3H]forskolin-labeled adenylate cyclase was observed. These results demonstrate that a subpopulation of muscarinic receptors (non-M1) are presynaptic on cholinergic interneurons (hence, autoreceptors), and a subpopulation of dopamine D2 receptors are postsynaptic on cholinergic interneurons. Furthermore, dopamine D1, muscarinic M1 and [3H]forskolin-labeled adenylate cyclase are not localized to striatal cholinergic interneurons.", 
    "30": "Ankylosing spondylitis is a disease that may deform any portion of the spine. Local anesthesia is generally recommended when undertaking corrective procedures for this problem. We present a case where local anesthesia was deemed unsatisfactory. Prior tracheal intubation facilitated the use of general anesthesia.", 
    "31": "A double-blind comparison of clonazepam and lorazepam was conducted in 24 patients with acute mania. Patients received either clonazepam or lorazepam alone for 14 days. Treatment with lorazepam produced marked improvement in symptomatology, while treatment with clonazepam failed to demonstrate a significant therapeutic effect. Sixty-one percent of patients responded to treatment with lorazepam, with 38.5% achieving remission. This compares to an 18.2% response rate and 0% remission rate in patients treated with clonazepam. These findings support the usefulness of lorazepam in the treatment of acute mania.", 
    "32": "The paper describes five cases of accidental intraarterial injection of pharmacological drugs (diazepam or thiopentone) or dope (heroin) in an upper limb. Following a review of the physiopathological mechanisms which led to ischemic damage, the Authors outline a protocol of continuous pharmacological sympathicolysis in the affected limb, using repeated anesthetic blocks of the homolateral stellate ganglion.", 
    "33": "Adenosinergic agents such as adenosine, 2-chloro-adenosine, N6-cyclohexyladenosine produced dose-dependent protective effect against DMCM- and Ro 5-4864-induced convulsions and mortality. N6-cyclohexyladenosine produced most significant protective e ect against Ro 5-4864-induced convulsions whereas 2-chloroadenosine was more effective than N6-cyclohexyladenosine in antagonising DMCM-induced convulsions. Pretreatment of animals with subprotective doses of adenosine and dipyridamole significantly prolonged the latencies for the onset of myoclonic jerks and convulsions due to both DMCM and Ro 5-4864. DMCM and Ro 5-4864-induced mortality rate was also significantly reduced by pretreatment with subprotective doses of adenosine and dipyridamole. Similarly, subprotective doses of adenosine and diazepam further delayed the latencies for myoclonic jerks and convulsions due to DMCM and Ro 5-4864 treatment. The results suggest that adenosine and adenosine receptor agonists, 2-chloroadenosine and N6-cyclohexyladenosine are protective against both DMCM- and Ro 5-4864-induced convulsions. It is suggested that adenosinergic agents via activation of central A1 adenosine receptors may modulate the convulsant effects mediated by DMCM and Ro 5-4864. This study further supports the notion that adenosinergic mechanisms mediate neuroprotective e ects in the central nervous system.", 
    "34": "Effect of chronic treatment with Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist, and its withdrawal, on the cortical and hippocampal electroencephalogram (EEG) was investigated in rats. Chronic treatment with Ro 15-1788 and its withdrawal (24 and 48 hr) were found to reduce the EEG amplitude in both cortical and hippocampal regions. This reduction in cortical and hippocampal EEG amplitude produced by chronic treatment with Ro 15-1788 and its withdrawal was reversed by gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), pentobarbitone and picrotoxin, agents known to modulate the GABA/BZ synaptic events by acting at different sites on the complex. Baclofen a GABAB agonist and FG7142, a BZ inverse agonist were found to further reduce the EEG amplitude in the cortical and hippocampal regions of these rats, chronically treated with Ro 15-1788. Diazepam, a BZ agonist was found to have no significant effect on the alteration produced in the cortical and hippocampal EEG amplitude by chronic treatment with Ro 15-1788 or its withdrawal. It is suggested that the conformational changes produced on the GABA/BZ receptor complex by BZ receptor occupation, has a facilitatory effect on the actions of those drugs which act on the GABA/BZ receptor complex and the direction of this enhancement depended on the nature of the drug.", 
    "35": "Thirty-three patients complaining of a burning mouth were investigated for deficiencies which might cause the symptoms. No deficiencies could be demonstrated. They were also questioned on their state of mind in the preceding period and their daily intake of medicine. More than half described their state of mind as normal. Benzodiazepines was the drug group used most. A treatment protocol for these patients is described.", 
    "36": "This study evaluated the usefulness of midazolam in inducing a anesthetic state in 60 patients who underwent surgery under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into 3 groups; a geriatric group, a hepatic dysfunction group, and a control group (adults without complications). To induce sleep 0.15 mg.kg-1 or 0.2 mg.kg-1 of midazolam was administered intravenously to all three groups. After the administration of midazolam, the mean time for obtaining absence of response to calling name and absence of ciliary reflex were not significantly different in the three groups. The pulse rate and respiratory rate also did not change remarkably. But significant decreases were observed in the systolic blood pressure and tidal volume in all three groups. However, they were not significantly different among the three groups. These results indicate that midazolam is a useful drug for inducing anesthetic state in geriatric patients and patients with hepatic dysfunction.", 
    "37": "A new benzodiazepine-type drug, midazolam, was administered intramuscularly as a premedicant to 155 patients aged from 16 to 81 years with ASA status 1 or 2. The hypnotic action and the effect on the upper airway tract of midazolam were evaluated. Hypnosis appeared 5 minutes after the administration of midazolam, reached its plateau after 20 minutes and started to decline after 30 minutes. The hypnotic effect showed dose-dependent increase in doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.20 mg.kg-1. No age-dependent differences in hypnosis were observed except for teenage group which showed stronger hypnosis than the other age groups. There was no problem on the upper airway tract for all age groups at the dosage of 0.05 mg.kg-1, but in the patients over 40 years increasing dosage tended to obstruct the upper airway tract. Along with the appearance of hypnosis, cough and breath holding, suggesting retention and aspiration of saliva, were observed. The appropriate dosage of midazolam for premedication was considered to be 0.05 mg.kg-1.", 
    "38": "The effect of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, was assessed in a random, double-blind clinical study in which each of the four groups of surgical outpatients comprising 20 in each was given either ketamine 100 mg (K), etomidate 20 mg (E), thiopental 300 mg (T) or flunitrazepam 4 mg (F) for induction of anesthesia. On emergence, patients in each group were randomly given 2cc of either 2 coded solutions, one of which contained 0.2 mg flumazenil and the other of which was normal saline. Following injection of coded solution, all patients were assessed at 0, 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min for wakefulness. All 10 patients of group F who received flumazenil were alert and able to recall at 5 min, whereas in group T this was noted from 15 to 30 min. Patients of group E and K responded alike in a manner as of those who received normal saline placebo with onset of wakefulness at 30 and 60 min respectively. These results confirm that flumazenil antagonizes flunitrazepam (within 5 min) and also indicate that the antagonizing effect occurs 30 min following injection for thiopental, suggestive of some cross-reactivity between these two drugs.", 
    "39": "Rapid recovery is an essential component in the anesthesia of OPD surgery. In this study midazolam, the short-duration benzodiazepine, was used as an intravenous anesthetic in OPD surgery. At the end of the operation flumazenil, the specific antagonist of benzodiazepines, was given to reverse the effect of midazolam. Recovery of these patients was compared with those in the control group who received saline instead of flumazenil. In a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study the antagonistic effect of flumazenil on midazolam was investigated in fifty ASA class I-II gynecologic outpatients subjected to D & C procedure under anesthesia induced with midazolam (0.3 mg/kg). They were divided into group A (flumazenil group) and group B (placebo group) with 25 patients in each. At the end of operation patients in group A were given 0.2 mg flumazenil intravenously to antagonize the residual effect of midazolam while patients in group B were given 2 ml normal saline intravenously as control. Our results showed that patients in group A exhibited a rapid and steady return of consciousness scaled by alertness, orientation of time and place and activity collaboration at 5, 30 and 60 min intervals following administration of flumazenil (p less than 0.005). There were no significant changes found in the hemodynamic or respiratory aspect between groups (p greater than 0.05). All the patients tolerated midazolam and flumazenil well. It is concluded that the use of flumazenil to antagonize the residual effect of midazolam is safe and effective as far as outpatient procedure is concerned.", 
    "40": "The effect of some anesthetic drugs on intraocular pressure (IOP) was studied in 120 normal healthy patients undergoing non-ophthalmic surgical procedures. IOP rose significantly following the injection of succinylcholine (SCh) alone, or when such injection had been preceded by a pretreatment with a \"self-taming\" dose of SCh or d-tubocurarine (d-Tc). Though the rise in IOP after diazepam pretreatment was significant, the magnitude was lower than that observed in the groups pretreated with the other two agents. Halothane brought the IOP down faster and lower than ether. SCh is unsafe for intubation for the administration of general anesthesia in cases involving penetrating ocular injuries. It can, however, be used safely for routine ophthalmic surgery, providing that 8 minutes are allowed to elapse between injection and corneal or scleral incision. Halothane is preferred to ether, since the former lowers IOP faster and in a greater amount than the latter.", 
    "41": "The agonistic potencies of (+/-)muscarine, (+/-)cis-2-methyl-5- [(dimethylamino)methyl]-1,3-oxathiolane methiodide (cis-oxathiolane) and its two enantiomers were determined at muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors in the pithed rat. In non-pretreated animals, i.v. administration of these agents produced bradycardic effects mediated by cardiac M2 receptors followed by increases in heart rate mediated by M1 receptors in sympathetic ganglia. As these responses have been shown to partly overlap, \"true\" M1 and M2 potencies were determined after selective blockade of M1 and M2 receptors by pirenzepine and methoctramine, respectively. A similar rank order of agonist potencies was obtained at M1 and M2 receptors: (+)cis-oxathiolane greater than (+/-)cis-oxathiolane greater than (+/-)muscarine greater than (-)cis-oxathiolane. At both receptor subtypes, (+)cis-oxathiolane was considerably more potent (ca. 30-fold) than its corresponding (-) enantiomer indicating that the agonist binding sites of the two receptor subtypes may have similar stereochemical properties. While (+/-)muscarine showed similar potencies at M1 and M2 receptors, racemic cis-oxathiolane and its two enantiomers showed a slight selectivity (3-7 fold) for M1 receptors indicating the potential usefulness of these compounds in the development of selective M1 receptor agonists.", 
    "42": "We have investigated the relation between nocturnal insulin requirements and nocturnal growth hormone (GH) release in 26 diabetic adolescents at various puberty stages and have examined the effect of nocturnal GH suppression on pre-breakfast insulin requirement. In all the studies, euglycaemia was maintained overnight using a computer-calculated variable-rate insulin infusion, and 15-min blood samples were collected for GH assay. During initial clamp studies, insulin infusion rates were greater from 0500-0800 h (15.22 +/- 0.95 mU/kg/h, mean +/- SEM) than from 0100-0400 h (12.42 +/- 0.84 mU/kg/h, P less than 0.001). The increase in insulin infusion rate correlated with mean overnight GH concentration (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001), and was maximal at puberty stage 3 in both sexes. In seven of the subjects, a second identical clamp was performed following administration of 100 mg oral pirenzepine. During these studies, mean overnight GH levels were reduced by 11-85%, from 17.6 +/- 1.6 to 7.5 +/- 2.2 mU/l; P less than 0.01. Insulin requirements were not significantly different between the periods 0100-0400 and 0500-0800 h during these studies, and the reduction in pre-breakfast (0500-0800 h) insulin requirement when compared with the baseline studies correlated with the fall in GH secretion (rs = 0.82, P less than 0.01). The dawn increase in insulin requirement in adolescents with IDDM is related to the overnight GH secretion during puberty, and pre-breakfast insulin requirement can be reduced by suppressing nocturnal GH release.", 
    "43": "In a helical maze scopolamine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) significantly impaired the ability of rats to acquire a spatial learning task using reference memory. In contrast, diazepam (0.5-2 mg/kg) did not impair acquisition of this task and the only effect of diazepam (4 mg/kg) was likely to be secondary to sedative effects. Diazepam (0.5-4 mg/kg) did not impair 8-day retention of the helical maze. In a test of working and reference memory in which spatial processing was minimised, scopolamine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) significantly impaired acquisition and increased the number of reference memory errors. Diazepam (1 and 4 mg/kg) did not impair acquisition of this task, but when a delay was interposed in the middle of a trial the diazepam-treated rats were slower to complete the task than the controls and made more errors of both working and reference memory. In contrast, when the rats were tested with a change of context, the diazepam-treated rats completed the task more quickly than the controls and made fewer errors of both working and reference memory.", 
    "44": "Some new 5,6-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepine derivatives substituted at the 5 position have been synthesized and tested to evaluate their antidepressant and neuropsychopharmacological activities. The antinociceptic action of these compounds has been also assayed. The introduction of an ethoxycarbonyl group at the 4 position generally decreased the antidepressant effect.", 
    "45": "The effect of flumazenil (RO 15-1788) on postoperative analgesic requirements was evaluated in 30 postoperative patients. This prospective investigation was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients undergoing general anesthesia supplemented by midazolam and fentanyl or sufentanil. Patients received either flumazenil (n = 20) or placebo (n = 10) by random assignment. Analgesic requirements were measured in morphine equivalents (MEs) and were recorded for a three-hour period following the administration of flumazenil. All patients received the assigned treatment within five minutes of arrival to the postanesthesia room. Total ME requirements were 4.1 +/- 3.8 mg for the flumazenil group and 4.5 +/- 4.6 mg (p = 0.71) for the placebo group. Patient analgesic requirements were also assessed when patients were adequately alert. For the flumazenil group this time period was 6.2 +/- 12.7 minutes versus 52.9 +/- 28.4 minutes for placebo (p less than 0.01). MEs (flumazenil 4.1 +/- 3.8 mg vs. placebo 3.7 +/- 3.2 mg) were not significantly different (p = 0.57) when similar levels of consciousness were compared. The onset of pain was more rapid with flumazenil patients as evidenced by the first analgesic dose at 15.7 +/- 25.1 minutes for the flumazenil group versus 34.7 +/- 43.7 for the placebo group; however, these data were not statistically different (p = 0.144). These results suggest that flumazenil does not increase postoperative analgesic requirements during the immediate postanesthesia period; however, patients receiving flumazenil may experience an earlier onset of postoperative pain.", 
    "46": "Seven out of nine Penicillium isolates from mouldy maize in Yugoslavia have been differentiated into the adjacent species P. aurantiogriseum and P. commune. Nephrotoxicity of cultured mycelia in the rat has been demonstrated for all isolates of both species and was correlated usefully, though indirectly, with the production of benzodiazepine secondary metabolites, notably auranthine. Shredded wheat (22 g) moulded by an example of each species and fed to a rat over 4 days elicited renal pathology in the P3 segment of proximal tubules, involving frequent pyknosis and extensive mitosis typical of this as yet uncharacterised toxin. The effect was attributed in P. aurantiogriseum at least partly to the spores. Prominent pathology was elicited by only 1g of spores given over 4 days.",

However, they are all capable of provoking paradoxical salivation from the chronically parasympathetically denervated human parotid gland. The rates of the secretory responses to the typical and atypical cholinoblockers are found to be the same. This finding is discussed with respect to the general functional mechanism of the traditional and non-traditional antimuscarinic agents.", 
    "48": "Clorazepate dipotassium was administered orally to 8 healthy dogs at a dosage of 2 mg/kg of body weight, q 12 h, for 21 days. Serum disposition of nordiazepam, the principle metabolite of clorazepate, was determined after the first and last dose of clorazepate. Disposition variables were analyzed by use of model-independent pharmacokinetics by the predictive equations method and the trapezoidal rule method. Complete blood counts, serum chemical analyses, and urinalyses were performed before administration of clorazepate and at 10 and 21 days after administration of clorazepate. Maximal nordiazepam concentrations ranged from 446 to 1,542 ng/ml (814 +/- 334 ng/ml), at 59 to 180 minutes (97.9 +/- 42.0 minutes) after a single oral dose of clorazepate. Maximal nordiazepam concentrations ranged from 927 to 1,460 ng/ml (1,308 +/- 187.6 ng/ml), at 120 to 239 minutes (153 +/- 57.9 minutes) after multiple oral doses of clorazepate. Serum disposition was significantly altered after multiple doses of clorazepate. Using data determined by the predictive equations method, the mean residence time after multiple doses (712 +/- 214 minutes) was longer (P less than 0.05) than after a single dose (527 +/- 95.8 minutes). Oral volume of distribution after multiple doses of clorazepate (1.76 +/- 0.647 L/kg) was smaller (P less than 0.02) than after a single dose (3.18 +/- 1.52 L/kg). Oral clearance after multiple doses of clorazepate (3.09 +/- 0.726 ml/min/kg) was less (P less than 0.001) than after a single dose (6.54 +/- 2.15 ml/min/kg).

    "49": "A retrospective study was undertaken to evaluate the relevance of benzodiazepine detection in 42 children with accidental poisoning. Immunoenzymatic assay for benzodiazepine in serum and colorimetric method in urines were positive respectively in 3 and 4 patients only. Several reasons could explain these results: the high detection threshold, the different drug reactivity according to the molecular structure and the great delay between intoxication and toxicology analysis. An advised physician should not prescribe a toxicological analysis after a small quantity of benzodiazepine ingestion.", 
    "50": "The syndrome of \"painful legs and moving toes\" is characterised by spontaneous causalgic pain in the lower extremities associated with peculiar involuntary movements of the toes and feet. It has been observed after a variety of lesions affecting the posterior nerve roots, the spinal ganglia and the peripheral nerves. The pathophysiology of the syndrome is unknown. I report a patient who developed the syndrome during treatment for schizophrenia with the antipsychotic agent molindone hydrochloride. The patient's response to the combination of clonazepam and baclofen suggests that the pathophysiology of the \"painful legs and moving toes\" may be linked to impairment of spinal serotonergic and GABA functions.",

The mean diameters of the particles in the suspensions were 770, 840, and 460 nm, respectively. The CNS actions were verified by recording the bioelectrical activity of the precentral cortex. The suspensions were tolerated well. There were no differences in onset, duration, and maximal intensity of action between suspension and solution of each drug. The results of this study should facilitate pharmacological studies of drugs acting on the CNS that are insoluble in water.", 
    "52": "This study was undertaken to determine whether midazolam alleviates sympathoadrenal response evoked by tracheal intubation in elderly patients with hypertension. Anesthesia was induced with midazolam in a sleep dose followed by vecuronium 0.1 mg.kg-1. Heart rate and blood pressure were recorded before, 1 and 3 minutes after induction with intubation. Free and total catecholamine (CA) in plasma were measured at each time. Dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine (EN) were determined using fluorescence derivatization with diphenylethylenediamine by HPLC. Although heart rate and diastolic pressure rose in some degree 1 min after intubation, free and total CA concentrations did not increase during study period. Free and total EN levels decreased significantly 3 min after intubation. The absence of elevation in plasma CA concentrations, especially in free CA, which is physiologically active, would contribute to produce circulatory stability on laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation. However, the mystery of why hyperdynamic state was produced without the increase in CA concentrations remains to be solved, even though it occurred for a short period of time.", 
    "53": "The present study employed various receptor-binding assays to clarify the biochemical characteristics of SM-9018. SM-9018 possessed very high affinity for 5-HT2, D2 and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.61, 1.4 and 2.9 nM, respectively), and it had moderate affinity for alpha 1 and D1 receptors (Ki = 17 and 41 nM, respectively). However, SM-9018 had only negligible affinity for alpha 2, opiate, glutamate, phencyclidine, benzodiazepine and GABAA receptors. These results suggest that SM-9018 may be a novel antipsychotic agent with binding affinity for 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptors.",

    "55": "Features of amnesia trace reactivation by activation of different links of dopaminergic system synaptic apparatus following the change of benzodiazepine, GABAA and GABAB receptors activity are found in experiments in mice. Diazepam pretreatment increases bupropion effectiveness, prolongs duration of enhanced passive avoidance response retrieval during D-1 and D-2 receptors activation by (+)3-PPP and decreases both characteristics under selective D-2 receptor activation by quinpirole. Activation of GABAA and GABAB receptors induces the attenuation of quinpirole effect and the duration of (+)3-PPP action.", 
    "56": "Based on evidence available at present, it appears that heterogeneity does exist within bipolar disorder. Persons with mania differ in family history of affective illness, their age at the onset of illness, sex, and organic cause and course of the illness. The question of how these variables influence an individual's response to treatment has never been systematically studied. Multicenter trials of the various antimanic agents need to be conducted to determine whether the various subgroups of manic patients have different pharmacological response profiles. At present, the clinical management of mania is best approached using lithium carbonate in a dosage adequate to achieve a 12-hour serum lithium level to 1.0 to 1.2 mEq/L. The time to response is usually 2 to 3 weeks, and during this period an antipsychotic or benzodiazepine agent may be added to help control symptoms such as agitation or sleeplessness. Prophylactic maintenance with 12-hour serum lithium levels between 0.8 and 1.0 mEq/L should be used for at least 6 to 12 months after resolution of the manic episode. In patients with more than one episode, lithium maintenance therapy may need to be continued indefinitely. In patients who are not responsive to lithium, the most prominent alternative therapies include anticonvulsants and calcium-channel blocking agents. Anticonvulsants (e.g., carbamazepine, valproic acid, clonazepam) are generally first used as alternative therapy (either alone, or in combination with lithium), followed by a calcium-channel blocker (e.g., verapamil). Clinical practice would generally suggest first using the alternative agent alone, then adding lithium if response is inadequate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "A series of 6H-(1)benzothiopyrano[3,4-e][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3- b]pyridazines and 6,7-dihydro-(1)benzothiepino[4,5- e][1,2,4]triazolo [4,3-b]pyridazines were prepared and tested for their ability to displace [3H] diazepam from rat brain membranes. An approximately planar shape of these molecules was essential for high affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor. Among them, 11-aryl compounds in the latter series were found to have high affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor. 11-Phenyl- and 11-thienyl- 6,7-dihydro-(1)benzothiepino[4,5-e][1,2,4]triazolo[4,3- b]pyridazine (3b-5 and 3b-11 respectively) showed the potent affinity comparable to that of diazepam.

    "58": "A search of the records of one general practice, serving 5282 patients, generated a list of 72 patients (1.36%) who had been using a benzodiazepine tranquillizer continuously for more than 6 months. These patients were interviewed and asked to discontinue the use of these drugs with the help of their general practitioner. An individual approach for each patient was agreed between the general practitioner and the patient. Patients who initially did not agree to try to stop the drug were included in the study. After 1 year, 27 (37.5%) of the patients had stopped using the benzodiazepine completely and 24 (33.3%) had reduced their previous consumption by more than 50%. This outcome was independent of sex, age, drug used, duration of use, whether they were exceeding the original dose of the drug and attendance at a consultant psychiatric clinic. It was significantly more likely that the patient would stop taking the drug if they originally wished to do so, but several of those who initially did not want to try to stop were able to do this. The excess number of consultations for the patients in the study for the year of the study compared with the year before the study only constituted 0.35% of the total number of consultations in the practice. The results were better than expected and the exercise was felt to be worthwhile, particularly as the increase in workload was very small.",

Three groups of clients, drawn from one treatment programme, were studied: persistent heroin users, persistent benzodiazepine users, and control subjects who were not using illicit drugs in addition to methadone. Persistent abusers mostly had high trough serum methadone levels, and their ongoing drug use appears to reflect a preference for a different drug effect rather than inadequate methadone dose. Several clients did have the expectation that methadone should prevent them from using other drugs; such expectations may diminish the effectiveness of treatment.", 
    "60": "The respiratory effects of several benzodiazepine (BZ) agonists and inverse agonists were compared with those of buspirone and pentobarbital in awake rhesus monkeys. Subjects, fitted with a helmet that served as a pressure displacement plethysmograph, were studied in a ventilated, sound-attenuating chamber; ventilatory frequency, tidal volume (VT) and minute volume (VE) were determined from the plethysmograph signal. During experimental sessions monkeys inhaled either 5% carbon dioxide (CO2) mixed in air or air alone according to a fixed alternating schedule. BZ agonists (alprazolam, 0.01-1.0 mg/kg; lorazepam, 0.3-10.0 mg/kg; quazepam, 1.0-5.6 mg/kg) decreased VT and VE during both 5% CO2 and air inhalation. Pentobarbital (3.0-30.0 mg/kg) also decreased VT and VE and additionally decreased respiratory frequency in monkeys breathing 5% CO2. Two BZ inverse agonists, the beta-carbolines beta-CCE and FG 7142 (0.3-5.6 or 10.00 mg/kg), increased frequency and had no effect on VT, resulting in an increase in VE in monkeys breathing either 5% CO2 or air. The weak BZ inverse agonist CGS 8216 (0.3-5.6 mg/kg) similarly increased ventilation only in monkeys breathing air. Buspirone (0.03-0.3 mg/kg), like the beta-carbolines, increased frequency and VE and, like the BZ agonists, decreased VT. The BZ antagonist Ro15-1788 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) had little or no effect on ventilation, but Ro15-1788 and also CGS 8216 (both at 1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the respiratory depressant effects of lorazepam or alprazolam. In turn, alprazolam (0.03-0.3 mg/kg) and quazepam (1.0-3.0 mg/kg) attenuated the respiratory stimulant effects of FG 7142.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "61": "To determine whether benzodiazepine tranquilizers increase the risk of accidental injury requiring medical attention, we used pharmacy claims submitted to a large third-party payer to identify 4,554 persons who had been prescribed these agents and a matched control group of 13,662 persons who had been prescribed drugs other than benzodiazepines. We then used diagnoses recorded on claims submitted by medical care providers to identify all accident-related care received by these persons during three months before their first-observed prescription for a benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine agent, respectively, and six months subsequently. We found accident-related care was more likely among persons who had been prescribed benzodiazepines; among these persons, the probability of an accident-related medical encounter was higher during months in which a prescription for a benzodiazepine had recently been filled compared to other months; and persons who had filled three or more prescriptions for these agents in the six months following initiation of therapy had a significantly higher risk of an accident-related medical event than those who had filled only one such prescription. Approximately two-fold risks of accident-related care were found, after controlling for age, sex, and prior utilization.", 
    "62": "Using pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in subconvulsant doses, it was found that the semisynthetic diterpene sclareol glycol (SG) from the labdane family of diterpenes at a dose well below the lethal dose, although not being convulsant, had a proconvulsant action in mice. This action is indicated by the number of mice undergoing convulsions and the reduction of latency. Specific binding of [3H]-diazepam in vitro to whole homogenate fractions prepared from hippocampus of rats was not inhibited by SG. At the same time comparatively investigated Ro 15-1788 inhibited [3H]-diazepam binding. It is suggested that the proconvulsant effect of SG is realized not through interactions with central benzodiazepine receptors as Ro 15-1788 does, but perhaps through interactions with adenylate cyclase (stimulating its catalytic subunit and thus increasing brain 3',5'-AMP availability). Other brain neurotransmitter systems (e.g., GABA) should also participate in realization of the proconvulsant effect of SG.", 
    "63": "The inhibitory effect of Y-24180, 4-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-[2-(4-isobutylphenyl)ethyl]-6,9-dimethyl-6H-t hieno [3,2-f][1,2,4]triazolo [4,3-a][1,4]diazepine, on platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced platelet aggregation and the specific binding of 3H-PAF to platelets was compared with other thienodiazepine derivatives, WEB 2086 and etizolam. Y-24180 inhibited PAF-induced rabbit platelet aggregation in vitro (IC50 3.84 nM), but had little effect on adenosine diphosphate- or arachidonic acid-induced aggregation. WEB 2086 and etizolam also showed an inhibitory effect of PAF-induced aggregation (IC50 values are 456 and 6730 nM, respectively). In PAF-induced human platelet aggregation, Y-24180 (IC50 0.84 nM) was more potent than WEB 2086 (IC50 4.21 nM) and etizolam (IC50 998 nM). Y-24180, WEB 2086 and etizolam displaced 3H-PAF binding from the washed-platelets of rabbits with an IC50 value of 3.50, 9.35 and 29.5 nM, respectively. In rabbits, pretreatment with Y-24180 and WEB 2086 antagonized PAF-induced platelet aggregation dose-dependently. The significant inhibitory effect of Y-24180 (1 mg/kg, p.o.) lasted 72 hr after a single dose oral administration. WEB 2086 (10 mg/kg, p.o.) also antagonized the ex vivo response induced by PAF 1 hr after administration, but no significant effect was observed 3 hr after administration. Y-24180 displaced 3H-diazepam binding from the synaptosomal membranes of rat cerebral cortex with a Ki value of 3.68 microM. The affinity of Y-24180 for benzodiazepine(BZP) receptors was lower than those of WEB 2086 and etizolam and was about 1000 times lower than that for PAF receptors in platelets.", 
    "64": "The abilities of ketotifen and other 4-piperidylidene derivatives (HF200-184, HE36-953, SDZ209-321 and SDZ206-703) to inhibit aversive responding were compared in the mouse light/dark test box and in the rat social interaction test. Ketotifen and HF200-184 reduced aversive responding of the mouse to the brightly illuminated area of the test box and facilitated rat social interaction; HF200-184 was approximately 100 times more potent than ketotifen. The chronic administration and withdrawal from treatment with diazepam, ethanol, nicotine and cocaine in the mouse was associated with increased behavioural suppression which was prevented by the administration of ketotifen and HF200-184 during the period of withdrawal. HE36-953 also prevented the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from diazepam and cocaine. The relative potencies of ketotifen and its analogues to inhibit aversive responding did not correlate with their affinities for the 5-HT3 recognition site. It is concluded that compounds within the 4-piperidylidene series can reduce behavioural suppression in rodent models of anxiety and attenuate the behavioural consequences of withdrawing from treatment with drugs of abuse.", 
    "65": "Experiments are described in which the benzodiazepine portion of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)/benzodiazepine receptor and the muscarinic cholinergic receptor were investigated in Parkinson's disease and control brains. Tritiated flunitrazepam and tritiated quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to locate and quantify the receptors by autoradiographic and homogenate binding techniques. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs of the basal ganglia allowed comparison of receptor densities in the post-mortem control and parkinsonian tissue, while homogenate binding experiments gave information concerning receptor affinity and maximum binding capacity. The results indicate that: 1) Binding of flunitrazepam to the benzodiazepine receptor is reduced in the lateral segment of the globus pallidus in Parkinson's disease. This suggest that the GABA-ergic pathway from the putamen to the lateral pallidal segment is overactive in Parkinson's disease. 2) Binding of QNB to the cholinergic receptors of the medial pallidal segment is increased in Parkinson's disease. This finding suggests underactivity of the cholinergic pathway from the pedunculopontine nucleus of the medial pallidal segment. 3) Binding of these ligands in the caudate and putamen of Parkinson's disease is not significantly different from controls. We reviewed the literature concerning the activity of these projections in parkinsonian conditions assessed by different methods and discuss here their implications for the pathogenesis of parkinsonian symptoms.", 
    "66": "The functional activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor-chloride ionophore complex was studied in rats with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) secondary to thioacetamide-induced fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Muscimol stimulation and benzodiazepine potentiation of GABA receptor-mediated 36Cl- uptake into cerebral cortical synaptoneurosomes was compared in HE and control rats. [3H]Flumazenil binding assays were conducted to determine whether the levels of endogenous benzodiazepine-like ligands in extracts of cortex were increased with stages of encephalopathy in this animal model of HE. In both control and HE rats maximal uptake of 36Cl- via the GABAA receptor complex occurred at muscimol concentrations of 30 microM. Potentiation of muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes by diazepam (5 microM) was equivalent in both groups. Aqueous extracts of proteolytically digested homogenates of cerebral cortices prepared from control and HE rats were effective in stimulating 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes. Alkaline organic extracts of proteolytically digested homogenates of cerebral cortices from HE rats were more effective than corresponding extracts from controls at inhibiting the binding of [3H]flumazenil. Inhibition of [3H] fumazenil binding by organic extracts derived from the cerebral cortices of HE rats did not increase with progression of encephalopathy. The results show that muscimol-stimulated 36Cl- uptake into synaptoneurosomes and, consequently, GABAA receptor-mediated chloride channel function are not significantly altered in the model of HE studied and are consistent with the hypothesis that HE results in an increased availability of one or more endogenous ligands which can augment GABA receptor-gated chloride conductance.", 
    "67": "1. Benzodiazepine analogues inhibit human platelet aggregation induced by arachidonate with an EC50 value of 0.68 microM for PK 11195, the most potent analogue used. 2. There was a highly significant correlation between the inhibition of arachidonate-induced aggregation and the affinity for the peripheral-type of benzodiazepine binding sites. 3. There was no significant correlation between the inhibition of the platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced aggregation and the binding to the peripheral-type of benzodiazepine binding sites. 4. The inhibition of platelet aggregation seems to result from the inhibition of arachidonic acid cyclo-oxygenation, since the synthesis of thromboxane and 12-hydroxy-heptadecatrienoic acid, both cyclo-oxygenase products, was reduced. 5. Our results suggest that peripheral-type of benzodiazepine binding sites on human platelets could be linked to cyclo-oxygenase.", 
    "68": "1. Chronic benzodiazepine administration has been associated with tolerance and with downregulation of gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA)-receptor binding and function. However, effects of individual benzodiazepines on brain regions have varied. 2. To compare the effects of chronic lorazepam and alprazolam, we have administered these drugs to mice for 1 and 7 days (2 mg kg-1 day-1) and determined benzodiazepine receptor binding in vivo with and without administration of CL 218,872, 25 mg kg-1 i.p., and GABA-dependent chloride uptake in 3 brain regions at these time points. 3. Benzodiazepine binding was decreased in the cortex and hippocampus at day 7 compared to day 1 of lorazepam, with an increase in CL 218,872-resistant (Type 2) sites in both regions. Maximal GABA-dependent chloride uptake was also decreased in the cortex and hippocampus at day 7. 4. Binding was decreased only in the cortex after 7 days of alprazolam, with no significant change in Type 2 binding. Maximal GABA-dependent chloride uptake was also decreased only in the cortex. 5. These data suggest that the effects of chronic benzodiazepine administration on the GABAA-receptor may be both region-specific and receptor subtype-specific.", 
    "69": "Ethanol administered i.v. or into the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) of rats anaesthetized with urethane inhibits baroreflex bradycardia elicited by phenylephrine. This effect is prevented or reduced by pretreatment of rats with 3-mercaptopropionic acid, bicuculline, or RO 15-4513. Intra-NTS injection of muscimol also inhibits baroreflex bradycardia and causes a pressor response which is potentiated by intra-NTS ethanol. It is proposed that ethanol inhibits baroreflex bradycardia, at least in part, by potentiating the action of endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at GABAA receptors in the NTS or its vicinity.", 
    "70": "In 10-day-old pups isolated in a novel environment, the presence of the dam reduced the rate of ultrasonic vocalization by 93%. The opiate antagonist naltrexone caused a dose-related increase in the rate of vocalization that was significant only at 5.0 mg/kg. This suggests that the dam exerts comforting effects through endogenous opioid mechanisms. Although the benzodiazepine agonist chlordiazepoxide is as effective as morphine in the quieting of isolation distress, its antagonist, Ro 15-1788, at doses up to 20 mg/kg did not alter the lowered rate of vocalization associated with the presence of the dam. Instead, it facilitated quiet contact with the companion. This raises the possibility that the presence of a social companion precludes the release of an endogenous anxiogen that binds to the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "71": "The possibility that the GABAA receptor is involved in supraspinal morphine analgesia was investigated in rats using pentobarbital and other GABAA receptor-chloride channel ligands. Inhibition of tail-flick was used as an index of analgesia. Pentobarbital almost completely reversed intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) morphine analgesia, but did not affect intrathecal (i.t.) morphine analgesia. Phenobarbital had a similar effect but was much weaker. Picrotoxin blocked the reversal effect of pentobarbital. Diazepam, when given together with pentobarbital, enhanced the effect of pentobarbital. Furthermore, muscimol reversed i.c.v. morphine analgesia without affecting i.t. morphine analgesia. Our results strongly suggest that the GABAA receptor is involved in supraspinal morphine analgesia.", 
    "72": "Effects of cholecystokinin (CCK) on bile flow through the sphincter of Oddi (SO) were studied in anaesthetized dogs. Intravenous injection of CCK (0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 IDU/Kg) elicited a dose-dependent reduction in flow through the SO in the first minutes after CCK administration. Pirenzepine and atropine decreased significantly (P less than 0.05) by 29% and a 40% respectively the inhibitory effect induced by 1 IDU/Kg of CCK, whereas hexamethonium elicited an increase in the inhibitory effect induced by 0.5 IDU/Kg of CCK (P less than 0.05). Intravenous infusion of cummulative doses of CCK had different effects according to the dose infused. Lower doses (0.025 and 0.05 IDU/Kg/min) increased transphincteric flow, however, high doses (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 IDU/Kg/min) were inhibitory. These finding indicated that CCK had two effects on the SO : firstly, a contractile effect, probably mediated through a direct myogenic action and neuronal release of ACh, and secondly a relaxant effect, probably mediated by stimulation of inhibitory postganglionic neurons.", 
    "73": "A rapid twin-column gas chromatographic method for the simultaneous screening and determination of commonly prescribed benzodiazepines from plasma and whole blood is presented. Identical fused-silica SE-54 columns were inserted in a common split-splitless injector and connected to nitrogen-phosphorus and electron-capture detectors. By combining these specific and sensitive detectors considerable and accurate chromatographic information was obtained in a single run. The drugs were extracted from 1 ml of buffered plasma or blood with n-hexane-dichloromethane (70:30) and analysed without derivatization. Flurazepam was used as internal standard. The method was reproducible enough to permit reliable quantitation of plasma diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, chlordiazepoxide, temazepam, midazolam, alprazolam, clobazam, norclobazam, adinazolam, flunitrazepam, bromazepam, triazolam, nitrazepam and clonazepam within 12 min.", 
    "74": "The Nelson general practice prescribing project has been set up to develop a model for cost effective prescribing in general practice. A pilot audit of regional prescribing patterns and trends for February 1989 was conducted to test data acquisition and presentation for the project, based on 12,690 scripts. There was marked variation in medicines choice, cost and number of scripts between general practitioners. The cost of prescriptions ranged from $2.20 to $127.70, median $10.77. Cardiovascular medicines were most frequently prescribed and most costly. Extemporaneous prescribing accounted for 20% of the February inventory and was highly individually variable. Benzodiazepine prescribing was not in line with current guidelines and was high, mean 6.7% of all prescribing, indicating an urgent need for unbiased drug information. Audited prescription data allows definitions of educational and pricing strategies.", 
    "75": "Sleep disorders related to depressive illness are now well documented. However, sleep disturbances associated with anxiety have only been explored in recent time. All types of anxiety (generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorders, panic attack) are associated with sleep disorders such as early insomnia, sleep interruption and low efficiency of sleep. The EEG approach gives different results according to the type of anxiety. Generalized anxiety is associated with total sleep time reduction and low efficiency of sleep. Sleep is unstable with numerous awakenings. Longer periods of stage 1 and 2 sleep are observed and slow wave sleeps as well as REM sleep time is reduced. REM sleep latency may be reduced in obsessive compulsive disorders. Although sleep abnormalities observed in anxiety disorders differ from those observed in depressive disorders, none of these features can be considered specific of anxiety.", 
    "76": "The potential antinociceptive effects of the selective cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B) antagonist L-365,260 were examined in the squirrel monkey tail withdrawal test. Pain threshold was measured in 6 male monkeys by recording the latency to remove the tail from a warm (55 degrees C) water bath. L-365,260 at doses of 100 ng/kg to 100 micrograms/kg significantly elevated tail withdrawal latencies throughout a 2 h test period. These data provide the first evidence that blockade of CCK-B receptors induces analgesia in primates.", 
    "77": "Acetylcholine has a variety of actions on hippocampal neurons, possibly through the activation of different muscarinic receptor subtypes. We have used several competitive muscarinic antagonists and the hippocampal slice preparation to test the hypothesis that a particular muscarinic response can be ascribed to a specific subtype. Initially we performed experiments to determine the relative ability of 3 antagonists to inhibit the cholinergic slow EPSP. Dose-response curves were constructed, and the IC50s determined for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), pirenzepine (PRZ) and 11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11,-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepin-6-one (AF-DX 116) were 72 nM, 385 nM, and 24 microM, respectively. While this pattern of antagonism argues against the contribution of the M2 receptor subtype, which would be expected to be relatively more sensitive to antagonism by AF-DX 116, this evidence does not adequately discriminate between other muscarinic receptor subtypes. We therefore performed studies designed to determine the antagonist binding affinities that can be diagnostic for determining different pharmacologically defined receptor subtypes. Using Schild plot analysis we examined the carbachol-induced block of the potassium (K)-dependent leak current, which is the muscarinic response thought to underlie the generation of the synaptically evoked slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) in hippocampal neurons. Estimated affinity constants (KBs) for 4-DAMP, PRZ and AF-DX 116 were 7.9, 278 and 1364 nM, respectively. These values are in good quantitative agreement with data from binding studies and strongly suggest a physiological role for the pharmacologically defined 'M3' receptor in the block of the leak conductance and, hence, in the slow EPSP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "Muscarinic receptor expression and function were investigated in cultured rat neostriatum. Muscarinic receptor levels were determined from saturation binding experiments performed on intact cultures using [3]N-methylscopolamine. In cultures maintained for 3, 7 and 12-14 days in vitro, the Bmax was 2.3, 5.4 and 10.9 fmol/culture. The average number of receptors per neuron increased during the 2nd week in vitro. Carbachol (100 microM) had no significant effect on basal cAMP levels but reduced cAMP levels elevated by forskolin. Carbachol significantly reduced cAMP levels stimulated with dopamine only in cultures untreated with a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. Comparing equimolar doses, the carbachol response was more sensitive to the M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine than the cardioselective M2 antagonist AF-DX 116. These results suggest that the muscarinic receptors regulate cAMP levels in neostriatal neurons and, in so doing, provide a post-synaptic substrate for the interaction of dopamine and acetylcholine.", 
    "79": "We interviewed 219 patients with a questionnaire to evaluate the prevalence of insomnia, and to assess whether benzodiazepine therapy was correctly indicated. Insomnia was present in 86 patients (39%), being initial in more than one half. Thirty-two of the patients with insomnia were receiving benzodiazepines (37%), 24 of whom (75%) had been treated for more than one year. The drug was incorrectly indicated in 18 (56%), in most cases because it was inappropriate for the type of the patient's insomnia. In six of these patients (33%), incorrect indication was related with self-medication. The benzodiazepine was incorrectly indicated in all the patients with diurnal oversedation. We emphasize the frequency of incorrect indications of these drugs, and we insist on the need that general practitioners have of a better knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of each drug, which is the basis for a correct indication.", 
    "80": "Carbachol produces both negative and positive inotropy in rat left atria. It is not clear whether these two effects are mediated by two separate cell surface muscarinic receptors or a single receptor interacting with two coupling proteins in the cell membrane. Pirenzepine, known to selectively block some biochemical muscarinic responses, was used in this study to block the biphasic response to carbachol in rat left atria. The negative inotropy to carbachol was blocked by pirenzepine, and Schild analysis indicated a -log dissociation constant (pKb) for the pirenzepine-receptor complex of 6.2. However, the Schild analysis may have been complicated by positive inotropy observed with pirenzepine. This positive inotropic effect was sensitive to blockade by other muscarinic antagonists. In atria from rats pretreated with pertussis toxin, carbachol produced a positive inotropic effect. Schild analysis with pirenzepine for antagonism of this response indicated a -log equilibrium dissociation constant for the pirenzepine-receptor complex of 6.7, significantly different from that for antagonism of negative inotropy. This ostensibly suggested a difference in the receptors mediating these responses. In view of the possible complicating effects of the positive inotropic effects of pirenzepine in this assay, an alternative method for the measurement of pirenzepine affinity was utilized. Resultant analysis was used to measure the pKb for pirenzepine antagonism of negative inotropy to carbachol. This method had the advantage of cancelling the positive inotropy to pirenzepine. Under these circumstances, pirenzepine had a pKb of 6.9, a value not significantly different from for antagonism of the positive inotropy to carbachol. The relevance of these findings is discussed in terms of a single promiscuous muscarinic receptor or heterogeneous receptors in this tissue. These data do not support the hypothesis that two separate receptors mediate these two effects.", 
    "81": "Both postnatal handling of rat pups and perinatal treatment with Ro 15-1788 have been reported to reduce the emotional reactivity of the rats in adulthood, as measured by open field behavior, by the corticosterone response to stress, and by labyrinth and novelty-induced behaviors. We now report results obtained with a well-validated animal model of anxiety (i.e. the elevated plus-maze) that support and extend these previous findings. The results show the clearest reduction of anxiety-related behavior when postnatal handling and perinatal Ro 15-1788 administration were simultaneous.", 
    "82": "The purpose of this study was to test the validity of the fear-reduction model of benzodiazepine (BZ) action on the exploration of novelty. According to this hypothesis an animal given a tranquilizer should selectively increase the amount of investigative behaviour in the more novel portion of an elevated maze. To permit comparison of the same behaviours at both ends of the maze, an elevated runway was built with a wall running lengthwise along the midline of one end. In the first experiment, male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with diazepam (2.0 mg/kg, i.p., -30 min) compared to saline-treated animals, increased the time spent exploring the open end of the runway but not the wall end of the runway, thus supporting the fear-reduction model. However, saline-treated animals, made less fearful by repeated prior exposure to the runway, did not show a similar increase in open-end exploration. Instead, they habituated to the novelty of the runway, as grooming and sitting still replaced investigation. In Experiment 2, exploration was rewarded by adding to the open end of the runway a patch of litter soiled by a female rat. This produced a behavioural pattern in naive saline-treated rats very similar to that seen in naive diazepam-treated rats in the first experiment. In Experiment 3, diazepam potentiated the habituation of rats previously familiarized with the runway. The initial increase and subsequent decrease in exploration caused by diazepam were encompassed by the biphasic model of BZ action more adequately than either the fear-reduction or reward-enhancement models.", 
    "83": "The correspondence between changes in physiological activity and somatic symptom reports was assessed in generalized anxiety disorder patients treated with alprazolam or imipramine. After 6 weeks, the two medications produced comparable reductions in self-reported somatic symptoms. However, patients taking alprazolam showed decreases in systolic blood pressure, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, and patients taking imipramine showed increases in heart rate, blood pressure, electromyographic activity, and norepinephrine. Thus, though the physiological changes associated with alprazolam treatment were consistent with changes in symptom reports, treatment with imipramine produced a desynchrony: patients reported significant decreases in cardiovascular symptoms and muscle tension in spite of the fact that heart rate, blood pressure, and electromyographic activity increased. Possible explanations for this counterintuitive phenomenon are discussed.", 
    "84": "Amacrine cells of the rhesus monkey, Macaca mulatta, were studied in 38 retinas Golgi-impregnated as whole, flat preparations. By using criteria of dendritic morphology, span of arborization, and level of arborization in the inner plexiform layer, 26 types of amacrine cell ranging in size of dendritic span from 30 microns to 2 mm were identified and listed in increasing size of dendritic span. In some instances, different cell types could be grouped together due to similar morphological features. For example, 1 group, \"knotty amacrine cells,\" has small cell bodies and a profusion of small, varicose, intertwined processes that span up to 30 microns and are essentially monostratified, but each of the 3 types ends in different strata. Another group is 2 types with about 20 fine radiating processes spanning 1 mm that possess some prominent varicosities. One of these has all of its processes terminating in the innermost stratum of the inner plexiform layer (\"spidery\"-type 2 amacrine cells). The other with predominantly similarly ending processes has some that also terminate in the outermost stratum (\"spidery\"-type 1 amacrines). These 2 cell types likely correspond to the type 1 and type 2 indolamine-accumulating amacrine cells in rabbit retina. Other types are individuals which cannot be grouped together but resemble familiar types in cat retina (AII and A13). Other types can be correlated with their putative neurotransmitter (type 1 CA-dopamine) or transmitter/drug receptor (\"spiny\"-benzodiazepine receptor) phenotype. Many types as yet have no known correlate from other Golgi studies or clues as to transmitter or receptor phenotype. This study provides evidence for an unprecedented number of amacrine cell types in the primate retina. The similar morphologies of different types of amacrine cell types within a group suggest other common features within these groups such as neurotransmitter phenotype.", 
    "85": "Chrysin (5,7-di-OH-flavone) was identified in Passiflora coerulea L., a plant used as a sedative in folkloric medicine. Chrysin was found to be a ligand for the benzodiazepine receptors, both central (Ki = 3 microM, competitive mechanism) and peripheral (Ki = 13 microM, mixed-type mechanism). Administered to mice by the intracerebroventricular route, chrysin was able to prevent the expression of tonic-clonic seizures induced by pentylenetertrazol. Ro 15-1788, a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, abolished this effect. In addition, all of the treated mice lose the normal righting reflex which suggests a myorelaxant action of the flavonoid. The presence in P. coerulea of benzodiazepine-like compounds was also confirmed.", 
    "86": "Short-term cultured dorsal unpaired median neurones from adult cockroach, Periplaneta americana, have been used to study alpha-bungarotoxin-resistant cholinergic receptors. Both acetylcholine and nicotine applied by pressure ejection to the neuronal soma induced depolarizing responses recorded with the patch-clamp technique in the whole cell recording configuration. Nicotine was more potent than acetylcholine and developed a dose-dependent biphasic depolarization including a fast and a slow component. The slow component was sensitive to alpha-bungarotoxin, d-tubocurarine, pirenzepine and gallamine, whereas the fast component was resistant to these nicotinic and muscarinic antagonists. These results demonstrate that two distinct functional receptors exist: a sensitive nicotinic and a 'mixed' (nicotinic muscarinic) receptor governing a nicotine-induced biphasic response.", 
    "87": "Continuous administration of triazolam, alprazolam or diazepam for a 7-day period by means of minipumps or chronic (17 days) p.o. treatment with alprazolam induced clear physical dependence in DBA/2J mice as assessed by precipitation of a withdrawal syndrome with an i.v. injection of the benzodiazepine receptor partial inverse agonist Ro 15-3505. In contrast, no precipitated withdrawal signs were observed following chronic exposure to high doses of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist Ro 16-6028. The use of minipumps and precipitation with a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist permits a simple and rapid evaluation of the physical dependence liability of potent compounds acting at the benzodiazepine receptor. Furthermore, these results support the hypothesis that benzodiazepine receptor partial agonists are less likely to induce physical dependence than full agonists."
