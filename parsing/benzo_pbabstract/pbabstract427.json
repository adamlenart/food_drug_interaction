This cohort study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of providing complete post operative analgesia in asthmatics with ketamine delivered in sub-anaesthetic doses (6.10-6.41 ugm./kg.-1/min-1). Diazepam (0.97-1.02 ugm./kg.-1/min-1) was delivered from the same infusion to eliminate the unwanted effects of ketamine. Ketamine induced little alteration in blood pressure while tachycardia was significant (P < 0.05). Respiratory functions observed, were favourable for asthmatics. Diazepam helped in reducing ketamine induced side effects, but after infusion over long periods tendency of cumulation was observed. Complications encountered were minimum with more than 93% patient acceptability for this method of analgesia.", 
    "1": "The anxiolytic effects of buspirone and its major metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP) have been investigated with a conflict (shock-induced suppression of drinking) paradigm in rats. Buspirone (10 mg/kg, p.o.) showed an anticonflict activity with a bell-shaped dose-response relationship without any effect on spontaneous water consumption. Higher doses of buspirone reduced the punished response. Diazepam (20 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) also showed an anticonflict activity in a dose-dependent manner, but animals with diazepam showed an increase in spontaneous water consumption at these doses. On the other hand, 1-PP (6.25-200 mg/kg, p.o.) showed a weak anticonflict activity with a significant effect at 25 mg/kg without any effect on spontaneous water consumption. In the 7-day treatment test, buspirone (5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), 1-PP (5 and 25 mg/kg, p.o.) and diazepam (10 and 40 mg/kg, p.o.) did not develop the tolerance to the anticonflict activity. Conversely, the anticonflict activity of diazepam was increased by the repeated treatment. Diazepam (10 mg/kg, p.o.) showed an anticonflict activity without any effect on spontaneous water consumption in this test. These results demonstrated that buspirone clearly exhibited an anticonflict effect similar to that of diazepam in a Vogel-type conflict test, and its real anxiolytic effect may not be always based on 1-PP, the main metabolite of buspirone.", 
    "2": "Lethal activity of Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxin was significantly reduced by the prior administration of barbiturates. Phenothiazine derivatives such as chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine and butyrophenone derivatives such as haloperidol and spiperone delayed the lethal effects in mice. Reserpine completely protected mice against the toxin when 10 mg/kg of the drug was administered 24 hr before the injection of the toxin, but did not protect when the same dose of the drug was given within 60 min before the injection of the toxin. Diazepam, apomorphine and gamma-butyrolactone also resulted in a significant increase in the time to death after the toxin. On the other hand, atropine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and verapamil provided no protection against the toxin. The administration of the toxin resulted in a significant decrease of dopamine levels in the brain, but no effect on levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine. The data suggest that drugs which directly or indirectly inhibit release and receptors of dopamine may lessen the lethal effects of epsilon toxin in mice.", 
    "3": "The effects of the benzodiazepines and somatostatin (SS) on learning and memory are the opposite of each other. To investigate a possible relationship between these two components, the effects of the administration over time of diazepam and of a benzodiazepine antagonist, 2-phenylpyrazolo [3,4-c]-quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS 8216), on the levels of somatostatin-like immunoreactivity (SSLI) and on the binding of [125I]Tyr11-somatostatin were studied in the hippocampus of the Wistar rat. Diazepam (5 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and CGS 8216 (20 mg/kg/day, i.p.) did not affect SSLI in the hippocampus, at the three times studied (3, 7 or 14 days). Administration of diazepam for 3 or 7 days decreased the number of somatostatin receptors in synaptosomes from the hippocampus, without influencing their apparent affinity. This decrease could be blocked by concomitant administration of CGS 8216, whereas CGS 8216 alone had no observable effect. After 2 weeks of daily injections of diazepam the levels of binding of somatostatin in the hippocampus returned to control values, coinciding with the tolerance that develops to chronically-administered benzodiazepine agonists. These results suggest that somatostatin receptors might be regulated by benzodiazepine receptors and perhaps may also play a role in some of the behavioural effects of the benzodiazepines.", 
    "4": "Interactions of mu-opioid receptors with the benzodiazepine system were studied by examining the modulatory effects of flumazenil (a benzodiazepine antagonist) and alprazolam (a benzodiazepine agonist) on the respiratory effects of the opioid peptide dermorphin. Dermorphin, 1-30 nmol administered i.c.v., to conscious, unrestrained rats decreased ventilation rate (VR) and minute volume (MV) dose-dependently. The ventilatory depression was antagonized by naloxone and by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. The benzodiazepine alprazolam potentiated the respiratory inhibition of a small (1 nmol) dose of dermorphin but antagonized that of a higher dose (3 nmol). The results suggest that the benzodiazepine/GABA receptor complex modulates respiratory depression induced by central mu-receptor stimulation in the rat.",

Abecarnil (isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), a beta-carboline with high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors, was tested in healthy male subjects; single doses of abecarnil were given in five dosage levels (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg) and in a multiple dose study in four dosage levels (15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg day-1) for 7 days. On two days following multiple dose treatment, placebo was given in single-blind conditions (follow-up). In each dosage level, in both studies drug was given to 10 subjects (7: verum, 3: placebo). 2. Safety and tolerability were evaluated by changes in vital signs, incidence and severity of adverse reactions and biochemical and haematological screening. Drug effects were estimated utilizing a bipolar visual analogue scale (poles: 'sleepy'-'alert') and a psychomotor task, the digit symbol substitution task. The pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses were also determined in the multiple dose study. 3. Abecarnil was generally well tolerated. In the single dose study the most frequently reported side effects associated with abecarnil at high doses (20 and 40 mg) were dizziness, unsteady gait, and lack of concentration. A decrement in performance on the digit symbol substitution task was also observed in the two high dosage groups 20 mg and 40 mg. Evaluation of visual analogue scale ratings did not reveal a sedative effect even at higher doses. 4. In the multiple dose study the most frequently reported side effects during the treatment period were dizziness, unsteady gait, and lack of concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Patients were instructed not to eat for 4 hours before the scheduled surgery and to bring an escort. Premedication with atropine or morphine was not routinely used. Following venipuncture, a 2- to 3-mL test dose of thiopental (Pentothal, Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL) was injected. After a pause of 15 to 20 seconds, 6 mL was injected slowly over 40 to 50 seconds. Additional medication was titrated slowly in intermittent doses to maintain an adequate level of anesthesia. The mouth was packed and kept meticulously dry to prevent coughing or laryngospasm. The patient's color and respiration were continually observed and the airway maintained. Initially, a 5% solution was used by Olson; later it was changed to 2%. Use of this concentration made it easier to titrate to \"upper levels\" of anesthesia because profound depth was not required. Also, adverse effects (eg, coughing, laryngospasm) occurred less frequently, and there was less venous irritation with the 2% solution. Based on his experience of 8,203 cases, Olson claimed that most patients tolerated the anesthetic well, but he recommended avoiding this technique for children younger than 12 years of age.",

    "24": "Valproate (VPA) is one of the most frequently used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Concern has recently been raised regarding VPA medication during pregnancy and teratogenic effects in the offspring. Both neural tube defects (5, 18, 34) and a constellation of signs termed the fetal valproate syndrome (1, 12) have been reported. Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are also widely used and sometimes as effective adjunctives in AED therapy. Both VPA and BZD have close connections to GABA transmission. Recently, clinical and epidemiological human studies (26, 27, 37, 39), supported by animal studies (17, 24, 40), have indicated that BZDs may act as human teratogens. We report on 7 children with congenital malformations, dysmorphism and abnormal neurological signs from birth. The mothers had well controlled primary generalized absence epilepsy without major seizures during pregnancy. Five children had been exposed to VPA monotherapy and two children to VPA and BZD combined during the first trimester. Those two infants had myelomeningoceles and the most pronounced dysmorphism in the group. We propose that these observations indicate a possible amplifying action of BZDs on VPA teratogenicity. Unrecognized BZD use during pregnancies exposed to VPA may be of importance when estimating the teratogenic risks of VPA therapy.", 
    "25": "Triciribine (TCN) and its 5'-monophosphate (TCN-P) are novel tricyclic compounds with known antitumor activity; TCN-P is currently in phase II human clinical trials. We now report that these compounds have potent and selective activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2. Using a syncytial plaque assay, TCN and TCN-P were active against HIV-1 at 0.01-0.02 microM and had differential selectivities of 2250 and 1900, respectively, compared to 1850 for AZT. In contrast, TCN and TCN-P had minimal selectivity against human cytomegalovirus (50 and 27, respectively). TCN and TCN-P markedly inhibited HIV-1-induced p24 core antigen production, reverse transcriptase, and infectious virus production in a dose-dependent manner using HIV-1 acutely infected CEM-SS, H9, and persistently infected H9IIIB and U1 cells. In acutely infected PBL cells, TCN and TCN-P inhibited reverse transcriptase and infectious virus production but not p24 core antigen production. Using a microtiter XTT assay, TCN and TCN-P were active against a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 strains at IC50 values ranging from 0.02 to 0.46 microM. Evaluation of matched pairs of predrug and postdrug therapy HIV-1 isolates established that AZT-resistant and TIBO-resistant variants of HIV-1 were sensitive to TCN or TCN-P. Furthermore, unlike AZT and other fraudulent nucleosides, neither TCN, TCN-P, nor TCN-TP inhibited the viral reverse transcriptase. Thus, even though triciribine is a nucleoside chemically, it does not act biologically by classic nucleoside modalities but rather by a unique mechanism yet to be elucidated.", 
    "26": "The aim of the present investigation was to study if the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil could reverse the effects on the brain electrical activity induced by the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam. The method of FFT approximation was used for this purpose. It allows the calculation of center of gravity equivalent dipoles of spectral EEG data. The results are reference independent and allow therefore a more unambiguous interpretation compared to conventional FFT data reports. Twelve subjects were investigated before and after 0.1 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg midazolam respectively, directly and 4 h after administration of 1 mg flumazenil. Our results imply that the application of flumazenil after midazolam sedation leads to an almost complete restoration of the brain electrical activity. However, especially in the beta frequencies above 20 Hz differences in depth of equivalent dipoles were found directly after flumazenil application as well as 4 h later. This could suggest that neuronal generators in different brain structures were responsible for the electrical activity after flumazenil administration compared to before.", 
    "27": "The objective was to determine if the benzothiazepine compound CGP-37157 selectively inhibits the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger of cardiac mitochondria without affecting the L-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger, or the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase of the cardiac sarcolemma, or the Ca(2+)-ATPase of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum. Mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange activity was determined by monitoring intramitochondrial free [Ca2+] in isolated heart mitochondria loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive fluorophore fura-2. CGP-37157 inhibited the activity of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 0.36 microM). Calcium currents were recorded by whole-cell voltage clamp in isolated neonatal ventricular myocytes. Diltiazem was able to block the recorded current completely, thus confirming the current to be exclusively L-type. CGP-37157 had no effect on the calcium current recorded under identical conditions. CGP-37157, at concentrations < or = 10 microM, had no effect on the activities of the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in isolated cardiac sarcolemmal vesicles or on activity of the Ca(2+)-ATPase in isolated cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles. The data suggest that CGP-37157 is a potent, selective, and specific inhibitor of mitochondrial Na(+)-Ca2+ exchange at concentrations < or = 10 microM.", 
    "28": "Using receptors expressed from mouse brain mRNA in Xenopus oocytes, we found that enhancement of type A gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABAA) receptor-gated Cl- channel response is a common action of structurally diverse anesthetics, suggesting that the GABAA receptor plays an important role in anesthesia. To determine if GABAA receptor subunit composition influences actions of anesthetics, we expressed subunit cRNAs in Xenopus oocytes and measured effects of enflurane on GABA-activated Cl- currents. Potentiation of GABA-activated currents by enflurane was dependent on the composition of GABAA receptor protein subunits; the order of sensitivity was alpha 1 beta 1 > alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2S = alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2L > total mRNA. The results suggest that anesthetics with simple structures may act on the GABAA receptor protein complex to modulate the Cl- channel activity and provide a molecular explanation for the synergistic clinical interactions between benzodiazepines and general anesthetics.", 
    "29": "The effects of diazepam, nitrazepam, clonazepam, and Ro5-4864 on transient (type I) and long-lasting (type II) calcium channels associated with low-affinity benzodiazepine receptors were investigated using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Clonazepam (100 microM), a specific agonist for the central-type benzodiazepine receptor, reduced transient currents through the type I calcium channel by 40% without affecting long-lasting currents through the type II calcium channel. Diazepam and nitrazepam (100 microM), non-specific agonists for both the central- and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, reduced both transient and long-lasting currents equally by 25-30%. A similar non-selective inhibition was observed by Ro5-4864 (1-10 microM), a specific agonist for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor. It is concluded that the two calcium channel types are regulated differentially by two different kinds of benzodiazepines; central-type for type I channel and peripheral-type for both type I and type II channels.", 
    "30": "The effects of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers and some GABAergic compounds on [3H]noradrenaline (NA) release from rat hippocampal slices prelabelled with 80 nM [3H]NA were determined. The convulsant gamma-HCH isomer facilitated (EC50 = 21 microM) and the depressant delta-HCH isomer reduced (EC50 = 48 microM) the Ca(2+)-dependent K(+)-evoked release of [3H]NA, whereas alpha- and beta-HCH isomers did not show any effect. Moreover, alpha- and delta-HCH isomers antagonized the facilitation of evoked [3H]NA release induced by the gamma-HCH isomer. The GABAergic convulsant drugs, bicuculline, picrotoxin and pentylenetetrazol, did not cause any modification of the evoked [3H]NA release even at high concentrations. Neither bicuculline nor picrotoxin blocked the effects of HCH isomers on K(+)-evoked release of [3H]NA. Exposure of slices to diazepam reduced the K(+)-evoked release of [3H]NA (EC50 = 33 microM) in a manner similar to that of the delta-HCH isomer. In addition, diazepam (50 microM) blocked the gamma-HCH effect and caused an additive inhibitory response with the delta-HCH isomer. On the other hand, diazepam and delta-HCH induced a time-dependent Ca(2+)-independent enhancement of basal [3H]NA release. The results suggest that modulation of [3H]NA release in the hippocampus by HCH isomers may be involved in the central actions of these compounds, and that sites other than the classic GABAA receptor may underlie their presynaptic mechanisms of action.", 
    "31": "The brain cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor (CCK-B/gastrin) has been implicated in mediating anxiety, panic attacks, satiety, and the perception of pain. The canine and human CCK-B/gastrin receptors share 90% amino-acid identity and have similar agonist affinities. These receptors can be selectively blocked by the non-peptide benzodiazepine-based antagonists L365260 (ref. 8) and L364718 (ref. 9); however, the binding of these antagonists to the human and canine receptors differs by up to 20-fold, resulting in a reversal of affinity rank order. Here we report the identification of a single amino acid in the sixth transmembrane domain of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor that corresponds to valine 319 in the human homologue and which is critical in determining the binding affinity for these non-peptide antagonists. We show that it is the variability in the aliphatic side chain of the amino acid in position 319 that confers antagonist specificity. Substitution of valine 319 with a leucine residue decreases the affinity for L365260 20-fold while concomitantly increasing the affinity for L364718. An isoleucine in the same position of the human receptor selectively increases affinity for L364718. Interspecies differences in the aliphatic amino acid occupying this single position selectively affect antagonist affinities without altering the agonist binding profile. We therefore conclude that the residues underlying non-peptide antagonist affinity must differ from those that confer agonist specificity. To our knowledge, these findings are the first example in which a critical antagonist binding determinant for a seven-transmembrane-domain peptide hormone receptor has been identified.",

They were distinguished from those immunoprecipitated by the alpha 1- and alpha 3-subunit antisera by a 4-5-fold and 5-10-fold higher affinity for diazepam and beta CCM, respectively. Using the delta-antiserum in immunoaffinity chromatography the delta-subunit was found to be associated with the alpha 1-, alpha 3-, beta 2/3-, and gamma 2-subunits, suggesting that the latter conveys benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity also to GABAA receptors containing the delta-subunit. The receptor population immunoprecipitated by the alpha 5-subunit antiserum (10 +/- 2% of receptors solubilized from whole brain extracts) was characterized by affinities for zolpidem, beta CCM, and CL 218872 which distinguished it from all other known receptor populations. The alpha 5-subunit was associated with the alpha 1-, alpha 3-, beta 2/3- and gamma 2-subunits pointing to differential subunit combinations. Indeed, when receptor populations were immunoprecipitated by the alpha 5-subunit antiserum from different brain regions, zolpidem displayed striking differences in affinity pointing to the role of subunits other than alpha 5 in determining receptor affinity.", 
    "42": "Male rats were treated for 21 days with drugs known to affect prolactin secretion, in order to assess the effects of these drugs on mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptors (MBRs). Sulpiride, a selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and hyperprolactinemic agent, decreased MBR density in the adrenal gland (49%; P < 0.005), whereas metoclopramide, another dopamine antagonist with a preference for dopamine D2 receptors, increased adrenal gland MBR density (31%; P < 0.05). Bromocriptine, a specific dopamine agonist, increased MBR density in this organ (87%; P < 0.001). None of the three agents influenced kidney or testicular MBRs. These data indicate that the mechanism of organ-specific alterations in MBRs seems to be prolactin independent.", 
    "43": "The psychogeriatric department in the county of Arhus is in a unique position to collect cases of old people treated with psychotropics in various inappropriate ways in hospital wards or by general practitioners. In 1991 the department was in contact with 768 elderly people mostly on an outpatient basis among whom 40 patients exhibited accumulated errors of psychopharmacologic treatment. The treatment episodes were analysed. The patients were very old (mean 80.8 years) with severe somatic morbidity. A majority were demented or delirious. 75% were living in nursing homes. The treatment episodes exhibited polypharmacy and large doses of neuroleptics (mean 0.7 DDD/day) or benzodiazepines (mean 1.41 DDD/day). Psychotropics not suitable for elderly patients were used in 34 patients. Indications for treatment were mostly unspecified behavioural disturbances, sometimes reflecting inappropriate social support. The majority of patients had side effects, sometimes rendering the patient more acceptable to staff and other residents.",

Patient characteristics and actual medication use were documented during a 1-month observation period. Neuropsychological and functional testing was performed on all residents receiving psychoactive medications. Constipation was assessed by measuring the frequency of laxative use.", 
    "46": "Laxatives were used daily by 74% of residents; 45% received more than one laxative a day. After adjusting for potential confounding by logistic regression modeling, we found that daily laxative use was significantly more common in residents taking highly anticholinergic antidepressants such as amitriptyline (odds ratio, 3.12), diphenhydramine (odds ratio, 2.18), highly anticholinergic neuroleptics such as thioridazine (odds ratio, 2.01), and in the very old (odds ratio, > or = 85 years = 2.23). Gender, decreased functional status, impaired cognitive function, and the use of benzodiazepines or antiparkinsonian agents were not associated with increased use of laxatives.", 
    "47": "A strong association exists in institutionalized elderly between the use of specific anticholinergic medications and constipation, as reflected in the increased use of laxatives. This effect was not seen with nonanticholinergic sedatives, nor was it explained by the patients' cognitive or functional status. These drugs may be responsible for substantial iatrogenic effects on bowel function in elderly patients.", 
    "48": "A rapid and simple high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous detection of intact glucuronides of different benzodiazepines is described. Separation of the diastereomers of the following benzodiazepine glucuronides can be achieved on a reversed-phase column (octadecyl or select B): oxazepam, nordiazepam, temazepam, lorazepam and 3-hydroxyprazepam. If the sample contains both S-lorazepam and R-temazepam glucuronides, or both S-temazepam and nordiazepam glucuronides, further separation on a beta-cyclodextrin column is required. The detection limit ranges between 5 and 10 ng of glucuronides per ml of plasma or urine, respectively.", 
    "49": "The ammonium ion (NH4+) evoked no response itself but facilitated the GABA-induced Cl- current (ICl) in dissociated rat cortical neurons. The GABA concentration-response curve shifted parallely to the left without changing the maximum response. Reversal potential of GABA response did not change in the presence of NH4+ at the concentration range between 0.1 and 1 mM. Ro 15-1788, a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, did not affect the facilitatory action of NH4+ on GABAA receptor. The results suggest that NH4+ modifies the affinity of GABAA receptor for GABA, without the involvement of benzodiazepine receptors.",

Extraction of all the enantiomers and internal standard was achieved using solid-phase extraction on C8 columns. Resolution was achieved using a Chiral-AGP column with mobile phase comprising 6.5% (v/v) acetonitrile in 50 mM potassium acetate buffer, pH *q3 3.10, at typical flow-rates of 0.35 ml/min for plasma and 1.0 ml/min for urine assays. Fluorescence detection was employed using excitation and emission maxima of 328 and 367 nm, respectively. Analytes were well resolved and no interfering endogenous peaks were observed either from plasma or urine. Standard curves for urine were linear for concentrations up to 500 ng/ml for R- and S-II, with correlation coefficients higher than 0.994 and limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 1 ng/ml for each enantiomer. The LOQ in plasma was 0.1 ng/ml for each of the four enantiomers. The precision and accuracy of the method for the enantiomers of both I and II were good for plasma and urine with coefficients of variations typically within 10%. The stability of the R- and S-enantiomers of II and I in plasma and those of II in urine was excellent, with no evidence of degradation or interconversion during storage and handling.",

Extraction of I, II, and the internal standard from plasma and urine samples were achieved using solid-phase extraction. Separation of the analytes was performed on a reversed-phase C18 column. The effluent was monitored with fluorescence detection at excitation and emission maxima of 328 and 367 nm, respectively. The work-up procedure was reproducible and recovered more than 92% of I and II from either plasma or urine. The chromatographic system for plasma and urine extracts allowed complete resolution of I and II from the internal standard with excellent selectivity. For each analyte, the lower detection limits were 0.1 and 1 ng/ml in plasma and urine, respectively. For each analyte, standard curves were linear in the ranges of 0.1-50 and 1-500 ng/ml in plasma and urine, respectively. The method was highly precise, with coefficients of variation for each analyte in quality controls that were generally below 7 and 5% for plasma and urine samples, respectively. The accuracy of the method was good with the deviations between added and calculated concentrations of each analyte being typically within +/- 10% and +/- 5.6% for plasma and urine samples, respectively. The stability of I and II in standard solutions, plasma and urine samples protected from laboratory light was excellent, with no evidence of degradation after 72 h at room temperature, five months at 4 degrees C, or three months at -20 degrees C.", 
    "52": "Wistar rats can develop a high preference for 3% alcohol after a period of forced alcohol exposure and 2 days of alcohol withdrawal. If these rats are selected at a medium (> or = 60%) and a high (> or = 85%) level of alcohol preference, it is possible to study the effects of various compounds on alcohol intake and alcohol preference in rats with two different levels of alcohol preference. With this procedure, it was demonstrated that the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide can reduce alcohol preference at doses > or = 10.0 mg/kg in the high alcohol preference group, by increasing the water consumption without affecting alcohol drinking. Chlordiazepoxide had no effects in the medium alcohol preference group. The 5-HT uptake inhibitors fluoxetine and citalopram reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference in both the medium and the high alcohol preference groups by means of a reduction in consummatory behaviour. Both drugs clearly affected total fluid intake and body weight gain. The 5-HT1A agent buspirone reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference in the group of medium alcohol preferring rats at doses between 0.0025 and 0.63 mg/kg. The drug did not change water drinking so that total fluid consumption diminished. At doses > or = 2.5 mg/kg buspirone, there was an increased alcohol consumption. Buspirone was without important effects on the high alcohol preferring rats. The 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron reduced alcohol intake in both the medium and high alcohol preferring rats at doses between 0.01 and 0.16 mg/kg. The drug had no effects on alcohol preference and water consumption. At some doses, there was a reduction in total fluid intake. The 5-HT2/1C antagonist ritanserin reduced alcohol intake and alcohol preference at doses between 0.04 and 2.50, and 0.16 and 10.0 mg/kg in the medium and high alcohol preferring rats, respectively. Together with the decrease in alcohol consumption there was an increase in water drinking, leaving total fluid intake unaffected. The activity of ritanserin was less pronounced in the high as compared to the medium alcohol preference group. These results indicate that various serotonergic agents can affect alcohol intake and alcohol preference by different mechanisms of action.", 
    "53": "The physical chemical properties, stability and incompatibility of tofizopam (the active ingredient of Grandaxin tablet) were investigated. Tofizopam has low water solubility therefore experiments were made to increase it. The behaviour of tofizopam in acidic medium was studied and the degradation rates of it were determined at different pH. The composition of Grandaxin tablet contains well established excipients. The granulation can be made by high shear and fluidized bed process as well. The properties of tablets (strength, friability, disintegration, dissolution) are independent from the granulation process. The scaling up of the technology and the commercial production of the tablets are managed successfully.",

The best separation was obtained in a reversed phase system using a C18 stationary phase and 46:31:23 mixture of 0.01 M aqueous 1-hepatanesulphonic acid-sodium-acetonitrile-methanol as the mobile phase. System suitability parameters and method validation are also presented and discussed. The elaborated method was suitable for the determination of the conformational isomer ratio of Tofisopam in various solvents and for the evaluation of Challenge Test.",

Separately detectable (Et)Me triplets of the conformers offered us a way for quantitative determination of conformer ratios. Temperature dependence of free enthalpy of conformers were calculated from the measured conformer ratios in different temperatures. Entropy component of the free enthalpy proved to be 35% of the whole at 36 degrees C. Half period of attaining equilibrium ratio of conformers was 2 hours at 36 degrees C.",

The questionnaire addressed practice setting, causes, length of treatment, and criteria used in discontinuation of treatment. A response rate of 68% was achieved. Results indicate continued disagreement among practitioners. The prevailing literature recommends treatment of neonatal seizures in the acute phase. Recent studies indicate that 8% to 15% of infants with neonatal seizures will have recurrent seizures after the newborn period. Animal models have shown that brain growth retardation and behavioral and learning impairment may occur from the use of phenobarbital in early infancy. The question of continued treatment of neonatal seizures beyond the acute phase is raised.",

Cats were induced in a chamber, removed and intubated, and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Cardiorespiratory data were recorded before and 3, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 minutes after intravenous injection of midazolam-butorphanol. Heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and respiration rate were significantly (p < .05) decreased below baseline at various times throughout the study. Tidal volume and minute ventilation were unchanged. End-tidal carbon dioxide was significantly (p < .05) increased above baseline for 30 minutes. Midazolam-butorphanol administered intravenously induced significant alterations in several cardiorespiratory parameters in isoflurane-anesthetized cats.",

However, pre plus postnatal treatment did not affect female's LC.", 
    "60": "The present study was undertaken to elucidate the effect of novel muscarinic (M1) receptor agonist, AF102B, (+-)-cis-2-methyl-spiro(1,3-oxathiolane-5,3')-quinuclidine hydrochloride hemihydrate, on the sympatho-adrenomedullary function of anesthetized rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized intraperitoneally with urethane and alpha-chloralose. After immobilization with gallamine triethiodide, respiration was maintained artificially. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were continuously monitored. Postganglionic inferior cardiac sympathetic nerve activity and preganglionic adrenal sympathetic nerve activity were recorded using an electrophysiological technique. In order to evaluate the adrenomedullary function, adrenal venous catecholamine secretion rate was also determined by HPLC-ECD method. Intravenous administration of AF102B (1 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent increase in cardiac sympathetic nerve activity that was accompanied with tachycardia both in nerve intact and pithed rats. AF102B produced a pressor effect in pithed rats but not in nerve intact rats. The AF102B-induced responses in pithed rats were significantly attenuated by the pretreatment with a M1 receptor selective antagonist, pirenzepine (50 micrograms/kg, i.v.). Moreover, AF102B produced a significant increase in adrenal epinephrine secretion rate without any increase in adrenal sympathetic nerve activity, which was also antagonized by pirenzepine pretreatment. These findings suggest that AF102B possesses an excitatory effect on the sympatho-adrenomedullary function which is mediated via pirenzepine sensitive muscarinic receptor of M1 subtype in anesthetized rats.", 
    "61": "1. Single sample clearance estimates (CL/F) of orally administered ethosuximide were obtained in four groups of healthy adult subjects. One group was treated with phenobarbital to induce CYP2B/2C and CYP3A activity; one group was treated with rifampin to induce CYP3A activity; one group consisted of cigarette smokers (increased CYP1A activity), and one group was untreated (controls). Ethosuximide CL/F values were slightly, though not significantly, increased among cigarette smokers (12.5% increase) and the phenobarbital group (25% increase), but rifampin treatment resulted in a significant increase (65%). 2. The influence of rifampin treatment on the single sample oral clearances of antipyrine, theophylline, phenytoin, carbamazepine, ethosuximide, quinidine, valproic acid, and lorazepam was investigated to determine whether rifampin induces only CYP3A. Rifampin treatment significantly increased the oral clearance of each drug from 1.4-fold (valproic acid) to 3.4-fold (quinidine). These findings indicate that the inductive effect of rifampin extends well beyond CYP3A.", 
    "62": "Powerful behavioural treatments for many patients with anxiety disorders have been widely available since the 1970s. Despite this, the majority of such patients have continued to be treated with psychotrophic drugs. Recent litigation against the manufacturers of benzodiazepine drugs has made the public increasingly concerned about the prescription of anxiolytic agents. In parallel with the fall in popularity of drug treatment, advances have been made which increase the availability and applicability of behavioural treatments for these patients. This paper examines the impact of the development of self-exposure and cognitive methods on a number of common anxiety syndromes. Clinical examples of self-exposure are given to demonstrate the simplicity of the technique.", 
    "63": "A method for the GC/MS confirmation of oxazepam, nordiazepam, desalkylflurazepam, temazepam, and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam in urine is described. The method incorporates a solid phase extraction technique developed by Varian which was found to extract all five metabolites with recoveries exceeding 73%. The extracted metabolites were derivatized with N-methyl-N-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA), resulting in the formation of stable tert-butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivatives. Quantitation was performed by GC/MS using oxazepam-D5, nordiazepam-D5, and alpha-hydroxyalprazolam-D5 as internal standards. The method was found to be linear over the range of 50-2000 ng/mL. Within-run precision, measured as the coefficient of variation at 100 ng/mL, was less than 3% for all analytes except temazepam which was 6% (N = 20).", 
    "64": "Serum was tested for benzodiazepines by fluorescence polarization immunoassay (FPIA) on Abbott's ADx system using the benzodiazepine serum reagents (Benzo S) and the benzodiazepine urine reagents (Benzo U) after pretreatment of specimens by means of acetone precipitation. The following sera were included for comparing the two methods: negative sera spiked with various benzodiazepines; 80 sera randomly selected out of a total of 8654 serum specimens from impaired drivers; and blood specimens from individuals who stated that they had taken benzodiazepines. The different benzodiazepines were added to serum at concentrations of 25, 75, and 300 ng/mL. The low-dose benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and triazolam were additionally tested at serum concentrations of 10 ng/mL. Because of the better reproducibility and the shift of the dynamic range to lower concentrations, the Benzo S assay was found to be more sensitive than the Benzo U assay after acetone precipitation. The direct ADx benzodiazepine serum assay has clear advantages over the acetone precipitation method, especially with regard to therapeutic concentrations and for the detection of the highly potent and low-dose benzodiazepines flunitrazepam and triazolam.", 
    "65": "The role of CCK receptor subtypes in peptide-stimulated acid secretion was assessed in six unanesthetized rats. The CCK-stimulated acid secretion was not blocked by L-365,260, a CCKB/gastrin receptor antagonist, and was significantly increased by devazepide, a CCKA receptor antagonist, given alone or together with L-365,260. L-365,260, but not devazepide, blocked pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion, and, when given together, devazepide abolished the effect of L-365,260. We conclude: 1) pentagastrin stimulates acid secretion through a gastrin-type receptor, but CCK may not, and 2) pentagastrin and CCK can stimulate acid secretion despite simultaneous blockade of CCKB/gastrin and CCKA receptors.", 
    "66": "Sixty patients, recognized as chronic alcoholics on the grounds of the case history and with a score above 11 of the Munich Alcoholism Test (MALT) have been treated with metadoxine or placebo for thirty days according to a double blind randomized design. In the group treated with active drug there has been a significant reduction higher than in the controls of the scores relating to the abstinence symptomatology, in particular regarding the neuropsychic residual symptomatology (anxiety, depression, insomnia) after the first week of treatment, a reduced requirement of benzodiazepines and/or neuroleptics, and a significant decrement higher than in the controls of the score of MALT at the end of treatment. Furthermore, metadoxine seems to make easy the maintenance of abstinence, at least at short term.", 
    "67": "The biochemical and pharmacological properties of nuclear [3H]flunitrazepam in brain tissues were studied. Nuclear [3H]flunitrazepam binding is saturable for both central and peripheral binding sites. Inosine and hypoxanthine displace nuclear [3H]flunitrazepam binding with greater potency than the membrane [3H]flunitrazepam binding. Triiodothyronine (T3) increases the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) of nuclear [3H]flunitrazepam binding in vitro while thyroxine (T4) does not have any effect. Diazepam reduces the affinity of nuclear 125I-T3 binding in vitro, while the Bmax is not affected significantly. Mild digestion of chromatin, using micrococcal nuclease, reveals that a major portion of nuclear [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites are located on chromatin. These data suggest a functional role for nuclear benzodiazepine binding and a possible modulatory effect of benzodiazepines on T3 binding with its nuclear receptors.", 
    "68": "Most elderly persons in nursing homes and residential care have mental disorders; up to 75% have dementia. Depression and behavioural problems are common. There are big differences between institutions in the proportion of residents prescribed psychotropic medication. A review of the literature suggests that antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are modestly effective in diminishing agitation in some dementing patients. Antidepressants may be underutilized, but clear guidelines about which depressed individuals should receive them are lacking. Attention should be given to ways of improving the environment within these homes, in order to relieve depression and anxiety, and to increase life satisfaction and self-esteem, before commencing psychotropic medication to deal with mental disturbances. Shortage of trained staff and inappropriate design of nursing homes are factors associated with behavioural disturbance in some cases. Special dementia care units are a desirable option for a minority of residents. Involvement of pharmacists and medical directors in monitoring effects, adverse side effects, possible interactions and appropriateness of medications in nursing homes is recommended.", 
    "69": "High doses of pilocarpine are known to produce prolonged seizure activity in rats. Previous studies show that pretreatment with LiCl will sensitize rats to the convulsant effects of pilocarpine. Here we report that the anti-epileptogenic and anticonvulsant drug MK-801 (dizocilpine) paradoxically also sensitizes rats to pilocarpine induced limbic seizures and limbic status epilipticus (LSE). If rats were pretreated with MK-801, normally subconvulsive doses of pilocarpine rapidly produced LSE. LSE could be prevented by co-administration of either atropine or diazepam with MK-801.", 
    "70": "This study examined the hypothesis that cholinergic receptor mechanisms within the gigantocellular tegmental field (FTG) of the medial pontine reticular formation can cause state-dependent changes in the firing rates of parabrachial nuclear complex (PBNC) neurons. Using intact, unanesthetized cats, long-term recordings were obtained from single PBNC neurons following FTG administration of cholinergic agonists and antagonists. We show that the state-dependent decrease in PBNC cell discharge reported in this study can be attributed to muscarinic mechanisms within the FTG. Our pharmacological blocking results further suggest that diminished PBNC discharge was mediated by non-M1 muscarinic receptors in the FTG. This study demonstrates the usefulness of combining long-term neuronal recordings in the PBNC with multiple pharmacological manipulations within the FTG.",

Flumazenil was injected intravenously as a 0.3-mg bolus in the first minute followed by 0.2-mg and 0.3-mg doses every minute until a total dose of 1 mg was given or until the patient responded. The Glasgow coma scale and a sedation-level scoring system were checked prior to and at 1, 5, and 30 minutes after the dose eliciting response or on completion of the full dose of flumazenil. The patients were divided into two groups based on their response to flumazenil: group 1, responders (N = 55), and group 2, nonresponders (N = 6). Eleven patients from group 1 allowed us to retrieve drug information from these patients once mental status had recovered and patients were treated accordingly. In two cases endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation were rendered unnecessary by the use of flumazenil. No undesirable hemodynamic effects were noted after flumazenil injection in this study, although none of the patients overdosed on antidepressants. Flumazenil may serve as a useful diagnostic and therapeutic tool in the management of selected cases of drug-induced coma.", 
    "72": "Cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) in CNS has been shown to function as a neuropeptide with potent anti-opioid activity. It hinders opioid analgesia and facilitates opioid tolerance. The present study showed that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation produced a marked increase of the CCK-8 immunoreactivity (ir) in the perfusate of the rat spinal cord. The increase of CCK-8-ir was most marked in response to EA of 100 Hz and 15 Hz, and less marked in response to EA of 2 Hz. Since CCK-8 has been shown to possess potent anti-opioid activity at the spinal level, blockade of the spinal CCK effect would be expected to potentiate EA-induced analgesia which is known to be opioid-mediated. Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of CCK-B antagonist L-365,260 per se did not affect tail flick latency (TFL) to any significant extent, yet it potentiated EA induced analgesia in a dose- and frequency-dependent manner. The potentiation was most marked at a dose range of 2.5-5.0 ng (i.t.) and at a frequency rank order of 100 Hz > 15 Hz > 2 Hz. The results suggest that an increased release of CCK-8 following EA may limit the effect of opioid peptides, and that the CCK-B receptor mediates the anti-opioid effect of CCK-8 in rat spinal cord.", 
    "73": "The interaction between the antinociceptive effects of fentanyl and midazolam, administered intrathecally (i.t.), was examined in dogs. Midazolam 1 mg (i.t) depressed the A delta and C fibre mediated somatosympathetic reflexes to 68.3 and 85.2% of control values and then reduced the subsequent doses of fentanyl (i.t.) required to abolish these reflexes by 50%. After midazolam (1 mg, i.t.) the ED values for fentanyl were markedly less than the theoretical predicted additive values. This indicates synergism between the effects of fentanyl and midazolam.",

At enrollment all patients showed at least a 50% decrease in airway resistance (Raw) after inhalation of 400 micrograms fenoterol or 200 micrograms oxitropium bromide. Telenzepine did not have a significant effect on forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC). Also, no significant changes could be detected in daily spirometric profiles or Raw. The results indicate that short-term treatment with the M1-selective antagonist, telenzepine, does not improve airway function in COPD patients, at least after administration by the oral route.",

Paradoxically, 40 mg/kg NMDA did not modify the behavior of the mice in the plus-maze. NMDA at a dose of 80 mg/kg again depressed the exploratory activity of mice, but this effect was accompanied with tremor and compulsive tail biting. The 'anti-exploratory' dose of NMDA (20 mg/kg) increased, whereas the 'tremorigenic' dose (80 mg/kg) significantly decreased the number of cholecystokinin (CCK) binding sites in the mouse cerebral cortex. The competitive NMDA antagonist (+/-)-CPP (2.5-5 mg/kg) and the non-competitive antagonist MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg) antagonized the anti-exploratory effect of NMDA (20 mg/kg). The tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (5 mg/kg, but not 1 or 10 mg/kg) also attenuated the inhibition of exploratory activity induced by NMDA. Of three CCK receptor antagonists tested, the unselective CCK antagonist proglumide (1 mg/kg, but not 0.1 and 10 mg/kg) significantly opposed the anti-exploratory action of NMDA. The selective CCK antagonists L-365,260 (1 microgram/kg) and devazepide (1 microgram/kg) were evidently weaker antagonists of NMDA. Furthermore, 10 micrograms/kg of L-365,260, a CCK-B receptor antagonist, and 1 mg/kg of devazepide, a CCK-A receptor antagonist, even tended to augment the effect of NMDA in the plus-maze. The results of the present study seem to give some support to the notion that not only NMDA receptors, but also CCK-ergic mechanisms are involved in the modulation of anti-exploratory action of NMDA in the elevated plus-maze.", 
    "80": "In order to get better insight into the principles of information processing by the brain during sleep and its alterations under the influence of drugs we applied some tools from linear system theory to sleep EEG data. We investigated late components of auditory and visually evoked potentials (AEPs and VEPs) during different sleep stages and calculated from these the so-called amplitude-frequency characteristics (AFC). The main advantage of this analysis is that it enables one to detect functional differences during different sleep stages. This information can hardly be obtained by conventional spectral analysis. The result of our investigation was that the transfer properties of the brain during sleep were extremely different and that lorazepam medication not only resulted in quantitative alterations of the sleep profile but mainly in highly significant alterations of the functional properties of sleep.",

In the case of Valium, drug-free solvent and diazepam suppressed PMN chemiluminescence. With Diazepam-Lipuro, the solvent stimulated and diazepam inhibited PMN chemiluminescence. With midazolam (Dormicum), only the active drug depressed PMN chemiluminescence. FMLP-induced PMN chemiluminescence was depressed 10-100 fold more by diazepam and midazolam than zymosan-induced chemiluminescence.", 
    "82": "We have studied simultaneously the pharmacokinetics of flumazenil and midazolam in 12 healthy Chinese children, aged 5-9 yr, undergoing circumcision. Two hours before operation each patient received midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1 orally for premedication and 0.5 mg kg-1 i.v. during induction. Six minutes after cessation of anaesthesia, a bolus of flumazenil 10 micrograms kg-1 was given i.v., followed by an infusion of flumazenil at 5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 which was maintained until the child could identify himself. Midazolam data were consistent with a three-compartment model with a mean (SD) elimination half-life of 107 (30) min, total body clearance of 15.4 (3.2) ml min-1 kg-1 and apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1.9 (0.6) litre kg-1. Flumazenil data were best interpreted by a monoexponential function, with a mean terminal elimination half-life of 35.3 (13.8) min, a total plasma clearance of 20.6 (6.9) ml min-1 kg-1 and apparent volume of distribution at steady state of 1.0 (0.2) litre kg-1. No unchanged midazolam was detected in the 24-h urine sample, but 5.8-13.8% of the flumazenil dose was recovered unchanged. At the time of self identification, 4.5 (1.4) min after flumazenil administration, the mean plasma concentrations of midazolam and flumazenil were 163.1 (43.7) and 29.9 (16.1) ng ml-1, respectively.", 
    "83": "A computer model for predicting blood/plasma concentrations of test chemicals in dosed feed and dosed drinking water toxicology studies was developed. The model was constructed based on linear theory. The animal's feeding and drinking habits and the linear disposition kinetics of the test chemical obtained after a bolus gavage dose were built into the model. Blood/plasma concentrations of oxazepam and pentachlorophenol in dosed feed and dosed drinking water studies were predicted and compared with the experimentally determined data. The model proved highly reliable in predicting the blood/plasma concentrations of test chemical in dosed feed and dosed drinking water studies. The results suggest that if the kinetics of test chemicals fit a one-compartment model then bioaccumulation of the test chemical will occur in dosed feed or in dosed drinking water studies when absorption half-lives are less than 1.38 hr and elimination half-lives are longer than 5 hr. The extent of accumulation is mainly dependent on the elimination half-lives. For chemicals with absorption half-lives less than 1.38 hr and elimination half-lives less than 2 hr, the extent of bioaccumulation will be minimal. Blood/plasma concentrations of test chemicals in rats and mice will fluctuate daily and a quasi-steady state will be achieved after ad libitum exposure to dosed feed or dosed drinking water for approximately 4 days. If a daily 12-hr light cycle is used with the light cycle starting at 7:00 AM, the expected peak and trough blood concentrations in dosed feed studies will occur approximately in the early morning (5:00 AM) and in the late afternoon (4:00 PM), respectively. Similar results were obtained for dosed drinking water studies. The model should be applicable to dosed feed and dosed drinking water studies using other species.",

    "88": "1. The effect of dietary medium chain triglyceride (MCT) on short-term food intake was compared with the effect of long chain triglyceride (LCT) in chickens. Maize oil was used as the LCT while glyceryl tricaprylate (C 8) and glyceryl tricaprate (C 10) were used as MCT. Cumulative food intake was determined during the 6 h after the start of feeding. 2. Chicks were given diets containing 200 g C 8/kg diet, 200 g C 10/kg diet or 200 g LCT/kg diet in experiment 1. As early as 30 min after feeding, cumulative food intake in both MCT-supplemented diets decreased significantly compared with the diet containing LCT. 3. To determine if endogenous cholecystokinin (CCK) was responsible for the decrease in food intake caused by MCT, birds were injected with the CCK-A receptor antagonist devazepide (DVZ, 1 mg/kg BW) before diet presentation. DVZ had no effect on food intake with either LCT- or MCT-supplemented diets. 4. In experiment 3, chicks were given a choice between either diets containing LCT and C 8, LCT and C 10, or C 8 and C 10 to confirm whether or not the palatability of the diets was influenced by the dietary fat sources. There was no difference in food intake between C 8 and C 10-supplemented diets. However, chicks preferred the LCT-supplemented diet compared with either of the diets containing MCT.", 
    "89": "The muscarinic receptors in the aorta of the normo- and hypertensive rats were characterised with tritiated acetylcholine (3H-ACh) and various muscarinic receptor antagonists. The binding of 3H-ACh to the endothelial membranes of the normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) and the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was displaceable by nanomolar range of scopolamine but only by micromolar range of atropine and homatropine. The reverse was observed with the muscle binding sites, i.e. the 3H-ACh was displaceable by nanomolar range of atropine and homatropine but only by micromolar range of scopolamine. Pirenzepine and 4-diphenyl-acetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine metobromide (4-DAMP) displaced the binding of 3H-ACh from both tissues in the nano to micromolar range, with the displacement from the endothelial binding sites occurring at lower concentration range of the ligands. The apparent IC50 values of both compounds for the smooth muscle were 9 and 16 times greater than those for the endothelial binding sites respectively. When saturated with guanylyl-imididiphosphate (GppNHp), conversion of high to low-affinity binding site occurred in both tissues of the WKY but only in the smooth muscle of the SHR. GppNHp had no apparent effect on the binding of 3H-ACh to the endothelial binding sites confirming that the high-affinity site for 3H-ACh was missing in the endothelium of the SHR.", 
    "90": "Seventeen infants born to mothers who used benzodiazepines (BZD) throughout pregnancy were followed prospectively and compared with 29 infants born to mothers who had not used psychoactive substances. On the Griffiths' Developmental Scale, the BZD-exposed infants demonstrated consistently lower mean GQs and DQs for all subscales at 5, 10 and 18 months of age. The differences in GQ reached statistical significance at 10 and 18 months. The DQs differed significantly for all subscales at 10 months and for the personal-social behaviour and hearing and speech subscales at 18 months of age. We suggest that prenatal exposure to BZD may cause a general delay in mental development up to 18 months of age.", 
    "91": "The accuracy of a computer-controlled infusion of midazolam, based on previously published pharmacokinetic parameters, was tested prospectively in 12 adult female patients undergoing general anaesthesia. Anaesthesia consisted of an initial bolus followed by an exponentially decreasing infusion of midazolam given according to body weight, fentanyl, nitrous oxide and vecuronium. Venous blood samples were taken at 15 min-intervals throughout the procedures and for 1-2 h postoperatively. The bias of the model was -5.1% (95% CI -11.3 to 1.2%) and precision 24.8% (95% CI 20.9 to 28.6%). Least squares regression analysis decreased the bias to -2.8% but did not alter precision. Retrospective fitting of an alternative set of published parameters for midazolam resulted in significant deterioration of the model. The precision was similar to that found in past studies of intravenous anaesthetic agents. Further improvement in the accuracy of midazolam infusion awaits improved understanding of the causes of pharmacokinetic variability.", 
    "92": "Most reports of polymedication among patients with chronic non-malignant pain have relied only on the patient's statements which have been proven to be unreliable regarding actual drug consumption. This study investigates the incidence of polymedication and medication compliance in these patients by applying objective methods. One-hundred-nine consecutive patients predominantly with facial, neuropathic or back pain were interviewed about present medication at first admission to the pain clinic. Reports were verified by toxicological urine screening, mainly with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupling. Follow-up investigations of 61 patients were conducted within 1 and 24 months after beginning therapy. Polymedication--here defined as daily intake of 3 or more preparations--was found in 41 patients (38%) in the initial investigation. In only 74 patients (68%) did the results of urine screening correspond with their reports: 23 patients (21%) concealed the consumption of drugs, and 2 patients (2%) did not take their medications. Ten cases were not interpretable. Fifty-four percent of the drugs concealed were psychotropic substances, mostly benzodiazepines, and 42% were analgesic combinations, partly with psychotropic additives. Drug intake was concealed significantly more often with polypharmacy which was occurring more frequently in patients with headache or facial pain, longer duration of pain, young age, psychiatric diagnosis and history of substance abuse. Patients with initial non-compliance were more likely to conceal drug consumption in follow-up investigations as well (P = 0.05). Therefore, screening for medication compliance in patients with chronic non-malignant pain is recommended, especially in those with the abovementioned risk factors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

This study evaluates five different regimens for analgesia and sedation including the standard of fentanyl and droperidol (Group A) and four other regimens, each containing midazolam. In a sixth group, droperidol was assessed for its antiemetic effects. Patients were medicated as follows: Group B, low-dose midazolam (3.0 mg average); Group C, low-dose midazolam (2.5 mg average) and oral diazepam (7.5 mg average) just before the procedure; Group D, high-dose midazolam (5.5 mg average); and Group E, high-dose midazolam (5.1 mg average) and oral diazepam. Medications were titrated to induce mild sedation in Groups A, B, and C and heavier sedation in Groups D and E. All patients received fentanyl and small doses of intravenous methohexital just before the cannula penetrated the foramen ovale and before radiofrequency electrocoagulation. At least 2 weeks later, patients reported their level of discomfort during the procedure and their recollection of the procedure on a 0 to 10 scale. In another group of 96 patients, 1.25 mg of droperidol was given in addition to the medications described for Groups D and E. There was a statistically significant improvement in comfort in Groups C, D, and E and added amnesia in Groups D and E. Vomiting occurred in none of the patients medicated with droperidol and in 5 of 143 patients who did not receive droperidol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "94": "A Bull Terrier that was continuously chasing its tail was examined clinically, electroencephalographically, and by computed tomography of the head. The dog was also given test treatments with an anticonvulsant (diazepam) and a pure opioid antagonist (naloxone). The dog appeared to be hysterical and dissociated from its surroundings. Electroencephalography revealed a seizure pattern that was most marked over the temporal lobe, and computed tomography revealed mild hydrocephalus. Diazepam effectively controlled tail chasing, whereas naloxone did not. The dog was discharged on anticonvulsant therapy but subsequently had to be euthanatized when aggression developed. Results of examination and treatment have led the investigators to propose a hereditary mechanism for tail chasing, perhaps related to zinc malabsorption.", 
    "95": "Interaction between erythromycin and midazolam was investigated in two double-blind, randomized, crossover studies. In the first study, 12 healthy volunteers were given 500 mg erythromycin three times a day or placebo for 1 week. On the sixth day, the subjects ingested 15 mg midazolam. In the second study, midazolam (0.05 mg/kg) was given intravenously to six of the same subjects, after similar pretreatments. Plasma samples were collected, and psychomotor performance was measured. Erythromycin increased the area under the midazolam concentration-time curve after oral intake more than four times (p < 0.001) and reduced clearance of intravenously administered midazolam by 54% (p < 0.05). In psychomotor tests (e.g., saccadic eye movements), the interaction between erythromycin and orally administered midazolam was statistically significant (p < 0.05) from 15 minutes to 6 hours. Metabolism of both erythromycin and midazolam by the same cytochrome P450IIIA isozyme may explain the observed pharmacokinetic interaction. Prescription of midazolam for patients receiving erythromycin should be avoided or the dose of midazolam should be reduced by 50% to 75%.",

    "103": "Immunocytochemistry is a compromise between maintaining antigenicity and preserving tissue morphology. In the testis, successful immunostaining results at the level of resolution provided by the light microscope have been obtained through use of either frozen or paraffin sections, although both techniques are fraught with limitations. With freezing, tissue preservation is not optimum, whereas with paraffin embedding, antigenicity is often destroyed. These limitations are not trivial and have led to numerous ambiguous results in the literature. In the present study we wish to report the results of immunocytochemical localization of various proteins in testis fixed by perfusion with Bouin's fluid and embedded in polyester wax, a ribboning embedding medium for histology. The advantages of this medium are that it does not require clearing of tissues in xylene solvents before embedding and that unlike paraffin, it liquifies at 38 degrees C. Because of these two properties, the polyester was appears to adequately maintain antigenicity as compared to that observed in frozen sections, yet because it is a ribboning wax, it preserves detailed structure as well as paraffin does. Proteins that were immunolocalized included cytoskeletal proteins (tubulin, actin, vinculin, vimentin) and cell-specific markers: 1) androgen-binding protein (ABP) for Sertoli cells; 2) peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) for Leydig cells; and 3) nuclear lamins for germ cells. Biotin-streptavidin peroxidase immunocytochemistry was employed to determine the specific distribution of the various proteins, and both rabbit antisera and mouse monoclonal antibodies were used with equal success. In addition, fluorochrome-labeled second antibodies combined with confocal microscopy were used to examine the disposition of the antigens in the testis. Results revealed maintenance of antigenicity and morphology far superior to that obtained with paraffin and frozen sections, respectively, they also showed that within the seminiferous epithelium, germ cell or Sertoli cell-specific proteins were unambiguously immunolocalized to their respective cells. Specific observations made possible through use of this protocol suggest that neither tubulin or vimentin immunostaining patterns in Sertoli cells are altered during the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. Similarly, ABP staining appeared constant throughout the cycle. Further, we wish to report that anti-PBR is a specific probe for Leydig cells in vivo and that an anti-nuclear lamin antibody appears to serve as a specific probe for spermatogonia and pachytene spermatocytes, but that the commercially available anti-smooth muscle alpha-actin monoclonal antibody immunostains both the myoid and lymphatic endothelial cells forming the peritubular cells layer of the seminiferous tubule.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Sub-hypnotic infusions of midazolam (0.15 mg kg/min) were administered prior to anesthetic induction in three groups of patients: control group, patients with tumoral cerebral pathology group, and ischemic cerebral infarctions group. In addition to the known modifications obtained in the patients of the control group, those presenting bioelectric activity alterations due to tumoral pathology did not show modifications. In the group of patients with ischemic infarctions, the intravenous perfusion of midazolam induced moderate increase in the localized theta and delta frequency and a lower representation of the beta rhythm which was also of lower amplitude.
