CP was administered to 6 adult patients in a preparative regimen for bone marrow transplantation consisting of busulfan and CP. Three of the patients received PHE and the other 3 \"control\" patients received diazepam (DZP) as anti-epileptic prophylactic treatment. Plasma samples were collected at intervals up to 24 h after CP administration. The plasma concentrations of (R)- and (S)-CP and their respective N-dechloroethylated metabolites, (R)- and (S)-DCE-CP were simultaneously fitted using an enantiospecific 2-compartment pharmacokinetic (PK) model with Bayesian control estimation. DZP had no significant effect on the metabolism of CP and any of its PK parameters. PHE, however, increased significantly the formation of (S)-DCE-CP while having no effect on the formation of (R)-DCE-CP. These results suggest that different enzymes are responsible for the formation of (S)-DCE-CP from (S)-CP and (R)-DCE-CP from (R)-CP. Additionally, assuming that PHE does not affect the passive renal elimination of (R)- and (S)-CP, this analysis suggests that the clearance of both (R)- and (S)-CP to 4-hydroxy-CP (the activation pathway) is increased by PHE.", 
    "12": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) have been implicated in cell proliferation. The aim of the present study was to test the effect of the PBR ligands PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 and the central-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand clonazepam on breast carcinoma cell proliferation, using [3H] thymidine incorporation. We then carried out a study to identify where the PBR-specific ligands Ro 5-4864 and PK 11195 act in the cell cycle, using flow cytometric analysis. We found PBR expression in the malignant breast cancer tumors, representing various levels of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors, as well as in the MCF-7 breast carcinoma cell line. PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864 inhibited cell proliferation at concentrations of 10(-5) to 10(-4) M, while clonazepam (the central-type benzodiazepine receptor-specific ligand) had no effect. In this same concentration range, PK 11195 and Ro 5-4864, in contrast to clonazepam, induced an accumulation of MCF-7 cells in both the G0-G1 and G2-M phases of the cell cycle. The present study demonstrates that PBR ligands play a role in regulating cell proliferation in the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7.", 
    "13": "Dyspnea is a frequent and devastating symptom among advanced cancer patients and is often difficult to control. However, there has been considerably less emphasis in the literature on the appropriate characterization and management of this symptom than of other cancer-related symptoms. The purpose of this paper is to review issues relating to the prevalence, causes, prognosis and treatment of dyspnea in patients with advanced cancer. A Medline search of the literature published from 1966 to February 1999 was conducted. Dyspnea occurs in 21-78.6% of advanced cancer patients and is reported to be from moderate to severe in 10-63% of the patients. The frequency and severity of dyspnea increase with the progression of the disease and/ or when death is approaching. Lung cancer patients with dyspnea have shorter survival than patients with other types of cancer. Dyspnea can be a direct effect of the cancer, an effect of therapy or not related to the cancer or therapy. In addition to cancer, patients may suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, nonmalignant pleural effusion, pneumonitis, air flow obstruction, or bronchospasm associated with asthma. In the absence of lung or heart disease, dyspnea may be a clinical expression of the syndrome of overwhelming cachexia and asthenia or of severe asthenia. Many different causes may co-exist in a patient. Whenever possible, an attempt should be made to treat underlying cancer. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy may relieve dyspnea also in patients who fail to achieve a major objective response. Symptomatic measures in addition to specific treatments for the underlying cancer and/or other pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases are indicated. Oxygen therapy has proved effective in hypoxemic and nonhypoxemic patients. The role of transfusion therapy to relieve anemia-related dyspnea in advanced and terminal cancer patients is still controversial. Oral, subcutaneous and intravenous opioids are effective but underused in these patients, whereas currently available evidence does not support the clinical use of nebulized opioids. While benzodiazepines are frequently used in patients with dyspnea, these drugs were ineffective in four out of five randomized controlled trials. Other components of the symptom expression are better managed by supportive counseling, occupational therapy or physiotherapy. While the mechanism of breathing and the consequences of different pathologic conditions for both respiratory function and gas exchange are well known, the genesis and pathophysiology of dyspnea as a symptom are much less well understood. Palliative care assessment should be focused on dyspnea as a symptom rather than on the functional and gas exchange abnormalities. Increased research on the appropriate management of dyspnea is needed.",

    "15": "We examined the effects of an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, nilvadipine (0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg), and that of a T-type Ca2+ channel blocker, flunarizine (10.0 and 40.0 mg/kg), on the hypnotic potency of both a benzodiazepine (BZ)-hypnotic, triazolam (1.0 mg/kg), and a non-BZ hypnotic, zolpidem (20.0 mg/kg), in rats. The polysomnogram was recorded for 6 h after administration of the vehicle solution alone, or after one of the Ca2+ channel blockers, with or without one of the hypnotics. Both Ca2+ channel blockers prolonged the increased total time of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep induced by either hypnotic. In the case of triazolam, however, the non-REM sleep-enhancing effect induced by nilvadipine was greater than that induced by flunarizine. These findings indicate that the hypnotic action of triazolam is potentiated more strongly by an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker than by a T-type Ca2+ channel blocker.", 
    "16": "The introduction of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine and sertindole for the treatment of schizophrenia has coincided with an increased awareness of the potential of drug-drug interactions, particularly involving the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. The current literature describing the pharmacokinetics of the metabolism of these agents, including their potential to influence the metabolism of other medications, is reviewed. Clozapine appears to be metabolized primarily by CYP1A2 and CYP3A4, with additional contributions by CYP2C19 and CYP2D6. In addition, clozapine may inhibit the activity of CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and induce CYP1A, CYP2B and CYP3A. Risperidone is metabolized by CYP2D6, and possibly CYP3A4. In vitro data indicate that olanzapine is metabolized by CYP1A2 and CYP2D6. Quetiapine is metabolised by CYP3A4 and sertindole by CYP2D6. There is, however, a general paucity of in vivo data regarding the metabolism of the atypical antipsychotics, indicating a need for further research in this area.", 
    "17": "This study was carried out to identify subtypes of dopamine D2-like receptors in guinea pig isolated vas deferens. Dopamine had no effect on the muscle tone in the presence of prazosin, an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist. However, contractile responses to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), noradrenaline and acetylcholine were potentiated in a concentration dependent manner by dopamine in the presence of prazosin. This potentiation was not inhibited by raclopride, an antagonist for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. However, the potentiation of ATP- and noradrenaline-induced contraction was inhibited by clozapine and 8-methyl-6-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-11H-pyrido[2,3b][1,4]benzodiazepine (JL-18), dopamine D4 receptor antagonists. Further, the potentiation of noradrenaline- and acetylcholine-induced contraction was also inhibited by spiperone, an antagonist for dopamine D2, D3 and D4 receptors. These results suggest that the dopamine D4 receptor is located on the postsynaptic site of guinea pig vas deferens and that activation of the dopamine D4 receptor enhances contractile responses to agonists without affecting muscle tone.",

    "26": "The pharmacokinetics of alprazolam (ALP) after i.v. and p.o. administration in rats were characterized. ALP decayed biexponentially after the i.v. dose (1.25 mg/kg), but the concentration-time profiles after the p.o. doses (7 and 12.5 mg/kg) exhibited a double-peak phenomenon. The presence of two peaks was confirmed by statistical analysis of the serum concentration data of ALP, as well as by observed double peaks in the serum concentration-time profiles of the two active metabolites (alpha-hydroxyalprazolam and 4-hydroxyalprazolam). An absorption model incorporating a delay site is proposed to describe the data, and the absolute oral bioavailability is estimated to be about 30%. The two peaks were approximately 80 to 115 min apart, and there was a delay in the absorption of close to 80% of oral ALP, regardless of dose. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying the double-peak phenomenon is due to reduction in gastric motility caused by the muscle relaxant effect of ALP. This hypothesis is supported by the observed longer delay in the appearance of the second peak at the higher p.o. dose. Enterohepatic recycling is precluded from being the underlying mechanism, because of the presence of double peaks after the p.o. doses but not after the i.v. dose. This is the first reported case of double peaks for oral ALP, and this phenomenon has not been reported for other benzodiazepines. The double-peak phenomenon caused by the hypothesized mechanism may have important therapeutic and drug interaction implications, especially because benzodiazepines are commonly coadministered with other drugs.", 
    "27": "Status epilepticus (SE) treatment should proceed on four fronts: termination of SE, prevention of recurrence, management of potential precipitating causes, and management of SE complications and underlying conditions. The intensity of the treatment should reflect the risk to the patient from SE, and drugs likely to depress respiration and blood pressure should initially be avoided. The Veterans Administration cooperative trial showed that when treating overt SE, first-line treatment success rates were: lorazepam 64.9%; phenobarbital 58.2%; diazepam/phenytoin 55.8%; and phenytoin alone 43.6%. The aggregate response rate to second-line agents for patients who did not respond to first-line agents was 7.0%, and it was 2.3% for third-line agents, raising the question of the efficacy of a second and third drug. The recommended treatment for generalized convulsive SE is to begin with lorazepam. As a second-line agent, phenytoin or fosphenytoin, is still recommended if SE control is not achieved within 5 to 7 min. Fosphenytoin achieves a free phenytoin level of about 2 micro/mL in 15 min, as opposed to 25 min with phenytoin itself. Moreover, fosphenytoin is safer and, despite higher cost, it may be cost-effective. High-dose barbiturates, high-dose benzodiazepines, and propofol are employed for major treatment for refractory SE. Patients at this stage should undergo continuous electroencephalogram monitoring. Once SE is controlled, prevention of seizure recurrence should be individualized to each patient. The major complications of generalized convulsive SE (GCSE), rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia, should be watched for and treated.", 
    "28": "Status epilepticus (SE) is associated with both acute and permanent pathological sequellae. One common long term consequence of SE is the subsequent development of a chronic epileptic condition, with seizures frequently originating from and involving the limbic system. Following SE, many studies have demonstrated selective loss of neurons within the hilar region of the dentate gyrus, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons. Selective loss of distinct subpopulations of interneurons throughout the hippocampus is also frequently evident, although interneurons as a whole are selectively spared relative to principal cells. Accompanying this loss of neurons are circuit rearrangements, the most widely studied being the sprouting of dentate granule cell (DGC) axons back onto the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, termed mossy fiber sprouting. Less studied are the receptor properties of the surviving neurons within the epileptic hippocampus following SE. DGCs in epileptic animals exhibit marked alterations in the functional and pharmacological properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. DGCs have a significantly elevated density of GABA(A) receptors in chronically epileptic animals. In addition, the pharmacological properties of GABA(A) receptors in post-SE epileptic animals are quite different compared to controls. In particular, GABA(A) receptors in DGCs from epileptic animals show an enhanced sensitivity to blockade by zinc, and a markedly altered sensitivity to modulation by benzodiazepines. These pharmacological differences may be due to a decreased expression of alpha1 subunits of the GABA(A) receptor relative to other alpha subunits in DGCs of post-SE epileptic animals. These GABA(A) receptor alterations precede the onset of spontaneous seizures in post-SE DGCs, and so are temporally positioned to contribute to the process of epileptogenesis in the limbic system. The presence of zinc sensitive GABA receptors combined with the presence of zinc-containing \"sprouted\" mossy fiber terminals innervating the proximal dendrites of DGCs in the post-SE epileptic hippocampus prompted the development of the hypothesis that repetitive activation of the DG in the epileptic brain could result in the release of zine. This zinc in turn may diffuse to and block \"epileptic\" zinc-sensitive GABA(A) receptors in DGCs, leading to a catastrophic failure of inhibition and concomitant enhanced seizure propensity in the post-SE epileptic limbic system.", 
    "29": "The critical, fundamental mechanisms that determine the emergence of status epilepticus from a single seizure and the prolonged duration of status epilepticus are uncertain. However, several general concepts of the pathophysiology of status epilepticus have emerged: (a) the hippocampus is consistently activated during status epilepticus; (b) loss of GABA-mediated inhibitory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus is critical for emergence of status epilepticus; and, finally (c) glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission is important in sustaining status epilepticus. This review focuses on the alteration of GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus that occurs during the prolonged seizures of status epilepticus. If reduction in GABAergic inhibition leads to development of status epilepticus, enhancement of GABAergic inhibition would be expected to interrupt status epilepticus. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates are both used in the treatment of status epilepticus and both drugs enhance GABA(A) receptor-mediated inhibition. However, patients often become refractory to benzodiazepines when seizures are prolonged, and barbiturates are often then used for these refractory cases of status epilepticus. Recent evidence suggests the presence of multiple GABA(A) receptor isoforms in the hippocampus with different sensitivity to benzodiazepines but similar sensitivity to barbiturates, thus explaining why the two drug classes might have different clinical effects. In addition, rapid functional plasticity of GABA(A) receptors has been demonstrated to occur during status epilepticus in rats. During status epilepticus, there was a substantial reduction of diazepam potency for termination of the seizures. The loss of sensitivity of the animals to diazepam during status epilepticus was accompanied by an alteration in the functional properties of hippocampal dentate granule cell GABA(A) receptors. Dentate granule cell GABA(A) receptor currents from rats undergoing status epilepticus had reduced sensitivity to diazepam and zinc but normal sensitivity to GABA and pentobarbital. Therefore, the prolonged seizures of status epilepticus rapidly altered the functional properties of hippocampal dentate granule cell GABA(A) receptors, possibly explaining why benzodiazepines and barbiturates may not be equally effective during treatment of the prolonged seizures of status epilepticus. A comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular events leading to the development, maintenance, and cytotoxicity of status epilepticus should permit development of more effective treatment strategies and reduction in the mortality and morbidity of status epilepticus.", 
    "30": "The effects of midazolam (MDZ) treatment during 120 days have been studied in 2 groups of young and old Wistar rats: (50 animals two months, 50 aged 24 months). 20 rats of both groups got 1 mg/kg of MDZ daily, 20 3 mg/kg, and finally 10, animals 1 ml saline all administered by gastric intubation. The general effects of MDZ (mortality, weight changes and memory of an aversive stimuli showed no significant differences with the controls either in young or old rats. In the hippocampus, the total count of neurons gave no significant differences compared to controls. However, in the group of old rats a higher number of dark and pycnotic cells, principally in those rats treated with 3 mg/kg of MDZ was observed. The global area of the CA1, CA4 fields and of the GD was significant reduced in comparison with the controls. These results favour the conclusion that the MDZ has a minimal neurotoxicity: only the group of old rats treated with 3 mg/kg showed weak signs of hippocampal effects.",

The procedure involves a fast extraction of the drugs from the plasma spiked with an internal standard. The samples are applied to a pre-packed glass column and drugs are eluted using ethyl acetate. A linear response was observed over the examined concentration range. The lower limit of detection of 2,3-BZ 6 was 5.5 ng/ml.

    "32": "In vitro studies using isolated cells, mitochondria and submitochondrial fractions demonstrated that in steroid synthesizing cells, the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, preferentially located in the outer/inner membrane contact sites, involved in the regulation of cholesterol transport from the outer to the inner mitochondrial membrane, the rate-determining step in steroid biosynthesis. Mitochondrial PBR ligand binding characteristics and topography are sensitive to hormone treatment suggesting a role of PBR in the regulation of hormone-mediated steroidogenesis. Targeted disruption of the PBR gene in Leydig cells in vitro resulted in the arrest of cholesterol transport into mitochondria and steroid formation; transfection of the mutant cells with a PBR cDNA rescued steroidogenesis demonstrating an obligatory role for PBR in cholesterol transport. Molecular modeling of PBR suggested that it might function as a channel for cholesterol. This hypothesis was tested in a bacterial system devoid of PBR and cholesterol. Cholesterol uptake and transport by these cells was induced upon PBR expression. Amino acid deletion followed by site-directed mutagenesis studies and expression of mutant PBRs demonstrated the presence in the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminus of the receptor of a cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus sequence. This amino acid sequence may help for recruiting the cholesterol coming from intracellular sites to the mitochondria.", 
    "33": "The aim of this study was to evaluate rifabutin (RBT) and rifampicin (RIF) capabilities in inducing various xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such as cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and UDP-glucuronosyl-transferases (UGTs) in cultured fresh and cryopreserved human hepatocytes. Enzyme induction was assessed through the use of several diagnostic markers, i.e. testosterone, midazolam (MDZ), diazepam (DZP) and 7-ethoxyresorufin for CYP-dependent enzyme reactions; and AZT for UGT-dependent enzyme reactions. RBT concentrations (0.118, 0.708 microM) were selected according to previously published pharmacokinetic data in patients. The known CYP3A4 inducer in humans, RIF, was used as a positive control. At the concentrations used, no sign of cytotoxicity was evidenced. Both compounds were able to dose-dependently induce the overall metabolism of testosterone (approximately 2-fold for RBT, 4-fold for RIF) and the formation of the 6beta-hydroxylated-derivative (up to approximately 4-fold over control for RBT and approximately 10-fold for RIF), which is CYP3A4 dependent. The other hydroxylated metabolites (16alpha-OH and 2alpha-OH) were also enhanced. The metabolism of MDZ, which is specifically metabolized by CYP3A4 in humans, was also investigated following drug's exposure to hepatocytes. DZP one, which is governed by various CYPs, including CYP3A, was also investigated. RBT was shown to increase the biotransformation of both benzodiazepines (approximately 1.9-fold over control). Moreover, the effects of both drugs on ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity (EROD), which is representative of CYPIA1/2 isoforms, were tested. Results showed only a moderate induction of this marker (approximately 2-fold over control) when compared to the high effect observed after hepatocyte exposure to 3-methylcholantene (approximately 14-fold over control). Finally, the action of RBT and RIF on UGTs expression was investigated by using AZT as diagnostic substrate: glucuronides formation was not significantly affected by the two rifamycin derivatives. On the whole, exposure of fresh or cryopreserved human hepatocytes to RBT dose-dependently affected the levels of drug metabolizing enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. However, as already demonstrated by in vivo pharmacokinetic studies, its inducing properties towards CYPs, CYP3A in particular, are less pronounced than RIF.", 
    "34": "Acyl glucuronides bind irreversibly to plasma proteins, and one mechanism proposed for this covalent binding is similar to that for glycation of protein by reducing sugars. Because glycation of protein by glucose and other reducing sugars can alter protein function, this lead to the hypothesis that the glycation of proteins by acyl glucuronides may cause similar effects. When human serum albumin (HSA) was incubated with 0.5 M glucose for 5 days, the unbound fractions of diazepam and warfarin were increased by 41 and 35%, respectively, less than that caused by glucuronic acid which increased the unbound fractions by 90% for diazepam and 420% for warfarin. When HSA was incubated with suprofen glucuronide (SG) at a much lower concentration of 0.005 M for only 24 h, the effects on the unbound fractions of diazepam and warfarin to HSA were altered dramatically with increases of 340 and 230%, respectively. After incubation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) with 0.5 or 1 M reducing sugars for 14 days, the enzyme activity decreased to 82 and 61% of initial levels at day 14, respectively, whereas glucuronic acid almost completely inactivated the enzyme activity over the same period. Even at a very low concentration (0.005 M) of SG, SOD activity was reduced significantly to 11% of initial levels by day 14, which was comparable to the effect by 0.5 and 1.0 M concentrations of glucuronic acid. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and matrix associated laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry indicated that several equivalents of reducing sugars or SG became attached to albumin after incubation. These results suggest that acyl glucuronides may affect the function of proteins by the formation of glycated protein in vivo and may be associated with the toxicity of xenobiotics metabolized to labile acyl glucuronides.", 
    "35": "Although primate studies have yielded models of aggressive behaviors that clinicians encounter in their clinical practice, further studies need to be performed to establish insights into the biological mechanisms that underlie these behaviors. Nonetheless, studies of aggression in rhesus monkeys point to 2 chief categories of aggression--defensive and offensive--and suggest differing underlying neural mechanisms for these types of behaviors. Defensive aggression is fear motivated and related to extreme asymmetric right frontal activity in the brain and high plasma cortisol concentrations. On the other hand, offensive and/or impulsive aggression is associated with low serotonergic activity in the central nervous system, high levels of testosterone, and lower levels of cortisol. Moreover, all forms of aggression in rhesus monkeys appear to be modulated by environmental factors, and marked disruptions to the mother-infant relationship likely confer increased risk.", 
    "36": "Agitation is a troublesome, common symptom in major depression that can be difficult to manage. It is sometimes a side effect of antidepressant treatment and may occasionally represent a mixed bipolar episode. If agitation fails to respond to an antidepressant alone, treatment may be augmented with a benzodiazepine, a neuroleptic, or lithium. Preliminary evidence indicates that divalproex, which has been found useful for bipolar disorder and for agitation associated with Alzheimer's disease, may also be effective for agitated depression. A controlled trial is now underway.", 
    "37": "Potentially life-threatening seizures can occur following withdrawal from benzodiazepines, ethanol, or barbiturates. In animals, withdrawal severity has been shown to be partially genetically determined for each drug class. Susceptibility to these drugs is partially determined by common genetic factors, but the evidence is conflicting. We tested the hypothesis that acute benzodiazepine withdrawal convulsions are influenced by at least some genes that also affect withdrawal from ethanol and pentobarbital. Results in inbred mouse strains demonstrate that strain susceptibility is genetically correlated with susceptibility to ethanol and pentobarbital. The proportion of variance accounted for by genetic factors common to diazepam and ethanol was estimated at 69%. Results contrast with previous data obtained in mice that were serially tested for withdrawal severity from ethanol, pentobarbital, and then diazepam, because serial testing of mice significantly affected the previous results for some strains. Diazepam withdrawal severity was also genetically correlated with pentobarbital withdrawal. Together, these results suggest that some genes influence severity of withdrawal from several types of depressant drugs.", 
    "38": "A series of six experiments were conducted to determine the effects of haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine, and phencyclidine (PCP) on rotorod performance. Rodents were trained to walk on a rotorod to avoid a mild shock to a criterion of 20 rpm for 3 min. None of the vehicles of any of these drugs disrupted rotorod performance. Haloperidol disrupted rotorod performance at doses of 0.03, 0.1, and 0.3 mg/kg, and olanzapine disrupted rotorod performance at doses of 3.0 and 10.0 mg/kg. Clozapine produced a much milder disruption across all three doses (3.0, 10.0, and 30.0 mg/kg). PCP produced a consistent and severe disruption of rotorod performance at doses of 4.0 and 6.0 mg/kg, but not at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg. Twenty-four hours postinjection there were no residual PCP effects on rotorod performance. Coadministration of either haloperidol or olanzapine with PCP did not reverse PCP-induced disruption in rotorod performance, while clozapine produced a partial reversal at only one dose. These findings indicate that olanzapine functions similarly to classic antipsychotics with respect to their effects on locomotion and balance.", 
    "39": "The effects of tagetone on flunitrazepam (FNTZ) binding to synaptosomal membranes from chick brains in the presence and absence of allosteric modulations induced by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were investigated. Tagetone, at 50 micrograms/ml (final concentration), decreased the binding affinity of [3H]FNTZ to synaptosomal membranes form chick brain (Kd = 3.34 +/- 0.36 nM without tagetone and Kd,t = 5.86 +/- 0.86 nM with tagetone; p < 0.05, two tailed Student's t-test) without affecting maximal binding (Bmax = 488 +/- 24 fmoles/mg protein, and Bmax,t = 500 +/- 25 fmoles/mg protein in the absence and in the presence of tagetone respectively). The potency of GABA to stimulate [3H]FNTZ binding increased in the presence of tagetone (EC50 values were 2.78 and 1.12 microM with and without tagetone respectively). GABA was able to decrease merocyanine delta A570-610 values in a concentration dependent manner; half maximal effect was attained at a GABA concentration of 34 +/- 13 microM. Tagetone, at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml and in the presence of GABA 30 microM or 60 microM, enhanced the ability of GABA alone on decreasing delta A570-610. Tagetone alone did not change delta A570-610 values. FNTZ, a well known GABA modulator, could also potentiate the effect of GABA. Theoretical calculations indicate that the effects on merocyanine delta A570-610 value are mainly exerted at the membrane potential level (delta psi m). The present results strongly suggest that tagetone affected the function of GABAA receptor in a complex way: on the one hand it impaired FNTZ binding: on the other hand tagetone improved both the coupling between FNTZ and GABA binding sites and it enhanced GABA-induced chloride permeability. Changes in the geometrical and electrostatic properties of the self-organized membrane structure may account for these effects of tagetone.", 
    "40": "The efficacy of activated charcoal alone, and gastric lavage followed by charcoal in reducing the absorption of diazepam, ibuprofen and citalopram was studied in healthy volunteers.", 
    "41": "In a randomized cross-over study with three phases, nine healthy volunteers were administered single oral doses of 5 mg diazepam, 400 mg ibuprofen and 20 mg citalopram, taken simultaneously after an overnight fast. Thirty minutes later, the subjects were assigned to one of the following treatments: 200 ml water (control), 25 g activated charcoal as a suspension in 200 ml water or gastric lavage followed by 25 g charcoal in suspension given through the lavage tube. Plasma concentrations of diazepam, ibuprofen and citalopram were determined up to 10 h.", 
    "42": "The AUC(0,10 h) of diazepam was reduced by 27% (P<0.05) by both charcoal alone and charcoal combined with lavage. The increase in plasma diazepam concentration from 0.5 h onwards was prevented by both interventions (P</=0.05), whereas the Cmax of diazepam was not significantly affected by either treatment. The AUC(0, 10 h) of ibuprofen was reduced by 49% (P<0.05) after the combination treatment and by 30% (P<0.05) after charcoal alone, but there was no significant difference between these two treatments. Both charcoal alone and the combination treatment were equally effective in preventing the increase in plasma ibuprofen from 0.5 h onwards (P<0.01). The Cmax of ibuprofen was reduced by 45% (P<0.05) and by 21% (P=NS), respectively. The AUC(0,10 h) of citalopram was reduced by 51% (P<0.05) after both charcoal alone and charcoal combined with lavage, and the Cmax by 52% (P<0.05) and 54% (P<0.05), respectively. The increase in plasma citalopram concentration from 0.5 h onwards was reduced by about 50% (P<0.01) by both interventions.", 
    "43": "Activated charcoal alone and charcoal combined with lavage showed similar efficacy in preventing the absorption of diazepam, ibuprofen and citalopram. These results suggest that gastric lavage needs not be routinely performed before administration of charcoal.", 
    "44": "In the treatment of manic depressive disorders a distinction is made between acute treatment (combating the mania and the depression) and the maintenance treatment (prevention of subsequent episodes). In both forms of therapy the mood stabilizers are crucial: lithium carbonate, the anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproic acid. The efficacy of lithium carbonate has been demonstrated in the acute treatment of mania and depression as well as in the maintenance treatment. Carbamazepine may be regarded as a good alternative, especially for the acute treatment of mania and for the maintenance treatment. Valproic acid so far has only be demonstrated to be efficacious in the acute treatment of mania. Monotherapy with a mood stabilizer is a first option, but its insufficient efficacy in many patients nevertheless necessitates a combined treatment, with two or even three mood stabilizers or with a mood stabilizer and other psychoactive agents. In the acute treatment of mania, antipsychotics are indicated in case of a severe or psychotic mania and benzodiazepines in severe disorders of sleep or restlessness. Antidepressants have a role as comedication in the acute treatment of the bipolar depression.",

    "46": "The right eyes of 20 newborn rhesus monkeys were occluded with a black contact lens. In seven monkeys each, either atropine or pirenzepine was topically applied daily to the occluded eyes. The nonoccluded fellow eyes and both the occluded and nonoccluded fellow eyes of another six monkeys were treated with vehicle solution.", 
    "47": "After 33 to 39 weeks, in 5 monkeys of the vehicle group, occluded eyes were longer and the myopic shift significantly greater than in the nonoccluded fellow eyes. In six atropine-treated monkeys, axial length and reduction of the initial hyperopia of occluded and nonoccluded fellow eyes were not different statistically. The myopic shift of the occluded eyes was significantly smaller than in the vehicle-treated occluded eyes. In the pirenzepine-treated group, axial length of the occluded eyes was similar to the nonoccluded eyes of controls and the occluded eyes of atropine-treated monkeys. There was a trend of pirenzepine to reduce the myopic shift of the occluded eye. No effect of atropine or pirenzepine was noted on muscarinic receptor density in retina, brain, or heart, but a small increase was observed in iris + ciliary body.",

    "49": "Drugs and toxins precipitate life-threatening acute attacks in patients with intermittent acute porphyria. These materials may act by directly inhibiting enzyme activity, thus further reducing porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase activity below the ca. 50% level that results from the gene defect. To test this, we studied the effects of drugs that precipitate acute attacks (lead, phenobarbital, griseofulvin, phenytoin, sulfanilamide, sulfisoxazole, 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol, 5beta-pregnan-3alpha-ol-20-one), drugs that are safe (lithium, magnesium, chlorpromazine, promethazine), and those with uncertain effects (ethyl alcohol, imipramine, diazepam, haloperidol) on activity of PBG deaminase in vitro and in vivo. In the in vitro studies, of PBG deaminase from human erythrocytes from normals and individuals with IAP, only lead (> or = .01 mM) inhibited enzyme activity. Chlorpromazine (> or = .01 mM), promethazine (> or = .01 mM) and imipramine (1 mM) seemed to increase enzyme activity. In most in vivo experiments, male rats were injected intraperitoneally with test material twice daily for 3 days and once on day four; and erythrocyte and hepatic PBG deaminase activity was assayed thereafter. Effects on enzyme activity were observed only with 17alpha-ethinyl estradiol (0.05 microg/kg/day; reduction of 11% in erythrocyte enzyme [NS], and of 20% in liver enzyme [P=.02]), and imipramine (12.5 mg/kg/day; reduction in erythrocyte enzyme activity of 13% [P<.001]). Rats given lead acetate in their drinking water (10 mg/ml) for the first 60 days of life, resulting in high blood and liver lead levels, had increased erythrocyte PBG deaminase (167% of control; P=.004). Thus, enzyme inhibition by lead in vitro was not reflected in a similar in vivo inhibition. The only inhibitory effects in vivo, with ethinyl estradiol and imipramine, appear to be mild and biologically inconsequential. We conclude that inhibition of PBG deaminase activity by materials that precipitate acute attacks is an unlikely mechanism by which these materials exert their harmful effects in patients with IAP.", 
    "50": "Cognitive function is markedly impaired in most patients with schizophrenia. Antecedents of this impairment are evident in childhood. The cognitive disability is nearly fully developed at the first episode of psychosis in most patients. The contribution of cognitive impairment to outcome in schizophrenia, especially work function, has been established. Preliminary results indicate that cognitive function, along with disorganization symptoms, discriminate schizophrenia patients who are able to work full-time from those who are not. Typical neuroleptic drugs lack the ability to improve the various domains of cognitive function impaired in schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotic drugs pharmacologically related to clozapine-quetiapine, olanzapine, risperidone, sertindole, and ziprasidone--share the ability to produce fewer extrapyramidal symptoms than typical neuroleptic drugs and more potent antagonism of serotonin2a relative to dopamine2 receptors. However, they have a number of different clinical effects. We have identified all the studies of clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone that provide data on their effects on cognition in schizophrenia. Data for each drug are reviewed separately in order to identify differences among them in their effects on cognition. Twelve studies that report cognitive effects of clozapine are reviewed. These studies provide (1) strong evidence that clozapine improves attention and verbal fluency and (2) moderate evidence that clozapine improves some types of executive function. However, results of the effects of clozapine on working memory and secondary verbal and spatial memory were inconclusive. Risperidone has relatively consistent positive effects on working memory, executive functioning, and attention, whereas improvement in verbal learning and memory was inconsistent. Preliminary evidence presented here suggests that olanzapine improves verbal learning and memory, verbal fluency, and executive function, but not attention, working memory, or visual learning and memory. Thus, atypical antipsychotic drugs as a group appear to be superior to typical neuroleptics with regard to cognitive function. However, available data suggest that these drugs produce significant differences in specific cognitive functions. These differences may be valuable adjunctive guides for their use in clinical practice if cognitive improvements reach clinical significance. The effects of the atypical antipsychotic drugs on cholinergic and 5-HT2a-mediated neurotransmission as the possible basis for their ability to improve cognition are discussed. It is suggested that the development of drugs for schizophrenia should focus on improving the key cognitive deficits in schizophrenia: executive function, verbal fluency, working memory, verbal and visual learning and memory, and attention.", 
    "51": "Sotos syndrome is a form of infantile gigantism characterized by excessive body size from the time of birth, particular facies, acromegalic changes and signs of non-progressive cerebral involvement. The etiology is unknown. Diagnosis is based on somatometric data and the particular phenotype traits. Biochemical and endocrine studies are normal. Torticollis is a focal dystonia and therefore more common in adults.", 
    "52": "A 20 year old woman with macrosomic features since birth presented with: weight 104 kg, height 182 cm; prognathism, hypertelorism, a broad over hanging forehead with a high hair line; large ears, hands and feet; torticollis towards the right with elevation and anteroversion of the right shoulder which caused symptomatic scoliosis. She was bradypsychic and rather slow in speech. The complementary tests done (cerebral and cervical CT and MR, bone gammography, evoked potentials, EMG-ENG, sural nerve biopsy, biopsy of skin and muscle, EEG and hormone and biochemistry studies) were normal. The torticollis was treated with botulinus toxin and improved considerably, as did the scoliosis.",

    "55": "Cortical acetylcholine (ACh) mediates the detection, selection, and processing of stimuli and associations, and the allocation of processing resources for these attentional functions. For example, loss of cortical cholinergic inputs impairs the performance of rats in tasks designed to assess sustained or divided attention. Intrabasalis infusions of benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) agonists block increases in cortical ACh efflux and impair attentional abilities. Studies on the regulation of cortical ACh efflux by nucleus accumbens (NAC) dopamine (DA) demonstrate that increases in cortical ACh efflux are attenuated by intra-accumbens administration of D1 and, more potently, D2 receptor antagonists. These and other data support the hypothesis that NAC DA, via GABAergic projections to the basal forebrain, controls the excitability of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons. As increases in NAC DA have been hypothesized to represent a major neuronal mediator of schizophrenia and the compulsive use of addictive drugs, the data predict that the abnormal regulation of cortical ACh release represents a crucial neuronal mechanism mediating the cognitive components of these psychopathological disorders.", 
    "56": "M(1) muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M(1)AchR)-G protein coupling, as measured by high-affinity agonist binding, was examined in membranes prepared from postmortem human temporal cortex (Brodmann area 38) from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 8) and age-matched controls (n = 6). Binding competitions between the M(1)AchR-selective antagonist [(3)H]pirenzepine ([(3)H]PZ) and muscarinic agonists carbachol, acetylcholine, oxotremorine, and oxotremorine M were conducted. In the presence of 1 mM MgCl(2), the inhibition of [(3)H]PZ binding by carbachol, acetylcholine, or oxotremorine M was best described by a two-affinity state model for control and AD cases, while oxotremorine binding affinity was best fit to a single-state model. Although both control and AD groups had similar K(D) values for the high- and low-affinity agonist binding sites, the proportion of M(1)AchRs exhibiting high affinity for carbachol and acetylcholine was reduced by 48 and 33%, respectively, in AD membranes relative to controls (P < 0.05). No changes in the binding of the oxotremorine M or oxotremorine were noted. The nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide GppNHp (100 microM) reduced the proportion of M(1)AchRs with high affinity for agonists in both control and AD membranes. Substitution of 1 mM MnCl(2) for MgCl(2) restored high-affinity carbachol binding at the M(1)AchR in AD membranes similar to that seen in controls. In the presence of 1 mM MnCl(2), agonist binding in controls did not differ from 1 mM MgCl(2). In the absence of cations (1 mM EDTA), no differences between control and AD M(1)AchR carbachol binding were observed. Thus, the loss of high-affinity agonist binding at the M(1)AchR in AD is dependent on the agonist and cation studied.", 
    "57": "Use of benzodiazepines has been discussed extensively both among the public and within the medical society. The aim of this study was to explore the quality of dilemmas experienced by physicians when prescribing benzodiazepines. A questionnaire was sent to 213 Swedish General Practitioners. The critical incident technique was chosen as an appropriate method for surveying professional experiences. Concern for the patient and threats to the integrity of the physician were common dilemmas. The physicians did not believe that the patients were telling the truth or did not trust the patients' ability to handle the medicine. The most frequent consequences of the dilemmas were worry about a disturbed relationship with patients indicating an uncertainty as to how to create a good relationship with them. The participants in the study were aware of the national guidelines for prescribing benzodiazepines, but due to insufficient time a prescription was often chosen as a way to handle the dilemmas. Improvement in the rational use of benzodiazepines is not achieved by the medical board making new rules but rather by offering physicians education in communication and negotiating skills as well as more time with the individual patient who is requesting benzodiazepines.", 
    "58": "Studies of the effects on lower-limb cortical somatosensory evoked potentials (CSEP) during total intravenous anesthesia are sparse for propofol and are lacking for midazolam. This study was designed to compare the effects of propofol and midazolam on CSEP under total intravenous anesthesia during intraoperative monitoring for surgical treatment of scoliosis.", 
    "59": "CSEPs were recorded in two groups of 15 patients during posterior instrumentation for treatment of idiopathic scoliosis. The anesthesia used the combination of atracurium, alfentanil, and an hypnotic agent (propofol for Group I or midazolam for Group II). The main characteristics of the CSEPs (P40 latency and N34-P40 and P40-N50 amplitudes) were recorded using ankle posterior tibial nerve stimulation. The CSEPs were recorded before induction, 10, 70, 100, 130, and 160 minutes after induction, and before the wake-up test. The statistical analysis involved analysis of variance for repeated measures. Both groups were homogeneous before induction.", 
    "60": "Neither CSEP deterioration during risk-associated surgical procedures nor postoperative clinical abnormalities were observed. Both propofol and midazolam induced increases in P40 latencies, with the increases being greater and more regular for the propofol-treated group. The amplitude values changed with time for both groups, decreasing mainly after induction; in the midazolam-treated group, the amplitudes were smaller but more stable. Propofol modified the morphological characteristics of the response by decreasing the late P60 component amplitude; the W-shaped CSEP morphological pattern was maintained with midazolam.", 
    "61": "This study demonstrates the appropriate use of either propofol or midazolam in scoliosis monitoring. Preoperative small-amplitude CSEPs might favor the use of propofol anesthesia.", 
    "62": "The present study was undertaken to gain insights into the mechanism of action of diazepam in focally-evoked pilocarpine-induced seizures by concomitantly assessing the changes produced in the extracellular levels of glutamate, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) and dopamine. In vivo microdialysis, coupled to continuous monitoring of electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, was performed in freely moving rats. Intrahippocampal perfusion with 10 mM pilocarpine (40 min, 2 microl/min) produced limbic seizures. A single dose of intraperitoneal diazepam (5 mg/kg) was administered 2 h after pilocarpine perfusion was started. Dialysates were sampled both from hippocampus and cerebellum and analysed by microbore liquid chromatography. Diazepam produced instant inhibition of behavioural and ECoG seizure activity. Pilocarpine-induced increases in the extracellular levels of glutamate and dopamine in hippocampus were promptly reduced by diazepam. No concurrent alterations in pilocarpine-induced increases in the extracellular levels of GABA in either hippocampus or cerebellum were seen. Pilocarpine enhanced cerebellar glutamate levels only transiently and levels returned to baseline before diazepam administration. No further changes in cerebellar glutamate levels were observed with diazepam. Our findings suggest that the anti-convulsant action of diazepam against pilocarpine-induced seizures is associated with a prompt attenuation of extracellular hippocampal glutamate overflow without concurrent alteration of pilocarpine-induced increases in endogenous GABA levels. Diazepam also significantly decreased pilocarpine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine levels within the hippocampus. No immediate alterations of the basal levels of the neurotransmitters monitored were observed with diazepam.", 
    "63": "Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the mammalian CNS is mediated primarily by the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which, upon binding to its receptor, leads to opening of the intrinsic ion channel, allowing chloride to enter the cell. Over the past 10 years it has become clear that a family of GABA-A receptor subtypes exists, generated through the coassembly of polypeptides selected from alpha 1-alpha 6, beta 1-beta 3, gamma 1-gamma 3, delta, epsilon, and pie to form what is most likely a pentomeric macromolecule. The gene transcripts, and indeed the polypeptides, show distinct patterns of temporal and spatial expression, such that the GABA-A receptor subtypes have a defined localization that presumably reflects their physiological role. A picture is beginning to emerge of the properties conferred to receptor subtypes by the different subunits; these include different functional properties, differential modulation by protein kinases, and the targeting to different membrane compartments. These properties presumably underlie the different physiological roles of the various receptor subtypes. Recently we have identified a further member of the GABA-A receptor gene family, which we have termed theta, which appears to be most closely related to the beta subunits. The structure, function, and distribution of theta-containing receptors, and receptors containing the recently reported epsilon subunit, are described.", 
    "64": "When human glioma cells were incubated for 24 hr in serum-free medium with nanomolar concentrations of 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide (PK11195), a specific ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a significant increase in the membrane fluidity of mitochondria isolated from these cells was registered. These effects were not observed with a shorter incubation time (2 hr) of the cells with PK11195 nor in the presence of serum. Other significant associated changes were observed: a significant increase of 16+/-4% of [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was detected in cells in the presence of PK11195 in serum-free medium, and an increase of 33+/-5% as compared to controls in nonyl acridine orange uptake, as indicator of mitochondrial mass, was also registered in cells treated with 10 nM PK11195. [3H]PK11195 binding was decreased in cells incubated with PK11195; a 45% decrease compared to controls was obtained. In view of the effect of PBR ligands on DNA synthesis, changes in mitochondrial lipid metabolism through interaction with PBRs might lead to biogenesis of mitochondria to support the increased metabolic requirements for cell division, which is even higher in malignant cells.",

    "66": "Lamotrigine (LTG) is an anti-epileptic drug effective in partial seizures and generalized epilepsy. There is growing evidence of the usefulness of LTG in childhood (CAE) orjuvenile (JAE) absences resistant to previous treatment. In this study all patients were identified using strict diagnostic criteria and subdivided into two groups. (1) Eight patients affected by absence seizures resistant to valproic acid or ethosuximide, received LTG as an-add-on therapy, (2) seven patients affected by typical absence seizures not previously treated, received LTG monotherapy after the diagnosis. In the patients with resistant absence seizures, a full control of seizures was obtained. In five of them, after a mean period of 12.5 months, the previous anti-epileptic drugs were withdrawn leaving the patients on LTG monotherapy. In one patient, absences relapsed and valproic acid was therefore added again to LTG to regain control of the seizures. In six of the seven patients on LTG monotherapy after the diagnosis, a full control of seizures was obtained. In the seventh patient the drug was stopped due to a skin rash. In conclusion LTG appears to be effective in resistant absence seizures in combination with valproic acid. Moreover, our preliminary data suggest that lamotrigine might be used as monotherapy in typical absence seizures. The advantages and disadvantages of LTG monotherapy in this type of epilepsy are discussed.", 
    "67": "In France, the legal routes used to administer midazolam to a patient are intravenously and intramuscularly. For anaesthetists, these routes are not well adapted to paediatric use; they lead to pain at injection site and stress on children. The sublingual route should be a good compromise between stress and quick efficiency. We have developed a sublingual tablet of midazolam. The aim of the present investigation is to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of midazolam tablets administered by the sublingual and intravenous routes in 6 rabbits to determine the bioequivalence between these routes. We have estimated the 1-hydroxy-midazolam serum level by difference between RRA and HPLC values. By the sublingual route, midazolam absorption is substantial and fast. The statistical analysis, on data obtained with HPLC dosage, shows no significant difference between pharmacokinetic parameter values calculated after intravenous and sublingual administration (0.5 mg). The absolute bioavailability was close to 100%. With RRA dosage, however, AUCs were greater than those obtained by HPLC dosage (174%). 1-hydroxy-midazolam seems to have a great importance in BZD activity. To estimate the bioequivalence between intravenous and sublingual midazolam administration, it is necessary to take into account the active metabolites.",

    "72": "Noise represents an environmental stress factor affecting several organs and apparatuses, including the cardiovascular system. In experimental animals undergoing noise exposure, subcellular myocardial changes have been reported, especially at the mitochondrial level. In previous studies we found that diazepam, acting at both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, prevented the onset of this myocardial damage. In the present study, we investigated the specific role played by central and/or peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in preventing noise-induced myocardial alterations. In particular, the effect of clonazepam as a selective ligand for central sites, in comparison with the efficacy of ligands selective for peripheral sites, such as Ro 5-4864 and PK-11195, was evaluated. Rats were pretreated with the test drugs 30 min before exposure to noise for 6 or 12 hr and then sacrificed. After fixing, samples of right atrium and ventricle were taken and processed for either transmission or scanning electron microscopy. After 6 hr of noise exposure, only the atrium exhibited significant mitochondrial alterations, whereas after 12 hr both atrium and ventricle were damaged. As expected, diazepam prevented noise-induced mitochondrial injury at both 6 and 12 hr. By contrast, clonazepam was effective only after 6 hr. The peripheral ligand PK-11195 attenuated mitochondrial damage at both 6 and 12 hr, whereas Ro 5-4864 was effective only after 12 hr. In the present study, we confirm that noise exposure induces mitochondrial damage in the rat myocardium. Drugs acting at both central and peripheral benzodiazepine receptors significantly prevent this damage. Differences in the amount and in the duration of the protective effect might depend on variability in the potency and in the pharmacokinetics of the specific drugs.", 
    "73": "We prospectively studied one hundred ASA physical status I-II children, ages six months to six years, undergoing myringotomy surgery. Children were randomly assigned to one of four anaesthetic groups receiving either halothane or sevoflurane for anaesthesia and oral midazolam premedication or no premedication. We found that children anaesthetized with sevoflurane had significantly faster recovery times and discharge home times than those who received halothane. Patients given oral midazolam premedication had significantly longer recovery times, but no delay in discharge home compared with those not premedicated. However, children anaesthetized with sevoflurane and no premedication had an unacceptably high incidence (67%) of postoperative agitation. The use of oral midazolam preoperatively did decrease the amount of postoperative agitation seen with sevoflurane. We conclude that although sevoflurane does shorten recovery times, the degree of associated postoperative agitation makes it unacceptable as a sole anaesthetic for myringotomy surgery.", 
    "74": "A prospective, randomized and double blind study was undertaken to determine the incidence and a possible dose- or age-dependence of hiccups in children premedicated with rectal midazolam and to investigate the treatment of hiccups by intranasal ethyl chloride spray application. Two hundred ASA physical status 1 and 2 children, weighing 3.0 to 15.0 kg, scheduled for minor surgery, were randomly assigned to be given either 0.5 mg.kg-1 midazolam(n=100) or 1.0 mg. kg-1 midazolam (n=100) administered rectally. If hiccups were observed during a period of 20 min after premedication with midazolam, these children were treated after 3 min of hiccups with two short intranasal applications of ethyl chloride spray. Hiccups occurred in 22% of children in the 0.5 mg.kg-1 group and 26% in the 1.0 mg.kg-1 group (n.s.). The intranasal application with ethyl chloride was successful in 100% in both groups. The mean age levels between children with or without hiccups were 5+/-9 months vs 21+/-19 months (P<0.01) in the 0.5 mg.kg-1 group and 6+/-7 months vs 20+/-14 months (P<0.01) in the 1.0 mg.kg-1 group.

    "75": "The purpose of our studies was to determine the effects of muscarinic receptor agonists on conditioned avoidance responding in the rat. Rats were trained to avoid or escape an electric shock delivered to the feet in a discrete trial procedure. The muscarinic receptor agonists pilocarpine and [2-ethyl-8-methyl-2,8-diazaspiro(4. 5)decane-1,3-dione] hydrochloride (RS86) and the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine all decreased the percentage of avoidance responses at doses that produced less than approximately 30% response failures. Similar results were obtained with the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol, trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, and clozapine. However, the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam did not decrease avoidance responding up to doses that produced ataxia. On the other hand, oxotremorine and arecoline decreased avoidance responding only by producing response failures, whereas aceclidine produced intermediate changes. The muscarinic receptor antagonists scopolamine, trihexyphenidyl, and benztropine were without effect when administered alone but antagonized the decreases in avoidance responding produced by pilocarpine and RS86. Scopolamine had little effect on the decreases in avoidance responding produced by haloperidol. The newer muscarinic receptor partial agonists or agonist/antagonists [R-(Z)-(+)-alpha-(methoxyimino)-1-azabicyclo[2.2. 2]octane-3-acetonitrile] hydrochloride, talsaclidine, milameline, and xanomeline also produced dose-related decreases in avoidance responding. Our results demonstrate that muscarinic receptor agonists can decrease avoidance responding in a manner similar to dopamine-receptor antipsychotic drugs, suggesting that muscarinic receptor agonists may provide an alternative approach to the treatment of psychosis.", 
    "76": "The list of activities of plant flavonoids did not include effects on the central nervous system (CNS) up to 1990, when our laboratory described the existence of natural anxiolytic flavonoids. The first of these was chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), followed by apigenin (5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone) and flavone itself. Semisynthetic derivatives of flavone obtained by introducing halogens, nitro groups or both in its molecule, give rise to high affinity ligands for the benzodiazepine receptor, active in-vivo; 6,3'-dinitroflavone, for example, is an anxiolytic drug 30 times more potent than diazepam. The data collected in this paper make clear that some natural flavonoids are CNS-active molecules and that the chemical modification of the flavone nucleus dramatically increases their anxiolytic potency.", 
    "77": "The underground organs of members of the genus Valeriana (Valerianaceae), as well as related genera such as Nardostachys, are used in the traditional medicine of many cultures as mild sedatives and tranquillizers and to aid the induction of sleep. V. officinalis is the species most commonly used in northern Europe and still retains its official pharmacopoeial status although it is most commonly encountered as an ingredient of herbal medicines. This plant is still the subject of considerable research aimed at establishing the chemical and pharmacological basis of the activity which has been clearly shown in a number of animal and clinical studies. The constituents of the volatile oil are very variable due to population differences in genetics and to environmental factors. The major constituents include the monoterpene bornyl acetate and the sesquiterpene valerenic acid, which is characteristic of the species, in addition to other types of sesquiterpene. Some of these have been shown to have a direct action on the amygdaloid body of the brain and valerenic acid has been shown to inhibit enzyme-induced breakdown of GABA in the brain resulting in sedation. The non-volatile monoterpenes known as valepotriates were first isolated in 1966 and contribute to the overall activity by possessing sedative activity based on the CNS although the mode of action is not clearly known. The valepotriates themselves act as prodrugs which are transformed into homobaldrinal which has been shown to reduce the spontaneous motility of mice. More recent studies have shown that aqueous extracts of the roots contain appreciable amounts of GABA which could directly cause sedation but there is some controversy surrounding the bioavailability of this compound. Another recent finding is the presence of a lignan, hydroxypinoresinol, and its ability to bind to benzodiazepine receptors. Valerian is a good example of both the negative and positive aspects of herbal drugs. The considerable variation in its composition and content as well as the instability of some of its constituents pose serious problems for standardization but the range of components which contribute to its overall activity suggest that it may correct a variety of underlying causes of conditions which necessitate a general sedative or tranquilizing effect.", 
    "78": "Knowing the clinical differences of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone would be of benefit for choosing an atypical antipsychotic drug. In order to compare their efficacy and acceptability, we conducted a meta-analysis of published, randomized, placebo-controlled trials by comparing the response and dropout rates of an atypical antipsychotic drug group and those of a placebo group. After a comprehensive search of study reports, the response and dropout rates of patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic drug and those treated with placebo were extracted on the intention-to-treat basis. The effect size with 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) of pooled data comparing the response and dropout rates of an atypical antipsychotic drug group and those of a placebo group were calculated by using the Peto method. The response-rate effect sizes (95% CIs) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone were 1.75 (1.06 to 2.89), 1.71 (1.20 to 2.42), and 3.28 (1.98 to 5.44), respectively. The dropout-rate effect sizes (95% CIs) of olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone were 0.55 (0.35 to 0.88), 0.65 (0.46 to 0.91), and 0.39 (0.24 to 0.62), respectively. In conclusion, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone are more effective and more acceptable than placebo in treating schizophrenic patients. However, they are not different from each other in the respect of efficacy and acceptability. The cost of these agents should play an important role in choosing an atypical antipsychotic drug.",

    "83": "A bacterial homolog of the mammalian mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor, the tryptophan-rich sensory protein (TspO) has been previously demonstrated to negatively affect the transcriptional expression of several photosynthesis genes of Rhodobacter sphaeroides. To identify components of the signal transduction pathway from the outer membrane-localized TspO to the DNA-active transcription factor(s), we examined the involvement of TspO in the regulation of tetrapyrrole metabolism in R. sphaeroides. By analyzing the tetrapyrrole pigments accumulated by resting cell suspensions of R. sphaeroides, we demonstrated that TspO negatively regulates the activity of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase in this bacterium. hemN, encoding one of the isoenzymes of coproporphyrinogen III oxidase of R. sphaeroides, provided in trans to the wild type strain, produced a TSPO1 mutant phenotype by abolishing the negative effect of TspO on the transcription of the photosynthesis genes, crtI and puc. It is proposed that TspO, by regulating the exit of certain tetrapyrrole intermediates of the heme/bacteriochlorophyll biosynthetic pathways in R. sphaeroides in response to the availability of molecular oxygen, causes the accumulation of a biosynthetic intermediate that serves as a corepressor for both specific pigment gene transcription and the puc operon. The relationship between the bacterial TspO and the mitochondrial peripheral benzodiazepine receptor is discussed.", 
    "84": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is common in elderly individuals who are alcohol dependent and who decrease or stop their alcohol intake. While there have been few clinical studies to directly support or refute the hypothesis that withdrawal symptom severity, delirium and seizures increase with advancing age, several observational studies suggest that adverse functional and cognitive complications during alcohol withdrawal do occur more frequently in elderly patients. Most elderly patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms should be considered for admission to an inpatient setting for supportive care and management. However, elderly patients with adequate social support and without significant withdrawal symptoms at presentation, comorbid illness or past history of complicated withdrawal may be suitable for outpatient management. Although over 100 drugs have been described for alcohol withdrawal treatment, there have been no studies assessing the efficacy of these drugs specifically in elderly patients. Studies in younger patients support benzodiazepines as the most efficacious therapy for reducing withdrawal symptoms and the incidence of delirium and seizure. While short-acting benzodiazepines, such as oxazepam and lorazepam, may be appropriate for elderly patients given the risk for excessive sedation from long-acting benzodiazepines, they may be less effective in preventing seizures and more prone to produce discontinuation symptoms if not tapered properly. To ensure appropriate benzodiazepine treatment, dose and frequency should be individualised with frequent monitoring, and based on validated alcohol withdrawal severity measures. Selected patients who have a history of severe or complicated withdrawal symptoms may benefit from a fixed schedule of benzodiazepine provided that medication is held for sedation. beta-Blockers, clonidine, carbamazepine and haloperidol may be used as adjunctive agents to treat symptoms not controlled by benzodiazepines. Lastly, the age of the patient should not deter clinicians from helping the patient achieve successful alcohol treatment and rehabilitation.", 
    "85": "Sexual dysfunction occurs in over one third of the general population and has many causes, including psychosocial factors, general medical illness, nonpsychiatric medication, psychiatric disorders, and psychotropic medications. Psychosocial causes are the most prevalent, but many frequently used medications, such as diuretics, beta-blockers, and H2-blockers, can also cause sexual dysfunction. Sexual dysfunctions occur in many psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders, schizophrenia, substance abuse, and anxiety disorders. In addition, over half the patients with major depression will have some sexual dysfunction. Although much attention has been paid to sexual dysfunction associated with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), many other commonly used psychotropics are associated with a variety of sexual dysfunction, including haloperidol, benzodiazepines, stimulants, and drugs of abuse. With regard to SSRIs, sexual dysfunction occurs in 50% or more of such patients, which is substantially higher than the rates reported in the Physicians' Desk Reference. The reason for this discrepancy is that patients will not spontaneously report sexual problems and must be questioned about such problems directly. A variety of strategies exist to manage antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction, including waiting, reducing the antidepressant dose, use of drug holidays, use of adjunctive pharmacotherapy, and switching antidepressants. Use of an antidepressant with a low prevalence of sexual side effects, such as bupropion, nefazodone, and mirtazapine, may also be considered.", 
    "86": "The present study investigated (1) the pharmacological profile of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor subtypes involved in the regulation of gastric pepsinogen secretion, (2) the influence of gastric acidity on peptic responses induced by CCK-8-sulfate (CCK-8S) or gastrin-I; and (3) the mechanisms accounting for the effects of CCK-like peptides on pepsinogen secretion. In anaesthetized rats, i.v. injection of CCK-8S or gastrin-I increased both pepsinogen and acid secretion. The pepsigogue effect of CCK-8S was higher than that of gastrin-I, whereas acid hypersecretion after CCK-8S was lower than that induced by gastrin-I. Peptic output following CCK-8S was partly blocked by i.v. injection of the CCK1 receptor antagonist, devazepide (-75.3%), or the CCK2 receptor antagonist, L-365,260 [3R(+)-N-(2,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-1H-1,4-benzodiazepine-3 yl)-N'-(3-methyl-phenyl)urea; -27.9%], but was fully prevented by combined administration of devazepide and L-365,260. The gastric acid hypersecretory effect of CCK-8S was enhanced by devazepide (+84.5%) and blocked by L-365,260. In contrast, the gastric secretory actions of gastrin-I were insensitive to devazepide, but abolished by L-365,260. Excitatory effects of CCK-8S and gastrin-I were not modified by vagotomy or atropine, whereas cimetidine or alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (irreversible blocker of histidine decarboxylase) partly prevented acid hypersecretion induced by both peptides without affecting their pepsigogue effects. After pretreatment with omeprazole, both CCK-8S and gastrin-I failed to stimulate acid secretion, while they increased pepsinogen output. In rats with gastric perfusion of acid solutions, CCK-8S or gastrin-I increased peptic output in a pH-independent manner either with or without pretreatment with omeprazole. Ablation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves as well as application of lidocaine to the gastric mucosa failed to modify the excitatory effects of CCK-8S or gastrin-I on pepsinogen and acid secretion. Blockade of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase pathway by N(G)-nitro-L-arginine-methyl ester prevented the pepsigogue actions of both CCK-8S and gastrin-I (-61.8% and -71.7%, respectively), without affecting the concomitant increase in acid output. In addition, both these peptides significantly increased the release of NO breakdown products into the gastric lumen. The present results suggest that: (1) both CCK1 and CCK2 receptors mediate the peptic secretory responses induced by CCK-like peptides; (2) the excitatory inputs of CCK-8S and gastrin-I to chief cells are not driven through acid-dependent mechanisms or capsaicin-sensitive afferent sensory nerves; and (3) under in vivo conditions, the stimulant actions of CCK-like peptides on pepsinogen secretion are mediated, at least in part, by an increase in NO generation.", 
    "87": "The purpose of this work was to investigate the disposition characteristics and pharmacodynamics of a benzodiazepine, oxazepam, in renal dysfunction rats. For the in vivo experiment, normal and renal dysfunction rats were given 40 mg/kg of oxazepam as the bolus dose. A quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) method was used as the surrogate measure of the pharmacological response. The oxazepam concentration in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assayed by the HPLC method. The steady-state volume of distribution and clearance based on total and unbound plasma did not change in renal dysfunction rats. Amplitude changes in the EEG induced by oxazepam in normal and renal dysfunction rats were characterized by a log-concentration response model or sigmoidal Emax model. The pharmacodynamic parameters from these models were not altered in renal dysfunction. In in vitro binding studies for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine receptor complex, the oxazepam-induced effect was not potentiated by the plasma dialysate from renal dysfunction rats. Thus, it was suggested that the brain sensitivity to benzodiazepines was not altered in renal insufficiency.", 
    "88": "Febrile seizures are the most frequent neurologic disorders during childhood. The pathogenesis is not clear even today. Viral infections of the upper airways, exanthema subitum, acute otitis media, infection of the urinary tract and febrile reactions after vaccination are the most frequent precipitating factors. Predictors in identifying children with very high risk of recurrence are young age at onset, family history of febrile seizures in a first-degree relative, a history of recurrent febrile seizures and a lower degree of fever at the onset of febrile seizures. A family history of epilepsy, neurodevelopmental abnormalities and a lower degree of fever at the onset of febrile convulsion are predictors of later epilepsy in children who have febrile seizures. The prognosis of febrile seizures is very good. In the acute situation, rectal diazepam should be given in the event of prolonged febrile seizures (> 3 minutes) only. Intermittent diazepam therapy and long-term antiepileptics are not recommended. The best prophylactic treatment is education and reassurance for parents and children.",

    "95": "Possible reversal by melatonin of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence was studied in mice. A 10-day repeated injection regimen was followed to induce morphine tolerance and dependence. Co-administration of melatonin (1-10 mg/kg, i.p.) with morphine (10 mg/kg, s.c.) during the induction phase (day 1 to 9) reversed the development of opioid tolerance and dependence tested on 10th day. On the other hand acute administration of melatonin (1-10 mg/kg) on the 10th day, ie. during the expression phase of morphine dependence, it reduced the incidence of naloxone-induced withdrawal jumps without affecting the tolerance to analgesic effect. Co-administration of flumazenil (2 mg/kg, i.p.), a central benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist had no effect on melatonin response, whereas peripheral antagonist for BZ receptor PK11195 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reversed the attenuating effect of melatonin on physical dependence both during induction and expression phase of morphine tolerance and dependence. These observations suggest that melatonin reverses development of tolerance and dependence to morphine, and this action possibly involved peripheral benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "96": "Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors may play a key role during developmental neuroplasticity, learning and memory, and neuronal loss in a number of neuropathologies. However, the intracellular signaling pathways used by AMPA receptors during such processes are not fully understood. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is an attractive target because it has been shown to be involved in gene expression, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal stress. Using primary cultures of mouse striatal neurons and a phosphospecific MAPK antibody we addressed whether AMPA receptors can activate the MAPK cascade. We found that in the presence of cyclothiazide, AMPA caused a robust and direct (no involvement of NMDA receptors or L-type voltage-sensitive Ca(2+) channels) Ca(2+)-dependent activation of MAPK through MAPK kinase (MEK). This activation was blocked by GYKI 53655, a noncompetitive selective antagonist of AMPA receptors. Probing the mechanism of this activation revealed an essential role for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and the involvement of a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-protein, a Src family protein tyrosine kinase, and Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II. Similarly, kainate activated MAPK in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner. AMPA receptor-evoked neuronal death and arachidonic acid mobilization did not appear to involve signaling through the MAPK pathway. However, AMPA receptor stimulation led to a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor CREB, which could be prevented by inhibitors of MEK or PI 3-kinase. Our results indicate that Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors transduce signals from the cell surface to the nucleus of neurons through a PI 3-kinase-dependent activation of MAPK. This novel pathway may play a pivotal role in regulating synaptic plasticity in the striatum.",

We report the fast separation of six benzodiazepines isolated from human urine via selected reaction monitoring liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry using short dwell times to accommodate fast-eluting chromatographic peaks. The analytes were extracted from human urine samples along with their deuterium-labeled internal standards by a simple liquid-liquid extraction in 96-well plates. Using four autosamplers coupled to one chromatographic column and one tandem mass spectrometer operated in the turbo ion spray mode with positive ion detection, 1152 samples (12 96-well plates) were analyzed in less than 12 h. Through an electronic switching box designed and constructed in-house, the autosamplers were synchronized with the mass spectrometer so that injections were made as soon as the mass spectrometer was ready to collect data. Each run required 30 s to complete with another 7-8 s for the data system to load the next data file to be collected.

Age and gender have a clear relation to the use of benzodiazepines and neighbourhood differences in the proportion of users are partly the effect of population composition by age and gender. The proportion of users is higher in neighbourhoods with a higher percentage of one-parent families, with a lower percentage of social rented housing and with a larger number of rooms per person.

    "122": "A daily dose of 3.0 mg clonazepam as augmentation was significantly more effective than doses of 1.5 mg and below. Most of the improved patients showed a rapid onset of action within 2 weeks, and side effects were not severe.", 
    "123": "A daily dose of at least 3.0 mg clonazepam as augmentation of ongoing antidepressant treatment should be considered in prolonged depressive patients with suboptimal improvement.", 
    "124": "The effect on clonazepam alone on prolonged depression was not established, and its effect of on severe depression is unknown. High dose treatment was not carried out in this study.", 
    "125": "The effect of various chronic dopaminergic treatments in 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkeys on the brain gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) /benzodiazepine receptor complex and GABA content was investigated in order to assess the GABAergic involvement in dopaminomimetic-induced dyskinesia. Three MPTP monkeys received for one month pulsatile administrations of the D1 dopamine (DA) receptor agonist SKF 82958 whereas three others received the same dose of SKF 82958 by continuous infusion. A long acting D2 DA receptor agonist, cabergoline, was given to another three animals. Untreated MPTP as well as naive control animals were also included. Pulsatile SKF 82958 relieved parkinsonian symptoms but was also associated with dyskinesia in two of the three animals whereas animals treated continuously with SKF 82958 remained as untreated MPTP monkeys. Chronic cabergoline administration improved motor response with no persistent dyskinesia. MPTP treatment induced a decrease of 3H-flunitrazepam binding in the medial anterior part of caudate-putamen and an increase in the internal segment of globus pallidus (GPi) which was in general unchanged by pulsatile or continuous SKF 82958 administration. Throughout the striatum, binding of 3H-flunitrazepam remained reduced in MPTP monkeys treated with cabergoline but was not significantly lower than untreated MPTP monkeys. Moreover, cabergoline treatment reversed the MPTP-induced increase in 3H-flunitrazepam binding in the GPi. GABA concentrations remained unchanged in the striatum, external segment of globus pallidus and GPi following MPTP denervation. Pulsatile but not continuous SKF 82958 administration decreased putamen GABA content whereas cabergoline treatment decreased caudate GABA. No alteration in GABA levels were observed in the GPe and GPi following the experimental treatments. These results suggest that: (1) D2-like receptor stimulation with cabergoline modulates GABA(A) receptor density in striatal subregions anatomically related to associative cortical afferent and (2) the absence of dyskinesia in dopaminomimetic-treated monkeys might be associated with the reversal of the MPTP-induced upregulation of the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complex in the Gpi.", 
    "126": "The National Health Insurance started to refund expenditure on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in 1994. Questions have been raised if a significant portion of benzodiazepine users would transfer to these new drugs when they were described in the literature as also being used for light anxiety, but not carrying the addiction risk associated with benzodiazepines. The study looks at changes over a four-year period in the prescription of benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors dispensed from two pharmacies in Vest-Agder County with a total customer base of 17,800. For four years we also followed the prescription of drugs in these two groups to 1,125 patients who had been prescribed benzodiazepines in 1994. Our data show that only 5% of those receiving benzodiazepines in 1994, whom we were able to track, changed to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-only therapy. 18% used a combination of the two groups of drugs and 77% continued to use benzodiazepines as before. The increase in the number of patients receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors during the study period is far greater than the increase measured by number of daily doses. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors seem to have little influence on the use of benzodiazepines in our pharmacies' area. Our findings indicate that instead of \"from Valium to Prozac\" the change during the years 1994-97 can be described as \"from Valium to Valium and Prozac\".", 
    "127": "The authors looked at the clinical characteristics of long-term benzodiazepine users and how they viewed their use of benzodiazepine. We also examined the effectiveness of a self-help leaflet on reducing benzodiazepine use.", 
    "128": "One hundred and nine long-term benzodiazepine users (daily use for more than 1 year) were assessed. Their perceived beneficial and undesirable effects of benzodiazepine and intention to reduce benzodiazepine use were studied and their history of benzodiazepine use was obtained. Psychiatric diagnosis and medical history were reviewed. A self-help leaflet was provided to 56 users whose anxiety symptoms were assessed to have been under control. We re-examined these 56 users 3 months later on their use of benzodiazepine and anxiety levels.", 
    "129": "The 109 long-term benzodiazepine users used a therapeutic dose of benzodiazepine (median: 10 mg diazepam equivalent) regularly for a median of 9 years (range: 1-40). Most of the users found benzodiazepine helpful and only 11% of them reported undesirable side effects. Half of the 109 subjects refused to reduce the dosage. Most of the subjects still experienced significant anxiety despite the use of benzodiazepine. Fourteen of the 56 subjects provided with a self-help leaflet were able to reduce a median of 2.5 mg of diazepam equivalent when re-examined after 3 months.", 
    "130": "The results are compared with previous studies in Western societies and are discussed in the light of clinical management of patients with anxiety disorders.", 
    "131": "Assisted reproduction may be associated with repeated occasions of surgical intervention. Propofol, which is frequently used for induction of anaesthesia in such procedures, has been suspected of damaging oocytes. We compared in a randomized prospective design the use of general anaesthesia with fentanyl 0.017 mg/kg, propofol 2.5 mg/kg and isoflurane to that of sedation with midazolam 0.06 mg/kg and ketamine 0.75 mg/kg for transvaginal oocyte retrieval in 50 patients with no premedication. Overall, patient satisfaction was not different between the groups. Sedated patients were more arousable than anaesthetized patients during the procedure and experienced less postoperative abdominal pain at 30 min. Despite some movement in response to pain, oocyte retrieval was conveniently feasible in all sedated patients, of which none required a switch to general anaesthesia. A comparable number of oocytes was retrieved per cycle, 10.8 (+/-7.8) versus 9.6 (+/-10.9) with sedation and anaesthesia respectively. No patient recalled any pain sensation during the procedure. The rate of embryo transfers and pregnancies were not different between the two groups. We conclude that the sedative combination of midazolam and ketamine for oocyte retrieval may serve as an alternative for general anaesthesia.", 
    "132": "We aimed to study the prevalence patterns and course of benzodiazepine (BZD) abuse in an Israeli methadone maintenance (MMT) clinic using repeated random observed urine analysis as well as self-report data. Lifetime and current prevalence of BZD abuse were found in 66.3 and 50.8% patients, respectively. It was found that 44.6% of patients who abused BZDs during their first month of treatment ceased to do so after 1 year, while 27.4% who had not abused BZDs at the beginning of MMT did so after 1 year in treatment. Flunitrazepam was the most commonly abused BZD (92.9%), followed by diazepam (54.3%) and oxazepam (38.6%). Most of the patients swallowed BZDs (92.8%), 42.9% also smoked or snorted them while 8.6% injected BZDs intravenously. BZDs were used as self-medication for alleviating emotional problems rather than for recreational or other reasons. We conclude that BZD abuse is a significant clinical problem in heroin addicts both before entering and during MMT. MMT may have a positive as well as a negative influence on BZD abuse with the former being more prevalent.", 
    "133": "The primary goal of this study was to identify demographic and substance use factors associated with violent injuries, accidental injuries, and medical conditions or illnesses (non-injured).", 
    "134": "Data were examined from a sample of 1701 admissions to emergency rooms at two Canadian hospitals. These patients were interviewed and provided urine samples to detect the presence of drug metabolites for alcohol, THC, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, morphine, and codeine.", 
    "135": "Those with violent injuries were significantly (P<0.0001) more likely to be male and have lower incomes compared with both the accidental injury and non-injury groups. About 37% of violent injuries occurred at a bar or restaurant, which was significantly more than 3% for accidental injuries and 2% for non-injuries (P<0.00001). The violent injury group was significantly more likely than the other two groups to report feeling the effects of alcohol at the time of the injury and to report negative consequences of alcohol use (P<0.00001). Furthermore, about 42% of those with violent injuries had a blood alcohol level (BAL) over 80 mg% compared to only 4% with accidental injuries (P<0.00001) and 2% of non-injuries (P<0.00001). In terms of drug tests for other substances, the violent injury group was significantly more likely to test positive for benzodiazepines than the accidental injury group (P<0.01) while all between group comparisons for other drugs were not significant.", 
    "136": "Receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system (CNS), have been divided into three subtypes. GABA(A) receptor is a ligand-gated chloride channel that is competitively antagonized by bicuculline, whereas GABA(B) receptor regulate Ca2+ or K+ channels through G proteins. Recently, GABA(C) receptor has been identified in mammalian and fish retina. Unlike GABA(A) receptors, the GABA(C) receptor is a bicuculline-resistant chloride channel that is selectively activated by cis-4-aminocrotonic acid (CACA), and antagonized by imidazole-4-acetic acid (I4AA) and to some extent by picrotoxin. We report here that bicuculline-resistant GABA responses mediated by chloride channels are also expressed in substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons in the dorsal horn, which receive predominantly nociceptive inputs from periphery. The GABA responses are, however, not mimicked by CACA nor affected by I4AA, but abolished by picrotoxin. Moreover, these responses are modulated by benzodiazepines (flunitrazepam) and barbiturates (thiopental), although GABA(C) responses are not affected. Thus, the pharmacological characteristics of the GABA responses observed in SG neurons are distinct from those responses mediated by the known GABA receptors. These differences may reflect the presence of receptor subunits unique to SG neurons.", 
    "137": "We performed a retrospective analysis of 122 clinical records of 92 male patients with DSM-III-R schizophrenia to examine the relative weight gain liabilities of clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and sertindole compared with haloperidol. We hypothesized that the unique pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents would contribute to different amounts and patterns of weight gain.", 
    "138": "Data were analyzed to determine differences in weight gain during treatment among patients receiving 5 different drug treatments (clozapine [N = 20], olanzapine [N = 13], risperidone [N = 38], haloperidol [N = 43], and sertindole [N = 8]). Measures of maximal weight gain, final weight, and duration to maximal weight gain were calculated.", 
    "139": "Repeated measures analyses of variance controlling for age, treatment duration, and initial weight revealed statistically significant differences between groups on all 3 measures. Clozapine and olanzapine had the greatest maximal weight gain liability (F = 4.13, df = 4,23; p = .01). Weight gain with clozapine, but not olanzapine or risperidone, appears to persist (as reflected by final weight) despite behavioral interventions (e.g., nutritional consultation, suggested exercise regimen; F = 5.69, df = 4,23; p = .003). Clozapine- and olanzapine-treated subjects appeared to gain weight over a prolonged period of time, whereas risperidone-and sertindole-treated subjects had a more limited period of weight gain (F = 2.95, df = 4,25; p = .04).", 
    "140": "Clozapine and olanzapine caused the most weight gain, risperidone was intermediate, and sertindole had less associated weight gain than haloperidol. The relative receptor affinities of the novel antipsychotics for histamine H1 appear to be the most robust correlate of these clinical findings.", 
    "141": "Based on the structure of ZK91296 (4d), a high affinity partial agonist of the central benzodiazepine (omega) receptor, a series of pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxylate derivatives having mainly aralkyl and aralkyloxy substituents at C-3 was synthesized. The in vitro binding affinities of these compounds for three subclasses of the omega receptor (omega1, omega2, omega5) were determined using rat brain tissue. Practically all of these compounds (except the diethyl ester derivative 22c) showed an approximately twofold selectivity for omega1 (IC50's in the 200-500 nM range) compared to omega2 receptors and practically no affinity for omega5 receptors. Compound 22c showed the highest affinity of all the compounds synthesized (IC50 = 70 nM for omega1 receptors) as well as a fivefold selectivity for omega1 versus omega2 receptors but also displayed significant binding to omega5 receptors (IC50 = 250 nM). The absence of appreciable binding of 4-methyl and 4-methoxymethyl derivatives to omega receptors, in contrast to beta-carbolines having these similarly located substituents, suggests that the pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridine-5-carboxylates may be considered an entirely novel class of selective omega receptor ligands.", 
    "142": "Muscarinic agonists stimulated arachidonic acid release from 10- to 32-fold in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with muscarinic M1, M3 and M5 receptor subtypes. Muscarinic agonists liberated arachidonic acid from the cAMP-coupled M2 and M4 cells only in the presence of ATP. Partial agonists were less efficacious at liberating arachidonic acid than full agonists. The ability of muscarinic agonists to liberate arachidonic acid and stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis in the same CHO M1, M3 and M5 cells was well correlated; however, partial agonists were more efficacious at stimulating phosphoinositide hydrolysis than arachidonic acid release. The efficacy and potency of 13 muscarinic agonists to liberate arachidonic acid was characterised. Influx of external calcium was required for arachidonic acid release even after initiation of agonist-induced release. It is concluded that arachidonic acid release is a simple assay suitable for evaluation of muscarinic agonists, antagonists and the flux of external calcium into cells.", 
    "143": "Rats exposed to the stress of repeated exposure to a noxious heat source (52.5 degrees C, hot plate) exhibit stress-induced analgesia, but reduced antinociception (detected using the tail-flick test) to the administration of beta-endorphin into the periaqueductal gray region of the brain. This is accompanied by an anti-analgesic response (reduction in the stress-induced increase of tail flick latency) to doses of beta-endorphin (0.03 nmol) lower than those usually associated with antinociception. These alterations are prevented and antinociceptive potency is maintained when rats are treated with cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonists intrathecally. The potency of L-365,260 and L-364,718, selective CCK(B) and CCK(A) receptor antagonists, respectively, correlated with their apparent affinities for CCK(B) receptors, suggesting that the altered sensitivity to beta-endorphin is mediated via CCK(B) receptors.", 
    "144": "To discern the role of the GABA(A) receptors in the generation and attentive modulation of the transient auditory 40-Hz response, the effects of the benzodiazepine temazepam (10 mg) were studied in 10 healthy social drinkers, using a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Three hundred Hertz standard and 330 Hz rare deviant tones were presented to the left, and 1000 Hz standards and 1100 Hz deviants to the right ear of the subjects. Subjects attended to a designated ear and were to detect deviants therein while ignoring tones to the other. Temazepam significantly suppressed the amplitude of the 40-Hz response, the effect being equal for attended and non-attended tone responses. This suggests involvement of GABA(A) receptors in transient auditory 40-Hz response generation, however, not in the attentive modulation of the 40-Hz response."
