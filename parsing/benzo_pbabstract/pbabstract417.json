In an unconditioned conflict test, the light/dark box choice situation, melatonin increased the time spent in the lit box as well as the number of transitions between the two compartments. Melatonin was given in a dose range from 0.5 to 5.0 mg/kg body weight i.p. 30 minutes before testing in daytime. Moreover, the anxiolytic activity of diazepam (2.5 mg/kg i.p.) was evaluated and found to be completely inhibited by the specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (10 mg/kg i.p. 30 minutes before). In the same manner flumazenil counteracted melatonin activity in the two tests. Involvement of the benzodiazepine/GABAergic system in the anxiolytic activity of melatonin is discussed.", 
    "1": "This study attempted to identify a specific personality disorder (PD) or PD cluster that independently worsens the 4-month treatment outcome of major depression under adequate antidepressant. The material of the study was 96 consecutive outpatients with major depression. For the Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID) was used. In the material, the presence of any PD significantly worsened the 4-month outcome. The discriminant function analysis, conducted to identify a specific PD or PD cluster that influences the outcome, found that the number of PD from only cluster A and the number of criteria met for only schizoid PD was significantly correlated with the 4-month outcome of depression.", 
    "2": "Although clinical experience points to the frequent use of sedatives and hypnotics in suicide, remarkably few data are available to characterize the demographics of the population involved. The San Diego study, in which toxicological examinations were performed in over 90% of 204 consecutive suicides seen by the San Diego County Coroner during 1981-1982, provides an opportunity to examine suicide victims who were taking various medicines and drugs of abuse. Drugs were detected in 68% of tested subjects. Anxiolytics and hypnotics were found in 10.7% and 12.3% of the cases respectively. Women were more than 4 times as likely as men to have tested positive for an anxiolytic or hypnotic. Antidepressants were found in 5.9%. Alcohol had been ingested by 28.3% of subjects. Barbiturates and benzodiazepines were found in approximately equal proportions, although nationally the number of barbiturate prescriptions filled in drugstores was only one-sixth that of benzodiazepines. Major depression was found in 22.5%; among cases with positive histories of major depression, only a small proportion ranging from 4-10% were positive for antidepressants, anxiolytics or hypnotics. Interestingly, approximately equal proportions (4.8% and 6.2%) of depressed and non-depressed patients were positive for antidepressants. Among subjects whose deaths were attributed to drug ingestion, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and antidepressants were found in approximately one-third each, with little overlap. Although benzodiazepines were found in less than 10% of the group as a whole, they were found in one-third of subjects who committed suicide by overdose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The various classes of IV and inhalation anesthetics all appear to potentiate one another. Many of these interactions are clinically useful in outpatient anesthesia, and many are quite predictable. True synergy is most likely to occur when two drugs produce similar actions by slightly different mechanisms. These principles are particularly well demonstrated by the interactions of hypnotic drugs at the locus ceruleus. It is possible that the reduced anesthetic requirements seen in some disease states may involve similar mechanisms.", 
    "4": "The importance of neuroreceptor imaging in vivo using single photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) has increased enormously. The principal neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, GABA/benzodiazepine, acetylcholine, and serotonin, are presented with reference to anatomical, biochemical, and physiological features. The main radioligands for SPECT and PET are introduced, and methodological characteristics of both PET and SPECT are summarized. Finally, the results of neurotransmitter receptor imaging obtained so far will be discussed.", 
    "5": "Previous reports have shown that immobility time increases in the presence of suspended straws in association with an inhibition of straw-climbing behavior after acute administration of a prototypical anxiolytic benzodiazepine (BZD) such as diazepam. In this modified forced swim (MFS) test employing straw suspension, the effects of two new non-BZD compounds were tested and compared with those of diazepam (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg, IP) used in a previous MFS test. After a 5-min test of forced swimming, four straws were suspended just above the surface of the water and subsequently the straw-climbing trials were counted for 5 min as an index of escape behaviors induced by negative emotionality (stress and/or anxiety). Rats were injected IP with either saline, buspirone HCl (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg), or a related compound, SM-3997 (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg), 30 min before testing. At lower doses, both buspirone (0.5, 1 mg/kg) and SM-3997 (5, 10 mg/kg) reduced the duration of immobility, as opposed to that of diazepam. Conversely, buspirone at the highest dose of 5 mg/kg significantly prolonged the duration of immobility, and SM-3997 at 20 mg/kg also prolonged its duration, indicating a biphasic effects. All doses of buspirone and SM-3997 inhibited straw-climbing counts, in the same manner as diazepam. These results suggest that buspirone may possess relatively weak and/or atypical anxiolytic effects at lower doses, whereas at 5 mg/kg this compound may have an anxiolytic effect. In addition, SM-3997 may be a less potent anxiolytic drug than buspirone in the MFS test following a single-injection protocol.", 
    "6": "Contradictory evidence exists concerning the anxiolytic effects of 5-HT1A agonists in the conflict test. In the present work, a modification of the Vogel conflict model was used to assess different doses of diazepam (0.1-5.6 mg/kg), ipsapirone (1.0-17.8 mg/kg), buspirone (1.7-17.8 mg/kg), and indorenate (0.56-17.8 mg/kg) in rats receiving two different electric shock intensities (0.16 and 0.32 mA). The results show that the three 5-HT1A agonists had a smaller anticonflict effect than diazepam. The anticonflict effect with each compound was of a greater magnitude at 0.16 mA intensity than at 0.32 mA. This study shows that, using different electric shock intensities, compounds produce a differential effect: the anticonflict effects were more pronounced with the lower electric shock intensity than with the higher intensity. The present results suggest that the use of different shock intensities can play distinct roles over the drug's effect in the conflict test.",

    "8": "Several endogenous brain substances which inhibit [3H]muscimol binding were isolated, and one of them has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification involved the extraction of brain tissue with water, followed by several steps of gel filtration column chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The muscimol binding inhibitor (MBI) thus obtained appeared to be homogeneous as judged from the elution profile of an HPLC column, in which a symmetrical peak was obtained when the eluate was monitored at either 220 or 280 nm. Furthermore, the MBI activity coincided with the absorption peak. The purified MBI is not gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), beta-alanine or taurine since these amino acids are clearly separated from the MBI in the purification procedures. The MBI has no effect on benzodiazepine (BZ) binding or glutamate binding to their respective receptors. However, the MBI is a more potent inhibitor for [3H]taurine binding than that of [3H]muscimol binding. The MBI appears to be a small molecule (< 2000 Da) that is heat and acid/base stable. The chemical nature of the MBI is currently under investigation.",

Omeprazole decreased meal-stimulated S-28 (-67% +/- 8%; P < 0.01) and S-14 (-56 +/- 9%; P < 0.01) and abolished S-14 increases to histamine and gastrin. Intraduodenal perfusions of a liquid protein meal increased S-28 above S-14, comprising approximately 71% of total somatostatin-like immunoreactivity released, and omeprazole suppressed S-28 (-87% +/- 5%; P < 0.01) without influencing S-14. Similar responses occurred after exogenous cholecystokinin. Moreover, pretreatment of the intraduodenal protein meal with the cholecystokinin-A receptor antagonist MK-329 abolished increases of S-28 and S-14 and caused a further twofold increase of gastric acid (P < 0.025).", 
    "12": "In the fed state, gastric acid causes direct release of S-14 from the stomach, but the acid-dependent component of S-28 secretion requires cholecystokinin as a cofactor.

    "13": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the neurotransmitter at most inhibitory synapses in the human central nervous system. The GABAA receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, is the site of action of benzodiazepines, the most widely prescribed neuroactive drugs. It was recently demonstrated that there are multiple subtypes of GABAA receptors. Studies of rodents have shown that receptor subunits are developmentally controlled. The major alpha subunit of the adult receptor is expressed at low levels before birth. This study, using postmortem human tissue, shows that GABAA receptors are present in significant numbers in the human cerebellum at birth, and the numbers rise threefold by adulthood. Two subtypes of benzodiazepine receptors were detected by binding studies in the neonate, whereas only a single subtype of receptor was detected in the adult cerebellum. Comparison to recombinant human GABAA receptors shows that receptors containing alpha 1 constitute 50% of the receptors at birth and the percentage rises to over 95% by adulthood. In both cerebral cortex and cerebellum, a dramatic rise in alpha 1 messenger RNA was observed during development, suggesting that the complement of GABAA receptors differs in infants and adults. These findings have significant implications for normal neurodevelopment as well as for the understanding and treatment of pathophysiological states such as seizures.", 
    "14": "Lanthanum was previously reported to potentiate the GABA-induced chloride currents reversibly by acting at a distinct site on the GABAA receptor-channel complex (Ma and Narahashi, 1993). We now report that all other lanthanides tested enhanced the GABA responses with greater efficiencies and produced inward currents by themselves. The rank order of efficacies of lanthanides to potentiate the GABA responses and to generate currents correlated inversely with the hydrated ionic radii of these ions. The GABA-induced currents were recorded from the rat dorsal root ganglion neurons in primary culture by the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Lanthanides at 1 mM reversibly potentiated the GABA responses (times of control): lutetium (Lu3+) 12.4 +/- 0.1 > erbium (Er3+) 11.4 +/- 0.2 > terbium (Tb3+) 9.3 +/- 0.5 > europium (Eu3+) 5.4 +/- 0.4 > neodymium (Nd3+) 4.1 +/- 0.2 > cerium (Ce3+) 3.3 +/- 0.2 > lanthanum (La3+) 2.4 +/- 0.2 (n = 10).

Wistar rats were subjected to 10 min of normothermic ischemia and reperfused for 7 days. Necrotic hippocampal CA1 neurons were counted and expressed as a percentage (mean +/- SD). In Experiment 1, saline-treated rats sustained 81 +/- 20% damage to dorsal CA1. Rats given NBQX 30 mg/kg i.p. x3 lost 21 +/- 27% (p < 0.01).

    "16": "Clobazam is a 1,5-benzodiazepine reported to have a wide spectrum of antiepileptic activity and is associated with less neurotoxicity than the 1,4-benzodiazepines, nitrazepam and clonazepam. The effect of clobazam on seizure control and neurologic behavior was examined prospectively in 115 children (average age: 8.4 years) with intractable seizures. Eighteen children (16%) became seizure free and a further 35 (31%) demonstrated a greater than 90% decrease in seizure frequency. Tolerance to the antiepileptic effect of clobazam was observed in 30 of 79 children (38%) who demonstrated an initial improvement in seizure control. Complete tolerance was observed in 9 patients, partial tolerance in 9, and partial tolerance that responded to an increased dose of clobazam in 12. Seventy-two percent of patients reported improvement and 26% worsening in at least one parameter of neurologic function after beginning clobazam. The improvement in neurologic function correlated poorly with change in seizure control. Patients who discontinued 1,4-benzodiazepine (n = 37) had a greater improvement in attention span, alertness, balance, drooling, and mood compared to the remainder of the group. These data suggest that clobazam is effective in the treatment of children with a wide range of epilepsies and seizure types and support the clinical impression that clobazam is associated with less neurotoxicity than the 1,4-benzodiazepines.", 
    "17": "R82913 and R86183, two derivatives of tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]-benzodiazepin-2(1H)-thione (TIBO), were found to potently and selectively inhibit the replication and cell killing effects of a panel of biologically diverse laboratory and clinical strains of HIV-1. The two compounds exhibited significant activity in all human cell lines tested, as well as in fresh human peripheral blood lymphocytes and macrophages. One of these two compounds (R82913) was found to significantly inhibit the replication of a murine retrovirus (Rauscher murine leukemia virus) in both UV-XC plaque formation and virus yield reduction assays. R86183, despite differing from R82913 only in the positioning of a single chlorine molecule, was not active against the murine retrovirus but was 10-fold more potent in inhibiting HIV-1 replication. Combination antiviral assays with other reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including AZT, ddC, and carbovir, yielded synergistic anti-HIV activity with both TIBO derivatives. Additive to slightly synergistic results were obtained in combinations with ddI and phosphonoformic acid whereas additive to antagonistic activity was detected in combination with dextran sulfate.", 
    "18": "Thirty-two patients hospitalized for the care of major burns were randomly assigned to groups that received hypnosis, lorazepam, hypnosis with lorazepam, or placebo controls as adjuncts to opioids for the control of pain during dressing changes. Analysis of scores on the Visual Analogue Scale indicated that although pain during dressing changes decreased over consecutive days, assignment to the various treatment groups did not have a differential effect. This finding was in contrast to those of earlier studies and is likely attributable to the low baseline pain scores of subjects who participated. A larger number of subjects with low baseline pain ratings will likely be necessary to replicate earlier findings. The results are argued to support the analgesic advantages of early, aggressive opioid use via PCA or through careful staff monitoring and titration of pain drugs.", 
    "19": "1. The interaction of yohimbine with anxiolytic and putative anxiolytic agents to modify 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release in the frontal cortex of the freely-moving rat was assessed using the microdialysis technique. 2. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine (5.0 mg kg-1, i.p.) increased maximally the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex by approximately 230% of the basal levels. 3. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (30-100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) decreased dose-dependently the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the rat frontal cortex by approximately 0-60% of the basal levels. A 5 min pretreatment with clonidine (50 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) prevented the yohimbine-induced increase in the extracellular 5-HT levels. 4. The benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (2.5 mg kg-1, i.p.) and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron (100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) (5 min pretreatment) completely prevented the yohimbine (5.0 mg kg-1, i.p.)-induced increases in the extracellular levels of 5-HT. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.32 mg kg-1, s.c.) partially antagonized the yohimbine response. 5. A 5 min pretreatment with the 5-HT3/5-HT4 receptor ligand R(+)-zacopride (10 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) reversed the yohimbine (5.0 mg kg-1, i.p.)-induced increase in the extracellular levels of 5-HT to approximately 30% below the basal levels. A 5 min pretreatment with S(-)-zacopride (100 micrograms kg-1, i.p.) failed to modify the response to yohimbine. 6. The present study provides evidence of the ability of the anxiogenic agent, yohimbine, to increase the activity of the central 5-hydroxytryptaminergic system and the ability of clonidine and various anxiolytic and putative anxiolytic agents to prevent the yohimbine response.", 
    "20": "A series of 4,5-dihydro-1-phenyl-1H-2,4-benzodiazepines has been identified as potential antiarrhythmic agents that interact with sodium and potassium channels and prolong the ventricular effective refractory period (ERP) in anesthetized guinea pigs. Concomitant displacement of radiolabeled bactrachotoxin from site II in Na+ channels and of radiolabeled dofetilide from delayed rectifier K+ channels was evident with all members of this chemical series at a concentration of 10 microM. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies using a paced guinea pig model to assess prolongation of the ERP indicated that methyl or ethyl at the 1-position had little effect on activity, while larger groups caused a diminution of activity. Compounds with substituents at either the 3- or 4-position that increased lipophilicity generally were more potent; however, too many lipophilic substituents simultaneously at positions 1, 3, and 4 resulted in less active compounds. Substituents on either aromatic ring had little influence on activity, and phenyl at the 5-position resulted in a significant reduction in antiarrhythmic activity. When two sets of enantiomerically pure compounds were tested in the guinea pig, chirality was shown to be important for activity of 8, where the (R)-enantiomer was the more active, but not in the case of 15, where the enantiomers were equiactive. Several compounds in this series increased the threshold for ventricular fibrillation and refractoriness in myocardially-infarcted anesthetized cata and delayed the onset of aconitine-induced arrhythmias in anesthetized guinea pigs following intravenous dosing. Moreover, these compounds possessed oral antiarrhythmic activity in conscious myocardially-infarcted dogs. Compound R-15 has been advanced for further biological and toxicological evaluations.", 
    "21": "The amnesic effect of benzodiazepine drugs has been well documented, though the mechanisms mediating this effect are unknown. Long-term potentiation (LTP) has been proposed as a mechanism by which information is stored in the mammalian central nervous system. This experiment sought to determine if benzodiazepines impair mnemonic processes by blocking LTP. Rats implanted with a stimulating electrode in the perforant path and a recording electrode in the dentate gyrus were given high-frequency stimulation after the administration of either chlordiazepoxide (5 mg/kg), diazepam (5 mg/kg) or CL 218,872 (10 mg/kg). None of these drugs completely blocked the induction of LTP as measured by changes in the magnitude of the population spike amplitude, though CL 218,872 significantly suppressed potentiation over the duration of recording (24 h). Moreover, the potentiation observed in diazepam-treated rats returned to baseline after 24 h. Two weeks after the last recording, the same implanted rats were given their previous drug and dose and then tested for spatial learning ability in the Morris water maze. Each drug resulted in a severe impairment of spatial learning, but had no effect on cue learning. Two days later, in the absence of drugs, the same rats readily acquired a reversed platform location. Together these results suggest that CL 218,872 may impair spatial learning by suppressing LTP in the perforant path but that chlordiazepoxide and diazepam can impair spatial learning in the absence of LTP suppression in this pathway.", 
    "22": "GYKI 52466 and related 2,3-benzodiazepines are highly selective antagonists of AMPA-evoked responses in rat CNS. However, these compounds do not compete with [3H]AMPA binding and their site of action remains unclear. Here we show that [3H]GYKI 53405 binds specifically to Xenopus brain membranes with KD and Bmax values of 4.5 microM and 35 pmol mg-1 protein respectively. Binding is increased in the presence of Mg2+ and is unaffected by AMPA or kainate. This is the first report of the binding of a GYKI 52466-related radioligand to any tissue and these results provide an initial step towards the characterization of novel recognition sites which are of considerable therapeutic potential.", 
    "23": "In order to determine if functional changes in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and GABAA receptors play a role in the remarkable anoxia tolerance of freshwater turtle brain, we used autoradiographic techniques to assay [3H]MK-801 and [3H]flunitrazepam binding in turtle forebrain after turtles had been subjected to anoxia for 2 or 6 h. The effects of glutamate, glycine, competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, glycine antagonists, polyamines, magnesium, and zinc on [3H]MK-801 binding were the same in anoxic and control turtle forebrains. These results indicate that NMDA receptor regulation plays no role in the adaptive responses to anoxia in turtle brain. In contrast, [3H]flunitrazepam binding was significantly increased in the anoxic dorsal cortex and striatum. The most parsimonious explanation for elevated benzodiazepine receptor binding is that the rise in extracellular GABA levels known to accompany anoxia enhances benzodiazepine receptor affinity. It is possible, however, that GABAA receptor upregulation during anoxia increases the effectiveness of the inhibitory action of released GABA and contributes to the anoxia tolerance of turtles.", 
    "24": "The effects of sodium fluoride (NaF) and cobalt chloride (CoCl2) on the enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic oxazepam 3-acetate (rac-OXA) by microsomal and cytosolic esterases in rat intestinal mucosa were studied. Microsomal and cytosolic esterases hydrolyzed S-OXA and R-OXA in approximately 1:19 and 4:1 ratios, respectively. The hydrolysis of R-OXA by microsomal esterases was inhibited by NaF with an IC50 of 13.4 +/- 1.5 mM. Hydrolyses of both S-OXA and R-OXA by cytosolic esterases were inhibited by NaF with a similar IC50 value (approximately 3 mM). The hydrolysis of S-OXA by cytosolic esterases was inhibited by CoCl2 (IC50 = approximately 5 mM), whereas the hydrolysis of R-OXA by cytosolic esterases was stimulated by approximately 10% in the presence of 1 mM CoCl2. In comparison, the hydrolysis of R-OXA by microsomal esterases was stimulated by approximately 55% in the presence of 1 mM CoCl2. These results not only revealed the effects of NaF and CoCl2 on the catalytic activities of enantioselective cytosolic and microsomal esterases, but also indicated that microsomal and cytosolic esterases that selectively hydrolyzed R-OXA were distinctly different protein entities.",

We explored the involvement of CSF DBI-LI in schizophrenia, based on the potential role of GABA in the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, the relationship of its receptors with dopamine and norepinephrine release, and the proposed therapeutic efficacy of BZDs in schizophrenia. Clinical data, CSF DBI-LI and CSF monoamine measures were obtained in 65 drug-free male chronic (DSM-IIIR) schizophrenic patients, 53 of whom were also tested prior to haloperidol withdrawal. Following haloperidol withdrawal, CSF DBI-LI increased significantly. Drug-free CSF DBI-LI did not correlate with CSF monoamines. CSF DBI-LI was significantly higher in paranoid compared to chronic undifferentiated schizophrenic patients. The data suggest that DBI may have a symptom modulatory rather than an etiological role in schizophrenia.", 
    "26": "The clinical picture of alcohol withdrawal syndrome lies somewhere on a continuum that ranges from slight morning tremor to genuine delirium tremens. The diagnosis, usually easy, may be beset with several traps: alcoholism may be unrecognized, or a diagnosis other than withdrawal syndrome may be wrongly made, or again a complication may be either overlooked or erroneously suspected. An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months. Beside delirium tremens, with its mandatory and well-established treatment, prevention of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and treatment of its initial stages raise no problems, as it consists above all of psychotherapy combined by such tranquillizers as febarbamate or a benzodiazepine taken in well-specified dosage.", 
    "27": "Acute alcohol ingestion can lead to psychiatric emergencies. The main syndromes observed are states of agitation, acute anxiety episodes and suicide or attempted suicide. States of agitation are mainly due to simple or pathological inebriety. Any case of acute alcoholic intoxication requires a full clinical examination and a simple laboratory work-up. Behavioral disorders linked to pathological inebriety can be improved by moderate doses of sedatives such as benzodiazepine, carbamate, tetrabamate or neuroleptic drugs for the most agitated states. States of anxiety generally regress with non-neuroleptic tranquilizers, and attempted suicide mainly requires close surveillance or intensive care.", 
    "28": "Impairment of cellular energy metabolism plays an important role in the expression of brain injury resulting from a variety of acute neurologic disorders. The role of mitochondrial energy metabolism in excitotoxic perinatal brain injury was assessed by studying the toxicity of aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial malate-aspartate shunt, in postnatal (PND) 7 rats. Intrastriatal injection of AOAA produced seizures and dose-dependent excitotoxic injury. The neuronal damage was attenuated by pyridoxine suggesting involvement of pyridoxal dependent mechanisms. The lesion was selectively blocked by the NMDA antagonist MK-801 but not the AMPA antagonist GYKI-52466. Furthermore, AOAA potentiated NMDA, but not AMPA or 1S,3R-ACPD, induced brain injury. The data suggest that regional impairment of cellular energy metabolism is an important determinant of selective vulnerability to excitotoxic injury in perinatal rats. Furthermore, the role of impaired energy metabolism is particularly relevant to NMDA receptor mediated brain injury.", 
    "29": "Rat, rabbit and human serum albumins were immobilized on an HPLC stationary phase, and the resulting phases were tested for their abilities to determine the extent and enantioselectivity of ligand binding to the respective albumins. A series of achiral and chiral compounds were chromatographed on the phases including benzodiazepinones, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, amino acids, warfarin and leucovorin. The chromatographic retentions of the benzodiazepinones and one series of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents were compared with protein binding data from ultrafiltration studies. The observed correlation factors (r) were consistently 0.999, indicating that the albumin phases can be used to determine the magnitude of binding to the respective proteins. The enantioselectivity was also investigated, and the results indicate that the stationary phases can be used to determine relative enantioselectivities and intraspecies differences in this stereoselectivity. For example, when R- and S-warfarin were studied, R-warfarin was retained to a greater extent than S-warfarin by the rabbit serum albumin-stationary phase, whereas the opposite enantioselectivity was found for the rat and human albumins. Binding interaction studies were also conducted on the rabbit and rat albumin stationary phases by sequentially adding increasing concentrations of octanoic acid to the chromatographic mobile phase. The octanoic acid reduced the retention of a series of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, and the results of the experiments suggest that the interaction takes place at two or more sites on the albumin molecule and by anti-cooperative allosteric interactions and competitive displacement. The results of this study demonstrate that the immobilized serum albumin columns can be used to quantitate and probe ligand binding interactions.",

The selective adenosine A1 receptor agonists N-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) and R-N-(phenylisopropyl) adenosine (R-PIA) in doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg i.p. potentiated seizures induced by the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-[4-[[[[(2-aminoethyl)amino]carbonyl]methyl]oxy]-phenyl]- 1,3-dipropylxanthine (XAC). Likewise, the selective adenosine A2 receptor agonists N-[(2-methylphenyl)methyl]adenosine (metrifudil) and N-[2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-(2-methylphenyl)ethyl]adenosine (DPMA), in doses of 30 and 100 mg/kg i.p., respectively, potentiated seizures induced by the selective adenosine A2 receptor antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX). In contrast, the adenosine A1 and A2 receptor agonists both antagonized seizures induced by methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM--an inverse agonist at benzodiazepine receptors) and the adenosine A1 receptor agonists also protected against seizures induced by glutamate. Paradoxically, the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine (CPT) antagonized DMCM- and pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures. Thus, it appears that adenosine A1 and A2 receptor agonists can be both pro- and anticonvulsive depending on the mechanism of action of the chemoconvulsant used in the seizure model. The findings with CPT suggest that other types of adenosine analogues than agonists may possess anticonvulsive properties.", 
    "32": "A sample of community-dwelling geriatric primary care patients were given survey measuring which demographic, medical, and environmental factors predict higher levels of state anxiety, trait anxiety, depression, and comorbid anxiety-depression. The authors used multivariate linear regression methods to predict scores for the outcome measures. Younger age, more stressful life events, increasing medical comorbidity, and fewer years of formal education predicted higher levels of state anxiety. Lower perceived health status, and comparative health status, and benzodiazepine use predicted higher trait anxiety scores. Older age, male gender, benzodiazepine use, more stressful life events, worse comparative health status, and less social support predicted higher depression scores. More stressful life events, less social support, poorer perceived general health status, and benzodiazepine use predicted higher comorbid anxiety-depression scores. The authors discuss the utility of developing clinical models to predict anxiety and depression in geriatric patients. Anxiety and depressive symptoms are distinguished by different psychosocial, clinical, and environmental factors, even in a sample of older subjects, who, by all measures, have good physical and psychological health.", 
    "33": "Effects of naloxone and flumazenil on isoflurane activities were examined on dorsal horn neurons in cats. Isoflurane suppressed bradykinin-induced nociceptive responses in transected feline spinal cords. The bradykinin-induced neuronal firing rates were significantly suppressed by 60.0%, 35.3% and 32.2% at 10, 20 and 30 min after isoflurane administration, respectively. The 32.3% suppression on bradykinin-induced neuronal responses at 30 min after isoflurane administration was not reversed 5 min after administration of naloxone (36.4% suppression). The suppressive effects of isoflurane were not reversed by naloxone (0.2 mg.kg(-1), i.v.). Similarly, the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil (0.2 mg.kg(-1), i.v.), did not affect the suppressive effects of isoflurane. Failure of naloxone and flumazenil to reverse the suppressive effects of isoflurane suggests that isoflurane interacts with neither opioid nor benzodiazepine receptors in producing its suppressive action on nociceptive responses in dorsal horn neurons of the feline spinal cord.", 
    "34": "1. Serum and urine concentrations of enantiomers of pazinaclone (DN-2327) and an active metabolite MII, were measured after single and twice daily oral doses of 4 and 8 mg racemic drug to healthy subjects. 2. The kinetics of rac-pazinaclone and rac-MII were dose-independent and no unchanged drug was recovered in urine. 3. The terminal elimination half-lives of the drug isomers were similar (about 10.5 h), but mean steady-state values of AUC were twofold higher for the S-isomer than those of the antipode (e.g., 8 mg dose: 127 vs 69 ng ml(-1) h). However, the corresponding AUC values based upon unbound drug were similar (5.71 vs 5.73 ng ml(-1) h) indicating no stereoselectivity in intrinsic metabolic clearance. 4. The terminal elimination half-lives of S- and R-MII were similar to those of parent compound indicating that the elimination of these metabolites is formation rate-limited. 5. The R:S-ratio for the AUCs of MII was 4:1. Both enantiomers were excreted in the urine mainly as glucuronide conjugates, with stereoselectivity toward S-MII. 6. Since only the S-enantiomers of DN-2327 and MII bind to the benzodiazepine receptor, further measurements of drug effect in patients should be related to combine serum concentrations of the S-enantiomers of both parent drug and MII.", 
    "35": "The effect of chronic administration of the novel anxiolytic beta-carboline derivative, abecarnil (isopropyl-6-benzyloxy-4-methoxymethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), was examined and compared with the capability of diazepam to induce physical dependence in cats. The acute administration of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (20mg/kg i.p.), to cats treated for 2 weeks with diazepam (7mg/kg i.p., three times daily), induced a severe withdrawal syndrome characterized by the appearance of severe physical signs. Within minutes all cats displayed tremors, increased muscle tone, fear response, repeated vocalization and salivation. On the contrary, in all cats treated chronically (2 weeks) with abecarnil (7mg/kg i.p. three times daily) the challenge dose of flumazenil failed to precipitate a clear abstinence syndrome. In fact, a pupillary dilatation and a mild fear response were the only signs present 15-30min after flumazenil administration. This finding indicates that abecarnil, a new potential therapeutic agent for anxiety disorders and seizures, might have advantages over classical benzodiazepines with regard to development of physical dependence.", 
    "36": "It has been reported that, in animals trained to discriminate ethanol, stimulus control generalized to the non-competitive NMDA antagonists phencyclidine, ketamine and dizocilpine. In the present study, rats were trained to discriminate a dose of ethanol (1g/kg, i.p.) and substitution tests were carried out with phencyclidine, dizocilpine, CGS 19755, eliprodil, triazolam, chlordiazepoxide, abecarnil, alpidem and d-amphetamine. Phencyclidine and dizocilpine produce dose-related substitution for ethanol as did the competitive NMDA antagonist, CGS 19755, and the benzodiazepines, triazolam and chlordiazepoxide. Eliprodil, an NMDA antagonist acting through the polyamine modulatory site, neither substituted for ethanol nor modified the ethanol dose-response curve. d-Amphetamine, and the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, alpidem and abecarnil, did not substitute for ethanol. The results show that both NMDA antagonists and compounds acting through (GABA receptors (benzodiazepines) can substitute for ethanol, emphasizing that the ethanol cue may involve several mechanisms. As all the drugs substituting for ethanol, like ethanol itself, are known to produce ataxia and muscle relaxation, it is proposed that this property may be an important aspect of the ethanol cue.", 
    "37": "Positron emission tomography measured interictal cerebral glucose metabolism with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and central benzodiazepine-receptor binding with [11C]flumazenil in 10 mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and in normal subjects. Eight TLE patients had mesial temporal, lateral temporal, and thalamic hypometabolism ipsilateral to EEG ictal onsets, with additional extratemporal hypometabolism in four. One had unilateral anterior mesial temporal hypometabolism only, and one had normal metabolism. Each patient had decreased benzodiazepine-receptor binding in the ipsilateral anterior mesial temporal region, without neocortical changes. Thus, interictal metabolic dysfunction is variable and usually extensive in TLE, whereas decreased central benzodiazepine-receptor density is more restricted to mesial temporal areas. Metabolic patterns in TLE may reflect diaschisis, while benzodiazepine-receptor changes may reflect localized neuronal and synaptic loss that is specific to the epileptogenic zone. [11C]Flumazenil imaging may be useful in presurgical evaluation of refractory complex partial seizures.", 
    "38": "The mitochondrial DBI receptor complex (mDRC; previously called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors) is linked to the production of neurosteroids such as pregnenolone sulfate, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and others. In order to gain further information as to the function of the mDRC in the brain, we have constructed and tested both in vitro and in vivo a novel series of ligands, 2-arylindole-3-acetamides. The SAR studies detailed herein delineate some of the structural features required for high affinity binding to the mDRCs. In most cases the new ligands were prepared by use of the Fischer indole synthesis. Variations in the length and number of the alkyl groups on the amide nitrogen were probed together with the effects of halogen substituents on one or both of the aryl rings. Some ligands were also synthesized for study which represent conformationally constrained versions of the parent structure. Broad screening studies revealed these indoleacetamides to be highly selective for the mDRC, since they failed to bind with any significant affinity to other receptor systems. Some of the ligands were found to exhibit Ki values in the low nanomolar range for the mDRC as measured by the displacement of [3H]4'-chlorodiazepam. A subset of these ligands was also shown to stimulate pregnenolone formation from the mitochondria of C6-2B glioma cells with an EC50 of about 3 nM. In animal experiments ligands selected for further study were found to exhibit antineophobic effects, in spite of the fact that they exhibit no direct action on GABAA receptors. Consequently, it is postulated that these ligands owe their action to an indirect modulation of GABAA receptor function, presumably by stimulation of neurosteroid production and release from glial cells, followed by neurosteroid modulation of GABA's action on the chloride ion channel conductance of GABAA receptors.", 
    "39": "The role of metabotropic excitatory amino acid receptors in seizures and brain injury was examined using the selective metabotropic agonist 1S,3R-ACPD [(1S,3R)-1-aminocyclopentane-1-3-dicarboxylic acid] in 7-d-old neonatal rats. Systemic administration of 1S,3R-ACPD produced dose-dependent convulsions (ED50 = 16 mg/kg, i.p.) that were stereoselective for the active metabotropic ACPD isomer, since 1R,3S-ACPD was less potent (ED50 = 93 mg/kg, i.p.). 1S,3R-ACPD-induced seizures were antagonized by systemic administration of dantrolene, an inhibitor of intracellular calcium mobilization, but not by the ionotropic glutamate antagonists MK-801 or GYKI-52466. As indexed by hemispheric brain weight differences 5 d postinjection, unilateral intrastriatal injection of 1S,3R-ACPD (0.1-2.0 mumol/microliters), but not 1R,3S-ACPD, produced dose-dependent brain injury (maximal effect of 3.4 +/- 0.5% damage). 1S,3R-ACPD brain injury occurred in the absence of prominent behavioral convulsions. Histologic and ultrastructural examination of 1S,3R-ACPD-injected rat brains revealed swelling and degeneration of select neurons at 4 hr postinjection, but little evidence of injured neurons 5 d later. 1S,3R-ACPD-mediated brain injury was not attenuated by systemic administration of the NMDA antagonist MK-801 or the AMPA antagonist GYKI-52466. However, cointrastriatal injection of dantrolene reduced the severity of 1S,3R-ACPD injury by 88 +/- 7%. These studies indicate that seizures and neuronal injury can be elicited by the selective activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors in perinatal rats, and these effects of 1S,3R-ACPD involve the mobilization of intracellular calcium stores.", 
    "40": "The venom of the Eastern green mamba from Africa, Dendroaspis angusticeps, was found to block the binding of 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate to pure m1 and m4 muscarinic ACh receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The principal toxin in the venom with anti-m1 muscarinic activity was purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase HPLC. This toxin has 64 amino acids, a molecular mass of 7361 Da, and an isoelectric point of 7.04. Its cysteine residues are homologous with those in curare-mimetic alpha-neurotoxins, and with those in fasciculin, which inhibits AChE. At low concentrations the toxin blocked m1 receptors fully and pseudoirreversibly while having no antagonist activity on m2-m5 receptors; the toxin is therefore named \"m1-toxin.\" At higher concentrations m1-toxin interacted reversibly with m4 receptors, and half of the toxin dissociated in 20 min at 25 degrees C. The affinity of m1-toxin is therefore much higher for m1 than for m4 receptors. By comparison with m1-toxin, pirenzepine has sixfold higher affinity for m1 than for m4 receptors. Autoradiographs of muscarinic receptors in the rat brain demonstrated that m1-toxin blocked the binding of 2 nM 3H-pirenzepine only in regions known to bind m1-specific antibodies. Thus, m1-toxin is a much more selective ligand than pirenzepine for functional and binding studies of m1 muscarinic receptors.", 
    "41": "Propofol, a new intravenous sedative agent, was investigated in 41 asthmatic patients undergoing day-case (outpatient) fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The study design was a randomized comparison between propofol and midazolam, which is a well-established intravenous sedative agent. The age, weight, and American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status and lung function of the two groups were not significantly different. Mean (SD) induction dose of propofol was 104.7 (30.1) mg with a maintenance dose of 121.9 (38.5) mg. Corresponding values of midazolam were 9.3 (3.1) mg and 3.7 (2.3) mg. The required level of sedation was achieved significantly faster with propofol, mean (SD) 125.4 (39.8) s, compared with midazolam, 179.4 (55.2) s (p < 0.001). Significantly faster recovery was noted with propofol compared with midazolam in terms of time to recall name and date of birth 2.3 (1.7) min vs 6.3 (8.6) min, (p < 0.045). Alertness scored with the digital symbol substitution test (DSST) returned to prebronchoscopy values in the propofol group at 30 min, DSST score = 35.9 (18.2) vs 13.4 (9.1), in the midazolam group (p < .0001) and was still significantly higher at 90 min-39.4 (17.9) and 23.1 (13.8) (p < 0.01). We conclude that propofol is a useful sedating agent in fiberoptic bronchoscopy with similar efficacy to midazolam but with a faster onset of action and a more rapid recovery. These represent significant advantages for day-case procedures.",

Patients were randomized to receive propofol (10 mg/mL), methohexital (5 mg/mL), or midazolam (0.5 mg/mL) administered at 10 mL/min until the patients failed to follow verbal commands and demonstrated a degradation of the lid response to stimulation. Dose requirements (mean +/- SD) were propofol 1.69 +/- 0.46 mg/kg, methohexital 1.07 +/- 0.34 mg/kg, and midazolam 0.16 +/- 0.06 mg/kg. Hemodynamic assessment at baseline, after induction, after cardioversion, and at recovery demonstrated no difference in mean arterial pressure between the three groups. The time to awakening was significantly prolonged in the group that received midazolam (33 +/- 11 mins, p < .05) as compared with the times of the groups that received propofol (11 +/- 4 mins) and methohexital (9 +/- 3 min). Side-effects were similar between groups, with the exception of an increase in pain on injection with propofol and an increased frequency of confusion in those patients receiving midazolam. Recall of the electrical discharges at one hour after the procedure occurred in two patients in the propofol group. In both cases, there were technical problems which caused the duration of the procedure to extend into the anticipated recovery period. Unit dose costs at our institution for a 70-kg patient are: methohexitol, $3.14 (500-mg bottle); medazolam, $14.88 (5-mg vials x 3); and propofol, $6.60 (200-mg ampule).", 
    "47": "All three drugs are acceptable choices for use during elective direct-current cardioversion. Titration of the agent results in a total drug dose which is usually less than the typical induction dose. There were no significant differences in the hemodynamic actions of these drugs at any time interval. Both propofol and methohexital proved superior in their ability to provide a more rapid anesthetic onset and recovery as compared with midazolam. Propofol offers the advantage of requiring no premixing or dilution, and it is not a controlled substance, although it does result in more pain on injection.", 
    "48": "Heterogeneity of binding affinities for a variety of ligands was observed for gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors in the rat CNS, at both GABA and benzodiazepine recognition sites. Photoaffinity labeling by [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]muscimol to affinity column-purified receptor proteins was examined by gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate. Anesthetic barbiturates (pentobarbital) and steroids (alphaxalone) both differentially stimulated the incorporation of [3H]flunitrazepam more so into the 51-kDa alpha 1 subunit than into the 53-kDa alpha 2 polypeptide, and incorporation of [3H]muscimol into the 55-kDa beta 2 subunit more so than the 58-kDa beta 3 polypeptide. Binding to these polypeptides was also affected differentially by other allosteric modulators and competitive inhibitors, including the benzodiazepine \"type 1\" selective ligand CL218,872. Heterogeneity in affinity of this drug for the single 51-kDa alpha 1 polypeptide strongly suggests that type I receptors, like type II, are heterogeneous. In brain sections, the extent of enhancement of [3H]muscimol binding showed significant regional variation, similar for both steroids and barbiturates, and the GABA analogues THIP and taurine inhibited muscimol binding with regional variations in affinity that were almost opposites of each other. Modulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding by steroids, barbiturates, and THIP significantly varied with regions. Taken together, ligand binding heterogeneity exhibited by photoaffinity labeling and autoradiography demonstrate the existence of multiple pharmacological-binding subtypes resulting from the combination of multiple polypeptide gene products into several oligomeric isoreceptors. Comparison of the regional distribution of binding subtypes with that of different subunit gene products allows the following conclusions about possible subunit compositions of native pharmacological receptor subtypes present in the brain: Benzodiazepine pharmacology of the oligomeric receptor isoforms is dependent on the nature of alpha and subunits other than alpha, GABA-benzodiazepine coupling is dependent on the nature of the alpha subunits, GABA site pharmacology is dependent on the nature of the beta subunits, and several subunits including alpha and beta contribute to the degree of sensitivity to steroids and barbiturates. Finally, the presence of discrete subunits may be necessary but is not sufficient to postulate a defined pharmacological property.", 
    "49": "The binding of [3H]flunitrazepam, [3H]Ro 5-4864, and [3H]PK 11195 to membrane preparations of the retina was studied in the turtle and rabbit. Only a single population of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was detected in the turtle, whereas two populations appeared to be present in the rabbit. No specific binding for [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 could be detected in the turtle. In rabbit, both ligands bound with high affinity, revealing a significant population of binding sites (KD values of 24 +/- 2.3 and 2.2 +/- 0.8 nM, and Bmax values of 440 +/- 35 and 1,482 +/- 110 fmol/mg of protein, respectively). The binding was temperature- and protein-dependent. Displacement studies showed a similar rank order of potency of various unlabeled ligands against both [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]PK 11195 (PK 11195 > Ro 5-4864 > flunitrazepam > flumazenil).

The method has been characterized on the one hand by comparing uptakes of radiotracers during HCO3(-)-buffered saline perfusion with those occurring after intravenous bolus injection of radioisotopes, and on the other by comparing uptake into retina with the uptake into frontal cerebral cortex. The mean permeability-surface area (PS) products (ml s-1 g-1) for [14C]urea and [14C]thiourea in the perfused retina were 1.2 +/- 0.26 x 10(-3) and 2.1 +/- 0.01 x 10(-3) respectively.

A focal lesion at the level of the left cerebellar peduncles could explain the left hemiparesis and right paradoxical vestibular signs. A large encapsulated abscess was found at the confluence of the left cerebellar peduncles. The morphology and staining characteristics of the organisms within the abscess were consistent with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis.",

The elimination half-life of desmethyldiazepam was longer in the Riv:TOX(M) (from the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection) and in the Cpb:WU strain than in the Crl:(WI)BR strain.

    "57": "Repeated administration of the beta-carboline FG 7142 to mice leads to the development of kindled convulsions. In order to investigate a role for glutamatergic mechanisms in the processes underlying FG 7142 kindling, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7; 25 nmol), was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) daily before administration of FG 7142 (40 mg/kg, i.p.). Under these conditions, kindling to FG 7142 did not occur. Administration of two antagonists at non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and gamma-D-glutamylaminomethylsulphonic acid (gamma-D-GAMS; both 25 nmol) did not prevent the development of seizures; these doses were, however, adequate and selective in protecting against seizures induced by respectively quisqualic and kainic acids given by i.c.v. The susceptibility of mice kindled with FG 7142 to seizures induced by NMDA, or kainate or quisqualate was similar in mice which had shown 5 kindled seizures to that seen in drug-naive mice; mice which had shown 10 kindled seizures showed a decreased sensitivity to NMDA-induced convulsions (ED50 was increased from 0.24 to 0.31 nmol). No changes were seen in the convulsant thresholds of either NMDA or non-NMDA agonists. These observations suggest that although NMDA receptors appear to be involved in the processes underlying FG 7142 kindling, such kindling is not necessarily associated with an increased sensitivity of glutamate receptors, and in animals which have convulsed, a decreased sensitivity to NMDA agonists occurs.", 
    "58": "In order to further explore the effects of triazolam on the subjective experience of sleeping, we awakened chronic insomniacs with an electronic tone at five points across the night after having administered placebo and three doses of triazolam (0.125, 0.25 and 0.375 mg). Triazolam reduced the likelihood of subjects reporting that they had been awake by about half. Drug effects were most evident in the period 5 minutes after \"lights out\", at which time there was a reduction in the certainty of the subjects' response; the investigator's ratings of mental activity on the dream complexity scale rose from a rating of \"awake\" following placebo to the borderline of sleep following triazolam. After triazolam administration, subjects reported less certainty about their descriptions of mental imagery. These data are consistent with a hypothesis that during sleep, and particularly at the threshold of electroencephalogram (EEG) defined sleep, triazolam induces cognitive changes in which the subjective distinction between waking and sleep becomes less clear. Several approaches are suggested to determine whether these effects are related to retrospective subjective reports of hypnotic efficacy.", 
    "59": "Sedative and analgesic/anesthetic effects induced by a combination of medetomidine and midazolam were evaluated in pigs. This combination exerted a much more potent sedative effect than that induced by a medetomidine alone, even if the dose of medetomidine was reduced to one half, and even if the pigs were stimulated continuously during the induction phase. Pigs given this combination were induced to sedation smoothly and very quickly. During being sedated the arousal reaction induced by sensory stimuli were depressed profoundly and pigs could be placed in dorsal recumbency without any resistance. In addition, this combination produced moderate analgesic effect and apparent muscle relaxation. This potent effect induced by this combination seemed to be induced by a synergistic interaction between medetomidine and midazolam because the sedative effect achieved with this combination was much greater than that which could be expected from a simple additive response of both sedatives. This sedative combination may be a widely available and valuable for chemical restraint in pigs.", 
    "60": "The mechanisms by which raw soya diets and CCK-receptor antagonists increase postprandial plasma CCK concentrations are not fully understood. Therefore we examined the effects of different diets including raw soya, and the effect of the potent CCK antagonist devazepide in the fed and fasted state on CCK concentrations in plasma and in the duodenal mucosa and on the duodenal CCK:beta-tubulin mRNA ratio in rats. Diets which stimulated high plasma CCK levels, such as raw soya, also gave the highest CCK tissue and mRNA concentrations with a close correlation between plasma and tissue CCK concentrations within each group (r = 0.94, P = 0.018) and between tissue CCK concentrations and CCK:beta-tubulin mRNA ratios (r = 0.91, P = 0.030). Animals fed ad libitum and treated with devazepide (1 mg kg-1) had higher CCK:beta-tubulin mRNA ratios, tissue CCK concentrations and plasma CCK concentrations than animals injected with vehicle. Fasted animals treated with devazepide for 28 h also had higher CCK mRNA:beta-tubulin mRNA ratios (1.86 +/- 0.43 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.15, P < 0.05), and higher tissue CCK concentrations (0.99 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.04, P < 0.01). However, despite these intracellular changes devazepide did not elevate plasma CCK concentrations in the fasted state. Therefore, devazepide increases tissue concentrations of CCK but requires an additional dietary stimulus to raise plasma concentrations. These findings indicate that devazepide produces a dissociation between synthesis and release of CCK in fasted animals.",

U50,488 increased USV and activity levels, lowered body temperature, and disrupted contact with littermates. PTZ raised activity levels but had a smaller effect on vocalization rates and did not alter temperature or contact with littermates. Behavioral measures and body temperature were unchanged by NLX.",

On each experimental day, the following protocol was repeated three times: end-tidal PO2 was held at 100 Torr for 10 min, then at 50 Torr for 20 min and finally at 100 Torr for 5 min. End-tidal PCO2 was held constant throughout. Responses in the three pharmacological conditions were similar. We conclude that neither potentiation of GABA transmission (midazolam) nor antagonism of this potentiation (flumazenil) greatly affect the decline in ventilation which occurs during extended exposure to hypoxia.", 
    "63": "An evaluation study of Syva Emit II reagents using the Chem 1 was performed for the following drugs: barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, benzoylecgonine, opiates, and phencyclidine. The Emit II reagents (100-mL bottles) were reconstituted to 70 mL and evaluated against the Emit d.a.u. reagents. A minimum of 446 samples were run for each drug. For all drugs tested, there were a total of 11 discordant results between the two reagents. The Emit II reagent was found to be correct on 8 of the 11 discordances after retesting by FPIA or GC/MS. The CV of within-run and day-to-day precision of the Emit II was 1.8% or less and 12.3% or less, respectively.", 
    "64": "The application of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) for the simultaneous quantitation of seven commonly encountered urinary benzodiazepine metabolites is described. After comparison of the signal-to-noise ratios of high mass ions of benzodiazepines using electron impact (EI), positive chemical ionization (PCI), and negative chemical ionization (NCI), NCI was chosen because of its increased sensitivity, which ranged from four to several thousand times that of either PCI or EI. This method is novel because NCI spectra for many of these compounds have not been described. For quantitation of benzodiazepines in urine, sample preparation consisted of enzymatic hydrolysis, liquid-liquid extraction, and reaction with a silylating reagent to form trimethylsilyl derivatives. The extraction efficiency of the method was greater than 70% (range, 73-89%) for nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, lorazepam, N-1-hydroxyethylflurazepam, alpha-hydroxyal-prazolam, and alpha-hydroxytriazolam; the linear range for these compounds was from 50 to 2000 ng/mL. Within-run precision was less than 6% for all analytes in the range 50-2000 ng/mL; however, run-to-run precision ranged from 3 to 21%, depending on the analyte and concentration. Quantitation was based on area ratio of high mass ions relative to deuterated internal standards, acquired by scanning the mass range from m/z 250 to 450. Because these studies were performed in the scan mode, if desired, the sensitivity could be increased by using selected ion monitoring.", 
    "65": "The first 1000 cases of tubal sterilization post-delivery by minilaparotomy with sedation and local anesthetic, were reviewed; these procedures were realized at the Hospital of Zona Francisco del Paso y Troncoso of the IMSS, in M\u00e9xico City, during the period comprehended between December 1990 and October 1991. The greatest group of cases by age corresponded to the period between 20 to 29 years in 52.3%. 65% of the women had 3 or 4 children alive. The range of the diastolic blood pressure was between 70-80 mmHg in 66.3%. 19.7% with a value of hemoglobin less than 10 g. 2.3% of the patients with 100-120 kgs. of weight. The contraceptive method used previously with greatest frequency was the DIU in 40.6%. In all of the cases the indication was satisfied parenthood. In 100% of the cases the same drug was used for sedation, diazepam (oral) and chlorhydrate of nalbulfine, with simple lidocaine as a local anesthetic. Likewise in all the cases the Pomeroy technique was performed. The time between the childbirth and the surgery was less than 12 hours in 92.9% of the cases. And the time between the surgery and the recuperation reset was of 12-34 hours in 96%. In 0.8% of the cases the transoperatory complication of the surgery was the bleeding as a result of tearing of the mesosalpinx. The postoperatory complications after one week were the formation of hematoma and/or abscess at the site of the incision representing 0.5% of the cases. All these procedures are realized at a unit that was created especially for this kind of surgery and treatment.", 
    "66": "The first 1000 postpartum tubal occlusions by minilaparotomy under sedation and local anesthesia performed at a Mexican Institute of Social Security hospital in Mexico City were retrospectively reviewed. The operations took place between December 1990 and October 1991. The youngest patient was 17 and five patients were under 20. 52.3% were aged 20-29, 31.9% were aged 30-34, and 13.8% were aged 35-40. 65% of the women had three or four live births and 16.8% had two. The diastolic blood pressure was between 81 and 90 for 12.1%, between 91 and 100 for 8.9%, and between 101 and 120 for 3.7%. 19.7% had hemoglobin levels below 10 g. 37 women with hemoglobin levels between 4 and 8 g were sterilized; all received transfusions before discharge. 66.7% of the women weighed between 50 and 70 kg, but 2.3% weighed 100-120 kg. 40.6% used IUDs, 16.8% oral contraceptives, and 14.2% injectable methods. 24.8% had never used a contraceptive method. The Pomeroy technique was used in all cases. All patients were given Lidocaine. The operation was performed within 12 hours of delivery in 92.8% of cases. 96.3% of the women were discharged within 24 hours. Bleeding, resulting from tearing of the mesosalpinx, occurred in 0.8% of cases. A hematoma or abscess at the site of the incision was observed in 0.5% at one week follow-up. The data indicate that bilateral tubal occlusion by postpartum minilaparotomy under local anesthesia and sedation, rather than general anesthesia, is a rapid and safe procedure, even for obese and hypertensive women.", 
    "67": "Excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms have been implicated in the onset of seizures and as underlying kindling. In this study, changes in responses to single stimuli and paired pulse stimuli were used to monitor postsynaptic excitability before the onset of seizure activity in limbic circuits of urethane-anesthetized rats. With sufficient stimulus intensity, a stimulus paradigm of seven pulses every second for 10 s led to seizure activity, as indicated by the appearance of maximal dentate activation, and afterdischarges. An increase in the evoked response was found in both CA1 and the dentate gyrus during stimulus trains to either CA3 or the angular bundle and there was the appearance of a polysynaptic response. There was an increase in paired pulse inhibition in the dentate gyrus and a decrease in paired pulse inhibition in the CA1 region during the stimulus protocol. Since repeated seizures and a number of pharmacological agents are known to alter the onset and duration of seizure activity, a relationship between the changes in excitability and the onset of the seizure activity was tested using MK-801, ketamine, bicuculline, diazepam, phenobarbital, baclofen and repeated seizures. Overall, alteration of the amplitude of the polysynaptic response in CA1 to angular bundle stimulation correlated best with the effects of the drugs and the seizures on the duration of maximal dentate activation.", 
    "68": "Having examined the options for adjuvant drug use during cardiac anesthesia, it becomes increasingly apparent that midazolam is \"the drug\" of choice and that supplementation with an opioid is an ideal adjuvant. In the hands of experienced cardiac anesthesiologists, the majority of the drugs discussed could provide adequate anesthesia with outcomes that would be difficult to distinguish, with the exception of awakening and time to extubation. Regardless of the inability to differentiate overall outcome, when comparing ease of providing complete \"balanced\" anesthesia, minimal cost increase, ease of use, hemodynamic stability, reliability of amnesia and ability to decrease narcotic requirement and allow early extubation, midazolam is a clear winner. Given as a continuous infusion or a bolus, potent opioids such as alfentanil, fentanyl or sufentanil enhance the amnestic and hypnotic effect of midazolam, decreasing the required dose. In addition, the combination of midazolam and narcotics decreases the catecholamine response that either one alone would produce. This removes the necessity of marked narcotic overdose required when narcotics alone are used. The result of this anesthetic combination is a technique that can be used in the majority of cardiac patients regardless of their ventricular performance, allowing options for earlier awakening, earlier extubation and decreased ICU stay. The goal of complete \"balanced\" anesthesia is best achieved with continuous infusions of midazolam and opioids. Accepting recall of intraoperative events as a necessary evil is unacceptable in the stable cardiac surgery patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "69": "Five adult, male White Carneau pigeons were trained to respond under a titrating matching-to-sample schedule of reinforcement. Under this titration schedule, each trial began with the presentation of a sample stimulus (red or green light) on the center key of a three-key pigeon chamber. Completion of 15 responses on the center key resulted in the termination of the stimulus presentation and the initiation of a delay period. The length of the delay changed as a function of the pigeon's performance. During the first five trials of each session, the delay was fixed at 3 s in length. On the sixth and all subsequent trials, the length of the delay was either increased, did not change, or decreased such that accuracy was maintained at approximately 80%. Following the delay, two of the three pigeon keys were transilluminated with different colored lights (red or green). A single response upon the key transilluminated with the same stimulus color as the sample stimulus resulted in the presentation of food. A response on the key transilluminated with the stimulus color that did not match the sample stimulus resulted in a time-out period. Using this procedure, the effects of two drugs of abuse, diazepam (0.03-3 mg/kg) and morphine (0.03-10 mg/kg), a muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (0.003-0.3 mg/kg), the quaternary derivative of scopolamine, methylscopolamine (0.003-0.3 mg/kg), a cholinesterase inhibitor, physostigmine (0.003-0.1 mg/kg), and the quaternary derivative of physostigmine, neostigmine (0.003-0.1 mg/kg), were determined. Diazepam decreased matching accuracy such that a decrease in the mean delay value for the session was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "70": "The benzodiazepines have been reported to cause anterograde amnestic effects. These impairments are likely mediated through the GABAA receptor complex, which contains the benzodiazepine receptor binding site. This GABAA receptor site is also believed to be the locus of the anxiolytic effects of the drugs as well, and recent research findings suggest that the anxiolytic and amnestic properties of the benzodiazepines may be functionally linked. Normal human memory function is extremely complex and requires the smooth integration of multiple aspects of cognition. On the basis of neuropsychological testing, the processes of memory have been divided into a variety of functions or stores that are interrelated, yet distinct. The amnestic effects of the benzodiazepines have been extensively studied within the context of this conceptual framework. Studies to date have shown that the memory deficits produced by the drugs are relatively selective and are primarily caused by impairments in the acquisition of newly learned information into long-term episodic storage. Benzodiazepines may impair other aspects of memory as well, but findings across studies have been inconsistent. The drugs clearly do not impair the recall of previously learned information, unlike anticholinergic drugs with amnestic effects, such as scopolamine. The amnestic effects of the benzodiazepines are dose-dependent, and can be predicted by pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic variables. In addition, multiple clinical factors may influence the likelihood of memory impairments. The amnestic effects of alprazolam are consistent with the drug effects of the benzodiazepines as a group.", 
    "71": "Therapeutic efficacy for depression and panic disorder has been demonstrated with the triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam. However, potentially serious adverse events, including depression and suicide attempts, have been reported in patients taking this medication. In this paper, reports addressing the association between each of these two events and benzodiazepine use in general and, more specifically, alprazolam use, are reviewed. We conclude that while these adverse events do occur in patients taking alprazolam, the causal relationship remains unclear and requires further study. Fortunately, these events are observed only rarely, so the prudent clinician may continue to safely prescribe this useful medication.", 
    "72": "The incidence of nonmedical use of alprazolam is very low relative to its widespread legitimate medical use; in fact, given the millions of patients who have received this medication, the incidence is remarkably small. In particular, among patients with anxiety disorders, dependence does not appear to be a clinically important problem. Alprazolam abuse and dependence represent only a small fraction of the large and serious nonmedical use problem in the United States, and when they occur, are among individuals who abuse other drugs. For example, a serious problem of alprazolam abuse may exist among patients in methadone maintenance treatment. A similar problem exists with diazepam. Alcohol abusers and alcohol-dependent individuals are another group among whom concern about benzodiazepine and alprazolam abuse exists. However, more and better information about the extent and nature of this use is needed. Many patients with alcohol or drug abuse also have anxiety disorders for whom effective pharmacotherapy may be needed. In the interim, caution but not prohibition to use should prevail in prescribing alprazolam to such patients. To the extent that nonmedical alprazolam use exists, evidence suggests that the vast majority of such use is the consequence of the inappropriate prescribing of the medication by a small number of physicians. One way to reduce the inappropriate use of benzodiazepines in methadone programs is to drug test the methadone-maintenance patients and to link positive urine tests to contingency-management strategies. The available data provide some support to the idea that alprazolam and diazepam have more abuse liability than other benzodiazepines.", 
    "73": "A review of the published case reports of adverse behavioral episodes or unexpected psychopathology in patients taking benzodiazepines was undertaken in an attempt to determine if these adverse or unexpected events are more likely to occur with alprazolam when compared with other currently marketed benzodiazepines. Adverse behavioral phenomena and unexpected psychopathology were divided into the following categories: (1) anger or violence, (2) impulsive, suicidal, or self-harming behavior, (3) depression, (4) mania, (5) schizophrenia, (6) withdrawal syndromes and (7) physical dependence and abuse liability. It is difficult to draw conclusions from this literature because of the limitations of spontaneously reported cases and the lack of epidemiologic studies. Despite these limitations, it appears that some differences between alprazolam and older benzodiazepines may exist. The older benzodiazepines are more commonly reported to have adverse events than alprazolam (with the exception of mania or hypomania). On the other hand, worsening in post-traumatic stress disorder and an increase in impulsive behavior in patients with borderline personality disorder have only been reported in patients receiving alprazolam. This is probably explained by the fact that only alprazolam has been used to any great extent in these conditions.", 
    "74": "The triazolobenzodiazepine alprazolam is biotransformed by hepatic microsomal oxidation, yielding two hydroxylated metabolites (4-hydroxy- and a-hydroxy-alprazolam) as the principal metabolic products. Both metabolites have lower benzodiazepine receptor affinity than the parent compound and at steady state appear in plasma at concentrations considerably lower than intact alprazolam. Thus, clinical activity during treatment with alprazolam is essentially entirely attributable to intact alprazolam. The cytochrome P450 IIIA subfamily appears to mediate alprazolam metabolism in humans. This cytochrome subfamily is not subject to variation due to genetic polymorphism. Ketoconazole, cimetidine, macrolide antibiotics, and serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor antidepressants impair alprazolam biotransformation in vitro. Reduced clearance of alprazolam in vivo has been demonstrated for drugs in this group that have been studied in humans; for those not yet studied, impaired alprazolam clearance should be anticipated during coadministration. Studies of plasma alprazolam concentration versus clinical response during short-term treatment of panic disorder indicate that therapeutic response at steady-state plasma levels of 20 to 40 ng/mL is significantly greater than at levels less than 20 ng/mL. Substantial additional benefit from plasma levels greater than 40 ng/mL is not consistently demonstrated. However, side effects attributable to benzodiazepine agonist activity (e.g., drowsiness, sedation) increase in frequency with increasing steady-state plasma levels. Concentration-response data indicate that monitoring of alprazolam plasma levels can be of considerable clinical value during treatment of panic disorder.", 
    "75": "A review of the worldwide published literature was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of alprazolam for the treatment of anxiety disorders, panic disorder, and depression in comparison with those of other active drugs (including other benzodiazepines and antidepressant medications). In all, a total of 8878 patients participated in the 84 active-drug-controlled studies that were reviewed: 3574 were treated with alprazolam, 3666 were treated with another active drug, and 1638 were treated with placebo. Two general findings emerged: (1) Alprazolam demonstrates efficacy for the treatment of anxiety disorders, panic disorder, and depression in the large majority of studies; for these illnesses, it appeared equal in efficacy to the active agents with which it was compared. (2) Medical events, such as depression, suicidality, hostility/aggression, mania/psychosis, abuse, withdrawal reactions, and seizures, were reported infrequently or not at all for alprazolam and the comparator drugs; there were no marked differences between drug classes in the frequencies of these events.", 
    "76": "This paper addresses current issues associated with medication discontinuation in panic disorder, with specific focus on one of the most frequently used medication classes for this indication, the benzodiazepines. The majority of patients, when slowly tapered, are able to discontinue the benzodiazepines without a great deal of difficulty, particularly after short-term therapy. Patients treated with long-term therapy at high therapeutic doses may experience greater difficulty with discontinuation. If patients are adequately prepared and if discontinuation is conducted slowly and gradually, discontinuation symptoms, if they occur, are transient, mild to moderate, and generally tolerable. However, return of the original condition (relapse) during discontinuation can greatly complicate clinical management.", 
    "77": "Ipratropium bromide (IB) is a non-selective muscarinic antagonist, whose bronchodilator efficacy has been shown in reversible and irreversible obstructive airway diseases. Pirenzepine is a M1 receptor antagonist and effective in vagally-induced bronchoconstriction. To investigate the bronchodilator efficacy of nebulized pirenzepine, we compared nebulized pirenzepine with nebulized IB and nebulized isotonic saline (placebo). Eighteen patients with reversible and 18 patients with irreversible obstructive airway disease were studied. Nebulized isotonic saline (placebo), 100 mcg nebulized pirenzepine and 125 mcg nebulized IB were given on three consecutive days. Spirometry was performed prior to nebulization and repeated at 5, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following nebulized medication. A dose of 125 mcg IB resulted in a significant increase in FEV1 in patients with both reversible or irreversible bronchoconstriction (p < 0.00001, p < 0.03). IB at the same dose resulted in an increase in FVC in patients with irreversible bronchoconstriction (p < 0.001) and an increase in FEF25-75 in patients with reversible bronchoconstriction (p < 0.0003). Pirenzepine therapy resulted in no significant change in the same parameters. It is concluded that nebulized pirenzepine at a dose of 100 mcg does not have bronchodilator effect in patients with reversible or irreversible bronchoconstriction.", 
    "78": "A modern approach to the evaluation of combined effects of two active drugs, A and B, in clinical trials is described, based on modern understanding of actions and interactions of drugs which act at distinct molecular sites. It rests on a comparison of observed combined effects with calculated effects of independent action of A plus B--greater than independent effects are considered as a potentiated response. It is illustrated by reanalysis of single-dose and time-course studies of the antisecretory action of pirenzepine and H2-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, ranitidine). Briefly, peptone-stimulated acid output was measured in 15 min periods over 3 h after the injection of drugs in three trials, one with five duodenal ulcer patients, two of them with 8 healthy volunteers each. The doses of pirenzepine and H2-blockers were fixed in each trial. The results were either expressed by the total acid output (single-dose analysis) or by the acid secretion over 15 min as time course. The results with the drug combination show greater reduction in acid secretion in all three trials with respect to independent effects. The time-course studies more clearly showed greater reduction in acid output than the analysis of total acid output, not the least with respect to p-values of differences between observed combined effects and calculated independent effects. They were obtained by the chi-square (chi 2) goodness-of-fit test, recently applied for the evaluation of dose-response curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "Diazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously, its effect on scalp EEG was evaluated visually and by computer in 84 cases of epilepsy, and long-term follow-up was carried out in an attempt to explore relationships between the EEG changes produced by diazepam and the prognosis in these patients. The average length of follow-up was 3 years (range 2-3.5) in 48 out of 84 cases (57%). The EEG visually responded to diazepam (abolition of abnormal activity with emergence of fast activity) in 33/48 cases. Subsequent follow-up showed that 29 (88%) of these had a good prognosis (seizure-free or a 50% or more reduction in seizures) and 4 others (12%) had a poor result (frequency of seizures increased, unchanged or decreased less than 50%). Fifteen patients had a negative EEG response to the drug, 4 (27%) of whom had a favorable outcome and 11 (73%) an unfavorable result. These results were statistically significant. The percentage of diazepam-induced EEG changes in beta activity (PDICB) was also significantly positively related to the percentage of reduction in seizure frequency in these patients (r = 0.55, p < 0.001). In 79% of patients with PDICB values more than 2, and 30% of those with values less than 2, a good outcome occurred whereas 21% and 70%, respectively, had a poor outcome (p < 0.001). These results showed that the patterns of EEG change induced by diazepam are intimately related to the outcome of epilepsy.", 
    "80": "We have measured the skin conductance response to innocuous auditory stimuli and the anticipatory response before venepuncture in 45 patients receiving diazepam, morphine or no premedication before general anaesthesia. Subjective ratings of anxiety and sedation were measured using visual analogue scales. Skin conductance was less in subjects receiving diazepam than in the other groups, and the pattern of change of skin conductance in this group indicated superior adaptation to the environment during presentation of the innocuous stimuli compared with the other groups. After warning of venepuncture there was a large increase in skin conductance in all groups. There was a significant relationship between anxiety and skin conductance in unpremedicated patients and those receiving diazepam.", 
    "81": "We have studied the volume of water which should accompany diazepam 10 mg oral premedication given 1-2 h before induction of anaesthesia in 75 patients undergoing elective gynaecological laparoscopy. Twenty-five patients were given 20 ml (group A), 25 patients 150 ml (group B), and 25 patients 300-450 ml of water (group C). There were no differences between the groups in gastric fluid volume and acidity. All groups reported a reduction in thirst and dryness of the mouth after water intake, while only group B reported significant anxiolysis. Eight patients in group C experienced augmented diuresis, compared with no patients in groups A and B. We conclude that 150 ml is the ideal amount of water given with oral premedication 1-2 h before anaesthesia.", 
    "82": "1. Diazepam, warfarin and testosterone were metabolized by whole resting cells of the fungus Beauveria bassiana IMI 12939 via oxidative reactions such as hydroxylation and N-demethylation. 2. Metabolism of each substrate was inhibited by the cytochrome P450 inhibitors SKF-525A and metyrapone, consistent with the involvement of this enzyme system in the metabolism of these drugs by B. bassiana. 3. Substrate concentration-dependent inhibition was observed during diazepam metabolism by this organism, as has been observed in some mammalian systems. 4. Unlike most mammalian P450 systems, the warfarin-metabolizing activity of B. bassiana could not be induced by growing the organism in the presence of phenobarbitone, beta-naphthoflavone, 3-methylcholanthrene, 1-benzylimidazole or warfarin. 5. Overall findings indicate that B. bassiana possesses an oxidative metabolizing system capable of producing metabolites found in mammalian systems.", 
    "83": "We present our experience with 55 children in which we performed flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB) using an Olympus BF3C20 instrument and by using sedation and local anaesthesia or laryngeal mask airway. Indications for performing this procedure were stridor, opportunist or recurrent pneumonia, persistent atelectasis, a suspected foreign body, confirmation of endobronchial tuberculosis and evaluation of tracheostomy. In 70% of the cases, the diagnosis was made by the FFB and 14 cases were normal. One child with severe hypoxia presented respiratory arrest and need intubation. Our results suggest that FFB is safe, has advantages over rigid bronchoscopy, avoids general anaesthetic and with laryngeal mask airway is possible to perform in patients of every age.", 
    "84": "With the aim of finding a correlation between the blocking of G.H. secretion and the irregularities in the permeability of the hematoretinal barrier, we have studied the average nocturnal G.H. levels (NAGHL) and the vitreous penetration rate (VPR) in five young diabetic patients. These patients, 3 males and 2 females, were between the ages of 12 and 17 years with a mean age of 16.0. They were studies both before and after receiving treatment for one month with an oral nocturnal dose of 0.6 mg/kg of pirenzepine (gastrozepin) and 1 mg/kg during the subsequent five months. We also tried to find a relationship between the VPR post-treatment and the evolution time of their illness and with their BA1C. The most important results found in this study were: 1) the nocturnal oral pirenzepine modified the NAGHL in the study population (10.48 +/- 4.94 vs; 4.34 +/- 2.53 ng/ml; p < 0.05). 2) Ingestion of the aforementioned drug did not affect the VPR (4.84 +/- 2.08 vs 4.53 +/- 2.54 x 10(-6)/min; p > 0.05). We have not found a relationship between the VPR after treatment with either the HBA1C levels or with the evolution time of the illness. Therefore, we conclude that the dose of oral pirenzepine used for 6 months, although it definitely decreases G.H. secretion, does not modify the permeability of the B.H.R. within this group of young diabetics. Hence, we can infer that the G.H. hypersecretion does not seem to have a relationship, at least exclusively, with the development of diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "85": "Six cases of daytime use of triazolam are reported. In all cases, daytime anxiety following the night-time use of this short-acting, high-potency hypnotic benzodiazepine led to the use of the drug during the day.

    "86": "Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) have been established as effective drugs in the treatment of depressive and anxiety disorders. However, there are also reports that they can induce depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in patients. Eighty of 230 patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder received, during the course of treatment, fluvoxamine (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) at a dose level between 50-200 mg/day. The patients were clinically evaluated for a history of affective disorder and for the presence of affective symptoms before the treatment and for emergence of depressive symptoms during the treatment. Seven of the 80 patients (9%) developed symptoms of depression despite a good antianxiety response. Five of the 7 patients received fluvoxamine as second choice after tricyclic antidepressants (TCA). These patients had no history of affective disorder, and no symptoms of depression were present before the treatment with fluvoxamine. The depressive symptoms abated after the fluvoxamine was discontinued and TCA or clonazepam was prescribed. The depressive symptoms reappeared when fluoxetine was administered. None of these 7 patients developed depressive symptoms while treated with TCA or clonazepam. Among the 150 patients treated with TCA and benzodiazepines, not a single case of depression was seen in patients without a previous history of depression. These results suggest a vulnerability among some of panic disorder patients to noradrenergic-serotonergic imbalance caused by SSRI, which has to be taken into clinical consideration.", 
    "87": "The GABAA receptor subunits are candidate genes for panic disorder because the receptor is the site of action for the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepines. We tested for linkage between a tetranucleotide repeat polymorphism at the GABAA beta 1 locus, located on chromosome 4p13-p12, and panic disorder defined by DSM-III-R criteria in 5 Icelandic pedigrees. Both a narrow affection status (definite panic disorder and agoraphobia) and a broad one (including probable cases of these disorders) were tested. With the narrow definition, at a recombination fraction of 0.00, the lod scores in the 5 pedigrees ranged from -3.240 to +0.063, the total score across all 5 pedigrees being -8.299. With the broad definition at the same recombination fraction, the individual lod scores ranged from -2.614 to -0.489, with the total being -8.089. Thus, linkage between panic disorder/agoraphobia and the GABAA beta 1 locus in these pedigrees is exceedingly unlikely.", 
    "88": "The lesion of serotonergic neurons (by an intraventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine) potentiated the conditioned place aversion induced by the 5-hydroxytryptamine1C/5-hydroxytryptamine2 antagonist mianserin in rats. This effect was selective for mianserin as the same lesion suppressed the conditioned place aversion induced by the benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG-7142. Previous results had shown the involvement of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1C receptors in the conditioned place aversion induced by mianserin [Rocha et al. (1993) Behav. Pharmac. 4, 101-106]. It was thus of interest to investigate the effect of the lesion on these receptor binding sites. Autoradiographic binding studies showed that the lesion significantly increased the concentration of the 5-hydroxytryptamine1C binding sites in various brain regions, including the amygdala, the hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens. Contrastingly, in these same brain regions, in situ hybridization histochemistry did not reveal an alteration of the level of messenger RNA coding for these receptors. On the one hand, correlating potentiation of the aversive effects of mianserin and increase of 5-hydroxytryptamine1C binding sites in the limbic system represent an interesting step in the comprehension of the molecular and motivational effects of serotonergic drugs. On the other hand, showing a dissociation between the expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine1C receptors and their corresponding messenger RNA, suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms are involved in the regulation of these receptors.",

Patients were enrolled in one of three different programmes: methadone maintenance programme (MMP), antagonist maintenance programme (AMP) and drug-free programme (DFP). Information given by participants was compared with results of urine screening for drugs. Urine samples were tested using enzyme immunoassay for the detection of heroin, cocaine, dextropropoxyphene, cannabis and benzodiazepines, and radioimmunoassay for buprenorphine. Sixty-six percent of patients in 1988 and 71% of patients in 1990 reported having consumed buprenorphine at some time during their history of drug dependence (period prevalence) and 5.9% and 6.1%, respectively, tested positive to the drug (point prevalence). In over 70% of these patients consumption was by the intravenous route. Consumption of cannabis, cocaine and benzodiazepines was also very high in the study population. Overall, patients in the DFP group consumed the largest number of the drugs tested, while those in the AMP group consumed the smallest number. Abuse of buprenorphine could be more widespread than previously reported.", 
    "90": "Midazolam and sufentanil are commonly used for sedation. Cerebrovascular effects of low-dose midazolam have not been studied previously, and cerebrovascular effects of sufentanil remain controversial. Forty ASA I and II patients were studied preoperatively. These patients were given midazolam (20 or 40 micrograms/kg) or sufentanil (0.1 or 0.2 micrograms/kg) i.v. Transcranial Doppler recordings of middle cerebral artery mean blood flow velocity (Vm) were recorded before administration of the study drug and for the 5-min investigation period. Mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and end-tidal CO2 remained constant during the investigation and did not vary between treatment groups. Vm decreased 17 to 21% with both midazolam doses (p < 0.05), returning to baseline within 5 min. Vm did not change with either sufentanil dose. These results suggest that midazolam decreases cerebral blood flow (CBF) by increasing cerebral vascular resistance (CVR). The low sedative doses of sufentanil used in this study did not affect Vm over 5 min in unanesthetized patients.", 
    "91": "Cardiovascular effects of IV administered ketamine (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) were determined in 12 healthy isoflurane-anesthetized (1.7% end-tidal concentration) dogs. Six dogs received a ketamine-midazolam combination (K-M) as a bolus over 30 seconds and 6 dogs received K-M as an infusion over 15 minutes. Ketamine-midazolam combination as a bolus and an infusion caused early significant (P < 0.05) reductions in mean systemic blood pressure, cardiac index, and stroke index, which returned to baseline values near the end of the study. Heart rate decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in dogs of the infusion group and returned to the baseline value near the end of the study. One dog died after K-M bolus administration. Mean maximal decreases from baseline for systemic blood pressure, cardiac index, and stroke index were significantly (P < 0.05) greater in dogs of the bolus group than in dogs of the infusion group; therefore, cardiovascular effects of K-M after infusion were less severe than those after bolus. Base excess and pHa decreased significantly (P < 0.05) in the infusion group, although similar changes occurred in both groups. Four dogs were maintained with 1.7% end-tidal isoflurane to determine temporal effects of isoflurane; these dogs did not receive K-M. Increases in heart rate, cardiac index, stroke index, and left and right ventricular stroke work indexes were significant (P < 0.05) at various sample collection intervals, particularly during the later stages of the study. Isoflurane anesthesia effectively blocked the cardiostimulatory properties of K-M.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "92": "Twelve healthy dogs were used to determine the cardiorespiratory effects of i.v. administered ketamine (10 mg/kg of body weight) and midazolam (0.5 mg/kg). Half the dogs received a ketamine-midazolam combination (K-M) as a bolus over 30 seconds and the other half received the K-M as an infusion over 15 minutes. Induction of anesthesia by use of K-M was good in all dogs. Ketamine-midazolam combination as a bolus or infusion induced minimal cardiorespiratory effects, except for significant (P < 0.05) increases in mean heart rate and rate-pressure product. The increase in heart rate was greater in dogs of the infusion group. Mild and transient respiratory depression was observed in dogs of both groups immediately after administration of K-M, but was greater in dogs of the bolus group than in dogs of the infusion group. Duration of action of K-M for chemical restraint was short. Salivation and defecation were observed in a few dogs. Extreme muscular tone developed in 1 dog after K-M bolus administration.", 
    "93": "The effect of nitrendipine on the cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation was studied in a placebo-controlled, randomised, double-blind trial. Thirty patients (ASA physical status 1) undergoing elective surgery received either 5 or 10 mg nitrendipine, or a placebo orally 3 h before induction of anaesthesia (n = 10 for each group). Anaesthesia was induced with sodium thiopentone 5 mg/kg i.v. and tracheal intubation was facilitated with vecuronium 0.2 mg/kg i.v. Patients receiving the placebo showed a significant increase in the mean arterial pressure and the rate-pressure product in response to tracheal intubation. These increases following intubation were reduced in nitrendipine-treated patients compared with the placebo group (P < 0.05). Oral administration of nitrendipine (5 or 10 mg, 3 h before induction of anaesthesia) was able to attenuate the hypertensive response to tracheal intubation in ASA 1 patients under light anaesthesia. We propose this pharmacological technique with supplementary doses of opioids and/or benzodiazepines for the management of patients with hypertension or coronary artery disease.", 
    "94": "In order to test the assumption that the sleep stability increases as the number of shifts and awakenings decreases, all-night sleep recordings (registered at home) were reanalyzed. The registrations belong to 10 young good sleepers, 10 adult good sleepers, 10 insomnia patients without treatment, 10 treated with a benzodiazepine and 10 treated with a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic, 10 patients with proven narcolepsy, and 10 with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). For each of the categories NREM-1-2, NREM 3-4, and REM sleep, indices were defined as the number of shifts and awakenings that occurred per hour. Our results show that the indices of awakenings for the good as well for the bad sleepers were similar, whereas the indices of awakenings were very group dependent. We interpreted these results as showing that awakenings are valuable indicators for studying the quality of sleep, whereas shifts are not.", 
    "95": "The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of the cholecystokinin (CCK) analogue, BDNL, and the selective CCK-B agonist, BC 264, were determined using the hot plate test in mice. BDNL (0.2 nmol and 0.5 nmol) increased the jump and the paw lick latencies. These effects were blocked by the CCK-A antagonist MK-329 (0.02 mg/kg), supporting the involvement of CCK-A receptors in CCK-induced analgesia. In contrast, the selective CCK-B agonist BC 264 produced, at one dose (2.5 nmol), a slight decrease in the lick latency that was only antagonized by the CCK-B antagonist. Naloxone, but not naltrindole, antagonized BDNL-induced analgesia. The results suggest that activation of CCK-A receptors by BDNL leads to antinociceptive responses indirectly mediated by stimulation of mu-opioid receptors by endogenous enkephalins.", 
    "96": "1. Acquisition of a two-way shuttle-box avoidance response is facilitated by ethanol. This facilitated acquisition of an avoidance response to ethanol was attenuated during withdrawal from chronic-ethanol diet intake (i.e. tolerance developed by ethanol). The deficit in the avoidance task after chronic ethanol treatment could be overcome by increasing the dose of ethanol. 2. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist, also facilitated acquisition of the avoidance response in control rats. This response to flumazenil was significantly reduced during withdrawal from chronic-ethanol treatment. This reduced avoidance responding during withdrawal also could be overcome by increasing the dose of flumazenil. 3. The benzodiazepine-inverse agonist, RO 15-4513, produced a deficit in avoidance responding that was antagonized by both ethanol and flumazenil in a dose-related manner. 4. To determine whether flumazenil has the properties of a benzodiazepine agonist, it was established that, unlike the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, flumazenil did not enhance the ethanol-induced deficit in the aerial righting reflex. Additionally, flumazenil blocked the action of chlordiazepoxide in this procedure, consistent with the benzodiazepine antagonist action of flumazenil. 5. Data collected are consistent with the hypothesis that an endogenous substance with the properties of a benzodiazepine-inverse agonist antagonizes the anticonflict actions of acutely administered ethanol during withdrawal from chronic-ethanol exposure.", 
    "97": "1. In this study, we compared two series of newly discovered ligands for their selectivity to benzodiazepine sites in the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 and the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtypes of cloned gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors, the latter being unique in not interacting with classical benzodiazepines. 2. The prototype compounds, U-85575 (12-chloro-5-(5-cyclopropyl-1',2',4'- oxadiazol-3'-yl)-2,3-dihydro-diimidazo [1,5-a;1,2-c]quinazoline), and U-92330 (5-acetyl-3-(5'-cyclopropyl-1',2',4'-oxadiazole-3'-yl)-7-chloro-4,5-d ihy dro [1,5-a]quinoxaline), appear to share an overlapping recognition site with classical benzodiazepines on the GABAA receptor, because their potentiation of GABA-mediated Cl- currents in both subtypes were sensitive to Ro 15-1788, a classical benzodiazepine antagonist. 3. Minor changes in the ring substituents of the drugs reduced their affinity to the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype more pronouncedly than to the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype. The diimidazoquinazoline containing a 2-methyl group which projected below the plane of the rigid ring showed a markedly lower affinity to the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype as compared to its stereoisomer having the methyl group above the plane of the ring. Also, the dihydroimidazoquinoxalines containing the 5-benzoyl group showed a lower affinity to the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype than the 5-acetyl counterpart. In particular, the 5-benzoyl analogue containing a 6-fluoro group showed no interaction with the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype even at the concentration of 10 microM, probably due to stabilization of the benzoyl group in the out-of-plane region by the steric and electrostatic effects of the 6-fluoro group.4. We propose that the benzodiazepine site of the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype shares overlapping regions with that of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 subtype, but has a sterically restricted out-of-plane region, which may be also incompatible with the 5-phenyl group of classical benzodiazepines."
