Combining naltrexone and alprazolam might safely maximize efficacy while avoiding the untoward effects of the constituent compounds.", 
    "1": "The present pilot study tested the hypothesis that acute pretreatment with the combination of naltrexone and alprazolam would not produce clinically problematic physiological effects or negative subjective effects and would reduce the positive subjective effects of d-amphetamine to a greater extent than the constituent drugs alone.",

    "5": "The present study evaluated anxiolytic activity of (+)-limonene epoxide (EL), through the marble burying test (MBT) assay, and the antioxidant potential in vitro and in vivo in mice hippocampus of adult mice subjected to experimental anxiety protocol. For behavioral studies, and in vivo antioxidant analyses, mice were treated orally with 0.05% Tween 80 dissolved in 0.9% saline solution (vehicle), ascorbic acid 250 mg/kg, diazepam (2 mg/kg) and EL (25, 50 and 75 mg/kg). Results suggest an anxiolytic effect of (+)-limonene epoxide. A reduction in number of buried marbles in groups treated with EL doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg was observed when compared with diazepam and vehicle groups. This reduction was observed after treatments with single and repeated doses, reinforcing the hypothesis of anxiolytic effect. The anxiolytic effect was reversed by pretreatment with flumazenil (25 mg/kg, o.r) in the same way as it was observed with diazepam (2 mg/kg, o.r, positive control), suggesting that these drugs possess a similar mechanism of action. In antioxidant tests in vitro, the concentrations from 0.9 to 7.2 \u03bcg/ml were tested. The results of in vitro antioxidant tests demonstrated a 50% inhibitory effective concentration of 0.7342, 1.296 and 1.169 \u03bcg/ml against the formation of nitrite ion, hydroxyl radical and reactive substances to thiobarbituric acid, respectively. The treatment with EL reduced the lipid peroxidation level and nitrite content, suggesting an antioxidant role in vivo since it was able to reduce the formation of reactive species derived from oxygen and nitrogen. Furthermore, the EL increased activity of enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase in mice hippocampus, suggesting that their role may be due to antioxidant upregulation of these enzymes.", 
    "6": "We examined the difference in cerebral function alterations between drug-induced blepharospasm patients and essential blepharospasm (EB) patients by using positron emission tomography with (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose. Cerebral glucose metabolism was examined in 21 patients with drug-induced blepharospasm (5 men and 16 women; mean age, 53.1 [range, 29-78] years), 21 essential EB patients (5 men and 16 women; mean age, 53.0 [range, 33-72] years) and 24 healthy subjects (6 men and 18 women; mean age, 57.9 [range, 22-78] years) with long-term history of benzodiazepines use (drug healthy subjects). Drug-induced blepharospasm patients developed symptoms while taking benzodiazepines or thienodiazepines. Sixty-three normal volunteers (15 men and 48 women; mean age, 53.6 [range, 20-70] years) were examined as controls. Differences between the patient groups and control group were examined by statistical parametric mapping. Additionally, we defined regions of interests on both sides of the thalamus, caudate nucleus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen and primary somatosensory area. The differences between groups were tested using two-sample t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Cerebral glucose hypermetabolism on both side of the thalamus was detected in drug-induced blepharospasm, EB patients and drug healthy subjects by statistical parametric mapping. In the analysis of regions of interest, glucose metabolism in both sides of the thalamus in the drug-induced blepharospasm group was significantly lower than that in the EB group. Moreover, we observed glucose hypermetabolism in the anterior and posterior putamen bilaterally in EB group but not in drug-induced blepharospasm group and drug healthy subjects. Long-term regimens of benzodiazepines or thienodiazepines may cause down-regulation of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. We suggest that the functional brain alteration in drug-induced blepharospasm patients is similar to that in EB patients, and that alteration of the GABAergic system might be related to the pathology of both blepharospasm types.",

JM-20 (3-ethoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-4-(2-nitrophenyl)-4,11-dihydro-1H-pyrido[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepine) is a novel hybrid molecule, in which a benzodiazepine portion is covalently linked to a dihydropyridine ring, forming a new chemical entity with potential multisite neuroprotective activity. In the present study, JM-20 prevented PC-12 cell death induced either by glutamate, hydrogen peroxide or KCN-mediated chemical hypoxia. This molecule also protected cerebellar granule neurons from glutamate or glutamate plus pentylenetetrazole-induced damage at very low micromolar concentrations. In rat liver mitochondria, JM-20, at low micromolar concentrations, prevented the Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition, as assessed by mitochondrial swelling, membrane potential dissipation and organelle release of the pro-apoptotic protein cytochrome c. JM-20 also inhibited the mitochondrial hydrolytic activity of F1F0-ATP synthase and Ca2+ influx. Therefore, JM-20 may be a multi-target neuroprotective agent, promoting reductions in neuronal excitotoxic injury and the protection of the mitochondria from Ca2+-induced impairment as well as the preservation of cellular energy balance.",

Menthol actions were unaffected by TRPM8 and TRPA1 antagonists, tetrodotoxin and the benzodiazepine antagonist, flumazenil. Menthol also enhanced a tonic current, which was sensitive to the GABAA receptor antagonists, picrotoxin (100\u2009\u03bcM), bicuculline (30\u2009\u03bcM) and Zn(2+) (100\u2009\u03bcM), but unaffected by gabazine (10\u2009\u03bcM) and a GABAC receptor antagonist, 1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid hydrate (TPMPA; 50\u2009\u03bcM). In addition, menthol potentiated currents induced by the extrasynaptic GABAA receptor agonist THIP/gaboxadol (10\u2009\u03bcM).",

Three experiments were conducted each with a diazepam control (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75\u2005mg/kg). In the first experiment, we administered the 5-HT2C antagonist RS 102221 (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0\u2005mg/kg) and 5-HT2C agonist MK-212 (0.25, 0.5 and 0.75\u2005mg/kg); in the second experiment, we administered the 5-HT3 antagonist Y-25130 (0.1, 1.0 and 3.0\u2005mg/kg) and 5-HT3 agonist SR 57227A (0.1, 1.0 and 3.0\u2005mg/kg), and in the third experiment, we administered the 5-HT4 antagonist RS 39604 (0.01, 0.1, 1.0\u2005mg/kg) and 5-HT4 agonist RS 67333 (0.01, 0.1 and 0.5\u2005mg/kg). The administration of 5-HT2/3/4 subtype antagonists all generated behavioral profiles indicative of anxiolytic-like effects in the EZM, which was apparent from examination of both traditional and ethological measures. While little effect was observed from 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 agonists, the 5-HT4 agonist RS 67333 was found to produce a paradoxical anxiolytic-like effect similar to that produced by the 5-HT4 antagonist RS 39604.

These previously normal children had no evidence of expressive aphasia during their symptomatic periods. Further, in both cases, auditory agnosia was associated with sleep-activated electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity, consistent with Landau-Kleffner syndrome. However, both cases are unique since the episodic auditory agnosia and sleep-activated EEG epileptiform activity rapidly responded to combination therapy with pulse benzodiazepine and corticosteroids. Further, in each case, recurrences were characterized by similar symptoms, EEG findings, and beneficial responses to the pulse benzodiazepine and corticosteroid therapy. These observations suggest that pulse combination high-dose corticosteroid and benzodiazepine therapy may be especially effective in Landau-Kleffner syndrome.",

Although AWS is thought to be driven by a hyperglutamatergic brain state, benzodiazepines, which target the GABAergic system, comprise the first line of treatment for AWS. Using a rat model of ethanol withdrawal, we tested whether ceftriaxone, a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic known to increase the expression and activity of glutamate uptake transporter EAAT2, reduces the occurrence or severity of ethanol withdrawal manifestations. After a 2-week period of habituation to ethanol in two-bottle choice, alcohol-preferring (P) and Wistar rats received ethanol (4.0 g/kg) every 6 h for 3-5 consecutive days via gavage. Rats were then deprived of ethanol for 48 h during which time they received ceftriaxone (50 or 100 mg/kg, IP) or saline twice a day starting 12 h after the last ethanol administration. Withdrawal manifestations were captured by continuous video recording and coded. The evolution of ethanol withdrawal was markedly different for P rats vs Wistar rats, with withdrawal manifestations occurring >12 h later in P rats than in Wistar rats. Ceftriaxone 100 mg/kg per injection twice per day (200 mg/kg/day) reduced or abolished all manifestations of ethanol withdrawal in both rat variants and prevented withdrawal-induced escalation of alcohol intake. Finally, ceftriaxone treatment was associated with lasting upregulation of ethanol withdrawal-induced downregulation of EAAT2 in the striatum. Our data support the role of ceftriaxone in alleviating alcohol withdrawal and open a novel pharmacologic avenue that requires clinical evaluation in patients with AWS.", 
    "51": "CYP Oxidoreductase (Por) is the essential electron donor for all CYP enzymes and is responsible for the activation of CYP. The Taconic Hepatic CYP Reductase Null (HRN) mouse model possesses a targeted mutation that results in liver-specific deletion of the Por gene thereby resulting in a disruption of CYP metabolism in the liver. The objectives of these studies were to further characterize the HRN mouse using probe drugs metabolized by CYP. In addition, tumor exposure in xenograft tumor bearing HRN immune-compromised (nude) mice was also determined. In HRN mice following intravenous (iv) administration of midazolam, clearance (CL) was reduced by \u223c 80% compared to wild-type mice (WT). After oral administration, the AUC of midazolam was increased by \u223c 20-fold in HRN mice compared to WT mice; this greater effect suggests that hepatic first pass plays a role in the oral CL of midazolam. A 50% and an 80% decrease in CL were also observed in HRN mice following iv administration of docetaxel and theophylline, respectively, compared to WT mice. In addition, a 2- to 3-fold increase in tumor concentrations of G4222, a tool compound, were observed in tumor bearing HRN nude mice compared to tumor bearing nude WT mice. The observations from these experiments demonstrate that, for compounds that are extensively metabolized by hepatic CYP, the HRN mouse model could potentially be valuable for evaluating in vivo efficacy of tool compounds in drug discovery where high hepatic CL and low exposure may prevent in vivo evaluation of a new chemical entity.",

The radiotracer [(18) F]GE-180 binds selectively and with high affinity to TSPO and can therefore be used to measure neuroinflammation in a variety of disease states. An optimized, automated synthesis of [(18) F]GE-180 has been developed for the GE FASTlab\u2122 synthesizer. The entire process takes place on the single-use cassette. The radiolabelling is performed by nucleophilic fluorination of the S- enantiomer mesylate precursor.

The total distribution volume (VT) values of (18)F-BCPP-EF showed the significant reduction in MC-I activity in the damaged area at Day-7. When correlated with rCBF and rCMRO\u2082, the VT values of (18)F-BCPP-EF provided better correlation with rCMRO\u2082 than with rCBF.

During these sessions the patient learned that the underlying, hidden causes of her mental disorders could be revealed, understood and coped with, thereby more permanent periods without symptoms could be achieved. During the last sessions of the treatment the patient herself recognised the main cause of her recurrent panic disorder: it was a sentence she was told by her relatives when she was 18, which acted as a malediction-sentence. After the identification and modification of the dysfunctional attitudes and basic assumptions related to the malediction-sentence the patient had no panic symptoms anymore and she gradually stopped taking her medication. This case report demonstrates that the underlying, deep-rooted psychic cause of panic disorder can be revealed and understood and by this way permanent asymptomatic state can be achieved.

Behavioral studies also suggest an interaction of toluene with GABAA and/or NMDA receptors but it is unclear if these receptors underlie the abuse-related intoxicating effects of toluene. Seventeen B6SJLF1/J mice were trained using a two-choice operant drug discrimination procedure to discriminate 10 min of exposure to 2000 ppm toluene vapor from 10 min of exposure to air. The discrimination was acquired in a mean of 65 training sessions. The stimulus effects of 2000 ppm toluene vapor were exposure concentration-dependent but rapidly diminished following the cessation of vapor exposure. The stimulus effects of toluene generalized to the chlorinated hydrocarbon vapor perchloroethylene but not 1,1,2-trichloroethane nor the volatile anesthetic isoflurane. The competitive NMDA antagonist CGS-19755, the uncompetitive antagonist dizocilpine and the glycine-site antagonist L701,324 all failed to substitute for toluene. The classical nonselective benzodiazepines midazolam and chlordiazepoxide produced toluene-like stimulus effects but the alpha 1 subunit preferring positive GABAA modulator zaleplon failed to substitute for toluene. The barbiturates pentobarbital and methohexital and the GABAA positive modulator neurosteroid allopregnanolone did not substitute for toluene.

Therefore, benzodiazepines have a significant impact on prescription drug unintentional overdoses second only to the opioid analgesics. The combination prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics commonly takes place. The pharmacokinetic drug interactions between benzodiazepines and opioid analgesics are complex. The pharmacodynamic actions of these agents differ as their combined effects produce significant respiratory depression.

    "117": "The transcription factor signal STAT5 is constitutively activated in a wide range of leukemias and lymphomas, and drives the expression of genes necessary for proliferation, survival, and self-renewal. Thus, targeting STAT5 is an appealing therapeutic strategy for hematologic malignancies. Given the importance of bromodomain-containing proteins in transcriptional regulation, we considered the hypothesis that a pharmacologic bromodomain inhibitor could inhibit STAT5-dependent gene expression. We found that the small-molecule bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 decreases STAT5-dependent (but not STAT3-dependent) transcription of both heterologous reporter genes and endogenous STAT5 target genes. JQ1 reduces STAT5 function in leukemia and lymphoma cells with constitutive STAT5 activation, or inducibly activated by cytokine stimulation. Among the BET bromodomain subfamily of proteins, it seems that BRD2 is the critical mediator for STAT5 activity. In experimental models of acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias, where activated STAT5 contributes to leukemia cell survival, Brd2 knockdown or JQ1 treatment shows strong synergy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in inducing apoptosis in leukemia cells. In contrast, mononuclear cells isolated form umbilical cord blood, which is enriched in normal hematopoietic precursor cells, were unaffected by these combinations. These findings indicate a unique functional association between BRD2 and STAT5, and suggest that combinations of JQ1 and TKIs may be an important rational strategy for treating leukemias and lymphomas driven by constitutive STAT5 activation.",

    "119": "Two motion-correction methods were implemented for awake NHP brain PET imaging: multiacquisition frame (MAF) and event-by-event (EBE). Motion data were acquired from an external motion-tracking device. The MAF method divides scan data into short subframes, reconstructs each subframe individually, and registers them to a reference orientation. This method suffers from residual intraframe motion and data loss when motion is large because a minimum frame duration is often required. The EBE method, previously implemented for a human brain scanner and adapted for a small-animal PET scanner in this work, eliminates intraframe motion and should have a best accuracy. We first evaluated the accuracy of both motion-correction methods with moving phantom scans. Both motion-correction methods were then applied to awake NHP brain PET studies with a gamma-aminobutyric acid A-benzodiazepine receptor ligand, (11)C-flumazenil, and the reconstructed images were compared with those from a motion-free anesthetized study.", 
    "120": "The phantom studies showed that EBE motion correction recovers the contrast (within 3%) similarly to the static study, whereas MAF motion correction using the standard algorithm setting showed a 25% reduction in contrast from the static case. In awake NHP brain PET imaging, EBE motion correction better recovers the fine structures than the MAF method, as compared with anesthetized studies.",

We investigated whether the SFO is activated by the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK\u2081 and CCK\u2082 receptors were identified in the SFO by RT-PCR. Dissociated SFO neurons that responded to CCK (40/77), were mostly depolarized (9.2 \u00b1 0.9 mV, 30/77), but some were hyperpolarized (-7.3 \u00b1 1.1 mV, 10/77). We next examined the responses of SFO neurons in vivo to CCK (16 \u03bcg/kg ip), in the presence and absence of CCK\u2081 or CCK\u2082 receptor antagonists (devazepide; 600 \u03bcg/kg and L-365,260; 100 \u03bcg/kg, respectively), using the functional activation markers c-Fos and phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase (p-ERK). The nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) served as a control for CCK-induced activity. There was a significant increase in c-Fos expression in the NTS (259.2 \u00b1 20.8 neurons) compared with vehicle (47.5 \u00b1 2.5). Similarly, in the SFO, c-Fos was expressed in 40.5 \u00b1 10.6 neurons in CCK-treated compared with 6.6 \u00b1 2.7 in vehicle-treated rats (P < 0.01). Devazepide significantly reduced the effects of CCK in the NTS but not in SFO. L-365,260 blocked the effects of CCK in both brain regions. CCK increased the number of p-ERK neurons in NTS (27.0 \u00b1 4.0) as well as SFO (18.0 \u00b1 4.0), compared with vehicle (8.0 \u00b1 2.6 and 4.3 \u00b1 0.6, respectively; P < 0.05). Both devazepide and L-365,260 reduced CCK-induced p-ERK in NTS, but only L-365,260 reduced it in the SFO.

An ideal sedative agent must be safe and well tolerated by patients and practitioners. This study evaluated fospropofol, a relatively new sedative/hypnotic, in comparison to midazolam, a commonly used benzodiazepine, for IV moderate sedation during oral and maxillofacial surgery. Sixty patients were randomly assigned to either the fospropofol or the midazolam group. Each participant received 1 \u03bcg/kg of fentanyl prior to administration of the selected sedative.

Those in the midazolam group received initial doses of 0.05 mg/kg, followed by 0.02 mg/kg supplemental doses. The quality of sedation in each patient was evaluated with regard to (a) onset of sedation, maintenance, and recovery profile; (b) patient and surgeon satisfaction; and (c) hemodynamic stability and adverse effects. The fospropofol group demonstrated shorter physical recovery times than midazolam patients, taking a mean of 11.6 minutes versus 18.4 minutes for physical recovery (P = .007). Cognitive recovery comparison did not find any difference with a mean of 7.5 minutes versus 8.8 minutes between the 2 drug groups (P = .123). The fospropofol group had a higher rate of local anesthetic injection recall (90.5 vs 44.4%, P = .004). Other parameters of recall were comparable.

Among drugs the most often started, we found paracetamol, morphine, benzodiazepines with short half-life, cholinesterase inhibitors, the most often for an acute pathology (61.7 % of cases). Drugs overuse is therefore predominant, more than inappropriate medication and drugs underuse. To stop needless drugs and drugs which didn't prove their effectiveness would already allow to improve drugs prescription in elderly.", 
    "180": "Safety and efficacy of long-term olanzapine treatment in Japanese patients with bipolar depression were assessed.", 
    "181": "An integrated analysis of data from two studies was performed in olanzapine-treated patients (n\u2009=\u2009165) with bipolar depression. Study 1 was a 6-week, double-blind, global study. Patients were randomly assigned to olanzapine or placebo followed by 18 weeks of open-label treatment. Study 2 was an open-label extension of Study 1 involving only Japanese patients. Patients assigned to Pre-olanzapine and Pre-placebo in Study 1 were treated for 24 weeks (total olanzapine exposure 42 or 48 weeks) and newly recruited patients (New-olanzapine) were treated for 48 weeks. Safety outcomes included treatment-emergent adverse events and changes in metabolic parameters. Efficacy outcome was assessed with Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score.", 
    "182": "Forty-three percent of patients completed the 42- or 48-week olanzapine treatment period. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event was weight increased (47.9%). Significant increases were seen in weight (3.5\u2009kg), and in fasting glucose (3.5\u2009mg/dL), fasting total cholesterol (8.1\u2009mg/dL), and fasting triglycerides (35.1\u2009mg/dL). Remission rates (Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale total score \u226412 at any time) were 79.8% for the Pre-olanzapine group, 90.2% for the Pre-placebo group, and 85.0% for the New-olanzapine group. No patents developed mania during treatment.", 
    "183": "Long-term use of olanzapine in a Japanese population with bipolar depression is associated with increases in weight and fasting metabolic measures, and also with improved depressive symptoms with avoidance of mania. Clinicians must carefully consider the benefits and risks of long-term therapy with olanzapine.", 
    "184": "The risk of abnormal bleeding with serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been known, but there is insufficient evidence base to guide pharmacological treatment of anxiety in patients with underlying haematological conditions. The following case report is about a 50-year-old female with generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and alcohol abuse where pharmacological treatment of anxiety symptoms has been difficult as it would lead to bruising due to the patient's underlying qualitative platelet dysfunction. Treatment with venlafaxine, citalopram, escitalopram, and clomipramine resulted in improvement and anxiety symptoms, as well as reduction in alcohol use, but pharmacological treatment has to be discontinued because of bruising and hematomas. In view of an active substance use disorder, benzodiazepines were avoided as a treatment option. The patient's anxiety symptoms and comorbid alcohol abuse responded well to pharmacological treatment with buspirone which gradually titrated up to a dose of 30\u2009mg BID. Patient was followed for around a six-month period while she was on buspirone before being discharged to family doctor's care. Buspirone is unlikely to have a significant effect on platelet serotonin transponder and could be an effective alternative for pharmacological treatment of anxiety in patients with a bleeding diathesis.", 
    "185": "The degree of oxidized cysteine (Cys) 34 in human serum albumin (HSA), as determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), is correlated with oxidative stress related pathological conditions. In order to further characterize the oxidation of Cys34-HSA at the molecular level and to develop a suitable analytical method for a rapid and sensitive clinical laboratory analysis, the use of electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOFMS) was evaluated. A marked increase in the cysteinylation of Cys34 occurs in chronic liver and kidney diseases and diabetes mellitus. A significant positive correlation was observed between the Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction of plasma samples obtained from 229 patients, as determined by ESI-TOFMS, and the degree of oxidized Cys34-HSA determined by HPLC. The Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction was significantly increased with the progression of liver cirrhosis, and was reduced by branched chain amino acids (BCAA) treatment. The changes in the Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction were significantly correlated with the alternations of the plasma levels of advanced oxidized protein products, an oxidative stress marker for proteins. The binding ability of endogenous substances (bilirubin and tryptophan) and drugs (warfarin and diazepam) to HSA purified from chronic liver disease patients were significantly suppressed but significantly improved by BCAA supplementation. Interestingly, the changes in this physiological function of HSA in chronic liver disease were correlated with the Cys-Cys34-HSA fraction. In conclusion, ESI-TOFMS is a suitable high throughput method for the rapid and sensitive quantification of Cys-Cys34-HSA in a large number of samples for evaluating oxidative stress related chronic disease progression or in response to a treatment.", 
    "186": "Insomnia is a common clinical condition characterized by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or non-restorative sleep with impairment of daytime functioning. Currently, treatment for insomnia involves a combination of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) and pharmacological therapy. Among pharmacological interventions, the most evidence exists for benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor agonist drugs (GABAA receptor), although concerns persist regarding their safety and their limited efficacy. The use of these hypnotic medications must be carefully monitored for adverse effects. Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides have been shown to regulate transitions between wakefulness and sleep by promoting cholinergic/monoaminergic neural pathways. This has led to the development of a new class of pharmacological agents that antagonize the physiological effects of orexin. The development of these agents may lead to novel therapies for insomnia without the side effect profile of hypnotics (e.g., impaired cognition, disturbed arousal, and motor balance difficulties). However, antagonizing a system that regulates the sleep-wake cycle may create an entirely different side effect profile. In this review, we discuss the role of orexin and its receptors on the sleep-wake cycle and that of orexin antagonists in the treatment of insomnia.", 
    "187": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients may have increased concentrations of drugs in their blood. We hypothesized that this response is mainly due to a decrease in the expression and activity of the drug-metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 (CYP), in the liver. In this study, we have tried to demonstrate the hypothesis. UC was induced in mice by treatment with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) solution. The mRNA and protein expression levels of CYP, inflammatory cytokine levels, and the metabolic activity of CYP3A in the liver were measured. The nuclear translocations of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) were analyzed. The levels of hepatic inflammatory cytokines increased in the DSS-treated group. The hepatic mRNA and protein expression of CYP (CYP1A, CYP2C, CYP2D, CYP2E, and CYP3A) and the CYP3A metabolic activity significantly decreased compared to the control group. Hepatic NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation significantly increased in the DSS-treated group. In contrast, the nuclear translocations of PXR and CAR were decreased. Lipopolysaccharides from inflammatory sites in the colon induce hepatic inflammation in DSS-induced murine colitis. This inflammation then causes an increase in the nuclear translocation of hepatic NF-\u03baB and a decrease in the nuclear translocation of PXR and CAR, resulting in the decreased expression and activities of CYP. The results of this study indicated that at the onset of UC, the decreased activity of hepatic CYP causes an increase in the concentrations of drugs in the blood, leading to an increase in the incidence of adverse reactions.", 
    "188": "The purpose of this work was to develop and evaluate a fast, robust and specific UPLC-MS/MS screening platform for the determination and quantification of a variety of commonly used drugs of abuse in urine, i.e. a high-throughput quantitative analysis. Substances in the drug classes opioids, central nervous system stimulants and benzodiazepines and related agents were included in addition to cannabis and pregabalin, a total of 35 different analytes. Based on the concentrations and the physico-chemical properties of the substances, three UPLC-MS/MS methods were developed in parallel. Prior to analysis, sample preparation consisted of two different simple dilutions with 60 and 100 \u03bcL urine, respectively, using a Tecan Freedom Evo pipetting robot platform. A Waters Xevo TQ-S tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to a Waters I-class UPLC was used for quantitative analysis of one quantitative and one qualifying MRM transition for each analyte, except for tramadol for which the metabolite O-desmethyl-tramadol was included in the MRM method to confirm tramadol identity. Deuterated analogs were included as internal standards. The between-assay relative standard deviations varied from 2% to 11% and the limits of quantification were in the range 1-200 ng/mL for the various analytes. After development and initial testing, the method has been successfully implemented and routinely used at our hospital for quantitative screening of drugs of abuse in more than 35,000 urinary samples.", 
    "189": "Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) negatively influences spinal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic networks via a reduction in the neuron-specific potassium-chloride (K(+)-Cl(-)) cotransporter (KCC2). This process has been linked to the emergence of neuropathic allodynia. In\u00a0vivo pharmacologic and modeling studies show that a loss of KCC2 function results in a decrease in the efficacy of GABAA-mediated spinal inhibition. One potential strategy to mitigate this effect entails inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity to reduce HCO3(-)-dependent depolarization via GABAA receptors when KCC2 function is compromised. We have tested this hypothesis here. Our results show that, similarly to when KCC2 is pharmacologically blocked, PNI causes a loss of analgesic effect for neurosteroid GABAA allosteric modulators at maximally effective doses in na\u00efve mice in the tail-flick test. Remarkably, inhibition of carbonic anhydrase activity with intrathecal acetazolamide rapidly restores an analgesic effect for these compounds, suggesting an important role of carbonic anhydrase activity in regulating GABAA-mediated analgesia after PNI. Moreover, spinal acetazolamide administration leads to a profound reduction in the mouse formalin pain test, indicating that spinal carbonic anhydrase inhibition produces analgesia when primary afferent activity is driven by chemical mediators. Finally, we demonstrate that systemic administration of acetazolamide to rats with PNI produces an antiallodynic effect by itself and an enhancement of the peak analgesic effect with a change in the shape of the dose-response curve of the \u03b11-sparing benzodiazepine L-838,417. Thus, carbonic anhydrase inhibition mitigates the negative effects of loss of KCC2 function after nerve injury in multiple species and through multiple administration routes resulting in an enhancement of analgesic effects for several GABAA allosteric modulators. We suggest that carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, many of which are clinically available, might be advantageously employed for the treatment of pathologic pain states.", 
    "190": "Using behavioral pharmacology techniques, we show that spinal GABAA-mediated analgesia can be augmented, especially following nerve injury, via inhibition of carbonic anhydrases. Carbonic anhydrase inhibition alone also produces analgesia, suggesting these enzymes might be targeted for the treatment of pain.", 
    "191": "Priapism in children after a black widow spider bite is a rare phenomenon with only a few case reports noted in the literature. Black widow bites are commonly associated with pain, muscle cramping, hypertension, and tachycardia. Initial treatment includes pain control with opiate or opioid medications and benzodiazepines, with antivenom reserved for severe cases of envenomation manifested by uncontrolled pain or hypertension. Treatment with antivenom for priapism is not well described; however, it has been noted to resolve priapism in the few cases that have been reported. We present a case of a 3-year-old boy who was bitten by a black widow and presented with abdominal cramping and priapism.", 
    "192": "Excess inhibition in the brain of individuals carrying an extra copy of chromosome 21 could be responsible for cognitive deficits observed throughout their lives. A change in the excitatory/inhibitory balance in adulthood would alter synaptic plasticity, potentially triggering learning and memory deficits. \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature central nervous system and binds to GABAA receptors, opens a chloride channel, and reduces neuronal excitability. In this review we discuss methods to alleviate neuronal inhibition in a mouse model of Down syndrome, the Ts65Dn mouse, using either an antagonist (pentylenetetrazol) or two different inverse agonists selective for the \u03b15-subunit containing receptor. Both inverse agonists, which reduce inhibitory GABAergic transmission, could rescue learning and memory deficits in Ts65Dn mice. We also discuss safety issues since modulation of the excitatory-inhibitory balance to improve cognition without inducing seizures remains particularly difficult when using GABA antagonists.",

Factors associated with overdosing at home include female gender, college degree, residence in the borough of Staten Island, and combined use of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines. Factors associated with overdosing outside of the home include ages 35-64, residence in Manhattan, and use of heroin.", 
    "197": "The sample represents a near census of unintentional opioid overdose deaths in NYC during the study period, and allows for the identification of demographic and drug-using patterns by setting of overdose. Because most opioid overdoses occur inside the home, opioid overdose response programs can most efficiently address the epidemic by both reducing the risk of overdose in the home and targeting those who may be in the home at the time of an overdose for overdose response training. Approaches include minimizing risk of misuse and diversion through safe storage and safe disposal programs, physician education on prescribing of opioid analgesics and benzodiazepines, prescription of take-home naloxone, and Good Samaritan laws.",

The clinical features in two additional patients with GlyR antibodies are described. A 55-year-old man presented with stimulus-induced hyperekplexia and rigidity in the lower limbs and trunk. He initially responded to benzodiazepines, but presented after 18 months with severe, painful, prolonged spasms associated with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, hypoventilation and oxygen desaturation requiring intubation. He improved following treatment with clonazepam, baclofen and immunomodulatory therapies. A 58-year-old woman presented with stiffness in the legs and hyperekplexia associated with hypoventilation, at times leading to loss of consciousness. She responded to benzodiazepines and has remained in remission. The clinical picture associated with GlyR antibodies includes autonomic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias and hypoventilation. It is important to recognise these serious complications early to limit mortality from this treatable condition.", 
    "199": "Anxiety disturbances are recognized as common psychiatric comorbidities in Parkinson's disease (PD) and contribute to significant impairments in areas of cognitive, functional, motor and social performance. Anxiety in PD results in reduced quality of life, higher levels of care dependency and increased caregiver burden. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of treatment data. In one randomized, controlled study, bromazepam was found to be effective for anxiety in PD. However, usage of benzodiazepines in the PD population is limited by potential risk of confusion and falls. There are no controlled studies of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for anxiety in PD. However, results from uncontrolled studies suggest that SSRIs are effective for anxiety in PD, although in these studies anxiety outcomes were secondary. This review underscores that, given the high prevalence of anxiety disturbances in PD, there is a significant paucity of treatment data for this population. Additional studies are warranted. In the meantime, clinicians should rely on empiric assessments of known risks and putative benefits to guide treatment decisions. Cognitive and behavioral therapies (with or without pharmacotherapy) have demonstrated efficacy and warrant consideration. When feasible, a targeted and individualized multimodal approach utilizing psychotherapeutic interventions along with pharmacologic therapies should be considered.",

    "201": "We carried out a prospective, randomized, double blind controlled trial involving 63 consecutive consenting male patients admitted with diagnosis of uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal. The patients were randomized into two groups based on the type of lorazepam dosage: symptom-triggered (n = 33) and fixed tapering dose regimens (n = 30). Alcohol withdrawal symptoms were rated on CIWA-Ar (Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment - Alcohol revised). The main outcome measures were the total amount and duration of lorazepam treatment and the incidence of adverse events or complications.",

Equally significant correlations were found between values obtained with 2TCc and SRTM2 in raw and FA-denoised images (r=0.961 and 0.909 respectively, p<0.0001). Scans of at least 100min are required to obtain stable BPND values from raw images while scans of only 70min are sufficient from FA-denoised images. These images are also associated with significantly lower standard errors of 2TCc and SRTM2 BP values.",

    "212": "We normally assess another individual's level of consciousness based on her or his ability to interact with the surrounding environment and communicate. Usually, if we observe purposeful behavior, appropriate responses to sensory inputs, and, above all, appropriate answers to questions, we can be reasonably sure that the person is conscious. However, we know that consciousness can be entirely within the brain, even in the absence of any interaction with the external world; this happens almost every night, while we dream. Yet, to this day, we lack an objective, dependable measure of the level of consciousness that is independent of processing sensory inputs and producing appropriate motor outputs. Theoretically, consciousness is thought to require the joint presence of functional integration and functional differentiation, otherwise defined as brain complexity. Here we review a series of recent studies in which Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation combined with electroencephalography (TMS/EEG) has been employed to quantify brain complexity in wakefulness and during physiological (sleep), pharmacological (anesthesia) and pathological (brain injury) loss of consciousness. These studies invariably show that the complexity of the cortical response to TMS collapses when consciousness is lost during deep sleep, anesthesia and vegetative state following severe brain injury, while it recovers when consciousness resurges in wakefulness, during dreaming, in the minimally conscious state or locked-in syndrome. The present paper will also focus on how this approach may contribute to unveiling the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness affecting brain-injured patients. Finally, we will underline some crucial methodological aspects concerning TMS/EEG measurements of brain complexity.",

One technique that has not been well studied is surgeon-administered conscious sedation along with local anesthetic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of this technique with emphasis on safety, efficacy, and patient satisfaction. Chart review was performed on 133 consecutive patients who had anorectal procedures at an outpatient surgery center. Additionally, 65 patients were enrolled prospectively and completed a satisfaction survey. Inclusively, charts of 198 patients who underwent outpatient anorectal surgery under conscious sedation and local anesthesia under the direction of a colorectal surgeon from 2004 through 2008 were reviewed. Parameters related to patient and procedural characteristics, safety, efficacy, and satisfaction were evaluated. Surgeon-administered sedation consisted of combined fentanyl and midazolam in 90 per cent. Eighty per cent of procedures were performed in the prone position and 23 per cent were in combination with an endoscopic procedure. Eighty-two per cent were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists Grade 1 or 2. Transient mild hypoxemia or hypotension occurred in 4 and 3 per cent of the patients, respectively. Mean operative time was 29 minutes with a mean stay in the postanesthesia care unit of 37 minutes. There were no early major cardiac or respiratory complications. Ninety-seven per cent of the patients surveyed reported a high degree of satisfaction. Surgeon-administered conscious sedation with local anesthesia was well tolerated for outpatient anorectal surgeries.

    "233": "In patients with high-grade glioma seizures occur relatively frequently during the end-of-life phase. At some point, the use of oral anti-epileptic drugs is no longer possible due to swallowing difficulties caused by advanced tumour progression. We have established a draft guideline and propose that anti-epileptic drugs be prescribed by alternative routes of administration in the end-of-life phase in glioma patients with known epilepsy who develop swallowing difficulties. Buccal clonazepam would be our drug of first choice as a maintenance treatment in addition to intranasal midazolam for the acute management of seizures. Adequate treatment of epileptic seizures, particularly during the end-of-life phase, can help to maintain quality of life as long as possible in patients with high-grade glioma.", 
    "234": "Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) declines during postnatal development and is absent beyond postnatal day 110 if mice are raised in standard cages (SCs). An enriched environment (EE) promotes OD plasticity in adult rats. Here, we explored cellular mechanisms of EE in mouse V1 and the therapeutic potential of EE to prevent impairments of plasticity after a cortical stroke. Using in vivo optical imaging, we observed that monocular deprivation in adult EE mice (i) caused a very strong OD plasticity previously only observed in 4-wk-old animals, (ii) restored already lost OD plasticity in adult SC-raised mice, and (iii) preserved OD plasticity after a stroke in the primary somatosensory cortex. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology in vitro, we also show that (iv) local inhibition was significantly reduced in V1 slices of adult EE mice and (v) the GABA/AMPA ratio was like that in 4-wk-old SC-raised animals. These observations were corroborated by in vivo analyses showing that diazepam treatment significantly reduced the OD shift of EE mice after monocular deprivation. Taken together, EE extended the sensitive phase for OD plasticity into late adulthood, rejuvenated V1 after 4 mo of SC-rearing, and protected adult mice from stroke-induced impairments of cortical plasticity. The EE effect was mediated most likely by preserving low juvenile levels of inhibition into adulthood, which potentially promoted adaptive changes in cortical circuits.", 
    "235": "A cocktail approach can detect the activities of multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms following the administration of multiple CYP-specific substrates in a single experiment. This study aimed to develop a simultaneous and comprehensive in vivo analysis of CYP activity in rats. The rats received an oral administration of losartan (10 mg/kg) and omeprazole (40 mg/kg). Caffeine (1 mg/kg), dextromethorphan (10 mg/kg) and midazolam (10 mg/kg) were administered 15 min later. In the drug-interaction phase, the rats were treated orally with dexamethasone (80 mg/kg) 24 h before, or with ketoconazole (10 mg/kg), fluvoxamine (100 mg kg) or fluconazole (10 mg/kg) 1 h before the administration of cocktail drugs. The concentrations of the drugs and their metabolites were determined by LC/MS/MS. Plasma concentrations of five CYP substrates and their metabolites were simultaneously evaluated after the oral drug administration. Fluvoxamine and fluconazole significantly increased the Cmax and AUC of caffeine, and the AUC of omeprazole and midazolam. Dexamethasone significantly increased Cmax and AUC of losartan, while it decreased the Cmax of midazolam. Ketoconazole showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic parameters of the tested drugs. In conclusion, a cocktail approach was developed for simultaneous and comprehensive analysis of the activities of multiple CYP isoforms in rats. In this approach, the effects of inhibitors and an inducer of various CYP isoforms were examined. Although further studies are necessary to predict the effects in humans, this approach may be expected to serve as a convenient method for detecting drug-drug interactions in rats.",

    "237": "Our cross-sectional study included 120 patients examined at the University of Bologna Centre for Sleep Disorders, Bologna, Italy, and met all four International RLS criteria for the diagnosis of RLS. Each patient underwent a semistructured telephone interview investigating demographic data and general health status, RLS features and severity, presence of excessive daytime sleepiness, and presence of NES.", 
    "238": "The sample included 37 men and 83 women with a mean age of 63.8\u00b111.5 years. There were 31% of patients who reported episodes of nocturnal eating (NE); among them, 17% fulfilled the new diagnostic criteria for NES. Comparing RLS patients with and without NE, there were no differences in RLS features. However, RLS patients with NE were older (67.2\u00b111.6 vs. 62.4\u00b111; P=.038), were in a higher body mass index (BMI) range (27.7\u00b13.8 vs. 26.1\u00b14.1 kg/m2; P=.023), were taking more drugs for concomitant diseases (89% vs. 72%; P=.031), were more likely to report insomnia (40% vs. 23%; P=.041), and were using more hypnotic agents (37.8% vs. 19.3%; P=.050) and dopaminergic drugs (65% vs. 46%; P=.041). When comparing those RLS patients with NES diagnostic criteria and those without NES, no differences emerged in demographic, clinical, and RLS features; however, NES patients were in a higher BMI range (28.3\u00b14.1 vs. 26.2\u00b13.9kg/m(2), P=.037), were more frequently smokers (43% vs 17%; P=.027), and were more frequently using hypnotic agents (30% vs. 24%; P=.025). Lastly, no differences were found when comparing patients with a NES diagnosis and those with NE not fitting the diagnostic criteria for NES, except for a higher use of benzodiazepine drugs (BDZ) in this latter subgroup (29% vs. zero; P=.014).", 
    "239": "A nocturnal compulsion to eat seems to be an intrinsic part of the clinical spectrum of RLS manifestations and an odd risk factor for increases in BMI in RLS patients. However, it is still not clear if NE in RLS would fit in one of the two known categorized syndromes of NE (i.e., sleep-related eating disorder [SRED] or NES) or if it represents a different strictly RLS-related eating behavior.", 
    "240": "Matrix effects (MEs) are a major problem affecting the quantitative accuracy of liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) when analyzing complicated samples. While analyzing urine specimens, the wide diversity of endogenous materials and different urine concentrations may result in inaccurate quantification. In this study, we propose a postcolumn-infused internal standard (PCI-IS) strategy for universal correction of MEs in urine specimens. MEs can be effectively corrected by dividing the target analyte signal intensity by the PCI-IS intensity. To evaluate the performance of PCI-IS, we used 6 benzodiazepine (BZD) drugs in 5 different concentrations of urine matrixes as a test model. The divergence of the BZD drug signal responses in 5 different urine matrixes was expressed using their respective coefficients of variation (CV) to evaluate the efficiency of using PCI-IS in correcting matrix effects. The CV of the BZD drug signal intensities in these 5 different concentrations of the urine matrixes were reduced from 10 to 30% to less than 10% when the PCI-IS correction method was employed. When the PCI-IS method was used to correct the 6 BZDs in 25 real human urine samples, over 90% of the test results exhibited quantification errors of less than 20%, and all of the test results had quantification errors of less than 30%. These results demonstrate that the PCI-IS method can resolve the problem of inaccurate quantification that arises from the diversity of urine specimens. The PCI-IS method is particularly useful for clinical analysis or forensic toxicology to improve the quantification accuracy in an economical way.",

We sought to retrospectively evaluate the long-term efficacy of high-dose oral diazepam in reducing electrographic and clinical evidence of electrical status epilepticus during slow wave sleep in children. Additionally, we surveyed caregivers to assess safety and behavioral outcomes related to ongoing therapy.",

    "245": "The anticonvulsant valproic acid and the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and quetiapine provide synergistic mood-stabilising, antidepressant and antipsychotic activities in the treatment of bipolar and schizoaffective disorders. Existing literature shows that pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics drug-drug interactions (DDIs) possibly occur with the use of such a combination. Clinical reports of a possible interaction between the drugs leading to an increased risk of adverse drug reactions have also emerged. The main objective of this paper is to review the incidence of DDIs between the anticonvulsant and the antipsychotics, to postulate the possible mechanisms of the interaction and to establish whether certain target populations are at an increased susceptibility to such interactions. The usefulness of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of the antipsychotics to monitor for an interaction was also assessed. A systematic database search was carried out using the search engine provided by PubMed using the following key words: olanzapine, quetiapine, valproic acid, pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction, bipolar disorder, therapeutic drug monitoring.",

Several in vitro studies determined whether CAM can inhibit CYP3A4, but these studies revealed contradictory results. A plausible explanation for these conflicting results is the use only of a single model CYP3A4 substrate in each study. Therefore, the objective was to determine the potential of selected CAM (\u03b2-carotene, Echinacea, garlic, Ginkgo biloba, ginseng, grape seed extract, green tea extract, milk thistle, saw palmetto, valerian, vitamin B6, B12 and C) to inhibit CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of different substrates: 7-benzyloxy-4-trifluoromethyl-coumarin (BFC), midazolam and docetaxel. The effect of CAM on CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of an anticancer drug has never been determined before in vitro, which makes this study unique. The oncolytic CYP3A4 substrate docetaxel was used to establish the predictive value of the model substrates for pharmacokinetic interactions between CAM and anticancer drugs in vitro, and to more closely predict these interactions in vivo.",

    "256": "Omeprazole (OMP) is effective in the treatment of gastric hyperacidity and is metabolized by CYP2C19 and CYP3A4. These enzymes are modulated by estrogen and progesterone which regulate the menstrual cycle. The variations in the pharmacokinetics (PK) of many drugs like amphetamine, benzodiazepines and caffeine have been reported during menstrual cycle. In present study, the PK of the omeprazole and its metabolites was investigated during various phases of the menstrual cycle. A single oral dose, open-label, non-controlled, pharmacokinetic study of omeprazole was conducted in healthy young/premenopausal females (n = 16). The PK of omeprazole, 5-hydroxy-omeprazole and omeprazole sulphone was evaluated in three phases of menstrual cycle. The blood samples were analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC coupled with UV detector and the PK data were evaluated. The activities of CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 were determined as AUC(OH-OMP)/AUC(OMP) and AUC(OMP-SUL)/AUC(OMP), respectively. Omeprazole showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher [Formula: see text] and CL/F in follicular and menstrual phases, respectively. The [Formula: see text] of 5-hydroxy omeprazole was also significantly (p < 0.05) higher in follicular phase. The metabolic ratios (MR) of 5-hydroxy omeprazole and omeprazole sulphone were lower in follicular phase compared with the luteal phase. The present study suggests that high estrogen levels of follicular phase may result in increased absorption of omeprazole. The lower MR for 5-hydroxy omeprazole and omeprazole sulphone in follicular phase as compared to luteal phase suggests that metabolism of omeprazole is low in follicular phase as compared to luteal phase, which is progesterone-dominant phase. However, the clinical significance for these findings needs to be determined.", 
    "257": "A method for the simple and reliable determination of triazolam and midazolam in human plasma using gas chromatography with microelectron capture detection has been developed. Samples (0.5 mL of plasma) were prepared using a simple solvent extraction with 3% isoamyl alcohol/benzene in the presence of NaOH. Two microlitres of the extract were injected onto the capillary column ((5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane). The method was found to be valid in terms of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery over the concentration range of 0.2 to 20 ng/mL for triazolam, and from 0.5 to 200 ng/mL for midazolam, respectively. Intra- and inter-day precisions determined at three concentrations were from 4.1 to 9.3% for triazolam and from 2.9 to 13.0% for midazolam. The accuracies were within 17.7% for triazolam and within 13.0% for midazolam. This proposed method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of triazolam or midazolam in healthy volunteers."
