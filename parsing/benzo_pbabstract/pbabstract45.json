The importance of this layered organization for cortical processing and plasticity is little understood. We investigated the structure, function and plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1) of adult mice deficient for the glycoprotein reelin and their wild-type littermates. In V1 of rl-/- mice, cells with different laminar fates are present at all cortical depths. Surprisingly, the (vertically) disorganized cortex maintains a precise retinotopic (horizontal) organization. Rl-/- mice have normal basic visual capabilities, but are compromised in more challenging perceptual tasks, such as orientation discrimination. Additionally, rl-/- animals learn and memorize a visual task as well as their wild-type littermates. Interestingly, reelin deficiency enhances visual cortical plasticity: juvenile-like ocular dominance plasticity is preserved into late adulthood. The present data offer an important insight into the capabilities of a disorganized cortical system to maintain basic functional properties.", 
    "1": "The scope of this research is to identify the major risk factors associated with accidental falls among the elderly. It involves an integrative review of the literature between 2002 and 2012 in English and Portuguese. The selection of articles was based on the following key words in the Lilacs, Medline and BDENF databases: accidental falls, homes for the elderly and health services. In the final sample 19 articles were selected, of which 11 were national and 8 were international. They indicate that the major factors related to the risk of accidental falls in Homes for the Elderly are: being female, being diagnosed with chronic disease, treatment with benzodiazepine, earlier cases of accident falls, and mobility restriction. The research reveals that architectonic and furniture inadequacies in Homes for the Elderly may be predisposing factors for accidental falls. Analysis of the articles reveals the need for further longitudinal studies and, consequently, enhanced monitoring of the conditions of the functional capacity of the elderly, especially the risks related to falls, considered one of the leading causes of death among institutionalized elderly individuals.", 
    "2": "Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene have been associated with Parkinson's disease, and its inhibition opens potential new therapeutic options. Among the drug inhibitors of both wild-type and mutant LRRK2 forms is the 2-arylmethyloxy-5-subtitutent-N-arylbenzamide GSK257815A. Using the well-established dopaminergic cell culture model SH-SY5Y, we have investigated the effects of GSK2578215A on crucial neurodegenerative features such as mitochondrial dynamics and autophagy. GSK2578215A induces mitochondrial fragmentation of an early step preceding autophagy. This increase in autophagosome results from inhibition of fusion rather than increases in synthesis. The observed effects were shared with LRRK2-IN-1, a well-described, structurally distinct kinase inhibitor compound or when knocking down LRRK2 expression using siRNA. Studies using the drug mitochondrial division inhibitor 1 indicated that translocation of the dynamin-related protein-1 has a relevant role in this process. In addition, autophagic inhibitors revealed the participation of autophagy as a cytoprotective response by removing damaged mitochondria. GSK2578215A induced oxidative stress as evidenced by the accumulation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal in SH-SY5Y cells. The mitochondrial-targeted reactive oxygen species scavenger MitoQ positioned these species as second messengers between mitochondrial morphologic alterations and autophagy. Altogether, our results demonstrated the relevance of LRRK2 in mitochondrial-activated pathways mediating in autophagy and cell fate, crucial features in neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "3": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive malignancy caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1. There is no accepted curative therapy for ATL. We have reported that certain ATL patients have increased Notch-1 signaling along with constitutive activation of the nuclear factor-\u03baB pathway. Physical and functional interaction between these two pathways provides the rationale to combine the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor compound E with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Moreover, romidepsin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, has demonstrated major antitumor action in leukemia/lymphoma. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the single agents and the combination of these agents in a murine model of human ATL, the MT-1 model. Single and double agents inhibited tumor growth as monitored by tumor size (P<0.05), and prolonged survival of leukemia-bearing mice (P<0.05) compared with the control group. The combination of three agents significantly enhanced the antitumor efficacy as assessed by tumor size, tumor markers in the serum (human soluble interleukin-2 receptor-\u03b1 and \u03b22-microglobulin) and survival of the MT-1 tumor-bearing mice, compared with all other treatment groups (P<0.05). Improved therapeutic efficacy obtained by combining compound E, bortezomib and romidepsin supports a clinical trial of this combination in the treatment of ATL.", 
    "4": "Latency to first pharmacological treatment [duration of untreated illness (DUI)] in psychiatric disorders can be measured in years, with differences across diagnostic areas and relevant consequences in terms of socio-occupational functioning and outcome. Within the psychopathological onset of a specific disorder, many factors influence access and latency to first pharmacotherapy and the present study aimed to investigate such factors, through an ad-hoc developed questionnaire, in a sample of 538 patients with diagnoses of schizophrenia-spectrum disorder (SZ), mood disorder (MD), and anxiety disorder (AD). Patients with SZs showed earlier ages at onset, first diagnosis and treatment, as well as shorter DUI compared with other patients (43.17 months vs. 58.64 and 80.43 months in MD and AD; F=3.813, P=0.02). Patients with MD and AD reported more frequently onset-related stressful events, benzodiazepines as first treatment, and autonomous help seeking compared with patients with SZs. In terms of first therapist, psychiatrist referral accounted for 43.6% of the cases, progressively decreasing from SZ to MD and AD (57.6, 41.8, and 38.3%, respectively). The opposite phenomenon was observed for nonpsychiatrist clinician referrals, whereas psychologist referrals remained constant. The present findings confirm the presence of a relevant DUI in a large sample of Italian patients with different psychiatric disorders (5 years, on average), pointing out specific differences, in terms of treatment access and latency, between psychotic and affective patients. Such aspects are relevant for detection of at-risk patients and implement early intervention programs.",

    "27": "The pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) are a group of sequence-selective, DNA minor-groove binding agents that covalently attach to guanine residues. Originally derived from Streptomyces species, a number of naturally occurring PBD monomers exist with varying A-Ring and C2-substituents. One such agent, sibiromycin, is unusual in having a glycosyl residue (sibirosamine) at its A-Ring C7-position. It is the most cytotoxic member of the naturally occurring PBD family and has the highest DNA-binding affinity. Recently, the analogue 9-deoxysibiromyin was produced biosynthetically by Yonemoto and co-workers.1 Differing only in the loss of the A-Ring C9-hydroxyl group, it was reported to have a significantly higher DNA-binding affinity than sibiromycin based on DNA thermal denaturation studies, although these data have since been retracted.2 As deletion of the C9-OH moiety, which points toward the DNA minor groove floor, might intuitively be expected to reduce DNA-binding affinity through the loss of hydrogen bonding, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations on the interaction of both molecules with DNA over a 10 ns time-course in explicit solvent. Our results suggest that the two molecules may differ in their sequence-selectivity and that 9-deoxysibiromycin should have a lower binding affinity for certain sequences of DNA compared to sibiromycin. Our molecular dynamics results indicate that the C7-sibirosamine sugar does not form hydrogen bonding interactions with groups in the DNA minor-groove wall as previously reported, but instead points orthogonally out from the minor groove where it may inhibit the approach of DNA control proteins such as transcription factors. This was confirmed through a docking study involving sibiromycin and the GAL4 transcription factor, and these results could explain the significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of sibiromycin compared to other PBD family members without bulky C7-substituents.",

Four medication classes accounted for over 80 % of medication changes. These were anti-emetics, opioid analgesics, anti-cholinergic agents acting on the bladder and benzodiazepines/hypnotics. Intervention was statistically significantly more likely to be possible in the case of p.r.n. medicines compared to regular medicines (p < 0.001, Chi square test).

    "38": "Electrical stimulation of midbrain tectum structures, particularly the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) and inferior colliculus (IC), produces defensive responses such as freezing and escape behavior. Freezing also results after termination of this stimulation (post-stimulation freezing; PSF). Whereas these responses are critically mediated by GABA in the dPAG, it is unclear how GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms mediate the expression of fear (freezing and escape behaviors) and the processing of aversive information (PSF) produced by electrical stimulation of the IC. Since dorsal (ICd) and ventral regions (ICv) of the IC react differentially to aversive stimulation, we hypothesized that these regions might be sensitive to the action of benzodiazepine drugs when rats are submitted to animal models of anxiety: the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the IC electrical stimulation procedure. Midazolam (5, 10 or 20 nmol) was injected into the ICd or ICv of rats subjected to one of these tests. Intra-ICv, but not intra-ICd injections, of midazolam reduced the aversiveness of the IC electrical stimulation and decreased fear in the EPM, as assessed by its traditional and complementary measures. In contrast, the IC post-stimulation freezing remained unaltered with midazolam treatments. Thus, there is a clear pharmacological dissociation in the reactivity of dorsal and ventral regions of the IC to fear-provoking stimuli of the two animal models of anxiety used in this study. The present results support the proposal that benzodiazepine-mediated mechanisms are only involved in the output mechanisms of defensive behavior and not involved in the processing of ascending aversive information from the IC.",

We applied multi-electrode array (MEA) recording methods to study the spontaneous firing activity of neocortical cultures obtained from mice expressing or not (WT) an ADNFLE-linked nAChR subunit (\u03b22-V287L). More than 100,000 up-states were recorded during experiments sampling from several thousand neurons. Data were analyzed by using a fast sliding-window procedure which computes histograms of the up-state durations. Differently from the WT, cultures expressing \u03b22-V287L displayed long (10-32 s) synaptic-induced up-state firing events. The occurrence of such long up-states was prevented by both negative (gabazine, penicillin G) and positive (benzodiazepines) modulators of GABAA receptors. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a drug of choice in ADNFLE patients, also inhibited the long up-states at micromolar concentrations. In cultures expressing \u03b22-V287L, no significant effect was observed on the action potential waveform either in the absence or in the presence of pharmacological treatment. Our results show that some aspects of the spontaneous hyperexcitability displayed by a murine model of a human channelopathy can be reproduced in neuronal cultures. In particular, our cultures represent an in vitro chronic model of spontaneous epileptiform activity, i.e., not requiring pre-treatment with convulsants. This opens the way to the study in vitro of the role of \u03b22-V287L on synaptic formation. Moreover, our neocortical cultures on MEA platforms allow to determine the effects of prolonged pharmacological treatment on spontaneous network hyperexcitability (which is impossible in the short-living brain slices). Methods such as the one we illustrate in the present paper should also considerably facilitate the preliminary screening of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), thereby reducing the number of in vivo experiments.",

Based on these results, a series of clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on sensitive substrates of CYP2C8 (rosiglitazone), CYP3A (midazolam), CYP2D6 (desipramine), and P-gp (digoxin). In addition, a DDI study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ivacaftor on a combined oral contraceptive, as this is considered an important comedication in CF patients. The results indicate ivacaftor is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and P-gp, but has no effect on CYP2C8 or CYP2D6. Ivacaftor caused non-clinically significant increases in ethinyl estradiol and norethisterone exposure. Based on these results, caution and appropriate monitoring are recommended when concomitant substrates of CYP2C9, CYP3A and/or P-gp are used during treatment with ivacaftor, particularly drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, such as warfarin.",

Neuroimaging and EEG are not required immediately in workup for simple or complex febrile seizures. Recurrence of febrile seizures may be managed at home by the parents with benzodiazepines. If the recurrences are multiple or prolonged and parents are unable to give home treatment, intermittent benzodiazepine prophylaxis may be given. Continuous antiepileptic prophylaxis may be given only to the children where intermittent prophylaxis has failed. Febrile seizures are also associated with increased risk of epilepsy, but this cannot be prevented by any form of treatment.

A data base search and search in a clinical drug interaction data base were conducted. Thereafter, a systematic assessment of publications was performed. Seven in vitro studies on six CYP 450 isoenzymes, on p-glycoprotein, and on two UGT isoenzymes were identified. However, the methodological assessment of these studies did not support their suitability for the prediction of clinically relevant interactions. In addition, clinical studies on various valerian preparations did not reveal any relevant interaction potential concerning CYP 1A2, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4. Available animal and human pharmacodynamic studies did not verify any interaction potential. The interaction potential of valerian preparations therefore seems to be low and thereby without clinical relevance. We conclude that there is no specific evidence questioning their safety, also in cancer patients.",

In addition, on electroencephalogram (EEG) spikes at vertex preceded myoclonic jerk of the right tibialis anterior muscle in both patients. These findings indicate that focal cortical reflex myoclonus was accompanied by acute central nervous system (CNS) infection.

    "144": "Olanzapine is the one of first line antipsychotic drug for schizophrenia and other serious mental illness. However, it is associated with troublesome metabolic side-effects, particularly body weight gain and obesity. The antagonistic affinity to histamine H1 receptors (H1R) of antipsychotic drugs has been identified as one of the main contributors to weight gain/obesity side-effects. Our previous study showed that a short term (2 weeks) combination treatment of betahistine (an H1R agonist and H3R antagonist) and olanzapine (O+B) reduced (-45%) body weight gain induced by olanzapine in drug-na\u00efve rats. A key issue is that clinical patients suffering with schizophrenia, bipolar disease and other mental disorders often face chronic, even life-time, antipsychotic treatment, in which they have often had previous antipsychotic exposure. Therefore, we investigated the effects of chronic O+B co-treatment in controlling body weight in female rats with chronic and repeated exposure of olanzapine. The results showed that co-administration of olanzapine (3 mg/kg, t.i.d.) and betahistine (9.6 mg/kg, t.i.d.) significantly reduced (-51.4%) weight gain induced by olanzapine. Co-treatment of O+B also led to a decrease in feeding efficiency, liver and fat mass. Consistently, the olanzapine-only treatment increased hypothalamic H1R protein levels, as well as hypothalamic pAMPK\u03b1, AMPK\u03b1 and NPY protein levels, while reducing the hypothalamic POMC, and UCP1 and PGC-1\u03b1 protein levels in brown adipose tissue (BAT). The olanzapine induced changes in hypothalamic H1R, pAMPK\u03b1, BAT UCP1 and PGC-1\u03b1 could be reversed by co-treatment of O+B. These results supported further clinical trials to test the effectiveness of co-treatment of O+B for controlling weight gain/obesity side-effects in schizophrenia with chronic antipsychotic treatment.",

The present within-subject, single-blind, placebo-controlled study measured changes in GABA in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and thalamus of volunteers maintained on SSRIs for the treatment of MDD (n=14) following zolpidem (10mg) administration. In addition to neurochemical measurements obtained using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) at 4 T, a series of questionnaires were administered to assess subjective effects associated with acute zolpidem exposure. Zolpidem elevated GABA levels in both voxels of interest (P<0.05) in the depressed participants, which could imply normalization, given the lower baseline levels associated with depression. The subjective drug experience in the depressed cohort was similar to that reported previously by healthy volunteers, and no relationships existed between GABA increases and the observed behavioral effects.

Although the \u03b32 subunit is believed to be essential for the postsynaptic clustering of GABAARs, synaptic currents have been detected in neurons obtained from \u03b32(-/-) mice. To determine the role of the \u03b32 subunit in synaptic GABAAR enrichment, we performed a spatially and temporally controlled \u03b32 subunit deletion by injecting Cre-expressing viral vectors into the neocortex of GABAAR\u03b32(77I)lox mice. Whole-cell recordings revealed the presence of miniature IPSCs in Cre(+) layer 2/3 pyramidal cells (PCs) with unchanged amplitudes and rise times, but significantly prolonged decays. Such slowly decaying currents could be evoked in PCs by action potentials in presynaptic fast-spiking interneurons. Freeze-fracture replica immunogold labeling revealed the presence of the \u03b11 and \u03b23 subunits in perisomatic synapses of cells that lack the \u03b32 subunit. Miniature IPSCs in Cre(+) PCs were insensitive to low concentrations of flurazepam, providing a pharmacological confirmation of the lack of the \u03b32 subunit. Receptors assembled from only \u03b1\u03b2 subunits were unlikely because Zn(2+) did not block the synaptic currents. Pharmacological experiments indicated that the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b33 receptor, rather than the \u03b1\u03b2\u03b4, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b5, or \u03b1\u03b2\u03b31 receptors, was responsible for the slowly decaying IPSCs. Our data demonstrate the presence of IPSCs and the synaptic enrichment of the \u03b11 and \u03b23 subunits and suggest that the \u03b33 subunit is the most likely candidate for clustering GABAARs at synapses in the absence of the \u03b32 subunit.",

While neuroactive steroids, such as pregnanolone, act primarily at \u03b3-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors, other mechanisms might contribute to their behavioral effects and could increase their clinical effectiveness, as compared with drugs acting exclusively at GABAA receptors (e.g., benzodiazepines). The current study examined the role of non-GABAA receptors, including N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and serotonin3 (5-HT3) receptors, in the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone. Separate groups of rats discriminated either 3.2mg/kg pregnanolone from vehicle or 0.32mg/kg of the benzodiazepine midazolam from vehicle while responding under a fixed-ratio 10 schedule for food pellets. When administered alone in both groups, pregnanolone and midazolam produced \u226580% drug-lever responding, the NMDA receptor antagonists dizocilpine and phencyclidine produced \u226560 and \u226530% drug-lever responding, respectively, and the 5-HT3 receptor agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (CPBG) and morphine produced <20% drug-lever responding up to doses that markedly decreased response rates. When studied together, neither dizocilpine, phencyclidine, CPBG nor morphine significantly altered the midazolam dose-effect curve in either group. Given that CPBG is without effect, it is unlikely that 5-HT3 receptors contribute substantially to the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone. Similarities across groups in effects of dizocilpine and phencyclidine suggest that NMDA receptors do not differentially contribute to the effects of pregnanolone. Thus, NMDA and 5-HT3 receptors are not involved in the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone.", 
    "191": "Ankle fractures are commonly treated by orthopaedic surgeons and often require manipulative reduction. This can be painful for the patient and frequently uses 2 or more providers. Intra-articular injection of local anesthetic into the ankle joint precludes the need for conscious sedation (intravenous narcotics and benzodiazepines, propofol, or ketamine). By combining an ankle block with a modification of the classic ankle fracture reduction technique described by Quigley 1959, a single provider can effectively perform a manipulative reduction and splinting of an ankle fracture without conscious sedation.", 
    "192": "Declarative long-term memories are not created in an instant. Gradual stabilization and temporally shifting dependence of acquired declarative memories in different brain regions-called systems consolidation-can be tracked in time by lesion experiments. The observation of temporally graded retrograde amnesia (RA) following hippocampal lesions points to a gradual transfer of memory from hippocampus to neocortical long-term memory. Spontaneous reactivations of hippocampal memories, as observed in place cell reactivations during slow-wave-sleep, are supposed to drive neocortical reinstatements and facilitate this process. We propose a functional neural network implementation of these ideas and furthermore suggest an extended three-state framework that includes the prefrontal cortex (PFC). It bridges the temporal chasm between working memory percepts on the scale of seconds and consolidated long-term memory on the scale of weeks or months. We show that our three-stage model can autonomously produce the necessary stochastic reactivation dynamics for successful episodic memory consolidation. The resulting learning system is shown to exhibit classical memory effects seen in experimental studies, such as retrograde and anterograde amnesia (AA) after simulated hippocampal lesioning; furthermore the model reproduces peculiar biological findings on memory modulation, such as retrograde facilitation of memory after suppressed acquisition of new long-term memories-similar to the effects of benzodiazepines on memory.", 
    "193": "Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a result of the sudden discontinuation of fetal exposure to substances that were used or abused by the mother during pregnancy. Withdrawal from licit or illicit substances is becoming more common among neonates in both developed and developing countries. NAS continues to be an important clinical entity throughout much of the world. NAS leads to a constellation of signs and symptoms involving multiple systems. The pathophysiology of NAS is not completely understood. Urine or meconium confirmation may assist the diagnosis and management of NAS. The Finnegan scoring system is commonly used to assess the severity of NAS; scoring can be helpful for initiating, monitoring, and terminating treatment in neonates. Nonpharmacological care is the initial treatment option, and pharmacological treatment is required if an improvement is not observed after nonpharmacological measures or if the infant develops severe withdrawal. Morphine is the most commonly used drug in the treatment of NAS secondary to opioids. An algorithmic approach to the management of infants with NAS is suggested. Breastfeeding is not contraindicated in NAS, unless the mother is taking street drugs, is involved in polydrug abuse, or is infected with HIV. Future studies are required to assess the long-term effects of NAS on children after prenatal exposure.",

For patients of group D, Dexmedetomidine (i.v., loading dose: 1 microg/kg, and succedent dose: 0.2-1 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) was given. For patients of group M, Midazolam (i.v., loading dose: 0.05 mg/kg, succedent dose: 0.01-0.03 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1)) was given. Arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2), arterial carbondioxide tension (PaCO2), O2 saturation (SPO2), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), anesthetic effect, time of spontaneous breathing recovery, and time of resuscitation were recorded before operation (T0), immediately after skin incision (T1), immediately after sternotomy (T2), before suspension of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB, T3), immediately after cardiac re-beating (T4), immediately after CPB cessation (T5), and at the end of surgery (T6).",

The generally low efficiencies of conventional wastewater treatment processes for the removal of this type of pollutants demands for the development of alternative or complementary water and wastewater treatment technologies, among which adsorption processes have been gaining popularity, provided that cheap efficient adsorbents are found. Clay materials have been one of the popular choices in this regard. In the present study, quantum chemical calculations have been performed by periodic DFT using the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method to characterize the interactions of two benzodiazepine molecules, alprazolam and diazepam, with a surface of clay mineral, vermiculite. It was observed that both molecules interact strongly with the vermiculite surface, both through a water-bridge binding and by cation-bridge provided by the exchangeable Mg(2+) cations of the vermiculite surface. The results point to an interesting potential of vermiculite to be used efficiently as filter medium to remove these pollutants from water and wastewater.",

Similarly, heart rate showed a significant increase from baseline following discontinuation of dexmedetomidine. Starting dexmedetomidine was not associated with a significant difference in the dosing of opiates or benzodiazepines. Comfort scores were significantly lower at 2 and 72 hours of dexmedetomidine infusion. After stopping dexmedetomidine, the comfort score for patients at 1 hour was statistically higher than for patients at cessation of the infusion.

    "210": "A wealth of evidence indicates that changes in procedural parameters and/or environmental conditions may exert a remarkable influence on the basal expression of defensive behaviors in different animal tests of anxiety. The goal of the current study was to further investigate the influence of procedural factors upon inhibitory avoidance acquisition and escape expression of male Wistar rats exposed to the elevated T-maze. These responses have been related in terms of psychopathology to generalized anxiety and panic disorders, respectively. Our results showed that the expression of these behaviors is not affected by prior handling of the animals or by increasing the illumination level of the experimental room from 60 to 580lx. They also showed that enhancing the number of avoidance trials from 3 to 6 favors the acquisition of this behavior. Under this condition, both diazepam (2mg/kg) and clonazepam (1-4mg/kg) caused anxiolytic effects, but only the latter benzodiazepine impaired escape expression, a panicolytic-like effect. In animals exposed to the elevated T-maze whole apparatus 24h before the test, the anxiolytic effect of these drugs was canceled out, which is consistent with the one-trial tolerance phenomenon widely observed in the elevated plus-maze. This procedure, however, does not interfere with the anti-escape effect caused by clonazepam. These results suggest that a 6-trial avoidance learning protocol may be a useful measure for compensating possible individual differences in the acquisition of this defensive response and to improve drug detection in the test.", 
    "211": "Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are defined as alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence, which create large problems both for society and for the drinkers themselves. To date, no therapeutic can effectively solve these problems. Understanding the underlying mechanisms leading to AUD is critically important for developing effective and safe pharmacological therapies. Benzodiazepines (BZs) are used to reduce the symptoms of alcohol withdrawal syndrome. However, frequent use of BZs causes cross-tolerance, dependence, and cross-addiction to alcohol. The FDA-approved naltrexone and acamprosate have shown mixed results in clinical trials. Naltrexone is effective to treat alcohol dependence (decreased length and frequency of drinking bouts), but its severe side effects, including withdrawal symptoms, are difficult to overcome. Acamprosate showed efficacy for treating alcohol dependence in European trials, but two large US trials have failed to confirm the efficacy. Another FDA-approved medication, disulfiram, does not diminish craving, and it causes a peripheral neuropathy. Kudzu is the only natural medication mentioned by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, but its mechanisms of action are not yet established. It has been recently shown that dihydromyricetin, a flavonoid purified from Hovenia, has unique effects on GABAA receptors and blocks ethanol intoxication and withdrawal in alcoholic animal models. In this article, we review the role of GABAA receptors in the treatment of AUD and currently available and potentially novel pharmacological agents.",

The purpose of this prospective study was to compare effects of two different clinically applicable anesthetic protocols on cardiovascular parameters and 64-MDCT-CA quality in 10 healthy dogs. Scan protocols and bolus volumes were standardized. Image evaluations were performed in random order by a board-certified veterinary radiologist who was unaware of anesthetic protocols used. Heart rate during image acquisition did not differ between protocols (P = 1), with 80.6 \u00b1 7.5 bpm for protocol A and 79.2 \u00b1 14.2 bpm for protocol B. Mean blood pressure was significantly higher (P > 0.05) using protocol B (protocol A 62.9 \u00b1 9.1 vs. protocol B 72.4 \u00b1 15.9 mmHg). The R-R intervals allowing for best depiction of individual coronary artery segments were found in the end diastolic period and varied between the 70% and 95% interval. Diagnostic quality was rated excellent, good, and moderate in the majority of the segments evaluated, with higher scores given for more proximal segments and lower for more distal segments, respectively. Blur was the most commonly observed artifact and mainly affected the distal segments. No significant differences were identified between the two protocols for optimal reconstruction interval, diagnostic quality and measured length individual segments, or proximal diameter of the coronary arteries (P = 1). Findings indicated that, when used with a standardized bolus volume, both of these anesthetic protocols yielded diagnostic quality coronary 64-MDCT-CA exams in healthy dogs.",

The aim of the study was to find whether tobacco smoke and enrichment living conditions have the influence on cognitive functions in the newborn offspring of prenatally stressed rats and whether drugs such as ARI (1.5 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and OLA (0.5 mg/kg ip) in single and chronic treatment modify those functions (Morris water maze). The study (in the same conditions) also analyses immobility time (Porsolt test) and motor activity of animals that received ARI and OLA. It has been shown that ARI and OLA as well as enriched environment reduce cognitive function disorders and modify cognitive functions in rats exposed to tobacco smoke.

La utilizacion de medicamentos para reducir la intensidad de los acufenos no esta bien apoyada por ensayos clinicos controlados, aleatorizados y prospectivos. Algunos farmacos son eficaces en algunos estudios, pero la evidencia es limitada. Se necesitan ensayos clinicos aleatorizados mas amplios.",

    "245": "Klebsiella oxytoca is an opportunistic pathogen implicated in various clinical diseases in animals and humans. Studies suggest that in humans K. oxytoca exerts its pathogenicity in part through a cytotoxin. However, cytotoxin production in animal isolates of K. oxytoca and its pathogenic properties have not been characterized. Furthermore, neither the identity of the toxin nor a complete repertoire of genes involved in K. oxytoca pathogenesis have been fully elucidated. Here, we showed that several animal isolates of K. oxytoca, including the clinical isolates, produced secreted products in bacterial culture supernatant that display cytotoxicity on HEp-2 and HeLa cells, indicating the ability to produce cytotoxin. Cytotoxin production appears to be regulated by the environment, and soy based product was found to have a strong toxin induction property. The toxin was identified, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy, as low molecular weight heat labile benzodiazepine, tilivalline, previously shown to cause cytotoxicity in several cell lines, including mouse L1210 leukemic cells. Genome sequencing and analyses of a cytotoxin positive K. oxytoca strain isolated from an abscess of a mouse, identified genes previously shown to promote pathogenesis in other enteric bacterial pathogens including ecotin, several genes encoding for type IV and type VI secretion systems, and proteins that show sequence similarity to known bacterial toxins including cholera toxin. To our knowledge, these results demonstrate for the first time, that animal isolates of K. oxytoca, produces a cytotoxin, and that cytotoxin production is under strict environmental regulation. We also confirmed tilivalline as the cytotoxin present in animal K. oxytoca strains. These findings, along with the discovery of a repertoire of genes with virulence potential, provide important insights into the pathogenesis of K. oxytoca. As a novel diagnostic tool, tilivalline may serve as a biomarker for K oxytoca-induced cytotoxicity in humans and animals through detection in various samples from food to diseased samples using LC-MS/MS. Induction of K. oxytoca cytotoxin by consumption of soy may be in part involved in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disease."
