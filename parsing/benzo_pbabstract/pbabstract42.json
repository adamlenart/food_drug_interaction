This leads to the best clinical outcome. There has been an emphasis on prompt treatment, but there exists a variety of poorly executed protocols. This review addresses the question of whether additional clinical trials are necessary, not only to answer for what purpose, but also, clearly, to examine the impact additional studies may have. Overall, the acute treatment of epilepsy emergencies in children has markedly improved with availability of out-of-hospital therapies, but additional studies to determine the most efficacious, maximally safe, and best tolerated treatments are needed.", 
    "1": "Several clinical trials have shown improved seizure control and outcome by early initiation of treatment with benzodiazepines, before arrival in the emergency department and before intravenous access can be established. Here, evidence is provided and reviewed for rapid treatment of acute seizures in order to avoid the development of benzodiazepine pharmacoresistance and the emergence of self-sustaining status epilepticus. Alterations in the physiology, pharmacology, and postsynaptic level of GABA-A receptors can develop within minutes to an hour and hinder the ability of synaptic inhibition to stop seizures while also impairing the efficacy of GABAergic agents, such as benzodiazepines, to boost impaired inhibition. In addition, heightened excitatory transmission further exacerbates the inhibitory/excitatory balance and makes seizure control even more resistant to treatment. The acute increase in the surface expression of NMDA receptors during prolonged seizures also may cause excitotoxic injury, cell death, and other pathological expressions and re-arrangements of receptor subunits that all contribute to long-term sequelae such as cognitive impairment and chronic epilepsy. In conclusion, a short window of opportunity exists when seizures are maximally controlled by first-line benzodiazepine treatment. After that, multiple pathological mechanisms quickly become engaged that make seizures increasingly more difficult to control with high risk for long-term harm.", 
    "2": "An historical overview is provided regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of acute prolonged convulsive seizures. It is clear that intravenous benzodiazepines remain a first step for the in-hospital treatment of prolonged seizures or status epilepticus. However, in the community, in a pre-hospital situation, intravenous administration is not possible. In recent years, it was shown that rectal, buccal, intranasal, and intramuscular administration of benzodiazepines is very effective as a first and safe treatment step. In many cases, rectal diazepam is not socially acceptable anymore, and therefore more emphasis is now put on buccal, intranasal, and intramuscular administration. At present, based on the available data, midazolam is the product of choice for the acute treatment of prolonged convulsive seizures.", 
    "3": "Aetiology is the main determinant of morbidity and mortality in convulsive status epilepticus (CSE) but longer seizure durations may also increase risk of worse outcome. Thirty minutes of seizure activity is usually the time period used in longstanding definitions of CSE but it is not acceptable to wait for 30 minutes before treatment. Whilst intravenous therapy is best, pre-hospital treatment by a non-intravenous route is most practical in treating children. Benzodiazepines are the main class of first-line emergency antiepileptic drugs. This review will examine the available data on benzodiazepines according to: stability in the conditions of the emergency room services, drug absorption via non-intravenous route, clinical efficacy and safety, and ease of delivery and social acceptability.",

    "9": "Three experiments examined the effect of systemic administration of the benzodiazepine midazolam on extinction and re-extinction of conditioned fear. Experiment 1 demonstrated that midazolam administration prior to extinction of a conditioned stimulus (CS) impaired that extinction when rats were subsequently tested drug free; however, extinction was spared if rats were extinguished, reconditioned, and re-extinguished under midazolam. Experiment 2 provided a replication of this effect within-subjects; rats were conditioned to two CSs (A and B), extinguished to one (A-), reconditioned to both, and then extinguished/re-extinguished to both stimuli in compound (AB-), under either vehicle or midazolam. On the drug-free test, rats given midazolam froze more to the CS that had been extinguished (B) than the one that been re-extinguished (A). The final experiment examined whether extinction under midazolam was regulated by prediction error. Rats were trained with three CSs (A, B, C) and extinguished to two (A-, C-). These stimuli then underwent additional extinction under midazolam or vehicle, with one CS now presented in compound with the non-extinguished CS (AB-, C-). Rats were then tested for fear of A relative to C. Rats given vehicle showed a deepening of extinction to A relative to C, as is predicted from error-correction models; however, rats given midazolam failed to show any such discrepancy in responding. The results are interpreted to indicate that the drug reduced prediction error during extinction by reducing fear, and rats were able to re-extinguish fear via a retrieval mechanism that is independent of prediction error.",

Reduction in cannabis use: adjunct psychological therapies (specifically about cannabis and psychosis) versus treatment as usualResults from one small study showed people receiving adjunct psychological therapies specifically about cannabis and psychosis were no more likely to reduce their intake than those receiving treatment as usual (n = 54, 1 RCT, MD -0.10, 95% CI -2.44 to 2.24, moderate quality evidence).

No data were reported for the other main outcomes of interest: global state, general functioning, adverse events, leaving the study early and satisfaction with treatment. 3. Reduction in cannabis use: antipsychotic versus antipsychotic In a small trial comparing effectiveness of olanzapine versus risperidone for cannabis reduction, there was no difference between groups at medium-term follow-up (n = 16, 1 RCT, RR 1.80 95% CI 0.52 to 6.22, moderate quality evidence). The number of participants leaving the study early at medium term was also similar (n = 28, 1 RCT, RR 0.50 95% CI 0.19 to 1.29, moderate quality evidence). Mental state data were reported, however they were reported within the short term and no difference was observed. No data were reported for global state, general functioning, and satisfaction with treatment.With regards to adverse effects data, no study reported medium-term data. Short-term data were presented but overall, no real differences between treatment groups were observed for adverse effects. 4.

In the acute setting of RSE, midazolam achieves clinical seizure control at a mean of 41 min after starting an infusion. When midazolam has failed to control RSE, the evidence points to barbiturate anesthesia as the next frequently used option. When both midazolam and barbiturates have failed, use of isoflurane or ketamine anesthesia has been tried at a mean of 10 days after RSE onset, although the studies are largely anecdotal. Increasingly, the use of therapeutic hypothermia or ketogenic diet is described as a strategy for super-refractory status epilepticus, and better evidence for their use may become available from ongoing randomized studies.",

The present study compared the characteristics of four anesthetic protocols in mice, focusing on the vital signs. Thirty-two male ddY mice were divided into four groups and administered anesthesia as follows: pentobarbital sodium monoanaesthesia; ketamine and xylazine combined (K/X); medetomidine, midazolam, and butorphanol combined (M/M/B); and isoflurane. In each group, rectal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation (SPO2) were measured, and the changes over time and instability in these signs were compared. The anesthetic depth was also evaluated in each mouse, and the percentage of mice achieving surgical anesthesia was calculated. K/X anesthesia caused remarkable bradycardia, while the respiratory rate and SPO2 were higher than with the others, suggesting a relatively strong cardiac influence and less respiratory depression. The M/M/B group showed a relatively lower heart rate and SPO2, but these abnormalities were rapidly reversed by atipamezole administration. The pentobarbital group showed a lower SPO2, and 62.5% of mice did not reach a surgical anesthetic depth. The isoflurane group showed a marked decrease in respiratory rate compared with the injectable anesthetic groups. However, it had the most stable SPO2 among the groups, suggesting a higher tidal volume. The isoflurane group also showed the highest heart rate during anesthesia. In conclusion, the present study showed the cardiorespiratory characteristics of various anesthetic protocols, providing basic information for selecting an appropriate anesthetic for individual animals during experimentation.",

Data associating medication use with driving impairment are growing, especially with agents not typically thought of as impairing. Forty-three states currently train drug recognition experts who employ a 12-step evaluation to detect the presence of drug impairment. Seventeen states have instituted \"per se\" laws, which make it illegal to drive with the presence of drugs or metabolites in the body. Pharmacists should recognize an ethical, professional, and perhaps legal responsibility to inform patients of the risk of impaired driving with prescription agents. Pharmacists should reconsider how they are counseling patients on medication impairment and lower their threshold for warning a patient of potential impairment, expanding to agents typically not thought of as impairing.

    "60": "Allopregnanolone and its equipotent stereoisomer, pregnanolone (together termed ALLO), are neuroactive steroids that positively and allosterically modulate the action of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) at GABAA receptors. Levels of ALLO are reduced in the cerebrospinal fluid of female premenopausal patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe, neuropsychiatric condition that affects millions, yet is without a consistently effective therapy. This suggests that restoring downregulated brain ALLO levels in PTSD may be beneficial. ALLO biosynthesis is also decreased in association with the emergence of PTSD-like behaviors in socially isolated (SI) mice. Similar to PTSD patients, SI mice also exhibit changes in the frontocortical and hippocampal expression of GABAA receptor subunits, resulting in resistance to benzodiazepine-mediated sedation and anxiolysis. ALLO acts at a larger spectrum of GABAA receptor subunits than benzodiazepines, and increasing corticolimbic ALLO levels in SI mice by injecting ALLO or stimulating ALLO biosynthesis with a selective brain steroidogenic stimulant, such as S-norfluoxetine, at doses far below those that block serotonin reuptake, reduces PTSD-like behavior in these mice. This suggests that synthetic analogs of ALLO, such as ganaxolone, may also improve anxiety, aggression, and other PTSD-like behaviors in the SI mouse model. Consistent with this hypothesis, ganaxolone (3.75-30 mg/kg, s.c.) injected 60 min before testing of SI mice, induced a dose-dependent reduction in aggression toward a same-sex intruder and anxiety-like behavior in an elevated plus maze. The EC50 dose of ganaxolone used in these tests also normalized exaggerated contextual fear conditioning and, remarkably, enhanced fear extinction retention in SI mice. At these doses, ganaxolone failed to change locomotion in an open field test. Therefore, unlike benzodiazepines, ganaxolone at non-sedating concentrations appears to improve dysfunctional emotional behavior associated with deficits in ALLO in mice and may provide an alternative treatment for PTSD patients with deficits in the synthesis of ALLO. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the only medications currently approved by the FDA for treatment of PTSD, although they are ineffective in a substantial proportion of PTSD patients. Hence, an ALLO analog such as ganaxolone may offer a therapeutic GABAergic alternative to SSRIs for the treatment of PTSD or other disorders in which ALLO biosynthesis may be impaired.",

    "71": "Hippocampus volumes have been shown to be decreased in patients with major depression, but volume measurements are inconsistent in patients with bipolar disorder. Both disorders are associated with deficits in hippocampus-mediated cognitive functions. However, the underlying pathophysiology is widely unknown. In this post-mortem study, we used design-based stereology on Nissl-stained serial sections to investigate the number of neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in substructures of the posterior hippocampus in eight patients with major depression, eight patients with bipolar disorder and ten control patients without a neuropsychiatric disorder. Compared to controls, patients with bipolar disorder had significantly more neurons in the cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) and the subiculum, while the number of oligodendrocytes was higher only in CA1. In patients with major depression, the density of oligodendrocytes was higher in CA2/3, CA4 and the subiculum. The dose of antidepressants correlated with the density and number\u00a0of oligodendrocytes in CA2/3, indicating that antidepressants may\u00a0affect our results. Treatment with neuroleptics expressed in chlorpromazine equivalents and benzodiazepines expressed in diazepam equivalents correlated negatively with the number of oligodendrocytes in CA2/3 and CA4, respectively, suggesting that treatment with these drugs do not influence cell number. We did not detect alterations in either volumes of substructures or numbers of astrocytes. Increased cell numbers argue for a denser packing of neurons and oligodendrocytes as a result of a decreased neuropils. This neuropathological process may be based on neurodevelopmental disturbances and may contribute to altered microconnectivity and cognitive deficits in affective disorders.", 
    "72": "Symptoms of alcohol withdrawal range in severity from mild \"hangover\" to fatal delirium tremens (DTs). Tremor, hallucinosis, and seizures usually occur within 48 hours of abstinence. Seizures tend to be generalized without focality, occurring singly or in a brief cluster, but status epilepticus is not unusual. DTs usually appears after 48 hours of abstinence and consists of marked inattentiveness, agitation, hallucinations, fluctuating level of alertness, marked tremulousness, and sympathetic overactivity. The mainstay of treatment for alcohol withdrawal is benzodiazepine pharmacotherapy, which can be used to control mild early symptoms, to prevent progression to DTs, or to treat DTs itself. Alternative less evidence-based pharmacotherapies include phenobarbital, anticonvulsants, baclofen, gamma-hydroxybutyric acid, beta-blockers, alpha-2-agonists, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor blockers. Treatment of DTs is a medical emergency requiring heavy sedation in an intensive care unit, with close attention to autonomic instability, fever, fluid loss, and electrolyte imbalance. Frequent comorbid disorders include hypoglycemia, liver failure, pancreatitis, sepsis, meningitis, intracranial hemorrhage, and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome.",

    "77": "Because mitochondrial oxidative stress and impairment are important mediators of neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases and in brain ischemia/reperfusion, in the present study, we evaluated the antioxidant and mitoprotective effect of a new promising neuroprotective molecule, JM-20, in mitochondria and synaptosomes isolated from rat brains. JM-20 inhibited succinate-mediated H\u2082O\u2082 generation in both mitochondria and synaptosomes incubated in depolarized (high K(+)) medium at extremely low micromolar concentration and with identical IC\u2085\u2080 values of 0.91 \u03bcM. JM-20 also repressed glucose-induced H\u2082O\u2082 generation stimulated by rotenone or by antimycin A in synaptosomes incubated in high sodium-polarized medium at extremely low IC\u2085\u2080 values of 0.395 \u03bcM and 2.452 \u03bcM, respectively. JM-20 was unable to react directly with H\u2082O\u2082 or with superoxide anion radicals but displayed a cathodic reduction peak at -0.71V, which is close to that of oxygen (-0.8V), indicating high electron affinity. JM-20 also inhibited uncoupled respiration in mitochondria or synaptosomes and was a more effective inhibitor in the presence of the respiratory substrates glutamate/malate than in the presence of succinate. JM-20 also prevented Ca(2+)-induced mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening, membrane potential dissipation and cytochrome c release, which are key pathogenic events during stroke. This molecule also prevented Ca(2+) influx into synaptosomes and mitochondria; the former effect was a consequence of the latter because JM-20 inhibition followed the patterns of carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenyl hydrazone (FCCP), which is a classic mitochondrial uncoupler. Because the mitochondrion is considered an important source and target of neuronal cell death signaling after an ischemic insult, the antioxidant and protective effects of JM-20 against the deleterious effects of Ca(2+) observed at the mitochondrial level in this study may endow this molecule with the ability to succeed in mitochondrion-targeted strategies to combat ischemic brain damage.",

Furthermore, because of evidence indicating that midazolam has equal potency at the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor and the 18-kd translocator protein (TSPO), it is possible that at least the nerve-blocking actions of midazolam are mediated by this alternative site of action.",

Premedication with opioids and anticholinergics was not a routine practice in the 20(th) century when intravenous anesthetics were primarily used as induction agents that significantly shorten the induction time. The current practice of anesthetic premedication has evolved into a generalized scheme that incorporates several aspects of patient care: decreasing preoperative anxiety, dampening intraoperative noxious stimulus and its associated neuroendocrinological changes, and minimizing postoperative adverse effects of anesthesia and surgery. Rational use of premedication in modern anesthesia practice should be justified by individual needs, the types of surgery, and the anesthetic agents and techniques used. In this article, we will provide our readers with updated information about premedication of surgical patients with a focus on the recent application of second generation serotonin type 3 antagonist, antidepressants, and anticonvulsants.",

    "106": "Ischemic stroke is caused by interruption or significant impairment of blood supply to the brain, which leads to a cascade of metabolic and molecular alterations resulting in functional disturbance and morphologic damage. The changes in regional cerebral blood flow and regional metabolism can be assessed by radionuclide imaging, especially SPECT and PET. SPECT and PET have broadened our understanding of flow and metabolic thresholds critical for maintenance of brain function and morphology: PET was essential in the transfer of the concept of the penumbra to clinical stroke and thereby had a great impact on developing treatment strategies. Receptor ligands can be applied as early markers of irreversible neuronal damage and can predict the size of the final infarcts, which is important for decisions on invasive therapy in large (\"malignant\") infarction. With SPECT and PET, the reserve capacity of the blood supply can be tested in obstructive arteriosclerosis, which is essential for planning interventions. The effect of a stroke on surrounding and contralateral primarily unaffected tissue can be investigated, helping to understand symptoms caused by disturbance in functional networks. Activation studies are useful to demonstrate alternative pathways to compensate for lesions and to test the effect of rehabilitative therapy. Radioisotope studies help to detect neuroinflammation and its effect on extension of tissue damage. Despite the limitations of broad clinical application of radionuclide imaging, this technology has a great impact on research in cerebrovascular diseases and still has various applications in the management of stroke.",

The absorbance spectra of protein, drugs and protein-drug showed complex formation between the drugs and HSA. Fluorescence analysis demonstrated that ALP and FLX could quench the fluorescence spectrum of HSA and demonstrated the conformational change of HSA in the presence of both drugs. Also, fluorescence quenching mechanism of HSA-drug complexes both separately and simultaneously was suggested as static quenching. The analysis of UV absorption data and the fluorescence quenching of HSA in the binary and ternary systems showed that FLX decreased the binding affinity between ALP and HSA. On the contrary, ALP increased the binding affinity of FLX and HSA. The results of synchronous fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra indicated that the binding of drugs to HSA would modify the microenvironment around the Trp and Tyr residues and the conformation of HSA. The distances between Trp residue and the binding sites of the drugs were estimated according to the F\u00f6rster theory, and it was demonstrated that non-radiative energy transfer from HSA to the drugs occurred with a high probability. Moreover, according to CV measurements, the decrease of peak current in the cyclic voltammogram of the both drugs in the presence of HSA revealed that they interacted with albumin and binding constants were calculated for binary systems which were in agreement with the binding constants obtained from UV absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy. The prediction of the best binding sites of ALP and FLX in binary and ternary systems in molecular modeling approach was done using of Gibbs free energy.", 
    "108": "The abuse of prescription drugs has led to a significant increase in emergency department (ED) visits and drug-related deaths over the past decade. Opioid pain relievers (OPRs) and benzodiazepines are the prescription drugs most commonly involved in these events. Excessive alcohol consumption also accounts for a significant health burden and is common among groups that report high rates of prescription drug abuse. When taken with OPRs or benzodiazepines, alcohol increases central nervous system depression and the risk for overdose. Data describing alcohol involvement in OPR or benzodiazepine abuse are limited. To quantify alcohol involvement in OPR and benzodiazepine abuse and drug-related deaths and to inform prevention efforts, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC analyzed 2010 data for drug abuse-related ED visits in the United States and drug-related deaths that involved OPRs and alcohol or benzodiazepines and alcohol in 13 states. The analyses showed alcohol was involved in 18.5% of OPR and 27.2% of benzodiazepine drug abuse-related ED visits and 22.1% of OPR and 21.4% of benzodiazepine drug-related deaths. These findings indicate that alcohol plays a significant role in OPR and benzodiazepine abuse. Interventions to reduce the abuse of alcohol and these drugs alone and in combination are needed.", 
    "109": "Febrile seizures occur in \u223c4% of children. After a first febrile seizure, the risk of recurrence is \u223c40%, but excellent studies document that febrile seizures do not cause brain damage or deficits in cognition or behaviour. The risk of subsequent epilepsy is 2-4%. Prolonged febrile seizures are of concern because a child may later develop mesial temporal sclerosis and intractable epilepsy in rare cases. Most prolonged febrile seizures represent the first febrile seizure and cannot be anticipated. A first prolonged febrile seizure does not increase the risk of recurrence, but if there is a recurrence, it is more likely to be prolonged. Prevention of recurrent febrile seizures is difficult. Antipyretics are ineffective. Daily AED treatment is not often justified. Intermittent oral diazepam at the time of illness is not very successful and has significant side effects. The most optimistic study found that the number of subjects required to treat in order to prevent one recurrence was 14. Intermittent clobazam has fewer side effects than diazepam and may be somewhat effective. Rescue benzodiazepines given outside health care facilities may be effective in selected patients to prevent prolonged recurrences, although this has not been proven with rectal diazepam which has been more extensively studied than buccal or nasal midazolam. Currently, we suggest that, for children with febrile seizures, candidates for consideration for rescue benzodiazepines are those with a prolonged febrile seizure or poor access to medical care. It is possible that the use of a rescue benzodiazepine may alleviate severe parental anxiety, but this remains to be established.",

    "114": "The aim of this study was to identify compounds that possess anticonvulsant activity by using a pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure model. Theoretical studies of a set of ligands, explored the binding affinities of the ligands for the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R), including some benzodiazepines. The ligands satisfy the Lipinski rules and contain a pharmacophore core that has been previously reported to be a GABA(A)R activator. To select the ligands with the best physicochemical properties, all of the compounds were analyzed by quantum mechanics and the energies of the highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital were determined. Docking calculations between the ligands and the GABA(A)R were used to identify the complexes with the highest Gibbs binding energies. The identified compound D1 (dibenzo(b,f)(1,4)diazocine-6,11(5H,12H)-dione) was synthesized, experimentally tested, and the GABA(A)R-D1 complex was submitted to 12-ns-long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to corroborate the binding conformation obtained by docking techniques. MD simulations were also used to analyze the decomposition of the Gibbs binding energy of the residues involved in the stabilization of the complex. To validate our theoretical results, molecular docking and MD simulations were also performed for three reference compounds that are currently in commercial use: clonazepam (CLZ), zolpidem and eszopiclone. The theoretical results show that the GABA(A)R-D1, and GABA(A)R-CLZ complexes bind to the benzodiazepine binding site, share a similar map of binding residues, and have similar Gibbs binding energies and entropic components. Experimental studies using a PTZ-induced seizure model showed that D1 possesses similar activity to CLZ, which corroborates the predicted binding free energy identified by theoretical calculations.",

Sample preparation was performed by one-step protein precipitation with methanol. The analytes were chromatographed on a reversed-phase YMC-ODS-AQ C18 Column (2.0 \u00d7 100 mm,3 \u00b5m) by a gradient program at a flow rate of 0.30 mL/min. Quantification was performed on a triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer via electrospray ionization in positive ion mode. The method was validated for selectivity, linearity, accuracy, precision, matrix effect, recovery and stability. The calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 0.2-120 ng/mL for OLZ and 0.5-50 ng/mL for DMO. Intra- and interday precisions for OLZ and DMO were <11.29%, and the accuracy ranged from 95.23 to 113.16%. The developed method was subsequently applied to therapeutic drug monitoring for psychiatric patients receiving therapy of OLZ tablets. The method seems to be suitable for therapeutic drug monitoring of patients undergoing therapy with OLZ and might contribute to prediction of the risk of adverse reactions.", 
    "116": "Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding the transcriptional modulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) impair postnatal development of the brain. Here we use neuronal-type specific gene deletion in mice to show that conditional Mecp2 deletion in GABAergic parvalbumin-expressing (PV) cells (PV-Mecp2(-/y)) does not cause most Rett-syndrome-like behaviours, but completely abolishes experience-dependent critical period plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1) that develops normal visual functions. However, selective loss of Mecp2 in GABAergic somatostatin-expressing cells or glutamatergic pyramidal cells does not affect the critical period plasticity. MeCP2-deficient PV cells exhibit high intrinsic excitability, selectively reduced efficacy of recurrent excitatory synapses in V1 layer 4 circuits, and decreased evoked visual responses in vivo. Enhancing cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition with diazepam infusion can restore critical period plasticity in both young and adult PV-Mecp2(-/y) mice. Thus, MeCP2 expression in inhibitory PV cells during the critical period is essential for local circuit functions underlying experience-dependent cortical plasticity.",

Propofol, a widely used systemic anesthetic, has lately been reported to excite noradrenaline (NA)-inhibited type of VLPO neurons. Present study tested if acetylcholine system takes part in the propofol modulation of GABAergic spontaneous miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in mechanically dissociated rat VLPO neurons using a conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique. Propofol reversibly decreased mIPSC frequency without affecting the current amplitude, indicating that propofol acts presynaptically to decrease the probability of spontaneous GABA release. The propofol action on GABAergic mIPSC frequency was completely blocked by atropine, a nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine (mACh) receptor antagonist, and pirenzepine, a selective M1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that propofol acts on M1 receptors on GABAergic nerve terminals projecting to VLPO neurons to inhibit spontaneous GABA release. The M1 receptor-mediated modulation of GABAergic transmission onto VLPO neurons may contribute to the regulation of loss of consciousness induced by propofol.",

Guidance to schools is unclear as to whether teachers are allowed to administer rescue medication to children and legal frameworks are full of contradictions. As a result, whether or not children who experience prolonged seizures receive their rescue medication during school hours depends mostly on the resources and training available in each school. Healthcare professionals stated that lack of information on prolonged seizures and their management, as well as a lack of up-to-date guidance specific to schools were considerable obstacles to a systematic approach to managing prolonged seizures outside of the hospital.",

However, the issues that arise for children who require rescue medication for prolonged seizures outside of hospitals are conspicuously absent from policy documents or clinical guidelines. This lack of information, combined with insufficient training in schools on epilepsy, and inadequate guidelines create a situation in which schools are likely to call an ambulance every time a child has a prolonged seizure, therefore risking delays in treatment, and putting the child at risk of status epilepticus and clinical sequelae, not to mention stigmatization at school.",

In CYP3A5 non-expressers, the presence of one CYP3A4*22T-allele was associated with a 31.7-33.6% reduction in MDZ apparent oral clearance, reflecting reduced in vivo CYP3A4 activity. In addition, at \u2a7e12 months after transplantation, steady-state clearance of tacrolimus was 36.8% decreased compared with homozygous CYP3A4*22CC-wild type patients, leading to 50% lower dose requirements.

To quantify changes of CYP3A4 activity, midazolam (3 mg po) as a probe drug was used. Ambrisentan pharmacokinetics was assessed on days 1, 10 and 20, and midazolam pharmacokinetics before and on days 1, 10, 17 and 20. At steady state, ambrisentan exposure was similar in extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers but 43% larger in poor metabolizers (p < 0.01). In all volunteers, SJW reduced ambrisentan exposure and the relative change (17-26%) was similar in all genotype groups. The extent of this interaction did not correlate with the changes in CYP3A activity (midazolam clearance) (rs = 0.23, p = 0.34). Ambrisentan had no effect on midazolam pharmacokinetics. In conclusion, SJW significantly reduced exposure with ambrisentan irrespective of the CYP2C19 genotype. The extent of this interaction was small and thus likely without clinical relevance.",

The patient was suddenly unable to comprehend spoken words, whereas he had no difficulty in speaking, comprehending written language, or discriminating non-verbal sounds. Diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery on brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperintense lesions in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG) and left superior marginal gyrus (SMG). Furthermore, brain single-photon emission computed tomography showed that these lesions were hyperperfused. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed multiple spike-and-slow-wave complexes spreading to the left temporal regions. Immediately after administering midazolam intravenously, the patient was able to comprehend spoken words, and the epileptiform discharges in the left temporal regions disappeared. These findings indicate that he suffered from PWD resulting from a dysfunction of the left hemisphere alone. Furthermore, they suggest that the left STG and left SMG play an important role in the recognition of spoken words.",

Subsequently, tail-flick measures were recorded over a 90-min period, at 5-min intervals. 10 Hz TENS increased the nociceptive threshold during the 90-min period. This antinociceptive effect was reversed by naloxone pre-treatment, was not altered by diazepam pre-treatment and was abolished by cannabidiol pre-treatment (1.5mg/kg). Moreover, 150 Hz TENS increased tail-flick latencies by 35 min post-treatment, which was partially inhibited by naloxone pre-treatment and totally inhibited by cannabidiol (1.5mg/kg).

This can make therapeutic support challenging for the practitioner, with results that are partial and unsatisfactory. In the literature, treatment with high-dose olanzapine (>20mg/day) appears to be a good alternative to clozapine, the gold standard for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. In the present observational prospective study, we studied the clinical and biological profiles of patients treated with olanzapine doses up to 100mg/day. In total, 50 patients were clinically and biologically assessed. We found a linear relationship between oral dose and serum concentration (Pearson's r=0.83, p<0.001) with effects of tobacco (p<0.05) and of coffee and tea consumption (p<0.01). Tolerance seemed to be good regardless of dose. No link was found between concentration and efficiency. Despite a nonexhaustive assessment of pharmacokinetic parameters, not least pharmacogenetic data (e.g., genotyping of cytochrome P450-1A2 or glycoprotein P Abcb1a), pharmacokinetic aspects alone cannot account for why the disease may sometimes be resistant to 20mg of olanzapine but respond to higher doses. A nuclear imaging study exploring brain occupancy by high-dose olanzapine, coupled with the abovementioned pharmacokinetic assessment, may prove a relevant experimental paradigm for studying the pathophysiological mechanisms of resistant schizophrenia.", 
    "192": "Dyspnea, 'hunger for air', and the urge to flee are the cardinal symptoms of respiratory-type panic attacks. Patients also show baseline respiratory abnormalities and a higher rate of comorbid and antecedent respiratory diseases. Panic attacks are also precipitated by both the infusion of 0.5 M sodium lactate and the inhalation of 5-7% carbon dioxide (CO2) in predisposed patients, but not in healthy volunteers nor patients without panic disorder. Further studies show that patients with panic are also hyper-responsive to hypoxia. These and other observations led Klein (1993) to suggest that clinical panic is the misfiring of a suffocation alarm system. In rats, cytotoxic hypoxia of chemoreceptor cells by intravenous injection of potassium cyanide (KCN) produces short-lasting flight behaviors reminiscent of panic attacks. KCN-induced flight behaviors are blocked both by denervation of chemoreceptor cells and lesion of dorsal periaqueductal gray matter, a likely substrate of panic. Herein, we show that KCN-evoked flight behaviors are also attenuated by both acute and chronic treatment with clonazepam (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and fluoxetine (1-4 mg/kg/day, i.p. for 21 days), respectively.

Methoxetamine acts principally on the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and the serotonin receptor. It is sold as a white or off-white powder. Marketed as a \"bladder friendly\" alternative to ketamine, preliminary research suggests renal and cystic toxicity similar to ketamine. Methoxetamine is primarily ingested nasally, though also orally, intramuscularly, intravenously, and rectally.

The 13 cases of acute methoxetamine toxicity described in the literature are summarized. The toxidrome consists of dissociation/delirium, sympathetic activation, and cerebellar symptoms. Methoxetamine is not detected in standard urine drug tests and there are no reliable laboratory findings. Management of acute methoxetamine toxicity is supportive, consisting of benzodiazepines, antiemetics, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support as indicated.

    "205": "Regional depolarization of the mitochondrial network can alter cellular electrical excitability and increase the propensity for reentry, in part, through the opening of sarcolemmal KATP channels. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) instability or oscillation can be induced in myocytes by exposure to reactive oxygen species (ROS), laser excitation, or glutathione depletion, and is thought to be a major factor in arrhythmogenesis during ischemia-reperfusion. Nevertheless, the correlation between \u0394\u03a8m recovery kinetics and reperfusion-induced arrhythmias has been difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Here, we investigate the relationship between subcellular changes in \u0394\u03a8m, cellular glutathione redox potential, electrical excitability, and wave propagation during coverslip-induced ischemia-reperfusion (IR) in neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers. Ischemia led to decreased action potential amplitude and duration followed by electrical inexcitability after ~15min of ischemia. \u0394\u03a8m depolarization occurred in two phases during ischemia: in phase 1 (<30min ischemia), mitochondrial clusters within individual NRVMs depolarized, while phase 2 \u0394\u03a8m depolarization (30-60min) was characterized by global functional collapse of the mitochondrial network across the whole ischemic region of the monolayer, typically involving a propagating metabolic wave. Oxidation of the glutathione (GSSG:GSH) redox potential occurred during ischemia, followed by recovery upon reperfusion (i.e., lifting the coverslip). \u0394\u03a8m recovered in the mitochondria of individual myocytes quite rapidly upon reperfusion (<5min), but was highly unstable, characterized by subcellular oscillations or flickering of clusters of mitochondria in NRVMs across the reperfused region. Electrical excitability also recovered in a heterogeneous manner, providing an arrhythmogenic substrate which led to formation of sustained reentry. Treatment with 4'-chlorodiazepam, a peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, prevented \u0394\u03a8m oscillation, improved GSH recovery rate, and prevented reentry during reperfusion, indicating that stabilization of mitochondrial network dynamics is important for preventing post-ischemic arrhythmias.

In this review, the clinical laboratory studies that tested the effects of MDMA on body temperature are summarized. The mechanisms that underlie the hyperthermic effects of MDMA in humans and treatment of severe hyperthermia are presented. The data show that MDMA produces an acute and dose-dependent rise in core body temperature in healthy subjects. The increase in body temperature is in the range of 0.2-0.8\u00b0C and does not result in hyperpyrexia (>40\u00b0C) in a controlled laboratory setting. However, moderately hyperthermic body temperatures >38.0\u00b0C occur frequently at higher doses, even in the absence of physical activity and at room temperature. MDMA primarily releases serotonin and norepinephrine. Mechanistic clinical studies indicate that the MDMA-induced elevations in body temperature in humans partially depend on the MDMA-induced release of norepinephrine and involve enhanced metabolic heat generation and cutaneous vasoconstriction, resulting in impaired heat dissipation. The mediating role of serotonin is unclear. The management of sympathomimetic toxicity and associated hyperthermia mainly includes sedation with benzodiazepines and intravenous fluid replacement.

    "227": "Two hundred and seventy five (23.3%) of the 1178 patients fulfilled criteria for EOD. In multiple logistic regression analyses, compared to LOD patients their EOD counterparts were more likely to be unmarried and unemployed, had more atypical and psychotic depressive episodes, had bipolar features, while they had more lifetime depressive episodes.", 
    "228": "The demographic and more severe clinical features of EOD in Chinese patients were basically consistent with those found in Western populations. The association between socio-cultural factors and development of EOD warrants further studies.", 
    "229": "Weight gain and its related metabolic disorders are major side effects associated with second generation antipsychotic drug treatment. The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) are implicated in the regulation of food intake and body weight. Blocking the histamine H1 receptor contributes to antipsychotic-induced weight gain. The present study investigated the time-dependent effect of olanzapine treatment (8, 16, and 36 d) on DVC AMPK signaling in olanzapine-induced weight gain and whether these changes are associated with olanzapine-induced H1 receptor antagonism. During the 8-day olanzapine treatment, the rats were hyperphagic and rapidly gained weight. The phosphorylation of AMPK (pAMPK) (activated AMPK) as well as its directly downstream phospho-acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase was significantly increased. The pAMPK/AMPK ratio, an indicator of AMPK activity, was significantly positively correlated with feeding efficiency and weight gain. As treatment was prolonged (16 and 36 d of olanzapine treatment), the rats were no longer hyperphagic, and there were no longer any changes in DVC AMPK signaling. Although the DVC H1 receptor protein expression was not significantly altered by olanzapine, the pAMPK expression was significantly positively correlated with the H1 receptor level after the 8-, 16-, and 36-day olanzapine treatments. Moreover, we showed that an H1 receptor agonist, 2-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl) histamine, significantly inhibited the olanzapine-induced hyperphagia and DVC AMPK activation in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest a time-dependent role of DVC AMPK in olanzapine-induced obesity. Thus, olanzapine-induced DVC AMPK activation may be at least partially related to olanzapine's antagonistic effect on the H1 receptor.", 
    "230": "Seizures are a common presentation to pre-hospital emergency services and they generate significant healthcare costs. This article summarises the United Kingdom (UK) Ambulance Service guidelines for the management of seizures and explores the extent to which these guidelines are evidence-based.", 
    "231": "Summary of the Clinical Practice Guidelines of the UK Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee relating to the management of seizures. Review of the literature relating to pre-hospital management of seizure emergencies.", 
    "232": "Much standard practice relating to the emergency out of hospital management of patients with seizures is drawn from generic Advanced Life Support (ALS) guidelines although many patients do not need ALS during or after a seizure and the benefit of many ALS interventions in seizure patients remains to be established. The majority of studies identified pertain to medical treatment of status epilepticus. These papers show that benzodiazepines are safe and effective but it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions about the best medication or the optimal route of administration.", 
    "233": "The evidence base for current pre-hospital guidelines for seizure emergencies is incomplete. A large proportion of patients are transported to hospital after a seizure but many of these may be suitable for home management. However, there is very little research into alternative care pathways or criteria that could be used to help paramedics avoid transport to hospital. More research is needed to improve care for people after a seizure and to improve the cost-effectiveness of the healthcare systems within which they are treated.", 
    "234": "Pulmonary depression remains a major concern when performing upper endoscopy in the morbidly obese patient. The aim of this prospective study is to determine the effects of sedation and role of capnography during preoperative upper endoscopy in obese patients.", 
    "235": "Eighty-two consecutive diagnostic upper gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed in morbidly obese patients in an outpatient setting. Data on amount of drug administration and cardiorespiratory change were recorded.", 
    "236": "Mean body mass index and duration of procedure was 46.4\u00b18.2 kg/m2 and 9.4\u00b12.5 minutes, respectively. The mean dose of propofol was 139.5\u00b145.1 mg. No clinically significant cardiorespiratory complications occurred. Respiratory depression (RD) was seen in 33/82 (40.2%) patients and included a mean absolute change in end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) of 7.1\u00b18.5 mm Hg from baseline (P=.001). 54/82 (65.9%) patients had subclinical RD with 27/54 (50%) having RD. Abnormal EtCO2 detected all episodes of RD. The sensitivity and negative predictive value in determining RD by a change in EtCO2>10 mm Hg or an absent EtCO2 waveform during any point of the procedure was 81% and 78%, respectively. The relative risk was 2.3.", 
    "237": "Capnography provided a real time assessment of changes in ventilation and can detect early phases of respiratory depression. Utilization of propofol as a means for sedation, with extended advanced monitoring technique, can allow for reduced adverse outcomes in morbidly obese patients undergoing upper endoscopy.", 
    "238": "Olanzapine is widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and it is becoming more frequently responsible for overdoses. Standard pharmacokinetic models do not fit to the toxic concentration data.", 
    "239": "The aim of present study is to investigate the reasons for an abnormal olanzapine plasma concentration time curve in the range of toxic concentrations. Two hypotheses were verified: entering the enterohepatic cycle, and drug deposition and its desorption from activated charcoal used for gastrointestinal decontamination.", 
    "240": "One-hundred thirty-five plasma concentration data from 21 patients hospitalized for acute olanzapine poisoning were analyzed with the use of the population pharmacokinetic approach. A non-linear mixed-effects modeling approach with Monolix 4.3.1 was employed.", 
    "241": "A model assuming gallbladder emptying at irregular intervals was developed. Also, a model that describes desorption of olanzapine from the charcoal surface, in which the dose is divided into two absorbed fractions, was constructed. The analysis has found gastrointestinal decontamination and previous olanzapine treatment, as the significant covariates for toxicokinetic parameters of olanzapine.", 
    "242": "Our study provides interesting models for investigation of toxic concentration of olanzapine, which may also be used as the basis for further model development for other drugs as well. The investigated population was not large enough to reliably confirm any of the proposed models. It would be well worth continuing this study with more substantial data. Also, any additional information about olanzapine metabolite concentration could be vital.", 
    "243": "The Chicago Classification divides esophageal motor disorders based on the recorded value of the integrated relaxation pressure (IRP). The first group includes those with an elevated mean IRP that is associated with peristaltic abnormalities such as achalasia and esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction. The second group includes those with a normal mean IRP that is associated with esophageal hypermotility disorders such as distal esophageal spasm, hypercontractile esophagus (jackhammer esophagus), and hypertensive peristalsis (nutcracker esophagus). The third group includes those with a normal mean IRP that is associated with esophageal hypomotility peristaltic abnormalities such as absent peristalsis, weak peristalsis with small or large breaks, and frequent failed peristalsis. The therapeutic options vary greatly between the different groups of esophageal motor disorders. In achalasia patients, potential treatment strategies comprise medical therapy (calcium channel blockers, nitrates, and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors), endoscopic procedures (botulinum toxin A injection, pneumatic dilation, or peroral endoscopic myotomy) or surgery (Heller myotomy). Patients with a normal IRP and esophageal hypermotility disorder are candidates for medical therapy (nitrates, calcium channel blockers, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, cimetropium/ipratropium bromide, proton pump inhibitors, benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, trazodone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors), endoscopic procedures (botulinum toxin A injection and peroral endoscopic myotomy), or surgery (Heller myotomy). Lastly, in patients with a normal IRP and esophageal hypomotility disorder, treatment is primarily focused on controlling the presence of gastroesophageal reflux with proton pump inhibitors and lifestyle modifications (soft and liquid diet and eating in the upright position) to address patient's dysphagia.", 
    "244": "Neurologic deterioration occurring days to weeks after a cerebral hypoxic event accompanied by diffuse white matter demyelination is called delayed posthypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL). Manifestations of DPHL are diverse and include dementia, gait disturbance, incontinence, pyramidal tract signs, parkinsonism, chorea, mood and thought disorders, akinetic mutism, and rarely catatonia.", 
    "245": "We report a case of malignant catatonia in a patient diagnosed with DPHL that was refractory to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and review the literature on catatonia in DPHL.", 
    "246": "The patient was a 56-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who was admitted with catatonia 2 weeks after hospitalization for drug overdose and respiratory failure. Her catatonic symptoms did not respond to treatment of lorazepam, amantadine, methylphenidate, or 10 sessions of bilateral ECT at maximum energy. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive periventricular white matter lesions not present on admission scans, and she was diagnosed with DPHL.", 
    "247": "No treatment for DPHL has been proven to be widely effective. Hyperbaric oxygen treatments may reduce the rate of development, and symptom improvement has been reported with stimulants and other psychotropic agents. Review of literature reveals rare success with GABAergic agents for catatonia after cerebral hypoxia and no cases successfully treated with ECT. There are 7 case reports of neurologic decompensation during ECT treatment after a cerebral hypoxic event.", 
    "248": "Caution is advised when considering ECT for catatonia when delayed sequelae of cerebral hypoxia are on the differential diagnosis, as there is a dearth of evidence to support this treatment approach."
