    "0": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a frequent neurologic emergency, one third of patients do not respond to treatment with benzodiazepines followed by a second antiepileptic drug. While initial treatment of complex partial SE is accordant to that of generalized convulsive SE, further management of refractory SE depends on the risk for acute complications and long-term clinical consequences. These risks are low in complex partial SE; therefore, in this clinical form anesthetics commonly are not used. Generalized convulsive SE-even in its early course-is a potentially life-threatening condition; therefore, prompt use of anesthetics is urgently required. Drugs of choice are barbiturates, midazolam, and propofol, all of which exhibit specific advantages and disadvantages. Up to now, data from clinical studies do not allow to prefer or to discard one of these anesthetics, therefore also barbiturates still should be used in refractory SE. A widely accepted in-house protocol for the management of initial and refractory SE is highly recommended.", 
    "1": "Status epilepticus (SE) is one of the most frequent neurologic emergencies, and a rapid and effective treatment is warranted. Current guidelines recommend a stepwise approach using a sequence of different antiepileptic drugs with benzodiazepines (BZD) being the first treatment proposed. To provide the more effective treatment as soon as possible, some authors have suggested using a combined polytherapy as first-line treatment. Strong evidence supports the use of benzodiazepines, mostly lorazepam and midazolam as initial monotherapy treatment for SE. Insufficient data are available to support the use of nonsedating antiepileptic drugs as phenytoin, valproic acid, or levetiracetam without a previous benzodiazepine administration. Studies assessing the role of a combined initial therapy are rare, if not missing. Moreover, owing the wide range of SE etiologies, a \"one fits all\" initial polytherapy seems difficult to achieve. After reviewing the available evidence, guidelines, and current practices regarding monotherapy and polytherapy as first-line treatment in SE in adults, the authors propose a rational algorithm for early antiseizure treatment in SE.", 
    "2": "Status epilepticus represents an acute, potentially life-threatening emergency with considerable risks of morbidity and mortality, mainly depending on age at onset, underlying etiology, seizure severity, and medical comorbidities. Recent European and North American guidelines on management and treatment of status epilepticus strongly recommend prompt treatment to prevent further complications. At present, following a staged treatment protocol is recommended. Benzodiazepines are the treatment of choice in early status epilepticus, but there are no class I data supporting treatment recommendations on the choice of antiepileptic drugs for established and refractory status epilepticus. This article reviews advantages and potential drawbacks of the available guidelines.",

    "8": "A new monolithic coating based on vinylpyrrolidone-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate polymer was introduced for stir bar sorptive extraction. The polymerization step was performed using different contents of monomer, cross-linker and porogenic solvent, and the best formulation was selected. The quality of the prepared vinylpyrrolidone-ethylene glycol dimethacrylate stir bars was satisfactory, demonstrating good repeatability within batch (relative standard deviation < 3.5%) and acceptable reproducibility between batches (relative standard deviation < 6.0%). The prepared stir bar was utilized in combination with ultrasound-assisted liquid desorption, followed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection for the simultaneous determination of diazepam and nordazepam in human plasma samples. To optimize the extraction step, a three-level, four-factor, three-block Box-Behnken design was applied. Under the optimum conditions, the analytical performance of the proposed method displayed excellent linear dynamic ranges for diazepam (36-1200 ng/mL) and nordazepam (25-1200 ng/mL), with correlation coefficients of 0.9986 and 0.9968 and detection limits of 12 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. The intra- and interday recovery ranged from 93 to 106%, and the relative standard deviations were less than 6%. Finally, the proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of diazepam and nordazepam at their therapeutic levels in human plasma. The novelty of this study is the improved polarity of the stir bar coating and its application for the simultaneous extraction of diazepam and its active metabolite, nordazepam in human plasma sample. The method was more rapid than previously reported stir bar sorptive extraction techniques based on monolithic coatings, and exhibited lower detection limits in comparison with similar methods for the determination of diazepam and nordazepam in biological fluids.", 
    "9": "Olanzapine's efficacy in schizophrenia is attributed to antagonism of dopamine and serotonin receptors. Olanzapine is also a potent histamine-H1 antagonist that results in weight gain and somnolence. Betahistine is a centrally acting histamine-H1 agonist, and therefore may reduce olanzapine's effect on histamine receptors in the brain. Olanzapine's high affinity for the histamine-H1 receptor warrants the use of high doses of betahistine. Forty-eight healthy women were recruited and randomized to receive either betahistine 144 mg/day or matching placebo for 4 weeks. Due to the high dose of betahistine, olanzapine was started only on the second week and titrated up to 10 mg/day, and co-administration continued for an additional 2 weeks. Only nominal differences in adverse events were noted between the treatment groups. Betahistine caused a 37% reduction in mean weight gain (1.24 kg in the betahistine arm vs. 1.93 kg in the placebo arm; p=.049) and 60% reduction in the mean increase in daytime Epworth sleepiness scores (1.82 units in the betahistine group vs. 3.57 units in the placebo group; p=.042). The present study suggests that betahistine-olanzapine co-administration, in healthy female subjects, yields an acceptable safety profile with mitigation of weight gain and somnolence. This should be further tested in a patient cohort.", 
    "10": "Nausea and vomiting are among the most common and distressing symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. Olanzapine, an antipsychotic agent, is known to have an affinity for multiple neurotransmitter receptors. Previous studies have reported olanzapine to be efficacious in the treatment of nausea and vomiting. Although it has been administered at a number of facilities, its applicability to treat nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer is poorly understood. We investigated the use of olanzapine for nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer at multiple centers. This retrospective study was carried out at seven palliative care units and three facilities with palliative care teams in Japan from 2013 to 2015. The dosage of olanzapine, treatment duration, and duration from initial use until death were collected from the medical records. One hundred and eight patients met our inclusion criteria. The average dose of olanzapine was 3.6\u00a0mg (2.5\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u200961; 5\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u200946; 10\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20091) and average treatment duration was 18.7\u00a0days. The average duration from initial use until death was 39.0\u00a0days. There were no differences in the duration of administration until death between olanzapine doses (2.5 and 5\u00a0mg). Our results suggest that olanzapine have been used in patients with poor prognoses for nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer. Conducting a prospective trial would further yield promising results.",

Randomized controlled head-to-head trials of available drugs either do not exist or are inconclusive. We aimed to compare rates of monotherapy treatment failure in individuals prescribed lithium, valproate, olanzapine or quetiapine by a population-based cohort study using electronic health records. 5,089 patients with bipolar disorder were prescribed lithium (N=1,505), valproate (N=1,173) olanzapine (N=1,366) or quetiapine (N=1,075) as monotherapy. Treatment failure was defined as time to stopping medication or add-on of another mood stabilizer, antipsychotic, antidepressant or benzodiazepine. In unadjusted analyses, the duration of successful monotherapy was longest in individuals treated with lithium. Treatment failure had occurred in 75% of those prescribed lithium by 2.05 years (95% CI: 1.63-2.51), compared to 0.76 years (95% CI: 0.64-0.84) for those prescribed quetiapine, 0.98 years (95% CI: 0.84-1.18) for those prescribed valproate, and 1.13 years for those prescribed olanzapine (95% CI: 1.00-1.31). Lithium's superiority remained in a propensity score matched analysis; when treatment failure was defined as stopping medication or add-on of a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic; and when treatment failure was restricted to more than three months after commencing the study drug. Lithium appears to be more successful as monotherapy maintenance treatment than valproate, olanzapine or quetiapine. Lithium is often avoided because of its side effect profile, but alternative treatments may reduce the time to being prescribed more than one drug, with potential additive side effects of these treatments.",

The reaction runs with considerable fine powder formation were selected for further binding and selectivity studies. The MINP with the best selectivity (MINP-32) was chosen for further structural characterization by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), adsorption-desorption isotherm for specific surface area, volume and average pore diameter determination. All characterization methods confirmed the successful formation of MINP. The optimum conditions for maximum template loading on the MINP-32 were found by experimental design using response surface methodology (RSM) and choosing absorbent amount, pH, and time as the main factors. MINPs with maximum template loading also indicated significant selectivity between template and its analog (clozapine). The release profile demonstrated a maximum release of about 95% after 288\u00a0h for MINP-32 in comparison with about 94% after 120\u00a0h for non-MINP-32. The same slow release of drug from MINP-32 was also observed during animal study of the plasma level of template, 20-28\u00a0\u03bcg/ml versus 5-10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The MINP-32 of this study represents a desirable ability to keep the memory of the template with significant selectivity and good capability to control the release of template in vitro and in vivo and hence could be a promising drug delivery system.", 
    "45": "Many aspects of long-term pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders (AnxDs) are still debated. We undertook an updated systematic review of long-term pharmacological studies on panic disorder (PD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Relevant studies dating from January 1, 2012 to August 31, 2015 were identified using the PubMed database and a review of bibliographies. Of 372 records identified in the search, five studies on PD and 15 on GAD were included in the review. No studies on SAD were found. Our review confirms the usefulness of long-term pharmacological treatments for PD and GAD and suggests that they can provide further improvement over that obtained during short-term therapy. Paroxetine, escitalopram, and clonazepam can be effective for long-term treatment of PD. However, further studies are needed to draw conclusions about the long-term benzodiazepine use in PD, particularly for the possible cognitive side-effects over time. Pregabalin and quetiapine can be effective for long-term treatment of GAD, while preliminary suggestions emerged for agomelatine and vortioxetine. We did not find any evidence for determining the optimal length and/or dosage of medications to minimize the relapse risk. Few investigations have attempted to identify potential predictors of long-term treatment response. Personalized treatments for AnxDs can be implemented using predictive tools to explore those factors affecting treatment response/tolerability heterogeneity, including neurobiological functions/clinical profiles, comorbidity, biomarkers, and genetic features, and to tailor medications according to each patient's unique features.",

    "50": "Management of alcohol withdrawal in critically ill patients is a challenge. The alcohol consumption histories of intensive care patients are often incomplete, limiting identification of patients with alcohol use disorders. Abrupt cessation of alcohol places these patients at risk for alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Typically benzodiazepines are used as first-line therapy to manage alcohol withdrawal. However, if patients progress to more severe withdrawal or delirium tremens, extra adjunctive medications in addition to benzodiazepines may be required. Sedation and mechanical ventilation may also be necessary. Withdrawal assessment scales such as the Clinical Institute of Withdrawal Assessment are of limited use in these patients. Instead, general sedation-agitation scales and delirium detection tools have been used. The important facets of care are the rapid identification of at-risk patients through histories of alcohol consumption, management with combination therapies, and ongoing diligent assessment and evaluation.

Three doses (10, 30 and 100\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) of EA were administered to animals. Memory impairment was induced by scopolamine treatment (0.4\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) and/or diazepam (1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.). Acquisition trials were carried out 30\u2009min after scopolamine treatment and retention trials were performed for 5\u2009min 24\u2009h after the acquisition trials. Results EA at doses 30 and 100\u2009mg/kg significantly reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) in the EPM and PA tests in mice. Also, EA at doses 30 and 100\u2009mg/kg significantly antagonized the amnesia induced by diazepam (1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) in EPM test in rats. Moreover, chronic administration of EA at dose 30\u2009mg/kg ameliorated the memory deficit induced by diazepam (1\u2009mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. Discussion and conclusion This study demonstrates that ellagic acid is effective in preventing scopolamine- and diazepam-induced cognitive impairments without altering the animals' locomotion. This suggests the potential of EA application as a useful memory restorative agent in the treatment of dementia seen in elderly persons.", 
    "53": "Pyrrolo[1,4]benzodiazepines are tricyclic compounds that are considered \"privileged structures\" since they possess a wide range of biological activities. The first encounter with these molecules was the isolation of anthramycin from cultures of Streptomyces, followed by determination of the X-ray crystal structure of the molecule and a study of its interaction with DNA. This opened up an intensive synthetic and biological study of the pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines that has culminated in the development of the dimer SJG-136, at present in Phase II clinical trials. The synthetic efforts have brought to light some new synthetic methodology, while the contemporary work is focused on building trimeric pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines linked together by various heterocyclic and aliphatic chains. It is the broad spectrum of biological activities of pyrrolo[1,2-a][1,4]benzodiazepines that has maintained the interest of researchers to date whereas several derivatives of the even less studied pyrrolo[1,2-d][1,4]benzodiazepines were found to be potent non-nucleoside HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The present review is an update on the synthesis of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines since the last major review of 2011, while the overview of the synthesis of the other two tricyclic isomers is comprehensive.", 
    "54": "Coroners files and toxicological records of fatally-injured drivers in Victoria from 2000 to 2006 and from 2007 to 2013 were reviewed in separate studies to establish the role of prescribed drugs on crash risk. 2638 driver fatalities were included in the study, which represented over 97% of all driver fatalities in this period. The detection limits of the drugs were at the low end of those seen with common illicit drugs or prescribed drugs. Drugs of any type were found in 34.4% of the study group, medicinal drugs 21.2%, and alcohol (\u22650.05 gram/100mL) was found in 24.8%. The prevalence of the most common drugs detected that are legally available by prescription were anti-depressants (7.9%), benzodiazepines (7.0%), opiates/opioids (6.6%), and sedating anti-histamines (1.1%). Each driver was assessed for responsibility using a previously published and validated method. The crash risk of drivers taking opioids, benzodiazepines, or anti-depressants (primarily the serotonin reuptake inhibitors), were not significantly over-represented compared to the drug-free control group, although there was a suggestion of increased crash risk for benzodiazepines. Crash risk was elevated for drivers using cannabis (by presence of THC in blood at>2ng/mL) and amphetamines. These data show that drivers using medicinal drugs alone are unlikely to show significant crash risk even if drugs are potentially impairing.",

Therefore many addiction clinics perform oral fluid (OF) testing, which unlike urine is not subject to adulteration, to monitor CLON compliance. However, CLON and other benzodiazepines can be challenging to detect in OF due to their weakly acidic nature and their presence in low concentrations. We determined the optimal technical and clinical approach for the detection of CLON use using OF.",

    "63": "The present study investigated pharmacological characterizations of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subtypes involving ACh-induced endothelium-independent vasodilatation in rat mesenteric arteries. Changes in perfusion pressure to periarterial nerve stimulation and ACh were measured before and after the perfusion of Krebs solution containing muscarinic receptor antagonists. Distributions of muscarinic AChR subtypes in mesenteric arteries with an intact endothelium were studied using Western blotting. The expression level of M1 and M3 was significantly greater than that of M2. Endothelium removal significantly decreased expression levels of M2 and M3, but not M1. In perfused mesenteric vascular beds with intact endothelium and active tone, exogenous ACh (1, 10, and 100 nmol) produced concentration-dependent and long-lasting vasodilatations. In endothelium-denuded preparations, relaxation to ACh (1 nmol) disappeared, but ACh at 10 and 100 nmol caused long-lasting vasodilatations, which were markedly blocked by the treatment of pirenzepine (M1 antagonist) or 4-DAMP (M1 and M3 antagonist) plus hexamethonium (nicotinic AChR antagonist), but not methoctramine (M2 and M4 antagonist). These results suggest that muscarinic AChR subtypes, mainly M1, distribute throughout the rat mesenteric arteries, and that activation of M1 and/or M3 which may be located on CGRPergic nerves releases CGRP, causing an endothelium-independent vasodilatation.", 
    "64": "Aside from their use in the treatment of anxiety disorders and insomnia, benzodiazepines and other GABAA receptor positive modulators are widely used as add-on treatments in schizophrenic and non-schizophrenic psychoses. However, there is relatively little direct clinical or pre-clinical evidence for antipsychotic effects of GABAergic medications. Previous studies have indicated that zolpidem, a GABAergic drug acting preferentially at \u03b11-containing GABAA receptors, may produce catalepsy through interactions with dopaminergic neurotransmission. The aim of the present study was to investigate effects of zolpidem in experimental models of antipsychotic activity and extrapyramidal side effects in Wistar rats. Effects of zolpidem were compared with that of a classic benzodiazepine drug, diazepam and a second-generation antipsychotic medication, risperidone. High doses of risperidone (10.0mg/kg, i.p.) and zolpidem (10.0mg/kg, i.p.), but not diazepam, induced relatively short-lasting cataleptic responses in the bar test. Zolpidem and risperidone, but not diazepam, produced some antipsychotic-like effects at doses, which produced no catalepsy and did not inhibit spontaneous locomotor activity and apomorphine-induced stereotypies. The present results tend to indicate that zolpidem exerts some neuroleptic-like effects at doses, which do not produce motor side effects. Our findings may provide further rationale for the development of new subtype-selective GABAA receptor modulators for the treatment of psychotic symptoms.",

Benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) were the causative agents most commonly found, comprising 1,044 (87.2%) of all analyzed cases. Acetaminophen was involved in 81 (6.8%) cases. More than one active substance was involved in 35% of cases. In 7.3% there was ethanol co-ingestion and in 1.0% co-ingestion of some other recreational drug (primarily cocaine). Of 1,557 cases, six (0.39%) patients died. TCA were involved in two of these deaths.",

    "69": "Neurons in the vestibular nuclei have a vital function in balance maintenance, gaze stabilization, and posture. Although muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) are expressed and involved in regulating vestibular function, it remains unclear how individual mAChR subtypes regulate vestibular neuronal activity. In this study, we determined which specific subtypes of mAChRs control synaptic input and excitability of medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons that project to the cerebellum. Cerebellum-projecting MVN neurons were labeled by a fluorescent retrograde tracer and then identified in rat brainstem slices. Quantitative PCR analysis suggested that M2 and M3 were the possible major mAChR subtypes expressed in the MVN. The mAChR agonist oxotremorine-M significantly reduced the amplitude of glutamatergic excitatory post-synaptic currents evoked by stimulation of vestibular primary afferents, and this effect was abolished by the M2-preferring antagonist AF-DX 116. However, oxotremorine-M had no effect on GABA-mediated spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents of labeled MVN neurons. Furthermore, oxotremorine-M significantly increased the firing activity of labeled MVN neurons, and this effect was blocked by the M3-preferring antagonist J104129 in most neurons tested. In addition, AF-DX 116 reduced the onset latency and prolonged the excitatory effect of oxotremorine-M on the firing activity of labeled MVN neurons. Our findings suggest that M3 is the predominant post-synaptic mAChR involved in muscarinic excitation of cerebellum-projecting MVN neurons. Pre-synaptic M2 mAChR regulates excitatory glutamatergic input from vestibular primary afferents, which in turn influences the excitability of cerebellum-projecting MVN neurons. This new information has important therapeutic implications for treating vestibular disorders with mAChR subtype-selective agents. Medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) neurons projecting to the cerebellum are involved in balance control. We found that activation of pre-synaptic M2 muscarinic receptors inhibit glutamatergic input from vestibular primary afferents, whereas stimulation of post-synaptic M3 muscarinic receptors increases the firing activity of cerebellum-projecting MVN neurons. This new information advances our understanding of the cholinergic mechanism regulating the vestibular system.",

Pharmacological treatment options for SUD can be separated in medications for (i) intoxication, (ii) withdrawal, and (iii) reduction of use together with relapse prevention. This chapter will focus on approved or clinically established pharmacological strategies suited to manage symptoms of withdrawal, and to reduce substance use or to promote abstinence. Hereby SUD involving alcohol, nicotine, stimulants, and opioids are primarily discussed as these substances are considered most harmful for both the individual and the society. Moreover, the pharmacotherapy of SUD related to the use of cannabis, benzodiazepines, and gamma-hydroxybutyrate is also briefly reviewed.

The breathing abnormalities in sleep may play important role in generating epileptic seizure, but the adverse effect of seizure and antiepileptic therapy (generation of apneas and hypopneas) may worsen the seizure control. The effect of new therapies (vagal nerve and deep brain stimulation) on the sleep architecture and sleep disordered breathing must be examined and discussed.

Based on the structure of CNS 7056 with proven activity, seven new CNS 7056 derivatives were designed, and their sedative activities upon mouse, rats, and rabbits were examined. Sedative activities of EL-001\u02dc007 were screened. The results indicated that the shorter the side chain at C3 position is, the higher the sedative activity is. EL-001 was chosen as the optimal compound for studies of ED50 , LD50 , latency to LRR and the duration of LRR, and its anesthetic activity was compared with that of CNS 7056 in rats and rabbits. Studies showed that EL-001 is a potent sedative in rodent and lagomorpha, with a short duration of action.

What emerges from the CADTH guidelines is that the best strategy remains gradual tapering of BDZ with little evidence for the use of adjunctive medications. The results show that simple interventions such as discontinuation letters from clinicians, self-help information and support in general, added to gradual tapering may be associated with a two- to three-fold higher chance of successful withdrawal, compared with treatment as usual.

Aberrant EEG gamma oscillations and reductions in the P1/N1 complex peak amplitude of the auditory evoked potential (AEP) are neurophysiological biomarkers for schizophrenia that indicate disruption in sensory information processing. Inhibition of phosphodiesterase (i.e. PDE10A) and activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR2) signaling are believed to provide antipsychotic efficacy in schizophrenia, but it is unclear whether this occurs with cognition-enhancing potential. The present study used the auditory paired click paradigm in passive awake Sprague Dawley rats to 1) model disruption of AEP waveforms and oscillations as observed in schizophrenia by peripheral administration of amphetamine and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist phencyclidine (PCP); 2) confirm the potential of the antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine to attenuate these disruptions; 3) evaluate the potential of mGluR2 agonist LY404039 and PDE10 inhibitor PQ-10 to improve AEP deficits in both the amphetamine and PCP models. PCP and amphetamine disrupted auditory information processing to the first click, associated with suppression of the P1/N1 complex peak amplitude, and increased cortical gamma oscillations. Risperidone and olanzapine normalized PCP and amphetamine-induced abnormalities in AEP waveforms and aberrant gamma/alpha oscillations, respectively. LY404039 increased P1/N1 complex peak amplitudes and potently attenuated the disruptive effects of both PCP and amphetamine on AEPs amplitudes and oscillations. However, PQ-10 failed to show such effect in either models. These outcomes indicate that modulation of the mGluR2 results in effective restoration of abnormalities in AEP components in two widely used animal models of psychosis, whereas PDE10A inhibition does not.",

However the frequency of its continued use in the real world has not been well studied, especially at longer follow-ups. The aim of this study was to clarify the frequency of long-term BZD use among new BZD users over longer follow-ups and to identify its predictors. We conducted a cohort study to examine how frequently new BZD users became chronic users, based on a large claims database in Japan from January 2005 to June 2014. We used Cox proportional hazards models to identify potential predictors. A total 84,412 patients with new BZD prescriptions were included in our cohort. Among them, 35.8% continued to use BZD for three months, 15.2% for one year and 4.9% for eight years without ever attaining three months of no BZD prescription. The confirmed predictors for long-term BZD use were older age, psychiatrist-prescriber, regular use, high dose of BZD, and concomitant prescription of psychotropic drugs. When we consider BZD use, we have to keep in mind these figures and avoid these predictors as much as possible.",

Guidelines, clinical research, Meta-analysis, and reviews in recent years were collected using electronic data base. Discussions included: (1) the definition of light sedation, and its effects on clinical outcome, stress, sleep and delirium; (2) light sedation strategies included: the target population, the target sedation strategy and daily sedation interruption, clinical assessment and monitoring of sedation, selection of sedative drugs, light sedation extenuation; (3) light sedation strategies and pain, agitation, delirium control bundles; (4) the problems and prospects of light sedation. Light sedation is the main principle of currently ICU sedation strategy in critically ill adult patients. Goal-directed light sedation should be considered as a routine therapy in most clinical situation, and its goal should be achieved as early as possible in the early stage of sedation. Routine use of benzodiazepines should be avoided, especially in patients with or at a risk of delirium. Prevention and treatment of agitation with a combination of non-pharmacologic or pharmacologic methods; ICU specification rules for pain, agitation and delirium prevention and treatment should be made. Light sedation is the main ICU sedation strategy in adult patients now, but must be individualized for each patient.",

However, OLZ treatment is often associated with body weight (BW) gain and metabolic derangements. Therefore, the search for prospective markers for OLZ's negative side effects as well as adjunctive treatments to inhibit these has been of major interest. The aim of this study was to investigate in healthy male volunteers (age: 36 \u00b1 11 years; BW: 84 \u00b1 12 kg; BMI=25.5 \u00b1 2.5) whether adjunctive topiramate (TPM) administration opposes OLZ-induced weight gain over the course of 14 days treatment. In addition, we investigated behavioral, endocrine and metabolic characteristics as underlying and potentially predictive factors for weight regulation and/or metabolic derangements associated with OLZ and TPM treatment. While adjunctive TPM indeed reduced OLZ-induced weight gain (P<0.05, Mann-Whitney U), behavioral/metabolic/endocrine characteristics of OLZ treatment were not affected by TPM. Using multiple regression analysis, BW gain was the key factor explaining metabolic disturbances (e.g., plasma insulin- LDL interaction: P<0.01, R(2)=.320), and cumulative food intake during treatment was the best denominator of BW gain (P<0.01, R(2)=.534). Neither TPM treatment, nor its circulating levels, contributed to variation observed in \u0394BW. In a second multiple regression analysis, we observed that a low baseline thyrotropin profile (TSHAUC) before the start of drug treatment was associated with an increase in \u0394BW over the course of drug treatment (P<0.05, R(2)=.195). Adding TSHAUC as covariate revealed that adjunctive TPM treatment did attenuate OLZ induced BW gain (P<0.05, ANCOVA). Further exploration of the circulating thyroid hormones revealed that individuals with a low plasma TSH profile were also those that were most sensitive to adjunctive TPM treatment blocking OLZ-induced \u0394BW gain. Others have shown that OLZ-induced BW gain is associated with improvement in brief psychiatric rating scores (BPRS); adjunctive TPM treatment may be a solution specifically for those subjects susceptible to OLZ-induced rapid weight gain who-on a therapeutic level-benefit most of OLZ treatment.",

There are also known to be species differences between rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs) in the behavioral effects of NOP agonists. The aims of this study were the following: 1) to determine if the NOP agonist Ro 64-6198 could be trained as a discriminative stimulus; 2) to evaluate its pharmacological selectivity as a discriminative stimulus; and 3) to establish the order of potency with which Ro 64-6198 produces discriminative stimulus effects compared with analgesic effects in NHPs. Two groups of rhesus monkeys were trained to discriminate either fentanyl or Ro 64-6198 from vehicle. Four monkeys were trained in the warm-water tail-withdrawal procedure to measure antinociception. Ro 64-6198 produced discriminative stimulus effects that were blocked by the NOP antagonist J-113397 and not by naltrexone. The discriminative stimulus effects of Ro 64-6198 partially generalized to diazepam, but not to fentanyl, SNC 80, ketocyclazocine, buprenorphine, phencyclidine, or chlorpromazine. Fentanyl produced stimulus effects that were blocked by naltrexone and not by J-113397, and Ro 64-6198 did not produce fentanyl-appropriate responding in fentanyl-trained animals. In measures of antinociception, fentanyl, but not Ro 64-6198, produced dose-dependent increases in tail-withdrawal latency. Together, these results demonstrate that Ro 64-6198 produced stimulus effects in monkeys that are distinct from other opioid receptor agonists, but may be somewhat similar to diazepam. In contrast to previous findings, Ro 64-6198 did not produce antinociception in the majority of animals tested even at doses considerably greater than those that produced discriminative stimulus effects.",

Volunteers from both sexes were divided into groups receiving either the C. aurantium essential oil through inhalation, diazepam (10\u2009mg), or the placebo. The evaluation was performed through psychometric scales [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)] and physiological measurements (blood pressure and cardiac and respiratory frequency). Inhalation of C. aurantium was associated with a decrease in the STAI-S scores, suggesting an anxiolytic effect. In support of these results, a change in all the physiological measurements was observed in the group exposed to C. aurantium. In the diazepam group, only the diastolic pressure decreased, and no effect was observed in the placebo group. Therefore, the results showed that C. aurantium exhibits an anxiolytic effect and reduces the signs and symptoms associated with anxiety in patients with CML.", 
    "158": "Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing neurite outgrowth and synaptic plasticity plays a critical role in the pathology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) can induce symptoms of schizophrenia as well as reduce dendritic spine density and neurite growth. The antipsychotic drug olanzapine may improve these deficits. This study aimed to investigate: (1) if olanzapine prevents PCP-induced suppression of neurite outgrowth and synaptic protein expression; (2) if olanzapine affects the Akt-GSK3 signaling pathway; and (3) the role of neuregulin 1 (NRG1) in this process. Immunofluorescence revealed that PCP treatment for 24\u2009hours reduces both neurite length (28.5%) and the number of neurite branches (35.6%) in primary prefrontal cortical neuron cultures. PCP reduced protein and mRNA expressions of synaptophysin (24.9% and 23.2%, respectively) and PSD95 (31.5% and 21.4%, respectively), and the protein expression of p-Akt (26.7%) and p-GSK3\u03b2 (35.2%). Olanzapine co-treatment prevented these PCP-induced effects in normal neurons but not in neurons from NRG1-knockout mice. These results indicate that NRG1 mediates the preventive effects of olanzapine on the PCP-induced impairment of neurite outgrowth and synaptic protein expression. This study provides potential targets for interventions on improving the efficacy of olanzapine on preventing cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",

    "172": "Anorexia nervosa is a mental illness that emerges primarily during early adolescence, with mortality rate that is 200 times higher than that of suicide. The illness is characterized by intense fear of gaining weight, heightened anxiety, obstinate food restriction, often accompanied by excessive exercise, in spite of mounting hunger. The illness affects females nine times more often than males, suggesting an endocrine role in its etiology. Its relapse rate exceeds 25%, yet there are no accepted pharmacological treatments to prevent this. Here, we summarize studies from this laboratory that have used adolescent female rodents in activity-based anorexia (ABA), an animal model of anorexia nervosa, with the goal of identifying neurobiological underpinnings of this disease. We put forth a hypothesis that a GABAergic mechanism within the hippocampus is central to regulating an individual\u05f3s anxiety which, in turn, strongly influences the individual\u05f3s resilience/vulnerability to ABA. In particular, we propose that ionotropic GABAA receptors containing the subunits alpha4 and delta, are at play for exerting shunting inhibition upon hippocampal pyramidal neurons that become more excitable during ABA. Since these receptors confer insensitivity to benzodiazepines, this pharmacological profile of ABA fits with lack of report indicating efficacy of benzodiazepines in reducing the anxiety experienced by individuals with anorexia nervosa. The idea that the GABAergic system of the hippocampus regulates resilience/vulnerability to anorexia nervosa complements current opinions about the important roles of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, striatum, gustatory pathways and feeding centers of the hypothalamus and of the neuromodulators, serotonin and dopamine, in the etiology of the disease.

    "173": "Slow waves are characteristic waveforms that occur during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep that play an integral role in sleep quality and brain plasticity. Benzodiazepines are commonly used medications that alter slow waves, however, their effects may depend on the time of night and measure used to characterize slow waves. Prior investigations have utilized minimal scalp derivations to evaluate the effects of benzodiazepines on slow waves, and thus the topography of changes to slow waves induced by benzodiazepines has yet to be fully elucidated. This study used high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) to evaluate the effects of oral temazepam on slow wave activity, incidence, and morphology during NREM sleep in 18 healthy adults relative to placebo. Temazepam was associated with significant decreases in slow wave activity and incidence, which were most prominent in the latter portions of the sleep period. However, temazepam was also associated with a decrease in the magnitude of high-amplitude slow waves and their slopes in the first NREM sleep episode, which was most prominent in frontal derivations. These findings suggest that benzodiazepines produce changes in slow waves throughout the night that vary depending on cortical topography and measures used to characterize slow waves. Further research that explores the relationships between benzodiazepine-induced changes to slow waves and the functional effects of these waveforms is indicated.",

Ghrelin has been identified as an endogenous ligand for GHS-R, and it is the only orexigenic peptide found in the peripheral organs. Olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent that binds to and inhibits the activation of GPCR for several neurotransmitters, has metabolic side effects such as excessive appetite and weight gain. Recently, studies have revealed that the orexigenic mechanism of olanzapine is mediated via GHS-R signaling, although the precise mechanisms have not been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of olanzapine on ghrelin-mediated GHS-R signaling by using an electrical impedance-based receptor biosensor assay system (CellKey\u2122). Olanzapine at concentrations of 10(-7) and 10(-6)mol/L enhanced ghrelin-induced (10(-10)-10(-8)mol/L) GHS-R activation. A Ca(2+) imaging assay revealed that olanzapine (10(-7) and 10(-6)mol/L) enhanced ghrelin (10(-7) M)-induced GHS-R activity. In contrast, haloperidol (an antipsychotic agent) failed to enhance this ghrelin-mediated GHS-R activation, as demonstrated by both the CellKey\u2122 and Ca(2+) imaging assays. Together, these results suggest that olanzapine, but not haloperidol, promotes appetite by enhancing ghrelin-mediated GHS-R signaling.",

The precise pathophysiology of CVS is not known but a strong association with migraine headaches, in the patient as well as the mother indicates that it may represent a mitochondriopathy. Studies have also suggested the role of an underlying autonomic neuropathy involving the sympathetic nervous system in its pathogenesis. CVS has known triggers in many individuals and avoiding these triggers can help prevent the onset of the episodes. It typically presents in four phases: a prodrome, vomiting phase, recovery phase and an asymptomatic phase until the next episode. Complications such as dehydration and hematemesis from Mallory Wise tear of the esophageal mucosa may occur in more severe cases. Blood and urine tests and abdominal imaging may be indicated depending upon the severity of symptoms.

Residential detoxification is more appropriate for patients with a history of seizures, delirium tremens, unstable psychiatric comorbidity, or another associated substance use disorder (grade B). BZDs are only justified beyond a 1-week period in the case of persistent withdrawal symptoms, withdrawal events or associated BZD dependence (grade B). BZDs should not be continued for more than 4 weeks (grade C). The dosing and duration of thiamine (vitamin B1) during detoxification should be adapted to nutritional status (EC). For relapse prevention, acamprosate and naltrexone are recommended as first-line medications (grade A). Disulfiram can be proposed as second-line option in patients with sufficient information and supervision (EC). For reducing alcohol consumption, nalmefene is indicated in first line (grade A). The second-line prescription of baclofen, up to 300 mg/day, to prevent relapse or reduce drinking should be carried out according to the \"temporary recommendation for use\" measure issued by the French Health Agency (EC). During pregnancy, abstinence is recommended (EC). If alcohol detoxification is conducted during pregnancy, BZD use is recommended (grade B). No medication other than those for alcohol detoxification should be initiated in pregnant or breastfeeding women (EC). In a stabilized pregnant patient taking medication to support abstinence, the continuation of the drug should be considered on a case-by-case basis, weighing the benefit/risk ratio. Only disulfiram should be always stopped, given the unknown risks of the antabuse effect on the fetus (EC). First-line treatments to help maintain abstinence or reduce drinking are off-label for people under 18 years of age and should thus be considered on a case-by-case basis after the repeated failure of psychosocial measures alone (EC). Short half-life BZDs should be preferred for the detoxification of elderly patients (grade B). The initial doses of BZDs should be reduced by 30 to 50% in elderly patients (EC). In patients with chronic alcohol-related physical disorders, abstinence is recommended (EC).

    "216": "Psychoactive substances are used worldwide and constitute one of the most common groups of pharmaceutical contaminants in surface waters. Although these pharmaceuticals are designed to be efficiently eliminated from the human body, very little is known about their trophic-transfer potential in aquatic wildlife. Therefore, the goal of the present study was to quantify and compare uptake of an anxiolytic (oxazepam) from water (bioconcentration) and via the consumption of contaminated diet (trophic transfer) in 2 common freshwater predators: Eurasian perch (Perca fluviatilis) and the dragonfly larvae Aeshna grandis. Bioconcentration and trophic transfer of oxazepam were found in both predator species. However, higher bioconcentrations were observed for perch (bioconcentration factor [BCF], 3.7) than for dragonfly larvae (BCF, 0.5). Perch also retained more oxazepam from consumed prey (41%) than dragonfly larvae (10%), whereas the relative contribution via prey consumption was 14% and 42% for perch and dragonflies, respectively. In addition, bioconcentration was negatively correlated with perch weight, indicating that exposure levels in natural contaminated environments differ between individuals of different size or between different developmental stages. Hence, trophic transfer of pharmaceuticals may indeed occur, and estimates of environmental exposures that do not consider intake via food or size-dependent bioconcentration may therefore lead to wrongful estimations of realized exposure levels in natural contaminated ecosystems.",

Long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics can offer a useful option to improve adherence. Due to the type of sustained-release mechanism, olanzapine pamoate (OLAI) can differ in safety as compared with oral olanzapine. Recent safety data concerning olanzapine pamoate required an update of previous systematic reviews.", 
    "218": "Safety data were found in US and EU clinical trial registries, and a literature search was undertaken using the databases PubMed and EMBASE to find all relevant published studies. Where appropriate, the number needed to harm and 95% confidence interval for categorical safety outcomes were calculated.",

Olanzapine pamoate can be a choice for schizophrenic patients with a history of response to and acceptable tolerance of oral olanzapine, who have easy access to mental healthcare settings with emergency services for the treatment of PDSS. Long-term, prospective studies assessing the efficacy and safety of OLAI and head-to-head comparisons with other LAI and oral antipsychotics are needed.",

Compared to nonrecidivist drivers, recidivists at first attendance were more likely to be male and had higher scores on measures of alcohol dependence and adverse legal consequences of substance use. Compared to nonrecidivist drivers, recidivists at second attendance were significantly older, had a higher income, were more likely to be retired, and were less likely to be employed part-time. They had fewer legal problems. Recidivists reported fewer drinking days and fewer drinks per occasion but greater use of benzodiazepines than nonrecidivists and had higher scores on a measure of future risk of alcohol- and drug-related problems. Comparison of recidivists' characteristics at first versus second attendance confirmed many of these findings, with second-time recidivists reporting fewer drinks per drinking day and greater use of benzodiazepines and having higher scores on a measure of future substance use problems than first-time recidivists.",

Dalfampridine (4-aminopyridine) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January 2010 for treatment of MS. Our patient was a 34-year-old male with a history of MS, who was brought to the emergency department after being found unresponsive. His current medications were valacyclovir, temazepam, dalfampridine (4-AP) and a tysabri intravenous (IV) infusion. Fifteen minutes after arrival the patient seized. The seizures were refractory to benzodiazepines, barbiturates and phenytoin. The 4-AP level was 530 ng/mL (25 ng/mL and 49 ng/mL). The patient stopped seizing on hospital day 3 and was discharged 14 days later with normal mental status and neurologic exam. 4-AP is a potassium channel blocker that blocks the potassium ion current of repolarization following an action potential. The blockade of the potassium channel at the level of the membrane widens the action potential and enhances the release of acetylcholine, thus increasing post-synaptic action potentials. The treatment of patients with 4-AP overdose is supportive. Animal data suggest that patients with toxic levels of 4-AP may respond to phenytoin. Our case illustrates the highest recorded level of 4-AP in an overdose. Our patient appeared to be refractory to a combination of high doses of anticonvulsants and only improved with time.",

Midazolam was replaced with pentobarbital infusion with no significant change in electroencephalography. A continuous ketamine infusion was initiated as an adjunct to pentobarbital. After initiation of ketamine, seizure frequency decreased and sustained burst suppression was achieved. After 48 hours of induced burst suppression, pentobarbital was discontinued followed by ketamine and the patient remained seizure on oral anticonvulsants alone. Meanwhile, a 57-year-old woman (patient 2) with autoimmune encephalitis developed SE, which was refractory to first-line medications. Pentobarbital infusion was initiated with attainment of burst suppression on electroencephalography. Multiple attempts at weaning pentobarbital failed because of recurrence of seizures. To minimize the dose of pentobarbital needed, a continuous ketamine infusion was initiated as an adjunct to pentobarbital with maintenance of burst suppression at much lower doses of pentobarbital than before. Ketamine was continued for 19 days with titration of other antiepileptic therapy, without return of SE.", 
    "228": "These cases demonstrate that ketamine may show promise as an adjunct to induced pentobarbital coma for refractory SE. Adjunctive use of ketamine may reduce the dose and duration of pentobarbital required, hence preventing complications associated with barbiturate therapy. Future studies are needed to define the optimal dose, timing, and role of ketamine infusions in the management of refractory SE.",

Our primary outcome measure, the difference between predrug and postdrug administration epochs (\u0394area under the curve-intracranial hypertension), was calculated for all occurrences. We examined potential covariates including age, injury severity, mechanism, and time after injury; time after injury correlated with \u0394area under the curve-intracranial hypertension. In a mixed-effects model, with patient as a random effect, drug/dose combination as a fixed effect, and time after injury as a covariate, intracranial hypertension increased after administration of fentanyl and/or midazolam (overall aggregate mean \u0394area under the curve-intracranial hypertension = +17 mm Hg \u00d7 min, 95% CI, 0-34 mm Hg \u00d7 min; p = 0.04). The mean \u0394area under the curve-intracranial hypertension increased significantly after administration of high-dose fentanyl (p = 0.02), low-dose midazolam (p = 0.006), and high-dose fentanyl plus low-dose midazolam (0.007).

No statistical difference existed between propofol and midazolam groups (P = 0.108) or between fentanyl and dexmedetomidine groups (P = 0.542). Midazolam and propofol produced more sedative-induced focal neurologic deficits compared with fentanyl and dexmedetomidine.

    "250": "A new class of pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-Gallic hybrid agents (PBD-GA) conjugated through alkyl spacers has been designed and synthesized. The combination of these two core pharmacophores with modification in the C-8 position of the PBD ring with alkyl spacers afforded oxygen-tethered compounds 5a-5d and amide-tethered analogues 11a-11d with improved anticancer activity for two melanoma cell lines, A375 and RPMI7951, differing in their p53 status. The agents 5a-5d were cytotoxic in melanoma compared to agents 11a-11d. In particular, compounds 5b and 5c were found to possess the most potent activity compared with other hybrid agents and were proved with the help of quantitative structure activity relationship studies (QSAR). These PBD conjugates caused S phase arrest for the A375\u00a0cell line via increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)/ATM-Rad3-related (ATR) and checkpoint kinases 1 (Chk1) activation. Moreover, the PBD-GA induced A375 apoptotic cell death followed through p53 (ATM downstream target) increase, B-cell leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL) and mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8mt) decrease, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3/Poly Adp Ribose Polymerase (PARP) cleavage. On the other hand, mutant p53 RPMI7951\u00a0cell death occurred by PBD-GA-mediated mitochondria- and caspase-dependent pathways via lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), but not through p53 signaling. Finally, compound 5b was shown to reduce murine melanoma size in a mouse model. These results suggest that the PBD-GA could be used as a useful chemotherapeutic agent in melanoma with activated p53 or mutant p53.",

In the analyses of internally prepared control urine samples at concentrations around the DDRP administrative decision point for benzodiazepines (100 ng/mL), both technologies produced comparable results with average accuracies between 99.7 and 107.3% and average coefficients of variation (%CV) <9%. Analysis of service member specimens that screened positive for benzodiazepines using both technologies produced comparable results for all analytes. Different degrees of matrix effect were observed for all analytes in the LC-MS-MS analysis. However, the effects were controlled by using deuterated internal standards (ISTDs). Additionally, there was a 39% increase in nordiazepam mean concentration analyzed by LC-MS-MS due to suppression of the ISTD ion by the flurazepam metabolite 2-hydroxyethylflurazepam. The ease and speed of sample extraction, the broader range of compounds that can be analyzed and shorter run time make the LC-MS-MS technology a suitable and expedient alternative confirmation technology for benzodiazepine testing.",
