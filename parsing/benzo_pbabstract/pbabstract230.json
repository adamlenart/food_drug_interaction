We previously reported that ibogaine, administered systemically, produces degeneration of a subset of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, primarily within the vermis. Ablation of the inferior olive affords protection against ibogaine-induced neurotoxicity leading to the interpretation that ibogaine itself is not directly toxic to Purkinje cells. We postulated that ibogaine produces sustained excitation of inferior olivary neurons that leads to excessive glutamate release at climbing fiber terminals, causing subsequent excitotoxic injury to Purkinje cells. The neuronal degeneration induced by ibogaine provides an animal model for studying excitotoxic injury in order to analyze the contribution of glutamate receptors to this injury and to evaluate neuroprotective strategies. Since non-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors mediate Purkinje cell excitation by climbing fibers, we hypothesized that 1-4-aminophenyl-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI-52466), which antagonizes non-NMDA receptors, may have a neuroprotective effect by blocking glutamatergic excitation at climbing fiber synapses. To test this hypothesis, rats were administered systemic ibogaine plus GYKI-52466 and the degree of neuronal injury was analyzed in cerebellar sections. The results indicate that the AMPA antagonist GYKI-52466 (10 mg/kg i.p. x 3) does not protect against Purkinje cell injury at the doses used. Rather, co-administration of GYKI-52466 with ibogaine produces increased toxicity evidenced by more extensive Purkinje cell degeneration. Several hypotheses that may underlie this result are discussed. Although the reason for the increased toxicity found in this study is not fully explained, the present results show that a non-NMDA antagonist can produce increased excitotoxic injury under some conditions. Therefore, caution should be exercised before employing glutamate antagonists to reduce the risk of neuronal damage in human clinical disorders. Moreover, the contribution of different glutamate receptors to excitotoxic injury is complex and merits further analysis.",

    "2": "Eighteen patients implanted with the Jewel AF atrial defibrillator for drug-resistant persistent atrial fibrillation only were studied in an open-labelled randomised crossover study. Patients were assigned to sedation (S) with midazolam elixir, analgesia (A) with morphine sulphate or combination therapy (C) with dextromoramide and lorazepam. Pre-medication was taken up to 1 h before cardioversion. Patients rotated through each type of medication after undertaking at least one cardioversion. Visual analogue scales were completed immediately post-cardioversion and 24 h later for pain, anxiety and 'unpleasantness'. Higher scores represented a worse outcome.", 
    "3": "After 2 years' follow-up, 238 cardioversions were performed with S, 17 with A and 35 with C. The mean immediate combined score for S (10.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 8.2-13.6) was significantly lower than for A (17.3, 95% CI 15.1-19.5, P = 0.01) and for C (15.9, 95% CI 12.3-19.6, P = 0.02).

N-Methyl tri-deuterated flumazenil was used as an internal standard. The analyte and internal standard were extracted from plasma samples using solid-phase extraction, with a recovery of 78%. This was determined through the convenience of radioactivity measurements of 11C-labelled flumazenil. The evaporated and reconstituted eluate was analysed by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The calibration curve was linear over the tested concentration range of 0.05-0.5 nM (15-150 pg/ml) with a correlation coefficient, R2, of 0.998+/-0.001. A high precision was achieved, with mean intra-assay and inter-assay relative standard deviations of at most 6 and 7%, respectively. The accuracy of the method ranged from 95 to 104%. As a proof of concept, the validated method was applied in the determination of flumazenil in plasma from two healthy volunteers participating in a PET study with three repeated investigations. A bolus-infusion protocol was used to achieve a constant concentration level of flumazenil. The average plasma concentrations ranged from 0.11 and 0.19 nM and all measurements were within the calibration standard range. The flumazenil concentrations were relatively constant within each scan and the average intra-scan precision was 15%.", 
    "6": "The herbal remedy, kava, is reviewed, with special focus on the anesthetic management of the perioperative patient. Consumption of kava has potential cardiovascular consequences that could manifest in the perioperative period. Kava may act through inhibition of sodium and calcium channels to cause direct decreases in systemic vascular resistance and blood pressure. Kava inhibits cyclooxygenase to potentially cause a decrease in renal blood flow and to interfere with platelet aggregation. Kava may also cause adverse neurologic effects because of benzodiazepine and antidepressant activities on noradrenergic and/or serotoninergic pathways that may potentiate benzodiazepine and induction anesthetic potency and cause excessive perioperative sedation. Patients often do not disclose their use of herbal substances, and drug interaction can occur without being suspected as the cause for a change in patient homeostasis. A role for patient education about the potential adverse consequences of kava use in the perioperative period is suggested.",

    "8": "In the present work, we studied the ability of thymol to affect the organization of model membranes and the activity of an intrinsic membrane protein, the GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)-R). In this last aspect, we tried to elucidate if the action mechanism of this terpene at the molecular level, involves its binding to the receptor protein, changes in the organization of the receptor molecular environment, or both. The self-aggregation of thymol in water with a critical micellar concentration approximately = 4 microM and its ability to penetrate in monomolecular layers of soybean phosphatidylcholine (sPC) at the air-water interface, even at surface pressures above the equilibrium, lateral pressure of natural bilayers were demonstrated. Thymol affected the self-aggregation of Triton X-100 and the topology of sPC vesicles. It also increased the polarity of the membrane environment sensed by the electrochromic dye merocyanine. A dipolar moment of 1.341 Debye was calculated from its energy-minimized structure. Its effect on the binding of [3H]-flunitrazepam ([3H]-FNZ) to chick brain synaptosomal membranes changed qualitatively from a tendency to the inhibition to a clear activatory regime, up on changing the phase state of the terpene (from a monomeric to a self-aggregated state). Above its CMC, thymol increased the affinity of the binding of [3H]-FNZ (K(d-control)= 2.9, K(d-thymol)= 1.7 nM) without changing the receptor density (B(max-control)= 910, B(max-thymol)= 895 fmol/mg protein). The activatory effect of thymol on the binding of [ [3H]-FNZ was observed even in the presence of the allosteric activator gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at a concentration of maximal activity, and was blocked by the GABA antagonist bicuculline. Changes in the dipolar arrangement and in the molecular packing of GABA(A)-R environment are discussed as possible mediators of the action mechanism of thymol.", 
    "9": "Sexual dysfunction is a major, although poorly understood, side-effect of treatment with antipsychotic drugs. We have recently show marked disruption of reproductive function and weight gain in female rats treated subchronically with risperidone and haloperidol. The aim of the present study was to examine further the potential relationship between reproductive dysfunction and weight gain in female rats treated with olanzapine. The effects of olanzapine on weight gain, food and water intake, intra-abdominal fat, the oestrous cycle and uterine weight were assessed in group-housed adult female hooded-Lister rats. Olanzapine (0.5-4.0 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle was administered once daily for 21 days and body weight, food and water intake measured, with histological examination of vaginal lavage to determine the stage of the oestrous cycle. On day 22, animals were sacrificed and intra-abdominal fat, wet and dry uterine weights measured. Olanzapine induced significant weight gain with concomitant increases in food and water intake and intra-abdominal fat without an effect on the oestrous cycle, wet and dry uterine weights or plasma prolactin levels. These results confirm the ability of olanzapine to induce weight gain in female rats on unrestricted normal diet with a concomitant increase in food and water intake and increased intra-abdominal fat. These effects of olanzapine were produced in the absence of any apparent impairment in reproductive function, in contrast to the substantial disruption of oestrous and uterine atrophy previously shown in rats treated with risperidone and haloperidol.", 
    "10": "Patients with dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), often have nocturnally disrupted sleep. Clinically, this may present as agitation during the nighttime hours, which may affect as many as a quarter of AD patients during some stage of their illness. Sleep disturbance in AD may be multifactorial and involve sleep-disordered breathing and disrupted chronobiology, both often characterized by excessive daytime napping. Polysomnographically, AD patients show decreased rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in proportion to the extent of their dementia; some evidence suggests that cholinesterase inhibitors, commonly used pharmacologic agents for cognitive loss in AD, may increase REM sleep measures. Unfortunately, such agents may also induce insomnia and vivid dreams. There have been no randomized clinical trials of sedative-hypnotic medications specifically targeted at AD patients with sleep problems. Evidence suggests that sedative-hypnotics, such as benzodiazepine site-specific agonists, may have a role in some cases, whereas atypical antipsychotics may be necessary in other cases. There are also reports of successful interventions with nonpharmacologic options (eg, exercise, illumination). The utility of melatonin as a hypnotic in this population appears equivocal.", 
    "11": "This study compared the safety and efficacy of fentanyl and meperidine for analgesia in pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy. In a double-blind, randomized trial, 24 patients (11 males) received either fentanyl (1 microg/kg) or meperidine (1 mg/kg). These analgesics were administered in unmarked syringes by an investigator who did not participate in the procedure or in the evaluation of the patient's sedation. There were 17 Caucasians and 7 African-Americans whose mean age was 10.4 +/- 4.4 years. Thirteen patients received meperidine and 11 received fentanyl. Midazolam was given to all patients as needed to provide sufficient sedation for the procedure. Study subjects underwent EGD (n = 17) or colonoscopy (n = 7). There were no differences as assessed by patient, endoscopist, or assistant for tolerance, discomfort, procedure ease, recovery time, complications, heart rate, blood pressure, or oxygen saturation. We conclude that meperidine and fentanyl are equally effective in providing analgesia for pediatric gastrointestinal endoscopy.", 
    "12": "This is the first report of which we are aware that describes the use of procedural sedation for the emergency department management of ear and nose foreign bodies in children < 18 years of age. During a 5.5-year period, we identified 312 cases of children with a foreign body in a single orifice (174 ear, 138 nose). Procedural sedation was performed in 23% of cases (43 ear, 28 nose) and ketamine was used most commonly (92%). Emergency physicians had a high rate of success in removing foreign bodies (84% ear, 95% nose) and a low complication rate. Procedural sedation had a positive effect on the success rate as more than half of the sedation cases had undergone failed attempts without sedation by the same physician. Emergency physicians should have familiarity with this indication for procedural sedation.", 
    "13": "Beta-carbolines are a class of drug which can interact with a high affinity with the benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding site of the GABAA receptor. The present paper, aimed at obtaining a deeper insight into the structure-properties relationships of this class of molecules, reports the crystal structures of four beta-carbolines: ZK93423 (3-carboethoxy-4-methoxymethyl-6-benzyloxy-beta-carboline), ZK91296 (3-carboethoxy-4-methoxymethyl-5-benzyloxy-beta-carboline), FG7142 (N-methyl-3-carbamoyl-beta-carboline) and the low-affinity ligand harmine hydrochloride (1-methyl-7-methoxy-beta-carboline). This set of structural data is completed by the X-ray structures of other carbolines of known biological activity retrieved from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database and by the structures of beta-CCE (3-carboethoxy-beta-carboline), 6-PBC (3-carboethoxy-4-methoxymethyl-6-isopropoxy-beta-carboline), PRCC (3-isopropoxy-beta-carboline) and ZK93426 (3-carboethoxy-4-methyl-5-isopropoxy-beta-carboline), which have been obtained by molecular-mechanics simulations. The structural features of all these molecules have been compared according to the stereochemical model we proposed in 1987. The structural comparison is integrated by the Free-Wilson analysis on 32 beta-carbolines of known binding affinity data.", 
    "14": "The role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the distribution of the benzodiazepine triazolam (TRZ) and the azole antifungal agent ketoconazole (KET), and on the TRZ-KET interaction, was studied using mdr1a(-) or mdr1a/b(-/-) mice (P-gp-deficient mice) and matched controls. TRZ and KET also were studied in Caco-2 cells in Transwell culture. After single i.p. injections of TRZ or KET in separate groups of control mice, brain concentrations of TRZ exceeded those in serum [brain/serum area under the concentration curve (AUC) ratio, 5.0], whereas brain/serum AUC ratios for KET were approximately 0.5. On the basis of single time points, brain concentrations of TRZ, or brain/serum ratios, were similar in P-gp-deficient animals compared with controls, whereas P-gp-deficient animals had significantly higher KET brain concentrations and brain/serum ratios. Coadministration of KET with TRZ increased TRZ concentrations in serum, liver, and brain, both in controls and in P-gp-deficient animals, probably attributable to impairment by KET of CYP3A-mediated clearance of TRZ. However, KET did not increase brain/serum ratios of TRZ in either group. In Caco-2 cells, basal-to-apical flux of TRZ was higher than apical-to-basal flux. However, verapamil (100 microM) did not alter flux in either direction. KET inhibited basal-to-apical transport of rho-damine-123, with a 50% inhibitory concentration of 2.7 microM. Thus, TRZ does not appear to undergo measurable blood-brain barrier efflux transport by P-gp in this animal model. KET impairs clearance of TRZ but does not increase tissue uptake. However, KET itself may be a substrate for efflux transport at the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "15": "The binding of drugs to plasma proteins is important to consider when concentrations in whole blood (eg, in forensic toxicology) are compared with therapeutic and toxic concentrations based on the analysis of plasma or serum. The plasma to whole blood distribution of diazepam (D) and its major metabolite nordiazepam (ND) was investigated under in vitro and ex vivo conditions. Studies in vitro were done by spiking whole blood with D and ND to give concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 microg/g. Venous blood was also obtained from hospital blood donors (n = 66) after informed consent. The hematocrit, hemoglobin, and water content of blood specimens were determined by routine procedures before D and ND were added to produce target concentrations of approximately 0.5 microg/g for each substance. The ex vivo work was done with blood specimens from hospital outpatients who were being medicated with D. Concentrations of D and ND were determined in body fluids by capillary column gas chromatography after adding prazepam as internal standard and solvent extraction with butyl acetate. The method limit of quantitation was 0.03 microg/g for both D and ND. The concentrations of D and ND were highest in plasma and lowest in erythrocytes. The plasma/blood (P/B) distribution ratios did not depend on drug concentration between 0.1 and 1.0 microg/g. The mean P/B ratios were 1.79:1 for D and 1.69:1 for ND when hematocrit was 45%. Furthermore, the P/B ratio for D (y) was positively correlated with blood hematocrit (x) and the regression equation was y = 0.636 + 0.025x (r = 0.86, P < 0.001). A similar strong association was found between the P/B ratio and hematocrit for ND (r = 0.79). P/B ratios of D and ND, blood hematocrit, hemoglobin, and the water content differed between sexes (P < 0.001). The overall mean P/B ratios for D and ND were 1.69 +/- 0.097 (+/- SD) and 1.62 +/- 0.08 (P < 0.001, n = 66) respectively when the mean hematocrit was 42.9 +/- 3.4 (+/- SD). For forensic purposes, it would be better to forgo making any conversion of a drug concentration measured in whole blood to that expected in plasma or serum; instead, therapeutic and toxic concentrations should be established for the actual specimens received.", 
    "16": "Clinically used benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic agents for the treatment of insomnia produce their therapeutic effects through allosteric enhancement of the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA at the GABA(A) receptor. Indiplon is a novel pyrazolopyrimidine sedative-hypnotic agent, currently in development for insomnia. Using radioligand binding studies, indiplon inhibited the binding of [(3)H]Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) to rat cerebellar and cerebral cortex membranes with high affinity (K(i) values of 0.55 and 0.45 nM, respectively). [(3)H]Indiplon binding to rat cerebellar and cerebral cortex membranes was reversible and of high affinity, with K(D) values of 1.01 and 0.45 nM, respectively, with a pharmacological specificity consistent with preferential labeling of GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1 subunits. In \"GABA shift\" experiments and in measurements of GABA-induced chloride conductance in rat cortical neurons in culture, indiplon behaved as an efficacious potentiator of GABA(A) receptor function. In both the radioligand binding and electrophysiological experiments, indiplon had a higher affinity than zolpidem or zaleplon. These in vitro properties are consistent with the in vivo properties of indiplon as an effective sedative-hypnotic acting through allosteric potentiation of the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "17": "Indiplon (NBI 34060; N-methyl-N-[3-[3-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-alpha]pyrimidin-7-yl]phenyl]acetamide), a novel pyrazolopyrimidine and high-affinity allosteric potentiator of GABA(A) receptor function, was profiled for its effects in rodents after oral administration. In mice, indiplon inhibited locomotor activity (ED(50) = 2.7 mg/kg p.o.) at doses lower than the nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics zolpidem (ED(50) = 6.1 mg/kg p.o.) and zaleplon (ED(50) = 24.6 mg/kg p.o.), a sedative effect that was reversed by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. Indiplon inhibited retention in the mouse passive avoidance paradigm over a dose range and with a temporal profile that coincided with its sedative activity. Indiplon, zolpidem, and zaleplon were equally effective in inhibiting locomotor activity in the rat and produced dose-related deficits on the rotarod. In a rat vigilance paradigm, indiplon, zolpidem, and zaleplon produced performance deficits over a dose range consistent with their sedative effects, although indiplon alone showed no significant increase in response latency. Indiplon produced a small deficit in the delayed nonmatch to sample paradigm at a dose where sedative effects became apparent. Indiplon was active in the rat Vogel test of anxiety, but it showed only a sedative profile in the mouse open field test. The pharmacokinetic profile of indiplon in both rat and mouse was consistent with its pharmacodynamic properties and indicated a rapid T(max), short t(1/2), and excellent blood-brain barrier penetration. Therefore, indiplon has the in vivo profile of an efficacious sedative-hypnotic, in agreement with its in vitro receptor pharmacology as a high-affinity allosteric potentiator of GABA(A) receptor function, with selectivity for alpha1 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "18": "Estrogen may have differing effects on 'anxiety' responses under different conditions. The current study tested the effects of estrogen on anxiety-like behavior when administered for 6-7 days in ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. Two animal paradigms were utilized; the elevated plus maze (EPM), measuring changes in innate fear of exploration of open spaces; and the social interaction test (SIT), measuring the exploration of a novel, same gender partner. In the EPM, estradiol-treated OVX females both entered and spent more time in the open arms than control OVX females, indicating an anxiolytic-like action of estradiol. In contrast, estradiol treated OVX females interacted less with the partner animal in the SIT compared with controls suggesting anxiogenic-like effects. The possible anxiogenic effect of estradiol in the SIT is supported by two findings: (1) the effect is reversed by the anxiolytic drug alprazolam and (2) estrogen did not affect locomotion and therefore, the reduced social interaction is not due to reduced activity. Acute administration of progesterone (5 mg/kg), which has anxiolytic properties, did not reverse estradiol-induced social interaction deficits, suggesting that lack of progesterone did not account for estradiol's anxiogenic effects. These results, while seemingly contradictory when interpreted within a unified concept of anxiety, may well reflect the ethological roles of reproductive hormones and their effects on different types of exploratory anxiety.", 
    "19": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to cell damage during reperfusion of the heart. ROS may exert their effects partly by interfering with Ca(2+) homeostasis of the myocardium. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) on Ca(2+) accumulation during reoxygenation of isolated adult rat cardiomyocytes exposed to 1 h of hypoxia and to relate the effects to possible changes in release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), free intracellular Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](i)) and Mg(2+)([Mg(2+)](i)), and mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsim). Cell Ca(2+) was determined by (45)Ca(2+) uptake. Free [Mg(2+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](i) and Deltapsim were measured by flow cytometry. Reoxygenation-induced Ca(2+) accumulation was attenuated by 23 and 34% by 10 and 25 microM H(2)O(2), respectively, added at reoxygenation. H(2)O(2) at 100 and 250 microM increased cell Ca(2+) by 50 and 83%, respectively, whereas 500 microM H(2)O(2) decreased cell Ca(2+) by 20%. H(2)O(2) at (25 microM) reduced LDH release and [Mg(2+)](i) and increased Deltapsim, indicating cell protection, whereas 250 microM H(2)O(2) increased LDH release and [Mg(2+)](i) and decreased Deltapsim, indicating cell damage. Clonazepam (100 microM) attenuated the increase in Ca(2+) accumulation, the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i), and the decrease in Deltapsim induced by 100 and 250 microM H(2)O(2) during reoxygenation. We report for the first time that 25 microM H(2)O(2) attenuates Ca(2+) accumulation, LDH release, and dissipation of Deltapsim during reoxygenation of hypoxic cardiomyocytes, indicating cell protection.",

The records of 81 children started on the ketogenic diet consecutively over a 2-year period were reviewed for a 6-month period after diet initiation. During their first 6 months on the ketogenic diet, medications were tapered in 53 of 81 (65%) patients, with 30 of 53 (57%) considered \"early\" (tapered during diet initiation or within the first month afterward). No differences were seen between the early and late groups with respect to percentage with > 90% seizure reduction at 3 months (47% vs 48%), diet duration (1.1 vs 0.9 years), percentage remaining on the ketogenic diet to date (73% vs 65%), or improved alertness (63% vs 57%). Nine of fifty-three (17%) had transient seizure increases during medication tapering, with no correlation to the timing in which this occurred; however, five were taking benzodiazepines or barbiturates. All had > 50% seizure reduction at 3 months despite the transient worsening. Early reduction of anticonvulsants in children initiated on the ketogenic diet appears to be safe and well tolerated. However, it offers no specific advantage compared with a later taper.", 
    "21": "The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a benzodiazepine but not gamma-aminobutyric acid-binding mitochondrial membrane protein, has roles in steroid production, energy metabolism, cell survival and growth. PBR expression in the nervous system has been reported in non-neuronal glial and immune cells. We now show expression of both PBR mRNA and protein, and the appearance of binding of a synthetic ligand, [(3)H]PK11195, in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons following injury to the sciatic nerve. In na\u00efve animals, PBR mRNA, protein expression and ligand binding are undetectable in the DRG. Three days after sciatic nerve transection, however, PBR mRNA begins to be expressed in injured neurons, and 4 weeks after the injury, expression and ligand binding are present in 35% of L4 DRG neurons. PBR ligand binding also appears after injury in the superficial dorsal horn of the spinal cord. The PBR expression in the DRG is restricted to small and medium-sized neurons and returns to na\u00efve levels if the injured peripheral axons are allowed to regrow and reinnervate targets. No non-neuronal PBR expression is detected, unlike its putative endogenous ligand the diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI), which is expressed only in non-neuronal cells, including the satellite cells that surround DRG neurons. DBI expression does not change with sciatic nerve transection. PBR acting on small-calibre neurons could play a role in the adaptive survival and growth responses of these cells to injury of their axons.",

This tool may therefore be used to display the occurrence of microglial activation in the course of neurodegeneration. A patient with the clinical diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and left-sided symptoms was studied using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and [(11)C]PK 11195 PET. We found a marked right hemispheric hypometabolism and asymmetric microglial activation in corresponding areas of the basal ganglia and right temporal and parietal cortex.

    "24": "Dystonia of the limbs may be due to a wide range of aetiologies and may cause major functional limitation. We investigated whether the previously described pathological 4 to 7 Hz drive to muscles in cervical dystonia is present in patients with aetiologically different types of dystonia of the upper and lower limbs. To this end, we studied 12 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic carriers of the DYT1 gene, 6 patients with symptomatic dystonia due to focal basal ganglia lesions, and 11 patients with fixed dystonia, a condition assumed to be mostly psychogenic in aetiology. We evaluated EMG-EMG coherence in the tibialis anterior (TA) of these and 15 healthy control subjects. Ten of 12 (83%) of symptomatic DYT1 patients had an excessive 4 to 7 Hz common drive to TA, evident as an inflated coherence in this band. This drive also involved the gastrocnemius, leading to co-contracting electromyographic bursts. In contrast, asymptomatic DYT1 carriers, patients with symptomatic dystonia, patients with fixed dystonia, and healthy subjects showed no evidence of such a drive or any other distinguishing electrophysiological feature. Moreover, the pathological 4 to 7 Hz drive in symptomatic DYT1 patients was much less common in the upper limb, where it was only present in 2 of 6 (33%) patients with clinical involvement of the arms. We conclude that the nature of the abnormal drive to dystonic muscles may vary according to the muscles under consideration and, particularly, with aetiology.", 
    "25": "In this study, we investigated whether changes in the regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis and oxidative stress may be detected, peripherally, in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). For this purpose, we measured caspase-3 activity, Bcl-2 concentrations, peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) expression and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentrations in lymphocytes of untreated PD patients, patients treated only with L-Dopa or with L-Dopa and dopamine agonists and healthy volunteers. Caspase-3 activity was significantly increased in all PD patient groups. Patients treated with L-Dopa and dopamine agonists showed the lowest values of Bcl-2, coupled with the highest density of PBRs, while increased levels of Cu/Zn SOD were found in the group under monotherapy with L-Dopa. We also found, in PD patients, clear, negative correlations between Bcl-2 levels and both duration and severity of the disease. Our findings point to the existence of changes in the regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis in PD patients -- observable outside the central nervous system -- which seem to be modulated by the pharmacological treatment with dopaminergic agents.", 
    "26": "Drugs have been associated with the development of delirium in the elderly. Successful treatment of delirium depends on identifying the reversible contributing factors, and drugs are the most common reversible cause of delirium. Anticholinergic medications, benzodiazepines, and narcotics in high doses are common causes of drug induced delirium. This article provides an approach for clinicians to prevent, recognise, and manage drug induced delirium. It also reviews the mechanisms for this condition, especially the neurotransmitter imbalances involving acetylcholine, dopamine, and gamma aminobutyric acid and discusses the age related changes that may contribute to altered pharmacological effects which have a role in delirium. Specific interventions for high risk elderly with the goal of preventing drug induced delirium are discussed.", 
    "27": "The effects of cholinergic drugs on the quantal contents of the nerve-evoked endplate currents (EPCs) and the parameters of the time course of quantal release (minimal synaptic latency, main modal value of latency histogram and variability of synaptic latencies) were studied at proximal, central and distal regions of the frog neuromuscular synapse. Acetylcholine (ACh, 5 x 10(-4) M), carbachol (CCh, 1 x 10(-5) M) or nicotine (5 x 10(-6) M) increased the numbers of EPCs with long release latencies mainly in the distal region of the endplate (90-120 microm from the last node of Ranvier), where the synchronization of transmitter release was the most pronounced. The parameters of focally recorded motor nerve action potentials were not changed by either ACh or CCh. The effects of CCh and nicotine on quantal dispersion were reduced substantially by 5 x 10(-7) M (+)tubocurarine (TC). The muscarinic agonists, oxotremorine and the propargyl ester of arecaidine, as well as antagonists such as pirenzepine, AF-DX 116 and methoctramine, alone or in combination, did not affect the dispersion of the release. Muscarinic antagonists did not block the dispersion action of CCh. Cholinergic drugs either decreased the quantal content m(o) (muscarinic agonist, oxotremorine M, and nicotinic antagonist, TC), or decreased m(o) and dispersed the release (ACh, CCh and nicotine). The effects on m(o) were not related either to the endplate region or to the initial level of release dispersion. It follows that the mechanisms regulating the amount and the time course of transmitter release are different and that, among other factors, they are altered by presynaptic nicotinic receptors.", 
    "28": "Benzodiazepines (BZs) acting as modulators of GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) are an important group of drugs for the treatment of anxiety disorders. However, a large inter-individual variation in BZ sensitivity occurs in the human population with some anxiety disorder patients exhibiting diminished sensitivity to BZ and reduced density of GABA(A)Rs. The mechanism underlying BZ treatment resistance is not known, and it is not possible to predict whether an anxiety patient will respond to BZ. 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor (5-HT1AR) null mice (R-/-) on the Swiss-Webster (SW) background reproduce several features of BZ-resistant anxiety; they exhibit anxiety-related behaviors, do not respond to BZ, have reduced BZ binding, and have decreased expression of the major GABA(A)R subunits alpha1 and alpha2. Here, we show that R-/- mice on the C57Bl6 (B6) background also have anxiety phenotype, but they respond to BZ and have normal GABA(A)R subunit expression. This indicates that the 5-HT1AR-mediated regulation of GABA(A)R alpha subunit expression is subject to genetic modification. Hybrid SW/B6-R-/- mice also exhibit BZ-resistant anxiety, suggesting that SW mice carry a genetic modifier, which mediates the effect of the 5-HT1AR on the expression of GABA(A)Ralpha subunits. In addition, we show that this genetic interaction in SW mice operates early in postnatal life to influence the expression of GABA(A)R alpha subunits at the transcriptional level. These data indicate that BZ-resistant anxiety results from a developmental arrest of GABA(A)R expression in SW-R-/- mice, and a similar mechanism may be responsible for the BZ insensitivity of some anxiety patients.", 
    "29": "Recent discussions and proposed rules and regulations regarding outpatient surgery facilities have raised the question of the appropriateness of general anesthesia versus heavy sedation. The controversy is based mostly on anecdotal information and the prejudice of the authors. A recent article that describes the improved platelet function induced by ketamine adds patient safety to the rationale for sedation. Most of us have trained in university settings where an entire department was devoted to general anesthesia and little true outpatient surgery was performed. When ambulatory facilities were available, they were usually staffed by anesthesiologists. Indeed, the first free-standing outpatient surgery center in Phoenix, Arizona, was owned and operated by a local group of anesthesiologists. Properly administered, diazepam and ketamine dissociative sedation is safe and effective for every aesthetic procedure, regardless of size or duration, and it should be available for all aesthetic surgeons. In the author's experience, more than 30,000 procedures have been performed with this method since 1966 without a single case of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolus. In contrast, a former associate, because of his lack of experience, chose to use general anesthesia for a few larger cases in another facility. One of those cases, an abdominoplasty, resulted in a serious case of deep vein thrombosis with subsequent alleged disability and litigation. Therefore, the author is writing to share his extensive experience with his colleagues in hopes that these safe systems will become more widespread and to spare future patients the attendant unnecessary increased morbidity and mortality associated with general anesthesia.", 
    "30": "An increased risk for occurrence of diabetic metabolic states has been reported for treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Initial studies suggest that atypical antipsychotics as a heterogeneous group of substances are not equally concerned. An increased risk for development of diabetes mellitus can be assumed for clozapine and olanzapine, while other atypical and conventional antipsychotics seem to carry only a slightly elevated risk. It remains as yet unresolved whether there is a causal connection or whether other not yet identified factors are involved. However, atypical antipsychotics intervene in various ways in glucose and fatty acid metabolism due to their broad receptor profile. We suggest that some atypical antipsychotics disturb regulatory loops of fat metabolism in fatty tissue and muscle,which may result in insulin resistance and finally diabetes. Changes in leptin release and development of leptin resistance possibly play an important role. These new results should be considered when planning therapy, although a final risk analysis is not yet possible.",

    "43": "Social stress is a common occurrence in our society that can negatively impact health. Therefore, we wanted to study the effects of a mild stressor designed to model social stress on seizure susceptibility and GABAA receptors in male and female rats. The mild chronic stress of individual housing consistently decreased bicuculline (but not pentylenetetrazol, PTZ) seizure thresholds by 10-15% in both sexes. Housing conditions did not alter the anticonvulsant activity of diazepam or ethanol, although the anticonvulsant effect of ethanol was significantly greater against PTZ-induced seizures. Experiments testing the addition of an acute restraint stress unmasked sex differences in seizure induction. The acute stress also selectively decreased the potency of GABA to modulate GABAA receptor-mediated chloride uptake in group-housed females. There were additional sex differences by housing condition for GABAA receptor-gated chloride uptake but no differences in [3H]flunitrazepam binding. We also found significant effects of sex and housing on ethanol-induced increases in corticosterone (CORT) levels. In summary, there were complex and sex-selective effects of mild chronic stress on seizure induction and GABAA receptors. Gaining a better understanding of mechanisms underlying interactions between sex and stress has important implications for addressing health concerns about stress in men and women.", 
    "44": "The present study compared the anxiolytic effects of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam and ethanol in adult male and female rats. Varying doses of diazepam (1-3 mg/kg) or ethanol (0.5-2.0 g/kg) were tested using both the elevated plus maze and defensive prod-burying models. Two time points following ethanol administration (10 and 30 min) were tested in the plus maze. Sex differences were seen in some anxiety-related behaviors, with females showing greater open arm time and reduced burying behavior than males. Although this suggests females displayed less anxiety-like behavior than males, the differences in the plus maze were not observed in all testing situations. Both diazepam and ethanol dose-dependently increased open arm times in the plus maze and reduced burying behavior in the defensive prod-burying task. The parallel nature of the dose-response curves suggests that both diazepam and ethanol have similar anxiolytic effects in males and females. No sex differences were seen in the brain levels of diazepam-like activity or blood alcohol levels with these treatments. A greater corticosterone response was observed in females than males with these two behavioral tests, but neither diazepam nor ethanol decreased this response. These results suggest a dissociation between the anxiety-reducing influences of these compounds and the changes in stress-related endocrine responses.", 
    "45": "In fish, melanin pigment granules in the retinal pigment epithelium disperse into apical projections as part of the suite of responses the eye makes to bright light conditions. This pigment granule dispersion serves to reduce photobleaching and occurs in response to neurochemicals secreted by the retina. Previous work has shown that acetylcholine may be involved in inducing light-adaptive pigment dispersion. Acetylcholine receptors are of two main types, nicotinic and muscarinic. Muscarinic receptors are in the G-protein coupled receptor superfamily, and five different muscarinic receptors have been molecularly cloned in human. These receptors are coupled to adenylyl cyclase, calcium mobilization and ion channel activation. To determine the receptor pathway involved in eliciting pigment granule migration, we isolated retinal pigment epithelium from bluegill and subjected it to a battery of cholinergic agents.",

    "57": "Transfer-appropriate processing theory (Roediger, Weldon, & Challis, 1989) proposes that dissociations between performance on explicit and implicit memory tests arise because these tests often rely on different types of information processing (e.g., perceptual processing vs conceptual processing). This perspective predicts that implicit and explicit memory tasks that rely primarily on conceptual processing should show comparable results, not dissociations. Numerous studies have demonstrated such similarities. It is, however, possible that these results arise from explicit memory contamination of performance on implicit memory tasks. To address this issue, an experiment was conducted in which participants were administered the sedative midazolam prior to study. Midazolam is known to create a temporary, but dense, period of anterograde amnesia. The effects of blocking stimulus materials by semantic category at study and generation at study were investigated on category exemplar production and category-cued recall. The results of this study demonstrated a dissociation of the effects of midazolam on category exemplar production and category-cued recall. Specifically, midazolam reduced the effect of blocking stimulus materials in category-cued recall, but not in category exemplar production. The differential effect of midazolam on explicit and implicit memory is at odds with transfer-appropriate processing theory and suggests that theories of memory must distinguish the roles of different types of conceptual processing on implicit and explicit memory tests.",

AC-5216 showed high affinity for MBRs prepared from rat whole brain (Ki 0.297 nm), rat glioma cells (IC50 3.04 nm) and human glioma cells (IC50 2.73 nm), but only negligible affinity for the other main receptors including central benzodiazepine receptors.

These effects of AC-5216 were antagonized by PK11195, an MBR antagonist. In the forced swimming test in rats, AC-5216 (3-30 mg kg(-1), p.o.) reduced the immobility time, and this effect was blocked by PK11195. AC-5216 had no myorelaxant effects, did not affect the memory or prolong hexobarbitone-induced sleep in mice, even at doses as high as 1000 mg kg(-1), p.o. Although it did slightly prolong the ethanol-induced sleep time at 1000 mg kg(-1), AC-5216 (1-100 mg kg(-1), p.o.) produced no distinct change in the rat electroencephalogram. These results indicate that AC-5216 produces anti-anxiety and antidepressant-like effects that are mediated by MBR, but does not cause the side effects normally associated with conventional benzodiazepines. Hence, AC-5216 shows potential for the treatment of stress-related disorders including anxiety and depression.",

Isobolic analyses were performed to describe the interactions. Unfortunately, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the interaction of both drugs on the spike and wave discharge activity because the effect of diazepam was shown to be dominant. Only vigabatrin decreased the behavioural activity, whereas there was a trend towards a decrease after diazepam. All treatments dose dependently increased the power in the beta frequency band. Unfortunately, the dose ratio was not optimal to describe the interaction. The theta peak frequency was dose dependently decreased after all treatments. There was a synergistic interaction between the two drugs on this variable. These data support both the idea that an increase in power in the beta frequency band can serve as a biomarker for GABAergic inhibition and the suggestion that clinically effective anxiolytics decrease the theta peak frequency.

This effect could be reversed by diluting and washing the preparation. Addition of 20-microM GABA shifted to the right the inhibition curve of PCALC36 on [3H]flunitrazepam binding (IC50 ratio of 0.68), which is characteristic for inverse agonists. PCALC36 produced little change in the GABAergic tonic currents recorded by whole-cell patch clamp in cultured rat hippocampal neurones, but it caused a 20% reduction in miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current amplitude and completely antagonised the full (direct) agonist midazolam in a quickly reversible manner.

The patients mainly presented with marked irritability and recurrent startles in response to handling or even minute sounds, accompanied by rhythmic jerky movements and occasionally breath-holding episodes. Family history was negative for hyperekplexia, although eight parents reported jerky leg movements during sleep. The hallmark of hyperekplexia consisted of a hyper-alert gaze and an exaggerated startle with delayed habituation, also elicited by nose tapping and air blowing on the face accompanied by increasing rigidity. Nine severely affected infants, presenting with relentless startles, marked stiffness, violent rhythmic jerks, and breath-holding episodes were treated with oral low doses of clonazepam and completely recovered. Overall, the debilitating symptoms of hyperekplexia gradually resolved in all 39 infants, and their developmental assessment by 2 years of age was within the normal range. Therefore a prompt diagnosis of hyperekplexia during the neonatal period and early infancy, and then treatment if required with benzodiazepines to alleviate the debilitating symptoms, may prevent life-threatening events and enable better feeding and handling. Establishing the diagnosis of such a relatively benign disorder with a favorable developmental outcome may avoid unjustified extensive investigations or unnecessary treatment, suspecting an ominous progressive neurologic disorder.",

Concerning mu receptors, LFS decreased binding values in ipsilateral sensorimotor (7.2%) and temporal (5.6%) cortices, dentate gyrus (5.8% ipsi and 6.8% contralateral, respectively), and contralateral CA1 area of dorsal hippocampus (5.5%). LFS did not modify alpha(1) receptor and adenylyl cyclase binding values. These findings suggest that the antiepileptic effects of LFS may involve activation of GABA-BZD and endogenous opioid systems.", 
    "89": "Ethanol ingestion, like food ingestion, stimulates release of the signaling molecule cholecystokinin (CCK) from the small intestine. Here, we investigated the possibility that ethanol-induced CCK release might be a negative-feedback control of ethanol ingestion, similar to its function as part of the mechanism by which ingested food produces meal-ending satiation. We used Sardinian alcohol-preferring (sP) and Marchesian Sardinian (msP) alcohol-preferring rats, two apparently identical substrains that spontaneously ingest pharmacologically relevant amounts of ethanol, as well as their background strain, Wistar (W) rats. We demonstrated that: (1) intraperitoneal (IP), but not intracerebroventricular, injections of 0.5-4 microg/kg CCK-8 produced transient, dose-related reductions in 10% ethanol ingestion; (2) this inhibitory effect of CCK-8 on ethanol intake appeared behaviorally similar to its inhibitory action on ingestion of sucrose solutions; (3) the inhibitory effect of IP CCK-8 on ethanol ingestion occurred without evidence of tolerance when tests were repeated on consecutive days; (4) IP CCK-8 reduced ethanol intake despite simultaneously reducing blood ethanol levels (BALs); and (5) antagonism of CCK1 receptors with devazepide increased ethanol intake, indicating that endogenous CCK normally limits the size of bouts of ethanol ingestion. These results implicate peripheral CCK in the control of ethanol ingestion in sP and msP alcohol-preferring rats.", 
    "90": "The brain corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) circuits are activated by stressful stimuli, contributing to behavioral and emotional responses. The present study assessed anxiety-like responses and in vivo neurochemical alterations at the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) evoked by exposure to an unfamiliar (anxiogenic) environment. Also, the impact of anxiolytic treatments and those that affect CRH were assessed in this paradigm. Novel environment (new cage) markedly suppressed ingestion of a palatable snack. This effect was dose-dependently antagonized by diazepam and was utilized as an index of anxiety in the rodent. Although exposure to a novel environment also stimulated the in vivo release of CRH and glutamate at the CeA, various CRH antagonists (e.g. alphah-CRH, Calpha-MeCRH, CP-154,526, antisauvagine-30, preproTRH178-199) did not attenuate the stressor-elicited behavioral suppression, although Calpha-MeCRH was found to attenuate the freezing response elicited by contextual stimuli that were associated with previously administered footshock. Moreover, central infusion of CRH failed to suppress snack consumption in the home cage. Although diazepam had potent anxiolytic effects in this paradigm, this treatment did not prevent the stressor-associated release of CRH and glutamate at the CeA. Thus, while neural circuits involving CRH and/or glutamatergic receptors at the CeA may be activated by an unfamiliar environment, the data challenge the view that activation of these receptors is necessary for the expression of anxiety-like behavioral responses. Rather than provoking anxiety, these systems might serve to draw attention to events or cues of biological significance, including those posing a threat to survival.",

This algorithm for the management of RLS was written by members of the Medical Advisory Board of the Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation and is based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. Restless legs syndrome is divided into intermittent, daily, and refractory types. Nonpharmacological approaches, including mental alerting activities, avoiding substances or medications that may exacerbate RLS, and addressing the possibility of iron deficiency, are discussed. The role of carbidopa/levodopa, dopamine agonists, opioids, benzodiazepines, and anticonvulsants for the different types of the disorder is delineated.", 
    "92": "One of the most commonly performed outpatient procedure is colonoscopy. The pain and anxiety is frequently associated with colonoscopy. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of remifentanil/midazolam, and tramadol/midazolam for iv sedation and analgesia during colonoscopy. Twentysix patients (age range 18-65 years) scheduled for ambulatory colonoscopy were included to study. All patients received midazolam 1 mg intravenous. After two minutes in Group R (remifentanil/midazolam, n=18) remifentanil bolus (10 microg) and infusion 0.03 microg kg(-1) min(-1) were administered until adequate sedation level was achieved. In Group T (tramadol/midazolam, n=18) iv tramadol 50 mg was given concurrently. During procedure 2 L/min oxygen was supplemented via face mask to all patients. Haemodynamic variables, respiratory depression, level of sedation, postoperative recovery, patient and gastroenterologist satisfaction were surveyed. Patients were asked to verbally rate their level of pain, on an 10-point numerical rating scale (1=no pain, 10=severe pain). Chi-square, student t test, and mann whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Colonoscopy was carried out successfully in all patients. There were no episodes of desaturation or airway compromise. Haemodynamic parameters were similar in both groups. Sistolic arterial and diastolic arterial pressures were increased at 10 and 15 minutes in all patients (P<0.05). There were no significant changes in heart rate in both groups. The level of sedation in group R was higher than group T during colonoscopy. The patients in group T had higher pain scores. Gastroenterologist satisfaction and patient satisfaction were similar in both groups. Our results suggests that, sedoanalgesia with midazolam/remifentanil may be an alternative to sedoanalgesia with midazolam/tramadol for colonoscopy.",

    "94": "We used telephone records to identify patients who had called for prescription refills between mid 2001 and mid 2002. We then reviewed medical records of those patients to identify those who received refills for opioids or benzodiazepines for treatment of chronic pain. Medical records were evaluated to measure the percentage of records exhibiting documentation of compliance with state prescribing laws and other features indicative of a high standard of care.", 
    "95": "Ninety seven percent of records included documentation of the diagnosis for which chronic therapy was indicated. Required Material Risk Notification Forms were absent from 100% of charts. Seventy-five percent of records document consultation with a pain specialist or other physician with specialty pertinent to the patient's source of pain. Medication contracts were only present in 39% of records, and documentation of a pain evaluation and functional evaluation was present in 67% and 54% of records, respectively.",

    "97": "Infantile tracheomalacia is a potentially life-threatening disease requiring prolonged artificial respiratory support. Diagnosis and management of this disease may be further improved by establishing a suitable objective and quantitative assessment protocol for tracheal collapsibility. It is our hypothesis that tracheal collapsibility can be represented by the relationship between intraluminal pressure and the cross-sectional area of the trachea. To test this hypothesis, static pressure/area relationships of the trachea were obtained from anesthetized and paralyzed infants, who were diagnosed as having tracheomalacia by endoscopic observation. These relationships were fitted on a linear regression model, followed by calculation of the estimated closing pressure. The tracheal closing pressure ranged from -8 to -27 cm H(2)O, suggesting easy collapsibility of the trachea during crying or coughing and noncollapsibility during the spontaneous respiratory cycle, which coincided with the infants' symptoms. It is our conclusion that tracheal collapsibility of infants with tracheomalacia can be quantitatively assessed by the static pressure/area relationship of the trachea obtained under general anesthesia and paralysis.", 
    "98": "In interpreting the maintenance literature for bipolar disorder, attention needs to be paid to important methodological issues. In this article, we initially examine the methodological topics that need to be considered, and we then examine the content of the evidence regarding maintenance treatments. Agents used in the long-term treatment of bipolar disorder possess varying degrees of supportive evidence. By consensus, the number of randomized studies and years of clinical experience with lithium mark it as the evidentially strongest long-term agent for bipolar disorder. Recent studies also demonstrate likely long-term benefit with lamotrigine, and possibly olanzapine. Although we possess fewer randomized data, some such evidence exists and, along with clinical experience, supports the likely long-term utility of valproate in the treatment of bipolar disorder as well. Some psychotherapies also may possess adjunctive maintenance efficacy.", 
    "99": "A 61-year-old female underwent resection of a giant thyroid tumor, and tracheal stenosis ensued. She had cough, dyspnea, and palpitation in the supine position. The giant thyroid tumor was of the size of 11 x 12 cm and the diameter of trachea was 8 x 6 mm at 3.5 cm below the vocal cord, at which point the trachea was the narrowest on cervical computed tomography. The peak expiratory flow rate from the flow-volume curve was 2.94 l x sec(-1) (% predicted value 55.2%) in the upright position. We were concerned about difficult airway management. Oro-tracheal intubation with an armored tube (ID 7.5 mm) was performed after intravenous midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 50 microg, 4% lidocaine spray 2 ml with oxygen 6 l x min(-1) inhalation keeping spontaneous breathing and consciousness. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with intravenous propofol, fentany, vecuronium and nitrous oxide in oxygen to keep the bispectral index between 40 and 60. The extracted thyroid tumor was 620 g in weight. A careful preoperative evaluation of the airway using ultrasonography, CT, MRI, laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy and respiratory function test, especially peak expiratory flow rate of the flow-volume curve is important in such a case of a giant thyroid tumor. Intubation under conscious sedation with midazolam and fentanyl is useful for a patient with a giant thyroid tumor and tracheal stenosis.", 
    "100": "Pharmacotherapy is an effective part of treatment for most anxiety disorders, but not for specific phobia or performance anxiety. In them it is contraindicated, because it interferes with the effectiveness of exposure therapies and the extinction of fear responses. Interference with exposure-extinction is a drug side effect that should rarely if ever be tolerated in treating them. This article reviews the many indications for pharmacotherapy in treating most anxiety disorders and contrasts its usefulness in treatment of anxiety disorders with its relatively rare usefulness in treating specific phobias and performance anxiety. In both the latter disorders, benzodiazepines interfere with exposure and generally are best avoided, although temporary use, with safeguards, can sometimes be helpful for a specific phobia. The recent discovery that D-cycloserine (DCS) facilitates exposure and the extinction of anxiety offers promise that it could in the future be usefully and broadly employed to catalyze and enhance exposure therapies.", 
    "101": "Intraoperative wakefulness (\"awareness\") is still a relevant problem. Different stages of wakefulness exist: conscious awareness with explicit recall of pain in 0.03% and with nonpainful explicit recall in 0.1-0.2% of all anesthesias; amnesic awareness or implicit recall may occur with unknown, even higher incidences. Sufficient analgesia minimizes possible painful perceptions. Opioids, benzodiazepines, and N(2)O alone or combined lead to the highest incidences of nonpainful intraoperative wakefulness. Volatile anesthetics, etomidate, barbiturates, and propofol in sufficient doses effectively block any sensory processing and therefore abolish intraoperative wakefulness. Intraoperative awareness with recall may lead to sustained impairment of the patients, in severe cases even to a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The observation of clinical signs does not reliably detect intraoperative wakefulness in all cases; monitoring of end-tidal gas concentrations, EEG, or evoked potentials may help in prevention. Active information is recommended only for patients at higher risk. Complaints about recall of intraoperative events should be taken seriously; in cases of sustained symptoms psychological help may be necessary.", 
    "102": "Tetanus is a worldwide health problem, causing the deaths of approximately 1,000,000 people every year. In Germany, about 15 infections are reported annually. The initial symptoms often develop in the head and neck region. As a result, some patients are referred to the otorhinolaryngologist. We report on a 83 year old female who suffered from recurrent aspiration and trismus. She had acquired a small injury on her lower leg 2 weeks earlier; protective antibody levels did not exist. The neurophysiological examination showed a result typical of tetanus. The patient received tetanus immunoglobulin, metronidazole and benzodiazepines. Due to respiratory problems, tracheotomy and ventilation became necessary. Elderly people often lack protective antibody levels against tetanus. If typical symptoms are manifest, tetanus has to be considered as a possibility. A complete history, including recent injuries and past vaccinations, should be compiled.", 
    "103": "GABA-induced currents have been characterized in isolated horizontal cells from lower vertebrates but not in mammalian horizontal cells. Therefore horizontal cells were isolated after enzymatical and mechanical dissociation of the adult mouse retina and visually identified. We recorded from horizontal cell bodies using the whole cell and outside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Extracellular application of GABA induced inward currents carried by chloride ions. GABA-evoked currents were completely and reversibly blocked by the competitive GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (IC50 = 1.7 microM), indicating expression of GABAA but not GABAC receptors. Their affinity for GABA was moderate (EC50 = 30 microM), and the Hill coefficient was 1.3, corresponding to two GABA binding sites. GABA responses were partially reduced by picrotoxin with differential effects on peak and steady-state current values. Zinc blocked the GABA response with an IC50 value of 7.3 microM in a noncompetitive manner. Furthermore, GABA receptors of horizontal cells were modulated by extracellular application of diazepam, zolpidem, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboxylate, pentobarbital, and alphaxalone, thus showing typical pharmacological properties of CNS GABAA receptors. GABA-evoked single-channel currents were characterized by a main conductance state of 29.8 pS and two subconductance states (20.2 and 10.8 pS, respectively). Kinetic analysis of single-channel events within bursts revealed similar mean open and closed times for the main conductance and the 20.2-pS subconductance state, resulting in open probabilities of 44.6 and 42.7%, respectively. The ratio of open to closed times, however, was significantly different for the 10.8-pS subconductance state with an open probability of 57.2%.", 
    "104": "The effects of taurine, an inhibitory amino acid, on the behavior of male mice were examined in the elevated plus-maze test of anxiety. Acute taurine treatment (60 mg/kg, PO) significantly increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms. Moreover, when taurine was administered daily for seven days and the plus-maze test was conducted 40 minutes after the last administration, a significant increase of the percentage of time in the open arms was observed even at dose of 2.5 mg/kg, however the open arm entries and the total entries were unaffected at any dose tested. In order to get a comprehensive profile of drug action, detailed behavioral analyses were further exerted. Single administration of 60 mg/kg taurine can significantly reduce the total rears. The results suggest that taurine have some anxiolytic-like properties, although its effects seem more limited and are not consistent with those presented by classic anxiolytics, such as diazepam.", 
    "105": "Clobazam (Castillium, Urbanil), a benzodiazepine often used as an anxiolytic and in the treatment of epilepsy, is considered a relatively safe drug. The authors present a fatal case with a 49-year-old female, found dead at home. She had been undergoing psychiatric treatment and was a chronic alcoholic. The autopsy findings were unremarkable, except for multivisceral congestion, steatosis and a small piece of a plastic blister pack in the stomach. Bronchopneumonia, bronchitis and bronchiolitis were also diagnosed. Anhigh-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/diode array detector (DAD)/mass spectrometry detection (MSD) with electrospray method was developed in order to detect, confirm and quantify clobazam in the post-mortem samples. In the chromatographic separation, a reversed-phase column C18 (2.1 x 150 mm, 3.5 microm) was used with a mobile phase of methanol and water, at a 0.25 ml/min flow rate. Carbonate buffer (pH 10.5) and 20 microl of prazepam (100 microg/ml) as internal standard were added to the samples. A simple and reliable liquid-liquid extraction method for the determination of clobazam in post-mortem samples was described. Calibration curves for clobazam were performed in blood, achieving linearity between 0.01 and 10 microg/ml and a detection limit of 1.0 ng/ml. The clobazam concentration found in post-mortem blood was 3.9 microg/ml, higher than the reported therapeutic concentration (0.1-0.4 microg/ml). The simultaneous acquisition by photodiode array detection and mass spectrometry detection results allowed benzodiazepines to be identified with sufficient certainty. An examination of all the available information suggested that death resulted from respiratory depression due to clobazam toxicity.",

The Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor has been validated as an objective measure of depth of anaesthesia. We studied the BIS monitor for this role in procedural sedation.", 
    "107": "A prospective, observational study with convenience sampling of adult patients in ED who underwent procedural sedation. Patients were treated according to standard practice and sedated as determined by the treating physician. Treating physicians were blinded to the BIS value. BIS values were recorded and compared to the Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale (OAAS). Upon recovery, patients were asked about recall of events while they were sedated.", 
    "108": "Twelve patients were enrolled and 110 paired readings from 11 patients (7 male) were obtained. It was not possible to obtain readings from one patient. The mean age was 58 years (range 20-94). The Spearman correlation between BIS and OAAS was 0.027 (95% CI -0.582-0.617). For the three patients who received propofol, the correlation was 1.0. There were no episodes of explicit recall of events during the period of sedation.", 
    "109": "BIS monitoring is feasible in the ED. Our small study suggests that there is a poor correlation between BIS values and the OAAS scale. Larger studies are required to further explore this relationship.

    "110": "A pharmacophore represents the 3D arrangement of chemical features that are shared by molecules exhibiting activity at a protein receptor. Pharmacophores are routinely used in 3D database searching for identifying potential lead compounds. The lack of shape constraints causes the query to identify compounds that could not fit into the active site. In the absence of structural information, a receptor surface model (RSM) can be used to represent the active site. The RSM consists of a surface that envelops a set of known actives after these have been aligned using their common features. When used for database searching, a RSM is overconstraining as it restricts access to regions that could be occupied by ligands, such as the solvent-protein interface or unexplored pockets. We describe a protocol for developing pruned RSMs using information gleaned from 3D quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models. We examined the performance of queries that consist of pharmacophores used alone or with pruned or unpruned RSMs by performing searches on six databases containing known actives distributed among inactives. The pruned RSMs yield an average selectivity 1.8 times greater than that for pharmacophore queries, compared to 1.6 times for unpruned RSMs. However, the pruned RSMs retrieve on average 73% of the actives identified using the pharmacophores, compared to 40% for the unpruned RSMs. As such, pruned RSMs represent a useful compromise between the high sensitivity of pharmacophores and the high selectivity of unpruned RSMs.", 
    "111": "The diagnosis of functional abdominal pain should be made based on the Rome II symptom criteria with only limited testing to exclude other disease. During physical examination the clinician may look for evidence of pain behavior which would be supportive of the diagnosis. Reassurance and proper education regarding the clinical entity of functional abdominal pain is critical for successful treatment and good patient satisfaction. Education should include validation that symptoms are real, and that other individuals experience similar symptoms. No further treatment may be required for those with mild symptoms. For patients with more severe symptoms, a long-term management plan of either pharmacological or psychological treatments is warranted. This will require a commitment by both the patient and the physician to engage in a partnership with active involvement and responsibility by both individuals. The goal of treatment--to decrease pain and increase function over time, not to cure the disorder-- should be explained. Strong consideration should be made for the use of an antidepressant to treat analgesic effects. Tricyclic antidepressants are the mainstay of therapy for functional pain disorders. The analgesic effect is generally quicker in onset and occurs at a lower dose than their effect on mood. To maximize patient compliance, patients should be told the rationale behind their use, warned of the potential side effects, and reassured that many of the side effects will disappear with time. Choice of an antidepressant should be based on the presence of concomitant symptoms (eg, depression), cost, and physician familiarity with specific agents. All patients with functional abdominal pain should be screened for underlying psychiatric disturbance as an untreated mood disorder will adversely affect response to treatment. If a concurrent mood disorder is found, it should be treated by either using a higher dose of the tricyclic antidepressant or by adding another antidepressant agent. Psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy may be important as adjuvant therapy or as an alternative to treatment with antidepressants for those patients who find antidepressants ineffective or are intolerant to them. Narcotics and benzodiazepines should not be used to treat chronic abdominal pain due to the high risk of physical and psychological dependence.",

An additional 28 participants having received a BZ the night previous to the study were pooled with the previously analysed 23 (with no additional BZ). These pooled results showed that PAN is superior to a BZ regimen at P = .05 level, despite additional BZs. Our work provides further support for previous findings that show that PAN is a safe, rapid, and effective therapy for acute mild to moderately severe withdrawal states.", 
    "113": "The aims of the present study were to assess changes in psychopathology and quality of life after withdrawal treatment in participants with benzodiazepine dependence that was in most cases complicated by harmful and hazardous alcohol use or high benzodiazepine doses. Seventy-six participants with benzodiazepine dependence (DSM-III-R) who participated in a randomized clinical trial of two different gradual withdrawal treatment approaches were initially assessed by Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90), visual analogue scales (VASs), and the Health-Related Quality of Life battery (HRQOL). The assessments were repeated after treatment ended and again after a follow-up averaging 11 months. During the study, all measurements for the participants with clinically significant (over 50%) benzodiazepine-dose decreases improved more than those for the participants with smaller decreases, and differences in the HRQOL energy/vitality, home management, and life satisfaction scores were significant. Our data indicate that in participants with complicated benzodiazepine dependence, clinically significant dose decreases are associated with improvements in their self-rated quality of life.",

The rate of polypharmacy was 41.9%, with 27.8% of patients receiving two drugs, 9.1% receiving three, 3.2% receiving four, and 1.8% of the patients receiving five or more psychotropic drugs. Multiple regression analysis shows that variables sex and diagnosis have a predictive value with regard to the number of psychotropic drug used, being men and schizophrenic patients the most predisposed. Benzodiazepines were the more prevalent drugs in monotherapy, while anticonvulsants and antipsychotics were the more used in combination with other treatment. A questionable very high degree of same-class polypharmacy was evidenced, while multi-class, adjunctive and augmentation polypharmacy seem to be more appropriate.",

Caudal block was performed after induction of anaesthesia with 2-5% sevoflurane, atropine 10 microg/kg and midazolam 100-300 microg/kg. During the surgical procedure, patients were maintained under spontaneous ventilation and no intravenous or inhalatory anaesthetic agent was administered. For transoperative sedation, midazolam 100-300 microg/kg was administered every 0.5-1.0 h. Transoperative cardiovascular response, postoperative analgesia and local and systemic complications were evaluated. 3. Groups were similar (P > 0.05) in sex, age, weight and in the time elapsed from caudal block to the beginning of the surgical procedure. The surgical time was significantly lower in the ropivacaine 0.25% group. The duration of analgesia was 24 h with ropivacaine 0.25% and approximately 10 h in the other four groups (P < 0.001). Linear regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between the postoperative analgesic period produced by ropivacaine and the surgical time (r = -0.48, two-sided P = 0.002). Systolic and diastolic blood pressures remained in the physiologically normal range for the duration of the transoperative period. Vomiting was present in only one patient receiving ropivacaine 0.50%. 4. In children, the duration of analgesia produced by caudal block with ropivacaine may be affected by surgical time. At surgical times of 0.5-1 h, ropivacaine 0.25% produced at least 24 h postoperative analgesia. At similar surgical times, ropivacaine 0.32%, 0.40% and 0.50% produced similar analgesic times to bupivacaine 0.25%.",

J. Physiol., Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 276 (1999) R1623; Am. J. Physiol., Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 277 (1999) R1144]. Gastric preloads of saline or peptone, or sham preloads were given 5 min before a 30-min, independent ingestion test in which pups had access to a sweet, high-fat milk diet. Preloads of isotonic peptone reduced intake significantly more than preloads of isotonic saline on postnatal day (P) 18, but not on P12. Pretreatment with the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide (600 microg/kg ip) did not change the inhibitory effect of isotonic peptone. Thus, the inhibitory effect of peptone on P18 was apparently not mediated by endogenous CCK acting at CCKA receptors. In contrast to isotonic peptone, preloads of hypertonic peptone did not decrease intake more than preloads of hypertonic saline on P12, P18, or P24. We conclude that if the isotonic peptone used in these experiments is an adequate model of the digestion products of dietary protein at these postnatal ages, then the postingestive inhibitory control of intake by digestion products of dietary protein during independent ingestion appears between P13 and P18.", 
    "125": "A pregnant woman who was a regular user of anxiolytics was admitted to the maternity ward at 38 weeks and 4 days amenorrhea after a massive overdose of clorazepate dipotassium, a benzodiazepine. The exact quantity ingested was undetermined. The infant, born at 39 weeks, presented no spontaneous breathing and tracheal intubation was necessary in the delivery room. The neonatal blood concentrations of the clorazepate metabolites were very high at delivery (26 mg/l nordiazepam and 3.5 mg/l oxazepam) and showed little change over the next 5 days (16 mg/l nordiazepam and 2.1 mg/l oxazepam, with an apparent half-life of 168 h for nordiazepam and 160 h for oxazepam). By day 6, the infant was still dependent on ventilator support and enterodialysis was begun with repeated doses of activated charcoal (1 g/kg every 6 h by gastric tube). Treatment was continued for 5 days and a spectacular diminution in the serum concentrations of the two metabolites was noted on day 11: 1.5 mg/l nordiazepam and less than 0.1 mg/l oxazepam. The nordiazepam and oxazepam half-lifes were reduced to 42 h and 30 h respectively. The concomitant clinical improvement authorized the weaning from ventilation on day 12.",

    "127": "Most patients using hypnotics are ambulatory and presumably have a job and drive a car. Since driving a car is one of the most common but potentially dangerous daily activities, hypnotics should act rapidly when needed, but daytime sleepiness and other residual effects that may impair performance are unwanted. This review summarizes the effects of hypnotics on driving ability as determined with the on-the-road driving test during normal traffic. Supportive evidence from epidemiological data, and results from driving simulators and closed-road studies are also considered. On-the-road studies revealed that benzodiazepine hypnotics significantly impaired driving ability the morning following bedtime administration. Impairment was sometimes also significant in the afternoon (16-17 h after administration). Similar driving impairment was observed with zopiclone. However, the magnitude of impairment depends on various factors including the half-life and dosage of the drug, and the time after administration. The results from on-the-road driving studies are supported by evidence obtained in driving simulators and laboratory tests. Epidemiological data and on-the-road studies show that tolerance develops to the impairing effects of hypnotics. However, this is a slow process, and impairment may persist. Patients treated with benzodiazepine hypnotics or zopiclone should be cautioned when driving a car. Both zolpidem and zaleplon do not significantly affect driving performance the morning following bedtime administration. Middle-of-the-night administration of zolpidem significantly impairs driving ability in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, zaleplon did not affect driving ability 4 h after middle-of-the-night administration.", 
    "128": "Pentobarbitone-induced hypnosis test was used as an animal model to explore the role of BR-16A, a polyherbal formulation in sleep. Pentobarbitone produces quick sleep latency (onset) and prolongation of total sleep time (duration). Sleep latency and total sleep time were used as a parameters for the evaluation. BR-16A potentiated the effect of triazolam (0.1 mg/kg, ip) and alprazolam (0.25 mg/kg, ip). Melatonin (5.0 mg/kg, ip) and zolpidem (0.5 mg/kg, ip) did not produce any significant effect on sleep parameters. However, alprazolam (0.25mg/kg, ip) potentiated the effect of BR-16A (100 mg/ kg, po) in higher dose only. Sleep promoting effect of BR-16A in combination with GABAergic drugs (triazolam and alprazolam,) suggested that these drugs have common mechanism in sleep promoting effect of pentobarbitone and could be used along with other GABAergic hypnotics for the treatment of insomnia. This may reduce the dose of the latter drug(s). BR-16A can be used for the treatment of sleep and sleep-related disorders.", 
    "129": "(1) The intramuscular neuroleptic of choice for the treatment of agitated schizophrenic patients and patients with acute mania is haloperidol, at a dose of 5 mg. Olanzapine is now marketed in France for hospital use in both these indications. (2) In two comparative trials in patients with schizophrenia, olanzapine 10 mg was shown to be no better than haloperidol 7.5 mg (a high dose). Control of agitation was satisfactory in three-quarters of patients after a single injection of either neuroleptic. (3) Olanzapine has not been compared with other neuroleptics in the treatment of acute mania. In one trial, olanzapine acted faster than lorazepam for injection (used at a rather low dose). (4) In one trial, patients given olanzapine had a lower incidence of acute dystonia and extrapyramidal symptoms (about 1%) than patients given haloperidol (about 6-7%), but the haloperidol dose (7.5 mg) was higher than recommended in the SPC (5 mg). The incidence of postural hypotension was significantly higher among patients given olanzapine (about 12%) compared with haloperidol (about 3%). (5) In practice, haloperidol remains the intramuscular neuroleptic of choice for the treatment of agitated patients with schizophrenia or acute mania.", 
    "130": "In six healthy rams possessing seven bipolar electrodes sewn onto the antrum and entire small intestine, the myoelectric activity recordings were performed in order to further elucidate the problem of possible contribution of cholinergic system in the control of slow wave amplitude and frequency. Experiments were carried out in fasted and non-fasted animals before and after feeding and intravenous cholinergic drug administration during phase 2b of the migrating myoelectric complex (MMC) (carbachol) and during phase 1-2a MMC (hexamethonium, atropine and pirenzepine). Antral slow wave amplitude was unaltered by cholinergic drugs with some exceptions. Small intestinal slow wave amplitude (principally examined in the jejunum) was also unchanged. Antral slow wave frequency was mostly unchanged with an increasing tendency but in some of experimental groups the results were statistically significant. Small intestinal slow wave frequency was diminished by carbachol and was partially increased (mostly increasing tendency) by the anticholinergic drugs. Thus, it is concluded that the cholinergic system can affect slow wave frequency in ovine antrum as well as in the small intestine in various phases of the MMC.",

In the present experiment, 6 healthy humans learned to discriminate 15-mg oral D-amphetamine. After acquiring the discrimination (ie, . > or = 80% correct responding on 4 consecutive days), the effects of a range of doses of D-amphetamine (0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 mg), alone and following pretreatment with alprazolam (0 and 0.5 mg), a GABAA receptor modulator, were assessed. D-Amphetamine alone functioned as a discriminative stimulus and produced stimulant-like self-reported drug effects (eg, increased scores on a Stimulant-Sensitive Adjective-Rating Scale). These effects were generally a function of dose. Alprazolam alone did not occasion D-amphetamine-like discriminative stimulus effects, nor did it increase ratings of sedation or impair performance. Alprazolam pretreatment significantly attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of D-amphetamine, and some of the self-reported drug effects. Future human laboratory experiments should compare the behavioral effects of D-amphetamine alone and following pretreatment with alprazolam using other behavioral arrangements such as drug self-administration. Future laboratory experiments with humans should also determine if benzodiazepines with lower abuse potential (eg, oxazepam) might also attenuate the behavioral effects of D-amphetamine.",

The primary outcome measure was the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total score. For trial 1, endpoint improvement for the OLZ group (-14.9) was not significantly different from the PLA or OFC groups. The OFC group had significantly greater endpoint improvement (-20.9) than the PLA group (-10.4, P = 0.001); this significant difference was present within 7 days of therapy and maintained at every subsequent visit. The OFC group also had significantly higher response rate (63.6%) than the PLA (28.0%, P = 0.004) or OLZ (34.9%, P = 0.027) groups. For trial 2, there were no significant differences among treatment groups on the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale total scores or response rates. The combination exhibited a comparable safety profile with OLZ monotherapy and no significant increases in extrapyramidal symptoms compared with placebo. Patients with major depression with psychotic features treated with OLZ monotherapy did not demonstrate significant depressive symptom improvement compared with placebo in either trial; however, an olanzapine/fluoxetine combination was associated with significant improvement compared with placebo in one trial and was well tolerated.",

After chemical synthesis, hispidulin was investigated at recombinant GABA(A)/BZD receptors expressed by Xenopus laevis oocytes. Concentrations of 50 nm and higher stimulated the GABA-induced chloride currents at tested receptor subtypes (alpha(1-3,5,6)beta(2)gamma(2)S) indicating positive allosteric properties. Maximal stimulation at alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)S was observed with 10 microm hispidulin. In contrast to diazepam, hispidulin modulated the alpha(6)beta(2)gamma(2)S-GABA(A) receptor subtype. When fed to seizure-prone Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus) in a model of epilepsy, hispidulin (10 mg kg(-1) body weight (BW) per day) and diazepam (2 mg kg(-1) BW per day) markedly reduced the number of animals suffering from seizures after 7 days of treatment (30 and 25% of animals in the respective treatment groups, vs 80% in the vehicle group). Permeability across the blood-brain barrier for the chemically synthesized, (14)C-labelled hispidulin was confirmed by a rat in situ perfusion model. With an uptake rate (K(in)) of 1.14 ml min(-1) g(-1), measurements approached the values obtained with highly penetrating compounds such as diazepam. Experiments with Caco-2 cells predict that orally administered hispidulin enters circulation in its intact form.
