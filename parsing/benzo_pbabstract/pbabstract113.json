The number of deaths, age, sex, place of death, main intoxicant, and other drugs present in blood samples were recorded to obtain national and comparable Nordic data, as well as data to compare with earlier studies in 2002, 1997, and 1991. Norway had the highest incidence of drug addict deaths by poisoning followed by Denmark, with 8.24 and 6.92 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. The death rates in Finland (4.02), Iceland (4.56), and Sweden (3.53) were about half that of Norway and Denmark. Compared with earlier studies, the death rates were unchanged in Denmark and Norway, but increased in Finland, Iceland, and Sweden. In all countries, fewer deaths (29-35%) were recorded in the capital area compared with earlier studies. Females accounted for 11-19% of the fatal poisonings. Iceland deviates with a more equal distribution between men and women (40%). Deaths from methadone overdoses increased in all Nordic countries, and methadone was the main intoxicant in Denmark in 2007, accounting for 51% of the poisonings. In Norway and Sweden, heroin/morphine was still the main intoxicant with a frequency of 68% and 48%, respectively. In Iceland, 3 deaths each were due to heroin/morphine and methadone, respectively. Finland differs from other Nordic countries in having a high number of poisonings caused by buprenorphine and very few caused by heroin/morphine. The total number of buprenorphine deaths in Finland doubled from 16 in 2002 to 32 in 2007, where it constituted 25% of deaths. The general toxicological screening program showed widespread multi-drug use in all countries. The median number of drugs per case varied from 3 to 5. The most frequently detected substances were heroin/morphine, methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, amphetamine, cocaine, tetrahydrocannabinol, benzodiazepines and ethanol.", 
    "1": "The global problem of acute poisoning has steadily increased over the past few years. It is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Better preventive and management strategies can be developed if the incidence and pattern of acute poisoning is known. The study aims at analyzing the pattern, cause and mortality rate of poisoning. The study was conducted in a rural area in South India. This retrospective study was conducted from January 2003-December 2003. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics. Out of the 225 cases 139 were males and 86 females. Poisoning was common in the age group of 21-30 years which was 84 cases and 11-20 years was 73 cases. The poisons consumed were as follows: Organophosphorous 135 cases, aluminum and zinc phosphide 50 cases, phenobarbitone 18 cases, benzodiazepines 7 cases, paracetamol 2 cases, miscellaneous 13 cases. 94% were suicides and 6% accidental. Mortality rate was 12.8%. Establishment of strict policies against the sale and availability of pesticides and over the counter drugs is an effective way to control organophosphorous and drug poisoning.", 
    "2": "In an examination of the effect of benzodiazepines on brain chemistry, 44 healthy controls underwent a short echo-time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) session after induced sedation with intravenous midazolam (0.03mg/kg) plus fentanyl (2\u03bcg/kg). The regions of interest were the anterior cingulate cortex, right basal ganglia, right frontal lobe, and right hippocampus. Twenty-five of these subjects underwent the second (1)H MRS session while awake. The measured (1)H MRS metabolites included N-acetyl-aspartate, creatine-containing compounds (PCr+Cr), choline-containing compounds, myo-inositol, and glutamate plus glutamine, which were quantified both as absolute values and metabolite/PCr+Cr ratios. The results were analyzed using independent group t tests and repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA, with alpha values set at 0.025 to minimize the risk of false-positive findings arising from multiple comparisons. No significant difference between subjects under midazolam plus fentanyl induced sedation and awake could be detected with unpaired analyses. Paired comparisons by ANOVA with repeated measures found that neither drug (midazolam plus fentanyl) nor the drug by time (interval between two scan times) interaction had a significant effect on the quantified metabolites. These findings encourage utilization of benzodiazepine-induced brief sedation during in vivo (1)H MRS experiments of the brain, and may help with elucidation of state-dependent neurochemical alterations during the course of bipolar and schizoaffective disorders.",

The study sample consisted of 300 girls and 208 boys (age 12-17) admitted to psychiatric inpatient hospital between April 2001 and March 2006. The information on drug therapy history and psychiatric diagnoses were obtained from the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School Aged Children-Present and Lifetime (K-SADS-PL). Adolescents with drug use disorders had elevated rates of pre-hospitalization prescribed benzodiazepines (BZDs). Antidepressants and antipsychotics were mainly used by depressed and psychotic adolescents. Previously prescribed BZD medication was associated with 3-fold increased rates of sedative abuse or dependence. Girls had been prescribed antidepressants and BZDs statistically significantly more commonly than boys. The results of our study underline the importance of careful consideration of the use of benzodiazepines, especially in the outpatient treatment of adolescents.", 
    "4": "Key developments in GABA pharmacology over the last 30 years are reviewed with special reference to the advances pioneered by Erminio Costa. His passion for innovative science, and his quest for novel therapies for psychiatric disorders are particularly apparent in his fundamental contributions to the field of GABA research, with a focus on anxiety disorders and schizophrenia. He was a cofounder of the GABAergic mechanism of action of benzodiazepines. He envisaged partial agonists as novel anxiolytics. He identified DBI (diazepam binding inhibitor) as endogenous agonist of neurosteroidogenesis with multiple CNS effects and he pointed to the developmental origin of GABAergic dysfunctions in schizophrenia through his discovery of a reelin deficit, all this in collaboration with Sandro Guidotti. Today, the GABA pharmacology comprises selective hypnotics, non-sedative anxiolytics, memory enhancers and powerful analgesics.

Mothers who contacted Beilinson Teratology Information Service regarding use of olanzapine while breastfeeding were followed by phone interview. Data on lactation, neonatal symptoms, and outcome at the age of 1-2 years were obtained. Mother-infant groups were compared. Mothers breastfeeding while taking olanzapine (n\u2009=\u200922) were compared to two control groups of mothers who continued to take olanzapine but did not breastfeed (n\u2009=\u200915) and to breastfeeding mothers using a drug known to be safe during lactation (n\u2009=\u200951).",

The rate of adverse outcomes in olanzapine-exposed breastfed infants did not differ from those of the control groups. Among the 30 newborns exposed in utero to olanzapine, no congenital birth defects were found. Neonatal symptoms were seen in six of 30 of olanzapine-exposed infants versus two of 51 of nonexposed infants (p\u2009<\u20090.05). A withdrawal syndrome was seen in three of 30 (10%) infants.",

The aim of the present study was to examine if pregabalin reduced the intake of benzodiazepines. In a pharmacoepidemiological study, we compared pregabalin to the older drug gabapentin (Neurontin(\u00ae) ) in the Norwegian Prescription Database. The database has total capture of all prescribed drugs outside institutions. We identified all prescriptions for the two drugs for patients aged 18-69 years between 2004 and 2007. Patients were grouped as psychiatric patients, patients with epilepsy, patients with neuropathic pain or non-specified users. We measured the use of benzodiazepines 182 days before and after the initiation of treatment with pregabalin and gabapentin. Between 15% and 29% of the patients were able to stop using benzodiazepines after starting pregabalin or gabapentin treatment. Psychiatric patients who started pregabalin were able to reduce the amount of benzodiazepines used by 48%, compared to only 14% among starters of gabapentin. This study shows that some patients reduced their use of benzodiazepines substantially after starting pregabalin.", 
    "19": "Echinacea preparations are traditionally used to treat upper respiratory infections and inflammations. No psychotropic effects of Echinacea have been reported so far, although some recently reported active constituents are behaviorally active. Prompted by these findings, the anxiolytic potential of five different Echinacea preparations was evaluated. Three of these decreased anxiety but two of them had a very narrow effective dose range. Only one extract decreased anxiety within a wide dose-range (3-8 mg/kg). Anxiolytic effects were consistently seen in three different tests of anxiety, the elevated plus-maze, social interaction and shock-induced social avoidance tests. No locomotor suppressant effects were seen at any dose. Noteworthy, the doses that showed anxiolytic effects in the present study were much lower than those used in the laboratory models of the traditional indications. Chlordiazepoxide robustly decreased anxiety-like behavior in all tests but suppressed locomotion at higher doses. Perceived and real risks of conventional medications increase the demand for alternative therapies, provided that these are safe and efficient. Earlier evidence shows that Echinacea preparations have an excellent safety profile, while our findings suggest for the first time that certain preparations have a considerable anxiolytic potential. Further research is required to identify factors that differentiate efficient and inefficient preparations.",

Children and adults with SMS appear to have unique neurobehavioral problems that include: sleep disturbance, self-injurious and maladaptive behaviors, stereotypies, and sensory integration disorders. We gathered retrospective psychotropic use information from parents or other caregivers of 62 individuals with SMS who were asked about use of psychotropic medication from a list of commonly used psychiatric medications. For those drugs identified, respondents were asked to rate the experience with the particular medication using a likert-type scale. Drugs were grouped into seven main categories: (1) stimulants; (2) antidepressants; (3) antipsychotics; (4) sleep aides; (5) mood stabilizers; (6) alpha 2 agonists; and (7) benzodiazepines. Relative frequencies, means and standard deviations pertaining to age and medication effect were derived for each medication category. Six of the seven medication categories examined showed no meaningful deviations from the \"no change\" score. The benzodiazepine group showed a mild detrimental effect. There were no gender differences in efficacy. Use of psychotropic medication started early in life (mean age 5 years), particularly with sleep aides. Although no medication category was identified as efficacious in SMS, all the categories reported herein may be considered as an option for brief symptomatic relief.", 
    "29": "The relevance of the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) concept to medically ill patients is becoming increasingly clear. Some medical conditions (e.g., rheumatologic diseases) are likely related to PTSD indirectly. Others, such as myocardial infarction and critical illness/intensive care unit (ICU) treatment, are likely traumatic stressors. Importantly, PTSD seems to be a potent risk factor for fatal and nonfatal cardiac events. Risk factors for medical illness-related PTSD appear similar to risk factors for PTSD in general. PTSD is particularly common among survivors of critical illness and ICU treatment. Further research is needed to determine how specific ICU interventions (e.g., administration of benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, and catecholamines) affect PTSD risk. In the meantime, given the negative impact of PTSD on patients' quality of life, it is important for psychiatrists and other clinicians to be aware of the syndrome in survivors of critical illness so as to ensure that such patients receive the care that they deserve.",

Spontaneous miniature inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs and EPSCs) and stimulus-evoked eIPSCs and eEPSCs were recorded in addition to the effect of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam or the inverse agonist FG 7142 on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic eIPSCs.", 
    "33": "Evoked EPSC amplitude was greater in 1AKOs than WTs. When subjects were pooled across genotypes, anxiety measures correlated with eEPSC amplitude, indicating enhanced postsynaptic glutamate synaptic activity under conditions of synaptic activation in anxious subjects. While GABA synaptic activity and sensitivity to diazepam were not affected by genotype or correlated with anxiety, sensitivity to the anxiogenic FG 7142 was smaller in anxious subjects.",

    "35": "Accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) and loss of synapses are hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). How synaptic activity relates to A\u03b2 accumulation and loss of synapses is a current topic of major interest. Synaptic activation promotes A\u03b2 secretion, and chronic reduction of synaptic activity reduced A\u03b2 plaques in an AD transgenic mouse model. This suggested beneficial effects of reducing synaptic activity in AD. We now show that reduced synaptic activity causes detrimental effects on synapses and memory despite reducing plaques using two different models of chronic synaptic inhibition: deafferentation of the barrel cortex and administration of benzodiazepine. An interval of prolonged synaptic inhibition exacerbated loss of synaptophysin compared with synaptically more active brain in AD transgenic but not wild-type mice. Furthermore, an interval of benzodiazepine treatment, followed by a washout period, exacerbated memory impairment in AD transgenic mice. Exacerbation of synaptic and behavioral abnormalities occurred in the setting of reduced A\u03b2 plaques but elevated intraneuronal A\u03b2 immunoreactivity. These data support beneficial effects of synaptic activation on A\u03b2-related synaptic and behavioral impairment in AD.", 
    "36": "Positive modulators at benzodiazepine sites of \u03b12- and \u03b13-containing GABA(A) receptors are believed to be anxiolytic. Negative allosteric modulators of \u03b15-containing GABA(A) receptors enhance cognition. By oocyte two-electrode voltage clamp and subsequent structure-activity relationship studies, we discovered cinnoline and quinoline derivatives that were both positive modulators at \u03b12-/\u03b13-containing GABA(A) receptors and negative modulators at \u03b15-containing GABA(A) receptors. In addition, these compounds showed no functional activity at \u03b11-containing GABA(A) receptors. Such dual functional modulators of GABA(A) receptors might be useful for treating comorbidity of anxiety and cognitive impairments in neurological and psychiatric illnesses.",

It is characterized by hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction and alteration in mental status. Here, we report a patient with severe NMS who was successfully treated with highdose lorazepam and diazepam. A 61-year-old man with bipolar I disorder was admitted to the hospital because of manic episodes. Fever, muscle rigidity, tachycardia, diaphoresis, elevated blood pressure and delirium occurred following intramuscular injection of haloperidol and NMS was diagnosed. Supportive treatment included hydration, alkalinized fluids and correction of abnormal electrolytes without the use of dantrolene, dopaminergic agents or electroconvulsive therapy. The Francis-Yacoub NMS rating scale was employed for evaluation of clinical improvement, and scores were 55 on the first day and 0 at discharge. The patient was followed up for 6 months and was free of NMS. In conclusion, this is the first report of rapid relief of NMS with high-dose lorazepam and diazepam in a Taiwanese patient.", 
    "38": "Z-360 is an orally active cholecystokinin-2 (CCK2)/gastrin receptor antagonist currently under development as a therapeutic drug for pancreatic cancer. It was previously reported that Z-360 treatment in combination with gemcitabine prolonged the survival period in a lethal pancreatic cancer xenograft model in mice. In a phase Ib/IIa clinical study, Z-360 treatment displayed a trend of reduced pain in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with gemcitabine including analgesics such as opioids. Here, we investigated the mechanism of analgesic action of Z-360 in a severe cancer-induced pain model in mice, which is considered to be opioid-resistant, by examining ephrin B1 gene expression, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit phosphorylation, and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) production.", 
    "39": "In a mouse model of cancer-induced pain, ephrin B1 gene expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the phosphorylation of NR2B in the spinal cord were induced. Z-360 treatment inhibited both ephrin B1 gene expression and the phosphorylation of NR2B. In addition, IL-1\u03b2 production increased in the cancer-inoculated hind paw of mice, but could be suppressed by treatment with Z-360. Moreover, we observed that the CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide similarly suppressed up-regulation of ephrin B1 gene expression and IL-1\u03b2 production, and that the intraperitoneal injection of sulfated CCK-8 induced the production of IL-1\u03b2 in the cancer-inoculated region.", 
    "40": "We have identified a novel pain cascade, in which IL-1\u03b2 production in cancer-inoculated regions induces ephrin B1 gene expression in DRGs and then ephrin B1 enhances the tyrosine phosphorylation of NR2B via Eph B receptor in the spinal cord. Notably, Z-360 relieves cancer-induced pain by preventing this pain cascade through the suppression of IL-1\u03b2 production, likely via the blockade of CCK1 receptor. The pre-clinical results presented here support the analgesic action of Z-360 in pancreatic cancer patients with severe, opioid-resistant pain. Pre-clinical and clinical results have demonstrated that Z-360 combined with gemcitabine represents a promising pancreatic cancer therapy approach with characteristic analgesic effects in addition to the prolongation of survival.", 
    "41": "Black cohosh (BC) has been widely applied for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. However, increasing concerns about herb-drug interactions demand the need for studies on the influence of BC on cytochrome 450. Cyp3a11 in liver was induced by 7-fold in wild-type mice treated with 500\u2009mg/kg black cohosh for 28 days compared with the control group as assessed by quantitative real-time PCR; no difference was found in small intestine and kidney, suggesting that up-regulation of Cyp3a11 by black cohosh was liver-specific. Western blot, activity assays, and pharmacokinetic analyses established dose- and time-dependent induction of Cyp3a11. To determine the mechanism of Cyp3a11 induction, including the role of pregnane X receptor (PXR) in vivo and in vitro, respectively, in Pxr-null, PXR-humanized, and double transgenic CYP3A4/hPXR mice, cell-based luciferase assays were employed revealing that mouse PXR played a direct role in the induction of Cyp3a11; human PXR was not activated by black cohosh. Overall, these findings demonstrate that induction of Cyp3a11 is liver-specific and involved only mouse PXR, not the human counterpart. Thus, the incidence of herb-drug interaction in patients administered black cohosh may not be mediated by human PXR and CYP3A4.",

    "46": "Standard care of burn wounds consists of cleaning and debridement (removing devitalized tissue), followed by daily dressing changes. Children with burns undergo multiple, painful and anxiety-provoking procedures during wound care and rehabilitation. The goal of procedural sedation is safe and efficacious management of pain and emotional distress, requiring a careful and systematic approach. Achieving the best results needs understanding of the mechanisms of pain and the physiologic changes in burn patients, frequent evaluation and assessment of pain and anxiety, and administration of suitable pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies. Pharmacological therapies provide the backbone of analgesia and sedation for procedural pain management. Opioids provide excellent pain control, but they must be administered judiciously due to their side effects. Sedative drugs, such as benzodiazepines and propofol, provide excellent sedation, but they must not be used as a substitute for analgesic drugs. Ketamine is increasingly used for analgesia and sedation in children as a single agent or an adjuvant. Nonpharmacological therapies such as virtual reality, relaxation, cartoon viewing, music, massage and hypnosis are necessary components of procedural sedation and analgesia for children. These can be combined with pharmacological techniques and are used to limit the use of drugs (and hence side effects), as well as to improve patient participation and satisfaction. In this article, we review the pathophysiologic changes associated with major thermal injury in children, the options available for sedation and analgesia for wound care procedures in these children and our institutional guidelines for procedural sedation.",

Simultaneously it is important to recognize and treat comorbid psychological disturbances such as in this case: depression, delusions with occasional psychotic reactions combined with unrealistic thinking about the layout of her own body. There is still no cure for the treatment of eating disorders which are in growing number of reports among male adolescents.", 
    "48": "Although sleep disturbance is common among the elderly, such elderly patients have been considered difficult to treat because the underlying mechanisms are complicated. However, these patients often exhibit adverse effects such as daytime somnolence, poor motor coordination, and an increased risk of falls. This article reviews the pathology, symptoms, and management of sleep disturbances in elderly patients. As a consequence of aging, elderly people exhibit alterations in the sleep architecture and sleep-wake rhythm. Many studies employing polysomnography have demonstrated a shortened total sleep time; decreases in sleep efficiency, and time spent in slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; and increases in nocturnal arousal and in the proportion of stage I sleep. Furthermore, these patients usually exhibit a multiple sleep-wake rhythm, and an advanced sleep phase. For the treatment of sleep disturbances in the elderly, it is necessary to perform appropriate multidimensional assessment of the patient, such as the assessment of psychosocial factors, as well as medications and diseases that may cause sleep disturbances. Benzodiazepine (BZP) hypnotics have been the primary treatments for sleep disturbances, and are effective and safe when prescribed within the recommended guidelines. Hypnotic drugs should be used carefully to avoid causing delirium, amnesia, and falls. There have also been reports demonstrateing the effectiveness and tolerability of non-BZP hypnotics, antidepressants with fewer anticholinergic effects, atypical neuroleptics, and herbal prescriptions. In addition to alterations in the sleep architecture and sleep-wake rhythm, several sleep disorders become more prevalent in the elderly. These late-life sleep disorders include periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), restless legs syndrome (RLS), and parasomnias such as REM sleep behavior disorder. As these disorders become more severe, it becomes more difficult to fall asleep and/or maintain sleep continuity, which results in a poorer subjective sleep quality. These disorders have a pathology distinct from those of primary insomnia, and require a different treatment strategy. Furthermore, these disorders are usually refractory to BZP hypnotics. Adequate evaluations and diagnoses are, therefore, essential for successful management.", 
    "49": "We investigated the antinociceptive and nerve excitability effects of the N-salicyloyltryptamine (NST) NST-treated mice exhibited a significant decrease in the number of writhes when 100 and 200\u2009mg/kg (i.p.) were administered (i.p.). This effect was not antagonized by naloxone (1.5\u2009mg/kg, i.p.). NST inhibited the licking response of the injected paw when 100 and 200\u2009mg/kg were administered (i.p.) to mice in the first and second phases of the formalin test. Because the antinociceptive effects could be associated with neuronal excitability inhibition, we performed the single sucrose gap technique and showed that NST (3.57\u2009mM) significantly reduced (29.2%) amplitude of the compound action potential (CAP) suggesting a sodium channel effect induced by NST. Our results demonstrated an antinociceptive activity of the NST that could be, at least in part, associated to the reduction of the action potential amplitude. NST might represent an important tool for pain management.",

Nonpregnant Japanese women (aged 22-54 years) undergoing myomectomy, hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, or oophorectomy were randomized to receive 1 of 2 different midazolam doses (50 or 75 \u03bcg/kg IV) or placebo immediately after induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg IV, and vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg IV was used to facilitate tracheal intubation. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane 1.0% to 3.0% (inspired concentration) and air in oxygen. All episodes of PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia were assessed by an investigator 24 hours postoperatively; the investigator was blinded as to which treatment each patient had received. The patients were asked if nausea, vomiting, or retching had occurred. Details were recorded of any other AEs, as well as any spontaneous complaints.",

Each study group comprised 30 patients and was comparable with regard to patient demographic characteristics and types of surgery. The rate of patients experiencing PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia with midazolam 50 \u03bcg/kg was 30% (P = 0.004 vs placebo) compared with 27% with midazolam 75 \u03bcg/kg (P = 0.002 vs placebo) and 67% with placebo. The difference in the incidence of PONV between patients receiving midazolam 75 \u03bcg/kg and those receiving midazolam 50 \u03bcg/kg was not statistically significant. No clinically important AEs due to the study drug were observed in any of the groups.", 
    "54": "Midazolam 50 \u03bcg/kg was not significantly different from midazolam 75 \u03bcg/kg in the incidence of PONV, and both doses were associated with significantly less PONV compared with placebo during the first 24 hours after anesthesia in these Japanese women undergoing laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.", 
    "55": "Neuroactive steroids might be therapeutic alternatives for benzodiazepines because they have similar anxiolytic, sedative, and anticonvulsant effects, and their actions at different modulatory sites on \u03b3-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptors might confer differences in adverse effects.",

Pentobarbital produced \u2265 80% drug-lever responding in all rats discriminating pregnanolone, and in 1/3 of the rats discriminating midazolam with larger doses decreasing response rates to <20% of control. Morphine and ketamine produced predominantly saline-lever responding in both groups. Flumazenil antagonized midazolam and flunitrazepam in both groups; slopes of Schild plots were not different from unity, and pA (2) values for flumazenil ranged from 5.86 to 6.09. Flumazenil did not attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects of pregnanolone.", 
    "59": "The midazolam and pregnanolone discriminative stimuli were qualitatively similar, although the effects of pentobarbital were not identical in the two groups. Although acute effects of midazolam and pregnanolone are similar, suggesting that neuroactive steroids might retain the therapeutic effects of benzodiazepines, differences emerge during chronic treatment, indicating that neuroactive steroids might produce fewer adverse effects than benzodiazepines.",

Video/EEG recordings during two different migraine attacks, with an interval of 6months from each other, showed, in both recordings, subsequent ictal discharges over the affected and disconnected hemisphere. Migraine and ictal discharges in both occasion disappeared with diazepam i.v. The EEGs performed during migraine-free period, on the contrary, showed very rare and mild subclinical ictal discharges. Although a casual relationship could not be excluded, a pure neuronal pathogenetic mechanism can be suggested, mediated by post- and inter-ictal cortical depression.", 
    "61": "A growing body of evidence has indicated that energy metabolism impairment may be involved in pathophysiology of some neuropsychiatric disorders. In this study, we evaluated the effect of acute and chronic administration of fluoxetine, olanzapine and the combination of fluoxetine/olanzapine on citrate synthase activity in brain of rats. For acute treatment, Wistar rats received one single injection of olanzapine (3 or 6mg/kg) and/or fluoxetine (12.5 or 25mg/kg). For chronic treatment, rats received daily injections of olanzapine (3 or 6mg/kg) and/or fluoxetine (12.5 or 25mg/kg) for 28 days. In the present study we observed that acute administration of olanzapine inhibited citrate synthase activity in cerebellum and prefrontal cortex. The acute administration of olanzapine increased citrate synthase activity in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum and fluoxetine increased citrate synthase activity in striatum. Olanzapine 3mg/kg and fluoxetine 12.5mg/kg in combination increased citrate synthase activity in prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum. In the chronic treatment we did not observed any effect on citrate synthase activity. Our results showed that olanzapine and fluoxetine increased citrate synthase activity after acute, but not chronic treatment.", 
    "62": "Mutations in the CLN3 gene cause juvenile Batten disease, a fatal pediatric neurodegenerative disorder. The Cln3-knockout (Cln3(\u0394ex1-6)) mouse model of the disease displays many pathological characteristics of the human disorder including a deficit in motor coordination. We have previously found that attenuation of \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor activity in one-month-old Cln3(\u0394ex1-6) mice resulted in an immediate improvement of their motor skills. Here we show that at a later stage of the disease, in 6-7-month-old Cln3(\u0394ex1-6) mice, acute inhibition of AMPA receptors by a single intraperitoneal injection (1mg/kg) of the non-competitive AMPA antagonist, EGIS-8332, does not have an immediate effect. Instead, it induces a delayed but prolonged improvement of motor skills. Four days after the injection of the AMPA antagonist, Cln3(\u0394ex1-6) mice reached the same motor skill level as their wild type (WT) counterparts, an improvement that persisted for an additional four days. EGIS-8332 was rapidly eliminated from the brain as measured by HPLC-MS/MS. Histological analysis performed 8 days after the drug administration revealed that EGIS-8332 did not have any impact upon glial activation or the survival of vulnerable neuron populations in 7-month-old Cln3(\u0394ex1-6) mice. We propose that temporary inhibition of AMPA receptors can induce a prolonged correction of the pre-existing abnormal glutamatergic neurotransmission in vivo for juvenile Batten disease.",

Especially the compounds bearing a para-pyridine consistently showed in vivo activity in rat behavioral models after oral administration, for example, blockade of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY354740-induced hypoactivity and improvement of a working memory deficit induced either by LY354740 or scopolamine in the delayed match to position task (DMTP).

    "68": "Tofisopam is a member of the 2,3-benzodiazepine compound family which is marketed for the treatment of anxiety in some European countries. In contrast to classical 1,4-benzodiazepines, the compound does not bind to the benzodiazepine binding site of the \u03b3-aminobutyric acid receptor and its psychopharmacological profile differs from such compounds. In addition to anxiolytic properties, antipsychotic effects are reported. We now show that tofisopam, 50\u00a0mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), administered in parallel to repeated doses of dizocilpine 0.2\u00a0mg/kg i.p. can ameliorate dizocilpine-induced prolongation of immobility, which is considered to be a model of negative symptoms of psychosis. We further show that tofisopam acts as an isoenzyme-selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) with highest affinity to PDE-4A1 (0.42\u00a0\u03bcM) followed by PDE-10A1 (0.92\u00a0\u03bcM), PDE-3 (1.98\u00a0\u03bcM) and PDE-2A3 (2.11\u00a0\u03bcM). The data indicate that tofisopam is an interesting candidate for the adjuvant treatment of psychosis with focus on negative symptoms. Combined partial inhibition of PDE-4 and PDE-10 as well as PDE-2 may be the underlying mechanism to this activity. Due to the good safety profile of tofisopam as evident from long-term use of this agent in patients, it may be concluded that dual or triple inhibition of PDE isoenzymes with additive or synergistic effects may be an interesting approach to pharmacological activity, resulting in active compounds with beneficial safety profile. Dose-limiting side effects such as emesis induced by selective inhibition of PDE-4 may be prevented by such strategies.", 
    "69": "Medication prescribing is a complex process where the focus tends to be on starting new medication, changing a drug regimen, and continuing a drug regimen. On occasion, a prudent approach to prescribing may necessitate ending an ongoing course of medication, either because it should not have been started in the first place; because its continued use would cause harm; or because the medication is no longer effective.",

Partially effective interventions included audit and feedback, electronic reminders, educational materials alone sent to prescribers, and distance communication combined with educational materials sent to prescribers.", 
    "74": "It appears possible to stop the prescribing of a variety of medications with a range of interventions. A common theme in effective interventions is the involvement of patients in the stopping process. However, prescribing at the level of individual patients was rarely reported, with data often aggregated to number of doses or number of drugs per unit population, attributing any reduction to cessation. Such studies are not measuring the actual required outcome (stopping prescribing), and this may reflect the broader ambiguity about when or why it might be important to end a prescription. Much more research is required into the process of stopping pre-existing prescribing, paying particular attention to improving the outcomes that are measured.",

The abilities of tanshinones to activate CYP3A-mediated midazolam 1-hydroxylation and testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation in human liver microsomes (HLMs) were tested. Substrate- and effector-dependent activation of CYP3A by tanshinones were both observed. Cryptotanshinone was shown to activate CYP3A-mediated midazolam 1-hydroxylation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, tanshinone IIA and tanshinone I did not activate this hydroxylation reaction. In addition, tanshinone IIA activated CYP3A-mediated testosterone 6\u03b2-hydroxylation, whereas cryptotanshinone and tanshinone I did not. The results from our study enhance the understanding of CYP3A activation by tanshinone IIA and cryptotanshinone in HLMs. Additionally, these data allow for an accurate prediction of the magnitude and likelihood of Danshen-drug interactions.",

Patients who were taking a BZ/Z drug, had attended a follow-up appointment at least 2 months after their index appointment and had received a documented recommendation to alter their BZ/Z drug use at the index appointment were included in this study. The associations between compliance with the specialist physician's recommendation to alter the BZ/Z drug and BZ/Z drug dose, frequency and duration, patient's age, sex, residence, co-morbidities and number of regular medications were assessed. Inter-clinician variation in the proportion of patients receiving a follow-up appointment, recording of BZ/Z drug use and the proportion of patients given a recommendation to alter BZ/Z drug use were also analysed in the broader population of all patients receiving a first appointment at the falls clinic in the study period.",

Of those patients taking a BZ/Z drug, 48% (31/65) were followed up and had a documented recommendation to alter their BZ/Z drug use. At least 68% (21/31) of these patients were compliant at follow-up. Patients who were assessed by a geriatrician were more likely to be advised to alter their BZ use than those assessed by a rehabilitation specialist (p\u2009=\u20090.002). Patients were more likely to be compliant if they were given a recommendation to cease their BZ/Z drug compared with advice to reduce the dose or to gradually reduce the dose with the aim of cessation (p\u2009=\u20090.019). There were no sex- or age-specific differences in compliance.

    "90": "Drug dependence of anaesthetists occurs more often than in other physicians, especially the noxious usage of common substances in anaesthesiology and pain management like opioids and anaesthetics. Opioids are the most frequent abusively taken medication followed by benzodiazepines, illegal drugs, Propofol and Ketamine. Determining for the behavioral pattern is the easy access to the drugs. Especially as some of the addictive-drugs (e. g. Propofol, Ketamine) are not underlying any release-control. Recent German surveys confirm the American figures. For the development of drug dependence many factors like biographic, social and genetic aspects as well as the substances and their potential itself are significant. Furthermore, the presence of many stimuli encourages the relapse-risk for addicted people despite earlier abstinence. At least 16% of all cases and 37% of the Propofol-addiction cases proceed deadly. American studies with structured therapy-, rehabilitation- and follow-up surveillance-programs show a positive prognosis for anaesthetists.

Patients with psychoses or major affective disorders treated with adequate medication (antidepressants, antipsychotics or mood-stabilizers) before admission more often received benzodiazepines than patients without adequate medication.",

    "106": "Substance use during pregnancy is a major public health concern. This study examined differences in substance use among pregnant women from rural and urban areas. Participants were 114 pregnant women entering a hospital-based inpatient detoxification unit primarily for Opiate Dependence who voluntarily agreed to a face-to-face interview. Substance use measures were based on the Addiction Severity Index gathering information about lifetime, past 12 months, and 30 days prior to admission. Rural pregnant women had higher rates of illicit opiate use, illicit sedative/benzodiazepine use, and injection drug use (IDU) in the 30 days prior to admission. Additionally, a greater proportion of rural pregnant women reported the use of multiple illegal/illicit substances in the 30 days prior to entering detoxification. More specifically, pregnant women from rural areas were 8.4 times more likely to report illicit opiate use, 5.9 times more likely to report IDU, 3.3 times more likely to report illicit sedative/benzodiazepine use, and 2.8 times more likely to report the use of multiple illegal/illicit substances in the 30 days prior to entering inpatient detoxification, after adjustment for socio-demographic characteristics (including education and income), pregnancy characteristics, physical and mental health indicators, and criminal justice system involvement. The increased rates of prescription opiate and benzodiazepine use as well as IDU among rural pregnant women are concerning. In order to begin to understand the elevated rates of substance abuse among rural pregnant women, substance use must be considered within the context of demographic, geographic, social, and economic conditions of the region.",

ACh receptors are involved in the underlying mechanism of PPI, but whether rearing in social isolation causes dysfunction of the cholinergic system is unknown. In this study, we examined the involvement of muscarinic receptors in the improvement of PPI deficits induced by galantamine, and whether the cholinergic system is altered in mice reared in isolation.",

Social isolation did not affect choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase activities in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, but it reduced the locomotor-suppressive response to muscarinic agonist oxotremorine, but not to nicotine. The isolation also attenuated the M\u2081 receptor agonist N-desmethylclozapine-induced increase in prefrontal dopamine release.",

    "111": "Antinociceptive effect and safety of sub-arachnoid (SAB) midazolam is well established in animals and human beings. In this randomized, prospective placebo control clinical study, we investigated the addition of 2.5mg midazolam to bupivacaine on the quality of surgical anaesthesia and duration of first analgesic in the post operative period after lower uterine caesarean section (LUCS). Sixty ASA I or II pregnant women scheduled for elective lower uterine caesarean section were selected for the study. The patients were randomly allocated to receive 2ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine with either 0.5ml of 5% dextrose in aqua or 2.5 mg (0.5ml) midazolam. The duration of first analgesic demand, quality of anaesthesia, haemodynamic changes and neonatal condition were assessed. The duration of analgesia (the time interval in minutes between the sub-arachnoid injection and the first analgesic demand by the patient) was significantly longer in the Group II than Group I (197min vs. 112min; p<0.001). The quality of surgical anaesthesia was excellent or good throughout the surgical procedure in 90% (n = 27) of the patients in Group II (p = 0.01). Systolic Blood pressure was significantly lower in the group I at 10 min and 20 min after administration of SAB than group II (p = 0.005 and p = 0.007) but comparable at other times. Sedation level, Apgar score was comparable in both groups. No neurological deficit or other significant adverse effects were recorded. The addition of midazolam with hyperbaric low dose bupivacaine in SAB significantly improves the quality of surgical anaesthesia and prolongs the duration of analgesia without any adverse effects.", 
    "112": "Data from in vitro drug metabolism studies with recombinant enzyme systems are frequently used to predict human drug metabolism in vivo. However, for the CYP3A probe substrate midazolam (MDZ), considerable variability in enzyme kinetic parameters has been observed in different in vitro studies. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of varying activities of the electron donor NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) on CYP3A5-mediated metabolism of MDZ. Microsomes with similar levels of CYP3A5 but 12-fold difference in CPR activity showed a 30-fold difference in intrinsic clearance for the formation of 1'-OH-MDZ. Significantly higher K(m) and lower V(max) for the formation of 1'-OH-MDZ were found in microsomes with low CPR activity compared with microsomes with higher CPR activity (P\u2009=\u20090.024 and 0.001). In the microsomes with lowest CPR activity, the formation of 1'-OH-MDZ displayed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, whereas substrate inhibition was observed in the two preparations with higher CPR activity. The present study shows that the CPR activity in different recombinant enzyme preparations is crucial for in vitro CYP3A5-mediated clearance of MDZ. This suggests that the CPR activity of enzyme preparations could be an important factor for the ability of in vitro data to predict human drug metabolism in vivo.", 
    "113": "Neuroimaging in ischemic stroke continues to be one of the most developing fields in nuclear medicine. Many studies have established the efficacy of blood flow and metabolism measurements in acute ischemic stroke. Although the release of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in clinical practice has minimized the use of SPECT or PET in the first few hours of ischemic stroke onset, implementing these techniques into a set of initial examinations is still beneficial to exclude risky patients for reperfusion therapy beyond several hours after onset. Rescuing of viable tissue suffering ischemic penumbra is an important target of early therapeutic strategy. Ischemic penumbra can be visualized by means of perfusion imaging, central type benzodiazepine receptor imaging, and hypoxy imaging. In the later phase of subacute ischemic stroke, inflammation and apoptosis can be visualized by means of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor imaging and annexin V imaging, respectively. Imaging of the penumbra and cellular responses will help evaluate the effects of drugs and interventions for ischemic stroke, suggesting its potential as a marker of the efficacy of future therapeutic regimens.", 
    "114": "Electroacupuncture (EA) has been successfully used to alleviate pain produced by various noxious stimulus. Cholecystokinin-8 (CCK-8) is a neuropeptide involved in the mediation of pain. We have previously shown that CCK-8 could antagonize the analgesic effects of EA on pain-excited neurons (PENs) and pain-inhibited neurons (PINs) in the nucleus parafascicularis (nPf). However, its mechanism of action is not clear. In the present study, we applied behavioral and neuroelectrophysiological methods to determine whether the mechanisms of CCK-8 antagonism to EA analgesia are mediated through the CCK-A receptors of PENs and PINs in the nPf of rats. We found that focusing radiant heat on the tail of rats caused a simultaneous increase in the evoked discharge of PENs or a decrease in the evoked discharge of PINs in the nPf and the tail-flick reflex. This showed that radiant heat could induce pain. EA stimulation at the bilateral ST 36 acupoints in rats for 15 min resulted in an inhibition of the electrical activity of PEN, potentiation of the electrical activity of PIN, and prolongation in tail-flick latency (TFL), i.e. EA stimulation produced an analgesic effect. The analgesic effect of EA was antagonized when CCK-8 was injected into the intracerebral ventricle of rats. The antagonistic effect of CCK-8 on EA analgesia was reversed by an injection of CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 (100 ng/\u03bcl) into the nPf of rats. Our results suggest that the pain-related neurons in the nPf have an important role in mediating EA analgesia. L-364,718 potentiates EA analgesia through the CCK-A receptor of PENs and PINs in the nPf.",

Ethanol dependence in rats was produced by substitution of drinking water with 7.5%\u2009v/v alcohol for 10 days. Then, ethanol withdrawal was induced by replacing alcohol with drinking water, 12 hours prior to experimentation. After confirming induction of withdrawal symptoms in the alcohol deprived animals, the anxiolytic activity of the test compound in graded doses (10, 20, and 40\u2009mg/kg) was compared to the standard drug alprazolam (0.08\u2009mg/kg) in the elevated plus maze and bright and dark arena paradigms. In our study, single and repeated dose administration of NR-ANX-C reduced EW-induced anxiety in a dose-dependent manner. Even though the anxiolytic activity was not significant at lower doses, NR-ANX-C at the highest dose tested (40\u2009mg/kg) produced significant anxiolytic activity that was comparable to the standard drug alprazolam. Based on our findings we believe that NR-ANX-C has the potential to be used as an alternative to benzodiazepines in the treatment of EW-induced anxiety.",

Psychiatric in-patients (England, Wales) who met criteria for SUD were identified (1 March 1999-31 December 2005). Cases were matched with controls (in-patients alive on the day a SUD occurred). Data were collected via questionnaires. Some 283 cases of SUD were identified (41 annually), with a rate of 2.33/10,000 mental health admissions (in England). Electrocardiograms were not routine, cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment was sometimes unavailable, attempts to resuscitate patients were carried out on one-half of all patients and post mortems/inquiries were not routine. Restraint and seclusion were uncommon. Risk factors included: benzodiazepines (odds ratio (OR): 1.83); \u2265 2 antipsychotics (OR: 2.35); promazine (OR: 4.02); diazepam (OR: 1.71); clozapine (OR: 2.10); cardiovascular disease (OR: 2.00); respiratory disease (OR: 1.98); diagnosis of dementia (OR: 2.08). Venlafaxine and a diagnosis of affective disorder were associated with reduced ORs (OR: 0.42; OR: 0.65). SUD is relatively rare, although it is more common in older patients and males. Prevention measures may include safer prescribing of antipsychotics and improved physical health care. The contribution of restraint or seclusion to SUD in individual cases is unclear. A uniform definition of SUD may help to identify contributing factors.",

    "118": "A rapid method for sensitive ultraviolet detection of multiple psychotropic drugs in human plasma was developed on a low-cost and expediently fabricated hybrid microfluidic device. The device was composed of one fused-silica capillary with a sampling fracture, a poly(methyl methacrylate) board with four reservoirs, and a printed circuit board. At the optimal separation and detection conditions, the baseline separation of three kinds of psychotropic drugs including barbiturates (phenobarbital and barbital), benzodiazepines (nitrazepam, clonazepam, chlordiazepoxide, alprazolam and diazepam) and tricyclic antidepressant drugs (amitriptyline) was achieved within 200 s with separation efficiency up to 3.80 \u00d7 10(5) plates m(-1). The linear ranges for ultraviolet detection were from 2.0 to 1000.0 \u03bcg mL(-1) for chlordiazepoxide and 1.0 to 1000.0 \u03bcg mL(-1) for other seven drugs. Combining with solid-phase extraction, this novel protocol could successfully be used to screen naturally existing psychotropic drugs in a known human plasma sample. The minimum detectable concentration was down to 27 ng mL(-1) for phenobarbital spiked in plasma. This work provided a promising way to initially screen different psychotropic drugs with high resolution, rapid separation and low-cost.",

Patients with schizophrenia stabilized on oral olanzapine of 10, 15, or 20 mg/day (n=1065) were randomized to continue their oral treatment or switch directly to a fixed dose of olanzapine LAI [(mg/weeks) 45/4, 150/2, 405/4, or 300/2] without oral supplementation. Six-month relapse rates for each LAI-dose group stratified by earlier oral dose were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazard model assessing risk of relapse relative to each oral dose. Relapse rates for the therapeutic LAI doses (\u2265 150 mg) varied depending on earlier oral dose, ranging from 1.5% (patients switched from 10 mg/day to 300 mg/2 weeks) to 18.8% (patients switched from 20 mg/day to 150 mg/2 weeks). Switching from 10 mg/day to 405 mg/4 weeks produced a comparable risk of relapse as remaining on that oral dose [Hazard ratio (HR)=1.03]. Switching from 15 or 20 mg/day to 300 mg/2 weeks produced comparable risk of relapse as remaining on those oral doses (HR=0.68 and 1.13, respectively). Pharmacokinetic modeling was conducted to evaluate the resulting dosing recommendations. Findings suggest that patients can be switched directly from oral to olanzapine LAI without the need for oral supplementation and with a low risk of relapse when initiated on an appropriate LAI dose.", 
    "120": "Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) continues to be one of the most feared side effects of chemotherapy. Inadequately controlled CINV can have a significant negative impact on quality of life and can in some cases compromise adherence to treatment. However, the repercussions of CINV for patients are often underestimated. Advances in our understanding of the physiology of CINV and the identification of risk factors have greatly contributed towards improvements in the control of CINV. A number of antiemetic agents are currently available for the prophylaxis and treatment of CINV, including 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 receptor antagonists corticosteroids, neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists, dopamine receptor antagonists, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and cannabinoids. With the correct use of these agents, CINV can be prevented to a great extent; however, adherence to guidelines is disappointingly low. Furthermore, a significant number of patients still experience nausea and vomiting despite optimal treatment. More effective therapies are, therefore, greatly needed, with the ultimate goal of attaining complete control of CINV. This review focuses on the current understanding of CINV, problems associated with its management and the status of promising antiemetic therapies.", 
    "121": "Benzodiazepines act at the major isoforms of GABA type A receptors where they potentiate the current evoked by the agonist GABA. The underlying mechanism of this potentiation is poorly understood, but hypothesized to be related to the mechanism that links agonist binding to channel opening in these ligand activated ion channels. The loop F of the \u03b1(1) and the \u03b2(2) subunit have been implicated in channel gating, and loop F of the \u03b3(2) subunit in the modulation by benzodiazepines. We have identified the conservative point mutation Y168F located N-terminally of loop F in the \u03b1(1) subunit that fails to affect agonist properties. Interestingly, it disrupts modulation by benzodiazepines, but leaves high affinity binding to the benzodiazepine binding site intact. Modulation by barbiturates and neurosteroids is also unaffected. Residue \u03b1(1) Y168 is not located either near the binding pockets for GABA, or for benzodiazepines, or close to the loop F of the \u03b3(2) subunit. Our results support the fact, that broader regions of ligand gated receptors are conformationally affected by the binding of benzodiazepines. We infer that also broader regions could contribute to signaling from GABA agonist binding to channel opening.",

The animals were distributed into four groups: five common marmosets (group CJR) and five black-tufted marmosets (group CPR) received 9.8 +/- 1.4 mg/kg of racemic ketamine, and five common marmosets (group CJS) and five black-tufted marmosets (group CPS) received 10.4 +/- 1.6 mg/kg of (S+) ketamine. All groups received similar dosages of midazolam (1.0 +/- 0.15 mg/kg). During immobilization, heart rates, respiratory rates, rectal temperatures, and muscle relaxation scores were recorded at 5, 10, and 20 min after initial injection. Quality of induction and quality of recovery were evaluated in each marmoset by recording physical reactions including withdrawal reflexes, involuntary movements, salivation, compulsive licking, catalepsy, and ataxia. There were no significant differences in the induction, immobilization, and recovery times between the four groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences between groups in heart rates, respiratory rates, or body temperatures, although there was a significant decrease in respiratory rates over time in group CPR. In addition, the CJR and CPS groups showed significant decreases over time in rectal temperature. Muscle relaxation was more profound in the CPR group than in the other groups. Compulsive licking, involuntary movements, salivation, and withdrawal reflexes were observed more frequently in animals given S(+) ketamine; but in general, racemic ketamine and S(+) ketamine had similar effects in all callitrichines. Further studies are required to confirm that S(+) ketamine has different potency in these species.",

Such laryngospasm seems to be idiosyncratic, and accordingly, clinicians administering ketamine must be prepared for its rapid identification and management. Given no evidence that they decrease the risk of laryngospasm, coadministered anticholinergics seem unnecessary.", 
    "127": "The mammalian amygdala expresses various neuropeptides whose signaling has been implicated in emotionality. Many neuropeptides require amidation for full activation by peptidylglycine \u03b1-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), a transmembrane vesicular cuproenzyme and regulator of the secretory pathway. Mice heterozygous for the Pam gene (PAM(+/-)) exhibit physiological and behavioral abnormalities related to specific peptidergic pathways. In the present study, we evaluated emotionality and examined molecular and cellular responses that characterize neurophysiological differences in the PAM(+/-) amygdala. PAM(+/-) mice presented with anxiety-like behaviors in the zero maze that were alleviated by diazepam. PAM(+/-) animals were deficient in short- and long-term contextual and cued fear conditioning and required higher shock intensities to establish fear-potentiated startle than their wild-type littermates. Immunohistochemical analysis of the amygdala revealed PAM expression in pyramidal neurons and local interneurons that synthesize GABA. We performed whole-cell recordings of pyramidal neurons in the PAM(+/-) amygdala to elucidate neurophysiological correlates of the fear behavioral phenotypes. Consistent with these observations, thalamic afferent synapses in the PAM(+/-) lateral nucleus were deficient in long-term potentiation. This deficit was apparent in the absence and presence of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin and was abolished when both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors were blocked. Both evoked and spontaneous excitatory signals were enhanced in the PAM(+/-) lateral nucleus. Phasic GABAergic signaling was also augmented in the PAM(+/-) amygdala, and this difference comprised activity-independent and -dependent components. These physiological findings represent perturbations in the PAM(+/-) amygdala that may underlie the aberrant emotional responses in the intact animal.", 
    "128": "Dysfunction of GABAergic transmission related to abnormal expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits in specific brain regions underlies some pathological anxiety states. Besides involvement of the benzodiazepine recognition site of GABA(A) receptor in the expression of anxiety-like behaviour, the roles of the \u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3) subunits are not well characterized. To address this issue, the experimental design of this study utilized the GABAergic compound etifoxine (with a preferential effectiveness after binding to a specific site at \u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3) subunits) tested in two inbred mouse strains: BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J mice using three behavioural paradigms (light/dark box, elevated plus maze and restraint stress-induced small intestinal transit inhibition) and the t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate-induced convulsions model. Etifoxine plasma and brain levels and \u03b2(2)/\u03b2(3) mRNAs and protein expression levels in various brain regions were compared between the two strains. The two mouse strains differed markedly in basal anxiety level. Etifoxine exhibited more pronounced anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in the BALB/cByJ mice compared to the C57BL/6J mice. The etifoxine brain/plasma ratios of the two strains were not different. Beta2 subunit mRNA and protein expression levels were around 25 and 10% higher respectively in the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the CA3 field of hippocampus of BALB/cByJ mice compared to C57BL/6J mice. Beta3 subunit mRNA and protein expression levels did not differ between the two strains. Based on these results, it is suggested that overexpression of GABA(A) receptor \u03b2(2) subunit in BALB/cByJ mice relative to C57BL/6j mice contributes to the dysfunction in GABA(A) transmission in regions of brain known to regulate responses to stress. The dysregulated GABA(A) function in BALB/cByJ mice may be corrected by the administration of etifoxine.",

In contrast, tethering \u03b3\u2082\u03b2-strand 9 to the \u03b3\u2082 pre-M1 region (via \u03b3\u2082S202C/S230C) significantly enhanced potentiation by both flurazepam and zolpidem, indicating \u03b3\u2082S202C/S230C trapped the receptor in a more favourable conformation for positive modulation by BZDs.

However, even using ultra-high-performance LC, baseline separation is not always possible. For development and validation of an LC/MS/MS approach for quantification of 140 antidepressants, benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, beta-blockers, oral antidiabetics, and analytes measured in the context of brain death diagnosis in plasma, the extent of ion suppression or enhancement of co-eluting analytes within and between the drug classes was investigated using atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization (APCI) or electrospray ionization (ESI). Within the drug classes, five analytes showed ion enhancement of over 25% and six analytes ion suppression of over 25% using APCI and 16 analytes ion suppression of over 25% using ESI. Between the drug classes, two analytes showed ion suppression of over 25% using APCI. Using ESI, one analyte showed ion enhancement of over 25% and five analytes ion suppression of over 25%. These effects may influence the drug quantification using calibrators made in presence of overlapping and thus interfering analytes. Ion suppression/enhancement effects induced by co-eluting drugs of different classes present in the patient sample may also lead to false measurements using class-specific calibrators made in absence of overlapping and thus interfering analytes. In conclusion, ion suppression and enhancement tests are essential during method development and validation in LC/MS/MS multi-analyte procedures, with special regards to co-eluting analytes.", 
    "134": "Several studies have suggested that risperidone is superior to olanzapine in glucose tolerance; however, there is little information available about the risk of impaired glucose metabolism induced by atypical antipsychotics in the same patients. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed in 22 mildly obese, diabetes-free, Japanese patients with schizophrenia who received risperidone or olanzapine for at least 2 months. After the OGTT, the medication was switched to another by decreasing the previous dosage gradually over 2 to 8 months after the initiation of the second medicine. After at least 8 weeks of complete switching, the same OGTT procedure was conducted. Fasting insulin concentration and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) during olanzapine treatment were significantly higher compared with risperidone treatment. The area under the concentration-time curves of serum insulin concentrations from 0 to 120 min was different in patients receiving risperidone compared with patients receiving olanzapine; however, there were no differences in the insulinogenic index between the two groups. The present study suggests that olanzapine might impair glucose tolerance to some extent because of an increase in insulin resistance compared with risperidone.",

Biological and pharmacological studies indicate that the substitution at position 8 with a trifluoromethyl group confers pharmacological activity due to potential metabolic stability in comparison to inactive 8-methyl substituted analogues. In particular, the compound 3-(2-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl)-8-trifluoromethylpyrazolo[5,1-c][1,2,4]benzotriazine 5-oxide (21) emerges because of its selective anxiolytic profile without side effects.

Propofol ensures a more rapid induction of sedation and recovery and, in certain conditions, higher patient satisfaction and improved quality of endoscopic examination. Specific training is required to use this drug. Patients at risk of complications should be identified before the endoscopy to optimize patient management with an anesthesiologist. After sedation, psychomotor recovery is faster with propofol compared to traditional sedation agents but tasks requiring particular attention (eg, driving) should be avoided. It is important to advise patients of these restrictions in advance.",

Plasma samples (50 microL) were extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether and isotope-labeled internal standard (olanzapine-D3) was used. The chromatographic separation was performed on XBridge Shield RP 18 (100 mm x 2.1 mm, 3.5 microm, Waters). An isocratic program was used at a flow rate of 0.4 m x min(-1) with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and ammonium buffer (pH 8). The protonated ions of analytes were detected in positive ionization by multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode. The plasma method, with a lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 0.1 ng x mL(-1), demonstrated good linearity over a range of 0.1 - 30 ng x mL(-1) of olanzapine. Specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, recovery, matrix effect and stability were evaluated during method validation. The validated method was successfully applied to analyzing human plasma samples in bioavailability study.",

The article reports 5 cases of accidental drug overdoses at the Westmead Coronial Morgue, Sydney New South Wales, over a 6-year period with evidence of intracorporeal drug concealment known as body packing or body stuffing. Three different forms of anatomic concealment of drugs are illustrated, Case 2 involving therapeutic medication in the form of glass ampoules for parenteral injection not previously reported. Three deaths were the result of acute toxicity due to polydrug abuse rather than as a consequence of the body packing behavior and rupture of the drug packaging, with the intracorporeal drug concealments an adjunct finding at the autopsy examinations. The cause of death in Case 3 was the direct result of acute cocaine intoxication due to rupture of drug packages in the rectum and mucosal absorption.

    "144": "The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of acoustic stimuli, being in a position to send auditory information to motor centers that participate in behaviors such as prey catching and predators' avoidance. The role of the central nucleus of the IC (CIC) on fear and anxiety has been suggested on the basis that rats are able to engage in tasks to decrease the aversiveness of CIC stimulation, increased Fos immunolabeling during diverse aversive states and increased CIC auditory evoked potentials (AEP) induced by conditioned fear stimuli. Additionally, it was shown that brainstem AEP, represented by wave V, for which the main generator is the IC, is increased during experimentally-induced anxiety. Rats segregated according to their low or high emotional reactivity have been used as an important tool in the study of fear and anxiety. The IC contains a high density of GABA receptors. Since the efficacy of an anxiolytic compound is a function of the animal's anxiety level, it is possible that GABA-benzodiazepine (Bzp) agents affect LA and HA animals differently. In this study we investigated the GABA-Bzp influence on the modulation of AEP in rats with low- (LA) or high-anxiety (HA) levels, as assessed by the elevated plus-maze test (EPM). GABA-Bzp modulation on the unconditioned AEP response was analyzed by using intra-CIC injections (0.2 \u03bcl) of the GABA-Bzp agonists muscimol (121 ng) and diazepam (30 \u03bcg), or the GABA inhibitors bicuculline (10 ng) and semicarbazide (7 \u03bcg). In a second experiment, we evaluate the effects of contextual aversive conditioning on AEP using foot-shocks as unconditioned stimuli. On the unconditioned fear paradigm GABA inhibition increased AEP in LA rats and decreases this measure in HA counterparts. Muscimol was effective in reducing AEP in both LA and HA rats. Contextual fear stimuli increased the magnitude of AEP. In spite of no effect obtained with diazepam in LA rats the drug inhibited AEP in HA animals. The specificity of the regulatory mechanisms mediated by GABA-Bzp for the ascending neurocircuits responsible for the acquisition of aversive information in LA and HA animals shed light on the processing of sensory information underlying the generation of defensive reactions.", 
    "145": "A significant link was previously established between benzodiazepine withdrawal anxiety and a progressive increase in \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR) potentiation in hippocampal CA1 neurons from rats withdrawn up to 2 days from 1-week oral administration of the benzodiazepine flurazepam (FZP). Despite AMPAR current potentiation, withdrawal anxiety was masked by a 2-fold reduction in CA1 neuron N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents since preinjection of an NMDA antagonist restored NMDAR currents and unmasked anxiety in 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. In the current study, GluN subunit levels in postsynaptic density (PSD)-enriched subfractions of CA1 minislices were compared with GluN2B-mediated whole-cell currents evoked in CA1 neurons in hippocampal slices from 1- and 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats. GluN1 and GluN2B, although not the phosphoSer1303-GluN2B ratio or GluN2A subunit levels, were decreased in PSD subfractions from 2-day, but not 1-day, FZP-withdrawn rats. Consistent with immunoblot analyses, GluN2B-mediated NMDAR currents evoked in slices from 2-day FZP-withdrawn rats were decreased in the absence, but not the presence, of the GluN2B subunit-selective antagonist ifenprodil. In contrast, ifenprodil-sensitive NMDAR currents were unchanged in slices from 1-day withdrawn rats. Because AMPA (1 \u03bcM) preincubation of slices from 1-day FZP-withdrawn rats induced depression of GluN2B subunit-mediated currents, depression of NMDAR currents was probably secondary to AMPAR potentiation. CA1 neuron NMDAR currents were depressed \u223c50% after 2-day withdrawal and offset potentiation of AMPAR-mediated currents, leaving total charge transfer unchanged between groups. Collectively, these findings suggest that a reduction of GluN2B-containing NMDAR may serve as a homeostatic feedback mechanism to modulate glutamatergic synaptic strength during FZP withdrawal to alleviate benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.",

We discuss the role of drugs in general and polypharmacy (the concurrent use of multiple drugs) on the risk of falling, with a focus on community-dwelling older people. We critically appraise the evidence that specific classes of drugs, such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants, increase the risk of falling and that falls can be prevented through interventions that target medications.",

The cutoff values are lower than required in existing guidelines like SAMHSA and there is critical discussion about detection of low concentrations by using immunoassay, especially concerning amphetamines in urine (50 ng/ml). In this study Direct ELISA kits were tested for their applicability to identify the absence of amphetamines, cannabinoids, opiates, cocaine, methadone and benzodiazepines in urine. Results were confirmed by LC/MS or GC/MS analyses. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values (positive as well as negative) and overall misclassification rates were evaluated by contingency tables and were compared to ROC-analyses. Sensitivity results as well as specificity results were satisfying showing sensitivity values higher than 96% for each analyte. The amphetamine test we used showed sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 88%, respectively, even if amphetamine tests usually react with high cross-reactivity.

    "156": "Over the past two decades, catatonia has been better demarcated in adult psychiatry as a unique syndrome that consists of specific motor signs with a characteristic response to benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy. Pediatric catatonia is considered rare, but may be underdiagnosed, and hence undertreated. Discussed here are the current diagnostic criteria of catatonia in individual cases of children and adolescents diagnosed with childhood disintegrative disorder, Kleine-Levin syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, tic disorder, and autoimmune encephalitis, and the effects of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy. In these cases, catatonia resolved safely once it was recognized and treated properly. Children and adolescents presenting with these disorders should be systematically assessed for catatonia; when the presence of catatonia is confirmed, the use of benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy should be considered. The occurrence of catatonia in such a wide range of child and adolescent disorders supports the view that pediatric catatonia is not so rare, that there are shared elements in the etiology, psychopathology, and pathophysiology of these disorders, and that catatonia is best classified as a unique neurobiologic syndrome.",

Simply testing animals in the dark also increases open arm exploration, which may be interpreted as an anxiolytic effect. We investigated the effects of two GABAergic drugs, pentylenetetrazol (10 and 20 mg/kg) and chlordiazepoxide (1.5 and 3 mg/kg), and one non-GABAergic drug, caffeine (10 and 30 mg/kg) on anxiety levels of rats tested in the elevated plus-maze under two illumination conditions, light or dark. All animals explored more the open arms in the dark. In the light, pentylenetetrazol decreased open arm exploration while chlordiazepoxide had the opposite effect. Neither pentylenetetrazol nor chlordiazepoxide had any effect in the dark. Caffeine, increased open arms exploration in both illumination conditions. These results indicate that light triggers aversion, a response mediated by GABA since the GABAergic drugs, but not caffeine, were ineffective when the rats were tested in the dark.", 
    "158": "Multidrug regimens and corresponding drug interactions cause many adverse reactions and treatment failures. Drug efflux transporters: P-gp, MRP, BCRP in conjunction with metabolizing enzymes (CYPs) are major factors in such interactions. Most effective combination antiretrovirals (ARV) therapy includes a PI or a NNRTI or two NRTI. Coadministration of such ARV may induce efflux transporters and/or CYP3A4 resulting in sub-therapeutic blood levels and therapeutic failure due to reduced absorption and/or increased metabolism. A similar prognosis is true for ARV-compounds and drugs of abuse combinations. Morphine and nicotine enhance CYP3A4 and MDR1 expression in vitro. A 2.5 fold rise of cortisol metabolite was evident in smokers relative to nonsmokers. Altered functions of efflux transporters and CYPs in response to ARV and drugs of abuse may result in altered drug absorption and metabolism. Appropriate in vitro models can be employed to predict such interactions. Influence of genetic polymorphism, SNP and inter-individual variation in drug response has been discussed. Complexity underlying the relationship between efflux transporters and CYP makes it difficult to predict the outcome of HAART as such, particularly when HIV patients taking drugs of abuse do not adhere to HAART regimens. HIV(+) pregnant women on HAART medications, indulging in drugs of abuse, may develop higher viral load due to such interactions and lead to increase in mother to child transmission of HIV. A multidisciplinary approach with clear understanding of mechanism of interactions may allow proper selection of regimens so that desired therapeutic outcome of HAART can be reached without any side effects.",

Concomitant use of diazepam or other benzodiazepines in methadone maintenance treatment can increase the risk of sudden death. Therefore, we determined the effects of methadone and diazepam singly and in combination on cardiac action potentials (APs) and on the major ion channels responsible for cardiac repolarization. Using patch clamp recording in human stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes and stably transfected mammalian cells, we found that methadone produced concentration-dependent AP prolongation and ion channel block at low micromolar concentrations: hERG (IC50 = 1.7 \u03bcM), hNav1.5 (11.2 \u03bcM tonic block; 5.5 \u03bcM phasic block), and hCav1.2 (26.7 \u03bcM tonic block; 7.7 \u03bcM phasic block). Methadone was less potent in hKv4.3/hKChIP2.2 (IC50 = 39.0 \u03bcM) and hKvLQT1/hminK (53.3 \u03bcM). In contrast, diazepam blocked channels only at much higher concentrations and had no effect on AP duration at 1 \u03bcM. However, coadministration of 1-\u03bcM diazepam with methadone caused a statistically significant increase in AP duration and a 4-fold attenuation of hNav1.5 block (IC50 values were 44.2 \u03bcM and 26.6 \u03bcM, respectively, for tonic and phasic block), with no significant effect on methadone-induced block of hERG, hCav1.2, hKv4.3/hKChIP2.2, and hKvLQT1/hminK channels. Thus, although diazepam alone does not prolong the QT interval, the relief of methadone-induced Na channel block may leave hERG K channel block uncompensated, thereby increasing cardiac risk.",

Diazepam was administered using a similar regimen (from 130-50 mg/day tapering to 5-15 mg/day). Subjects were treated initially (weeks 1 and 2) in an inpatient unit and for the final week in an outpatient facility.

Case definition involved alcohol cases with blood alcohol concentration (BAC) 0.2 g/kg and higher; with cannabis, detections of active THC metabolites only were taken into account; from cases where volatile substances (solvents) were detected we included into the positive cases only those where substances were not produced post mortem or in some physiological or pathological statuses.",

It has been shown that physicians do not have proficiency in the ordering or interpretation of these tests. This article is an attempt to respond to that need. Current antibody-based enzymatic immunoassays (EIAs) used for urine toxicology screening are useful to detect classes of drugs (ex., opiate) but cannot determine which specific drug (ex., morphine) is present. Gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy can determine exactly which drugs are present, allowing prescribed (or illicit) opiates and benzodiazepines to be identified. This article will discuss principles and details of opiate and benzodiazepine EIA and gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy urine toxicology testing. The approach to detecting patients attributing positive opiate EIAs to prescription opiates who are using heroin or other opioids will be reviewed. Cases of controlled prescription drugs that do not produce the expected positive urine tests (ex., oxycodone producing negative opiate screening tests) will be discussed. How to differentiate codeine from heroin and the role of poppy seeds in toxicology will be examined. The case of an anti-depressant drug that produces false-positive benzodiazepine results and antibiotics that cause positive opiate urine toxicology results will be reviewed. Common benzodiazepines (ex., clonazepam and lorazepam) that do not reliably produce positive benzodiazepine EIAs will be discussed. The approach to detection and management of all these types of toxicology cases will be reviewed, and it is hoped that the analyses presented will impart an adequate information base to medical providers and staff members of drug treatment and pain centers, enabling them to order and interpret these tests in the clinic more effectively as an integrated part of whole patient care.",

    "224": "7-Chloro-5-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,5-dihydro-4,1-benzothiazepin-2(3H)-one [CGP-37157 (CGP)], a benzothiazepine derivative of clonazepam, is commonly used as a blocker of the mitochondrial Na+/Ca\u00b2+ exchanger. However, evidence suggests that CGP could also affect other targets, such as L-type Ca\u00b2+ channels and plasmalemma Na+/Ca\u00b2+ exchanger. Here, we tested the possibility of a direct modulation of ryanodine receptor channels (RyRs) and/or sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2+-stimulated ATPase (SERCA) by CGP. In the presence of ruthenium red (inhibitor of RyRs), CGP decreased SERCA-mediated Ca\u00b2+ uptake of cardiac and skeletal sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) microsomes (IC\u2085\u2080 values of 6.6 and 9.9 \u03bcM, respectively). The CGP effects on SERCA activity correlated with a decreased V(max) of ATPase activity of SERCA-enriched skeletal SR fractions. CGP (\u2265 5 \u03bcM) also increased RyR-mediated Ca\u00b2+ leak from skeletal SR microsomes. Planar bilayer studies confirmed that both cardiac and skeletal RyRs are directly activated by CGP (EC(50) values of 9.4 and 12.0 \u03bcM, respectively). In summary, we found that CGP inhibits SERCA and activates RyR channels. Hence, the action of CGP on cellular Ca\u00b2+ homeostasis reported in the literature of cardiac, skeletal muscle, and other nonmuscle systems requires further analysis to take into account the contribution of all CGP-sensitive Ca\u00b2+ transporters.",

Lithium and valproate were the medications most frequently prescribed at the time of improvement and had among the highest overall success rates.

Nevertheless, the connection between the protein affinity profiles and the structural characteristics of the binding sites is still unclear. Our aim was to investigate the association between virtual drug screening results (calculated binding free energy values) and the geometry of protein binding sites. Molecular Affinity Fingerprints (MAFs) were determined for 154 proteins based on their molecular docking energy results for 1,255 FDA-approved drugs. Protein binding site geometries were characterized by 420 PocketPicker descriptors. The basic underlying component structure of MAFs and binding site geometries, respectively, were examined by principal component analysis; association between principal components extracted from these two sets of variables was then investigated by canonical correlation and redundancy analyses.", 
    "230": "PCA analysis of the MAF variables provided 30 factors which explained 71.4% of the total variance of the energy values while 13 factors were obtained from the PocketPicker descriptors which cumulatively explained 94.1% of the total variance. Canonical correlation analysis resulted in 3 statistically significant canonical factor pairs with correlation values of 0.87, 0.84 and 0.77, respectively. Redundancy analysis indicated that PocketPicker descriptor factors explain 6.9% of the variance of the MAF factor set while MAF factors explain 15.9% of the total variance of PocketPicker descriptor factors. Based on the salient structures of the factor pairs, we identified a clear-cut association between the shape and bulkiness of the drug molecules and the protein binding site descriptors.", 
    "231": "This is the first study to investigate complex multivariate associations between affinity profiles and the geometric properties of protein binding sites. We found that, except for few specific cases, the shapes of the binding pockets have relatively low weights in the determination of the affinity profiles of proteins. Since the MAF profile is closely related to the target specificity of ligand binding sites we can conclude that the shape of the binding site is not a pivotal factor in selecting drug targets. Nonetheless, based on strong specific associations between certain MAF profiles and specific geometric descriptors we identified, the shapes of the binding sites do have a crucial role in virtual drug design for certain drug categories, including morphine derivatives, benzodiazepines, barbiturates and antihistamines.", 
    "232": "There is evidence that dysregulation of free radicals metabolism associated with abnormal activities of antioxidative enzymes in schizophrenia can lead to lipid peroxidation in plasma, erythrocytes, blood platelets and cerebrospinal fluid. Injury to neurons in schizophrenia may affect their function, i.e. membrane transport, impairment of energy production in mitochondria, changes in membrane phospholipid composition, alteration of receptors and transporters as well as neurotransmission. The purpose of the present study was to assess the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and lipid peroxidation (expressed as the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS]) in plasma from schizophrenic patients taking olanzapine or risperidone. The level of TBARS estimated according to the Rice-Evans method and TAC ([ABTS; 2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical cation decolorization assay]) in plasma from schizophrenic patients (DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, n = 30, age 18-36) taking olanzapine or risperidone and from healthy volunteers (n = 30) were measured.",

The in vitro study showed that after olanzapine or risperidone (at final concentrations corresponding to doses used in acute episodes of schizophrenia treatment) no changes of plasma lipid peroxidation were found (P > 0.05). The obtained results indicate that the pro-oxidant disturbances occur in schizophrenic patients (acute episode) taking stable doses of olanzapine or risperidone.",

    "236": "Seizures are a common sequela of self-poisoning. However, their mechanism differs from seizures of other etiologies. Toxicological seizures result from alterations in the excitatory and inhibitory balance of otherwise normal neurons. In contrast, idiopathic or trauma related seizures usually start with a focus of abnormal neurons. For both forms of seizures, benzodiazepines are recommended as first-line therapy; however, there is debate about the use of phenytoin or barbiturates for second-line therapy.", 
    "237": "In this article, we systematically review the evidence for the use of these drugs as second-line therapy for toxicological seizures. Barbiturates complement the anticonvulsant effect of benzodiazepines at the GABAA receptor by increasing the duration of chloride channel opening; phenytoin blocks voltage-dependent sodium channels to inhibit propagation from active electrical foci, an effect more useful for nontoxicological seizures. We found no randomized controlled trial comparing phenytoin and barbiturates in toxicological seizures refractory to benzodiazepines; similarly no trial was found comparing the use of these drugs in nonpoisoned patients. Animal studies indicate that phenobarbital has greater effectiveness than phenytoin for many poisons; a few case reports suggest a better response in patients.", 
    "238": "Despite the lack of high-quality clinical trial data, pharmacological knowledge and animal studies suggest that phenobarbital or thiopentone should be second-line agents for controlling toxicological seizures. The role of newer agents such as propofol and levetiracetam in toxicological seizures is currently unclear because of a lack of clinical or animal studies."
