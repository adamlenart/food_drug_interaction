In comparison to placebo, alprazolam significantly reduced plasma MHPG and cortisol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and increased subjective ratings of drowsiness and mellow. Yohimbine and the alprazolam-yohimbine combination significantly increased plasma free MHPG. Concomitant yohimbine administration antagonized the effects of alprazolam on blood pressure and attenuated alprazolam-induced changes in cortisol and subjective ratings. The ability of alprazolam to decrease plasma MHPG and blood pressure contrasts with previously reported effects of diazepam. The implications of the findings of the present investigation to the postulated role of brain noradrenergic function in the etiology of panic anxiety and the therapeutic mechanism of action of antipanic treatment are discussed.", 
    "1": "The antiepileptic effect, effects on EEG, and tolerability of taltrimide, a new taurine derivative, were studied in this open clinical trial in 27 patients with severe epilepsy resistant to conventional drugs. After the 2-week control phase, taltrimide was given in gradually increasing doses up to 4.0 g/day--this dose used for 12 days. Taltrimide was given over 4 weeks and it was gradually withdrawn over 2 weeks. The frequency of seizures increased statistically significantly during the trial with increasing dose of taltrimide and decreased again in the withdrawal phase of the trial. Of six dropouts, one had status epilepticus, and in two patients increased number or severity of seizures necessitated withdrawal of taltrimide. There were no changes in EEG recordings or in laboratory data for safety evaluation. Taltrimide penetrated well through the blood-brain barrier, with the concentration of its main metabolite, phthalimidoethanesulphonamide, in cerebrospinal fluid, about half that in serum. The concentration of phenytoin increased statistically significantly, and there was a significant decrease in serum carbamazepine concentration during the taltrimide treatment. The anticonvulsive effect of taltrimide observed in animal experiments could not be confirmed in this study; in contrast, the seizures increased statistically significantly during taltrimide treatment. The reason for this remains obscure. The doses used, the significant drug interactions, or the patient material seemingly do not explain totally the noticed increase in seizure frequency. One explanation may be that taltrimide has proconvulsive properties in humans.", 
    "2": "Valproate exhibits potent antiepileptic and antimyoclonic activity in a number of clinical and experimental syndromes. The mechanism of action of valproate remains unknown, but several neurotransmitter systems are affected directly or indirectly by valproate administration. The levels of the serotonin precursor and the principal serotonin metabolite, tryptophan and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, respectively, are elevated in rodent brain following the administration of anticonvulsant doses of valproate. However, the anticonvulsant action of valproate is preserved in mice pretreated with p-chlorophenylalanine, which depletes the brain levels of serotonin and serotonin metabolites. Valproate administration elevates the level of the inhibitory transmitter glycine in the urine and plasma of patients and experimental animals, and the hepatic glycine cleavage enzyme is inhibited by valproate. The cerebral glycine levels in rodents are not affected by valproate administration, and the inhibitory action of glycine on reticular neuron firing is not affected by iontophoretically applied valproate. Valproate exerts multiple effects on the inhibitory GABA transmitter system. Elevation in brain GABA level occurs in parallel with the anticonvulsant activity observed following valproate administration, and high levels of valproate inhibit the GABA-metabolizing enzymes GABA-T and SSADH and cause a reduction in the rate of GABA turnover. Valproate has no effect on GABA uptake, release, or binding to the GABA receptor complex. Iontophoretically applied valproate augments the inhibitory action of GABA on neuronal firing in a number of brain regions including the reticular formation. Excitatory amino acid antagonists have recently been shown to possess anticonvulsant and antimyoclonic activity in a number of animal models. The ability of these compounds to decrease the brain level of the excitatory transmitter aspartate is shared by valproate. The valproate-induced decrease in aspartate level is dose dependent and coincides with the period of anticonvulsant protection. There is also a strong correlation between the anticonvulsant potency of a number of valproate analogs and their ability to reduce cerebral aspartate levels.", 
    "3": "The clinical characteristics of 15 patients with essential myoclonus are evaluated. The course of illness was one of initial worsening followed by a stable or improved state. Only two patients had positive family histories of involuntary movements. Nine patients had segmental distribution despite a careful search for etiology; in two of these patients, myoclonus was rhythmic. The trunk and proximal limbs were the most frequently affected body regions. Clonazepam improved myoclonus in 10 of 13 patients, two of whom had complete resolution of symptoms. On review of the salient features of the myoclonus, we discerned four phenomenological subcategories: (a) oscillatory myoclonus, (b) rhythmic segmental myoclonus, (c) nonrhythmic segmental myoclonus, and (d) nonrhythmic multifocal myoclonus.", 
    "4": "Effects of 5 mg/kg diazepam given once a week for several weeks to drug-naive and drug-experienced monkeys were studied on a spatial delayed-alternation task. In both groups response latency was increased and the number of correct responses was reduced. The effects were consistent over weeks in the experienced monkeys, but in the naive monkeys there were greater initial effects on response latency and on repeat errors, and these lessened over 2-3 weeks. Thereafter, effects resembled those observed in the experienced group. Results are discussed in terms of the possible factors involved in the development and persistence of tolerance to benzodiazepines.", 
    "5": "Six dogs were, under constant environmental conditions, treated for 7 weeks with clonazepam (0.5 mg/kg b.i.d. orally). Already after 1 week of treatment, slight symptoms of withdrawal could be elicited by intravenous injection of flumazepil (Ro 15-1788). When clonazepam was finally withdrawn, a self-limiting abstinence syndrome was observed in all dogs, consisting of behavioral alterations (listlessness, wet dog shakes, dorsal recumbency), tremor, a severe clonic-tonic seizure in 1 case, hyperthermia, and weight loss. The syndrome was most pronounced on days 2 and 3 after withdrawal, after 1 week all signs of physical dependence had disappeared.", 
    "6": "The baboon Papio papio develops a nonepileptic myoclonus 20 to 30 min after i.m. benzodiazepine injection. It is characterized by bilateral jerks involving mainly the neck and the trunk, by the absence of any correlative EEG paroxysmal discharge, and by its facilitation during movement or agitation. This myoclonus resembles the intention myoclonus of human patients as seen, for example, after anoxia. We found in experiments on 10 adolescent baboons that atropine alone induced the myoclonus for several hours, that physostigmine completely antagonized the benzodiazepine-induced as well as the atropine-induced myoclonus, and that the peripherally acting cholinergic antagonist, methyl-QNB, and agonist prostigmine had no action on the myoclonus, suggesting that the benzodiazepine-induced myoclonus in this species depends on a strong depression of the central cholinergic system by benzodiazepine. The benzodiazepine-induced myoclonus was mediated by benzodiazepine receptors as it was blocked by the specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro 15-1788, which did not block atropine-induced myoclonus; latency to myoclonus after benzodiazepine was longer than after atropine. These facts suggest that benzodiazepines, by an as yet unknown mechanism, induce a depression of the cholinergic system which in turn leads to the development of myoclonus. Finally, the benzodiazepine-induced myoclonus of the baboon can be considered as a good model for testing drugs that act on the muscarinic cholinergic system and also for testing benzodiazepine-acetylcholine interactions.", 
    "7": "This study investigated the effect of intravenous diazepam on induction of anesthesia with alfentanil. Forty ASA physical status I and II patients were given one of four treatments: alfentanil 100 micrograms/kg or 200 micrograms/kg, without diazepam or preceded by 0.125 mg/kg diazepam intravenously. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, response to verbal command, and movement were assessed for 5 min, and blood was taken for measurement of histamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. All ten patients receiving 100 micrograms/kg and five of the ten patients receiving 200 micrograms/kg of alfentanil responded to voice after 5 min, but only one in each group responded when it was preceded by diazepam. There was no rigidity or serious arrhythmias in any patient. Heart rate increased in patients receiving alfentanil alone. Blood pressure increased in those receiving 100 micrograms/kg but not 200 micrograms/kg. In patients given diazepam, tachycardia did not occur, but blood pressure decreased after administration of alfentanil. There were no significant changes in plasma levels of histamine or catecholamines. Five of the six cases of inadequate postoperative ventilation were in patients given diazepam. Despite these effects, diazepam or some other hypnotic agent may be indicated when alfentanil is used for induction.", 
    "8": "The GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor has been purified to homogeneity from bovine and rat cerebral cortex. Under optimum conditions, the purified receptor has been shown to possess four distinct drug-binding sites, for GABA, benzodiazepine, barbiturate and Cl- channel gating classes of ligands. The receptor is a multi-subunit membrane glycoprotein with an oligomeric size of 230,000 Da. It contains at least two subunits, alpha and beta, the first of which can be photoaffinity-labelled with the benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have been raised to the native receptor and both have been used in an immunological characterization of the receptor protein in detergent extracts and likewise in purified preparations from bovine cerebral cortex.", 
    "9": "Using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and specific radioligands, dopaminergic D2 (DA-D2 receptors) and benzodiazepine receptors (BZ-receptors) were studied in living animals during normal and pathological conditions. In vivo characterization of both receptors was performed using two highly specific antagonists namely: 11C-Ro 15 1788 for BZ-receptors and 76 Br-Bromospiperone for DA-D2 receptors. Changes in 11c-Ro 15 1788 specific binding to BZ-receptors were observed during convulsive seizures. After MPTP treatment, a decrease in the 76 Br-Bromospiperone striatal specific binding was observed, correlated with the establishment of a Parkinson-like syndrome.", 
    "10": "Clinical history, neurologic investigations, course, EMG findings, muscle biopsy and response to diazepam treatment in two patients fulfilled criteria established by Gordon, Januszko and Kaufman for the diagnosis of the stiff-man syndrome.

    "11": "Electrophysiological and pharmacological evidence is summarized for the existence of an inhibitory receptor system operated by glycine and another two separate systems operated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) through GABA-A and GABA-B receptors, respectively. Claims for subclasses of GABA-A receptor are critically reviewed and found not-proven. A quantitative pharmacological profile of the GABA-A receptor and associated regulatory sites for picrotoxin, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on the dorsal funiculus of the rat cuneate nucleus is described. When compared with this profile and the pharmacological properties of the glycine receptor complex, the effects of taurine cannot be entirely explained by actions on these two receptor systems.", 
    "12": "In receptors, as in enzymes, quantitative as well as qualitative genetic variation may exist. Studies in inbred strains of mice have shown for various receptors that the receptor density as determined by Bmax values is under genetic control. In healthy adult twins we have shown that the density of alpha-adrenoceptors on platelets is also influenced by genetic factors, since monozygotic twins were much more similar to one another than dizygotic twins. However, Bmax values are up-regulated and down-regulated by endogenous neurotransmitters and pharmacologically active agents. Thus, receptor densities are under considerable regulatory influences. Bmax values therefore reflect regulatory mechanisms rather than innate characteristics of the receptor protein. In another twin study we failed to find evidence for a genetic influence on the density of imipramine-binding sites on platelets. Since qualitative variation (polymorphism) is well known in enzymes, it may also apply to receptors. Qualitative differences in the receptor protein within one species would be of particular interest because of possible functional implications. As a first approach we examined central benzodiazepine receptors by photoaffinity labelling and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A comparison of fish, frog, chicken, mouse, rat and calf led to the detection of variation between species. Investigations in five inbred mouse and rat strains have not so far revealed genetic variation in benzodiazepine receptors. Nevertheless variation may be detectable by more sensitive methods such as peptide mapping after limited proteolysis or two-dimensional electrophoresis.", 
    "13": "The development of rats was studied for 3 postnatal weeks after prenatal medication with diazepam (10 mg/kg/day), phenytoin (50 mg/kg/day), or tofizopam (50 mg/kg twice daily) given by gastric intubation from day 7 to 21 of pregnancy. The treatments had no effect on the litter size. There were also no differences between the groups in a battery of tests for development (negative geotaxis, righting reflex, cliff avoidance, rotarod, passive avoidance), but the activity spurt seen at postnatal days 18-21 was missing in pups of diazepam-treated mothers. The number of benzodiazepine receptors and their affinity for tritiated flunitrazepam developed similarly in all of the rat groups. Thus, the transient changes in motor development seen 2-3 weeks after birth of rats whose mothers received diazepam during pregnancy do not seem to be related to changes in ontogenesis of benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "14": "Evidence that gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and benzodiazepine receptors play a role in the inhibition of ACTH-cortisol secretion in humans has until now been drawn only from data indicating that sodium valproate, a GABA mimetic, and diazepam, a benzodiazepine, decrease hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis secretion in patients affected by pathological hypersecretion of the axis. Therefore, the present study investigated the effects, in the same healthy subjects, of sodium valproate or diazepam, on both basal and stress-stimulated concentrations of beta-endorphin (beta-EP), beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) and cortisol. A single maximal dose of sodium valproate (400 mg) or diazepam (10 mg) did not significantly modify basal concentrations of beta-EP, beta-LPH and cortisol. On the other hand, in the same subjects, pretreatment with sodium valproate (20 mg X 3) or diazepam (10 mg X 2) blocked the increases in these hormones produced by hypoglycemic stress in all patients tested (p less than 0.01 vs. placebo at 45, 60 and 90 min after insulin injection), without affecting the decrease in blood glucose levels. The present data show that sodium valproate and diazepam inhibit stress-induced beta-EP, beta-LPH and cortisol secretion in humans, suggesting that endogenous GABA and benzodiazepine receptors participate in physiological mechanisms regulating the activity of the HPA axis.", 
    "15": "Several previous studies have suggested a strong GABA-mimetic action of the endogenous brain imino acid, L-pipecolic acid (L-PA). In the present study, these observations were evaluated using electrophysiological and neurochemical methods. In contrast to published data our electrophysiological studies on rat cortical neurones in situ showed only a weak, but bicuculline-sensitive depressant action of L-PA on cortical neurones. Furthermore, L-PA proved to have no affinity for any of the three components of the GABA-benzodiazepine-chloride channel receptor complex. However, using a modification of published methods a weak affinity for the GABA-B receptor site was demonstrated (IC50 = 1.8 X 10(-3) M). L-PA showed no anticonvulsive activity in several tests; in particular, it did not protect mice from seizures induced by inhibition of L-glutamate-1-decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.15: GAD). L-PA had a very weak action on brain GABA levels of mice, and did not modify the rate of GABA synthesis. In conclusion, these results are not compatible with a strong in vivo interaction between L-PA and GABA-mediated inhibitory transmission.", 
    "16": "Buspirone, an anxiolytic unrelated to benzodiazepines that may act at the presynaptic dopamine receptor, was given to 11 patients with Parkinson's disease in an open label study. Seven patients completed the initial 10 week study achieving doses of 50-70 mg/day without any significant change in their clinical status. Six patients continued for an additional 3-11 weeks with increases in dose to 65-100 mg/day. Two of the three most severely affected patients had mild worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. Buspirone is ineffective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but at anxiolytic doses (less than 40 mg/day) does not adversely affect parkinsonian disability.", 
    "17": "Drug therapy of Alzheimer's disease is either symptomatic, directed against behavioral manifestations, or specific, presumably directed against some hypothetical pathogenetic mechanism. Symptomatic treatment involves the use of antipsychotic drugs, alone or combined with benzodiazepines, to curb disturbed behavior, restore a normal sleep-wake cycle and improve self-care. Antidepressants can be used cautiously when indicated. Specific treatment has employed many different drugs over the years, including stimulants, cerebral vasodilators, drugs for certain hypothesized causes of the disorder, and drugs assumed to enhance metabolism of the brain, or to protect it against various insults. Of the metabolic enhancing drugs, ergoloid mesylates, nafronyl and piracetam are of the greatest current interest. Ergoloid mesylates have been the most extensively studied, but many questions about this drug, such as its mechanism of action, its proper dose, the proper duration of treatment, and the proper goals of treatment, remain unanswered. Symptomatic treatment is essential, both of the sake of patients and those who attend them. Specific treatment is more controversial. If specific treatment is warranted, ergoloid mesylates might be a reasonable first-choice. A number of experimental approaches aimed at enhancing deficient neurotransmission, or remedying deficient neuropeptides, are currently being investigated. Meanwhile, it is realistic to attempt to do the best one can for the afflicted patients.", 
    "18": "Tifluadom, a benzodiazepine with purported opioid receptor-related analgesic properties, was studied in regard to its acute effects on power spectra of the EEG to demonstrate vigilance changes. Additionally, somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEP) were derived to evaluate its effect on the propagation of impulses in sensory nerve fibers. In order to demonstrate stereospecificity, the two enantiomers of tifluadom (KC-5911 and KC-6128) were given in graded doses (20, 40, 80, 160 micrograms/kg i.v.) to awake, unrestrained and trained dogs at 10-min intervals. KC-6128, but not its optical counterpart KC-5911, induced synchronization of the EEG at 20 micrograms/kg with an increase of power (pW) in the delta (1-4 Hz; +300%), theta (4-8 Hz; +450%), and alpha (8-13 Hz +90%) bands. This was accompanied by a reduction of power in the fast beta domain (13-30 Hz; -95%). Vigilance changes were reflected in the beta/delta quotient which dropped from 3.7 (control) to 0.8 (20 micrograms/kg) and to 0.3 (40 micrograms/kg). A further increase in the dose resulted in saturation. At the highest dose (160 micrograms/kg) there was an additional reduction of the beta/delta quotient to 0.1. In order to unmask the receptor population, possibly mediating the observed changes, a benzodiazepine antagonist and opioid antagonists were given. Ro 15-1788 (240 micrograms/kg) had no effect and naloxone (20 micrograms/kg) induced a short term (5 min) arousal. Only the kappa antagonist Mr 2266 (20 micrograms/kg) induced a reversal of the beta/delta quotient back to 5.5. KC-5911 induced an insignificant drop in the beta/delta quotient which was reversed by Ro 15-1788.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "19": "In the present study, the mechanism of the antagonistic action of 0.5 mg/kg diazepam on the analgesic effect of morphine was investigated. While Ro 15-1788, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, was found to partially reverse the inhibitory action of diazepam on morphine analgesia, a chloride channel blocking agent, picrotoxin, produced complete antagonism of the action of diazepam. Furthermore, picrotoxin potentiated the partial antagonistic effect of Ro 15-1788 at a normally ineffective dose to affect the 0.5 mg/kg diazepam-morphine dose-response curve. These overall effects of picrotoxin on the supramolecular GABA receptor complex are discussed.", 
    "20": "Pregnant cats were treated with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, diazepam (DZ; Valium; average dose of 0.4 mg/kg/day, i.m.) between day 20 through day 53 of gestation in an attempt to alter the ontogenesis of the benzodiazepine receptors. As tested in fully developed one-year-old progenies, prenatal exposure to DZ resulted in a behavioral syndrome of hyperactivity, aggressiveness, behavioral signs of chronic anxiety, inability to habituate to novel environment, suppression or absence of the reward-induced alpha-like (7 to 11 Hz) electroencephalographic patterns during operantly conditioned behavior (bar pressing for 1 ml of milk reward), and deficits in the numbers of benzodiazepine receptors in the hypothalamus (-47%), fronto-orbital cortex (-33%) and postcentral cortex (-19%).", 
    "21": "The effect of tofizopam, a 3,4-benzodiazepine (BZ) derivative, in modulating the anticonvulsive action of various drugs was investigated in mice. Electric shock and intravenous infusion of bicuculline were used as convulsive agents. Tofizopam increased the action of clonazepam, diazepam and flunitrazepam against bicuculline. The anticonvulsive effect of diazepam against electroshocks was augmented only slightly. Tofizopam failed to alter the actions of carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, or sodium valproate against either of the convulsive stimuli. Both in vitro and in vivo, tofizopam has been shown to stimulate the binding of 1,4-BZs (e.g., flunitrazepam) to BZ receptors. Similarly, tofizopam enhances the binding of muscimol to GABA receptors. Although several anticonvulsants act on the GABA-BZ receptor complex, tofizopam seems to modify selectively the anticonvulsive action of 1,4-BZs, and this effect is seen better in bicuculline-induced seizures than in electroshocks.", 
    "22": "A low molecular weight fraction of human urine (less than 500 daltons) which both inhibits monoamine oxidase and benzodiazepine binding to central and peripheral receptors has been purified by ethyl acetate extractions, HPLC and thin layer chromatography. This material extracted equally well at acid and basic pH and was insoluble in heptane. It competitively inhibited binding of 3H-clonazepam, a central benzodiazepine receptor agonist and, in addition, displaced 3H-Ro 5-4864, a specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand, from its binding sites. It showed no GABA shift with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, Ro-15 1788. MAO A and B were inhibited approximately equipotently and the material competitively inhibited tyramine oxidation by rat liver. It was stable on boiling and is unlikely to be a peptide.", 
    "23": "Using ultra-filtration steps and HPLC-separation, a low molecular weight ligand of the benzodiazepine receptor was isolated from plasma of various mammalian species including man. The endogenous ligand acts on benzodiazepine receptors agonistically and apparently has a receptor affinity similar to Diazepam. The ligand is not identical with Diazepam as indicated by HPLC and UV-spectroscopy.", 
    "24": "PK 11195, an isoquinoline carboxamide compound with the highest affinity for the peripheral type benzodiazepine binding site has been shown to enhance the humoral response of mice to sheep red blood cells, a T cell dependent antigen. The compound was active when administered i.p. 1 day following immunization. The active doses ranged from 10 ng to 1 mg/kg. Such an immunomodulating activity might be related to the presence of peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites, previously detected on the macrophage.", 
    "25": "Ivermectin enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding was abolished by pretreatment of membranes with 0.05% Triton X-100, whereas GABA-induced enhancement was not changed after this treatment. Ivermectin enhancement was neither affected by picrotoxinin nor dependent on the chloride ion. 4,4'-Diisothiocyano-2,2'-disulfonic acid stilbene (DIDS) dose-dependently reduced [3H]diazepam binding enhanced by 10(-6) M ivermectin, without affecting the basal specific binding. The effects of DIDS were derived from reduction of increased binding affinity of benzodiazepine receptors by ivermectin, but were not dependent on chloride ion in the assay medium. DIDS inhibited GABA- and pentobarbital- but not chloride ion-induced enhancement of [3H]diazepam binding.", 
    "26": "Histochemical studies have shown that GABA-containing nerve terminals impinge upon the chromaffin cells and that approximately 40% of the chromaffin cells store and release GABA. These observations are compatible with the possibility that GABA receptors located on specific populations of chromaffin cells can be activated either by GABA released from nerve terminals or by GABA released from adjacent chromaffin cells. Indeed, experiments with bicuculline indicate that in bovine chromaffin cells in culture and in the adrenal medulla of dog in vivo, the secretion of CA and opioid peptides mediated by activation of nicotinic receptors is under tonic control of GABA. In a series of pharmacological experiments in dog, we have shown that appropriate doses of GABA or other GABA-mimetic drugs release CA into the circulation. This release, comparable in its magnitude to that obtained by injecting a full pharmacological dose of carbamylcholine or by maximally efficient electrical stimulation of the splanchnic nerve, was not blocked by hexamethonium, naloxone or splanchnicotomy, but instead, was prevented by treatment with bicuculline methiodide. These data suggest that GABA-induced CA release is not the consequences of activation of transynaptic mechanisms involving either acetylcholine, enkephalin or GABA acting at the GABAB receptors, but rather the result of stimulation of GABAA receptors linked to C1- channels located on the membranes of the adrenal chromaffin cells. Because the administration of GABA was found to induce depolarization in autonomic mammalian ganglia in electrophysiological studies (DeGroat, 1970), we propose that the GABA-mediated release of CA from dog adrenal medulla is the consequence of chromaffin cell depolarization.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "Brain [3H]diazepam and [3H]L-phenylisopropyladenosine binding sites in caffeine treated (75 mg/kg/day, i.p. 12 days) and caffeine withdrawn (30 days) rats were examined. Treatment with caffeine (75 mg/kg/day) for 12 days increases the Bmax (maximum binding capacity) for [3H]diazepam binding by 30.9% whereas the same treatment increases the Bmax for [3H]L-PIA binding by 165%. The Bmax for [3H]diazepam binding sites returns to slightly below control levels but [3H]L-PIA binding sites remain elevated after 30 days of caffeine withdrawal. These findings suggest that the up-regulation of [3H]diazepam binding sites seen in caffeine treated rats may not be adequately explained by a direct antagonism of caffeine on benzodiazepine receptors. Other modes of interaction therefore must be considered.", 
    "28": "Binding properties of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNZ), [3H]ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate ([3H]beta CCE), [3H]muscimol ([3H]MUSC) and [3H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([3H]GABA) to bovine cortical membranes and to their Triton extracts were studied. GABA, 1 X 10(-5) M, stimulated [3H]FNZ binding of frozen, thawed and washed membranes by an increase in affinity without alteration of the maximal number of binding sites, and this GABA stimulated [3H]FNZ binding can be inhibited by bicuculline methobromide. Freeze, thaw and wash with Triton X-100 removed the low affinity [3H]MUSC binding sites. The ratios of [3H]FNZ binding sites to [3H]beta CCE binding sites and [3H]MUSC binding sites to [3H]GABA binding sites were always found to be about 1:2 in both membranes and soluble extracts. The fact that [3H]beta CCE, after displaced by clonazepam, can be further displaced by unlabelled beta CCE from its binding sites and that a portion of [3H]beta CCE binding sites can be survived from FNZ-photolysis implied that there are at least two subclasses of beta CCE binding sites, one is sensitive to beta CCE only and the other is sensitive to both beta CCE and benzodiazepines (BZs). [3H]GABA, after displaced by MUSC, can be further displaced by unlabelled GABA from its binding sites. The results also support that there are two subclasses of BZ-related GABA binding sites, one is sensitive to GABA only and the other is sensitive to both GABA and MUSC. Furthermore, the decay rates of [3H]beta CCE and [3H]GABA binding activities exposed to various degree of electron bombardment are identical, which is evident that these two binding sites are believed to be functional associated in a macromolecular complex with molecular mass about 220,000 Mr.", 
    "29": "The pyrazoloquinoline CGS 8216, which binds with high affinity to central benzodiazepine recognition sites, produced a highly significant reduction in the consumption of familiar, sweetened milk by non-deprived male rats, when administered in a dose of 20 mg/kg, IP. The anorectic effect was present during the first 5 min period of a 20-min drinking test, and remained in evidence throughout the remainder of the test. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro15-1788, administered 15 min before the consumption test, produced a dose-related (10-40 mg/kg, IP) reversal of the anorectic effect of CGS 8216, during the first 10 min of the test. Injection of Ro15-1788 alone had no significant effect on milk ingestion. This experiment shows that the reduction in the consumption of a palatable liquid food by CGS 8216 can be attributed to an action at benzodiazepine receptors. The result is consistent with the characterization of CGS 8216 as a weak benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist.", 
    "30": "Non-deprived male rats were familiarized with a highly palatable diet until baseline consumption in a 30-min daily access period had stabilised. Stereospecificity of the hyperphagic effect of benzodiazepine receptor agonists was demonstrated using two enantiomers, the (S)-enantiomer being Ro11-3128 (methylclonazepam) and the (R)-enantiomer, Ro11-3624. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonists, Ro15-1788 and CGS 8216, reversed the hyperphagic effect of Ro11-3128. These data confirm the mediation of the hyperphagic effect of benzodiazepines by specific receptors. In further experiments, the effects of the pyrazoloquinolines CGS 9895 and CGS 9896 were examined both alone and also in combination with clonazepam. In doses of 1.25-10.0 mg/kg, neither CGS 9895 nor CGS 9896, when given alone, had a significant effect on the consumption of the palatable diet. Both, however, dose-dependently antagonised the hyperphagic effect of clonazepam. In a test of palatable food consumption, therefore, both compounds can be characterised as benzodiazepine antagonists.", 
    "31": "Low doses (300 micrograms/kg-1.0 mg/kg) of the novel beta-carboline, ZK 91 296, a putative agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, produced a significant increase in the rate of variable-interval self-stimulation responding, similar to that found with typical benzodiazepines. This effect was blocked by simultaneous administration of the specific benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists Ro 15-1788 (2.0 mg/kg), and ZK 93 426 (10 mg/kg). Neither antagonist, ZK 93 426 (100 micrograms/kg-10 mg/kg) or Ro 15-1788 (2.0 mg/kg), had any effect on self-stimulation when given alone. Unlike all benzodiazepine-receptor agonists previously tested, higher doses of ZK 91 296 did not depress self-stimulation response rates, even at a dose-level 100 times greater than the maximally stimulant dose. It is uncertain why ZK 91 296 lacks depressant effects: available evidence does not conclusively favour any single current explanation, but is consistent with it acting as a \"partial\" agonist.", 
    "32": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ) interact with components of neuronal membranes to modify excitability in three different ways. Action at a high affinity central receptor (dissociation constant, KD, of 3 nM) linked to the GABAA recognition site enhances the inhibitory action of GABA by increasing the number of openings of Cl- channels produced by a given concentration of GABA. This effect correlates with anticonvulsant activity as evaluated in the antipentylenetetrazol test in animals and with antimyoclonic activity in human beings. It also correlates with anxiolytic activity. Action at a lower affinity membrane site (KD 100 nM to 1 microM) limits repetitive firing as observed in isolated neurons (in a manner similar to the action of phenytoin or carbamazepine). This does not depend primarily on neurotransmitter mechanisms, but probably involves an increase in the population of sodium channels in the inactive state. Action at a lower affinity site (KD 45 microM) in presynaptic terminals decreases voltage sensitive Ca++ conductance and, by limiting Ca++ entry, decreases neurotransmitter release. The two lower affinity BDZ systems may be responsible for therapeutic action in status epilepticus and for sedative side-effects. The high affinity central benzodiazepine binding sites can be differentiated into BZ1 and BZ2 receptors by ligands (such as triazolopyridazines and Quazepam) that preferentially act on BZ1 sites. There are regional differences in the density of the two receptor subtypes, but these have not yet been correlated with specific actions of benzodiazepines. Differences between various 1,4- and 1,5-benzodiazepines in terms of therapeutic action in epilepsy and neurologic side-effects can probably be explained on the basis of variation in full or partial agonist action at the high affinity central receptor, or differing relative action at the high and low affinity receptors.", 
    "33": "Carpipramine and metapramine inhibited 3H-imipramine binding both added in vitro and administered to the animal. They were inhibitors of NA uptake and they did not modified 5HT uptake. Only carpipramine affected DA release and uptake.", 
    "34": "The muscle relaxant effect of benzodiazepines (BDZ) is widely held to be mediated at central as well as at peripheral level. In this study we report that crude membrane preparations from the myometrium of pregnant women possess binding sites for [3H]-RO 5-4864, specific ligand for the peripheral type of BDZ receptor. Scatchard analysis shows a high affinity binding site (KD = 3.1 +/- 1.2 nM) and a class of low affinity binding sites (KD greater than 30 nM). Displacement experiments show that various BDZ are differently effective in inhibiting [3H]-RO 5-4864 binding: RO 5-4864 greater than diazepam greater than flunitrazepam greater than lorazepam greater than chlordiazepoxide. In conclusion, these data seem to demonstrate that human myometrium possesses specific binding sites of 'peripheral type' for BDZ. It may be suggested that these binding sites are involved in mediating the myometrial relaxant effect exerted by BDZ. Thus, peripherally active BDZ could be used as tocolytic agents, avoiding BDZ central effects.", 
    "35": "The role of platelet activating factor (PAF) and its inhibition by specific receptor antagonists was studied in hypersensitivity reactions in guinea pig lung parenchymal strips and in guinea pigs in vivo. Immunological challenge of isolated lung parenchymal strips with ovalbumin resulted in a contractile response of 184 +/- 16 mg (n = 38). Pretreatment of the strips with a combination of the antihistamine diphenhydramine, the dual lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase product synthesis inhibitor BW-755C, and the PAF receptor antagonist kadsurenone totally inhibited the increase in tension. The bronchoconstrictor effects induced by immunological challenge were also totally inhibited when the leukotriene receptor antagonist FPL-55,712 was used to replace BW-755C or another PAF receptor antagonist, alprazolam was used to replace kadsurenone. Ovalbumin challenge in sensitized guinea pigs in vivo resulted in airway constriction, circulatory failure and an abrupt fall in continuously measured platelet count by 75 +/- 12%, followed by death of all animals within 5-8 min. Pretreatment with diphenhydramine, BW-755C and kadsurenone (or alprazolam) improved survival to 64% (i.e., 7 of 11 animals) compared to a survival rate of 0% (i.e., 0 of 8 vehicle treated controls). Despite the improved survival, the severe thrombocytopenia was unaltered with the combined therapy. PAF, histamine and peptide leukotrienes appear to act in concert in mediating the anaphylaxis-induced airway constriction and circulatory failure in guinea pigs, but are not apparently responsible for the accompanying thrombocytopenia.", 
    "36": "Separate groups of gerbils were trained in a T-maze to discriminate between either: (1) the 1,4-benzodiazepine Ro 11-6896 (1 mg/kg), (2) chlordiazepoxide (25 mg/kg) or (3) ethanol (2,000 mg/kg) and vehicle. Thus, the respective training condition served as a discriminative stimulus guiding choice behavior. A degree of generalization which was enhanced by increasing injection-test intervals occurred between ethanol and the benzodiazepines. Ro 15-1788 markedly attenuated the cue properties of the benzodiazepines, but not that of ethanol. Additional tests in the Ro 11-6896 group showed that this discrimination was stereoselective but not stereospecific in that the isomer Ro 11-6893 generalized to Ro 11-6896 at a dose of 10 mg/kg but not at 1 mg/kg; Ro 15-1788 attenuated this generalization. Diazepam (3 mg/kg) generalized to Ro 11-6896 whereas the structurally related Ro 5-4864 (3 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) did not. In separate tests of open-field activity and temperature recording Ro 15-1788 significantly attenuated the effects of Ro 11-6896 (1 mg/kg) and Ro 11-6893 (10 mg/kg).", 
    "37": "The discriminative stimulus effect of midazolam, a short-acting benzodiazepine, was used for testing the effects of drugs thought to act as antagonists at different sites in the proposed benzodiazepine receptor complex. Rats were trained in a standard two-bar operant conditioning procedure with food reinforcers delivered on a tandem schedule. The 0.4 mg/kg dose of midazolam used for training was well discriminated, typically yielding at least 95% correct responding. The benzodiazepine receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 blocked the discriminative effect of midazolam but did not influence generalization to pentobarbitone (7.5 mg/kg). The indirect GABA antagonist picrotoxin attenuated both generalization to pentobarbitone and its response rate-reducing effect. Picrotoxin had no effect on the discriminative effect of midazolam at 0.4 mg/kg but it blocked the effect of 0.1 mg/kg. Even in doses which reduced overall response rates, nicotine did not block discrimination of midazolam (0.4 mg/kg). The results are consistent with models which postulate a GABA-linked ion channel which is a site of action for barbiturates and which is \"downstream\" of the benzodiazepine receptor itself.", 
    "38": "In a previous work, pinealectomy was found to depress benzodiazepine (BZP) receptor binding in cerebral cortex membranes of rats killed at noon. In order to assess the effect of pineal removal on diurnal variations of BZP binding site concentration and affinity, groups of intact, pinealectomized, or sham-pinealectomized rats (subjected to surgery 2 wk earlier) were killed at six different time intervals during the 24-h cycle. BZP binding was assessed by Scatchard analysis of 3H-flunitrazepam high-affinity binding to cerebral cortex membranes. In intact and sham-pinealectomized rats, a maximum in BZP receptor concentration was found at midnight. Pinealectomy blunted the nocturnal peak of receptor concentration and caused a significant depression of binding site number at noon. No changes in the affinity of the binding sites for the radioligand were detected as a function of time of day or following surgery. In a dose-response experiment for melatonin ability to restore the depressed BZP receptor concentration of cerebral cortex membranes of pinealectomized rats killed at noon, a minimal effective dose of 25 micrograms/kg body weight was obtained. These results further support a link between pineal activity and brain BZP receptors in rats.", 
    "39": "Dibutyryl cyclic GMP (DbcGMP) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DbcAMP) given to rats intracerebellarly in a dose of 200 nmol/head produced electroencephalographic convulsive changes. Intracerebellar (i.c.) administration of lower doses (100 nmol/head) of DbcGMP and DbcAMP and 200 nmol/head of norepinephrine (NE) and glutamate (Glu) facilitated the pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced convulsions. Diazepam (100 nmol/head, i.c.) suppressed the PTZ-induced convulsions. GABA (400 nmol/head, i.c.) did not affect the PTZ-induced convulsions. These results suggest that DbcGMP, DbcAMP and Glu inhibit seizure control mechanisms in the cerebellum, and that one of the sites of the anticonvulsant action of diazepam is located in the cerebellum.", 
    "40": "Nifedipine exhibits a greater incidence of side effects than the other currently marketed calcium channel antagonists. In addition to those effects attributable to calcium channel blockade, nifedipine produces side effects similar to the effects of adenosine. It is probable that nifedipine exerts part of its physiological actions through potentiation of adenosine. Adenosine, an endogenous calcium channel blocker, modifies synaptic events throughout the nervous system and causes sedation, smooth and skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsion, hypotension and hypothermia, all reversible by caffeine or theophylline administration. Nifedipine inhibits adenosine uptake from, and release into, the extracellular space and binds at an adenosine receptor. Both nifedipine and adenosine interact with benzodiazepine binding sites. Interaction between nifedipine and adenosine should be kept in mind when treating patients with nifedipine.", 
    "41": "The review describes properties of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the central nervous system of mammalians. Two pharmacologically different receptors--GABAA and GABAB--are involved into GABA-ergic inhibition. GABA receptors (bicuculline-sensitive) regulate chloride permeability of membranes and can be functionally enhanced by benzodiazepine and barbiturate. GABA receptors (bicuculline-insensitive) are suggested to regulate calcium permeability.", 
    "42": "[3H]diazepam [( 3H]DZ) was used as a ligand to study the effects of Ca2+ on benzodiazepine binding to rat brain membranes. [3H]DZ bound at a single class of binding sites showing KD and Bmax values of 5.4 nM and 852 fmol/mg protein respectively. These values are consistent with previous reports. Amongst the various divalent cations tested Mg2+, Fe2+, Cd2+ and Sr2+ had no significant effect on [3H]DZ binding. Mn2+, Ba2+, Co2+, Ni2+ and La3+ enhanced radioligand binding, whereas Ca2+, Zn2+ and Pb2+ inhibited of [3H]DZ binding by Ca2+ was concentration-dependent. 50% inhibition occurred at a Ca2+ concentration of 5.6 mM. The Hill coefficient for the inhibition was 1.03, displaying noncooperativity. The effect of Ca2+ on [3H]DZ binding could be prevented by La3+ but was not reversed by EGTA. A kinetic analysis of Ca2+ inhibition of [3H]DZ binding indicates that Ca2+ inhibited competitively. Analysis of binding isotherms indicates that both KD and Bmax were altered at the [3H]DZ binding sites. The marked increase in KD value in the presence of Ca2+ (5 mM) can be explained by a drastic increase in the dissociation rate constant. It was suggested that Ca2+ may induce a conformational change in the diazepam binding sites on rat brain membranes. The unchanged Hill coefficient in the presence or absence of Ca2+ indicates that a single population of binding sites was labeled by [3H]DZ. The calmodulin antagonists, trifluoperazine and W-7 were weak inhibitors of [3H]DZ binding.", 
    "43": "The synapse is a major regulatory site that has been implicated in modulating neuronal excitability and seizure discharge. Voltage-dependent calcium (Ca2+) entry at the synapse plays a major role in initiating neurotransmitter release and in regulating synaptic function. Thus, obtaining a molecular understanding of the effects of Ca2+ on synaptic modulation would provide important insights into the regulation of synaptic activity and, possibly, the biochemical basis for some forms of epilepsy. Calmodulin is a major Ca2+-binding protein in brain that has been implicated in mediating many of the second messenger effects of Ca2+ on neuronal function. The evidence implicating calmodulin in modulating synaptic excitability will be presented. Calmodulin was shown to be present at the synapse in association with synaptic vesicles and in the postsynaptic density. In addition, several calmodulin-regulated synaptic biochemical processes have been identified, including Ca2+- and calmodulin-regulated protein phosphorylation, vesicular neurotransmitter release, vesicle-membrane interactions, and neurotransmitter turnover. These results indicate that calmodulin may play an important role in synaptic modulation and provide a molecular approach to investigating the Ca2+ signal in brain. Several anticonvulsants have been shown to regulate some of calcium's effects on neuronal function. These anticonvulsants include phenytoin, carbamazepine, and the benzodiazepines. All of these compounds are effective against maximal electric shock (MES) seizure models in animals. Anticonvulsants were tested on several of the Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated synaptic biochemical systems. The results demonstrate that phenytoin, carbamazepine, and the benzodiazepines were effective in inhibiting calcium calmodulin protein kinase activity in membrane and purified kinase preparations, vesicle neurotransmitter release, vesicle-membrane interactions, and voltage-sensitive calcium uptake in intact synaptosomes. Phenobarbital, ethosuximide, trimethadione, valproic acid, and vinyl gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were not effective in inhibiting these calcium-regulated processes. Thus, the effects of anticonvulsants on calcium-regulated processes were selective to a group of anticonvulsants that had been shown in several electrophysiological systems to antagonize some of the actions of calcium on neuronal excitability. These observations suggested the existence of specific membrane receptors that might mediate the effects of these anticonvulsants on neuronal function through the regulation of calcium-calmodulin-regulated processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "44": "The inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) acts through postsynaptic receptor sites which regulate membrane chloride ion channels. The GABA receptor-ionophore complex also contains modulatory receptor sites for two classes of centrally acting drugs, one for the benzodiazepines, and a second for both barbiturates and related depressants and for picrotoxin and related convulsants. The presence of these drug modulatory sites, directly on the GABA receptor protein, is consistent with other experimental observations; blocking GABA function can cause seizures, and augmenting GABA function can afford protection against seizures. This, and other circumstantial evidence, has suggested the possibility that a functional GABA deficit may be involved in some kinds of human epilepsy. Some neurochemical markers for GABA synapses have been reported to be altered in certain animal models as well as in human temporal lobe epilepsy. We have examined the postsynaptic GABA receptor complex using receptor binding assays for GABA, benzodiazepine (BZ), and barbiturate receptor sites in the seizure-susceptible gerbil, a genetic model of generalized epilepsy. A 30% deficit in BZ receptor binding was observed in the midbrain of seizure-sensitive animals relative to normal controls. This was shown by quantitative brain-slice binding autoradiography to involve a decrease in the number of binding sites in the substantia nigra (SN) and periaqueductal gray regions. A deficit in membrane receptors for BZs (which are linked to a subtype of postsynaptic GABA receptors) in a crucial region of brain might therefore contribute to seizure susceptibility in some kinds of epilepsy.", 
    "45": "A single-blind, randomized, prospective, comparative clinical trial was performed in 90 (30 X 3) pediatric patients, comparing a new water-soluble benzodiazepine, midazolam (Ro 21-3931) and ketamine-air (8 mg . kg-1) by intramuscular or intravenous routes at equipotent dose (0.2 mg . kg-1) with the standard anesthesia technique with diazepam (0.3 mg . kg-1) as an intravenous complement, during anesthesia for diagnostic urological procedures on an out-patient basis. Comparison between the three series of the mean values of maximal variation of hemodynamic parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and heart rate) during maintenance of anesthesia revealed no statistical significant difference in their values. Apnea was not observed in any patient. Local tolerance was excellent after i.v. administration, while good in the ketamine-midazolam i.m. series, 5 patients reported slight pain under pressure at the site of injection 24 hours after the end of anesthesia. No serious adverse reactions were observed in this clinical trial. We concluded that the efficacy of midazolam (Ro 21-3981) was excellent and comparable to that of the standard drug (diazepam), with the added advantage of better tolerance after both the intramuscular and intravenous administration, due to the rapid intramuscular absorption of midazolam, which starts simultaneously with that of ketamine.", 
    "46": "A regional analysis of brain benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptors was conducted in narcoleptic and normal dogs to determine whether these sites are altered in narcolepsy. It was postulated that BDZ receptors play a role in the excessive sleepiness of narcolepsy because activation of these sites in freely behaving normal animals is hypnogenic. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding sites were assessed in 11 discrete areas of the forebrain and brainstem. No consistent or statistically significant group differences in either receptor densities (Bmax) or binding affinities (Kd) were found. These findings do not support the assertion that BDZ receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of canine narcolepsy.", 
    "47": "A number of alcohol research groups have measured anterior and posterior pituitary hormones, the endogenous opiates, CNS peptides, and putative neurotransmitters during alcohol withdrawal. The data are often complex and contradictory, though a number of themes have emerged. Activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is increased during chronic alcohol exposure and appears to remain altered for at least 2 to 4 weeks after cessation of drinking. There is increased turnover of norepinephrine and enhanced binding of CNS adrenergic receptors. By contrast, there are decreases in CNS activity of select endogenous opiates and GABA. Other CNS compounds that may play a role in alcohol withdrawal are prolactin, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), vasopressin, cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophophate (cAMP), Delta-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP), and iron. Despite many studies in humans and animals, the roles of CNS dopamine and serotonin in withdrawal remain unclear. A number of peptides, including cholecystokinin (CCK), neurotensin, and bombesin, have been shown to interact with the CNS actions of alcohol and may play a role in alcohol withdrawal. Inadequate work has been performed on acetylcholine (ACh), human growth hormone (HGH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Studies of the recently identified GABA-benzodiazepine-barbituate receptor complex indicate that this system is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of alcohol withdrawal. Perturbation studies with corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and TRH (with measures of ACTH and cortisol and TSH and prolactin, respectively), may identify patients with withdrawal-related autonomic dysfunction.", 
    "48": "The activity of rats in a holeboard test is reduced 30, 90, and 240 min after treatment with a single dose of lorazepam. The administration of a benzodiazepine antagonist (RO 15-1788) 20 min before the holeboard test (i.e., 10, 70, or 220 min after lorazepam administration) reverses the hypoactivity of animals tested 30 min after treatment with lorazepam, partially reverses the hypoactivity of animals tested 90 min after receiving lorazepam, but is without effect on the hypoactivity observed 240 min after treatment with the benzodiazepine. If, however, RO 15-1788 is given at the same time as lorazepam then it reverses the hypoactivity seen 4 h later. The results of these experiments demonstrate that a benzodiazepine can exert a behavioral effect at a time when it no longer appears to be acting at central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "49": "Ritanserin is a potent and selective serotonin-S2 antagonist which slowly dissociates from the receptor sites, while setoperone has potent serotonin and moderate dopamine antagonistic properties and dissociates rapidly from the receptor sites. Acute administration of ritanserin (1-10 mg/kg) produced a non-competitive inhibition of 3H-ketanserin binding, measured ex vivo in washed frontal cortex membranes, which lasted for 12 h. This is in accordance with the slow dissociation of the drug from the receptor sites. Setoperone (1-10 mg/kg orally) also produced a partially non-competitive inhibition of 3H-ketanserin binding in washed membranes, which is unlike its rapid dissociation. In contrast, there was no inhibition of dopamine receptor binding in washed striatal membranes. Chronic oral administration of 10 mg/kg X day of the drugs significantly reduced the Bmax values of 3H-ketanserin, without changing the KD value when drug-free periods were longer than 1 day. The maximum reduction following 25 days' treatment with 14 mg/kg ritanserin was 50% at 1 day drug-free; the Bmax values gradually returned to the control value in about 12 days. The receptor half-life was calculated to be 3.5 days and the receptor synthesis rate 4 fmoles/mg tissue X day. Ritanserin treatment did not alter radioligand binding to serotonin-S1, alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenergic, dopamine-D2, benzodiazepine and substance P sites. Chronic treatment with setoperone at 10 mg/kg X day, orally, significantly reduced the Bmax value of 3H-ketanserin binding in frontal cortex but treatment with 1 mg/kg X day did not. In contrast, a dose-dependent increase in the number of striatal dopamine-D2 sites was observed, in accordance with the moderate dopamine-antagonistic properties of setoperone. Dopamine-D2 receptor up regulation up to 150% of control values, was maintained at the same level for 9 days, it started to decline 12 days after stopping drug treatment. Following chronic treatment and drug withdrawal for more than 1 day, ritanserin and setoperone levels in whole brain homogenates were below detection level (less than 1 ng/g). The similar reduction in the Bmax values of 3H-ketanserin binding following chronic treatment with the rapidly dissociating setoperone and the slowly dissociating ritanserin, the absence of effect on the KD value, the slow reappearance of the receptor sites and the opposite effect on serotonin-S2 and dopamine-D2 receptors with setoperone suggest that real serotonin-S2 receptor down regulation occurs following antagonist treatment. The findings illustrate the difference in receptor regulation between the serotonergic and the dopaminergic system.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "50": "The effects of the beta-carboline ZK 93426, a putative benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, were investigated in the social interaction test of anxiety and in the holeboard. Like the receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788, ZK 93426 (2.5-10 mg/kg) caused a specific reduction in social interaction (interpreted as an anxiogenic effect) and caused a significant elevation in exploratory head-dipping (5 mg/kg). When low (ineffective) doses of both compounds (1 mg/kg ZK 93426; 4 mg/kg Ro 15-1788) were administered together they significantly reduced social interaction. No further reductions in social interaction were observed when effective doses of both compounds (5 mg/kg ZK 93426; 10 mg/kg Ro 15-1788) were tested in combination; it is likely that this is due to almost total benzodiazepine receptor occupancy at effective doses of either compound. When doses of each compound (5 mg/kg ZK 93426; 10 mg/kg Ro 15-1788) that resulted in stimulation of head-dipping were examined in combination, the elevation in exploration was no longer observed. Since at higher doses of both compounds there is an attenuation of the elevation in head-dipping, it is again likely that the effects of the two compounds are additive.", 
    "51": "The peripheral BDZ receptor ligand Ro 5-4864 was administered to rabbits in doses ranging from 0.2 to 7 mg/kg IV. Changes in electrocortical activity appeared within 1 min after administration, characterized by trains of slow waves in the posterior sensorimotor and optic cortices (0.6-2 mg/kg) and by grand mal seizures (2-10 mg/kg). The low doses also induced alterations in the basic rhythms both of the hippocampus (reduced amplitude and spike-like waves) and of the nucleus ventralis of thalamus (trains of slow waves), not associated with observable behavioural changes. The paroxysmal EEG activity observed at higher doses of the drug was first recorded in the cortical areas and then spread to the subcortical structures. No change in electrical activity could be observed in the spinal cord. The paroxysmal activity was associated with tonic-clonic convulsions and scialorrea. The EEG and behavioural manifestations were inhibited by administration of Ro 15-1788. This drug at doses of 0.6 and 6 mg/kg antagonized the effects of Ro 5-4864 at doses of 0.6-5 mg/kg and 6-7 mg/kg, respectively. This effect began 1-3 min after administration of the antagonist, and led to EEG synchronization. These data suggest that in rabbits the convulsant effect of Ro 5-4864 is due to interference of the drug at the GABA-BDZ-picrotoxin receptor oligomeric complex. Such an effect seems to be mediated at least in part by central BDZ receptors.", 
    "52": "In a first set of experiments rats were trained to run in a straight alley for food reward on a continuous reinforcement schedule and the running response was then extinguished. On the last 2 days of training and daily throughout extinction different groups of animals were injected IP with saline, 5 mg/kg chlordiazepoxide, 0.75 mg/kg picrotoxin, chlordiazepoxide + picrotoxin, chlordiazepoxide + 1.5 mg/kg bicuculline, 0.00125 or 0.25 mg/kg muscimol, 1 mg/kg baclofen, chlordiazepoxide + baclofen, or 0.00125 mg/kg muscimol + baclofen. Chlordiazepoxide increased resistance to extinction, a well-known anxiolytic effect. This effect was blocked by both picrotoxin and bicuculline. Picrotoxin on its own reduced resistance to extinction (an anxiogenic-like effect). Whether given alone or in combination with other drugs, muscimol and baclofen had no effect. In a second set of experiments rats were trained in a successive operant discrimination (signalled by a flashing or steady light) between components in which sucrose reward was available on a variable-interval schedule for barpressing and components in which no reward was given. Chlordiazepoxide at 10 mg/kg increased responding in both rewarded and nonrewarded components, but more in the latter than could be accounted for by change in the former. This effect is as expected with an anxiolytic drug. It was not altered by administration of bicuculline at 1.5 or 1.75 mg/kg; at 2 mg/kg bicuculline acted synergistically with chlordiazepoxide. Picrotoxin (1 and 1.5 mg/kg) also acted synergistically with chlordiazepoxide, enhancing the latter's rate-increasing effects, but only during rewarded components. Neither muscimol (0.00125 and 0.25 mg/kg) nor baclofen (0.01 mg/kg) affected response rates, whether given alone or in combination. However, baclofen in a dose of 1 mg/kg, provided it was given to rats also injected with muscimol (0.00125 or 0.25 mg/kg) at other times, significantly reduced responding during nonrewarded components (an apparently anxiogenic effect). The results of the two sets of experiments are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that anxiolytic drugs affect behaviour by increasing GABAergic inhibition.", 
    "53": "The benzodiazepine (BZ) agonist midazolam, the BZ antagonist Ro 15-1788, and the peripheral BZ binding site ligand Ro 5-4864 have been assessed, separately and in combinations, as to their effect on the active uptake of serotonin (5HT) in human blood platelets in vitro, in an artificial, protein-free medium. Midazolam had a moderate noncompetitive (or mixed competitive/noncompetitive) inhibitory effect on the uptake. This effect was not influenced by Ro 15-1788, which in itself had only a very weak inhibitory effect. Ro 4-5864 showed in several independent experiments (but not always) a biphasic inhibitory effect, with a moderate but significant inhibition in the concentration range of about 10(-8) to 10(-6) M, and a stronger, noncompetitive inhibitory effect above 10(-6) M. When Ro 5-4864 was tested in the presence of a fixed concentration of midazolam (4 X 10(-6) M), the inhibitory effect of the former was markedly reduced (at higher concentrations), eliminated (at intermediate concentrations), or even reversed into a relative stimulatory effect (at low concentrations). Thus, low concentrations of Ro 5-4864 reduced the inhibitory effect of midazolam. A possible explanation of this interaction is that low concentrations of Ro 5-4864 have both an inhibitory and a stimulatory effect on platelet 5HT uptake (often seen to vary in relative strength between experiments), and that the stimulatory component is unmasked in the presence of a drug that already has an inhibitory effect, probably mediated by the same site.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "54": "Flurazepam, a clinically proven and widely accepted sedative hypnotic, has been shown by a number of investigators to produce convulsions at toxic doses. In the present study, CGS-8216, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, reduced the dose of flurazepam required to produce convulsions. This suggests that the convulsant action of FLZ is exerted at a site other than the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "55": "The interactions of taurine and its precursor hypotaurine with the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex were studied by investigating their effects on GABA and flunitrazepam binding in rat brain membranes. Taurine, and to a lesser degree also hypotaurine, displaced the high- and low-affinity GABA binding. The maximal binding capacities of both sites were decreased in the presence of taurine, while the binding constants remained the same, suggesting noncompetitive interactions. Taurine and hypotaurine affected flunitrazepam binding only at a very high concentration (50 mmol/l), whereas GABA (within the concentration range of 0.1-100 mumol/l) significantly enhanced the binding. Taurine inhibited the GABA-stimulated binding dose-dependently. These modulatory effects of taurine on the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex could result from interactions with the GABA recognition site but not from direct actions on the benzodiazepine site.", 
    "56": "The post treatment effects of early prenatal, late prenatal, early postnatal or combined prenatal and neonatal treatment with diazepam on the development of pain sensitivity, acoustic startle responsiveness, and benzodiazepine receptors in the cerebral cortex were investigated in rats between 14 and 90 days of age. Tail-flick latency was significantly decreased by combined prenatal and neonatal and by early prenatal diazepam treatment, but not by diazepam during the last half of gestation or during the neonatal period alone. Acoustic startle response was decreased by either late prenatal or neonatal diazepam treatment, but not by early prenatal treatment alone. Density of benzodiazepine receptors in the cortex was increased from postnatal day 1 to 21 by either early or late prenatal diazepam treatment. Neonatal diazepam treatment suppressed cortical benzodiazepine receptor or development until postnatal day 21; thereafter, receptor density increased to significantly higher values than in controls at 90 days of age. The results demonstrate that diazepam can alter development of pain sensitivity by actions during early gestation, startle responsiveness by actions late in pregnancy, and cortical benzodiazepine receptors by actions throughout gestation and the early postnatal period.",

The study was carried out qualitatively by autoradiography (distribution) and quantitatively by a biochemical technique (number and affinity). As a whole, the characteristics of BZD binding sites were not modified in relation to controls, except for a very slight decrease in affinity of subtype I.", 
    "58": "The effects of certain anticonvulsant agents, namely, valproate, diazepam and phenobarbitone were investigated on catechol-induced spontaneous and evoked convulsions, in anaesthetized rats and mice. Valproate and diazepam significantly reduced the intensity of spontaneous convulsions and the frequency of occurrence of the longer-latency components (M2 and M3) of the evoked muscle response. Phenobarbitone significantly reduced spontaneous convulsions and the M3 component of the evoked muscle response. None of the drugs affected the short latency M1 component indicating a supra-spinal site of action of these drugs. Agents which modify gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated transmission were without effect on the frequency of occurrence of M1, M2 or M3. The results suggest that the convulsant action of catechol is not dependent on antagonism of GABA-mediated inhibition.", 
    "59": "The gamma-aminobutyrate/benzodiazepine-receptor complex has been purified from a Triton X-100 extract of crude synaptic membranes from pig cerebral cortex and cerebellum by a combination of affinity and ion-exchange chromatography. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding activity was purified 2200-fold from cortex with an overall yield of 2%. The dissociation constants for the binding of [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam to the receptor complex were 14 +/- 3 nM and 14 +/- 2 nM respectively. The ratio of [3H]muscimol to [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites was in the range 2.2-2.8. There appeared to be no selective inactivation of either binding site during the purification procedure. Sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis revealed two major polypeptides of Mr 49 000 and 55 000 from both cortex and cerebellum. When the receptor from cortex was photoaffinity labelled with [3H]flunitrazepam, radioactivity was incorporated predominantly into the Mr-49 000 polypeptide, although some radioactivity was detectable in the Mr-55 000 band. The cerebellar receptor was photoaffinity labelled on the 49 000-Mr polypeptide but not on the polypeptide of Mr 55 000. In addition, some radioactivity was detected in a minor polypeptide of Mr 43 000. When purified in the presence of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulphonate the same major polypeptide components (Mr 49 000 and 55 000) were isolated, but the receptor now retained its ability to be modulated by secobarbital and by the anaesthetic propanidid.", 
    "60": "The binding of [3H]muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) receptor agonist, to a membrane preparation from pig cerebral cortex was enhanced by the anaesthetic propanidid in a concentration-dependent manner. At 0 degrees C, binding was stimulated to 220% of control values, with 50% stimulation at 60 microM-propanidid. At 37 degrees C, propanidid caused a more powerful stimulation of [3H]muscimol binding (340% of control values). Propanidid (1 mM) exerted little effect on the affinity of muscimol binding (KD approx. 10 nM), but increased the apparent number of high-affinity binding sites in the membrane by 2-fold. Enhancement of [3H]muscimol binding was observed only in the presence of Cl- ions, half-maximal activation being achieved at approx. 40 mM-Cl-. Picrotoxinin inhibited the stimulation of [3H]muscimol binding by propanidid with an IC50 (concentration causing 50% inhibition) value of approx. 25 microM. The enhancement of [3H]muscimol binding by propanidid was not additive with the enhancement produced by secobarbital. Phenobarbital inhibited the effect of propanidid and secobarbital. The GABA receptor was solubilized with Triton X-100 or with Chaps [3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]propanesulphonate]. Propanidid and secobarbital did not stimulate the binding of [3H]muscimol after solubilization with Triton X-100. However, the receptor could be solubilized by 5 mM-Chaps with retention of the stimulatory effects of propanidid and secobarbital. Unlike barbiturates, propanidid did not stimulate the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to membranes. It is suggested that the ability to modulate the [3H]muscimol site of the GABA-receptor complex may be a common and perhaps functional characteristic of general anaesthetics.", 
    "61": "In experiment 1, rats (n = 12) were trained to discriminate the benzodiazepine (BDZ) compound chlordiazepoxide (CDP, 20 mg/kg, IP) from saline in a two-lever food-reinforced procedure, and subsequently were tested for stimulus control with different doses of CDP, Ro 15-1788 (a proposed BDZ receptor antagonist) and Ro 15-1788 plus 20 mg/kg CDP. Ro 15-1788 (0.63-40 mg/kg) dose-dependently antagonized CDP, and induced predominantly saline appropriate responding when administered alone. Thereafter, the same rats were retrained by progressively decreasing the training dose, to discriminate 2.5 mg/kg CDP from saline, and were tested again with the same compounds. Ro 15-1788 (0.16-40 mg/kg) now failed to antagonize CDP (2.5 mg/kg) and increased the percentage of drug-appropriate responding in a dose-related manner when administered alone. In experiment 2, separate groups of rats (n = 10) were similarly trained to discriminate either 15 or 3 mg/kg CDP from saline. Tests with CDP, Ro 15-1788 and Ro 15-1788 plus CDP (either 15 or 3 mg/kg) yielded similar results to experiment 1, suggesting that the training dose effects on generalization and antagonism of Ro 15-1788 were not affected by the manner in which the lower CDP dose acquired drug stimulus control. It is concluded that mixed agonist-antagonist properties are apparent after variations of the BDZ training dose in a drug discrimination procedure.", 
    "62": "The degeneration of the striato-nigral projection induced by the injection of kainic acid into the striatum produced a 30% increase in the density of type II benzodiazepine binding sites (measured as the proportion of [3H]flunitrazepam which remained after the addition of 2 X 10(-7) M CL 218872). The lesion did not change the number of type I benzodiazepine binding sites (measured using [3H]ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate). The increase of type II benzodiazepine binding sites persisted and was markedly enhanced in the substantia nigra, previously lesioned with kainic acid. In fact, the injection of kainic acid into the nigra caused, 3 weeks after the treatment, a 80% decrease in the total number of type I benzodiazepine binding sites, and no change in the number of type II benzodiazepine binding sites. The density of type II sites increased by 70% following a subsequent injection of kainic acid into the striatum, homolateral to the lesioned substantia nigra. The results suggest that type I benzodiazepine binding sites in the nigra are located on kainic acid-sensitive elements (probably intrinsic neurones), while type II benzodiazepine binding sites, the number of which increased after degeneration of the striato-nigral pathway, are localized on kainic acid-resistant structures (probably axons or terminals) that receive an input from striatal afferents and from interneurones in the nigra.", 
    "63": "The postnatal development of [3H]flunitrazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors has been studied in the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus, frontal cortex and visual cortex of the rat. In the frontal and visual cortices, binding reached the highest level at postnatal day 25 and then decreased slightly until adulthood. In the superior colliculus, the adult value of [3H]flunitrazepam binding is already reached at postnatal day 25, whereas in the retina the highest binding was found at postnatal day 50. The ontogeny of benzodiazepine binding sites in the visual regions does not essentially differ from that in other brain regions, suggesting that the appearance of [3H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the visual system is not correlated with the development of retinal function and the functional maturation of the visual system with regard to processing of light stimuli. Raising rats in complete darkness from birth until the age of 25 days resulted in significantly decreased binding levels in the lateral geniculate nucleus and in the superior colliculus by 29% and 17%, respectively, as compared to controls. [3H]Flunitrazepam binding in the other regions studied was not affected by dark-rearing. Presumably, the complete lack of visual experience interferes with the functional development of GABAergic mechanisms involved in the gating function of the subcortical visual centres for visual information transfer.", 
    "64": "Positron emission tomography (PET) makes it possible for the first time to examine in living humans the chemistry of the brain, which relates the structures of the brain to the functions of the mind. PET scans make it possible to assess the state of neurotransmitter receptors, such as the dopamine, serotonin, muscarinic cholinergic, opiate, and benzodiazepine receptors, in different regions in normal persons and patients with neuropsychiatric diseases. One of the most striking findings to date is that dopamine receptors fall significantly between the ages of 19 and 73 years, to a greater degree in men than in women. The effects of neurotropic drugs, such as haloperidol and methadone, can be assessed in an individual patient, providing for the first time an objective indicator of the specific desired effects of such drugs in the treatment of nervous or mental disease. Studies of patients with diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disease, and schizophrenia are in progress. At present, the patients are being examined as part of research protocols, but it is likely that clinical trials will not be far off.", 
    "65": "The imidazodiazepine Ro 15-1788 is a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist that was initially reported to be lacking in intrinsic activity in a variety of test situations in which benzodiazepine-like effects can be identified. However, many recent studies have shown that this compound does indeed have intrinsic activity in a variety of behavioural, neurological, electrophysiological and biochemical preparations in both animals and man. The purpose of the present review is firstly to describe these intrinsic actions, and secondly to consider to what extent these intrinsic actions of Ro 15-1788 have implications for current concepts of the functioning of the benzodiazepine receptor.", 
    "66": "Behavioral effects of the putative endogenous benzodiazepine receptor ligand, inosine, were studied alone and in combination with the benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788. Keypeck responses were maintained by food under a multiple fixed-interval 3-min, fixed-interval 3-min schedule of food delivery. Under the multiple schedule, the first response after 3 min produced food in the presence of either white (no punishment) or red keylights and, in addition, each 30th response produced a brief electric shock (punishment) when the keylight was red. Inosine increased the low rates of punished responding (10-100 mg/kg IM) and the higher rates of unpunished responding (30 mg/kg). The benzodiazepine antagonist Ro 15-1788 (0.03 mg/kg, IM) antagonized the rate-increasing effects of inosine but had no effect when given alone. Combinations of inosine (30 mg/kg) with higher doses of Ro 15-1788 (0.1-1 mg/kg) decreased responding much like Ro 15-1788 alone. The marked rate-decreasing effects of 1000 mg/kg inosine were not affected by concurrent administration of Ro 15-1788 (0.01-1 mg/kg). The behavioral effects of inosine alone resembled effects of benzodiazepines but not those of benzodiazepine antagonists. The response rate-increasing effects of inosine may be due to its benzodiazepine receptor binding properties, whereas the rate decreases produced by higher doses of inosine appear to be unrelated to benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "67": "Benzodiazepine binding sites in mice forebrain and kidney homogenate were labelled either in vivo (SC injection) or in vitro by 3H-flunitrazepam. The binding in both cases was carried out in vitro in the presence or absence of 10 microM unlabelled flunitrazepam during 60 min at 0 degrees C. When benzodiazepine binding sites were labelled in vivo pretreatment of animals with muscimol (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg, IP) and fenibut (25 and 100 mg/kg, IP) in a dose-dependent manner facilitated 3H-flunitrazepam binding both in mice forebrain and kidneys. In vitro labelling of benzodiazepine binding sites demonstrated similar to in vivo labelling in forebrain but not in kidneys. The peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites in kidneys are therefore modulated similarly to benzodiazepine binding sites in forebrain by GABA-ergic drugs.", 
    "68": "The effects of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor agonists muscimol and baclofen were investigated on the secretion of GH, LH, ACTH and TSH from the anterior pituitary in vitro using a rapid superfusion system. A bicuculline-sensitive stimulatory effect of muscimol was demonstrated on the secretion of GH, LH and ACTH but not TSH. Baclofen had no effect on the basal secretion of any of the hormones, but inhibited LH-releasing hormone-stimulated release of LH and K+- and Ba2+-stimulated release of ACTH. The benzodiazepine Roll-6896 and the barbiturate secobarbital were found to potentiate the effect of muscimol on GH secretion. These results demonstrate the presence of GABAA receptors on somatotrophs, gonadotrophs and corticotrophs, and the presence of GABAB receptors on gonadotrophs and corticotrophs. Thyrotrophs appear devoid of GABA receptors.", 
    "69": "We examined the effects of age on kindled seizure development, benzodiazepine receptor binding, and kindled seizure-induced increases of benzodiazepine receptor binding. The results disclosed that: development of kindling required greater numbers of stimulations in middle-aged than in young-adult animals; in comparison to young-adult animals, middle-aged animals exhibited increased benzodiazepine receptor binding in the dentate gyrus of hippocampal formation: and no age-related differences existed in the effects of seizures on benzodiazepine receptor binding. We suggest that senescence-related impairment of kindling development is due at least in part to alterations in the hippocampus, and that the increased benzodiazepine receptor binding in dentate gyrus may be one of the factors responsible for this impairment.", 
    "70": "Fifteen-day chronic stress with randomized footshock reinforcement (group 4) causes profound steady disturbances in the animal behavior. With the use of regular aversive reinforcement in the shuttle-box the rats were divided into two groups: \"escaping\" (group 2) and \"non-escaping\" (group 3). Minor behavioral disturbances were observed in group 2, moderate in group 3 and maximum in group 4. In the latter group \"down-regulation\" of beta-adrenoceptors and benzodiazepine receptors was observed. The receptor changes appear to be rather the result of psychogenic factors caused by randomized reinforcement than of physical stress as such.", 
    "71": "Piracetam at a concentration of 10(-6) M was shown to behave as a noncompetitive inhibitor of 3H-imipramine specific binding to rat brain membranes. At the same time piracetam failed to influence specific binding of 3H-mianserin to membranes of guinea-pig cerebellum, which is indicative of its inability to suppress histamine H1 receptors, a component of 3H-imipramine specific binding sites. At a concentration of 10(-4) M piracetam does not change specific binding of 3H-flunitrazepam to rat hippocampal membranes in the absence of GABA, but in the presence of 5 X 10(-5) M GABA, like atypical tranquilizer mebicar, acts as a competitor of 3H-flunitrasepam binding. Though Ro-15 1788 did not suppress anxyolytic piracetam (and mebicar) effect, our results give evidence of a possible involvement of GABA-benzodiazepine supramolecular complex in the anxiolytic activity of piracetam.", 
    "72": "The present work, involving clinical, behavioral, and biochemical studies, was undertaken to elucidate the probable mechanism of the observed antianxiety effects of cannabis. The population for the clinical study consisted of 50 male chronic cannabis users who were otherwise healthy and 50 matched controls. When evaluated on Taylor's Manifest Anxiety Scale (TMA), these subjects had low anxiety scores as compared with the controls. To explore the possible interaction of cannabis with the benzodiazepine receptors, behavioral and biochemical studies in mice were devised, involving acute and chronic cannabis administration. Behavioral study revealed that mice under chronic cannabis treatment scored significantly higher on foot shock-induced aggression, but this was significantly blocked by benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Furthermore, chronic cannabis treatment significantly (p less than 0.001) increased the frequency of licking response periodically punished by shocks. This confirms the antianxiety effect of cannabis, which also appears to be mediated through a benzodiazepine receptor, as it was reduced significantly (p less than 0.001) by a benzodiazepine receptor blocker. Specific 3H-diazepam binding was carried out in frontal cortex to assess both the population and affinity of benzodiazepine receptors. Our results indicate that acute cannabis treatment has no significant effect, whereas chronic cannabis treatment significantly increased 3H-diazepam binding as compared with controls. Scatchard analysis further reveals that increased affinity is responsible for increased binding to these receptors. It is therefore our contention that the antianxiety effect of cannabis is mediated through central benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "73": "The syntheses of the 5 beta and 5 alpha epimers of trans-(4a alpha,8a beta)-decahydroquinoline-5-carboxylic acids (3 and 4) from vinylogous bicyclic imide 10 are described. The reduction of trans-5-(1,3-dithian-2-ylidene)octahydro-2(1H)-quinolinone (13) to afford the 5 alpha-(1,3-dithian-2-yl) compound 16 was a key step in the synthesis of trans-4 while hydroboration-H2O2 treatment of phenylmethyl trans-octahydro-5-methylene-1(2H)-quinolinecarboxylate (21) to afford the 5 beta-hydroxymethyl compound 22 was a key step in the synthesis of 3. These trans diastereomers 3 and 4 and the previously prepared cis analogues 1 and 2 were investigated for their ability to interact with GABAA and GABAB receptors and picrotoxin binding sites as well as with neuronal GABA transport systems in brain tissue. Like 1 and 2, tonic-clonic seizures were induced when trans-3 or -4 were administered to mice intracerebroventricularly. Only trans-4 weakly inhibited [3H]GABA binding to GABAA and GABAB receptors in vitro. Large doses (10 mg/kg) of diazepam reversed the convulsant activity of both trans-3 and trans-4. Although trans-3 is the more potent convulsant, trans-4 may have GABA antagonist activity in vivo. However, none of the decahydroquinoline diastereomers have a pronounced effect on GABA receptors that can currently be studied in vitro. Results obtained in vivo lead us to propose that these diastereoisomers may serve as unique conformational probes relating certain zwitterionic topographies to stimulatory activity in the central nervous system.", 
    "74": "Regional differences in downregulation of brain benzodiazepine receptors were studied using a quantitative autoradiographic method. Rats were given a 4-week flurazepam treatment known to cause tolerance and receptor downregulation. A second group of rats was given a similar treatment, but for only 1 week. A third group was given a single acute dose of diazepam to produce a brain benzodiazepine-like activity equivalent to that found after the chronic treatment. Areas studied included hippocampal formation, cerebral cortex, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, dorsal geniculate nucleus, lateral amygdala and lateral hypothalamus. There was a regional variation in the degree of downregulation after 1 week of flurazepam treatment, ranging from 12% to 25%. Extending the flurazepam treatment to 4 weeks caused little further downregulation in those areas studied, except for the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, which showed a 13% reduction in [3H]flunitrazepam binding after 1 week and a 40% reduction after 4 weeks of treatment. In a few areas, such as the lateral hypothalamus, no significant change in binding was found after 4 weeks. Acute diazepam treatment caused no change in binding. This latter finding as well as results obtained during the development of the methodology show that downregulation was not an artifact due to residual drug content of brain slices. The regional variations in degree and rate of downregulation suggest areas that may be most important for benzodiazepine tolerance and dependence and may be related to the varying time courses for tolerance to different benzodiazepine actions.", 
    "75": "The binding of [3H]Ro 5-4864, a specific ligand for \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine binding sites and [3H]Ro 15-1788, a specific ligand for the central benzodiazepine receptors, was determined in subcellular fractions of rat brain. As previously reported, the highest levels of \"peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine binding sites and benzodiazepine receptors were found in the crude P1 and P2 fractions, respectively. Purification of these crude fractions revealed that high levels of both [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding were present in the mitochondrial and synaptosomal fractions. In contrast, the purified nuclei and myelin contained low levels of both [3H]Ro 5-4864 and [3H]Ro 15-1788 binding.", 
    "76": "The postnatal development of several proteins irreversibly labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam in membranes from rat cerebral cortex was investigated. It was demonstrated that in the early postnatal days proteins with apparent molecular weights 55,000 and 59,000 were predominantly labeled whereas irreversible labeling of a protein with apparent molecular weight 51,000 started to predominate only in the second postnatal week. Irreversible labeling of another protein with apparent molecular weight 62,000 was weak throughout development. All these proteins seem to be associated with central benzodiazepine receptors. Irreversible labeling at various time points after birth seems to parallel the postnatal development of these proteins, and the different time course of development and different binding properties of the individual proteins support the hypothesis that these proteins are associated with separate and distinct benzodiazepine receptor subtypes. The pharmacological properties of the individual receptor subtypes seem to be fully developed in the early postnatal days, and therefore newborn animals seem to be a good model system for the investigation of properties and function of these various benzodiazepine receptor subtypes."
