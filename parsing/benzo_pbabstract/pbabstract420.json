    "0": "Three cases are presented. Withdrawal symptoms and ultimately psychosis developed in two cases following cessation of the hypno-sedative zolpidem. Two cases involve dependence upon and abuse of the drug; in one, a well-known alcoholic, it was abused in combination with alcohol, the other had prior well-known dependence on sedative hypnotics. One patient had chronic dysphoria and one encephalopatia toxica. Adverse effects such as withdrawal symptoms, dependence and abuse have not previously been reported in relation to zolpidem. Chemically unrelated to benzodiazepines, zolpidem is thought to have fewer adverse effects, but shares a pharmacokinetic profile with the benzodiazepine triazolam. It is advised that normal criteria for the prescription of benzodiazepines also be used when prescribing non-benzodiazepine sedatives and hypnotics, as they act upon the same receptor, namely the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride complex.", 
    "1": "Anthramycin and tomaymycin are potent antitumor antibiotics belonging to the pyrrolo[1,4]-benzodiazepine [P[1,4]B] group. Their potent biological effects are thought to be due to their ability to react with DNA within the minor groove, forming covalent adducts through the N2 of guanine with the drug molecules overlapping with a 3-4 bp region. In spite of their small molecular weights, the P[1,4]B's show a surprising degree of sequence selectivity, with 5'-PuGPu sequences being the most reactive and 5'-PyGPy sequences being the least reactive [Hertzberg, R. P., Hecht, S. M., Reynolds, V. L., Molineux, I. J., & Hurley, L. H. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 1249-1258]. It has been proposed that inherent DNA flexibility may be one important component of the sequence recognition process for P[1,4]B bonding to DNA, and in this regard, molecular modeling studies are reflective of the experimentally determined hierarchy of bonding sequences [Zakrzewska, K., & Pullman, B. (1986) Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 4, 127-136]. In this study, we have used chemical and enzymatic probes (hydroxyl radical, DNase I) to evaluate drug- and sequence-dependent changes in DNA-adduct conformation, gel electrophoresis to measure drug-induced bending in DNA, and HPLC to measure the reaction kinetics of anthramycin bonding to different sequences. The results show that tomaymycin bonding to DNA induces greater conformational changes in the DNA (i.e., bending and associated narrowing of the minor groove) than anthramycin. In addition, we find that within each drug species (i.e., tomaymycin or anthramycin), sequence specificity correlates with the degree of bending and reaction kinetics such that those sequences with the highest sequence selectivity produce more bending of DNA and react faster with DNA and vice versa. On the basis of these results, we propose that sequence-dependent conformational flexibility may be an important factor in determining the hierarchy of bonding sequences for the P[1,4]B's.", 
    "2": "The neuroprotective potential of eliprodil (SL 82.0715), an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist acting at the polyamine modulatory site, in brain trauma was examined in a rat model of lateral fluid-percussion brain injury. The volume of the lesion was assessed histologically by measuring, at 7 days post-injury, the area of brain damage at 10 coronal planes. Eliprodil (10 mg/kg i.p.) when given 15 min, 6 h and 24 h after fluid percussion (1.6 atm) and then b.i.d. for the following 6 days, reduced by 60% the volume of cortical damage. A similar neuroprotection was obtained when the first administration of eliprodil was delayed by up to 12 h after the brain insult. Moreover, when the treatment with this compound was started at 18 h post-injury, cortical damage was still significantly reduced by 33%. Autoradiographic studies showed that eliprodil treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p.), initiated 15 min after the trauma, also caused a marked reduction of the loss of the neuronal marker omega 1-2 (central benzodiazepine) binding sites and of the increase in the glial/macrophage marker peripheral type benzodiazepine binding sites in the cerebral cortex. In contrast, dizocilpine (a blocker of the cationic channel coupled to the NMDA receptor) when administered 6 h and 24 h after fluid percussion and then b.i.d. for the following 6 days induced a non significant reduction of the volume of the lesion at the highest tolerated dose (0.6 mg/kg i.p.). These results demonstrate the neuroprotective activity of eliprodil in experimental brain trauma using neuropathology as an endpoint and indicate that there is a very large time window for therapeutic intervention, consistent with the delayed nature of the neuronal loss, in this condition.", 
    "3": "Three new site-directed irreversible (wash-resistant) ligands for the high-affinity phencyclidine (PCP) binding site associated with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor were synthesized and their binding characteristics were studied. (+)-3- And (+)-2-isothiocyanato-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycl ohepten-5,10 - imine hydrochloride ((+)-8a,b.HCl) were prepared in four steps from the corresponding nitro derivatives (+)-4a,b, which were obtained by nitration of (+)-3 (MK-801). In the same way the optical antipode (-)-8a.HCl was synthesized from (-)-3. At a concentration of 100 nM, the 3-isothiocyanate derivative (+)-8a irreversibly labeled approximately 50% of the (+)-[3H]-3 binding sites, compared to 20 microM needed for its optical antipode (-)-8a and the 2-isothiocyanate (+)-8b. The apparent Ki values for reversible inhibition of (+)-[3H]-3 binding by (+)- and (-)-8a and (+)-8b were 37,838, and 843 nM, respectively. In contrast, metaphit (1b) and etoxadrol m-isothiocyanate (2b), two previously reported irreversible ligands for the PCP binding site, label about 50% of the (+)-[3H]-3 binding sites at 100 microM and 250 nM, respectively, with apparent Ki values for reversible inhibition of 535 and 94 nM. Compound (+)-8a is also a selective affinity ligand, displaying little or no irreversible in vitro affinity at 100 microM for opioid, benzodiazepine, muscarinic, and dopamine receptors. At a 25 microM concentration, (+)-8a caused an irreversible 52% reduction of binding to sigma 1-receptors. Compound (+)-8a is the most potent known electrophilic affinity label for the PCP binding site. Its potency and selectivity should enable it to be a valuable tool for the elucidation of the structure and function of the NMDA receptor-associated PCP binding site in the mammalian central nervous system.", 
    "4": "This study examined whether the antinociception produced by glutamatergic stimulation of neurons in the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) or nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis pars alpha (NGCp alpha) is mediated by activation of GABAA receptors in the spinal cord. Two approaches were used. The first approach determined the ability of intrathecally (i.t.) administered bicuculline, a competitive GABAA receptor antagonist, to attenuate the antinociception produced by microinjection of L-glutamate in the NRM or NGCp alpha. Bicuculline was selected on the basis of an initial study that determined that 0.3 micrograms i.t. bicuculline caused a 3.4-fold rightward shift in the dose-effect relationship of the i.t.-administered GABAA agonist, isoguvacine, without producing allodynia or alterations in nociceptive threshold. The GABAA antagonist SR 95531 was judged unsuitable because it caused only a modest 1.7-fold rightward shift in the dose-effect relationship of isoguvacine at doses that did not produce allodynia. The second approach determined the ability of i.t. administered diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, to enhance the antinociception produced by microinjection of L-glutamate in these nuclei. Diazepam was selected because of its ability to enhance the actions of GABA at the GABAA receptor. Rats were pretreated with i.t. administration of 0.3 micrograms bicuculline, 40 micrograms diazepam, or vehicle, after which 30 nmol L-glutamate was microinjected into the NRM or NGCp alpha. Microinjection of L-glutamate into the NRM or NGCp alpha in vehicle-pretreated rats significantly increased tail flick latency. The antinociception produced by microinjection of L-glutamate in the NGCp alpha was antagonized by bicuculline and enhanced by diazepam. In contrast, the antinociception evoked from sites in the NRM was only partially attenuated by bicuculline and was not enhanced by diazepam. In an ancillary experiment, i.t. administration of 0.3 micrograms bicuculline or 40 micrograms diazepam did not alter tail skin temperature or nociceptive threshold, suggesting that their effects on glutamate-induced antinociception were not secondary to alterations in tail skin temperature. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that the antinociception produced by activation of neurons in the NGCp alpha, but not the NRM, is mediated in part by an action of GABA at GABAA receptors in the spinal cord.", 
    "5": "In the present study we have characterized the time-course of the histopathological and biochemical alterations resulting from mechanical brain injury caused by lateral fluid percussion centered over the parietal cortex in the rat. The injury device used was an HPLC pump coupled to a solenoid valve which delivered a constant and short lasting (10 ms) impact pressure (1.6 atm). This traumatic procedure resulted in an accumulation of blood in the subarachnoid space and cortical edema at 4-24 h post-trauma. From 4 h after injury, cortical neurons exhibited a pathologic appearance and phagocytic cells invaded the brain parenchyma. At 3 and 7 days post-injury, complete neuronal loss was observed in the parietal cortex around the impact site. In the ipsilateral cortex, the time-course of histologically assessed neuronal loss and phagocytic/glial activation paralleled the time-course of the loss of omega 1-2 (benzodiazepine) sites (a neuronal marker) and of the increase in p sites (peripheral-type benzodiazepine binding sites; a glial/macrophage marker). Neuronal loss and increase in the density of the glial/macrophage biochemical marker were also observed in the hippocampus but not in the contralateral cortex or in other subcortical structures, suggesting a selective vulnerability of the hippocampus to this traumatic procedure. There was a very good spatial correlation between the histological alterations and the changes in the density of the neuronal and glial/macrophage biochemical markers (as assessed by autoradiography). The volume of the lesion, integrated from the surface of the lesion measured at 10 coronal levels cut at a 1 mm interval and stained with haemalum and eosin, represented 32.9 +/- 1.7 mm3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Convulsive status epilepticus is an emergency that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The outcome largely depends on etiology, but prompt and appropriate pharmacological therapy can reduce morbidity and mortality. Etiology varies in children and adults and reflects the distribution of disease in these age groups. Antiepileptic drug administration should be initiated whenever a seizure has lasted 10 minutes. Immediate concerns include supporting respiration, maintaining blood pressure, gaining intravenous access, and identifying and treating the underlying cause. Initial therapeutic and diagnostic measures are conducted simultaneously. The goal of therapy is rapid termination of clinical and electrical seizure activity; the longer a seizure continues, the greater the likelihood of an adverse outcome. Several drug protocols now in use will terminate status epilepticus. Common to all patients is the need for a clear plan, prompt administration of appropriate drugs in adequate doses, and attention to the possibility of apnea, hypoventilation, or other metabolic abnormalities.", 
    "7": "The interaction of omega (benzodiazepine) modulatory drugs with transiently expressed alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 forms of the rat GABAA receptor was investigated using [3H]flumazenil as a probe in in vitro radioligand binding assays. The imidazopyridines alpidem and zolpidem exhibited pronounced selectivity for the alpha 1- compared to the alpha 5-containing construct, whereas omega (benzodiazepine) site modulatory compounds from other chemical series including diazepam, tetrazepam, zopiclone, triazolam, bretazenil and midazolam behaved as relatively non-selective drugs. In the presence of 10 microM gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) the potencies of diazepam, flunitrazepam and midazolam to inhibit [3H]flumazenil binding to the alpha 1-construct were increased 3 to 5 fold, whereas with 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate methyl ester a 2.5-fold reduction in potency was observed. Similar modulatory effects of GABA were obtained with these drugs, using the alpha 5-construct. We suggest that these GABA shift determinations of [3H]flumazenil binding can be used as a rapid test to evaluate the intrinsic activities of omega modulatory compounds.", 
    "8": "Concentration-dependent effects of benzodiazepine receptor ligands were examined on nonequilibrium binding of t-butylbicyclophosphoro[35S]thionate (TBPS, 20 min of incubation at 25 degrees C) to synaptosomal membranes of rat cerebral cortex. Benzodiazepine receptor occupancies were calculated from the displacing potencies of the ligands determined for [3H]flumazenil binding under identical conditions. Greater maximal enhancing (i.e. accelerating) effects of the full agonists diazepam and flunitrazepam on [35S]TBPS binding were reached at lower occupancies of benzodiazepine receptors than the smaller enhancing effects of the partial agonists bretazenil and the beta-carboline ZK 91296. Similarly, the maximal decreasing effect of the full inverse agonist methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM) on TBPS binding was reached at lower occupancy than that of the partial inverse agonist FG 7142. Half-maximal effects on TBPS binding corresponded to about 20-30% occupancies for the full agonists and DMCM, while for partial agonists and FG 7142 they exceeded 60-80% occupancies. Different (concave versus convex) shapes of the occupancy-effect curves can also differentiate partial from full agonists and inverse agonists. The results suggest that different pharmacological efficacies of benzodiazepine receptor ligands are associated with differences in coupling between benzodiazepine and convulsant binding sites to modulate the chloride ionophores.", 
    "9": "Participation of muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors in the modulation of long-term potentiation (LTP) was studied in the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse of guinea pig hippocampal slices. The magnitude of tetanus-induced LTP was attenuated in the presence of 0.01-0.1 microM carbachol, at which concentration the pre-tetanus amplitude of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) was not affected. The attenuation of LTP by the low concentration of carbachol was reversed by an M2 muscarinic antagonist, AF-DX 116, but not by an M1 antagonist, pirenzepine. On the contrary, a high concentration (10 microM) of carbachol decreased the pre-tetanic amplitude of fEPSP, however, the magnitude of LTP was significantly larger than that in control slices in which pre-tetanic amplitude of fEPSP was reduced to the level of carbachol-treated slices by reducing the intensity of stimulation or extracellular Ca2+ concentration. The augmentation of LTP by 10 microM carbachol was blocked by pirenzepine but not by AF-DX 116. These results suggest that the synaptic plasticity in the guinea pig hippocampal mossy fiber-CA3 synapse is inhibited and facilitated by muscarinic agonist through muscarinic M2 and M1 receptors to inhibit and facilitate the LTP, respectively.", 
    "10": "An assay has been developed (restriction endonuclease digestion assay--RED100) based on inhibition of the restriction endonuclease BamHI that is capable of quantitative evaluation of the relative DNA-binding affinity of pyrrolo[2,1-c] [1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) antitumour antibiotics. This method provides comparable results to those obtained from thermal denaturation and ethidium bromide displacement assays but is much more sensitive, discriminating between molecules of similar structure such as DC-81, iso-DC-81 and neothramycin. The results reveal a trend between relative DNA-binding affinity and in vitro cytotoxicity for the PBDs in two tumour cell lines studied.",

A 200-microliters plasma sample was directly injected into a precolumn filled with TSK-gel PW. After a washing step with potassium phosphate buffer, the retained substances were backflushed into a reversed-phase column with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-phosphate buffer-diethylamine. Various drugs frequently co-administered with clobazam or diazepam do not interfere with the determination.", 
    "12": "Intrinsic protein fluorescence of reverse transcriptases from HIV-1 and HIV-2 provides a sensitive signal for monitoring the interaction of the enzymes with primer/template duplex molecules. Kd values for 18/36-mer DNA/DNA duplexes were found to be in the range of a few nanomolar (about 3 times higher for the enzyme from HIV-2 than for that from HIV-1). The quenching of protein fluorescence induced on binding primer/template, together with an increase in extrinsic fluorescence on interaction with primer/template containing a fluorescent nucleotide at the 3'-end of the primer, was used to investigate the kinetics of interaction with reverse transcriptase from HIV-1. The results can be explained in terms of a two-step binding model, with a rapid diffusion-limited initial association (k(ass) = ca. 5 x 10(8) M-1 s-1) followed by a slow isomerization step (k = ca. 0.5 s-1). These (forward) rate constants are increased in the presence of a non-nucleoside inhibitor (S-TIBO) of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, while the reverse rate constant for the second step is decreased, leading to an increase in affinity between the enzyme and primer/template by a factor of at least 10 when S-TIBO is bound. The results are discussed in terms of present knowledge of the structure of reverse transcriptase.",

In contrast, only three (1%) of the 492 first time recipients of benzodiazepines had requested a prescription and were not seen by the general practitioner. Women (43/96; 45%) aged 45-64 years received their first prescription for benzodiazepines almost twice as often as men (15/63; 24%) without symptoms or a diagnosis being an indication (female to male relative risk 1.88 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 3.08)).",

    "20": "Previous investigations have indicated that the measurement of omega 3 (peripheral-type benzodiazepine) binding site densities could be of widespread applicability in the localization and quantification of neural tissue damage in the central nervous system. In the first step of the present study, the suitability of this approach for the assessment of soman-induced brain damage was validated. Autoradiographic study revealed marked increases of omega 3 site densities in several brain areas of convulsing rats 2 days after soman challenge. These increases were well-correlated with the pattern and the amplitude of neuropathological alterations due to soman and closely related to both glial reaction and macrophage invasion of the lesioned tissues. We then used this marker to assess, in mouse hippocampus, the neuroprotective activity against soman-induced brain damage of NBQX and TCP which are respective antagonists of non-NMDA and NMDA glutamatergic receptors. Injection of NBQX at 20 or 40 mg/kg 5 min prior to soman totally prevented the neuronal damage. Comparatively, TCP had neuroprotective efficacy when administered at 1 mg/kg 5 min prior to soman followed by a reinjection 1 h after. These results demonstrate that both NBQX and TCP afford a satisfactory neuroprotection against soman-induced brain damage. Since it is known that the neuropathology due to soman is closely seizure-related, the neuroprotective activities of NBQX and TCP are discussed in relation with the respective roles of non-NMDA and NMDA receptors in the onset and maintenance of soman-induced seizures.", 
    "21": "Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) was found to be less expressed in the immature phagocytic HL-60 and U-937 cell lines than in the more mature monocytic THP-1 cell line. Cell differentiation by several agents induced a strong enhancement of PBR density on these three phagocytic cell lines but not on the lymphocytic CEM cell line. Detailed analysis of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-treated THP-1 cells showed an increased PBR expression and the rise came along with an increase of CD11a and CD11b antigens and a secretion of macrophagic cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta and IL-8. Quantitation of mRNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique showed that overexpression of PBR did not parallel mRNA expression, indicating a gene-independent regulation. These results suggest that PBR predominance on phagocytic cells could be related to maturation process.", 
    "22": "Interactions between the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic system and the dopaminergic and cholinergic systems in the control of jaw movements, measured with a phototransducer system, were investigated in both dorsal and ventral regions of the rat striatum. Muscimol (25 and 50 ng/0.2 microliters) injected into the dorsal striatum did not affect jaw movements induced by apomorphine (0.2 mg/kg i.v.) or pilocarpine (4 mg/kg i.v.), but when injected into the ventral striatum it inhibited these jaw movements and those induced by carbachol (1 micrograms/0.2 microliters) injected into the ventral striatum. Picrotoxin (250 and 500 ng/0.2 microliters) injected into the dorsal striatum enhanced the effects of apomorphine (0.2 mg/kg) but not those of pilocarpine. When injected into the ventral striatum, picrotoxin did not affect apomorphine-induced oral movements but enhanced the effects of pilocarpine and carbachol. The benzodiazepine, flunitrazepam (100 ng/0.2 microliters), had no effect when injected in the dorsal striatum, and showed some inhibitory effects on dopaminergic and cholinergic oral movements when injected in the ventral striatum. The results suggest that the striatal GABAergic inhibitory effect on dopaminergic and cholinergic function is regionally specific, supporting a dorsal/ventral functional division of the rat striatum. The results also suggest that oral movements induced by dopaminergic and cholinergic drugs are distinct forms of repetitive oral behaviour.", 
    "23": "Effects of diazepam on the neuromuscular transmission blocked by neostigmine were studied in isolated mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. Diazepam, in the absence of neostigmine, had no significant effect on the neuromuscular transmission at concentrations lower than 100 microM, except to enhance muscle contractility. Single and train pulses-evoked endplate potentials (e.p.p.s) and miniature e.p.p.s (m.e.p.p.s) were also unaffected. At concentrations of 175 microM or higher, diazepam caused an axonal conduction block. However, neostigmine-induced twitch potentiation, spontaneous fasciculation and tetanic fade were antagonized by diazepam at 3.5-35 microM. Diazepam did not decrease the amplitude of neostigmine-augmented e.p.p.s and m.e.p.p.s but slightly reduced their decay time. The incidence of regenerative depolarization of endplates induced by repetitive stimulation in the presence of neostigmine, was decreased from 92% to 35% junctions and the duration shortened from 650 ms to 230 ms. The amplitude of train e.p.p.s was increased. It is suggested that diazepam reverses the muscle paralysis induced by anticholinesterase agents by inhibiting the regenerative release of acetylcholine.", 
    "24": "Oxazepam is one of a number of benzodiazepines used therapeutically as a sedative-hypnotic and antianxiety agent. Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were performed by administering oxazepam (greater than 99% pure) in feed to male and female Swiss-Webster and B6C3F1 mice for 14 weeks, 57 weeks (Swiss-Webster), or 2 years (B6C3F1). Neurobehavioral assessments were performed during the studies. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and peripheral blood samples were analyzed for frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes. Supplemental studies were performed to compare the metabolism and toxicokinetics of oxazepam in the two mouse strains, to evaluate the effect on liver cell replication rates, to perform clinical pathology assessments, and to examine the mutation spectrum and frequency of activated H-ras oncogenes in liver neoplasms from the 2-year study with B6C3F1 mice. 14-WEEK STUDY IN SWISS-WEBSTER MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female Swiss-Webster mice received oxazepam in feed at concentrations of 0, 625, 1,250, 5,000, 10,000 ppm for 14 weeks. One 625 ppm male and one 10,000 female were killed moribund before the end of the study, and the condition of the female mouse was attributed to oxazepam exposure. Mean body weight gains of exposed groups were similar to those of the controls. Exposed mice displayed chemical-related sedation and lethargy during the first study week, but appeared normal thereafter. In the neurobehavioral studies, reductions in grip strength were evident in both male and female mice at week 2 and persisted in males through week 11. An antianxiety effect was detected in exposed mice in measures of motor activity, startle response, and reactions to thermal stimulus. At necropsy, absolute and relative liver weights were increased in an exposure-related manner and were approximately two-fold greater in 10,000 ppm mice than in controls. Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was present only in exposed mice, and the severity increased with dose. 14-WEEK STUDY IN B6C3F1 MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice received oxazepam in feed at concentrations of 0, Groups of 10 male and 10 female Swiss-Webster mice 625, 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm for 14 weeks. received oxazepam in feed at concentrations of 0, There were no deaths that were clearly related to 625,1,250, 2,500, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm for 14 weeks. oxazepam exposure. Mean body weight gains of One 625 ppm male and one 10,000 ppm female were exposed groups were similar to those of the controls. Exposed mice displayed chemical-related sedation and lethargy during only the first study week. In neurobehavioral studies, reductions in grip strength were evident in males at week 2 but were no longer observed at week 12. An antianxiety effect was noted in exposed mice in measures of motor activity, startle response, and reactions to a thermal stimulus (females). At necropsy, absolute and relative liver weights were increased in an exposure-related manner and were approximately two-fold greater in 10,000 ppm mice than in controls. Centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy was present only in exposed mice, and the severity increased with dose. CHRONIC STUDIES: Groups of 60 male and 60 female Swiss-Webster and B6C3F1 mice received oxazepam in feed at concentrations of 0, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm. Additional groups of 60 male and 60 female B6C3F1 mice received 125 ppm in feed to allow for study of a group with projected serum concentrations of oxazepam similar to those achieved in humans taking a therapeutic dose. Ten male and 10 female B6C3F1 mice per group were evaluated at 15 months. Average daily oxazepam consumption varied throughout the studies, and the overall daily average ranged from 10 to 29 mg/kg body weight for the 125 ppm groups, 234 to 512 mg/kg for the 2,500 ppm groups, and 444 to 1,085 mg/kg for the 5,000 ppm groups. Serum oxazepam concentrations determined at 57 weeks in Swiss-Webster mice and at the 15-month interim evaluation of B6C3F1 mice 1 mice were approximately 1 ug/mL in the 125 ppm groups, 4 to 7 &mu;g/mL in the 2,500 ppm groups, and 7 to 10 &mu;g/mL in the 5,000 ppm groups. Neurobehavioral assessments during the chronic studies of each strain of mice were confounded by the poor survival and deteriorating condition of mice with hepatic neoplasia. However, within the limitations of the studies, there were no notable changes in the types of behaviors observed compared to those observed in the 14-week studies, nor was there an enhancement in the degree to which they were exhibited. 57-Week Study in Swiss-Webster Mice: Survival, Body Weights, Feed and Compound Consumption, and Clinical Findings: At 57 weeks, survival of exposed mice was significantly lower than that of controls (males: O ppm, 45/60; 2,500 ppm, 19/60; 5,000 ppm, 10/60; females: 47/60, 28/59, 17/59), causing the study to be terminated. Mean body weights of exposed males were similar to controls until week 17; afterwards, mean body weights of exposed male groups were lower than those of controls. Final mean body weights of exposed males were 9% lower than that of the controls. The mean body weight of 2,500 ppm females was greater than that of the controls throughout the study. Females receiving 5,000 ppm had a mean body weight greater than that of the controls early in the study; after week 29, the mean body weight of this group was similar to that of the controls. Feed consumption by exposed males and females was slightly lower than that by the controls, and females in all groups, including controls, consumed slightly more feed than males throughout the study. Dietary levels of 2,500 and 5,000 ppm oxazepam resulted in average daily compound consumption levels of 270 and 570 mg/kg for males and 320 and 670 mg/kg for females. Hypoactivity and sedation were observed in exposed mice during the first week of the study. There were no other clinical findings associated with oxazepam exposure. Pathology Findings: Systemic amyloidosis was the principal cause of death in mice dying before the study was terminated. The lower survival of mice receiving oxazepam was attributed to an increase in the extent and severity of amyloid deposits in many organs, including the heart and kidney. Atrial thrombosis and pulmonary lesions consistent with chronic heart failure occurred at higher incidences and with greater severity in exposed mice. The incidence of hepatocellular adenomas (males: 1/60, 35/60, 50/60; females: 0/60, 22/59, 47/59) and carcinomas (males: 0/60, 5/60,19/60; females: 1/60, 1/59, 11/59) were increased in exposed mice. The incidences of eosinophilic foci were also increased in exposed mice (males: 0/60, 22/60, 22/60; females: 0/60, 20/59, 14/59), and there was evidence of increased centrilobular hepatocyte hypertrophy (males: 12/60, 46/60, 47/60; females: 3/60, 51/59, 53/59). 2-Year Study in B6C3F1 Mice: Survival, Body Weights, Feed and Compound Consumption, and Clinical Findings: Survival of mice receiving 2,500 and 5,000 ppm was significantly lower than that of controls (males: O ppm, 45/50; 125 ppm, 44/50; 2,500 ppm, 15/50; 5,000 ppm, 0/50; females: 39/50, 41/50, 2/50, 0/50). Mean body weight gains of exposed male and female mice were similar to controls until about week 15 when weight gains for mice exposed to 2,500 or 5,000 ppm slowed in relation to controls, resulting in weight gains approximately 30&percnt; to 40&percnt; lower than those of the controls throughout the remainder of the study. Mean body weight gain of male mice exposed to 125 ppm was similar to that of the controls, while that of female mice receiving 125 ppm was 10&percnt; to 15&percnt; lower than that of the controls after about week 45. Feed consumption by exposed males and females was similar to that by controls. Dietary levels of 125, 2,500, and 5,000 ppm resulted in average daily oxazepam consumption levels of 12, 310, and 690 mg/kg body weight for males and 15, 350, and 780 mg/kg for females. In the 5,000 ppm groups, lethargy and sedation were observed in a few mice during the first week of study. Pathology Findings: The early deaths of many of the B6C3F1 mice exposed to oxazepam were attributed to a marked increase in the incidences of hepatoblastoma (males: 0/49, 2/50, 21/50, 13/50; females: 0/50, 1/50, 8/50, 8/50), hepatocellular adenoma (males: 17/49,18/50, 34/50, 32/50; females: 25/50, 35/50, 35/50, 36/50), and hepatocellular carcinoma (males: 9/49, 5/50, 45/50, 50/50; females: 9/50, 5/50, 49/50, 44/50). Moderate hypertrophy of centrilobular hepatocytes occurred in mice receiving 2,500 and 5,000 ppm (males: 0/49, 2/50, 26/50, 43/50; females: 0/50, 2/50,11/50, 29/50). An increase in the incidence of follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland occurred in all exposed groups of mice (males: 4/49, 22/50, 49/50, 47/50; females: 16/50, 34/50, 49/50, 44/50), and thyroid gland follicular cell adenoma was increased in exposed females (0/50, 4/50, 5/50, 6/50). Testicular atrophy occurred in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups (1/50, 0/50, 25/50, 38/50), and the incidence of epididymal Iymphocyte infiltration was increased in all exposed groups (2/50,14/50, 33/50, 21/50). The frequency of hepatocellular neoplasms with an activated H-ras oncogene in the B6C3F1 mice and the mutation spectrum of the H-ras gene were determined. The mutation spectrum of the H-ras genes in the relatively few neoplasms from exposed mice that did have an activated H-ras did not differ from the spectrum of mutations observed in neoplasms from controls, but the proportion of neoplasms with an activated H-ras gene decreased with increasing oxazepam dose. While 11 of 19 (58&percnt;) neoplasms from control mice had an activated H-ras gene, only 1 of 40 neoplasms from mice receiving 2,500 or 5,000 ppm oxazepam exhibited a similar molecular lesion. Thirteen of 37 (35&percnt;) neoplasms from mice in the 125 ppm group had an activated H-ras oncogene, suggesting that, although the incidence of all liver neoplasms was not statistically increased compared to controls, there was an increase in a similar subset of neoplasms (lacking an activated H-ras) that occurred with increased incidence at higher doses. SUPPLEMENTAL STUDIES: Because exposure to oxazepam caused increased incidences of liver neoplasms, supplemental short-term studies were performed. Oxazepam given in feed to male B6C3F1 mice at 25, 125, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm for up to 13 weeks was found to cause a dose-related increase in nuclear labeling index in studies measuring the incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into replicating liver cells. This increase was statistically significant at all but the 25 ppm exposure level and was limited to mice evaluated at 15 days. Cell replication rates in most groups evaluated at 30 days and after were similar to control rates. There was minimal evidence suggestive of hepatocyte necrosis either by light microscopy or in clinical chemistry measures. There was, however, evidence of cholestasis, likely due to physical obstruction of bile canaliculi by swollen hepatocytes. The metabolic fate and toxicokinetics of oxazepam were evaluated in each strain of mice and were compared to published data from human studies. Both mice and humans form glucuronides of oxazepam and form 3- and 4-hydroxy and methoxy derivatives of the phenyl group. Oxidative metabolism of the phenyl group appears to be more prevalent in mice than is reported for humans. Elimination half-lives of parent compound do not differ between Swiss-Webster and B6C3F1 mice and are similar to values reported for humans. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Oxazepam was not mutagenic in any of several strains of Salmonella typhimurium, nor did it induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. These in vitro tests were performed with and without S9 metabolic activation. Results from an in vivo mouse peripheral blood micronucleus test performed on the B6C3F1 mice used in the 14-week study were also negative. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of oxazepam in male and female Swiss-Webster mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of oxazepam in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma. Increased incidences of hyperplasia of thyroid gland follicular cells in male and female B6C3F1 mice and of follicular cell adenomas in female B6C3F1 mice were also related to oxazepam exposure. Administration of oxazepam to Swiss-Webster mice resulted in centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy and increased incidences and severity of systemic amyloidosis. Administration of oxazepam to B6C3F1 mice also resulted in centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy.

    "25": "Changes in the GABAergic system after chronic treatment with bicuculline were examined in two strains of inbred rats, Fischer 344 (F344) and Lewis (LEW). Rats received an IP injection of either bicuculline (2 mg/kg) or vehicle once a day for 12 days. After this chronic treatment, the effects of diazepam (1 mg/kg, IP) and pentobarbital (20 mg/kg, IP) on bicuculline-induced convulsions were measured. Bicuculline was acutely infused into a tail vein at 0.0415 mg/min, and the infusion was terminated when rats showed seizure. Following the chronic bicuculline treatment, the anticonvulsant effect of diazepam, but not of pentobarbital, was significantly reduced as compared to its effect following chronic vehicle treatment in both strains. Both diazepam and pentobarbital showed a significant difference in anticonvulsant effects between strains (F344 > LEW). The hypnotic effects of muscimol, barbital, pentobarbital, and ethanol following chronic bicuculline treatment were examined. There was no significant difference in sleep time induced by these drugs between bicuculline- and vehicle-treated rats. These results suggest that the attenuation of diazepam's anticonvulsant effect after chronic bicuculline treatment may result from functional changes in benzodiazepine receptors and that the anticonvulsant effects of diazepam and pentobarbital may be influenced by genetic factors. Moreover, the hypnotic effects of several drugs tested are apparently not affected by chronic bicuculline treatment.", 
    "26": "Effects of benzodiazepine receptor-active compounds on inescapable shock-produced changes in social interaction were studied in the rat. Inescapably shocked animals exhibited less social interaction in a novel situation than did escapably shocked or unshocked rats 24 h after shock. Administration of the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil at the time of shock prevented the decrease in social interaction. Social interaction was unaffected by the same treatment at the time of measurement. Reduction in social interaction induced by inescapable stress endured for 48-72 h following stressor exposure but was absent 168 h after stress. It was subject to antagonist blockade at all measured time points. Stress-induced decreases in social interaction were also blocked by the benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide given at the time of shock treatment. The receptor antagonist did not reverse this blockade. An inverse agonist, the beta-carboline FG 7142, administered in place of inescapable shock, produced an identical pattern of social interaction in a dose-dependent manner. The inverse agonist effect was also reversed by the antagonist. The results from antagonist, agonist, and inverse agonist treatments all suggest that an endogenous benzodiazepine receptor inverse agonist is released at the time of inescapable shock and is involved in producing the changes in social interaction subsequently measured.", 
    "27": "Human alcoholics are almost invariably heavy users of tobacco, perhaps because both ethanol and nicotine may have anxiolytic activity. However, studies in humans have not uniformly detected anxiolytic effects because significant individual differences in anxiolytic actions of these agents seem to exist. One factor that seems to contribute to these individual differences is tolerance to ethanol. Individuals who are more sensitive to depressant actions of alcohol seem to show anxiolytic actions more readily. Consequently, we examined the relative sensitivities of the ethanol-sensitive (to the anesthetic actions of ethanol) long-sleep (LS) and ethanol-resistant short-sleep (SS) mouse lines to diazepam, ethanol, nicotine, and ethanol-nicotine combinations in the mirrored chamber test. This test measures approach-conflict behavior. Ethanol and nicotine evoked changes in mirrored chamber activities that resembled those elicited by diazepam. These effects were seen at doses that did not markedly affect locomotor activity, thereby suggesting that these changes in behavior represent anxiolytic actions. The LS-SS mice did not differ in sensitivity to diazepam, but the SS were more uniformly responsive to the other drugs. Only the SS showed clear evidence for interactions between ethanol and nicotine. If the changes in mirrored chamber behavior elicited by ethanol, nicotine, and combinations of the two drugs occur because of anxiety reduction, it seems that the SS mouse line is more responsive to anxiolytic actions of these drugs.", 
    "28": "Carbachol produced an approximately 2-fold stimulation, with respect to basal, of [3H]inositol monophosphate ([3H]IP1) accumulation in microdissected slices of rat substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), measured as a percentage of [3H]inositol incorporation. The response to carbachol was inhibited by 75 +/- 7% by 1 microM pirenzepine, consistent with a muscarinic M1 receptor-mediated response. Carbachol-induced [3H]IP1 accumulation was not reduced by pretreatment of the SNr slices with NMDA, in contrast to the 85% inhibition observed in striatal slices. The results suggest that measurement of carbachol-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis may be a feasible approach for studying muscarinic M1 receptor function in slices of SNr.", 
    "29": "The treatment of Colles' fractures in the elderly comprises a heavy workload for both accident and orthopaedic departments. The initial management has important clinical and financial implications for patient and hospital. The demand is variable and the ability to respond must also be flexible. The choice of anaesthetic technique is therefore most important. In our experience, intravenous sedation with midazolam (a water soluble benzodiazepine) has proven to be safe and effective in providing good conditions for anatomical reduction of Colles' fractures on an outpatient basis.", 
    "30": "Midazolam, a water-soluble benzodiazepine, has recently been introduced and found to be beneficial for sedation in upper GI endoscopy. Whereas it has been proven that diazepam does not have any effect on sphincter of Oddi (SO) motility in humans, no respective data exist on midazolam. On evaluation of the possible effects of midazolam on SO motility recording by means of endoscopic manometry, we found that midazolam had no effect on basal pressure (24.2 +/- 12.59 mm Hg before and 23.85 +/- 12.63 mm Hg after midazolam, p = 0.55), amplitude (39.75 +/- 22.62 versus 44.55 +/- 27.15, p = 0.097), duration (4.9 +/- 1.8 sec versus 5.05 +/- 1.7 sec, p = 0.614), and frequency of SO contractions (7.75 +/- 1.68 waves/min versus 7.15 +/- 1.92 waves/min, p = 0.083). These results suggest that in patients with normal manometric findings midazolam does not interfere with SO recording.", 
    "31": "Midazolam is a more recent benzodiazepine used for sedation during endoscopic procedures, including sphincter of Oddi (SO) manometry. However, the effect of this drug on the human SO has so far not been studied. In this paper we explored the effect of midazolam on human SO motility by means of endoscopic manometry. Twelve patients with suspected SO dysfunction were investigated. We found that in patients with normal manometry findings, midazolam had no effect on the sphincter motility. In contrast, in all patients with elevated SO pressure (SOP), as well as in one of the three patients with borderline SO tone, midazolam (2.5 mg i.v.) produced a relaxatory effect. Due to this effect the final readings were affected in three out of five patients, i.e. the abnormally elevated SOP decreased to a borderline level in two and in the remaining patient the borderline level in two and in the remaining patient the borderline SOP decreased to normal. In one other patient with a markedly elevated SOP the additional injection of 2.5 mg of midazolam caused a further decrease in SOP to a borderline level. We conclude that midazolam, due to its relaxatory effect on SO, appears to be a less suitable sedative for SO manometry.", 
    "32": "Obesity is common enough to constitute a serious medical and public health problem. Drug prescription for obese patients is difficult since dosages based on pharmacokinetic data obtained in normal-weight individuals could induce errors. In obese patients, physiopathological modifications are likely to affect drug tissue distribution and elimination. Body constitution is characterised by a higher percentage of fat and a lower percentage of lean tissue and water. Although the cardiac output and total blood volume are increased, the blood flow per gram of fat is less than in nonobese individuals. Histological hepatic alterations are commonly reported in morbidly obese individuals. A higher glomerular filtration rate is also observed. Most of the pharmacokinetic information concerning obesity deals with distribution. Published data concerning molecules with moderate and weak lipophilicity are homogeneous. In obese compared with normal weight individuals, the total volume of distribution (Vd) is moderately increased (aminoglycosides, caffeine) or similar (H2-blockers, neuromuscular blockers), but the Vd corrected by kilogram of actual bodyweight is significantly smaller. These drugs distribute to a limited extent in excess bodyweight. For highly lipophilic drugs, despite this common characteristic, discrepancies in distribution in obesity exist between drugs belonging to different pharmacological classes. Some drugs show a clear augmentation of Vd and elimination half-life (benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, trazodone, verapamil, sufentanil), indicating a marked distribution into adipose tissue. For others, Vd and Vd/kg are decreased (cyclosporin, propranolol), suggesting that factors other than lipid solubility intervene in tissue distribution. As a general trend, the total clearance (CL) of drugs metabolised by oxidation, conjugation or reduction, and also of drugs with flow-dependent hepatic clearance, is not diminished in obesity. Usually CL is identical in obese and nonobese individuals, sometimes it is increased in obesity (enflurane, halothane, prednisolone, some benzodiazepines). With some drugs a significant reduction in CL is observed in obese individuals (methylprednisolone, propranolol). Renal clearance of aminoglycosides and cimetidine increases in obese individuals. Practical guidelines for dosage adjustment are proposed. For drugs with distribution restricted to lean tissues, the loading dose should be based on the ideal bodyweight of patients. For drugs markedly distributed into fat tissue the loading dose is based on total bodyweight. Adjustment of the maintenance dose depends on possible changes in CL. In some cases (atracurium, prednisolone) dosage adjustment does not follow these recommendations, owing to pharmacodynamic data.", 
    "33": "Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) play a vital role in the defence against invading bacteria. It is known that some anaesthetics inhibit PMNL function and, thus, possibly enhance perioperative infection. We investigated the effect of methohexitone, flunitrazepam, and droperidol on three bactericidal PMNL functions, i.e., superoxide anion production, hydrogen peroxide generation, and activity of released myeloperoxidase, in vitro. Approved photometrical assays were used. Superoxide anion was measured by the reduction of cytochrome C, hydrogen peroxide by the horse radish peroxidase catalysed oxidation of phenol red, and myeloperoxidase by the turnover of 2,2'-azino-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline) sulfonic acid. Methohexitone (P < or = 0.001) and flunitrazepam (P < or = 0.01) inhibited superoxide anion production, and methohexitone (P < or = 0.01) reduced hydrogen peroxide generation but only at concentrations beyond clinical relevance. Droperidol did not cause any alteration of the PMNL functions tested. Consequently, it seems unlikely that the usual doses of methohexitone, flunitrazepam, or droperidol promote bacterial infections in vivo by impairing the activity of myeloperoxidase or by inhibiting the generation of superoxide anion or hydrogen peroxide.", 
    "34": "To determine the minimum time interval between oral midazolam (0.5 mg.kg-1) premedication and separation from parents that ensures a smooth separation, 30 children were assigned randomly to one of three groups (ten children per group). The groups differed only in the time interval between administration of midazolam and separation from their parents: 10, 20 or 30 min. Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and sedation and anxiolysis scores were assessed before midazolam premedication (baseline), at the time of separation from parents, and during the application of a face mask at the induction of anaesthesia. We found that heart rate and systolic blood pressure changes were similar for all three groups throughout the study period. Sedation scores at the time of separation from parents and on application of the mask for all three groups were greater than baseline values. Sedation scores at separation did not differ among the three groups. Anxiolysis values did not differ from baseline values at any time for all three groups. We conclude that children may be separated from their parents as early as ten minutes after receiving oral midazolam, 0.5 mg.kg-1.", 
    "35": "1. The cholecystokinin receptors mediating motor responses in a novel smooth muscle preparation from the corpus region of the guinea-pig stomach have been characterized by use of five agonist peptides and the antagonists CI-988, L-365,260 and devazepide. 2. Mucosa-denuded strips of circular muscle were contracted in a concentration-dependent manner by the five cholecystokinin (CCK)-related peptides CCK-8S, pentagastrin, gastrin-I, CCK-8US and CCK-4. 3. CI-988 was a powerful antagonist of the response to pentagastrin with an affinity (pKB = 9.49) similar to that obtained in CCKB receptor binding assays. With CCK-8S as the agonist, CI-988 was approximately 1000 fold less powerful as an antagonist. 4. Devazepide powerfully blocked responses to CCK-8S with an affinity (pKB = 9.54) that was in agreement with reported functional data obtained in pancreatic amylase secretion studies, a system exhibiting CCKA receptor activity. Devazepide displayed lower affinity against pentagastrin than against CCK-8S. 5. CI-988 blocked responses to pentagastrin in an insurmountable manner in the presence of 3 nM devazepide; a concentration previously shown to block the CCKA receptor. The nature of the antagonism observed with L-365,260 was unaltered by the presence of devazepide. 6. The guinea-pig stomach corpus smooth muscle preparation contains both subtypes of CCK receptor and will be useful as a pharmacological tool for investigating the functional effects of novel CCK ligands.", 
    "36": "1. The estimation of antagonist affinity from functional experiments in which the effect of a fixed agonist concentration is reduced by a range of antagonist concentrations ('functional inhibition curves') has been considered from both a theoretical and experimental viewpoint. 2. Theoretical predictions are compared with results obtained from the stimulation of [35S]-GTP gamma S binding by acetylcholine to membranes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with human m1-m4 muscarinic receptors, and inhibition of the stimulated binding by pirenzepine and AQ-RA 741. 3. The usual procedure of applying the Cheng-Prusoff correction is shown to be theoretically invalid, and predictions are made of the size and distribution of errors associated with this procedure. 4. A different procedure for estimating antagonist affinity, using the principles of dose-ratio analysis and analogous to use of the Gaddum equation, is found to be accurate and theoretically valid. 5. A novel method of analysis allows accurate estimation of both antagonist affinity and Schild slope, by fitting the combined data from an antagonist inhibition curve and an agonist activation curve directly to a form of the Schild equation (derived by Waud) using non-linear regression analysis. 6. It is shown that the conventional Schild analysis can be enhanced by treating part of the data as a family of inhibition curves and including in the Schild plot dose-ratios estimated from the inhibition curves.", 
    "37": "Transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography was used to measure left ventricular diameter in end-systole and end-diastole during anesthetic induction in 11 patients before coronary artery bypass grafting. Midazolam, 0.1 mg/kg, and fentanyl, 6 to 10 micrograms/kg, were used followed by pancuronium, 0.1 mg/kg. Lidocaine, 1.5 mg/kg, was given topically in the airways before intubation. During induction of anesthesia there was a gradual decrease in diastolic diameter (preload) and in systolic diameter and pressure (afterload). The decrease in end-diastolic diameter from 4.6 cm to 3.9 cm indicated a decrease in preload, defined as end-diastolic volume, by approximately 34%. These results are in agreement with earlier findings using calculated ventricular volumes, based on the determination of either ejection fraction with radionuclide cardiography or stroke volume with thermodilution, during induction of anesthesia with thiopental, diazepam, fentanyl, and pancuronium.", 
    "38": "The sedative and analgesic/anesthetic effects of medetomidine, acepromazine, azaperone, droperidol and midazolam were compared in laboratory pigs. In these sedatives, medetomidine produced the most profound degree of sedation with greater drowsiness than was achieved by other sedatives tested. Medetomidine induced sedation accompanied with weak analgesia and muscle relaxation smoothly and quickly and depressed arousal reaction deeply as compared with other sedatives. Pigs given medetomidine were not aroused easily even by moderately rough stimulation for approximately 60 min after injection.", 
    "39": "1. We studied the effects of midazolam (MDZ), a benzodiazepine, on spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity, choice reaction time, and mood visual analogue scales in healthy volunteers. 2. Eight extensively trained, healthy volunteers were included in a placebo-controlled cross-over double-blind trial of MDZ (0.15 mg kg-1). Treatments were injected intramuscularly and evaluations were performed before and 0.5, 1, 2, 3 and 4 h after drug administration. Spatio-temporal contrast sensitivity was measured using a micro-computer with appropriate software. Stimuli were vertical gratings with adjustable contrast, with spatial frequencies of 0.25, 1 and 4 cpd. Four conditions of temporal modulation were used: the grating was either static or drifting laterally with temporal frequencies of 1, 3 and 9 Hz. 3. An analysis of variance was performed on the data. As compared with placebo, MDZ induced an increase in choice reaction time and sedation (as assessed on visual analogue scales). From 0.5-4 h after the injection, MDZ produced an overall decrease in visual sensitivity, as compared with placebo. More specifically, MDZ preferentially affected medium to high spatial frequencies and low temporal frequencies. Several non-exclusive hypotheses may account for the results: 1) an increase in the size of the receptive fields, 2) a preferential effect on the visual parvocellular pathways which mediate the sensitivity to high spatial and low temporal frequencies.", 
    "40": "1. Concentration-effect relationships of midazolam were assessed in an open study in six healthy volunteers. Saccadic eye movements and EEG parameters derived by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and aperiodic analysis (AP) were used to quantify drug effects. 2. Midazolam was infused at a rate of 0.6 mg kg-1 h-1 for a maximum of 15 min. Hypnotic effects were avoided by terminating infusions when subjects could no longer perform the eye movement test properly. 3. Wake-sleep transitions could be recognized through frequent observation of eye movements. The dose needed to reach maximum conscious sedation averaged 0.10 mg kg-1, ranging from 0.06 to 0.13 mg kg-1. 4. Sigmoidal concentration-effect relationships were found for EEG beta-amplitudes in five of six subjects, with average EC50 values (+/- s.d.) of 120 +/- 54 ng ml-1 for FFT and 104 +/- 40 ng ml-1 for AP. For the 'total number of waves' in the beta frequency range (AP) an average (n = 6) EC50 of 63 +/- 37 ng ml-1 was found. Changes in EEG alpha-amplitudes were found in three subjects, resulting in an average EC50 value of 55 +/- 32 ng ml-1. 5. For saccadic peak velocity (PV) concentration-effect relationships were linear in five subjects and sigmoidal in one. The maximal measured decrease in PV averaged -44 +/- 9%. 6. The differences in concentration-effect relationships for various effect parameters call for further studies with emphasis on the external validity and reproducibility of data. In such studies the dose needed to reach wake-sleep transition may be used as a relevant clinical end-point.", 
    "41": "Factors contributing to the quantification of the central benzodiazepine receptor binding potential in vivo using 123I-iomazenil and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) were analysed in phantom studies and in volunteers. SPECT was performed with the SME810 multidetector system. The Hoffman three-dimensional brain phantom was used to investigate linearity and reproducibility of SPECT results using different 123I activity concentrations. Dynamic and multislice SPECT scans were performed in nine healthy volunteers between 0 and 270 min after injection of 110 MBq 123I-iomazenil. Displacement studies were performed in three volunteers using 1 mg flumazenil administered intravenously (i.v.) at 250 min postinjection (p.i.). Regions of interest (ROIs) over the cerebral cortex and various subcortical nuclei were either fixed areas based on a stereotaxic brain atlas, or manually drawn, based on 60% isocontour lines. Interobserver variability of the ROI data and ratios derived from those data were estimated for two independent observers. The brain phantom measurements showed linearity with respect to 123I concentration and good reproducibility. The interobserver study showed a reasonable interobserver reliability for the large fixed ROIs. The displacement study showed about 50% displacement in all ROIs. Concentrations of 123I-iomazenil in the brain can be measured reliably with the SME810. Large fixed ROIs based on a stereotaxic atlas may be used reliably for quantification. The level of 4 cm above the cantomeatal line does not provide a useful reference region with a very low central benzodiazepine receptor binding potential.", 
    "42": "The postnatal development of GABAA and benzodiazepine receptors was studied in the rat visual cortex with [3H]muscimol and [3H]flunitrazepam, respectively. The studies were performed by quantitative receptor autoradiography in the different cortical layers from normally raised rats and from monocularly deprived animals. In all cortical layers of normal rats there was a sharp (approx 3-fold) increase in [3H]muscimol binding from days 1 to 10. Between postnatal days 10 and 20 there was a considerable decrease in GABAA receptors; thereafter this decline continued until adulthood but at a more moderate rate. In all cortical layers, [3H]flunitrazepam binding increased sharply, also from day 1 to 10; at this age the adult values were practically attained. Monocular deprivation, by unilateral eyelid suture at the age of 11 days onwards lead to an increase in [3H]muscimol binding in cortical layers IV-VI. This increase in GABAA receptors was detectable at the age of 25 days onwards. In contrast, monocular deprivation did not alter the density of benzodiazepine receptors in any of the cortical layers, and this lack of effects was regardless of the duration of visual deprivation. The present results suggest that the development of GABAA receptors in the deeper cortical layers, but not that of benzodiazepine receptors, is seemingly regulated by the visual experience at a critical period of brain maturation.", 
    "43": "In these studies, the antagonistic actions of (-)-1-Cyclopentyl-5-(1,2,3,4,5,-hexahydro-8-hydroxy-3,6,11-trimethyl-2,6 -methano-3-benzazocin-11-yl)-3-pentanone methanesulfonate (quadazocine) were evaluated against the kappa-receptor-mediated antinociceptive effects of i.c.v. (5 alpha, 7 alpha, 8 beta)-(+)-N-methyl-N-(7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)- 1-oxaspiro(4,5)dec-8-yl)benzeneacetamide (U69,593) or bremazocine in the mouse warm water tail-flick test. Quadazocine produced no antinociceptive effects alone, and it selectively antagonized the actions of bremazocine, but not U69,593, in a dose- and time-related fashion, supporting previous suggestions of differences in kappa receptors mediating the antinociceptive effects of these agonists. Quadazocine, however, also antagonized the antinociceptive effects of both DAMGO (opioid mu agonist) and DPDPE (opioid delta agonist) at doses approximately 3-fold less than those needed to attenuate significantly the effects of bremazocine. The structurally diverse kappa opioids (+-)-trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]benzo[b]- thiophene-4-acetamide (PD 117,302), ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) and tifluadom were studied under kappa-selective conditions, and the sensitivity of their effects to 1S,2S-trans-2-isothiocyanato-4,5-dichloro-N-[2(1- pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide [(-)-UPHIT] (kappa 1 antagonist) or quadazocine (kappa 2 antagonist) was determined. On this basis PD 117,302, EKC and tifluadom were classified as acting at opioid kappa 1, kappa 1, and kappa 2 receptors, respectively; EKC and tifluadom were also shown to have significant activity at opioid mu, but not delta, receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "44": "Gonadal status in rats modulates both the apparent development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of the benzodiazepines and the concomitant changes in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors and GABA-activated 36chloride flux after chronic exposure to a benzodiazepine agonist. By using single-unit electrophysiological techniques, the present study demonstrates disparate neural adaptations in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) of anesthetized male and ovariectomized (OVX) rats after chronic (3 week) exposure to a benzodiazepine agonist. Unlike males, no reduction in SNr responsiveness to systemically administered diazepam was seen in OVX females after chronic treatment with diazepam-filled implants. In addition, OVX females did not show the compensatory increase in spontaneous firing rate observed in males upon administration of the specific benzodiazepine antagonist, RO15-1788. Sensitivities to locally (microiontophoretically) applied GABA, benzodiazepine agonist (midazolam) and GABA antagonist (SR95531) were not affected by hormone-related factors or chronic exposure to diazepam-filled implants. These results indicate that male and OVX rats show divergent alterations in SNr responses to systemic administration of benzodiazepines after chronic benzodiazepine treatment which appear unrelated to intrinsic changes in responsiveness of the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "45": "Gonadal status in rats modulates the development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of the benzodiazepines and the concomitant changes in cortical gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors after chronic benzodiazepine agonist exposure. The present study analyzed physiological GABA responsiveness after chronic benzodiazepine exposure by measuring GABA-activation of 36chloride influx into cortical and cerebellar microsacs. GABA-stimulated 36chloride influx was compared in groups of male and ovariectomized female rats after acute (2-3 day) or chronic (3 week) exposure to diazepam-filled or empty silastic implants. Chronic diazepam exposure increased cortical GABA-activated 36chloride influx in ovariectomized rats, but did not influence GABA responses in males. Acute exposure to diazepam did not alter cortical 36chloride influx in either hormone group. Vehicle-treated ovariectomized rats also had lower levels of cortical GABA-activated 36chloride influx than vehicle-treated males. In cerebellar microsacs, diazepam exposure enhanced GABA-induced 36chloride influx. This effect was observed after both acute and chronic treatments and hormone groups did not differ in their response to chronic benzodiazepine exposure. Enhancement of GABA-stimulated 36chloride influx by the benzodiazepine agonist midazolam was not altered in male or ovariectomized rats after chronic diazepam treatment. Thus, gonad-related factors influence the changes in GABAA receptors and the resulting GABA responses in the cortex, but not the cerebellum, observed after chronic benzodiazepine agonist exposure in rats. These regionally specific divergent alterations in GABAergic systems may be related to the differential development of tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects of the benzodiazepines observed in these hormone groups.", 
    "46": "Although there appear to be a large number of possible isoforms of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor, the relationship of a particular isoform to a specific behavior or behavioral process has not been identified. In the present study we describe a functional role for a diazepam-insensitive (DI) isoform of the GABAA receptor in the control of a complex discrimination. Pigeons were trained to discriminate the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (100 micrograms/kg) from vehicle by requiring 30 keypeck responses on one key when flumazenil was given and on a different key when vehicle was given. Only ligands with high affinities for DI sites fully substituted for the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil. A significant positive correlation was observed between ligand affinities for DI sites and ED50 values for discriminative stimulus effects. These compounds mimicked the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil despite partial agonist, inverse agonist or antagonist actions at other diazepam-sensitive GABAA receptors. A specific role of DI GABAA receptors in the control of this behavior was confirmed further by the inability of either a high-affinity agonist (midazolam) or antagonist (ZK 93,426) at diazepam-sensitive receptors (that possess low affinities for DI sites) to block the discriminative stimulus effects of flumazenil. These findings establish a link between a GABAA receptor isoform and a specific behavior.", 
    "47": "Positive allosteric modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors, including benzodiazepines and congeners, can be classified into three categories: 1) full allosteric modulators (i.e., triazolam and alprazolam) that act with high potency and efficacy at many GABAA receptors; 2) selective allosteric modulators (i.e., diazepam) that act with high potency and high efficacy at selected GABAA receptors; and 3) partial allosteric modulators (i.e., bretazenil) that act with high potency but low efficacy at many GABAA receptors. Imidazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine carboxamide, has been characterized as a novel representative of the partial allosteric modulator class. When tested on a broad spectrum (native and recombinant) of GABAA receptors, imidazenil positively modulates the GABA-elicited Cl- currents with a 4- to 5-fold higher potency but an efficacy (30-50%) lower than that of diazepam, and it antagonizes the effects of the latter drug. Imidazenil in vitro (Ki = 5 x 10(-10) M) and in vivo (ID50 = 0.2 mumol/kg i.v.) displaces [3H]flumazenil from its brain binding sites and in vivo it possesses a marked anticonflict profile in the rat Vogel conflict-punishment test and is 10 times more potent than bretazenil and 100 times more potent than diazepam or alprazolam in antagonizing bicuculline- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures. Unlike diazepam and alprazolam, which induce sedation and ataxia and potentiate the effects of ethanol and thiopental at doses similar to those that produce anticonflict effects and occupy 50% of brain flumazenil binding sites, imidazenil does not produce ataxia or sedation in rats nor does it potentiate the effects of ethanol or thiopental in doses 30- to 50-fold higher than those required for the anticonflict effect and for 100% occupancy of brain flumazenil binding sites. Furthermore, when administered with diazepam, imidazenil blocks in a dose-related fashion the sedative, ataxic effects of this drug and thus acts on these unwanted responses as an antagonist (i.e., like flumazenil). In all tests, imidazenil has the pharmacological profile of a partial allosteric modulator, but is more potent than bretazenil, has a longer biological half-life and, in rodents, is virtually unable to cause sedation, ataxia or to potentiate ethanol toxicity.",

Arrays of compounds were synthesized over two to three steps incorporating chemically diverse building blocks on a polystyrene-based solid support in a multiple, simultaneous manner.

    "50": "Lymphocyte beta adrenoreceptor density and affinity, basal lymphocyte cAMP level, and isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP generation were measured in 27 untreated outpatients with panic disorder with agoraphobia and 24 healthy comparison subjects. Lymphocyte beta receptor attributes were again assessed in patients after 4 weeks of double-blind treatment with adinazolam (slow-release form) or placebo. Panic frequency, agoraphobic symptoms, overall anxiety, and improvement with treatment were assessed with standard rating instruments.", 
    "51": "Multivariate statistics revealed significantly lower beta receptor density and isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP generation in patients than in comparison subjects. beta receptor density tended to normalize after adinazolam but not after placebo. Pretreatment beta receptor density was lower in treatment responders than nonresponders. Patients with mild agoraphobia had lower cAMP responsivity than patients with moderate or severe agoraphobia.", 
    "52": "Decreased function of lymphocyte beta receptors in panic disorder with agoraphobia is expressed as both decreased density and decreased cAMP responsivity. This pattern of changes, and the tendency for receptor density to normalize with treatment, is consistent with an active, regulatory process rather than a structural deficit in the beta receptor system. Preliminary clinical findings suggest that these changes may reflect adaptive processes associated with a favorable clinical course in panic disorder with agoraphobia.", 
    "53": "The usefulness of alprazolam (minor tranquilizer) used in combination with metoclopramide plus methylprednisolone for the prevention and control of emesis induced by chemotherapies, including 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of cisplatin (25 mg/m2/day) for advanced lung cancer, was evaluated using a double-blind randomized crossover design. In our study, 34 cases could be evaluated. No nausea was observed in 14 patients given alprazolam and 4 placebo (p < .01). The mean number of vomiting episodes was significantly smaller in the alprazolam group (1.31 +/- 2.61 vs 2.89 +/- 4.59 times) (p < .01). The mean duration of nausea and vomiting was significantly shorter in the alprazolam group (p < .001 and p < .01). From these findings, it can be concluded that the coadministration of alprazolam is effective in preventing and controlling chemotherapy-induced emesis due to 5-day continuous intravenous infusion of cisplatin in which mental and psychological factors are involved.", 
    "54": "The relative effectiveness of the available treatments for panic disorder may best be understood in the context of the longitudinal course of the disorder. This study examines a number of clinically relevant issues, including long-term outcome after acute treatment, the proportion of patients remaining on single-agent treatment or requiring multiple medications or nonpharmacologic interventions over time, evidence for dose escalation during maintenance high-potency benzodiazepine therapy, and predictors of acute and long-term response to treatment. Fifty-nine panic disorder patients originally randomized to treatment in a controlled trial comparing alprazolam, clonazepam, and placebo were reevaluated in a follow-up study. At a mean follow-up of 1.5 years, 78% of patients remained on medication and the mean dosage of alprazolam and clonazepam did not increase. Our data suggest that most patients maintain benefit with long-term pharmacotherapy but that residual symptomatology may require more intensive or additional treatment strategies. Response at the endpoint of the acute trial was significantly associated with pretrial baseline Clinical Global Impression Scale score and the presence of dysthymia. Poor outcome at follow-up was associated with total duration of the disorder, agoraphobic subtype, and the presence of comorbid social phobia. We underscore the potential importance of comorbid affective and anxiety disorders as well as phobic patterns in determining long-term response to treatment.", 
    "55": "Anorexia is a common response to infection which is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by interleukin (IL-1), an immunoregulatory peptide secreted by activated monocytes. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a neuropeptide that suppresses food intake and gastric emptying when injected into healthy animals. There is increasing evidence of bidirectional interactions between neuropeptides, immune cell function, and secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to determine if administration of L364,718 (L364), a CCK receptor antagonist, might block the anorexigenic effects of recombinant human IL-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) in rats. We report that injection of IL-1 alpha significantly increased plasma CCK 1 h after injection, and decreased food intake and emptying of gastric contents. Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg L364 partially blocked the decrease in food intake and gastric stasis induced by IL-1 alpha. We conclude CCK may mediate, at least in part, IL-1 alpha-induced anorexia.", 
    "56": "In a prospective study 60 patients receiving morphine for treatment of mostly neuropathic and musculoskeletal pain of non-malignant origin were investigated. The aim of the study was to determine the characteristics of responders to morphine therapy and the frequency and severity of side effects. METHODS. Eligible patients suffered from chronic pain that had not been relieved despite all current therapy. All of them received controlled-release morphine tablets. Dose was increased in case of insufficient pain relief. Before morphine treatment and at the follow-ups pain intensity was rated on a numeric analogous scale, analgesia and side effects on a four-stage verbal rating scale. Intake of the prescribed and other drugs was randomly controlled by urine analysis. The patients were divided in three groups retrospectively: group I, non-responders who ceased the morphine therapy within 1 month due to weak analgesia or severe side effects; group II, patients in whom the therapy was stopped within the following months despite persisting pain; group III, patients who continued therapy. STATISTICS. ANOVA, chi-squared test, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon). Results were accepted as significant at p < 0.05. RESULTS. Twenty-three patients were non-responders. Fourteen other patients stopped the therapy after initial response because the side effects exceeded the benefit of analgesia (group II). Only 10 of the remaining 23 responders had good analgesia and minor side effects during the observation time. Constipation, despite prophylactic laxatives, and nausea were the most frequently reported events causing cessation of therapy. Analgesia and side effects in groups II and III were constant during the observation time of 241 (36-1486) days. In groups II and III, 43% of the patients needed an increase of the morphine dosage during therapy. The initially sufficient morphine dosage was significantly higher in group II than in group III; only one patient needed more than 90 mg/day in group III. Urine screening tests in 45 patients disclosed that 18 patients concealed the intake of other opioids or psychotropic drugs, mostly benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS. The study showed many problems with the patients' compliance and acceptance of oral morphine due to side effects and lack of analgesia. The discrepancy from other, positive reports might be explained by the extremely selected patients of this study and by the fact that not only responders were included for evaluation. Patients' compliance seems to have been overestimated in previous studies because no urinary controls were taken.", 
    "57": "A role for the brain/gut peptide cholecystokinin (CCK) in the control of gastric emptying has been proposed. In the present studies, we have used a potent type A CCK-receptor antagonist (devazepide) to examine the quantitative contribution of endogenously released CCK in the control of liquid gastric emptying of 100 ml lipid, protein, and carbohydrate test loads in rhesus monkeys. Emptying was studied in conscious monkeys equipped with chronic indwelling gastric cannulas. Prior intragastric administration of devazepide (1.0-320 micrograms/kg) differentially affected the 10-min emptying of glucose (0.125/ml), peptone (4.5%), and Intralipid (4.5%). Glucose emptying was not affected by any dose of the CCK antagonist. The emptying of peptone was accelerated by doses of 10 micrograms/kg or higher. This effect, however, was only partial and plateaued at a dose of 100 micrograms/kg. The gastric emptying of Intralipid was accelerated at a dose of 32 micrograms/kg, and the inhibitory effect of the Intralipid was completely eliminated at a dose of 320 micrograms/kg. At this dose of devazepide, the Intralipid test meal emptied from the stomach at the same rate as physiological saline. These data demonstrate that in rhesus monkeys endogenously released CCK 1) does not play a role in the control of glucose emptying, 2) is a partial mediator of the inhibitory action of peptone on gastric emptying, and 3) is the primary inhibitory mediator in the control of the gastric emptying of Intralipid.", 
    "58": "The goal of this study was to elucidate mechanisms responsible for age-related reductions in responsiveness to cholinergic muscarinic stimulation in guinea pigs, by examining the binding properties of muscarinic receptors and their coupling to guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins as a function of animal age. In addition, the binding constants of three selective muscarinic receptor antagonists pirenzepine, [11-((2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl)-acetyl)-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido(2,3)(1,4)benzodiazepine-6-on], and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methobromide were examined. We found that there were no changes in either the receptor density or the affinity of the muscarinic receptor with age. There was a significant reduction in the affinity constant for the high-affinity agonist binding site in the old tissues (7.63 +/- 0.08) compared with the young tissues (8.31 +/- 0.10). Guanine nucleotides lowered agonist affinity for the receptor in young lungs, however, they had no effect on agonist binding in old tissues. Antagonist competition binding curves in young tissues revealed that 73% of the receptors are of the M2 type, with 27% being of the M3 subtype. In contrast, antagonist competition binding curves in the old tissues revealed that 37% of the receptors were of the M2 subtype, 30% were M3, and 33% were of the M1 subtype. Our studies provide evidence that the loss of sensitivity to cholinergic muscarinic stimulation in the senescent lung may be due to changes in both muscarinic receptor subtypes and receptor coupling to G proteins.", 
    "59": "The role of cholecystokinin (CCK) as a central and peripheral satiety factor was studied using the CCK-B (L-365,260) and CCK-A (MK-329) receptor antagonists in esophageal-fistula dogs. Suppression of feeding was induced by either balloon gastric distension or small bowel nutrient infusion and was measured as the volume sham fed. Intracerebroventricular L-365,260 abolished satiety behavior from gastric distension (volume sham fed 2,667 +/- 211 ml vs. vehicle alone 1,217 +/- 446 ml, P < 0.05) but not small bowel infusion. Intravenous MK-329 abolished satiety behavior from small bowel infusion (volume sham fed 1,900 +/- 521 ml vs. vehicle alone 210 +/- 198 ml, P < 0.05) but not from gastric distension. The volume sham fed after intracerebroventricular MK-329 with balloon gastric distension or small bowel infusion did not differ from control. These results suggest that, in the brain, CCK is a physiological mediator of satiety behavior from gastric distension but not small bowel nutrients and, in the periphery, CCK is a physiological mediator of satiety behavior from small bowel nutrients but not gastric distension.", 
    "60": "Recent work has suggested that patients' coping could be improved in stressful dental situations if perceptions of self-efficacy and control could be enhanced. To test this hypothesis, 70 first-time third-molar extraction patients were randomly assigned to one of four surgery preparation conditions: standard preparation, oral premedication, relaxation, and a relaxation+efficacy-enhancing feed-back condition in which subjects were given false galvanic skin response (GSR) biofeedback leading them to believe that they were highly skilled at relaxing. Analyses indicated that: (1) all treatments were seen as equally credible (controlling for placebo effects); (2) a priori contrasts showed that both the relaxation-only treatment and the relaxation+efficacy-enhancement treatment were superior to the premedication and standard preparations in raising coping self-efficacy; (3) regardless of treatment condition, increase in reported coping self-efficacy was significantly correlated with pre-operative anxiety, with self-reported peri-operative distress, and with behavioral ratings of peri-operative distress; and (4) the relaxation treatments resulted in lower pre-operative anxiety than the other interventions, and linear contrasts showed significant trends in which the relaxation+efficacy-enhancing condition was superior to the relaxation-only condition, which was in turn superior to the medication condition and the standard preparation in reducing both pre-operative anxiety and behavioral ratings of peri-operative distress. It was concluded that thoughts related to self-confidence and control can be manipulated, and that these thoughts can in part determine how well a person copes in stressful dental situations.",

Brain computerized axial tomography showed normal, but electroencephalogram revealed spike and wave activity from temporal leads, especially on the left side. She was diagnosed as having verbal auditory agnosia. The treatment consisted of diazepam therapy. One year after the onset, her impaired auditory comprehension dramatically improved with the use of diazepam. The dichotic listening test revealed a left ear advantage for both environmental sounds and spoken words. The results seemed to suggest that in this patient the right hemisphere might be functioning as a speech center instead of the left one.", 
    "62": "Blood samples from 159 fatally injured drivers from 1989 and 1990, corresponding to 57% of all fatally injured drivers in Norway during this period, were analysed for alcohol and psychoactive drugs. Alcohol was found in 28.3% of the drivers, 27.0% above the legal limit of 0.05%. Drugs were found in 16.4% of the drivers; benzodiazepines and tetrahydrocannabinol were the drugs most frequently found. Among 79 drivers fatally injured in single-vehicle accidents, 41.8% were positive for alcohol and 21.5% were positive for drugs.", 
    "63": "This study examined the incidence of alcohol and drugs in a sample of seriously injured motor vehicle collision victims, and differences related to pre-crash use of alcohol and/or other drugs on demographic variables, injury severity measures, and crash variables. The sample selected were all motor vehicle collision admissions to the Regional Trauma Unit at the Sunnybrook Health Science Centre in Toronto, Ontario, over a 37-month period (N = 854). Prospective demographic and injury-related information were collected from hospital charts, and crash data were collected from motor vehicle collision police reports. Blood samples were routinely collected on admission and tested for blood alcohol concentration (BAC). We found 32.0% of the BAC-tested motor vehicle collision admissions and 35.5% of drivers tested positive for blood alcohol. The drivers' mean BAC on admission was found to be 145.2 mg/100 ml, and the mean estimated BAC at crash time was 181 mg/100 ml. Drug screens were performed on a two-year subsample (n = 474), of whom 339 were drivers. Drug screens revealed that 41.3% of drivers tested positive for other drugs in body fluids, and 16.5% were positive for alcohol in combination with other drugs. Other than alcohol, the drugs most frequently detected in the drivers were cannabinoids (13.9%), benzodiazepines (12.4%), and cocaine (5.3%). Investigation of differences on demographic, injury, and crash characteristics related to precrash use of alcohol and/or drugs yielded significant findings. In the drug screened sample we found sex, admission type, and occupant status were related to precrash alcohol use. Also, use of drugs was found to interact with admission type and mean BAC on admission. Elapsed time was found to be significantly different for BAC by other drug use, with a greater length of elapsed time found for the subjects testing other drug positive but BAC negative. We found that BAC-positive drug-screened drivers were significantly more likely to be male, involved in a single-vehicle collision, not wearing a seat belt, ejected from the vehicle, and travelling at higher speeds than BAC negative drivers. No significant differences were found between BAC and/or other drug use on injury severity measures.", 
    "64": "We compared the efficacy of four different classes of anesthetics to arrest the progression of brain damage after chemoconvulsant-induced seizures in rats. In two series of experiments, ventilated, paralyzed Long-Evans rats were subjected to 30 or 45 min of continuous seizures induced by intravenous (IV) mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or inhaled flurothyl, respectively. In the first series, seizures produced with MPA were treated with: 1) thiopental, 15 mg/kg IV bolus (controls); 2) thiopental, 27 mg/kg IV followed by 20.9 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 2 h; 3) isoflurane 4% inhaled concentration for 1 min followed by 1%-2% for 2 h; 4) ketamine 30 mg/kg IV followed by 9.12 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 2 h; 5) midazolam 25 mg/kg IV followed by 9.7 mg.kg-1.h-1 for 2 h. In a second series, seizures were produced by flurothyl and, based on suggestive results in the MPA series, control rats were compared with rats receiving midazolam 25 mg/kg IV followed by 9.7 mg.kg-1.h-1. In all instances, seizure activity, recorded by electroencephalograph, stopped with anesthetic treatment. In MPA-treated rats extranigral damage was mild, with no differences apparent between anesthetics. Control animals sustained severe lesions in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNPR). No statistically significant differences between anesthetic groups were present, although an effect was suggested for midazolam to decrease SNPR lesional area (P = 0.06). In flurothyl-treated rats, there were significant reductions in SNPR neuropathologic grade (P = 0.025) and lesional area (P = 0.025) with midazolam. We conclude that midazolam attenuates postseizure SNPR damage in rats.", 
    "65": "This study was designed to evaluate the developmental toxicity of nitrazepam (NZ) in Sprague-Dawley rats and ICR mice and to determine the metabolic factors which modulate susceptibility to the developmental effects of NZ. Rats were treated orally with a single dose of NZ at 300 mg/kg on Day 12 of gestation. Mice received one dose of 300 mg/kg NZ via gavage between Days 9 and 14 of gestation. NZ administration resulted in a significant incidence of malformations in rats, while no evidence of teratogenic action was observed in mice. Pronounced species differences in the metabolism of NZ were observed. In rats, 7-acetylaminonitrazepam (AANZ) was detected as the major metabolite in plasma and embryos, whereas in mice, only small amounts of this product were found. The rate of N-acetylation of 7-aminonitrazepam (ANZ) to AANZ was 8.5-fold greater in rat liver cytosol than that in mouse liver cytosol. In contrast, the rate of deacetylation of AANZ to ANZ was 9-fold greater in mouse liver microsomes than that in rat liver microsomes. The developmental effects of authentic metabolites of NZ were studied in the two species. A single oral administration of 300 mg/kg ANZ to pregnant animals produced a significant incidence of malformations in rats, but not in mice. On the other hand, AANZ was teratogenic in both species. These results suggest that the difference in the susceptibility to NZ-induced teratogenicity between rats and mice may be related to differences in the levels of N-acetyltransferase and deacetylase, and that AANZ may be involved in the teratogenic mechanism.",

Ninety patients between the ages of 2 and 7 years were randomly allocated into three groups in this double-blind parallel study. Blood samples were taken immediately after induction with halothane (Pre-S) and at 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 minutes after administration of suxamethonium (Post-S). Serum from these samples was analyzed in duplicate for potassium and sodium and the data analyzed statistically. The results showed that mean serum potassium levels tended to remain higher in the two groups that had received a benzodiazepine than in the controls at 5, 10, and 15 minutes Post-S. Although the increases in plasma potassium differed significantly from Pre-S at the various times within each patient group, no significant intergroup differences could be shown except at the 15 minute Post-S stage, when the mean serum potassium level of the placebo group was significantly closer to its Pre-S value than that of the diazepam group. At all stages Post-S the mean serum sodium levels for each of the three groups showed statistically significant decreases from their Pre-S values. However, no statistically significant intergroup differences could be shown.", 
    "72": "The management of status epilepticus has improved over the past 20 years, resulting in a substantial decrease in the associated morbidity and mortality. Patients who have seizures that are refractory to initial pharmacologic interventions tend to have significant underlying toxic, metabolic, structural, or infectious disorders, and therefore management of refractory status epilepticus must focus on stabilization and on identification and correction of seizure etiology. Regardless of etiology, the faster the seizures are brought under control, the better the prognosis. Risk of central nervous system injury increases after 30 minutes of seizure activity, and therefore efforts should focus on controlling the abnormal electrical discharges at the earliest time possible, preferably within one hour. Benzodiazepines, phenytoin, and phenobarbital remain the most commonly used first- and second-line anticonvulsants, have proven effective in cases of status epilepticus, and should be administered within the first 45 minutes of management. For refractory status epilepticus, pentobarbital anesthesia is evolving as an effective and recommended treatment modality and should be instituted immediately after phenytoin and phenobarbital loading. The role of other anticonvulsants remains to be investigated in controlled clinical trials.", 
    "73": "The effects of benzodiazepine dependence on the ability to learn and remember new material (determined with the Auditory-Verbal Learning Test) were studied in 20 detoxified, benzodiazepine-dependent patients who were 55 years of age or older and in a drug-dependence rehabilitation program. The patients were matched approximately for age, sex, and IQ with 20 detoxified, alcohol-dependent patients in the same rehabilitation program and 22 control subjects from a community sample. Neuropsychologic testing was performed a mean of 6 to 10 days after the patients had been completely detoxified from the addicting substance. The benzodiazepine-dependent patients had more difficulty with tests of learning and short-term and delayed recall than did the alcohol-dependent or control group. The difference between the benzodiazepine-dependent patients and the control group was statistically significant. The results suggest that benzodiazepine dependence in older people can cause memory impairment that persists into the early drug-free period.",

    "75": "The goals of this study were to assess the antipanic efficacy of a new, sustained-release formulation of alprazolam and to assess the safety and tolerability of once-a-day administration of 1-10 mg of sustained-release alprazolam.", 
    "76": "One hundred ninety-four patients with diagnosis of agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder with limited phobic avoidance underwent a 1-week placebo washout before being randomly assigned to groups receiving 8 weeks of double-blind treatment with either sustained-release alprazolam or placebo.", 
    "77": "There was a significant treatment effect favoring sustained-release alprazolam (highest mean dose = 4.7 mg/day) across almost all measures of anxiety, panic, and phobic avoidance, despite a significantly higher dropout rate in patients receiving placebo. Eighty-five percent of the patients treated with sustained-release alprazolam, compared with 61% of the patients given placebo, reported complete blockade of panic attacks by the end of 6 weeks of treatment. Sedation was the most commonly reported adverse effect. Discontinuation of sustained-release alprazolam was associated with moderate but transient levels of distress in 48% of the patients; discontinuation of placebo led to distress in only 10% of the patients. Nonetheless, there was no difference in the proportion of patients who were able to remain off the study drug for at least 2 weeks.", 
    "78": "These results suggest that sustained-release alprazolam is highly effective in the acute treatment of panic disorder at doses comparable to those in the originally marketed compressed tablet of alprazolam. The medication was well tolerated but showed rebound effects during a rapid drug taper after 6 weeks of treatment.", 
    "79": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors were studied in cultured neurons taken from rat hippocampus at early postnatal stages. GABA-induced whole-cell currents showed a broad range of peak amplitudes and time-courses of desensitization. Dose-response curves of rapidly and slowly desensitizing cells revealed EC50 values of 8.5 and 37.3 microM GABA, respectively, with the Hill coefficient being greater than unity. The main-state conductance of GABAA receptor channels was 28-31 pS in all cells. GABA responses of low-affinity cells were more strongly affected by benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g. flunitrazepam, clonazepam) and inverse agonists (e.g. methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate), as compared to cells exhibiting high-affinity GABA responses. Currents were also potentiated by zolpidem, but were little affected by Ro 15-4513 and Zn2+. These data suggest the presence of physiologically and pharmacologically distinct GABAA receptor isoforms in neurons of the early postnatal hippocampus, which may subserve different inhibitory control mechanisms in this brain region.", 
    "80": "Benzodiazepines, including diazepam and midazolam, have proved to be safe and effective for intravenous conscious sedation. Their selective anxiolytic activity and wide margin of safety contribute to their popularity. The recent introduction of the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil, provides flexibility and added safety for intravenous benzodiazepine sedation.", 
    "81": "Pediatric sedation is one of the most challenging areas of clinical practice. The goal of pediatric management is to accomplish treatment on a comfortable and cooperative child. While comfort may be achieved with or without drugs, cooperation may occasionally be achieved only when levels of sedation deepen to the point of obtunding the child. Anatomic and physiologic differences in the pediatric patient give high priority to airway management, oxygenation, and ventilation. Techniques for pediatric sedation and anesthesia are reviewed and recommendations are made for the rational selection of an appropriate pharmacological management technique.", 
    "82": "In 30 patients of rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis (MS) belonging to NYHA class II and III scheduled for closed mitral commissurotomy anaesthesia was induced with morphine 0.15 mg/kg followed by either thiopentone (group A, n = 15) or midazolam (group B, n = 15) titrated to produce sleep. Patients were intubated with pancuronium bromide in a dose of 0.12 mg/kg. Minimum mean arterial blood pressure following induction was significantly lower in thiopentone group (77 +/- 7 mm Hg) than midazolam group (85 +/- 6 mm Hg; P < 0.05). After intubation blood pressure was significantly higher in thiopentone group (99 +/- 8 mm Hg) than midazolam group patients (89 +/- 7 mm Hg). Heart rate was significantly higher in thiopentone treated patients both before and after endotracheal intubation. During surgery, three patients in group A had hypotensive episodes (mean arterial blood pressure 20% below basal at two successive readings 5 min apart) while one in group B had a hypotensive episode. Average duration of surgery was comparable between the two groups (102 +/- 15 and 95 +/- 18 min) and postoperatively there was no significant difference in sedation score and incidence of nausea and vomiting between the two groups.", 
    "83": "Two dose regimens of diazepam, conventional dose and loading dose, were randomly given for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal state in 21 and 20 male subjects, respectively. Total dose of diazepam in conventional and loading dose groups were 200 mg and 67 +/- 9.3 mg, respectively. Clinical response was comparable in both the groups. None of the subjects developed diazepam related side effects.", 
    "84": "A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic method has been developed for the determination of bromazepam, an anxiolytic benzodiazepine, in plasma. After a single-step extraction from alkalinized plasma with diethyl-ether in the presence of an internal standard (alpha-hydroxy-triazolam), the residues were chromatographed on a reversed-phase Nova Pak 5 microns C18 column, with a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water-triethylamine (700:300:4, v/v/v) adjusted to pH 7.4 with orthophosphoric acid. The limit of detection was 50 ng ml-1, using a 20 microliters injection with UV detection at 240 nm. Between-day and within-day relative standard deviations were lower than 6%. Studies of drug stability during sample storage at -20 degrees C and at +4 degrees C showed no degradation of bromazepam. However, bromazepam seemed to be degraded at ambient temperature, without any influence of light. This method is applied to the determination of bromazepam plasma levels in analytical toxicology.", 
    "85": "Evidence from earlier studies suggests that the antimanic activity of valproate becomes most pronounced within 1 to 4 days of achieving serum concentrations of 50 mg/L or greater. We conducted a prospective study to assess the onset of antimanic activity of oral loading dosages of valproate administered to achieve serum concentrations above 50 mg/L within 24 hours.", 
    "86": "Nineteen patients with bipolar disorder, manic phase, received divalproex sodium 20 mg/kg/day in divided dosages for 5 days, without other psychotropic agents except lorazepam up to 4 mg/day. Serum valproate concentrations were measured after 1 and 4 days of treatment. Improvement was measured daily by a blind rater using the Young Mania Rating Scale (MRS).", 
    "87": "Serum valproate concentrations greater than 50 mg/L were reached in all 15 patients completing the study. Ten (53%) of the 19 patients who received at least one complete loading dose displayed a significant (greater than 50%) reduction in MRS scores by study termination. These responders displayed the greatest percent change in MRS scores over the first 3 days of treatment. Side effects were minimal.", 
    "88": "Valproate can be safely administered by oral loading and may produce rapid onset of antimanic response in some patients.", 
    "89": "We describe a new high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for measurement of midazolam and its major metabolite, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, in clinical samples. Plasma or urine was mixed with 100 ng internal standard Ro 05-6669 and borate buffer, 0.1 M, pH 9. Midazolam and its related compounds were extracted into diethylether. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in HPLC mobile phase [methanol-isopropyl alcohol-perchloric acid, 0.5 microM (57:25:18)] and injected into the chromatograph. The separation of substances was performed on an Spherisorb S5CN 250 x 4.6 mm HPLC column maintained at 45 degrees C. The detection was performed by absorption measurement at 245 nm. At a flow rate of 1.7 ml/min, the retention times of Ro 05-6669, 1,4 dihydroxymidazolam, alpha-hydroxymidazolam, 4-hydroxymidazolam and midazolam were 4.0, 6.7, 7.8, 9.6, and 10.8 min, respectively. In the concentration range of 5-1,000 ng/ml, the calibration graphs for both compounds were linear. The coefficients of variation of the between-day and within-day assay were < 14% for the concentration range 5-10 and < 7% for the range 10-600 ng/ml. The limits of detection for midazolam and alpha-hydroxymidazolam were 2 and 4 ng/ml, respectively. This assay is more sensitive than earlier methods; it is simple and rapid, and it enables the quantification of midazolam and its alpha-hydroxy metabolite with very good precision and accuracy in human plasma and urine.", 
    "90": "One hundred and six HIV-positive drug users were tested with a two-tone auditory evoked potential (AEP) task and a small battery of neuropsychological tests, to examine the relationship between the latency of the P300 component (P3) of the AEP, intellectual function, mood and drug use. Principal components analysis revealed a significant correlation between P3 latency and the first principal component (r = -0.43, P < 0.001). Varimax rotation generated three orthogonal components which we interpreted as intellectual performance, memory, and mood. Intellectual performance and self-reported mood were individually correlated with P3 latency, but memory was not (r = -0.36, P < 0.001; r = 0.23, P < 0.05; and r = -0.18, NS, respectively). Subjects with symptomatic HIV disease had a higher correlation between P3 latency and intellectual performance than subjects with asymptomatic HIV disease and, among patients with symptomatic HIV disease, poorer memory was associated with a lower CD4 count. Opiate or benzodiazepine consumption did not correlate with poor intellectual performance, memory, or self-rated mood in our sample. These results indicate that there is a relationship between AEP latency and neuropsychological measures of intellectual function, and that it is influenced by subjective mood. Surprisingly, declared current drug use has no discriminable effect on these relationships.", 
    "91": "Early studies on the physiological effects of melatonin typically reported hypnotic 'side-effects'. Later studies, specifically addressing this action, failed to reliably replicate hypnotic effects using standard polysomnography. This difference may be related to differences in the basic physiological action of melatonin compared with more conventional hypnotics. It is suggested that melatonin exerts a hypnotic effect through thermoregulatory mechanisms. By lowering core body temperature, melatonin reduces arousal and increases sleep-propensity. Thus, in humans, one role of melatonin is to transduce the light-dark cycle and define a window-of-opportunity in which sleep-propensity is enhanced. As such, melatonin is likely to be an effective hypnotic agent for sleep disruption associated with elevated temperature due to low circulating melatonin levels. The combined circadian and hypnotic effects of melatonin suggest a synergistic action in the treatment of sleep disorders related to the inappropriate timing of sleep and wakefulness. Adjuvant melatonin may also improve sleep disruption caused by drugs known to alter normal melatonin production (e.g., beta-blockers and benzodiazepines). If melatonin is to be developed as a successful clinical treatment, differences between the pharmacological profile following exogenous administration and the normal endogenous rhythm should be minimized. Continued development as a useful clinical tool requires control of both the amplitude and duration of the exogenous melatonin pulse. There is a need to develop novel drug delivery systems that can reliably produce a square-wave pulse of melatonin at physiological levels for 8-10 hr duration.", 
    "92": "Over the past few years, the immunomodulating role of benzodiazepines (BDZ) has been reported in literature. In particular, diazepam is an inhibitory BDZ with regard to its effects on the phagocytic and metabolic activities of polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and monocytes, while triazolobenzodiazepines (alprazolam and triazolam) upregulate normal human peripheral blood T lymphocyte function. On these grounds, the administration of alprazolam (1 mg/per day for 1 month) in 13 patients with migraine without aura (MWA) and of lorazepam (2 mg/per day for 1 month) in 10 matched MWA subjects has been evaluated in terms of immune response. Results show that before administration of BDZ in both groups of patients phagocytosis and killing of PMN and monocytes were profoundly depressed and the same was true for the lymphocyte-dependent antibacterial activity. After one month treatment lorazepam further decreased lymphocyte function without modifying phagocytic capabilities. On the contrary, alprazolam increased PMN phagocytosis and killing and monocyte phagocytosis without modifying antibacterial activity values. Taken together, these results further support the existence of different classes of BDZ in terms of their immunomodulating capacities. Moreover, alprazolam seems to be a more appropriate BDZ for treating immunocompromised patients, even including MWA patients.", 
    "93": "Paralysis induced by neuromuscular blocking agents facilitates ventilation of seriously ill patients but may preclude clinical recognition of seizures. We describe the occurrence of severe cognitive impairment in a 14-year-old girl in whom status epilepticus was recognized only when pancuronium was withdrawn after 14 hours of paralysis. This patient emphasizes a potential danger of paralysis from drugs in patients with acute cerebral dysfunction.", 
    "94": "A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study was performed to assess the influence of one week of selective M1-muscarinic receptor blockade on pancreatic exocrine secretion in man. Ten healthy subjects received telenzepine (3 mg p.o.) and placebo each for 8 days, with a 6-day drug-free washout interval between treatment sequences. On Day 8 of each sequence, pancreatic secretion was stimulated for 2 h by infusion of submaximal secretin (0.2 U.kg/h) followed by maximal stimulation with secretin (1.0 U.kg/h) and ceruletide (120 ng.kg/h). Telenzepine had no significant effect on secretory parameters during submaximal stimulation with secretin. During maximal stimulation, total protein, secretory volume, and output of amylase, trypsin and bicarbonate were unexpectedly increased by telenzepine. These findings might be partially explained by removal of the inhibitory influence of pancreatic polypeptide, which was depressed by telenzepine. Acute studies have shown that M1-receptor antagonists inhibit exocrine secretion. Our results suggest that adaptation of physiological mechanisms governing the exocrine pancreas may occur after one week of receptor blockade by a therapeutic dosage of telenzepine, to the extent that M1-blockade no longer inhibits secretion.",

    "97": "Alcohol withdrawal delirium (AWD) requires treatment with an adequate sedative, anticonvulsant, and antipsychotic agent next to general intensive care measures. Optimal medication should have a rapid onset of action and the possibility of parenteral application. A specific antagonist should be available. Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine that fulfills all these criteria. Twenty five patients suffering from AWD (mean age 45 years) took part in an open trial and underwent treatment with infusions of flunitrazepam (concentration: 8 mg/250 ml NaCl; speed, 250 ml/hr). Psychopathological, vegetative, and vital parameters were assessed every hour. All patients survived. They were treated with a mean total dose (SD) of 83.9 (45.4) mg of flunitrazepam (1.3 mg/kg body weight), which induced sedation 13.2 (5.3) min after the initiation of intravenous treatment. The mean duration of AWD (85.1 +/- 39.4 hr) corresponded to other studies, whereas the frequency of preexisting and concomitant diseases was higher (92%) in our patients. A patient who suffered from bronchitis and had a nasopharyngeal tamponade showed severe respiratory depression after having received 4 mg of flunitrazepam. This complication remitted immediately when 0.5 mg of flumazenil was given intravenously. No epileptic manifestation was observed during the treatment or after discontinuation of flunitrazepam. Vegetative and psychopathological symptoms (tremor, sweating, hallucinations, confusion, and restlessness) remitted rapidly. Our data suggest that intravenous flunitrazepam can be an efficacious and safe alternative to traditional treatment strategies of AWD.", 
    "98": "We implanted closed cranial windows in ten cats in order to observe the response of pial vessel diameter by microscopy using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextran and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) by laser Doppler flowmetry during administration of midazolam and reversal with flumazenil. Midazolam was given at 0.8 mg.kg-1 x min-1 for 10 min and maintained at 0.04 mg.kg-1 x min-1 for 50 min (total 10 mg.kg-1). The diameter of arterioles and venules and rCBF showed no significant change. During the last 10 min of midazolam administration, flumazenil, given at 0.1 mg.kg-1 x min-1 for 10 min (total 1 mg.kg-1), caused an increase of MAP and rCBF (P < 0.01) at 5 min after infusion and diameter of larger arterioles (> 50 microns) and venules (50-100 microns) were dilated (P < 0.05). These results indicate that midazolam does not affect the diameter of cerebral arterioles and venules; however, the reversal effects of flumazenil against midazolam are transient vasodilation of larger arterioles accompanied by an elevation of MAP, and an increase in CBF.", 
    "99": "This is a prospective, open, randomized study comparing three different anaesthetic regimens with respect to haemodynamic stability (cardiac index and pressure measurements), ischaemia (ECG), and loss of awareness (midlatency auditory evoked potentials in 58 patients undergoing coronary artery surgery. Anaesthesia was based on fentanyl 0.01 mg kg-1 bw for induction and 0.8-2.0 mg h-1 in combination with nitrous oxide for maintenance before cardiopulmonary bypass and 0.2-0.6 mg h-1 without nitrous oxide during and after cardiopulmonary bypass. Eighteen patients were anaesthetised with flunitrazepam 0.01 mg kg-1 bw for induction and received thereafter 1-2 mg h-1 for maintenance (group F). In 40 patients anaesthesia was induced with etomidate and maintained with either isoflurane 0.4-1.2 vol% (group I) or propofol 4-10 mg kg-1 bw h-1 (group P). Vasodilators and inotropes were used for haemodynamic control when needed. Haemodynamic variables and ECG were studied at five timepoints (awake; after induction before surgery; after sternotomy; before cardiopulmonary bypass; and 20 min after separation from bypass). During surgical stimulation, vasodilators were needed significantly more frequently in group F, than in groups I and P. Surgery and sternotomy caused an increase in SVI and APs/SV in all groups. Differences between the groups were only found for systemic pressures, which after sternotomy were lowest in group I and before cardiopulmonary bypass were highest in group F. After termination of bypass all groups showed an increase in HR and a decrease in SVI, SVR, and LVSWI compared to the awake state, while CI remained unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "100": "In order to test the hypothesis that low-dose midazolam reduces excitatory cerebral symptoms by attenuating ketamine-induced increases in the cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen (CMRO2), we compared the cerebral effects of a combination of an anesthetic dose of ketamine hydrochloride (10.0 mg.kg-1 i.v.) and a subanaesthetic dose of midazolam maleate (0.25 mg.kg-1 i.v., n = 6; or 0.10 mg.kg-1 i.v., n = 6) with results recently obtained with ketamine (10.0 mg.kg-1 i.v.) in normoventilated pigs anaesthetized with fentanyl, nitrous oxide and pancuronium. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured with the intra-arterial 133Xe clearance technique, and CMRo2 was calculated from CBF and the cerebral arteriovenous oxygen content difference (CaVO2). The CMRO2 did not increase significantly. In contrast, the maximal increase in cerebral CaVo2 (by 56-59% at 10 min; P < 0.01) was similar to that induced by ketamine, since CBF was more depressed (by 35-45% at 1 min: P < 0.001) by ketamine-midazolam than by ketamine only. Midazolam was found to increase CVR (P < 0.01) and further depress CBF (P < 0.01), and to antagonize the ketamine-induced increase in CMRO2 (P < 0.05). Ketamine-induced effects on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and spectral electroencephalographic (EEG) voltage were not significantly altered by midazolam. The pharmacokinetics of ketamine, as measured during an 80-min period, were not affected by the concomitant administration of midazolam. We propose that a ketamine-midazolam combination comprising a low-dose fraction (1/100-1/40) of midazolam is superior to ketamine alone for anaesthetic use.", 
    "101": "We have studied the effects of bolus doses of midazolam 0.15 mg kg-1 i.v. on intracranial pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in 12 patients with severe head injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score < or = 6). The study was performed in patients aged 17-44 yr who were sedated (phenoperidine 20 micrograms kg-1 h-1) and paralysed (vecuronium 2 mg h-1). Midazolam reduced MAP from 89.0 mmHg to 75.0 mmHg (P < 0.0001), while CPP decreased from 71.0 mmHg to 55.8 mmHg (P < 0.0001). During the study, CPP decreased to less than 50 mmHg in four patients. Midazolam induced small, non-significant changes in ICP. However, when control ICP was less than 18 mmHg (n = 7 patients), an increase in ICP was observed. The remaining five patients (control ICP > or = 18 mmHg) exhibited a slight decrease in ICP. These findings suggest that bolus administration of midazolam should be performed with great caution in patients with severe head injury, especially when ICP is less than 18 mmHg.",

These so-called \"peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors\" occur ubiquitous in various tissues. Different actions on biological processes have been described to be connected with peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors, but their definite physiological role has not yet been clarified. this review covers basic findings of this second binding site for benzodiazepines, trying to present a survey about those binding sites and their putative biological role.", 
    "104": "Pharmacologic and biochemical data indicate a variety of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor subtypes. The identification of gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptor subunits and their isoforms has yielded a more refined characterization of the pharmacologic selectivity of these sites. Such structural diversity may explain the different responses noted with drugs acting through gamma-aminobutyric acidA receptors and makes possible the design of new agents capable of selectively manipulating this neurotransmitter system."
