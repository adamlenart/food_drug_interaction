    "0": "This study evaluated a cumulative dosing procedure for drug discrimination with human participants. Four participants learned to discriminate triazolam (0.35 mg/70 kg) from placebo. A crossover design was used to compare the results under a single dosing procedure with results obtained under a cumulative dosing procedure. Under the single dosing procedure, a dose of triazolam (0, 0.05, 0.15, or 0.35 mg/70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 75, or 175 mg/70 kg) was administered 45 min before assessment. Determining each dose-effect curve thus required four sessions. Under the cumulative dosing procedure, four doses of triazolam (0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.20 mg/70 kg) or secobarbital (0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/70 kg) were administered approximately 55 min apart, producing a complete dose-effect curve in one four-trial session. Regardless of procedure, triazolam and secobarbital produced discriminative stimulus and self-reported effects similar to previous single dosing studies in humans. Shifts to the right in cumulative dose-effect curves compared to single dose-effect curves occurred on several self-report measures. When qualitative stimulus functions rather than quantitative functions are of interest, application of cumulative dosing may increase efficiency in human drug discrimination.", 
    "1": "Previous studies have shown that the perceptual integration of component motions distributed across space is inhibited whenever segmentation cues, such as line-ends, are salient. Herein, we investigate to what extent enhanced inhibition induced by lorazepam, a benzodiazepine facilitating the fixation of GABA on GABAA receptors, modifies the balance between motion integration and motion segmentation at the behavioural level. Motion integration was tested in 16 healthy volunteers taking a single and oral dose of either placebo or lorazepam (0.038 mg kg-1). The stimulus consisted of an outlined diamond presented behind four, otherwise invisible, apertures and translating along a circular trajectory (Lorenceau & Shiffrar (1992). Vision Research, 32, 263-273). Under these conditions, recovering the global diamond direction requires the integration of the component motions available within each aperture. The observers were asked to discriminate the global, clockwise or counter-clockwise, diamond direction under difficult--at high luminance contrasts--or easy--at low luminance contrasts--conditions. Overall, reaction times and error rates increased in the lorazepam group as compared to the placebo group, suggesting strong non-specific effects. However, the changes in performance in the lorazepam group are not homogeneous across conditions, suggesting that lorazepam also induces specific effects that modulate the integration/segmentation balance. Additional experiments performed with visible apertures or visible diamond vertices indicate that the effects of lorazepam are unlikely to reflect a deficit of motion processing or motion integration mechanisms since performance is only slightly impaired in the lorazepam as compared to the placebo group under these conditions. These results suggest that lorazepam might specifically modulate the saliency of line-ends, presumably because processing these features involves inhibitory mechanisms using GABA as a neuromediator, and in turn modify the balance between motion integration and segmentation.",

    "3": "One hundred sixteen adult patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg hyoscyamine sulfate intravenous (n = 57) or placebo (n = 59). After administration of study drug, patients were given meperidine and midazolam. Parameters measured included the time required to reach the cecum, total procedure time, and the endoscopist's perception of the adequacy of sedation, difficulty of insertion, and amount of colonic spasm on insertion and withdrawal. Patients were given a postprocedure questionnaire assessing their experience.", 
    "4": "In patients receiving hyoscyamine, there was a shorter cecal intubation time (median 9.2 vs. 12.9 minutes; p = 0. 01), shorter total colonoscopy time (median 20.5 vs. 25.0 minutes; p = 0.01), better patient sedation (p = 0.02), easier colonic insertion (p = 0.001), and less spasm on insertion (p = 0.01). No difference was found in the amount of spasm during withdrawal or the total dosages of meperidine or midazolam used. Patients receiving hyoscyamine sulfate reported being more comfortable during their procedures ( p < 0.001) and were more willing to repeat colonoscopy in the future (p = 0.0001). The only adverse effect seen during the study was a 27% incidence of sinus tachycardia that occurred in patients receiving hyoscyamine.", 
    "5": "Premedication with intravenous hyoscyamine sulfate was beneficial in terms of the time required for cecal intubation, total procedure time, adequacy of sedation, and scales of patient comfort. However, the high frequency of sinus tachycardia seen with the dose used in our study, which was extremely rapid in two patients, indicates the need for further study before the drug can be recommended as a routine premedication for colonoscopy.",

    "7": "Ten adult patients with cirrhosis completed number connection tests before sedation for endoscopy and at discharge from the endoscopy unit 2 hours post-procedure. Control patients consisted of five patients with cirrhosis undergoing the same procedure for the same indication who did not receive sedation and 12 patients with no evidence of liver disease who received sedation before diagnostic endoscopy for a variety of GI complaints. The control populations were age, gender, education level, and, in the case of patients with cirrhosis, Child Pugh s score matched to the patients with cirrhosis who received sedation.", 
    "8": "The mean (+/- SEM) age of patients with cirrhosis who received sedation was 59.6 +/- 3.8 years. Seven of the ten (70%) were men. Their mean Child Pugh s score was 7.2 +/- 1.5. Nine of the ten (90%) had abnormal baseline number connection tests results (mean for the group 52.3 +/- 6.7 seconds) the extent of which correlated with Child Pugh s scores (p < 0.005). Individually, the baseline number connection tests results were normal in one (10%), mild in six (60%), moderate in one (10%), and severe in two (20%). After the procedure (before discharge) the mean number connection tests result was 61.5 +/- 7.9 seconds (p = 0.01 when compared with baseline). The results were now normal in none (0%), mild in four (40%), moderate in four (40%), and severe in two (20%). Pre- and post-procedure number connection tests results did not change in the non-sedated cirrhotic or sedated non-liver disease control patients.",

    "10": "Midazolam and diazepam are commonly used for conscious sedation, but their comparative respiratory depressive effects have not been accurately studied. We used a novel real-time, on-line, computerized data acquisition system to compare the two agents in a randomized double-blind study.", 
    "11": "One hundred patients undergoing colonoscopy were studied. The maximum end-tidal carbon dioxide tension (PetCO2) and the minimum oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO 2) were recorded by computer every minute. Patients received meperidine (25 to 50 mg) and incremental doses of either midazolam or diazepam to an identical end point of slurred speech and/or ptosis. Sedation was scored from 1 (unarousable) to 5 (wide awake).", 
    "12": "Sedation scores were 3.6 +/- 0.1 (mean +/- standard error) after each agent. The doses of midazolam and diazepam were 0. 031 +/- 0.002 and 0.106 +/- 0.009 mg/kg, respectively. In the first 45 minutes (PetCO2) was significantly higher with midazolam than with diazepam (p < 0.05). SpO2 was significantly depressed for 80 minutes after each agent, and the number of minutes when the minimum Sp O2 was less than 90% did not differ between the two agents.", 
    "13": "Midazolam was 3.4 times more potent than diazepam. The duration of oxygen desaturation emphasizes the importance of monitoring SpO2 until ventilation and oxygenation have recovered. Although the degree of hypoxemia was comparable, midazolam led to higher end-tidal carbon dioxide tensions.", 
    "14": "Adequate patient sedation is mandatory for diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The short-acting anesthetic propofol offers certain potential advantages for endoscopic procedures, but controlled studies proving its superiority over benzodiazepines for ERCP are lacking.", 
    "15": "During a 6-month period 198 consecutive patients undergoing routine ERCP randomly received either midazolam (n = 98) or propofol (n = 99) for sedation. Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation) were continuously monitored and procedure-related parameters, the recovery time and quality (recovery score) as well as the patient's cooperation and tolerance of the procedure (visual analog scales) were prospectively assessed.", 
    "16": "Patients receiving propofol or midazolam were well matched with respect to demographic and clinical data, ERCP findings, and the performance of associated procedures. Propofol caused a more rapid onset of sedation than midazolam (p < 0.01). Clinically relevant changes in vital signs were observed at comparable frequencies with temporary oxygen desaturation occurring (< 85 %) in 6 patients in the propofol group and 4 patients receiving midazolam (not significant). However, an episode of apnea had to be managed by mask ventilation via an ambu bag (lasting 8 minutes) in one of the patients receiving propofol sedation. Mean recovery times as well as the recovery scores were significantly shorter with propofol (p < 0. 01). Propofol provided significantly better patient cooperation than midazolam ( p < 0.01), but procedure tolerability was rated the same by both groups of patients (not significant).",

    "18": "The aim of this study was to determine whether benzodiazepine tolerance might provide a predictive marker for persistent aggression in schizophrenia. Seventy-seven male schizophrenic patients newly admitted to our psychiatric intensive care unit due to violent behavior during a 4-month period were examined. As a result, a high dose of benzodiazepine required for sedation or a short duration until regaining consciousness after the initial sedation, was related to severer aggression on waking up after sedation. Despite the small number of subjects examined, a conservative claim can be made that the level of the effect of benzodiazepine required for sedation seems to predict persistent severe aggression in schizophrenia.", 
    "19": "Benzodiazepines are the most commonly prescribed psychotropic drug in the elderly. Benzodiazepines with a long duration of action can produce marked sedation and psychomotor impairment in older people, and are associated with an increased risk of hip fracture and of motor vehicle crash. One thousand seven hundred and one individuals of 65 years and over, identified from General Practitioner lists, were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State-AGECAT package and current psychotropic drug use was recorded. Benzodiazepines were classified as having a short or long elimination half-life. Two hundred and ninety-five (17.3%) individuals were taking a benzodiazepine, with use in females being twice that in males. Of the 295, 152 (51.5%) were taking a long acting benzodiazepine and the use of long acting anxiolytic type benzodiazepines was particularly common. Fifty-two (17.6%) benzodiazepine users were taking one or more other psychotropic drugs. A benzodiazepine was used by eight of 18 (44.4%) subjects with an anxiety disorder, 62 of 180 (34.4%) individuals with depression, and seven of 71 (9.9%) people with dementia. Four-fifths of older people on a psychotropic drug were taking a benzodiazepine, highlighting the importance of this class of drug in the elderly population. The choice of a benzodiazepine with a long duration of action, which have been shown to be associated with serious adverse events in the elderly in over one half of benzodiazepine users, is of concern. The potential for adverse effects was further accentuated by polypharmacy practices. The choice of benzodiazepine for an older person has important consequences and should be addressed in greater detail with primary care.", 
    "20": "The role of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptors in modulating social separation-induced distress vocalizations (DVocs) and stress-induced analgesia (SIA) were examined in 8-day-old cockerels (Gallus gallus). In Experiment 1, the BZ agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 5.0 mg/kg) reversed both DVocs and SIA in isolated chicks. Coadministration of the BZ antagonist flumazenil (0.01, 0.03, or 0.10 mg/kg) reversed CDP anxiolytic effects. In Experiment 2, the BZ agonists alprazolam (ALP; 0.065, 0.125, 0.25, or 1.50 mg/kg) and lorazepam (LOR; 0.125, 0.25, 0.50, or 1.0 mg/kg) dose dependently reversed social separation-induced DVocs and SIA. The ED50s for ALP and LOR in attenuating DVocs were 0.19 and 0.34 mg/kg, respectively. These data strongly support the theory that CDP anxiolytic effects are mediated by BZ receptor activity in the chick social separation procedure (Experiment 1) and that this model is sensitive to BZ agonists of different potencies (Experiment 2).",

    "25": "Previous evidence has shown that rats exposed to a place preference apparatus prefer the novel compartment over the familiar. While this suggests that novelty is rewarding, an alternative interpretation is that rats avoid the familiar compartment because it is associated with some stress-related aversive event induced during the inescapable exposure sessions. To test this latter possibility, the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam (0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0 mg/kg) and the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic gepirone (0.1, 0.3, 1.0 mg/kg) were examined for their ability to alter novelty-induced place preference in rats. As expected, control animals showed a novelty-induced place preference. On the test day, this preference was disrupted by diazepam, but only at a dose (3 mg/kg) that also decreased locomotor activity. Gepirone failed to alter the preference behavior, even at a dose (1 mg/kg) that decreased locomotor behavior. In another experiment, rats spent more time in a familiar compartment that contained a novel object than in a familiar compartment with no object. These experiments indicate that preference for the novel compartment may reflect the rewarding effect of novelty rather than aversion to the familiar.", 
    "26": "The present study examined effects of diazepam (DZP) alone or in combination with delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on feeding behavior as well as body weight in male ddY strain mice at 5 weeks of age. Because we saw no hyperphagic effect of DZP with or without THC in mice, we explored the hyperphagia elicitable by DZP. THC [2 (THC2) or 4 (THC4) mg/kg/day s.c.] was given daily for 7 days. For the last day the mice were starved and injected i.p. with DZP (2 mg/kg) 10 min prior to a food or maze test. Controls received vehicle injections. Feeding behavior was measured after giving food for 2 hr. THC4 significantly reduced body weight gain. DZP, with or without THC, induced hyperphagia. THC4 alone also induced hyperphagia that was not significantly affected by DZP. Time taken to find food was extended by DZP and further with THC. Both DZP and THC can therefore interact on food ingestion but synergize on food seeking in mice through different mechanisms.",

Group I received intermittent epidural bupivacaine (2.5 mg.ml-1) 6 ml every 2 h. When necessary, an indomethacin suppository and then a single epidural shot of bupivacaine (2.5 mg.ml-1) 6 ml was administered. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, analgesic area, analgesia score, and sedation score were monitored for 12 h postoperatively. Memory and frequencies of supplemental analgesia (indomethacin suppositories and epidural bupivacaine) were also checked.",

The patients were premedicated with midazolam and anesthesia was induced i.v. with propofol or by inhalation and maintained with halothane or sevoflurane in N2O/O2 via face mask. Recovery was assessed by a \"blinded\" observer using a postanesthetic recovery score. Agitation and pain were judged using a visual analog scale. The incidence of vomiting was noted. The day after anesthesia older children and parents of younger children were interviewed about their experience of the anesthesia and recovery period.",

Median time from end of administration of inhalational agent to spontaneous eye opening was less after sevoflurane (25 min) than after halothane (48 min), (P < 0.01). Likewise, recovery was faster after sevoflurane anesthesia (P < 0.05). Agitation, but not pain, occurred more frequently after sevoflurane than after halothane (P < 0.05) and agitation was significantly more common in younger children. There was no difference in duration of hospital stay between day-care patients in the two groups.",

Drug mentions, a measure of patient contacts in which drug therapy is recommended, with a physician-indicated desired action of \"promote sleep\" or \"sedative night\" were compiled for each year. Z-scores were calculated to determine statistical differences over time for total drug mentions, drug mentions by category (hypnotics, non-hypnotic benzodiazepines, antidepressants, or other), and for some individual drugs.", 
    "41": "Total drug mentions for the treatment of insomnia fell 24.4% from 1987 to 1996. From 1987 to 1996 hypnotic mentions decreased 53.7%, antidepressants increased 146%, \"other\" drugs decreased by 63.2%, and benzodiazepine non-hypnotics remained relatively unchanged.", 
    "42": "Since 1987, overall pharmacological treatment of insomnia has decreased substantially although surveys indicate a stable or increasing prevalence of sleep disturbance. There has also been a dramatic shift to use of antidepressants in lieu of hyponotics for the symptomatic treatment of insomnia despite a paucity of data regarding their efficacy and the potential for serious side effects.", 
    "43": "This review provides an overview of preclinical and clinical evidence of a role for the neuroactive peptides cholecystokinin (CCK), corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), neuropeptide Y (NPY), tachykinins (i.e., substance P, neurokinin [NK] A and B), and natriuretic peptides in anxiety and/or stress-related disorders. Results obtained with CCK receptor antagonists in animal studies have been highly variable, and clinical trials with several of these compounds in anxiety disorders have been unsuccessful so far. However, future investigations using CCK receptor antagonists with better pharmacokinetic characteristics and animal models other than those validated with the classical anxiolytics benzodiazepines may permit a more precise evaluation of the potential of these compounds as anti-anxiety agents. Results obtained with peptide CRF receptor antagonists in animal models of anxiety convincingly demonstrated that the blockade of central CRF receptors may yield anxiolytic-like activity. However, the discovery of nonpeptide and more lipophilic CRF receptor antagonists is essential for the development of these agents as anxiolytics. Similarly, there is clear preclinical evidence that the central infusion of NPY and NPY fragments selective for the Y1 receptor display anxiolytic-like effects in a variety of tests. However, synthetic nonpeptide NPY receptor agonists are still lacking, thereby hampering the development of NPY anxiolytics. Unlike selective NK1 receptor antagonists, which have variable effects in anxiety models, peripheral administration of selective NK2 receptor antagonists and central infusion of natriuretic peptides produce clear anxiolytic-like activity. Taken as a whole, these findings suggest that compounds targeting specific neuropeptide receptors may become an alternative to benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "44": "The management of agitation and aggression in psychiatric inpatients is a significant clinical dilemma. Establishing a clear diagnosis and distinguishing whether aggression is an acute manifestation or a long-standing or repetitive problem are fundamental antecedents of medication treatment. For acute aggression, either benzodiazepines or antipsychotic medications (typical and atypical) are recommended choices. Currently, on the basis of efficacy, ease of use, and availability in multiple (tablet, liquid, intramuscular) preparations, typical antipsychotics such as loxapine should be considered as first choice for acute aggression (in psychosis). On the other hand, atypical antipsychotics, particularly clozapine, should be considered when aggression in psychosis persists and/or is repetitive. Typical antipsychotics are indicated for persistent aggression in psychosis when medication noncompliance is the obstacle to effective treatment.", 
    "45": "Three atypical antipsychotics are currently considered to be first-line therapies for schizophrenia, namely risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Deciding which one of these agents to choose for any given patient can be a daunting task because head-to-head comparisons of these 3 agents are just beginning, and most published trials are comparisons with typical antipsychotics, not with another atypical antipsychotic. Furthermore, results from clinical trials often do not match findings from clinical practice. Thus, guidelines for selection and use of the atypical antipsychotics are evolving from controlled studies as well as from clinical judgment based on the practical use of these agents once they have entered clinical practice. The atypical properties of first-line atypical antipsychotics as well as clozapine are reviewed here, with clinical pearls and dosing tips for each based upon a consensus of information from both clinical trials and clinical practice. The conventional antipsychotic loxapine is also reviewed and proposed as a potentially valuable agent to augment atypical antipsychotics when patients do not experience an acceptable treatment response from monotherapy with an atypical antipsychotic. By integrating information from clinical trials and clinical practice, the prescriber can be in a better position to choose which atypical antipsychotic to select for any given patient.", 
    "46": "The advent of a number of new antipsychotics has been paralleled by efforts to better delineate their mechanisms of action and, in doing so, further our understanding of schizophrenia and its pathophysiology. Technological advances, such as positron emission tomography (PET), have proven to be powerful tools in this process, allowing us to evaluate in vivo models based primarily on in vitro evidence. Combined serotonin-2/dopamine-2 (5-HT2/D2) antagonism represents one such model, and we now have PET evidence available that can be extrapolated to our understanding and clinical use of both conventional and novel antipsychotics.", 
    "47": "Clinical research into the etiology of ethanol withdrawal seizures has shown an increase in the number and severity of seizures with increasing numbers of withdrawal episodes. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of multiple ethanol withdrawals on the seizure sensitivity to the GABA(A) receptor inverse agonist Ro15-4513. In this study, three groups of laboratory rats received varying amounts of either continuous or intermittent ethanol exposure. A fourth group (Naive) received no ethanol exposure. Eight hours following the last withdrawal from chronic ethanol exposure, animals were tested for sensitivity to Ro15-4513-induced motor convulsions. Seizure sensitivity was significantly increased in all ethanol-treated groups compared to ethanol-naive controls, which did not exhibit any convulsive responses to this dose of Ro15-4513. Furthermore, rats exposed to multiple ethanol withdrawals exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to drug-induced seizures than did animals experiencing only a single ethanol withdrawal. Although the specific mechanism of this enhanced convulsant effect of Ro15-4513 following multiple ethanol withdrawals remains to be determined, these results suggest an involvement of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors in this multiple withdrawal phenomenon.", 
    "48": "Spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY) were trained under paced FCN schedules of reinforcement to complete a minimum number of consecutive responses on one lever, before responding on a second. The levers were retracted from the test chamber for a short period after each response to control the speed at which the rats could complete the sequence (paced FCN). Changes in the average chain length may reflect the influence of impulsivity on the execution of behavioral patterns. Although they quickly learned to press the levers, SHR rats performed poorly compared to the WKY rats when the chain length requirement was increased to FCN 6 and FCN 8. Eventually stable performance was obtained under paced FCN 6, although the SHR rats continued to have a consistently lower average chain length. Both strains of rats were treated with imipramine (10 mg/kg), chlordiazepoxide (3 and 10 mg/kg), d-amphetamine (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg), WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg), and DOI (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg). The SHR rats were less sensitive to the effects of d-amphetamine, chlordiazepoxide, and DOI and slightly more sensitive to the effects of haloperidol. All of these drugs reduced the average chain length. There was no difference in the response of the two strains to imipramine and 8-OH-DPAT, both of which increased the average chain length. These results support the suggestion that SHR rats may more impulsive than WKY rats. The data with d-amphetamine and haloperidol support biochemical findings that these rats have a deficit in dopaminergic function, and the strain differences in response to chlordiazepoxide and DOI suggest that that there may be differences in GABAergic and 5-HT2-mediated neurotransmission relevant to regulating impulse control in the rat.", 
    "49": "The elevated T-maze, an ethologically based test, has been used to investigate the effects of anxiolytic drugs on memory and the relationships between neural systems involved in such modulation. This test allows the measurement in the same rat of two kinds of aversively motivated behaviors--inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape. The apparatus consists of three arms of equal dimensions, elevated 50 cm from the floor. One arm is enclosed by walls and stands perpendicular to the two open arms. Placing the rat at the end of the enclosed arm and recording the time to withdraw from this arm during three consecutive trials assesses inhibitory avoidance. Soon afterwards, the rat is placed at the end of one of the open arms and the time to leave this arm recorded as escape response. Three days later memory is assessed by reexposing the rats to the maze. One critical question raised by these studies is whether the anterograde amnesia induced by anxiolytic drugs could be due to insufficient learning during training or to amnesia. The present work investigated whether the introduction of a multitrial training-to-criterion procedure could overcome this question. For this purpose, rats were tested as many times as needed to stay in the enclosed arm continuously for 300 s (avoidance learning to criterion). Results from Experiment 1 showed that rats trained to a learning criterion shows significantly better retention performance. Experiment 2 evaluated the effects of pretraining diazepam (DZP) treatment on this training-to-criterion protocol. The results indicate that DZP did not affect acquisition performance but induced a dose-dependent impairment of the inhibitory avoidance in the memory test. One-way escape (latency to enter the enclosed compartment from the open arms) was not affected by DZP. These results rule out the possibility that the impairment of inhibitory avoidance memory in the elevated T-maze could be due to lack of learning during training, and support the hypothesis that the disruptive effects of DZP are on processes involved in long-term storage of information.", 
    "50": "High concentrations of diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) mRNA have been detected in astrocytoma, suggesting that DBI-derived peptides may play a role in glial cell proliferation. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of a processing product of DBI, the octadecaneuropeptide ODN, on DNA synthesis in cultured rat astrocytes. At very low concentrations (10(-14) to 10(-11) M), ODN caused a dose-dependent increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation. At higher doses (10(-10) to 10(-5) M), the effect of ODN gradually declined. The central-type benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (10(-6) M) completely suppressed the stimulatory action of ODN whereas the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor ligand, PK11195 (10(-6) M) had no effect. The ODN-induced stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation was mimicked by methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM). The GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline (10(-4) M) suppressed the effect of both ODN and DMCM on DNA synthesis. Exposure of cultured astrocytes to the specific GABAA agonist 3APS (10(-10) to 10(-4) M) also induced a dose-related increase of [3H]thymidine incorporation. The present study indicates that ODN, acting through central-type benzodiazepine receptors associated with the GABAA receptor complex, stimulates DNA synthesis in rat glial cells. These data provide evidence for an autocrine role of endozepines in the control of glial cell proliferation.", 
    "51": "The anticholinergic drug orphenadrine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study we evaluate the neuroprotective effects of orphenadrine on excitotoxicity in vivo and in vitro. Orphenadrine prevented the mitochondrial and the cytoplasmic membrane potential decrease evoked by NMDA (100 microM) in rat dissociated cerebellar granule cells showing an IC50 value of 11.6 +/- 4.7 microM (mean +/- SEM, n = 5) and 13.5 +/- 2.3 microM (n = 3), respectively. Orphenadrine was able to protect cerebellar granule cell cultures from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Kainic acid (KA, 10 mg/kg)-induced excitotoxicity was evaluated in vivo using the microglial marker peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) and heat shock protein 72 (HSP72) expression in the hippocampus. The Bmax of PBR for control tissues was 589.1 +/- 40.0 fmol/mg protein (n = 4), increasing to 1692.5 +/- 51.6 fmol/mg protein (n = 5) after the KA treatment. Pretreatment with orphenadrine (10 mg/kg) blocked the KA-induced increase in PBR density. As expected, KA-administration induced the expression of HSP72 that was blocked in the orphenadrine + KA-treated rats. We demonstrate that orphenadrine, interacting at the NMDA receptor, is able to prevent the neurotoxicity mediated by activation at glutamate ionotropic receptors.", 
    "52": "Interest in the fundamental mechanisms underlying headache, particularly the pathophysiology of migraine and cluster headache, has lead to the study of the physiology and pharmacology of the trigeminovascular system and its central ramifications. Cats were anaesthetized (60 mg/kg alpha-chloralose, i.p., along with halothane for all surgical procedures) and prepared for physiological monitoring. The animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame and ventilated. A midline craniotomy and C2 laminectomy were performed for access to the superior sagittal sinus and C2 dorsal horn, respectively. The sinus was isolated from the underlying cortex and stimulated electrically after the animals had been paralysed with gallamine (6 mg/kg, i.v.). Units linked to stimulation were recorded with a tungsten-in-glass microelectrode placed in the most caudal part of the trigeminal nucleus, the trigeminocervical complex. Signals from the neurons were amplified, filtered and passed to a microcomputer, where post-stimulus histograms were constructed on-line to analyse the responses to stimulation. Units responded to sagittal sinus stimulation with a typical latency of 8-10 ms. All units studied had a probability of firing of 0.6 or greater. Intravenous injection of the non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, dizocilpine maleate (4 mg/kg, i.v.), resulted in a substantial and prolonged blockade of firing of units in the trigeminocervical complex. Similarly, administration of the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate excitatory amino acid receptor blocker, GYKI 52466, lead to a dose-dependent inhibition of trigeminovascular-evoked responses in the trigeminocervical complex. These data demonstrate the participation of both N-methyl-D-aspartate- and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated mechanisms in transmission within the trigeminocervical complex, and suggest a clear preclinical role of glutamatergic mechanisms in primary headache syndromes, such as migraine and cluster headache.", 
    "53": "This study was undertaken to evaluate the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of the limited component versus the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) component of comprehensive toxicologic screens in children. A retrospective patient series was studied at the emergency department (ED) of Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital, an urban, tertiary-care ED, consisting of all patients younger than 19 years of age who had a comprehensive toxicologic screen between January 1994 and July 1995. The comprehensive test included a broad-spectrum HPLC component as well as a limited component that examined serum for ethanol, aspirin, and acetaminophen and urine for benzodiazepines, barbiturates, amphetamines, cocaine, phencyclidine, and opiates. All toxicologic screens were reviewed for the presence of exogenous toxins, followed by a chart review of all patients with positive screens and a selection of negative screens. Toxins were categorized as (1) iatrogenic or noniatrogenic, (2) clinically or nonclinically suspected by history and physical, and (3) clinically or nonclinically significant. Comprehensive toxicology screens were performed in 463 cases during the study period; 234 (51%) were positive for exogenous toxins. In 227 of 234 positive screens (97%), toxins were either suspected by history and/or physical, were present on the limited portion of the toxicology screen, or were clinically insignificant. The remaining 7 of the 234 positive screens (3%) were clinically significant and detected solely by the broad-spectrum HPLC portion of the comprehensive screen. However, in none of these 7 cases was patient management clinically altered as a result of the positive screen. The total additional cost for the HPLC component was $16,205 ($35x463), an average distributive charge of $2,315 per patient in whom the HPLC portion provided additional clinical information ($16,205/7). Although adding significant charges to the evaluation of suspected toxic exposures in children, the HPLC component of the comprehensive drug screen was of no additional clinical benefit compared with its limited component alone.", 
    "54": "We investigated the use of hypnotics in nursing homes and old age homes in the county of Sogn og Fjordane, Norway. Data on administration of hypnotics on 3 separate days within a week in August 1995 was obtained from the drug administration records in 31 institutions. Twenty-five percent of the 1062 patients in the institutions used hypnotics, with no difference between patients from nursing homes and old age homes. The number of patients treated with hypnotics, the doses administered, and the time of administration were similar for weekends and workdays. About 100% of the hypnotics were used as scheduled, and 29% of the doses administered were higher than the recommended lowest dose for elderly patients. Furthermore, about 50% of the hypnotics administered were long-acting benzodiazepines. The results indicate a need for a review of the prescribing of hypnotics in geriatric institutions.", 
    "55": "Sedative effects of medetomidine at 20 micrograms/kg and midazolam at 0.3 mg/kg (MM), acepromazine at 0.05 mg/kg and butorphanol at 0.2 mg/kg (AB), and midazolam at 0.1 mg/kg and butorphanol at 0.2 mg/kg (MB) were compared in dogs. All dogs given MM were laterally recumbent within 11 min of the administration of the drugs, and this combination also induced deep sedation accompanied by analgesia and muscle relaxation, and strongly depressed arousal reactions to external stimuli. However, undesirable effects such as bradycardia and decreased respiration were also observed in dogs given MM. Six of seven dogs given AB were laterally recumbent within 16 min of the administration of the drugs, and this combination induced relatively deep sedation but only a mild depression of arousal reactions to external stimuli. MB induced mild or moderate sedation with relatively large differences in effects among individuals. The recovery from sedation in each group was smooth and total recovery times were not significantly different.", 
    "56": "Women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMS) report negative mood premenstrually, and increased food cravings and food intake. Although the benzodiazepine alprazolam has been used to treat PMS, alprazolam has been shown to increase food intake. The present study investigated the acute effects of alprazolam (0, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 mg) on food intake in 19 women with PMS. Each dose was tested once during the premenstrual phase and again during the postmenstrual phase. Each session, before drug administration, participants completed a Food Desirability Questionnaire and selected lunch, which was consumed 3.5 h after drug administration. Desire for foods containing fat were significantly increased premenstrually compared to postmenstrually, while desires for carbohydrate (CHO) alone and beverages did not change as a function of menstrual cycle phase. Cognitive Restraint scores predicted the amount of food consumed, i. e. restrained eaters consumed less food at lunch. Alprazolam significantly increased food intake, specifically fat, premenstrually compared to postmenstrually. Restrained eaters consumed 26% more calories premenstrually following 0.75 mg alprazolam relative to placebo, whereas unrestrained eaters consumed 9% more calories. Thus, women with PMS, particularly restrained eaters, are more sensitive to the food-intake increasing effects of alprazolam premenstrually.", 
    "57": "We investigated the role of alpha2C-adrenoceptors in the modulation of spatial and non-spatial navigation behaviour. Alpha2C-adrenoceptor overexpressing mice developed an ineffective thigmotaxic search pattern characterized by swimming close to the pool walls during both spatial and non-spatial water maze training. A subtype-non-selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole (1000 microg/kg, s.c.), fully reversed this impairment in their search strategy. Withdrawal of atipamezole at the end of spatial training resulted in an immediate disruption of the search pattern in alpha2C-adrenoceptor overexpressing mice. The swimming pattern of alpha2C-adrenoceptor overexpressing mice during a five day free swimming period was normal, when no cognitive component was required. Diazepam (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.p.), neither improved the accuracy in finding the platform nor decreased thigmotaxis. These results suggest that alpha2C-adrenoceptors may modulate the execution of complex navigation patterns.", 
    "58": "The effect of prolonged benzodiazepine administration on GABA(A) receptor subunit (alpha1-6, beta1-3, gamma2) messenger RNAs was investigated in the rat hippocampus and cortex, among other brain areas. Rats were orally administered flurazepam for one week, a protocol which results in benzodiazepine anticonvulsant tolerance in vivo, and in the hippocampus in vitro, in the absence of behavioral signs of withdrawal. Autoradiographs of brain sections, hybridized with [35S]oligoprobes in situ, were examined immediately (day 0) or two days after drug treatment, when rats were tolerant, or seven days after treatment, when tolerance had reversed, and were compared to sections from pair-handled, vehicle-treated controls. Alpha1 subunit messenger RNA level was significantly decreased in CA1 pyramidal cells and dentate granule cells at day 0, an effect which persisted only in CA1 neurons. Decreased \"alpha1-specific\" silver grain density over a subclass of interneurons at the pyramidal cell border suggested concomitant regulation of interneuron GABA(A) receptors. A reduction in beta3 subunit messenger RNA levels was more widespread among hippocampal cell groups (CA1, CA2, CA3 and dentate gyrus), immediately and two days after treatment, and was also detected in the frontal and parieto-occipital cortices. Changes in beta2 subunit messenger RNA levels in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus cells two days after ending flurazepam treatment suggested a concomitant up-regulation of beta2 messenger RNA. There was a trend toward an increased level of alpha5, beta3 and gamma2 subunit messenger RNAs in CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus cells, which was significant for the beta3 and gamma2 subunit messenger RNAs in the frontal cortex seven days after ending flurazepam treatment. There were no flurazepam treatment-induced changes in any other GABA(A) receptor subunit messenger RNAs. The messenger RNA levels of three (alpha1, beta2 and beta3) of nine GABA(A) receptor subunits were discretely regulated as a function of time after ending one-week flurazepam treatment related to the presence of anticonvulsant tolerance, but not dependence. The findings suggested that a localized switch in the subunit composition of GABA(A) receptor subtypes involving these specific subunits may represent a minimal requirement for the changes in GABA(A) receptor-mediated function recorded previously at hippocampal CA1 GABAergic synapses, associated with benzodiazepine anticonvulsant tolerance.", 
    "59": "It has previously been shown that M1 cholinergic receptors are involved in the parenchymal response to inhaled methacholine in puppies using the M1 selective antagonist pirenzepine. Although M3 receptors are responsible for acetylcholine induced bronchoconstriction in isolated rat lung, the role of M1 receptors has not been determined in the rat in vivo.", 
    "60": "Anaesthetised, paralysed, open chested Brown Norway rats were mechanically ventilated and the femoral vein cannulated for intravenous injection of drugs. Low frequency forced oscillations were applied to measure lung input impedance (ZL) and computerised modelling enabled separation of ZL into airway and parenchymal components. Atropine (500 microg/kg iv) and pirenzepine (50, 100 or 200 microg/kg iv) were administered during steady state constriction generated by continuous inhalation (1 mg/ml) or intravenous (10 or 15 microg/kg/min) administration of methacholine.", 
    "61": "Continuous inhalation of methacholine produced a 185% increase in frequency dependent tissue resistance (G) which was effectively inhibited by atropine 500 microg/kg iv (p<0.01, n = 6). Pirenzepine (50, 100 or 200 microg/kg) had a minimal effect on the parenchymal response to inhaled methacholine. A 258% increase in airway resistance (Raw) was induced by continuous intravenous infusion of methacholine and this response was effectively abolished by pirenzepine (p<0.001, n = 5). Cutting the vagi in the cervical region did not alter baseline airway mechanics. Vagotomy did not affect lung responses to intravenous methacholine nor the ability of pirenzepine to reduce these responses.",

    "63": "The effects of a single convulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 45 mg/kg i.p.) on rat brain gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors were studied. Selected GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs were measured by Northern blot analysis (with beta-actin mRNA as a standard). Four hours after PTZ, the GABAA receptor gamma2-mRNA was decreased in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum; alpha1-mRNA was decreased in cerebellum; and beta2 subunit mRNA was decreased in cortex and cerebellum. The alpha5 subunit mRNA level was not altered. Those mRNAs that had been reduced were increased in some brain regions at the 24-h time point, and these changes reverted to control levels by 48 h. PTZ effect on GABAA receptors was also studied by autoradiographic binding assay with the benzodiazepine agonist [3H]flunitrazepam (FNP), the GABAA agonist [3H]muscimol, and the benzodiazepine antagonist [3H]flumazenil. There was an overall decrease in [3H]FNP binding 12 but not 24 h after PTZ treatment. In contrast, [3H]muscimol binding was minimally affected, and [3H]flumazenil binding was unchanged after PTZ treatment. Additional binding studies were performed with well-washed cerebral cortical homogenates to minimize the amount of endogenous GABA. There was no PTZ effect on specific [3H]FNP binding. However, there was a significant reduction in the stimulation of [3H]FNP binding by GABA. The results showed that an acute injection of PTZ caused transient changes in GABAA receptor mRNA levels without altering receptor number but affected the coupling mechanism between the GABA and benzodiazepine sites of the GABAA receptor.", 
    "64": "The benzodiazepine receptor ligand U-78875 [3-(5-cyclopro pyl-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-5-(1-methylethyl)imidazol(1, 5-a)quinoxalin-4(5H)-o-ne] was studied in rats trained to discriminate i.p. 1.0 mg/kg lorazepam, 1.0 mg/kg diazepam, or 10 mg/kg pentobarbital, and baboons trained to discriminate oral 1.8 mg/kg lorazepam or 10 mg/kg pentobarbital. U-78875 doses were 0.01 to 10 mg/kg i.p. in rats and 0.32 to 56 mg/kg orally in baboons. U-78875 occasioned drug-appropriate responding in pentobarbital-trained (ED50 = 1.8 mg/kg) and diazepam-trained (ED50 = 0.056 mg/kg) rats, but it occurred in only one pentobarbital-trained baboon and not in the majority of lorazepam-trained baboons or rats. In baboons that generalized to U-78875, discriminative effects were antagonized by flumazenil. The interaction of U-78875 with pentobarbital, diazepam, and lorazepam revealed further differences in its behavioral effects. U-78875 potentiated the effects of pentobarbital, even in baboons that did not generalize to U-78875, but U-78875 had little effect in combination with diazepam. In lorazepam-trained animals that did not generalize to it, U-78875 antagonized lorazepam's effects, but U-78875 neither antagonized nor potentiated lorazepam in animals that did generalize to U-78875. Thus, although U-78875 generally functioned as a benzodiazepine agonist in pentobarbital- and diazepam-trained animals, its unique effects in lorazepam-trained animals appear to reflect its in vitro profile as a partial agonist.", 
    "65": "Antagonists of glutamate receptors of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype, as well as of voltage-gated sodium channels, exhibit anticonvulsive and neuroprotective properties in vivo. One can postulate that a compound that combines both principles might be useful for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system, like focal or global ischemia. Here, we present data on the effects of dimethyl-(2-[2-(3-phenyl-[1,2, 4]oxadiazol-5-yl)-phenoxy]ethyl)-amine hydrochloride (BIIR 561 CL) on neuronal AMPA receptors and voltage-dependent sodium channels. BIIR 561 CL inhibited AMPA receptor-mediated membrane currents in cultured cortical neurons with an IC50 value of 8.5 microM. The inhibition was noncompetitive. In a cortical wedge preparation, BIIR 561 CL reduced AMPA-induced depolarizations with an IC50 value of 10.8 microM. In addition to the effects on the glutamatergic system, BIIR 561 CL inhibited binding of radiolabeled batrachotoxin to rat brain synaptosomal membranes with a Ki value of 1.2 microM. The compound reduced sodium currents in voltage-clamped cortical neurons with an IC50 value of 5.2 microM and inhibited the veratridine-induced release of glutamate from rat brain slices with an IC50 value of 2.3 microM. Thus, BIIR 561 CL inhibited AMPA receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels in a variety of preparations. BIIR 561 CL suppressed tonic seizures in a maximum electroshock model in mice with an ED50 value of 2.8 mg/kg after s.c. administration. In a model of focal ischemia in mice, i.p. administration of 6 or 60 mg/kg BIIR 561 CL reduced the area of the infarcted cortical surface. These data show that BIIR 561 CL is a combined antagonist of AMPA receptors and voltage-gated sodium channels with promising anticonvulsive and neuroprotective properties.", 
    "66": "Previous findings in our laboratory suggested that the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist xanomeline exhibits a novel mode of interaction that involves persistent binding to and activation of the M1 mAChR, subsequent to extensive washout, as well as a possible insurmountable element. In the present study, we examined this interaction in greater detail, using Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the genes for the M1 mAChR and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. Pretreatment of cells with xanomeline, followed by extensive washout, resulted in elevated basal levels of neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity that were suppressed by the antagonists atropine or pirenzepine in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of the data yielded estimates of Schild slope factors and pKB values for the antagonists that were consistent with a model of simple competition between these latter agents and the persistently bound form of xanomeline. The ability of the antagonists to produce parallel dextral shifts of the concentration-response curves to carbachol and xanomeline was also investigated. The interaction between xanomeline and pirenzepine appeared to be insurmountable, but this may have been due to an equilibrium artifact. In contrast, the interaction between xanomeline and atropine conformed to a model of competition, indicating that the mode of interaction of free xanomeline at the M1 mAChR is pharmacologically identical with that of the persistently bound form. Radioligand binding studies also showed that the presence of various concentrations of xanomeline had no significant effect on the calculated affinity of atropine or pirenzepine in inhibiting the binding of [3H]N-methylscopolamine. Overall, these findings suggest that the persistent attachment of xanomeline to the M1 mAChR does not prevent this agonist from interacting with the classic binding site in a competitive fashion.", 
    "67": "The thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptor was expressed in embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking the alpha subunits of Gq and G11 (Fq/11 cells) to determine whether G protein coupling is necessary for agonist-dependent receptor internalization. Neither TRH nor agonists acting on endogenous receptors increased intracellular calcium unless the cells were co-transfected with the alpha subunit of Gq. In contrast, temperature-dependent internalization of [3H]MeTRH in Fq/11 cells was the same whether Gqalpha was expressed or not. A rhodamine-labeled TRH analog and fluorescein-labeled transferrin co-localized in endocytic vesicles in Fq/11 cells, indicating that endocytosis took place via the normal clathrin pathway. Cotransfection with beta-arrestin or V53D beta-arrestin increased TRH-dependent receptor sequestration. Fq/11 cells were co-transfected with the TRH receptor and a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-beta-arrestin conjugate. GFP-beta-arrestin was uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm of untreated cells and quickly translocated to the periphery of the cells when TRH was added. A truncated TRH receptor that lacks potential phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus signaled but did not internalize or cause membrane localization of GFP-beta-arrestin. These results prove that calcium signaling by the TRH receptor requires coupling to a G protein in the Gq family, but TRH-dependent binding of beta-arrestin and sequestration do not.", 
    "68": "Four candidate retinoid antagonists (LE135, LE511, LE540, and LE550) were designed on the basis of the ligand superfamily concept and synthesized. Analysis of these related retinoids by transient transfection assay demonstrated that LE135, LE540, and LE550 are effective retinoic acid receptor (RAR) antagonists, whereas LE511 selectively induced RARbeta transcriptional activity. Both LE135 and LE540 inhibited retinoic acid (RA)-induced transcriptional activation of RARbeta, but not RARalpha, RARgamma or retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRalpha), on a variety of RA response elements. The retinoid antagonists also inhibited all-trans-RA-induced transcriptional activation of RARbeta/RXRalpha heterodimers, although they did not show any effect on transactivation activity of RXR/RXR homodimers. In ZR-75-1 human breast cancer cells, cotreatment of LE135 and LE540 with all-trans-RA inhibited all-trans-RA-induced apoptosis of the cells, further demonstrating that RARbeta plays a role in RA-induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells. We also evaluated the effect of these retinoids on AP-1 activity. Our data showed that LE135 and LE540 strongly repressed 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced AP-1 activity in the presence of RARbeta and RXRalpha. Interestingly, LE550 induced AP-1 activity when RARbeta and RXRalpha were expressed in HeLa cells but not in breast cancer cells. These results demonstrate that LE135 and LE540 were a novel class of RARbeta-selective antagonists and anti-AP-1 retinoids and should be useful tools for studying the role of retinoids and their receptors.", 
    "69": "Growing appreciation of the prevalence of and morbid sequelae associated with social anxiety disorder has focused increasing interest on the development of effective treatment strategies. A number of pharmacologic interventions, including the monoamine oxidase inhibitors, reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A, beta-blockers, benzodiazepines, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder. The choice of initial treatment depends on a variety of factors including comorbidity, prior treatment history, patient preference, and adverse effect profile. This article will examine the effectiveness of various pharmacologic agents for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, discuss considerations for long-term management, and review strategies for optimizing treatment in patients who are partially responsive or unresponsive to initial therapy.",

Treatment programs emphasizing these interventions are associated with both acute improvements and longer term maintenance of treatment gains. In this article, the nature and application of these interventions are reviewed in relation to a cognitive-behavioral model of the development and maintenance of social anxiety disorder. Strategies for change and outcome findings are discussed, with attention to both individual studies and meta-analytic reviews of the literature. Strategies for improving outcomes and future directions for research are also discussed.", 
    "71": "Social anxiety disorder is associated with significant impairment in social and occupational functioning. Gender differences in social anxiety disorder are apparent for treatment seeking and symptom clusters, and hormonal influences may affect the natural course of illness. The lifetime prevalence rate is 13.3%, with rates of 15.5% in women and 11.1% in men. Although most studies indicate that more women suffer from social anxiety disorder, it appears that men are more likely to seek treatment. Gender differences in the presentation and management of social anxiety disorder may be influenced by fluctuations in levels of endogenous or exogenous reproductive hormones. Neurotransmitter systems implicated in the etiology of mood and anxiety disorders may be affected by both estrogen and progesterone. There are also issues with regard to pregnancy in women who have social anxiety disorder. It is not known if untreated social anxiety disorder represents a significant risk to the fetus. However, social anxiety disorder often is complicated by comorbid depression, panic disorder, or substance abuse, all of which may pose risks to the fetus if left untreated. Treatment strategies for patients with social anxiety disorder should consider gender differences in response to pharmacotherapy, psychiatric comorbidity, oral contraceptive use, pregnancy status, and the specific nature of symptoms in the individual patient.", 
    "72": "Psychotic symptoms have become increasingly common in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes. This increased prevalence of psychoses is in part a reflection of the greater longevity of people with Parkinson's disease and, to a certain extent, is a consequence of our success in treating the motor symptoms of these syndromes. The psychotic symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease can be as varied as the motor symptoms. They stem from interactions between the underlying neuropathologies of the syndromes and the adverse effects associated with chronic antiparkinsonian drug administration. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, there is also a high prevalence of affective comorbidity. This increase in affective symptoms and the relatively high incidence of cognitive and affective side effects of the antiparkinsonian medications contribute to the increase in psychoses observed in these older patients. The most significant risk factors for developing psychosis in Parkinson's disease are (1) coexistence of dementia, (2) protracted sleep disturbances, and (3) nighttime use of long-acting dopaminomimetics. This article reviews the phenomenology, pathophysiology, and treatment of psychosis associated with parkinsonism and discusses how atypical antipsychotic medications have revolutionized the management of the symptoms and improved the quality of life of those affected.", 
    "73": "The recent introduction of the atypical antipsychotics into the treatment arena for psychoses and related disorders comes with justifiable excitement. These newer antipsychotics offer several clinical benefits over the conventional antipsychotics, which have been the mainstays of care thus far. The primary advantage of these atypical agents is their superior side effect profiles, particularly with regard to extrapyramidal side effects (EPS). The implications from a reduction in EPS touch on virtually every aspect of pathology in schizophrenic illness, including short- and long-term movement disorders, negative symptoms, noncompliance, cognitive dysfunction, and dysphoria. It should be emphasized that while atypical antipsychotics share many clinical attributes, there are also substantial differences among them. This review will examine the pharmacology, clinical efficacy, and side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics and attempt to relate the attributes observed in clinical practice and clinical trials to their basic pharmacologic profiles. There is a fair, but not perfect, correspondence between the pharmacologic profiles of the different atypical antipsychotics and their respective clinical attributes. After a comparative overview of their receptor-binding profiles, a brief pharmacokinetic summary will be provided. Finally, the clinical profiles of these agents will be summarized with regard to both their efficacy and adverse effects.", 
    "74": "A rapid and simple reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method for the determination of clobazam concentrations in human blood samples is developed and validated. Solid-phase column extraction is performed to clean up blood samples before running the analytical HPLC system. The chromatography is isocratic with a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile (20%, v/v), methanol (23%, v/v), and 0.1 M potassium hydrogen phosphate buffer (pH 3.6; 57%, v/v) at a constant flow rate of 2 mL/min. Clobazam is detected at 226 nm. Chromatography is completed within less than 25 min. The recovery rate is greater than 95% and linear over a wide range of drug concentrations. The intra-assay coefficient of variation percentage varies between 4.3 and 12. This method is used for therapeutic drug monitoring in patients undergoing antiepileptic therapy with clobazam. Plasma levels of clobazam ranged from 21 to 663 ng/mL. Other antiepileptic compounds, such as clonazepam and phenobarbital, did not interfere with the detection of clobazam.", 
    "75": "Self-reported past year use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, cocaine, and two controlled prescription substances (opiates, benzodiazepines); and self-reported lifetime substance abuse or dependence was estimated and compared for 12 specialties among 5,426 physicians participating in an anonymous mailed survey. Logistic regression models controlled for demographic and other characteristics that might explain observed specialty differences. Emergency medicine physicians used more illicit drugs. Psychiatrists used more benzodiazepines. Comparatively, pediatricians had overall low rates of use, as did surgeons, except for tobacco smoking. Anesthesiologists had higher use only for major opiates. Self-reported substance abuse and dependence were at highest levels among psychiatrists and emergency physicians, and lowest among surgeons. With evidence from studies such as this one, a specialty can organize prevention programs to address patterns of substance use specific to that specialty, the specialty characteristics of its members, and their unique practice environments that may contribute risk of substance abuse and dependence.",

The occurrence of 3-nitropropionic acid-induced seizures was inhibited by the alpha-amino-2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-oxo-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor antagonists, 6-nitro-7-sulphamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione disodium (NBQX) and 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine HCI (GYKI 52466), with ED50 of 14.1 (7.9-25.2) and 7.2 (5.3-9.6) mg/kg, respectively. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, dizocilpine (MK-801) and 3-(2-carboxypiperazine-4-yl)propenyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPPene), were ineffective. Moreover, 3-nitropropionic acid given in a subthreshold dose potently enhanced seizures generated by intracerebroventricular administration of AMPA and kainate, lowering their CD50 from 0.98 (0.83-1.17) and 0.73 (0.64-0.83) to 0.55 (0.45-0.66) (P<0.001) and 0.58 (0.51-0.65) (P<0.05) nmol, respectively. In contrast, NMDA action was not changed by 3-nitropropionic acid application. We conclude that AMPA/kainate-mediated events are involved in proconvulsive and convulsive effects of 3-nitropropionic acid.", 
    "77": "Bronchoscopic technique is not standardized. Controversies exist with regard to premedication with sedatives before the test. To evaluate safety and efficacy of conscious sedation, we studied 100 randomized patients undergoing diagnostic bronchoscopy; patients received premedication with lidocaine spray and atropine sulfate i.m. (nonsedation group; 50 patients) or lidocaine spray, atropine i.m. and diazepam i.v. (sedation group; 50 patients).", 
    "78": "Monitoring during flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy included continuous ECG and pulse oximetry. The procedure could not be completed in six patients. None received premedication with diazepam; among the patients who ended the examination, tolerance to the examination (visual analogue scale, 0 to 100; 0 = excellent; 100 = unbearable) was better in the sedation group. Low anxiety, male sex, but not age were also associated with improved patient tolerance to the test. Oxygen desaturation occurred in 17% of patients, and it was not more frequent after diazepam treatment.",

    "80": "Isoniazid inhibits the metabolism of several drugs, resulting in clinically significant interactions in some patients. Clinical trials and case reports have documented that isoniazid can cause increased phenytoin and carbamazepine serum concentrations and toxicity. In relatively high doses, isoniazid can also cause increased effect of theophylline and warfarin. Isoniazid inhibits metabolism of selected benzodiazepines and vitamin D. Inhibition of monoamine oxidase and histaminase by isoniazid can cause significant drug-food interactions. Food greatly decreases isoniazid bioavailability. Although probably best recognized as an inhibitor of drug metabolism, isoniazid has a biphasic effect of inhibition-induction on one cytochrome P450 isozyme, CYP2E1, which partially explains the interaction with acetaminophen and increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Continued investigations will likely result in discovery of new isoniazid interactions.", 
    "81": "Hiccup is a spasmodic, involuntary contraction of the inspiratory muscles, associated with delayed and abrupt glottic closure causing a peculiar sound (Launois et al., 1993). A number of medical conditions are known to cause persistent and intractable hiccups. Among the drugs reported to induce hiccups, Thompson et al. stated that corticosteroids and benzodiazepines are the drug classes most frequently associated with the development of hiccups (Thompson and Landry, 1997). Antidopaminergic agents such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol are the preferred drugs used for the treatment of chronic hiccups (Launois et al., 1993). We report a case of severe hiccups occurring in association with the administration of perphenazine, which is a dopamine antagonist. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of hiccups occurring as a side effect of antidopaminergic drugs.", 
    "82": "The alpha 2 agonists can produce reliable dose-dependent sedation and analgesia in most species. Nevertheless, they can also produce significant physiological adverse side effects depending on dose, rate, route of administration, and the concurrent use of other CNS depressants. For this reason, it may be best to use a low dose of an alpha 2 agonist as a preanesthetic agent. The alpha 2 agonists are best suited for young, healthy, exercise-tolerant patients. The combining of low doses of alpha 2, opioid, and benzodiazepine agonists results in a synergistic CNS depressant response while minimizing the undesirable side effects of these three classes of drugs. Each group of drugs has specific antagonists available for their reversal, thus allowing veterinarians to reverse one or more of the agonists depending on the desired response. This may represent a significant advantage to the use of low-dose alpha 2 agonists in combination with opioids and benzodiazepines.", 
    "83": "Rats were injected with a benzodiazepine (midazolam) and shocked after presentation of an auditory conditioned stimulus (CS). They were then tested for fear reactions (freezing) to the CS in either the original context or a 2nd context after either a short (1-day) or long (21-day) retention interval. Rats tested in the original context froze less after 1 day than rats tested after that interval in the 2nd context or rats tested after 21 days. Moreover, rats tested after the long interval in the original context froze less than rats tested after that interval in the 2nd context. Therefore, midazolam does not impair the acquisition of conditioned fear but regulates when and where that fear is expressed. These effects of midazolam were interpreted as a contextually controlled deficit in the expression of conditioned fear that is similar to that associated with latent inhibition and extinction (M. E. Bouton, 1993).", 
    "84": "On the basis of the phenomenon that hydrophilic acetonitrile is separated from the aqueous phase at -20 degrees C, we employed a novel extraction method, \"subzero-temperature liquid-liquid extraction\", to extract benzodiazepines (estazolam and triazolam) from serum or aqueous solution for liquid chromatography. A 1:1 mixture of acetonitrile and the specimen was cooled at -20 degrees C for 20 min to separate the acetonitrile and aqueous phases. The acetonitrile phase was directly injected into a high-performance liquid chromatograph. Recovery rates of the drugs following the first subzero-temperature liquid-liquid extraction were 50.3 +/- 0.6-54.0 +/- 0.9%, which were lower than those (73.9 +/- 3.3-80.6 +/- 0.6% and 81.6 +/- 4.7-96.1 +/- 2.6%) of the first conventional liquid-liquid extraction using diethyl ether and solid-phase extraction using a Sep-Pak C18 column, respectively. However, three to four repeated subzero-temperature liquid-liquid extractions and conventional liquid-liquid extractions resulted in recovery of almost 100% of the drugs. In the chromatogram of the benzodiazepines recovered from serum by the subzero-temperature extraction, no coextracted component interfered with determination of the drugs. Detection limits of the drugs were 0.02-0.08 microgram/mL, and coefficients of variance were 1.14-2.17% suggesting high reproducibility.", 
    "85": "We used the dopaminergic neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) as a biomarker of chemical-induced neurotoxicity. Receptor autoradiography of [3H]-PK11195, a PBR selective ligand, indicated dose-dependent increases throughout the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system as early as 24 h after MPTP administration (10-80 mg/kg), which persisted for at least 21 days. The binding of [3H]-PK11195 was increased as much as 98% in the corpus striatum and 114% in the substantia nigra, following MPTP exposure. The integrity of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals in the corpus striatum was assessed by measuring high affinity dopamine transporter (DAT) levels and dopamine content. DAT levels were measured by [3H]-WIN 35,428 autoradiography, and dopamine content decreased with increasing MPTP dose. Reductions of both indices of dopaminergic terminal integrity correlated with increased levels of [3H]-PK11195-binding in the striatum (r2 = 0.84 for DAT and 0.93 for dopamine content). Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, with a 67% loss measured 7 days after treatment with 80 mg/kg MPTP. The loss of TH-positive neurons was correlated (r2 = 0.95) with increased levels of [3H]-PK11195 binding in the substantia nigra. These findings demonstrate that the PBR is both sensitive and specific for identifying brain regions involved in MPTP neurotoxicity.", 
    "86": "Status epilepticus, a serious, life-threatening emergency characterized by prolonged seizure activity, occurs most commonly in pediatric patients. Although initial therapies with agents such as diazepam, phenytoin, or phenobarbital generally terminate seizure activity within 30-60 minutes, patients with refractory status epilepticus (RSE) lasting longer require additional intervention. High-dose pentobarbital has been the most commonly prescribed agent for the management of RSE in children; however, midazolam has emerged as a new treatment option. This review compares the use of midazolam with pentobarbital in published reports of pediatric RSE. Both drugs effectively terminated refractory seizure activity, although pentobarbital use was complicated by hypotension, delayed recovery, pneumonia, and other adverse effects. Midazolam use was effective and well tolerated, affirming its value in pediatric RSE management.", 
    "87": "Previous studies have demonstrated that anxiolytic-like anticonflict effects can be produced by either (1) acute administration of traditional anti-anxiety compounds (benzodiazepines or barbiturates) or (2) chronic administration of tricyclic (TCA) or monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) anti-depressants.", 
    "88": "The present study determined the effects of noradrenergic neuronal depletion on these distinct anticonflict treatments.", 
    "89": "After 3 weeks of training in a repeated measures drink suppression conflict paradigm, water-restricted rats consumed 11-14 ml water/session (unpunished responding) and accepted 25-40 shocks/session (punished responding) during control (i.e., non-drug) 10-min test sessions. The noradrenergic neurotoxin DSP4 [N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine hydrochloride; 65 mg/kg, IP] or its vehicle (saline; 1 ml/kg) was administered after 3 weeks of conflict testing. Conflict behavior was then evaluated for 8 weeks post-treatment. In separate groups of DSP4- and vehicle-pretreated subjects, the effects of acute administration (10-min pretreatment) of phenobarbital (5-40 mg/kg) or alprazolam (0.3-2.5 mg/kg) were determined. In a third experiment, the effects of chronic treatment with the TCA desipramine (DMI; 5 mg/kg, twice daily for 8 weeks) or the non-selective MAOI phenelzine (4.0 mg/kg, twice daily for 8 weeks) on conflict behavior were determined in additional groups of DSP4- or vehicle-pretreated subjects.", 
    "90": "DSP4 treatment produced a modest yet statistically significant decrease in punished responding (i.e., anxiogenic-like effect) relative to vehicle controls. DSP4 pretreatment did not alter the anticonflict effects of acute alprazolam or phenobarbital treatment. In contrast, DSP4 treatment completely abolished the anticonflict effects produced by chronic DMI or chronic phenelzine treatment.", 
    "91": "Thus, noradrenergic neuronal integrity appears to be required for the anxiolytic-like effects of chronic antidepressant treatment, but not for the anxiolytic-like effects of acute treatment with barbiturates and benzodiazepines.", 
    "92": "The aim of this study was to determine the functional role of muscarinic receptor subtypes regulating gallbladder cholinergic contractions. Electrical field stimulation (EFS; 16 Hz) produced contractile responses of guinea pig gallbladder muscle strips in vitro that were inhibited by 1 microM tetrodotoxin (2 +/- 2% of control) and 1 microM atropine (1 +/- 1% of control), indicating activation of intrinsic cholinergic nerves. Exogenous ACh (5 microM)-induced contractions were inhibited by atropine (1 +/- 1% of control) but not tetrodotoxin (102 +/- 1% of control), indicating a direct effect on smooth muscle. The M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine (10 nM) had no effect on ACh-induced contractions but inhibited EFS-induced contractions by 11 +/- 3%. The M2 antagonist methoctramine (10 nM) had no effect on ACh-induced contractions but augmented EFS-induced contractions by 5 +/- 2%. The M3 antagonist 4-DAMP (10 nM) inhibited ACh-induced contractions by 14 +/- 4% and EFS-induced contractions by 22 +/- 5%. In conclusion, specific M1, M2, and M3 receptors modulate gallbladder muscle contractions by regulating ACh release from cholinergic nerves and mediating the contraction. Cholinergic contractions are mediated by M3 receptors directly on the smooth muscle. M2 receptors are on cholinergic nerves and function as prejunctional inhibitory autoreceptors. M1 receptors are on cholinergic nerves and function as prejunctional facilitatory autoreceptors.", 
    "93": "The expression of alpha and beta gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor subunits produces GABA-gated channels which require the incorporation of either the gamma2 or gamma3 subunit for benzodiazepine modulation. Here we examine the role of the gamma2 subunit splice variants, gamma2S and gamma2L which differ by eight amino acids in the major intracellular domain, in mediating cell surface expression. Using immunocytochemistry we have demonstrated that when expressed alone, the gamma2S subunit can access the cell surface and internalize constitutively. In contrast, alpha1, beta2 and gamma2L are retained predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when expressed alone. Replacing the insert which differentiates gamma2L from gamma2S (LLRMFSFK) with eight alanines produces a phenotype identical to gamma2S. Both gamma2 subunits fail to produce high molecular weight oligomers observed for alpha1beta2 and alpha1beta2gamma2 heterooligomers and do not form functional ion channels. Surface expression of gamma2S is repressed upon the coexpression of alpha1 or beta2 subunits, resulting in ER-retained heterooligomers, suggesting that homomeric gamma2S is unlikely to occur in vivo. However, its independent maturation to surface competence and preferential assembly with alpha and beta subunits may ensure the production of functional benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors. Furthermore, the presence of the gamma2 subunit appears to confer an endocytotic capacity to these heterooligomeric receptors.", 
    "94": "Intranasal administration of diazepam may be a practical alternative to the conventional acute medication of seizures, such as status epilepticus. Nine healthy students participated in an open crossover study on intranasal versus intravenous administration of diazepam (2 mg). Blood samples were collected, pharmacodynamic tests were performed, and the volunteers filled out questionnaire. Peak concentration was achieved after 18+/-11 min and the bioavailability was 50.4+/-23.3%. A pharmacodynamic effect was observed after about 5 min, but the dose, even for i.v. administration, was too low to generate a strong measurable effect. The results indicate that intranasally administered diazepam may be an effective alternative to i.v. administration in relief of seizures, e.g. in an acute situation when a physician or nurse is not available on location.", 
    "95": "The effect of inescapable footshock stress on open-field activity, as measured by the number of ambulations, was studied in male mice. Ambulations significantly increased after footshock stress, the most significant effect appeared after 20 min-stimulation and the effect decreased as footshock time lengthened. The footshock stress-induced enhancement of ambulation was inhibited by haloperidol (0.2, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg), phentolamine (5 and 10 mg/kg), mianserin (20 mg/kg), atropine (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg), naltrexone (10 mg/kg) and MK-801 (0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg), but was not influenced by propranolol (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) or diazepam (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg). Haloperidol (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) and mianserin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) also exerted an inhibitory effect on non-stressed normal mice. These results suggest that dopaminergic, alpha-adrenergic, cholinergic, opioidergic and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated neurotransmission systems are involved in the footshock stress-induced ambulatory activation.", 
    "96": "The purpose of these investigations was to determine from combined data the response to rectal diazepam (DZP) gel (Diastat [Athena Neurosciences, South San Francisco, CA]) in home treatment of children with episodes of acute repetitive seizures (ARS). A subset of patients aged 2-17 years were selected from two prospective placebo-controlled studies of children and adults. In both studies a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled design was used. The treatment groups (68 DZP; 65 placebo) did not differ significantly in age, race, seizure type or etiology, or in the median number of ARS episodes per month before study entry. DZP-treated children demonstrated a significant reduction in median seizure frequency compared with the placebo group (0.00 vs 0.25 seizures per hour, P = 0.001). Significantly more DZP-treated children remained seizure free during the observation period (40 vs 20, P = 0.001). Somnolence was the only adverse effect present significantly more often in the DZP-treated children (25.0% vs 7.7%, P = 0.0095). There were no instances of serious respiratory depression. Rectal DZP was demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment to abort an episode of ARS in a child and, additionally, lessened the likelihood of seizure recurrence within the next 12 hours.",

    "101": "The DSM-III-R and ICD-10 BZD dependence constructs may need to be redefined. The use of a BZD dependence severity model based on a Rasch-homogeneous scale appears to have greater clinical value than a dichotomous diagnostic model based on an arbitrary cut-off point. We recommend Rasch modelling to investigate the homogeneity of the elements of the SDS across other psychoactive substances.",

    "103": "Forty subjects participated in experiments in which they hypothetically \"purchased\" drugs as price or income varied.", 
    "104": "Experiment 1 examined effects of heroin price on purchases of heroin, valium, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol. Experiment 2 examined the effects of both heroin and valium prices on purchases of these drugs. In both these experiments, income remained constant. Experiment 3 examined the effects of increasing income on drug choices, with drug prices constant.", 
    "105": "As price of heroin rose in Experiment 1, heroin purchases decreased. Reductions in heroin purchases were proportionally less than price increases, demonstrating inelastic demand for heroin. Valium and cocaine purchases increased as heroin price rose, and cross-price elasticity coefficients indicated that these drugs substituted for heroin. In Experiment 2, demand for both heroin and valium was inelastic. Valium substituted for heroin, but heroin purchases were independent of valium prices, suggesting an asymmetrical substitution effect. Marijuana and alcohol purchases were independent of valium price, but both these drugs substituted for heroin. In Experiment 3 demand for heroin and cocaine was income elastic, with purchases rising in greater proportion than income. Marijuana, alcohol and valium purchases did not vary with income, demonstrating that demand for these drugs was income inelastic. Hypothetical choices were reliable both between and within subjects. Moreover, drug choices in this hypothetical situation were correlated with urinalysis results, demonstrating initial validity of this methodology.",

After a 2- to 4-day screening period, qualified patients were assigned to either olanzapine (N = 70) or placebo (N = 69). Patients began double-blind therapy with either olanzapine, 10 mg, or placebo given once per day. After the first day of treatment, the daily dose could be adjusted upward or downward, as clinically indicated, by one capsule (olanzapine, 5 mg/day) within the allowed range of one to four capsules. The primary efficacy measure in the protocol was defined as a change from baseline to endpoint in total score on the Young Mania Rating Scale. Clinical response was defined a priori as a decrease of 50% or more from baseline in Young Mania Rating Scale total score.",

On the basis of the clinical response criteria, significantly more olanzapine-treated patients (48.6%) responded than those assigned to placebo (24.2%). Somnolence, dizziness, dry mouth, and weight gain occurred significantly more often with olanzapine. There were no statistically significant differences between the olanzapine-treated and placebo-treated patients with respect to measures of parkinsonism, akathisia, and dyskinesias.

A comparison is made between the CE determination of the compounds by conventional UV detection and LC determination with electrospray ionisation (ESI) ion-trap mass spectrometry. CE is shown to provide superior separation to HPLC but the MS-MS capability of the ion-trap allows for the specific detection and determination of four of the compounds, diazepam, N'-desmethyldiazepam, oxazepam and temazepam in the hair of a patient under clinical treatment with diazepam and temazepam.

    "112": "Deficits in gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) neurotransmitter systems have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia for more than two decades. Previous postmortem and in vivo studies of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor density have reported alterations in several brain regions of schizophrenic patients. The goal of this study was to better characterize possible alterations of the in vivo regional distribution volume (VT) of BDZ receptors in schizoprenia, using the selective BDZ antagonist [123I]iomazenil and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT). Regional BDZ VT was measured under sustained radiotracer equilibrium conditions. The reproducibility and reliability of this measurement was established in four healthy volunteers. No differences in regional BDZ VT were observed between 16 male schizophrenic patients and 16 matched controls. No relationships were observed between BDZ VT and severity of psychotic symptoms in any of the regions examined. In conclusion, this study failed to identify alterations of BDZ receptors density in schizoprenia. If this illness is associated with deficits in GABA transmission, these deficits do not substantially involve BDZ receptor expression or regulation.", 
    "113": "This paper describes the use of cholesteryl-10-undecenoate as a capillary column modifier for capillary electrochromatography. This bonded phase has shown an entirely different selectivity as compared to octadecyl silica (ODS) phases in reversed-phase liquid chromatography, specifically in the analysis of the benzodiazepines. This difference serves as the basis for the continuing study as well as the present focus on electrochromatography as a relatively new separation technique. To significantly increase the surface area, etching of the inner wall of a 75-micron capillary is performed using ammonium hydrogen difluoride and is then subsequently modified via a silation reaction with triethoxysilane and subjected to hydrosilation with cholesteryl-10-undecenoate to form the bonded phase. The performance of this capillary is compared with unetched cholesterol-modified and bare, fused-silica capillaries. Efficient resolution was noted for the etched capillary showing the effectiveness of the etching process as well as the selective property of the bonded phase.",

    "119": "Emergency toxicology or drug screening in clinical settings requires rapid qualitative and quantitative analysis with acceptable levels of sensitivity and specificity. The aim of this study was to comparatively evaluate the performance of the multi-column HPLC-based REMEDi drug profiling system (Bio-Rad), the aca analyzer (Du Pont), and the bench standard conventional HPLC method in the identification of 12 clinically important benzodiazepines. In this study, the presence of benzodiazepines in 133 patients' serum samples were qualitatively and comparatively analyzed by these three procedures. Among these methods, 120 of 133 samples were identified as benzodiazepine-positive by conventional HPLC (90%); 127 by aca analyzer (95%); and 84 by REMEDi (63%). Detection sensitivity of REMEDi for most of the benzodiazepines was found satisfactory when concentrations were greater than 1.0 microg/mL. When benzodiazepine concentrations were in the ranges of 0.3-1.0 microg/mL, detection sensitivity became varied among the benzodiazepine family of drugs by REMEDi method. REMEDi procedure should not be considered as the method of choice for detection of benzodiazepines if expected concentration levels are below 0.3 microg/mL, with the exception of bromazepam. Conventional HPLC displayed the highest sensitivity and specificity for the detection of benzodiazepines. In our studies, 36 REMEDi-negative samples were positive by HPLC, although in 16 of the 36 REMEDi negative samples (13.3%), the presence of benzodiazepines was detected but only listed as candidates without positive identification of the individual compounds by REMEDi. In our series, however, there were no false positives by the REMEDi method whereas aca procedure showed 13 false positive results (9%) and 6 cases of false negative (4%). Our data indicate that the REMEDi procedure can be used on serum samples for rapid qualitative screening of clinically important high levels of benzodiazepines with high specificity. However, due to the relatively low sensitivity of REMEDi in samples with low benzodiazepine levels and relatively low specificity by aca, all samples should be further confirmed by conventional HPLC procedure.", 
    "120": "In addition to the well-known genomic effects of steroid molecules via intracellular steroid receptors, certain steroids rapidly alter neuronal excitability through interaction with neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Several of these steroids accumulate in the brain after local synthesis or after metabolism of adrenal steroids. The 3alpha-hydroxy ring A-reduced pregnane steroids allopregnanolone and tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone have been thought not to interact with intracellular receptors, but enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated chloride currents, whereas pregnenolone sulfate and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) sulfate display functional antagonistic properties at GABA(A) receptors. We demonstrated that these neuroactive steroids can regulate also gene expression via the progesterone receptor after intracellular oxidation. Thus, in physiological concentrations these neuroactive steroids regulate neuronal function through their concurrent influence on transmitter-gated ion channels and gene expression. When administered in animal studies, memory-enhancing effects have been shown for pregnenolone sulfate and DHEA. The 3alpha-hydroxy ring A-reduced neuroactive steroids predominantly display anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, and hypnotic activities. Sleep studies evaluating the effects of progesterone as a precursor molecule for these neuroactive steroids revealed a sleep electroencephalogram pattern similar to that obtained by the administration of benzodiazepines. These findings extend the concept of a \"cross-talk\" between membrane and nuclear hormone effects and provide a new role for the therapeutic application of these steroids in neurology and psychiatry.", 
    "121": "Refreshing sleep requires both sufficient total sleep time as well as sleep that is in synchrony with the individual's circadian rhythm. Problems with sleep organization in elderly patients typically include difficulty falling asleep, less time spent in the deeper stages of sleep, early-morning awakening and less total sleep time. Poor sleep habits such as irregular sleep-wake times and daytime napping may contribute to insomnia. Caffeine, alcohol and some medications can also interfere with sleep. Primary sleep disorders are more common in the elderly than in younger persons. Restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder can disrupt sleep and may respond to low doses of antiparkinsonian agents as well as other drugs. Sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness. Evaluation of sleep problems in the elderly includes careful screening for poor sleep habits and other factors that may be contributing to the sleep problem. Formal sleep studies may be needed when a primary sleep disorder is suspected or marked daytime dysfunction is noted. Therapy with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist may be indicated after careful evaluation.", 
    "122": "The effect of benzodiazepines on the nociceptive threshold was studied in rats using the tail-flick and the formalin tests. Systemic injection of midazolam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced a significant decrease of the tail-flick latency and produced a long-lasting nociceptive effect in the formalin test, thus characterising a hyperalgesic state. The hyperalgesia induced by midazolam in the tail-flick test was blocked by flumazenil, a specific antagonist for benzodiazepine sites associated with GABA(A) receptors. Picrotoxin, a Cl- channel blocker, inhibited midazolam-induced hyperalgesia in both tests. Midazolam caused hyperalgesia when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.; 25 microg) but not intrathecally (i.t.; 75 microg). I.c.v. but not i.t. (5 microg) injection of flumazenil suppressed the hyperalgesia induced by midazolam (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Combination of non-hyperalgesic doses of diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or ethanol (0.48 g/kg, oral) with midazolam (5 mg/kg, i.p.) also induced hyperalgesia. Our results demonstrate that midazolam and diazepam alone or in combination with ethanol can produce hyperalgesia by interacting with GABA(A) receptors at the supraspinal level in rats. The risk of hyperalgesia should be taken in account when these drugs are used in combination in humans.", 
    "123": "The temperature dependence of the binding of beta-carboline derivatives to the central benzodiazepine receptors was determined using [3H]-Ro 15-1788, as a selective radioligand. The compounds chosen display a wide spectrum of efficacies ranging from inverse agonists to agonists through antagonists. Assays were performed at 0, 10, 20, 25, 30, 35 degrees C in the absence and in the presence of 10 microM GABA. The temperature dependence of the affinity constants K(A)=1/K(D) or 1/Ki is shown in the van't Hoff plots (In K(A) versus 1/T) for each compound. Thermodynamic parameters deltaG degrees, deltaH degrees and deltaS degrees were determined by regression analysis of the plots which were linear in the range of temperatures investigated. Moreover, their slopes were systematically positive indicating that the binding of the compounds analyzed to benzodiazepine receptors is essentially enthalpy-driven both in the presence and in the absence of GABA. We verified that the ratio of affinity constant values in the presence and absence of GABA 10 microM (GABA ratio) (<1 for inverse agonists, =1 for antagonists, >1 for agonists), strongly correlates with the corresponding differences of deltaH degrees and deltaS degrees values obtained for each compound in the absence and in the presence of GABA. These results suggest that binding thermodynamic analysis of BDZ receptor ligands, in the presence and in the absence of GABA, permits to discriminate inverse agonists from antagonists, and agonists.", 
    "124": "Receptor binding and behavioral profiles of N-(4-chloro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-isopropoxybenzyl)acetamide (DAA1097) and N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (DAA1106), novel, selective agonists for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) were examined. DAA1097 and DAA1106 inhibited [3H]PK 11195 binding to crude mitochondrial preparations of rat whole brain, with IC50 values of 0.92 and 0.28 nM. Likewise, DAA1097 and DAA1106 inhibited [3H]Ro 5-4864 binding to the same mitochondrial preparation, with IC50 values of 0.64 and 0.21 nM. In contrast, DAA1097 and DAA1106 did not inhibit [3H]-flunitrazepam, the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) ligand, binding to membranes of rat whole brain (IC50>10,000nM). Oral administration of DAA1097 and DAA1106 had anxiolytic effects in the mouse light/dark exploration test and in the rat elevated plus- maze test. Oral administration of DAA1106, diazepam and buspirone but not DAA1097 significantly increased sleeping time in hexobarbital-induced anesthesia in mice. The order of potency of potentiation of hexobarbital anesthesia was diazepam> buspirone> DAA1106> DAA1097. Oral administration of DAA1097 and DAA1106 but not diazepam and buspirone did not affect spontaneous locomotor activity in mice. These findings indicate that DAA1097 and DAA1106 are PBR selective ligands with potent anxiolytic-like properties, in laboratory animals.",

    "126": "The Netherlands Health Council has issued a report on the appropriate use of benzodiazepines, detailing current knowledge on mode of action, indications for use, adverse effects and the prescribed volume in the Netherlands. About 3% of the adult population are chronic users of benzodiazepines. Chronic use is complicated by the risk of falling; the relative risk of hip fractures in chronic benzodiazepine users in about 1.7. Chronic use should be discouraged. However, most chronic users are fragile elderly people for whom a good night's sleep implies temporary escape from a sorry existence with somatic or psychic symptoms. Such circumstances should be kept in mind when treating individual patients.", 
    "127": "DNA minor-groove binding drugs have been extensively studied in the last years in order to influence the regulation of gene expression in neoplastic disorders by means of specific interactions with DNA bases. Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs), CC-1065 and distamycins are three classes of minor-groove alkylating agents which showed interesting cytotoxicity profiles, but they cannot be used in humans for various toxicity problems. For this reason many groups applied heterocyclic substitutions extensively, in order to either modify the reactivity profile or introduce extra interactions within the minor groove, thus changing the binding site or modulating the binding sequence.", 
    "128": "The involvement of the endogenous benzodiazepine, octadecaneuropeptide (ODN), in the regulation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression at the pituitary level, and the influence of adrenal and gonadal steroids, have been studied using a quantitative in situ hybridization technique. I.c.v. injection of ODN (4 micrograms/kg) in sham-operated rats induced a 17 and 7% decrease in the POMC mRNA expression in anterior and intermediate pituitary lobes respectively. To determine the reciprocal involvement of adrenal and gonadal steroids in this regulation, animals were adrenalectomized and/or castrated. Adrenalectomy significantly increased POMC mRNA expression by 48% at the anterior pituitary level, but induced a 10% decrease of hybridization signal at the intermediate pituitary lobe (vs control sham-operated). Adrenal ablation reversed the effect induced by ODN and increased POMC mRNA expression at the anterior and intermediate pituitary levels by 60 and 10% respectively, compared with control sham-operated. By contrast, castration, which produced a decrease in POMC mRNA in the anterior pituitary and an increase in the intermediate lobe, did not modify the negative influence of ODN observed in sham-operated animals. When rats were adrenalectomized and castrated, the adrenalectomy influence was predominant at the anterior pituitary level, since ODN increased significantly the hybridization signal (+68% vs control sham-operated), while the castration influence was predominant at the intermediate pituitary level, since ODN induced an 11% decrease in POMC mRNA signal compared with control sham-operated. These studies indicate that, in vivo, the decrease in POMC mRNA expression in the anterior and intermediate pituitary induced by an endogenous benzodiazepine is differently modulated by adrenal and gonadal steroids, with a predominant influence of adrenal steroids at the anterior pituitary level and gonadal steroids at the intermediate pituitary level.", 
    "129": "The complete absence of handling of male rats during neonatal development (from birth to postnatal day 21) correlates with an impairment of latent inhibition [J. Feldon, I. Weiner, From an animal model of an attentional deficit towards new insights into the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, J. Psychiatr. Res. 26 (1992) 345-366.]. Such nonhandling of rats reportedly also correlates with a decreased expression of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPHd) reactivity in the hippocampus in adult rats (6 months of age) when compared with rats of the same age that were handled during the same neonatal period [R.R. Vaid, B.K. Yee, U. Shalev, J.N. Rawlins, I. Weiner, J. Feldon, S. Totterdell, Neonatal nonhandling and in utero prenatal stress reduce the density of NADPH-diaphorase-reactive neurons in the fascia dentata and Ammon's horn of rats, J. Neurosci. 17 (1997) 5599-5609.]. The present study investigated whether such a decrease in NADPHd activity would be detectable at earlier ages. Therefore, the present study assessed the density of nitric oxide (NO) producing neurons in the fascia dentata and Ammon's horn in 28-, 54-, and 118-day-old nonhandled and handled male rats using NADPHd histochemistry and immunohistochemical localization of neuronal isoform of nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a NADPHd. This showed that in these three age groups, the numbers of NADPHd positive neurons per unit area throughout the hippocampus of rats that received no handling during neonatal development did not differ significantly from those of rats that received regular daily handling. In addition, we found in the rats of 118 days of age that the areal density of nNOS immunopositive neurons in the hippocampus also did not differ significantly between nonhandled and handled rats. Nevertheless, in a parallel study, rats from the same experimental group receiving identical treatments showed the expected impairment of latent inhibition at 4 months of age [R. Weizman, J. Lehmann, S. Leschiner, I. Allmann, T. Stoehr, C. Heidbreder, A. Domeney, J. Feldon, M. Gavish, Long-lasting effect of early handling on the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. in press.]. These results suggest that nonhandling of rats during the early neonatal period, that does result in impairment in latent inhibition, does not affect the numbers of NO producing neurons in the hippocampus in rats of young ages, including the age of observed impairment of latent inhibition.", 
    "130": "Interduplex crosslinks by a bifunctional anthramycin DNA crosslinker produced triradial and quadriradial chromosomes. The crosslinker alkylates guanine at N-2. Bovine chromosomes contain GC-rich density satellite DNAs at the centromeric heterochromatin and is the basis for the formation of triradial and quadriradial chromosomes at the centromeres. The in situ crosslinking of interphase chromosomes indicates that the distance between centromeres is 17.5 A. We conclude that the nuclear matrix associated DNA in the centromeric heterochromatin of interphase chromosomes are positioned close enough for crosslinking to occur. We propose a model for the generation of triradial and quadriradial chromosomes based upon the number of interduplex crosslinks between two chromosomes.", 
    "131": "This study reports on the regulation of kainate neurotoxicity in cerebellar granule cells by calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels and by calcium release from internal cellular stores. Kainate neurotoxicity was prevented by the AMPA selective antagonist LY 303070 (10 microM). Kainate neurotoxicity was potentiated by cadmium, a general voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, and the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker nifedipine. The antagonists of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) release, thapsigargin and ryanodine, were also able to potentiate kainate neurotoxicity. Kainate treatment elevated [Ca2+]i concentration with a rapid initial increase that peaked at 1543 nM and then declined to plateau at approximately 400 nM. Nifedipine lowered the peak response to 764 nM and the plateau response to approximately 90 nM. Thapsigargin also lowered the kainate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i (640 nM peak, 125 nM plateau). The ryanodine receptor agonist caffeine eliminated the kainate-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, and reduced kainate neurotoxicity. Kainate neurotoxicity potentiated by nifedipine was not prevented by RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors, nor by the caspase inhibitors YVAD-CHO and DEVD-CHO. Neither DNA laddering nor the number of apoptotic nuclei were increased following treatment with kainate and nifedipine. Increased nuclear staining with the membrane impermeable dye propidium iodide was observed immediately following kainate treatment, indicating a loss of plasma membrane integrity. Thus, kainate neurotoxicity is prevented by calcium entry through L-type calcium channels.", 
    "132": "This study describes the pharmacological properties of GABAA receptors expressed in P19-N cells using fluorescence imaging of intracellular chloride with 6-methoxy-N-ethylquinolinium iodide (MEQ). We show that application of the GABA agonist, muscimol (10-200 microM), produces time- and concentration-dependent increases in intracellular [Cl-] that are blocked by bicuculline. Diazepam (10 microM) and pentobarbital (1 mM) potentiate muscimol-stimulation. These receptors exhibit novel pharmacological properties. The neurosteroid, 3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-20-one (1-10 microM) exhibited weak potency in enhancement of muscimol-stimulation. Ethanol (50 and 100 mM) exhibited high efficacy on muscimol responses, a 4- to 5-fold potentiation, respectively, of muscimol (10 microM) alone. GABA and muscimol allosterically modulated specific binding of [3H]flunitrazepam to differentiated P19 cells. Modulation of GABAA receptor mediated increases in intracellular [Cl-] demonstrated stability in response magnitude from 7 to 15 days following removal of retinoic acid. In concert, GABAA receptor subunit mRNA and protein expression patterns in these neuron-like cells were stable over the same period. Using RT-PCR we determined that differentiated P19 cells lack gamma1, gamma2L, alpha6 and delta subunit mRNAs while expressing alpha1, alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, beta1, beta2, beta3, gamma2S and gamma3. Furthermore, subunit specific antibody immunocytochemical labeling of cells with a neuronal morphology indicated the presence of alpha1, alpha2, alpha4, and gamma2 subunits (the only subunits tested). Therefore, P19-N cells should prove useful to researchers in need of a model cell culture system in which to study function and regulation of neuronal GABAA receptors.", 
    "133": "Dipyridamole (DIP), a coronary vasodilator, presents coactivator activity for a number of antitumor drugs as well as antioxidant activity in membrane systems. DIP and derivatives interact with membrane systems such as micelles, phospholipid monolayers and vesicles. The antioxidant effect of DIP and several derivatives upon iron-induced lipoperoxidation on mitochondria has been reported and a good correlation between the hydrophobicity and their protective effect was found (M.F. Nepomuceno et al., Free Radic. Biol. Med., 23 (1997) 1046-1054). In the present work an effort is made to better understand the role of DIP as inhibitor of Fe2+-induced lipid peroxidation in mitochondria. At low concentration, no significant effect on either state IV or state III respiration was found, discarding a possible direct interaction of DIP or RA-25 with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. The association constants for DIP and RA-25 in mitochondria were estimated, being 0.7 (mg/ml)-1 for DIP and 0.2 (mg/ml)-1 for RA-25. Oxygen consumption studies in the presence of FeSO4 showed that the antioxidant effect of DIP or RA-25 did not involved the initial step of Fe2+ oxidation. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the antioxidant effect of both DIP and RA-25 is related to their partition in the lipid phase of the mitochondrial membrane and not to a specific interaction with membrane proteins. This protection may be due either to a direct inhibition of the propagation steps or a scavenger effect on the radicular species that would trigger the peroxidative process.", 
    "134": "Auditory evoked potentials are effected by benzodiazepines, as is cortical processing of auditory stimuli. The effect of benzodiazepines on auditory sensitivity has not, however, been studied. We designed the present study to investigate the effect of sedative doses of midazolam on pure tone and speech audiometry and on audiological reaction times in healthy volunteers. Thirty volunteers underwent baseline audiological assessment for pure tones and speech and had their audiological reaction times measured at 10 and 50 dB above their threshold hearing level at a frequency of 1 kHz. Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group A (n = 15) received midazolam (0.04 mg/kg) IV, and Group B (n = 15) received a similar volume of placebo IV. The audiological tests were repeated 5 min later, and performance was compared with baseline data. Scheff\u00e9 post hoc tests were used to assess the significance of changes in each group. There was no pre- to posttest change in audiological performance in either the placebo group (P = 0.194) or the midazolam group (P = 0.957). Speech audiometry performance was likewise unaffected by midazolam (P = 0.154). Reaction time at the 10-dB and 50-dB sensation levels were both significantly prolonged after midazolam administration (P = 0.023 and P = 0.012, respectively). In this study, we demonstrate that sedation with midazolam (0.04 mg/kg) does not alter pure tone or speech audiometric thresholds, but it does significantly delay the reaction time to auditory stimuli. Medical practitioners should advise midazolam-sedated patients of their impaired reaction to auditory warning signals (e.g., traffic and car horns) as part of the day-ward discharge recommendations.", 
    "135": "In this study, we demonstrate that sedation of healthy volunteers with the benzodiazepine midazolam, in the common clinical dosage, does not affect their hearing capability as measured by pure tone and speech audiometry. However, one's ability to react to auditory signals is impaired after midazolam, which may have implications for patients after day-case procedures.",

In 155 cases (2.8%), the injections were done without contrast material owing to either confirmed or suspected allergy. The remaining 5334 injections were performed after epidurography through the same needle. Patients and referring clinicians were instructed to contact us first regarding complications or any problem potentially related to the injection. In addition, the referring clinicians' offices were instructed to contact us regarding any conceivable procedure-related complications.",

Four complications (0.07%) required either transport to an emergency room (n = 2) or hospitalization (n = 2). None of the complications required surgical intervention, and all were self-limited with regard to symptoms and imaging manifestations. Fluoroscopic needle placement and epidurography provided visual confirmation of accurate needle placement, distribution of the injectate, and depiction of epidural space disease.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the reproducibility of the patterns of activation obtained with SPM for baseline measures and for metabolic changes in response to lorazepam on a test-retest design. The results were compared with those we previously published using region-of-interest (ROI) methods.", 
    "145": "Sixteen healthy right-handed men were scanned twice with PET and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG): before placebo and before lorazepam (30 microg/kg). The same double FDG procedure was repeated 6-8 wk later to assess test-retest reproducibility. Image datasets were analyzed by using SPM95 software. Difference images between baseline and lorazepam were compared for the first and second evaluations, both for relative decreases as well as increases in metabolism. Significance level was systematically varied to P < 0.001, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05.",

SPM showed similar, although not identical, differences in response to lorazepam between the two evaluations. Both evaluations showed significant decreases in occipital cortex (9.7% and 10%) and significant relative increases in left temporal pole (6.8% and 10.4%). However, the second evaluation showed a decrease in the left frontal cortex (areas 6 and 8), which was not present in the first evaluation. The results were very similar to those we had obtained with ROI methods, except for the activation in the left temporal pole, which we had not observed with ROI analyses.",

Results with SPM are similar to those with the ROI method, and, because it systematically analyses the whole brain, SPM can uncover patterns not seen with the ROI method.", 
    "148": "Contrary to widely held belief, physical dependency is not systematic in alcohol dependence. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome can appear even without stopping (or sharply decreasing) high or chronic alcohol intake. It occurs through revelation of a physicochemical cerebral response (membrane changes and decrease in modulation systems) to chronic intoxication. Given the differences in severity, the lability of symptoms and the rapid evolution of the syndrome, the repeated use of scales to evaluate intensity is suggested. Management should be based on this index in order to treat minor forms and to avoid a course to severe forms, which should be transferred to the intensive care unit.",

    "150": "This study was performed to test whether GYKI 52466, a nonNMDA receptor antagonist, would improve microregional oxygen supply and consumption balance in the focal cerebral ischemic area. Rats were anesthetized with 1.4% isoflurane. For the GYKI Group (n = 8), 10 min before middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion, a bolus of 5 mg kg-1 of GYKI 52466 i.v. was administered and was followed by an infusion of 5 mg kg-1 h-1. For the Control Group (n = 8), the same volume of the vehicle was administered. One hour after MCA occlusion, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using the 14C-iodoantipyrine autoradiographic technique. Microscopic arterial and venous oxygen saturations were determined using microspectrophotometry. In the cortex contralateral to MCA occlusion, the average rCBF and the average O2 consumption were lower in the GYKI Group than in the Control Group (rCBF: GYKI 65.5 +/- 24.1 ml 100 g-1 min-1, Control 97.7 +/- 33.4 ml 100 g-1 min-1; O2 consumption: GYKI 3.9 +/- 1.2 ml O2 100 g-1 min-1, Control 6.2 +/- 2.5 ml O2 100 g-1 min-1) without a significant difference in the number of veins with SvO2 < 50%. In the ischemic cortex, the number of veins with SvO2 < 50% was significantly smaller in the GYKI Group (21 veins out of 63) than in the Control Group (45 out of 59) without a significant difference in the average rCBF (GYKI 44.9 +/- 17.7, Control 29.7 +/- 10.4) or regional O2 consumption between these two groups (GYKI 3.3 +/- 1.4, Control 2.7 +/- 1.2). Our data demonstrated that GYKI 52466 was effective in improving microscopic O2 balance in the focal ischemic cortical area of the brain and it decreased O2 consumption in the non-ischemic cortex."
