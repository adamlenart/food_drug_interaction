    "0": "The overall effectiveness of traditional antipsychotics has been hindered by their extrapyramidal side effects, which contribute to noncompliance and relapse in patients with schizophrenia. The side effects associated with traditional antipsychotic treatment are generally minimal in patients who take risperidone, a combined 5-HT2/D2 antagonist, but the literature is sparse on adverse events among the newer atypical antipsychotics. Risperidone is associated with relatively few motor side effects compared with the traditional antipsychotics, and weight gain is less likely with risperidone than with either clozapine or olanzapine. While increased prolactin levels have been reported in patients taking risperidone, little correlation has been found between prolactin levels and adverse events. As antipsychotic treatment options expand to include the new agents, it is important for clinicians to anticipate side effects and to query patients about specific adverse events.",

    "8": "We studied the effects of two diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI)-derived peptides, triakontatetraneuropeptide (DBI 17-50, TTN) and eiksoneuropeptide (DBI 51-70, ENP), on cytosolic free Ca2+ concentrations ([Ca2+]i), chemotaxis, superoxide anion (O2-) generation, and phagocytosis in human neutrophils. Both TTN and ENP induced a rapid and transient rise of [Ca2+]i. The effect of TTN depended on the presence of extracellular Ca2+, whereas the effect of ENP also persisted after extracellular Ca2+ chelation. TTN induced neutrophil chemotaxis, stimulated O2- generation, and enhanced phagocytosis. ENP did not affect cell migration and oxidative metabolism but enhanced phagocytosis. Both peptides modulated N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine- and phorbol myristate acetate-induced O2- generation. Because neutrophils express benzodiazepine receptors of the peripheral type (pBRs) and DBI-derived peptides may interact with such receptors, we investigated the possible role of pBRs in TTN- or ENP-induced effects. The synthetic pBR ligand RO 5-4864 increased [Ca2+]i through extracellular Ca2+ influx and this effect was prevented by the pBR antagonist PK-11195. RO 5-4864, however, was ineffective on neutrophil migration and O2- generation and only slightly affected phagocytosis. Moreover, PK-11195 delayed the [Ca2+]i rise induced by TTN but did not significantly affect its extent, and had no effect on the [Ca2+]i rise induced by ENP. We conclude that DBI-derived peptides induce [Ca2+]i changes and modulate neutrophil function mainly through pBR-independent pathways. In view of the wide cell and tissue distribution of DBI in the brain and in peripheral organs, modulation of neutrophil function by DBI-derived peptides may be relevant for both the neuroimmune network and the development and regulation of the inflammatory processes.", 
    "9": "Control of energy metabolism by increases of mitochondrial matrix [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](m)) may represent a fundamental mechanism to meet the ATP demand imposed by heart contractions, but the machinery underlying propagation of [Ca(2+)] signals from ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels (RyR) to the mitochondria remains elusive. Using permeabilized cardiac (H9c2) cells we investigated the cytosolic [Ca(2+)] ([Ca(2+)](c)) and [Ca(2+)](m) signals elicited by activation of RyR. Caffeine, Ca(2+), and ryanodine evoked [Ca(2+)](c) spikes that often appeared as frequency-modulated [Ca(2+)](c) oscillations in these permeabilized cells. Rapid increases in [Ca(2+)](m) and activation of the Ca(2+)-sensitive mitochondrial dehydrogenases were synchronized to the rising phase of the [Ca(2+)](c) spikes. The RyR-mediated elevations of global [Ca(2+)](c) were in the submicromolar range, but the rate of [Ca(2+)](m) increases was as large as it was in the presence of 30 microm global [Ca(2+)](c). Furthermore, RyR-dependent increases of [Ca(2+)](m) were relatively insensitive to buffering of [Ca(2+)](c) by EGTA. Therefore, RyR-driven rises of [Ca(2+)](m) appear to result from large and rapid increases of perimitochondrial [Ca(2+)]. The falling phase of [Ca(2+)](c) spikes was followed by a rapid decay of [Ca(2+)](m). CGP37157 slowed down relaxation of [Ca(2+)](m) spikes, whereas cyclosporin A had no effect, suggesting that activation of the mitochondrial Ca(2+) exchangers accounts for rapid reversal of the [Ca(2+)](m) response with little contribution from the permeability transition pore. Thus, rapid activation of Ca(2+) uptake sites and Ca(2+) exchangers evoked by RyR-mediated local [Ca(2+)](c) signals allow mitochondria to respond rapidly to single [Ca(2+)](c) spikes in cardiac cells.", 
    "10": "The sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of the AP-1 transcription factor complex was measured in cultured rat cerebellar granule cells by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. A low concentration of kainate (KA; 10 microM), but not alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA; 10 microM), enhanced DNA-binding of the AP-1 transcription factor in cultures pretreated with Concanavalin A (Con A), to prevent KA receptor desensitization. In the presence of cyclothiazide (an inhibitor of AMPA receptor desensitization), KA (10 microM) caused only a slight increase of AP-1 DNA-binding, in contrast to the threefold enhancement produced by AMPA (10 or 30 microM) or by a higher concentration of KA (30 microM), suggesting that the effect of KA, in the presence of Con A, is mediated by activation of putative KA receptors. To confirm this, the effects of the AMPA receptor-selective, non-competitive antagonist, 1-(4-aminophenyl)-3-methylcarbamoyl-4-methyl-3,4-dihydro-7, 8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 53655; 50 microM), the mixed AMPA/KA receptor competitive antagonist, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 50 microM), and the AMPA and GluR5 KA receptor competitive antagonist, (-)(3S,4aR,6R, 8aR)-6-[2-(1(2)H-tetrazole-5-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,4,4a,5,6,7,8, 8a-decahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid monohydrate (LY 326325; 100 microM), were examined on AMPA- and KA-induced AP-1 activation, respectively. Our results suggest that stimulation of native KA receptors is responsible for the observed KA-specific activation of the AP-1 transcription factor complex.", 
    "11": "In pentobarbitone-anaesthetized rats, the effects of two AMPA receptor antagonists, the competitive antagonist 2, 3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo-(F)-quinoxaline (NBQX) and the non-competitive 2,3-benzodiazepine GYKI 53655, were compared on excitatory synaptic transmission of trigeminal origin in intracellularly-recorded abducens motoneurons. The effects of both antagonists were also investigated on the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl isoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA)-, kainate-, and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced depression of extracellular antidromic field potentials in the abducens motor nucleus. Microiontophoretic application (< or =100 nA) or intravenous injection of NBQX (< or =5 mg/kg) affected both AMPA- and kainate-induced depressions whereas GYKI 53655 (< or =100 nA; < or =4 mg/kg) blocked only the AMPA-induced depression. Neither NBQX or GYKI 53655 affected NMDA-induced depressions of antidromic field potentials. Using low intravenous (i.v.) doses of the antagonists NBQX or GYKI 53655 (2-2.5 mg/kg), a complete blockade of the composite disynaptic trigeminal excitatory post-synaptic potential (EPSP) was obtained without any changes in membrane potential, input resistance and antidromic action potentials in abducens motoneurons. GYKI 53655 was more potent at low i.v. doses (0.5-1.8 mg/kg) but NBQX had longer-lasting effects. The results show the existence of differences between the blocking action of NBQX and GYKI 53655 on AMPA-mediated receptor EPSP in abducens motoneurons.", 
    "12": "The inhalation of 35% carbon dioxide has consistently been shown to provoke panic attacks in panic disorder patients. We aim to determine if an acute dose of clonazepam (2 mg) attenuates the panic attacks induced by an inhalation of 35% carbon dioxide in panic disorder. Twenty-two panic disorder patients who had been drug-free for 1 week participated in a carbon dioxide challenge test 1 h after a dose of either 2 mg of clonazepam or placebo with a randomized double-blind method. Also in a double-blind design during the tests the patients inhaled either atmospheric compressed air ('placebo control') or the carbon dioxide mixture. All patients participated in both tests which were done with a 20-min interval. Immediately before and after the inhalation, the anxiety levels and the symptoms of panic were always assessed. In the clonazepam group (n=11) two patients (18.2%) had a mild panic attack and in the placebo group (n=11) nine patients (81.8%) had a moderate to severe panic attack in the CO(2) challenge test. No patient had panic attacks during inhalation of atmospheric compressed air although anticipatory anxiety levels tended to be higher than in the CO(2) tests. After the CO(2) test anxiety levels were significantly greater in the CO(2) group (three-way ANOVA with Geisser-Greenhouse adjustments, F(31.92,1.86)=17.15, d.f.=7, P=0.013). Although a small sample was studied, the findings suggest the efficacy of an acute dose of clonazepam in attenuating panic attacks induced by carbon dioxide inhalation.", 
    "13": "Changes of hemodynamics, oxygen delivery and consumption were studied in 20 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis, undergoing mitral valve replacement, anesthesied induction with propofol(Group P) or midazolam(Group M). The results showed that hemodynamic values were decreased after intravenous propofol, and recovery after tracheal intubation. Hemodynamic values also decreased and last to 2 min after tracheal intubation in Group M. The reduction degree of HR in Group P were more, the degree of SVRI,. LVSWI, RVSWI less than those in Group M respectively. Oxygen consumption decreased more than delivery. It is suggested that induction of anesthesia with propofol in patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis is safe, and may be advantageous than midazolam.", 
    "14": "We tested the ability of the central nervous system convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) to inhibit gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated current in receptors expressing a mutation that rendered them resistant to picrotoxin. Consistent with previous reports, receptors expressing beta2(T246F), along with alpha3 and gamma2 subunits, resulted in a greatly diminished sensitivity to picrotoxin. Sensitivity to PTZ was completely abolished in the mutant receptor, confirming the hypothesis that PTZ acts at the picrotoxin site. Quite unexpected, however, was our finding that PTZ elicited marked stimulation (up to 400% of control) in the mutated receptors. This stimulatory effect was not mediated via an interaction with the benzodiazepine site, as preincubation with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil did not block the PTZ-induced stimulation. Our results reveal the existence of a novel stimulatory domain of PTZ in GABA(A) receptors.", 
    "15": "Receptor density and ligand affinity can be assessed using positron emission tomography (PET). Biological parameters (B(max)('), k(1), k(2), k(on)/V(R), k(off)) are estimated using a compartmental model and a multi-injection protocol. Parametric imaging of the ligand-receptor model has been shown to be of special interest to study certain brain disorders. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio in kinetic curves at the pixel level hampers an adequate estimation of model parameters during the optimization procedure. For this reason, mapping requires a spatial filter, resulting in a loss of resolution. Filtering the kinetic curves in the frequency domain using the Fourier transform is not appropriate, because of difficulties in choosing a correct and efficient cutoff frequency. A wavelet-based filter is more appropriate to such tracer kinetics. The purpose of this study is to build up parametric images at the pixel level while conserving the original spatial resolution, using wavelet-based filtering. Data from [(11)C]flumazenil studies, mapping the benzodiazepine receptor density, were used. An invertible discrete wavelet transform was used to calculate the time-frequency signals of the time-concentration PET curves on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Kinetic curves observed from large regions of interest in high and low receptor-density regions were used to calibrate the threshold of wavelet coefficients. The shrunken wavelet coefficients were then transformed back to the original domain in order to obtain the filtered PET signal. Maps of all binding parameters were obtained at the pixel level with acceptable coefficients of variation of less than 30% for the B(max)(') parameter in most of the gray matter. A strong correlation between model parameter estimates using the usual regions of interest and parametric imaging was observed for all model parameters (r = 0.949 for the parameter B(max)(')). We conclude that wavelet-based filters are useful for building binding parameter maps without loss of the original spatial resolution of the PET scanner. The use of the wavelet-based filtering method can be extended far beyond the multi-injection protocol. It is likely to be also effective for other dynamic PET studies.",

Once or twice each week, 1.5% NaCl solution was substituted for water during the drinking session and, 15 min pre-session, rats were given a drug or vehicle dose by gavage (p.o.) to delineate the dose-effect relationships for zolpidem, zaleplon, alprazolam, clonazepam, and chlordiazepoxide. Then, the dose-effect relationship for zolpidem was re-determined. A second study with two groups, using both zolpidem and clonazepam, explored whether following the dose-effect determination of a drug by a second determination affected the second relationship, and whether dose-effect determinations of either agent affected the results of the second agent investigated.",

In the second study, all determinations yielded dose-related increases, with no indication that the set of determinations for the first agent affected those for the second agent.", 
    "29": "The BZ and non-BZ agents explored yielded significant dose-effect relationships using this procedure, confirming their classification among the anxiolytic agents. The initial negative result for zolpidem in the first study may indicate a less reliable anxiolytic action for this agent, although this could not be resolved as attributable to drug history.", 
    "30": "Hemodialysis-associated seizure (HAS) is a common complication of hemodialysis. The efficiency of anticonvulsant drugs in treating or preventing seizures is poorly defined. In this study, children on long-term hemodialysis were examined for HAS and the effect of diazepam prophylaxis on HAS was investigated. Nine patients with a mean age of 14.1 + 2.8 years had HAS and 4 with a mean age of 13.0 +/- 4.4 years had never experienced HAS. The patients with HAS had tonic-clonic seizures. Four patients had focal slow-wave paroxysms, especially in the parieto-occipital regions; 2 had subcortical epileptiform discharges by electroencephalography. No correlation was observed between HAS and patient age, primary disease, prior history of seizures, type of dialysis, duration of hemodialysis, anemia, hyperparathyroidism, and administration of erythropoietin. Hypertension due to hypervolemia may also play a role in the development of HAS. Five patients with HAS first treated with phenobarbital (PB) had recurrence of seizures. As a dialyzable antiepileptic PB may be associated with an increased risk for HAS. In a preliminary study, we gave diazepam as a prophylactic therapy to 4 patients with HAS. During 6 months of follow-up, these patients had no seizures. The number of HAS was significantly different between the groups receiving PB and diazepam (z=-2,58, P=0.009). In conclusion, administration of diazepam per os to patients with HAS may be of value for preventing recurrence of HAS.",

    "33": "When alcoholics decrease or interrupt alcohol intake abruptly, they will in general experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms. Clinically in most cases it develops a vegetative syndrome with gastroenteropathy, cardiovascular diseases, neurological and psychopathological symptom. Usually alcohol withdrawal symptoms abate after four to seven days, longer courses are rare. Application of drugs is required in approximately one third to one half of the patients. A variety of drugs was suggested for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal. In the first hours of alcohol detoxification, the sensitivity of epinephrine receptors is reduced, but rises afterwards substantially. The number of NMDA-receptors increases during chronic intoxication with ethanol. The standard therapy in Europe (except of Great Britain) is an oral mono therapy with clomethiazole in a dose which depends on the severity of the symptoms. Severe withdrawal symptoms may require treatment on an intensive care unit with infusion therapy, e.g. in the context of a delirium tremens, which represents a life-threatening status. In this case, benzodiazepines have been used successfully as an alternative to clomethiazole.", 
    "34": "Despite an initial sedative effect, alcohol disrupts sleep persistently and should not be used as a sleeping aid. Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

Data have shown that the hypnotic efficacy of zolpidem is generally comparable to that of the benzodiazepines flunitrazepam, flurazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam and triazolam as well as nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic agents such as zopiclone and trazodone in the treatment of elderly and adult patients with insomnia. The comparative efficacy of a recently available nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic zaleplon and zolpidem has yet to be established. There was no evidence of tolerance developing to the hypnotic effects of zolpidem in a number of studies of up to 6 months' duration. However, tolerance has been described in a few patients taking the drug at high dosages for periods of up to several years. Zolpidem is well tolerated in patients with insomnia and the most common adverse events are generally nausea, dizziness and drowsiness. Although zolpidem produced some psychomotor and memory impairment over the first few hours after administration, it had few next-day effects (including effects on daytime well-being and morning coordination). In this respect, it was comparable or superior to flunitrazepam and flurazepam and comparable to other benzodiazepines in patients with insomnia. Zolpidem appears to have a low potential for abuse.", 
    "36": "Zolpidem is effective and well tolerated in patients with insomnia, including the elderly. Studies have shown that zolpidem generally has similar efficacy to other hypnotics including benzodiazepines and zopiclone. Zolpidem appears to have minimal next-day effects on cognition and psychomotor performance when administered at bedtime. In addition, there is little evidence of tolerance to the hypnotic effects of zolpidem, or rebound insomnia or withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of the drug when it is given as recommended (10 mg/day for < 1 month) or over longer periods.",

Its modern application as a plant extract for treating depression has undergone scientific investigation over the last decade, and its effectiveness has been shown in studies comparing it with placebo and reference antidepressants. Our own work supports the contention that LI 160, the best-documented St John's wort medication, is effective at a high dosage even in patients with severe depression. Since the new Berlin Aging Study revealed significant treatment deficiencies among elderly depressive patients, St John's wort extracts may be a useful alternative to benzodiazepines to avoid nontreatment of early depression. Because St John's wort preparations have better tolerability than tricyclic antidepressants, elderly people in particular, can benefit from their use.",

The 50% inhibitory concentration was 0.11 micromol/L (0.08 microg/mL); this is below the usual therapeutic plasma concentration range (generally exceeding 2 microg/mL). In the clinical study, ritonavir reduced alprazolam clearance to 41% of control values (P < .001), prolonged elimination half-life (mean values, 30 versus 13 hours; P < .005), and magnified benzodiazepine agonist effects such as sedation and performance impairment.", 
    "54": "Consistent with in vitro results, administration of low doses of ritonavir for a short duration of time resulted in large impairment of alprazolam clearance and enhancement of clinical effects. Removal from product labeling of a warning against coadministration of ritonavir and alprazolam was based on a previous study only of extended exposure to ritonavir, in which CYP3A induction offset inhibition. Kinetic interactions involving antiretroviral therapies may be complex and time dependent. Product labeling should reflect this complexity.",

In midazolam pre-treated rats the maximum EEG effect was reduced by 51 +/- 23 microV from the original value of 109 +/-15 microV in vehicle treated group. Analysis of this change on basis of the operational model of agonism showed that it can be explained by a change in the parameter tissue maximum (Em) rather than efficacy (tau). In the in vitro studies no changes in density, affinity or functionality of the benzodiazepine receptor were observed.",

Melatonin (MLT) is a main synchronizer of the sleep/wake cycle, playing a role of transduction to brain functioning of informations about periodical environmental changes, i.e. the duration of daylength. 2. In several sleep phase disorders, MLT exerts a therapeutic effect, by normalizing the sleep/wake cycle. 3. Eleven patients, 8 males and 3 females, aged 22-43, meeting DSM IV diagnostic criteria for Bipolar Disorder, Manic Type, were selected for the presence of insomnia not responding to usual hypnotic therapies (benzodiazepine). 4. All the patients were on antimanic treatment. MLT 3 mg per os was administrated at 22.30 h for 1 month, without changing the previous antimanic and hypnotic treatments. All patients showed a significantly longer duration of sleep following MLT add-on. The severity of mania showed a parallel significant decrease. 5. The results of this pilot clinical study suggest that MLT add-on can be useful in antimanic therapy to treat resistant circadian sleep alterations as well as consequently exert a global therapeutic action on the manic state.",

A single 50 mg oral dose was given according to a randomised two-way crossover design in the fasted state. Blood samples for determination of tetrazepam plasma concentrations were collected at pre-defined time points up to 96 h following drug administration. A washout period of 14 days separated both treatment periods. Tetrazepam plasma concentrations were determined by means of a validated LC-MS/MS method. Values of 3873.08 ngh/ml (test preparation) and 3930.69 ngh/ml (reference preparation) for the parameter AUC0-infinity demonstrate an nearly identical extent of drug absorption. Maximum concentrations (Cmax) of 482.08 ng/ml and 465.14 ng/ml were achieved for test and reference preparation. Time to reach maximum plasma concentration (tmax) was 1.39 hours for both preparations. Cmax and AUC0-infinity-values were tested parametrically by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Bioequivalence was concluded if the 90% confidence intervals of the T/R-ratios were in the range of 80%-125% for AUC0-infinity and 70%-143% for Cmax.

To determine whether these changes are translated at the protein level, we performed quantitative autoradiography with the alpha(1) selective ligand, [3H]zolpidem, and the non-selective benzodiazepine site ligand, [3H]Ro 15-1788. Binding of both [3H]zolpidem and [3H]Ro 15-1788 was significantly increased in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (13. 5+/-4.1 and 26.3+/-2.9%, respectively) and significantly reduced in the globus pallidus (20.9+/-0.8 and 18.3+/-1.3%, respectively). These changes in alpha(1) subunit protein expression may help to compensate for the pathological changes in GABAergic activity that occur after striatal dopamine depletion.",

Murine cortical neurons were exposed to treatments for 24 h and assessed by a cell viability assay and phase-contrast microscopy. LY339434 (1-1000 microM) caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability (EC(50)=11.4+/-1.2 microM) that was only attenuated by (5R, 10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5, 10-imine (MK-801, 10 microM), but not by 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX; 50 microM) or 1-(4-aminophenyl)-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine (GYKI 52466, 20 microM). Labeling with nucleic acid binding dyes revealed that LY339434 induced few apoptotic-like characteristics. These findings indicate that in cultured murine cortical neurons, LY339434 acts predominantly through N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors rather than GluR5 to effect neuronal death that is rapid and involves predominantly necrosis rather than morphological apoptosis.", 
    "73": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) carries both high (K(D) = 10-30 nm) and low (K(D) = 0.1-1.0 microm) affinity binding sites for agonists. We have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify a specific residue in the rat beta2 subunit that is involved in high affinity agonist binding. Tyrosine residues at positions 62 and 74 were mutated to either phenylalanine or serine and the effects on ligand binding and ion channel activation were investigated after the expression of mutant subunits with wild-type alpha1 and gamma2 subunits in tsA201 cells or in Xenopus oocytes. None of the mutations affected [(3)H]Ro15-4513 binding or impaired allosteric interactions between the low affinity GABA and benzodiazepine sites. Although mutations at position 74 had little effect on [(3)H]muscimol binding, the Y62F mutation decreased the affinity of the high affinity [(3)H]muscimol binding sites by approximately 6-fold, and the Y62S mutation led to a loss of detectable high affinity binding sites. After expression in oocytes, the EC(50) values for both muscimol and GABA-induced activation of Y62F and Y62S receptors were increased by 2- and 6-fold compared with the wild-type. We conclude that Tyr-62 of the beta subunit is an important determinant for high affinity agonist binding to the GABA(A) receptor.", 
    "74": "Medication-induced alopecia is an occasional side effect of many psychopharmaceuticals. Most of the mood stabilizer and antidepressant drugs can lead to this condition. Some antipsychotic and antianxiety agents induce alopecia. Hair loss is also related to hypothyroidism, which can be induced by lithium and other agents. Alopecia might not be reported by some people, but physicians should be aware of this potential problem which may contribute to noncompliance. Lithium causes hair loss in 12-19% of long-term users. Valproic acid and/ or divalproex precipitates alopecia in up to 12% of patients in a dose-dependent relationship. Incidences up to 28% are observed with high valproate concentration exposures. These pharmaceuticals also can change hair color and structure. The occurrence of carbamazepine-induced alopecia is at or below 6%. Hair loss is less common with other mood stabilizers. Tricyclic antidepressants, maprotilene, trazodone, and virtually all the new generation of antidepressants may on rare occasions lead to alopecia. The same applies to haloperidol, olanzepine, risperidone, clonazepam, and buspirone, but not to other neuroleptics, benzodiazepines, or barbiturates, selected antihistamines, and antiparkinsonians. Discontinuation of the medication or dose reduction almost always leads to complete hair regrowth. The therapeutic value of mineral supplements remains unclear.", 
    "75": "Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and with a safe side-effect profile. Premarketing trials, however, included only a few elderly patients. Further data are needed regarding the effects of olanzapine in the elderly and those with comorbid medical illness. In this pilot study, 11 hospitalized patients (age range 60-85 years) who manifested symptoms of psychosis related to schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders were treated with olanzapine (dose range, 5-20 mg/day). Efficacy and safety were assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Calgary Depression Scale For Schizophrenia (CDSS), EKG, physical examination, and various laboratory tests. Seven patients responded to treatment and all of them showed improvement in both positive and negative symptoms, with greater reduction in positive symptoms. Treatment was discontinued in 2 patients whose symptoms showed no improvement or worsened. The CGI showed significant improvement in 9 patients, remained the same in 1, and worsened in 1 patient. ESRS showed significant reduction from baseline to final visit. Of the 10 patients who cooperated for MMSE, 9 had improved scores. The CDSS showed significant reduction in scores from baseline to final visit. No significant changes were noted in laboratory tests, prolactin levels, EKG, and physical examination. Concomitant administration of lorazepam, carbamazepine, divalproex sodium, and lithium carbonate caused no adverse consequences. The reduction of positive and negative symptoms, lack of significant extrapyramidal symptoms and other side effects, and lack of any significant drug interaction suggest that olanzapine may be a safe and effective antipsychotic medication in the elderly.",

    "81": "Benzodiazepine receptor (BDZR) ligands are structurally diverse compounds that bind to specific binding sites on GABA(A) receptors and allosterically modulate the effect of GABA on chloride ion flux. The binding of BDZR ligands to this receptor system results in activity at multiple behavioral endpoints, including anxiolytic, sedative, anticonvulsant, and hyperphagic effects. In the work presented here, a computational procedure developed in our laboratory has been used to obtain a 3D pharmacophore for ligand recognition of the GABA(A)/BDZRs initiating the hyperphagic response. To accomplish this goal, 17 structurally diverse compounds, previously assessed in our laboratory for activity at the hyperphagic endpoint, were used. The result is a four-component 3D pharmacophore. It consists of two proton acceptor atoms, the centroid of an aromatic ring and the centroid of a hydrophobic moiety in a common geometric arrangement in all compounds with activity at this endpoint. This 3D pharmacophore was then assessed and successfully validated using three different tests. First, two BDZR ligands, which were included as negative controls in the set of seventeen compounds used for the pharmacophore development, did not fit the pharmacophore. Second, some benzodiazepine ligands known to have activity at the hyperphagia endpoint, but not included in the pharmacophore development, were used as positive controls and were found to fit the pharmacophore. Finally, using the 3D pharmacophore developed in the present work to search 3D databases, over 50 classical benzodiazepines were found. Among them, were benzodiazepine ligands known to have an effect at the hyperphagic endpoint. In addition, the novel compounds also found in this search are promising therapeutic agents that could beneficially affect feeding behavior.",

    "89": "The existence of a modulatory system controlling the acetylcholine (ACh) release was first proposed for the nicotinic subtype in 1962. Following the first observation of a possible positive feedback loop activated by the released Ach, many studies were oriented in the investigation of the involved presynaptic autoreceptors. Most of the data have been obtained at the motor end-plate, commonly defined as the simplest model of peripheral synapse. The characterization of the chemical transmission since its first proposal showed a more complex pattern involving both the cholinergic and the adrenergic systems. It is now evident that this regulation is widespread both in the central and in the peripheral nervous system. The evidence that the release of ACh can be up- or down-regulated by the transmitter itself (autoregulation) or other neuromediators (heteroregulation) is now proved. In the last decades the attention was focused to the identification of the receptor subtypes located on the releasing nerve terminal. For the purpose, different techniques were used in the various laboratories. The functional approach was based mainly on the electrophysiological characterization of the events evolved prior, during and after the activation of the motor endplate nicotinic receptor. On the other hand, the overflow studies were carried out using radiolabeled ACh (rACh) obtained treating muscle fibers with radioactive choline (rCh). Many scientific papers proposed common data indicating a clear positive (nicotinic) or negative (muscarinic) modulation of the ACh release. Temporally, the description of the muscarinic regulation followed the discovery of the nicotinic one. However, by a pure pharmacological point of view it represents a challenge due to the more complex organization and function. In the peripheral nervous system, i.e. neuromuscular, the meaning of both the muscarinic and nicotinic modulations may appear as free of function. Conversely, in the central systems some effects, such as antinociception and others, could represent the basis of a functional activity such as proposed by Corrado group. The complete characterization of this phenomenon by a physiological and a pharmacological point of view could represents the goal for future uses and therapeutic potential. The present review illustrates the know how and the efforts in the characterisation of the muscarinic regulation of transmitter release from the beginning of its discovery trying to order the numerous scientific data published in this field. Furthermore, our personal data obtained with the Loose Patch Clamp (LPC) technique will be briefly presented and discussed. Our work was built up using agonists and antagonists of the muscarinic receptor subtype in the aim of better characterize the modulation function of the mediator Ach. We used carbachol (Cch), oxotremorine (Oxo) and dl-muscarine as agonists and 1-hyoscyamine, pirenzepine, ipratropium, 11[[2-1[(diethylamino) methyl-1-piperidinyl]-acetyl]-5, 11-dihydro-6H-pyrido [2,3-b][1,4] benzodiazepine-6-one (AFDX-116), methoctramine and 1,1-dimethyl-4 diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) as antagonists.", 
    "90": "The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) response profiles of IMR-32 human neuroblastoma cells were examined using whole-cell patch clamp and RT-PCR techniques. GABA activated a concentration-dependent and bicuculline-sensitive current, and RT-PCR revealed the expression of multiple GABA(A) receptor subunit mRNAs (alpha(1), alpha(3), alpha(4), beta(1), beta(3), gamma(2), and delta). A pharmacological profile of the GABA-induced current was derived using several subunit-selective agents. Diazepam, which requires the presence of a gamma subunit in order to modulate GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses, potentiated GABA-induced currents in a subset of IMR-32 cells. Two populations of GABA-activated currents were also evident based on sensitivity to modulation by zinc. Comparison of zinc- and diazepam-induced modulation of GABA-induced current responses in the same cells revealed an inverse correlation between these two modulators. No differences, however, were observed with the GABA(A) receptor modulators loreclezole, allopregnanolone, and pentobarbital. Thus, IMR-32 cells maintained in culture are heterogeneous in terms of expression of GABA(A) receptor isoforms.",

Olanzapine appeared superior to placebo at six weeks for the outcome of 'no important clinical response' (RR 0.88 CI 0.8-0.98, NNT 8 CI 5-27), but trial data regarding negative symptoms are equivocal for this comparison. Dizziness and dry mouth were more common in the olanzapine-treated group, and, although not statistically significant, the olanzapine group gained more weight. Data from several small trials are incomplete; but, for the short term outcome of 'no important clinical response', olanzapine seem as effective as typical antipsychotics (n=2778, RR 0.9 CI 0.76-1.06).

The other study (Anand 1999) comparing midazolam to morphine and placebo found no statistically significant difference in sedation level among the three groups, but statistically significantly higher level of sedation was found in the midazolam group compared with the placebo group during the treatment infusion. However, since the sedation scales used in both studies have not been validated in preterm infants, the effectiveness of midazolam as a sedative in this population could not be ascertained based on the findings of these two studies. In the study by Jacqz-Aigrain (1994), blood pressures were statistically significantly lower in the midazolam group than in the placebo group on days 1 and 2, although there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of hypotension requiring albumin or vasoactive drugs between groups. The study by Anand (1999) showed a statistically significant higher incidence of adverse neurologic events (death, grade III-IV IVH, PVL) in the midazolam group compared with the other groups.

Omeprazole was used as reference drug. The morphometric analysis of gastric histological sections revealed that pantoprazole and omeprazole dose-dependently prevented the necrotic mucosal injury evoked by ethanol-HCl (ED50 = 14.1 and 21.6 micromol/kg, respectively). These effects were associated with a marked increment of Alcian blue recovery from gastric bound mucus (ED50 = 18.8 and 29.3 micromol/kg, respectively). In addition, both pantoprazole and omeprazole inhibited gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats (ED50 = 1.5 and 3.3 micromol/kg, respectively). Further experiments indicated that the protective effects of pantoprazole were not modified by L-365,260 (a gastrin receptor antagonist), suramin (a drug able to interfere with endogenous growth factors), N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) or systemic ablation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory nerves, whereas they were partly blocked by indomethacin (an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis) and fully prevented by N-ethylmaleimide (a potent blocker of sulfhydryl compounds). The present data provide histomorphometric evidence that: 1) pantoprazole is endowed with gastroprotective properties and is more active than omeprazole in preventing the necrotic mucosal damage induced by ethanol-HCl; 2) according to the rank order of ED50 values, the protective effects of both drugs appear to depend mainly on the enhancement of the gastric mucosal barrier rather than on the inhibition of acid secretion; 3) an increased production of prostaglandins, as well as an increased availability of sulfhydryl radicals at the level of the gastric mucosa may account for the gastroprotective effects of pantoprazole.",

In order to assess the feasibility of this approach for the emergency treatment of status epilepticus, three anticovulsants, i.e. diazepam (DZ), clonazepam (CZ), and a monocarbamate-based new compound (MCA) were studied in rabbits for the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) response following intravenous (IV) and IN administrations. The animals were intranasally dosed with DZ (1 mg/kg), CZ (0.2 mg/kg), and MCA (5 mg/kg), dissolved in 200 microl of vehicle consisting of propylene glycol (PG), ethanol (EtOH), and water in the presence or absence of 1% sodium glycocholate (SGC) using single and repeated dosing schedules. Both DZ and CZ were absorbed very rapidly from 1% SGC/60% PG-30% EtOH-10% Water after IN single application; the T(max)'s were less than 2 min. The absorption rate of MCA was relatively slower with the peak time of 13-32 min. The bioavailability of single IN administration for DZ, CZ, and MCA determined over the first 2 or 4 h was found to be 77, 45, and 79%, respectively. The peak plasma level of DZ increased linearly with increasing the volume fraction of EtOH in the ternary cosolvent (20% to 60%). A repeated IN application of DZ, 5 min after the first dose, doubled the C(max) and AUC(0-2 h) values of the first one, whereas those of CZ and MCA resulted in an increase of 73-94% of the first dose. A single IN application of DZ- and CZ-containing formulations produced a PD response within 1.5 min, which was comparable to that of an IV injection. These results suggest that single or repeated IN applications of DZ, CZ, and MCA in a hydroalcohol-glycolic formulation might represent a viable approach to achieving a rapid systemic absorption of these anticonvulsants during the emergency treatment of status epilepticus and other types of seizures.",

For this reason, we investigated if addition of a low dose of oral ketamine (MIKE: ketamine 3 mg kg-1, midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1) resulted in better premedication compared with oral midazolam 0.5 mg kg-1 or ketamine 6 mg kg-1 alone, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study. We studied 120 children (mean age 5.7 (range 2-10) yr) undergoing surgery of more than 30 min duration. After oral premedication in the ward and transfer, the child's condition in the induction room was evaluated by assigning 1-4 points to the quality of anxiolysis, sedation, behaviour at separation from parent and during venepuncture (transfer score). On days 1 and 7 after operation, parents were interviewed for changes in behaviour (eating, sleep, dreams, toilet training), recollection and satisfaction, using a standardized questionnaire. The groups were similar in age, sex, weight, intervention and duration of anaesthesia. The transfer score was significantly better in the MIKE group (12.5 (95% confidence interval (CI) 11.9-13.1)) than in the ketamine or midazolam groups (10.6 (9.8-11.4) and 11.5 (10.7-12.3), respectively). Success rates for anxiolysis and behaviour at separation were greater than 90% with the combination, approximately 70% with midazolam and only 51% with ketamine alone. The incidence of salivation, excitation and psychotic symptoms was low in all groups. Vertigo and emesis before induction were significantly more frequent after ketamine premedication. During recovery, there were no differences in sedation or time of possible discharge. After 1 week, parents reported nightmares (ketamine five, midazolam three, MIKE one), restless sleep (five/four/four) or negative memories (three/four/one). There were no major or continuing disturbances in behaviour or development. In summary, significantly better anxiolysis and separation were observed with a combination of ketamine and midazolam, even in awake children (sedation was not successful according to the preset criteria), than with midazolam or ketamine alone. Duration of action and side effects of the combination were similar to those of midazolam. The combination of both drugs in strawberry flavoured glucose syrup (pH 4.5 approximately) is chemically stable for 8 weeks.",

It is not known if this type of analysis may be helpful in monitoring depth of sedation. In an open-label, uncontrolled investigation, the effect of midazolam on the transfer function between AP and IBI, and on spectral indices of AP and heart rate (HR) variability (APV, HRV) were assessed in the absence and presence of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. We studied 11 healthy male volunteers. After an initial control period of 60 min, we studied three consecutive periods, each of 60 min duration, with progressively increasing concentrations of midazolam (0.02, 0.06, 0.14 mg kg-1 h-1). A final 60-min period during administration of flumazenil 0.004 mg kg-1 h-1 and while the agonist was still present was also studied. To confirm midazolam-induced central nervous system effects, electroencephalography was performed and Ramsay sedation scores were determined. With increasing dose of midazolam, the high frequency (0.15-0.4 Hz) component of the transfer function between AP and IBI decreased progressively (mean 26.5 (SEM 3.7), 19.2 (2.9), 12.8 (1.7), 8.4 (1.6) ms mm Hg-1). This effect was antagonized by flumazenil (21.5 (3.2) ms mm Hg-1). Other indices (e.g. HRV, APV) did not reveal such a clear response to midazolam dose and flumazenil application. Thus in healthy male volunteers, the transfer function between AP and IBI in the parasympathetically dominated high frequency range varies according to benzodiazepine agonism and antagonism. This finding has potential implications for monitoring the effects of benzodiazepines.",

Eighty per cent of patients received ketamine and a benzodiazepine, and the remaining 20% received methohexital or thiopental and fentanyl. No cricoid pressure or tracheal intubation was performed. A single case of mild aspiration was detected in a woman anasthetised with methohexital (an incidence of 0.053%).

    "134": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) belongs to the main inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and activates three types of specific receptors--GABAA, GABAB i GABAC. At present, little is known about GABAC-mediated events. GABAB receptors are metabotropic, whilst stimulation of ionotropic GABAA receptors results in opening the chloride channel, followed by influx of chloride ions and hyperpolarization. The GABAA receptor possesses also binding sites for benzodiazepines and barbiturates which, via these sites, enhance GABAA-mediated events. Another antiepileptic drug potentiating GABA-ergic inhibition is valproate, which increases synthesis of GABA and reduces its metabolism. Among new antiepileptic drugs associated with the GABA-ergic system are tiagabine, vigabatrin, and to a certain degree--gabapentin. Tiagabine blocks neuronal and glial uptake of GABA whilst vigabatrin increases the synaptic concentration of GABA by inhibition of GABA aminotransferase. Gabapentin, probably through the activation of glutamic acid decarboxylase, leads to the increase in synaptic GABA. However, this antiepileptic drug also binds to specific sites within voltage-dependent calcium channels, which results in reduced intraneuronal concentration of calcium ions. Presumably, tiagabine and vigabatrin possess only one mechanism of action, associated with increased GABA-ergic inhibition. Although topiramate and felbamate were shown to enhance GABA-mediated events, they have additional mechanisms of action, including blockade of voltage-dependent sodium channels and inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission.",

In addition, the type of neuron expressing GABA(A) receptors was identified using immunohistochemical methods. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings of currents elicited by GABA and acetylcholine (ACh) were obtained using pipettes containing Neurobiotin. After electrophysiological studies, neurons were processed for localization of calbindin-D28K-immunoreactivity (calbindin-ir). GABA (1 mM) and ACh (3 mM) caused inward currents in most cells tested. GABA currents were mimicked by muscimol (1-300 microM) and were blocked by bicuculline (10 microM) indicating that GABA was acting at GABA(A) receptors. GABA currents were associated with a conductance increase and a linear current/voltage relationship with a reversal potential of 1 +/- 1 mV (n = 5). Pentobarbital (PB, 3-1000 microM) and diazepam (DZP, 0.01-10 microM) potentiated GABA-induced currents. A maximum concentration of DZP (1 microM) increased GABA-induced currents 3.1 +/- 0.3 times while PB (1000 microM) increased GABA currents by 11 +/- 2 times. In outside-out patches, the amplitude of GABA-activated single-channel currents was linearly related to membrane potential with a single-channel conductance of 28.5 + 0.5 pS (n = 10). PB and DZP increased the open probability of GABA-induced single-channel currents. Neurons containing calbindin-ir were large, were isolated from other neurons and had GABA current amplitudes of -3.4 +/- 0.3 nA (n = 48). Neurons with weak or absent calbindin-ir were smaller, were localized in clusters of cells and had GABA-induced current amplitudes of -0.6 +/- 0.1 nA (n = 20). ACh-induced currents were smaller in calbindin-ir neurons (-0.7 +/- 0.1 nA) compared to weakly calbindin-ir neurons (-1.4 +/- 0.1 nA). These results indicate that myenteric calbindin-ir neurons express a high density of GABA(A) receptors. Cell size and location allow visual identification of neurons likely to contain calbindin-ir permitting targeted studies of the properties of these neurons.",

Reappearance of seizures may be due to lack of protection and/or an abstinence syndrome. Seizures due to lack of protection occur following withdrawal of any antiepileptic drug when the epilepsy is not cured; they may not reappear for years (although over 80% occur within a year) and treatment then has to be restarted. They seem to be less frequent after withdrawal of carbamazepine or phenytoin than after withdrawing valproate, although the reason for this is not understood. Seizures due to an abstinence syndrome only occur after withdrawing benzodiazepines, phenobarbitone and primidone; they are seen in patients with both active and inactive epilepsy whilst the drug is being withdrawn and tend to be self-limiting. It is not necessary to reintroduce the drug when epilepsy is cured. Felbamate and vigabatrin cause seizures related to their withdrawal, but the mechanism of this is not clear. There is no scientifically established guideline for withdrawing antiepileptic drugs, but it is considered important to stop one at a time, starting with those which may cause abstinence syndromes, followed by the more toxic, less effective antiepileptic drugs, which cause more drug interactions and are more awkward to take.",

    "161": "The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol and the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine on both extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as well as electrical activity of mesoprefrontal DA (mPFC-DA) neurons. Extracellular single unit recordings and microdialysis experiments were carried out in different groups of chloral hydrate anesthetised rats under identical experimental conditions. Intravenous administration of haloperidol, clozapine, and olanzapine increased the firing rate and burst activity of antidromically-identified mPFC-DA neurons; maximal increase in firing rate of approximately 140, 155, and 70 %, was produced by haloperidol, clozapine, and olanzapine at doses of 0.2, 2.5, and 1 mg/kg, i.v., respectively. Intravenous administration of the same doses increased extracellular DA levels in mPFC by 20%, 190%, and 70%, respectively. Moreover, while haloperidol and olanzapine increased extracellular levels of the deaminated DA metabolite DOPAC, by 60% and 40%, respectively, clozapine was totally ineffective. The D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 modified neither DA output nor neuronal firing. To determine whether the effect of the three antipsychotics on DA release might depend on a direct action on the mPFC, rats were perfused locally via inverse dialysis in the mPFC at concentrations ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-4)M. While clozapine and olanzapine increased extracellular DA concentrations by up to 400% of basal level, haloperidol was totally ineffective. The results obtained from this study indicate that the rank potency of the three antipsychotics in stimulating the firing rate of DA neurons projecting to mPFC, correlates with their affinity for D2 receptors and doses used clinically. On the other hand, their stimulating effect on DA release does not correlate with their effect on neuronal firing but depends on a direct action on the mPFC.",

Amyloid plaques called also senile plaques situated extracellularly cause loss of neurons, especially cholinergic neurons, that begin in Nucleus of Meynert. However, recent evidence from postmortem brain and fibroblast studies suggests that both adenylyl cyclase and phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis signal transduction cascades are disrupted in AD. Such disruption may limit cholinergic pharmacotherapy. Other disorders, like disturbances in releasing Neuronal Growth Factor (NGF), oxidative stress, free Ca 2+, neuroimmunologic reactions are also important in AD brain changer. Only use of acetylcholine inhibitors: tacrine, donepezil and Gingko Biloba as well as nimodipine improved mental functions (MMSE screening). Neuroprotection of selegiline and NGF was observed. Behavioral symptoms often associated with dementia, like depression, anxiety, irritability, delusions, aggressiveness were treated with: olazepine, risperidone, haloperidol, clozapine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodon, dezypramine, lithium, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine and valproic acid.

    "165": "The purpose of this article--based on the recent years literature--is discussing the principles of the use of clozapine in schizophrenia, with the special attention to treatment-resistance as a main indication, dose selection and duration of the trial. In spite of dynamic development of pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia, clozapine, registered in Europe 25 years ago, still remains a drug of choice in treatment-resistant schizophrenia, that is in 5-25% of patients, bringing a substantial clinical improvement in 30-50% of the group. The main factor limiting the possibility of the use of clozapine is the increased risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis, what demands the WBC monitoring. Old age and female sex are considered to be potential risk factors. In both classical neuroleptics and clozapine, no clear linear correlation was noticed between the dose and clinical effect. It seems, however, that only in case of clozapine a noticeable correlation exists between the plasma level and clinical improvement. Many authors try to define a threshold level sufficient/necessary to achieve improvement. Suggested amounts are between 250-420 ng/ml. With fixed doses used, extremely different levels of clozapine are observed (from a few, to thousands ng/ml), so measuring plasma level is suggested as a routine procedure in cases of clozapine-resistance. The duration of the trial creates real controversy. Most authors agree that six weeks time, sufficient to diagnose treatment resistance in case of typical neuroleptics, may be too short for clozapine. At the same time, the postulated prolongation of the trial to a few months or even one year, explained by the presence of late improvements, is not well and generally accepted. It seems that time of 2-4 months is in most cases sufficient to notice the potential advantage. The problem of clozapine-resistance still remains open. Many strategies are being proposed (augmentation with lithium, valproate, sulpiride and benzodiazepines), but they demand further examination.", 
    "166": "The frequency of sleep complaints in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is estimated to be between 60-90% and a variety of either disease-related or secondary mechanisms and the dopaminergic treatment itself contributes to the development of different sleep disturbances. These comprise slight, fragmented sleep with increased number of arousals and awakenings, and PD-specific motor phenomena such as nocturnal immobility, rest tremor, eye-blinking, dyskinesias, and other phenomena such as periodic and nonperiodic limb movements in sleep, restless legs syndrome, fragmentary myoclonus, and respiratory dysfunction in sleep. Depression and hallucinations/psychosis further complicate the picture. The incidence of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) with nightmares and violent behavior is increased in PD and may occur as a preclinical disease-related symptom. A careful sleep history of patients and their partners, polysomnograms when necessary, motor and psychiatric assessments should precede individual treatment strategies, which include adjusting dopaminergic daytime treatment, benzodiazepines for RBD, reduction of anticholinergic drugs, and, if necessary, clozapine for nocturnal psychosis.",

Starting from the appropriate chloro-substituted phenylazides, the series of 7 or 8 chloro-substituted triazoloquinazolines were prepared. Nitration reactions of the triazoloquinazoline ring and chlorination reactions of the hydroxyl group in the 5 position of the same ring are also reported. By nucleophilic displacement of halogen, the corresponding 5-amino derivatives and some analogous derivatives bearing cyclohexylamino and p-toluidino substituents were obtained.

Measures such as P50 suppression are used to study cognitive and attentional dysfunction among these patients. P50 suppression is an operational measure of sensory gating that can be assessed by averaging electroencephalographic responses to multiple pairs of auditory clicks separated by 500 msec. Normally, the P50 response to the second click is smaller than the response to the first click. Many studies have demonstrated that schizophrenia patients have deficient P50 suppression, meaning that the difference between the first and second clicks is not as large as normal. Atypical antipsychotic medications may have superior clinical efficacy for negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. It is important, therefore, to evaluate the effects of atypical antipsychotic medications on measures such as P50 suppression.",

Preliminary cost and LOS data from this review was used to create a parental survey measuring attitudes toward the costs of an unnamed form of sedation (not mentioning oral midazolam). A convenience sample of parents in an ED waiting room were asked if they would want sedation administered to a child needing sutures if this increased the visit cost by $100 and/or increased LOS by 30 minutes.

    "180": "Mitochondria participate in intracellular Ca2+ buffering and signalling. They are also major mediators of cell death. Toxic Ca2+ accumulation in mitochondria is widely believed to initiate cell death in many cell types by opening the permeability transition pore (PTP). In non-neuronal cells, the PTP has been implicated as a Ca2+ release mechanism in physiological Ca2+ signalling. In neurons, Ca2+ release from mitochondria has been attributed primarily to mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchange. Using fura-2 ratiometric microfluorimetry in acutely dissociated rat basal forebrain neurons, we show that mitochondria are able to buffer non-toxic Ca2+ loads arising from caffeine-sensitive internal stores or from extracellular influx through voltage gated channels. We also show that these non-toxic Ca2+ loads are reversibly released from mitochondria through the PTP and the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Evoked Ca2+ transients have characteristic peak and shoulder features mediated by mitochondrial buffering and release. Depolarizing mitochondria with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP, 5 microM) causes release of mitochondrial Ca2+ and prevents Ca2+ uptake. In CCCP, the magnitudes of evoked Ca2+ transients are increased, and the peak and shoulder features are eliminated. The PTP antagonist, cyclosporin A, (CSA, 2 microM) and the Na+/Ca2+ exchange blocker, clonazepam, (CLO, 20 microM) reversibly inhibited both the shoulder features of evoked Ca2+ transients and Ca2+ transients associated with CCCP application. We suggest that central neuronal mitochondria buffer and release Ca2+ through the PTP and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger during physiological Ca2+ signalling. We also suggest that CLO blocks both the PTP and the mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger.",

The incidence of minimal seizures after clobazam pretreatment was not increased in 7- and 12-day-old rat pups. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures were markedly suppressed by clobazam in all age groups. In 18-day-old and older animals clobazam doses suppressing generalized seizures were always lower than those necessary for exerting an effect on minimal seizures.

    "182": "The action of a water-soluble benzodiazepine midazolam (0.1 and 1 mg/kg i.p.) was tested against three models of spike-and-wave rhythm in rats: rhythmic metrazol activity (a model of human absence seizures), minimal metrazol seizures, and epileptic afterdischarges induced by low-frequency cortical stimulation (probably models of human myoclonic seizures). Midazolam was able to reduce spike-and-wave activity in all three models, but there were quantitative differences: the lower dose was effective only against rhythmic metrazol activity, but its action against two other models was negligible, whereas the higher dose of midazolam resulted in significant effects in all three models. These quantitative differences are not sufficient to prove our hypothesis that the spike-and-wave rhythm represents different phenomena in various models. A spread of epileptic activity into brain structures other than the thalamocortical system determines the type of epileptic seizures.", 
    "183": "Brain levels of TNF-alpha increase in many inflammatory conditions, including HIV-1 infection, and may contribute to neurodegenerative processes. The paucity of agents that can selectively and potently block TNF-alpha processing or its receptors has led us to investigate the role of TNF-alpha in chronic neurodegeneration associated with retroviral infection using mice with targeted deletions of the TNF-alpha gene. Infection of wild-type C57BL/6 mice with the LP-BM5 murine leukemia retrovirus mixture leads to the development of a severe immunodeficiency as well as cognitive deficits and neuronal damage. TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice infected with LP-BM5 developed a systemic immunopathology indistinguishable in severity from that observed in contemporaneously infected wild-type mice. In contrast, the performance of infected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice in the Y-maze and Morris water maze was not different from that of uninfected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. The extent of glial activation in the striatum, as indicated by the increase in density of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, was equivalent in both groups of LP-BM5-infected mice. However, the decrease in striatal MAP-2 expression, a marker of neurodegeneration observed in infected wild-type mice, was not found in infected TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. While the loss of TNF-alpha appeared to have no effect on the course or severity of the central or peripheral immunopathology resulting from LP-BM5 infection, the behavioral and biochemical manifestations were substantially curtailed in the TNF-alpha-(-/-) mice. These findings directly support a role for TNF-alpha in the neurodegenerative processes associated with viral infections such as HIV-1.", 
    "184": "N,N'-Propylenedinicotinamide (Nicaraven) is presently being developed for the treatment of cerebral stroke including subarachnoid hemorrhage. This drug is promising because some data suggest it to have an ability to scavenge the hydroxyl radical under physiological conditions in vivo, while it also has a high permeability through the blood brain barrier. Using the kinetic constant of the reaction between the hydroxyl radical and dimethyl sulfoxide, the formula derived by Babbs and Griffin (Free Rad. Biol. Med., 6 1989) was applied to obtain the kinetic constant of Nicaraven with the hydroxyl radical using a dimethyl sulfoxide-xanthine oxidase-hypoxanthine-Fe system, and this yielded the kinetic constant 3.4x10(9) M(-1) s(-1) (1 M=1 mol dm(-3)) for Nicaraven. Structurally related compounds were also investigated. The amide group of Nicaraven was thus found to play an important part in the reaction with the hydroxyl radical. Methanesulfinic acid, which was obtained from the reaction between dimethyl sulfoxide and the hydroxyl radical, was found to be stable under this adopted experimental condition and therefore was used to quantify the kinetic constant of Nicaraven. The structure of Nicaraven has also been investigated in CDCl3 using IR spectra, computer calculations and 1H-NMR analysis, and Nicaraven was thus shown to have an intramolecular hydrogen bond which forms a 7-membered ring that resembles a part of the 1H-1,4-benzodiazepines. This structure may play an important role in the penetration through the blood brain barrier.",

Whereas the search for alcohol, barbiturates and opiates was negative, benzodiazepines and tricyclic antidepressants were present. The patient was in fact being treated with fluvoxamine, amitryptiline, and alprazolam. As the clinical and biological signs suggested chlorate poisoning, chlorate was looked for by using an aniline color reaction. It was found in gastric content and urine. Treatment consisted in mechanical ventilation, vasoactive amines, methylene blue, plasma exchange, exchange transfusion, and haemodialysis. Despite this, the patient had several cardiac arrests and refractory metabolic acidosis. He died 12 h after his admission. Specific ion chromatography was used afterhand to assay the chlorate in various body fluids. The technique was based on a separation on an ion exchange Dionex AS 12A column coupled with conductivity detection. A quantitative estimation was carried out by using external calibration with a four-point calibration curve which was linear between 1 and 15 mg/L. The measured plasma levels of chlorate were 78 and 29 mg/L respectively before and after exchange transfusion. Gastric-lavage liquid contained 1300 mg/L of chlorate and urine 4300 mg/L.

The analysis of olanzapine was performed by the solid-phase extraction of 1.0 mL of buffered serum or blood, followed by gas chromatography separation with nitrogen-phosphorus detection. The analysis of the clinical serum samples showed that 86% of positive serum values were within the range of 5 to 75 ng/mL, with a mean and median of 36 and 26 ng/mL, respectively. These data suggest that the concentrations of olanzapine expected during therapy may be higher than those previously reported. In 58 postmortem whole blood specimens the mean olanzapine concentration was 358 ng/mL with a range of 10 to 5200 ng/mL. Further, investigation of deaths involving olanzapine suggest that potential toxicity should be considered at concentrations above 100 ng/mL.

    "189": "Potential changes in the spinal GABAergic activity after nerve injury were studied by comparing the effects of systemic administration of the benzodiazepine midazolam on the noxious evoked responses of dorsal horn in rats with spinal nerve ligation of neuropathy and control animals. The tight ligation of the L(5) and L6 spinal nerves was performed in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and resulting mechanical and cold allodynia were assessed with von Frey hairs and the acetone drop test. Single unit extracellular recordings of dorsal horn neurones were performed 15-18 days after the surgery under halothane anaesthesia using transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the receptive field at three times the C-fibre threshold. The rats in the spinal nerve ligation group, but not in the sham-operated control group developed mechanical and cold allodynia. Subcutaneous administration of midazolam 0.1-3.0 mg/kg reduced the Adelta-fibre evoked activity in a dose-related manner in all study groups, but the C-fibre evoked activity was significantly reduced only in the spinal nerve ligation group. The inhibitory effects of s.c. midazolam were significantly reversed by i.t. administration of flumazenil, suggesting a spinal site of action. Midazolam reduced C-fibre evoked firing significantly more in the spinal nerve ligation model than in the non-operated or sham controls. These results indicate changes in the spinal GABAergic system in the neuropathic animals and could be of importance in the development of new treatments for neuropathic pain.", 
    "190": "The effect of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), a selective glutamate receptor agonist, on the release of previously incorporated [(3)H]GABA was examined in superfused striatal slices of the rat. The slices were loaded with [(3)H]GABA in the presence of beta-alanine (1 mM) and superfused with Krebs-bicarbonate buffer containing nipecotic acid (0.1 mM) and aminooxyacetic acid (0.1 mM) to inhibit GABA uptake and metabolism. AMPA (0.01 to 3 mM) increased basal [(3)H]GABA outflow and nipecotic acid potentiated this effect. The [(3)H]GABA releasing effect of AMPA was an external Ca(2+)-dependent process in the absence but not in the presence of nipecotic acid. Cyclothiazide (0.03 mM), a positive modulator of AMPA receptors, failed to evoke [(3)H]GABA release by itself, but it dose-dependently potentiated the [(3)H]GABA releasing effect of AMPA. The AMPA (0.3 mM)-induced [(3)H]GABA release was antagonized by NBQX (0.01 mM) in a competitive fashion (pA(2) 5.08). The negative modulator of AMPA receptors, GYKI-53784 (0.01 mM) reversed the AMPA-induced [(3)H]GABA release by a non-competitive manner (pD'(2) 5.44). GYKI-53784 (0. 01-0.1 mM) also decreased striatal [(3)H]GABA outflow on its own right, this effect was stereoselective and was not influenced by concomitant administration of 0.03 mM cyclothiazide. GYKI-52466 (0. 03-0.3 mM), another negative modulator at AMPA receptors, also inhibited basal [(3)H]GABA efflux whereas NBQX (0.1 mM) by itself was ineffective in alteration of [(3)H]GABA outflow. The present data indicate that AMPA evokes GABA release from the vesicular pool in neostriatal GABAergic neurons. They also confirm that multiple interactions may exist between the agonist binding sites and the positive and negative modulatory sites but no such interaction was detected between the positive and negative allosteric modulators. Since GYKI-53784, but not NBQX, inhibited [(3)H]GABA release by itself, AMPA receptors located on striatal GABAergic neurons may be in sensitized state and phasically controlled by endogenous glutamate. It is also postulated that these AMPA receptors are located extrasynaptically on GABAergic striatal neurons.", 
    "191": "In this prospective study, we evaluated the combined influence of age and premedication on propofol requirements for the induction of anesthesia and their hemodynamic effects using a target-controlled infusion. We studied 180 patients separated into three age groups: 20-39 yr, 40-59 yr, and more than 59 yr. In each age group, patients were randomly allocated to receive either no premedication (n = 20), fentanyl (2 microg/kg) (n = 20), or midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) plus fentanyl (2 microg/kg) (n = 20). The concentration of propofol targeted for the induction was 5 microg/mL, to be reached in 2 min. The dose, time, and predicted plasma concentration of propofol at hypnosis were measured. Baseline and postinduction heart rate and arterial blood pressure were registered. Computer simulation was used to calculate the effect site propofol concentration at hypnosis. The concentration of propofol, effect site propofol concentration, time, and induction dose and their hemodynamic effect were significantly different among groups with respect to age and premedication. The combined effect of the two factors was additive, but without significant interaction. The propofol requirements were significantly less in the midazolam-fentanyl groups, regardless of age, and among the premedicated patients older than 60 yr compared with the other age groups. We conclude that the combined effect of age and premedication on the requirements of propofol for the induction of anesthesia should be considered when the concentration is targeted with a target-controlled infusion system.",

Visual analog scores for pain were significantly lower in those patients who received sedation before the block, both at the time of block performance (14 +/- 1 vs 27 +/- 2 mm, P < 0.0001) and at discharge (11 +/- 1 vs 24 +/- 2 mm, P < 0. 0001). We conclude that the association of sufentanil and midazolam produced minimal sedation while significantly reducing pain experienced by patients undergoing multiple nerve stimulation."
