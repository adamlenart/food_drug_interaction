    "0": "The effect of diazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, on the post-traumatic hyperactivity of excitatory synaptic transmission was examined in rat hippocampal CA1 area. Optical recordings showed that the activity of hippocampal neurons was enhanced in rats treated with fluid percussion injury (FPI) as compared with that of sham-operated rats. The optical response was characterized by fast and slow components. FPI did not affect the fast component that reflects presynaptic action potentials, but enhanced the slow component that reflects excitatory synaptic responses. Intracellular recordings showed that the amplitude and duration of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) were increased after FPI. However, FPI did not affect the resting membrane potential and action potentials of hippocampal neurons. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of diazepam (30 and 90 min after FPI) attenuated the post-traumatic hyperactivity of the slow optical response. The slope of input-to-output relation of excitatory synapses was decreased by acute administration of diazepam to FPI rats, but not by delayed administration of diazepam (4 and 5 h after FPI). The fast optical responses were not affected by either FPI or i.p. administration of diazepam. These results suggest that administration of diazepam at early post-traumatic period prevents the FPI-induced delayed enhancement of excitatory synaptic transmission in rat hippocampal CA1 neurons.",

We therefore conducted a post-hoc analysis of clinical trial data, examining early weight gain as a predictor of later substantial weight gain.", 
    "2": "Data from 669 (Study 1) and 102 (Study 2) olanzapine-treated patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder were analyzed to identify and validate weight gain cut-offs at Weeks 1-4 that were predictive of substantial weight gain (defined as an increase of > or = 5, 7, 10 kg or 7% of baseline weight) after approximately 30 weeks of treatment. Baseline characteristics alone, baseline characteristics plus weight change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 3 or 4, and weight change from baseline to Weeks 1, 2, 3, or 4 alone were evaluated as predictors of substantial weight gain. Similar analyses were performed to determine BMI increase cut-offs at Weeks 1-4 of treatment that were predictive of substantial increase in BMI (1, 2 or 3 kg/m2 increase from baseline).", 
    "3": "At Weeks 1 and 2, predictions based on early weight gain plus baseline characteristics were more robust than those based on early weight gain alone. However, by Weeks 3 and 4, there was little difference between the operating characteristics associated with these two sets of predictors. The positive predictive values ranged from 30.1% to 73.5%, while the negative predictive values ranged from 58.1% to 89.0%. Predictions based on early BMI increase plus baseline characteristics were not uniformly more robust at any time compared to those based on early BMI increase alone. The positive predictive values ranged from 38.3% to 83.5%, while negative predictive values ranged from 42.1% to 84.7%. For analyses of both early weight gain and early BMI increase, results for the validation dataset were similar to those observed in the primary dataset.", 
    "4": "Results from these analyses can be used by clinicians to evaluate risk of substantial weight gain or BMI increase for individual patients. For instance, negative predictive values based on data from these studies suggest approximately 88% of patients who gain less than 2 kg by Week 3 will gain less than 10 kg after 26-34 weeks of olanzapine treatment. Analysis of changes in BMI suggests that approximately 84% of patients who gain less than .64 kg/m2 in BMI by Week 3 will gain less than 3 kg/m2 in BMI after 26-34 weeks of olanzapine treatment. Further research in larger patient populations for longer periods is necessary to confirm these results.", 
    "5": "Agmatine blocks morphine physical dependence in mammals, but its effects on withdrawal signs caused by other abused drugs have been less studied. One of the reasons is that withdrawal to some of these drugs is difficult to quantify in mammals. An alternative to mammals is planarians, a type of flatworm. Planarians possess mammalian-like neurotransmitters and display withdrawal from amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, and opioids. The withdrawal is manifested as a reduction in locomotor behavior following discontinuation of drug exposure. In the present study, our goal was to identify agmatine in planarians and to determine if planarians exposed to agmatine display withdrawal to methamphetamine, a cannabinoid receptor agonist (WIN 55,212-2), or a kappa-opioid receptor agonist (U-50,488H). Neurochemical experiments revealed that the concentration of agmatine in planarians was 185 +/- 33.7 pmol per mg of planarian weight (dry weight). In behavioral experiments, withdrawal (i.e., reduced locomotor activity) was observed when planarians exposed to each drug (10 microM) for 60 min were placed into water. The withdrawal was attenuated when methamphetamine- or U-50,488H-exposed planarians were tested in agmatine (100 microM). Withdrawal was inhibited similarly when planarians coexposed to agmatine (100 microM) plus methamphetamine (10 microM), WIN 55,212-2 (10 microM), or U-50,488H (10 microM) were tested in water. Arginine, the metabolic precursor to agmatine, was ineffective. Our results identify endogenous agmatine in planarians and demonstrate that agmatine exposure blocks withdrawal to three different drugs in planarians. This suggests that a change in agmatine signaling is a common mechanism in the withdrawal caused by these drugs, at least in planarians.", 
    "6": "Olanzapine is a second generation antipsychotic (SGA) with a high level of therapeutic effectiveness in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Along with the positive therapeutic effects, an increase of the body weight frequently occurs. According to the literature, the average weight gain is about 6-7 kg during several months of treatment. This could be valued as a moderate weight increase.", 
    "7": "This article presents a case of a young female with schizophrenia, without clinical improvement with several antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, haloperidol) and with the occurrence of significant neurological side effects. The treatment started with olanzapine (baseline) was associated with good initial response (PANSS reduction 20% in the first two weeks) and the improvement was maintained further on (PANSS reduction 50% after 16 weeks). Significant increase (20 kg, 40%) in weight appeared during the following 16 weeks (BMI at baseline 17.9 kg/m2; BMI 16 weeks later 25.1 kg/m2).", 
    "8": "High effectiveness of olanzapine in schizophrenia symptoms reduction was accompanied by a significant weight gain. However, this drug leads to impaired glucoregulation, dyslipidaemia etc. It also increases the risk of diabetes and cardio-vascular diseases, i.e. the main causes of mortality in schizophrenia after a suicide. Therefore, clinicians are suggested to focus on possible predictors of weight gain during olanzapine therapy, and act accordingly in order to prevent serious health consequences.", 
    "9": "P-glycoprotein expressed in Pichia pastoris was used to study the drug binding sites of different benzodiazepines. The effect of bromazepam, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam and flurazepam on P-glycoprotein structure was investigated by measuring the intrinsic fluorescence of the transporter tryptophan residues. Purified mouse mdr1a transporter in mixed micelles of 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid and 1,2-dimiristoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphocholine emitted fluorescence at 340 nm indicative of the fluorophores in a relatively apolar environment. Acrylamide and iodide ion were used as collisional quenchers toward distinct regions of the transporter, the protein and the interface protein-surface, respectively. Binding of ATP induced conformational changes at the protein surface level in accordance with the location of the nucleotide binding sites. Bromazepam interaction with the transporter was located at the protein-surface interface, diazepam at the membrane region and chlordiazepoxide at the protein surface. Only the flurazepam interaction site was not detected by the quenchers used. All benzodiazepines were able to elicit reorientation of the protein fluorophores on the P-glycoprotein-ATP complex.",

Furthermore, we measured cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 and -3 activation in this paradigm.", 
    "12": "The human glioblastoma cell lines, U87MG, A172 and U118MG express the MPTP-associated TSPO, voltage-dependent anion channel and adenine nucleotide transporter. Indeed, ErPC3-induced apoptosis was inhibited by the MPTP blocker cyclosporin A and by PK 11195 and Ro5 4864 in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, PK 11195 and Ro5 4864 inhibited collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, and caspase-9 and -3 activation caused by ErPC3 treatment.", 
    "13": "This study shows that PK 11195 and Ro5 4864 inhibit the pro-apoptotic function of ErPC3 by blocking its capacity to cause a collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, the TSPO may serve to open the MPTP in response to anti-cancer drugs such as ErPC3.", 
    "14": "The novel positive allosteric modulator NS11394 [3'-[5-(1-hydroxy-1-methyl-ethyl)-benzoimidazol-1-yl]-biphenyl-2-carbonitrile] possesses a functional selectivity profile at GABA(A) receptors of alpha(5) > alpha(3) > alpha(2) > alpha(1) based on oocyte electrophysiology with human GABA(A) receptors. Compared with other subtype-selective ligands, NS11394 is unique in having superior efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha(3) receptors while maintaining low efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha(1) receptors. NS11394 has an excellent pharmacokinetic profile, which correlates with pharmacodynamic endpoints (CNS receptor occupancy), yielding a high level of confidence in deriving in vivo conclusions anchored to an in vitro selectivity profile and allowing for translation to higher species. Specifically, we show that NS11394 is potent and highly effective in rodent anxiety models. The anxiolytic efficacy of NS11394 is most probably mediated through its high efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha(3) receptors, although a contributory role of GABA(A)-alpha(2) receptors cannot be excluded. Compared with benzodiazepines, NS11394 has a significantly reduced side effect profile in rat (sedation, ataxia, and ethanol interaction) and mouse (sedation), even at full CNS receptor occupancy. We attribute this benign side effect profile to very low efficacy of NS11394 at GABA(A)-alpha(1) receptors and an overall partial agonist profile across receptor subtypes. However, NS11394 impairs memory in both rats and mice, which is possibly attributable to its efficacy at GABA(A)-alpha(5) receptors, albeit activity at this receptor might be relevant to its antinociceptive effects (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 327:doi;10.1124/jpet.108.144, 2008). In conclusion, NS11394 has a unique subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor profile and represents an excellent pharmacological tool to further our understanding on the relative contributions of GABA(A) receptor subtypes in various therapeutic areas.", 
    "15": "Spinal administration of GABA(A) receptor modulators, such as the benzodiazepine drug diazepam, partially alleviates neuropathic hypersensitivity that manifests as spontaneous pain, allodynia, and hyperalgesia. However, benzodiazepines are hindered by sedative impairments and other side effect issues occurring mainly as a consequence of binding to GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha(1) subunit. Here, we report on the novel subtype-selective GABA(A) receptor-positive modulator NS11394 [3'-[5-(1-hydroxy-1-methyl-ethyl)-benzoimidazol-1-yl]-biphenyl-2-carbonitrile], which possesses a functional efficacy selectivity profile of alpha(5) > alpha(3) > alpha(2) > alpha(1) at GABA(A) alpha subunit-containing receptors. Oral administration of NS11394 (1-30 mg/kg) to rats attenuated spontaneous nociceptive behaviors in response to hindpaw injection of formalin and capsaicin, effects that were blocked by the benzodiazepine site antagonist flumazenil. Ongoing inflammatory nociception, observed as hindpaw weight-bearing deficits after Freund's adjuvant injection, was also completely reversed by NS11394. Likewise, hindpaw mechanical allodynia was fully reversed by NS11394 in two rat models of peripheral neuropathic pain. Importantly, NS11394-mediated antinociception occurred at doses 20 to 40-fold lower than those inducing minor sedative or ataxic impairments. In contrast, putative antinociception associated with administration of either diazepam, zolpidem, or gaboxadol only occurred at doses producing intolerable side effects, whereas bretazenil was completely inactive despite minor influences on motoric function. In electrophysiological studies, NS11394 selectively attenuated spinal nociceptive reflexes and C-fiber-mediated wind-up in vitro pointing to involvement of a spinal site of action. The robust therapeutic window seen with NS11394 in animals suggests that compounds with this in vitro selectivity profile could have potential benefit in clinical treatment of pain in humans.", 
    "16": "The stable conformations of GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor bivalent ligands were determined by low temperature NMR spectroscopy and confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis. The stable conformations in solution correlated well with those in the solid state. The linear conformation was important for these dimers to access the binding site and exhibit potent in vitro affinity and was illustrated for alpha5 subtype selective ligands. Bivalent ligands with an oxygen-containing linker folded back upon themselves both in solution and the solid state. Dimers which are folded do not bind to Bz receptors.", 
    "17": "Decreased muscarinic M1 receptor (CHRM1) mRNA has been reported in Brodmann's area (BA) 6 from subjects with schizophrenia. We have extended this study by measuring levels of CHRM1 ([(3)H]pirenzepine binding), CHRM3 ([(3)H]4-DAMP binding), the transcription factor SP1 and the CHRM1 downstream target beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in BA 6 from 19 subjects with schizophrenia and 19 control subjects. Radioligand binding was quantified using either in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography or, in cohorts of 10 control subjects and 10 subjects with schizophrenia, membrane enriched fraction (MEF) CNS ([(3)H]pirenzepine binding only). Levels of SP1 and BACE1 were measured by Western blotting. [(3)H]pirenzepine binding to tissue sections was in two layers, binding to tissue sections (Binding layer 1: p<0.01; Binding layer 2: p<0.001) and MEF (p<0.05) were decreased in schizophrenia. Levels of [(3)H]4-DAMP binding, SP1 and BACE1 were not altered in subjects with the disorder. This study shows a decrease in levels of CHRM1 in BA 6 from subjects with schizophrenia; as CHRM1 and BA 6 are important in maintaining normal cognitive function, these data support the hypothesis that decreased levels of cortical CHRM1 may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Our findings on BACE1 suggest that the schizophrenia phenotype reported in BACE(-/-) mice is not simply due to lack of that protein in the cortex.",

[(11)C]DAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106 are two promising radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of PBR. This study was designed to develop a new radiolabeled analog of [(11)C]DAA1106 and [(18)F]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]FEDAA1106, for PET imaging of PBR expression in brain and cancer. Precursor N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-hydroxybenzyl)acetamide (9) was synthesized in multiple steps with moderate to high chemical yields. Precursor 9 was labeled by [(11)C]CH(3)OTf and isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification to provide target radioligand N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-5-[(11)C]methoxybenzyl)acetamide ([(11)C]FEDAA1106, [(11)C]10) in 60-70% radiochemical yields, decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB), based on [(11)C]CO(2).

We intended to explore the effect of TSPO ligands, PK 11195 and Ro5-4864 on apoptosis in a rat model of cortical injury. Sprague-Dawley rats received a daily intraperitoneal injection of dimethylsulfoxide (vehicle), PK 11195, or Ro5-4864, starting 2 days prior the injury and a third injection after the injury. At 6 weeks, immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Ro5-4864 resulted in a significant increase in the number of surviving neurons and in the density of the neurofilament network in the perilesional cortex in comparison with animals of the vehicle and PK 11195 groups. In tissue samples dissected from the injured area, Ro5-4864 caused a significant reduction in activation of caspases 3 and 9 but not of caspase 8 in comparison with the vehicle and PK 11195 groups. In addition, measurements of transmembrane mitochondrial potential of mitochondria (Deltapsi(M)) isolated from normal rat brain showed that loss of Deltapsi(M) induced by recombinant Bax could be significantly reduced by Ro5-4864 in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that the neuroprotective effect shown by Ro5-4864 in the present model of brain injury involves the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis modulation of mPTP.", 
    "20": "The present study was performed to examine whether or not rebound insomnia is caused by an abrupt withdrawal of benzodiazepine hypnotics and tandospirone in rats. Etizolam and triazolam caused a significant shortening of sleep latency, increase in non-REM sleep time, and decrease in wake time in a dose-dependent manner. Etizolam and triazolam caused a significant shortening of sleep latency during drug administration (for 7 days), whereas a significant prolongation of sleep latency was observed by the abrupt withdrawal of these drugs. Tandospirone caused a shortening of sleep latency, whereas no effect was observed on non-REM sleep time and wake time during drug administration (for 7 days). On the other hand, tandospirone showed no significant effect on sleep latency through its abrupt withdrawal, differing from etizolam and triazolam. From these findings, a rebound phenomenon in terms of sleep latency was confirmed with etizolam and triazolam in rats. Furthermore, the 5-HT(1A) agonist, tandospirone, caused no rebound phenomenon regarding sleep latency in rats.", 
    "21": "Benzodiazepines in intravenous sedation are useful, owing to their outstanding amnesic effect when used for oral surgery as well as dental treatments on patients with intellectual disability or dental phobia. However, compared with propofol, the effect of benzodiazepine lasts longer and may impede discharge, especially when it is administered orally because of fear of injections. Although flumazenil antagonizes the effects of benzodiazepine quickly, its effect on the equilibrium function (EF) has never been tested. Since EF is more objective than other tests, the purpose of this study is to assess the sedation level and EF using a computerized static posturographic platform. The collection of control values was followed by the injection of 0.075 mg/kg of midazolam. Thirty minutes later, 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg of flumazenil was administered, and the sedation level and EF were measured until 150 minutes after flumazenil administration. Flumazenil antagonized sedation, and there was no apparent resedation; however, it failed to antagonize the disturbance in EF. This finding may be due to differences in the difficulty of assessing the sedation level and performing the EF test, and a greater amount of flumazenil may effectively antagonize the disturbance in EF.",

Clozapine treatment for suicidality in schizophrenia. Archive of General Psychiatry 60, 82-91]. The primary goal of this analysis was to determine if the ISST and CDS ratings indicated that the raters, an unblinded (UP) and a blinded psychiatrist (BP) using the ISST, and a blinded rater using the CDS, were able to identify those patients who had a Type 1 event. The ratings of patients adjudged to have experienced a Type 1 event (Group 1) were compared with patients who did not (Group 2). The ISST and the CDS ratings obtained 2-8 weeks prior to a Type 1 event (Pre-1) and Pre-2, the rating immediately prior to Pre-1, obtained 2-12 weeks before Pre-1, were analyzed to test the hypothesis that the difference between Pre-2 and Pre-1 ratings for the Group 1 patients was significantly greater than the difference in the comparable ratings for Group 2 patients. The prediction that patients with Type 1 events would show greater worsening in ISST and CDS ratings between Pre-2 and Pre-1 than the Group 2 patients was confirmed. However, the sensitivity and specificity of a worsening in ratings was not sufficient to provide definitive warning of an impending Type 1 event. Other characteristics of the patients with Type 1 events provide additional warning: e.g. overall higher ratings on these scales, slower improvement in suicidality during treatment, and previous number of suicide attempts. These results indicate that the ISST and CDS may provide some additional information that can assist clinical decision making regarding suicidal risk in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.", 
    "27": "Current challenges in drug designing and lead optimization has reached a bottle neck where the main onus lies on rigorous validation to afford robust and predictive models. In the present study, we have suggested that predictive structure-activity relationship (SAR) models based on robust statistical analyses can serve as effective screening tools for large volume of compounds present either in chemical databases or in virtual libraries. 3D descriptors derived from the similarity-based alignment of molecules with respect to group center overlap from each individual template point and other \"alignment averaged,\" but significant descriptors (ClogP, molar refractivity, connolly accessible area) were used to generate QSAR models. The results indicated that the artificial neural network method (r(2) = 0.902) proved to be superior to the multiple linear regression method (r(2) = 0.810). Cross validation of the models with an external set was reasonably satisfactory. Screening PubChem compound database based on the models obtained, yielded 14 newer modified compounds belonging to the TIBO class of inhibitors, as well as, two novel scaffolds, with enhanced binding efficacy as hits. These hits may be targeted toward potent lead-optimization and help in designing and synthesizing new compounds with potential therapeutic utility.",

    "32": "Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) causes neurotoxicity related to an irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Management of this intoxication includes: (i) pretreatment with reversible blockers of AChE, (ii) blockade of muscarinic receptors with atropine, and (iii) facilitation of GABA(A) receptor signal transduction by benzodiazepines. The major disadvantage associated with this treatment combination is that it must to be repeated frequently and, in some cases, protractedly. Also, the use of diazepam (DZP) and congeners includes unwanted side effects, including sedation, amnesia, cardiorespiratory depression, and anticonvulsive tolerance. To avoid these treatment complications but safely protect against DFP-induced seizures and other CNS toxicity, we adopted the strategy of administering mice with (i) small doses of huperzine A (HUP), a reversible and long-lasting (half-life approximately 5 h) inhibitor of AChE, and (ii) imidazenil (IMI), a potent positive allosteric modulator of GABA action selective for alpha(5)-containing GABA(A) receptors. Coadministration of HUP (50 microg/kg s.c., 15 min before DFP) with IMI (2 mg/kg s.c., 30 min before DFP) prevents DFP-induced convulsions and the associated neuronal damage and mortality, allowing complete recovery within 18-24 h. In HUP-pretreated mice, the ED(50) of IMI to block DFP-induced mortality is approximately 10 times lower than that of DZP and is devoid of sedation. Our data show that a combination of HUP with IMI is a prophylactic, potent, and safe therapeutic strategy to overcome DFP toxicity.",

    "39": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a medetomidine-midazolam combination on some neurohormonal and metabolic variables in healthy cats. Five cats were used repeatedly in each of 5 groups, which were injected intramuscularly with physiological saline solution (control), 0.5 mg/kg of midazolam, 40 microg/kg of medetomidine, 80 microg/kg of medetomidine, and 40 microg/kg of medetomidine plus 0.5 mg/kg of midazolam. Blood samples were taken 10 times over 24 h from a catheter introduced into the jugular vein. Plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), norepinephrine, and epinephrine were determined. In addition, the duration of lateral recumbency, rectal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate were examined. The combination of medetomidine and midazolam enhanced the duration of lateral recumbency and reduced the hyperglycemia induced by medetomidine alone. Recovery from hypoinsulinemia induced by the medetomidine-midazolam combination tended to be more rapid than when the same dose of medetomidine was used alone. The decrease in plasma norepinephrine levels induced by medetomidine alone was diminished by the addition of midazolam. Midazolam alone did not significantly change the plasma glucose, insulin, glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, or NEFA concentration, but increased the norepinephrine concentration. This study revealed that the combination of medetomidine and midazolam produces minimal neurohormonal and metabolic changes when compared with medetomidine alone in cats.",

However, the incidence of activation syndrome has not been fully investigated and little has been reported on its predictors. The aim of this study was to survey the incidence of activation syndrome and clarify its predictors in a natural clinical setting.", 
    "41": "Among 2,521 new outpatients visiting between August 2003 and March 2005, we retrospectively surveyed the case records of 729 patients who had not taken any antidepressants during the 1 month before presentation and were prescribed antidepressants for 3 months after the initial visit. Patients were classified as developing activation syndrome if they experienced any symptom of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania during the first 3 months.", 
    "42": "Of the 729 patients, 31 (4.3%) developed activation syndrome. The incidence was not significantly related to gender, age, class of antidepressant, combined use of benzodiazepine, or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis except for personality disorder. Diagnosis of personality disorder was significantly associated with the induction of activation syndrome (odds ratio=4.20, P=0.002).",

    "44": "The aim of our study was to detect changes in the distribution of electrical brain activity in schizophrenic patients who were antipsychotic naive and those who received treatment with clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone. We included 41 subjects with schizophrenia (antipsychotic naive = 11; clozapine = 8; olanzapine = 10; risperidone = 12) and 20 healthy controls. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was computed from 19-channel electroencephalography for the frequency bands delta, theta, alpha-1, alpha-2, beta-1, beta-2 and beta-3. We compared antipsychotic-naive subjects with healthy controls and medicated patients. (1) Comparing antipsychotic-naive subjects and controls we found a general increase in the slow delta and theta frequencies over the fronto-temporo-occipital cortex, particularly in the temporolimbic structures, an increase in alpha-1 and alpha-2 in the temporal cortex and an increase in beta-1 and beta-2 in the temporo-occipital and posterior limbic structures. (2) Comparing patients who received clozapine and those who were antipsychotic naive, we found an increase in delta and theta frequencies in the anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex, and a decrease in alpha-1 and beta-2 in the occipital structures. (3) Comparing patients taking olanzapine with those who were antipsychotic naive, there was an increase in theta frequencies in the anterior cingulum, a decrease in alpha-1, beta-2 and beta-3 in the occipital cortex and posterior limbic structures, and a decrease in beta-3 in the frontotemporal cortex and anterior cingulum. (4) In patients taking risperidone, we found no significant changes from those who were antipsychotic naive. Our results in antipsychotic-naive patients are in agreement with existing functional findings. Changes in those taking clozapine and olanzapine versus those who were antipsychotic naive suggest a compensatory mechanism in the neurobiological substrate for schizophrenia. The lack of difference in risperidone patients versus antipsychotic-naive subjects may relate to risperidone's different pharmacodynamic mechanism.",

    "46": "A 30-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted to the general medical unit because of altered mental status and agitation. He was initially treated for alcohol withdrawal with benzodiazepines; his condition then deteriorated and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Because of the patient's poor response to benzodiazepines (oxazepam and lorazepam, with midazolam the last one used), intravenous dexmedetomidine was started at an initial dose of 0.2 microg/kg/h and titrated to 0.7 microg/kg/h to the patient's comfort. Midazolam was subsequently tapered to discontinuation due to excessive sedation. In the intensive care unit, the patient's symptoms remained controlled with use of dexmedetomidine alone. He remained in the intensive care unit for 40 hours; dexmedetomidine was then tapered to discontinuation and the patient was transferred back to the general medical unit on oral oxazepam and thiamine, which had been started in the emergency department. He was discharged after 5 days.", 
    "47": "A review of the PubMed database (1989-2007) failed to identify any other instances of dexmedetomidine having been used as the principal agent to treat alcohol withdrawal. The use of sedative to treat delirium tremens is well documented, with benzodiazepines being the agents of choice. The clinical utility of benzodiazepines is limited by their stimulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors, an effect not shared by dexmedetomidine, a central alpha(2)-receptor agonist that induces a state of cooperative sedation and does not suppress respiratory drive.", 
    "48": "In patients with delirium tremens, dexmedetomidine should be considered as an option for primary treatment. This case illustrates the need for further studies to investigate other potential uses for dexmedetomidine.", 
    "49": "Stiff-person (stiff-man) syndrome is characterised by symptoms of muscular rigidity and spasms, which are generally of an axial nature. Involuntary contractions of the agonist and antagonist muscles caused by activity of the motor units during rest are the main clinical and electrophysiological marker of the disease. The nature of the syndrome is considered to be autoimmune, with positive glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies in most patients. These antibodies exert an influence over GABAergic transmission.", 
    "50": "A 29-year-old female who was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of psychogenic mutism. While in hospital the patient developed a clinical picture consisting in generalised stiffness that was predominantly axial and proximal with hyperreflexia in the four limbs and strong contraction of the muscles of the abdomen. The most striking lab finding was the presence of anti-GAD, anti-parietal cells, anti-microsomal/TPO and antithyroglobulin antibodies, together with oligoclonal immunoglobulin G bands in the cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment was established with benzodiazepines, antispastic agents and corticosteroids, and the clinical symptoms progressively improved until they had partially remitted at two months. The lab findings and clinical features are compatible with stiff-person syndrome in a patient with associated psychiatric comorbidity.", 
    "51": "Anti-GAD antibodies are not exclusive to stiff-person syndrome and can also be found in a number of other autoimmune disorders. Other mechanisms which can also produce a dysfunction of the GABAergic system have also been suggested. The syndrome can be difficult to diagnose from the clinical point of view and it must therefore be borne in mind in patients who begin with unexplainable stiffness and spasms because it is a potentially treatable pathology.", 
    "52": "The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term weight gain associated with clozapine, olanzapine, and risperidone treatment and its clinical risk factors in children and adolescents. At four child and adolescent psychiatric departments, the weight and body mass index of initially hospitalized patients (aged 9.0-21.3 years) treated with clozapine (n = 15), olanzapine (n = 8), and risperidone (n = 10) were prospectively monitored for 45 weeks. Clinical risk factors (age, gender, baseline weight, dosage, drug-naivety) were tested for their association with weight gain in the three groups. All three groups experienced significant weight gain between baseline and endpoint. The absolute and percentage average weight gains were significantly higher for the olanzapine group (16.2 +/- 8.8 kg; 30.1 +/- 18.9%) than for the clozapine (9.5 +/- 10.4 kg; 14.8 +/- 15.8%) and the risperidone (7.2 +/- 5.3 kg; 11.5 +/- 6.0%) groups. Olanzapine is associated with extreme long-term weight gain in children and adolescents that, in addition, is much higher than that expected in adults. Clozapine and risperidone are associated with a less marked weight gain in children and adolescents but also much higher than that expected in adults. These differences may affect compliance with medication and health risk.", 
    "53": "We performed a systematic review of controlled trials on anxiety disorders treatment (generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and post-traumatic stress disorder) published from 1980 to 2006, and identified trials comparing the efficacy of benzodiazepines (BZD) with that of antidepressants, in particular comparisons between BZD and newer antidepressants. Among 969 publications, 274 double-blind randomized controlled studies remained after using our exclusion criteria. These studies comprised altogether 439 comparisons. There were in total 23 comparisons of antidepressants versus BZD. Among these, 22 compared the efficacy of older antidepressants versus BZD, whereas only 1 concerned the comparison of a newer antidepressant versus BZD. It showed comparable efficacy between venlafaxine and diazepam in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. Our study shows that the major change of prescribing pattern from BZD to newer antidepressants in anxiety disorders has occurred in absence of comparative data of high level of proof.",

This association was not explained by the use of benzodiazepines. Indexes of sleep fragmentation were also associated with an increased risk of falls. For example, women with poor sleep efficiency (<70% of time in bed spent sleeping) had 1.36-fold increased odds of falling compared with others (odds ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.74).",

    "60": "The physical sedative effects assessed by the critical flicker test continued for 1 h (t values of 5 min, 30 min and 60 min later: 4.35, 5.00 and 3.19, respectively) and those by the moving radial area of a postural sway test continued for 3 h (t values of 5 h, 30 h, 60 min and 3 h later: -4.05, -3.42, -2.17 and -2.58, respectively), which changed significantly compared with the baseline level before infusion (P<0.05). On the other hand, the mental sedative effects by the VAS method improved within 1 h. The CYP2C19 genotype-dependent differences in the postinfusion sedative effects were not observed in any of the four psychomotor function tests.", 
    "61": "With the psychomotor tests, the objective sedative effects of diazepam continued for 1 h to 3 h irrespective of CYP2C19 genotype status and the subjective sedative symptoms improved within 1 h. Up to 3 h of clinical care appears to be required after the infusion of diazepam, although patients feel subjectively improved.", 
    "62": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency that requires prompt diagnosis and treatment, as delay is associated with a higher likelihood of poor response to treatment and worse outcome. Lorazepam has been well established as a first-line therapy. Subsequent steps are less established, and there are many reasonable options, including intravenous fosphenytoin, valproate, midazolam, propofol, and phenobarbital. If intravenous access is not immediately available, rectal diazepam or nasal or buccal midazolam should be given; this can also be used as out-of-hospital treatment to prevent or treat SE. For refractory SE, continuous intravenous midazolam and propofol, separately or in combination, are rapidly effective, with pentobarbital remaining the gold standard for prolonged cases. If a patient does not awaken after treatment, urgent electroencephalogram (EEG) should be obtained to rule out nonconvulsive seizure activity. In refractory SE, continuous EEG monitoring is required to recognize recurrence of seizure activity, as most seizures will be nonconvulsive.", 
    "63": "Recently, second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have been widely used in the treatment of mood disorders. However, the mechanisms of the antidepressant effect of SGAs remain unclear. We proposed that Golf protein, a stimulant alpha-subunit of G protein coupled with the dopamine D1 receptor, might a play the key role in the antidepressive effect of antidepressants. To clarify the relationship between Golf protein and the antidepressive effects of antipsychotics, we examined the effects of chronic treatment with several antipsychotics on the level of Golf protein in the rat striatum.", 
    "64": "Male Wistar rats were treated with one of several antipsychotics for 2 weeks: olanzapine (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg), sulpiride (5, 10, or 50 mg/kg), amisulpride (3, 10, or 20 mg/kg), risperidone (0.2 or 2 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.3 or 3 mg/kg), or clozapine (2 or 10 mg/kg).", 
    "65": "Olanzapine (5 mg/kg), sulpiride (5, or 10 mg/kg), and amisulpride (10 mg/kg) treatments significantly increased the level of Golf protein, but there was no increase with administration of higher doses of these three antipsychotics. Risperidone, haloperidol, and clozapine treatment did not change the level of Golf protein at any dose. In this study, all antipsychotics that have antidepressive effects increased Golf protein. This suggests that an increase in Golf may play an important role in the antidepressive effect of antipsychotics.",

In this review, we present ethnobotanical information on plants used by the traditional healers in South Africa to treat mental illnesses, specifically epilepsy, depression, age-related dementia and debilitative mental disorders. Details of the recent scientific studies conducted on some of these plants are reviewed. Extracts of Searsia chirindensis, Cotelydon orbiculata and Leonotis leonurus have shown in vivo anticonvulsant activity. Extracts from Searsia dentata and Searsia pyroides showed spontaneous epileptiform discharge in mouse cortical slices, and acted as NMDA-receptor antagonists. Apigenin, amentoflavone and agathisflavone with affinity to the benzodiazepine site on the GABA(A)-receptor were isolated from Searsia pyroides. Naringenin with affinity to the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor was isolated from Mentha aquatica. Agapanthus campanulatus, Boophone disticha, Mondia whitei and Xysmalobium undulatum exhibited antidepressant-like activity in three in vivo models for depression. Amaryllidaceae alkaloids with activity to the serotonin transporter were isolated from Boophone disticha. The alkaloid mesembrine, which act as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, was isolated from Sceletium tortuosum. Investigations of plants used to treat age-related dementia and debilitative mental disorders lead to the isolation of a number of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids with acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity from Boophone disticha and Crinum species. Extracts of Mentha aquatica, Gasteria croucheri, Ruta graveolens and Scotia brachypetala inhibited MAO-B. Naringenin was isolated from Mentha aquatica as a MAO inhibitor. Only a small number of the more than 300 southern African plant species reported to treat or affect the CNS have been scientifically evaluated. Very few of the active compounds have been isolated and identified.", 
    "68": "Testosterone (T) and its metabolites may underlie some beneficial effects for anxiety and cognition, but the mechanisms for these effects are unclear. T is reduced to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which can be converted to 5alpha-androstane,3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol) and/or 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-diol). Additionally, T can be converted to androstenedione, and then to androsterone. These metabolites bind with varying affinity to androgen receptors (ARs; T and DHT), estrogen receptors (ERbeta; 3alpha-diol, 3beta-diol), or GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptors (GBRs; 3alpha-diol, androsterone). Three experiments were performed to investigate the hypothesis that reduced anxiety-like and enhanced cognitive performance may be due in part to actions of T metabolites at ERbeta. Experiment 1: Gonadectomized (GDX) wildtype and ERbeta knockout mice (betaERKO) were subcutaneously (SC) administered 3alpha-diol, 3beta-diol, androsterone, or oil vehicle at weekly intervals, and tested in anxiety tasks (open field, elevated plus maze, light-dark transition) or for cognitive performance in the object recognition task. Experiment 2: GDX rats were administered SC 3alpha-diol, 3beta-diol, androsterone, or oil vehicle, and tested in the same tasks. Experiment 3: GDX rats were androsterone- or vehicle-primed and administered an antagonist of ARs (flutamide), ERs (tamoxifen), or GBRs (flumazenil), or vehicle and then tested in the elevated plus maze. Both rats and wildtype mice, but not betaERKO mice, consistently had reduced anxiety and improved performance in the object recognition task. Androsterone was only effective at reducing anxiety-like behavior in the elevated plus maze and this effect was modestly reduced by flumazenil administration. Thus, actions at ERbeta may be required for T's anxiety-reducing and cognitive-enhancing effects.",

    "91": "This study investigates the effects of Uliveto, a bicarbonate-alkaline mineral water, in experimental models of diarrhea, constipation and colitis. Rats were allowed to drink Uliveto or oligomineral water (control) for 30 days. Diarrhea and constipation were evoked by 16,16-dimethyl-prostaglandin E(2) (dmPGE(2)) or loperamide, respectively. Colitis was induced by 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (DNBS) or acetic acid. Gastric emptying, small-intestinal and colonic transit were evaluated. dmPGE(2)-induced diarrhea reduced gastric emptying and increased small-intestinal and colonic transit. In this setting, Uliveto water enhanced gastric emptying, and this effect was prevented by L-365,260 (gastrin receptor antagonist). Loperamide-induced constipation reduced gastric emptying, small-intestinal and colonic transit, and these effects were prevented by Uliveto water. L-365,260 counteracted the effects of Uliveto on gastric emptying, while alosetron (serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist) blunted the effect of Uliveto on colonic transit. Gastric emptying, small-intestinal and colonic transit were reduced in DNBS-induced colitis, and Uliveto water enhanced gastric emptying and normalized small-intestinal and colonic transit. Gastric emptying, small-intestinal and colonic transit were also reduced in acetic acid-induced colitis, and Uliveto increased both gastric emptying and small-intestinal transit. In conclusion, Uliveto water exerts beneficial effects on gastrointestinal motility in the presence of bowel motor dysfunctions. The effects of Uliveto water on gastric emptying depend on gastrin-mediated mechanisms, whereas the activation of serotonergic pathways accounts for the modulation of colonic functions.",

    "94": "After randomization, patients were premedicated 1 h before surgery with either i.v. midazolam 0.02 or 0.06 mg kg(-1) depending on their age and gender group. Levels of anxiety and sedation, heart rate, respiratory rate (RR), mean blood pressure (MBP), and oxygen saturation (Sp(O2)) were measured before and 15 min after midazolam administration.", 
    "95": "A higher level of preoperative anxiety was more often observed in women than in men, and in young than in older patients. The female or younger patients showed significant anxiolytic benefits from midazolam. A deeper sedation level was found in men compared with women. Forty-two of 45 patients (93.3%) with excessive sedation received midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1). The elderly patients receiving midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1) showed significant reductions in MBP, RR, and Sp(O2). Of the patients with an Sp(O2)<90%, 72.7% had received midazolam 0.06 mg kg(-1).", 
    "96": "Age and gender differences in neuropsychological and physiological responses after midazolam premedication were evident. Midazolam is effective for producing sedation and anxiolysis at a dose of 0.02 mg kg(-1), with minimal effects on cardiorespiration and oxygen saturation to patients. Dosage adjustments based on these covariates are, therefore, necessary.", 
    "97": "A new 96-well disk solid phase extraction sample preparation technique which does not involve vacuum pumps integrated with liquid chromatographic tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) was developed for high throughput determination of benzodiazepines (nordiazepam, diazepam, lorazepam and oxazepam). In addition, the method completely allows the re-use of the SPE disk membranes for subsequent analyses after re-conditioning. The method utilizes a robotic autosampler for parallel extractions in a 96-well plate format. Results have been presented for independent extractions from three matrices; phosphate buffer solution, urine, and plasma. Factors affecting data reproducibility, extraction kinetics, sample throughput, and reliability of the system were investigated and optimized. A total time required per sample was 0.94 min using 96-well format. Method reproducibility was < or =9% relative standard deviation for all three matrices. Limits of detection and quantitation recorded were respectively in the range 0.02-0.15 and 0.2-2.0 ng/mL with linearity ranging from 0.2 to 500 ng/mL for all matrices.", 
    "98": "Several psychiatric disorders are often precipitated or exacerbated by exposure to stressors. FG7142 (N-methyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxamide), a partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptors, mimics the physiological (an increased release in the adrenal steroid hormone) and neurochemical (an enhanced neurotransmission of monoamines) changes induced by stressful stimuli. We examined the effects of FG7142 and immobilization stress on the gene expression of the mouse neocortex in order to obtain a new insight into the molecular stress-responsive system. The effect of FG7142 (20 mg/kg, i.p.) on the gene expression of the brain area was examined using a DNA microarray method. The genes showing a significant change in expression were investigated in further experiments using the quantitative RT-PCR method. There was an increase in the mRNA of seven genes in the neocortex of mice 1h after treatment with FG7142. In addition, there was an increase in the mRNAs of five of the seven genes (Fos, Cyr61, Btg2, Adamts1, and Gem) in the neocortex of mice exposed to the stress for 1h. The up-regulation of these five genes by both FG7142 and immobilization stress indicates that these genes may be involved in the stress-responsive system. Dysfunctions of the system may be associated with the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders.", 
    "99": "We have demonstrated that the main metabolite of clozapine, N-desmethylclozapine, has a significant role in the ability of clozapine to improve some aspects of cognition in schizophrenia. Furthermore, there is also evidence to suggest that it is the muscarinic M(1) receptor agonist effect of N-desmethylclozapine that underlies its cognitive effects. In the present study we examined the efficacy of two muscarinic receptor agonists xanomeline and sabcomeline to increase the efflux of acetylcholine and dopamine in rat medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Microdialysis in awake, freely moving rats was used to demonstrate that xanomeline at 10, but not 1 or 3 mg/kg (s.c.), significantly increased acetylcholine efflux in both the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens. Sabcomeline, at 1 but not 0.1 or 0.5 mg/kg (s.c.), significantly increased acetylcholine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex but not the nucleus accumbens. Both xanomeline and sabcomeline dose-dependently increased dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex but only high dose of xanomeline (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and sabcomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) increased that in the nucleus accumbens. The acetylcholine and dopamine efflux induced by xamomeline (10 mg/kg, s.c.) and sabcomeline (1 mg/kg, s.c.) were significantly blocked by the preferential muscarinic M(1) receptor antagonist telenzepine (3 mg/kg, s.c.), but significantly potentiated by the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), which does not have much affinity for muscarinic receptor(s). According to the analysis of net-AUC (area under the curve) values of acetylcholine and dopamine levels, the rank order of ability of these drugs to increase acetylcholine or dopamine levels is sabcomeline>xanomeline approximately AC260584>N-desmethylclozapine. The present study suggests that the binding potency of muscarinic M(1) receptors is greatly related to their ability to increase cortical acetylcholine and dopamine efflux, and that this may have some relevance for treatment of the cognitive deficit of schizophrenia.",

    "101": "Comorbidity of psychiatric disorder and substance use disorder (SUD) is very common. Clinical experience says that comorbidity increases inpatient length of stay. We aimed to discover which factors affect length of stay for inpatients at a psychiatric department in a specialized mental hospital in a Greek urban area, and specifically whether SUD is one of them. All patients admitted over a 12-month period were given the CAGE questionnaire and that part of the EUROPASI questionnaire dealing with substance use. This was followed by a diagnostic interview to establish the final diagnosis in accordance with the DSM-IV criteria. Following this, the patients' characteristics in conjunction with their average length of stay were all evaluated statistically. A total of 313 patients were assessed. Present substance use disorder was identified in 102 individuals (32.6%). The principal substances involved in addiction or abuse were alcohol, cannabis, benzodiazepines, and opiates. Patients differed as to their cooperation with the medication regime. On the other hand, there was no statistical difference regarding the number of hospitalisations. Psychopathology was not found to play a direct role, as no one diagnosis correlated with length of stay. The factors found to affect length of stay in this psychiatric department were the length of time they had been mentally ill and cooperation in taking medication. It appears that SUD is not one of the factors affecting length of stay.", 
    "102": "Status epilepticus (SE) treatment ranges from small benzodiazepine doses to coma induction. For some SE subgroups, it is unclear how the risk of an aggressive therapeutic approach balances with outcome improvement. We recently developed a prognostic score (Status Epilepticus Severity Score, STESS), relying on four outcome predictors (age, history of seizures, seizure type and extent of consciousness impairment), determined before treatment institution. Our aim was to assess whether the score might have a role in the treatment strategy choice.", 
    "103": "This cohort study involved adult patients in three centers. For each patient, the STESS was calculated before primary outcome assessment: survival vs. death at discharge. Its ability to predict survival was estimated through the negative predictive value for mortality (NPV). Stratified odds ratios (OR) for mortality were calculated considering coma induction as exposure; strata were defined by the STESS level.", 
    "104": "In the observed 154 patients, the STESS had an excellent negative predictive value (0.97). A favorable STESS was highly related to survival (P < 0.001), and to return to baseline clinical condition in survivors (P < 0.001). The combined Mantel-Haenszel OR for mortality in patients stratified after coma induction and their STESS was 1.5 (95 % CI: 0.59-3.83).", 
    "105": "The STESS reliably identifies SE patients who will survive. Early aggressive treatment could not be routinely warranted in patients with a favorable STESS, who will almost certainly survive their SE episode.

It is commonly applied in all the paediatric patients undergoing the above mentioned surgery, as the goal of balanced anaesthesia is not only limited to intraoperative period but also good analgesia in post operative period. Many drugs like morphine, Pethidine, Neostigmine etc have been used as analgesic agent via the caudal route but not without their side effects. So Midazolam was used as an alternative drug as it may not be associated with the side effects encountered with the other drugs.",

The patients were allocated randomly into two groups (n=25) to receive caudal injection of either 0.25% Bupivacaine 1 ml/kg (group A) or Midazolam 50 microg/kg with normal saline 1 ml/kg (group B). In the post operative period heart rate, blood pressure, pain score, recovery to first analgesic time, total number of analgesics required in 24 hours and side effects if any were noted and analysed.",

Recovery to first analgesic time though was longer in the Bupivacaine group (9.65 hr) than Midazolam group (7.32 hr); it was statistically not significant (P= 0.9). Any of the side effects such as motor weakness, urinary retention, and respiratory depression were not observed in both the groups. However in both the groups, few of the patients had post operative vomiting.",

The significance of P450s to drug disposition has led to the identification of selective chemical and antibody inhibitors for individual P450 enzymes. Despite these advances, the maximal inhibition attainable is limited by the use of inhibitor concentrations that maintain selectivity for the individual P450s. Thus, most commercially available inhibitors produce a maximal inhibition of approximately 80%.

Gender and two age groups were, respectively, compared in these characteristics. Data for demographic characteristics, substance use and health functioning were collected by a structured interview, using the Addiction Severity Index. A total sample of 125 individuals (30 women and 95 men) was interviewed shortly after arrival to the inpatient treatment. Differences between genders were found in drinking patterns, where men had earlier onset of first drink, earlier onset of problematic alcohol consumption and longer duration of problematic consumption. No differences between genders were found regarding somatic and psychiatric health. When comparing the two age groups (29-47 years and 49-69 years), the younger individuals had more lifetime and current psychiatric symptoms (including depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation etc.), whereas the older individuals had more chronic somatic disorders. The younger individuals had also an earlier onset of first drink of alcohol and had started a problematic consumption at earlier ages. They had also more lifetime experience of illicit drugs (including benzodiazepines and analgesics). The findings from the present study indicate that an age-perspective in treatment planning may be of more importance than a gender perspective, where younger individuals probably need more of psychiatric consultation and their older counterparts need more of consultations by medical professionals.",

    "135": "CNS neuronal networks are known to control normal physiological functions, including locomotion and respiration. Neuronal networks also mediate the pathophysiology of many CNS disorders. Stimulation therapies, including localized brain and vagus nerve stimulation, electroshock, and acupuncture, are proposed to activate \"therapeutic\" neuronal networks. These therapeutic networks are dormant prior to stimulatory treatments, but when the dormant networks are activated they compete with pathophysiological neuronal networks, disrupting their function. This competition diminishes the disease symptoms, providing effective therapy for otherwise intractable CNS disorders, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, chronic pain, and depression. Competition between stimulation-activated therapeutic networks and pathophysiological networks is a major mechanism mediating the therapeutic effects of stimulation. This network interaction is hypothesized to involve competition for \"control\" of brain regions that contain high proportions of conditional multireceptive (CMR) neurons. CMR regions, including brainstem reticular formation, amygdala, and cerebral cortex, have extensive connections to numerous brain areas, allowing these regions to participate potentially in many networks. The participation of CMR regions in any network is often variable, depending on the conditions affecting the organism, including vigilance states, drug treatment, and learning. This response variability of CMR neurons is due to the high incidence of excitatory postsynaptic potentials that are below threshold for triggering action potentials. These subthreshold responses can be brought to threshold by blocking inhibition or enhancing excitation via the paradigms used in stimulation therapies. Participation of CMR regions in a network is also strongly affected by pharmacological treatments (convulsant or anesthetic drugs) and stimulus parameters (strength and repetition rate). Many studies indicate that treatment of unanesthetized animals with antagonists (bicuculline or strychnine) of inhibitory neurotransmitter (GABA or glycine) receptors can cause CMR neurons to become consistently responsive to external inputs (e.g., peripheral nerve, sensory, or electrical stimuli in the brain) to which these neurons did not previously respond. Conversely, agents that enhance GABA-mediated inhibition (e.g., barbiturates and benzodiazepines) or antagonize glutamate-mediated excitation (e.g., ketamine) can cause CMR neurons to become unresponsive to inputs to which they responded previously. The responses of CMR neurons exhibit extensive short-term and long-term plasticity, which permits them to participate to a variable degree in many networks. Short-term plasticity subserves termination of disease symptoms, while long-term plasticity in CMR regions subserves symptom prevention. This network interaction hypothesis has value for future research in CNS disease mechanisms and also for identifying therapeutic targets in specific brain networks for more selective stimulation and pharmacological therapies.", 
    "136": "A number of kainate receptor antagonists have shown selectivity for receptors containing the GluK1 subunit. Here, we analyze the effects of these GluK1 antagonists on currents mediated by recombinant homomeric GluK3 and heteromeric GluK2/3 receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells and activated by fast application of glutamate. We show that, amongst these compounds, UBP302, UBP310 and UBP316 effectively block recombinant homomeric GluK3 receptors. However, these antagonists are ineffective in blocking homomeric GluK2 or heteromeric GluK2/3 receptors. In addition, these antagonists do not affect presynaptic kainate receptors at mouse hippocampal mossy fibre synapses, which are thought to be composed of GluK2 and GluK3 subunits. Moreover, the AMPA receptor-selective non-competitive antagonist GYKI 53655 blocks, at high concentrations, GluK3-containing receptors and decreases short-term plasticity at mossy fibre synapses. These results expand the range of targets of kainate receptor antagonists and provide pharmacological tools to study the elusive mechanisms of neurotransmitter control by presynaptic kainate receptors.", 
    "137": "Status epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency, characterized by continuous or intermittent seizures without full recovery of consciousness between seizures, which can result in death or neurological sequelae. In about one third of patients, SE is unresponsive to sequential treatment with first- and second-line antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). At least in part, this drug resistance may be due to AED target alterations induced by SE, such as reduced membrane expression of GABA(A) receptors. Apart from target alterations by receptor trafficking, SE is known to increase the brain expression of drug efflux transporters such as P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which might reduce concentrations of AEDs at their brain targets. However, it is not known whether overexpression of Pgp develops rapidly enough after onset of SE to be of any functional consequence for drug treatment. Therefore, we studied whether overexpression of Pgp at the blood-brain barrier is involved in refractory SE. Two rat SE models were used, the lithium/pilocarpine model and induction of SE by sustained electrical stimulation of the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Four AEDs, diazepam (DZP), phenobarbital (PB) and phenytoin (PHT) or fosphenytoin (FPHT) were administered at different times after onset of SE. In the pilocarpine model, once self-sustained SE was established, none of the AEDs alone was effective in terminating SE, but sequential injection of PB and DZP stopped SE. Administration of the Pgp inhibitor tariquidar did not prevent or counteract resistance to AEDs. In the BLA model, DZP and PB terminated SE in the majority of rats, whereas PHT or FPHT were ineffective. Immunohistochemical staining of Pgp did not indicate any increase of Pgp expression in brain capillary endothelial cells during SE, whereas significant overexpression was determined in both models 48 h after SE. The data suggest that, at least under the conditions of the present study, alterations in Pgp are not critically involved in refractory SE.", 
    "138": "Comparative quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies have been carried out on tetrahydroimidazo[4,5,1-jk][1,4]benzodiazepine (TIBO) derivatives as reverse transcriptase inhibitors (n=70) using topological, structural, physicochemical, electronic and spatial descriptors. The data set was divided into training and test sets using a cluster-based method. Linear models were developed using multiple regression (with stepwise regression, factor analysis and genetic function approximation (GFA) as variable selection tools) and partial least squares (PLS) and combination of factor analysis and partial least squares (FA-PLS). Genetic function approximation (spline) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were used for the development of non-linear models. Using topological and structural descriptors, the best equation was obtained from GFA (spline) based on internal validation (Q(2)=0.737), but the model with the best external validation characteristics was obtained with FA-PLS (R(pred)(2)=0.707). When structural, physicochemical, electronic and spatial descriptors were used, the best Q(2) (0.740) value was obtained from GFA (spline) whereas PLS provided the best R(pred)(2) (0.784) value. When all descriptors were used in combination, the best R(pred)(2) (0.760) value and the best Q(2) (0.800) value were obtained from ANN and GFA (spline), respectively. The majority of the models satisfied the criteria of external validation recommended by Golbraikh and Tropsha (2002) and the criteria of modified r(2) (r(m)(2)) values of the test set for external validation as suggested by Roy and Roy (2008). In order to further validate selected models, an external set of 10 TIBO derivatives, which fall within the applicability domain of the models and are not shared with the compounds of the present data set, was taken from a different source, and reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity of these compounds was predicted. Acceptable values of squared correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted values of the external set compounds were obtained from the selected models suggesting true predictive potential of the models.", 
    "139": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the plasma pharmacokinetics and brain uptake of a lipophilic benzodiazepine anticonvulsant, diazepam in New Zealand white rabbits and Sprague-Dawley rats to evaluate the possible absorption pathways after intravenous and intranasal administration. The intranasal formulation was prepared by dissolving DZ and 1% sodium glycocholate into microemulsion system composed of 15% ethyl laurate, 25% Labrasol, 37.5% Transcutol P, 12.5% ethanol, and 10% water. Diazepam was administered intravenously (1 mg/kg) or intranasally (2 mg/kg) to rats and rabbits. Drug concentrations in the plasma and six different regions of the brain tissues, i.e., olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, anterior, middle, and posterior segments of cerebrum and cerebellum were analyzed by LC/MS method after solid phase extraction. After i.n. administration, DZ was rapidly absorbed into the systemic circulation, and readily and homogeneously distributed into the different regions of brain tissues with a t(max) of 5 and 10 min in rats and rabbits, respectively. The bioavailability of DZ in rat plasma (68.4%) and brain (67.7%) were 32-47% higher than those observed in rabbit plasma (51.6%) and brain (45.9%). The AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma) ratios in rabbits after i.n. administration (3.77+/-0.17) were slightly lower than from i.v. administration (4.23+/-0.08). However, in rats the AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma) ratios after i.v. (3.03+/-0.07) and i.n. (3.00+/-0.32) administration were nearly identical. The plasma pharmacokinetic and distribution studies in the two animal models clearly showed that lipophilic DZ molecules reached the brain predominantly from the blood by crossing the blood-brain barrier after i.n. administration with no significant direct nose-to-brain transport via olfactory epithelium.",

Drivers of motor vehicles were selected from April 2005 to April 2006 in the south-eastern part of Norway, surrounding, but not including the capital, Oslo. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling procedure was used. In the first stage, random road sites and time intervals were selected, and in the second stage, drivers were stopped by random at those sites and time intervals. Altogether about 12,000 drivers were asked to provide a sample of oral fluid (saliva) and answer a few questions. Samples of oral fluid were obtained from 88% of the drivers, of whom 30% were females and 70% males. The prevalence of each drug was estimated by a weighted average using weights adjusted for under- or over-sampling compared to traffic statistics. Alcohol or drugs were found in oral fluid samples of 4.5% of the drivers; alcohol in 0.4%, psychoactive medicinal drugs in 3.4%, and illegal drugs in 1.0%. Illegal drugs were found more frequently in samples from younger drivers, while psychoactive medicinal drugs were more frequently found in samples from older drivers. Psychoactive medicinal drugs were more prevalent among females than males, among drivers stopped on working days rather than weekends, and among those who reported annual driving distances less than 16,000 km. The drugs found most frequently were zopiclone (1.4%), benzodiazepines (1.4%), codeine (0.8%), tetrahydrocannabinol (0.6%) and amphetamines (0.3%). Two or more drugs were found in 0.6% of the samples, corresponding to 15% of the drug-positive drivers.",

The most frequently used antipsychotic agents were risperidone (n = 50), quetiapine (n = 18), and olanzapine (n = 16). Patients who were prescribed olanzapine or quetiapine had more negative and general symptoms. Using the baseline score as covariate, no significant differences were found in the reductions on any scale in patients treated with risperidone, quetiapine, or olanzapine for 6 months. Weight increase was greater with olanzapine than with risperidone (p = 0.020) or quetiapine (p = 0.040). More neurological side effects appeared with risperidone than with olanzapine (p = 0.022).

The patients were treated in a protocol-guided manner with an ICP-targeted treatment based on the Lund concept. The patients were continuously sedated with midazolam, fentanyl, propofol, or thiopental, or combinations thereof. Five-lead continuous EEG monitoring was performed with the electrodes at F3, F4, P3, P4, and a midline reference. Sensitivity was set at 100 muV per cm and filter settings 0.5-70 Hz.

    "157": "Antidepressant monotherapy is a first-line treatment for depression; however, not all sufferers will adequately respond to treatment. When treating a patient with treatment-resistant depression, the clinician needs to consider all factors which may contribute to an inadequate response to an antidepressant. These include accuracy of diagnosis and medication adherence, as well as the patient's personality, lifestyle, life events and social circumstances. If it is determined that treatment resistance is due to failure of efficacy of antidepressant monotherapy, then an augmentation strategy using an atypical antipsychotic may be considered. Treatment using olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) is one of many options. Four randomized, acute-phase trials have suggested OFC is useful for reducing Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores after inadequate response to antidepressant monotherapy. OFC has been useful at doses of olanzapine/fluoxetine 6/25, 6/50, 12/25 and 12/50 mg/day, with 1/5 mg/day suggested to be an ineffective dose. Treatment with OFC has been associated with some side effects, including weight gain and the metabolic syndrome, somnolence, dry mouth, increased appetite and headache. Treatment decisions therefore need to be made to balance the risks and benefits.", 
    "158": "Cortical GABAergic dysfunction, a hallmark of both schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar (BP) disorder pathophysiologies may relate to the hypermethylation of GABAergic gene promoters (i.e., reelin and GAD67). Benefits elicited by a combination of atypical antipsychotics with valproate (VPA) (a histone deacetylase inhibitor that may also activate brain DNA demethylation) in SZ or BP disorder treatment prompted us to investigate whether the beneficial action of this association depends on induction of a putative DNA demethylase activity. To monitor this activity, we measured the ratio of 5-methyl cytosine to unmethylated cytosine in reelin and GAD67 promoters in the mouse frontal cortex and striatum. We compared normal mice with mice pretreated with l-methionine (5.2 mmol/kg s.c. twice a day for 7 days) to hypermethylate promoters, including reelin and GAD67. Clinically relevant doses of clozapine (CLZ) (3.8 to 15 micromol/kg twice a day s.c. for 3 days) and sulpiride (SULP) (12.5 to 50 micromol/kg twice a day for 3 days) but not clinically relevant doses of haloperidol (HAL) (1.3 to 4 micromol/kg twice a day s.c. for 3 days) or olanzapine (OLZ) (4 to 15 micromol/kg twice a day for 3 days) exhibited dose-related increases in the cortical and striatal demethylation of hypermethylated reelin and GAD67 promoters. These effects of CLZ and SULP were dramatically potentiated by a clinically relevant VPA dose (0.5 mmol/kg twice a day for 3 days). By activating a DNA demethylase, the association of CLZ or SULP with VPA may facilitate a chromatin remodeling that normalizes the GABAergic gene expression down-regulation detected in the telencephalic regions of SZ and BP patients.", 
    "159": "Considerable number of intellectual disabled people experience some form of disruptive behavior. Antipsychotics are the most common treatment for these behaviors. Numerous patients were efficiently treated with thioridazine, recently withdrawn. The authors describe a case series of \"thioridazine responders\" treated with olanzapine. Thirty three patients with severe intellectual disability were recruited. All patients were assessed for seven types of disruptive behavior on five point scale. Patients with severe behavior disturbances were included in treatment. The time points of assessment were at day 0, 30, 60 and 180. Twenty one patient accomplished inclusion criteria. A significant decrease occurred at day 30 for all types of behavior. Total score, self injurious behavior, compulsive and destructive behavior showed further decrease at day 60 and became stable until the end of study. Olanzapine appears to be efficacious in the treatment of disruptive behavior in the intellectually disabled and could be substitute for thioridazine treatment.",

For propofol and unsedated endoscopy, the corresponding figures were 8% and 19% for EGD and 18% and 10% for colonoscopy. No single sedation method accounted for >50% of EGD and colonoscopy cases in 32% and 17% of the countries, respectively.

    "164": "Extracorporeal albumin dialysis (ECAD) enables the elimination of albumin bound substances and is used as artificial liver support system. Albumin binding function for the benzodiazepine binding site specific marker Dansylsarcosine was estimated in plasma samples of 22 patients with cirrhosis and hyperbilirubinaemia (ECAD: n = 12; control: n = 10) during a period of 30 days in a randomized controlled clinical ECAD trial. Albumin Binding Capacity (ABiC) at baseline was reduced to 31.8% (median; range 24%-74%) and correlated to the severity of liver disease. Within two weeks a significant improvement of ABiC and a reduction of the albumin bound markers bilirubin and bile acids were observed in the ECAD group. During single treatments a significant decrease of albumin bound substances (bilirubin and bile acids) as well as an increase in ABiC was observed. In the control group, baseline ABiC was significantly lower in patients who died during study period (34.2% vs. 41.7%; P < 0.028), whereas no significant differences were observed for CHILD, coagulation factors, albumin, bile acids nor bilirubin. At baseline 13 patients had a severely impaired ABiC (<40%), improvement of ABiC was more frequent in the ECAD group (5/6) than in the SMT group (2/7). Reduced albumin binding function is present in decompensated liver failure and is related to severity and 30 day survival. ABiC can be improved by ECAD. The beneficial effect of this treatment may be related to the improvement of albumin binding function more than to the elimination of specific substances. Characterization of albumin function by the ABiC test may help to evaluate different liver support systems and other therapeutic measures.", 
    "165": "Although enhanced appetite and weight gain are potential side effects of treatment with antipsychotic agents, particularly olanzapine and clozapine, the mechanisms underlying these side effects are poorly understood. Leptin and ghrelin were recently identified as hormones that play crucial roles in the regulation of energy balance and glucose metabolism. To elucidate relationships between weight change and plasma levels of ghrelin and leptin, we investigated the circulating ghrelin and leptin levels and body weight during olanzapine treatment. Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia were examined during 6-month administration of olanzapine. Ghrelin, leptin, weight and body mass index (BMI) were measured before and after 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24 weeks of olanzapine treatment. The concentration of glucose and various lipid metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and at 24 weeks. Significant increases in weight, BMI and leptin were observed at week 24. On the other hand, the serum levels of ghrelin decreased significantly after olanzapine treatment. In addition, the level of ghrelin was negatively correlated with the leptin level, BMI and weight. The leptin level was positively correlated with both BMI and weight. Ghrelin is associated with metabolic changes, in combination with leptin, during olanzapine treatment. However, further large-scale and longitudinal studies are warranted to elucidate the metabolic changes involving ghrelin, leptin and insulin during treatment with antipsychotics.",

Nausea, dizziness and hallucinations were observed with both treatments, but dizziness was significantly more frequent with Entonox (p = 0.048). Clinically relevant respiratory depression (O(2) saturation <90%) occurred in 19% of patients in the midazolam arm; sedation was reversed with flumazenil.",

    "170": "A marked heterogeneity exists among stressors in their ability to reinstate alcohol seeking in rats. We have reported that the pharmacological stressor yohimbine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, potently reinstated alcohol seeking, but FG-7142, a benzodiazepine inverse agonist was ineffective. In rats, we determined that yohimbine elicits patterns of brain expression of the mRNAs for c-fos, a marker of neuronal activation, and corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) a stress-related peptide, distinct from that produced by FG-7142. The purpose of the present experiment is to determine if these differential effects of yohimbine and FG-7142 on regional c-fos and CRF mRNA expression generalize to another animal commonly used in alcohol research, the C57 BL/6J mouse. In comparing the results of the present study to those of our previous one, we found a number of commonalities in the patterns of activation elicited by yohimbine and FG-7142 between the two species, and some notable differences. As we found in the rat, yohimbine selectively increased c-fos mRNA in the mouse NACs, BLA and CeA. Yohimbine increased CRF mRNA only in the mouse PVN, but was without effect on CRF mRNA in extrahypothalamic sites, the BNST and CeA. This differs from what we saw in the rat, where yohimbine increased CRF mRNA in these extrahypothalamic regions, but not the PVN. The selective induction of c-fos in the NACs, BLA and CeA of mice and rats by yohimbine offers further support for the idea that activation of these structures participates in reinstatement induced by such stressors.", 
    "171": "Natural defense-inducing stimuli are being increasingly exploited as a means to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying normal and pathological anxiety, as well as for the screening of new compounds with potential therapeutic use in human anxiety disorders. Such an approach, frequently used in rodents, has recently been employed in the Marmoset Predator Confrontation Test (MPCT). In this method, marmoset monkeys are individually confronted with a taxidermized predator (wild oncilla cat) in a previously habituated maze environment, while several easily discernable fear/anxiety-related behaviors are measured. Confrontation with the cat stimulus significantly altered ongoing behaviors, each habituating distinctively during repeated exposures; e.g. complete rapid habituation (alarm call), complete slow habituation (exploration, vigilance) or only partial habituation (proximity avoidance). Pharmacological validating studies with diazepam and buspirone induced a significant dose-dependent reversal of the fear-induced proximic avoidance and scratching/scent-marking behaviors, while exploration (smell/lick the maze, leg stand) was found to increase. The neuropeptide substance P and the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 resulted in a similar anxiolytic-like profile. The response pattern observed was not influenced by social isolation, handling/manual restraint, novel environment exposure or habituation to the stimulus or its location. Persistent defensive behavior and response pattern to diazepam was observed when naive versus MPCT-experienced marmosets were tested following a recent predatory stress. Taken together, the results indicate that the MPCT is a valuable experimental procedure to measure fear and anxiety-related behaviors in nonhuman primates.",

    "173": "We administered the patient clonazepam. After taking clonazepam, the patient fully recovered from the nausea and vomiting and never experienced them again.", 
    "174": "Clonazepam may be useful in the control of CINV. We believe that clonazepam contributed to the favorable outcome by expressing an anxiolytic and an anticonvulsant effect on myoclonus. The efficacy of clonazepam in this indication of prevention of CINV warrants further investigation.", 
    "175": "Traditional behavioral tests, such as the open field test, measure an animal's responsiveness to a novel environment. However, it is generally difficult to assess whether the behavioral response obtained from these tests relates to the expression level of motor activity and/or to avoidance of anxiogenic areas. Here, an automated home cage environment for mice was designed to obtain independent measures of motor activity levels and of sheltered feeding preference during three consecutive days. Chronic treatment with the anxiolytic drug chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg/day) in C57BL/6J mice reduced sheltered feeding preference without altering motor activity levels. Furthermore, two distinct chromosome substitution strains, derived from C57BL/6J (host strain) and A/J (donor strain) inbred strains, expressed either increased sheltering preference in females (chromosome 15) or reduced motor activity levels in females and males (chromosome 1) when compared to C57BL/6J. Longitudinal behavioral monitoring revealed that these phenotypic differences maintained after adaptation to the home cage. Thus, by using new automated behavioral phenotyping approaches, behavior can be dissociated into distinct behavioral domains (e.g., anxiety-related and motor activity domains) with different underlying genetic origin and pharmacological responsiveness.", 
    "176": "Novel N,N-disubstituted indol-3-ylglyoxylamides (1-56), bearing different combinations of substituents R 1-R 5, were synthesized and evaluated as ligands of the translocator protein (TSPO), the 18 kDa protein representing the minimal functional unit of the \"peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor\" (PBR). Most of the new compounds showed a nanomolar/subnanomolar affinity for TSPO and stimulated steroid biosynthesis in rat C6 glioma cells with a potency similar to or higher than that of classic TSPO ligands such as PK 11195. Moreover, when evaluated in vivo by means of the elevated-plus-maze (EPM) paradigm in the rat, compound 32, the best-performing derivative in terms of TSPO affinity and pregnenolone production, showed clear anxiolytic effects. The results of this study suggested that the novel N,N-disubstituted indol-3-ylglyoxylamides may represent a promising class of compounds potentially suited for the treatment of anxiety disorders.", 
    "177": "We report a case of de novo absence status associated with focal discharge and polydipsia-induced hyponatremia. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is classified as absence status or complex partial status. Absence status is characterized by bilateral synchronized spike and wave complex bursts and a variety of conscious disturbances. Possible precipitating factors for NCSE include benzodiazepine withdrawal, excessive use of psychotropic drugs, and electrolyte imbalances. Hyponatremia is a rare precipitating factor. In this case, the patient was 59 years old and had suffered from primary insomnia but had no history of epilepsy. NCSE improved by means of saline infusion. However after recovery from NCSE EEG revealed some spikes in the left frontal area. Absence seizures can also show generalized spike and slow waves, and cases of focal lesion-associated absence seizures have been reported. Although absence seizures and absence status are two distinct conditions, they should not be considered together. We assumed that hyponatremia induced by polydipsia precipitated epileptogenicity in the left frontal area, and then focal activity secondarily generalized and resulted in absence status.",

A conditional logistic regression model was fitted to identify variables associated with the risk of fall related severe fracture.", 
    "180": "Low body mass index, cognitive impairment, stroke and lack of urine control were associated with increased risk of severe fall related fractures. Benzodiazepines and muscle relaxants were also related to an increased risk of severe fractures while moderate use of alcohol was associated with reduced risk.", 
    "181": "Although the association between benzodiazepines and fractures due to fall has been consistently demonstrated for old people, this has not been the case for muscle relaxant drugs. The decision to prescribe muscle relaxants for elderly people should take into account the risk of severe fracture associated with these drugs.",

    "183": "The GABA(A) receptor density was quantified by conducting a [(11)C]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) study according to the full saturation method, in which each animal received a single injection of FMZ to fully saturate the GABA(A) receptors. Subsequently, the concentration-time curves of FMZ in blood [using high-pressure liquid chromatography with UV detector (HPLC-UV) or high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS)] and brain (with PET-scanning) were analyzed by population modeling using a pharmacokinetic model, containing expressions to describe the time course of FMZ in blood and brain.", 
    "184": "The GABA(A) receptor density (B(max)) in kindled rats was decreased by 36% compared with controls. This is consistent with a reduction of 28% in electroencephalography (EEG) effect of midazolam in the same animal model, suggesting that a reduced number of GABA(A) receptors underlies the decreased efficacy of midazolam. Furthermore, receptor affinity (K(D)) was not changed, but the total volume of distribution in the brain (V(Br)), is increased to 178% of control after kindling, which might indicate an alteration in the transport of FMZ across the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "185": "Both the GABA(A) receptor density (B(max)), and possibly also the blood-brain barrier transport of FMZ (V(Br)) are altered after kindling. Furthermore, this study indicates the feasibility of conducting PET studies for quantifying moderate changes in GABA(A) receptor density in a rat model of epilepsy in vivo.",

After the triazolam in urine was extracted with ether at pH 9, the analysis was performed on an HP-5 capillary column with gas chromatograph-micro electron capture detector (GC-muECD). The calibration curve of triazolam showed good linearity in the range of 0.2 - 50 ng/mL with the correlation coefficient of 0.999 5. The inter-day relative standard deviation (RSD) and intra-day RSD were 4.17% and 5.31%, respectively. The average recovery was 93.9%.

    "187": "Checkpoints are present in all phases of the cell cycle and are regarded as the gatekeepers maintaining the integrity of the genome. Many conventional agents used to treat cancer impart damage to the genome and activate cell cycle checkpoints. Many tumors are defective in the tumor suppressor p53 and therefore lack a functional G(1) checkpoint. In these tumors, however, the S-G(2) checkpoints remain intact and, in response to DNA damage, arrest cell cycle progression allowing time for DNA repair. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is a key element in the DNA damage response pathway and plays a crucial role in the S-G(2)-phase checkpoints. Inhibiting Chk1 represents a therapeutic strategy for creating a \"synthetic lethal\" response by overriding the last checkpoint defense of tumor cells against the lethal damage induced by DNA-directed chemotherapeutic agents. Chk1 inhibition is consistent with emerging targeted therapies aiming to exploit molecular differences between normal and cancer cells. Adding a Chk1 inhibitor to DNA-damaging cytotoxic therapy selectively targets tumors with intrinsic checkpoint defects while minimizing toxicity in checkpoint-competent normal cells. PF-00477736 was identified as a potent, selective ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor that inhibits Chk1 with a K(i) of 0.49 nM. PF-00477736 abrogates cell cycle arrest induced by DNA damage and enhances cytotoxicity of clinically important chemotherapeutic agents, including gemcitabine and carboplatin. In xenografts, PF-00477736 enhanced the antitumor activity of gemcitabine in a dose-dependent manner. PF-00477736 combinations were well tolerated with no exacerbation of side effects commonly associated with cytotoxic agents."
