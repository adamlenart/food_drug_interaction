Clinical and non-clinical studies found contradictory results for valerian extracts and single constituents regarding the influence on sleep parameters. It was the aim of this study to investigate the sedative effects of a valerian root extract. Therefore, locomotor activity and core body temperature were recorded in male mice using radiotelemetry. A 70 % ethanolic extract prepared from the roots of V. officinalis (s. l.) and some of its single constituents, valerenic acid, linarin, and apigenin, were tested for effects on locomotion and body temperature over 180 minutes after oral administration. The extract was tested in a dose range of 250-1000 mg/kg, and only a dose of 1000 mg/kg valerian extract showed a mild short-term sedative effect with reduced locomotor activity between 66-78 min minutes after administration. Paradoxically, an increased activity was observed after 150 minutes after gavage. A dose of 1 mg/kg valerenic acid produced an intermittent stimulation of activity. However, a mild short-term sedative effect was found for linarin at 12 mg/kg and apigenin at 1.5 mg/kg. Considering the cumulative locomotor activity over the observation period of 180 min, it is concluded that neither the extract nor one of the compounds had considerable sedative effects. More precisely, the observed short-term changes in activity pattern indicate that valerian extract as well as the flavonoids linarin and apigenin are rather effective to reduce sleep latency than to act as a sleep-maintaining agent.", 
    "1": "Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB, \"liquid ecstasy\") and its legal prodrugs gamma-butyrolactone and 1,4-butanediol are gaining importance as recreational drugs in Germany. Because of the wide availability of GHB and its prodrugs physicians are increasingly being confronted with cases of intoxication. The effect of GHB intoxication is comparable with those of alcohol and/or benzodiazepines. Likewise, symptoms of withdrawal may occur. In this review, we summarise current data regarding the history, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the drug as well as the relevant symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal as they pertain to neurology and psychiatry.", 
    "2": "Remimazolam (CNS-7056) is a short-acting GABA(A) receptor agonist, under development by PAION, in collaboration with Japanese licensee Ono Pharmaceutical, as an intravenous sedative agent for potential use in day-case procedures, and the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. A member of the benzodiazapene class of drugs, the structure of remimazolam was modified to produce a drug that displays organ-independent metabolism. The incorporation of a carboxylic ester moiety into the benzodiazapene core of remimazolam renders it susceptible to non-specific tissue esterases and it is rapidly metabolized into its pharmacologically inactive metabolite CNS-7054. Preclinical studies in sheep demonstrated that remimazolam produced a more rapid onset of action, and a shorter duration of action, compared with midazolam. In a phase IIa clinical trial evaluating remimazolam as a procedural sedative for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in patients, the time to recovery from sedation was shorter and more consistent with remimazolam, relative to midazolam. Because of its organ-independent metabolism and rapid and predictable onset and recovery, remimazolam appears to have potential advantages over other currently available short-acting sedatives.",

We report the feasibility of a new patient position and long-axis nerve scan with ultrasound (US) for controlling perineural catheter placement for continuous mid-femoral sciatic nerve block in a pediatric case. We think that long-axis view of the sciatic nerve with US during placement of perineural catheters in a child is an effective technique.",

    "8": "Status epilepticus is a common neurological emergency in childhood and associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Status epilepticus (SE) has been defined as continuous seizure activity lasting more than 30 min or 2 or more seizures in this duration without gaining consciousness between them. However, the operational definition has brought the time down to 5 min. Management can be broadly divided into initial stabilization, seizure termination, and evaluation and treatment of the underlying cause. Diagnostic evaluation and seizure control should be achieved simultaneously to improve outcome. Seizure termination is achieved by pharmacotherapy. Benzodiazepines are the first line drugs for SE. Commonly used drugs include lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam. In children without an IV access, buccal or nasal midazolam or rectal diazepam can be used. Phenytoin as a second line agent is usually indicated when seizure is not controlled after one or more doses of benzodiazepines. If the seizures continue to persist, valproate, phenobarbitone or levetiracetam is indicated. Midazolam infusion is useful in refractory status epilepticus. Thiopentone, propofol or high dose phenobarbitone are considered for treatment of refractory status epilepticus. Prolonged SE is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Long term neurological sequelae include epilepsy, behavioural problems, cognitive decline, and focal neurologic deficits.", 
    "9": "Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a reversible, predominantly posterior, leukoencephalopathy associated with renal insufficiency, hypertension, or immunosuppressant drugs. We describe two children with PRES whose primary diagnoses were idiopathic nephrotic syndrome and lupus nephritis. Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging at the onset of PRES showed strong hyperintense signals on diffusion-weighted imaging with restricted apparent diffusion coefficient values predominantly in the posterior region. Such findings have been rarely reported in children with PRES and initially suggested irreversible brain damage; however, both children fully recovered clinically as well as radiologically. Our findings suggest the limitations of cranial MR imaging for diagnosing PRES. Further experience with cranial MR imaging, including diffusion-weighted imaging with apparent diffusion coefficient mapping, is required to improve diagnostic accuracy and the ability to predict outcomes in patients with early-stage PRES. At present, initial imaging studies do not necessarily provide sufficient evidence for a firm diagnosis of PRES or the prediction of outcomes.",

Personality structure is similar in the two sexes, but women have better prognosis, even if they present psychiatric disorders. A notable characteristic of women's prognosis is their better adherence to group therapies. Women diagnosed with severe alcohol dependence who need inpatient treatment for detoxification are usually younger and have higher rates of benzodiazepine abuse and personality disorders than men, but are also more collaborative, and benefit more from therapy. Female benzodiazepine abusers show lower rates of neurocognitive impairment than men. Alcoholic women with severe organic conditions that require inpatient treatment usually have a medical record with more unsuccessful treatment attempts for alcohol dependence than men, and their prognosis is equally unfavourable.",

Future research for improving knowledge of such mechanisms, which are related to emotional factors such as guilt, depression and anxiety, and traditionally considered as problematic, may indicate that they actually increase motivation to change.", 
    "15": "In this study we assessed differences in new and repeat prescriptions of psycho-tropics between patients receiving prescriptions for drugs to treat a common chronic disease and people without such prescriptions. The study used the databases of two Dutch health insurance companies (3 million people). We selected all Dutch men and women aged 45 and older who were registered for six consecutive years (1999-2004). Our analyses both found a consistent relation between psycho-tropics on the one hand and physical illness on the other. People with multi-morbidity were prescribed these drugs most often, especially men and those younger than 65. Epidemiological studies showed a prevalence of depression among people with multi-morbidity to be twice as high as among people without such conditions. According to recent guidelines non-drug treatment may be the first therapy option for patients with non severe depression. If prescribed for a long time, benzodiazepine prescriptions are especially known to be addictive. Our data raise the question to what extent patients with a chronic physical disease suffering from co-occurring mental problems are prescribed psycho-tropics in accord with the guidelines that also advise mental support in case of non severe mental problems. Further research can answer this important question.",

    "21": "Translocator protein (TSPO), also referred to as peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is a crucial 18-kDa outer mitochondrial membrane protein involved in numerous cellular functions, including the regulation of cholesterol metabolism, steroidogenesis, and apoptosis. Elevated expression of TSPO in oncology correlates with disease progression and poor survival, suggesting that molecular probes capable of assaying TSPO levels may have potential as cancer imaging biomarkers. In preclinical PET studies, we characterized a high-affinity aryloxyanilide-based TSPO imaging ligand, 18F-N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline (18F-PBR06), as a candidate probe for the quantitative assessment of TSPO expression in glioma.", 
    "22": "Glioma-bearing rats were imaged with 18F-PBR06 in a small-animal PET system. Dynamic images were acquired simultaneously on injection of 18F-PBR06 (70-100 MBq/0.2 mL). Over the course of scanning, arterial blood was collected to derive the input function, with high-performance liquid chromatography radiometabolite analysis performed on selected samples for arterial input function correction. Compartmental modeling of the PET data was performed using the corrected arterial input function. Specific tumor cell binding of PBR06 was evaluated by radioligand displacement of 3H-PK 11195 with PBR06 in vitro and by displacement of 18F-PBR06 with excess PBR06 in vivo. Immediately after imaging, tumor tissue and adjacent healthy brain were harvested for assay of TSPO protein levels by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry.", 
    "23": "18F-PBR06 was found to preferentially accumulate in tumors, with modest uptake in the contralateral brain, facilitating excellent contrast between tumor and adjacent tissue. Infusion with PBR06 (10 mg/kg) displaced 18F-PBR06 binding by approximately 75%. The accumulation of 18F-PBR06 in tumor tissues and adjacent brain agreed with the ex vivo assay of TSPO protein levels by Western blotting and quantitative immunohistochemistry.", 
    "24": "These preclinical studies illustrate that 18F-PBR06 is a promising tracer for visualization of TSPO-expressing tumors. Importantly, the close correlation between 18F-PBR06 uptake and TSPO expression in tumors and normal tissues, coupled with the high degree of displaceable binding from both tumors and the normal brain, represents a significant improvement over other TSPO imaging ligands previously evaluated in glioma. These data suggest the potential of 18F-PBR06 to elucidate the role of TSPO in oncology, as well as its potential development as a cancer imaging biomarker.", 
    "25": "Several studies investigating the interaction of honey and drug-metabolizing enzymes showed controversial results, with some suggesting that honey induces CYP3A-mediated metabolism in mammals and humans. This clinical trial was conducted to determine the effect of repeated honey administration on human CYP3A enzyme activity using midazolam as a marker substance. In a randomized, single-blind, parallel-group study, 20 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either honey (2 \u00d7 20 g/d) or artificial honey (2 \u00d7 20 g/d) over a period of 10 days. To determine intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity, oral (4 mg) and intravenous (2 mg) midazolam was administered in a semi-simultaneous way before honey administration, after the last honey administration, and 1 and 6 days thereafter. At baseline after oral midazolam, the partial metabolic clearance was similar in both groups (honey: 917.8 \u00b1 234.6 mL/min vs artificial honey: 973.5 \u00b1 373.8 mL/min). Ten days of honey administration did not change partial metabolic clearance (honey: 1016 \u00b1 268 mL/min vs artificial honey: 1043 \u00b1 450 mL/min), which was also true 1 and 6 days later. Neither honey nor artificial honey in amounts usually consumed affected the intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activity in healthy volunteers.", 
    "26": "The role of the amygdala in the mediation of fear and anxiety has been extensively investigated. However, how the amygdala functions during the organization of the anxiety-like behaviors generated in the elevated plus maze (EPM) is still under investigation. The basolateral (BLA) and the central (CeA) nuclei are the main input and output stations of the amygdala. In the present study, we ethopharmacologically analyzed the behavior of rats subjected to the EPM and the tissue content of the monoamines dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) and their metabolites in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsal hippocampus (DH), and dorsal striatum (DS) of animals injected with saline or midazolam (20 and 30 nmol/0.2 \u00b5L) into the BLA or CeA. Injections of midazolam into the CeA, but not BLA, caused clear anxiolytic-like effects in the EPM. These treatments did not cause significant changes in 5-HT or DA contents in the NAc, DH, or DS of animals tested in the EPM. The data suggest that the anxiolytic-like effects of midazolam in the EPM also appear to rely on GABA-benzodiazepine mechanisms in the CeA, but not BLA, and do not appear to depend on 5-HT and DA mechanisms prevalent in limbic structures.", 
    "27": "The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) and the receptors tropomyosin-related kinase B (trkB) and p75(NTR) are present in the nerve terminals on the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) of the levator auris longus muscle of the adult mouse. Exogenously added BDNF or NT-4 increased evoked ACh release after 3 h. This presynaptic effect (the size of the spontaneous potentials is not affected) is specific because it is not produced by neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and is prevented by preincubation with trkB-IgG chimera or by pharmacological block of trkB [K-252a (C\u2082\u2087H\u2082\u2081N\u2083O\u2085)] or p75(NTR) [Pep5 (C\u2088\u2086H\u2081\u2081\u2081N\u2082\u2085O\u2081\u2089S\u2082] signaling. The effect of BDNF depends on the M\u2081 and M\u2082 muscarinic acetylcholine autoreceptors (mAChRs) because it is prevented by atropine, pirenzepine and methoctramine. We found that K-252a incubation reduces ACh release (~50%) in a short time (1 h), but the p75(NTR) signaling inhibitor Pep5 does not have this effect. The specificity of the K-252a blocking effect on trkB was confirmed with the anti-trkB antibody 47/trkB, which reduces evoked ACh release, like K-252a, whereas the nonpermeant tyrosine kinase blocker K-252b does not. Neither does incubation with the fusion protein trkB-IgG (to chelate endogenous BDNF/NT-4), anti-BDNF or anti-NT-4 change ACh release. Thus, the trkB receptor normally seems to be coupled to ACh release when there is no short-term local effect of neurotrophins at the NMJ. The normal function of the mAChR mechanism is a permissive prerequisite for the trkB pathway to couple to ACh release. Reciprocally, the normal function of trkB modulates M\u2081- and M\u2082-subtype muscarinic pathways.", 
    "28": "Liver tumors from a previous National Toxicology Program study were examined using global gene expression and mutation analysis to define the mechanisms of carcinogenesis in mice exposed to oxazepam. Five hepatocellular adenomas and 5 hepatocellular carcinomas from male B6C3F1 mice exposed to 5000 ppm oxazepam and 6 histologically normal liver samples from control animals were examined. One of the major findings in the study was upregulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Genes that activate \u03b2-catenin, such as Sox4, were upregulated, whereas genes that inhibit Wnt signaling, such as APC and Crebbp, were downregulated. In addition, liver tumors from oxazepam-exposed mice displayed \u03b2-catenin mutations and increased protein expression of glutamine synthetase, a downstream target in the Wnt signaling pathway. Another important finding in this study was the altered expression of oxidative stress-related genes, specifically increased expression of cytochrome p450 genes, including Cyp1a2 and Cyp2b10, and decreased expression of genes that protect against oxidative stress, such as Sod2 and Cat. Increased oxidative stress was confirmed by measuring isoprostane expression using mass spectrometry. Furthermore, global gene expression identified altered expression of genes that are associated with epigenetic mechanisms of cancer. There was decreased expression of genes that are hypermethylated in human liver cancer, including tumor suppressors APC and Pten. Oxazepam-induced tumors also exhibited decreased expression of genes involved in DNA methylation (Crebbp, Dnmt3b) and histone modification (Sirt1). These data suggest that formation of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in oxazepam-exposed mice involves alteration of the Wnt signaling pathway, oxidative stress, and potential epigenetic alterations.", 
    "29": "Sleep complaints and disorders are frequent in geriatric patients, with a prevalence of 57%. They result in increased morbidity and mortality. In this population, the primary goal is to search for a cause of secondary insomnia, such as organic or psychiatric diseases, or medications. In those cases, sleep will improve with the treatment of the cause. In the cases of primary insomnia, behavioral and sleep hygiene therapy are essential. Hypnotics have frequent side effects and should be avoided when possible. Prescription of small doses of benzodiazepines or related drugs should only be for a short period of time. Molecules with a short half life are to be preferred. Other sleep disorders include sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movements, which are the most frequent diagnoses in an elderly population. In the restless legs syndrome, diagnostic workup must include the search for a cause and treatment should favor hygienic measures. The use of dopamine agonists must be cautious, as their tolerance is poor in the elderly. Periodic limb movements are also frequent but there is no particular therapeutic recommendation.", 
    "30": "The objective of this study was to evaluate weight gain and its potential risk factors among different second generation antipsychotics (SGAs). The study was conducted for Korean inpatients with schizophrenia in a university hospital in Seoul, between Jan 2000 and Dec 2007. Data were collected by reviewing the medical records of the patients, who were prescribed to one of the SGAs among aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine or risperidone. The changes of weight and body mass index (BMI); risk of clinically significant weight gain (>7% gain to initial weight) and their associations with various clinical characteristics of such patients were analyzed. Five hundred and eighty-eight (588) and 294 subjects treated with one of the four SGAs for a duration of 1 month and 2 months were included, respectively. Olanzapine showed significantly greater weight and BMI increase at month 1 (p=0.028 for weight; p=0.019 for BMI) and month 2 (p=0.032 for weight; p=0.029 for BMI) than others. Females showed greater BMI increase change (0.70\u00b10.91 kg/m(2), p=0.008) and were also more likely to experience clinically significant weight gain (odd ratio=1.846, 95% CI=1.098 to 3.105, p=0.021) at month 1. Younger patients (<45 years old) had significantly greater weight and BMI increase at both months 1 and 2. Younger patients also showed greater risk for clinically significant weight gain at month 2 (odd odd ratio=2.567, 95% CI=1.196 to 5.508, p=0.016). Low baseline BMI (<25 kg/m(2)) was associated with greater weight gain at month 1 (1.92\u00b12.29 kg, p<0.001) and month 2 (4.07\u00b13.56 kg, p<0.001) and BMI increase at month 1 and month 2 (p<0.001 for both). Patients with low baseline BMI showed higher risk of clinically significant weight gain at both months 1 and 2 (p<0.001 for both). Olanzapine was shown to have higher metabolic risk than other SGAs in inpatients with schizophrenia. The individual's own clinical characteristics also exerted influence on weight gain effects of SGAs. Younger patients with lower baseline BMI were under greater risk of antipsychotic-induced weight gain. More studies are required to verify the role of gender on weight gain.",

An intramuscular (IM) autoinjector DZ formulation may offer a practical alternative to rectal DZ. This single-center, open-label, 3-treatment, 3-period crossover study compared the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of 10mg DZ administered rectally in 24 healthy, fasted and fed subjects versus IM autoinjector delivery in fasted subjects. Blood samples were collected at baseline and for up to 24h postdose and plasma DZ concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. There were no significant differences between plasma concentrations for rectal administration of DZ in fasted and fed subjects at any time point. Intramuscular DZ administration resulted in more rapid and less variable drug absorption than rectal delivery. At 30min postdose and at all subsequent evaluations, IM administration resulted in significantly higher areas under the curve versus rectal administration in fasted subjects (p<0.05). This significant difference was sustained throughout the remainder of the 24-h study period (p<0.05). All reported adverse events were considered mild, and none required treatment.",

    "46": "In this review, the current evidence is examined regarding neuropharmacologic treatment for children and adolescents (under the age of 18 years) who sustained a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Although the focus is on the pediatric TBI population, there is a paucity of empirical data related to the role of medication with children and adolescents after brain injury. Therefore, findings from the adult TBI literature are incorporated where appropriate so as to identify potential agents that warrant further examination in pediatric populations. This review addresses specific sequelae of TBI from the earliest stages of neurologic recovery to long-term comorbidities, including disorders of impaired consciousness, post-TBI agitation, cognitive decline, and post-TBI depression. The evidence regarding the role of medication in neuroprotection and neurorecovery in this population is also explored. Medication classes reviewed include excitatory amino acids, antagonists to the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, dopamine agonists, benzodiazepines, \u03b2-blockers, anticonvulsants, and antidepressants. It is hoped that this review will guide future research, and ideas as to how this may be accomplished within a pediatric population are suggested.",

Endogenous cannabinoids (i.e., endocannabinoids; eCBs), such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), are produced throughout the limbic system and other brain regions associated with emotionality and are believed to modulate behavioral responses to stress-related conditions. AEA and 2-AG are rapidly metabolized by the respective enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Accordingly, inhibition of each enzyme increases brain levels of the appropriate eCB. Although FAAH inhibition has been established to decrease anxiety-like behavior, the role of 2-AG has been difficult to ascertain until the recent synthesis of JZL184, a potent and selective MAGL inhibitor. In the present study, we investigated the effects of inhibiting FAAH or MAGL on anxiety-like behavior in marble burying, a model of repetitive, compulsive behaviors germane to anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder. The FAAH inhibitor PF-3845, the MAGL inhibitor JZL184, and the benzodiazepine diazepam decreased marble burying at doses that did not affect locomotor activity. In contrast, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary psychoactive constituent of marijuana, did not consistently reduce marble burying without also eliciting profound decreases in locomotor behavior. The CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonist rimonabant blocked the reduction in marble burying caused by FAAH and MAGL inhibitors, but not by diazepam, indicating a CB1 receptor mechanism of action. These data indicate that elevation of AEA or 2-AG reduces marble burying behavior and suggest that their catabolic enzymes represent potential targets for the development of new classes of pharmacotherapeutics to treat anxiety-related disorders.", 
    "48": "Diminished GABAergic and glycinergic inhibition in the spinal dorsal horn contributes significantly to chronic pain of different origins. Accordingly, pharmacological facilitation of GABAergic inhibition by spinal benzodiazepines (BDZs) has been shown to reverse pathological pain in animals as well as in human patients. Previous studies in GABA(A) receptor point-mutated mice have demonstrated that the spinal anti-hyperalgesic effect of classical BDZs is mainly mediated by GABA(A) receptors containing the \u03b12 subunit (\u03b12-GABA(A) receptors), while \u03b11-GABA(A) receptors, which mediate the sedative effects, do not contribute. Here, we investigated the potential analgesic profile of HZ166, a new partial BDZ-site agonist with preferential activity at \u03b12- and \u03b13-GABA(A) receptors. HZ166 showed a dose-dependent anti-hyperalgesic effect in mouse models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain, triggered by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve and by subcutaneous injection of the yeast extract zymosan A, respectively. This antihyperalgesic activity was antagonized by flumazenil and hence mediated via the BDZ-binding site of GABA(A) receptors. A central site of action of HZ166 was consistent with its pharmacokinetics in the CNS. When non-sedative doses of HZ166 and gabapentin, a drug widely used in the clinical management of neuropathic pain, were compared, the efficacies of both drugs against CCI-induced pain were similar. At doses producing already maximal antihyperalgesia, HZ166 was devoid of sedation and motor impairment, and showed no loss of analgesic activity during a 9-day chronic treatment period (i.e. no tolerance development). These findings provide further evidence that compounds selective for \u03b12- and \u03b13-GABA(A) receptors might constitute a novel class of analgesics suitable for the treatment of chronic pain.", 
    "49": "The Z-drugs, zaleplon, zopiclone and zolpidem, are short-acting hypnotics which act at the same receptor as the benzodiazepines, but seemingly without the potential for misuse and the development of dependence of the older benzodiazepines. However, with increased prescribing of Z-drugs, reports of misuse and possible dependence began to appear in the literature, particularly in people with a history of substance misuse and comorbid psychiatric illness. Here we report the case of a woman with a history of chronic zopiclone use and anorexia nervosa, admitted for alcohol detoxification.", 
    "50": "A 31-year old Caucasian British woman with a history of long-term zopiclone use and anorexia nervosa was admitted as an inpatient for a ten-day alcohol detoxification. Her weekly (four days out of seven) intake of alcohol was 180 units and her daily intake of zopiclone, 30 mg. Apart from a short period five years ago, she had been taking zopiclone for 13 years at daily doses of up to 90 mg. She admitted to using 'on top' of her prescribed medication, purchasing extra tablets from friends or receiving them gratis from her partner. After detoxification from alcohol and zopiclone, she was prescribed diazepam which she found ineffectual and voiced her intention of returning to zopiclone on leaving the hospital.", 
    "51": "Zopiclone is generally regarded as safer than benzodiazepines, however, this particular individual, who was using high doses of zopiclone over many years, may provide further evidence of a risk of dependency when this drug is prescribed for substance users with a comorbid psychiatric illness.",

Predictive utility of the static and dynamic model was assessed relative to the inhibitor or victim drug investigated.", 
    "56": "Use of the dynamic and static models resulted in comparable prediction success, with 71 and 77% of DDIs predicted within two-fold, respectively. Over 40% of strong DDIs (>five-fold AUC increase) were under-predicted by both models. Incorporation of the itraconazole metabolite into the dynamic model resulted in increased prediction accuracy of strong DDIs (80% within two-fold). Bias and imprecision in prediction of triazolam DDIs were higher in comparison with midazolam and alprazolam; >50% of triazolam DDIs were under-predicted regardless of the model used. Predicted inter-individual variability in the AUC ratio (coefficient of variation of 45%) was consistent with the observed variability (50%).",

Here we review the most relevant drugs for managing dizziness, vertigo, and nystagmus syndromes. It is important to differentiate symptomatic treatment of nausea and vomiting with, for example, dimenhydrinate and benzodiazepines, and prophylactic treatment of motion sickness with scopolamine from a causal therapy of the underlying disorders. Examples of such causal therapy include aminopyridines for downbeat nystagmus and episodic ataxia type 2; carbamazepine for vestibular paroxysmia, paroxsymal dysarthria and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, and superior oblique myokymia; betahistine, dexamethasone, and gentamicin for Meni\u00e8re's disease; gabapentin and memantine for different forms of acquired and congenital nystagmus; corticosteroids for acute vestibular neuritis and Cogan's syndrome; metoprolol and topiramate for vestibular migraine; and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as paroxetine for phobic postural vertigo.

We found that blockade of the Notch signaling pathway with a pharmacological \u03b3-secretase inhibitor blocked both HSV-2-induced interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) production in CD4(+) T cells, and HSV-2-induced IFN-\u03b1 production in pDC in a dose-dependent fashion. These effects were not due to an overall suppressive capacity of the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, as it affected neither phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced IFN-\u03b3 production in CD4(+) T cells, nor CpG-induced IFN-\u03b1 production in pDC.

    "64": "Stress plays a major role in the process of drug addiction and various stressors are known to increase measures of craving in drug dependent human laboratory subjects. Animal models of stress-induced reinstatement of drug-seeking have also been developed in order to determine the neuropharmacological and neurobiological features of stress-induced relapse. Here, we review experimental approaches that use various pharmacological agents to induce a stress response and subsequent craving or drug-seeking for drugs of abuse. The advantages of such an approach are that the exact same stressor can be used in different species, pharmacological stress activation works on identifiable pathways, and stress levels can be varied via dose dependent manipulations. To date, successful use of such probes in both humans and experimental animals have been achieved with noradrenergic compounds and corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH). Other possible approaches, such as neuroactive peptides related to central stress responses (e.g., vasopressin and substance P) and inverse benzodiazepine agonists show some promise, and we discuss recent experiments using these compounds. Future development and application of pharmacological stressors across species will be useful in assessing stress-induced craving and relapse in both human drug addiction and animal models of relapse. Through this translational approach, novel treatment interventions for addiction may be designed and tested.", 
    "65": "A 35-year-old woman, diagnosed as schizophrenia and treated with olanzapine for nearly 30 months, consulted our department because of severe hyperglycemia. The use of antipsychotics, switching from olanzapine to risperidone, and a one-month introduction of insulin therapy resulted in the decrease of pre-prandial blood glucose levels and the increase of insulin levels (269 to 128 mg/dL, 5.6 to 21.8 \u00b5U/mL). A higher level of insulin resistance as measured by HOMA-IR after the improvement of hyperglycemia (3.6 vs. 6.8) suggested that the long use of olanzapine reduced insulin secretion. Based on this case, impairment of pancreatic \u03b2-cells caused by olanzapine might be reversible.",

In addition, measures of the neuropsychological tests were correlated with regional \u00b9\u00b9C-flumazenil (FMZ) binding potential (BP) reductions to clarify the relationship between cognitive impairment and regional neuronal damage. We performed \u00b9\u00b9C-flumazenil positron emission tomography (FMZ-PET) studies using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) statistical image analysis in eight diffuse axonal injury (DAI) patients (mean age 29.1\u2009\u00b1\u200911.1 years, range 19-46 years). All patients underwent assessment with the Wechsler Adult Intellectual Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III) to evaluate general intelligence. Twenty healthy control subjects (mean age 24.4\u2009\u00b1\u20092.8 years, range 22-30 years) were also studied to obtain a normal database for 3D-SSP. Group comparisons showed significant regional low FMZ uptake in the bilateral medial frontal gyri, the anterior cingulate gyri, and the thalamus. Individual analysis also showed decreased FMZ uptake in these regions; however, the distribution and extent of low FMZ uptake were different in each individual patient. Full-scale IQ (FIQ) and performance IQ (PIQ) negatively correlated with the degree of FMZ BP reduction (BZR index) in the right thalamus. FIQ, verbal IQ (VIQ), and PIQ also negatively correlated with the BZR index in the left medial frontal gyrus. DAI uniformly induced neuronal damage in the medial frontal cortex and the thalamus, which may be related to underlying cognitive impairments in diffuse TBI patients. Future studies to confirm a common area of focal neuronal damage and a direct correlation with neuropsychological testing may validate the use of FMZ-PET for the functional diagnosis of neuropsychological impairments after TBI.",

Methadone, oxycodone and fentanyl, the most frequently cited prescription opioids, exhibited significant increases in opioid deaths. Prescription opioid-only deaths were more likely to involve other medications (e.g., benzodiazepines) and to have occurred among residents of a suburban or small town location, compared to heroin-involved or methadone-involved deaths. Heroin-only deaths tended to occur among non-Whites, were more likely to involve alcohol or cocaine and to occur in public locations and large cities.",

The process of catalepsy sensitization incorporates different learning stages. Here we investigated the mechanisms underlying the consolidation of catalepsy sensitization. In particular, we asked whether NMDA- and non-NMDA (AMPA- and Kainate) receptors play a role in the consolidation of catalepsy sensitization. Accordingly, rats received post-training injections of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (single injection of either 0.1mg/kg or 0.25mg/kg; or a double injection of 0.1mg/kg immediately and 30 min after test cessation) or of the AMPA/Kainate receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (single injection of 5mg/kg). Our results showed that the consolidation of catalepsy sensitization was decelerated by both glutamatergic AMPA/Kainate- and NMDA-receptor antagonists. With the higher MK-801 dosage, the deceleration was stronger, suggesting a dose dependent mechanism. We hence affirmed a role for the ionotropic glutamate receptors in the consolidation process of catalepsy sensitization.",

Susceptibility to the convulsant effects of PTZ decreased 24 hours, but increased 48 hours, after clonazepam administration. Ultrasonic vocalizations were completely suppressed 30 minutes and 3 hours after clonazepam; a moderate inhibitory effect persisted even at 48 hours. Motor abilities were slightly compromised up to 3 hours. Similar effects of Ro 19-8022 on PTZ-induced seizures and ultrasonic vocalizations were observed 24 and 48 hours after administration; motor performance was not affected. Rebound proconvulsant effects followed different time courses after administration of the two benzodiazepine receptor ligands in developing animals.

    "84": "Use of atypical antipsychotic medications (AAMs) in the treatment of disruptive behavior (DB) in children and adolescents has increased dramatically worldwide. However, with exception of using risperidone (i.e., for the management of irritability associated with autism, manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, and schizophrenia) and aripiprazole (i.e., for manic and mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and schizophrenia), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the use of AAMs in children and adolescents. Although research on use of these medications in children and adolescents has increased, mechanisms of action and long-term outcomes remain poorly understood or unknown. Particularly concerning is that use of these medications in children and adolescents may impact cognitive, social, and physical development, as side effects may interfere with activities in their educational setting, peer networks, and recreational settings. Overall, AAMs frequently are prescribed off label, control DB through sedation rather than targeting actual causes of DB, and lead to many negative side effects with unknown long-term effects. Reconsidering the use of AAMs in managing DB is encouraged strongly.", 
    "85": "Bupropion, or amfebutamone, is an atypical antidepressant also used during tobacco cessation. From a structural standpoint, it resembles amphetamine drugs with psychostimulant effects, and endogenous monoamines. From a pharmacological standpoint, bupropion, and two of its most important active metabolites, inhibit dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake. It has recently been discovered that bupropion may act as a non-competitive cholinergic nicotinic receptor antagonist, and that it may inhibit the activation of reward systems triggered by nicotine. Buproprion's efficacy as a smoking cessation aid has been demonstrated by numerous clinical trials that have compared its effects with those of placebo and other nicotinic substitutes. In 2001, buproprion SR received marketing authorization in France as a smoking cessation aid, under the name ZYBAN\u00ae. Tobacco addiction indeed remains a major public health issue. Among patients with psychiatric conditions, chronic tobacco consumption is frequent. The development of non-nicotinic drugs may therefore enhance therapeutic possibilities. However, the psychotropic effects of these molecules should be taken into account. We have recently reported the case of a patient with schizoaffective disorder, who presented two acute bupropion-induced psychotic episodes. We have also undertaken an exhaustive bibliographical research on this subject.

In about two third of cases, the patients have no history of psychiatric conditions. In one third of cases, they have a history of thymic disorders. In our review, auditory, visual or cenaesthetic hallucinations frequently occur (85% of the reported cases), and are sometimes characterized by single episodes and/or are rationalized. Some of them occur along with delusional episodes (mystical, paranoid, etc.). The patients are restless, confused, but seldom exhibit dissociative and thymic symptoms.", 
    "88": "From an aetiopathogenic, clinical and evolutive standpoint, buproprion-induced psychotic episodes share many similarities with acute organic or toxic psychosis (notably induced by amphetamines). The hypothesis of a dopaminergic hyper-reactivity should be analyzed. Moreover, most of these patients were taking other medication, and the possibility of a dopaminergic potentialization prior to buproprion intake could be suggested. In such cases, bupropion should be discontinued and complete remission is expected within an average of 10 days. Even though neuroleptic drugs are still frequently used in these cases, benzodiazepines could become a valid alternative, according to the model of amphetamine-induced acute psychosis.",

Current guidelines determine which is the right preventive regimen for each cancer patient at risk for experiencing CINV. Adherence to this guidelines and implementation in daily practice seem to be below the optimal level. In Belgium, authorities use the guidelines as a base for reimbursement and this has increased the level of implementation.",

About three-fourths of people who have trouble sleeping say that the problem is \"occasional,\" averaging about 6 nights per month, with one-fourth having frequent or chronic insomnia, averaging about 16 nights per month. Individuals with insomnia most often report a combination of difficulty falling asleep and intermittent wakefulness during sleep. Treatment of insomnia involves behavioral changes, such as minimizing habits that interfere with sleep (for example, drinking coffee or engaging in stressful activities in the evening), and pharmacotherapy with sedating antidepressants (for example, trazodone), sedating antihistamines, anticholinergics, benzodiazepines, or nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics. The benzodiazepines and the newer sedative hypnotics zolpidem, zaleplon, zopiclone, and eszopiclone work through gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors. Ramelteon, a hypnotic approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2005, is a selective melatonin receptor (MT1 and MT2) agonist.

The mass spectra (\u0394m < 3 ppm) of more than 2,500 illegal and therapeutic drugs, pesticides, alkaloids, other toxic chemicals and metabolites were measured, by use of an Agilent 6530 instrument, by flow-injection of 1 ng of the pure substances in aqueous ammonium formate-formic acid-methanol, with positive and negative electrospray-ionization (ESI), selection of the protonated or deprotonated molecules [M+H](+) or [M-H](-) by the quadrupole, and collision induced dissociation (CID) with nitrogen as collision gas at CID energies of 10, 20, and 40 eV. The fragment mass spectra were controlled for structural plausibility, corrected by recalculation to the theoretical fragment masses and added to a database of accurate mass data and molecular formulas of more than 7,500 toxicologically relevant substances to form the \"database and library of toxic compounds\". For practical evaluation, blood and urine samples were spiked with a mixture of 33 drugs at seven concentrations between 0.5 and 500 ng mL(-1), prepared by dichloromethane extraction or protein precipitation, and analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS in data-dependent acquisition mode. Unambiguous identification by library search was possible for typical basic drugs down to 0.5-2 ng mL(-1) and for benzodiazepines down to 2-20 ng mL(-1). The efficiency of the method was also demonstrated by re-analysis of venous blood samples from 50 death cases and comparison with previous results. In conclusion, LC-QTOF-MS in data-dependent acquisition mode combined with an accurate mass database and CID spectra library seemed to be one of the most efficient tools for systematic toxicological analysis.", 
    "97": "Although sedation is often performed during spinal anesthesia, the details of intraoperative dreaming have not been reported. We designed this prospective study to compare 2 different IV sedation protocols (propofol and midazolam infusion) with respect to dreaming during sedation.", 
    "98": "Two hundred twenty adult patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups and received IV infusion of propofol or midazolam for deep sedation during spinal anesthesia. Patients were interviewed on emergence and 30 minutes later to determine the incidence, content, and nature of their dreams. Postoperatively, patient satisfaction with the sedation was also evaluated.", 
    "99": "Two hundred fifteen patients (108 and 107 in the propofol and midazolam groups, respectively) were included in the final analysis. The proportion of dreamers was 39.8% (43/108) in the propofol group and 12.1% (13/107) in the midazolam group (odds ratio=4.78; 95% confidence interval: 2.38 to 9.60). Dreams of the patients receiving propofol were more memorable and visually vivid than were those of the patients receiving midazolam infusion. The majority of dreams (36 of 56 dreamers, 64.3%) were simple, pleasant ruminations about everyday life. A similarly high level of satisfaction with the sedation was observed in both groups.", 
    "100": "In cases of spinal anesthesia with deep sedation, dreaming was almost 5 times more common in patients receiving propofol infusion than in those receiving midazolam, although this did not influence satisfaction with the sedation. Thus, one does not need to consider intraoperative dreaming when choosing propofol or midazolam as a sedative drug in patients undergoing spinal anesthesia.", 
    "101": "Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) has been implicated in the itch-scratch cycle. We investigated if this gut-brain-skin peptide plays a role in the compulsive, hindleg scratching of the neck of mice by 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI), the kappa opioid receptor antagonist, and in the antipruritic activity of nalfurafine, the kappa opioid agonist. Previously, we showed that GNTI (0.03-1mg/kg, s.c.) elicits dose-related scratching and that nalfurafine (0.001-0.02mg/kg, s.c.) inhibits this behavior in mice. Utilizing immunohistochemistry, GRP positive nerve fibers were detected in mouse skin and superficial layer of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord as well as GRP positive cells in the dorsal root ganglion. Pretreating mice with either a pseudopeptide GRP receptor antagonist, RC-3095 (10-30mg/kg, s.c. at -15min), or a peptide GRP receptor antagonist, [d-Phe(6)]bombesin(6-13) methyl ester (2-100nmol, i.t. at -10min), did not suppress GNTI-induced scratching. However, pretreating mice with either antagonist inhibited scratching precipitated by the GRP receptor agonist, GRP(18-27) (2nmol, i.t.). Pretreating mice with a muscarinic M(1) receptor agonist, McN-A-343 (1.5-15\u03bcg/5\u03bcl, i.t. at -10min) antagonized GNTI-induced scratching. Norbinaltorphimine (20mg/kg, i.p. at -18 to -20h), a kappa opioid antagonist, countered the antiscratch activity of nalfurafine. We conclude that (a) the GRP receptor system does not mediate GNTI-induced scratching and (b) the kappa opioid system is involved, at least in part, in the scratch suppressing activity of nalfurafine.", 
    "102": "In the brain, translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), previously called peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), is a glial protein that has been extensively used as a biomarker of brain injury and inflammation. However, the functional role of TSPO in glial cells is not well characterized. In this study, we show that the TSPO-specific ligands R-PK11195 (PK) and Ro5-4864 (Ro) increased microglia proliferation and phagocytosis with no effect on migration. Both ligands increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and this effect may be mediated by NADPH-oxidase. PK and Ro also produced a small but detectable increase in IL-1\u03b2 release. We also examined the effect of PK and Ro on the expression of proinflammatory genes and cytokine release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activated microglia. PK or Ro had no effect on LPS-induced increase of pro-inflammatory genes, but they both decreased the ATP-induced increase of COX-2 gene expression. Ro, but not PK, enhanced the LPS-induced release of IL-1\u03b2. However, Ro decreased the ATP-induced release of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and PK decreased the ATP-induced release of TNF-\u03b1. Exposure to Ro in the presence of LPS increased the number of apoptotic microglia, an effect that could be blocked by PK. These findings show that TSPO ligands modulate cellular functions consistent with microglia activation. Further, when microglia are activated, these ligands may have therapeutic potential by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes and cytokine release. Finally, Ro-like ligands may be involved in the elimination of activated microglia via apoptosis.",

Because of a need for extra precautions against complications such as seizures and severe respiratory complaints, patients with a history of withdrawal seizures or complications with clomethiazole in their history were automatically assigned to the clonazepam group. The remaining patients were alternately assigned either to the clonazepam group (n = 38 altogether) or the clomethiazole group (n = 36). Rescue medication could consist of adding either extra clonazepam or clomethiazole. Effectiveness was measured by Clinical Global Impression Scale, Revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol Scale, Mainz Alcohol Withdrawal Scale, Essen Self-Assessment-Alcohol Withdrawal and attrition rate. Safety and tolerability was estimated from adverse clinical events. Secondary outcome values were heart rate, blood and pulse pressure.", 
    "110": "There were no significant differences between the treatments with respect to primary and secondary effectiveness measures, safety or tolerability or duration of medication treatment. Both reduced the severity of initial withdrawal symptoms below 20% up to the ending of withdrawal medications. No withdrawal seizure or delirium occurred.",

    "112": "An important step in the development of new drugs is to evaluate the extent of their metabolism during absorption in the small intestine. Reliable in vitro systems to do this can expediate the development process, but the current systems are often unsuitable because they lack the appropriate metabolic enzymes (e.g. Caco-2 cell monolayers) or are not representative of the physiological conditions present in the intact intestinal cells (e.g. isolated microsomes). The aim of this study was to validate the use of isolated intestinal epithelial cells (enterocytes), equivalent to hepatocytes, to evaluate Phase I drug metabolism. A method was developed to prepare enterocytes from rat and pig (as metabolically closer to man) that maintained good viability and activity for up to 90 min as judged by trypan blue exclusion and the release of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. The Phase I metabolism of the established marker drugs: midazolam, bupropion and dextromethorphan were measured by LC-MS and confirmed the activities of the 3A, 2B and 2D families of CYP isoforms, respectively. The kinetic parameters, K(m) and V(max), were compared between isolated cells and isolated intestinal microsomes from the rat. The use of isolated intestinal cells is a simple and practical method to study the Phase I metabolism of drugs during their absorption and the potential for drug-drug interactions. The method could eventually be modified and usefully applied to human studies.",

Three major intervention approaches were identified; education, audit and feedback, and alerts.", 
    "116": "Studies which used a multi-faceted approach had the largest and most sustained reductions in benzodiazepines use. It appears that support groups for patients, non-voluntary recruitment of GPs, and oral delivery of alerts or feedback may all improve the outcomes of interventions. The choice of outcome measures, delivery style of educational messages, and requests by GPs to stop benzodiazepines, either in a letter or face to face, showed no differences on the success rates of the intervention.", 
    "117": "The current work extends our previous findings in stress-related disorders, but also addresses the impact of a neurokinin-2 (NK2) antagonist on cognition. Besides efficacy in mood disorders, an NK2 antagonist may have the potential to lack the disinhibitory components and adverse side effects associated with existing clinical treatments. Saredutant (3-30 mg/kg, per os, p.o.) was tested for anxiolytic-like potential in three mouse models: holeboard, stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) and four-plate. In the holeboard model saredutant (30 mg/kg) showed a trend to increase head dipping without affecting general activity. In the SIH model, saredutant demonstrated a significant reduction in stress-induced temperature at 30 mg/kg, while the number of punished crossings in the four-plate was increased at all doses tested (3-30 mg/kg). While chlordiazepoxide (CDP) demonstrated anxiolytic-like effects in these models, the adverse side effects of benzodiazepines, such as sedation, disinhibition and cognitive deficits are well-documented. Saredutant produced no detrimental effect in three models of cognition: Morris Water Maze (MWM) in rats, spontaneous alternation in a Y-maze in mice and novel objection recognition in mice. In contrast, the benzodiazepine, diazepam (DZM), produced cognitive impairments. NK2 receptor antagonists like saredutant may therefore yield beneficial effects for mood disorders without the adverse effects of current treatments.",

    "122": "Generic medications do not undergo the rigorous approval process required of original medications. Their effectiveness and safety is expected to be equal to that of their more expensive counterparts. However, several case reports and studies describe clinical deterioration and decreased tolerability with generic substitution. Pubmed was searched from January 1, 1974 to March 1, 2010. The MeSH term \"generic, drugs\" was combined with \"anticonvulsants,\" \"mood stabilizers,\" \"lithium,\" \"antidepressants,\" \"antipsychotics,\" \"anxiolytics,\" and \"benzodiazepines.\" Additional articles were obtained by searching the bibliographies of relevant references. Articles in English, French, or Spanish were considered if they discussed clinical equivalence of generic and brand-name medications, generic substitution, or issues about effectiveness, tolerability, compliance, or economics encountered with generics. Clinical deterioration, adverse effects, and changes in pharmacokinetics are described with generic substitution of several anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers (carbamazepine, valproate, lamotrigine, gabapentin, topiramate, lithium), antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram, sertraline, venlafaxine, mirtazapine, bupropion), antipsychotics (risperidone, clozapine), and anxiolytics (clonazepam, alprazolam). Generics do not always lead to the anticipated monetary savings and also raise compliance issues. Although the review is limited by publication bias and heterogeneity of the studies in the literature, we believe there is enough concern to advise generic switching on an individual basis with close monitoring throughout the transition. Health professionals should be aware of the stakes around generic substitution especially when health economics promote universal use of generics.",

The phase solubility profile of lorazepam with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin was an AP-type, indicating the\u3000formation of 2:1 stoichiometric inclusion complexes. Gibbs free energy values were all negative, indicating the spontaneous nature of lorazepam solubilization, and they decreased with an increase in the cyclodextrin concentration, demonstrating that the reaction conditions became more favorable as the concentration of cyclodextrins increased. Complexes of lorazepam were prepared with cyclodextrin using various methods such as physical mixing, kneading, spray-drying, and lyophilization. The complexes were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier-transform infrared, scanning electron microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction studies. These studies indicated that a complex prepared by lyophilization had successful inclusion of the lorazepam molecule into the cyclodextrin cavity. Complexation resulted in a marked improvement in the solubility and wettability of lorazepam. Among all the samples, a complex prepared with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin by lyophilization had the greatest improvement in the in vitro rate of lorazepam dissolution. The mean dissolution time for lorazepam decreased significantly after preparing complexes and physical mixtures of lorazepam with cyclodextrin. The similarity factor indicated a significant difference between the release profiles of lorazepam from complexes and physical mixtures and from plain lorazepam. Tablets containing complexes prepared with cyclodextrins had significant improvement in the release profile of lorazepam as compared to tablets containing lorazepam without cyclodextrin.", 
    "128": "Restless legs syndrome, or Ekbom syndrome, is a common (yet poorly recognized) neurological condition, with sensitive and motor symptoms and a probable genetic vulnerability. The subjects experience an imperious urge to move their legs at rest, possibly associated with paresthesia and pain, which occurs mostly in the evening and night, and is transiently relieved by movements and walking. Severe cases suffer from involuntary leg jerks during quiet wake and severe insomnia. The syndrome is more frequent in middle-aged subjects, in women, and in iron deficient subjects (renal insufficiency, pregnancy, multiparous mothers). We report a series of patients with a severe restless legs syndrome, adequately treated with small doses of dopamine agonist in the evening. They experienced a perioperative, acute exacerbation of their syndrome. The inability to stay still with involuntary jerks in the operating room, the generalized pain followed by suicidal thoughts, and the agitation with akathisia in the recovery room, complicated the surgery procedures and their follow-ups. The prevention of restless legs exacerbation includes: (i) contra-indicating hydroxyzine, droperidol and any other drug blocking the central dopamine transmission before and during anaesthesia; (ii) using intravenous or subcutaneous opioids, and benzodiazepines during and after the surgery procedure; (iii) temporary increasing the dosage of dopamine agents after surgery; (iv) monitoring (and compensating if low) the iron stores after surgery.",

Fortunately, most toxin-related seizures respond to standard therapy using benzodiazepines. However, a few alterations in the standard approach are recommended to ensure optimal care and expedient termination of seizure activity. If 2 doses of a benzodiazepine do not terminate the seizure activity, a therapeutic dose of pyridoxine (5\u00a0g intravenously in an adult and 70 mg/kg intravenously in a child) should be considered.

However, it is critical to avoid prematurely labeling a seizure as being caused by alcohol withdrawal before performing a careful diagnostic evaluation.

Fourteen healthy male sheep were randomly assigned to two different drug regimens. In Group 1 the sheep were anesthetized with ketamine + xylazine (22 mg/kg im. + 0.2 mg/kg i.m., respectively). Anesthetic combination of ketamine + diazepam (22 mg/kg im. + 0.4 mg/kg i.m., respectively) was used in Group 2. Heart rate, respiratory rate and mean arterial pressures were evaluated before anesthesia, after induction of anesthesia up to 30 minutes in 5 minute intervals and during recovery. In all sheep, duration of anesthesia induction, duration of anesthesia and duration of recovery were recorded. Quality of induction, anesthesia, analgesia and recovery were evaluated. Cardio-respiratory parameters decreased below baseline values after anesthesia induction in both groups. However, no profound effects on cardio-respiratory functions were observed during study. In Group 2, it was observed that; anesthesia induction time was longer, the depth of anesthesia was inadequate during the osteotomy stage of the surgical procedure and recovery time was longer in comparison to Group 1. Otherwise the quality of anesthesia induction, anesthesia, analgesia and recovery was better in Group 1 than Group 2. These findings indicate that both drug combinations can provide short time anesthesia for minor surgical procedures. Ketamine+xylazine combination can be used as a more suitable anesthetic combination in experimental surgical procedures such as maxillofacial surgery than ketamine+diazepam combination, in sheep.",

Twelve healthy male volunteers (mean age = 24.83 \u00b1 3.16 years), were evaluated in a randomized, balanced-order, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design. Diazepam (10 mg) or placebo was given 1 h before the neuroimaging acquisition. In a blocked design covert face emotional task, subjects were presented with neutral (A) and aversive (B) (angry or fearful) faces. Participants were also submitted to an explicit emotional face recognition task, and subjective anxiety was evaluated throughout the procedures. Diazepam attenuated the activation of right amygdala and right orbitofrontal cortex and enhanced the activation of right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) to fearful faces. In contrast, diazepam enhanced the activation of posterior left insula and attenuated the activation of bilateral ACC to angry faces. In the behavioural task, diazepam impaired the recognition of fear in female faces. Under the action of diazepam, volunteers were less anxious at the end of the experimental session. These results suggest that benzodiazepines can differentially modulate brain activation to aversive stimuli, depending on the stimulus features and indicate a role of amygdala and insula in the anxiolytic action of benzodiazepines.",

Male and female BRAT rats exhibited baseline (saline treatment) PPI that was not different from each other (21.1% and 21.3%, respectively) and low compared with those historically exhibited by LE rats (approximately 59%). Chlorpromazine facilitated PPI in male and female BRAT rats, whereas imipramine, diazepam, and valproic acid had no significant effect on PPI. These results suggest that PPI in the BRAT rat responds specifically to drugs with APD efficacy but not psychotropic drugs of different therapeutic families.",

This is a prospective, randomized, open-label study conducted from February 2001 to February 2006. Data for the present investigation were obtained from a large epidemiologic and 3-year longitudinal intervention program of first-episode psychosis (DSM-IV criteria) conducted at the University Hospital Marques de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain. One hundred and seventy four patients were randomly assigned to haloperidol (N\u00a0=\u00a056), olanzapine (N\u00a0=\u00a055), or risperidone (N\u00a0=\u00a063) and followed up for 1 year. Primary effectiveness measures were the time up to relapse and rates of relapse and symptomatic remission. There were no significant differences in the relapse rate between treatments (11.1% haloperidol; 18.5% olanzapine, and 13.8% risperidone) (\u03c7(2)\u00a0=\u00a01.230; p\u00a0=\u00a00.541) or in the time up to relapse (Log Rank \u03c7(2)\u00a0=\u00a00.308; p\u00a0=\u00a00.857).

Data were from three 24- to 28-week randomized, controlled studies comparing olanzapine to ziprasidone or aripiprazole for treatment of schizophrenia. Analyses were restricted to completers with fasting laboratory data at all protocol specified time points. Analyses were primarily descriptive and included mean changes and categorical outcomes. In all treatment groups, participants who did not experience a 20 mg/dL or greater increase in triglycerides at early time points were unlikely to experience a change of 50 mg/dL or more in triglycerides after 6 months. Negative predictive values were 83% to 95%. However, early change in triglycerides was not useful for predicting later change in glucose, cholesterol, or weight. Similarly, early weight change gave robust negative predictive values for longer-term weight change (\u226510 kg), but not for change in glucose or cholesterol. Lack of early elevation in triglyceride concentrations was predictive of later lack of substantial increase in triglycerides in olanzapine-, ziprasidone-, and aripiprazole-treated participants. Lack of early elevation in weight was predictive of later lack of substantial increase in weight in all 3 treatment groups. Early monitoring of triglyceride concentrations and weight may help clinicians assess risk that individuals will experience significant increase in triglycerides or weight gain, allowing assessments of potential risks and benefits earlier in treatment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of BEO (1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0% w/w) administered to rats on both anxiety-related behaviours (the elevated plus-maze (EPM) and hole-board tests) and stress-induced levels of plasma corticosterone in comparison with the effects of diazepam. Inhalation of BEO (1% and 2.5%) and injection of diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased the percentage of open arm entries on the EPM. The percentage time spent in the open arms was also significantly enhanced following administration of either BEO (2.5% and 5%) or diazepam. Total arm entries were significantly increased with the highest dose (5%), suggesting an increase in locomotor activity. In the hole-board test, 2.5% BEO and diazepam significantly increased the number of head dips. 2.5% BEO and diazepam attenuated the corticosterone response to acute stress caused by exposure to the EPM. In conclusion, both BEO and diazepam exhibited anxiolytic-like behaviours and attenuated HPA axis activity by reducing the corticosterone response to stress.",

In electrophysiological experiments, 0.1 mg/kg diazepam had no effect on the PSA in the mPFC. In contrast, 0.5 mg/kg diazepam increased the PSA in the mPFC within 30 min of administration; however, this PSA increase was attenuated over the 30-min period.

    "200": "This chapter provides an overview of neurosteroids, especially their impact on the brain, sex differences and their therapeutic potentials. Neurosteroids are synthesized within the brain and rapidly modulate neuronal excitability. They are classified as pregnane neurosteroids, such as allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone, androstane neurosteroids, such as androstanediol and etiocholanolone, and sulfated neurosteroids such as pregnenolone sulfate. Neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone are positive allosteric modulators of GABA-A receptors with powerful anti-seizure activity in diverse animal models. Neurosteroids increase both synaptic and tonic inhibition. They are endogenous regulators of seizure susceptibility, anxiety, and stress. Sulfated neurosteroids such as pregnenolone sulfate, which are negative GABA-A receptor modulators, are memory-enhancing agents. Sex differences in susceptibility to brain disorders could be due to neurosteroids and sexual dimorphism in specific structures of the human brain. Synthetic neurosteroids that exhibit better bioavailability and efficacy and drugs that enhance neurosteroid synthesis have therapeutic potential in anxiety, epilepsy, and other brain disorders. Clinical trials with the synthetic neurosteroid analog ganaxolone in the treatment of epilepsy have been encouraging. Neurosteroidogenic agents that lack benzodiazepine-like side effects show promise in the treatment of anxiety and depression.",

In animal models, Syrian hamsters have been used extensively to study the pharmacology of circadian rhythms, while rats and mice are used to screen putative anxiolytics/antidepressant compounds. It would be beneficial to be able to test anxiolytic/antidepressant compounds in hamsters in conjunction with circadian rhythm studies. Therefore, in this study, Syrian hamsters were used in three experimental paradigms to evaluate anxiety: the elevated plus maze, the t-tube, and the open field Thatcher-Britton conflict test. Diazepam, tested with 2mg/kg and 5mg/kg intraperitoneal injections, was found to induce anxiolytic activity in each of the three tests. Hamsters were more likely to spend time in the open arms in the plus maze, displayed more exploratory behavior in the t-tube, and were quicker to enter a brightly lit exposed field in the Thatcher-Britton conflict test following injections of diazepam. Diazepam (2mg/kg) was also tested at three times during the 24-h day in the elevated plus maze: at the beginning and end of the lights-on period (Zeitgeber times 23 and 11, respectively) and once in the dark just before the room lights came on (Zeitgeber time 20). Diazepam induced anxiolytic activity only at Zeitgeber 23. Therefore, the following known and putative anxiolytic compounds were also evaluated in each of the three tests at Zeitgeber 23: citalopram, the neurokinin(1) receptor antagonists GR205171 and vestipitant, the corticotropin releasing factor(1) receptor antagonist CP154526, the cannabinoid receptor(1) agonist CP55940, the serotonin(6) receptor antagonist SB399885, and the metabotropic glutamate receptor(5) antagonists fenobam and MTEP. Vestipitant displayed some anxiolytic activity in the elevated plus maze, but this effect was not confirmed with GR205171. None of the other compounds displayed any anxiolytic activity in the tests. Nevertheless, the present results with diazepam - together with a few reports from other laboratories, indicate that the elevated plus maze may be a suitable procedure for evaluating the actions of anxiolytic compounds in Syrian hamsters. In view of current interest in novel classes of psychotropic agent interacting with diverse GABA(A) receptor recognition sites, further characterization appears justified.", 
    "202": "Nervous system active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), including anti-depressants and opioids, are important clinically administered pharmaceuticals within healthcare facilities. This study provides source characterization data describing the composition and magnitude of nervous system APIs present in healthcare facility wastewaters. Concentrations and mass loadings of ten nervous system APIs and three nervous system API metabolites are reported for wastewaters from a hospital, nursing, assisted living, and independent living facility within a single municipality. Concentrations of nervous system APIs ranged from non-detectable levels for alprazolam in all four facility wastewaters to a high of 290 ng/L amitriptyline in nursing facility wastewater. The summed mean concentration of all thirteen analytes ranged from 402 ng/L in independent living facility wastewater to 624 ng/L in assisted living facility wastewater. Wastewater flow rates from each facility were combined with concentration data to estimate the daily mass loading of nervous system APIs leaving each facility through wastewater discharge to the municipal sewer system. The total mass loading of all thirteen analytes for the hospital, nursing, assisted living, and independent living facility was 228, 44, 29.5, and 28.1 mg/day, respectively. The total mass loading of nervous system APIs contributed to the municipality's wastewater from all four facilities was 330 mg/day."
