    "0": "Over a period of 7 to 12 weeks we studied 3 series of 274 patients with depressive and somatic complaints treated with the long-acting neuroleptic fluspirilene in a dosage of 1-1.5 mg weekly. By means of various rating scales it was compared to diazepam in regard to its tranquilizing effects. Fluspirilene showed good activating and antidepressive qualities, which were superior to those of diazepam, whereas somatic complaints responded equally well to both drugs. The indications for a long-acting tranquilizer with the advantage of a controllable application are being discussed.", 
    "1": "Since aqueous solutions of diazepam were introduced into clinical practice, the problem has arisen of local vascular side effects after intravenous injection. A new preparation of diazepam as a lipid emulsion is presented. It was prepared by Vitrum and shows many similarities to Intralipid. A clinical trial was designed to study the incidence of pain in connection with the intravenous injection of diazepam and the incidence of subsequent thrombophlebitis. The preparation was used as a sedative to patients before gastroscopic investigation and as an inductor to general anaesthesia. In the material of 88 patients, thrombophlebitis was observed in 1.1%. Only 1 patient in the group of 314 patients studied complained of pain in connection with injection. The results observed were compared with previous investigations from the literature and with parallel control investigations. The new lipid emulsion form of the preparation was found to reduce significantly the incidence of local side effects involving the venous system. No significant difference in the therapeutic effect of the different preparative forms of the active substance was observed. The possible mechanisms involving the production of thrombophelbitis in connection with the injection of aqueous solutions of diazepam are discussed.", 
    "2": "In a double-blind preliminary study in 32 students exhibiting symptoms of examination stress, treatment with 80 mg oxprenolol daily or 4 mg diazepam daily were found to be equally effective in relieving anxiety and tension, as assessed by both students and physician. Although students on diazepam became significantly more confident of success than those on oxprenolol, their results were worse than expected. In contrast, students on oxprenolol did not gain in confidence and they were significantly more successful than anticipated by their tutors.", 
    "3": "Through a controlled double-blind study in 30 hospitalized patients affected with endogenous depression, the antidepressant action of the combination of nialamide+l-5-HTP has been evaluated and compared with a control group which only received nialamide (+ placebo). The patients treated with nialamide + l-5-HTP achieved a fuller recovery than those who were treated with nialamide alone. The treatment with nialamide + l-5-HTP proved to have a shorter delay of onset. Side effects showed no marked differences except for the orthostatic hypotension which was less apparent in those patients treated with nialamide + l-5-HTP.", 
    "4": "The effect of the neuroleptic pimozide at doses of 2 mg/day was compared with that of diazepam at doses of 3 x 5 mg. This double-blind study involved 50 outpatients with psychovegetative syndromes and anxiety neuroses. At these doses and under the described test conditions both preparations were virtually equally effective. Pimozide can therefore be considered an alternative preparation for 'genuine' tranquilizers. Above all, its application seems to be useful in patients that are prone to drug abuse, and therefore, a priori, endangered by habit formation.", 
    "5": "In 2-day-old rats, ACTH increases the uptake of 3H-uridine in the brain; no such effects were observed in the msucle and liver tissue. Diazepam does not affect the uptake of 3H-uridine into the brain tissue, but decreases the uptake into the muscle tissue. In the brain tissue of infant rats, ACTH does not change the distribution of radioactivity of intraperitoneally administered 3H-uridine among U, Urd, UMP, UDP and UTP. Diazepam increases the amount of radioactivity, found at the U spot. In the muscle, both ACTH and Diazepam increases the amount of radioactivities found in the Urd spot. A significant correlation between the radioactivity of UMP+UDP+UTP and the specific activity of RNA was proved only in the brain. The ratio: specific activity of brain RNA/radioactivity of UMP+UDP+UTP was thus used as a tentative indicator of the biosynthesis of brain RNA. Neither ACTH nor diazepam altered this ratio in infant rats.", 
    "6": "The author studied the effect of diazepam in doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg on rats with a chronic cortical cobalt-gelatin focus and implanted cortical and subcortical electrodes. Focal spike activity localized at the site of the focus and hypersynchronous generalized episodes of spikes (and waves) of 8--9/sec frequency were studied in the electroencephalogram and the main phases of vigilance (waking, telencephalic slow waves/SWS/and REM sleep) after diazepam were evaluated. The effect of diazepam on rats temporarily immobilized with tubocurarine was also evaluated. 1. Focal spike activity during sleep was mildly inhibited by diazepam. If present in the waking state, it was markedly inhibited. 2. The number of episodes diminished significantly after diazepam. The maximum decrease occurred 30--45 minutes after administering diazepam and after that they slowly recovered. 3. Diazepam did not inhibit alteration of the phases of vigilance, but there was an increase in the proportion of telencephalic sleep with large numbers of spidles of 12--14/sec frequency and the incidence of REM phases rose by 250--300%. 4. Diazepam brought no renewal of the episodes which disappeared from the waking EEG recording of rats with a chronic focus temporarily immobilized with tubocurarine. Its administration was followed mostly by sleep activity with spindles. 5. Despite certain effects in common (disappearance of episodes), the action of diazepam differs from that of barbiturates in many respects and is effected by different mechanisms.", 
    "7": "Two drugs that should reduce striatal dopamine activity (haloperidol and reserpine) and two other drugs that should increase it (L-Dopa and amantadine) have been successively adminstered to six patients suffering from Huntington's Chorea. The most effective treatment in reducing hyperkinesis was haloperidol, followed by reserpine. Treatment with L-Dopa did not have appreciable effect, on this type of involuntary movements. Against some theoretical expectations administration of amantadine was followed by a slight improvement in the control of involuntary activity.", 
    "8": "In this research, a quantitative study of the EEG from 5 subjects permitted a detailed analysis of the effect of 30 mg of flurazepam administered over 7 nights. Four placebo baseline nights and 3 placebo withdrawal nights were also recorded. For 4 of the subjects, a nondrug and nonplacebo follow-up record was obtained 4 to 6 weeks later. The subjects were 4 females, 1 male, age range 23-42. All complained of either sleep onset greater than 45 min, sleep length of less than 6 h, or two or more sleep awakenings. Compressed spectral analysis yielded a computer-generated somnogram on each of the 15 nights of sleep, and an automated spindle detector was used to count and measure the duration of spindle bursts with frequencies of 12.25-15.5 c/sec on baseline nights 3 and 4, drug nights 1, 2, 3 and 7, on the 3rd withdrawal night, and on the 4-6 week followup record. K-complexes were scored visually on the 4th baseline and 7th drug nights. There were no significant differences in spindle rate per minute among baseline nights and the follow-up record. By the 2nd drug night, spindle rate had significantly increased over the baseline rate. Linear contrast analysis indicated there was a significant increase of spindle rate over drug nights. All 5 subjects showed this pattern of increase. In contrast to the increase in spindle activity, the rate per minute of K-complexes significantly decreased during drug administration.", 
    "9": "The early phase of diaplacental transfer of diazepam was studied in 39 women given the drug as a basic anaesthetic for operative vaginal delivery indicated by prolonged second stage of labour (9 cases), breech delivery (19 cases) and intrauterine hypoxia (11 cases). A total dose of 30 mg diazepam (Valium Roche) was injected intravenously over a period of 15 sec umbilical cord blood was collected immediately after delivery. Diazepam was extracted with diethyl ether and determined by gas chromatography. The concentration of diazepam in cord blood increased from greater than 5-250 ng/ml at 57-60 seconds to 48-1861 ng/ml at 90-100 seconds after completion of the intravenous injection. Thereafter a plateau seemed to be reached but the interindividual variation was still great with values ranging from 45-3034 ng/ml up to 360 seconds. Judged by Apgar score and the clinical course the neonates seemed to be unaffected by the medication administered to the mother.", 
    "10": "A twelve-week study involving fifty-three patients is described as taking place in a practice with a higher than average geriatric population. The purpose of the study was to substitute flurazepam for habitually used barbiturates or methaqualone/diphenhydramine. Of the original fifty-three patients admitted to the study, fifty-one completed; the two drop-outs resulting from concomitant physical illness. Eighty-four per cent of patients were successfully changed to flurazepam. Of those who did not accept flurazepam, eight per cent accepted nitrazepam, while six per cent of patients were motivated to stop all hypnotics. During the three month period of the study none of the well-known disadvantages of the barbiturates and methaqualone/diphenhydramine were seen with flurazepam. The author found flurazepam to be a very efficient hypnotic of relatively low toxicity which could be easily substituted fro barbiturates and methaqualone/diphenhydramine in the treatment of long-term insomnia.", 
    "11": "One hundred and four patients suffering from insomnia took part in four different two-night double-blind crossover trials of triazolam. In three separate studies, triazolam 0-5 mg was compared to placebo, flurazepam 30 mg and chloral hydrate 500 mg. Triazolam 0-5 mg was found to be preferred and to be superior to placebo, flurazepam and chloral hydrate in the treatment of insomnia. Analysis of sleep questionnaire data showed triazolam to be superior to the other treatments on the following: How much did the medication help you sleep, onset of sleep, duration of sleep and number of awakenings. Additionally, triazolam was superior to chloral hydrate on the feeling in the morning parameter. In another comparison of triazolam 0-25 mg to flurazepan 15 mg, triazolam was not significantly better than flurazepam on any of the efficacy parameters except that the patients felt more alert the morning following triazolam that following flurazepam. On all efficacy endpoints, trends for all parameters favoured triazolam 0-25 mg over flurazepam 15 mg. Untoward side-effects in these four studies were minimal.", 
    "12": "The present study was undertaken to evaluate the intermediate effects of triazolam 0-5 mg on the sleep of insomniac patients. The results showed that triazolam is effective in inducing and maintaining sleep without producing any major effects on sleep staging. Triazolam did not lead to significant subjective complaints or any deterioration in the physical condition of the patients. The effectiveness of traizolam did not vary over a two-week period.", 
    "13": "The hypnotic effects of a new triazolobenzodiazepine, triazolam (Halcion) 0-5 mg and methyprylon 300 mg was compared in twenty oncologic in-patient volunteers with insomnia using the preference technique. On the first night of the two-night trial, or methyprylon was given on a double-blind basis and on the second night the patients received the alternate medication. Following each trial night the patients were interviewed in regard to their sleep. Of the seventeen patients who completed the study, eleven patients preferred triazolam, three preferred methyprylon and three had no preference (p=0-057). Analysis of the various sleep parameters showed that triazolam helped the patients sleep more than methyprylon (p=0-13), induced more rapid sleep onset (p=0-003), gave a longer duration of sleep (p=0-013). The treatment was considered a success if the patient went to sleep in thirty minutes or less and slept for at least six hours. Triazolam was more successful than methyprylon in this respect (p=0-012). There were no side-effects reported on either of the drugs.", 
    "14": "The safety and efficacy of ketazolam (15 mg capsules) was compared to placebo in seventy-nine out-patients suffering from psychoneurotic anxiety, moderate or worse in severity. A flexible dosage range of 15-75 mg was used in this double-blind study lasting twenty-eight days. The average optimum therapeutic dose of ketazolam was 46-9 mg administered as a once-day dose at bedtime. Ketazolam was found to be significantly better than placebo in alleviating anxiety and its concomitant symptomatology as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, three Physician's Global Impressions, two Patient's Global Impressions, and three Target Symptoms. Fifteen patients dropped from the placebo group before completion of the study, and two withdrew from the ketazolam group. The patients receiving ketazolam experienced a greater reduction in symptomatology throughout the study when compared to the placebo group. Side-effects experienced by the ketazolam patients were less than, or equal to, the placebo patients. No deleterious side-effects occurred. No differences between the two groups were found for vital signs, EKG's, laboratory tests, or physical examinations.", 
    "15": "The authors report on 50 surgical or endoscopic cases in which local or regional anaesthesia was completed with a combination of diazepam and pentazocine (Pentazapam). This \"diazanalgesia\" was performed either as a routine or as a complement to regional anaesthesia (mostly an epidural) in which restlessness or insufficient analgesia were noted. Both drugs are injected separately. Diazepam being used to combat anxiety and pentazocine to allay pain. Sedation was considered to be sufficient in 43 cases out of 50 and analgesia in 47 cases out of 50. In all but one case, recovery was calm. In 24 cases, the patients regained consciensness quickly. There was only little effect on respiratory frequency, blood gases, blood pressure or cardiac rate. Thus, pentazepam combination can be considered as a useful method of \"wake diazanalgesia\" as far as it is used to complement a local or regional anaesthesia. This technique seems particularly useful in the aged or bad risk patient because of its moderate cardiovascular or respiratory aciton.", 
    "16": "During an uncontrolled trial 46 depressed patients (39 endogenous depressions, 5 schizoaffective psychoses and 2 paranoic schizophrenics with depressive syndromes) were treated for 43 days on the average with 3 X 100 mg 1-[3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b,f]-azepin-5-yl)-propyl]-4-piperidino-piperidine-4-carboxamide-dihydrochloride-monohydrate (carpipramine) daily. The clinical impression of the improvement and the results of the Hamilton-Scale for depressions (19 patients, 24 items) showed a clear antidepressive effect of carpipramine. During a double-blind trial 14 patients were treated with carpipramine and 16 with doxepine for 30 days. Most patients suffered from endogenous depressions with paranoic symptoms or from schizophrenia with depressive syndromes. Statistical analysis of the Hamilton-Scale for depressions and the AMP-System showed the antidepressive and antipsychotic effect of carpipramine. Analysis of covariance showed no significant difference between carpipramine and doxepine. Altogether we treated 60 depressive patients with carpipramine. 26 patients improved very well and 11 moderately, that means 37 patients out of 60 reacted positively to therapy with carpipramine. One endogenous depression and a schizoaffective psychosis changed into a manic phase. A provocation of schizophrenic symptoms was not noticed. Carpipramine was very well tolerated and can be classified as a non-sedative antidepressant with an antipsychotic effect.", 
    "17": "A statistically planned double blind cross-over test with the substances 1-[3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenz[b;f]-azepin-5-yl)-propyl]-4-piperidino-piperidine-4-carboxamide dihydrochloride-monohydrate (carpipramine, BAY b 4343 b) and placebo (BAY b 4343 a) was carried out on 30 long-term hospitalized schizophrenic patients. The study was evaluated by means of the kappa2-test and yielded the following results: 1. It could be statistically proved that carpipramine has a positive effect on psycho-pathological disorders in the behaviour of long-term hospitalized schizophrenic patients (kappa2 = 9.224; FG = 1; p greater than 0.05). 2. As regards the favourable influence of carpipramine on \"productive\" versus \"non-productive\" form of schizophrenia there were no differences. 3. Side effects or complications of a psychic, autonomic and/or motoric manner could not be seen. The usual laboratory tests showed no deviation from normal.", 
    "18": "The neutrality of the butyrophenones on intracranial pressure has been relatively well shown. That of the phenothiazines and benzodiazepine derivatives has been less well established. The authors studied, by a continuous method, the action of chlorpromazine, acepromazine and three benzodiazepines (diazepam, flunitrazepam and chlorazepam) on intracranial pressure and blood pressure in the dog. These substances seem to be definitely neutral on intracranial pressure, more so in the case of the benzodiazepines than for the promazines, the vasomotor action of which was perceptible when seen closely. The authors produce demonstrative graphs, illustrating the correlation of these two pressures.", 
    "19": "Ganglioplegic drugs, including trimetaphan, have been imperfect agents of arterial hypotension, liable to produce tachyphylaxis, and not blocking intercurrent attacks of adrenergic hypertension the dose is inconstant and reversibility sometimes doubtful. The association of neuroleptics, in particulier promazines, permits an appreciable economy in dosage, stabilises the curves of hypotension, with the disadvantage of blocking normalisation of blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside does not have the disadvantage of ganglioplegic drugs. Although usable alone, the blood pressure graphs sometimes have a certain instability mainly due to the difficulty of regulating the ideal perfusion flow rate. The authors show that the association of neuroleptic drugs has here also an effect of economy of dosage and facilitates the rise in blood pressure. Verification of reinforcement of the effect of sodium nitroprusside by chlorpromazine, acepromazine and levomepromazine was carried out in the dog. The authors show significant graphs.", 
    "20": "The benzodiazepines, medazepam, chlorodiazepoxyde, and oxazepam, act antihemolytically just as chloropromazine in hypotonic NaCl solution on human erythrocytes. The effect depends on concentration and is biphasic with the exception of oxazepam. The maximal antihemolytic concentrations are for medazepam 9.1-10-5 M, for chlorodiazepoxyde 4.6-10-4 M and, respectively, 9.1-10-4 M for diazepam and oxazepam. No linear correlation exists between the concentration at maximal hemolytic protection and the lipid solubility.", 
    "21": "Studies in man show that it is possible to reliably study the incidence, degree and duration of amnesia produced by drugs by showing patients 10 postcards and testing their ability to recall or recognise them six hours later. Using this method of study it was found that 1 mg flunitrazepam produced a comparable degree of amnesia to 10 mg diazepam, although its action was slightly longer. This difference was more marked when double doses were studied. The onset of the amnesic action of both drugs occurred within 2 minutes of their intravenous injection and rarely persisted for more than 10-15 minutes. In contrast, with 4 mg lorazepam the onset of amnesia was slower and persisted for up to 270 minutes. This was accompanied by a moderate but not excessive amount of drowsiness. Possible clinical uses for such a drug deserve serious consideration.", 
    "22": "Lorazepam is recognized as a tranquillizer. It is presented for intramuscular and intravenous injection. In a study of this drug's possible effects in premedication, its action was studied systematically when it was used for preoperative premedication. The drug has no side-effects other than drowsiness, which occurs in almost all cases. It produces very good premedication, sometimes with anterograde amnesia in the doses used. This anterograde amnesia is dependent on the dosage used but it is always accompanied by profound drowsiness, from which the patient can be roused verbally. The dose will be selected in relation to whether amnesia is desired or not. However, whatever the dose administered (over 2.5 mg), the tranquillizing effect is always of high quality.", 
    "23": "Diazepam was found to be the most surface active substance in aqueous solutions, chlorpromazine was less active and the lowest activity was found for haloperidol. The surface activity in blood was similar. The effect of pH on the surface activity of chlorpromazine solutions was observed.", 
    "24": "Ten milligrams of diazepam were injected intraamniotically in 8 mothers prior to therapeutic abortion between 12 and 19 weeks. The diazepam concentrations in the maternal plasma were comparable to those found after the same intramuscular diazepam dose to the mother. The concentration of diazepam in the amniotic fluid 12 to 18 hours after the injection was no longer significantly higher than in the maternal plasma. The concentrations of diazepam in the fetal plasma, liver and brain were comparable to the concentrations resulting from a 10 mg intramuscular diazepam dose to the mother about 2 hours before legal abortion. The feto-maternal ratio of diazepam was of same magnitude as after the intramuscular application to the mother. The results indicate that the disappearance of diazepam from the amniotic fluid in this stage of pregnancy occurs extraplacentally, through the mambranes into the uterine circulation. In the treatment of a fetus with drugs having properties similar to diazepam, intra-amniotic administration is no better than intramuscular administration to the mother.", 
    "25": "In order to test the validity of the concept of anxiety states masking an underlying depressive illness, patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from anxiety or tension states were treated on a random double-blind basis for 4 weeks with either a pure anxiolytic, lorazepam, or an anxiolytic/antidepressant preparation, fluphenazine with nortriptyline. Patients' self-ratings were very similar to the physicians' ratings which showed that fluphenazine/nortriptyline was associated with significantly greater overall improvement(p less than 0.01), as well as significantly greater improvements in the group of symptoms specifically related to depression(p less than 0.05). These results suggest that a depressive element is present in an appreciable proportion of patients presenting with apparent anxiety states, and antidepressant as well as anxiolytic treatment is required. Patients selected on the basis that they had improved satisfactorily at the end of the 4-weeks' treatment were followed up for a further 3 months without medication, and the relapse rate was 24%, irrespective of previous treatment. More of the patients treated with lorazepam had to be excluded from the follow-up because of failure to improve, and these probably represented the proportion (19%) of this population with an appreciable depressive element to their illness.", 
    "26": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of flunitrazepam, a benzodiazepine with strong hypnotic properties, on dream content. Eight normal subjects were studied in laboratory by the awakening technique, and the dream contents were rated by two judges according to nine scaled dimensions: unreality, participation of the dreamer, pleasantness, unpleasantness, verbal aggresivity, physical aggressivity, sexuality, sensoriality and time of reference in the dreamer's life. By comparison with placebo condition, flunitrazepam induced more unpleasantness, more verbal aggressivity, more physical aggressivity, and more sexuality in dreams. This increase of emotionally loaded contents can be related to a disinhibitory effect of this drug, and the possible involvement of dopaminergic or serotoninergic systems is discussed.", 
    "27": "An open study was carried out in 40 ambulatory neurotic patients with classical symptoms of anxiety to assess which of their symptoms responded most readily and favourably to treatment with lorazepam. Doses ranged from 2 mg to 15 mg daily and were adjusted to individual patient needs. The study period lasted 4 weeks and patients' individual symptoms were assessed weekly on a 4-point severity rating scale. The results showed a statistically significant and marked improvement during the first week for the majority of the 16 symptoms assessed, particularly emotional tension, irritability and apprehension. Symptoms with a cognitive element of anxiety were controlled to a lesser extent and were slower to respond. The few side-effects which were reported, mainly somnolence, appeared to be dose related and usually occurred during the first few days of treatment.", 
    "28": "In a double-blind investigation in 21 patients undergoing minor plastic surgery the effects of 4 mg lorazepam or a mixture of 20 mg papaveretum/400 mug hyoscine given intramuscularly as premedicants were studied. Lorazepam produced superior preoperative and post-operative anterograde amnesia, with respect to both incidence and duration. There was no difference in the pre-operative anxiolytic and soporofic effects of the two regimens and post-operatively, analgesic requirements and the incidence of vomitting and restlessness were the same in both groups of patients.", 
    "29": "In a shock-escape T-maze task, rats rapidly discriminated diazepam, flurazepam and chloridazepoxide from no drug. The discriminable effects of these benzodiazepines were not completely interchangeable with those of barbiturate anesthetics. The dose-response curve for diazepam asymptoted over the range 15 to 100 mg/kg, ip whereas dose-response curves for flurazepam and chloridazepoxide were more linear.", 
    "30": "An inventory was made of the various substances utilized as minor tranquillizers in man. Throughout the various methods of study of these drugs in animals the main pharmacological properties of tranquillizing drugs were considered. Attention is drawn on the various secondary or adverse effects of minor tranquillizers.", 
    "31": "A clinical study was carried out to evaluate the usefulness of intravenous lorazepam, given for sedation instead of opiate narcotics or diazepam, in 25 seriously-ill patients being treated in a respiratory and intensive care unit. All but 3 patients were on assisted ventilation. Standard doses of 4 mg lorazepam were given at 4 or 6-hourly intervals for periods up to 25 days. ECG, haemodynamic stability and biological determinations were monitored constantly. Apart from some delay in onset of action, lorazepam proved to be a useful sedative with diminished recall on the part of the patients. No side-effects were reported, nor was there any local reaction to the injection. Cardiac output was measured in 9 patients following intravenous administration of a single-dose of either 4 mg or 8 mg lorazepam. No significant changes were recorded.", 
    "32": "Subacute effects of C, T, S, or B, alone or in combination with A, were tested against P in two double-blind crossover trials with 37 healthy students. The drugs were given in capsules t.i.d. for 2 weeks each and the psychomotor performance (choice reaction, coordination, attention) was measured on the 7th and 14th days of treatment. At each session the subjects swallowed a capsule together with 0.5 g/kg of A or P drink, and the measurements were done, 30, 90, and 150 min thereafter. T alone did not differ from placebo in the doses used (10 mg t.i.d. for 7 days and 20 mg t.i.d. for the next 7 days). After C (dosing as above) and S (50 mg t.i.d.) both reactive and coordinative skills were slightly impaired. B (6 mg t.i.d.) clearly impaired both reactive skills and attention. T + A had no major combined effect on skills while C interacted with A resulting in impaired reactive and coordinative skills. After C + A the subjects were unable of compensating their coordination mistakes by slow driving. The interaction of S with A was mild, whereas B + A strongly impaired coordination and divided attention. No alterations were recorded in flicker fusion after any treatment.", 
    "33": "A major concern in prescribing hypnotics and minor tranquilizers in the hospital is that long-term habituation might develop. Former psychiatric inpatients were surveyed to assess hypnotic and minor tranquilizer use following discharge. Patients who used flurazepam and chloral hydrate as inpatients were no more likely to use these hypnotics as outpatients than patients who received no hypnotics as inpatients. There was a significant association between inpatient and outpatient use of minor tranquilizers. Outpatient use of minor tranquilizers was also significantly associated with outpatient hypnotic use.", 
    "34": "The results of a pharmacopsychological study on male students high or low in emotional stability are compared to those of a clinical study on neurotic out- and inpatients. These studies examine the effects of diazepam and various doses of a thienodiazepine (Bay g 5653), a drug under investigation. Although the studies are not completely comparable (placebo control missing in the clinical study, not enough information about comparable base line measures) the differences in effects of Bay g 5653 and diazepam on the actual emotional state, as measured by an adjective check list, show a certain amount of correspondence between normal subjects and patients but also considerable discrepancies.", 
    "35": "23 emotionally lable and 22 emotionally stable subjects wefe selected from a total smaple of 147 students by three personality inventories (FPI, GT, MPI). In a 2(3)-factor design the following effects of a single dose of 1.5 mg bromazepam p.o. against placebo were found: whereas the fine-motor activity (tapping, line-tracing) was stabilized independently of personality traits, the performance in attention tests (d2, choice-reaction time) was decreased in the emotionally stable group. In the emotionally lable group, i.e. in those subjects for whom bromazepam could therapeutically be indicated, an advantageous effect on performance in these tests was possible. The following variables were not affected by personality or medication: after-image of spiral rotor, critical flicker fusion (CFF), taking-task", 
    "36": "Giving flurazepam and placebo to students as subjects, the free description of drug-effects (FD) was compared to the description by a questionaire (QD). The results were: 1. The FD-method was more informative than the QD-method. 2. The FD-method induced less frequent placebo effects and more frequent verum-non-effects than did the QD-method. 3. The results (1) and (2) based mainly on the variables time-to fall-asleep, subjective quality of sleep and total time of sleep, in which variables flurazepam differed significantly from placebo.", 
    "37": "In acute and chronic experiments investigations were made concerning the effect of clozapine, haloperidol, sulpiride and carpipramine on MHPG, HVA and 5-HIAA in rat brain and on motor activity of the animals. The activity of the rats treated with clozapine and haloperidol was reduced on the first day. After 10 days of treatment this effected of clozapine was significantly diminished. The MHPG level increased slightly on the first day of treatment with all four drugs. This elevation was maintained after chronic treatment with carpipramine and sulpiride, whereas clozapine and haloperidol decreased the MHPG content. 5-HIAA values did not show significant changes in acute experiments, whereas in chronic ones there was an increase. Haloperidol and clozapine induced a strong increase of HVA which decreased after 11 days in those animals treated with haloperidol. In comparison to haloperidol, after clozapine application the percentage of HVA-increase was higher in the limbic system than in the nigrostriatum.", 
    "38": "One of the phasic phenomena of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the ponto-geniculo-occipital (PGO) waves, are induced in cats by either depleting brain monoamines with the benzoquinolizine derivative Ro 4-1284 or inhibiting the synthesis of 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) by p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). The effects of the most important psychotropic agents on PGO1284 and PGOPCPA are reported and explained by their interaction with one or more of the 4 neurotransmitters known so far to be involved in the regulation of the PGO wave generation in the pontine reticular formation. Tricyclic antidepressants depress PGO waves by inhibiting the neuronal uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and/or 5-HT. Some neuroleptics increase the density of GO waves by blocking 5-HT and/or NE receptors. Various indole hallucinogens depress PGO waves by stimulating 5-HT receptors. Benzoldiazepines appear to enhance a (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-ergic (GABA)-ergic inhibitory influence on NE neurons and increase the density of PGO waves in the presence of functionally intact NE neurons.", 
    "39": "The response of 134 anxious neurotic outpatients to lorazepam, diazepam, and placebo was assessed in a 4-week double-blind trial. Both active drugs produced significantly more symptom reduction than placebo. Lorazepam, however, proved effective primarily in those patients who did not complain of sedation, and produced greatest improvement in initially sicker patients. Sedation was significantly more disturbing to lorazepam-treated patients than to diazepam-treated patients. Present findings suggested that 3 mg/day of lorazepam may be too high a dosage for mildly anxious patients, while 15 mg/day of diazepam seems an appropriate dosage for mildly anxious patients but may be too low a dosage for highly anxious patients.", 
    "40": "A clinical study was carried out in 73 neoplastic patients suffering from anxiety and other emotional upsets to assess the effectiveness and tolerance of lorazepam. Patients were given individualised daily doses ranging from 1.5 mg to 3 mg lorazepam for 15 to 60 days. Results, as assessed by the response of anxiety, tension, erethism and insomnia, showed that only 4 (5%) patients failed to obtain some relief. There was complete disappearance of all symptoms in 29 (40%) after 15 days, relief of at least one major symptom and reduction in the others in 27 (37%), and slight reduction in one or more symptoms in 13 (18%) patients. Side-effects were minimal and disappeared within a few days with continued treatment.", 
    "41": "A double-blind controlled trial based on 140 women undergoing abortus provocatus was employed to study whether the frequency of side effects after administration of the anaesthetic Ketalar (ketamine) could be reduced by a con-current dose of Rohypnol (flunitrazepam). The control group was given ketamine alone. The dosage of ketamine was 2 mg/kg body weight, supplemented if necessary by 1 mg/kg, in combination with either 2 mg flunitrazepam or placebo. No other anaesthetics were used. On several counts, the combination of ketamine and flunitrazepam was proved to reduce the adverse reactions seen with ketamine alone. Motor restlessness and confusion in the awakening state occurred with significantly less severity and frequency. Amnesia for dreams was significantly more frequent. Memory of dreams was often unpleasant after ketamine alone. The influence on pulse rate was significantly smaller and no significant changes in systolic blood pressure were seen, whereas a significant increase occurred with ketamine alone. Less pronounced fluctuations in diastolic blood pressure occurred with the combination ketamine-flunitrazepam. Respiratory rate increased significantly with both treatments, but respiratory minute volume was lower with the ketamine-flunitrazepam combination.", 
    "42": "A double-blind comparison of ketamine (Ketalar) and ketamine with flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) for anesthesia in 136 abortions was conducted to see whether the combination would reduce the psychomimetic side effects of ketamine. Doses were ketamine 2 mg/kg body weight iv, mixed with 2 mg flunitrazepam or a placebo, and 1 mg/kg ketamine repeated if needed. The side effects significantly reduced were: motor restlessness, confusion requiring sedatives, dreams and nightmares, systolic and diastolic hypertension, tachycardia, and increase in respiratory rate and in respiratory minute volume. Those given ketamine alone required significantly more repeat injections.", 
    "43": "Amnesic action, skills related to driving and the ability to discriminate the fusion of flickering light were measured double-blind in 29 healthy volunteers before and after three doses of intravenous flunitrazepam. Every subject experienced amnesia for the pinching of the abdomen after being injected with flunitrazepam. Even the smallest dose of flunitrazepam (0.01 mg/kg) caused the amnesia without affecting the level of consciousness. The late effects of flunitrazepam were the most harmful to coordination. With 0.01 mg/kg eye-hand coordination was slightly impaired for as long as 6 h after the injection, and after 0.02 and 0.03 mg/kg the impairment was still significant (P less than 0.05) at the last observation period 10 h after the injection. It was concluded that, because the amnesic action of flunitrazepam is more effective than that of clinically comparable doses of diazepam, further clinical experiments with flunitrazepam are warranted. Its longer and more harmful effects on psychomotor performance than those of equipotent doses of diazepam suggest that doses of 0.02 mg/kg or more of flunitrazepam should be avoided in outpatient anaesthesia or sedation.", 
    "44": "The hyperkinetic syndrome is a symptom complex of hyperactivity, short attention span, distractibility, impulsivity, learning difficulties, other behaviour problems and 'equivocal' neurological signs. However, none of these terms has ever been objectively defined and at present diagnosis is largely a matter of clinical judgement. In the management of the disorder, drugs do have a place but the decision to use medication is a complex procedure diagnostically and therapeutically calling for the highest in clinical skill and medical supervision. The most useful medication at present is the stimulant group of drugs, particularly dextroamphetamine and methylphenidate. Antipsychotic drugs are sometimes useful but carry the risk of depressing higher CNS functions such as attention and cognition. Other drugs which have been shown to be of value include tricyclic antidepressants (although their effect is less predictable and less striking than that of the stimulants) and pemoline.", 
    "45": "The effectiveness in treating borderline states to a certain degree depends upon the pole (sthenic or asthenic) of the corresponding disturbance. Tranquilizers are the preparations of choice in the treatment of disorders of an asthenic pole (psychopathy of the asthenic range, neurotic states). In borderline conditions of a sthenic pole the effectiveness of tranquilizers is equal or sometimes is even less than in therapy with small doses of neuroleptics. In treating neurotic conditions tranquilizers of the benzodiazepine group can be ranged in the following succession: nitrazepam, chlordiazepoxide, medazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, lorazepam. This preparation is a continuun of an increasing psychotropic activity.", 
    "46": "Urodynamic evaluation was performed in 75 patients with congenital neuropathic bladder. Concerning treatment the most important parameters were detrusor tone, detrusor activity and bladder outlet resistance. Based on these findings individual conservative therapy was applied. Reflux or dilatation of the upper urinary tract found in 26 children could be controlled by drugs or transurethral operations in 20, urinary diversion had to be done only 4 times. 26 children were selected for intensive treatment of incontinence; in about 50% satisfying urinary control was achieved. These results still need long-term observation. The main interest, however, was to postpone irreversible surgery and to gain time for possible better treatment in the future.", 
    "47": "Gastric acid output, blood-glucose, serum-gastrin and psychomotor-performance were measured in four healthy subjects one hour before and two hours after the intravenous injection of (a) 2ml saline, (b) 0.2 U/kg b.w. insulin, (c) 0.1 mg/kg b.w. bromazepam. Each subject underwent one experiment of each type. The study was layed out as a Latin-square and analysed accordingly. Gastric acid secretion was measured by means of intragastric titration and a telemetering capsule; blood-glucose and serum-gastrin levels as well as psychomotor performance as a measure of vigilance were determined in 15-minute-intervals. In the saline series (a), none of the four parameters showed any systematic variation. In series (b), a bimodal response of acid output to insulin, initial inhibition and subsequent stimulation was observed in all subjects. Serum-gastrin levels showed only a slight and transient increase in the first thirty minutes. Psychomotor performance decreased markedly with progressing hypoglycemia, and increased when glucose levels rose again. In the bromazepan series (c), acid output and psychomotor performance decreased and, after the first hour, increased almost parallely, while glucose and gastrin levels remained unchanged. In series (d), an additive effect of insulin and bromazepam occurred: acid output and psychomotor performance were lower than after insulin alone; peak acid secretion, maximal hypoglycemia and peak of serum-gastrin were shifted to the right. It is concluded that the lowered basal as well as insulin-stimulated acid secretion after bromazepam is due to the central effect of the drug, and that this effect is mediated to the gastric glands directly via autonomic nervous pathways without involving a release of endogenous gastrin.", 
    "48": "A double-blind random study compared the effects of lorazepam and pantopon an intra-muscular premedication in healthy women for uterine curettage (D & C). Anxiety, as assessed by a self-rating test by the patient and by a trained observer, showed a significant reduction at one and one-half hours after lorazepam and a smaller reduction after pantopon, which was not significant. Sedation was satisfactory with no significant difference between the two drugs in the change before and after the premedication. Lorazepam showed much more amnesia than pantopon (p less than 0.001). The patients who had lorazepam required higher doses of thiopentone for the operation, and this, in part, led to longer intervals in recovery times after lorazepam. However, it is suggested that lorazepam itself was partly responsible for the longer recovery. Pantopon was followed by more nausea, vomiting and headaches, than lorazepam. The intra-muscular injection of lorazepam hurt more patients than did pantopon, but other local complications were negligible and comparable in both groups. The results of this study show that lorazepam produces better reduction of anxiety and much more amnesia than pantopon, with comparable sedation and much less nausea and vomiting. The only disadvantage of lorazepam is the lack of analgesia and, therefore, the need for more anaesthesia during the operation. The conclusion is that lorazepam is a very satisfactory premedication and warrants more use as such.", 
    "49": "The cardiovascular effects of intravenously administered strychnine were studied in anesthetized and paralyzed dogs. Administration of strychnine in cumulative doses of up to 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg caused significant pressor, as well as positive inotropic and chronotropic, effects on the heart which were abolished by adrenergic blocking agents. The cardiovascular responses possibly were elicited by a central mechanism in contrast to the peripheral inhibitory action of strychnine on the sympathetic system. Diazepam caused a marked attenuation of the pressor response with only slight changes on the heart. A combination of diazepam and propranolol would appear to be a useful therapy in cases of strychnine poisoning showing marked cardiovascular excitation.", 
    "50": "Lorazepam, a new benzodiazepine, was compared with a standard surgical premedicant, pentobarbital. In a double-blind study in 128 patients, lorazepam, 2 and 4 mg, and pentobarbital, 50 and 100 mg, were given intravenously in a randomized sequence. Significant differences were noted; lorazepam was found to provide greater sedation, lack of recall, and greater antianxiety effect than pentobarbital. No significant adverse effects were noted following either drug. Vital signs remained stable.", 
    "51": "The development of circling behavior to apomorphine, amphetamine and L-Dopa in mice with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the dopaminergic nerve terminals in the striatum has been studied, and the effect of a range of neuroleptic and sedative drugs on this circling behaviour has been investigated. Circling induced by all the stimulant drugs was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by haloperidol, pimozide, chlorpromazine, metoclopramide and clozapine (in descending rank order of potency), but not by phenoxybenzamine, diazepam, promethazine and pentobarbitone sodium. This relatively simple animal model appears useful for screening neuroleptic drugs which may block striatal dopamine receptors, thereby predicting their potency to cause unwanted extrapyramidal effects but not their antipsychotic efficacy.", 
    "52": "A new method is described with which the effects of drugs on aggressive behaviour can be compared with their effects on general activity. Two groups of 3 male mice are housed in either half of a macrolon living cage which is divided down the middle by a non-transparent barrier. After 21 days the cage is placed on an activity meter and the dividing wall is removed. The ensuing fighting is scored by an observer and at the same time activity is measured using the activity meter. It was shown that aggression occurred mainly between groups with the dominant members doing most of the fighting. It appeared further that the two parameters measured--aggression and motor activity--respond differentially to the effects of standard psychotropic drugs. By this means it was possible to distinguish between the effects of chlorpromazine, pentobarbitone, chlordiazepoxide and d-amphetamine. In addition it was possible to confirm that an experimental compound, YG 19-256, which in other tests has been shown to inhibit aggressive behaviour without causing general sedation, also has selective anti-aggressive effects in this test. From these results it seems that the intergroup aggression test could well be useful in identifying different classes of psychotropic agents.", 
    "53": "Experiments were carried out in mice to investigate the influence of diazepam (DZP) on dexamphetamine, parachloro-N-methylamphetamine (pCMA), cocaine, morphine, trihexyphenidyl or (in MAOIs pretreated) reserpine induced motor hyperactivity. The interaction of DZP with these hyperactivities in which probably different biochemical central mechanisms are involved allows to construct a profile of action of DZP and to approach its mechanism of action. The locomotor hyperactivities induced by dexamphetamine, pCMA, morphine, cocaine were not reduced by DZP even by doses which decrease spontaneous locomotor activity; low doses of DZP enhance the hyperactivity induced by these compounds. Those induced by trihexyphenidyle or by reserpine (after MAOI) were reduced by DZP at doses which produce no decrease in spontaneous motor activity. Inasmuch as DZP at low doses potentiates the effects of 4 different substances, the results can hardly be satisfactorily explained neither by an interference of the benzodiazepine on the metabolism of the drugs or by a depression of the anxiogenic action of dexamphetamine. Even though it may be difficult to relate the antagonism of DZP on trihexyphenidyl- or on reserpine- (after MAOI) induced motor hyperactivity to the suggested anticholinergic and dopaminergic actions of DZP, these effects may partly be involved in the increase in locomotor hyperactivity induced by dexamphetamine, morphine, or cocaine. The observed effect of DZP on pCMA induced locomotor hyperactivity does not support a possible antiserotonine action often suggested to explain the effects of benzodiazepines in conflict situations.", 
    "54": "Various minor tranquilizers (benzodiazepines, barbiturates and meprobamate) induced an increase in the food intake of rats or mice. Drugs were injected i.p. 30 min before testing and the amount of food consumed during 30 min was recorded. The enhanced food consumption occurred when the animals were in a novel situation, in a situation which they had previously experienced, or in their home cage, in which they were used to eating in the daytime within 30 min. Studies with two benzodiazepines showed this effect to be maximal between 10 to 30 min after injection and to disappear 4 hrs after injection. Moreover, minor tranquilizers reduce the latency before eating of rats and mice tested in a new situation. These results and the observation of anti-anxiety drugs-induced hyperphagia in satiated animals suggest that: 1. The enhanced food consumption of a non familiar food in a novel situation induced by the minor tranquilizers could hardly be related only to their anti-anxiety action. 2. The existence of some inhibitory controls (endogenous satiety in daytime or satiety after recent absorption) is not essential for the action of the minor tranquilizers. 3. An increased motivation and a disruption in the food related behavior could possibly be an explanation for all the observed effects.", 
    "55": "Eight healthy volunteers were given single i.v. and oral doses of clonazepam (2 mg). The disposition curves after i.v. administration showed a biexponential decline and the data were applied to a two-compartment open model. The volume of distribution ((Vd)beta) ranged between 1.5 and 4.4 l/kg and the plasma half-life (t1/2) between 19 and 60 hours. Absorption after oral administration was fast, with peak plasma concentrations within 4 hours in all subjects. Five of the subjects received repeated oral doses of clonazepam 0.5 mg bid for 15 days. The plasma level during steady state (estimated as Cmin within the dose interval) could be predicted from the constants A, B, alpha and beta obtained in the single dose study with a coefficient of variation of 6%. The plasma half-lives after cessation of the subchronic dosing were of the same magnitude as after single doses.", 
    "56": "The case is reported of a 30-year-old patient whose fifth pregnancy (para 2, no living children) was complicated by the necessity of surgical removal of a stage II astrocytoma. Threatened premature labour was averted by the continuous administration of Prepar as from the 25th week of pregnancy and spontaneous vaginal delivery of a live-born infant was achieved in the 35th week. The development of repeated Jacksonian fits necessitated the administration of high doses of Valium (215 mg i.v. over a 50-nour period) both pre and intra partum, over and above the long-term antiepileptic maintenance therapy which the patient had received throughout the entire pregnancy. The fetal heart rate was not affected by Valium even at such high dosage. This case serves to illustrate that if the indication arises, high doses of Valium may be given before and during labour in conjunction with long-term antiepileptic drugs and Prepar apparently without adverse effects on the fetus or on uterine activity.", 
    "57": "The survival of rat skin allografts was significantly increased by repeated intraperitoneal injections of 2.5 mg Valium (diazepam) into hosts. In addition, in vivo pretreatment of the donor animals at this dose level decreased the intensity of the recipients' immune responses to skin allografts. In vitro exposure of skin grafts to Valium also prolonged allograft survival.", 
    "58": "The drug levels in postmortem specimens from 12 cases of poisoning involving methadone have been determined using a general toxicological extraction method. In 8 of the cases, drugs other than methadone were also found. The relevant known case histories are described.", 
    "59": "Elective cardioversion with titrated energy was carried out under diazepam anaesthesia (38 procedures) in 26 patients on digitalis who presented with supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias. Low energy shocks were given to establish the absence of latent digitalis intoxication, not unmasked by previous carotid sinus massage, and to restore sinus rhythm with the lowest possible energy discharge. In the absence of digitalis overdosage, titrated energy cardioversion restored sinus rhythm, at least temporarily, without dangerous ventricular arrhythmias. In one patient this precaution was neglected: a shock of 200 Ws provoked ventricular tachycardia. We present experimental and clinical evidence for the safety and effectiveness of titrated energy cardioversion in patients on digitalis.", 
    "60": "The effect of subacute pretreatment with diazepam was studied on the catecholamine content of the heart and adrenals of the rat. The results show that at all doses studied, subacute treatment with diazepam increases the catecholamine content of the adrenal glands and there is no change in the noradrenaline content of the heart and brain.", 
    "61": "Plasma levels of diazepam, N-demethyldiazepam and free oxazepam were measured gaschromatographically in ten healthy volunteers after 5 mg of diazepam perorally, intramuscularly and rectally (with three different kinds of suppositories). The best absorption of diazepam was found after peroral administration. After an intramuscular injection a delayed absorption with low plasma concentrations of diazepam was found. The basal component of a diazepam suppository seems to have a great effect on the rectal absorption of diazepam. Two of the three different kinds of diazepam suppositories caused higher plasma diazepam concentrations than the intramuscular injection of the drug. There were no great differences in the amount of the metabolites of diazepam after different kinds of administration. The subjective sedatory effect of diazepam lasted approximately as long as the fast distribution of diazepam from plasma took place. A very highly significant correlation between plasma concentration and subjective sedatory effect of diazepam after a single dose was found.", 
    "62": "Forty depressed in-patients for whom electro-convulsive therapy had been prescribed were rated before treatment on depression and anxiety scales. Side effects, post-operative agitation and retrograde memory impairment were assessed in each patient after each of several treatments. Results were compared when no tranquillizer was given and when either diazepam or haloperidol was administered intravenously immediately before the anaesthetic. It was found than when ECT was given without tranquillization, the incidence and severity of post-operative agitation and of side effects were significantly greater in those patients with a high level of anxiety before treatment. Both diazepam and haloperidol were found to be effective in subduing agitation and side effects in anxious, depressed patients, but with diazepam recovery time was longer.", 
    "63": "We report a fluorometric method for detecting diazepam, chlordiazepoxide, oxazepam, chlorazepate, and (or) their major metabolites in blood, urine, or gastric contents at low therapeutic concentrations. The drugs are first hydrolyzed to their respective benzophenones and converted to highly fluorescent 9-acridanones. Total benzodiazepines (parent plus metabolites) in blood and gastric contents are semiquantitatively evaluated and compared to results of gas-chromatographic determinations.", 
    "64": "The adrenergic neurohumors, when present locally in the myocardium in high concentrations, can produce a variety of cardiac arrhythmias which may develop into ventricular fibrillation (VF). Of particular importance are the arrhythmias observed immediately after experimentally induced acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Fatal VF, often seen to occur after acute coronary occlusion in the canine heart, may be related to the release of endogenous catecholamines, and a similar phenomenon might be responsible for sudden coronary death (SCD) in man. If adrenergic amines play a vital role in the development of arrhythmias and VF in response to acute myocardial ischemia, then it is conceivable that pharmacological means may be undertaken in an attempt to prevent the release of the adrenergic neurotransmitter or to prevent its arrhythmogenic actions by specific blockade of cardiac beta-adrenergic receptors. Drugs that have a central site of action and are capable of producing a decrease in sympathetic outflow might also play a valuable role in the prevention of arrhythmias and SCD. While the activity of the autonomic nervous system can modify the type and severity of arrhythmias resulting from AMI, existing pharmacological agents have little to offer in preventing the potential adverse effects of adrenergic stimulation without compromising the level of consciousness or cardiovascular function through the removal of adrenergic support to the heart. It would seem more beneficial to direct drug therapy at the electrophysiological defect in the myocardium in an effort to prevent arrhythmias and fatal VF. While currently available antiarrhythmic agents fail to achieve the desired effect, the recent evidence dealing with the quaternary ammonium derivatives of propranolol, lidocaine, and bretylium provides some hope for the future development of drugs with antiarrhythmic as well as antifibrillatory properties which may provide a therapeutic approach to the prevention of SCD.", 
    "65": "Studies evaluating the effects of diazepam (Valium) on psychomotor and cognitive functions are reviewed an integrated. The importance of the full and clear documentation of such drug effects lies in the wide usage of diazepam today for a variety of medical, psychiatric, and dental purposes. The various tasks used to assess drug effects were classified into six major groups based on apparent similarity of functions tapped. These groupings are: reflex speed; critical flicker fusion threshold; attention and vigilance; decision making; learning and memory; psychomotor performance. In all functions except simple reflexive responding; some indications of impaired performances were reported, the results being most definitive for the critical flicker fusion where even small doses lowered the threshold and for a slower performance on letter cancellation tasks. There appeared to be some interaction between diazepam and alcohol although the nature of this interaction is still unclear. Because of the extensive use of both of these drugs and the possibility of a synergistic or a potentiation effect, it is important that this area receive further study. It was suggested that future studies either control for or analyze the data to assess the possible interactive effects of diazepam with subject variables such as sex, personality type, and for population characteristics. These variables have been shown to affect responses in other studies and hence could also interact with cognitive and psychomotor performance. It was noted that most of the studies reviewed used normal, healthy, male volunteer subjects and may not be comparable to the clinical populations for whom the drug is typically prescribed."
