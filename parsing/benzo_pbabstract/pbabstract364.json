Neutrophils were stimulated with small amounts of the bacterial peptide N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-phenylalanine as a physiological, receptor-dependent stimulus. A new flow cytometry-based method capable of detecting the small amounts of H2O2 generated by neutrophils in a heterogeneous all-or-none response following submaximal stimulation with N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-phenylalanine was used. Propofol and thiopentone suppressed the respiratory burst significantly (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01) in therapeutic concentrations, while midazolam and methohexitone inhibited significantly (P < 0.01) only at concentrations greater than the therapeutic range. Impairment of the neutrophil response was primarily because of a reduction in the number of neutrophils participating in the respiratory burst and not of a proportional decrease of the fluorescence of all neutrophils.", 
    "1": "Twenty-three patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery with moderate hypothermic bypass, under opiate-benzodiazepine anaesthesia were investigated during the first 7 h following surgery. Patients with recent myocardial infarct (< 6 weeks), reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (< 40%) or requiring inotropic support were excluded. During the first 3 h after surgery, higher oxygen uptake and oxygen extraction ratio were found in shivering patients (n = 5) compared with non-shivering patients (N = 16). A significant relation was found between oxygen uptake and the oxygen extraction ratio for the pooled data (R = 0.80 and 0.87, in shivering and non-shivering patients, respectively) as well as for the individual patients. A weaker relation was observed between cardiac output and oxygen uptake. The lack of adequate circulatory compensation could be related to the myocardium, surgical trauma, cardioplegic arrest and to peripheral vasoconstriction.", 
    "2": "The present study was conducted to determine if the putative atypical antipsychotic olanzapine could be established as a discriminative stimulus in rats. Seven rats were successfully trained to discriminate olanzapine (0.5 mg/kg, IP) from vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure (mean number of acquisition sessions = 39.3). Generalization testing with olanzapine (0.0625-2.0 mg/kg) yielded an ED50 of 0.170 mg/kg (95% confidence interval = 0.118-0.246 mg/kg). The atypical antipsychotic clozapine (0.156-10.0 mg/kg) fully substituted for olanzapine in all rats at the 2.5 mg/kg dose with 99.0% drug-lever responding, in six rats at the 0.625 mg/kg dose, and in five rats at the 1.25 and 5.0 mg/kg doses (ED50 = 0.259 mg/kg, 95% confidence interval = 0.089-0.755 mg/kg). This study is the first demonstration that rats can be trained to discriminate olanzapine from vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination procedure and that the olanzapine discrimination cue generalizes to clozapine.", 
    "3": "The effects of oxazepam (30 mg), lorazepam (2 mg), and placebo on implicit and explicit memory were studied in two testing cycles, 100 and 170 min after drug administration. Thirty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to one of three groups (placebo, oxazepam, or lorazepam) in a double-blind, independent groups design. Drug groups were equivalent prior to drug administration on a variety of cognitive measures. Following drug administration, both oxazepam and lorazepam equally impaired performance on a cued-recall explicit memory task relative to placebo, at both testing cycles. Relative to placebo, lorazepam markedly impaired priming on a word-stem completion implicit memory task, at both testing cycles. Consistent with previous work, oxazepam failed to produce impairments in priming on the word-stem completion task at 100 min post-drug administration. However, oxazepam was found significantly to impair priming on this latter task relative to placebo, at close to theoretical peak plasma concentration (i.e., 170 min post-drug administration). Explanations for the observed detrimental effect of oxazepam on implicit memory task performance are considered, including: possible time-dependent effects related to the relative rate of absorption of these two benzodiazepines (BZs); and potential contamination of the implicit memory task by explicit memory strategies during the second testing cycle.", 
    "4": "With the increasing recognition of lithium's inadequacy as an acute and prophylactic treatment for many patients and subtypes of bipolar illness, the search for alternative agents has centered around the mood stabilizing anticonvulsants carbamazepine and valproate. In many instances, these drugs are effective alone or in combination with lithium in those patients less responsive to lithium monotherapy, including those with greater numbers of prior episodes, rapid-cycling, dysphoric mania, co-morbid substance abuse or other associated medical problems, and patients without a family history of bipolar illness in first-degree relatives. Nineteen double-blind studies utilizing a variety of designs suggest that carbamazepine, or its keto-congener oxcarbazepine, is effective in acute mania; six controlled studies report evidence of the efficacy of valproate in the treatment of acute mania as well. Fourteen controlled or partially controlled studies of prophylaxis suggest carbamazepine is also effective in preventing both manic and depressive episodes. valproate prophylaxis data, although based entirely on uncontrolled studies, appear equally promising. Thus, both drugs are widely used and are now recognized as major therapeutic tools for lithium-nonresponsive bipolar illness. The high-potency anticonvulsant benzodiazepines, clonazepam and lorazepam, are used adjunctively with lithium or the anticonvulsant mood stabilizers as substitutes or alternatives for neuroleptics in the treatment of manic breakthroughs. Preliminary controlled clinical trials suggest that the calcium channel blockers may have antimanic or mood-stabilizing effects in a subgroup of patients. A new series of anticonvulsants has just been FDA-approved and warrant clinical trials to determine their efficacy in acute and long-term treatment of mania and depression. Systematic exploration of the optimal use of lithium and the mood-stabilizing anticonvulsants alone and in combination, as well as with adjunctive antidepressants, is now required so that more definitive treatment recommendations for different types and stages of bipolar illness can be more strongly evidence based.", 
    "5": "In in vitro receptor binding and synaptosomal uptake experiments the (+)-enantiomer of tramadol (CAS 148229-78-1) is specific for the mu-opioid receptor site and for the serotonin (5-HT) carrier, whereas the (-)-enantiomer (CAS 148229-79-2) has a higher affinity to the noradrenaline (NA) transporter. The antinociceptive active tramadol metabolite O-demethyltramadol (M1) shows a pronounced mu-selectivity. With respect to in vitro receptor binding experiments, the affinity of (+)-M1 to this opioid receptor subtype is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of (+)-tramadol and approximately 1/10 that of morphine. Tramadol and M1 (and the enantiomers thereof) have no affinity to other receptor or uptake sites tested, e.g. 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, NMDA (ligand: MK801), dopamine (DA)-D1, DA-D2, benzodiazepine, muscarine M1 and DA uptake (Ki > or = 2 x 10(-5) mol/l). Ex vivo neurotransmitter determinations show that tramadol (46.4 mg/kg i.p.) elevates the DA metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid and enhances DA release in definite brain areas. The active enantiomer of the racemic tramadol is the (+)-enantiomer. (+)-Tramadol significantly enhances the turnover rate of DA. The enantioselective elevation of DOPAC by (+)-tramadol is antagonized by naloxone (2 x 5 mg/kg i.p.). Morphine (21.5 mg/kg i.p.) enhances the turnover of NA in definite brain areas. Neither the NA-specific uptake inhibition nisoxetine (31.6 mg/kg i.p.) nor tramadol (or its (+)- and (-)-enantiomers) have any influence on the NA turnover. Tramadol reduces the levels of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Morphine enhances, whereas tramadol reduces, 5-HT utilisation in the brain areas under assay. The 5-HT specific uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (20 mg/kg i.p.) shows the same influence on 5-HT turnover as tramadol. The results indicate that tramadol enhances DA turnover via an opioid mechanism. The interaction with the noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission is clearly different from that of an opioid receptor agonist and closely resembles that of NA and 5-HT uptake inhibitors.", 
    "6": "This study compared the treatment response of four groups of psychiatrically diverse opiate-dependent, methadone maintenance patients receiving drug counseling. The four groups were patients with no other nonsubstance abuse axis I psychiatric diagnoses (OP only; N = 65), patients with lifetime major depression (DEP; N = 60), patients with both antisocial personality disorder and lifetime major depression (APD + DEP; N = 35), and patients with only APD (APD only; N = 24). Patients were assessed at intake, during treatment, and 7 months after treatment admission. No statistically significant differences were found among the groups in treatment retention/attendance. Few significant group differences were revealed during-treatment urine screens, except that barbiturate use was more common for the APD only group. The APD only group also had significantly more positive urine screens for benzodiazepines than the other three groups at 7-month follow-up. All groups reported considerable improvement in problem level at 7 months compared with admission status. The APD only group reported fewer gains in legal and employment problems than the other groups but reported greater improvement in the drug area. Thus, there was some limited support for a prior finding, based on individual psychotherapy, that the treatment response of APD only patients was inferior to that of APD + DEP patients or non-APD patients.", 
    "7": "The effects of four logarithmically increasing doses of intravenous diazepam or placebo on plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) were determined in benzodiazepine-naive patients with panic disorder (PD) or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and in healthy controls. Plasma HVA was measured at baseline and 3 min after the first and fourth doses of diazepam/placebo. Mean baseline plasma HVA levels were significantly lower in PD patients compared with GAD patients and controls. Although plasma HVA levels decreased significantly with time in all groups, there was no diazepam effect. This study suggests that low dopaminergic activity may occur in a subset of anxious patients (PD), and that diazepam does not significantly affect dopaminergic activity as measured by plasma HVA in humans.",

The receptors used were alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors, 5HT-1, 5HT-1A, 5HT-2, opiate, adenosine-1, benzodiazepine, Ca+2 channel, sulphonylureas, dopamine-1, dopamine-2, muscarinic, histamine-1, Na+/K+ ATPase, GABAA and GABAB.

    "9": "Male hamsters that have been repeatedly defeated by larger, aggressive males subsequently flee from, rather than attack, nonaggressive male intruders that are introduced into their home cages. We have referred to this generalization of flight in response to nonaggressive intruders as \"conditioned defeat\" (CD). In an attempt to reverse CD pharmacologically, diazepam (DZP) was administered to hamsters at two different time points relative to CD acquisition and subsequent response generalization tests, which involved the exposure of subjects to nonaggressive intruders (NAIs). In Experiment 1, subjects were given a single injection of one of 4 doses of DZP (0, 2, 6, or 20 mg/kg) immediately following CD acquisition. Twenty-four hours later, contrary to expectations, subjects that had received the 6 mg/kg dose displayed elevated flight responses in the presence of an NAI. Flight responding declined over days except in subjects that received the highest dose. In the second experiment, hamsters were administered a single injection of either 0, 2, or 6 mg/kg DZP just prior to a response generalization test occurring 24 h following CD training. Flight responses to the NAIs were again exaggerated in subjects that were given the 6 mg/kg dose, an effect that persisted several days without further drug administration. The present findings suggest the possibility that benzodiazepines can potentiate fear responses under certain stressful conditions.", 
    "10": "This study investigated the ability of the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, to alter the expression of physical dependence on pentobarbital. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made physically dependent on pentobarbital by continuous. IP, infusion of escalating doses of pentobarbital for 12 days. In Experiment 1, pentobarbital dependent rats received either vehicle or Ro 15-4513, in doses of 5, 10, or 15 mg/kg, IP, periodically during the pentobarbital abstinence period. As expected, Ro 15-4513 produced a significant, dose-dependent, exacerbation of withdrawal signs in the pentobarbital dependent rats. In Experiment 2, either vehicle or Ro 15-4513, at a dose of 15 mg/ kg, was administered, IP, once daily during the 12 days of continuous pentobarbital infusion. During the subsequent pentobarbital abstinence period it was noted that the withdrawal signs were significantly reduced in the rats receiving the daily administration of Ro 15-4513. It is hypothesized that the benzodiazepine inverse agonist, Ro 15-4513, may inhibit the development of physical dependence on pentobarbital through an opposing action on the GABA-A receptor.", 
    "11": "Two experiments investigated a possible role of nitric oxide (NO) in chlordiazepoxide (CP)-induced feeding in nondeprived male ICR mice in independent groups designs. Experiment 1 demonstrated a dose-related decrease in CP-induced solid food intake over a 60-min test period with increasing dose (10, 25, and 50 mg/ kg SC) of the NO-synthase (NOS) inhibitor, L-NG-nitro arginine (L-NOARG), reaching statistical significance at 10 mg/kg L-NOARG when compared to vehicle control. Identical doses of L-NOARG failed to significantly affect normal feeding in vehicle treated mice. In Experiment 2, initial pretreatment with L-arginine (500 and 1000 mg/kg IP) partially or completely restored the feeding inhibitory action of a challenge dose (25 mg/kg SC) of L-NOARG; D-arginine (500 mg/kg IP) was ineffective, thus supporting a stereospecific action of arginine. Arginine isomers did not differentially affect intake in normal feeding animals. These results implicate involvement of NO in CP-induced hyperphagia; they are consistent with and extend research linking NO and ingestive behaviors.", 
    "12": "The development of neuroactive steroids as anticonvulsant medications may be useful both as a primary treatment and as an adjuvant to other anticonvulsants. They may be limited, however, by sedative and ataxic side effects. In the current study, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one and alfaxalone, two prototypic neuroactive steroids, were shown to potentiate the ability of flurazepam to antagonize electrically precipitated tonic hindlimb extension in mice at doses that by themselves had little antiseizure efficacy. While alfaxalone alone lacked motor incoordinating effects at a dose (18.0 mg/kg) that potentiated the antiseizure efficacy of flurazepam, the same dose of 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one possessed both the ability to potentiate flurazepam's anticonvulsant effect and disrupt mouse rotorod performance. The data suggest that allosteric interactions that have been described in vitro between neuroactive steroids and other modulators of the GABAA receptor complex may have relevance for the intact animal. Finally, the data also suggest that neuroactive steroids could be developed as short-lived adjuvant antiseizure medications in certain critical situations (e.g., medication-refractory status epilepticus). However, the motor incoordinating effects resulting from the combination of neuroactive steroids and flurazepam suggest that their usefulness as adjuvant medications in the chronic therapy of seizure disorders may be limited.", 
    "13": "There is increasing evidence suggesting angiotensin II (AII) may inhibit memory formation in a range of conditioned avoidance and habituation learning tasks in rodents. We were interested to determine if AII might also play an inhibitory role in spatial learning. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which block the formation of AII from AI, improve acquisition and/or retention of basal performance inhibited by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine, in conditioned avoidance and habituation tasks. In hooded Wistar rats, over 5 days of training in a water maze neither the ACE inhibitor, ceranapril 5 and 50 micrograms/kg/day, nor the ACE inhibitor, ramipril 2 and 10 mg/kg/day, altered the increase in path length produced by administration of scopolamine 0.75 mg/kg/day. In probe trails (without platform), on the last day of training, ceranapril 50 micrograms/kg produced a 35% further deterioration in performance in the scopolamine-treated rats (P < 0.02). Administration of the substrate, renin, that leads to AII formation, did not alter water maze performance over 5 days of training. The angiotensin receptor antagonist, losartan, has been shown to improve basal and scopolamine-impaired performance in a habituation task and reverse the inhibition in long-term potentiation produced by diazepam. However, neither losartan 10 and 30 mg/kg/day nor ramipril 2 and 10 mg/kg/day reversed diazepam-impaired (3 mg/kg/day) acquisition of the spatial memory task over 5 days of training. These studies suggest AII does not inhibit spatial learning in rats in the constant platform position water maze task nor does it mediate the inhibitory effects of scopolamine or diazepam in this task.", 
    "14": "Recent studies have implicated the habenula in modulating states of arousal and chronic responses to stress. We examined whether lesion of the habenula efferent pathway, the fasciculus retroflexus (FR), at either 3 (P3) or 70 (P70) days of age affects stress-related anxiety (elevated plus-maze test) and activity levels (open-field test) in rats tested as adults. Both P3- and P70-lesioned rats showed chronically elevated plasma levels of corticosterone. Rats receiving FR lesions as neonates (P3) exhibited greater open arm avoidance on the elevated plus-maze than controls 2 months postoperatively, suggesting a heightened state of anxiety. In contrast, P70-lesioned rats behaved similarly to controls on the plus-maze, but showed increased locomotion and increased grooming in the open field, effects not observed in P3-lesioned rats. When an additional stressful condition was imposed (5 days of social isolation plus 24 h food deprivation) before testing, both FR-lesion groups showed an attenuation of the normal behavioral responses (decreased open-arm entries/time in open arms, increased freezing). The effects of FR lesions on activity and behavioral indices of anxiety may be due to disruption of lateral habenular projections to dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmentum and/or projections to regions containing high concentrations of benzodiazepine receptors, the median and dorsal raphe and dorsal periaqueductal gray. Behavioral differences observed as a function of lesion age suggest differential capabilities of P3- and P70-lesioned rats to utilize compensatory mechanisms to correct FR lesion-induced deficits.", 
    "15": "1. We have examined the metabolism of diazepam by ten human cytochrome P450 forms (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 3A4 and 3A5) expressed in HepG2 cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus system. 2. Among the P450 forms tested, diazepam was significantly demethylated by CYP2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4 and 3A5, with 2C19 exhibiting the highest rate at concentrations < 0.1 mM, and hydroxylated only by the latter three enzymes, with 3A5 being the most active. The N-demethylation activity of diazepam by 2C19 at a concentration of 20 microM was six times of that by 3A4. However, that by 2C9 was detected at only a trace level. 3. CYP2C19, 3A4 and 3A5 of the ten human P450s catalysed the 3-hydroxylation of nordiazepam, and 2B6, the 2C subfamily and the 3A subfamily catalysed the N-demethylation of temazepam. CYP3A4 exhibited the highest activity of nordiazepam 3-hydroxylation and temazepam N-demethylation. 4. Diazepam N-demethylation by human liver microsomes correlated with diazepam 3-hydroxylation, but not S-mephenytoin 4'-hydroxylation. 5. Our results suggest that in the human liver, the metabolism of diazepam to nordiazepam is mediated by CYP3A4, which has been reported as the most abundant P450 form in human liver as well as 2C19, which has been reported as a polymorphic enzyme.", 
    "16": "Agitation is a nonspecific constellation of symptoms seen in a variety of psychiatric disorders, ranging from psychotic exacerbations in patients with schizophrenia to behavioral disturbances associated with organic factors. Its treatment must be individualized and based on the etiology of the psychomotor disturbance. Certain categories of drugs are broadly effective. Sedation and control of disruptive and dangerous behavior are the initial goals in stabilizing acutely agitated patients. Sedation is necessary during the lag period before antipsychotic and mood-stabilizing drugs take effect. Barbiturates and chlorpromazine, initially given to control agitated behavior, are largely supplanted by higher-potency antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and, recently, a combination of these two agents. Agitation is generally controlled within hours to days, whereas remission of affective or psychotic symptoms often requires weeks to months. Once remission is obtained, sedation is no longer desired and may be a barrier to optimal patient function and compliance. Thus, for long-term treatment, strategies are used to minimize sedation, such as reducing dosages, changing administration to bedtime, or adding antidepressants or stimulants where appropriate.", 
    "17": "Benzodiazepines have a checkered history in the United States; public and professional attitudes about them have ranged from their being wonder drugs in the 1970s to being virtually purged from many formularies as addictive and dangerous in the 1980s. The attitude today is that they are useful for specific indications. In the last 20 years they have been investigated as adjunctive agents to conventional antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines may be effective in schizophrenia because stress is one mediator of relapse in these patients. In addition, inhibition of dopamine neurotransmission through gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing activity may provide a direct antipsychotic effect. As monotherapy or adjuncts to antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines produced antipsychotic effects in schizophrenia in approximately 50% of controlled trials. Although there is no particular benzodiazepine of choice, low-potency compounds with long elimination half-lives are recommended. Adverse effects of concern include sedation and cognitive impairment, behavioral disinhibition, exacerbation of psychotic symptoms, and the potential for dependence, withdrawal, and abuse. The recent arrival of atypical antipsychotic drugs has significantly slowed research and interest in benzodiazepines in schizophrenia beyond their initial beneficial sedative effects for acute psychotic episodes.",

The EEG parameter of total number of waves/second (recorded from FP1-F3 and FP2-F4 electrodes) in the frequency of 12-30 Hz was used to quantify effect. Flumazenil appeared to prolong the elimination half-life of midazolam significantly (p < 0.05). Theophylline (aminophylline) also appeared to prolong the half-life of flumazenil (p < 0.05). Despite considerable variability, flumazenil resulted in reversal of sedation at concentrations achieved by routine dosing. Resedation was apparent for all subjects following flumazenil reversal. Only partial reversal of sedation by theophylline was achieved by an aminophylline dose of 1-2 mg/kg.",

    "25": "Disulfiram is an aldehyde dehydrogenase inhibitor that is widely used as an adjunctive agent in the treatment of patients with severe chronic alcoholism. Recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies of local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (ICMRglc) and benzodiazepine receptor binding in alcoholic patients have shown regional cerebral abnormalities; however, some of the patients were studied while receiving disulfiram, which could influence the biochemical processes under investigation. In a retrospective investigation, we examined the influence of disulfiram administration on the results of PET studies of ICMRglc and benzodiazepine receptor binding and neuropsychological tests of cognition and executive function in patients with severe chronic alcoholism. [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose was used to measure ICMRglc in 48 male patients, including 11 receiving and 37 not receiving disulfiram in therapeutic doses. [11C]Flumazenil was used to measure benzodiazepine receptor binding in 17 male patients, including 3 receiving and 14 not receiving disulfiram. All patients studied with FMZ were also examined with fluorodeoxyglucose. PET studies of ICMRglc revealed significantly decreased global values in the patients receiving disulfiram compared with those not receiving disulfiram. PET studies of benzodiazepine receptor binding revealed decreased flumazenil influx and distribution volume in patients receiving disulfiram. The neuropsychological tests demonstrated no differences between the two groups of subjects. The findings suggest that disulfiram may influence the results of PET studies of glucose metabolism and benzodiazepine receptor binding.", 
    "26": "GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors in the medial septum modulate the activity of cholinergic neurons that innervate the hippocampus. Injection of benzodiazepine (BDZ) agonists into the medial septum impairs working memory performance and decreases high-affinity choline transport (HAChT) in the hippocampus. In contrast, intraseptal injection of the BDZ antagonist flumazenil increases HAChT and prevents the memory deficits induced by systemic BDZs. The present studies attempted to further characterize the behavioral effects of medial septal injections of flumazenil to an endogenous negative modulator of the GABAA/BDZ receptor complex, diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were cannulated to study the effects of intraseptal injections of these BDZ ligands on spatial working memory, anxiety-related behaviors in the elevated plus maze, and on general locomotor activity. Intraseptal flumazenil (10 nmol/0.5 microliter) produced a delay-dependent enhancement of DNMTS performance after an 8-h, but not a 4-h, delay interval. This promnestic dose of flumazenil had no effect on locomotor activity and did not produce changes in measures of anxiety on the plus maze. Intraseptal injection of DBI had no effect (8 nmol/0.5 microliter) or slightly impaired (4 nmol/0.5 microliter) DNMTS radial maze performance following an 8-h delay, without producing changes in locomotion or plus maze behavior. These data demonstrate that flumazenil has a unique profile of activity in enhancing working memory following intraseptal injection.", 
    "27": "The contribution of muscarinic receptor subtypes to biliary control mechanisms is unclear. We investigated stimulated gallbladder function and release of associated hormones during M1-receptor blockade. Following a double-blind, randomized, crossover protocol, healthy volunteers each received placebo and telenzepine, a selective M1-receptor antagonist, as 2-h background infusion. Gallbladder contraction (by ultrasonography), bilirubin output, and release of cholecystokinin (CCK) and pancreatic polypeptide (PP) were assessed during increasing doses of endogenous (intraduodenal nutrient) and exogenous (hormonal) stimulation. All parameters were stimulated in a dose-dependent manner on placebo days. Contractile and secretory responses to low-dose caerulein (CCK analogue) were inhibited by 60-80% under telezepine, whereas high-dose (supraphysiological) stimulation overrode this effect. Similar inhibition was achieved during nutrient stimulation. CCK plasma levels rose during endogenous and exogenous stimulation but were unaffected by M1 blockade, whereas stimulated PP release was completely inhibited (> 100% decrease), reflecting suppressed vagal tone. Selective M1-receptor blockade inhibits the physiological response of the gallbladder in humans; this effect cannot be attributed to suppressed CCK release. Our findings support the hypothesis that CCK acts at the gallbladder via cholinergic nerves under physiological conditions. Viewed with our previous observations, nonselective antagonism of biliary function by atropine is primarily mediated through M1 muscarinic pathways.", 
    "28": "The effects of single doses of chlorpromazine (100 mg) and lorazepam (0.5, 1 and 2 mg) were compared with placebo in a battery of tests of information processing, working and semantic memory. Peak saccadic velocity was used to provide a precise and reliable measure of sedation and its results were found to be consistent with those using visual analogue rating scales. Chlorpromazine 100 mg was equally sedative to lorazepam 2 mg. Lorazepam caused dose-dependent deterioration in performance in many of the memory tests, whereas an equally sedative dose of chlorpromazine did not. These data therefore support the view that benzodiazepine-induced amnesia is not secondary to sedation. Peak saccadic velocity has considerable advantages over visual analogue scales as a measure of sedation, since it is objective and has a demonstrated low coefficient of variation. It is suggested that saccadic eye movement measurement will permit considerably more reliable and precise separation of the sedative and amnestic effects of drugs and will allow investigation of amnesia caused by clinically relevant doses of psychotropic drugs.", 
    "29": "This study examined the effect of the neuroactive steroid 3 alpha, 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (alpha-THDOC) as compared to the benzodiazepines diazepam and midazolam and the barbiturate phenobarbital on the number of rearing events and the number of steps ascended in the mouse staircase test. The benzodiazepines, phenobarbital and alpha-THDOC all reduced rearing activity at doses that did not affect climbing. The rearing-suppression effect of the benzodiazepines and alpha-THDOC, but not of phenobarbital, was blocked by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. It appears that, although such neuroactive steroids, like barbiturates, bind to distinct sites within the chloride ion channel of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor complex, alpha-THDOC behavioral activity is modulated by the benzodiazepine recognition site.", 
    "30": "Guinea pigs possess central 5-HT1D receptors similar to humans but different from rats and mice. In order to study the role of this receptor on animal behaviour, it may be of interest to develop a paradigm measuring affective states in the guinea pig. Therefore we assessed the effects of a variety of psychotropic drugs on guinea pig pup isolation calls. Anxiolytic compounds such as the benzodiazepine receptor agonists diazepam and alprazolam, the full 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan, and alcohol reduced isolation calling by the guinea pig pup. Moreover, mixed antidepressant/anxiolytic compounds like the 5-HT uptake inhibitors fluvoxamine and clomipramine or the MAO-inhibitor clorgyline as well as the antidepressant NA uptake inhibitors desipramine and maprotiline suppressed vocalizations. The 5-HT1D/1A receptor agonist 5-CT was also very effective in reducing separation calls. Remarkably, the partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists buspirone and BMY 7378 did not affect calling. The neuroleptic haloperidol, the psychostimulant d-amphetamine, the putative anxiogenics DMCM and m-CPP and the putative anxiolytics ondansetron and CI-988 had no effect on isolation calls of guinea pig pups. We propose this paradigm could be helpful to assess behavioural effects of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs in a species different from rat or mouse, and in which the effects of 5-HT1D receptor ligands may possibly be established.", 
    "31": "Effects of oral alprazolam (0.5 and 1 mg) and lorazepam (2 mg) on sympathetic adrenomedullary activity and sedation were studied during supine rest, mental load (Color Word Test, CWT) and active standing (OCT), in 12 male volunteers in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design. Compared to placebo, alprazolam significantly increased subjective sedation, reduced plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations and mean blood pressure (MBP) during supine rest, and attenuated plasma adrenaline responses during the CWT and the OCT; these effects during the CWT and OCT appeared to be dose-dependent. In comparison with lorazepam (2 mg), alprazolam (1 mg) showed reduced MBP levels during supine rest, whereas lorazepam showed a higher heart rate level during supine rest, a reduced plasma noradrenaline response to the OCT and a performance deterioration to the CWT. There were no differences between alprazolam (1 mg) and lorazepam regarding subjective sedation. Although the benzodiazepines were similar regarding their increase of sedation, alprazolam and lorazepam induced differential effects on sympathetic adrenomedullary activity during rest and stress, whereby suppression of adrenomedullary activity may be specific for alprazolam.", 
    "32": "The purpose of this review was to establish in vivo apparent pA2 and pKB values for antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of benzodiazepine ligands, and to compare these values to those obtained from other behavioral procedures. Articles were chosen from the Medline data base from January 1976 to August 1995. This literature consisted of studies with flumazenil (Ro 15-1788) as the antagonist, as well as other benzodiazepine ligands (beta-carbolines, CGS 9896, CGS 8216). The dose which occasioned 50% of the maximal response (ED50) was obtained from values estimated from the graphs presented in each article. These ED50 values were used to conduct apparent pKB and apparent pA2 analyses. Apparent pA2 values for antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of diazepam in rats were the following (antagonist, pA2, slope): flumazenil, 4.7, -1.5; beta-CCE, 4.0, -3.0; beta-CCtB, 5.0, -2.2. The apparent pA2 value for CGS 8216 antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of diazepam in rats was 5.74, -2.22 (reported in Shannon and Davis 1984). The mean apparent pA2 value for flumazenil antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of diazepam in rhesus monkeys was 6.55, with a mean slope of -1.42. Analysis of baboon data from Ator and Griffiths (1986) revealed apparent pKB values for flumazenil antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of lorazepam that were lower than the pKB values for either zopiclone or CL 218,872. Analyses of the pKB data also revealed the following: no effect of route of administration (rat, PO versus IP; baboon, PO versus IM), no effect of pretreatment time (grouped into two categories: 10-20 min and 40-70 min, in rats and non-human primates), and a species effect (pKB values for rats were reliably lower than either non-human primates or pigeons, rhesus monkeys were lower than baboons). The apparent pA2 and pKB values obtained in the present review were similar across behavioral assays, except that, in squirrel monkeys, flumazenil pKB values for antagonism of benzodiazepine-induced decreases in schedule-controlled behavior were lower than pKB values obtained from drug discrimination studies. This review provides apparent pA2 values for antagonism of the discriminative stimulus effects of benzodiazepine ligands and provides evidence from pKB analyses consistent with functional heterogeneity of benzodiazepine receptors in vivo.", 
    "33": "Electronic properties located on the atoms of a molecule such as partial atomic charges as well as electronegativity and polarizability values are encoded by an autocorrelation vector accounting for the constitution of a molecule. This encoding procedure is able to distinguish between compounds being dopamine agonists and those being benzodiazepine receptor agonists even after projection into a two-dimensional self-organizing network. The two types of compounds can still be distinguished if they are buried in a dataset of 8323 compounds of a chemical supplier catalog comprising a wide structural variety. The maps obtained by this sequence of events, calculation of empirical physicochemical effects, encoding in a topological autocorrelation vector, and projection by a self-organizing neural network, can thus be used for searching for structural similarity, and, in particular, for finding new lead structures with biological activity.", 
    "34": "Various psychotropic drugs are commonly combined with antipsychotic agents. Such combinations can induce pharmacodynamically based, presumably additive, beneficial (e.g. sedative or mood-altering) effects or adverse autonomic, cardiac depressant and CNS intoxicating effects. Clinically significant interactions also arise through competition with or induction of hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, particularly the CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 isozymes by which most antipsychotics are oxidised. Such pharmacokinetic interactions can elevate circulating concentrations of antipsychotics (both typical agents and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine) to potentially toxic ranges, which may lead to increased risks of adverse effects. Such interactions occur particularly with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor antidepressants. Metabolic interactions that lead to lesser increases in antipsychotic concentrations may arise in combining these drugs with other antidepressants, benzodiazepines or propranolol. In contrast, most anticonvulsants, except valproic acid (sodium valproate), induce the oxidative metabolism of antipsychotics and can lower their plasma concentrations to potentially subtherapeutic levels, with unpredictable increases after their discontinuation. Since simultaneous use of multiple psychotropic agents is increasingly common, special caution is required to avoid untoward consequences of interactive adverse effects due to drug interactions, which can sometimes be severe or life-threatening.",

Primary care physicians must recognize and treat a variety of alcohol-related and alcohol-induced problems: alcohol withdrawal, alcohol-related seizures, delirium tremens, malnutrition, concomitant illness, poisoning, trauma, and lack of social support. This paper focuses an recognizing and managing acute alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "36": "Development of tolerance and dependence has been reported to occur upon chronic administration of traditional benzodiazepines (BZDs). We compared the effect of chronic treatment with abecarnil, a beta-carboline derivative with high affinity for central BDZ receptors, and diazepam, the BDZ prototype, in mice. After acute administration, abecarnil was as potent and effective as diazepam in protecting from bicuculline-induced convulsion. The time-course analysis of two peak equieffective doses of abecarnil (1.9 mg/kg p.o.) and diazepam (2.7 mg/kg p.o.) showed a similar duration of action. The anticonvulsant potency of diazepam was reduced in mice given chronic diazepam (25 mg/kg p.o., 2 times a day for 17 days). No tolerance to abecarnil was apparent when the drug was administered for the same period using a comparable dose (20 mg/kg p.o.). Severe symptoms of precipitated withdrawal were observed upon administration of the BDZ partial inverse agonist Ro 15-3505 in mice treated chronically with diazepam but not abecarnil. In mice made tolerant to diazepam, maximum [3H]-flumazenil binding sites were reduced in both cerebral cortex (-50%) and cerebellum (-55.2%). No changes in [3H]-flumazenil binding were measured in chronic abecarnil-treated mice. These data indicate that abecarnil possesses a very low tolerance/dependence liability and does not affect BZD receptor density after chronic administration.", 
    "37": "Serotonergic behavioral responses, effects on motor activity and core temperature, and binding properties of the novel putative anxiolytic amphetamine derivative (+/-)1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-ethylthio-phenyl)-2-aminopropane (ALEPH-2), were examined in rodents in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying its anxiolytic-like effect. After peripheral administration in rats, ALEPH-2 induced some symptoms of the serotonergic syndrome, e.g. forepaw treading and flat body posture. Additionally, a decrease in motor activity was observed. No significant effects on the number of head shakes were observed after injection, although high inter-subject variability was noted. Higher doses of ALEPH-2, in the range exhibiting anxiolytic properties (4mg/kg), elicited significant hypothermia in mice. The affinity of the drug for 5-HT2A/2C receptors ([3H]ketanserin sites) was in the nanomolar range (Ki = 173 nM), whereas for 5-HT1A, benzodiazepine sites, and GABAA receptors, the affinity was micromolar of lower. Based on these results the mechanism of action and the anxiolytic-like properties of ALEPH-2 are discussed.", 
    "38": "The recommended treatment of human chloroquine poisoning is diazepam and adrenaline but neither has been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. We investigated whether diazepam provided any added benefit over barbiturate anaesthesia and whether the protective effect of catecholamines in chloroquine poisoning was mediated through alpha or beta receptor stimulation. Rats, anaesthetised with thiobutobarbitone had a continuous intravenous infusion of 3 mg/kg/min of chloroquine. This caused a steady decline in pulse rate and blood pressure. When diazepam (3 mg/kg iv) was administered 5-10 min later, heart rates decreased at a faster rate (P = 0.005), blood pressure was consistently lower (P = 0.01) and there was a shorter time to arrhythmias and death (P < 0.05). Adrenergic agents were given by titration to attempt to maintain mean blood pressure > 75 mmHg. Compared with the phenylephrine (selective alpha agonist) group, the group treated with isoprenaline (selective beta agonist) had faster heart rates which decreased more slowly (P < 0.0001), higher blood pressure (P = 0.005) and longer time to arrhythmias and death (P = 0.005). Adrenaline and noradrenaline had intermediate effects. Thus beta agonist effect appears to explain the beneficial effects of adrenaline but alpha agonist activity may be harmful. This animal work suggests that a combination of barbiturate anaesthesia and isoprenaline may be better than the diazepam and adrenaline in combatting the effects of chloroquine.", 
    "39": "A 38-year-old male was found comatose at home with an empty package of Rohypnol (2-mg tablets, 10 per package) near the body. Many other drugs, which had recently been stolen from a pharmacy, were also found. The judge in charge of the investigation of the stolen pharmaceuticals asked our laboratory to determine if the subject was a chronic user of flunitrazepam, leading our laboratory to develop a procedure for the detection of this benzodiazepine in human hair. The method involved decontamination of hair samples with dichloromethane, incubation in Sorenson buffer (pH 7.6) in the presence of diazepam-d5 used as internal standard, direct liquid-liquid extraction with diethylether-chloroform (80:20, v/v), derivatization with heptafluorobutyric anhydride and analysis by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry in the negative chemical ionization mode of detection. Flunitrazepam and its major metabolite, 7-amino-flunitrazepam, were both detected. The concentrations determined in the proximal hair segment were 89.5 and 24.0 pg/mg for flunitrazepam and 7-amino-flunitrazepam, respectively.", 
    "40": "Several methods are reported for the simultaneous determination of diazepam and pyridoxine: two graphical methods (zero-crossing and derivative quotient spectra); and two numerical methods (multiple linear regression and partial least-squares regression). The methods have been applied in the concentration ranges 1.4-4.0 micrograms ml-1 diazepam and 4.0-12.0 micrograms ml-1 pyridoxine. The accuracy and precision of the methods have been determined and they have been validated by analysing synthetic mixtures containing the two drugs in variable proportions. The methods were also applied to the determination of diazepam and pyridoxine in pharmaceutical preparations. The analytical results were quite good in all cases.", 
    "41": "The basolateral amygdala has a strong intrinsic inhibitory system mediated by GABAA receptors and is the main site of the anxiolytic actions of benzodiazepines. In an effort to identify the anatomical substrates for these transmitter and drug actions, immunohistochemical techniques were used to analyse the neuronal localization of the beta 2 and beta 3 receptor subunits of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex in the rat and monkey basolateral amygdala. The overall pattern of GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor immunoreactivity was very similar in both species. The density of the immunoreactivity in the neuropil varied in different nuclei of the basolateral amygdaloid complex. In both species the neuropil of the lateral nucleus exhibited the most robust staining. Immunoreactivity was also seen in neuronal perikarya and dendrites where it was localized to the cytoplasm and/or surface membrane. The cell type with the strongest immunoreactivity was a subpopulation of small non-pyramidal neurons that had numerous thin dendrites. Other larger non-pyramidal neurons were also stained. Pyramidal neurons in the rat and monkey basolateral amygdala exhibited light to moderate perikaryal staining that varied in different nuclei. The results of this study indicate that the pattern of GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor immunoreactivity in the neuropil of the rat and monkey basolateral amygdala closely resembled the distribution of benzodiazepine receptors localized in previous radioligand autoradiographic studies. The finding of intense immunoreactivity in subpopulations of non-pyramidal neurons suggests the existence of disinhibitory mechanisms which may be important for the activation of basolateral amygdaloid projection neurons.", 
    "42": "The in vivo concentration-anticonvulsant effect relationships of six benzodiazepines, midazolam, clonazepam, oxazepam, flunitrazepam, diazepam and clobazam were quantified in individual rats and correlated with the affinity to the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. Furthermore the interaction between midazolam and the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil was characterized. All benzodiazepines exhibited a nonlinear relationship between concentration and anticonvulsant effect without ceiling of the effect at higher concentration. The potency of most benzodiazepines was similar with values of the EC250, between 0.067 +/- 0.01 mg. l-1 for midazolam and 0.21 +/- 0.03 mg. l-1 for diazepam. The EC250,u of clobazam was 2.8 +/- 0.9 mg. l-1. These values were considerably larger than the Ki for binding at the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. No correlation was observed between EC250,u and Ki. Antagonism of the anticonvulsant effect of midazolam by flumazenil was associated with a remarkable change in the concentration-anticonvulsant effect relationship. Analysis of these data on basis of a composite model provided evidence for two separate effects of which only one is antagonized by flumazenil. The anticonvulsant effect at low midazolam concentration was characterized on basis of the sigmoid E maximal effect pharmacodynamic model. The value of the EC50,u was 0.0086 +/- 0.0013 mg. l-1 which is similar to the Ki for binding at the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex. The second more pronounced anticonvulsant effect occurred at higher concentration and was described by an exponential function. The findings of this study indicate that the effect of benzodiazepines against seizures induced by cortical stimulation in vivo cannot be fully accounted for by an interaction at the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex.", 
    "43": "We have reported recently that seizure model and experimental protocol may influence the anticonvulsant tolerance and the withdrawal characteristics of benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor ligands so that predictions on tolerance and dependence liability of novel drugs should be based on a battery of chronic experiments. In the present study, we evaluated two novel BDZ receptor ligands, i.e., NNC 14-0185 \u00bf3-(3-cyclopropyl-5-isoxazolyl)-6-fluoro-5-morpholino-imidazo [1,5-a]quinazoline\u00bf and NNC 14-0189 \u00bf3-(5-cyclopropyl-1, 2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-7-fluoro-5-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-imidazol[1 , 5-a]quinazoline\u00bf, which seem to act as partial agonists at BDZ receptors, in two seizure models by using different experimental approaches to assess the tolerance and dependence liability. In one approach, mice were chronically treated with either NNC 14-0185 or NNC 14-0189 for 4 weeks at doses which were about equipotent to increase the threshold for myoclonic seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. Anticonvulsant activity was determined several times during the period of chronic treatment as well as up to 2 weeks after termination of treatment in the same group of animals per drug. The threshold for electroshock-induced tonic seizures was used as a second seizure model in separate groups of mice. In another approach, the drug treatment protocols were the same, but the seizures were induced only twice during the 4-week period of treatment to reduce the number of trials which could lead to \"learned\" tolerance. In additional groups of mice, the seizure thresholds were only determined before and after the period of treatment to assess whether repeated seizure induction during chronic treatment affect the development of dependence. Only moderate tolerance was seen with the two drugs in the pentylenetetrazole seizure threshold experiments and with NNC 14-0185 in the electroshock-induced tonic seizure threshold experiments, whereas NNC 14-0189 did not lose any activity in the latter model during chronic treatment. There was no indication for a significant involvement of learned tolerance during repeated drug testing. With respect to the withdrawal symptoms, i.e., measures of physical dependence-inducing properties of the two drugs, moderate but significant decreases in the seizure threshold were seen in the withdrawal period. Both in terms of tolerance- and dependence-inducing properties and adverse effects seen during chronic treatment in mice, NNC 14-0185 and NNC 14-0189 seem to offer clear advantages compared to the more traditional BDZ receptor ligands.",

All four drugs lost anticonvulsant activity during the chronic treatment in the different models and experimental approaches, without indication for a significant involvement of learned tolerance. However, marked protocol-related differences were seen with respect to withdrawal symptoms, i.e., measures of physical dependence-inducing properties of the different drugs. For instance, the pentylenetetrazole model was more sensitive than the electroshock-induced tonic seizures model to detect significant decreases in the seizure threshold in the withdrawal period. Both in terms of tolerance- and dependence-inducing properties and adverse effects seen during the chronic treatment in mice, abecarnil did not seem to offer clear advantages compared to the more traditional BDZ receptor ligands. The data substantiate the importance of study design for obtaining predictable informations on the tolerance and withdrawal characteristics of BDZ receptor ligands.", 
    "45": "We evaluated the impact of conditioned stress on outflow of dopamine in the rat prefrontal cortex. Exposure of rats to an environment associated with aversive stimuli-foot shock enhanced outflow of dopamine in a similar way as seen during the conditioning session when foot shocks were applied. Diazepam (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased outflow of dopamine and, when given in a dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 2.5 mg/kg, decreased enhanced dopamine outflow evoked by conditioned stress. On the other hand, ipsapirone (10 mg/kg, but not 2.5 mg/kg) and buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) enhanced basal outflow of dopamine. When ipsapirone (10 mg/kg) and buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) were given to rats exposed to conditioned stress, the stress-evoked elevation in dopamine outflow was abolished. Ipsapirone in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg was ineffective in the stress paradigm tested. It is concluded that conditioned stress in vivo enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission in the rat prefrontal cortex, this effect being attenuated by diazepam, a classic anxiolytic drug, and by such novel anxiolytics as ipsapirone and buspirone, which operate via serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors. Although ipsapirone and buspirone blocked stress-induced enhancement of dopamine outflow, this effect seems to result from their influence on the basal outflow of dopamine. Differential effects of diazepam and 5-HT1A agonists on basal and stress-induced alterations in dopamine outflow are discussed in terms of their possible effectiveness in various types of general anxiety disorders.",

    "47": "The use of in vitro hepatic microsomal models as a method of studying the biotransformation of xenobiotics can be complicated by the insolubility of a lipophilic substrate. Addition of solvent to an in vitro system is an approach used to increase solubility of such substrates, but solvents may interact with the microsomal enzymes and cause changes in the kinetic parameters. This study focused on the solvents polyethylene glycol-400 (PEG) and acetone and their influence on the human microsomal in vitro biotransformation of the antineoplastic agent tamoxifen (TAM). The antianxiety agent alprazolam (ALP), a verified P450 3A substrate, was also studied. TAM is a nonpolar drug that is metabolized to two oxidative metabolites, N-desmethyltamoxifen (DMT) and 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH-TAM), by cytochrome P450 isoforms. DMT is formed primarily by 3A isoforms, and the pathway(s) responsible for 4-OH-TAM formation are unknown. Biotransformation of ALP is mediated by P450 3A isoforms, which form alpha-hydroxyalprazolam (alpha-OH-ALP) and 4-hydroxyalprazolam (4-OH-ALP). Both PEG and acetone at 5% of the total microsomal incubation volume were found to solubilize TAM in the in vitro system. However, both solvents had an effect on the P450 mediated metabolism of ALP and TAM. For ALP, PEG was a noncompetitive inhibitor of alpha-OH-ALP (mean Ki = 2.06%) and 4-OH-ALP (mean Ki = 2.37%) formation. Acetone stimulated the production of alpha-OH-ALP, but had no apparent influence on 4-OH-ALP formation. The solvent's influence on TAM metabolism varied. PEG decreased the amount of DMT formed by the microsomes as compared to the system containing no solvent (control); however, 4-OH-TAM formation in the presence of PEG was 146-226% of controls. Samples containing acetone produced smaller quantities of both DMT (39-63%) and 4-OH-TAM (45-69%) as compared to controls. Since PEG and acetone increased the solubility of TAM in the incubation buffer but inhibited or accelerated enzymatic reactions compared to buffer alone, actual solubility in buffer was not a determinant of the rate of TAM metabolism. TAM appeared to be taken up into the microsomal fraction, making it available for biotransformation by the P450 isoforms. Although solvents may increase the solubility of nonpolar agents in aqueous systems, careful evaluation of the effects of solvent on metabolite formation, as compared to buffer controls, is needed in order to properly evaluate an in vitro metabolic model.",

Two minutes later, 50 mg thiamylal was administered followed by 25 mg increments until verbal response and eyelash reflex disappeared and blood pressure decreased to a level less than that of preinduction. Tracheal intubation was performed with 0.15 mg.kg-1 vecuronium. Blood pressure and heart rate were monitored during induction. Optimal induction was defined as a systolic blood pressure one minute after intubation within +/- 20% of that before induction.",

The effects of a new kind of volatile anaesthetic, sevoflurane (Sev), on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-gated chloride current (Icl) in single neurones dissociated from the rat hippocampal CA1 area were examined using the nystatin perforated patch recording configuration under the voltage-clamp condition. All drugs were applied with a rapid perfusion system, termed the \"Y-tube' method. 2. When the concentrations were higher than 3 x 10(-4) M, Sev, itself, induced an inward current (ISev) at a holding potential (VH) of -40 mV. The concentration-response curve of ISev was bell-shaped, with a suppressed peak and plateau currents at high concentrations (above 2 x 10(-3) M). The reversal potential of ISev (ESev) was close to the theoretical Cl- equilibrium potential, indicating that ISev was carried mainly by Cl-. 3. ISev was reversibly blocked by bicuculline (Bic), an antagonist of the GABAA receptor, in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 7.2 x 10(-7) M. But ISev was insensitive to strychnine (Str), an antagonist of the glycine receptor. 4. At low concentrations (between 3 x 10(-4) and 10(-3) M), Sev markedly enhanced the 10(-6) M GABA induced current (IGABA) but reduced the IGABA with accelerating desensitization accompanied by a \"hump' current after washout at high concentrations (higher than 2 x 10(-3) M). 5. Sev, 10(-3) M potentiated the current induced by low concentrations of GABA (between 10(-7) and 3 x 10(-6) M) but reduced the current induced by high concentrations (higher than 10(-5) M) of GABA with a clear acceleration of IGABA desensitization. 6. Sev, like pentobarbitone (PB), pregnanolone (PGN) or diazepam (DZP), potentiated the 10(-6) M GABA-induced response without shifting the reversal potential of IGABA. 7. ISev was augmented by PB, PGN, or DZP at concentrations that maximally potentiated IGABA, suggesting that Sev enhanced IGABA at a binding site distinct from that for PB, PGN, or DZP. 8. It is concluded that Sev acts on the GABAA receptor complex mimicking the GABA-induced chloride current at high concentrations. At low concentrations, Sev enhances GABA-gated chloride current at a binding site independent of the allosteric modulator sites of barbiturates, benzodiazepines or neurosteroids. The reversible potentiation of the inhibitory GABAA receptor-mediated Cl- current may result in the depressing of postsynaptic excitability and may, at least in part, underlie the anaesthetic action of Sev.", 
    "57": "Insomnia may be periodic and transient, as caused by situational stress, or persistent, as caused by a chronic sleep disorder. Physicians can gain much information concerning the type, probable cause, onset, and duration of insomnia through history taking. A sleep diary may reveal helpful information, and input from the patient's sleeping partner can also be valuable. Complicating disorders, such as heart failure, prostatism, or depression, should be sought and specific treatment prescribed. Chemical dependency, too, requires appropriate treatment. These measures, institution of good sleep-hygiene practices, and behavior modification may resolve sleeplessness. The primary indication for use of hypnotic agents is transient sleep disruption caused by acute stress. When an agent is chosen, onset of action, metabolism, and side effects should be considered, especially in elderly patients. Addictive agents should not be given to patients with substance abuse problems. If insomnia persists, evaluation at a sleep-disorder center is recommended to facilitate design of an appropriate therapeutic regimen.",

After CT scan performed on the day of his second hospitalization, the patient became aphasic. EEG showed continuous high-voltage semirhythmic sharp and slow waves in the left posterior temporal and parietal regions consistent with status epilepticus (SE). Intravenous lorazepam and a loading dose of phenytoin were administered.",

ICa and IK were elicited by progressively depolarizing cells from -40 to +40 mV, and from -90 to +60 mV, respectively. The peak amplitude and time-dependent inactivation rate of ICa and IK were measured before, during, and after the administration of equimolar concentrations (5, 30, or 60 microM) of etomidate, propofol, or midazolam.", 
    "64": "Exposure to etomidate, propofol, and midazolam produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of ICa. Midazolam was the most potent intravenous anesthetic; at 60 microM, etomidate, propofol, and midazolam decreased peak ICa by 16 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM), 33 +/- 5%, and 47 +/- 5%, respectively. Etomidate, propofol, and midazolam given in a 60-microM concentration decreased IKto by 8 +/- 3%, 9 +/- 2%, and 23 +/- 3%, respectively. IK1 was decreased by 60 microM etomidate and midazolam by 20 +/- 6% and 14% +/- 5%, respectively. Propofol had no effect on IK1.",

Effects of anesthetics on ICa were significantly greater compared with their effects on K+ currents. These findings suggest that the negative inotropic actions of etomidate, propofol, and midazolam are related, at least in part, to decreased ICa. Some effects, such as IK inhibition, may partially antagonize effects of decreased ICa. Indeed, the final effect of these intravenous anesthetics on myocardium will be the sum of these and other sarcolemmal and intracellular effects.",

In a multivariate model, cocaine abuse before delivery was shown to be an independent predictor of preoperative diastolic hypertension (F = 10.6, P = 0.01). Similarly, univariate analysis showed that immediately after intubation, diastolic blood pressure was significantly higher among parturients who used cocaine (99 +/- 13 mmHg v. 87 +/- 18 mmHg; P = 0.02). In contrast, epidural anesthesia was associated with hypotension significantly more often among cocaine-abusing parturients (44% vs. 10%; P = 0.04). A higher rate of perioperative wheezing was reported among patients who abused cocaine (16% vs. 6%; relative risk = 2.7); this finding, however, did not persist in multivariate analysis.

    "70": "Recently, a number of studies have provided evidence suggesting that CCK and 5-HT interact in the control of food intake. However, the majority of these studies have relied on the administration of exogenous CCK to investigate potential interactions. The aim of the present study was to focus on the potential role of endogenous CCK in 5-HT-CCK interactions. Our prediction was that the CCKA antagonist, devazepide, alone would potentiate the hyperphagic effect of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, in free-feeding rats. The results showed that devazepide, at a dose that had no intrinsic effect (1.0 mg/kg), did not enhance the hyperphagic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (100 and 300 micrograms/kg). This suggests that when serotonergic inhibitory activity is reduced by 5-HT1A-receptor stimulation, there is no compensatory increase of endogenous CCK activity to excite 5-HT neurons and thereby inhibit food intake.", 
    "71": "Free-fed rats were shifted from brief access to 32% sucrose (5 min per day for 3 days) to 4% sucrose (5 min per day for 2 days) 8 separate times. During preshift, rats given access to 32% sucrose licked less than rats given access to 4% sucrose (the opposite of what is typically obtained with deprived rats). The shift from 32% sucrose to 4% sucrose resulted in a further decline in lick frequency, suggesting a successive negative contrast effect. Degree of negative contrast diminished with repeated downshifts. Administration of chlordiazepoxide (CDP), 8 mg/kg, on either the first or second postshift day completely offset the effect of reward reduction. The diminution of contrast and the pattern of effectiveness of CDP differed from results obtained with food-deprived rats. The reduction of contrast by CDP was interpreted as being separate from an appetite-stimulation effect of the drug. Finally, all groups showed tolerance to the sedative effects of CDP in an open-field test, a result consistent with that obtained with deprived rats.",

Analyses were performed on liver (five sites), lung (four sites), spleen, psoas muscle and kidney (left and right), blood (peripheral and torso), vitreous, pericardial fluid, bile and, urine as well as residual gastric contents. Standard analytical techniques and instrumentation gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer and high performance liquid chromatography (GC-MS and HPLC) were used throughout. These case studies confirm previous studies of an animal and human cadaver model of gastric diffusion, in that in several instances there was drug accumulation in the left posterior margin of the liver and, to a lesser extent, the left basal lobe of the lung. Uncontrollable variables, such as postmortem interval, refrigeration before autopsy, and position of the body appear to influence significantly drug accumulation in a specific site. We suggest that autopsy sampling techniques should be standardized on blood taken from a ligated peripheral (preferably femoral or external iliac) vein, and liver from deep within the right lobe.",

    "80": "The human gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor alpha 4 subunit was recently cloned and characterized pharmacologically using radioligand binding techniques. These studies suggested that alpha 4 subunits confer a novel diazepam-insensitive binding site. To further investigate the pharmacology of the alpha 4 subunit, we expressed human alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L subunit combinations in oocytes and compared the expression and pharmacology of these receptors with alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L, beta 2 gamma 2L, and other possible binary subunit combinations. Apparent GABA affinity was 2-3-fold higher for alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L than for alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L receptors. Functional modulation of receptors by benzodiazepine-site ligands and other classes of allosteric modulator were assayed over a broad concentration range (0.01-100 microM) on currents that were 10% of the maximum GABA response. Diazepam (0.01-1 microM) did not modulate GABA responses at alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L receptors, whereas it increased alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L responses by approximately 110%. Bretazenil (0.01-1 microM), a benzodiazepine partial agonist, induced higher efficacy modulation of alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L receptors (approximately 83%) than of alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L (approximately 25%). The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil (0.1-10 microM) unexpectedly potentiated alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L responses up to approximately 41%, and the benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist Ro15-4513 (1 microM) potentiated alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L responses by approximately 63%. Two other benzodiazepine-site ligands, CGS-9895 and methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, had qualitatively similar effects at alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L and alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2L. Modulators such as pentobarbital, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one, mefenamic acid, and loreclezole also induced similar potentiation at both subtypes of receptor. The pharmacology conferred by the alpha 4 subunit was similar to that conferred by the alpha 6 subunit, to which it shows highest levels of homology, but the two subunits differ in sensitivity to the beta-carboline methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate. Properties of the alpha 4-containing receptors are consistent with diazepam-insensitive binding sites found in cerebral cortex and other forebrain structures. Characterization of these receptors should further our understanding of mechanisms underlying the behavioral effects of GABA modulators and help in the design of drugs with improved, or novel, therapeutic profiles.", 
    "81": "We characterized modulation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-evoked responses of the diazepam-insensitive alpha 4 beta 2 gamma2 and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 recombinant GABAA receptors. The partial agonist bretazenil potentiated the responses of both receptors with similar dose dependence but with a higher maximal enhancement at the alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor. The bretazenil-induced potentiation was reduced by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. At a high concentration (10 microM), flumazenil was a weak potentiator of the GABA response. The partial agonist imidazenil was inactive. The imidazobenzodiazepine inverse agonist Ro 15-4513, which is known to bind with high affinity to the alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor, potentiated the GABA responses of the alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor subtypes with similar dose dependence over the concentration range of 0.1-10 microM. Methyl-6, 7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline, a beta-carboline inverse agonist, had a similar potentiating effect when tested at a concentration of 10 microM. The alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor-mediated currents had equal sensitivities to furosemide and Zn2+ ions, both of which reduced the GABA-evoked responses. The alpha 6 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor but not the alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor exhibited a low level of spontaneous activity in the absence of GABA; this resting current could be directly potentiated by Ro 15-4513, methyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline, bretazenil and flumazenil and was blocked by picrotoxin. Thus, although the alpha 4 beta 2 gamma 2 receptors are insensitive to benzodiazepine binding site full agonists, such as diazepam, they can be modulated by certain ligands acting as partial and inverse agonists at diazepam-sensitive receptors and thereby contribute to the respective pharmacological profiles.", 
    "82": "We compared the inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) by 1-[2',5'-bis-O-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-beta-D-ribofuranosyl]-3'- spiro-5\"-(4\"-amino-1\", 2\"-oxathiole-2\",2\"-dioxide)-3-ethylthymine (TSAOe3T) and the nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) 9-aminonevirapine (9-NH2N). Both compounds were equally effective against p51/p66 heterodimeric RT RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity, although TSAOe3T was a much better inhibitor of the p51/p51 and p66/p66 RT homodimers. Inhibition by TSAOe3T and 9-NH2N combinations was essentially additive. TSAOe3T did not protect either free RT or the RT-template/ primer-deoxynucleoside triphosphate ternary complex from irreversible inactivation by the photolabel 9-azidonevirapine. Slight protection of the RT-template/primer binary complex was noted, but only at high TSAOe3T/photolabel ratios. Analysis of RT polymerization product profiles under both continuous- and single-processive cycle conditions showed that 9-NH2N prevented the formation of full-length product with a corresponding accumulation of smaller polymerization products. In contrast, all products formed in the absence of inhibitor, including full-length product, were noted in TSAOe3T-inhibited reactions, albeit at reduced levels. TSAOe3T thus inhibits HIV-1 RT by a different mechanism than NNRTI such as nevirapine. Our data suggest that TSAOe3T and 9-NH2N interact differently with HIV-1 RT, perhaps by binding to distinct sites on the enzyme.", 
    "83": "Benzodiazepines are routinely used by the rectal route for the treatment of acute epileptic seizures: if a benzodiazepine was absorbed from nasal administration this could provide a more acceptable alternative to rectal administration. Nineteen children (age range 7 months to 14 years) with intractable epilepsy were chosen. The EEG's showed unequivocal epileptic activity persisting during the recording. The midazolam was dripped slowly into the anterior nares. Fifteen had a positive response, a dramatic improvement in their EEG or cessation of fits. Drug induced beta activity occurred in 14 children. The mean time to appearance of beta activity was 111.5 secs (SD = 95.3 secs). The reduction in spike count pre and post midazolam was statistically significant (p < 0.01). The improvement in EEG background was also statistically significant. Midazolam is absorbed via the i.n. route. With the dosages used it suppressed epileptic activity and produced an improvement in EEG background. The children and parents found the method acceptable. This is the first study to use the i.n. route for anti-convulsant drugs.", 
    "84": "We have investigated the existence, molecular composition, and benzodiazepine binding properties of native cortical alpha1-alpha3 gamma-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptors using subunit-specific antibodies. The co-existence of alpha1 and alpha3 subunits in native GABAA receptors was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis of the anti-alpha1- or anti-alpha3-immunopurified receptors and by immunoprecipitation experiments of the [3H]zolpidem binding activity. Furthermore, immunodepletion experiments indicated that the alpha1-alpha3 GABAA receptors represented 54.7 +/- 5.0 and 23.6 +/- 3.3% of the alpha3 and alpha1 populations, respectively. Therefore, alpha1 and alpha3 subunits are associated in the same native GABAA receptor complex, but, on the other hand, these alpha1-alpha3 GABAA receptors from the cortex constitute a large proportion of the total alpha3 population and a relatively minor component of the alpha1 population. The pharmacological analysis of the alpha1- or alpha3-immunopurified receptors demonstrated the presence of two different benzodiazepine binding sites in each receptor population with high (type I binding sites) and low (type II binding sites) affinities for zolpidem and Cl 218,872. These results indicate the existence of native GABAA receptors possessing both alpha1 and alpha3 subunits, with alpha1 and alpha3 subunits expressing their characteristic benzodiazepine pharmacology. The molecular characterization of the anti-alpha1-anti-alpha3 double-immunopurified receptors demonstrated the presence of stoichiometric amounts of alpha1 and alpha3 subunits, associated with beta2/3, and gamma2 subunits. The pharmacological analysis of alpha1-alpha3 GABAA receptors demonstrated that, despite the fact that each alpha subunit retained its benzodiazepine binding properties, the relative proportion between type I and II binding sites or between 51- and 59-61-kDa [3H]Ro15-4513-photolabeled peptides was 70:30. Therefore, the alpha1 subunit is pharmacologically predominant over the alpha3 subunit. These results indicate the existence of active and nonactive alpha subunits in the native alpha1-alpha3 GABAA receptors from rat cortex.",

Except for 20.25 nmol/kg/h telenzepine, all tested doses of telenzepine and/or loxiglumide decreased the 180-min integrated bicarbonate response to tryptophan by 55 to 119%. Except of 20.25 nmol/kg/h telenzepine and/or 2.5 mg/kg/h loxiglumide, all tested doses of telezepine and/or loxiglumide inhibited the tryptophan stimulated integrated pancreatic protein responses by 54 to 88%. While telenzepine mainly inhibited the bicarbonate and protein response to the lower loads of tryptophan (0.37-1.1 mmol/h), loxiglumide decreased the response to all loads of tryptophan. The inhibition evoked by the combinations of telenzepine and loxiglumide was not significantly greater than that by single infusion of either drug. The CCK plasma levels basally and in response to tryptophan were not significantly altered by telenzepine and/or loxiglumide. These findings indicate that (1) both enteropancreatic cholinergic reflexes and the hormone CCK are mediators of the protein response to intraduodenal trytophan (2) enteropancreatic cholinergic reflexes are probably the dominant mediators of the response to low amounts of tryptophan, whereas CCK is the major mediator of the response to high loads of tryptophan, (3) the two mediators seem to act independently of each other, and (4) the release of CCK by intestinal trytophan is not influenced by telenzepine or loxiglumide.",

Injection of Xenopus oocytes with rat cortical or nigral synaptosomes has now been shown to result in the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor-mediated Cl- currents. Electrophysiological characterization of the responses of these receptors to GABA and other agents revealed that they were incorporated into the oocyte membrane and that they retained their original pharmacological properties, such as sensitivity to Cl- channel blockers, benzodiazepines, and general anesthetics. These results suggest that this approach to the expression of heterologous proteins in Xenopus oocytes may facilitate the study of native synaptic proteins derived from brain tissue.", 
    "102": "It has been shown previously that unsaturated free fatty acids (FFAs) strongly enhance the binding of agonist benzodiazepine receptor ligands and GABAA receptor ligands in the CNS in vitro. To investigate the selectivity of this effect, recombinant human GABAA/benzodiazepine receptor complexes formed by different subunit compositions (alpha x beta y gamma 2, x = 1, 2, 3, and 5; y = 1, 2, and 3) were expressed using the baculovirus-transfected Sf9 insect cell system. At 10(-4) M, unsaturated FFAs, particularly arachidonic (20:4) and docosahexaenoic (22:6) acids, strongly stimulated (> 200% of control values) the binding of [3H]flunitrazepam ([3H]FNM) to the alpha 3 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor combination in whole cell preparations. No effect or small increases in levels of unsaturated FFAs on [3H]FNM binding to alpha 1 beta x gamma 2 and alpha 2 beta x gamma 2 receptor combinations were observed, and weak effects (130% of control values) were detected using the alpha 5 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor combination. The saturated FFAs, stearic and palmitic acids, were without effect on [3H]FNM binding to any combination of receptor complexes. The hydroxylated unsaturated FFAs, ricinoleic and ricinelaidic acids, were shown to decrease the binding of [3H]FNM only if an alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 receptor combination was used. Given the heterogeneity of the GABAA/ benzodiazepine receptor subunit distribution in the CNS, the effects of FFAs on the benzodiazepine receptor can be assumed to vary at both cellular and regional levels.",

We determined the optimal scan time for obtaining such a map and assessed the errors of the map. SPET and blood data from six healthy volunteers and five patients were used. A three-compartment kinetic model was employed in simulation studies and analyses of actual data. The simulation studies suggested that, in the normal brain, the scan time at which a single SPET image best represented the relative receptor binding was 3.0-3.5 h post-injection. This finding was supported by actual data from the volunteers. The simulation studies also suggested that the optimal scan time was not greatly changed by the variability of the input functions, and that the error in the SPET image contrast in the vicinity of the optimal scan time was not increased by changes in the tracer kinetics in the entire brain. The SPET image contrast in the patients at 3.0 h post-injection agreed well with the reference receptor binding estimated by kinetic analysis, with a mean error of 3.6%. These findings support the use of a single SPET image after bolus injection of [123I]iomazenil as a relative map of benzodiazepine receptor binding. For this purpose, a SPET scan time of 3.0-3.5 h post-injection is recommended.", 
    "104": "1. Multiple injections of METH (4 x 10 mg/kg, i.p.) at room temperature (23 degrees C) produced a significant depletion of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites DOPAC and HVA in striatum at 24 and 72 hr, and 1 and 2 wk. 2. Three days post 4 x 10 mg/kg METH at 23 degrees C, an 80% decrease in striatal dopamine (DA) occurred, while the same dose at 4 degrees C produced only a 20% DA decrease, and 4 x 20 mg/kg METH at 4 degrees C produced a 54% DA decrease. A similar pattern in the decreases of the DA metabolites DOPAC and HVA was observed after METH administration. 3. At 23 degrees C (+)MK-801 completely blocked while phenobarbital (40% decrease) and diazepam (65% decrease) partially blocked decreases in striatal DA produced by 4 x 10 mg/kg METH. Decreases in DOPAC and HVA were similar to the decreases in DA after METH and antagonists. 4. Multiple injections of METH (4 x 10 mg/kg, i.p.) at room temperature also produced a significant depletion of serotonin (5-HT) in striatum at 24 and 72 hr, and 1 and 2 wk. The depletion of 5-HT metabolite 5-HIAA was found only at 72 hr post-dosing. 5. This depletion of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA at room temperature was blocked either by changing the environmental temperature to 4 degrees C, or by pretreatment with MK-801, diazepam and phenobarbital after METH treatment. 6. Therefore, these data suggest that drugs that block METH toxicity, such as haloperidol (D2 receptors), pentobarbital and phenobarbital (chloride channels) and MK-801 (NMDA/glutamate receptors), do not necessarily have the same mechanism of action but may either induce hypothermia or block induction of hyperthermia. 7. In summary, these studies show that in the mouse, environmental temperature greatly influences METH neurotoxicity, and that the protective effects of compounds such as diazepam, phenobarbital and MK-801 may be mediated by blockade of METH-induced hyperthermia.",

We show here that use of threshold models can provide a satisfactory solution to both these problems.", 
    "107": "In the present communication we have investigated the pharmacological properties of the GABAA receptor from adult (3 months old) and aged (24 months old) Wistar rat prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is implicated in cognitive functions and stress and both processes seem to be altered during aging. These changes could be mediated by modifications in the GABAA receptor properties. Our results indicated the absence of generalized age-related modifications on the pharmacological properties of the GABAA receptor from prefrontal cortical membranes. Saturation experiments using the non-selective benzodiazepine [3H]flunitrazepam revealed that neither the Kd values or the Bmax were modified during aging. Moreover, Cl 218 872 displacement of [3H]flunitrazepam showed no age-related modifications on either the Kis or the relative proportion between the Type I and Type II benzodiazepine binding sites. Therefore, the benzodiazepine binding sites are well preserved in aged prefrontal cortex. On the other hand, saturation experiments using the GABA agonist [3H]muscimol demonstrated in the Bmax of the low affinity [3H]muscimol binding sites in aged rats (4.3 +/- 0.8 pmol/mg protein vs. 2.3 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein in adult and aged rats, respectively). However, no age-dependent modifications were observed in the allosteric interaction between GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites. These results demonstrate that the benzodiazepine binding sites and the GABA binding sites of the GABAA receptor complex from rat prefrontal cortical membranes are differentially affected by the aging process.", 
    "108": "A high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the simultaneous determination of flunitrazepam and four metabolites, desmethylflunitrazepam (DMF), 7-aminodesmethylflunitrazepam (7-NH2DMF), 7-aminoflunitrazepam (7-NH2F) and 3-hydroxyflunitrazepam (3-OHF), in serum is described. The method involves a simple extraction from alkalinized plasma (pH 9.5) into diethyl ether-chloroform (80:20, v/v). Prazepam was used as an internal standard for the quantification of the five compounds. Separation was achieved with a 10 microns RSil CN column (300 x 3.9 mn I.D.). The detection wavelength was set at 242 nm. The limits of detection ranged from 2.5 to 5 micrograms/l with a limit of quantification of 10 micrograms/l for all analytes.", 
    "109": "The intravenous general anaesthetic propofol (2,6-di-isopropylphenol) is frequently combined with a benzodiazepine. There are clinical reports of synergism between these two agents for induction of general anaesthesia. To investigate a possible mechanism of this synergistic interaction between propofol and benzodiazepines, the effect of propofol and flurazepam on GABAA receptor function was examined in Xenopus oocytes expressing recombinant alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L and alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2L receptor constructs. Potentiation of GABA receptor-activated current by low (1-10 microM) concentrations of propofol together with flurazepam (0.25-0.5 microM) was significantly greater than predicted by an additive response. Isobolographic analysis indicated a strong synergistic interaction between propofol and flurazepam at either of the receptor constructs examined. In contrast, the cyclopyrrolone derivative zopiclone, which produced a similar facilitation of GABA receptor-activated current compared to flurazepam, produced a less than additive potentiation when combined with propofol. Flurazepam significantly decreased the EC50 concentration of propofol for potentiation of GABA responses. Thus, flurazepam, in addition to facilitating GABA receptor activity on its own, also increases on its own, also increases the apparent affinity of the GABAA receptor complex to propofol, resulting in a greater than expected potentiation by the combination of propofol plus flurazepam.", 
    "110": "The present series of experiments were designed to examine a potential role for central descending pain facilitatory systems in mediating secondary hyperalgesia produced by topical application of mustard oil and measuring the nociceptive tail-flick reflex in awake rats. Topical application of mustard oil (100%) to the lateral surface of the hind leg produced a facilitation of the tail-flick reflex that was significantly reduced in spinal transected animals. Mustard oil hyperalgesia was also inhibited in animals that had received electrolytic lesions in the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Intrathecal (i.t.) administration of the non-selective cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor antagonist proglumide (10 micrograms) prior to mustard oil application completely blocked both the lesser and greater hyperalgesic responses observed in spinal transected and normal animals, respectively, and produced an inhibition of the tail-flick reflex in normal animals. Administration of the selective CCKB receptor antagonist L-365260 i.t. dose-dependently inhibited mustard oil hyperalgesia (ID50 = 364 ng) at doses approximately 5-fold less than the CCKA receptor antagonist devazepide (ID50 = 1760 ng). Similar to spinal proglumide, microinjection of the neurotensin antagonist SR48692 (3.5 micrograms) into the RVM blocked mustard oil hyperalgesia and inhibited the tail-flick reflex. These data suggest that secondary hyperalgesia produced by mustard oil is mediated largely by a central, centrifugal descending pain facilitatory system which involves neurotensin in the RVM and spinal CCK (via CCKB receptors). The inhibition of the tail-flick reflex produced by mustard oil following spinal or supraspinal administration of receptor antagonists suggests concurrent activation of central descending facilitatory and inhibitory systems.", 
    "111": "Prolonged seizures have long been known to be associated with cell injury and cell death in brain. Such seizure-related neuronal injury has been assumed to be mediated by glutamate, the same excitatory amino acid in the central nervous system which propagates the seizure itself. Elevated extracellular concentrations of glutamate have not been demonstrated in brain during seizures in experimental animals. However, these studies have not been performed during status of a duration adequate to induce cell injury, a time when the putative neurotoxins might be demonstrable. We therefore induced status epilepticus (recorded both with conventional surface EEG and with deep electrodes in the area of greatest vulnerability, the piriform cortex) and lengthened the time of status to the point of cell death. Seizures were induced with intravenous kainic acid, and prolonged by injecting the NMDA antagonist AP-7 into the substantia nigra. Microdialysis probes were introduced into the piriform cortex of one hemisphere to assess the presence of extracellular glutamate. In the contralateral hemisphere the degree of neuronal injury was estimated by measurement of heat shock protein (HSP) expression and cell death quantified by acid fuchsin staining. In this model, neuronal injury correlates linearly with seizure duration; however, elevation of glutamate in the extracellular space was not seen even when neuronal injury was profound.", 
    "112": "Sedation is a technique widely used in intensive care unit patients. The main objective is to ensure a proper level of analgesia and the best physical and psychical comfort possible. For the vast majority of patients a light level of sedation is adequate and the level of sedation can easily be deepened to perform a short but painful procedure. A deeper level of sedation, close to that of a general anesthesia is rarely needed and limited to specific indications: adult respiratory distress syndrome, head trauma, status asthmaticus. Drugs used for sedation are combinations of opioids (fentanyl or sufentanil), benzodiazepines (midazolam) and hypnotic drugs such as propofol. In combination with the pharmacological approach, a psychological approach is of greater interest in conscious patients.", 
    "113": "Acute chloroquine intoxication is responsible for grave cardiovascular disturbances which may be rapidly life-threatening. For this reason, any suspicion of acute chloroquine intoxication requires hospitalisation in an intensive care unit for a minimum of 12 hours. Cardiovascular toxicity is linked to a potent membrane-stabilizing effect, which is also responsible for transfer-dependent hypokalemia, the degree of which is directly associated with the gravity of the intoxication. Blood chloroquine concentration confirms the intoxication and is likewise closely correlated to gravity. Treatment of this intoxication, based on vascular repletion, adrenalin, assisted ventilation and diazepam has markedly improved the prognosis of these intoxications, overall mortality for all degrees of intoxication nonetheless remains to the order of 10%.", 
    "114": "Ecteinascidin 743 is one of several related marine alkaloids isolated from the Caribbean tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata. It is remarkably active and potent in a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems and has been selected for development as an anticancer agent. The present study investigates the interactions of ecteinascidin 743 with DNA. Ecteinascidin 743 retarded the electrophoretic migration of both supercoiled and relaxed simian virus 40 DNA even in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and after ethanol precipitation, consistent with covalent DNA modifications. Similar results were obtained in a DNA oligonucleotide derived from ribosomal DNA. However, DNA denaturation reversed the DNA modifications. The homopolymeric oligonucleotide dG/dC was modified while neither the dI/dC nor the dA/dT oligonucleotides were, consistent with covalent attachment of ecteinascidin 743 to the exocyclic amino group at position 2 of guanine. Ecteinascidin 743 was then compared to another known DNA minor groove alkylating agent, anthramycin, which has also been shown to alkylate guanine N2. Footprinting analyses with DNase I and 1,10-phenanthroline-copper and exonuclease III digestions showed that ecteinascidin 743 covers three to five bases of DNA and exhibits a different sequence specificity than anthramycin in the Escherichia coli tyrosine tRNA promoter (tyrT DNA). The binding of ecteinascidin to DNA was abolished when guanines were substituted with inosines in this promoter. A band shift assay was designed to evaluate the influence of the bases flanking a centrally located guanine in an oligonucleotide containing inosines in place of guanines elsewhere. Ecteinascidin 743 and anthramycin showed similarities as well as differences in sequence selectivity. Ecteinascidin 743-guanine adducts appeared to require at least one flanking guanine and were strongest when the flanking guanine was 3' to the targeted guanine. These data indicate that ecteinascidin 743 is a novel DNA minor groove, guanine-specific alkylating agent.", 
    "115": "Environmental and pharmacological stimulation of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) efflux was determined in rats sustaining partial deafferentation of cortical cholinergic inputs. Rats were bilaterally infused with the selective cholinotoxin 192 IgG-saporin (0.005 microgram/0.5 microliter/site) into the frontoparietal cortex. In the first experiment, animals were pretrained to associate the onset of darkness with presentation of a palatable fruit cereal reward. The ability of this stimulus to enhance frontoparietal ACh efflux alone, and with the benzodiazepine receptor (BZR) weak inverse agonist ZK 93,426 (1.0 or 5.0 mg/kg, i.p.), was determined in lesioned and sham-lesioned rats. Intracortical infusions of 192 IgG-saporin reduced basal cortical ACh efflux by 47% of sham-lesioned values, consistent with reductions in the density of AChE-positive fibers. In spite of this deafferentation, ZK 93,426 produced a transient potentiation of the cortical ACh efflux induced by the darkness/cereal stimulus similar to that observed in control animals. In the second experiment, the ability of the more efficacious BZR partial inverse agonist FG 7142 (8.0 mg/kg, i.p.) to enhance basal cortical ACh efflux was compared in lesioned and sham-lesioned rats. Again, lesioned rats exhibited an increase comparable to control animals after FG 7142. This drug-induced stimulation of cortical ACh efflux was comparably and completely blocked in both groups by co-perfusion with tetrodotoxin (1.0 microM). These results suggest similarities in the modulation of cortical ACh efflux in intact and partially deafferented rats and indicate the potential of BZR inverse agonists for restoring transmission in animals with partial loss of cortical cholinergic inputs.", 
    "116": "Alpidem (1), the anxiolytic imidazopyridine, has nanomolar binding affinity for both the central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) and the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). A novel class of PBR ligands related to alpidem has been designed by comparing the interaction models of alpidem with PBR and CBR. Several compounds in this class have shown high selectivity for PBR vs CBR, and the selectivity has been discussed in terms of interaction models. The binding behavior of the three selected compounds was extensively studied by competition and saturation assays, and the results suggest that they are capable of recognizing two sites labeled by [3H]PK11195. The molecular structure of one of the most active compounds (4e) has been determined by X-ray diffraction and compared with that of alpidem. Molecular modeling studies suggest that the bioactive conformation of 4e is likely to be very similar to the conformation found in the crystal.", 
    "117": "The mechanism by which mammalian nucleotide excision repair (NER) detects a wide range of base lesions is poorly understood. Here, we tested the ability of human NER to recognize bulky modifications that either destabilize the DNA double helix (acetylaminofluorene (AAF) and benzo[a]pyrene diol-epoxide (BPDE) adducts, UV radiation products) or induce opposite effects by stabilizing the double helix (8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP), anthramycin, and CC-1065 adducts). We constructed plasmid DNA carrying a defined number of each of these adducts and determined their potential to sequester NER factors contained in a human cell-free extract. For that purpose, we measured the capacity of damaged plasmids to compete with excision repair of a site-directed NER substrate. This novel approach showed differences of more than 3 orders of magnitude in the efficiency by which helix-destabilizing and helix-stabilizing adducts sequester NER factors. For example, AAF modifications were able to compete with the NER substrate approximately 1740 times more effectively than 8-MOP adducts. The sequestration potency decreased with the following order of adducts, AAF > UV >/= BPDE > 8-MOP > anthramycin, CC-1065. A strong preference for helix-destabilizing lesions was confirmed by monitoring the formation of NER patches at site-specific adducts with either AAF or CC-1065. This comparison based on factor sequestration and repair synthesis indicates that human NER is primarily targeted to sites at which the secondary structure of DNA is destabilized. Thus, an early step of DNA damage recognition involves thermodynamic probing of the duplex.", 
    "118": "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a complication that may occur during treatment with neuroleptic drugs, or after abrupt cessation of dopaminagonists. Although the condition is relatively rare, it has a high mortality of about 20% when untreated. The first symptoms can appear the first day after initiation of treatment with neuroleptic drugs. The syndrome manifests itself in the form of a tetralogy composed of extrapyramidal symptoms, a change in the level of conciousness, elevated body temperature and autonomic instability. It is also associated with secondary laboratory findings such as increased creatine kinase and leucocyte count. Treatment includes stopping the neuroleptic drugs, application of dopaminagonists, benzodiazepines and fluid replacement. If the patient, after an episode of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, has a psychotic relapse, neuroleptica can be recommended after a break of one to four weeks. Two cases are described to demonstrate the picture.", 
    "119": "We have previously defined the concept of functional partial agonism as the partial agonist responses recorded in brain slices after administration of full ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists and competitive antagonists at fixed ratios. Functional partial agonism can be established at any level of maximal response, depending on the molar ratio of agonist and antagonist used. Using recombinant human muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (m1 and m5) and the functional assay, receptor selection and amplification technology (R-SAT), we have now shown that co-administration of the full agonist, carbachol, and a competitive antagonist, atropine or pirenzepine, at fixed ratios display functional partial agonism. The levels of apparent intrinsic activity of the functional partial agonist responses were shown to be dependent of the receptor density and G-protein concentration in the same manner as that determined for the true partial muscarinic agonist, 4-[N-(3-chlorophenyl)carbamoyloxy]-2-butynyltrimethylammonium chloride (McN A-343). Thus, functional as well as true partial agonist responses became more efficacious and potent with increasing receptor and G-protein levels. The level of maximal functional partial agonist response, which is dependent on the agonist/antagonist ratio, is predictable from the Waud equation, describing competitive receptor/ligand interactions. In agreement with the relative antagonist potencies of pirenzepine at m1 and m5, a 10:1 ratio of carbachol and pirenzepine produced very low-efficacy functional partial agonism, approaching full antagonism, at m1 but virtually full agonism at the m5 subtype.", 
    "120": "Benzodiazepines are commonly abused concurrently with opioids. The pharmacological rationale for this remains unknown. The present study has addressed behaviourally and neurochemically the action of alprazolam on the naloxone-precipitated morphine withdrawal syndrome in male rats. In naloxone (1 mg kg-1 i.p.)-precipitated morphine withdrawn rats, alprazolam (2.5 mg kg-1 s.c.) reduced the severity of the affective component, as measured by squeal on touch hostility, and the physical sequelae of opioid withdrawal. The microdialysis study in anaesthetized rats identified an increase in noradrenaline levels in hippocampal dialysates in rats undergoing naloxone-precipitated opioid withdrawal. Acute treatment with alprazolam (2.5 mg kg-1 s.c.) 20 min before administration of naloxone prevented the previously identified increase in noradrenaline in hippocampal dialysates. The only observable effect alprazolam induced in non-morphine-dependent rats was a 15% reduction in spontaneous locomotor activity. In conclusion, one interpretation of the data suggests that alprazolam decreases the withdrawal syndrome in rats through dampening down the previously identified hyperactivity of the locus coeruleus.", 
    "121": "The present study investigated the effects of the cannabinoid receptor agonist CP 55,940 (1-)-cis-3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl) phenyl]-trans-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexanol) and the cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A (N-(piperidin-l-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-me thyl-1 H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide hydrochloride) on ultrasonic vocalizations, body temperature and activity in 11-13-day-old rat pups. Testing occurred in a 5-min session 30 min following drug administration. CP 55,940 produced a dose-dependent decrease in ultrasonic vocalizations, with a 1000-micrograms/kg dose causing an almost complete inhibition of calls. Doses of 100 and 1000 micrograms/kg of CP 55,940, but not 10 micrograms/kg, caused significant hypothermia in the pups and the 1000 micrograms/kg dose also inhibited activity. The cannabinoid receptor antagonist SR 141716A (20 mg/kg) reversed the effects of 1000 micrograms/kg CP 55,940 on ultrasonic vocalizations and body temperature, but the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil (20 mg/kg), the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg) and the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) did not. When administered alone, SR 141716A (20 mg/kg) increased pup ultrasonic vocalizations without affecting body temperature or activity. These results indicate that cannabinoids modulate ultrasonic vocalization production in rat pups in a manner that is independent of hypothermia. The increase in ultrasonic vocalizations produced by SR 141716A is one of the first reported behavioural effects of this drug and suggests that the endogenous cannabinoid ligand anandamide may be involved in the regulation of ultrasonic vocalizations.", 
    "122": "The BZ1 (omega 1)-selective compound, zolpidem, is a clinically effective hypnotic drug with a pharmacological profile which differs from those of benzodiazepine anxiolytics and hypnotics. Zaleplon (CL 284,846) has recently been described as a hypnotic agent which also has BZ1 (omega 1) receptor selectivity. The pharmacological effects of zolpidem and zaleplon were therefore compared in mice and rats. Both drugs blocked tonic convulsions induced in mice by pentylenetetrazole and electroconvulsive shock and clonic convulsions induced by isoniazid. Zaleplon was more potent than zolpidem but the maximal effect of zolpidem for increasing the latency to isoniazid-induced convulsions was greater than that of zaleplon. Little tolerance developed to the anticonvulsant effect of zaleplon against isoniazid-induced seizures following twice daily administration of 10 or 30 mg/kg for 10 days. Both compounds reduced locomotor activity and produced motor deficits in the rotarod and loaded grid tests in mice. However, while zaleplon produced all three effects at similar doses, zolpidem showed the greatest potency for reducing locomotion. Zaleplon and zolpidem also decreased locomotion and produced a rotarod deficit in rats. Again, the difference between the doses giving rise to these two effects was greater for zolpidem than for zaleplon. In a drug discrimination procedure using rats trained to discriminate a dose (5 mg/kg) of chlordiazepoxide, zaleplon produced partial substitution for chlordiazepoxide at doses which greatly reduced response rates. These results show that zaleplon and zolpidem have similar pharmacological profiles, presumably related to their BZ1 (omega 1) receptor selectivity. However, the difference between doses producing motor deficits (rotarod, loaded grid) and those giving rise to other effects (anticonvulsant, decreased locomotion) was greater for zolpidem than for zaleplon. This difference may be related to a greater in vivo intrinsic activity of zolpidem as indicated by the different efficacies of the two drugs to antagonise isoniazid-induced convulsions.", 
    "123": "Benzodiazepine receptor agonists increase food intake in many different species, yet there has been little investigation of the central site of actions of these drugs on ingestive behaviour. In the present experiments, direct administration of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist midazolam (3-30 micrograms/microliter) into the parabrachial nucleus of the pons significantly increased the consumption of a wet mash diet and a 3% sucrose solution in adult non-deprived rats. The hyperphagic response was blocked by pre-treatment with the selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. Injection of midazolam into the parabrachial nucleus had no effect on locomotor activity, despite the fact that in the same animals an increase in mash intake was observed following intra-parabrachial midazolam. These data suggest that benzodiazepine receptors located in the parabrachial nucleus may be an important site of action for the effects of benzodiazepines specifically on ingestive behaviour.", 
    "124": "IN THE EARLY HOURS of the morning, a fit young man leaves a party, where drugs are reported to have been consumed, to walk home. A short time later he is found unconscious by the roadside, with severe head injuries. En route to hospital by ambulance, he suffers a cardiac arrest and is successfully resuscitated. On arrival at the Emergency Department he has obvious head injuries and is deeply unconscious, but shows spontaneous ventilatory movements. Available history is that he is a 20-year-old student with well-controlled epilepsy for which he takes phenytoin. It is not known how he sustained his injuries. Pupils are equal, small and react sluggishly to light. There is generalised flaccidity and an extensor-plantar response to painful stimuli. Skull x-rays show no fractures and computed tomography shows early cerebral oedema and scattered cerebral contusions with evidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage. He is transferred to the intensive care unit and measures to inhibit cerebral oedema, including mannitol, are commenced. An N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) inhibitor is administered for neuroprotection and ventilatory support is commenced. Over the next 24 hours haemodynamic support is needed with fluid loading and vasopressors. A urine drug screen by Toxilab (Toxilab Incorporated, Irvine, Calif.) shortly after arrival shows the presence of phenytoin and morphine. The report states that the presence of benzodiazepines is suspected. Plasma phenytoin concentration at the time of arrival was 78 mumol/L (optimal range, 40-80 mumol/L). Forty hours after admission his condition has deteriorated. His pupils are at midposition, no longer reactive to light and his lower limbs exhibit only spinal reflexes. His relatives begin to prepare themselves for the fact he may not survive and raise the issue that he would have been keen to donate organs under such circumstances. What is the opinion regarding withdrawal of life support at this time?", 
    "125": "In this report we characterize the effects of the benzodiazepine receptor partial agonist bretazenil (0.1-3mg/kg) on meal patterning and satiety sequences of male rats. Experiment 1 indicated that bretazenil (0.3-1.0mg/kg) doubled the size of the first meal; there was no concurrent increase in feeding rate and effects on water intake were smaller. Experiment 2 showed that the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist ZK93426 (10mg/kg) blocked this effect on meal size; in addition ZK93426 reduced water intake in the first 2h following drug administration, which we attribute to its weak inverse agonist action. Experiment 3 examined satiety sequences after bretazenil treatment. Food intake and feeding behaviour were enhanced; in the following behavioural sequence, active and grooming behaviour patterns were reduced and resting was greatly increased. The data are discussed in relation to current theories of benzodiazepine action on food intake and the processing of taste stimuli.", 
    "126": "This article discusses new perspectives in the psychopharmacology of cognition and analyses the advantages and disadvantages of using drugs as tools to study the mechanisms underlying memory functions. The use of 'stages' in the processing of information as a means for the analysis of cognitive operations is critically discussed as a rigid approach which can only partially accommodate different cognitive functions. Theoretical models of memory 'systems' and allocation of attentional resources are presented alongside findings from the two types of more commonly used drugs in cognitive psychopharmacology: the benzodiazepines (BZ) and the anticholinergics. In a post-hoc analysis of the effects of BZ and scopolamine on memory and attention, it has become clear that these newer theoretical models can accommodate most, but not all, of the effects of BZ and scopolamine on cognition. It is suggested that the development of cognitive tasks on the basis of these models and the execution of prospective studies with drugs as tools taking in to account the 'systems' approach to interpretation of data may be more useful for understanding cognitive functions.",

    "131": "One of the major goals of rational design of combinatorial libraries is to design libraries with maximum diversity to enhance the potential of finding active compounds in the initial rounds of high-throughput screening programs. We present strategies to visualize and optimize the structural diversity of sets of molecules, which can be either potential substituents to be attached at specific positions of the library scaffold, or entire molecules corresponding to enumerated libraries. The selection of highly diverse subsets of molecules from the library is based on the stochastic optimization of 'Diversity' functions using a single-point-mutation Monte Carlo technique. The Diversity functions are defined in terms of the distances among molecules in multidimensional property space resulting from the calculation of 2D and 3D molecular descriptors. Several Diversity functions, including an implementation of D-Optimal design, are applied to select diverse subsets and the results are compared. The diversity of the selected subsets of molecules is visualized by embedding the intermolecular distances, defined by the molecules in multidimensional property space, into a three-dimensional space."
