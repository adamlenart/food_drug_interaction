Here we studied the time and dose effects of midazolam treatment following nerve agent exposure. Rats were exposed to sarin (1.2 LD50, 108 \u03bcg/kg, im), and treated 1 min later with TMB4 and atropine (TA 7.5 and 5 mg/kg, im, respectively). Midazolam was injected either at 1 min (1 mg/kg, im), or 1 h later (1 or 5 mg/kg i.m.). Cortical seizures were monitored by electrocorticogram (ECoG). At 5 weeks, rats were assessed in a water maze task, and then their brains were extracted for biochemical analysis and histological evaluation. Results revealed a time and dose dependent effects of midazolam treatment. Rats treated with TA only displayed acute signs of sarin intoxication, 29% died within 24h and the ECoG showed seizures for several hours. Animals that received midazolam within 1 min survived with only minor clinical signs but with no biochemical, behavioral, or histological sequel. Animals that lived to receive midazolam at 1h (87%) survived and the effects of the delayed administration were dose dependent. Midazolam 5 mg/kg significantly counteracted the acute signs of intoxication and the impaired behavioral performance, attenuated some of the inflammatory response with no effect on morphological damage. Midazolam 1mg/kg showed only a slight tendency to modulate the cognitive function. In addition, the delayed administration of both midazolam doses significantly attenuated ECoG compared to TA treatment only. These results suggest that following prolonged seizure, high dose midazolam is beneficial in counteracting adverse effects of sarin poisoning.", 
    "1": "Prior to registration, no clinical trial evaluating safety and tolerability of Zolafren\u00ae (Adamed Sp. z o.o., Czosn\u00f3w, Poland), a generic olanzapine formulation, had been performed. Therefore, the aim of this post-authorization safety study (PASS) was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Zolafren in patients with bipolar disorder (BD).", 
    "2": "Adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of Zolafren were recorded in a PASS, in an open-label, non-randomized, multicenter observational study involving 20,698 outpatients with BD.", 
    "3": "Zolafren was used in both monotherapy (82.8%) and polytherapy (17.2%) at a mean dose of 12.1\u00b14.2 mg. The most commonly used formulation was coated tablets (70.9%). Orally dissolving tablets (19.7%) and hard capsules (9.4%) were less commonly used. During a period of 171\u00b147 days of exposure to Zolafren, 5883 AEs were reported in 2138 patients (10.3% of the study population). None of the reported AEs were severe. Zolafren-associated AEs were the reason for discontinuation in 43 patients and the reason for dose reduction in a further 762 patients. The most common AE was weight gain (by 1.6\u00b13.3 kg) which was considered unrelated to the dose of Zolafren. During follow-up, the percentage of patients with very good tolerance with Zolafren increased from 44.4% to 59.8%. The percentage of patients who had confidence in Zolafren also increased.",

    "6": "Bioanalytical analysis of toxicokinetic and pharmacokinetic samples is an integral part of small molecule drugs development and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has been the technique of choice. One important consideration is the matrix effect, in which ionization of the analytes of interest is affected by the presence of co-eluting interfering components present in the sample matrix. Hemolysis, which results in additional endogenous components being released from the lysed red blood cells, may cause additional matrix interferences. The effects of the degree of hemolysis on the accuracy and precision of the method and the reported sample concentrations from hemolyzed study samples have drawn increasing attention in recent years, especially in cases where the sample concentrations are critical for pharmacokinetic calculation. Currently, there is no established procedure to objectively assess the risk of reporting potentially inaccurate bioanalytical results from hemolyzed study samples. In this work, we evaluated the effect of different degrees of hemolysis on the internal standard peak area, accuracy, and precision of the analyses of BMS-906024 and its metabolite, BMS-911557, in human plasma by LC-MS/MS. In addition, we proposed the strategy of using the peak area of the stable isotope-labeled internal standard (SIL-IS) from the LC-MS/MS measurement as the surrogate marker for risk assessment. Samples with peak areas outside of the pre-defined acceptance criteria, e.g., less than 50% or more than 150% of the average IS response in study samples, plasma standards, and QC samples when SIL-IS is used, are flagged out for further investigation.", 
    "7": "In work, the attempt of contagious behavior modeling on the basis of rat drinking behavior was made. Rats' behavior was observed in home cage with two bottles. The rat without drinking motivation (viewer) was placed in the cage for adaptation. The rat-demonstrator was placed into the same cage 3 minutes later. If the viewer was tested with drink-motivated demonstrator, it had less latency of approach to bottles, higher frequency of approaches and increased drinking behavior time than the rat tested with unmotivated demonstrator or the rat tested without demonstrator. The intragastric infusion of coffee increased frequency of approaches to demonstrated bottle. Phenazepam intragastric injection decreased frequency of approaches and drinking behavior time at demonstrated bottle. The results suggest that drugs may affect rat contagious behavior based on drinking behavior.",

    "9": "The EPIDEP study was designed to identify bipolar patients among a large sample of major depressives. Only bipolars were included in the current study. Patients were subtyped as predominantly depressive (PD) and predominantly manic and hypomanic (PM) according to a broad (more episodes of a given polarity) and a narrow (2/3 of episodes of one polarity over the other) definition, and compared on their characteristics.", 
    "10": "Among 278 bipolars, 182 (79.8%) could be subtyped as PD and 46 (20.2%) as PM (broad definition); the respective proportions were of 111 (81.6%) and 25 (18.4%) using narrow definition. Expanding the definition added little in detecting differences between groups. Compared to PDs, PMs showed more psychosis, rapid cycling, stressors at onset, family history of affective illness, and manic first episode polarity; they also received more antipsychotics and lithium. The PDs showed more chronic depression, comorbid anxiety, and received more antidepressants, anticonvulsants and benzodiazepines. The following independent variables were associated with manic/hypomanic predominant polarity: cyclothymic temperament, first hospitalization\u226425 years, hyperthymic temperament, and alcohol use (only for broad definition).",

    "12": "Study findings are in accord with literature except for suicidality and mixicity which were related to predominant mania, and explained by higher levels of cyclothymic and hyperthymic temperaments. Temperaments may play a key role in the subtyping of bipolar patients according to predominant polarity, which warrants confirmation in prospective studies.", 
    "13": "While most clinicians will never prescribe buprenorphine or combined buprenorphine/naloxone, familiarity with the risks of these pharmacological approaches to the treatment of narcotic addiction remains relevant. Overall, medication-assisted treatment has clearly resulted in meaningful gains for a number of individuals who are addicted to narcotics (i.e., opiates and opioids). However, a certain level of risk is inherent with these approaches. For example, both buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone may be diverted and misused (e.g., intravenously injected, intranasally administered), particularly buprenorphine. Likewise, when illicitly injected, both can cause infectious complications as well as result in death from overdose. The risk of death with buprenorphine overdose appears to be heightened with the coadministration of either benzodiazepines or sedative/hypnotics. To conclude, as with all interventions in medicine, buprenorphine treatment for narcotic addiction has a clinically fluctuating risk/benefit equation that must be continually monitored.", 
    "14": "Clinical evidence and expert opinion support using a combination of an antipsychotic and an antidepressant when treating major depression with psychotic features. We characterized the impact of sertraline co-administration on olanzapine clearance in psychotic depression using population pharmacokinetic methods.", 
    "15": "The Study of Pharmacotherapy for Psychotic Depression (STOP-PD) randomized 259 participants to olanzapine plus placebo or olanzapine plus sertraline. Olanzapine was started at 2.5-5\u00a0mg/day and sertraline at 25-50\u00a0mg/day. Doses were increased to a maximum of 20\u00a0mg/day for olanzapine and 200\u00a0mg/day for sertraline. Up to four olanzapine concentration samples were collected during the 12-week trial and 12-week continuation phase. We used NONMEM (Version VII) for population pharmacokinetic analysis, assessing effects of the covariates sex, African American origin, smoking, age, and sertraline co-administration.", 
    "16": "Population pharmacokinetic analysis comprised 336 samples from 175 individuals. The structural model published by Bigos et al. was sufficient to describe the olanzapine data adequately: a one-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination, using an additive residual error structure with the absorption rate constant fixed to 0.5. Sertraline co-administration significantly increased olanzapine apparent clearance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) by 25-35\u00a0% depending on the patient characteristics included. Male sex was associated with a significantly increased clearance. Age and race did not have a significant impact on clearance.", 
    "17": "Contrary to expectations from the knowledge of cytochrome P450 interactions, sertraline increased olanzapine apparent clearance. Plausible explanations include patients treated with sertraline having poorer adherence to olanzapine, or the impact of sertraline inhibition of transporters resulting in increased intracellular concentrations and thus access to metabolizing enzymes.",

    "19": "Primary insomnia is mainly treated with drugs acting on benzodiazepine receptors and a few other classes of drugs used for different co-morbidities. A novel approach to treat insomnia has been introduced recently, with the approval of suvorexant, the first in a new class of orexin receptor antagonists. Orexin receptors in the brain have been found to play an important role in the regulation of various aspects of arousal and motivation. The drugs commonly used for insomnia therapy to date, have often been associated with adverse effects, such as, day-time somnolence, amnesia, confusion, and gait disturbance, apart from the risk of dependence on chronic use. Suvorexant has not shown these adverse effects because of its unique mechanism of action. It also appears to be suitable as a chronic therapy for insomnia, because of minimal physical dependence. The availability of this new drug as an effective and safe alternative is an important and welcome development in insomnia management.", 
    "20": "Lung cancer is prevalent in cigarette smokers. The mitochondrial membrane translocator protein (TSPO), is thought to protect cells from free radical damage. We examined the effect of cigarette smoke (CS) (containing free radicals) alone and in the presence of saliva (containing redox active free iron), on survival of H1299 lung cancer cells and on their mitochondrial characteristics, and whether TSPO binding was influenced by CS and by saliva. We exposed H1299 cells to CS in the presence/absence of saliva and also characterized TSPO binding in the cells using [3H]PK 11195 as a radioligand. CS induced a significant drop in mitochondrial potential (\u0394\u03a8m), while addition of saliva did not lead to further loss of \u0394\u03a8m (42.5% vs. 39.85%). Scatchard analysis of the saturation curve of [3H]PK 11195 binding (0.2-6\u2009nM final concentration) yielded a straight-line plot (R\u2009=\u2009 0.9). Average Bmax value was 3274\u2009\u00b1\u2009787\u2009fmol/mg of protein, and average Kd value was 9.2\u2009\u00b1\u20091.3\u2009nM. Benzodiazepine diazepam partially prevented decrease in cell survival following exposure to CS and redox active iron containing media (saliva) while benzodiazepine clonazepam did not, indicating that this effect is TSPO-specific. Exposure of cells to CS resulted in alternation of biomolecules expressed by CLs peroxidation, reduction of TSPO binding, and depletion of the mitochondrial potential. This irreversible damage was enhanced in the presence of saliva. All these modulations may result in cellular death increase following CS exposure, enhanced in the presence of saliva.", 
    "21": "Opioid prescription for noncancer pain is increasing in Europe and the United States. Research and guidance have focused on the potential for dependency and medical side effects with high doses. In contrast, benzodiazepines have received little attention in the chronic pain literature, despite evidence for dependency and cognitive impairment in long-term use. We aimed to examine the relationship between these classes of medication use, mood, and functioning.", 
    "22": "This cross-sectional study included patients (N=229) with disabling chronic pain who were about to start intensive pain rehabilitation. They completed self-report measures of mood, functioning, and responses to pain. We examined each patient's medication use and calculated a single morphine equivalent (ME) dose per person, and a similar diazepam equivalent (DE) dose. We examined the relationship between drug dose, mood, and functioning.", 
    "23": "Higher DE doses were associated with worse outcomes in most domains. Higher ME doses were more narrowly associated with worse functioning. There was no evidence for any benefit of these drugs; higher doses were not associated with less pain, fear, or disability. Higher ME doses were not more problematic, contrary to our predictions. The combination of opioids and benzodiazepines was associated with particularly poor outcomes for mood.", 
    "24": "This study is the first to examine both opioid and benzodiazepine use together in chronic pain. We found the anticipated negative effects of opioid medication, and particularly consistent associations between benzodiazepine use and poor well-being. Future guidance on chronic pain prescription should focus on restricting benzodiazepine use.", 
    "25": "Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been reported following attempts to withdraw even from low or therapeutic doses and has been compared to barbiturate and alcohol withdrawal. This experience is known to deter patients from future cessation attempts. Research on other psychotropic substances shows that the reasons and motivations for withdrawal attempts - as well as the experiences surrounding those attempts - at least partially predict future efforts at discontinuation as well as relapse. We therefore aimed to qualitatively explore what motivates patients to discontinue this medication as well as to examine their experiences surrounding previous and current withdrawal attempts and treatment interventions in order to positively influence future help-seeking behavior and compliance.", 
    "26": "To understand these patients better, we conducted a series of 41 unstructured, narrative, in-depth interviews among adult Swiss patients with a long-term dependent use of benzodiazepines in doses equivalent to more than 40\u00a0mg diazepam per day and/or otherwise problematic use (mixing benzodiazepines, escalating dosage, recreational use or illegal purchase). Mayring's qualitative content analysis was used to evaluate findings.", 
    "27": "These high-dose benzodiazepine-dependent patients decision to change consumption patterns were affected by health concerns, the feeling of being addicted and social factors. Discontinuation attempts were frequent and not very successful with fast relapse. Withdrawal was perceived to be a difficult, complicated, and highly unpredictable process. The first attempt at withdrawal occurred at home and typically felt better than at the clinic. Inpatient treatment was believed to be more effective with long term treatment (approaches) than short term. Patients preferred gradual reduction of usage to abrupt cessation (and had experienced both). While no clear preferences for withdrawal were found for benzodiazepines with specific pharmacokinetic properties, participants frequently based their decision to participate in treatment on the availability of their preferred brand name and furthermore discarding equivalent dosage rationales.", 
    "28": "Our findings provide greater understanding of the factors that motivate high-dose benzodiazepine-dependent individuals to stop taking these medications, and how they experience withdrawal and treatment strategies. They underscore how patients' perceptions of treatment approaches contribute to compliant or non-compliant behavior.", 
    "29": "2,3-Benzodiazepines are a well-known group of compounds for their potential antagonism against AMPA receptors. It has been previously reported that the inhibitory effect of 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives with a 7,8-ethylenedioxy moiety can be enhanced by simply adding a chlorine atom at position 3 of the 4-aminophenyl ring. Here we report that adding a methyl group at position 3 on the 4-aminophenyl ring, termed as BDZ-11-7, can similarly enhance the inhibitory activity, as compared with the unsubstituted one or BDZ-11-2. Our kinetic studies have shown that BDZ-11-7 is a noncompetitive antagonist of GluA2Q homomeric receptors and prefers to inhibit the closed-channel state. However, adding another methyl group at position 5 on the 4-aminophenyl ring, termed as BDZ-11-6, fails to yield extra inhibition on GluA2Q receptors. Instead, BDZ-11-6 exhibits a diminished inhibition of GluA2Q. Site interaction test indicates the two compounds, BDZ-11-6 and BDZ-11-7, bind to the same site on GluA2Q, which is also the binding site for their prototype, BDZ-11-2. Based on the results from this and our earlier studies, we propose that the binding site that accommodates the 4-aminophenyl ring must contain two interactive points, with one preferring polar groups like chlorine and the other preferring nonpolar groups such as a methyl group. Either adding a chlorine or a methyl group may enhance the inhibitory activity of 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives with a 7,8-ethylenedioxy moiety. Adding any two of the same group on positions 3 and 5 of the 4-aminophenyl ring, however, significantly reduces the interaction between these 2,3-benzodiazepines and their binding site, because one group is always repelled by one interactive point. We predict therefore that adding a chlorine atom at position 3 and a methyl group at position 5 of the 4-aminophenyl ring of 2,3-benzodiazepine derivatives with a 7,8-ethylenedioxy moiety may produce a new compound that is more potent.",

A higher rate of respiratory depression was observed among patients who underwent general anesthesia (312 per 1000 cases; 95% CI, 301-323) than neuraxial anesthesia (144 per 1000 cases; 95% CI, 135-153) (P < 0.001). With both anesthetic techniques, respiratory depression was associated with preoperative use of gabapentin (>300 mg) (P < 0.001 for both anesthesia groups) and sustained-release oxycodone (>10 mg) (P = 0.01 for general anesthesia; P = 0.008 for neuraxial anesthesia).",

The pharmacokinetics of probe drug revealed AUC(0-t), AUC(0-\u221e), t1/2 and Cmax of metoprolol was shorten in the DM group (p < 0.05). However, there were no statistical differences in MRT, t1/2, CL and Tmax for phenacetin, tolbutamide and midazolam.",

    "39": "In 2012, an Indian parliamentary committee reported that manufacturing licenses for large numbers of fixed dose combination (FDC) drugs had been issued by state authorities without prior approval of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) in violation of rules, and considered that some ambiguity until 1 May 2002 about states' powers might have contributed. To our knowledge, no systematic enquiry has been undertaken to determine if evidence existed to support these findings. We investigated CDSCO approvals for and availability of oral FDC drugs in four therapeutic areas: analgesia (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), diabetes (metformin), depression/anxiety (anti-depressants/benzodiazepines), and psychosis (anti-psychotics).", 
    "40": "This was an ecologic study with a time-trend analysis of FDC sales volumes (2007-2012) and a cross-sectional examination of 2011-2012 data to establish the numbers of formulations on the market with and without a record of CDSCO approval (\"approved\" and \"unapproved\"), their branded products, and sales volumes. Data from the CDSCO on approved FDC formulations were compared with sales data from PharmaTrac, a database of national drug sales. We determined the proportions of FDC sales volumes (2011-2012) arising from centrally approved and unapproved formulations and from formulations including drugs banned/restricted internationally. We also determined the proportions of centrally approved and unapproved formulations marketed before and after 1 May 2002, when amendments were made to the drug rules. FDC approvals in India, the United Kingdom (UK), and United States of America (US) were compared. For NSAID FDCs, 124 formulations were marketed, of which 34 (27%) were centrally approved and 90 (73%) were unapproved; metformin: 25 formulations, 20 (80%) approved, five (20%) unapproved; anti-depressants/benzodiazepines: 16 formulations, three (19%) approved, 13 (81%) unapproved; anti-psychotics: ten formulations, three (30%) approved, seven (70%) unapproved. After 1 May 2002, the proportions of approved FDC formulations increased for NSAIDs (26%/28%) and anti-psychotics (0%/38%) and decreased for metformin (100%/75%) and anti-depressants/benzodiazepines (20%/18%), and the overall proportion approved remained similar before and after that date. FDC formulations gave rise to multiple branded products, ranging from 211 anti-psychotic FDC products from ten formulations to 2,739 NSAID FDC products from 124 formulations. The proportions of FDC sales volumes arising from unapproved formulations were as follows: anti-depressants/benzodiazepines, 69%; anti-psychotics, 43%; NSAIDs, 28%; and metformin, 0.4%. Formulations including drugs banned/restricted internationally comprised over 12% of NSAID FDC sales and 53% of anti-psychotic FDC sales. Across the four therapeutic areas, 14 FDC formulations were approved in the UK and 22 in the US.", 
    "41": "There was evidence supporting concerns about FDCs. Metformin excepted, substantial numbers of centrally unapproved formulations for NSAID, anti-depressant/benzodiazepine, and anti-psychotic FDCs were marketed; sales volumes were high. The legal need for central approval of new drugs before manufacture has been in place continuously since 1961, including for FDCs meeting the applicable legal test. Proportions of centrally unapproved formulations after 1 May 2002 did not decrease overall, and no ambiguity was found about states' licensing powers. Unapproved formulations should be banned immediately, prioritising those withdrawn/banned internationally and undertaking a review of benefits and risks for patients in ceasing or switching to other medicines. Drug laws need to be amended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medicines marketed in India.",

The use and effectiveness of clobazam, a unique 1,5-benzodiazepine, in the management of RSE has not been reported before. Over the last 24 months, we identified 17 patients with RSE who were treated with clobazam in our hospital. Eleven of the 17 patients had prior epilepsy. Fifteen patients had focal status epilepticus. Use of clobazam was prompted by a favorable pharmacokinetic profile devoid of drug interactions. Clobazam was introduced after a median duration of 4 days and after a median of three failed antiepileptic drugs. A successful response, defined as termination of RSE within 24 h of administration, without addition or modification of concurrent AED and with successful wean of anesthetic infusions, was seen in 13 patients. Indeterminate response was seen in three patients, whereas clobazam was unsuccessful in one patient. Clobazam averted the need for anesthetic infusions in five patients. Clobazam was well tolerated, and appears to be an effective and promising option as add-on therapy in RSE. Its efficacy, particularly early in the course of SE, should be further investigated in prospective, randomized trials.",

Benzodiazepines act at the high-affinity binding site at the \u03b1+/\u03b3- subunit interface. Previously, an additional low affinity binding site for diazepam located in the transmembrane (TM) domain has been described. The compound SJM-3 was recently identified in a prospective screening of ligands for the benzodiazepine binding site and investigated for its site of action. We determined the binding properties of SJM-3 at GABAA receptors recombinantly expressed in HEK-cells using radioactive ligand binding assays. Impact on function was assessed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with electrophysiological experiments using the two-electrode voltage clamp method. SJM-3 was shown to act as an antagonist at the \u03b1+/\u03b3- site. At the same time it strongly potentiated GABA currents via the binding site for diazepam in the transmembrane domain. Mutation of a residue in M2 of the \u03b1 subunit strongly reduced receptor modulation by SJM-3 and a homologous mutation in the \u03b2 subunit abolished potentiation. SJM-3 acts as a more efficient modulator than diazepam at the site in the trans-membrane domain. In contrast to low concentrations of benzodiazepines, SJM-3 modulates both synaptic and extrasynaptic receptors. A detailed exploration of the membrane site may provide the basis for the design and identification of subtype-selective modulatory drugs.", 
    "49": "Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) expression at the mitochondrial membrane of glial cells is related to glial activation. TSPO radioligands such as [(18)F]DPA-714 are useful for the non-invasive study of neuroimmune processes using positron emission tomography (PET). Anesthetic agents were shown to impact mitochondrial function and may influence [(18)F]DPA-714 binding parameters and PET kinetics. [(18) F]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed in Papio anubis baboons anesthetized using either intravenous propofol (n = 3) or inhaled isoflurane (n = 3). Brain kinetics and metabolite-corrected input function were measured to estimate [(18) F]DPA-714 brain distribution (VT). Displacement experiments were performed using PK11195 (1.5 mg/kg). In vitro [(18)F]DPA-714 binding experiments were performed using baboon brain tissue in the absence and presence of tested anesthetics. Brain radioactivity peaked higher in isoflurane-anesthetized animals compared with propofol (SUVmax = 2.7 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 1.3 \u00b1 0.2, respectively) but was not different after 30 min. Brain VT was not different under propofol and isoflurane. Displacement resulted in a 35.8 \u00b1 8.4% decrease of brain radioactivity under propofol but not under isoflurane (0.1 \u00b1 7.0%). In vitro, the presence of propofol increased TSPO density and dramatically reduced its affinity for [(18)F]DPA-714 compared with control. This in vitro effect was not significant with isoflurane. Exposure to propofol and isoflurane differentially influences TSPO interaction with its specific radioligand [(18)F]DPA-714 with subsequent impact on its tissue kinetics and specific binding estimated in vivo using PET. Therefore, the choice of anesthetics and their potential influence on PET data should be considered for the design of imaging studies using TSPO radioligands, especially in a translational research context.",

The two-step, three-state urea transition of HSA was transformed into a single-step, two-state transition with the abolishment of the intermediate state along with a shift of the transition curve towards higher urea concentrations in the presence of diazepam or ketoprofen. Interestingly, a greater shift in the transition curve of HSA was observed in the presence of ketoprofen compared to diazepam. A comparison of the intrinsic fluorescence and three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of HSA and partially-denatured HSAs, obtained in the absence and the presence of diazepam or ketoprofen suggested significant retention of native-like conformation in the partially-denatured states of HSA in the presence of Sudlow's site II markers.

This article focuses on assessing and treating insomnia that persists despite 4 or more weeks of sobriety in alcohol-dependent adults. Selecting among the various options for treatment follows a comprehensive assessment of insomnia and its multifactorial causes. In addition to chronic, heavy alcohol consumption and its effects on sleep regulatory systems, contributing factors include premorbid insomnia; co-occurring medical, psychiatric, and other sleep disorders; use of other substances and medications; stress; environmental factors; and inadequate sleep hygiene. The assessment makes use of history, rating scales, and sleep diaries as well as physical, mental status, and laboratory examinations to rule out these factors. Polysomnography is indicated when another sleep disorder is suspected, such as sleep apnea or periodic limb movement disorder, or when insomnia is resistant to treatment. Sobriety remains a necessary, first-line treatment for insomnia, and most patients will have some improvement. If insomnia-specific treatment is needed, then brief behavioral therapies are the treatment of choice, because they have shown long-lasting benefit without worsening of drinking outcomes. Medications work faster, but they generally work only as long as they are taken. Melatonin agonists; sedating antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics; and benzodiazepine receptor agonists each have their benefits and risks, which must be weighed and monitored to optimize outcomes. Some relapse prevention medications may also have sleep-promoting activity. Although it is assumed that treatment for insomnia will help prevent relapse, this has not been firmly established. Therefore, insomnia and alcohol dependence might be best thought of as co-occurring disorders, each of which requires its own treatment.",

Evidence suggests that the rates of missed diagnoses and misdiagnosis of GAD and PD are high, with symptoms often ascribed to physical causes. Diagnosing GAD and PD requires a broad differential and caution to identify confounding variables and comorbid conditions. Screening and monitoring tools can be used to help make the diagnosis and monitor response to therapy. The GAD-7 and the Severity Measure for Panic Disorder are free diagnostic tools. Successful outcomes may require a combination of treatment modalities tailored to the individual patient. Treatment often includes medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or psychotherapy, both of which are highly effective. Among psychotherapeutic treatments, cognitive behavior therapy has been studied widely and has an extensive evidence base. Benzodiazepines are effective in reducing anxiety symptoms, but their use is limited by risk of abuse and adverse effect profiles. Physical activity can reduce symptoms of GAD and PD. A number of complementary and alternative treatments are often used; however, evidence is limited for most. Several common botanicals and supplements can potentiate serotonin syndrome when used in combination with antidepressants. Medication should be continued for 12 months before tapering to prevent relapse.",

    "76": "Some schizophrenia patients are more sensitive to amphetamine (AMPH)-induced exacerbations in psychosis-an effect that correlates with higher striatal dopamine release. This enhanced vulnerability may be related to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) deficits observed in schizophrenia. We hypothesized that a pharmacologically induced GABA deficit would create vulnerability to the psychotomimetic effects to the 'subthreshold' dose of AMPH in healthy subjects, which by itself would not induce clinically significant increase in positive symptoms. To test this hypothesis, a GABA deficit was induced by intravenous infusion of iomazenil (IOM; 3.7\u2009\u03bcg/kg), an antagonist and partial inverse agonist of benzodiazepine receptor. A subthreshold dose of AMPH (0.1\u2009mg/kg) was administered by intravenous infusion. Healthy subjects received placebo IOM followed by placebo AMPH, active IOM followed by placebo AMPH, placebo IOM followed by active AMPH, and active IOM followed by active AMPH in a randomized, double-blind crossover design over 4 test days. Twelve healthy subjects who had a subclinical response to active AMPH alone were included in the analysis. Psychotomimetic effects (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)), perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)), and subjective effects (visual analog scale) were captured before and after the administration of drugs. IOM significantly augmented AMPH-induced peak changes in PANSS positive symptom subscale and both subjective and objective CADSS scores. There were no pharmacokinetic interactions. In conclusion, GABA deficits increased vulnerability to amphetamine-induced psychosis-relevant effects in healthy subjects, suggesting that pre-existing GABA deficits may explain why a subgroup of schizophrenia patients are vulnerable to AMPH.",

It can be accompanied by xerostomia and dysgeusia. The syndrome generally manifests spontaneously, and the discomfort is typically of a continuous nature but increases in intensity during the evening and at night. Although BMS classically has been attributed to a range of factors, in recent years evidence has been obtained relating it peripheral (sensory C and/or trigeminal nerve fibers) or central neuropathic disturbances (involving the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system). The differential diagnosis requires the exclusion of oral mucosal lesions or blood test alterations that can produce burning mouth sensation. Patient management is based on the avoidance of causes of oral irritation and the provision of psychological support. Drug treatment for burning sensation in primary BMS of peripheral origin can consist of topical clonazepam, while central type BMS appears to improve with the use of antidepressants such as duloxetine, antiseizure drugs such as gabapentin, or amisulpride.",

We investigated the depth of sedation by using a Modified Observers Assessment Alertness/Sedation score, the number of patients' reactions interfering with the procedure, sedation related-adverse events and the degree of satisfaction of patients and doctors.", 
    "102": "There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding their age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification and the characteristics of the tumor. Appropriate sedation rate and the degree of satisfaction of the doctors were significantly higher in the DEX group than in the MDZ group. Patients' reactions interfering with the procedure were more numerous in the MDZ group than in the DEX group. There was no significant difference in adverse events between the two groups.",

    "104": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric disorder that may develop after exposure to a life-threatening trauma. As veterans and armed forces may deal with diverse health problems compared with civilians, they have a greater risk for psychiatric disorders, including PTSD, than civilians, even if the disorder may be also frequent in the general population. PTSD is associated with significant comorbidity, especially with mood disorders and substance abuse. Moreover, the suicide risk is higher in PTSD patients than in the general population. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics and benzodiazepines are commonly employed in the management of PTSD, but often these treatments fail or are discontinued due to adverse effects. It has been demonstrated that high noradrenergic activity may be associated with hyperarousal, trauma nightmares and sleep disturbances in PTSD subjects, probably through the stimulation of \u03b1 -1 adrenergic receptors in the brain prefrontal cortex. The \u03b1 -1 adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin decreases noradrenaline effects at brain \u03b1-1 adrenoreceptors and may be a promising agent in the treatment of PTSD, as some studies have found it effective and well tolerated. Therefore, the present review is aimed to examine the role of noradrenergic system in the pathophysiology of PTSD. Moreover, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of prazosin in PTSD patients. Meta-analysis was used to combine data from multiple studies and better estimate the effect of prazosin on specific outcomes. We found prazosin to be significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing distressing dreams in PTSD patients, even though our results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies included in our quantitative synthesis.", 
    "105": "Stroke is the leading cause of seizures and epilepsy in the aged population, with post-stroke seizures being a poor prognostic factor. The pathological processes underlying post-stroke seizures are not well understood and studies of these seizures in aging/aged animals remain scarce. Therefore, our primary objective was to model post-stroke seizures in aging mice (C57 black strain, 16-20 months-old), with a focus on early-onset, convulsive seizures that occur within 24-hours of brain ischemia. We utilized a middle cerebral artery occlusion model and examined seizure activity and brain injury using combined behavioral and electroencephalographic monitoring and histological assessments. Aging mice exhibited vigorous convulsive seizures within hours of the middle cerebral artery occlusion. These seizures manifested with jumping, rapid running, barrel-rolling and/or falling all in the absence of hippocampal-cortical electrographic discharges. Seizure development was closely associated with severe brain injury and acute mortality. Anticonvulsive treatments after seizure occurrence offered temporary seizure control but failed to improve animal survival. A separate cohort of adult mice (6-8 months-old) exhibited analogous early-onset convulsive seizures following the middle cerebral artery occlusion but had better survival outcomes following anticonvulsive treatment. Collectively, our data suggest that early-onset convulsive seizures are a result of severe brain ischemia in aging animals.",

Patients with LGS frequently experience multiple types of treatment-refractory seizures and require lifelong therapy with several antiepileptic drugs. Here, post hoc analyses of clinical trials (phase III trial OV-1012 and open-label extension trial OV-1004) provide short- and long-term efficacy and safety data of adjunctive clobazam in patients with LGS stratified by age at baseline (\u22652 to <12years, \u226512 to <17years, and \u226517years). In OV-1012, 301 patients were screened, 238 were randomized, 217 comprised the modified intention-to-treat population, and 177 completed the study. A total of 267/306 patients (61 of 68 from phase II trial OV-1002 and 206 of 238 from phase III trial OV-1012) entered the open-label extension trial. Demographics and clinical characteristics were similar between different age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004. No differences in efficacy or adverse events were observed across age groups in OV-1012 and OV-1004.

Each patient was sedated with a combination of either oral midazolam and nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation or intranasal midazolam and nitrous oxide-oxygen sedation at subsequent dental treatment visits. During the treatment procedure, the study recorded scales for drug acceptability, onset of sedation, acceptance of nasal mask, sedation, behavioural, safety, overall behaviour and alertness.", 
    "121": "The grade of acceptability of midazolam in both groups was consistently good. There was a significant difference (p < 0.001) in the time of onset of sedation, which was significantly quicker with the intranasal administration of midazolam. The mean time of onset for oral midazolam was 20.1 (17-25) min and for intranasal midazolam 12.1 (8-18) min. The efficacy profile of the present study included: acceptance of nasal mask, sedation score, crying levels, motor movements and overall behaviour scores. The results did not show any statistically significant differences. All the parameters were highly satisfactory. The difference in alertness was statistically significant (p value <0.05), being higher in the intranasal group than the oral group and suggestive of faster recovery using intranasal midazolam.",

Compounds 1a and 1b demonstrated high anxiolytic-like effect in the dose range of 0.1-1.0mg/kg comparable with that of diazepam. The involvement of TSPO receptor in the mechanism of anxiolytic-like activity of new compounds was proved by antagonism of the most active compound 1a with TSPO selective inhibitor PK11195.

Compound 3b, chosen among the synthesized compounds as the most promising in terms of inhibitory activity, selectivity and safety, showed an improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to its non fluorinated analogue. Spontaneous locomotor activity, assessed in an open field apparatus, showed that, differently from rolipram and diazepam, selective PDE4D inhibitors, such as compounds 3b, 5b and 7b, did not affect locomotion, whereas compound 1b showed a tendency to reduce the distance traveled and to prolong the immobility period, possibly due to a poor selectivity.", 
    "125": "Both antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and benzodiazepines (BZDs) have previously been associated with an increased risk of suicidality. Our aim was to study the association between the use of conventional AEDs and BZDs and suicidal ideation in a large population-based cohort. Information on the medications used in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 was collected from the subjects at the age of 31 years, using a postal questionnaire (N=8211). The presence of suicidal ideation and other symptoms of depression and anxiety was assessed via the Hopkins Symptom Checklist - 25 questionnaire. The associations between medications and suicidal ideation were studied in different diagnostic groups and adjusted for symptoms of depression and anxiety. No difference was observed in suicidal ideation between AED users (n=54) and nonusers (n=8157). Subjects using BZDs (n=147) had greater suicidal ideation compared with nonusers (n=8064). Antiepileptic drug and benzodiazepine users more often exhibited other depression and anxiety symptoms. After adjustment for these symptoms, both AED and BZD users had less suicidal ideation compared with nonusers. In conclusion, in this population-based cohort, neither the use of AEDs nor that of BZDs was found to be associated with increased suicidal ideation when the symptoms of depression and anxiety were taken into account.",

Fifty-five persistently-ill patients with schizophrenia (ICD-10), mean \u00b1 S.D. age: 57.5 \u00b1 13.0 y.o., duration of illness and admissions: 30.9 \u00b1 15.2 years and 20.7 \u00b1 14.5 years, respectively) treated longitudinally were evaluated. The rule was to treat with a simplest possible psychotropic regimen without polypharmacy. Compared to the baseline, the number and dose of antipsychotics were reduced from 1.9 to 1.1 and 1012 mg/day to 607 mg/day, respectively. The number of total psychotropics was minimized from 4.7 to 2.1, with a simplified once or twice daily dosing. Overall, the CGI-Severity and FACT-Sz (global functioning) improved slightly from 5.8 to 5.5 and 28.7 to 32.6, respectively. Of note, no patients got worse in comparison with the baseline clinical presentation. Forty-four patients were successfully treated with a single antipsychotic; only seven needed two antipsychotics simultaneously while 36 had been treated with antipsychotic polypharmacy at baseline. Benzodiazepines (mostly lorazepam) and antiparkinsonian drugs were prescribed in 28 and only two, respectively. Nineteen needed adjunctive valproate (average blood levels: 99.3 \u00b1 21.8 \u03bcg/mL) and nine used lithium (0.61 \u00b1 0.26 mEq/L). Optimization of psychopharmacotherapy is still possible for difficult-to-treat patients and, while augmentation of an antipsychotic with mood stabilizers is frequently needed, antipsychotic polypharmacy should be exceptional.",

    "128": "Presynaptic kainate-type glutamate ionotropic receptors (KARs) that mediate either the depression or the facilitation of GABA release have been intensively studied. Little attention has been given to the modulation of GABAA receptors (GABAARs) by postsynaptic KARs. Recent studies suggest that two GABAAR populations, synaptic (sGABAAR) and extrasynaptic (eGABAAR) GABAARs, mediate phasic and tonic forms of inhibition, respectively. Tonic inhibition plays an important role in the excitability of neuronal circuits and the occurrence of epileptic seizures. For this study, we are the first to report that the activation of postsynaptic KARs by the KAR agonist, Kainic acid (KA, 5 \u03bcM), enhanced tonic inhibition by potentiating eGABAARs. KA enhanced THIP-induced eGABAAR currents and prolonged the rise and decay time of muscimol-induced sGABAAR/eGABAAR currents, but also depressed the amplitude of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs), unitary IPSCs (uIPSCs), and muscimol-induced sGABAAR/eGABAAR currents. The PKC inhibitor, staurosporine (1 \u03bcM), in the patch pipette solution fully blocked the KA-induced potentiation of tonic inhibition, suggesting the involvement of an intracellular PKC pathway. Our study suggests that the activation of postsynaptic KARs potentiates eGABAARs but depresses sGABAARs. By activating postsynaptic KARs, synaptically released glutamate depresses phasic inhibition to facilitate neuronal plasticity, but potentiates tonic inhibition to protect neurons from over-excitation.", 
    "129": "To our knowledge, no previous meta-analysis has attempted to compare the efficacy of pharmacological, psychological and combined treatments for the three main anxiety disorders (panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and social phobia). Pre-post and treated versus control effect sizes (ES) were calculated for all evaluable randomized-controlled studies (n = 234), involving 37,333 patients. Medications were associated with a significantly higher average pre-post ES [Cohen's d = 2.02 (1.90-2.15); 28,051 patients] than psychotherapies [1.22 (1.14-1.30); 6992 patients; P < 0.0001]. ES were 2.25 for serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (n = 23 study arms), 2.15 for benzodiazepines (n = 42), 2.09 for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 62) and 1.83 for tricyclic antidepressants (n = 15). ES for psychotherapies were mindfulness therapies, 1.56 (n = 4); relaxation, 1.36 (n = 17); individual cognitive behavioural/exposure therapy (CBT), 1.30 (n = 93); group CBT, 1.22 (n = 18); psychodynamic therapy 1.17 (n = 5); therapies without face-to-face contact (e.g. Internet therapies), 1.11 (n = 34); eye movement desensitization reprocessing, 1.03 (n = 3); and interpersonal therapy 0.78 (n = 4). The ES was 2.12 (n = 16) for CBT/drug combinations. Exercise had an ES of 1.23 (n = 3). For control groups, ES were 1.29 for placebo pills (n = 111), 0.83 for psychological placebos (n = 16) and 0.20 for waitlists (n = 50). In direct comparisons with control groups, all investigated drugs, except for citalopram, opipramol and moclobemide, were significantly more effective than placebo. Individual CBT was more effective than waiting list, psychological placebo and pill placebo. When looking at the average pre-post ES, medications were more effective than psychotherapies. Pre-post ES for psychotherapies did not differ from pill placebos; this finding cannot be explained by heterogeneity, publication bias or allegiance effects. However, the decision on whether to choose psychotherapy, medications or a combination of the two should be left to the patient as drugs may have side effects, interactions and contraindications.",

This study was undertaken in order to understand the impact of substance use on care outcomes for HIV-infected individuals in Manitoba. Clinical records of 564 HIV-infected individuals in care at Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba were reviewed. Clinical data were extracted from patient charts for substance users (illicit substance users, alcohol abusers and chronic users of opioids or benzodiazepines) and non-users. Substance users and non-users were analysed using chi-square analysis and logistic regression models to compare basic socio-demographic and clinic variables. Chi-square and analysis of variance were used to compare a subset of substance users based on similar socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Among HIV-infected individuals in Manitoba, 38% were substance users with over-representation by Aboriginals, females, young adults and residents of Winnipeg's core areas. Opioids and benzodiazepines were the most commonly used substances with the majority of substance users having used multiple classes of substances in their lifetime. Substance users were more likely than non-users to have missed clinic appointments. Among substance users, missed appointments were more common among those who self-identified as Aboriginal, female, young adults, residents of Winnipeg's core areas, heterosexuals and those who had abused alcohol or cocaine/crack. Aboriginal substance users were also less likely to achieve viral load suppression compared to non-Aboriginal substance users. With the high prevalence of substance use among HIV-infected individuals in Manitoba, it is important to identify at-risk individuals in order to implement appropriate care strategies and improve treatment adherence and health outcomes.",

The relationships between zolpidem use and dementia were measured using odds and adjusted odds ratios. The relationship between the average cumulative doses for zolpidem and dementia was also analyzed.Zolpidem alone or with other underlying diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, was significantly associated with dementia after controlling for potential confounders, such as age, sex, coronary artery disease, diabetes, anti-hypertension drugs, stroke, anticholesterol statin drugs, depression, anxiety, benzodiazepine, anti-psychotic, and anti-depressant agents' use (Adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.41). Zolpidem use also has significant dose-response effects for most of the types of dementia.

Diazepam, lorazepam, and midazolam are available as parenteral formulations in the United States. A literature review of clinical trials and SE treatment guidelines was conducted in an attempt to identify which benzodiazepine and route are the best treatment option for adult patients with SE. For initial treatment of SE in adults, intravenous lorazepam is the recommended drug of choice. However, evidence suggests that intramuscular midazolam has at least equal efficacy in prehospital settings and may be more appropriate for use in this environment. Despite the support of multiple clinical trials and treatment guidelines, inconsistencies in the treatment of acute SE continue to occur in both the prehospital and ED settings.", 
    "143": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a metabolic hormone that is secreted in a glucose-dependent manner and enhances insulin secretion. GLP-1 receptors are also found in the brain where their signalling affects neuronal activity. We have previously shown that the GLP-1 receptor agonists, GLP-1 and exendin-4 enhanced GABA-activated synaptic and tonic currents in rat hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. The hippocampus is the centre for memory and learning and is important for cognition. Here we examined if exendin-4 similarly enhanced the GABA-activated currents in the presence of the benzodiazepine diazepam. In whole-cell recordings in rat brain slices, diazepam (1 \u03bcM), an allosteric positive modulator of GABAA receptors, alone enhanced the spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sIPSC) amplitude and frequency by a factor of 1.3 and 1.6, respectively, and doubled the tonic GABAA current normally recorded in the CA3 pyramidal cells. Importantly, in the presence of exendin-4 (10 nM) plus diazepam (1 \u03bcM), only the tonic but not the sIPSC currents transiently increased as compared to currents recorded in the presence of diazepam alone. The results suggest that exendin-4 potentiates a subpopulation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in the CA3 pyramidal neurons.",

In humans, severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) is due to SCN1A gene mutation, which causes a non-inactivating sodium channels condition with seizures. Some symptoms, such as age of first seizure, repetitive events, frequent status epilepticus, scarce responsiveness to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), may be due to superimposed environmental causes. The authors report a case of SMEI treated for years with benzodiazepines and subsequently with valproate. The attenuation of the frequency of epileptic events and of time in seizing, but no change in burst duration and EEG events was observed. These results are similar to those reported in the literature about zebrafish scn1Lab mutant, which recapitulates the SCN1A symptoms and AED resistance occurring in humans. During seizures the production of polypeptides similar to sea anemones neurotoxins, causing repetitive seizures, status epilepticus, and AED resistance can be hypothesized in subjects with SCN1A mutation.",

We aimed to garner preliminary data on the real-world use of olanzapine and aripiprazole as augmentation agents of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) in adult inpatients affected by AN. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical charts of patients who were hospitalized between 2012 and 2014. Patients were evaluated upon admission and discharge. We investigated eating symptomatology, and both general and eating psychopathology using: Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorders Scale. The charts of 75 patients were included in this study. The sample resulted equally distributed among those receiving SSRIs and either aripiprazole or olanzapine in addition to SSRIs. Notwithstanding a few baseline clinical differences, upon discharge all groups were significantly improved on all measures. Interestingly, aripiprazole showed the greatest effectiveness in reducing eating-related preoccupations and rituals with a large effect size. The body of evidence on medication management in AN is in dismal condition. Augmentation therapy is a well-established approach to a variety of mental disorders and it is often used in every-day clinical practice with patients affected by AN as well. Nevertheless, to date very little data is available on this topic. Results from our sample yielded promising results on the effectiveness of aripiprazole augmentation in reducing eating-related obsessions and compulsions. Randomized controlled trials are warranted to confirm these encouraging findings.",

Melatonin, temazepam and zolpidem are thought to exert their effect through different mechanisms of action, but whether this leads to differential effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) power spectra during sleep in middle-aged people is currently not known. To establish whether the effects of prolonged-release melatonin (2 mg) on the nocturnal sleep EEG are different to those of temazepam (20 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg). Sixteen healthy men and women aged 55-64 years participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way cross-over trial. Nocturnal sleep was assessed with polysomnography and spectral analysis of the EEG. The effects of single oral doses of prolonged-release melatonin, temazepam and zolpidem on EEG slow-wave activity (SWA, 0.75-4.5 Hz) and other frequencies during nocturnal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep were compared. In an entire night analysis prolonged-release melatonin did not affect SWA, whereas temazepam and zolpidem significantly reduced SWA compared with placebo. Temazepam significantly reduced SWA compared with prolonged-release melatonin. Prolonged-release melatonin only reduced SWA during the first third of the night compared with placebo. These data show that the effects of prolonged-release melatonin on the nocturnal sleep EEG are minor and are different from those of temazepam and zolpidem; this is likely due to the different mechanisms of action of the medications.",

To this end, we established and optimised a procedure using LC-MS/MS simultaneously to analyse 28 narcotic compounds in various forms of dietary supplements, including powders, tablets, liquids and capsules. In addition, candy and cookies that have also had detected cases of adulteration were also analysed. The specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), stability and recovery for these methods were validated accordingly. The LOD and LOQ of the LC-MS/MS ranged from 0.01-50.0 to 0.03-100\u00a0ng\u00a0g(-1), respectively. The linearity of these results was good (r(2)\u00a0>\u00a00.99), with intra- and inter-day precision values of 0.2-5.2% and 0.2-4.8%, respectively. Further, the intra- and inter-day accuracies of this method were 97.0-103.4% and 94.6-103.1%, respectively. The stability RSD was less than 7.8%. The mean recovery for this LC-MS/MS procedure was 81.1-117.4%, with an RSD less than 9.8%. Following the validation of our method, we analysed 47 commercially available dietary supplements obtained in Korea. Whilst none of these samples had detectable amounts of the 28 specified narcotic adulterants, our novel LC-MS/MS procedure can be utilised comprehensively and continually to monitor illegal drug adulteration in various forms of dietary supplements.",

The absolute recovery rates of BZDs were above 90.65%. The limits of detection (LOD) were 20 ng/mL for chlordiazepoxide, estazolam, temazepam and midazolam, and 30 ng/mL for clonazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam and medazepam, while the LOQ was set at 50 ng/mL for chlordiazepoxide, estazolam, temazepam and midazolam, and 100 ng/mL for clonazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam and medazepam. Linearity was confirmed in the range of 50-2,000 ng/mL for chlordiazepoxide, estazolam, temazepam and midazolam, and 100-2,000 ng/mL for clonazepam, lorazepam, lormetazepam and medazepam, with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9987 for all analytes. The elaborated procedure meets all the requirements of analytical methods. During the extraction procedure, a mixture of 1 mL of ethanol and 500 \u00b5L of dichloromethane, used as the disperser and extraction solvent, respectively, was rapidly injected into 3 mL of a urine sample. A significant improvement in sensitivity was achieved when DLLME was used to extract BZDs from the urine sample and FASS as an on-line preconcentration technique was developed. For the best separation of analytes, the running buffer was composed of 30 mM SDS, 10 mM sodium tetraborate and 15% methanol (pH 8.8), whereas a sample buffer was composed of 10 mM SDS and 2 mM sodium tetraborate. Moreover, a fused-silica capillary [inner diameter (i.d.) of 75 \u00b5m and length of 50 cm], photodiode array detection, pneumatic injection for 15 s and a voltage of 23 kV were applied.

The present review provides evidence-based management insights into anesthesia for bronchoscopy-both flexible and rigid. A systematic approach toward pre-procedural evaluation and risk stratification is presented. The possible anatomical and physiological factors that can influence the outcomes are discussed. Pharmacological principles guiding sedation levels and appropriate selection of sedatives form the crux of safe anesthetic management. The newer and safer drugs that can have potential role in anesthesia for bronchoscopy in the near future are discussed. Ventilatory strategies during bronchoscopy for prevention of hypoxia and hypercarbia are emphasized.", 
    "172": "Exposure to organophosphorous (OP) nerve agents such as soman inhibits the critical enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) leading to excessive acetylcholine accumulation in synapses, resulting in cholinergic crisis, status epilepticus and brain damage in survivors. The hippocampus is profoundly damaged after soman exposure leading to long-term memory deficits. We have previously shown that treatment with three sequential doses of alpha-linolenic acid, an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, increases brain plasticity in na\u00efve animals. However, the effects of this dosing schedule administered after a brain insult and the underlying molecular mechanisms in the hippocampus are unknown. We now show that injection of three sequential doses of alpha-linolenic acid after soman exposure increases the endogenous expression of mature BDNF, activates Akt and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), increases neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, increases retention latency in the passive avoidance task and increases animal survival. In sharp contrast, while soman exposure also increases mature BDNF, this increase did not activate downstream signaling pathways or neurogenesis. Administration of the inhibitor of mTORC1, rapamycin, blocked the alpha-linolenic acid-induced neurogenesis and the enhanced retention latency but did not affect animal survival. Our results suggest that alpha-linolenic acid induces a long-lasting neurorestorative effect that involves activation of mTORC1 possibly via a BDNF-TrkB-mediated mechanism.",

History of Present Illness: The patient has a history of psychiatric illness. Her primary care physician from an outside facility had prescribed alprazolam (Xanax) to treat her depression. The patient reported that in 2011 she experienced pain in the right side of her back and was diagnosed with sciatica. In addition, she was diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) based on a positive finding for antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA). She had not consulted a rheumatologist before this visit, nor had she received any medication for these conditions. Her recent history of symptoms included photosensitivity, painful aphthous ulcers, transient rashes, joint pain, myalgias, and bruising. The results of the most recent evaluation of her SLE serology revealed negative ANA and ds-DNA results. The current medications that the patient has been prescribed at Santa Clara Valley Medical Center include lamotrigine (Lamictal), sertraline (Zoloft), and gabapentin (Neurontin). In April 2014, the patient requested additional pain medication, such as hydrocodone/acetaminophen (Norco), during her physician visit. Consequently, as part of her pain management therapy agreement to ensure compliance,(1) she was subjected to a urine toxicology drug screening. At this time, her urine specimen, from an unwitnessed collection, tested positive for benzodiazepines using the Syva EMIT immunoassay (Siemens AG, Munich, Germany) at the cutoff of 200 ng/mL. However, results of a confirmatory test conducted via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) did not identify any benzodiazepine metabolites in her urine but instead revealed the presence of a parent drug, alprazolam. Further, the same specimen tested positive for metronidazole. A visual inspection of the specimen revealed crystals on the bottom of the cup. In December 2013, this patient had tested positive for \u03b1-hydroxyalprazolam (an alprazolam metabolite; limit of detection, 10 ng/mL) and methamphetamine.

    "184": "To review the literature about febrile seizures and GEFS plus with special emphasis on management and outcome. Selected literature review. Febrile seizures are the most common convulsive event in humans, occurring in 2-6% of the population. The aetiology is complex with strong evidence for a heterogeneous genetic predisposition interacting with fever of any cause, with certain viral infections having a greater effect. A large amount of literature has established that febrile seizures have no long-term consequences on cognition or behaviour. Unfortunately, about 40% of children with a first febrile seizure will have a recurrence. The strongest predictor of recurrence is age <14-16 months at the time of the first febrile seizure. Epilepsy follows febrile seizures in \u223c3% cases, with the concepts of simple and complex febrile seizures providing relatively weak prediction. Very prolonged febrile seizures may lead to mesial temporal sclerosis and temporal lobe epilepsy although the degree of risk remains uncertain. Investigations beyond establishing the cause of the provoking fever are nearly always unnecessary. Treatment is mainly reassurance and there is some evidence that parents eventually \"come to grips\" with the fear that their children are dying during a febrile seizure. Antipyretic medications are remarkably ineffective to prevent recurrences. Daily and intermittent prophylactic medications are ineffective or have unacceptable side effects or risks. \"Rescue\" benzodiazepines may prevent prolonged recurrences for selected patients with a first prolonged febrile seizure although this has not been proven. Genetic epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+) is a complex autosomal dominant disorder usually caused by mutations in SCN1A (a voltage-gated sodium channel). One third of patients have febrile seizures only; two thirds have a variety of epilepsy syndromes, both focal and generalized. Febrile seizures may distress parents but rarely have any long-term consequences. Reassurance is the only treatment for the vast majority. Identifying patients with GEFS plus may lead to further investigations and counselling.",

However, multivariate logistic-regression analyses revealed greater odds for antidementia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.976, P = .0195) and benzodiazepine (OR = 3.046, P = .0227) medication use in postwarning period compared to the prewarning period.", 
    "194": "The regulatory warnings and labeling changes regarding off-label use of AAPs in dementia treatment showed minimal impact on their actual use in noninstitutionalized populations. A corresponding increase in the use of nonantipsychotic psychotropics explains that BBW might have resulted in a compensatory shift in favor of benzodiazepines and antidementia medications. Additional research should be conducted to examine the long-term impact of BBW on antipsychotic prescribing changes.", 
    "195": "The US Food and Drug Administration approval process for psychotropic drugs requires safety studies of carcinogenicity in animals. These studies are consistently conducted and provide a database for assessment of potential biological risk of carcinogenicity in humans. This report is a systematic review of that database for psychotropic drugs.", 
    "196": "US Food and Drug Administration-approved registration data ('package inserts') were examined, where available, for all psychotropic drugs in the following classes: antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines/sedative-hypnotics, amphetamines and anticonvulsants.", 
    "197": "Overall, new generation (atypical) antipsychotics (90%, 9/10 agents) and anticonvulsants (85.7%, 6/7 agents) showed the highest evidence of carcinogenicity among psychotropic drugs classes assessed. Antidepressants (63.6%, 7/11) and benzodiazepines/sedative-hypnotics (70%, 7/10) were next, and stimulants (with the exception of methylphenidate) were last (25%, 1/4 agents). Overall, 71.4% of all drugs examined (30/42) showed evidence of carcinogenicity in 43.2% (38/88) of specific experimental studies.", 
    "198": "US Food and Drug Administration-based analyses demonstrate that almost all atypical antipsychotics and anticonvulsants are carcinogenic in animals, as are the majority of antidepressants and benzodiazepines and methylphenidate. These animal-based results are not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions in humans, but they provide data that could be acknowledged in the informed consent process of clinical treatment.", 
    "199": "Altered expression of transcription factor specificity protein 4 (SP4) has been found in the postmortem brain of patients with psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Reduced levels of SP4 protein have recently been reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in first-episode psychosis. Also, SP4 levels are modulated by lithium treatment in cultured neurons. Phosphorylation of SP4 at S770 is increased in the cerebellum of bipolar disorder subjects and upon inhibition of NMDA receptor signaling in cultured neurons. The aim of this study was to investigate whether SP4 S770 phosphorylation is increased in lymphocytes of first-episode psychosis patients and the effect of lithium treatment on this phosphorylation.", 
    "200": "A cross-sectional study of S770 phosphorylation relative to total SP4 immunoreactivity using specific antibodies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in first-episode psychosis patients (n = 14, treated with lithium or not) and matched healthy controls (n = 14) by immunoblot was designed. We also determined the effects of the prescribed drugs lithium, olanzapine or valproic acid on SP4 phosphorylation in rat primary cultured cerebellar granule neurons.", 
    "201": "We found that SP4 S770 phosphorylation was significantly increased in lymphocytes in first-episode psychosis compared to controls and decreased in patients treated with lithium compared to patients who did not receive lithium. Moreover, incubation with lithium but not olanzapine or valproic acid reduced SP4 phosphorylation in rat cultured cerebellar granule neurons.", 
    "202": "The findings presented here indicate that SP4 S770 phosphorylation is increased in lymphocytes in first-episode psychosis which may be reduced by lithium treatment in patients. Moreover, our study shows lithium treatment prevents this phosphorylation in vitro in neurons. This pilot study suggests that S770 SP4 phosphorylation could be a peripheral biomarker of psychosis, and may be regulated by lithium treatment in first-episode psychosis.", 
    "203": "Application of transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) between 0.1 and 640 Hz of the primary motor cortex (M1) for 10 min induces a persistent excitability increase lasting for at least 60 min. However, the mechanism of tRNS-induced cortical excitability alterations is not yet fully understood.", 
    "204": "The main aim of this study was to get first efficacy data with regard to the possible neuronal effect of tRNS.", 
    "205": "Single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to measure levels of cortical excitability before and after combined application of tRNS at an intensity of 1 mA for 10 min stimulation duration and a pharmacological agent (or sham) on eight healthy male participants.", 
    "206": "The sodium channel blocker carbamazepine showed a tendency toward inhibiting MEPs 5-60 min poststimulation. The GABA A agonist lorazepam suppressed tRNS-induced cortical excitability increases at 0-20 and 60 min time points. The partial NMDA receptor agonist D-cycloserine, the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphan and the D2/D3 receptor agonist ropinirole had no significant effects on the excitability increases seen with tRNS.", 
    "207": "In contrast to transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), aftereffects of tRNS are seem to be not NMDA receptor dependent and can be suppressed by benzodiazepines suggesting that tDCS and tRNS depend upon different mechanisms.", 
    "208": "The possibility that fish experience pain has been denied based on the absence of the neural substrates to support this \"experience\". In this context, the identification of brain regions involved in nociception modulation could provide important insights regarding the processing of nociceptive information in fish. Our study evaluated the participation of the GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor in the dorsomedial (Dm) telencephalon in restraint-induced antinociception in the fish Leporinus macrocephalus through the microinjection of the anxiolytic drug midazolam. The microinjection of midazolam in the Dm did not alter the nocifensive response; however, this drug did block the inhibition of the nocifensive response to formaldehyde promoted by restraint stress. The fish that received midazolam (40nmol) microinjection prior to restraint (3 or 5min), followed by subcutaneous injection with formaldehyde presented a higher distance traveled than the fish that received saline microinjection. This effect might reflect the specific action of midazolam on benzodiazepine receptors in the Dm telencephalon, as pre-treatment with flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, inhibited the effects of this drug. In the present study, we present the first evidence demonstrating a role for the dorsomedial telencephalic region in the modulation of stress-induced antinociception in fish, revealing new perspectives in the understanding of nociceptive information processing in this group.", 
    "209": "In order to investigate the pharmacokinetics of a combination of diazepam and dexamethasone under hypoxic conditions, a novel, sensitive and specific liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of diazepam and dexamethasone in rat plasma was developed and validated. The chromatographic separation of analytes was successfully achieved on an XTerra\u00ae MS C18 column using a gradient elution of methanol and water containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. This method demonstrated good linearity and no endogenous material interferences. The linear ranges were 1.0-100 ng/mL for diazepam and 2.0-200 ng/mL for dexamethasone. The intra- and inter-day precision for the two compounds in plasma were lower than 10.0%, and the accuracy was between -7.9% and 11.5%. Our method was then successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic comparison between normoxic and hypoxic rats. The results indicated that there were significant differences in the main pharmacokinetics parameters of diazepam and dexamethasone between normoxic and hypoxic rats. The results provide the important and valuable information for discovering and developing novel anti-hypoxia drug combinations, as well as a better understanding of the safety and efficacy of these drugs.", 
    "210": "The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of sedoanalgesia performed outside the operating room by pediatricians trained in advanced airway management and life support.", 
    "211": "Midazolam and ketamine were administered consecutively by intravenous route under cardiorespiratory monitoring for painful procedures of pediatric hematology.", 
    "212": "A total of 115 patients had 237 sedoanalgesia sessions. Sedation time was 24.02\u00b123.37 s and sedation success was 92.5% (Ramsay scores of \u22655). Patient satisfaction was high. The recovery time was 28.81\u00b114.4 min. Although statistically significant (p<0.01) increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate were observed without clinical importance, they improved without any intervention. No severe adverse events were observed.", 
    "213": "Sedoanalgesia with intravenous midazolam and ketamine for pediatric hematology and oncology patients' painful minor invasive procedures performed in an optimally equipped setting outside the operating room by pediatricians trained and certificated in advanced airway management and life support is effective and safe.",
