    "0": "Two open clinical studies were done to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness and safety of Halazepam. These studies were carried out on an overall sampling of 81 somatic patients suffering from adaptive disorders and symptoms of anxiety, according to DSMIII criteria. The sampling was made up of 40 patients referred for general psychiatric consultation in the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal Hospital (from any other medical or surgical department) and 41 cardiologic patients (both in- and out-patients). The mean age of the patients referred for general consultation was 40.0, and the mean age of the cardiologic patients was 55.5 years. The posologic standard was 20-120 mg/day, in a single dose or divided into several doses. The following clinical evaluation criteria were applied: Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HS), Physician Evaluation of Improvement (PhEI) and Patient Evaluation of Improvement (PaEI). To determine the safety of the medication, a modified Dotes Secondary Effects Scale was used. At the beginning of the study all the patients had scores of less than or equal to 18 on the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDS) and greater than or equal to 14 on the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. From the first week on till the end of treatment, a statistically significant improvement was observed, based on the scores of the different evaluation scales. Halazepam was found to improve the anxiety condition in 95.0% of the cardiologic patients and 92.5% of the general consultation group. All of the cardiologic patients and 87.5% of the general consultation ones completed the minimum study period (4 weeks) satisfactorily. The only undesirable effects observed were minor and short-lived, and it was not necessary to discontinue treatment in any of the cases. No changes were observed in the clinical significance of the analytic parameters monitored. The results of this study indicate that Halazepam is a fast, safe, effective and easy-to-use drug for treating anxiety.", 
    "1": "Healthy volunteers with quite opposite emotional properties defined by means of Cattell Personality Questionnaires were shown to have essential differences in their postvaccinal reactions. These differences were seemingly caused by psychoemotional tension developing in unstable persons as a result of their perception of vaccination as a threatening factor. The administration of Phenasepam (3 mg) decreased such emotional tension and thus removed negative reactions at the postvaccinal period. The preparation had no influence on the production of protective antibodies to all types of antigens used for immunization.", 
    "2": "The synthesis of Pyrimido[4,5-b][1,5]benzodiazepine derivatives from 4-(o-aminophenylene)amino-5-ethoxy-carbonyl-1,2-dihydro-6-methyl-2 - oxopyrimidine has been described. Pyrimidobenzodiazepine 5 alkylated with N-methyl-N'-chloroacetyl-piperazine gives a product related to pirenzepine. Compound 5 shows weak antianxiety and antidepressive action.", 
    "3": "We examined the effects of the combined use of H2-receptor antagonist (roxatidine) and muscarinic receptor antagonist (pirenzepine) by oral administration on gastric juice and acid secretion in humans. The volume, pH level, and acidity of gastric juice were determined in the sample collected at 9:00 AM 10 hr after either the oral administration of 150 mg of roxatidine or the combined administration of 150 mg of roxatidine and 50 mg of pirenzepine. Significant decrease in volume and acidity and increase in pH were observed in both roxatidine group and combined group compared with control placebo group, but significant difference were not observed in gastric pH and acidity between roxatidine group and combined group. The volume of gastric juice was decreased significantly by the combined administration in comparison with the sole administration of roxatidine. Consequently, the combined oral administration of the two agents was considered to be more effective than the sole administration of roxatidine for clinical cases which require stronger suppression of gastric secretion at the night.", 
    "4": "The effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscimol, baclofen and the anxiolytics; diazepam (DZP), flurazepam (FZP) and zopiclone on single-unit neural activities in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) were investigated using the rat hypothalamic slice preparation. Exposure of the slice to GABA 10(-4) M produced inhibitory responses in 65% of the 49 SCN neurons examined. The threshold concentration of GABA ranged from 10(-6) to 10(-4) M. Neurons responsive to GABA were not found to be restricted to a subdivision of the SCN, but were diffusely distributed throughout the nucleus. DZP, FZP and zopiclone produced responses similar to those of GABA. The inhibitory effects of GABA (10(-5) M) were potentiated by coadministration of DZP (10(-5) M). Muscimol and baclofen (10(-7) M to 10(-4) M) also inhibited SCN neuronal activity in a dose-dependent manner. Bicuculline (10(-5) M-10(-4) M) scarcely affected the baclofen-induced inhibition (1/6) but strongly antagonized the effects of muscimol (6/6), GABA (6/8) and DZP (4/5). These results suggest that the receptors mediating the inhibitory effects of GABA and anxiolytics within the SCN may be GABAA and/or GABAB or GABA-BDZ receptor complex, respectively.", 
    "5": "The effects of diazepam and low concentrations of bicuculline methiodide (BMI) on the expression of long-latency N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated activity was studied in supragranular layers of juvenile (14-18 days old) and adult rat (greater than or equal to 28 days) primary somatosensory cortex. In juvenile slices, orthodromic stimulation of layer VI/white matter evoked a long-lasting oscillatory field potential response which could be blocked by the NMDA receptor antagonist D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV) and by diazepam. Similar D-APV-sensitive responses could be observed in adult slices when the GABAergic system was slightly suppressed by adding low doses of BMI to the bathing solution. Our findings indicate that a small decrease in the efficacy of the inhibitory system, whether caused by developmental events or by processes that modulate inhibitory electrogenesis, can lead to NMDA receptor-mediated synchronized afterdischarges, which might play an important role in the functional maturation of the neocortex and in susceptibility to epileptogenesis.", 
    "6": "The psychopharmacologic treatment of persons with mental retardation who exhibit aggressive or self-injurious syndromes is varied and controversial. Many psychotropic agents (e.g., antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, lithium, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, and narcotic antagonists) have been used; currently, none of these have been studied sufficiently to recommend them unequivocally, and most have serious potential side effects. A new group of medications, blockers of the beta-adrenergic function of the sympathetic nervous system, have been postulated to have efficacy in some aggressive or self-injurious persons. This literature was reviewed, a relevant case report presented, and concerns raised regarding premature endorsement of beta-blocking medications before they have been adequately studied.", 
    "7": "The present article forms part of an investigation which has been carried on continuously under the auspices of the Conference of Swiss Sanitary Directors with the aim of providing evidence on the frequency of drug dependence in inpatients of psychiatric hospitals. The investigation is an important source of information concerning trends in drug dependence patterns. In this study, it was possible to observe a change in preference with regard to the use of analgetic compounds over the past years. The decreasing use of barbiturates was found to have been replaced by an increased intake of benzodiazepines. Dependence on heroin has increasingly been observed in recent years. On the whole, multiple drug dependence combined with alcoholism are at present the most frequently observed forms of dependence.", 
    "8": "In rats, pretraining ip administration of the central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg), or of the inverse agonist, n-butyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (BCCB) (0.2 or 0.5 mg/kg), facilitated retention of a step-down inhibitory avoidance task; the central agonists, clonazepam and diazepam (0.4 or 1.0 mg/kg), had an opposite effect, and the peripheral agonist, 4'-chlordiazepam (1.25 or 6.25 mg/kg), was without effect. Pre- but not post-training flumazenil (2.0 mg/kg) blocked the effect of BCCB (0.5 mg/kg), clonazepam (1.0 mg/kg), or diazepam (1.0 mg/kg) given also pretraining. The post-training administration of all of these drugs had no effect on retention of the avoidance task. Flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) and BCCB (0.5 mg/kg), given before training, enhanced retention test performance of habituation to a buzzer but not of habituation to an open field. In the three tasks studied, none of the drugs used had any appreciable effect on training session parameters. These results suggest that there is an endogenous mechanism mediated by benzodiazepine agonists, sensitive to inverse agonists, that normally down-regulates acquisition of certain behaviors; this mechanism becomes activated only when the tasks involve or occur with a certain degree of stress or anxiety (i.e., inhibitory avoidance or habituation to the buzzer) and not in less stressful or anxiogenic tasks (i.e., habituation to an open field).", 
    "9": "Groups of 50 male and 50 female Sprague-Dawley rats were given food containing sufficient doxefazepam, a benzodiazepine derivative, to ensure intakes of 0, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg/day. These dosages respectively correspond to 2, 20, and 60 times the mean daily hypnotic dose level of an adult man. Rats were treated for 104 weeks and then euthanized. An extensive autopsy was performed on those animals that died intercurrently and on euthanized animals. The chronic administration of doxefazepam did not influence the survival of the rats. No treatment-related changes in clinical signs and body weight gains occurred and malignant tumor rates were similar in controls and treated animals. A significant linear trend in the incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily benign, was observed in the female treated groups. This higher incidence was not associated to a higher occurrence of focal hyperplasia or other preneoplastic lesions in treated rats. The brain, a target organ for the pharmacological activity of doxefazepam, was carefully examined to search for microscopic foci of proliferative cells. A total of 12 and 6 malignant gliomas were observed in male and female rats, respectively; only two were noticed at autopsy. These tumors were mainly of the oligodendroglioma type commonly found in aged rats. Their incidence was slightly higher in treated rats, but results were not of statistical significance. The overall evaluation of the present study indicates that doxefazepam is noncarcinogenic in rats. However, the increase in liver adenomas found here as well as in previous bioassays with similar drugs and the lack of reliable historical data on the incidence of brain tumors in benzodiazepine-treated rodents suggest that additional experimental and epidemiological studies should be undertaken to exhaustively assess the toxic potential of this widely used class of drugs.", 
    "10": "Brain extracts from rats with hepatic encephalopathy due to thioacetamide-induced fulminant hepatic failure contained 4- to 6-fold higher concentrations of substances that inhibit radioligand binding to benzodiazepine receptors than corresponding control rat extracts. Both isocratic and gradient-elution HPLC indicated that this inhibitory activity was localized in 3-8 peaks with retention times corresponding to deschlorodiazepam, deschlorolorazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, diazepam, and N-desmethyldiazepam. The presence of diazepam and N-desmethyldiazepam was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. Both mass spectroscopic and radiometric techniques indicated that the concentrations of N-desmethyldiazepam and diazepam in brain extracts from encephalopathic rats were 2-9 and 5-7 times higher, respectively, than in control brain extracts. While benzodiazepines have been identified previously in mammalian and plant tissues, this report demonstrates that concentrations of these substances are increased in a pathophysiological condition. These findings provide a rational basis for the use of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists in the management of hepatic encephalopathy in humans.", 
    "11": "The halothane-sparing effect of 2 benzodiazepines, diazepam and temazepam, were investigated in ponies by measuring the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) for halothane before and after drug administration. The MAC value for halothane decreased 29% and 16% when either 0.044 mg/kg of diazepam or 0.044 mg/kg of temazepam, respectively, was administered intravenously. Heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic and mean arterial blood pressure, and expired CO2 were also measured. No differences were present in these variables before and after drug administration nor were differences noted between the benzodiazepines.", 
    "12": "The muscarinic receptors responsible for two effects elicited by McN-A-343, i.e. the relaxation of the rat duodenum and the inhibition of the twitch contraction of rabbit vas deferens, were investigated by use of derivatives of 4-diphenyl acetoxy-N-methyl piperidine methobromide (4-DAMP). Both receptors had been previously identified as M1 on the basis of the high affinity shown towards pirenzepine. Schild analysis of antagonism revealed that the affinities of 4-DAMP and three of its analogues in the rat duodenum were significantly different from those estimated in rabbit vas deferens. These data indicate that distinct receptor subtypes mediate duodenal relaxation and vas deferens inhibition of twitch contraction and suggest that receptors classified as M1 by means of pirenzepine affinity constitute a heterogeneous population.", 
    "13": "Supramaximal cerulein administration induces acute pancreatitis, which markedly impairs pancreatic secretion in conscious rats. We hypothesized that pretreatment with the potent cholecystokinin antagonist, L-364,718, improves the pancreatic secretory impairment associated with cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis. Rats were surgically prepared with gastric, duodenal, bile, and pancreatic fistulas and jugular vein catheters. On postoperative day 4, groups of rats were administered (a) L-364,718 1 mg/kg intraduodenally, (b) cerulein 5 micrograms/kg/h for 6 h intravenously, (c) L-364,718 1 mg/kg intraduodenally followed by cerulein 5 micrograms/kg/h for 6 h intravenously, and (d) safflower oil carrier intraduodenally. On postoperative day 5, we studied cholecystokinin (CCK)-stimulated pancreatic secretion. Plasma amylase was measured at the time of surgery and at the conclusion of experiments on postoperative days 4 and 5. The duodenally administered CCK antagonist had no effect, 24 h later, on CCK-evoked protein secretion and prevented the pancreatic exocrine impairment and hyperamylasemia caused by supramaximal cerulein administration. These observations suggest that cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis is mediated by a CCK-receptor mechanism.", 
    "14": "Severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI) is a newly recognized epileptic syndrome. It is characterized by multiple febrile seizures, often prolonged, subsequent development of uncontrollable mixed-myoclonic seizures, and, eventually, psychomotor retardation. Drugs for myoclonic epilepsy--valproate (VPA), the suximides, and the benzodiazepines--have been shown to be useful in SMEI. Among children with seizures in the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), one individual with SMEI was identified. This finding from the NCPP suggests that the incidence of SMEI is approximately 1 in 40,000 children. Such an incidence is supported by observations at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center.", 
    "15": "A rapid and sensitive method of extraction of human plasma containing acetaminophen, chlorzoxazone, oxyphenbutazone and diazepam along with their active metabolites was developed. The plasma samples were extracted by a solid-phase extraction procedure with theophylline as an internal standard for accurate quantitation. The reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method provided a linear ultraviolet detector response in the range 100.0-700.0 ng/ml. Recoveries greater than 95% were achieved from human plasma samples. Limits of detection of 100, 200, 150 and 250 ng/ml for acetaminophen, chlorzoxazone, oxyphenbutazone and diazepam, respectively, were obtained.", 
    "16": "The microscopic distribution of omega 3 (peripheral type benzodiazepine) binding sites in sections from normal and ischaemic rat brain has been determined by emulsion autoradiography with the photoaffinity ligand [3H]PK 14105. In the normal rat brain, high densities of omega 3 sites were present in the ependymal cells, the apical pole of the secretory cells in the choroid plexus and astrocyte-like cells in the outer cellular layer of the olfactory bulb. In ischaemic brain lesions caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats or in spontaneous ischaemic and haemorrhagic lesions in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats, the proliferating omega 3 sites were associated with reactive glial cells and macrophages.", 
    "17": "GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptors of Achatina fulica neurones have been classified into two types associated with neuronal inhibition and one type with excitation. The pharmacological features of muscimol I and baclofen types associated with inhibition were investigated in this study. Activation of muscimol I type receptors on TAN (tonically autoactive neurone) by GABA, muscimol and trans-4-aminocrotonic acid (TACA) produced a transient outward current (Iout) with an increase in membrane conductance (g). Their relative potencies at GABA ED50 (approximately 10(-4) M) were: GABA: muscimol: TACA = 1:0.6:0.3. The relation between Iout and g increase (delta g) induced by various concentrations of these compounds was linear. The Hill coefficients for GABA were close to 1.0. The GABA effects were potentiated by pentobarbitone, antagonized competitively by pitrazepin and non-competitively by picrotoxin and diazepam, and unaffected by bicuculline. The reversal potentials of the effects of GABA, muscimol and TACA on TAN changed under various [Cl-]0 according to the Nernst equation for Ec1, but not under various [K+]0 and [Na+]0. Activation of baclofen type GABA receptors on RPeNLN (right pedal nerve large neurone) by GABA and (+/-)-baclofen produced a slow Iout with an increase in g. The two compounds were almost equipotent (ED50: approximately 3 x 10(-4) M). The relation between Iout and delta g produced by various concentrations was linear. The Hill coefficients for GABA were also close to 1.0. The reversal potentials of GABA and (+/-)-baclofen on RPeNLN changed under various [K+]0 according to the Nernst equation for EK, but not under various [Cl-]0 and [Na+]0. The two compounds hardly affected the voltage-gated and slowly inactivating calcium current. The Iout produced by GABA and (+/-)-baclofen was reduced by tetraethylammonium chloride, but was unaffected by 4-aminopyridine, bicuculline, pitrazepin and picrotoxin. In conclusion, the pharmacological features of muscimol I type GABA receptors are partly comparable to those of mammalian GABAA receptors, except for the influences of bicuculline and diazepam: the features of the baclofen type GABA receptor, which did not occur with muscimol I type receptors in the same neurone, were similar to those of GABAB.", 
    "18": "The anticonvulsive properties of a new compound: F1933 (Dulozafone) were investigated in the amygdala kindling model and compared with those of diazepam. Both drugs protected fully kindled rats against generalized seizures but failed to suppress partial ictal events (amygdala afterdischarges and limbic seizures). The anticonvulsive action of F1933, administered at the ED100, was nearly reversed by the specific antagonist of benzodiazepines receptors; R015-1788 (Flumazenil), suggesting that the effect of F1933 is mediated by this receptor. These results also emphasize the usefulness of kindling to test antiepileptic drugs and to confirm their supposed profile of action.", 
    "19": "The release of [3H]acetylcholine ([3H]ACh) and its modulation mediated by autoreceptors were investigated in synaptosomes prepared from fresh human cerebral cortex prelabelled with [3H]choline ([3H]Ch) and depolarized in superfusion with 15 mM KCl. The K(+)-evoked release of tritium was almost totally accounted for by unmetabolized [3H]ACh and was largely calcium-dependent. Exogenous ACh decreased the depolarization-evoked release of [3H]ACh in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 1.5 microM). The inhibitory effect of ACh on [3H]ACh release was counteracted by the non-selective muscarinic antagonist atropine. In contrast, the selective M1 receptor antagonist pirenzepine was ineffective. It is concluded that muscarinic autoreceptors regulating the release of ACh are present on cholinergic nerve terminals of human cerebral cortex and appear to belong to a pirenzepine-insensitive subtype.", 
    "20": "A new procedure is described for assessing the sensitivity of the benzodiazepine receptor in intact animals. This procedure measures the ability of benzodiazepines to antagonize electrically-induced seizures precipitated by incremental increases in voltage. This functional measure detected stress-induced alterations in benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity, an alteration shown previously with in vitro and in vivo receptor binding techniques. In contrast, mouse rotorod performance, which has been proposed as a behavioral measure of benzodiazepine receptor sensitivity did not show stress-induced alterations. The mechanism of these stress-induced alterations was explored using this incremental electroconvulsive shock procedure (IECS). A 'GABA-negative' benzodiazepine mimicked the effects of swim stress, whereas treatment of animals prior to swim stress with Ro15-1788, a 'GABA-neutral' benzodiazepine, attenuated these stress-induced alterations. These data suggest both that these stress effects may be mediated by an endogenous ligand, and that Ro15-1788 may have a novel indication as a prophylactic intervention for individuals at risk for exposure to severe and unusual stress.", 
    "21": "The cholinergic agonist pilocarpine triggers sustained limbic seizures in rodents. Pilocarpine seizures were blocked by systemic administration of benzodiazepines, barbiturates, valproate and trimethadione, while diphenylhydantoin did not affect, and ethosuximide increased the susceptibility of rats to such seizures. This pattern of action of antiepileptic drugs is characteristic for pilocarpine seizures and different from other rodent models of epilepsy. Although the anatomical substrates in the forebrain involved in the expression of anticonvulsant activity are unknown, the basal ganglia are believed to be essential for the motor expression of pilocarpine seizures. Bilateral microinjections into the substantia nigra, a major output station of the basal ganglia, of midazolam (ED50 38.5 nmol; range 29-52 nmol), phenobarbital (ED50 16 nmol; range 7-39 nmol) and trimethadione (ED50 30 nmol; range 16-56 nmol) protected rats against pilocarpine seizures (380 mg/kg i.p.) Diphenylhydantoin (up to 100 nmol) remained inactive, while ethosuximide (ED50 38 nmol; range 22-65.5 nmol) reduced the threshold for pilocarpine seizures, converting subconvulsant doses of pilocarpine (200 mg/kg i.p.) into convulsant ones. The profiles of action of antiepileptic drugs on pilocarpine seizures were similar following intranigral and systemic administration. These observations suggest that the substantia nigra may mediate some actions of antiepileptic drugs.", 
    "22": "The anxiety disorders are common reasons for patients approaching their doctors for help. While benzodiazepines used to be the treatments most commonly used, increasing concern about the wisdom of prescribing these drugs means that other treatments have to be considered. A differential diagnostic schema for patients who complain of anxiety is presented and an outline for counselling these patients is described. Treatment of the four major anxiety disorders is evaluated, and the efficacy of drug treatment compared to various levels of behaviour therapy. Cognitive behaviour therapy is recommended for all four disorders on the grounds of a short-term effectiveness comparable to drug therapy and evidence for stability of improvement after treatment has concluded, evidence that is lacking for the drug therapies.", 
    "23": "Rats with high and low exploratory activity in an elevated plus-maze model of anxiety were separated into subgroups termed 'non-anxious' and 'anxious' respectively according to the number of sectors the animals crossed and the total amount of time they spent in the open part of the plus-maze. The binding parameters of benzodiazepine and cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8) receptors in frontal cortex and hippocampus of selected animals were studied and compared to an animal group representing the total mean scores and to home-cage controls. It was established that anxious rats had a significantly lower number of benzodiazepine receptors in frontal cortex as compared to non-anxious animals and in hippocampus as compared to home-cage controls. There was also a decreased number of CCK-8 receptors in hippocampus of anxious rats as compared to the non-anxious and control groups. Non-anxious animals had a significantly lower number of CCK-8 receptors in frontal cortex than anxious and control rats. Acute treatment of rats with anxiogenic benzodiazepine inverse agonist FG 7142 (10 and 20 mg/kg) did not influence benzodiazepine binding in brain regions under investigation but caused upregulation of CCK-8 receptor binding in frontal cortex. On the other hand, CCK-8 analogues caerulein and pentagastrin, administered in doses which inhibit exploratory activity in plus-maze (100 or 500 ng/kg respectively), decreased the number of benzodiazepine binding sites in rat frontal cortex if injected intraperitoneally but did not affect CCK-8 binding. The present findings indicate that benzodiazepine and CCK-8 receptor binding characteristics in brain undergo rapid and behaviourally specific changes during stressful events.", 
    "24": "Pregnane steroids, particularly 3 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites of progesterone, are known to have rapid and profound effects on brain excitability. Recent evidence suggests that the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A))-benzodiazepine receptor-Cl- ionophore complex may mediate these actions. The data further suggest that these steroids modulate the complex through a novel site independent of other known sites on the complex. The hypothesis that this site is on the GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptor-Cl- ionophore complex is tested in the present study by determining its presence on transiently expressed GABAA-benzodiazepine receptors.", 
    "25": "The benzodiazepine drugs modulate gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic transmission via a high-affinity binding site that is part of the GABA(A) receptor complex, but which is distinct from the GABA binding site. Ro15-4513 is a benzodiazepine negative modulator of GABA action that displays unique anti-ethanol properties both in vivo and in vitro. Ro15-4513 has been reported to photoaffinity label nearly 100% of the benzodiazepine binding sites in rat brain homogenates. In contrast, the benzodiazepine positive modulator flunitrazepam photoaffinity labels only 25% of the sites. Here, we have examined the reversible binding of [3H]Ro15-4513, [3H]flumazenil (Ro15-1788), and [3H]flunitrazepam to embryonic chick brain membranes, and to membranes that have been photoaffinity labeled with nonradioactive flunitrazepam. Photoaffinity labeling with flunitrazepam decreased the subsequent reversible binding of [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]flumazenil, but increased the binding of [3H]Ro15-4513. The increase in [3H]Ro15-4513 binding after flunitrazepam photoaffinity labeling was due to a decrease in the apparent Kd, with no change in Bmax. Following photoaffinity labeling, negative modulation of [3H]Ro15-4513 binding by GABA was lost, whereas positive modulation of residual [3H]flunitrazepam binding was retained. We conclude that the site photoaffinity labeled by flunitrazepam is distinct from the site responsible for reversible binding of [3H]Ro15-4513.", 
    "26": "Effect of chronic administration of benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) (4 mg/kg once daily for 14 days) treatment and its withdrawal on locomotor activity, body temperature, and the binding pattern of receptor ligands that bind to GABA-BZ receptor ionophore complex in different regions of the brain of the rat was studied. Ro 15-1788 (x 14 d) increased the specific binding of [3H]ethyl-8-fluoro-5-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5 alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate [( 3H]Ro 15-1788), [3H]ethyl-8-azido-5-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H- imidazo[1,5 alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate [( 3H]Ro 15-4513), [3H]flunitrazepam, and [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate [( 35S]TBPS) in cerebral cortex, and this increase in binding remained upregulated during the drug withdrawal at 24 h. The binding of [3H]Ro 15-1788 was also found significantly increased in the hippocampus, but not in cerebellum and striatum. The chronic Ro 15-1788 treatment did not alter the specific binding of [3H]GABA. Rosenthal analysis of the saturation isotherms indicated that the observed upregulation in the binding pattern of [3H]Ro 15-1788 and [3H]Ro 15-4513 in the cerebral cortex was due to an increase in the binding capacity (Bmax). The receptor affinity (Kd) was not changed. The withdrawal of Ro 15-1788 following its chronic administration also enhanced locomotor activity. However, no apparent change in body temperature was observed either due to chronic treatment or withdrawal. These data indicate that chronic Ro 15-1788 treatment and its withdrawal may produce an upregulation of subunits which bind the positive (benzodiazepines), negative (inverse agonist), and neutral (antagonist) ligands of benzodiazepine receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "27": "The effect of a single or repeated swim stress on in vivo benzodiazepine receptor binding to various brain regions in adrenalectomized and sham-operated (control) mice was assessed using the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, [3H]Ro15-1788. In sham-operated mice the binding of [3H]Ro15-1788 to benzodiazepine receptors was reduced in the hippocampus and hypothalamus (single or repeated stress) and cerebral cortex (repeated swim stress) compared to non-stressed mice. In contrast, no alterations in [3H]Ro15-1788 binding were observed in any brain region in adrenalectomized mice after either single or repeated swim stress. These data suggest that an intact hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is required for the stress-induced decrease in benzodiazepine receptor occupancy measured using the in vivo binding method.", 
    "28": "Peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptors (PBR), unlike central-type benzodiazepine receptors, are found in low concentrations in normal brain. Because PBR have been described in neoplastic cells of neuroglial origin, they have been suggested for imaging human glial tumors and for directing cytotoxic therapy at these tumors. Little information exists, however, on the presence or pharmacology of PBR in human glial tumors. Using radioligand binding techniques, we have demonstrated that 6 out of 6 glioblastoma (GBM) specimens had high concentrations of PBR [( 3H]PK 11195 binding sites) which were significantly greater than in 5 normal human frontal cortex samples. The pharmacologic specificity of these sites differed significantly from that of PBR in human and rat kidney specimens. Saturation binding experiments revealed a small number of high affinity sites and a substantial number of sites of intermediate affinity. Under in vitro binding conditions the more numerous lower affinity site is the major contributor to specific binding measurements. The ligand recognition site of the PBR in human GBM tissue was photoaffinity labeled using [3H]PK 14105, a nitrophenyl analogue of PK 11195. Subsequent SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed specific incorporation of label into a 17,300 molecular weight component. There was no specific incorporation into normal human frontal cortex, but a component of very similar molecular weight was demonstrated in human kidney. We conclude that human glioblastomas consistently express PBR sites that are present in greater density than in normal human brain. Imaging of human glial tumors with analogues of PK 11195 thus appears feasible. Further molecular characterization of the photoaffinity-labeled PBR may also provide new information on the biology of these tumors.", 
    "29": "The results of a systematic examination of the UV/VIS spectra of 10 drug substances with chromophores and auxochromes in bicyclic and tricyclic systems (benzodiazepine, dibenzoazepine and dibenzodiazepine) are described.

    "30": "The purpose of the presented work was to investigate the relationship between the length of I-III and I-V intervals during BERA examinations on the intensity of the stimulus in healthy subjects. Furthermore to assess the normal range of the maximum length of I-III and I-V intervals. Twenty-seven subjects aged 15-57 years, incl. 10 men, were examined. The stimuli were 100 us clicks, the repeating rate was 30/s, the stimulation intensity 0-85 dB nHL. The examination was made after administration of diazepam or rohypnol. TDH 49 earphones were used. Into the external auditory meatus on the examined side an electrode of the authors' own design in the shape of an open tube was introduced. The length of I-III and I-V intervals depended on the intensity of stimulation. The differences of mean values of the length intervals at stimulation intensities of 65 dB nHL and 45 dB nHL were statistically significant: p less than 0.02 for interval I-III and p less than 0.0001 for interval I-V. We take as the upper borderline of the normal length of intervals I-III approximately 2.8 ms and of intervals I-V 4.7 ms, if the latency of wave I is smaller than 2.5 ms. When the latency of wave I is greater, even longer I-III and I-V intervals may be still normal.", 
    "31": "Plasma noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A) and corticosterone (CS) concentrations were determined in rats before, during and after 15-min exposure to a constantly electrified (2 mA) or nonelectrified prod which was mounted on the wall of the home cage either with or without bedding material on the floor. Concomitantly, exploration of the prod, freezing and prod-burying behavior were recorded. Both in the presence and absence of bedding material, rats explored the nonelectrified prod and showed a small increase in plasma NA and CS contents. Exploration of the prod was strongly reduced when the prod was electrified. In the presence of bedding material, shocked rats typically displayed burying behavior (active avoidance), whereas in the absence of bedding (i.e., burying option eliminated) shocked rats engaged in freezing behavior (passive avoidance). The passive avoidance situation was accompanied by larger A and CS increases but a lower NA rise as compared to the hormonal responses associated with the active avoidance situation. Administration of the anxiolytic chlordiazepoxide (CDP; 9 mg/kg intragastrically) attenuated the shock-induced suppression of prod exploration, decreased prod-burying behavior but, paradoxically, increased freezing behavior. Irrespective of bedding condition, the prod shock-induced elevations in plasma CS and A contents were completely abolished in CDP-treated rats. The rise in plasma NA was attenuated only in CDP-treated rats tested on a bedding-floor. The results indicate that passive (e.g., freezing) and active (e.g., burying) behavioral coping are each accompanied by specific and dissociated patterns of neurosympathetic, adrenomedullary and adrenocortical outflow. CDP-treatment shifts an animal's behavioral coping style from an active to a passive form of avoidance responding, but abolishes the accompanying adrenocortical and adrenomedullary activation.", 
    "32": "Ketotifen was compared to diazepam to inhibit aversive responding of the mouse in a black and white test box and in the rat social interaction test. Both drugs reduced aversive responding in the mouse to the brightly illuminated area of the test box and facilitated social interaction in the rat; ketotifen was approximately 100 times more potent than diazepam. The chronic administration of diazepam, ethanol, nicotine and cocaine in the mouse also reduced aversive responding but their withdrawal was associated with an increased behavioural suppression. The administration of ketotifen during the period of withdrawal from diazepam, ethanol, nicotine and cocaine prevented the exacerbation in aversive responding. It is concluded that ketotifen, like diazepam and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, can reduce behavioural suppression in rodent models of anxiety and attenuate the behavioural consequences of withdrawal from treatment with drugs of abuse.", 
    "33": "The sedative-hypnotic effect of Caulis Polygoni multiflori decoction (CPMD) was studied by the rolling cylinder method in mice and by the somnopolygraphic recording method in rats. The result from the rolling method in mice showed that CPMD (9g/kg) did have synergic action with the subthreshold hypnotic dose of sodium pentobarbital (20mg/kg). The result from the somnopolygraphic recording experiment showed that the immediate hypnotic effect of an effective dose of CPMD (20g/kg) was basically similar to that of diazepam (5mg/kg) used under the same experimental condition, chiefly an increase in the duration of slow wave sleep phase (SWS) and a decrease in the duration of paradoxical sleep phase (PS). By the end of a three-day session in dose of twice a day the hypnotic effect appeared more prominent and the reduction of SWS latency became significant.", 
    "34": "The aim of the study was to determine whether a single oral dose of omeprazole 40 mg is effective in increasing the pH of gastric residue above 2.5 at the time of anaesthetic induction in adult patients scheduled for elective gynaecological surgery. The patients were allocated to receive either chlorazepate dipotassium 25 mg alone or omeprazole 40 mg and chlorazepate dipotassium 25 mg on the night before surgery. Gastric volume and pH were measured after induction of anaesthesia. Patients who received omeprazole had a higher mean pH than control patients (p less than 0.001). The pH was less than 3.5 in 50% of patients in the control group, but in only 4.5% of those who received omeprazole (p less than 0.01). Mean (SEM) volume of gastric fluid was 15.2 (2.7) ml in the control group and 9.2 (1.8) ml in the omeprazole group, but the results were not statistically significant. A single dose of 40 mg omeprazole significantly decreased the number of patients at risk of aspiration pneumonitis.", 
    "35": "Steady state metabolite/parent drug plasma ratios were measured in 15 epileptic patients on carbamazepine (CBZ) monotherapy and in seven patients treated with CBZ and clobazam (CLB). CBZ plasma concentrations did not differ between the two groups but patients also treated with CLB exhibited higher concentrations of CBZ-10,11-epoxide (CBZ-E) and trans-10,11-dihydro-10,11-dihydroxy-CBZ (CBZ-T). Ratios between all of the metabolites of CBZ and the parent compound were higher in patients on polytherapy but the ratio between metabolites was not different. CLB comedication causes a moderate increase (about 1.5-fold) in CBZ metabolism, probably by inducing its epoxidation.", 
    "36": "We studied patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery following premedication with lorazepam, morphine and droperidol, using pulse oximetry and serial electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings. Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) values were compared with those obtained during two control periods when the patients were awake and asleep. All patients demonstrated progressive arterial oxygen desaturation during the premedication period, statistically significant from both controls (P less than 0.001). Twelve of the 15 patients developed hypoxaemia or severe hypoxaemia which was corrected immediately by administration of oxygen. New ECG changes developed during the premedication period in 33% of patients. It is concluded that additional oxygen should be administered to patients receiving this and similar premedication regimens.", 
    "37": "Anxiety is a prominent feature of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related psychiatric disorders. Psychiatric disorders are associated with poor drug abuse treatment outcome in both healthy and HIV-infected drug users. While it is important to treat anxiety, the use of traditional antianxiety agents such as benzodiazepines can lead to adverse effects such as sedation and misuse, especially in patients with drug abuse problems. A retrospective chart review was employed to examine the use of buspirone in treating anxiety in intravenous drug users with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex who were receiving methadone maintenance treatment. All patients were opiate users, and most were also secondary users of other substances, including stimulants and alcohol. Of 17 patients who were started on buspirone, 14 remained on medication for more than 2 weeks. Of this latter group, all showed at least temporary improvement in one or more of the following areas: subjective reduction of anxiety, reduction of prescribed benzodiazepine use, or reduction in the number of urine tests positive for drugs of abuse, particularly morphine. Buspirone was well tolerated by all but three of these patients; there was no evidence of buspirone misuse. Given its favorable adverse effects profile, buspirone may be particularly useful in the treatment of anxiety in HIV-infected drug users.", 
    "38": "Midazolam 5 mg (1 mg/ml) was accidentally injected intra-arterially into an intubated patient who was being transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to an operating room. No adverse effects were observed. To our knowledge, this is the first published case of intra-arterial administration of midazolam; whether this is generally harmless remains, therefore, an open question. Midazolam was injected through a 3-way stopcock in a manometer connecting tube. Three-way stopcocks in arterial lines are dangerous because of the risk of accidental intra-arterial injections. A careful preoperative check including the intravascular catheters is necessary in every patient, especially those being transferred from the ICU to an operating room.", 
    "39": "Five patients meeting the DSM-III-R criteria for social phobia, without any other psychiatric diagnosis, were treated with clonazepam, a high potency benzodiazepine. All patients improved markedly within four weeks. By the end of the eighth week of treatment, a marked improvement of their symptoms was reported. The adverse effects were minimal at an average dose of 3 mg per day. The authors suggest that clonazepam is a safe and effective medication in the treatment of social phobia. Moreover, clonazepam is easier to use as compared to other drugs which are used (atenolol, phenelzine, alprazolam).", 
    "40": "Combined actions of two substances with similar effects are frequently expressed by pairs of doses that produce a fixed response, usually 50%, in so-called isobolograms (ED50 isobolograms). In addition to the dose scales in such graphs we propose the addition of effect scales, where possible, to indicate the effect at certain doses, e.g., the ED30. We further propose to construct isoboles for expected independent interaction, in addition to the additivity line, for which purpose a simple procedure is delineated. In practice, an independent isobole for 50% effect passes through the point formed by the ED30s of A and of B in ED50 isobolograms. Thus, the ED30s constitute the \"zenith\" of an independent isobole in ED50 isobolograms. It is shown that theoretical independent isoboles can either represent additive, overadditive, or underadditive interactions, depending on the steepness of the dose-response curves of the components. Hence, drugs with shallow dose-response curves exhibit overadditive independent effects, compounds with exponentially steep curves show additive independent interactions. Substances with very steep dose-response curves, producing lethal effects, exhibited marked underadditive effects which could be ascribed largely to an independent mechanism of action of the components. Hence, the inclusion of independent isoboles into conventional isobolograms provides new insights into the mechanisms of interactions and into the actions of the components. Interactions can thus be characterized better and more completely, and misinterpretations appear less likely than with conventional isoboles.", 
    "41": "We examined 949 consecutive toxicology requests to determine (a) the identity and relative frequency of the most commonly detected drugs in our hospital population; (b) degree of concordance between clinical impression and laboratory analysis; (c) influence of age and sex upon the numbers and results of toxicologic analyses; (d) temporal pattern of our annual toxicology case-load; (e) temporal and sexual distribution of various common drugs; (f) drugs most often found together; and (g) frequency with which inappropriate toxicology request were received. Laboratory analysis agreed with clinical impression in only 17.4% of cases. Age and sex correlated with the detection of specific drugs. But for benzodiazepines, no consistent temporal pattern was present regarding either type or number of drugs detected. Certain days of the week demonstrated a statistically significant effect upon the number of toxicology requests received, while seasons, holidays, and lunar phases had no influence. Inappropriate requests comprised 9% of the total annual toxicology caseload.", 
    "42": "To examine the effects of diazepam on the carotid sinus baroreflex control of circulation, bilateral carotid occlusion was performed on 14 conscious rabbits with aortic denervation. The responses of mean arterial pressure, heart rate, cardiac output and total peripheral resistance were obtained. The haemodynamic responses to carotid occlusion were evaluated at cumulative doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg kg-1 of diazepam. The administration of diazepam decreased cardiac output and increased total peripheral resistance significantly, but did not affect the arterial pressure and heart rate. The response of total peripheral resistance to carotid occlusion was significantly increased from 0.118 +/- 0.018 (mean +/- SE) to 0.154 +/- 0.026 mmHg min ml-1 at 1.0 mg kg-1 of diazepam. The heart rate response was attenuated significantly from 41 +/- 5 to 24 +/- 4 beats min-1 at 1.0 mg kg-1 of diazepam. Diazepam did not alter the response of arterial pressure to carotid occlusion. We suggest that the dissociated effects of diazepam on the reflex control of circulation reflect the dissociated influences of diazepam on the central sympathetic and vagal-mediated pathways.", 
    "43": "Unbound fractions of 14C-labeled diazepam and tenoxicam in skimmed milk of various species (man, horse, goat, cow, sheep, dog, rabbit) with different milk compositions were determined. Furthermore, the protein binding of five 14C-labeled benzodiazepines differing in their lipophilicity (bromazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, flumazenil, and flunitrazepam) were measured in human milk and in artificially prepared solutions of individual milk proteins (lactoferrin, 2.4 g/liter; alpha-lactalbumin, 2.1 g/liter; albumin, 0.4 g/liter; and casein--2.1, 3.4, and 13.3 g/liter). The extent of binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis of protein solution against 1/15 M phosphate buffer, made isocryoscopic with lactose. The results showed that the casein fraction is a major binding component in milk for all tested drugs. The extent of binding of diazepam and tenoxicam in the milk of various species was independent of the whey protein concentration. In human milk the fraction of bromazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, and flunitrazepam bound to casein was higher than that bound to any other of the milk proteins tested. Albumin contributed little to the overall binding of these benzodiazepines, and lactoferrin and alpha-lactalbumin did not account for significant binding. The benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil showed the lowest overall binding in milk and in casein solution. As the casein concentration is highest in colostral milk and drops during the course of lactation, it is expected that M/P ratios of drugs strongly bound to casein are higher during the first days postpartum than in later phases of lactation.", 
    "44": "This study compares the time course of triazolam effects on psychomotor and cognitive skills with triazolam plasma concentrations in a combined pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (sigmoid-Emax) model. Ten male subjects received a single oral dose (1 mg) of triazolam or placebo. The CNS impairment effects were measured by using computerized tracking, body sway, and digit symbol substitution tests, and triazolam plasma concentration was measured by gas chromatography. The drug-induced effect changes lagged behind the plasma drug level changes. The magnitude of the time lag was quantified by the half-time of equilibration between concentrations in the hypothetical effect compartment and the plasma triazolam levels (t 1/2 keo). Essentially the same t 1/2 keo (approximately 6 min) was found for subcritical tracking, body sway, and digit symbol substitution tests. When using the predicted drug concentrations at the effect site, the hysteresis of the plasma concentration-effect disappears, suggesting that the hysteresis is not caused by drug induced tolerance. Moreover, the model allows for estimation of the effect site concentration that causes one-half of the maximal predicted effect (EC50, approximately 5 ng/ml) which is a measure of an individual's sensitivity to triazolam. On the basis of the EC50 values of the effect measures, body sway was slightly less sensitive to triazolam than subcritical tracking and digit symbol substitution tests.", 
    "45": "The disposition of oral oxazepam was investigated in seven patients with decompensated cirrhosis and encephalopathy and in nine healthy individuals to further examine the hypothesis of preservation of glucuronidation in liver disease. The patients showed a severe reduction in the quantitative liver function as assessed by estimation of the clearance of antipyrine; the median value was 9 ml.min-1 and the range was 6 to 12 ml.min-1. Apparent clearance of oxazepam in cirrhotic patients was 0.55 ml.min-1.kg-1, with a range of 0.46 to 1.24 ml.min-1.kg-1, compared with 1.19 ml.min-1.kg-1 and a range of 0.80 to 1.66 ml.min-1.kg-1 in the controls (p less than 0.05). The unbound clearance of oxazepam in patients was 4.1 ml.min-1.kg-1, with a range of 3.4 to 5.5 ml.min-1.kg-1, compared with 25.4 ml.min-1.kg-1, and a range of 16.7 to 43.7 ml.min-1.kg-1, p less than 0.001, in the controls. In patients with liver disease, the unbound clearance of oxazepam correlated significantly with antipyrine clearance (r = 0.88; p less than 0.05). The results suggest a reduced capacity for glucuronidation in patients with decompensated liver disease and severe hepatic failure that corresponds to the general reduction in the quantitative liver function.", 
    "46": "The protective effects of atropine, diacetylmonoxime (DAM), and diazepam separately and in combination were investigated in rats exposed to malathion. Malathion (500 mg/kg, ip) inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AchE) activity in RBC and brain and produced hyperglycemia and hyperlactacidemia with depletion of glycogen in liver, triceps, and brain of animals 2 hr after its administration. Atropine (20 mg/kg, ip) given immediately after malathion abolished hyperglycemia and glycogenolytic effect but exhibited no effect on the recovery of inhibited AchE activity. DAM (100 mg/kg ip) given immediately after malathion significantly reactivated the inhibited AchE activity both in RBC and brain. It also partially modified hyperglycemia and glycogenolytic effect. Diazepam (50 mg/kg, ip) slightly modified AchE and abolished hyperglycemia, hyperlactacidemia, and glycogenolytic effects. A combination of these drugs protected the animals from the acute toxic effects of malathion.", 
    "47": "Prejunctional and postjunctional muscarinic receptor subtypes were characterized in canine trachealis muscle strips. In vitro contractile responses of muscle strips to acetylcholine or electric field stimulation were determined in the absence and the presence of gallamine, pirenzepine, and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP). Gallamine had no effect on the contractile response to acetylcholine but enhanced the contractile response to electric field stimulation. Pirenzepine and 4-DAMP reduced the contractile response to acetylcholine and electric field stimulation. The pA2 value for pirenzepine vs. acetylcholine [7.18 +/- 0.59 (SD)] was consistent with the affinity of pirenzepine for M2 or M3-receptors; whereas the pA2 value for 4-DAMP vs. acetylcholine (8.92 +/- 0.42) and the extremely low affinity of gallamine indicated postjunctional muscarinic receptors of the M3 subtype. The enhancement of the contractile response to electric field stimulation by gallamine suggested the presence of M2-prejunctional receptors.", 
    "48": "Studies in rodents have shown that triazolam, a commonly used hypnotic, may shift circadian rhythms, with the direction and magnitude of the phase-shifts being dependent on the time of drug administration. To determine whether benzodiazepine, taken at standard bedtime, modifies the amount and/or temporal organization of hormonal secretion, six normal men were studied during basal conditions and on the first and third days of treatment with 0.5 mg triazolam. In each study, sleep was polygraphically monitored and plasma cortisol, growth hormone (GH), melatonin, and prolactin (PRL) (i.e., hormones influenced by circadian rhythmicity and/or sleep) were measured at 20-min intervals for 24 h. The sleep latency and the number and duration of awakenings were reduced during triazolam treatment as compared to baseline conditions. The only alteration of sleep architecture was a partial suppression of stages III + IV (SW) in late sleep. Triazolam did not affect the mean cortisol and melatonin levels or the total amount of GH secreted over the 24-h span. The circadian timings of the onsets of cortisol and melatonin secretions were essentially unaltered. The nocturnal rise of melatonin was prolonged by 45 to 60 minutes. Sleep-associated GH release was not modified by triazolam. Sleep-associated PRL secretion persisted, but in half of the nights studied was enhanced almost threefold. This effect of the drug on nocturnal PRL secretion was not specific to either the first or the third night of treatment, nor was it specific to certain subjects. Irrespective of the magnitude of the nocturnal elevation, morning PRL levels were slightly but consistently higher after triazolam treatment than under basal conditions. Normal PRL levels resumed around noon. In conclusion, administration of 0.5 mg triazolam at normal bedtime (2230) for three consecutive days may induce a transient hyperprolactinemia, but does not abolish sleep-related hormone secretion and does not affect the timing of endocrine events controlled by the circadian clock. These findings are consistent with studies in hamsters where treatment with triazolam in the early subjective night was also without effect on the rodent circadian clock.", 
    "49": "This study was undertaken to determine whether a single night's use of triazolam by normal healthy sleepers leads to withdrawal insomnia on the subsequent night, and whether there is a dose response relationship to this phenomenon. Thirty normal sleepers of both sexes were randomly assigned to three parallel treatment groups. All subjects were studied for five consecutive nights by means of pre- and post-sleep questionnaires and all night polysomnography. Multiple sleep latency tests were conducted on the days following the second, third, and fourth nights in the laboratory. All subjects received placebo capsules on the first, second, fourth, and fifth nights in the laboratory and either placebo, 0.25 mg triazolam or 0.5 mg triazolam according to their assigned group on the third night. Both doses of the drug increased subjective estimates of sleep duration, but no objective increase was found. Neither dose altered daytime measures of sleepiness. No changes were found in any of the sleep parameters on withdrawal of the 0.25 mg dose of triazolam. However, discontinuation of the 0.5 mg dose did lead to significant objective and subjective withdrawal effects. It was concluded that higher doses of triazolam could lead to withdrawal effects in normal sleepers even when this drug was used for only a single night.", 
    "50": "Muscarinic receptor subtypes have been localized in human and guinea pig lung sections by an autoradiographic technique, using [3H](-)quinuclidinyl benzilate [( 3H]QNB) and selective muscarinic antagonists. [3H]QNB was incubated with tissue sections for 90 min at 25 degrees C, and nonspecific binding was determined by incubating adjacent serial sections in the presence of 1 microM atropine. Binding to lung sections had the characterization expected for muscarinic receptors. Autoradiography revealed that muscarinic receptors were widely distributed in human lung, with dense labeling over submucosal glands and airway ganglia, and moderate labeling over nerves in intrapulmonary bronchi and of airway smooth muscle of large and small airways. In addition, alveolar walls were uniformly labeled. In guinea pig lung, labeling of airway smooth muscle was similar, but in contrast to human airways, epithelium was labeled but alveolar walls were not. The muscarinic receptors of human airway smooth muscle from large to small airways were entirely of the M3-subtype, whereas in guinea pig airway smooth muscle, the majority were the M3-subtype with a very small population of the M2-subtype present. In human bronchial submucosal glands, M1- and M3-subtypes appeared to coexist in the proportions of 36 and 64%, respectively. In human alveolar walls the muscarinic receptors were entirely of the M1-subtype, which is absent from the guinea pig lung. No M2-receptors were demonstrated in human lung. The localization of M1-receptors was confirmed by direct labeling with [3H]pirenzepine. With the exception of the alveolar walls in human lung, the localization of muscarinic receptor subtypes on structures in the lung is consistent with known functional studies.", 
    "51": "We studied the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and brain entry of lorazepam in the treatment of status epilepticus (SE) using a rat model of secondarily generalized convulsive SE. Lorazepam entered the bloodstream rapidly following intraperitoneal injection. Brain concentrations peaked 10 minutes after peak serum levels were achieved. Lorazepam remained in brain longer than in serum, leading to increasing brain: serum ratios over time once peak serum levels had been reached. Free lorazepam was 9.1% of the total concentration in serum, a fraction similar to that which has been reported for humans. The median effective dose for control of generalized tonic-clonic seizures in this model was 0.94 mg/kg, which would produce a serum concentration of 196 ng/ml. Rats in SE had higher serum lorazepam concentrations than controls given the same doses, but lower brain: serum ratios, perhaps due to lactic acidosis during SE. Our data confirmed clinical reports of lorazepam's effectiveness as a treatment for SE and suggest that a target serum concentration of 200 ng/ml should be effective in most cases and provide seizure protection for 24 hours following treatment.", 
    "52": "The effects of a high-fat diet and the CCK-receptor antagonist, L364,718, were examined on growth of human pancreas cell line SW-1990 xenografted to nude mice. Sixty animals were fed either low-fat (4.3%) or high-fat (20.25%) diet. Fifteen mice in each diet group were treated with L364,718 (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously twice daily for 23 days. On day 24 the animals were sacrificed. Tumor and animal pancreases were dissected and evaluated for weight, protein, and DNA content. When comparing within each diet group, L364,718 significantly decreased tumor volume, weight, protein, and DNA content compared to untreated mice (P less than 0.005). Tumor volume and protein content were significantly larger in untreated animals on the high-fat diet (P less than 0.05) compared to the low-fat diet. Mouse pancreatic weight, protein, and DNA content per kilogram of animal weight were all significantly lower (P less than 0.005) in mice on the low-fat diet treated with L364,718. Pancreatic DNA content was also decreased in both groups of animals on the high-fat diet compared to untreated mice on the low-fat diet. These findings suggest that diets high in unsaturated fat promote the growth of human pancreatic cancer. Since both tumor and pancreas growth are inhibited by the specific CCK-antagonist, L364,718, it is possible that endogenous CCK promotes the growth.",

The energy-refined models of both the sets of complexes show minimal distortions for the nucleotides, consistent with the results of 2D NMR studies on these complexes. The drugs have 3'-orientation in the minor groove, consistent with the previously reported investigations employing the united atom force field and with the experimental observations. Both anthramycin and neothramycin are calculated to bind preferentially to the puGpu sequences over pyGpy. This is in qualitative agreement with experimental studies for anthramycin, while for neothramycin A, this result is in apparent disagreement with experimental observations which have reported preferential binding of neothramycin A to poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) over poly(dG).poly(dC). While the present study brings out the usefulness of the simple molecular mechanics approach (using an all atom force field) in rationalizing substantial experimental observations, it also emphasizes the need for further investigations on solvent and dynamics effects in understanding the sequence specificity of drug-DNA binding.", 
    "54": "The separation of the enantiomers of 11-26 esters of oxazepam 1, temazepam 2, lorazepam 3 and lormetazepam 4 whith the acids benzoic 6, 2-methyl-3-nitrobenzoic 7, cynnamic 8 and hydrocynnamic 9 by HPLC on analytical columns with chiral stationary phases of (R)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)phenylglycine (R)-DNBPG and (S)-N-(3,5-dinitrobenzoyl)leucine (S)-DNBL was described. The diastereoisomeric mixtures of esters 27-30 of the overmentioned benzodiazepines with (S)(+)-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl)propionic acid have been also separated by HPLC on analytical column of SiO2. Some of the best separations have been repeated on semipreparative scale in order to isolate and characterize the optically pure enantiomers or diastereoisomers. Configurational assignment and elution order are established by a chiral recognition model. On the basis of the study by molecular models of the interaction between solute and chiral stationary phases, the conformers more interacting with these phases have been individuated and it has been possible to conclude that for any enantiomers couple the (S) isomer is always more retained by the chiral stationary phase of (R)-DNBPG and the (R) isomer by (S)-DNBL. Regarding to the interaction of diastereoisomeric esters 27-30 with SiO2, the esters more retained should result those of the benzodiazepines having (S) configuration.", 
    "55": "Effects of diazepam, pentobarbital, morphine, ethanol, caffeine, and nicotine on the conflict behavior established under a MULT FR 20/FR 20 punishment schedule of food reinforcement were investigated in Mongolian gerbils. Fourteen out of 17 gerbils learned lever-press response for food within 15 sessions of training under FR 20 schedule. Although high voltage of electric shock (125-225 V) was required for attaining lever-press suppression, all 14 gerbils exhibited stable conflict behavior, i.e., showing high response rate of 20-30 responses/min in the safety period and low response rate of 0-3 responses/min in the alarm period. Diazepam, a prototype of the antianxiety drugs, increased the response rate in the alarm period. The anticonflict effect was also observed after administration of either pentobarbital or ethanol. On the other hand, morphine suppressed lever-pressing in a nonspecific manner. Caffeine tended to attenuate the conflict behavior, but nicotine had no such effect. These results suggest that the effects of psychoactive drugs on the conflict behavior of gerbils are almost identical with those in mice and rats.", 
    "56": "The effect of diazepam on exploratory behavior was investigated in two inbred strains of rats, Fischer 344 (F344) and Lewis (LEW). The total numbers of head-dips and head-dipping duration in the rat hole-board test, and the total number of rearing and locomotor activity in the open-field test were measured after diazepam administration. The numbers of head-dips and rearings, and head-dipping duration and locomotor activity in naive F344 were significantly greater than those in naive LEW (P less than 0.001), suggesting that LEW is more emotional than F344. Diazepam, 0.31 and 0.63 mg/kg for F344 and 0.31-1.25 mg/kg for LEW, increased head-dips, head-dipping duration and rearings. However, there were no strain differences in enhancing effect of diazepam on locomotor activity. On the contrary, higher doses of diazepam, 0.94-2.50 mg/kg for F344 and 2.50 mg/kg for LEW, decreased head-dips, head-dipping duration, and rearings. However, the effect of diazepam on rotarod performance in LEW was similar to that in F344. These results suggest that F344 is more sensitive to sedative effect of diazepam than LEW, and that the sensitivity to diazepam may be strongly influenced by genetic factors.", 
    "57": "The action and side effects of the benzodiazepine antagonist Flumazenil were evaluated and compared with placebo in a double blind parallel group randomized trial involving 40 patients having upper gastrointestinal endoscopy under Midazolam premedication. Flumazenil reversed the hypnotic effect of midazolam within a few minutes. The patients were alert, cooperative, oriented and had recall of events after endoscopy. The effects were better than placebo concerning alertness for up to 30 minutes after administration whereas drowsiness remained almost stable after placebo. Time to reach full alertness was shorter after Flumazenil compared with placebo (42 vs 62 minutes). There were no significant side effects. Flumazenil allows effective reversal of midazolam premedication after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.", 
    "58": "An out-patient alcohol detoxification service based in a psychiatric emergency clinic is described. Of 173 patients referred during the first year, 76 (44%) were accepted for the programme; 60 (79%) of these successfully completed detoxification with no medical complications. Compared with previous years, during the year of operation of the service there was a 50% fall in the number of in-patient admissions for detoxification to the local hospital. We conclude that a structured out-patient detoxification programme is safe and effective, and may obviate the need for many patients to be admitted, freeing psychiatric beds for other uses.", 
    "59": "The new basic propanolamine derivative enciprazine (D 13 112) was tested in an open single-blind phase-II trial with regard to therapeutic efficacy, clinical safety, and dosage finding. The drug showed a good efficacy in mildly ill patients. Under the highest dosage frequently fatigue was reported. In 78% of the patients the enciprazine trial succeeded in shifting patients from benzodiazepines to non-benzodiazepines or in discontinuation of psychopharmacotherapy after completion of the trial.", 
    "60": "50 non-premedicated ASA class I or II patients were allocated randomly into two groups and received either a variable infusion of propofol or midazolam for sedation during orthopaedic surgery with regional blockade. To achieve a well-sedated patient with eyes closed and able to follow commands, the dose requirements for propofol were 1.25 mg/kg +/- 0.5 as a loading dose followed by a mean infusion rate of 3.17 mg kg-1 h-1 +/- 1.4 and for midazolam 0.073 mg/kg +/-0.02 and 0.074 mg kg-1 h-1 +/- 0.14. Steady-state plasma concentrations of propofol averaged 1.23 micrograms/kg +/- 0.75 and of midazolam 134 ng/ml +/- 62. Recovery was significantly shorter for propofol: 3.42 +/- 2.5 versus 8.05 min +/6.2 for midazolam. Perioperative cooperation was similar in both groups providing good or excellent conditions in 76% with propofol and in 52% with midazolam. 2h after discontinuation of the infusion 92% of the propofol patients were alert, while 36% of the midazolam were sleeping again. Cardiovascular effects of both drugs were minimal; however significant respiratory depression and/or airway obstruction developed in both groups (propofol 48%, midazolam 52%) requiring therapeutic intervention. Additional undesirable effects were: severe cough (propofol 40%, midazolam 20%), inadvertent movements (propofol 36%, midazolam 24%), confusion (propofol 24%, midazolam 20%), euphoria (propofol 44%), pain on injection (propofol 32%). The results of the study indicate that both drugs are useful and controllable sedative agents for surgery under regional anaesthesia, provided that measures for continuous monitoring of respiration and emergency care are guaranteed.", 
    "61": "One hundred and eighty-two women undergoing dilatation and curettage were allocated randomly to receive premedication comprising temazepam, papaveretum-hyoscine or placebo. The temazepam recipients reported significantly fewer episodes of postoperative nausea. Movement was blamed by 66% of patients who identified a cause for nausea. These patients had higher scores on a motion sickness susceptibility questionnaire and were more likely to have been treated previously for nausea or vomiting. It may be possible to identify susceptible patients before surgery.", 
    "62": "The quality of premedication induced by oral midazolam and zolpidem, a new imidazopyridine hypnotic, was assessed in a controlled, double-blind study in 93 patients undergoing elective surgery under spinal or extradural anaesthesia. The patients were allocated randomly to three groups. Each group received the same treatment twice at two different doses. The night before operation, patients received zolpidem 10 mg, midazolam 7.5 mg or placebo and, 1 h before operation, zolpidem 20 mg, midazolam 15 mg or placebo. The sleep inducing effects of the drugs were comparable. Zolpidem and midazolam were significantly more effective sedatives than placebo 45 min after administration, but no difference was noted between the drugs. There was a comparable incidence of anterograde amnesia with zolpidem and midazolam, but the onset was shorter after zolpidem. Side effects were comparable in the three groups. Zolpidem is an effective hypnotic with a rapid onset and short duration of action which may be an alternative to midazolam for premedication.", 
    "63": "This study investigated whether anxious adults desiring treatment for their anxiety would choose to take 10 mg of diazepam (Valium) or placebo after sampling both substances under double-blind conditions. Subjective effects of the drugs were also assessed, and the relationship between self-reported subjective effects and the number of times subjects chose diazepam or placebo was examined. Fourteen male and female volunteers meeting criteria for generalized anxiety disorder were recruited. They participated in a nine-session choice experiment in which they sampled diazepam 10 mg and a placebo on the first four sessions and chose whichever they preferred on the next five sessions. Only three subjects chose diazepam on all five choice occasions, no subjects chose diazepam on three or four occasions, and 11 subjects chose diazepam on two or fewer occasions. Overall, diazepam produced typical, tranquilizer-like subjective effects. However, subjective responses to diazepam differed in the 0-2-time choosers compared with the 5-time choosers: the 0-2-time choosers showed an increase on the measure of confusion, while the 5-time choosers showed decreases on measures of anxiety and confusion and increases on measures of stimulation.", 
    "64": "The effects of placebo, triazolam (0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 mg), and pentobarbital (100, 200, and 300 mg) were examined in seven normal male volunteers using a double-blind, Latin Square, balanced crossover design. Before and at hourly intervals after oral drug administration at approximately 10 a.m., subjects completed subject ratings of drug effects, psychomotor performance tasks, and two versions of a number recall task in which eight-digit number stimuli were recalled by reproduction on a numeric keypad. In one version, number stimuli were displayed on a video screen for varying lengths of time (3, 6, or 9 seconds) before immediate recall. In another version, subjects initially reproduced a continuously displayed number and then recalled the number following an immediate or a 16-second delay interval. Both triazolam and pentobarbital produced dose-related effects on all measures. Relative potency comparisons showed that triazolam was 270-384 times more potent than pentobarbital on subject ratings and psychomotor measures but was 406-647 times more potent than pentobarbital on measures of recall impairment. Recall performance deficits produced by both triazolam and pentobarbital at short (3-second) stimulus presentation times were attenuated at longer presentation times. With the variable delay task, triazolam but not pentobarbital interacted with the delay interval and produced impairments only at the 16-second delay condition. These data indicate that both triazolam and pentobarbital quantitatively impair acquisitional processes involved in short-term recall performance. Furthermore, triazolam may have a greater potential than pentobarbital to produce memory impairment, as reflected by its greater relative potency on these measures and its tendency to interfere with retention over short delay intervals.", 
    "65": "Immunological screening analysis of benzodiazepines in urine using the EMIT (enzyme multipled immuno-technique) and FPIA (fluorescence polarization immunoassay) techniques does not reliably detect the intake of therapeutic doses of oxazepam. In 23 patient urine samples, in which the presence of oxazepam could be verified chromatographically, only about 50% were detected as positive in the immunoassay systems. However, when the screening procedure was modified to include a simple step of hydrolysis of urine using the enzyme beta-glucuronidase to liberate conjugated oxazepam, improved detection of oxazepam intake was achieved. With EMIT 95% and with FPIA 100% of the samples were detected as positive. Since oxazepam arises in vivo also as a metabolite of other common benzodiazepines, the modification will most likely contribute to the generally improved detection of benzodiazepines.", 
    "66": "Oral contraceptive steroids are used by an estimated 60 to 70 million women world-wide. Over the past 20 years there have been both case reports and clinical studies on the topic of drug interactions with these agents. Some of the interactions are of definite therapeutic relevance, whereas others can be discounted as being of no clinical significance. Pharmacological interactions between oral contraceptive steroids and other compounds may be of 2 kinds: (a) drugs may impair the efficacy of oral contraceptive steroids, leading to breakthrough bleeding and pregnancy (in a few cases, the activity of the contraceptive is enhanced); (b) oral contraceptive steroids may interfere with the metabolism of other drugs. A number of anticonvulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) are enzyme-inducing agents and thereby increase the clearance of the oral contraceptive steroids. Valproic acid has no enzyme-inducing properties, and thus women on this anticonvulsant can rely on their low dose oral contraceptive steroids for contraceptive protection. Researchers are now beginning to unravel the molecular basis of this interaction, with evidence of specific forms of cytochrome P450 (P450IIC and IIIA gene families) being induced by phenobarbital. Rifampicin, the antituberculous drug, also induces a cytochrome P450 which is a product of the P450IIIA gene subfamily. This isozyme is one of the major forms involved in 2-hydroxylation of ethinylestradiol. Broad spectrum antibiotics have been implicated in causing pill failure; case reports document the interaction, and general practitioners are convinced that it is real. The problem remains that there is still no firm clinical pharmacokinetic evidence which indicates that blood concentrations of oral contraceptive steroids are altered by antibiotics. However, perhaps this should not be a surprise, given that the incidence of the interaction may be very low. It is suggested that an individual at risk will have a low bioavailability of ethinylestradiol, a large enterohepatic recirculation and gut flora particularly susceptible to the antibiotic being used. Two drugs, ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and paracetamol (acetaminophen), give rise to increased blood concentrations of ethinylestradiol due to competition for sulphation. The interactions could have some significance to women on oral contraceptive steroids who regularly take high doses of either drug. Although on theoretical grounds adsorbents (e.g. magnesium trisilicate, aLuminium hydroxide, activated charcoal and kaolin) could be expected to interfere with oral contraceptive efficacy, there is no firm evidence that this is the case. Similarly, there is no evidence that smoking alters the pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptive steroids. These agents are now well documented as being able to alter the pharmacokinetics of other concomitantly administered drugs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "67": "The pharmacokinetics and clinical significance of the major drug interactions seen with oral contraceptives are reviewed, both drugs interfering with pill efficacy, and situations where pills interfere with action of other drugs. Drugs affecting contraceptive efficacy include anticonvulsants, antibiotics, rifampicin, griseofulvin, ascorbic acid, and acetaminophen. Phenytoin is the most common anticonvulsant reported to cause contraceptive failure. It as been established by measurements of steady-state ethinyl estradiol levels, sex hormone binding globulin levels, and pharmacokinetic drug concentration curves that both ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels are decreased during phenytoin and carbamazepine intake. Induction of certain cytochrome P450 isozymes is probably responsible. Neither the causation or even the existence of drug interaction with antibiotics is definitely known, although case reports of pregnancies abound. Rifampicin is an exception, where enzyme induction clearly occurs. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen are atypical for increasing the therapeutic effect of ethinyl estradiol. The effect of benzodiazepines depends on the type of drug metabolism: drugs oxidized and nitroreduced, e.g. chlordiazepoxide, alprazolam, diazepam, and nitrazepam, exhibit reduced clearance during pill intake. Clearance of cyclosporin, prednisolone, alcohol, caffeine and theophylline are also slowed by orals. Pills accelerate clearance of salicylic acid and morphine.", 
    "68": "The authors report a random-assignment, double-blind crossover trial comparing alprazolam and placebo in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Ten patients fulfilling DSM-III criteria for PTSD completed 5 weeks of treatment on each agent. Improvement in anxiety symptoms was significantly greater during alprazolam treatment but modest in extent. Symptoms specific to PTSD were not significantly altered. The impact of nonspecific symptomatic effects on the outcome of drug trials in PTSD is considered.", 
    "69": "In this study we tested the potential taurine-antagonistic properties of three rigid analogs of taurine, 3-amino- (1), 3-hydrazino- (2) and 3-aminomethyl-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1-dioxide (3), which were prepared in our laboratory, using TAG (6-aminomethyl-3-methyl-1,2,4-benzothiadiazine-1,1- dioxide) (4), the only antagonist of taurine so far available, as reference compound in \"in vivo\" and \"in vitro\" experiments. Some physicochemical properties of (1), (2) and (3) were studied and the synthesis of TAG (4) was improved with a new preparative method. A dose-effect study performed by injecting intracerebroventricularly (1), (2) and (3) showed that these compounds have none of exciting effects exerted by the high doses of TAG (4). (1) and (3) as well as TAG (4), were found to antagonize the controlateral turning induced by the intracerebro injection of taurine and to potentiate the sedative effect of diazepam. We failed to find specific binding for taurine in different brain synaptic membrane preparations using 3H-taurine as radioligand and taurine, (1) and (3) as binding displacer. (1), (3) and TAG (4) however were found to antagonize the inhibitory effect of taurine on 3H-diazepam binding. These results seem to indicative that at least (1) and (3), which were more extensively studied than (2) because of their better solubility, are taurine antagonists with an apparent better selectivity than TAG (4).",

    "72": "In CBA mice immunized with the sheep red blood cells (5 x 10(8)), the section of the pituitary stalk prevented the changes in the immune response caused with drugs affecting the activity of GABA-ergic system. Activating effect of the benzodiazepine receptor agonist diazepam, and inhibitory effect of bicucullin on the immune response were not manifest in animals after the lesion of the hypothalamo-pituitary stalk. The mechanism of increasing of the L3T4 T-helpers in bone marrow under the effect of GABA-ergic system activity was also actualized through the hypophysis. The central GABA-ergic mechanisms of the neuroimmunomodulation are discussed.", 
    "73": "Our results demonstrate that phorbol esters and tetrodotoxin (TTX) partially inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in rat cerebral cortex cell aggregates; this inhibition was observed using several muscarinic agonists. While these effects were not accompanied by major changes in the total muscarinic receptor population, phorbol esters, but not TTX, reduced the relative concentration of the high affinity binding sites of the M1-selective ligands pirenzepine and telenzepine. In contrast, the binding of a muscarinic agonist to multiple receptor conformations was not influenced by either phorbol esters or TTX. Our data also show that the partial inhibition of the PI response by these agents is not due to a selective effect on the response mediated by a certain muscarinic receptor subtype or a receptor population which is more sensitive to agonist-induced desensitization. Evidence is provided that the effects of both phorbol esters and TTX might be mediated largely, although not entirely, by a common mechanism.", 
    "74": "The effects of the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor agonist chlordiazepoxide (CDP) and antagonist flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), given alone and in combination, on basal and novel environment stress (NES)-elevated plasma noradrenaline (NA), adrenaline (A) and corticosterone (CS) contents were investigated. When administered on their own, a medium dose of CDP (2.5 mg/kg) and a moderate dose of flumazenil (5 mg/kg) did not affect basal hormone levels. However, flumazenil potentiated the NES-induced CS elevation and suppressed the NA rise in response to NES. The 2.5 mg/kg dose of CDP attenuated the NES-elicited rise of CS and A, without changing the NES-enhanced NA concentrations. High doses of CDP (10 and 12.5 mg/kg), which elevated basal CS levels, prevented a further CS increase by NES and completely abolished the NA and A response to NES. The CDP effects on CS and NA were antagonized by pretreatment with flumazenil, in contrast to the CDP effect on A which was not blocked. The data indicate that brain (central-type) BDZ receptor systems are involved in regulating the neurosympathetic and adrenocortical, but not adrenomedullary, responses to mild stress.", 
    "75": "We have examined the activation of phosphoinositide metabolism by muscarinic agonists in rat cerebral cortex, in an attempt to delineate the mechanisms by means of which some selective antagonists inhibit this response in a manner that deviates from simple mass action law. The accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates induced by the full agonist carbamylcholine in cell aggregates preparations was inhibited by muscarinic antagonists with the following order of potency: telenzepine greater than atropine greater than 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methbromide greater than pirenzepine greater than hexahydro-sila-difenidol greater than AF-DX 116. The same order of potency was found for the competition of these antagonists with [3H]telenzepine binding to M1 muscarinic receptors. The inhibition of the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates activated by acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, and oxotremorine-M by pirenzepine and telenzepine showed biphasic curves, with 62-73% of the response being inhibited with high affinity. Atropine, AF-DX 116, and pirenzepine shifted the concentration-response curves of oxotremorine-M to the right in a parallel manner. However, pirenzepine at micromolar concentrations showed deviation from linearity of the Schild regression. The blockade by high concentrations of pirenzepine and telenzepine showed less than additive dose ratios when assayed in the presence of atropine, suggesting deviation of their antagonism from simple competition. However, after alkylation with propylbenzilylcholine mustard in the presence of low concentrations of pirenzepine, the response to carbamylcholine and oxotremorine-M showed monophasic inhibition curves by pirenzepine and linear Schild regression for this antagonist. These results support the interpretation that the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates is activated by multiple muscarinic receptor subtypes in rat cerebral cortex. The profile of affinities of muscarinic antagonists indicates that a major component of the response is activated by an M1 receptor subtype and a minor component is probably mediated by M3 muscarinic receptors when acetylcholine, carbamylcholine, or oxotremorine-M are used to stimulate the response. Conversely, pirenzepine inhibited the response induced by methacholine and bethanechol in a monophasic manner with high affinity (Ki = 13 nM), suggesting that these agonists can selectively stimulate phosphoinositide metabolism through activation of M1 muscarinic receptors in rat cerebral cortex.", 
    "76": "Male CD-1 mice (age 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 and 2 years) received single 2-mg/kg i.p. doses of clonazepam. Plasma and cortex clonazepam concentrations, rotarod ataxia and in vivo benzodiazepine receptor occupancy were measured at multiple times up to 14 hr after dosage. Elimination of clonazepam from plasma and cortex became slower with age, but cortex concentrations always exceeded those in plasma. The mean ratio was 1.82, and was not influenced by age. Rotarod ataxia was quantitatively greater and of longer duration in aging animals. This was not explained entirely by kinetic changes, as ataxia at any given cortex clonazepam concentration or degree of receptor occupancy was greater in 1-year-old animals than in those age 6 weeks or 6 months. In a second study, 6-week and 1-year-old animals were tested at a fixed time (1 hr) after variable doses of clonazepam (0.01-2.0 mg/kg); findings were consistent with results from the fixed-dose study. In vitro studies evaluated benzodiazepine receptor binding, chloride channel binding and muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake in cortical membrane preparations from animals of the four age groups. Binding affinity and number of binding sites were not influenced by age, or was gamma-aminobutyric acid-dependent muscimol-stimulated chloride uptake (either with or without addition of lorazepam) significantly related to age. Thus, increased overall sensitivity of aging animals to the central depressant effects of clonazepam is evident in the described model.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "77": "delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (delta 9-THC) induced in both rats and mice an increased aversion to the open arms of the elevated plus maze which was similar to that produced by anxiogenic agents. This effect of delta 9-THC was approximately three times greater in rats than in mice. When the behavioral effects of the cannabinoids were characterized further in the mouse, it was found that delta 9-11-THC, 12 beta-NH2-delta 8-THC, levonantradol and (-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH produced effects that were similar to those of delta 9-THC. The effect was found to be enantioselective in that (+)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH was inactive even at a dose 200 times greater than an active dose of (-)-11-OH-delta 8-THC-DMH. In contrast to the effects of delta 9-THC, mice treated with cannabidiol and nabilone spent a greater amount of time in the open arm of the maze, an effect similar to that produced by diazepam, the reference anxiolytic agent. In this test situation, 11-nor-delta 8-THC-9-carboxylic acid and abnormal cannabidiol did not alter the behavior of the animals at doses up to 20 and 100 mg/kg, respectively. Pretreatment with either the bidirectional inverse agonist carboline-3-carboxylate or diazepam (at doses that did not modify normal behavior on the elevated plus maze) blocked the effect of delta 9-THC.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "78": "In the rat mutant dystonic (dt), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) is elevated compared to normal littermates. The distribution of this increase within the DCN, and the effect upon GABA receptor density, was assessed in 25-d-old animals. GAD activity was increased 45, 41, and 74% in the medial, interpositus, and lateral divisions of the DCN, respectively. Autoradiographic analysis of GABAA receptor density, using the ligand 3H-muscimol (MUSC), revealed a significant decrease in MUSC binding in the DCN of the mutant. No changes in the binding of the benzodiazepine ligand 3H-flunitrazepam (FLU) were found in the DCN. At 18 other sites, including motor areas in the brain stem, midbrain, and forebrain, no significant changes were found in either MUSC or FLU binding. There also was a failure to find any significant changes in dt animals in the binding of ligands which label the muscarinic cholinergic receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, or serotonin 5-HT2 receptor. The results support earlier findings that GABAergic activity is increased in Purkinje cell terminals of the dt mutant and suggest that in response to this enhanced activity, GABA receptors in the DCN are down-regulated. At other levels of the neuraxis no consistent changes were found in any of the variables studied, suggesting that cerebellar dysfunction may be a primary component of the dystonic syndrome.", 
    "79": "The presence of a single anesthetized littermate significantly reduced the rate of ultrasonic vocalization by 10-day-old pups isolated in a novel environment. Naltrexone (1.0 mg/kg) returned the vocalization rate to the level of pups tested alone and disrupted the maintenance of body contact between the test pup and a companion. This suggests that the companion exerts comforting effects through endogenous opioid mechanisms. Although chlordiazepoxide is as effective as morphine in the quieting of isolation distress, the benzodiazepine (BDZ) antagonist Ro 15-1788 (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) was ineffective in blocking the comfort effect and facilitated quiet contact with the companion. In isolated pups, Ro 15-1788 caused a significant, but not a dose-related, decrease in vocalization, a possible indication of the displacement of an endogenous anxiogenic ligand at the BDZ receptor complex.", 
    "80": "The mechanism of phospholipase C regulation by inhibitory receptors was analyzed both in intact and in permeabilized rat thyroid cells (FRTL5). In this system, the muscarinic agonist carbachol inhibited phospholipase C, as indicated by the decrease in the basal levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate as well as by the reduced adrenergic stimulation of phosphoinositol accumulation, which was paralleled by a fall in the cytosolic Ca2+ levels. This inhibition involved an M2 muscarinic receptor because it was abolished by atropine but not by the M1 antagonist pirenzepine. Cells pretreated with pertussis toxin were not responsive to carbachol, indicating the involvement of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein in this inhibitory process. This possibility was further evaluated in permeabilized cells, where the carbachol inhibition was shown to be completely dependent on GTP. Known second messengers were not involved in this inhibitory process since Ca2+, cAMP, and activators of protein kinases were not able to mimic or prevent the carbachol effect either in intact or in permeabilized FRTL5 cells. In this system, the phospholipases C and A2 are coupled to two classes of muscarinic receptors that display a different sensitivity to pertussis toxin. The carbachol inhibitory effect occurred under conditions that prevented activation of phospholipase A2, excluding a role of the arachidonic acid metabolism in this process. Taken together these data provide the strongest support to date that an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein sensitive to pertussis toxin can directly mediate receptor-induced inhibition of phospholipase C.", 
    "81": "We evaluated the functional sensitivity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine supramolecular complex in 9 patients with panic disorder and 10 psychiatrically healthy control subjects by comparing the effects of four logarithmically increasing doses of intravenous diazepam on saccadic eye movement velocity, memory, and self-rated sedation. Patients with panic disorder were less sensitive than controls to diazepam using eye velocity as the dependent measure. Sedation and memory effects did not distinguish the two groups. These findings suggest that panic disorder is associated with functional subsensitivity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine supramolecular complex in brain-stem areas controlling saccadic eye movements.", 
    "82": "The flumazenil analogue, Ro 16-0154, a benzodiazepine partial inverse agonist, has been labeled by halogen exchange to enable SPECT investigations of central benzodiazepine receptors in the human brain. The purified 123I-Ro 16-0154 was found to be stable in rat brain preparations and to be metabolized in rat liver preparations. Its pharmacologic properties were comparable to those of flumazenil. The biodistribution in rats (1 hr postinjection) resulted in a high brain-to-blood ratio of 16. Clinical studies revealed images of the benzodiazepine receptor density in the brain. Since the receptor labeling was markedly reduced by injection of flumazenil, it was considered to be specific. Storage defects due to pathologic cerebral blood flow and changed receptor density were detected; this shows the potential usefulness of the substance for diagnostic purposes, e.g., the differential diagnosis of various forms of epilepsy.",

In addition to conventional benzodiazepine binding sites, Ro 15-4513 binds to a specific cerebellar protein, the binding of which has been shown to be insensitive to diazepam. The binding of [3H]Ro 15-4513 was studied in washed membranes of the cerebellum, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex of two rat lines developed for differences in their sensitivity to ethanol-induced motor impairment. Only minor differences were found in the estimated parameters (KD and Bmax) for the total specific binding between the rat lines. The main difference between the rat lines was, however, observed in the characteristics of the cerebellar binding, all of which was displaced by diazepam in most of the alcohol-sensitive [alcohol-nontolerant (ANT)] rats, in contrast to only approximately 75% displacement in most of the alcohol-insensitive [alcohol-tolerant (AT)] ones. The following cerebellar results were obtained with the major subgroups of both lines, i.e., with the AT rats chosen for the presence of the diazepam-insensitive binding and with the ANT rats chosen for its absence. The KD for the total specific [3H]Ro 15-4513 binding in the ANT animals was about half of that in the AT animals. No line difference was found in the Bmax of the binding in these rats. Photolabeling with [3H]Ro 15-4513 showed that the diazepam-insensitive binding was in a protein with a molecular weight of 55,000.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

    "86": "The hemodynamic effects of epidural anesthesia (EA) with the Trendelenburg position were studied in seven patients with severe mitral stenosis undergoing emergency cesarean section (CS) because of hemodynamic deterioration. In six patients, the CS was immediately followed by an open mitral commissurotomy under general anesthesia, whereas in one patient, the CS was performed alone. A significant reduction in heart rate (120 +/- 5 to 83 +/- 7 beats/min; P less than 0.001) was observed after induction of EA. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) decreased (78 +/- 9 to 55 +/- 5 mm Hg; P less than 0.01) simultaneously with reduction of the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) (37 +/- 4 to 15 +/- 4 mm Hg, P less than 0.001) and cardiac index (CI) (2.4 +/- 0.3 to 1.8 +/- 0.32 L/min/m2; P less than 0.001). However, PCWP could be adjusted by selecting the appropriate angle of the Trendelenburg position. When the PCWP was approximately 25 mm Hg, MAP and Cl increased to 72 +/- 7 mm Hg and 3.1 +/- 0.4 L/min/m2, respectively, and a satisfactory hemodynamic state was achieved. Systemic vascular resistance decreased after induction of EA (2,250 +/- 250 to 1,750 +/- 450 dyne.s.cm-5; P less than 0.001), and remained unchanged during the perioperative period. It is concluded that the combination of epidural anesthesia with tilting of the table is a safe method for urgent CS in pregnant women with critical mitral stenosis in whom termination of pregnancy is indicated because of hemodynamic deterioration.",

In 10 patients, anesthesia was induced using an exponentially declining continuous infusion of lorazepam equivalent to a total infused dose of 0.1 mg/kg over 15 minutes, which was supplemented at 10 minutes by fentanyl, 75 micrograms/kg, given as an infusion over 5 minutes. In 8 additional patients, anesthesia was induced with an exponentially declining infusion of fentanyl to a total dose of 75 micrograms/kg over 15 minutes, which was supplemented at 10 minutes by lorazepam, 0.1 mg/kg, given as an infusion over 5 minutes. Hemodynamics were recorded during a 20-minute observation period. One patient in each group required treatment for bradycardia during the initial drug infusion (before the second drug was added). Four additional patients in the group receiving lorazepam followed by fentanyl required treatment for bradycardia or hypotension within 10 minutes of the beginning of the fentanyl infusion. When an infusion of lorazepam was added to the fentanyl infusion, hemodynamics remained stable; however, the reverse order produced a high level of bradycardia and hypotension."
