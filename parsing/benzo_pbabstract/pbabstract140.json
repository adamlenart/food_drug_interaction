    "0": "Opioid-substitution treatment (OST) for opioid dependence (OD) has proven effective in retaining patients in treatment and reducing illegal opiate abuse and crime. Consequently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has listed the opioid agonists methadone and buprenorphine as essential drugs for OD that should be available worldwide. In many areas of the world, OD is often associated with concomitant benzodiazepine (BZD) dependence and abuse, which complicates treatment. However, possible changes in the cognitive functioning of these patients are not well-known. The present study is the first to examine longitudinal stability of memory function in OST patients with BZD use, thus providing a new tool for health policy authorities in evaluating the usefulness of OST.", 
    "1": "Within the first two months (T1) and between 6-9 months (T2) after OST admission, we followed the working memory, immediate verbal memory, and memory consolidation of 13 methadone- and 15 buprenorphine- or buprenorphine/naloxone-treated patients with BZD dependence or abuse disorder. The results were compared to those of fifteen normal comparison participants. All participants also completed a self-reported memory complaint questionnaire on both occasions.", 
    "2": "Both patient groups performed statistically significantly worse than normal comparison participants in working memory at time points T1 and T2. In immediate verbal memory, as measured by list learning at T1, patients scored lower than normal comparison participants. Both patient groups reported significantly more subjective memory problems than normal comparison participants. Patients with more memory complaints recalled fewer items at T2 from the verbal list they had learned at T1 than those patients with fewer memory complaints. The significance of the main analyses remained nearly the same when the statistical tests were performed without buprenorphine-only patients leaving 12 patients to buprenorphine/naloxone group.", 
    "3": "Working memory may be persistently affected in OST patients with BZD use. A high number of memory complaints among OST patients with BZD use may indicate memory consolidation impairment. These findings show that recovery of memory function in OD patients treated along with BZDs takes time, and their memory complaints may have practical relevance.", 
    "4": "Midazolam is a benzodiazepine with hypnotic action widely used as pre-anesthetic medication in pediatric anesthesia. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) also benefit from the use of midazolam, but its effects on this group of patients, who present several particularities, including changes at the site of action of midazolam, are still unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of midazolam, when used as pre-anesthetic medication, on the bispectral index (EEG-BIS) of patients with cerebral palsy.", 
    "5": "Two groups of patients were evaluated: one group with the diagnosis of CP and the other without central and peripheral nervous system disorders. The EEG-BIS was recorded in the room, the day before the surgery and at the day of the surgery, 40 minutes after the administration of 0.6 mg.kg(-1) of oral midazolam. Patients with a history of paradoxal reaction to midazolam as well as patients in the control group who were using other medications were excluded.", 
    "6": "Seventy-seven patients of both genders, 4 to 18 years old, participated in this study. Differences in EEG-BIS between both groups were not detected. After the use of midazolam EEG-BIS decreased in both groups with a statistically significant difference in each group. Statistically significant intergroup differences were not observed.", 
    "7": "Midazolam, used as pre-anesthetic medication, at a dose of 0.6 mg.kg(-1), reduced basal EEG-BIS without characterizing hypnosis and without statistically significant differences between the study groups.", 
    "8": "The utility of the diaminoquinazoline derivative CP-100,356 as an in vivo probe to selectively assess MDR1/BCRP-mediated drug efflux was examined in the rat. CP-100,356 was devoid of inhibition (IC(50) >50 microM) against major human P450 enzymes including P4503A4. In human MDR1-transfected MDCKII cells, CP-100,356 inhibited acetoxymethyl calcein (calcein-AM) uptake (IC(50) approximately 0.5 +/- 0.07 microM) and digoxin transport (IC(50) approximately 1.2 +/- 0.1 microM). Inhibition of prazosin transport (IC(50) approximately 1.5 +/- 0.3 microM) in human BCRP-transfected MDCKII cells by CP-100,356 confirmed the dual MDR1/BCRP inhibitory properties. CP-100,356 was a weak inhibitor of OATP1B1 (IC(50) approximately 66 +/- 1.1 microM) and was devoid of MRP2 inhibition (IC(50) >15 microM). In vivo inhibitory effects of CP-100,356 in rats were examined after coadministration with MDR1 substrate fexofenadine and dual MDR1/BCRP substrate prazosin. Coadministration with increasing doses of CP-100,356 resulted in dramatic increases in systemic exposure of fexofenadine (36- and 80-fold increase in C(max) and AUC at a CP-100,356 dose of 24 mg/kg). Significant differences in prazosin pharmacokinetics were also discernible in CP-100,356-pretreated rats as reflected from a 2.6-fold increase in AUC. Coadministration of CP-100,356 and P4503A substrate midazolam did not result in elevations in systemic exposure of midazolam in the rat. The in vivo methodology should have utility in drug discovery in selective and facile assessment of the role of MDR1 and BCRP efflux transporters in oral absorption of new drug candidates.", 
    "9": "In contrast to the 'benign and self-limiting nature' of childhood sleepwalking, some population and case studies have suggested that adult sleepwalking is more likely to be associated with psychopathology and psychotropic medications. There is a paucity, however, of systematic study in adult psychiatric populations, and the aim of the present study was therefore to compare the impact of psychopathology and medication usage on sleepwalking with reference to age of onset.", 
    "10": "Clinical characteristics, sleep symptoms, psychiatric diagnosis and psychotropic usage in 66 childhood- and adult-onset sleepwalkers as identified from a psychiatric clinic, were studied.", 
    "11": "There was a higher proportion of adult-onset sleepwalking in the psychiatric population. In comparison with childhood-onset sleepwalkers, adult-onset sleepwalkers had higher peak frequency of attacks and a high comorbidity with sleep-related eating features. Factors including frequent insomnia (odds ratio (OR) = 5.39, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.58-18.40, p = 0.007) and lifetime usage of regular zolpidem (OR = 5.58, 95%CI = 1.65-18.84, p < 0.006) were associated with a higher risk of adult-onset sleepwalking.", 
    "12": "Adult-onset sleepwalking in a psychiatric sample has unique clinical characteristics and specific risk factors. These patients were more likely to present with sleep-related eating features, comorbid insomnia, had and lifetime usage of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, especially zolpidem. A heightened awareness of the presence of sleepwalking and their associated risk factors among the adult psychiatric population is needed.",

    "16": "The patient showed progressive improvement in mental status and overall neurologic function after surgical treatment.", 
    "17": "The search for an etiology of a profound catatonic state should include the probability of a suprasellar/hypothalamic lesion, which in this case was owing to the rare finding of an imaging-documented adult-onset craniopharyngioma.", 
    "18": "The combined administration of anesthetics has been associated with pharmacokinetic interactions that induce concentration changes of up to 30%. Midazolam is often used as a preoperative sedative in advance of a propofol-based anesthetic. In this study, we identified the influence of midazolam on the pharmacokinetics of propofol.", 
    "19": "Eight healthy male volunteers were studied on two occasions in a random crossover manner. During Session A, volunteers received propofol 1 mg/kg in 1 min followed by an infusion of 2.5 mg x kg(-1) x h(-1) for 59 min. During Session B, in addition to this propofol infusion scheme, a target-controlled infusion of midazolam (constant C(t): 125 ng/mL) was given from 15 min before the start until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Arterial blood samples for blood propofol and plasma midazolam concentration analysis were taken until 6 h after termination of the propofol infusion. Nonlinear mixed-effects models examining the influence of midazolam and hemodynamic variables on propofol pharmacokinetics were constructed using Akaike criterion for model selection.", 
    "20": "In the presence of midazolam (C(blood): 224.8 +/- 41.6 ng/mL), the blood propofol concentration increased by 25.1% +/- 13.3% compared with when propofol was given as single drug. Midazolam (C(blood): 225 ng/mL) reduced propofol Cl(1) from 1.94 to 1.61 L/min, Cl(2) from 2.86 to 1.52 L/min, and Cl(3) from 0.95 to 0.73 L/min. Inclusion of mean arterial blood pressure further improved the propofol pharmacokinetic model.", 
    "21": "Midazolam reduces the metabolic and rapid and slow distribution clearances of propofol. In addition, a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure is associated with propofol pharmacokinetic alterations that increase the blood propofol concentration.", 
    "22": "For important reasons, lorazepam (Ativan) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium) are both popular treatments for alcohol-withdrawal syndrome. Nevertheless, there is little literature directly comparing the two drugs. A formal comparison is desirable because of pharmacokinetic and other differences that could affect safety and efficacy considerations relevant to practice in developing countries.", 
    "23": "One hundred consecutive consenting male inpatients in a state of moderately severe, uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal at screening were randomized to receive either lorazepam (8 mg/day) or chlordiazepoxide (80 mg/day) with dosing down-titrated to zero in a fixed-dose schedule across 8 treatment days. Double-blind assessments of withdrawal-symptom severity and impairing adverse events were obtained during treatment and for 4 days afterward.", 
    "24": "One chlordiazepoxide patient developed withdrawal delirium. Lorazepam and chlordiazepoxide showed similar efficacy in reducing symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as assessed using the revised Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol scale. During withdrawal, irritability and dizziness were more common with lorazepam, and palpitations were more common with chlordiazepoxide. No difficulties in drug discontinuation or differences in impairing adverse events were observed with either drug.", 
    "25": "With the treatment schedule used in this study, lorazepam is as effective as the more traditional drug chlordiazepoxide in attenuating uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal. Lorazepam, therefore, could be used with confidence when liver disease or the inability to determine liver function status renders chlordiazepoxide therapy problematic. The absence of clinically significant withdrawal complications with lorazepam in this large study contrasts with findings from previously published studies and suggests that higher doses of lorazepam than those formerly used may be necessary during alcohol withdrawal.", 
    "26": "Two versions of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits designed for the detection of benzodiazepine drugs and metabolites (Immunalysis) were evaluated for use with meconium specimens. One was an older kit, and one was a new replacement kit developed for better detection of several commonly prescribed benzodiazepines and metabolites. The kits were evaluated by analyzing 68 patient specimens previously analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and eight quality control samples. In addition to the recommended calibrator (oxazepam), clonazepam was evaluated as an alternate calibrator for the new kit. Detection and sensitivity for some analytes was improved using the new ELISA kit, but was reduced for others. The new kit using clonazepam as the calibrator provided the most sensitive assay for detection of the 11 benzodiazepines and metabolites reported here.", 
    "27": "The results of meconium specimens and fortified samples screened for drugs of abuse by both enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT((R) )II) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods were compared. The sample preparation for the ELISA screen was a simple buffer extraction versus a lengthy and more laborious sample preparation procedure for the EMIT II screen. The ELISA method was automated using a TECAN Genesis. The EMIT II analysis was automated with an Olympus AU400e. The opioid screen was calibrated with hydromorphone and the benzodiazepine screen was calibrated with clonazepam to maximize detection for these analytes. Previously validated gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), two-dimensional GC-MS, or liquid chromatography-tandem MS methods were used for confirmation. Results from the two techniques compared well. Agreement of the ELISA assay was greater than 90% when compared to EMIT II for all drug classes except barbiturates and benzodiazepines. ELISA appears to be more sensitive than EMIT II for the detection of amphetamines, methadone, propoxyphene, and cocaine. ELISA compared well to EMIT II for cannabinoids, opioids, and PCP. Specificity of the ELISA assay was slightly better for PCP and opioids. EMIT II appears to be more sensitive for the detection of barbiturates and benzodiazepines. The ELISA method reduced turnaround time by 50% compared to the EMIT II method.", 
    "28": "Limit of detection (LOD) values provide useful indicators for the suitability of an analytical method for samples with low analyte levels. An LOD value can also be used to estimate the false positive probability (p(x >or= LOD)) of a result for a sample with no analyte present, as well as the false negative probability (p(x <or= 0)) for a sample analyte level at the LOD. In straight line least-squares calibrations, the LOD of a calculated concentration (LOD(x)) results from uncertainties in low-level signal (y) measurements and in the calibration intercept (a(1)) and slope (a(2)) parameters. In generalized least-squares (GLS) calibrations, uncertainties in both the concentration (x(i)) and signal (y(i)) calibration data contribute to the fit parameter uncertainties. We define LOD(X) as 3 sigma(x = 0), where the calculated standard deviation, sigma(x = 0), includes all of these uncertainty contributions. Our GLS results can be understood in terms of small nonlinear distortions of the weighted ordinary least-squares (WOLS) problem. Because these distortions lead to skewed distributions of calculated x values, we also obtain exact GLS results for the asymmetric values. Differences between WOLS and GLS approaches are smallest when calibration uncertainties in x(i) are small, as in our alprazolam example. A second example, using synthetic data from earlier GLS work, shows greater differences between sigma(x = 0) and sigma(+/-)(x). Monte Carlo calculations for this example show that GLS-derived false positive and negative probabilities can differ by factors of two or more from normal distribution predictions, even when sigma(+)(x = 0) is used in place of sigma(x = 0) in the LOD definition. From a user standpoint, spreadsheet or other computational implementations of the GLS approach are as easy to use as those for a WOLS treatment, and GLS results will be the same as WOLS results when x uncertainties are ignored. Therefore, because GLS is a more complete and correct approach, it should be used as the standard method for weighted least-squares calibrations.", 
    "29": "Midazolam (MDZ) is a benzodiazepine used as a CYP3A4 probe in clinical and in vitro studies. A glucuronide metabolite of MDZ has been identified in vitro in human liver microsome (HLM) incubations. The primary aim of this study was to understand the in vivo relevance of this pathway.", 
    "30": "An authentic standard of N-glucuronide was generated from microsomal incubations and isolated using solid-phase extraction. The structure was confirmed using proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and (1)H-(13)C long range correlation experiments. The metabolite was quantified in vivo in human urine samples. Enzyme kinetic behaviour of the pathway was investigated in HLM and recombinant UGT (rUGT) enzymes. Additionally, preliminary experiments were performed with 1'-OH midazolam (1'-OH MDZ) and 4-OH-midazolam (4-OH MDZ) to investigate N-glucuronidation.", 
    "31": "NMR data confirmed conjugation of midazolam N-glucuronide (MDZG) standard to be on the alpha-nitrogen of the imidazole ring. In vivo, MDZG in the urine accounted for 1-2% of the administered dose. In vitro incubations confirmed UGT1A4 as the enzyme of interest. The pathway exhibited atypical kinetics and a substrate inhibitory cooperative binding model was applied to determine K(m) (46 microM, 64 microM), V(max) (445 pmol min(-1) mg(-1), 427 pmol min(-1) mg(-1)) and K(i) (58 microM, 79 microM) in HLM and rUGT1A4, respectively. From incubations with HLM and rUGT enzymes, N-glucuronidation of 1'-OH MDZ and 4-OH MDZ is also inferred.", 
    "32": "A more complete picture of MDZ metabolism and the enzymes involved has been elucidated. Direct N-glucuronidation of MDZ occurs in vivo. Pharmacokinetic modelling using Simcyp illustrates an increased role for UGT1A4 under CYP3A inhibited conditions.", 
    "33": "The ability of obidoxime with atropine and diazepam mixture to reactivate acetylcholinesterase inhibited by the organophosphorus compound chlorfenvinphos was compared in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues of rats. The animals were intoxicated with chlorfenvinphos (6 mg/kg, p.o.) and treated immediately, 24 and 48 hrs later with obidoxime (50 mg/kg, i.p.), atropine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), and diazepam (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in a single dose, or in various combinations (with 2-3 drugs) simultaneously. Total tissue acetylcholinesterase activities were monitored at 2, 72, and 168 hrs after intoxication. Enzyme activity was determined using Ellman's colorimetric method. The results of the present study show that obidoxime administered separately and jointly with atropine and diazepam 24 hrs after intoxication was effective on reactivation of chlorfenvinphos-inhibited acetylcholinesterase in the central nervous system and in the peripheral tissues. However, the application of obidoxime alone or in combination with atropine and diazepam 48 hrs after chlorfenvinphos intoxication caused an increased unfavourable effect in rats. The results obtained also indicate an unfavourable interaction of obidoxime with diazepam in the course of chlorfenvinphos poisoning, when antidotes were administered immediately, 24 and 48 hrs after intoxication.", 
    "34": "Cell damage and spatial localization deficits are often reported as long-term consequences of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of repeated drug administration after long-lasting status epilepticus. Groups of six to eight Wistar rats received microinjections of pilocarpine (2.4 mg/microl, 1 microl) in the right dorsal hippocampus to induce a status epilepticus, which was attenuated by thiopental injection (35 mg/kg, i.p.) 3 hrs after onset. Treatments consisted of i.p. administration of diazepam, ketamine, carbamazepine, or phenytoin at 4, 28, 52, and 76 hr after the onset of status epilepticus. Two days after the treatments, rats were tested in the Morris water maze and 1 week after the cognitive tests, their brains were submitted to histology to perform haematoxylin and eosin staining and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunofluorescence detection. Post-status epilepticus rats exhibited extensive gliosis and cell loss in the hippocampal CA1, CA3 (70% cell loss for both areas) and dentate gyrus (60%). Administration of all drugs reduced cell loss in the hippocampus, with best effects observed in brains slices of diazepam-treated animals, which showed less than 30% of loss in the three areas and decreased GFAP immunolabelling. Treatments improved spatial navigation during training trials and probe trial, with exception of ketamine. Interestingly, in the probe trial, only diazepam-treated animals showed preference for the goal quadrant. Our data point to significant neuroprotective effects of repeated administration of diazepam against status epilepticus-induced cell damage and cognitive disturbances.", 
    "35": "Diazepam (DZ) belongs to benzodiazepines, a group of drugs used for sedation, for the relief of anxiety, and in the treatment of epilepsy. It has been found that DZ influences cytotoxic activity and diminishes antiviral and antitumor reactions in human natural killer cells in vitro. It has also been demonstrated that DZ causes a significant increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes in vitro.", 
    "36": "In the present research the cytogenetic effects of DZ have been studied in normal human lymphocyte cultures of peripheral blood at 17.6-211.2 microM (final concentrations). Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), one of the most sensitive methods reflecting instability in DNA or a deficiency in DNA repair mechanisms, and proliferation rate index (PRI), a valuable indicator for cytostatic activity, have been evaluated.", 
    "37": "After 72-h incubation, DZ was found to cause a dose-dependent, statistically significant increase of SCE frequency (p < 0.001), followed by an equally significant decrease of PRI (p < 0.001).", 
    "38": "Our results suggest that DZ's administration presents cytogenetic effects in normal human lymphocyte cultures.", 
    "39": "Encephalopathy due to hepatic or renal failure, electrolyte disturbances, or the administration of benzodiazepines and narcotics is commonly encountered, well reviewed in the literature, and, therefore, not usually missed. This article focuses on encephalopathies that were previously well described but may be overlooked by modern clinicians, as well as those that are still taught in the classroom but seldom thought of in practice. Due to the presumed relative rarity of these cases and emphasis on the well-memorized \"classic\" clinical presentations, these often treatable, and perhaps not so rare, encephalopathies due to systemic medical illness may go undiagnosed and untreated. Pancreatic encephalopathy, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and pellagra encephalopathy are reviewed in detail; cefepime and ifosfamide encephalopathies are discussed as examples of specific medication-induced encephalopathies. Septic encephalopathy, central pontine myelinolysis, and fat embolism syndrome are briefly reviewed. The encephalopathies reviewed have the potential for devastating neurological consequences if recognition and, therefore, treatment are delayed. Clinical improvement for many of these syndromes depends on prompt intervention. This article highlights some representative examples of less-commonly diagnosed metabolic and toxic encephalopathies.",

    "41": "A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 80 female patients (mean age 32.6 years), undergoing middle ear surgery with general anesthesia at Ohud Hospital, Madina, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from May 2007 to May 2008. Patients were classified into 4 groups. They received intravenous normal saline (S group), midazolam 0.075 mg/kg (M group), or dexamethasone 10 mg (D group), or a combination of midazolam and dexamethasone (MD group), before the induction of anesthesia. Postoperatively for 24 hours observation and assessment of nausea, vomiting, rescue anti-emetics, and side effects of the study drugs such as headache and drowsiness were carried out.", 
    "42": "There was a significant difference between the 4 groups. The MD group was the least to develop PONV compared to other groups (p<0.01). Regarding nausea, there was a non-significant difference between the 4 groups, although the MD group developed the least symptoms among the 4 groups, there were no significant differences in pain intensity and side effects such as, headache, dizziness, and drowsiness between the 4 groups.", 
    "43": "The combination of midazolam 0.075 mg/kg and dexamethasone 10 mg intravenously is better than either drug alone in reducing the incidence of PONV in female patients after middle ear surgery.", 
    "44": "The emergence of dendritic arbor structure in vivo depends on synaptic inputs. We tested whether inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission regulates Xenopus optic tectal cell dendritic arbor development in vivo by expressing a peptide corresponding to an intracellular loop (ICL) of the gamma2 subunit of type A GABA receptors (GABA(A)R), which is required to anchor GABA(A) receptors to the postsynaptic scaffold. Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged ICL (EGFP-ICL) was distributed in a punctate pattern at putative inhibitory synapses, identified by vesicular GABA transporter immunoreactive puncta. ICL expression completely blocked GABA(A)R-mediated transmission in 36% of transfected neurons and significantly reduced GABA(A)R-mediated synaptic currents relative to AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic currents in the remaining transfected neurons without altering release probability or neuronal excitability. Further analysis of ICL-expressing neurons with residual GABA(A)R-mediated inputs showed that the capacity of benzodiazepine to enhance GABAergic synaptic responses was reduced in ICL-expressing neurons, indicating that they were likely depleted of gamma2 subunit-containing GABA(A)R. Neurons expressing a mutant form of ICL were comparable to controls. In vivo time-lapse images showed that ICL-expressing neurons have more sparsely branched dendritic arbors, which expand over larger neuropil areas than EGFP-expressing control neurons. Analysis of branch dynamics indicated that ICL expression affected arbor growth by reducing rates of branch addition. Furthermore, we found that decreasing GABAergic synaptic transmission with ICL expression blocked visual experience dependent dendritic arbor structural plasticity. Our findings establish an essential role for inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission in the regulation of dendritic structural plasticity in Xenopus in vivo.", 
    "45": "The second-generation antipsychotics are associated with metabolic abnormalities in patients with schizophrenia. Elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease are frequently treated with these antipsychotics, but limited data are available on their metabolic effects.", 
    "46": "The authors assessed 186 male and 235 female Alzheimer's disease outpatients from the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness-Alzheimer's Disease (CATIE-AD) for changes in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, and lipids in relation to duration of second-generation antipsychotic use (i.e., olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone) throughout the 36-week trial, using logistic regression and mixed-effects models.", 
    "47": "Women showed significant weight gain (0.14 lb/week of use) while change was nonsignificant in men. Clinically significant weight gain (i.e., > or = 7% of body weight) was seen among patients with antipsychotic use < or = 12 weeks (odds ratio [OR]=1.56, 95% CI=0.53 to 4.58), between 12 and 24 weeks (OR=2.89, 95% CI=0.97 to 8.64), and > 24 weeks (OR=3.38, 95% CI=1.24 to 9.23) relative to patients who did not use antipsychotics during the trial. Olanzapine and quetiapine treatments were significantly associated with weight gain (0.12 and 0.14 lb/week, respectively). In addition, olanzapine was significantly associated with decreases in HDL cholesterol (-0.19 mg/dl/week) and increased girth (0.07 inches/week) relative to the placebo group. No treatment effects were noted for changes in blood pressure, glucose, and triglycerides.", 
    "48": "Second-generation antipsychotic use was associated with weight gain in women, with olanzapine and quetiapine in particular, and with unfavorable change in HDL cholesterol and girth with olanzapine. The potential consequences of these effects suggest that patients with Alzheimer's disease treated with second-generation antipsychotics should be monitored closely.", 
    "49": "GABA(A) receptors, the major inhibitory receptors in the mammalian central nervous system, are affected by a number of drug compounds, including ethanol. The pharmacological effects of certain drugs have been shown to be dependent upon specific GABA(A) receptor subunits. Because benzodiazepines and ethanol have similar effect signatures, it has been hypothesized that these drugs share the gamma2-containing GABA(A) receptors as a mechanism of action. To probe the involvement of the gamma2 subunit in ethanol's actions, spatial memory for the Morris water maze task was tested in gamma2 heterozygous knockout mice and wild type littermate controls following ethanol administration at the following doses: 0.0, 1.25, 1.75, and 2.25 g/kg. While baseline learning and memory were unaffected by reduction of gamma2 containing GABA(A) receptors, ethanol dose-dependently impaired spatial memory equally in gamma2 heterozygous knockouts and wild type littermate controls.",

Most frequent symptoms were tachypnea, agitation, motor disturbance, diarrhea, fever, anxiety, sleep disturbance and hypertension (14.6-29.6%). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) was performed to detect the underlying empirical structure of co-occurrences of symptoms. An expert panel judged clinical relevance of each withdrawal symptom on a four-point scale ranging from 'definitively so' to 'definitively not'. Agitation, anxiety, inconsolable crying, increased muscle tension, tremors, tachycardia and sweating were considered relevant by 85-95% of the experts. On the basis of the MDS results and the experts' opinions, 15 symptoms were included in the final instrument.",

All patients received dipotassiumchlorazepate the evening before surgery. At predefined time points, effects of premedication on bispectral index, sedation score and visual analogue scales for anxiety and pain, cognitive function and stress hormones were determined.", 
    "59": "Administration of low-dose clonidine was associated with slightly lower bispectral index scores than a standard dose of midazolam or placebo. There were no significant differences in sedation score, visual analogue scale for anxiety and pain and cognitive function between treatment regimens. Clonidine, but not midazolam, reduced anaesthetic requirements for induction of anaesthesia and prevented an increase in heart rate as well as an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels during the preoperative period (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). Clonidine administration did not delay postoperative recovery.", 
    "60": "Clonidine augmented haemodynamic stability and partially blunted stress responses as determined by adrenocorticotropic hormone plasma levels. In addition, clonidine did not delay postoperative recovery. Therefore, surrogate parameters indicate that preanaesthetic medication with clonidine may be superior to midazolam in healthy individuals. Further studies have to confirm these results with regard to outcome parameters.",

In the present study, the pharmacological action of Triton-X 100 on GABA(A) receptors expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes was examined. Triton-X 100 inhibited GABA(A) alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2S) receptor currents in a noncompetitive, time- and voltage-dependent manner and increased the apparent rate and extent of desensitization at 10 muM, which is 30 fold below the critical micelle concentration. In addition, Triton X-100 induced picrotoxin-sensitive GABA(A) receptor currents and suppressed allosteric modulation by flunitrazepam at alpha(1)beta(3)gamma(2S) receptors. All effects were independent of the presence of a gamma(2S) subunit in the GABA(A) receptor complex. The present study suggests that Triton X-100 may stabilize open and desensitized states of the GABA(A) receptor through changes in lipid bilayer elasticity.", 
    "62": "Ebstein's anomaly is a rare congenital malformation of the tricuspid valve, often associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. We report the perioperative management of 3 patients (a 34-year-old man, a 5-month-old boy and a 5-year-old girl) with Ebstein's anomaly associated with WPW syndrome. Anesthetic managements for valvuloplasty of the tricuspid valve and ablation of accessory pathway in 3 patients were successfully accomplished with a combination of fentanyl, sevoflurane, and midazolam. The management of Ebstein's anomaly is based on its severity. The major concerns with anesthesia for children with Ebstein's anomaly include decreased cardiac output, right-to-left atrial level shunting with cyanosis, and the propensity for atrial tachyarrhythmias. We conclude that perioperative management of arrhythmia and evaluation of residual tricuspid regurgitation using transesophageal echocardiography are essential.", 
    "63": "Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) in pediatrics (0-14 years) is especially important because the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of drugs and drug pharmacokinetic profiles can be different from that of the adult population. In this context, several parameters like half-life of drug elimination from the body (t(1/2)), peak plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the curve, clearance (CL), Tmax, and dose/concentration relationship in children may differ from adults. Hence, the knowledge of pharmacokinetic parameters and therapeutic and toxic ranges of drug concentrations may help the clinicians to optimize drug treatment regimens in the pediatric population. TDM of psychotropic drugs requires particular attention for the pharmacological and clinical consequences of nonadequate dose use, lack in the compliance, and overdoses with possible toxic effects. Psychoactive drugs such as benzodiazepines, antiepileptic drugs, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotic drugs, psychostimulants (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs), opioid analgesics, and antimigraine drugs are a heterogeneous group. These drugs are subject to interindividual variability, and therefore, the usefulness of TDM for these drugs has to be assessed individually. Because of the occurrence of comorbid pathologies, including psychiatric disorders, the use of combined pharmacotherapy is not uncommon. As a consequence, these patients may be at risk from a number of potential drug-drug interactions. The implementation of TDM in pediatric population is more difficult than in adults because some sampling procedures are invasive and cause discomfort in children, and additionally, they require the cooperation of the patient. Several examples will be provided where the use of alternative matrices, such as saliva, is proposed to minimize inconvenience and patient discomfort.", 
    "64": "Time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (TOF-MS) has been developed for screening and determination of benzodiazepines with an exact mass database. Benzodiazepines display similar chemical structures and molecular weights, and thus show similar mass spectra and protonated molecule ions. Discrimination of mass spectrometry at low resolving power using single liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is commonly difficult. TOF-MS analysis was performed using a 1100 TOF (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a Zorbax C18 Extend column. Purine and fluorine compound solution was always introduced into the ion source, and real-time mass adjusting was performed. Specimens were prepared utilizing the liquid-liquid extraction procedure with 1-chlorobutane. Benzodiazepines are widely used in medical practice in Japan, and data acquired from TOF-MS measurements of 41 benzodiazepines, including active metabolites, were used to create an exact mass database. This database comprised molecular formulae, calculated exact masses and retention times. Calibrations were also included in a database. Precision for the 41 drugs was considered sufficient for quantitative analysis. In analysis of samples from patient who had taken > or =2 benzodiazepines, selectivity was improved using the TOF-MS exact mass database. TOF-MS is effective for forensic toxicology in discriminating between benzodiazepines with similar structure and metabolites.", 
    "65": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is characterized by vigorous movements associated with unpleasant dreams and increased electromyographic activity during REM sleep. Polysomnography with audiovisual recording is needed to confirm the diagnosis of RBD and to exclude other sleep disorders that can mimic its symptoms including obstructive sleep apnea, nocturnal hallucinations and confusional awakenings. RBD may be idiopathic or related to neurodegenerative diseases, particularly multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. RBD may be the first manifestation of these disorders, antedating the onset of parkinsonism, cerebellar syndrome, dysautonomia, and dementia by several years. RBD should thus be considered an integral part of the disease process. When effective, neuroprotective strategies should be considered in subjects with idiopathic RBD. Patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, though, such as spinocerebellar ataxias, may also present with RBD. When clinically required, clonazepam at bedtime is effective in decreasing the intensity of dream-enacting behaviors and unpleasant dreams in both the idiopathic and secondary forms. When part of a neurodegenerative disorder the development of RBD is thought to reflect the location and extent of the underlying lesions involving the REM sleep centers of the brain (e.g., locus subceruleus, amygdala, etc.), leading to a complex multiple neurotransmitter dysfunction that involves GABAergic, glutamatergic and monoaminergic systems. RBD is mediated neither by direct abnormal alpha-synuclein inclusions nor by striatonigral dopaminergic deficiency alone.", 
    "66": "Diazepam is a widely used benzodiazepine. Their prolonged usage leads to deterioration of cognitive functions and to the reduction of the level of vigilance what is explained by hypnotic effect but not by anxiolytic action of this drug. The novelty of our investigation is the elucidation of whether diazepam produces slow wave sleep reduction likely to the other benzodiazepines and if so what is the bases of positive therapeutic effect of diazepam in insomniac patients. For this aim we decided the study of diazepam effects on the ultradian structure of sleep-waking cycle. On cats (n=5) metallic electrodes were implanted under Nembutal anesthesia. EEG registration lasting 12 hr daily started after animals' recovery. Diazepam was administered intraperitoneally (0.37; 0.75; 1.5; 2 mg/kg). Statistical processing was made by Students' t-test. Diazepam prolonged sleep onset latency and waking overall time. Incidence and overall percentage of deep slow wave sleep decreased significantly but doze dependently. Paradoxical sleep latency was also significantly increased after diazepam action. All dozes of drug used by us significantly decrease the duration of each episode of paradoxical sleep. Diazepam significantly increase incidence of paradoxical sleep episodes with maximal duration till to 5 min. Under the influence of diazepam paradoxical sleep coursed without emotional coloring, without any patterns reflecting the level of emotional tension during this phase. The first episode of paradoxical sleep with partial restoration of patterns of emotional tension developed after 9+/-2 postinjectional hours at the 2 mg/kg doze of diazepam. All parameters reflecting the level of emotional tension during paradoxical sleep wholly recovered after 27+/-2 hour of diazepam administration. Diazepam administration worsens the quality of slow wave sleep. It is suggested that positive therapeutic effect of this drug may be related with the reduction of emotional tension during paradoxical sleep and modulation of behavioral and EEG patterns of this behavioral state.", 
    "67": "GABA signaling plays an important role in the spinal cord response to injury and subsequent motor training. Since benzodiazepines are commonly used to treat muscle spasticity in spinal cord injured subjects and the gamma2 subunit of the GABA(A) receptor is necessary for benzodiazepine binding, this subunit may be an important factor modulating sensorimotor function after an injury. Changes in gamma2 levels in muscle-specific motoneurons and surrounding astrocytes were determined approximately 3 months after a complete mid-thoracic spinal cord transection at P5 in non-trained and in step-trained spinal rats. Soleus (ankle extensor) and tibialis anterior (TA, ankle flexor) motor pools were identified using retrograde labeling via intramuscular injections of Fast Blue or Fluoro Gold, respectively. Lumbar spinal cord sections showed gamma2 immunostaining in both soleus and TA motoneurons and astrocytes. gamma2 immunoreactivity on the soma of soleus and TA motoneurons in spinal rats was differentially modulated. Compared to intact rats, spinal rats had higher levels of gamma2 in TA, and lower levels in soleus motoneurons. Step training restored GABA(A) gamma2 levels towards control values in motoneuronal pools of both muscles. In contrast, the gamma2 levels were elevated in surrounding astrocytes of both motor pools in spinal rats, and step training had no further effect. Thus, motor training had a specific effect on those neurons that were directly involved with the motor task. Since the gamma2 subunit is involved with GABA(A) receptor trafficking and synaptic clustering, it appears that this subunit could be an important component of the activity-dependent response of the spinal cord after a spinal injury.",

    "73": "The 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), formerly known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, has been reported to be closely associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP). TSPO is believed to exert pro-apoptotic functions via modulation of MPTP opening. Cobalt chloride (CoCl(2)), which is sometimes used as a hypoxia mimicking agent, is also known to be able to induce apoptosis. One of our questions was whether CoCl(2) may induce apoptosis via the TSPO. To address this question, we used the U118MG human glioblastoma cell line. We applied the specific TSPO ligand, PK 11195, as well as TSPO knockdown with siRNA and studied their influence on the effects of CoCl(2) on cell death, including activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. To assay TSPO expression, we applied binding assays and Western blotting to whole cell homogenates and mitochondrial fractions. To assay activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, including some of the cellular mechanisms involved, we determined the incidence of collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) and cardiolipin oxidation and measured the level of DNA fragmentation to assay apoptotic rates. We found that the TSPO ligand, PK 11195, significantly counteracted induction of cell death by 0.4 mM CoCl(2), including apoptosis, collapse of the Deltapsi(m), and cardiolipin oxidation. Moreover, we found that TSPO knockdown with siRNA fully protected against mentioned cell death mechanisms. Thus, we found that the TSPO is required for cell death induction by CoCl(2), including apoptosis. In conclusion, our studies show that activation of TSPO by CoCl(2) application is required for ROS generation, leading to cardiolipin oxidation, and collapse of the Deltapsi(m), as induced by CoCl(2).",

Changes in dopaminergic transmission also occur in response to particularly threatening challenges. However, studies on the effects of benzodiazepine (BZD) drugs in this test are still unclear. Given the interplay of dopamine and other neurotransmitters in the neurobiology of anxiety and schizophrenia the aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of systemic administration of midazolam, the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine, and the D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride using the CAR, a test that shows good sensitivity to typical neuroleptic drugs. Whereas midazolam did not alter the avoidance response, apomorphine increased and sulpiride reduced them in this test. Escape was not affected by any drug treatments. Heightened avoidance was not associated with the increased motor activity caused by apomorphine. In contrast with the benzodiazepine midazolam, activation of post-synaptic D2 receptors with apomorphine facilitates, whereas the D2 receptor antagonism with sulpiride inhibited the acquisition of the avoidance behavior. Together, these results bring additional evidence for a role of D2 mechanisms in the acquisition of the active avoidance.",

These cells express peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) and can be visualized by positron emission tomography (PET) using [(11)C]PK11195 that selectively binds to PBRs. Earlier research suggests that transient ischemia in rats induces increased [(11)C]PK11195 binding within the infarct core. In this study, we investigated the expression of PBRs during permanent ischemia in rats. Permanent cerebral ischemia was induced by injection of macrospheres into the middle cerebral artery. Multimodal imaging 7 days after ischemia comprised (1) magnetic resonance imaging that assessed the extent of infarcts; (2) [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([(18)F]FDG)-PET characterizing cerebral glucose transport and metabolism; and (3) [(11)C]PK11195-PET detecting neuroinflammation. Immunohistochemistry verified ischemic damage and neuroinflammatory processes. Contrasting with earlier data for transient ischemia, no [(11)C]PK11195 binding was found in the infarct core. Rather, permanent ischemia caused increased [(11)C]PK11195 binding in the normoperfused peri-infarct zone (mean standard uptake value (SUV): 1.93+/-0.49), colocalizing with a 60% increase in the [(18)F]FDG metabolic rate constant with accumulated activated microglia and macrophages.

Mean recovery parameters time, comprising time to spontaneous breathing, eye opening/hand squeezing on verbal command, extubation, and date of birth recollection, was significantly shorter (P = 0.0002) in the flumazenil group (6.9 +/- 2.6 min) compared with the control group (9.8 +/- 2.9 min).", 
    "108": "This study demonstrates that flumazenil given to healthy unpremedicated patients during propofol/remifentanil anesthesia significantly increased the BIS value and allowed earlier emergence from anesthesia. This may indicate that flumazenil could be used on a case-by-case basis to reverse endogenous or exogenous endozepines that might play a role during anesthesia.", 
    "109": "The depth of sedation was studied in children at intensive care units. Sixty-five children aged 4 to 14 years who had severe purulent abdominal processes and somatic diseases were examined. The depth of sedation was recorded by BIS monitoring and the Ramsey clinical sedation scale was used to make a clinical evaluation. Changes caused by relanium administration were observed in two groups. Midazolam was given in Group 3. There were differences when these agents were administered. The depth of sedation was found to depend on the given dose of an agent.", 
    "110": "Stiff person syndrome (SPS), stiff limb syndrome, jerking SPS and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM) are a family of rare, insidiously progressive diseases of the central nervous system. They all share the core clinical features of appendicular and axial rigidity caused by continuous involuntary motor unit activity, and superimposed stimulus-sensitive spasms. There is good evidence for a primary auto-immune aetiology. Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (anti-GAD) antibodies, specifically to the GAD65 isoform, are present in serum or cerebrospinal fluid of 60-80% of patients with SPS and its variants. A paraneoplastic form of SPS is recognized in about 5%, associated with a different profile of auto-antibodies. Repeated intravenous immunoglobulin is the mainstay of disease-modifying therapy in SPS. Rigidity and spasms may be treated symptomatically with benzodiazepines, baclofen, tiagabine and levetiracetam. After an initial progressive phase, patients with SPS generally stabilize over a period of months to years. However, 10% will require prolongedadmission to intensive care at some stage during the disease. Sudden death has been reported in asmany as 10% of patients because of unexplained metabolic acidosis or autonomic crises. The prognosis in paraneoplastic SPS, jerking SPS and PERM, in terms of mortality, is generally worse than in primary SPS.", 
    "111": "Rats segregated according to low (LA) or high (HA) anxiety levels have been used as an important tool in the study of fear and anxiety. Since the efficacy of an anxiolytic compound is a function of the animal's basal anxiety level, it is possible that chronic treatment with a benzodiazepine (Bzp) affects LA and HA animals differently. Based on these assumptions, this study aimed to provide some additional information on the influence of acute, chronic (18 days) and withdrawal effects (48 h) from diazepam (10 mg/kg), in rats with LA or HA levels, on startle response amplitude. For this purpose, the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test was used. In addition, the role of glutamate receptors of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (cIC), the most important mesencephalic tectum integrative structure of the auditory pathways and a brain region that is linked to the processing of auditory information of aversive nature, was also evaluated. Our results showed that, contrary to the results obtained in LA rats, long-term treatment with diazepam promoted anxiolytic and aversive effects in HA animals that were tested under chronic effects or withdrawal from this drug, respectively. In addition, since Bzp withdrawal may function as an unconditioned stressor, the negative affective states observed in HA rats could be a by-product of GABA-glutamate imbalance in brain systems that modulate unconditioned fear and anxiety behaviors, since the blockade of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptors in the cIC clearly reduced the aversion promoted by diazepam withdrawal.", 
    "112": "The electrochemical behaviour of several N-containing voltammetric active drugs such as 1,4-benzodiazepines (chlordiazepoxide, nitrazepam and diazepam) as well as one nitro-compound (nitrofurantoin) and one azo-compound (phenazopyridine) is described using a new kind of liquid electrode, the hanging galinstan drop electrode. Concentrations of 10(-5) - 10(-8) mol L(-1) are generally measurable. Differential pulse and adsorptive stripping voltammograms are recorded in different supporting electrolytes, like 0.1 M KNO3, acetate buffer solution pH = 4.6 and phosphate buffer solution pH = 7.0. The effects of varying the starting potentials, U(start) for DPV and accumulation times, t(acc) for AdSV are considered.

    "113": "Because of promising data from animal studies the clinical trials on anticonvulsants for the treatment of alcohol disorder have been accumulating in the last 40 years. A comprehensive research of various data bases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane) was performed. Here, we present the trials found together with an estimation of their evidence according to the guidelines of the \"Arzneimittelkommission der deutschen Arzteschaft\". We examined the clinical studies conducted for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, for relapse prevention/consumption reduction as well as for the treatment of co-morbide psychiatric disorders. The study analysis has not resulted in any safe alternative to benzodiazepines, clomethiazole or carbamazepine in the treatment of the stronger alcohol withdrawal syndrome. The material is also insufficient with regard to relapse prevention/consumption reduction or to the treatment of co-morbide psychiatric disorders. The safest proof of effect is currently topiramate (consumption reduction) and valproate (alcohol dependence with bipolar disorder). However, first positive results must be confirmed in well controlled studies with a much longer duration. Baclofen und several anticonvulsants such as valproate, oxcarbazepine and gabapentin demonstrate a potential to aid in the treatment of alcohol disorder. Currently, there exists any published controlled study for levetiracetam, which would be well suited in the treatment of alcoholism due to its favorable safety profile and low pharmacological interaction potential.", 
    "114": "The purpose of this study was to describe the use and concomitant use of psychotropics and other drugs as chemical restraints in the aged in long-term hospital care. The study consisted of 154 patients (42 men, 112 women) hospitalized in five long-term care wards in Pori City Hospital, Finland. Three or more psychotropics were regularly given to 33% of the patients and regularly or irregularly to 53% of the patients. Two or more benzodiazepine derivatives or related drugs were regularly given to 24% of the patients and regularly or irregularly to 46% of the patients. The very poor cognitive and functional abilities of the patients, the common concomitant use of psychotropic drugs, the use of psychotropics to control the behavior of the patients, and the lack of documentation of the effects and side effects of the drugs give rise to the conclusion that psychotropics were used as chemical restraints in these long-term care wards.", 
    "115": "Dystonia is an involuntary movement disorder dominated by sustained muscle contractions that frequently cause twisting, repetitive movements, and postural changes. The purpose of this study was to determine the mechanism causing dystonia. We therefore employed a rat model of dystonia, which was induced by injecting (-)-bicuculine methiodide (BM), a gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist, stereotaxically into the ventrolateral thalamic nuclei. Cerebral glucose metabolism reflecting cerebral activities and densities of central benzodiazepine and adenosine A(1) receptors that play an inhibitory role in neural excitation were evaluated in the brain by ex vivo autoradiography using appropriate (14)C/(18)F- or (11)C-labeled tracers. The dystonic signs were accompanied by increased glucose metabolism in the thalamus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and striatum. However, central benzodiazepine receptor density was not altered, and adenosine A(1) receptor density was reduced in the hippocampus. These results indicate the activation of a basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuit, which consists of the thalamus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and striatum. In this context, the activation of the above circuit has been reported in human dystonia patients. The decreased adenosine A(1) receptor density in the hippocampus might be related to a transient hippocampal dysfunction due to an acute type of dystonia. In conclusion, we have succeeded in generating a rat model of dystonia, and observed the activation of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuit that is related to dystonia.",

Information sources were an interview, an oral fluid specimen and the patient's clinical record. Dependent variables were presence of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, opiates or benzodiazepines. Independent variables were socioeconomic characteristics and circumstances of the injuries and admission. Prevalence and exact 95% confidence intervals were estimated for men and women.

    "121": "Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) is a convulsant used to model epileptic seizures in rats. In the PTZ-model, altered heat shock protein 27 (HSP-27) expression highlights seizure-affected astrocytes, which play an important role in glutamate and GABA metabolism. This raises the question whether impaired neurotransmitter metabolism leads to an imbalance in neurotransmitter receptor expression. Consequently, we investigated the effects of seizures on the densities of seven different neurotransmitter receptors in rats which were repeatedly treated with PTZ (40 mg/kg) over a period of 14 days. Quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography was used to measure the regional binding site densities of the glutamate alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, the adenosine receptor type 1 (A(1)), which is part of the system controlling glutamate release, and the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors GABA(A) and GABA(B) as well as the GABA(A)-associated benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites in each rat. Our results demonstrate altered receptor densities in brain regions of PTZ-treated animals, including the HSP-27 expressing foci (i.e. amygdala, piriform and entorhinal cortex, dentate gyrus). A general decrease of kainate receptor densities was observed together with an increase of NMDA binding sites in the hippocampus, the somatosensory, piriform and the entorhinal cortices. Furthermore, A(1) binding sites were decreased in the amygdala and hippocampal CA1 region (CA1), while BZ binding sites were increased in the dentate gyrus and CA1. Our data demonstrate the impact of PTZ induced seizures on the densities of kainate, NMDA, A(1) and BZ binding sites in epileptic brain. These changes are not restricted to regions showing glial impairment. Thus, an altered balance between different excitatory (NMDA) and modulatory receptors (A(1), BZ binding sites, kainate) shows a much wider regional distribution than that of glial HSP-27 expression, indicating that receptor changes are not following the glial stress responses, but may precede the HSP-27 expression.",

Forty alcohol dependent patients were randomly assigned to receive either 1998 mg of acamprosate daily, or matching placebo, during the DP (5-14 days). After completing detoxification, all patients received open label acamprosate (1998 mg daily) in the RP. Outcome measures during the DP included: treatment retention, alcohol withdrawal, alcohol consumption, and oxazepam used. Outcome measures during the RP included: treatment retention and alcohol consumption.",

    "126": "Anxiety and movement in children during transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can compromise study quality and reliability. Minimal sedation is often required. Intranasal midazolam (INM), used in various procedures, is an excellent sedative. Optimal INM dosing strategies for uncooperative children undergoing TTE are largely unknown, including second-dose INM strategies, introduced to maximize the potential for successful sedation and minimize risk. The purpose of this retrospective review was to evaluate the effectiveness of a second-dose INM minimal sedation strategy recently adopted at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.", 
    "127": "The strategy incorporates a second dose of INM if needed (10-15 minutes after the first dose) to obtain the desired level of anxiolysis. The effectiveness of this strategy was assessed in 100 consecutive patients (age range, 1-59 months).",

Firstly, an entity template library is built to retrieve pharmacokinetics relevant articles. Then a set of tagging and extraction rules are applied to retrieve PK data from the article abstracts. To estimate the PK parameter population-average mean and between-study variance, a linear mixed meta-analysis model and an E-M algorithm are developed to describe the probability distributions of PK parameters. Finally, a cross-validation procedure is developed to ascertain false-positive mining results. Using this approach to mine midazolam (MDZ) PK data, an 88% precision rate and 92% recall rate are achieved, with an F-score=90%. It greatly out-performs a conventional data mining approach (support vector machine), which has an F-score of 68.1%. Further investigate on 7 more drugs reveals comparable performances of our sequential mining approach.", 
    "131": "Zolpidem and diazepam are widely used drugs acting via benzodiazepine binding sites on GABA(A) receptors. While diazepam is non-selective, zolpidem has a high affinity for alpha1-, and no affinity for alpha5-containing receptors. Several studies suggested that behavioral effects of zolpidem might be more similar to classical benzodiazepines than previously thought. To compare the sedative and anticonvulsant properties of these drugs and to evaluate the importance of GABA(A) receptor subunits for development of tolerance during chronic treatment, we tested the effects of acute and repeated administration of zolpidem and diazepam on ambulatory locomotor activity (a measure of sedation) and on the threshold for myoclonic, clonic and tonic seizures in response to i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). Both drugs given acutely in doses 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg reduced locomotion, and in doses 1 and 3 mg/kg elevated the threshold for PTZ-induced seizures. The effects of zolpidem and diazepam on the tonic seizure threshold were greater than on myoclonus and clonic seizure threshold. Diazepam and zolpidem (3 mg/kg), given 18 or 42 h after repeated drug treatment (10 days, 5 mg/kg, twice daily), decreased the PTZ seizure threshold and increased the locomotor activity as compared to control mice, indicating development of tolerance to their anticonvulsant and sedative effects. After repeated treatment the PTZ seizure threshold was not different between the two drugs, while differences in sedation became larger than after the acute treatment. The results suggest that alpha5-containing GABA(A) receptors are not crucial for the development of sedative and anticonvulsant tolerance.",

For neuropathic surgery, the right superior caudal trunk was resected at the level between the S1 and S2 spinal nerves innervating the tail. Two weeks after the injury, the intrathecal (i.t.) catheter was implanted. Five days after the catheterization, the rats were injected with atropine (non-selective muscarinic antagonist, 30 microg), mecamylamine (non-selective nicotinic antagonist, 50 microg), pirenzepine (M(1) muscarinic antagonist, 10 microg), methoctramine (M(2) antagonist, 10 microg) or 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP) (M(3) antagonist, 10 microg). Ten minutes after the injection, EA was applied to the ST36 acupoint for 30 min. The cold and warm allodynia were assessed by the tail immersion test [i.e., immersing the tail in cold (4 degrees C) or warm (40 degrees C) water and measuring the latency of an abrupt tail movement] before and after the treatments. The i.t. atropine, but not mecamylamine, blocked the relieving effects of EA on cold and warm allodynia. Furthermore, i.t. pirenzepine attenuated the antiallodynic effects of EA, whereas methoctramine and 4-DAMP did not. These results suggest that spinal muscarinic receptors, especially M(1) subtype, mediate the EA-induced antiallodynia in neuropathic rats.",

The most frequent damage observed is rhabdomyolysis syndrome, which has been mainly described after cocaine or opium consumption. Authors present four cases from the autopsy documentation of the period between 2003 and 2008 at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, University of Szeged, Hungary in which illicit drug consumption or neuroleptic licit drug medication resulted in development of myocardium and striated muscle damage. The dominant clinical symptoms were hyperthermia, renal and circulatory failure. The laboratory tests showed renal and liver insufficiency; in addition the CK and CK-MB level increase suggested damage in striated muscles.

    "159": "One hundred and nine patients [44 male, 65 female; median 61.5 (21-80) years] were recruited. One hundred and three procedures were completed. Forty-five patients received midazolam [median 2 (1.5-5) mg]. Mean overall Numeric Rating Scale score was 4.7 (men 4.0; women 5.2; P<0.01) and median peak score 7. Discomfort was usually greatest at the beginning of the procedure, while in the sigmoid colon. Discomfort scores were higher in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (P = 0.03); diverticular disease (P<0.01); midazolam (P = 0.02), buscopan (P<0.001) or nitrous oxide (P<0.001) use; endoscope tracker use (P = 0.01); incomplete procedures (P<0.001) or a preceding gastroscopy (P = 0.02), but were not correlated with discomfort during venous cannulation or digital rectal examination. Multivariate analysis showed that female sex, high anxiety, anticipation of high discomfort, longer intubation time and higher endoscopist's grade of procedural difficulty were independent factors significantly related to overall discomfort scores. Recollected discomfort scores 2-3 months later were lower (P<0.01). Low-dose midazolam had no appreciable amnesic effect.",

Our objective was to identify if distinct patterns of behavior could be associated with three different self-perceived motivations for benzodiazepine use: (a) exclusive self-therapeutic motivation, (b) exclusive hedonic motivation, and (c) combined self-therapeutic and hedonic motivation. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire in 92 opiate users in treatment in France (Aquitaine). The behaviors associated with exclusive self-therapeutic motivation included the search for an anxiolytic effect, oral administration, use within the context of a medical prescription, and use without other substances. The behaviors associated with exclusive hedonic motivation were use in combination with other substances, the obtaining of benzodiazepines by the black market, and use of other routes of administration in search of a \"blackout.\" Among patients who reported both motivations, there were distinct trends of behavior according to motivation.",

The hydroxy group of oxazepam was either activated as a chloride (Method A) or as a phosphor-oxy derivative (Method B) giving the desired 3-amino-1,4-benzodiapines 6a-6r in high yields with primary and secondary amines in a typical nucleophilic substitution reaction. Eighteen 3-substituted 1,4-benzodiazepines were prepared and served as new chemical entities and for lead structure discovery. The mixed cholecystokinin (CCK) antagonist 6e showed anxiolytic and antidepressant effects from 10 microg/kg in mice in the elevated x-maze test and the forced swimming test. The CCK1 antagonist 6 g has shown antidepressant effects from the same dose, but lacked anxiolytic properties. Both compounds potentiated at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg morphine antinociception with a maximum possible effect (MPE) about 35%. By assessing initially the MPE of antinocipection for the 18 newly synthesised benzodiazepines in the tail-flick test, 4 other benzodiazepines were found active. In further in vive evaluation the cyclohexyl derivative 6 i displayed anxiolytic, antidepressant and antinociceptive properties as single agent at a dose of 5 mg/kg without toxicity. The benzodiazepines 6i and 6p, which initially showed a higher MPE in terms of morphine potentiation (43/44%) showed analgesic effects as single agents, without having anxiolytic or antidepressant properties. The amino-piperidinyl derivative 6p displayed a similar dose-response relationship to morphine, but was 3 times more potent.",

In the remifentanil group, a bolus dose of remifentanil was given, and a patient-controlled sedation analgesia (PCSA) pump was set to inject further bolus doses with no \"lockout\" time. Patients in the meperidine group received a bolus of meperidine and sham PCSA. Non-invasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiography, and pulse oximetry were monitored throughout the study. The Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (OAA/S) was performed at baseline, every 5 min during, and after colonoscopy. Assessment of pain and satisfaction with sedoanalgesia was scheduled after colonoscopy and 24-72 h later by a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS). The technical difficulty of the examination and the gastroenterologist's satisfaction were assessed similarly.",

The time to reach an Aldrete score > or = 9 was significantly shorter in the remifentanil group (P < 0.0001); discharge times did not differ between the groups (P = 0.36). There was no difference between the groups regarding the duration of colonoscopy (P = 0.82) and the stability of vital signs. At the end of the procedure, OAA/S was significantly higher in the remifentanil group (P = 0.03).",

    "168": "The assessment of drug effects on attention is important in non-clinical pharmacology, for both evaluation of safety and therapeutic efficacy of medicinal products. In the present study, we have developed a two-lever choice behavioral test to assess drug effects on attentional performance in monkeys. In each trial of this experiment, one of two lamps in front of a monkey was randomly illuminated for a brief period of time and the monkey was required to press a lever beneath the lamp 30 times to obtain a food reward. The percentage of correct responses, response latency of correct choice responses and response speed were measured. Using this test, we examined the effects of three sedative drugs, diazepam (0.25, 1 and 4 mg/kg, i.g.), ethanol (0.5, 1 and 2 g/kg, i.g.), and pentobarbital (0.25, 1 and 4 mg/kg, i.v.). Diazepam and pentobarbital lengthened response latency without significantly affecting the percentage of correct responses, response and response speed, suggesting selective disruptive effects on attentional performance. In contrast, ethanol at the high dose tested caused deterioration in all three measurements, which is thought to reflect a general sedative effect including motor impairment as reflected by lengthening response speed. It is suggested that the present behavioral test method could detect drug effects on attentional performance in monkeys and could be a useful tool for safety assessment in drug development.", 
    "169": "We investigated the metabolism of pranlukast, a selective leukotriene agonist, and the potential for drug-drug interactions. Although cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 appeared to be the major cytochrome P450 isoform involved in the metabolism of pranlukast, the results suggested that pranlukast metabolism was inhibited less than 50% by ketoconazole, a reversible CYP3A4 inhibitor, or by anti-CYP3A4 antibodies. Irreversible macrolide CYP3A4 inhibitors, clarithromycin, erythromycin and roxithromycin, exhibited little effect on pranlukast metabolism. On the other hand, pranlukast reversibly inhibited CYP2C8 and/or 2C9, and CYP3A4, with K(i) values of 3.9 and 4.1 micromol/l, respectively. The [I](in,max,u)/K(i) ratios were 0.004 and 0.003, respectively. The K(i) values were about 300-fold greater than the [I](in,max,u), therefore it is suggested that, at clinical doses, pranlukast will not affect the pharmacokinetics of concomitantly administered drugs that are primarily metabolized by CYP2C8 and/or 2C9 or CYP3A4.",

For each study, time to loss of response in patients who met criteria for response at Week 8 and the proportion of patients who lost response following Week 8 were compared by treatment group.

    "182": "The course of cardiovascular diseases is known to depend upon vegetative nervous system condition. The heart rate variability is the quantitative indicator of vegetative nervous system activity. The emotional stress reaction in rats tested in the \"open field\" was assessed by measuring the heart rate variability, which allowed the chronotropic cardiac function to be studied in detail and showed which part of the vegetative system (either sympathetic or parasympathetic) prevails in animals with different phenotypes of the emotional stress reaction. In rats demonstrating different behaviors in the \"open field\" test, changes in the heart rate variability were examined under conditions of the emotional stress response development and the treatment with non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic afobazole. It was established that the sympathetic nervous system tone prevails in stress-resistant rats, whereas in non-resistant animals, the parasympathetic system is predominating. In non-resistant rats exposed to stress, the heart rate variability decreased due to reduced power of very low frequencies, in contrast to stress-resistant animals, which showed increased power of very low frequencies. Afobazole was found to increase the heart rate variability in both animal groups. In non-resistant rats, afobazole also raised the vagus tone.",

    "184": "We induced seizures in postnatal day 10 rats with either kainic acid or flurothyl. We measured seizure activity using quantified behavioral rating and electrocorticography. We compared the efficacy of flupirtine, a selective KCNQ channel opener, with phenobarbital and diazepam, two drugs in current use for neonatal seizures.", 
    "185": "Unlike phenobarbital or diazepam, flupirtine prevented animals from experiencing development of status epilepticus when administered before kainate. In the flurothyl model, phenobarbital and diazepam increased latency to seizure onset, but flupirtine completely prevented seizures throughout the experiment. Flupirtine was also effective in arresting electrographic and behavioral seizures when administered after animals had developed continuous kainate-induced status epilepticus. Flupirtine caused dose-related sedation and suppressed electroencephalographic activity but did not result in respiratory suppression or result in any mortality.", 
    "186": "Flupirtine appears more effective than either of two commonly used antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbital and diazepam, in preventing and suppressing seizures in both the kainic acid and flurothyl models of symptomatic neonatal seizures. KCNQ channel openers merit further study as potential treatments for seizures in infants and children.", 
    "187": "We used hair testing to investigate the prevalence of unsuspected exposure to cocaine in a group of preschool children presenting to an urban pediatric emergency department without signs or symptoms suggestive of exposure. Hair samples were obtained from 90 children between 18 months and 5 years of age attending the emergency room of Hospital del Mar in Barcelona, Spain. In 85 cases, hair samples from the accompanying parent were also provided. The samples were analyzed for the presence of cocaine and benzoylecgonine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, which also determined opiates and amphetamines. Parental sociodemographics, possible drug history, and information on the child's features were recorded. Hair samples from 21 children (23.3%) were positive for cocaine (concentration range 0.3-5.96 ng/mg of hair) with 1 sample also positive for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and another for opiates. In 88% of the positive cases, cocaine was also found in the hair of the accompanying parent (15 of 17 matched parent-child hair samples). Parental sociodemographics were associated neither with children's exposure to cocaine nor with somatometry of children at birth. However, the behavioral patterns with potential harmful effects for the child's health (eg, tobacco smoking, cannabis, benzodiazepines and/or antidepressants use, and shorter breast-feeding time) were significantly higher in the parents of exposed children. A statistically higher percentage of exposed children were in the lower weight percentile group compared with the nonexposed children. In the light of these results, we advocate general hair screening to disclose exposure to cocaine and other drugs of abuse in children from risky environments, which could provide the basis for specific social and health interventions.", 
    "188": "Perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy, the cyclical occurrence of seizure exacerbations near the time of menstruation, affects a high proportion of women of reproductive age with drug-refractory epilepsy. Enhanced seizure susceptibility in perimenstrual catamenial epilepsy is believed to be due to the withdrawal of the progesterone-derived GABA(A) receptor modulating neurosteroid allopregnanolone as a result of the fall in progesterone at the time of menstruation. Studies in a rat pseudopregnancy model of catamenial epilepsy indicate that after neurosteroid withdrawal there is enhanced susceptibility to chemoconvulsant seizures. There is also a transitory increase in the frequency of spontaneous seizures in epileptic rats that had experienced pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. In the catamenial epilepsy model, there is a marked reduction in the antiseizure potency of anticonvulsant drugs, including benzodiazepines and valproate, but an increase in the anticonvulsant potency and protective index of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone and the neurosteroid analog ganaxolone. The enhanced seizure susceptibility and benzodiazepine-resistance subsequent to neurosteroid withdrawal may be related to reduced expression and altered kinetics of synaptic GABA(A) receptors and increased expression of GABA(A) receptor subunits (such as alpha4) that confer benzodiazepine insensitivity. The enhanced potency of neurosteroids may be due to a relative increase after neurosteroid withdrawal in the expression of neurosteroid-sensitive delta-subunit-containing perisynaptic or extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. Positive allosteric modulatory neurosteroids and synthetic analogs such as ganaxolone may be administered to prevent catamenial seizure exacerbations, in what we call neurosteroid replacement therapy.", 
    "189": "Acute isolated seizure, repetitive or recurrent seizures, and status epilepticus are all deemed medical emergencies. Mortality and worse neurologic outcome are directly associated with the duration of seizure activity. A number of recent reviews have described consensus statements regarding the pharmacologic treatment protocols for seizures when patients are in pre-hospital, institutional, and home-bound settings. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, diazepam, midazolam, and clonazepam are considered to be medications of first choice. The rapidity by which a medication can be delivered to the systemic circulation and then to the brain plays a significant role in reducing the time needed to treat seizures and reduce opportunity for damage to the CNS. Speed of delivery, particularly outside of the hospital, is enhanced when transmucosal routes of delivery are used in place of an intravenous injection. Intranasal transmucosal delivery of benzodiazepines is useful in reducing time to drug administration and cessation of seizures in the pre-hospital setting, when actively seizing patients arrive in the emergency room, and at home where caregivers treat their dependents. This review summarizes factors to consider when choosing a benzodiazepine for intranasal administration, including formulation and device considerations, pharmacology and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles. A review of the most relevant clinical studies in epilepsy patients will provide context for the relative success of this technique with a number of benzodiazepines and relatively less sophisticated nasal preparations. Neuropeptides delivered intranasally, crossing the blood-brain barrier via the olfactory system, may increase the availability of medications for treatment of epilepsy. Consequently, there remains a significant unmet medical need to serve the pharamcotherapeutic requirements of epilepsy patients through commercial development and marketing of intranasal antiepileptic products.", 
    "190": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder that results in multiple disabling symptoms. Research into the underlying neurobiology has implicated dysregulation in multiple neurotransmitter systems including norepinephrine, serotonin, and glutamate as well as the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Understanding how these biological systems interact with each other and how they may affect key neural structures, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex, to produce post-traumatic symptoms is critical for the development of effective pharmacological treatments. We briefly discuss the proposed biological dysfunctions underlying PTSD and how agents that target these dysfunctions may be utilized in PTSD. We then provide a review of the different pharmacological agents that have been investigated in PTSD. These drugs include: antidepressants, anti-adrenergic agents, anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics, and novel agents.", 
    "191": "Accidental or intentional Isoniazid poisoning may manifest within half to three hours as intractable seizure, acidosis, and coma. Single high dose of pyridoxine was used as an antidote with good response as reported earlier. Ingestion of more than 80 mg/kg body weight produces severe central nervous system symptoms and a dose of 125 mg/kg is potentially lethal if not promptly treated. We report a case of suicidal attempt with use of Isoniazid, who developed grand mal seizures and was controlled with diazepam and symptomatic treatment.", 
    "192": "Clonazepam, first used for seizure disorders, is now increasingly used to treat affective disorders. We summarize the use of clonazepam to improve the management of depression. Clonazepam is useful for treatment-resistant and/or protracted depression, as well as for acceleration of response to conventional antidepressants. Clonazepam is at this time recommended for use in combination with SSRIs (fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline) as an antidepressant, and should be used at a dosage of 2.5-6.0 mg/day. If clonazepam is effective, a response should be observed within 2-4 weeks. It is significantly more effective for unipolar than for bipolar depression. Low-dose, long-term treatment with clonazepam exhibits a prophylactic effect against recurrence of depression. Although the mechanism of action of clonazepam has not yet been established, some investigators have been suggested that it involves enhancement of anti-anxiety effects, anticonvulsant effects on subclinical epilepsy, increase in 5-HT/monoamine synthesis or decrease in 5-HT receptor sensitivity mediated through the GABA system, and regulate in GABA activity.", 
    "193": "Olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic drug known to induce clinically significant weight gain. Although the cause of such weight gain is not fully known, drug-induced changes in appetite and food intake are likely to play a significant role together with other possible mechanisms enhancing weight and/or adiposity. We assessed acute drug effects on 1 hour intake and behavioural expression in female rats. Low doses of olanzapine (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) enhanced acute mash intake. Marked drug effects were seen on a number of behaviours following olanzapine over a range of doses. These effects included dose-related reductions in activity and exploratory behaviours and associated substantial dose-related increases in resting behaviour. Behavioural data were also used to plot drug effects over time, including behavioural satiety sequence (BSS) profiles, to evaluate whether olanzapine's hyperphagic effects might be a consequence of altered satiety development. BSS profiles reflected enhanced eating behaviour at low doses (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) but showed dose-related increases in resting, indicative of drug-induced sedation, which meant that it was impossible to fully discern olanzapine's effects on satiety. Acute olanzapine induces both hyperphagia and sedation, both of which may promote weight gain and adiposity, but which interact competitively.", 
    "194": "Antipsychotic drugs selectively suppress conditioned avoidance response. Using a two-way active avoidance response paradigm, we examined the role of drug-induced interoceptive state in the mediation of avoidance-suppressive effect. In Experiment 1, we found that rats intermittently treated with olanzapine (OLZ) (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) or haloperidol (0.03 mg/kg, s.c.) on the 1st day of a 3-day cycle for seven cycles exhibited a progressive across-session decline in avoidance responding, despite the fact that they exhibited a comparable high level of avoidance responding on the 3rd day of each cycle during the drug-free retraining session. In Experiments 2 and 3, rats that were previously treated with OLZ (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) or risperidone (0.2-1.0 mg/kg) during the acquisition phase of avoidance conditioning exhibited significantly fewer avoidance responses when they were retested 3 weeks later to the same drug in comparison to rats that were previously treated with nonantipsychotic drugs (chlordiazepoxide, 10 mg/kg, citalopram 10 mg/kg, or sterile water). Overall, these findings indicate a 'drug memory'-like mechanism that maintains the avoidance-suppressing effect of antipsychotics over time. This mechanism is likely driven by the interoceptive state caused by the antipsychotics, which may also be an important behavioral mechanism mediating the clinical effects of antipsychotic treatments.",

    "203": "Binding by the drug imipramine to the protein human serum albumin (HSA) was studied by using high-performance affinity chromatography. The association equilibrium constants and number of binding sites for imipramine with HSA were first estimated by utilizing frontal analysis. Imipramine was found to have one major binding site on HSA with an association equilibrium constant of 1.6 x 10(5) M(-1) at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C, as well as a second group of weaker and non-specific binding regions (8-9 mol/mol HSA) with an average association equilibrium constant of 1.5 x 10(3) M(-1). Competition studies based on zonal elution were performed to identify the location of the major binding site for imipramine on HSA. Imipramine was found to have direct competition with L-tryptophan, which indicated that imipramine was interacting with Sudlow site II, or the indole-benzodiazepine site of HSA. No competition or allosteric effects were noted between imipramine and warfarin, a probe for Sudlow site I or the warfarin-azapropazone site of HSA. The association equilibrium constant found for imipramine at its site of competition with L-tryptophan also agreed with the value that was obtained for the major binding site of imipramine in the frontal analysis studies. These results confirmed that Sudlow site II was the location of the major binding site for imipramine on HSA. These results gave good agreement with previous observations made in the literature and should provide a more detailed description of how imipramine is transported in blood and of how it may interact with other drugs in the body."
