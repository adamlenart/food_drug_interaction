Individual subunits of GABA(A)/Benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor complex have been revealed to have different functional properties. alpha5 subunit was reported to be related to learning and memory. Changes of alpha5 subunit in schizophrenia were reported in postmortem studies, but the results were inconsistent. In this study, we examined GABA(A)/BZ receptor using [(11)C]Ro15-4513, which has relatively high affinity for alpha5 subunit, and its relation to clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. [(11)C]Ro15-4513 bindings of 11 patients with schizophrenia (6 drug-na\u00efve and 5 drug-free) were compared with those of 12 age-matched healthy control subjects using positron emission tomography. Symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding was quantified by binding potential (BP) obtained by the reference tissue model. [(11)C]Ro15-4513 binding in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was negatively correlated with negative symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, although there was no significant difference in BP between patients and controls. GABA(A)/BZ receptor including alpha5 subunit in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus might be involved in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.",

    "12": "P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multiple drug resistance associated proteins (MRPs), and cytochrome P450 3A4 together constitute a highly efficient barrier for many orally absorbed drugs. Multidrug regimens and corresponding drug-drug interactions are known to cause many adverse drug reactions and treatment failures. Available literature, clinical reports, and in vitro studies from our laboratory indicate that many drugs are substrates for both P-gp and CYP3A4. Our primary hypothesis is that transport and metabolism of protease inhibitors (PIs) and NNRTIs will be altered when administered in combination with azole antifungals, macrolide, fluroquinolone antibiotics, statins, cardiovascular agents, immune modulators, and recreational drugs [benzodiazepines, cocaine, lysergic acid dithylamide (LSD), marijuana, amphetamine (Meth), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and opiates] due to efflux, and/or metabolism at cellular targets. Therefore, such drug combinations could be a reason for the unexpected and unexplainable therapeutic outcomes. A number of clinical reports on drug interaction between PIs and other classes (macrolide antibiotics, azole antifungals, cholesterol lowering statins, cardiovascular medicines, and immunomodulators) are discussed in this article. MDCKII-MDR1 was employed as an in vitro model to evaluate the effects of antiretrovirals, azole antifungals, macrolide, and fluroquinolone antibiotics on efflux transporters. Ketoconazole (50 muM) enhanced the intracellular concentration of (3)H ritonavir. The inhibitory effects of ketoconazole and MK 571 on the efflux of (3)H ritonavir were comparable. An additive effect was observed with simultaneous incorporation of ketoconazole and MK 571. Results of (3)H ritonavir uptake studies were confirmed with transcellular transport studies. Several fluroquinolones were also evaluated on P-gp-mediated efflux of (3)H cyclosporin and 14C erythromycin. These in vitro studies indicate that grepafloxacin, levofloxacin, and sparfloxacin are potent inhibitors of P-gp-mediated efflux of 14C erythromycin and (3)H cyclosporin. Simultaneous administration of fluoroquinolones and macrolides could minimize the efflux and metabolism of both of the drugs. Effects of erythromycin and ketoconazole on carbamazepine metabolism were examined. Formation of 10,11-epoxy carbamazepine, a major CBZ metabolite, was significantly inhibited by these agents. Therefore, drug efflux proteins (P-gp, MRPs) and metabolizing enzyme (CYP450) are major factors in drug interactions. Overlapping substrate specificities of these proteins result in complex and sometimes perplexing pharmacokinetic profiles of multidrug regimens. Drug-drug interactions with PIs and other coadministered agents for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive population have been discussed in light of efflux transporters and metabolizing enzymes. This article provides an insight into low and variable oral bioavailability and related complications leading to loss of therapeutic activity of MDR and CYP 450 substrates.",

At AF paroxysm spectral power of alpha- and beta-rhythm significantly decreased while that of teta-rhythm grew (activation of the lymbic complex). 0-24 h after paroxysm spectral power of alpha- and beta-rhythm continued to fall, of teta-rhythm--sharply fell. Spectral EEG characteristics in this period maximally approached those of the control group. Clonazepam treatment decreased the paroxysms two times and more in 58.1% patients.

    "24": "The neurotransmitter glutamate plays a pivotal role in the development of the neuropathological sequelae following acute seizures. Our previous data proved the efficacy of the NMDA-receptor antagonists on the symptoms, survival and neuronal activation in the 4-aminopyridine- (4-AP) induced seizures. In this study, we examined the effects of two different doses of a non-competitive, selective, allosteric AMPA-receptor antagonist, GYKI 52466. GYKI 52466 was effective in prolonging the latency to generalised seizures and reduction of seizure mortality. However, the effects on neuronal c-fos expression and astrocyte swelling were complex. The 25mg/kg dose of GYKI 52466 was effective in reducing the c-fos immunoreactivity (IR) in the hippocampus only. In the neocortex the overall c-fos-IR cell counts were increased significantly. Investigation of the neocortical parvalbumin-containing interneuron population proved that GYKI 52466 decreased c-fos expression. The 50mg/kg dose of GYKI 52466 significantly reduced the c-fos-IR in the neo- and allocortex, not only in principal neurons, but also in the parvalbumin-positive interneurons. The GYKI 52466-pretreatment did not prevent the astrocyte swelling in the investigated cortical areas; thus we conclude that the AMPA-receptors have little if any involvement in the in the mediation of neuropathological alterations in acute convulsions.",

To investigate the pharmacological properties at GABA(A) receptors and to promote the development of alpha1 subunit selective radiotracers for positron emission tomography imaging, we have started with the evaluation of various fluorinated indiplon derivatives. Binding affinities were determined in homogenates from newborn and adult rats suggesting an alpha1 preference of the reference compounds indiplon, zaleplon as well as for all newly synthesized indiplon derivatives. In homogenated cerebellar tissue obtained from adult rat brain, known to primarily express alpha1 containing GABA(A) receptors, the high affinity of the basic indiplon structure was only slightly affected by an elongation of the alkyl substituent of the amide N from methyl (indiplon; K(i) 3.1 nM) via ethyl (2a, N-(2-fluoro-ethyl)-N-{3-[3-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-7-yl]phenyl}-acetamide; K(i) 5.4 nM) to propyl (2b, N-(3-fluoro-propyl)-N-{3-[3-(thiophene-2-carbonyl)-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine-7-yl]phenyl}-acetamide; K(i) 2.4 nM). Whole cell patch-clamp recordings at neuronal and recombinant GABA(A) receptors indicated that the fluorinated derivatives 2a and 2b have a high potency at alpha1beta3gamma2L isoforms comparable to indiplon (EC(50): 105, 158, and 81 nM, respectively), with 2b displaying the most pronounced efficacy at alpha3beta3gamma2L subtypes. In conclusion, the affinity profiles and functional properties of the newly synthesised fluorinated indiplon derivatives make compounds 2a and 2b suitable for the development of [(18)F]-labelled ligands at GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha1 subunit.",

The main objectives of the clinical management of AWS include: to decrease the severity of symptoms, prevent more severe withdrawal clinical manifestations and facilitate entry of the patient into a treatment program in order to attempt to achieve and maintain long-term abstinence from alcohol. At present, benzodiazepines represent the drugs of choice in the treatment of AWS. However, in line with the possible side effects and addictive properties related to benzodiazepine use, there is growing evidence to suggest that non-benzodiazepine GABAergic compounds represent promising medications in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients. This review focuses on research into non-benzodiazepine GABAergic medications for the treatment of AWS. Among them, carbamazepine, gabapentin and valproic acid are the most studied. The studies on carbamazepine seem to be the most compelling. Preliminary data have also suggested the possible utility of baclofen and topiramate, although further evidence is needed.

Delta9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive component of cannabis, is known to induce cognitive impairment that closely resembles the impairment observed in schizophrenic patients. THC has also been known to impair spatial memory in rats tested in the eight-arm radial maze. We previously reported that microinjection of THC (20 microg/side) into the rat dorsal hippocampus impaired spatial memory and that i.p. injection of THC (6 mg/kg) decreased the extracellular levels of acetylcholine (ACh) in the dorsal hippocampus. In the present study, we compared the effects of olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic, with those of haloperidol, a typical neuroleptic, on the impairments of spatial memory and decreased ACh levels induced by THC (6 mg/kg, i.p.) in rats. We found that olanzapine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the THC-induced memory deficits and decrease in extracellular ACh levels, whereas haloperidol (0.03-0.3 mg, i.p.) had no effect. These results suggest that olanzapine may improve the THC-induced impairment of spatial memory, partly by enhancing ACh release in the dorsal hippocampus. Therefore, olanzapine could attenuate the acute short-term and working memory deficits induced by cannabis.", 
    "54": "Aberrant functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis seems to be involved in depression and anxiety. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between stress and mental illness are not completely resolved yet. The therapeutical efficacy of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines points to a key role of serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in depression and anxiety. Thus, it can be hypothesised that stress-induced changes in serotonin and GABA contribute to a dysregulation of the HPA axis and to the development of psychiatric disorders in susceptible subjects. It will, therefore, be crucial to increase our understanding of the effects of stress on serotonin and GABA. Various refinements have made in vivo microdialysis an extremely powerful method to study the highly dynamic neurotransmitter responses in stress physiology and behaviour. Furthermore, microdialysis can also be used to measure free corticosterone levels in the brain and, thus, HPA axis activity and neurotransmission can be monitored concomitantly. Here we review the effects of acute and chronic stress on serotonin and GABA, as assessed by microdialysis, in the hippocampus; a brain structure critically involved in the behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to stress. From the microdialysis data discussed, it can be concluded that both serotonin and GABA in the hippocampus are highly responsive to stress, but also that these responses are shaped by the exact nature of the stressor, i.e. the balance between the psychological and physical aspects of the stressful challenge.",

Medication maintenance at 3years varied with the antipsychotic prescribed, being highest with clozapine (57.6%, 95% CI 39.2-74.5), followed by olanzapine (48.3%, 95% CI 45.1-51.5); and lowest with quetiapine (19.0%, 95% CI 13.0-26.3). Treatment discontinuation was significantly less frequent with olanzapine than with risperidone (p=0.015), depot typical (p=0.001), oral typical antipsychotics (p<0.001) or quetiapine (p<0.001); but not than with clozapine (p=0.309). Longer maintenance was also associated with higher social abilities and better cognitive status at baseline; in contrast, a shorter time to discontinuation was associated with the need for mood stabilisers during follow-up. This study emphasises the different value of antipsychotics in day-to-day clinical practice, as some of them were associated with longer medication maintenance periods than others. This study has some limitations because of possible selection and information biases derived from the non-systematic, non-randomised allocation to treatments and the existence of unobserved covariates that may influence the outcome.", 
    "74": "The relevance and property of studies related to stress effects on immune function are undisputable. All studies conducted on stress-immune relationships, however, provide from physical and/or psychological stressors. Indeed, as far as it is of our knowledge brain-innate immune responses were not analyzed after anxiogenic-like drugs use. The present experiment was then undertaken to analyze the effects of picrotoxin (0.3, 0.6 and 1.0mg/kg doses) on behavior, macrophage activity, serum corticosterone and noradrenaline (NE) levels and turnover in the brain of adult mice. Results showed that picrotoxin treatment in mice: (1) decreased motor and rearing activities in an open-field; (2) decreased the number of entries into the plus-maze open-arms and decreased the time spent in the exploration of the plus-maze open-arms; (3) decreased both motor activity and the level of holes exploration in the hole-board; (4) increased the levels of serum corticosterone in dose-dependent way; (5) increased noradrenaline (NE) and MHPG levels and NE turnover in the hypothalamus; and (6) increased Staphylococcus aureus and PMA-induced macrophage oxidative burst. However, and contrary to that reported after physical or psychological stress, this drug induced no effects on macrophage phagocytosis and NE levels and turnover in the frontal cortex. The present results are thus showing that picrotoxin induces some but not all neuro-innate immunity changes previously reported for inescapable foot-shock and psychological stressors in mice. These facts suggest that this chemical stressor triggers CNS pathways that might be somehow different from those fired by inescapable foot-shock and psychological stressors, leading to different neuro-innate immune responses.",

PYY binding densities and distributions were detected by [(125)I] binding autoradiography after rats were sacrificed either 2 h or 48 h after the last drug administration to examine both immediate and delayed effects following the drug withdrawal. Following 2 h of drug administration, it showed that olanzapine administration significantly decreased PYY binding densities, predominantly in the posterodorsal part of medial amygdaloid nucleus (52%, p<0.05), dorsal part of medial geniculate nucleus (56%, p<0.05), superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus (53%, p<0.05), parabrachial pigmented nucleus (54%, p<0.05) and periaqueductal gray (50%, p<0.05) compared to controls, while rebound increases of PYY binding densities were observed in most of examined regions 48 h later with only medial geniculate nucleus dorsal showing significant increase compared to controls (118%, p<0.01). In contrast, no change in PYY binding densities was found in the haloperidol-treated groups 2 h after drug administration, while only a significant rebound increase was observed in the dorsal part of medial geniculate nucleus (94%, p<0.01) 48 h after the haloperidol withdrawal. Alterations in PYY binding densities in brain regions such as the dorsal part of medial geniculate nucleus, superficial gray layer of superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray and parabrachial pigmented nucleus may represent the specific regions that mediate the clinical effects of antipsychotics via neuropeptide Y system.

Adult male Wistar rats were subjects. Ethanol (7.2%, v/v) was given to rats by a liquid diet for 21 days. Control rats were pair fed with an isocaloric liquid diet containing sucrose as a caloric substitute to ethanol. After 2nd, 4th and 6th h of ethanol withdrawal, rats were observed for 5 min, afterwards withdrawal signs that included locomotor hyperactivity, agitation, stereotyped behavior, tremor, wet dog shakes, abnormal posture and abnormal gait were recorded or rated. Olanzapine (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) and saline were injected to the rats intraperitoneally 30 min before ethanol withdrawal assessment. A second series of injections was also given 30 min before the 6th-h-observation, and subjects were then tested for audiogenic seizures. Olanzapine (2 mg/kg) produced significant inhibitory effects on stereotyped behaviors and wet dog shakes at the 6th h of ethanol withdrawal. Contrary, the same dose caused some increases in the intensity of posture and gait impairments at the 2nd h of ethanol withdrawal. In addition, that dose was found to be ineffective on agitation, tremor, tail stiffness and audiogenic seizures. Our results suggest that acute olanzapine treatment has beneficial effects on stereotyped behavior and wet dog shakes, but it also has some adverse effects on posture and gait during ethanol withdrawal in rats. Overall, olanzapine does not seem to be an adequate and suitable drug in controlling of ethanol withdrawal syndrome.",

After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission.

The efficacy of antipsychotics is counterbalanced by safety concerns that include cerebrovascular adverse events and mortality. Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine appear to have modest benefits for patients with mildly to moderately severe symptoms. Antidepressants are effective for treating depression in AD, but more data are required to determine the efficacy of trazodone and citalopram for agitation and aggression. Carbamazepine appears to be efficacious, although side effects and concerns about drug-drug interactions limit its use. The data do not support the use of valproate.

At our institution, analgesia following open abdominal surgery is provided by continuous infusion of analgesic solutions either intravenously, intrathecally (incorporating midazolam) or epidurally. We report the results of a study comparing outcomes with these three analgesic regimens following major open abdominal surgery. This was an unblinded prospective audit of pain service intervention rates, pain scores and other outcomes after intravenous, intrathecal and epidural analgesia after open abdominal surgery in patients over 60 years of age. Both elective and emergency cases were included over a nine-month period. Patients ventilated for 24 hours or more were excluded. The analgesic regimens were as follows: (1) Intravenous: patient controlled analgesia with morphine+ketamine infusion 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg/h. (2) Intrathecal: (morphine 10 microg/ml+midazolam 100 microg/ml+bupivacaine 0.05%) commenced at 2 ml/h. (3) Epidural: bupivacaine 0.125% +fentanyl 2 microg/ml at 6 to 14 ml/h. Co-analgesic administration was as per our usual practice but was not standardised. The median number of calls per patient to the pain service differed between the intravenous (1), intrathecal (1) and epidural (3) groups. The number of unintentional analgesic regimen terminations differed between the intravenous (1), intrathecal (1) and epidural (5) groups. Pain scores differed significantly between groups and were lowest in the intrathecal group at all time points. The findings indicate that the intrathecal group had both a low requirement for postoperative interventions/resources and excellent analgesia.

In response to liver injury, HSCs undergo a process called activation, which involves 2 steps jonit nation from quiescent phenotype to myofibroblast-like phenotype, and perpetuation that maintains the activated phenotype of HSCs. The fate of the activated HSCs depends on the apoptotic and survival signals that they receive. The apoptosis of HSCs results from a series of complex and interrelated signaling events. Apoptotic signals for the activated HSCs include proteins from membrane receptors, such as death receptors, nerve growth factor receptor and peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, as well as proteins from cytoplasm such as Bcl-2 family members. The survival signals for the activated HSCs are induced by some kinases and cytokines including tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-1, Rho/Rho kinase, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor beta-1, and insulin-like growth factor-1. Approaches that specifically initiate HSC apoptosis are promising to be direct and effective strategies to treat liver fibrosis. Although it remains unclear whether the activated HSCs could be reversed back to the quiescent phenotype, the different expression and sensitivity of pro-apoptotic and survival molecules between quiescent and activated HSCs provide a prospect to develop therapeutic approaches that specifically targets apoptosis of the activated HSCs. These therapeutic strategies to induce HSC apoptosis are current research hotspot and the future for the patients with liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.",

Hair specimens were screened for fentanyl, opiates (including oxycodone), tramadol, propoxyphene, carisoprodol, methadone, and benzodiazepines and any positive results were confirmed using gas chromatography or liquid chromatography with mass spectral detection. The specific focus of the work was the determination of fentanyl in hair, since autopsy specimens were also available for comparison with hair concentrations. Using two-dimensional gas chromatography with electron impact mass spectrometric detection, fentanyl was confirmed in four of nine hair specimens collected at autopsy.

Randomized studies investigating abnormal eating behavior (food craving, binge eating) possibly associated with weight gain are lacking. Thirty patients with schizophrenia, schizophreniform, or schizoaffective disorder were included in this randomized, double-blind, parallel study comparing abnormal eating behavior using a standardized scale, clinical efficacy using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 0-6 and Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale, and tolerability of clozapine and olanzapine. In both treatment groups, the number of patients reporting food craving, binge eating, or both increased over time. The likelihood to experience food craving at any time during drug treatment showed a trend (P = 0.068) to be higher in the olanzapine group (48.9%) compared with the clozapine group (23.3%). The likelihood to experience binge eating at any time during drug treatment was numerically but not statistically significantly higher in the olanzapine group (16.7%) than in the clozapine group (8.9%). In both groups, significant baseline-to-end point improvements of clinical symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale 0-6: clozapine, 36.6 +/- 8.8 to 15.9 +/- 13.7; olanzapine, 36.7 +/- 9.9 to 19.1 +/- 13.8) and severity of illness (Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale: clozapine, 4.7 +/- 0.6 to 2.5 +/- 1.5; olanzapine, 4.5 +/- 0.6 to 2.3 +/- 1.2) were observed. These improvements did not differ significantly between groups. Olanzapine was more tolerable than clozapine; adverse events occurred significantly (P < 0.01) less frequently than in the clozapine group. These results suggest that both clozapine and olanzapine can induce food craving and binge eating, however, olanzapine possibly to a greater extent.

Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid increased blood pressure and pupil diameter. Ethanol induced its prototypical effects, and flunitrazepam produced marked sedation.

    "121": "In animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), neurosteroid sensitivity of GABA(A) receptors on dentate granule cells (DGCs) is diminished; the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. The current study investigated a mechanism for loss of neurosteroid sensitivity of synaptic GABA(A) receptors in TLE. Synaptic currents recorded from DGCs of epileptic animals (epileptic DGCs) were less frequent, larger in amplitude, and less sensitive to allopregnanolone modulation than those recorded from DGCs of control animals (control DGCs). Synaptic currents recorded from epileptic DGCs were less sensitive to diazepam and had altered sensitivity to benzodiazepine inverse agonist RO 15-4513 (ethyl-8-azido-6-dihydro-5-methyl-6-oxo-4H-imidazo[1,5alpha][1,4]benzodiazepine-3-carboxylate) and furosemide than those recorded from control DGCs. Properties of synaptic currents recorded from epileptic DGCs appeared similar to those of recombinant receptors containing the alpha4 subunit. Expression of the alpha4 subunit and its colocalization with the synaptic marker GAD65 was increased in epileptic DGCs. Location of the alpha4 subunit in relation to symmetric (inhibitory) synapses on soma and dendrites of control and epileptic DGCs was examined with postembedding immunogold electron microscopy. The alpha4 immunogold labeling was present more commonly within the synapse in epileptic DGCs compared with control DGCs, in which the subunit was extrasynaptic. These studies demonstrate that, in epileptic DGCs, the neurosteroid modulation of synaptic currents is diminished and alpha4 subunit-containing receptors are present at synapses and participate in synaptic transmission. These changes may facilitate seizures in epileptic animals.", 
    "122": "Recent evidence indicates the presence of presynaptic GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)Rs) in the axon domain of several classes of central neurons, including cerebellar basket and stellate cells. Here, we investigate the possibility that these receptors could be activated in the absence of electrical or chemical stimulation. We find that low concentrations of GABA increase the frequency of miniature GABAergic synaptic currents. Submaximal concentrations of a GABA(A)R blocker, gabazine, decrease both the miniature current frequency and the probability of evoked GABA release. Zolpidem, an agonist of the benzodiazepine binding site, and NO-711 (1-[2-[[(diphenylmethylene)imino]oxy]ethyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3-pyridinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride), a blocker of GABA uptake, both increase the frequency of miniature currents. These effects occur up to postnatal day 14, but not later. Immunohistochemistry indicates the presence of alpha1-containing GABA(A)Rs in interneuron presynaptic terminals with a similar age dependence. We conclude that, under resting conditions, axonal GABA(A)Rs are significantly activated, that this activation results in enhanced GABA release, and that it can be augmented by increasing the affinity of GABA(A)Rs or reducing GABA uptake. Our findings suggest the existence of a positive-feedback mechanism involving presynaptic GABA(A)Rs that maintains a high release rate and a high local GABA concentration in the immature cerebellar network.", 
    "123": "G-protein-coupled receptors signaling bitter taste (T2Rs) in the oral gustatory system and the alpha-subunit of the taste-specific G-protein gustducin are expressed in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. alpha-Subunit of the taste-specific G-protein gustducin colocalizes with markers of enteroendocrine cells in human and mouse GI mucosa, including peptide YY. Activation of T2Rs increases cholecystokinin (CCK) release from the enteroendocrine cell line, STC-1. The aim of this study was to determine whether T2R agonists in the GI tract activate neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and whether this activation is mediated by CCK and peptide YY acting at CCK(1) and Y(2) receptors. Immunocytochemistry for the protooncogene c-Fos protein, a marker for neuronal activation, was used to determine activation of neurons in the midregion of the NTS, the region where vagal afferents from the GI tract terminate. Intragastric administration of the T2R agonist denatonium benzoate (DB), or phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), or a combination of T2R agonists significantly increased the number of Fos-positive neurons in the mid-NTS; subdiaphragmatic vagotomy abolished the NTS response to the mixture of T2R agonists. Deletion of CCK(1) receptor gene or blockade of CCK(1) receptors with devazepide abolishes the activation of NTS neurons in response to DB, but had no effect on the response to PTC. Administration of the Y(2) receptor antagonist BIIE0246 blocks the activation of NTS neurons to DB, but not PTC. These findings suggest that activation of neurons in the NTS following administration of T2R agonists to the GI tract involves CCK(1) and Y(2) receptors located on vagal afferent terminals in the gut wall. T2Rs may regulate GI function via release of regulatory peptides and activation of the vagal reflex pathway.",

Some of the results were expensive confirmations of known prior results; of the commonly prescribed drugs, clozapine was the most effective, and olanzapine and ziprasidone caused the most and fewest metabolic side effects, respectively. The most stunning finding was that psychiatrists tend to ignore life-threatening, treatable medical conditions in patients presenting for treatment with schizophrenia. Of patients entering the study, 45% had untreated diabetes, 89% had untreated hyperlipidemias and 62% had untreated hypertension.

    "142": "Midazolam is a potent benzodiazepine derivative with sedative, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, muscle-relaxant, and anxiolytic activities. It undergoes oxidative metabolism catalyzed almost exclusively by the CYP3A subfamily to a major metabolite, 1'-hydroxymidazolam, which is equipotent to midazolam. 1'-Hydroxymidazolam is subject to glucuronidation followed by renal excretion. To date, the glucuronidation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam has not been evaluated in detail. In the current study, we identified an unreported quaternary N-glucuronide, as well as the known O-glucuronide, from incubations of 1'-hydroxymidazolam in human liver microsomes enriched with uridine 5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA). The structure of the N-glucuronide was confirmed by nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, which showed that glucuronidation had occurred at N-2 (the imidazole nitrogen that is not a part of the benzodiazepine ring). In a separate study, in which midazolam was used as the substrate, an analogous N-glucuronide also was detected from incubations with human liver microsomes in the presence of UDPGA. Investigation of the kinetics of 1'-hydroxymidazolam glucuronidation in human liver microsomes indicated autoactivation kinetics (Hill coefficient, n = 1.2-1.5). The apparent S(50) values for the formation of O- and N-glucuronides were 43 and 18 microM, respectively, and the corresponding apparent V(max) values were 363 and 21 pmol/mg of microsomal protein/min. Incubations with recombinant human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) indicated that the O-glucuronidation was catalyzed by UGT2B4 and UGT2B7, whereas the N-glucuronidation was catalyzed by UGT1A4. Consistent with these observations, hecogenin, a selective inhibitor of UGT1A4, selectively inhibited the N-glucuronidation, whereas diclofenac, a potent inhibitor of UGT2B7, had a greater inhibitory effect on the O-glucuronidation than on the N-glucuronidation. In summary, our study provides the first demonstration of N-glucuronidation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam in human liver microsomes.",

This is in part due to an underlying age-related decline in CNS function and in part due to increased pharmacodynamic sensitivity for some benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and opioids. The most important pharmacodynamic differences with age for cardiovascular agents are the decrease in effect for beta-adrenergic agents. This decline in response in vascular, cardiac, and pulmonary tissue may be due to a decrease in Gs protein interactions. Most studies indicate there is no decrease in cx-receptor sensitivity with age. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors do not show age-related differences in elderly patients. With the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, there was a slight increase in effect for older adults, but this was only for treatment-naive patients and was transient. Nondihydropyridines did not show an age- associated change in pharmacodynamic effect; however, in the elderly, there appeared to be a decrease in the PR interval prolongation normally seen with these agents. Studies of diuretics indicated that the changes in diuretic and natriuretic effects seen in the elderly were associated with pharmacokinetic changes and were not pharmacodynamic in nature.

To specifically evaluate the effects of acute, extended (rather than chronic) sedative and analgesic exposure, the study focused on an ICU population receiving these agents for at least 48 hours but <2 weeks.", 
    "163": "Eighteen medical ICU patients (11 females, 7 males; mean [SD] age, 66.1 [18.1] years) on mechanical ventilation comprised the study cohort. Fifteen patients were aged >62 years, and 11 of those were aged > or =71 years. Plasma drug concentrations (median and interquartile range) were as follows: fentanyl--2.1 ng/mL, 0.9-3.4 ng/mL; lorazepam--266 ng/mL, 112-412 ng/mL; and propofol--845 ng/mL, 334-1342 ng/mL. Maximum concentrations were 3- to 12-fold higher than medians (fentanyl, 7.3 ng/mL; lorazepam, 3108 ng/mL; propofol, 10,000 ng/mL). Medication doses were only moderately correlated with RASS scores (Spearman rho): fentanyl--rho = -0.39, P = 0.002; lorazepam--rho = -0.28, P = 0.001; and propofol--rho = -0.46, P < 0.001. Plasma drug concentrations of fentanyl and lorazepam demonstrated moderate correlations with sedation scores (fentanyl--rho = -0.46, P = 0.002; lorazepam: rho = -0.49, P < 0.001), while propofol concentrations correlated poorly with sedation scores (rho = -0.18, P = 0.07). Associations between interval drug doses and plasma concentrations were as follows: fentanyl, rho = 0.84; lorazepam, rho = 0.76; and propofol, rho = 0.61 (all, P < 0.001). Instructive examples of discrepant dose versus plasma concentration profiles and drug interactions are provided, including 3 cases with patients aged > or =64 years.", 
    "164": "Elderly patients are commonly encountered in the ICU setting. Only moderate correlations existed between clinical sedation levels and dose or plasma concentration of sedative/analgesic medications in this study population. Further work is needed to understand appropriate and feasible measures of exposure to sedatives/analgesics relating to clinical outcomes.", 
    "165": "The objective of this study was to gain insight into the molecular mechanism of induced cell death (apoptosis) by PYRROLO [1,2-b][1,2,5]BENZOTHIADIAZEPINES (PBTDs) series compounds, using human (K562) cells as a model.", 
    "166": "We focused our attention on some members of the PBTDs family to test their potential apoptotic activity in K562 cells. Important apoptotic activity was demonstrated, as evidenced by the concentration and percentage of cell death quantified by measuring PI-uptake by flow cytometry, and DNA fragmentation analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, generating a characteristic ladder pattern of discontinuous DNA fragments. The expression of Bcl-2 family was tested using western blotting and transfection method.", 
    "167": "PBTDs-mediated suppression of K562 cell proliferation was induced by apoptosis characterized by the appearance of DNA fragmentation and was associated with the poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) cleavage. PBTD-1 and -3 treatment resulted in caspase-3 activation through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and up-regulation of Bax. Furthermore, we used K562/vector and K562/bcl-2 cells, which were generated by transfection of the cDNA of the Bcl-2 gene. As compared with K562/vector, K562/Bcl-2 cells exhibited a 4-fold greater expression of Bcl-2. Treatment with 10 muM PBTD-1 and -3 for 24 h produced morphological features of apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in K562/vector cells, respectively. In contrast, PBTD-1 and -3-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were inhibited in K562/Bcl-2. Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpressing cells exhibited less cytocrome c release during PBTDs-induced apoptosis.", 
    "168": "These results indicate that PBTDs effectively induce apoptosis of K562 leukemia cells through the activation of caspase cascades. In addition, these findings indicate that Bcl-2 inhibits PBTD-1 and -3 induced-apoptosis via a mechanism that interferes with cytocrome c release, and the activity of caspase-3, which is involved in the execution of apoptosis.", 
    "169": "A 25-year-old woman was separated for 6 weeks on account of her suicidal and chaotic behaviour occurring within the framework of a first manic episode. Her response to medication (olanzapine 20 mg, clorazepate 50 mg and lithium (serum level 0.9 mmol/l)) was inadequate. After only one ect treatment her condition had improved to such an extent that she no longer needed to be isolated. After about 4 weeks her mental condition was reasonably good; her medication consisted only of 10 mg of olanzapine and she could be transferred to out-patient care. ect can bring about rapid improvement in patients with therapy-resistant manic symptoms.", 
    "170": "After Sweden's zero-tolerance law came into force (1 July 1999), the number of cases of driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) submitted by the police for toxicological analysis increased more than 10-fold. This prompted an in-depth investigation into the kinds of drugs used by DUID offenders, whether licit or illicit, and the frequency of their occurrence.", 
    "171": "All blood samples from DUID suspects sent by the police for toxicological analysis over a 4-year period (2001-2004) were investigated (N = 22,777 cases). Specimens of blood or urine were subjected to a broad screening analysis by immunoassay methods aimed at detecting amphetamines, cannabis, opiates, cocaine metabolite, and the major benzodiazepines. All positive results from the screening stage were verified by use of more specific analytical methods (e.g., GC-MS, LC-MS, GC-FID, and GC-NPD).", 
    "172": "Between 80 and 85% of all the blood samples contained at least one banned substance and many contained two or more therapeutic and/or illicit drugs. About 15% of cases were negative for drugs, although these frequently (30-50%) contained ethanol above the legal limit for driving in Sweden, which is 0.20 mg/g (0.02 g%). Amphetamine was the most prominent illicit drug seen in 55-60% of cases either alone or together with other drugs of abuse. Stimulants like cocaine and/or its metabolite were infrequently encountered ( approximately 1.2% of cases). The next most prevalent illicit drug was cannabis, with positive results for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in blood either alone ( approximately 4%) or together with other psychoactive substances ( approximately 20%). Morphine, codeine, and/or 6-acetyl morphine were identified in approximately 2% of all DUID suspects, being indicative of heroin abuse. The major prescription drugs identified in blood were benzodiazepines (10%) as exemplified by diazepam, alprazolam, nitrazepam, and flunitrazepam. Drugs for treating insomnia, zolpidem and zopiclone, were also identified in blood samples from DUID suspects over the study period. Other therapeutic agents were encountered in only 1-2% of all cases.", 
    "173": "The dramatic increase in DUID after the zero-tolerance law came into force probably reflects enhanced police activity and more enthusiasm to apprehend and charge individuals for this offence. Illicit drugs, particularly amphetamine and cannabis, and poly-drug use were predominant compared with use of scheduled prescription drugs. The typical DUID offender in Sweden abuses central stimulants, particularly amphetamine, and has probably done so over many years. Options for treating offenders for their underlying substance abuse problem should be considered instead of the more conventional penalties for drug-impaired driving.", 
    "174": "L-Dopa therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) is counfounded by the development of involuntary movements such as L-Dopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs). In this study GABA(A) receptor autoradiography was assessed using [(3)H]flunitrazepam binding to the benzodiazepine site of the GABA(A) receptor and [(35)S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) binding to the chloride channel of GABA(A) receptors in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). L-Dopa-treated parkinsonian monkeys experiencing LIDs were compared to animals in which LIDs was prevented by adjunct treatments with CI-1041, a selective antagonist of the NR1A/2B subtype of NMDA receptor, or low doses of the dopamine D2 receptor agonist, cabergoline. Our results demonstrated a decrease of GABA(A) receptor specific binding in the posterior part of the SNr in dyskinetic monkeys compared to nondyskinetic animals, while no modulation has been observed in the STN. These results provide evidence for the first time that pharmacological treatments preventing LIDs in nonhuman primate model of PD are associated with normalization of GABA(A) receptor-mediated signalling in the SNr.",

    "176": "1606 subjects, aged > 60 years, corresponding to 92% of the residents of Bambu\u00ed city, participated in this study. The information about medication use was obtained by means of a standard interview and the review of medication packaging. Substances were classified using the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Index.", 
    "177": "The prevalence of benzodiazepine current use was 21.7% (26.7% among females and 14.0% among males). From these, 68.7% had been taking the medication for over one year, 31.3% for over five years and 53.2% were using long half-life benzodiazepines. The medication most frequently used was bromazepam (35.6%), followed by diazepam (22.5%), clonazepam (12.6%) and lorazepam (7.8%). After adjustment for confounders, female gender (RP = 1.93; CI95% = 1.51-2.46) was the only sociodemographic characteristic found to be independently associated with substance consumption.", 
    "178": "The prevalence of benzodiazepine use in the study population was high, but within the variation observed in developed countries. Chronic use of benzodiazepines and long half-life medications predominated.", 
    "179": "Inhibitory circuits are crucial in modulating corticospinal output in the primary motor cortex (M1). Relatively little is known about how these inhibitory circuits interact. Here we measured three forms of inhibition in M1 by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation: short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) and short-interval interhemispheric inhibition (SIHI). We specifically tested their interactions under pharmacological challenge with a single oral dose of diazepam, a positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA A R), or baclofen, a specific agonist at the GABA type B receptor (GABA B R). Motor evoked potentials were recorded bilaterally from the first dorsal interosseous muscle in eight right-handed healthy volunteers. Diazepam enhanced SICI, and baclofen produced a trend towards enhanced LICI, corroborating the view that SICI reflects inhibition mediated by the GABA A R, and LICI very likely reflects inhibition mediated by the GABA B R. The pharmacology of SIHI was inconclusive and warrants further investigation. Findings strongly suggest that SICI, LICI and SIHI recruit three distinct inhibitory circuits in the human M1. The interactions between SIHI and SICI, LICI and SIHI, and LICI and SICI were all negative, that is SIHI suppressed SICI, and LICI suppressed both SIHI and SICI. Diazepam partially restored SICI in the presence of LICI, while all other interactions remained unaffected by diazepam or baclofen. It will be argued that the negative interactions between SIHI and SICI, LICI and SIHI, and LICI and SICI are most likely due to presynaptic GABA B R-mediated autoinhibition.", 
    "180": "The aim of this study was to assess the use of intranasal midazolam in paediatric dental patients requiring extractions or simple surgical procedures who may otherwise have required a general anaesthetic. Twenty children aged between 2-9 years who required simple surgical procedures were given 0.25 mg.kg(-1) midazolam, administered using a MAD (Mucosal Atomization Device; Wolfe Tory Medical Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, USA). Compliance with the full dose was achieved in 14 patients, 13 of whom completed the treatment. One of two patients who allowed only partial administration completed the treatment and three patients did not comply. The mean time to starting treatment was 13 min (range 6-25 min) and patients were discharged after a mean of 46 min (range 25-67 min). Physiological parameters remained stable throughout with no clinically significant episodes of desaturation. One patient vomited at home postoperatively. Midazolam in a dose of 0.25 mg.kg(-1) administered intranasally provided adequate anxiolysis for the majority of children, allowing them to complete their treatment.", 
    "181": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep that results in the impairment of daytime functioning, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In most countries approximately every third inhabitant has insomnia. Insomnia can be classified as primary and secondary. The pathogenesis of primary insomnia is unknown, but available evidence suggests a state of hyperarousal. Insomnia secondary to other causes is more common than primary insomnia. Cerebral hypoperfusion can be the cause of insomnia in some cases. In such patients the cerebral blood flow should be improved using parenteral vascular therapy. If insomnia persists despite treatment, then therapy for primary insomnia should be instituted using benzodiazepine-receptor agonists such as Zolpidem, Zopiclone, or Zaleplon. In those cases Midazolam cannot be used for the treatment of insomnia due to its marked negative effect on cerebral blood flow. In Hungary there is a need to organize multidisciplinary Insomnia Clinics because insomnia is more than a disease, it is a public health problem in this century.",

    "184": "Patients with renal impairment needing mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Two groups: remifentanil (R) and fentanyl (F), Infusion rates were titrated to achieve the desired Ramsay score. The two groups received midazolam (2.5 mg then 0.1 mg/kg/h).", 
    "185": "Nineteen patients were included. Patient's characteristics, mean sedation time and sedation quality were comparable. Extubation time was significantly shorter in R group (1480+/-980 versus 2880+/-1280 min, P=0.04). Weaning time was also shorter in R group (220+/-164 versus 720+/-480 min). Agitation on weaning was comparable in the two groups. Group R received significantly more morphine than group F after interruption of sedation.", 
    "186": "Daily interruption of sedation with remifentanil is associated with shorter weaning and extubation time in patients with renal impairment. However further studies are necessary to determine if this issue is associated with lower rate of ventilation induced complications.", 
    "187": "The present study employs a recently reported liquid chromatography-(time of flight) mass spectrometry procedure for the simultaneous analysis of 22 benzodiazepines in human urine specimens. The analysis focused on the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepines and/or their metabolites. Using this method, the limit of quantitation for the benzodiazepines tested ranged from 2 to 10 ng/mL, while the limit of detection range was 0.5 to 3.0 ng/mL. Urine specimens collected from alleged victims of drug-facilitated sexual assault (156 specimens) were tested. Only 19 out of the 22 benzodiazepines analyzed were detected in these specimens. These same specimens were previously screened for benzodiazepines by various immunoassay techniques using a 50 ng/mL cut-off level and confirmed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method after acid hydrolysis to their benzophenone skeletons, thus making the identification of the specific benzodiazepine(s) involved impossible for most specimens. This study aims to offer an alternative methodology that would allow such identification for similar specimens. Additionally, the distribution of the individual benzodiazepines of interest among the 156 specimens as well as their prevalence in specimens originating in different U.S. states is presented.", 
    "188": "Testing oral fluid for drugs of abuse has been studied under many conditions but rarely has been evaluated in large population databases. We evaluated oral fluid tests in a database from a commercial laboratory in the United Kingdom composed of 8679 confirmed positive results. The results originated from 635,000 specimens collected over the period of May 2004 through September 2006. Oral fluid specimens were collected with the Intercept oral fluid collection device, screened by enzyme immunoassay, and confirmed by GC-MS or GC-MS-MS. The database was organized by collection settings (legal/treatment, N = 8198 specimens; and workplace, N = 481 specimens) and by drug groups (without consideration of collection setting). The drug groups were as follows (number of confirmed positives): amphetamines (468); benzodiazepines (892); buprenorphine (276); cannabinoids (725); cocaine (1443); methadone (998); and opiates (5739). The goal of the study was to provide drug/metabolite prevalence data, concentrations, and drugs/metabolite patterns encountered in oral fluid. Comparison of results by collection setting indicated differences in relative frequency, primarily for opiates and cannabinoids. Opiate positives were most frequently observed for specimens collected in legal/treatment settings, whereas cannabinoids were most frequently reported in the workplace. An array of information on drug and metabolite occurrences and concentration arose from evaluation of the data by drug groups. Amphetamine was the predominant drug reported for the Amphetamines Group; approximately 10% were also positive for MDA and/or MDMA; and methamphetamine was rarely reported. Multiple combinations of diazepam, nordiazepam, oxazepam, temazepam, chlordiazepoxide, and lorazepam were reported for the Benzodiazepine Group. Buprenorphine, an opioid treatment drug, was the predominant analyte reported, but low concentrations of norbuprenorphine were frequently reported. THC was the predominant analyte reported in the Cannabinoids Group and was frequently reported in combination with cannabidiol and cannabinol. THCCOOH was reported in only 10.8% of these specimens and was never reported in the absence of THC. HO-THC was reported in 5.7% of the specimens. In the Cocaine Group, cocaine was present, often in combination with BZE, but also as the sole analyte in 17.3% of the specimens. AEME and cocaethylene were reported in 10.4% and 5.5% of the specimens. Methadone, another opioid treatment drug, was reported in all specimens for the Methadone Group; EDDP was reported in 30.1% of the specimens. In the Opiates Group, morphine, codeine and 6-acetylmorhine were most frequently reported, often in combination. The frequency of detection of 6-acetylmorphine when morphine was present (N = 4575 specimens) was 77.5%. Surprisingly, heroin (19.0%; N = 1091 specimens) and 6-acetylcodeine (24.9%; N = 1431 specimens) were frequently reported. The results from analysis of this large oral fluid database offer a rich mixture of new information on detection frequency, drug and metabolite patterns, and concentration data on drugs of abuse.",

    "193": "Little is known about the sites of action for the behavioral effects of chronic antidepressants. The novelty-induced hypophagia (NIH) test is one of few animal behavioral tests sensitive to acute benzodiazepines and chronic antidepressants. The goals of these experiments were to examine patterns of brain activation associated with the behavioral response to novelty and identify regions that could regulate the anxiolytic effects of acute benzodiazepine and chronic antidepressant treatments, measured using the NIH test. In the first experiment, rats were treated acutely with the anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide (2.5 or 5 mg/kg, i.p.). In separate experiments, animals were implanted with osmotic minipumps delivering vehicle or fluoxetine (5 or 20 mg/kg per day s.c.) for 3 or 28 days. NIH was assessed by giving animals access to a familiar palatable food in a novel environment. Associated brain areas were identified using c-fos immunohistochemistry. NIH was mitigated by acute chlordiazepoxide and chronic fluoxetine. Both drugs reversed novelty-induced changes in c-fos expression in the lateral division of the posterolateral part of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (STLP), cingulate cortex (Cg), and dorsal field CA2 of the hippocampus (dCA2). Chronic fluoxetine additionally increased c-fos expression in the anterior nucleus accumbens (aAcb) and the piriform cortex (Pir). The effects of the drugs on c-fos expression in many regions correlated with anxiolytic efficacy. These findings identified brain regions where the effects of chronic antidepressants and benzodiazepines may converge to produce anxiolytic activity, as well as distinct sites of action for the two classes of drugs.", 
    "194": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is a common management problem in hospital practice for neurologists, psychiatrists and general physicians alike. Although some patients have mild symptoms and may even be managed in the outpatient setting, others have more severe symptoms or a history of adverse outcomes that requires close inpatient supervision and benzodiazepine therapy. Many patients with AWS have multiple management issues (withdrawal symptoms, delirium tremens, the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, seizures, depression, polysubstance abuse, electrolyte disturbances and liver disease), which requires a coordinated, multidisciplinary approach. Although AWS may be complex, careful evaluation and available treatments should ensure safe detoxification for most patients.", 
    "195": "Studies on animal models of epilepsy and cerebellar ataxia, e.g., stargazer mice (stg) have identified changes in the GABAergic properties of neurones associated with the affected brain loci. Whether these changes contribute to or constitute homeostatic adaptations to a state of altered neuronal excitability is as yet unknown. Using cultured cerebellar granule neurones from control [+/+; alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate receptor (AMPAR)-competent, Kainate receptor (KAR)-competent] and stg (AMPAR-incompetent, KAR-competent), we investigated whether non-NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity regulates GABA(A) receptor (GABAR) expression. Neurones were maintained in 5 mmol/L KCl-containing basal media or depolarizing media containing either 25 mmol/L KCl or the non-NMDAR agonist kainic acid (KA) (100 micromol/L). KCl- and KA-mediated depolarization down-regulated GABAR alpha1, alpha6 and beta2, but up-regulated alpha4, beta3 and delta subunits in +/+ neurones. The KCl-evoked but not KA-evoked effects were reciprocated in stg neurones compatible with AMPAR-regulation of GABAR expression. Conversely, GABAR gamma2 expression was insensitive to KCl-mediated depolarization, but was down-regulated by KA-treatment in a 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX)-reversible manner in +/+ and stg neurones compatible with a KAR-mediated response. KA-mediated up-regulation of GABAR alpha4, beta3 and delta was inhibited by L-type voltage-gated calcium channel (L-VGCC) blockers and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor, 4-[(2S)-2-[(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl)methylamino]-3-oxo-3-(4-phenyl-1-piperazinyl)propyl] phenyl isoquinoline sulfonic acid ester (KN-62). Up-regulation of GABAR alpha4 and beta3 was also prevented by calcineurin (CaN) inhibitors, FK506 and cyclosporin A. Down-regulation of GABAR alpha1, alpha6 and beta2 was independent of L-VGCC activity, but was prevented by inhibitors of CaN. Thus, we provide evidence that a KAR-mediated and at least three mutually exclusive AMPAR-mediated signalling mechanisms regulate neuronal GABAR expression.", 
    "196": "We used a multidrug intravenous anesthesia regimen with midazolam, ketamine, and propofol to provide anesthesia for children during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Treatment assignment was randomized based on the date of the MRI. Physiological parameters were monitored during anesthesia and recovery. Desaturation (SpO2<93%), airway problems, and the need to repeat the scan were recorded. The discharge criteria were stable vital signs, return to baseline consciousness, absence of any side effects, and ability to ambulate.",

The total incidence of side effects was comparable between the MKP (7.7%) and GET groups (7.0%). Infants below the age of 1 year showed a significantly higher incidence of adverse events compared with the other age strata within each group.

Onset of sedation was significantly faster after premedication with midazolam (30+/-13.1 min) than with clonidine (38.5+/-14.6 min), but level of sedation was significantly better after premedication with clonidine. Quality of mask induction was equally successful in both groups. A steal-induction was performed in 66% of patients of group C, but none in group M. We observed a trend towards an increased incidence of emergence agitation after premedication with midazolam. Parental satisfaction was significantly higher in group C.",

We conducted an effect size (ES) analysis of 21 double-blind placebo-controlled trials of medications treating DSM-III-R, DSM-IV or ICD-10 GAD using HAM-A change in score from baseline or endpoint score as the main efficacy measure. Literature search was performed using MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases including articles published between 1987 and 2003 and personal communications with investigators and sponsors. comparing all drugs versus placebo, the ES was 0.39. Mean ESs, excluding children, were PGB: 0.50, AH: 0.45, SNRI: 0.42, BZ: 0.38, SSRI: 0.36, AZA: 0.17 and CAM: -0.31. Comparing ES for adults versus children/adolescents (excluding CAM) and conventional drugs versus CAM (excluding children/adolescents) we found significantly higher ES for children/adolescents and for conventional drugs (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). No significant differences were found when comparing date of publication, location of site (i.e. US versus other), fixed versus flexible dosing, number of study arms, or number of outcome measures used. Medications varied in the magnitude of their ES, ranging from moderate to poor. Adolescents and children showed a much greater ES compared with adults. Subjects taking CAM had worse outcomes than placebo.", 
    "210": "The balance between inhibitory (gamma aminobutyric acid; GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) neurotransmission is thought to be associated with craving for alcohol and food. The anticraving effect of acamprosate is thought to be mediated through modifying the balance of GABA and glutamate. Recent studies in animals have suggested that acamprosate may have non-selective effects on craving for both alcohol and food.", 
    "211": "The influence of acamprosate for reducing craving for alcohol and food was assessed in 204 in-patients with alcohol dependence (96 patients treated with acamprosate, PWA; 108 patients were not treated PNA) was assessed at baseline and following 1, 2, and 4 weeks of treatment.", 
    "212": "There was a significant reduction in craving for alcohol over 4 weeks of treatment in both PWA and PNA groups, but without significant group differences. In contrast, a reduction in food craving was observed only in the PWA group. In addition, there was a significant increase of body mass index (BMI) in the PNA group but not the PWA group over the 4-week period.", 
    "213": "These results demonstrate acamprosate nonselective effects on craving for drinking and eating in alcoholic patients.", 
    "214": "The purpose of this study was to identify the characteristics of psychotropic drug use and abuse by drugs addicts. The results are based on data from OPPIDUM (Observation des Produits Psychotropes Illicites ou D\u00e9tourn\u00e9s de leur Utilisation M\u00e9dicamenteuse), an annual survey primarily concerned with the consumption of licit and illicit drugs. The study involved 3373 patients recruited during october 2004 from 109 health centers. The main trends observed were an increasing interest for opioid maintenance treatment by methadone versus buprenorphine high dosage (patients treated by methadone are mainly represented for the first year of the OPPIDUM program), some changes in illicit drugs uses (increase in sniff and decrease in intravenous injection) and changes in the grading of the most consumpted benzodiazepines (decrease in flunitrazepam consumption and increase in clonazepam consumption). Main warnings concern the buprenorphine illicit use leading to firstly dependence and the illicit use of some benzodiazepines, especially clonazepam.", 
    "215": "The PERSEO study (psychiatric emergency study and epidemiology) is a naturalistic, observational clinical survey in Italian acute hospital psychiatric units, called SPDCs (Servizio Psichiatrico Diagnosi e Cura; in English, the psychiatric service for diagnosis and management). The aims of this paper are: (i) to describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients, including sociodemographic features, risk factors, life habits and psychiatric diagnoses; and (ii) to assess the clinical management, subjective wellbeing and attitudes toward medications.", 
    "216": "A total of 62 SPDCs distributed throughout Italy participated in the study and 2521 patients were enrolled over the 5-month study period.", 
    "217": "Almost half of patients (46%) showed an aggressive behaviour at admission to ward, but they engaged more commonly in verbal aggression (38%), than in aggression toward other people (20%). A total of 78% of patients had a psychiatric diagnosis at admission, most frequently schizophrenia (36%), followed by depression (16%) and personality disorders (14%), and no relevant changes in the diagnoses pattern were observed during hospital stay. Benzodiazepines were the most commonly prescribed drugs, regardless of diagnosis, at all time points. Overall, up to 83% of patients were treated with neuroleptic drugs and up to 27% received more than one neuroleptic either during hospital stay or at discharge. Atypical and conventional antipsychotics were equally prescribed for schizophrenia (59 vs 65% during stay and 59 vs 60% at discharge), while atypical drugs were preferred in schizoaffective psychoses (72 vs 49% during stay and 70 vs 46% at discharge) and depression (41 vs 32% during stay and 44 vs 25% at discharge). Atypical neuroleptics were slightly preferred to conventional ones at hospital discharge (52 vs 44%). Polypharmacy was in general widely used. Patient attitudes toward medications were on average positive and self-reported compliance increased during hospital stay.", 
    "218": "Results confirm the widespread use of antipsychotics and the increasing trend in atypical drugs prescription, in both psychiatric in- and outpatients."
