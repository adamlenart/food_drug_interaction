Depending on the drug signs of neonatal withdrawal vary but mainly include central nervous system irritability. NAS causes long duration of hospital stay. Severe withdrawal signs are seen in infants exposed to methadone, infants exposed to other opioids like heroin or buprenorphine have been shown to be less symptomatic. Between the years 1997 and 2003 following the border opening there was a dramatic increase in drug exposed newborns seen in the area of Leipzig (East Germany).",

Additional drug use to substitution therapy was seen in 15 mothers. Drugs of abuse were detected in infant urine specimen (36/48). 35 of exposed newborns showed signs of NAS (incidence of NAS 71%). For evaluation of withdrawal signs and conduction of therapy the Finnegan score was used. As first line pharmacological treatment phenobarbitone was administered (n=42), secondary morphine was used (n=14, treatment failure 33%). Mean duration of hospital stay was 21 days. Mean duration of pharmacological treatment was 14 days with longer duration for methadone exposed infants vs. non-methadone exposed infants (16 vs. 10 days). Hospital stay was longer for non-methadone exposed infants.

The dorsal vagal complex (DVC) of the brainstem and the endogenous cannabinoid system are implicated in the regulation of appetite signalling and food intake. We investigated whether antipsychotic drugs alter cannabinoid receptor-binding density in the DVC. Female Spraguewk (short-term) or 120.83, p=0.01). In addition, only chronic olanzapine treatment increased food intake. These results show that olanzapine, an antipsychotic with a high risk of weight gain as a side-effect, significantly decreased cannabinoid receptor binding in the DVC, whilst aripiprazole and haloperidol, antipsychotics with a low risk of weight gain had little or no effect on binding. These results suggest that a mechanism for antipsychotic-induced weight gain may be through the modulation of cannabinoid receptors in the DVC.", 
    "13": "Despite their use of prophylactic antiemetic therapies, cancer patients continue to consider chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) to be a significant problem. Patients frequently use various \"breakthrough\" medications for these symptoms. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of trials regarding treatment of breakthrough CINV. This study investigated the efficacy of \"ABH,\" a topical gel containing lorazepam (Ativan), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and haloperidol (Haldol), in reducing breakthrough CINV. Adults receiving standard recommended prophylactic antiemetics as outpatients were instructed to use 0.5 mL of the gel topically when they experienced significant CINV. Patients then were contacted retrospectively to respond to a questionnaire rating their nausea and/or vomiting and their response to ABH-gel treatment. The results were collected during two trials: Trial I began in April 2003, and Trial II began in March 2006. During Trial I, 23 patients were evaluated; 17 patients (74%) reported that use of the gel decreased their CINV, with 15 (70%) reporting relief within 30 minutes of its application. Three patients believed that the gel caused sedation; no troubles with skin irritation or muscle spasms were reported. In Trial II, all 10 patients believed that the treatment was effective. When the severity of CINV was quantified on a scale of 0-10, the mean CINV score decreased significantly from a 6.1 before gel application to a 1.7 as evaluated 30 minutes following gel application (P < 0.005). Topical use of ABH gel appears to be a promising and safe rescue therapy for breakthrough CINV that occurs despite prophylactic antiemetic therapy. These results warrant further confirmation in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.",

    "15": "Classical benzodiazepine sensitive GABA(A) receptor subtypes, the major mediators of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain are heteropentamers that can be assembled from alpha1-3/5, beta1-3, and gamma2 subunits, but how neurons orchestrate their selective accumulation at synapses remains obscure. We have identified a 10 amino acid hydrophobic motif within the intracellular domain of the alpha2 subunit that regulates the accumulation of GABA(A) receptors at inhibitory synaptic sites on both axon initial segments and dendrites in a mechanism dependent on the inhibitory scaffold protein gephyrin. This motif was sufficient to target CD4 (cluster of differentiation molecule 4) molecules to inhibitory synapses, and was also critical in regulating the direct binding of alpha2 subunits to gephyrin in vitro. Our results thus reveal that the specific accumulation of GABA(A) receptor subtypes containing alpha2 subunits at inhibitory synapses is dependent on their ability to bind gephyrin.", 
    "16": "Midazolam (MDZ) is one of the most commonly used in vivo and in vitro CYP3A4 probe substrates for drug-drug interactions (DDI) studies. The major metabolic pathway of MDZ in humans consists of the CYP3A4-mediated 1'-hydroxylation followed by urinary excretion as 1'-O-glucuronide derivative. In the present study, following incubation of MDZ with human liver microsomes supplemented with UDP-glucuronic acid, two major high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) peaks were isolated. HPLC and liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analyses identified these two metabolites as quaternary direct N-glucuronides of MDZ, thus revealing an additional metabolic pathway for MDZ. (1)H NMR spectrometry studies were performed showing that these two glucuronides were beta-N-glucuronides, which could be considered as two different conformers of the same molecule. According to molecular modeling experiments, the two glucuronide derivatives could be involved in atropoisomerism equilibrium. The formation of MDZ N-glucuronide exhibited moderate intersubject variability (at most 4.5-fold difference, n = 10). Among the recombinant human UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isoforms tested, only isoform UGT1A4 catalyzed the N-glucuronidation of MDZ fitting a Michaelis-Menten model. K(m) and V(max) values were 29.9 +/- 2.4 microM and 659.6 +/- 19.0 pmol/min/mg protein, respectively. The N-glucuronide derivative was found in human hepatocytes incubated under control conditions but also in the presence of the well known CYP3A4 inhibitor, ketoconazole. In the context of the in vitro study of CYP3A4-mediated DDI using MDZ and ketoconazole, direct MDZ N-glucuronidation may partly compensate the decrease in MDZ metabolic clearance caused by the addition of the inhibitor, thus potentially leading to underestimation, at least in vitro, of the extent of DDI.", 
    "17": "We determined if cutaneous hyperalgesia and pain-induced c-Fos overexpression in the spinal cord produced by repeated forced swimming (FS) stress in the rat were related to changes in GABA neurotransmission by studying spinal release of GABA and the effect of positive modulation of GABA-A receptors with diazepam. Male rats were daily submitted to 10-20 min of either forced swimming or sham swimming (SS) for 3 consecutive days. Two days later, spinal GABA release was estimated by in vivo microdialysis. In other set of rats, either diazepam (2 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline was administered 1h before either SS or FS and inflammatory nociception was assessed with the formalin test; it was followed by removal of lumbar spinal cords for c-Fos immunocytochemistry. Basal and pain-evoked release of GABA in the spinal cord was lower in FS rats than in SS rats. In contrast, pain scores during formalin test late phase and pain-induced c-Fos expression in laminae I-VI of ipsilateral dorsal horn were significantly higher in FS rats than in SS rats. In FS rats, diazepam did not have effect on GABA release but reduced pain scores and overexpression of c-Fos whereas flumazenil (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), an antagonist of the benzodiazepine binding site, reversed these effects. When diazepam was given only 1h before the formalin test, it slightly but significantly reduced pain scores during late phase in FS rats but not in SS rats. In conclusion, stress-induced reduction in GABA-A receptor activation is involved in the development of FS stress-induced hyperalgesia.",

    "32": "The steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) is required for adrenal and gonadal steroidogenesis and for male sexual differentiation. StAR acts on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) to facilitate movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane to be converted to pregnenolone, the precursor of all steroid hormones. The mechanisms of the action of StAR remain unclear; the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, an OMM protein, appears to be involved, but the identity of OMM proteins that interact with StAR remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylated StAR interacts with voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) on the OMM, which then facilitates processing of the 37-kDa phospho-StAR to the 32-kDa intermediate. In the absence of VDAC1, phospho-StAR is degraded by cysteine proteases prior to mitochondrial import. Phosphorylation of StAR by protein kinase A requires phosphate carrier protein on the OMM, which appears to interact with StAR before it interacts with VDAC1. VDAC1 and phosphate carrier protein are the first OMM proteins shown to contact StAR.", 
    "33": "Since the discovery that certain flavonoids (namely flavones) specifically recognise the central BDZ receptors, several efforts have been made to identify naturally occurring GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine binding site ligands. Flavonoid derivatives with a flavone-like structure such as apigenin, chrysin and wogonin have been reported for their anxiolytic-like activity in different animal models of anxiety. Luteolin (3',4',5,7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a widespread flavonoid aglycon that was reported as devoid of specific affinity for benzodiazepine receptor (BDZ-R) binding site, but its psychopharmacological activity is presently unknown. Considering (1) the close structural similarity with other active flavones, (2) the activity of some of its glycosilated derivatives and (3) the complexity of flavonoid effects in the central nervous system, luteolin was submitted to a battery of tests designed to evaluate its possible activity upon the CNS and its ability to interact with the BDZ-receptor binding sites was also analysed. Luteolin apparently has CNS activity with anxiolytic-like effects despite the low affinity for the BDZ-R shown in vitro. Our findings suggest a possible interaction with other neurotransmitter systems but we cannot rule out the possibility that luteolin's metabolites might show a higher affinity for the BDZ-R in vivo, thus eliciting the evident anxiolytic-like effects through a GABAergic mechanism.", 
    "34": "The typical antipsychotics chlorpromazine (CPZ) and trifluoperazine (TFP) increase the mean molecular area (mma) of acidic, but not neutral, glycerophospholipids in monolayers at pH 7.36 measured by the Langmuir technique. The atypical antipsychotic olanzapine (OLP(1)) is structurally similar to TFP. We have therefore studied the effects of OLP on glycerophospholipid monolayers and in comparison with CPZ. Olanzapine (10 microM, in subphase, pH 7.36) influenced the isotherms (surface pressure versus mma) in monolayers of the neutral dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and the acidic dipalmitoyl phosphatidylserine (DPPS) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylserine (POPS) in the increasing order of mma: DPPS<DPPC<POPS at both lower and higher temperature. Thus, presence of an unsaturated acyl in PS increased the drug-induced effect on mma. The mma in the absence of drugs was lower at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures. OLP affected mma to a greater extent than CPZ, and caused the greatest interaction at surface pressure of 30 mN/m at higher temperatures. In contrast, CPZ gave the largest effect in the monolayers at surface pressure 30 mN/m at lower temperatures. CPZ did not alter the isotherms of DPPC, at lower or higher temperature, and only affected the packing of the DPPS and POPS monolayers. In contrast, OLP altered the isotherms of DPPC. It is suggested that the drugs affect the monolayer packing by intercalating between the glycerophospholipid molecules. Since CPZ has major side effects, while OLP has few, this may indicate that there is poor correlation between side effects and effects of the drugs on phospholipid monolayers.", 
    "35": "The pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines (PBDs) are a class of well-studied DNA-interactive agents with a potential for use in the treatment of cancer. The clinical utility of these molecules is limited because of the lack of selectivity for tumor tissues, high reactivity of the pharmacophoric imine functionality, low water solubility, and stability. To address the shortcomings, especially the lack of selectivity, associated with the molecules, two new beta-galactoside prodrugs of PBDs have been synthesized and evaluated for their potential use in selective therapy of solid tumors by ADEPT and PMT protocols. The preliminary studies reveal the prodrugs to be much less toxic compared to the parent moieties. These prodrugs are activated by E. coli beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) to form the active cytotoxic moiety signifying their utility in ADEPT of cancer. One of the significant outcomes of the present study is the toxification of the prodrug 1 a by the endogenous beta-galactosidase of human liver cancer cells (Hep G2) to form the cytotoxic moiety, enabling selective therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Another important property of these molecules is their enhanced water solubility and stability, which are essential for a molecule to be an effective drug.",

Traumatic brain injury was negatively associated with factual memory (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.58; P = 0.002). Longer duration of opiates/benzodiazepines was associated with delusional memory (odds ratio, 4.98; 95% CI, 1.3-20.0; P = 0.023). Post-traumatic stress scores were higher in children reporting delusional memories (adjusted difference, 3.0; 95% CI, 0.06-5.9; P = 0.045) when illness severity and emergency status were controlled for. Factual memory was not significantly associated with post-traumatic stress.",

    "65": "An overactivation of the Th1 activity in schizophrenia had been described. Interleukin-12 (IL-12), a proinflammatory cytokine, plays a key role in the regulation of the Th1 response. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of first and second generation antipsychotic drugs on IL-12 production during the acute phase of the illness and its association with clinical features. Participants comprised 56 drug-na\u00efve first episode psychotic patients and 28 healthy volunteers. Patients were initially randomly assigned to risperidone (n=16), olanzapine (n=20) or haloperidol (n=20); subject were maintained on the same medication throughout the study. Clinical assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6 weeks. IL-12 plasma levels were assessed at baseline and after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. IL-12 haplotypes were also analysed. Patients showed higher IL-12 plasma levels at baseline compared with controls, and had a significant increase in IL-12 plasma level after 6 weeks of antipsychotic treatment. No significant differences in IL-12 level increase were found among the three antipsychotic treatments. IL-12 plasma levels at week 6 were not significantly associated with the severity of psychopathology at week 6. Thus, patients with a first episode of psychosis have inflammatory-like immunological function during early phases of the illness that it is independent of the antipsychotic treatment used.", 
    "66": "Pharmaceuticals are continuously dispersed into the environment, as a result of human and veterinary use, and have become a relevant environmental concern. In the present study, the acute toxicity of three therapeutic agents (diazepam, clofibrate, and clofibric acid) and a detergent, sodium dodecylsulphate (SDS), to the euryhaline fish Gambusia holbrooki was evaluated. Special attention was devoted to oxidative stress parameters. G. holbrooki males, captured in the estuary of the Minho River (NW Portugal), were exposed for 96 h to the selected compounds. The following oxidative stress biomarkers were evaluated in gills and liver tissues: reduced and oxidised glutathione, lipid peroxidation, and several antioxidant enzymes, namely (1) total and selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (GPx), (2) glutathione reductase (GRed), (3) copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-ZnSOD) and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and (4) glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs). In the particular case of diazepam, swimming behaviour was also evaluated. The obtained results indicate an overall diminished oxidative stress response caused by SDS and diazepam. Oxidative-based alterations were observed after exposure to clofibrate and clofibric acid, with modifications of several enzymatic activities. Diazepam caused evident behavioural changes: animals showed dark pigmentation and also abnormal postures, namely lethargy and anomalous movement.",

    "71": "The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of pluronic F68 block copolymer on the P-gp-mediated transport of celiprolol (CEL) and CYP3A4-mediated formation of midazolam (MDZ) metabolite 1'-hydroxymidazolam. Over a range from 0.03 to 0.3%, pluronic F68 increased apical-to-basolateral permeability (AP-BL) and decreased basolateral-to-apical permeability (BL-AP) of the P-gp substrate CEL in Caco-2 cell monolayer with the efflux ratio values of 2.8+/-0.3 (0.03%), 2.6+/-0.3 (0.1%), 2.3+/-0.2 (0.3%), respectively. CEL transport across the intestinal mucosa in the everted gut sac model was also enhanced by the P-gp inhibitor verapamil and the pharmaceutical excipient pluronic F68. Furthermore, CYP3A4-catalyzed formation of 1'-hydroxymidazolam was inhibited by pluronic F68 with IC(50) and K(i) values of 0.11 and 0.16 mg/ml, respectively. The results indicate that pluronic F68 is a potent in vitro inhibitor of both P-gp and CYP3A4, suggesting a potential for pluronic F68 to modify the pharmacokinetics of orally administered drugs that are P-gp and/or CYP3A4 substrates in vivo.", 
    "72": "Acetylcholine may play a role in cell activation and airway inflammation. We evaluated the levels of both mRNA and protein of muscarinic M(1), M(2), M(3) receptors in human bronchial epithelial cell line (16HBE). 16HBE cells were also stimulated with acetylcholine and extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) and NFkB pathway activation as well as the IL-8 release was assessed in the presence or absence of the inhibitor of Protein-kinase (PKC) (GF109203X), of the inhibitor of mitogenic activated protein-kinase kinase (MAPKK) (PDO9805), of the inhibitor of kinaseB-alpha phosphorilation (pIkBalpha) (BAY11-7082), and of muscarinic receptor antagonists tiotropium bromide, 4-Diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), telenzepine, gallamine. Additionally, we tested the IL-8-mediated neutrophil chemotactic activity of 16HBE supernatants stimulated with acetylcholine in the presence or absence of tiotropium. 16HBE cells expressed both protein and mRNA for muscarinic M(3), M(2) and M(1) receptors with levels of muscarinic M(3) receptor>muscarinic M(1) receptor>muscarinic M(2) receptor. Acetylcholine (10 microM) significantly stimulated ERK1/2 and NFkB activation as well as IL-8 release in 16HBE cells when compared to basal values. Furthermore, while the use of tiotropium, 4-DAMP, GF109203X, PDO98059, BAY11-7082 completely abolished these events, the use of telenzepine and gallamine were only partially able to downregulate these effects. Additionally, acetylcholine-mediated IL-8 release from 16HBE cells significantly increased chemotaxis toward neutrophils and this effect was blocked by tiotropium. In conclusion, acetylcholine activates the release of IL-8 from 16HBE involving PKC, ERK1/2 and NFkB pathways via muscarinic receptors, suggesting that it is likely to contribute to IL-8 related neutrophilic inflammatory disorders in the airway. Thus, muscarinic antagonists may contribute to control inflammatory processes in airway diseases.", 
    "73": "Phospholipid bilayer interaction of olanzapine (OLZ), a thienobenzodiazepine derivative and an antipsychotic agent, has been studied with (13)C and (31)P solid-state NMR. A dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (60%)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (40%) bilayer (DPPC(60%)/POPS(40%)) with 50 wt.% H(2)O, with and without 10 mol% OLZ have been investigated. The results reveal that both the serine and the choline head groups are affected by OLZ interaction with the bilayer. The OLZ interaction with the serine and the choline head groups appears to be caused by electrostatic attraction to the serine head group carboxyl and repulsion of the choline head group positively charged nitrogen. (31)P MAS NMR experiments show the appearance of two new (31)P resonances both for the PS and the PC phosphorous in the presence of OLZ. Static (31)P NMR spectra demonstrate a decrease in chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) of the OLZ containing bilayer when in the liquid-crystalline phase and an increase in CSA when in the gel state.", 
    "74": "Recent in-vitro studies show that antipsychotic drugs increase lipid biosynthesis through changes in gene expression. Based on these finding we compared the expression of two central lipid biosynthesis genes, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), in whole blood of olanzapine-treated and unmedicated patients. Patients with psychotic disorders were consecutively selected from an ongoing, naturalistic study, and divided into two groups according to the following criteria: (1) strict monotherapy with olanzapine (n=19) or (2) no current medication (n=19). The groups were matched on gender, race and body mass index. Blood lipid levels were examined, and gene expression in whole blood was assessed with quantitative real-time PCR. Expression of FASN (p=0.003) and SCD (p=0.002) was significantly up-regulated in olanzapine-treated compared to unmedicated patients. Transcriptional activation of lipid biosynthesis genes in peripheral blood cells of olanzapine-treated patients suggests a direct lipogenic action of antipsychotic drugs, which may be related to metabolic adverse effects.", 
    "75": "There is only a paucity of studies concerning the pharmacological treatment of personality disorders per se. On the other hand the clinical use of medication in these conditions is quite high, although there is no effective psychopharmacological treatment of distinct personality disorders. The psychopharmacological treatment of patients suffering from a personality disorder focuses on distinct symptoms and its comorbidity. Some symptoms could also be associated with other disorders like depression or psychosis, which often makes an exact differentiation of these disorders and a personality disorder difficult. Since symptoms of personality disorders are ego-syntonic, chronic and very often dependent on psychosocial factors, it is unlikely that a solely psychopharmacological treatment will be successful in most patients with a personality disorder. However, severe syndromes like depressive, impulsive, aggressive, dissociative, anxious or psychotic features may render a pharmacotherapy necessary. For the treatment of depressive syndromes or impulsivity a medical therapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors, for the treatment of psychotic syndromes a medication with atypical antipsychotics is recommended. Impulsive or aggressive behaviour could be treated with mood stabilizers as well. Furthermore, there are indications for the use of alpha2-agonists, micro-opiate-antagonists and omega-3 fatty acid. The general use of benzodiazepines should be avoided as well as polypragmasy. Advantages versus potential damage of a high dose pharmacotherapy should be carefully weighed against each other. This article gives an overview over the today's most common psychopharmacological treatment possibilities in patients with a personality disorder.", 
    "76": "We encountered a case where treatment with olanzapine resulted in the elevation of serum triglyceride level despite the absence of weight gain and abnormal glucose metabolism. Elevation in serum triglyceride levels as seen in non-obese individuals does not fall under the category of metabolic syndrome which has recently been highlighted as an adverse reaction to second-generation antipsychotics. In some individuals treated with antipsychotics, metabolic abnormalities develop with an initial sign of elevated serum triglyceride levels instead of weight gain.", 
    "77": "This study examined the comparative anticancer effects of flavonoids and diazepam in the cultured cancer cells. In the SNU-C4 colorectal and MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma cells, apigenin and fisetin, flavonoids, and diazepam inhibited cancer cell survival concentration and incubation-time dependently. Diazepam consistently inhibited FAS activity, a known anticancer mechanism of flavonoids, in a concentration dependent manner. Unlike diazepam, in highly aggressive breast MDA-MB-231 cells known to have a nuclear/perinuclear located PBR, PK11195, a specific PBR ligand enhanced the proliferation of cells, and the proliferative effect of PK11195 was reversed by an addition of lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Diazepam- and flavonoids-induced cytotoxic activity in both cancer cell lines was not reduced by the addition of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic agent. Like flavonoids, diazepam inhibited the release of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) into supernatants of cultured in the SNU-C4 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, this study provided in vitro information on the safe use of sedative in oncologic patients.",

At approximately day 30, (11)C-flumazenil (FMZ), a potential positron emission tomography marker of selective neuronal loss, and structural magnetic resonance-based infarct mapping were obtained, and the brain was perfused-fixed. Reduced FMZ binding in noninfarcted cortical middle cerebral artery areas was searched voxel-wise, and specific binding was assessed using compartmental modeling of FMZ time-activity curves.", 
    "80": "Visual inspection revealed reduced late FMZ uptake in the affected cortical territory, extending well beyond the infarct. Accordingly, the incidence of selected voxels was greater than chance, documenting mildly but significantly reduced FMZ uptake and specific binding. Serial (15)O positron emission tomography revealed moderately severe acute ischemia followed by reperfusion. Histopathology documented only mild neuronal changes in or near the affected areas.", 
    "81": "We document moderate but definite late FMZ binding decrements in noninfarcted cortical areas in the baboon, consistent with previous rat and human studies. These were acutely characterized by moderate ischemia followed by reperfusion, consistent with neuronal damage from ischemic or reperfusion injury in the salvaged at-risk tissue. Only mild histopathological changes subtended these FMZ alterations suggesting subtle processes such as isolated dendrite or synapse loss. Whether these changes impact on clinical outcome deserves studying because they may be targeted by specific neuroprotection.", 
    "82": "A diazepam 10-mg autoinjector was evaluated in bioequivalence and dose proportionality studies; both involved 24 young, healthy subjects and used randomized, open-label, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover designs with a 3-week washout period between treatments. The bioequivalence study compared a single diazepam 10-mg autoinjector with a conventional needle and syringe containing 10 mg of diazepam injectable. The dose proportionality study compared the pharmacokinetics of a single diazepam 10-mg autoinjector with that of 2 diazepam 10-mg autoinjectors given simultaneously (20 mg). Injections were intramuscular in the midanterolateral thigh in both studies. The studies showed that the diazepam autoinjector produced consistent plasma diazepam levels, with a rapid onset of absorption. The diazepam 10-mg autoinjector given intramuscularly was bioequivalent to a conventional syringe containing diazepam 10 mg. A single (10-mg) autoinjector and 2 (20-mg) diazepam autoinjectors administered simultaneously produced plasma diazepam concentrations that were essentially dose proportional.",

    "84": "A total of 219,504 episodes of antipsychotic drug therapy initiated during the period from 2000 to 2002 were identified using data from the California Medicaid program. Four types of episodes were analyzed based on the patient's drug use history as far back as 1994: restarting therapy after a break in therapy using the same drug used in the preceding episode; switching therapy after a break in treatment using a different medication; switching therapy without a break in therapy; and augmentation. Health-care use patterns over a 1-year post-treatment period were analyzed using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, Cox proportional hazards models, and logistic regression.", 
    "85": "The impact of atypical antipsychotics on health-care use in the first post-treatment year varies by episode type. Patients switching to atypical medications generally cost significantly more than similar patients switching to a conventional antipsychotic. Olanzapine and risperidone, however, were associated with reductions in total costs relative to conventional antipsychotics when used in restart and augmentation episodes. Differences across all three second-generation antipsychotics were relatively small.", 
    "86": "Small differences across the atypical antipsychotics suggest that these drugs are interchangeable, raising the question of whether drug costs could be reduced through selectively contracting for a preferred drug. Potential savings may be limited by several factors. First, most episodes of treatment are restart episodes. Switching these patients to a preferred drug may have clinical risk. Second, patients with schizophrenia switch and augment therapies frequently, thus quickly reducing the population of patients who could be effectively treated with a single preferred drug.", 
    "87": "A disordered regulation of neuroactive steroids release in response to acute stress could induce GABAergic dysfunctions underlying anxiety disorders.", 
    "88": "First, we conducted studies indicating that a short immobilization stress in anxious Balb/cByJ mice produced an anticonvulsive effect. Second, the effects of different positive allosteric modulators (etifoxine, progesterone, clonazepam, and allopregnanolone) of GABA A receptors were compared in a mouse model mimicking the disruption of the acute stress-induced neuroactive steroids release with finasteride (types I and II 5alpha-reductase inhibitor).", 
    "89": "The acute stress-induced anticonvulsive effect, expressed by the threshold dose of t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate-producing clonic seizures, was time-dependent. The extent of the enhancement of acute stress-induced anticonvulsive effect was lowered in the presence of finasteride. The same effect was observed with PK11195, which behaves as an antagonist of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor in the dose range used in this study. Picrotoxin reduced the acute stress anticonvulsive effect, proving that this effect operates through the GABA A receptor. Contrary to progesterone (up to 30 mg/kg), etifoxine (50 mg/kg), allopregnanolone (10 mg/kg), and clonazepam (10 microg/kg) inhibited the finasteride effect in stressed animals. The effect of etifoxine was blocked in the presence of finasteride and picrotoxin combined in stressed animals.", 
    "90": "These findings support the hypothesis suggesting an involvement of neuroactive steroids in the anticonvulsive effect of restraint stress. The dual and complementary mechanisms of action of etifoxine (directly on the GABA A receptor and indirectly via the neuroactive steroids) may represent a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of various anxiety disorders with abnormal production of neuroactive steroids.", 
    "91": "The purpose of the present study was to shed light on the physiology underlying somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) by means of pharmacological manipulation with the GABA A agonist lorazepam and paired-pulse stimulation. SEFs were recorded from the primary (SI) and secondary (SII) somatosensory cortices following median nerve stimulation. Responses were obtained to single stimuli every 2 s and to paired stimuli with interpulse intervals (IPIs) of 20 ms and 100 ms. Recordings were performed in 2 sessions, once after the intravenous injection of lorazepam and once after the injection of placebo. The underlying neural generators of the response components were modelled with single equivalent current dipoles (ECDs). In the single-stimulus condition, lorazepam slightly increased the ECD strength of the 1st excitatory deflection (N20m) from the contralateral SI and reduced the strengths of the following P35m, P60m and N140m deflections from the contralateral SI and the response from the ipsilateral SII. Under placebo, paired-pulse stimulation with the IPI of 20 ms diminished all SEF components compared with single-pulse stimulation. At the IPI of 100 ms, the N20m and the P60m deflections from SI had recovered to nearly baseline levels, being consistent with recovery cycles of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In contrast, the P35m and N140m, as well as the SII deflections, did not recover at 100 ms. Lorazepam had no effect on the paired-pulse depression (PPD) or recovery thereof for the N20m deflection. The attenuation of the P35m deflection by lorazepam and its lack of recovery in the 100-ms paired-pulse condition are expected behaviours of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in intracellular recordings, thus lending further support to our previous suggestion that P35m largely represents IPSPs. The lack of PPD modulation of N20m by lorazepam suggests that paired-pulse depression of the first cortical excitatory response (N20m) may be caused by mechanisms other than GABA A receptor-mediated inhibition.", 
    "92": "The dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP1) and neuregulin 1 (NRG1) genes have been related to schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) by several whole-genome linkage and associations studies. Few expression studies in post-mortem brains have also reported a lower or a higher expression of DTNBP1 and NRG1, respectively, in SZ. Since the difficulty to access post-mortem brains, we evaluated RNA expression of DTNBP1 and NRG1 in immortalized lymphocytes of SZ patients and unrelated-family controls. An antipsychotic stimulation was also used to challenge the genetic background of the subjects and enhance differential expression. Immortalized lymphocytes of twelve SZ and twelve controls were grown individually in the presence or not of the antipsychotic olanzapine (Zyprexa; EliLilly). RNA was extracted and pooled in four groups of three SZ and four groups of three controls, and used to probe Agilent 18K microchips. Mean gene expression values were contrasted between SZ and control groups using a T-test. For DTNBP1, RNA expression was lower in SZ than in controls before (-28%; p=0.02) and after (-30%; p=0.01) olanzapine stimulation. Similarly, NRG1 GGF2 isoform showed a lower expression in SZ before (-29%; p=0.04) and after (-33%; p=0.02) olanzapine stimulation. In contrast, NRG1 GGF isoform showed no significant difference between SZ and controls (-7%; p=0.61, +3%; p=0.86, respectively), but was slightly repressed by olanzapine in controls (-8%; p=0.008) but not in SZ (+1%; p=0.91). These results are in agreement with those observed in post-mortem brain when the isoforms involved are considered.", 
    "93": "Temperament and character were evaluated in patients with panic disorder (PD) before and after 1 year of pharmacological therapy to verify whether personality characteristics change after treatment. Therefore, 65 PD patients and 71 healthy subjects participated in the study. All subjects were evaluated with the SCID-IV, the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), the SCL-90, the Ham-A and the Ham-D. Patients were treated with paroxetine or citalopram. The TCI was re-administered to the patients at the end of the study. At the end of the study, complete remission was achieved by 31 patients (R), whereas symptoms did not disappear in the remaining 34 patients (NR). Before treatment, NR patients showed higher levels of harm avoidance (HA) and lower levels of persistence (P), self-directedness (SD) and cooperativeness (C) than healthy controls. Only HA levels were higher than normal in R, although they were significantly lower in R than in NR patients. These differences persisted after treatment. However, in NR patients the levels of SD and C worsened, whereas the difference between R patients and controls in HA levels (higher in R patients than in controls) disappeared after controlling the effect of residual phobic anxiety (higher than normal in R patients). Our data suggest that the high levels of HA found after remission may depend on the subsyndromal residual phobic symptoms, observed in R patients. Moreover, the persistence of anxious symptoms may have worsened the low levels of SD and C observed before treatment in patients who did not achieve remission.",

The condition is characterized by destructive weight loss behaviours and a refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height. AN often develops in adolescence and is a predominantly female disorder. Treatment for AN typically involves medical, nutritional and psychological interventions. Pharmacotherapy is also often used; however, the literature on the effectiveness of these drugs in a pediatric population is very limited. Olanzapine, which is an 'atypical' antipsychotic, is becoming more widespread in the treatment of AN. Olanzapine is hypothesized to facilitate weight gain, while decreasing levels of agitation and decreasing resistance to treatment in young women with AN.

Patients assigned to receive olanzapine will start at a low dose of 1.25 mg/day for three days, followed by 2.5 mg/day for four days, 5 mg/day for one week, then 7.5 mg/day (the target dose chosen) for 10 weeks. After 10 weeks at 7.5 mg the medication will be tapered and discontinued over a period of two weeks.

    "113": "Etomidate is a popular anaesthetic induction agent, but it frequently causes myoclonic movements. Although both benzodiazepines and opioids reduce myoclonus, there has been no comparative study between these agents. Thus, we conducted a prospective, randomized study to compare midazolam and remifentanil as pre-treatment agents for reducing etomidate-induced myoclonus in 90 adults undergoing surgery. Patients were pre-treated before the etomidate injection, either with saline (Group C), midazolam 0.5 mg/kg (Group M) or remifentanil 1 microg/kg (Group R). Both Groups M and R showed a significantly lower incidence of myoclonus compared with Group C (17%, 17% and 77%, respectively). The incidence of myoclonus was not significantly different between Groups M and R, but 10% (n = 10) of the patients in Group R experienced remifentanil-related side-effects. We conclude that midazolam is probably a better choice than remifentanil for reducing etomidate-induced myoclonus during anaesthesia induction.",

The reaction proceeds through the N-benzylation and highly regioselective ring-opening reaction of aziridine by bromide anion followed by Et3N-mediated intramolecular nucleophilic displacement of the bromide by the amide nitrogen. The easy availability of starting materials, simple and convenient synthetic procedure, and formation of functionalized 1,4-benzodiazepine scaffold ready for further chemical manipulations render this strategy useful in synthetic and medicinal chemistry.", 
    "123": "The inversion of four 1,4-benzodiazepines was investigated with the ab initio \"replica path method\" with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The reaction path constructed with this method for the inversion provides an approximate transition state (TS) geometry, which, upon further TS optimization, leads to the TS geometry characterized by a single vibrational frequency. 1,4-Benzodiazepines lacking a 5-phenyl ring have a single reaction path for the inversion with Cs symmetry at the TS. In contrast, the inversion of benzodiazepines with a 5-phenyl ring, such as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor ligand 4'-chlorodiazepam (Ro5-4864) and its N1-desmethyl analog (Ro5-2752), can proceed through multiple reaction paths having a TS with or without Cs symmetry. Notably, the replica path method found a path connecting two asymmetric TSs of 4'-chlorodiazepam via a symmetrical TS, suggesting that these inversion paths can be readily crossed from one to another. The stabilization energies gained by 4'-chlorodiazepam and its N1-desmethyl analog from the breaking of Cs symmetry at the TS were calculated to be 0.10 and 0.07 kcal/mol, respectively. The origin of the broken symmetry of Cs was traced to the coupling of the puckering of the diazepine ring with the rotation of the chlorophenyl ring. These results show the advantages of the replica path method for locating the TSs as well as for constructing the reaction paths for the inversion of 1,4-benzodiazepines.", 
    "124": "The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway mediates neuronal plasticity in the CNS. The mood stabilizers lithium and valproate activate the ERK pathway in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus and potentiate ERK pathway-mediated neurite growth, neuronal survival and hippocampal neurogenesis. Here, we examined the role of the ERK pathway in behavioral plasticity related to facets of bipolar disorder. Mice with ERK1 ablation acquired reduced phosphorylation of RSK1, an ERK substrate, in prefrontal cortex and striatum, but not in hippocampus or cerebellum, indicating the ablation-induced brain region-specific ERK signaling deficits. ERK1 ablation produced a behavioral excitement profile similar to that induced by psychostimulants. The profile is characterized by hyperactivity, enhanced goal-directed activity and increased pleasure-related activity with potential harmful consequence. ERK1-ablated mice were hyperactive in multiple tests and resistant to behavioral despair in the forced swim test. These mice displayed more home-cage voluntary wheel running activities, rearings in a large arena and open-arm visits in an elevated plus maze. Treatments with valproate and olanzapine, but not lithium reduced baseline activities in ERK1-ablated mice. All three treatments attenuated amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in ablated mice. These data indicate a profound involvement of ERK1 signaling in behavioral excitement and in the behavioral action of antimanic agents. The extent to which ERK pathway perturbation contributes to the susceptibility, mood switch mechanism(s) and symptom pathophysiology of bipolar disorder requires further investigation. Whether there is a shared mechanism through which mood stabilizers produce their clinical actions on mood, thought and behavioral symptoms of mania also requires further investigation.",

However, RBD in patients with a pure pontine infarction has been rarely reported. A 68-year-old man had a two-month history of violent behavior during sleep. His nocturnal behavior was screaming, thrashing of arms, punching or kicking his spouse, and falling out of bed associated with nightmares of being attacked by what he described as, \"terrible animals frightening me.\" No remarkable neurological signs were found. Brain MRI was performed on this patient and it revealed a lacunar ischemic infarct in the right paramedian pons. On the nocturnal polysomnography (PSG), there was phasic submental and limb electromyographic (EMG) tone and an absence of electroencephalographic (EEG) epileptiform activity during REM sleep. Hence, this patient was diagnosed with pontine infarction and RBD. Treatment with clonazepam 0.25mg nightly resulted in the disappearance of nocturnal events. This case with right pontine tegmental ischemic lesion provides evidence that the unilateral pontine lesion by itself is sufficient to cause RBD.",

Of the elderly receiving antipsychotic agents, 50.39% received atypical agents and 51.88% received typical agents during the study period. The most frequently used atypical agents were risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that need (perceived mental health, p < 0.01) and enabling (time, p < 0.01) factors were significantly associated with atypical antipsychotic use after controlling for predisposing factors.

Because it was known from the literature that the half-life of midazolam can increase at high dosage, the kinetics of midazolam (MDZ), 1'-hydroxymidazolam, and 4-hydroxymidazolam were assessed at steady state (dosage 1 mg/min) and after stopping treatment. Total body clearance of MDZ (33 L/kg) and intrinsic hepatic clearance (19 mL/min/kg) at steady state were both five to 10 times higher than after normal therapeutic doses, demonstrating hepatic cytochrome (CYP) 3A induction. Despite the high body clearance, the half-life of MDZ was in the range of 24 hours, approximately 10 times higher than after normal therapeutic doses. The volume of distribution at steady state was 33 L/kg, approximately 50 times higher than after normal therapeutic doses. The free fraction of MDZ was 58% at steady state, much higher than the 3% to 6% at normal therapeutic doses. The kinetics of intravenous MDZ is strongly dependent on its dose and on hepatic CYP3A activity. Even in patients with hepatic CYP3A induction, the half-life of MDZ increases with high doses as a result of a rise in its volume of distribution, which is a consequence of an increase in the free fraction of MDZ.",

Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of OLZ is recommended but is based on known reference ranges derived from intraindividual and interindividual variability measurements. There have been few studies on the interindividual variability of OLZ serum concentrations in adolescents, and no data on intraindividual variability are available. This study explored the intraindividual variability of OLZ serum concentrations in 85 patients attending a child and adolescent psychiatric hospital (age at first assessment: mean +/- SD, 16.7 +/- 2.0; range, 10.3-20.6 years; 54 male, 31 female). A total of 577 steady-state OLZ serum concentrations (2 to 24 measurements per patient; mean, 6.8, and SD, +/-5.4) were measured, using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Intraindividual variability of dose-corrected OLZ serum concentrations was 1.04- to 10.7-fold. The intraindividual variabilities of the metabolites OLZ N-desmethyl (DMO) and OLZ 2-hydroxymethyl (2OH) were 1.08- to 83.2-fold and 1.0- to 47-fold, respectively. Intraindividual variability of OLZ (DMO; 2OH) serum concentration accounted for 47% (89.8%, 74.9%) of total variance. OLZ daily dose, number of co-medications, body mass index (BMI), age, and post-dose interval had a significant influence on the intraindividual variability of dose-corrected OLZ serum concentrations (all P < 0.001). The serum concentrations of OLZ and OLZ metabolites in adolescents show high intraindividual variability, potentially limiting the value of TDM. It is recommended that repeated serum concentration measurements are made in individuals treated with OLZ, in order to obtain a more precise estimate of the intraindividual variability of serum concentrations.", 
    "146": "The monitoring of plasma olanzapine concentrations has been found to be an important and useful tool for optimizing psychiatric treatment. The present study investigated the effect that clinical factors, such as smoking and age, and functional polymorphisms of UGT1A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2D6 genes have on plasma olanzapine concentration, as well as the effects of plasma olanzapine concentrations on Japanese schizophrenic patients' clinical symptoms. The subjects included 51 chronic schizophrenic patients whose symptoms were not controlled with chronic conventional antipsychotics and therefore were switched to olanzapine. Male smokers had a significantly lower olanzapine concentration-dose ratio and olanzapine/4'-N-desmethyl olanzapine ratio (which reflects CYP1A2 activity) than male nonsmokers and female nonsmokers. The results of a 2-way analysis of covariance showed that smoking had the main effect, rather than gender or age. The functional gene polymorphisms that were studied had no effect on the plasma olanzapine and metabolite concentrations. An improved total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was not correlated with the plasma olanzapine concentration, but individual BPRS scores related to improvement of suspiciousness, hallucinations, and blunted affect were significantly correlated with plasma olanzapine concentration. Clinical factors, especially smoking, were more important modulators of olanzapine metabolism than the functional genotypes. Long-term olanzapine treatment with adequate plasma olanzapine concentrations could be more effective in improving some symptoms than treatment with conventional antipsychotics.", 
    "147": "Abnormalities in serum cholesterol levels of patients with mood disorders have been identified in epidemiological studies. However, evidence for an influence of dietary cholesterol on behavioral models is poor. Here, we investigated the behavioral changes of Wistar male rats fed a 2% cholesterol-enriched diet for 2 months in experimental models of depression and anxiety, such as the forced swim test (FST) paradigm and the novelty-induced grooming sampling test (NGT). The correlation between behavioral depression and impaired cognitive capacity was also examined testing rats in the Morris water maze (MWM) task one day after the FST. Different groups of rats fed various dietary regimens, were subjected to acute or repeated treatment (14 days) with clomipramine hydrochloride (50 or 25 mg/kg), diazepam (1 mg/kg) or with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) antagonist, isoquinoline PK11195 (1 mg/kg) injected intraperitoneally (i.p.). Rats fed the cholesterol-enriched diet showed a significant decrease of grooming score in the NGT and of immobility time in the FST in comparison to animals fed a standard diet. Furthermore, the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of diazepam and clomipramine were not affected by the different diets. Only after repeated treatment, PK11195 impaired the performance of animals fed a standard diet in the FST, and exhibited an anxiolytic-like profile in animals fed either the cholesterol-enriched or the standard diet. The improved performance in the FST was followed by a better learning performance in the acquisition phase of the MWM. These results suggest that effects of cholesterol-enriched diet on the behavioral reaction of rats in experimental models of mild stress may involve PBRs. They deserve attention in order to clarify the clinical correlation between plasma cholesterol levels and mood disorders in humans.",

Since April 2004, he has experienced vertigo spells with right-sided tinnitus a few times per month that are intractable to conventional medical therapy. After four months, tympanic tube insertion was preformed in the right tympanic membrane. Intratympanic injection of dexamethasone was ineffective. He refused Meniett therapy and intratympanic gentamicin injection. In addition to his vertigo spells, he suffered from insomnia, tinnitus, and anxiety. Tranquilizers such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants such as serotonin selective re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) failed to stop the vertigo and only slightly improved his insomnia. In December 2006, the patient began psychological counseling with a psychotherapist. After brief psychological counseling along with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), he began AT. He diligently and regularly continued his AT training in his home according to a written timetable. His insomnia, tinnitus, and vertigo spells disappeared within a few weeks after only four psychotherapy sessions. In order to master the six standard formulas of AT, he underwent two more sessions. Thereafter, he underwent follow-up for 9 months with no additional treatment. He is now free from drugs, including tranquilizers, and has continued AT. No additional treatment was performed.

    "152": "Long-term use of benzodiazepines as hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants and muscle relaxing drugs is jeopardized by adverse effects on memory, addictive properties, and development of tolerance. Major efforts have gone into developing 'benzodiazepine-like' drugs that are more selective in their therapeutic effect, have additional uses and/or lack the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. The reviewed prototype patent exemplifies such efforts. Newer drugs are thought to act selectively on one of the two neuronal benzodiazepine receptors, on the astrocytic mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor and/or on GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor complexes displaying specific subunits. It is overlooked that astrocytes also express benzodiazepine receptors that enhance depolarization-mediated entry of Ca(2+) by interacting with membrane-associated GABA(A)-like receptors, mediating depolarization because of a high Cl(-) concentration within astrocytes. The resulting increase in free cytosolic Ca(2+), which stimulates glycogenolysis, is inhibited not only by the 'peripheral-type\" benzodiazepine antagonist PK11195 but also by the 'neuronal' antagonist flumazenil. Increasing awareness of the role(s) of astrocytic Ca(2+) homeostasis and energy metabolism for CNS function suggests that activation of this receptor might contribute to both therapeutic and adverse effects of benzodiazepine-like drugs. This receptor should be kept in mind when developing and testing new drugs; in turn these drugs may help elucidating its functional role.",

Linear relationships were found between midazolam and four CYP3A substrates: simvastatin, buspirone, triazolam and eplerenone. Simvastatin and buspirone were consistently more sensitive than midazolam, independent of the inhibitor. Quantitative correlations of AUC ratios between four CYP3A inhibitors (fluconazole, erythromycin, verapamil, diltiazem) and ketoconazole (400 mg/day) were also uncovered. The average potencies of these inhibitors relative to ketoconazole were 27% for erythromycin, 17% for fluconazole and 19% for verapamil.",

The main drugs are anticholinergics that antagonize the effects of accumulated acetylcholine at the cholinergic synapses and cholinesterase reactivators (oximes) reactivating inhibited AChE. Anticonvulsants such as diazepam are also used to treat convulsions. Though there are experimental data on a good therapeutic effects of reactivators, some attempts to underestimate the role of reactivators as effective antidotes against OP poisoning have been made. Some arguments on the necessity of their administration following OP poisoning are discussed. Their distribution patterns and some metabolic and pharmacological effects are described with the aim to resolve the question on their effective use, possible repeated administration in the treatment of OP poisoning, their peripheral and central effects including questions on their penetration through the blood brain barrier as well as a possibility to achieve their effective concentration for AChE reactivation in the brain. Reactivation of cholinesterases in the peripheral and central nervous system is described and it is underlined its importance for the survival or death of the organism poisoned with OP. Metabolization and some other effects of oximes (not connected with AChE reactivation) are discussed (e.g. forming of the phosphonylated oxime, parasympatholytic action, hepatotoxicity, behavioral changes etc.). An universality of oximes able to reactivate AChE inhibited by all OP is questioned and therefore, needs of development of new oximes is underlined.",

A variety of precipitating events have been identified, but when it becomes a persistent problem, maladaptive patterns become established, thereby, perpetuating the sleep disturbance. Individuals with insomnia have impaired next-day functioning, which impacts their quality of life and places them at increased risk of motor vehicle accidents. Insomnia is commonly associated with chronic medical conditions, as well as an increased incidence of mental disorders. Despite considerable scientific advances in both the understanding and treatment, insomnia continues to be inadequately identified and treated, with < 15% of those with severe insomnia receiving appropriate treatment. The mainstay of treatment for insomnia is cognitive-behavioral therapy, along with judicious use of hypnotic agents.",

The cognitive correlates of this network have proven difficult to interrogate, but one hypothesis is that regions in the network process episodic memories and semantic knowledge integral to internally-generated mental activity. Here, we compare default-mode functional connectivity in the same group of subjects during rest and conscious sedation with midazolam, a state characterized by anterograde amnesia and a reduced level of consciousness. Although the DMN showed functional connectivity during both rest and conscious sedation, a direct comparison found that there was significantly reduced functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex during conscious sedation. These results confirm that low-frequency oscillations in the DMN persist and remain highly correlated even at reduced levels of consciousness. We hypothesize that focal reductions in DMN connectivity, as shown here in the posterior cingulate cortex, may represent a stable correlate of reduced consciousness.",

The aim of the study was to determine differences of the impaired glucose metabolism in the study groups as well as to point out to the possible mechanisms which bring to these differences. To the group of 15 schizophrenic patients treated with olanzapine, and group of 15 schizophrenic patients treated with risperidone and to 14 healthy volunteers oral glucose tolerancy test is applied in order to determine the level of the impaired glucose tolerance. In the group of the patients treated with olanzapine glucose tolerance was impaired in 33% of the patients, while in the group of the patients treated with risperidone in 20%. Impaired glucose tolerance mostly manifested as hyperinsulinemia. Authors discussed about possible mechanisms responsible for the impaired glucose tolerance in the patients treated with new antipsychotics. Authors conclude that insulin resistance is the main mechanism for development of the diabetes type II in the schizophrenic patients treated with antipsychotics. Insulin resistance is the result of the multiple effects of the antipsychotics, among which most common are: increased body mass and direct involvement of the antipsychotics in the glucose metabolism.", 
    "171": "Status Epilepticus (SE) is a potential and relatively common complication of epileptic seizures. Traditionally, SE was defined as 30 minutes of continuous seizure activity or a series of seizures without return to full consciousness between the seizures. As a practical rule, it is admitted that all patients arriving at the emergency room suffering from epileptic seizures could have SE and should be treated accordingly. It is well known that the longer an attack has lasted, the more difficult it is to control in the next 5 to 10 minutes. On the other hand, once an attack has lasted for over 5 to 10 minutes, it is unlikely to cease spontaneously. Ambulatory intervention should focus on this \"therapeutic interval\" in acute attacks with the use of first-line drugs such as the intramuscular, rectal, oral, and/or intranasal application of benzodiazepines (BZD). Treatment of SE is a medical emergency, which should include 3 priority objectives: (1) to stop the seizures; (2) to maintain internal homeostasis; and (3) to treat possible complications. Current consensus is that a BZD, notably lorazepam or diazepam, is the initial class of drug for the treatment of SE. Phenytoin, fosphenytoin, or valproate generally is agreed upon as the next drugs to be administered. Failure to respond to optimal BZD and phenytoin loading operationally defines refractory SE.",

Zolpidem (10 mg/kg) produced similar enhancements of the seizure threshold in adult and aged mice. The drug was more potent against PTZ- than against picrotoxin-induced seizures. Diazepam (1 mg/kg), which was taken for comparison, had a weaker effect on picrotoxin-induced tonic seizures in aged than in adult mice. Sedative effect of zolpidem (10 mg/kg), as assessed by its effect on the locomotor activity, was very strong in both groups of mice. The results suggest that sedative and antiseizure effects of zolpidem are not changed in aged mice.", 
    "177": "Amygdala opioids such as enkephalin appear to play some role in the control of anxiety and the anxiolytic effects of benzodiazepines, although the opioid receptor subtypes mediating such effects are unclear. This study compared the influences of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) on unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses in two models, the elevated plus maze, and the defensive burying test. The role of MORs in the anxiolytic actions of the benzodiazepine agonist diazepam was also examined using both models. Either the MOR agonist [D-Ala(2), NMe-Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAMGO), or the MOR antagonists Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2) (CTAP) or beta-funaltrexamine (FNA) were bilaterally infused into the CEA of rats before testing. The results show that microinjection of DAMGO in the CEA decreased open-arm time in the plus maze, whereas CTAP increased open-arm behaviors. In contrast, DAMGO injections in the CEA reduced burying behaviors and increased rearing following exposure to a predator odor, suggesting a shift in the behavioral response in this context. Amygdala injections of the MOR agonist DAMGO or the MOR antagonist CTAP failed to change the anxiolytic effects of diazepam in either test. Our results demonstrate that MOR activation in the central amygdala exerts distinctive effects in two different models of unconditioned fear or anxiety-like responses, and suggest that opioids may exert context-specific regulation of amygdalar output circuits and behavioral responses during exposure to potential threats (open arms of the maze) vs discrete threats (predator odor).", 
    "178": "Partial limbic seizures in rodents induced by pilocarpine progress from stages I-II (mouth and facial movements; head nodding) to stage III (forelimb clonus) and then progress rapidly to stages IV-V (generalized limbic seizures; rearing, and rearing with falling) followed by status epilepticus (SE). Although limbic seizures in rodents are terminated by benzodiazepines, a group of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A))-receptor positive modulators, significant pharmacoresistance to benzodiazepines develops within minutes during SE. The alterations of GABA(A)-receptor function and allosteric modulation during development of SE are poorly understood. We induced seizures in juvenile rats by administration of lithium followed by pilocarpine, and whole cell recordings of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were obtained from hippocampal dentate granule cells in brain slices. Compared with a sham-treated group, mIPSC amplitude was reduced and decay was accelerated at onset of the first occurrence of stage III (S3) seizures [S3(0)], resulting in a reduction in the total charge transfer at S3(0). Recovery of mIPSC amplitude and prolongation of mIPSC decay occurred 30 min after onset of S3 seizures [S3(30)]. The mIPSC frequency was not altered for S3(0) and S3(30) neurons compared with sham neurons. The net enhancement of total charge transfer by diazepam was smaller for S3(30) than that for sham and S3(0) neurons; however, the net reduction of total charge transfer by zinc was greater for S3(30) than that for sham and S3(0) neurons. These findings suggest that substantial plastic changes of GABA(A)-receptor function and allosteric modulation occur rapidly in neurons from juvenile animals during development of SE.",

Zolpidem at 1 micromol/L exerted a stronger prolongation on the decay time. A further experiment was performed on behaving rats.

Aripiprazole has recently received an indication from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjunctive treatment in unipolar, nonpsychotic depression, the first indication of its kind, after two double-blind trials; doses were slightly lower than those recommended for monotherapy in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Olanzapine and risperidone have several controlled clinical trials indicating the efficacy of both of these agents, generally at low doses. One trial of quetiapine suggested that it may not be effective in the treatment of unipolar, nonpsychotic depression. One open-label trial of ziprasidone indicated some efficacy.

    "223": "The acoustic startle response includes rapid muscular contractions elicited by loud sounds; it may be measured in humans as the electromyographic response of the orbicularis oculi muscle. Enhancement of this response during exposure to threat of electric shock (fear- potentiated startle) is a widely used model of human anxiety. A problem with the use of the startle reflex in studies of human anxiety is the aversiveness of startle-eliciting sounds, which may, in some subjects, exceed the aversiveness of the electric shock itself. We have recently found that the long-latency N1/P2 auditory-evoked potential elicited by loud sounds is subject to fear potentiation. However, it is not known whether N1/P2 potentials elicited by low-intensity sounds, which do not elicit the startle response, are also subject to fear potentiation. This study examined the susceptibility of the N1/P2 potential elicited by low-intensity sounds to fear potentiation, and the effect of the anxiolytic diazepam on the N1/P2 potential in the absence and presence of threat of electric shock. Fifteen male volunteers (18-43 years) participated in three sessions in which they received placebo, diazepam 5 mg and diazepam 10 mg according to a double-blind protocol. Sixty minutes after treatment, auditory-evoked potentials were elicited by 40 ms 1 kHz tones 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 dB[A] above a background of 70 dB[A]. Recording sessions consisted of eight alternating 2 min THREAT and SAFE blocks; unpredictable shocks (1.8 mA, 50 ms) were delivered to the subject's wrist in THREAT blocks (1-4 shocks per block). The amplitude of the N1/P2 potential increased monotonically as a function of stimulus intensity. The responses were significantly greater during THREAT blocks than during SAFE blocks (fear potentiation). Diazepam attenuated the responses in both the SAFE and THREAT conditions. Fear potentiation of the N1/P2 potential was significantly reduced by diazepam. Diazepam reduced subjective alertness and lowered critical flicker fusion frequency, a measure of arousal. The results suggest that fear potentiation of the N1/P2 potential is not simply a manifestation of the fear-potentiated startle response. The use of low-intensity stimuli may be advantageous in studies of fear potentiation in humans.", 
    "224": "Weight gain induced by some second-generation anti-psychotics such as olanzapine has emerged as a most debilitating side-effect. This study investigates whether co-administration with either ziprasidone or aripiprazole, which have little propensity to induce weight gain, can attenuate the hyperphagic effect of olanzapine. Female hooded-Lister rats (n=8 per group) were treated acutely with either vehicle, olanzapine (1 mg/kg), ziprasidone (1 mg/kg), aripiprazole (2 mg/kg) or olanzapine in combination with ziprasidone or aripiprazole and placed in automated locomotor activity (LMA) boxes with preweighed palatable mash. Food intake and LMA were measured for 60 min postdrug treatment. All olanzapine-treated groups demonstrated significant increases in food intake (P<0.001). This effect was attenuated following co-administration of olanzapine with either ziprasidone or aripiprazole (P<0.001), neither of which affected food intake alone. The lack of hyperphagia induced by aripiprazole and ziprasidone may reflect an inherent pharmacological mechanism preventing weight gain.", 
    "225": "A description of the illicit drug market in Denmark's second largest city is provided based upon the prevalence of narcotics and illicitly sold medicals during the years 2002 and 2003. The changes on the illicit drug market are described by comparing the results to a similar study conducted ten years earlier.", 
    "226": "The study is comprised of 469 cases of seized material by Aarhus Police during the period January 1st 2002-December 31st 2003. Additional information relating to the 341 persons charged is also included in the study.", 
    "227": "Heroine, cocaine and amphetamine were seized in 31%, 30% and 28% of the cases, respectively, and comprise the most frequently encountered hard drugs on the market. The prevalence of cocaine in Aarhus Police District has increased more than tenfold during the past ten years. The purity of the three drugs decreased significantly during the same period, although large variations in the quality of drugs were observed. Medicals were found in 16% of the seizures (containing 32 different active substances). The most frequent group of medicals was benzodiazepines, which made up a total of 74% of the medicals in the study. Anabolic steroids, ecstasy and methamphetamine were each found in 4% of the seizures. Men with an average age of 29.1 years comprised 92% of the persons charged in the study. Persons with a foreign nationality comprised 15% of the charged, while 25% had a birthplace outside Denmark.", 
    "228": "The prevalence of stimulants especially cocaine have increased significantly during the past ten years. Meanwhile the purity of the drugs has decreased. The benzodiazepines are still the most frequent group of medicals on the illicit market.", 
    "229": "1,2,3-Triazole based molecules are useful pharmacophores for several DNA-alkylating and cross-linking agents. A series of A/C8, C/C2 and A/C8-C/C2-linked 1,2,3-triazole-PBD conjugates have been synthesized by employing 'click' chemistry. These molecules have exhibited promising DNA-binding affinity and anticancer activity in selected human cancer cell lines."
