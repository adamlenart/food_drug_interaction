    "40": "Hypnotic drugs are intended to induce sedation and promote sleep. As a result, they have deteriorating effects on cognitive performance following intake. Most hypnotics are benzodiazepine receptor agonists which can have effects on memory in addition to their sedative effects. Other sedating drugs, such as histamine H1 antagonists or melatonin agonists, may have less effect on memory and learning. Hypnotics with other mechanisms of action are currently being investigated for efficacy and safety. For patients using hypnotic drugs, the effects on cognition are relevant to the extent that a drug dose affects daytime performance. Use of benzodiazepine hypnotics is associated with increased risk of car accidents and falling. Therefore, most hypnotics are studied to determine whether they produce residual sedation and impairing effects on performance the morning after bedtime use. Experimental studies using a standardized driving test clearly show that some drugs and doses produce severe residual effects, whereas others seem to have no or only minor impairing effects on next-day performance. No hypnotic has been found yet to improve daytime performance. Studies on long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics suggest that effects on daytime performance may diminish over time due to tolerance. However, there are also studies showing that performance may improve after discontinuation of chronic benzodiazepine use, which suggests that tolerance may not be complete.",

Sample preparation includes mixed-mode solid-phase extraction and derivatization with silylating reagents. Midazolam-d4 was used as an internal standard for the determination of parent drug and its active metabolite. The instrumentation consisted of a capillary column gas chromatography and a single quadrupole mass spectrometer with a negative chemical ionization. The method was found to be valid in terms of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery over the concentration range of 2-200 ng/ml and 1-100 ng/ml for midazolam and 1-hydroxymidazolam, respectively. For both analytes, the lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/ml. Midazolam was stable in stock solutions stored three months at -20\u00b0C and in human plasma stored for three months at -80\u00b0C. In addition, no degradation of midazolam was found after three freeze-thaw cycles, in short-term stability at room temperature for 24h, or in post-preparative stability in the autosampler. The validity of the method was further tested by performing a pharmacokinetic study of sublingual administration of midazolam in rabbits.

In this work ADLR method is used to rationalize the affinity data of 23 new compounds and to improve the knowledge on HBp-3 area, hydrogen bond area. Among these new compounds emerge the pyrrolo derivatives (18, 25, 28, 34, and 37) for their good affinity value (14.9>K(i)(nM)>63.0). In the orientations proposed by ADLR, the NH moiety of the pyrrole ring, independently of the position in the pyrazolobenzotriazine core, fits in HBp-3 area and points out the acceptor feature of this hydrogen bond area, already known as donor area. Unexpectedly, the oxygen atom of the furane ring does not form efficient hydrogen bond with the same area, probably for an imperfect distance. The size of substituent at position 8 is important but not necessary for the receptor recognition, in fact the interdependence between the features of the 3- and 8-substituent's is again verified, (i.e., compound 20 vs 32).",

In literature, there are different opinions regarding the phenobarbital, a common antiepileptic drug, and its effective role in the genesis and development of Dupuytren's disease. In this retrospective investigation the association between phenobarbital and Dupuytren's contracture is discussed. Three patients in treatment with phenobarbital who had no others significant risk factors for Dupuytren's contracture were included in this study. The disease occurred after one to four years of drug therapy, at dosage of 100 mg/day. After surgery, Dupuytren's disease showed different evolutions in relation to dosage and type of antiepileptic drug used. Phenobarbital causes a dose and time-dipendent profibrotic effect. A clinical regression was observed when phenobarbital was substituted by carbamazepine, maintaining the same dosage (100 mg/day). This data confirms that not all the antiepileptic drugs are implicated in palmar fibrosis, and suggests that, according to the efficacy and adverse effects, the administration of benzodiazepine reduces the risk of Dupuytren's recurrence.",

This is a retrospective observational cohort drawn from Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care databases, January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007. We included 28,554 patients who received methadone and 79,938 who received long-acting morphine from VA pharmacies. Compared with those who received long-acting morphine, patients who received methadone were younger, less likely to have some medical comorbidities, and more likely to have psychiatric and substance use disorders. Patients were stratified into quintiles according to propensity score; the probability of receiving methadone was conditional on demographic, clinical, and VA service area variables. Overall propensity-adjusted mortality was lower for methadone than for morphine. Hazard ratios varied across propensity score quintiles; the magnitude of the between-drug difference in mortality decreased as the propensity to receive methadone increased. Mortality was significantly lower for methadone in all but the last quintile, in which there was no between-drug difference in mortality (hazard ratio=0.92, 95% confidence interval=0.74, 1.16). Multiple sensitivity analyses found either no difference in mortality between methadone and long-acting morphine or lower mortality rates among patients who received methadone. In summary, we found no evidence of excess all-cause mortality among VA patients who received methadone compared with those who received long-acting morphine. Randomized trials and prospective observational research are needed to better understand the relative safety of long-acting opioids.", 
    "53": "After more than 70 years of considerable efforts, research on medical defense against nerve agents has come to a standstill. Major progress in medical countermeasures was achieved between the 50s and 70s with the development of anticholinergic drugs and carbamate-based pretreatment, the introduction of pyridinium oximes as antidotes, and benzodiazepines in emergency treatments. These drugs ensure good protection of the peripheral nervous system and mitigate the acute effects of exposure to lethal doses of nerve agents. However, pyridostigmine and cholinesterase reactivators currently used in the armed forces do not protect/reactivate central acetylcholinesterases. Moreover, other drugs used are not sufficiently effective in protecting the central nervous system against seizures, irreversible brain damages and long-term sequelae of nerve agent poisoning.New developments of medical counter-measures focus on: (a) detoxification of organophosphorus molecules before they react with acetylcholinesterase and other physiological targets by administration of stoichiometric or catalytic scavengers; (b) protection and reactivation of central acetylcholinesterases, and (c) improvement of neuroprotection following delayed therapy.Future developments will aim at treatment of acute and long-term effects of low level exposure to nerve agents, research on alternative routes for optimizing drug delivery, and therapies. Though gene therapy for in situ generation of bioscavengers, and cell therapy based on neural progenitor engraftment for neuronal regeneration have been successfully explored, more studies are needed before practical medical applications can be made of these new approaches.", 
    "54": "Dravet syndrome is a highly pharmaco-resistant form of epilepsy. Valproate and benzodiazepines are the first-line treatment but are usually insufficient therapeutic options. Lamotrigine, carbamazepine and high doses of intravenous phenobarbital can aggravate seizures and should be avoided. Topiramate, levetiracetam, bromide and ketogenic diet also provide substantial efficacy as adjunctive therapy and procedures. Stiripentol is the only new drug to demonstrate efficacy when combined with valproate and clobazam, as shown in two independent double-blind controlled trials dedicated to Dravet children. In order to avoid side effects (mainly loss of appetite and loss of weight) resulting from the inhibition of cytochromes P450 by stiripentol, the prescribed doses of valproate and clobazam should be reduced. Stiripentol has a proper antiepileptic effect and enhances GABAergic neurotransmission by acting on the alpha-3 subunit of GABA(A) receptors. Stiripentol was approved as an orphan drug in Europe in 2007 for adjunctive therapy in Dravet syndrome. More than 500 Dravet patients have currently been satisfactorily treated and recent experiments in Japan have confirmed stiripentol's benefit. In practice, valproate should be initiated at the first onset of complicated febrile seizure in Dravet patients. Relapses justify the addition of clobazam and stiripentol when available. Topiramate and a ketogenic diet are alternatives in pharmaco-resistant cases.", 
    "55": "As a tumor suppressor, p53 protein regulates the cell cycle and is involved in preventing tumorgenesis. The protein level of p53 is under the tight control of its negative regulator human double minute 2 (HDM(2)) via ubiquitination. Therefore, the design of inhibitors of HDM(2) has attracted much interest of research on developing novel anticancer drugs. Presently, two classes of molecules, i.e., the 1,4-benzodiazepine-2,5-diones (BDPs) and N-Acylpolyamine (NAPA) derivatives were studied by three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling approaches including the comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity index analysis (CoMSIA) as promising p53-HDM(2) inhibitors. Based on both the ligand-based and receptor-guided (docking) alignments, two optimal 3D-QSAR models were obtained with good predictive power of q(2) = 0.41, r(2)(pred) = 0.60 for BDPs, and q(2) = 0.414, r(2)(pred) = 0.69 for NAPA analogs, respectively. By analysis of the model and its related contour maps, it is revealed that the electrostatic interactions contributed much larger to the compound binding affinity than the steric effects. And the contour maps intuitively suggested where to modify the molecular structures in order to improve the binding affinity. In addition, molecular dynamics simulation (MD) study was also carried out on the dataset with purpose of exploring the detailed binding modes of ligand in the HDM(2) binding pocket. Based on the CoMFA contour maps and MD-based docking analyses, some key structural aspects responsible for inhibitory activity of these two classes of compounds were concluded as follows: For BDPs, the R(1) and R(3) regions should have small electronegativity groups; substituents R(2) and R(4) should be larger, and R(3) substituent mainly involves in H-bonds forming. For NAPA derivatives, bulky and electropositive groups in ring B and ring A, small substituent at region P is favorable for the inhibitory activity. The models and related information, we hope, may provide important insight into the inhibitor-p53-HDM(2) interactions and be helpful for facilitating the design of novel potent inhibitors.",

Symptoms of sympathetic overdrive include anxiety, agitation, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, and tremor. Therefore, \u03b1(2)-agonists, which decrease norepinephine release, may have a role in reducing alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The majority of controlled animal and human studies evaluated clonidine, but the most recent literature is from case reports on dexmedetomidine. The literature reviewed here demonstrate that these 2 \u03b1(2)-agonists safely and effectively reduce symptoms of sympathetic overdrive and concomitant medication use.

We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in the drug metabolizing enzyme, cytochrome P450 3A43 (CYP3A43; rs472660), that highly significantly predicted olanzapine clearance in the Clinical Antipsychotic Trials of Intervention Effectiveness trial (P=5.9e(-7)). Moreover, at standard antipsychotic doses, 50% of individuals with the high clearance genotype (AA) have trough blood levels below the therapeutic range. Interestingly, a much higher proportion of African Americans carry the A allele compared with Caucasians (allele frequency 67 vs 14%). After accounting for CYP3A43 genotype, race is no longer a significant predictor of olanzapine clearance. Olanzapine clearance was associated with measures of clinical response. Patients with greater clearance had higher symptom ratings and were more likely to discontinue treatment due to an inadequate response. Our data identify a genetic mechanism for variation in olanzapine response and demonstrate that blood level monitoring of olanzapine treatment is advisable.",

    "78": "Magnolol at doses of 40 and 80 mg\u00b7kg(-1) significantly delayed the onset of myoclonic jerks and generalized clonic seizures, and decreased the seizure stage and mortality compared with those of the vehicle-treated animals. EEG recordings showed that magnolol (40 and 80 mg\u00b7kg(-1)) prolonged the latency of seizure onset and decreased the number of seizure spikes. The anti-epileptic effect of magnolol was reversed by the GABA(A)/benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil. Pretreatment with flumazenil decreased the effects of magnolol on prolongation of seizure latency and decline of seizure stage. In a Mg(2+)-free model of epileptiform activity, using multi-electrode array recordings in mouse hippocampal slices, magnolol decreased spontaneous epileptiform discharges. Magnolol also significantly decreased seizure-induced Fos immunoreactivity in the piriform cortex, dentate gyrus and hippocampal area CA1. These effects were attenuated by pretreatment with flumazenil.",

Although initially considered pathognomonic of hepatic encephalopathy, TWs have been described in association with a large number of conditions. TWs may occur in encephalopathies (metabolic or structural) or as an ictal pattern. Nonepileptic TWs with sharply contoured morphology may resemble epileptic patterns encountered in nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE), thus leading to misinterpretation and overinterpretation of this pattern as ictal, if only the EEG is considered. An electroclinical response to benzodiazepines and the evaluation of consciousness impairment should be considered when interpreting TWs. Evaluating only the EEG without considering also clinical and laboratory findings is not only useless and meaningless, but may even lead to serious consequences.",

Cyclosporin A did not affect the resting membrane potential and hyperpolarization to acetylcholine and histamine in intact and cultured cells. In contrast, CGP37157 (20 mcM) evoked membrane depolarization in unstimulated cells and suppressed the sustained component of hyperpolarization to acetylcholine and histamine both in intact and cultured endothelial cells, respectively. This was accompanied by a pronounced depolarization with membrane potential oscillations, which were not observed in the absence of Ca2+. We conclude that CGP37157 modulates endothelial membrane potential at rest and electrical responses to endothelium-dependent dilators. Possible mechanisms accompanying the CGP37157 action are discussed.", 
    "82": "Benzodiazepines (BDZ) are widely prescribed in the treatment of anxiety disorders associated to aging. Interestingly, whereas a reciprocal interaction between the GABAergic system and HPA axis has been evidenced, there is to our knowledge no direct evaluation of the impact of BDZ on both hippocampus (HPC) corticosterone concentrations and HPC-dependent memory in stressed middle-aged subjects. We showed previously that an acute stress induced in middle-aged mice severe memory impairments in a hippocampus-dependent task, and increased in parallel hippocampus corticosterone concentrations, as compared to non-stressed middle-aged controls (Tronche et al., 2010). Based on these findings, the aims of the present study were to evidence the impact of diazepam (a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA-A receptor) on HPC glucocorticoids concentrations and in parallel on HPC-dependent memory in acutely stressed middle-aged mice. Microdialysis experiments showed an interaction between diazepam doses and corticosterone concentrations into the HPC. From 0.25 to 0.5\u2009mg/kg, diazepam dose-dependently reduces intra-HPC corticosterone concentrations and in parallel, dose-dependently increased hippocampal-dependent memory performance. In contrast, the highest (1.0\u2009mg/kg) diazepam dose induces a reduction in HPC corticosterone concentration, which was of greater magnitude as compared to the two other diazepam doses, but however decreased the hippocampal-dependent memory performance. In summary, our study provides first evidence that diazepam restores in stressed middle-aged animals the hippocampus-dependent response, in relation with HPC corticosterone concentrations. Overall, our data illustrate how stress and benzodiazepines could modulate cognitive functions depending on hippocampus activity.", 
    "83": "Benzodiazepines and neuroactive steroids are positive c-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) modulators acting at distinct binding sites; during benzodiazepine treatment, tolerance develops to many behavioral effects of benzodiazepines, although cross tolerance typically does not develop to neuroactive steroids. To determine whether differential changes in binding sites contribute to these behavioral differences, interactions between GABA(A) modulators were studied in two groups of four monkeys: one otherwise untreated group discriminated 0.178 mg/kg of the benzodiazepine midazolam; the other received 5.6 mg/kg/day of diazepam and discriminated 0.1 mg/kg of flumazenil, which binds to benzodiazepine sites without modulating GABA(A) receptors. In untreated monkeys, flumazenil antagonized midazolam but not the neuroactive steroid pregnanolone, whereas pentylenetetrazole (a negative modulator acting at a third site) antagonized both positive modulators. In diazepam-treated monkeys, 0.1 mg/kg of flumazenil or 32 mg/kg of pentylenetetrazole produced flumazenil-lever responding, which was reversed by midazolam and pregnanolone. As the flumazenil dose increased, larger doses of midazolam, but not pregnanolone, were needed to reverse flumazenil-lever responding. When the pentylenetetrazole dose increased, larger doses of both positive modulators were needed. Thus, interactions between GABA(A) modulators were not different between diazepam-treated and untreated monkeys and do not reveal changes in binding sites that could account for reported differences between benzodiazepines and neuroactive steroids.", 
    "84": "We report a case of malignant catatonia initially diagnosed as neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) that responded successfully to diazepam administration. A 29-year-old man with mental retardation was admitted to our hospital because of high fever, muscle pain, and consciousness disturbance. Fifteen days before admission, he had developed muscle pain and weakness in his legs. He presented with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, elevated blood pressure, excessive sweating, and neurological findings of lethargy and severe muscle rigidity in the neck and extremities. Laboratory findings included elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level. His clinical features and the laboratory test results fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for NMS. He was treated for NMS with dantrolene sodium and bromocriptine mesylate for 2 weeks; however, there was no improvement. Therefore, treatment was changed to diazepam administration because of suspected malignant catatonia. One week after initiation of diazepam administration, his symptoms gradually improved, and the serum CPK level normalized. The diagnosis of malignant catatonia was confirmed because treatment with diazepam was dramatically effective, whereas the initial treatment for NMS was not beneficial. The clinical presentation of malignant catatonia is similar to that of NMS. Indeed, some authors have described NMS as a variant of malignant catatonia. If treatment is refractory in cases of NMS, malignant catatonia may be suspected, and changing treatment to diazepam administration may be useful.",

The database collects medical and prescription claims and a subset of laboratory results for an employed, commercially insured population distributed throughout the United States. Patients with previously diagnosed diabetes, identified by the ICD-9-CM code of 250.x or use of antidiabetic agents, were excluded. The main exposure measure was the cumulative dose over a 30 day period before the HbA(1c) test, calculated as [sum of (number of pills per day\u00d7strength)]/100. A logistic regression was used to examine the relation with HbA(1c) >6.0 by tertile of the cumulative dose and average daily dose, adjusted for the covariates. The study included 391 patients on olanzapine, 467 on quetiapine, and 262 on risperidone. Patients treated with aripiprazole or ziprasidone (n=212) were included as a secondary reference because of their minimal metabolic risk. Compared to lower (Tertiles 1 and 2) cumulative doses of risperidone, patients with a high cumulative dose of risperidone (Tertile 3) had a significantly higher odds ratio (OR) for HbA(1c) >6.0 (adjusted OR=2.45; 95% confidence interval=1.13-5.32; P=0.023). A similar increase in OR was seen in patients with high cumulative dose of olanzapine (2.41; 1.19-4.89; P=0.015). Analyses of average daily dose revealed that quetiapine \u2265 400 mg/day and risperidone \u2265 2 mg/day had an OR of 2.29 (1.04-5.06; P=0.041) and 2.28 (1.08-4.83; P=0.032), respectively, compared to aripiprazole/ziprasidone. Both olanzapine groups (\u2265 10 and <10mg/day) were associated with a significantly increased OR. All results remained similar after further adjustment for the predicated probability of having an HbA(1c) test and additional medication covariates. In this claims data study, use of olanzapine was associated with elevated HbA(1c) and risperidone and quetiapine appeared to have dose-related association with elevated HbA(1c). One of the limitations of a claims data analysis is the lack of information on potential confounders such as ethnicity and weight.",

Although ethnicity also contributes to MetS risk, the majority of the studies on the relationship of SGAs to this syndrome come from Western countries, whereas few reports have come from Asian countries, especially regarding patients taking a single SGA. We reviewed the electronic medical records of patients with schizophrenia who received aripiprazole, olanzapine or risperidone monotherapies for at least three months. We evaluated the prevalence of MetS in our sample as well as the indirect standardized prevalence ratio (ISPR) using data from the 4th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHNES, 2007). The prevalence of MetS in our sample (n=145) was 31.7%, and the ISPR was 2.09. Male patients had a higher prevalence of MetS than female patients (odds ratio [OR]=4.18, 95% CI=1.93-9.03). The ISPR of male patients was 2.67 and statistically significant, whereas the ISPR of female patients was not significant. In our sample, the frequency of abnormal MetS subcomponents occurred in descending order: increased waist circumference, increased triglyceride levels, decreased HDL-cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Patients who received aripiprazole were significantly less likely to have MetS. However, a logistic regression showed that age and sex, but not the type of antipsychotic, its dose or the use of antidepressants, were significantly related to the presence of MetS. There were no statistically significant differences among SGAs in terms of MetS subcomponent abnormalities of after adjusting for age and sex. In conclusion, only male Korean patients with schizophrenia who received a monotherapy of aripiprazole, olanzapine or risperidone for more than three months were more likely to have MetS than the general population.",

The results obtained by the devices were compared with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmation analysis results in oral fluid. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the tests, as well as positive and negative predictive values, were calculated based on the classified results of the comparison. Both of the devices were evaluated for their ability to meet toxicological cutoffs as set in the DRUID project (www.druid-project.eu) as well as those reported by the manufacturers. The evaluation was performed for relevant drug groups of both devices: amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and opiates. Additionally, Rapid STAT has a test for benzodiazepines included in the same device. Both tests seemed to perform quite well for amphetamines although they also gave negative results for cases with high concentrations. Also, the benzodiazepine test of Rapid STAT was at a relatively good level although only half of the positive test results were true positives using the test cutoffs. The same phenomenon was detected for the cannabis tests of both devices. The proper evaluation of cocaine and opiates tests was not applicable because of the very low number of positive cases.", 
    "101": "Second-generation antipsychotics (SGA), especially clozapine and olanzapine, are associated with an increased metabolic risk. Recent research showed that plasma adiponectin levels, an adipocyte-derived hormone that increases insulin sensitivity, vary in the same way in schizophrenic patients as in the general population according to gender, adiposity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether different SGAs differentially affect plasma adiponectin levels independent of body mass index (BMI) and MetS status. 113 patients with schizophrenia (65.5% males, 32.3years old) who were free of antipsychotic medication were enrolled in this open-label prospective single-center study and received either risperidone (n=54) or olanzapine (n=59). They were followed prospectively for 12weeks. Average daily dose was 4.4mg/day for risperidone and 17.4mg/day for olanzapine. Plasma adiponectin levels as well as fasting metabolic parameters were measured at baseline, 6weeks and 12weeks. The two groups had similar baseline demographic and metabolic characteristics. A significant increase in body weight was observed over time. This increase was significantly larger in the olanzapine group than in the risperidone group (+7.0kg versus +3.1kg, p<0.0002). Changes in fasting glucose and insulin levels and in HOMA-IR, an index of insulin resistance, were not significantly different in both treatment groups. MetS prevalence increased significantly more in the olanzapine group as compared to the risperidone groups where the prevalence did not change over time. We observed a significant (p=0.0015) treatment by time interaction showing an adiponectin increase in the risperidone-treated patients (from 10,154 to 11,124ng/ml) whereas adiponectin levels decreased in olanzapine treated patients (from 11,280 to 8988ng/ml). This effect was independent of BMI and the presence/absence of MetS. The differential effect of antipsychotic treatment (risperidone versus olanzapine) on plasma adiponectin levels over time, independent of changes in waist circumference and antipsychotic dosing, suggests a specific effect on adipose tissues, similar to what has been observed in animal models. The observed olanzapine-associated reduction in plasma adiponectin levels may at least partially contribute to the increased metabolic risk of olanzapine compared to risperidone.",

The subjects were exposed to two experimental conditions: the placebo (PL) and 6 mg of bromazepam (Br 6 mg), following a randomized, double-blind design on different days. Specifically, we observe absolute power extracted from qEEG data for theta band. We expected to see a decrease in absolute theta power in the temporal and parietal areas due to the influence of bromazepam for the experimental group when compared with the placebo group. We found a main effect for the condition factor for electrodes T3, T4, P3 and P4. We also observed a main effect for the period factor for electrodes P3 and P4. We observed that the ingestion of 6 mg of bromazepam induces different patterns in theta power at the temporal and parietal sites. We concluded that 6 mg of bromazepam was an important factor in the fluctuation of the activities in the temporal and parietal areas. We then hypothesize about the specific role of this drug during the execution of a visuomotor task and within the sensorimotor integration process.",

    "104": "A retrospective, matched-groups comparison study was completed. Medical files of 86 female patients treated in the eating disorder program at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario were examined. Patients treated with olanzapine were initially identified through chart review and then matched to a diagnosis, age, and, when possible, treatment group that served as the active comparator. Weight gain was examined in a sample of 22 inpatients.", 
    "105": "Patients treated with olanzapine displayed greater evidence of psychopathology and medical compromise at the time of first assessment compared with those not treated. Rate of weight gain was not statistically different between groups when olanzapine was started during inpatient admissions. Medication effect on eating disorder cognitions could not be assessed given the presence of multiple confounders relating to treatment. Notable side effects included sedation and dyslipidemia in 56% of patients.", 
    "106": "Despite our best attempts at matching olanzapine-treated subjects with a control sample, analysis revealed significant differences between groups, suggesting greater illness severity in those augmented with olanzapine. Given these inherent differences, we were unable to draw any firm conclusions regarding the potential efficacy of olanzapine. Factors associated with the prescription of adjunctive pharmacotherapy in this cohort appear to be linked to illness severity, acuity, and associated comorbidity. The observed side-effect profile indicates the need for more consistent predrug screening and for closer monitoring during treatment.",

An LC-MS/MS assay was developed with an Allure\u00ae PFP propyl column and a mobile phase of 35% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid over 4.5 min and ESI+-MS/MS detection. Matrix effects were negligible in plasma and approximately 70% in ultrafiltrate but were accounted for by the internal standards Lzp-d\u2084, Ozp-d\u2085 and Tzp-d\u2085. The assay was validated for total concentrations of 10-100 ng/ml Lzp, 200-2000 ng/ml Ozp and 100-1000 ng/ml Tzp, and for unbound concentrations of 1-10 ng/ml Lzp, 20-200 ng/ml Ozp and 10-100 ng/ml Tzp. Precision was <14% CV and accuracy was 96-110% throughout the calibration range.

    "110": "A randomised clinical study was conducted in 60 ASA I-II patients undergoing elective upper limb orthopaedic surgeries (duration of surgery < or =120 minutes). All the patients were divided into two groups (n=30 each), group C (clonidine) and group M (midazolam). All were premedicated with injection glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg intramuscular 30 minutes before surgery and given injection bupivacaine 0.5% plain 20 ml and injection lignocaine 2% plain 10 ml in supraclavicular brachial plexus block. In group C patients injection clonidine 150 mcg and in group M injection midazolam preservative free 5 mg were administered along with local anaesthetics. All the patients were observed for onset and duration of sensory and motor blockade, sedation score, postoperative analgesia with visual analogue scale (VAS) score up to 12 hours. There was no clinically significant difference in onset and duration of sensory and motor blockade among both the study groups. Intra-operative haemodynamic monitoring with non-invasive blood pressure, pulse rate, ECG, and Sp(o2) was done. In group C more sedation (score 2) was observed compared to group M (score 1) though the data is not statistically significant. Postoperative analgesia was more prolonged in group C (VAS score < or =3 for 360 minutes) as compared to group M (VAS score < or =3 for 300 minutes), time of rescue analgesia was noticed in the form of patient demand analgesia (VAS score > or =3) and injection diclofenac 75 mg intramuscular was given. In group C 22 patients required only 1 dose while 7 patients required 2 doses and only 1 patient required 3 doses in 24 hours. In group M 5 patients required 1 dose and 23 patients required 2 doses and 2 patients required 3 doses in 24hours, though the data was not statistically significant. No complication was observed in any patient in both the groups. So injection clonidine provides better postoperative analgesia and more sedation than midazolam.", 
    "111": "The regional methods of analgesia are the \"golden standard\" of choice during trauma surgeries. The supraclavicular block of the bracheal plexus is the method of choice during the cubital joint surgeries. The purpose of the study is to improve the effectiveness of anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgical interventions on the cubital joint in children by developing and implementing the clinical practice of peripheral blockade of the brachial plexus by the supraclavicular access. The study included 40 children aged 5 to 12 years. The children rated as ASA I, came to the clinic on an emergency basis with cubital joint bones injuries. All the children were had surgeries on the cubital joint (closed and open repositions with osteosynthesis) with balanced regional anesthesia, the main analgesic component of which was supraclavicular brachial plexus block (by Kulenkampf-Fursaev technique). The supraclavicular block was performed in conditions of psychological comfort of the child. For the means of premedication age appropriate doses of seduxen or midazolam were intravenously administered. Intraoperative sedation was conducted by the re-introduction of benzodiazepines, and ketamine (up to 1 mg/kg/h). During the study period, the effective intraoperative analgesia, provided by supraclavicular blockade of peripheral nerves, was observed in 31 children. In 9 patients the blockade could be found to be incomplete at the second stage of the surgery (reposition). For this reason, it took the additional administration of tramal in a dose of 2 mg/kg and deepening of sedation with ketamine up to the dose of 2 mg/kg/h. The duration of effective postoperative analgesia due to long-acting local anesthetic (0.5% solution of naropin) was 8-9 hours. There were no complications registered as a result of supraclavicular. Thus, this study proves that the supraclavicular brachial plexus block provides effective intra and postoperative analgesia in trauma operations on the cubital joint in children.", 
    "112": "Tardive dyskinesia (TD) rates with second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are considered to be low relative to first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs), even in the particularly vulnerable elderly population. However, risk estimates are unavailable for patients na\u00efve to FGAs. Therefore, we aimed to determine the TD incidence in particularly vulnerable, antipsychotic-na\u00efve elderly patients treated with the SGA risperidone or olanzapine. The present work describes a prospective inception cohort study of antipsychotic-na\u00efve elderly patients aged \ue2f655 years identified at New York Metropolitan area in-patient and out-patient geriatric psychiatry facilities and nursing homes at the time of risperidone or olanzapine initiation. At baseline, 4 weeks, and at quarterly periods, patients underwent assessments of medical and medication history, abnormal involuntary movements, and extra-pyramidal signs. TD was classified using Schooler-Kane criteria. Included in the analyses were 207 subjects (age: 79.8 years, 70.0% female, 86.5% White), predominantly diagnosed with dementia (58.9%) or a major mood disorder (30.9%), although the principal treatment target was psychosis (78.7%), with (59.4%) or without (19.3%) agitation. With risperidone (n=159) the cumulative TD rate was 5.3% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 9.9%) after 1 year (mean dose: 1.0\u00b10.76\u2009mg/day) and 7.2% (CI: 1.4, 12.9%) after 2 years. With olanzapine (n=48) the cumulative TD rate was 6.7% (CI: 0, 15.6%) after 1 year (mean dose: 4.3\u00b11.9\u2009mg/day) and 11.1% (CI: 0, 23.1%) after 2 years. TD risk was higher in females, African Americans, and patients without past antidepressant treatment or with FGA co-treatment. The TD rates for geriatric patients treated with risperidone and olanzapine were comparable and substantially lower than previously reported for similar patients in direct observation studies using FGAs. This information is relevant for all patients receiving antipsychotics, not just the especially sensitive elderly.", 
    "113": "In short-term efficacy studies, coprescription of a benzodiazepine improves first-month adherence and response to antidepressant treatment. We used Veterans Health Administration data to examine the impact of coprescribed benzodiazepines on initial antidepressant adherence in routine clinical practice and the risks of long-term benzodiazepine use, abuse, and dependence. Our study population was 43,915 Veterans Health Administration patients diagnosed with depression and started on an antidepressant between October 2006 and September 2007. Using logistic regression, adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates, we predicted the likelihood that patients received antidepressant treatment for an adequate duration (90 days), with our primary independent variable of interest being receipt of a benzodiazepine on the same day as the start of the antidepressant. We also assessed the frequency and characteristics of patients whose benzodiazepine use persisted for 1 year or who were diagnosed with anxiolytic abuse or dependence after receiving combined treatment. The adjusted probability of receiving antidepressant treatment of adequate duration was 42.4% for patients who received a benzodiazepine with their initial antidepressant compared with 39.3% for patients initially treated with an antidepressant alone (P < 0.001). Among patients who received combined treatment, 14.1% subsequently used benzodiazepines for at least 1 year, and 0.7% were diagnosed with anxiolytic abuse or dependence. Anxiolytic abuse or dependence, but not long-term benzodiazepine use, was associated with other substance use disorders. These findings should be considered by clinicians when assessing the individual risks and benefits of combining a benzodiazepine with antidepressant treatment.", 
    "114": "The primary objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that 1 or more dose levels of LY2140023 monohydrate, an oral prodrug of the potent metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 2/3 receptor agonist LY404039, given to patients with schizophrenia for 4 weeks would demonstrate significantly greater efficacy than placebo. The HBBI study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo- and active-controlled trial. Male and female patients aged 18 to 65 years who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophrenia were randomized in a 2:2:2:2:2:1 ratio to receive 5-, 20-, 40-, or 80-mg LY2140023 monohydrate twice daily, placebo twice daily, or placebo (am) and 15 mg of olanzapine (pm) daily. Efficacy was defined as the change from baseline on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score assessed at 4 weeks. The primary analysis did not show that any of the 4 LY2140023 monohydrate doses were more efficacious than placebo as measured by the PANSS total score. Similarly, olanzapine did not significantly separate from placebo. A higher-than-anticipated treatment effect (14.6-point improvement) in the placebo group was observed on PANSS total score. LY2140023 monohydrate was generally well tolerated, although 4 patients reported the serious adverse event of convulsion. LY2140023 monohydrate-treated patients showed little change in dopamine-related adverse events and weight. The results of the HBBI study are considered to be inconclusive because LY2140023 monohydrate and the active control olanzapine did not separate from placebo in the treatment of patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia. Additional efficacy, safety, and tolerability testing are needed.", 
    "115": "Weight gain during olanzapine/fluoxetine combination (OFC) therapy is very common. We examined early (at 2 weeks) weight gain as a predictor of later (at 26 weeks) substantial weight gain in patients with treatment-resistant depression during OFC pharmacotherapy. Data were analyzed from 2 studies (Study 1 and Study 2)-each with an acute, double-blind phase and an open-label phase-in patients who completed 26 weeks of open-label treatment (N = 306). Mean patient age was 46 years; the majority was female and white. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) were examined using early weight gain of 2 kg or more as a predictor of 10 kg or more substantial weight gain. Sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity for Study 1 (n = 73) were 33% and 71%, respectively; PPV and NPV were 23% and 80%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for Study 2 (n = 233) were 52% and 70%, respectively; PPV and NPV were 31% and 85%, respectively. Overall, in the 2 trials analyzed, for patients who did not gain 2 kg or more (2.54 lb) in the first 2 weeks of OFC treatment, the observed frequency was 16.3% for gaining 10 kg or more at 26 weeks. Compared to those with early weight gain, patients without early weight gain were less likely to have substantial weight gain after OFC treatment. Additional research is needed to further explore the predictive power of early weight gain for subsequent substantial weight gain in patients with treatment-resistant depression treated with OFC.",

    "120": "Chronic pain is a sensory experience that produces suffering and functional impairment and is the result of both sensory input as well as secondary adaptation of the nervous system. The sensitization of the nervous system to pain is influenced by physical activity (or inactivity) and medication exposure. Medication taking and physical activity are behaviors that are increased or decreased by positive and negative reinforcement. Patients often have comorbid psychiatric conditions at presentation, including addictions, mood disorders, personality vulnerabilities and life circumstances that amplify their disability and impede their recovery. Behavioral conditioning contributes to chronic pain disorders in the form of both classical (Pavlov) and operant (Skinner) conditioning that increases the experience of pain, the liability to ongoing injury, the central amplification of pain, the use of reinforcing medications such as opiates and benzodiazepines, and behaviors associated with disability. The term 'abnormal illness behavior' has been used to describe behaviors that are associated with illness but are not explained physiologically. Behavioral conditioning often amplifies these abnormal behaviors in patients with chronic pain. Addiction can also be seen as a behavior that is reinforced and conditioned. The same factors that amplify abnormal illness behaviors also increase the liability to addiction. Psychiatric comorbidities also complicate and amplify abnormal illness behaviors and addictive behaviors and further contribute to the disability of chronic pain patients. Model interventions that reinforce healthy behaviors and extinguish illness behaviors are effective in patients with addictions and chronic pain. Maladaptive behaviors including addictive behaviors can be used as targets for classical and operant conditioning techniques, and these techniques are demonstrably effective in patients with chronic pain and addictions.", 
    "121": "Seizures are serious complications seen in critically ill patients and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality if the cause is not identified and treated quickly. Uncontrolled seizures can lead to status epilepticus (SE), which is considered a medical emergency. The first-line treatment of seizures is an intravenous (IV) benzodiazepine followed by anticonvulsant therapy. Refractory SE can evolve into a nonconvulsive state requiring IV anesthetics or induction of pharmacological coma. To prevent seizures and further complications in critically ill patients with acute neurological disease or injury, short-term seizure prophylaxis should be considered in certain patients.",

EEG may be highly heterogeneous, varying from the 3 to 3.5 Hz spike-wave discharges typical of idiopathic generalized epilepsy to asymmetric irregular sharp and slow wave complexes. We report the clinical and neurophysiologic 14 years follow-up of a now 86 years-old woman, in whom we observed--at the age of 72--an idiopathic late-onset ASE, with a good clinical response to lamotrigine monotherapy, but with the persistence over years of the same interictal 3-3.5 Hz spike-wave epileptic activity at EEG. This case is singular because, with the available long follow-up, indicates that idiopathic generalized epilepsy may also occur in the elderly, with a late-onset ASE presentation. In this condition, it is particularly important to underline the essential role of EEG (urgent and ambulatory) for the diagnosis, management and monitoring of the disease.",

After left functional hemispherectomy, seizures originated from the contralateral hemisphere, which had shown normal signals in the preoperative magnetic resonance imaging study. The second case is of a patient with lissencephaly, caused by a missense mutation in the doublecortin gene, who developed West syndrome at the age of 5 months. In both the cases, (123)I-iomazenil single photon emission computed tomography performed during infancy showed significant hyperfixation in the dysplastic lesions.

A single treatment with 4-O-methylhonokiol (0.1, 0.2, and 0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) or treatment for 7 days (0.5 mg/kg in drinking water) increased the percentage of time spent in the open arms and the number of open arms entries in the elevated plus-maze test. However, the 4-O-methylhonokiol-increased percentage of time spent in the open arm was abolished by treatment with flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist (10 mg/kg). 4-O-Methylhonokiol also increased the number of head dips in the hole-board test, but decreased locomotor activity. Molecular experiments revealed that the \u03b11-subunit of \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors was overexpressed in the cortex of brains of mice after treatment with 4-O-methylhonokiol for 7 days. In addition, 4-O-methylhonokiol also increased chloride influx in cultured cortical cells.

Both the C (max) and AUC of omeprazole when co-administered with patupilone were highly variable and lower than with omeprazole alone. However, the oral clearance and terminal half-lives were similar. The latter data suggest that patupilone decreased the absorption of omeprazole (by ~20%).

    "153": "Intermittent drug dosing intervals are usually initially guided by the terminal pharmacokinetic half life and are dependent on drug formulation. For chronic multiple dosing and for extended release dosage forms, the terminal half life often does not predict the plasma drug accumulation or fluctuation observed. We define and advance applications for the operational multiple dosing half lives for drug accumulation and fluctuation after multiple oral dosing at steady-state. Using Monte Carlo simulation, our results predict a way to maximize the operational multiple dosing half lives relative to the terminal half life by using a first-order absorption rate constant close to the terminal elimination rate constant in the design of extended release dosage forms. In this way, drugs that may be eliminated early in the development pipeline due to a relatively short half life can be formulated to be dosed at intervals three times the terminal half life, maximizing compliance, while maintaining tight plasma concentration accumulation and fluctuation ranges. We also present situations in which the operational multiple dosing half lives will be especially relevant in the determination of dosing intervals, including for drugs that follow a direct PKPD model and have a narrow therapeutic index, as the rate of concentration decrease after chronic multiple dosing (that is not the terminal half life) can be determined via simulation. These principles are illustrated with case studies on valproic acid, diazepam, and anti-hypertensives.",

    "155": "Normal brain function is facilitated by a highly organized and interconnected structure allowing complex integration of sensory information and motor responses. The acute confusional state of delirium is characterized by a fluctuating disturbance in consciousness, arousal level and cognition-memory; as such, delirium represents a failure in the integration and appropriate processing of information. The pathogenesis of this cognitive disintegration is unclear; herein a hypothesis is proposed that delirium results from an acute breakdown in network connectivity within the brain. The hypothesis predicts that the extent to which the network connectivity breaks down is dependent on two factors: (i) the baseline connectivity within the brain and (ii) the level of inhibitory tone. Baseline connectivity is the connectivity of neural networks within the brain before the precipitating insult provoking delirium. Many non-modifiable risk factors for delirium influence baseline connectivity such as age, cognitive impairment, dementia and depression. Precipitant events that provoke delirium (modifiable risk factors) are hypothesized to further, and acutely, breakdown network connectivity by increasing inhibitory tone within the brain. Modifiable risk factors include inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, sleep deprivation and medication such as benzodiazepines. An important role for GABAergic neurotransmission is implicated in increasing the inhibitory tone to produce delirium. This theory accounts for the various forms of delirium, hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed. The form of delirium that ensues will depend upon how and which networks breakdown (dependent on both the individual's baseline network connectivity and the degree change in inhibitory tone produced).",

We tested the hypothesis that manipulations designed to alter ambient GABA concentrations (tonic conductance) would affect hypnotic (as indicated by loss of righting reflex, LORR) and immobilizing (as indicated by loss of tail-pinch withdrawal reflex, LTWR) actions of sevoflurane, propofol, and midazolam. Two manipulations studied were 1) the genetic absence of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) 65 gene (GAD65-/-), which purportedly reduced ambient GABA concentrations, and 2) the pharmacological manipulation of GABA uptake using GABA transporter inhibitor (NO-711). The influence of these manipulations on cellular and behavioral responses to the anesthetics was studied using behavioral and electrophysiological assays. HPLC revealed that GABA levels in GAD65-/- mice were reduced in the brain (76.7% of WT) and spinal cord (68.5% of WT). GAD65-/- mice showed a significant reduction in the duration of LORR and LTWR produced by propofol and midazolam, but not sevoflurane. NO-711 (3\u00a0mg/kg, ip) enhanced the duration of LORR and LTWR by propofol and midazolam, but not sevoflurane. Patch-clamp recordings revealed that sevoflurane (0.23\u00a0mM) slightly enhanced the amplitude of tonic GABA current in the frontal cortical neurons; however, these effects were not strong enough to alter discharge properties of cortical neurons. These results demonstrate that ambient GABA concentration is an important determinant of the hypnotic and immobilizing actions of propofol and midazolam in mice, whereas manipulations of ambient GABA concentrations minimally alter cellular and behavioral responses to sevoflurane.", 
    "170": "Aging is characterized by progressive impairment of functional capacities of all system organs, reduction in homeostatic mechanisms, and altered response to receptor stimulation. These age-related physiologic changes influence both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of drugs in elderly patients. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics changes as well as polypharmacy and comorbidities may alter significantly the effect of pharmacological treatment with advancing age. With the same drug concentration at the site of action, significant differences in the response to several drugs have been observed in older patients as compared to younger patients. Elderly patients are particularly suceptibles to the effects of frequently prescribed drugs acting on central nervous system, such as benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics and lithium, with high potential for adverse drug reactions. Moreover, in older patients increased sensitivity to warfarin resulting in increased risk of bleeding has been previously documented. On the other hand, reduced effectiveness of conventional doses of cardiovascular drugs, such as diuretics and \u03b2-blockers, has been observed. Due to pharmacodynamic changes, therefore, dose adjustment of the above mentioned cardiovascular and psychotropic drugs is recommended in elderly. Clinicians should be aware of the age-related physiologic changes affecting several organ systems and their implications on the effect of drugs that are commonly prescribed to elderly patients.",

Second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics are associated with a significantly lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms than the typical, first-generation agents; however, changes in metabolic variables -- including impaired glucose metabolism, diabetes mellitus, weight gain and dyslipidaemia -- have been reported during treatment with second-generation antipsychotics. Understanding any potential link between antipsychotic treatment and the incidence of these events is complicated by the increasing prevalence of obesity and diabetes occurring in the general population and the increased risk of diabetes and changes in metabolic variables in people with schizophrenia. While relative risk estimates are inconsistent, the association between atypical antipsychotics and increases in glucose level appears to fall on a continuum, with olanzapine appearing to have a greater association than some other atypical antipsychotics. The PubMed database was used to search for publications that included any information on measures of changes in weight, body mass index (BMI) and/or metabolic variables in randomized studies of olanzapine published between 1992 and 2010. In long-term (\u226548 weeks) studies of olanzapine, the mean weight gain was 5.6\u2009kg (last observation carried forward; median exposure 573 days). The proportions of patients who gained at least 7%, 15% or 25% of their baseline weight with long-term exposure were 64%, 32% and 12%, respectively. Some studies have suggested that weight gain early during the course of olanzapine treatment may predict clinically significant weight gain following long-term exposure to the drug. Changes in metabolic variables, such as elevated indices of glucose metabolism and triglyceride level, have also been observed during treatment with olanzapine. Consensus guidelines emphasize the importance of appropriate baseline screening and ongoing monitoring of weight gain and metabolic variables for people receiving all antipsychotic treatments. Long-term weight management programmes have been shown to reduce weight gain in some patients.",

    "213": "Thirteen studies, 1158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review.Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatments, no statistically significant difference were noted for all the primary outcomes considered. The only outcome statistically significant in favour of naltrexone is re incarceration, RR 0.47 (95%CI 0.26-0.84), but results come only from two studies. Considering only studies were patients were forced to adherence a statistical significant difference in favour of naltrexone was found for retention and abstinence, RR 2.93 (95%CI 1.66-5.18).Comparing naltrexone versus psychotherapy, in the two considered outcomes, no statistically significant difference was found in the single study considered.Naltrexone was not superior to benzodiazepines and to buprenorphine for retention and abstinence and side effects. Results come from single studies.", 
    "214": "The findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. If oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. The percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). The conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. Consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.",

For continuous data we calculated mean differences (MD).", 
    "220": "We identified eight small poorly reported studies for inclusion. For the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in tardive dyskinesia' GABA agonist drugs were not clearly better than placebo (n = 108, 3 RCTs, RR 0.83 CI 0.6 to 1.1). Deterioration in mental state was more likely to occur in people receiving GABA medication (n = 95, 4 RCTs, RR 2.47 CI 1.1 to 5.4), but this effect was influenced by the decision to assign a negative outcome to those who left early before the end of the study. A greater proportion of people allocated GABA medication may fail to complete the trial compared with those allocated placebo (20% versus 9%), but this difference was not statistically significant (n = 136, 5 RCTs, RR 1.99 CI 0.8 to 4.7). There is a suggestion of an increase in ataxia (loss of power of muscular coordination) for both baclofen and sodium valproate (n = 95, 2 RCTs, RR 3.26 CI 0.4 to 30.2), and in sedation (n = 113, 3 RCTs, RR 2.12 CI 0.8 to 5.4) compared with placebo, but this was not significant. Withdrawal of tetrahydroisoxazolopyridine (THIP) may cause seizures.",

    "223": "SJG-136 (1) is a sequence-selective DNA-interactive agent that is about to enter phase II clinical trials for the treatment of malignant disease. Previous studies on the pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine (PBD) dimers, typified by SJG-136 and DSB-120 (2), have shown that these planar ligands react with the exocyclic NH(2) groups of two guanine bases in the base of the minor groove of DNA to form an irreversible interstrand cross-linked sequence-specific adduct. Using high-field NMR, we have characterized and modeled the previously predicted interstrand duplex adduct formed by SJG-136 with the self-complementary 5'-d(CICGATCICG)(2) duplex (4). This first SJG-136 NMR-refined adduct structure has been compared with previous high-field NMR studies of the adducts of the closely related PBD dimer DSB-120 with the same duplex and of the adduct of tomaymycin (3) formed with 5'-d(ATGCAT)(2). Surprisingly, the SJG-136 duplex adduct appears to be more closely related to the tomaymycin adduct than to the DSB-120 adduct with respect of the orientation and depth of insertion of the ligand within the minor groove. The intrastrand duplex adduct formed in the reaction of SJG-136 with the noncomplementary 5'-d(CTCATCAC)\u00b7(GTGATGAG) duplex (5) has also been synthesized and modeled. In this duplex adduct, the nature of the cross-link was confirmed, the central guanines were identified as the sites of alkylation, and the stereochemical configuration at C11 at both ends of the SJG-136 molecule was determined to be S. The NMR-refined solution structures produced for the intrastrand adduct confirm the previously proposed structure (which was based solely on mass spectroscopy). Both the inter- and intrastrand SJG-136 duplex adducts form with minimal distortion of the DNA duplex. These observations have an impact on the proposal for the mechanism of action of SJG-136 both in vitro and in vivo, on the repair of its adducts and mechanism of resistance in cells, and, potentially, on the type of pharmacodynamic assay to be used in clinical trials. SGJ-136 is currently in phase II clinical trials with several groups working on both dimeric cross-linking agents and monoalkylating ligands based on the PBD alkylating moiety. This study suggests subtle differences between the DNA binding of SJG-136 and the C2 unsubstituted analogue DSB-120 that are likely to be the origins of the differences in potency. Confirmation of the stereochemical configuration at the C11 position (particularly in the intrastrand adduct) provides confirmation of binding orientation that was previously only speculation in the HPLC MS study. Together, these observations are likely to be of value in the development of third-generation PBD-based cross-linkers and monoalkylating analogues.", 
    "224": "Anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorders frequently co-occur in humans perhaps because alcohol relieves anxiety. Studies in humans and rats indicate that alcohol may have greater anxiolytic effects in organisms with increased genetic propensity for high alcohol consumption.", 
    "225": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of moderate doses of alcohol (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 g/kg) on the acquisition and expression of anxiety-related behavior using a fear-potentiated startle (FPS) procedure. Experiments were conducted in two replicate pairs of mouse lines selectively bred for high- (HAP1 and HAP2) and low- (LAP1 and LAP2) alcohol preference; these lines have previously shown a genetic correlation between alcohol preference and FPS (HAP\u2009>\u2009LAP; Barrenha and Chester, Alcohol Clin Exp Res 31:1081-1088, 2007). In a control experiment, the effect of diazepam (4.0 mg/kg) on the expression of FPS was tested in HAP2 and LAP2 mice.", 
    "226": "The 1.5 g/kg alcohol dose moderately decreased the expression of FPS in both HAP lines but not LAP lines. Alcohol had no effect on the acquisition of FPS in any line. Diazepam reduced FPS to a similar extent in both HAP2 and LAP2 mice.", 
    "227": "HAP mice may be more sensitive to the anxiolytic effects of alcohol than LAP mice when alcohol is given prior to the expression of FPS. These data collected in two pairs of HAP/LAP mouse lines suggest that the anxiolytic response to alcohol in HAP mice may be genetically correlated with their propensity toward high alcohol preference and robust FPS.", 
    "228": "Over-the-counter (OTC) medications, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates are not covered under many Medicare drug benefit plans; hence, their use by homebound older adults is largely unreported. Furthermore, the tiered design of Medicare drug formularies may in fact promote the use of older but potentially inappropriate medications. Little is known about the use of these medications in the homebound older adult population.",

    "231": "A total of 3911 older adults (mean [SD] age 83.6 [8.0] years) were taking an average of 9.9 [4.8] drugs. Of these individuals, 74.5% were using an OTC medication, 41.9% were using a dietary supplement, 29.6% were using a benzodiazepine or barbiturate, and 25.2% were using at least 1 potentially inappropriate medication.", 
    "232": "Based on data gathered by a geriatric care management assessment, we found that most of the homebound older adults enrolled in our study used medications not included in their Medicare drug benefit. The use of potentially inappropriate medications was also common in this population. Future drug safety initiatives involving the elderly will benefit from engaging care managers in identifying and addressing the potential hazards posed by commonly used prescribed and nonprescribed medications.",

The introduction of bridging elements between the indole N1 and the ortho-position of the 2-aryl moiety resulted in conformationally constrained heterocycles that possess multiple additional vectors for further exploration. The binding mode and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of select examples, including: 13-cyclohexyl-6-oxo-6,7-dihydro-5H-indolo[2,1-d][1,4]benzodiazepine-10-carboxylic acid (7) (IC(50)=0.07 \u03bcM, %F=18), are reported.", 
    "234": "Flutamide is a steroid used to treat androgen-dependent disorders and as antiepileptic, but it induces a number of non-desirable side effects. This work was aimed at assaying the effect of flutamide and two novel synthetic steroids on the levels of GABA, glutamine and oxidative stress markers. Male Wistar rats (weight 180 g) received a single diazepam dose (5 mg/kg) 30 min prior to sacrifice (group A). Group B, flutamide; group C, 16\u03b2-methyl-17\u03b1-benzoyloxypregnen-4-en-3,20-dione; group D, estrone-3-hemisuccinate; group E, testosterone; group F, progesterone; all administered intraperitoneally at 10 mg/kg, daily for 3 days. Brain and prostate were obtained to assess lipid peroxidation (TBARS), Na(+) , K(+) ATPase activity, reduced glutathione (GSH), \u03b3-amino butiric acid (GABA), glutamine and serotonin (5-HT) concentrations through spectrophotometry, fluorescence and HPLC. GABA levels increased and glutamine decreased in group A (P < 0.05). Total ATPase activity increased in group F and TBARS decreased in group B (P < 0.05). GSH decreased in A, B and C groups. 5-HT increased in group A and the prostate weight was increased in group E. The conclusion is that 16\u03b2-methyl-17\u03b1-benzoyloxypregnen-4-en-3,20-dione may be considered novel and promising to treat androgen-dependent diseases and epilepsy, since it showed an antioxidant effect and seemed to impair the GABAergic and serotonergic metabolism.", 
    "235": "We experienced a case of alachlor herbicide (Lasso) intoxication. A 57-year-old man was transported to our hospital by ambulance after ingesting 450 mL of Lasso. He was unconscious and had difficulty in breathing. Gastric lavage was performed after tracheal intubation and the patient was placed on mechanical ventilation. Activated charcoal and laxative were administrated. Even after admission, disturbance of consciousness persisted. He had liver and kidney disorders but these did not progress to multiple organ failure. He experienced convulsions from day 4 and was administered anticonvulsants. Convulsion was intractable and needed long-term treatment. His general condition improved until discharge. He was weaned from mechanical ventilation and recovered consciousness, but he still displayed tremors. The herbicide (Lasso) is a combination of alachlor and monochlorobenzene. Studies have shown that alachlor is neurotoxic and monochlorobenzene accumulates in the brain. In case of intoxication with the herbicide Lasso, treatment is required for ameliorating neurotoxic effects and intractable convulsion as well as liver and kidney disorders, gastrointestinal mucosal damage, hematopoietic disorder, and acute circulatory failure."
